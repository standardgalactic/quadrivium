About the Author
In 1985, James E. Gaskin decided he’d rather sell computers and networks than
try to buy them for his father’s company. So he started selling and installing
Novell networks to small- and medium-sized businesses in the Dallas area. By
1988, James was on his own as an independent networking consultant to such
clients as the Internal Revenue Service, First Gibraltar Bank, and Solomon
Associates.
In 1989, James started contributing to Unix Today! magazine, and he continues to
cover technology for major technology publications (such as Network World)
today. His ﬁrst book, Integrating Unix and NetWare Networks, was published by
Novell Press in 1993, and he has continued writing books, articles, and jokes
about technology and real life ever since.
His 14 (now 15) books include a best-selling series of ﬁve NetWare books for
Sybex, and others on Internet technology, technology business management,
and humor. James presented a series of NetWare and Internet technology
tutorials for Networld+InterOp from 1994 through 1997. Media appearances
include technology expert commentary for KRLD News Radio, Dallas, TX, and
WGBH 89.7, National Public Radio, Boston.
An objective voice for the technology consumer, James writes a weekly column
called Small Business Technology for Network World. He also presents topics such
as The Hilarious Pain of Data Security to groups under the umbrella of
GaskinGuides to Technology. Although unafﬁliated with any vendor, James is
biased toward cost-effective and intelligent technology products for small- and
medium-sized businesses.

Preface
S
peed kills boredom on the Web. Broadband makes Web sites that were
dull yesterday snap and dance today. Now that every person in the United
States and Canada has at least one option for broadband service, there’s no
reason you can’t enjoy a Web more interactive (and intelligent) than any TV
show on the market.
Connecting your home or small business to a broadband service provider costs
less today than ever. The tools you need are easily available, often as close as a
CompUSA or Target or even Radio Shack. Why waste time waiting on the Web?
Why not whip through the Web, grab what you want, and get on with your life?
Nothing in this book is beyond a typical home computer user’s ability to
purchase, install, or enjoy. If you have a computer, you can beneﬁt from
broadband service. If you have two computers, you beneﬁt twice as much. If you
have an ofﬁce at home that you might want to connect to your business,
everything you need is in here.
Jump in. Explore the Internet in ways you couldn’t before. Download videos and
music that you never considered in the past because of their ﬁle sizes. Finally,
turn your computer into something more fun than an automated Solitaire game.
Do all this easily, inexpensively, and without needing to cut a hole in your wall
for wires or worry about security. Follow the directions in here, and you will
connect effortlessly, protect your data in a variety of ways, and stop wondering
if your computer was working for you or against you. With broadband access
and the information in here, you computer will become your transport to more
information and entertainment than ever before.
Who Should Read This Book?
If you have a computer in your home and are curious about broadband, this book
will help you. If you have more than one computer at home and need to connect
them, this book will save you time, money, and a fair amount of aggravation.
If you have a small ofﬁce in your home, this book provides the data security
information that will protect your most important asset, your information.
If you have a small business, this book will show you the right tools for
connecting your computers with network appliances to provide storage,
security, and real-time backup support. You will also build a foundation for your
business on solid network design principles along with important security
considerations that will help today and in the future.

x Preface
What Hardware and Software
Do You Need?
If your computer has a network adapter or can support one of some kind, you
can use it for broadband networking. A few utilities demand Windows of some
ﬂavor (98 or above and sometimes 2000/XP), but after installation any
network-able computer can play on the broadband.
Vendors provide the client software, and the operating systems for client
computers have the rest of the necessary software. If you like graphics, audio, or
video intensive applications, the faster your computer the better.
How This Book Is Organized
Because at least four different ways to receive broadband service at your home
or business are covered in this book, I don’t expect you to read it all straight
through. You’re welcome to, of course, but I certainly understand if you want to
head to the chapters discussing the areas that most excite you.
Broadband comes in a variety of ﬂavors, so ﬁrst I explain all those ﬂavors so you
can see which may suit you the best. Then I go into some detail about how to
share that broadband Internet access throughout your home or ofﬁce.
If you’re a home user with a computer or two who wants to ﬁgure out whether
there’s a difference between cable and DSL for your needs, you will get most of
your information in the ﬁrst half of the book. If your needs include a small
business network, there’s some information for you concerning ways to improve
your network and increase your data security.
Part I: Determining which broadband
is right for you
Part I starts out explaining why broadband access is worth the little bit of money
it costs over dialup Internet access. Then you learn about the various kinds of
broadband services available. Chapter 2 covers how broadband works in
general, and Chapters 3, 4, and 5 cover the mainstream broadband options (cable
or DSL from a telephone company), then the alternative broadband providers
(wireless and satellite). Chapter 6 lists all the pros and cons for each type so you
can answer the questions and learn what you really want for your connection.
Part II: Practicing safe broadband
The Internet is no longer innocent. There was a time when you could leave your
metaphorical doors unlocked, but that day is long past.

Preface xi
Chapter 7 explains how bad people get bad things into your computers, and how
you can stop them. Chapters 8 and 9 talk about how your broadband service is
connected to your home, condo, ofﬁce, or apartment.
Part III: Moving from stand-alone PCs
to a network
Chapter 10 discusses servers and various network devices that help organize
your network and protect your data. Chapters 11, 12, and 13 explain desktop
networking, then TCP/IP (the protocol of the Internet) and router, then backup
and disaster recovery. If you have more than one computer, these chapters will
save you time, money, and grief.
Part IV: Linking your network devices
Chapters 14 and 15 jump in the world of connections, as you learn to tie your
computers together in new ways. Want wires? Fine. Want no wires? That’s ﬁne too.
Chapters 16 and 17 introduce you to the world of wireless security and those
who wish to deprive you of same. Keeping your wireless network private takes
some planning, but it can be done.
Part V: Troubleshooting
Computers are balky, ornery devices at times. Things will not always go smoothly.
But with the information in Chapters 18 and 19, you will learn how to deal with
your broadband service provider when they have problems, and how to deal with
your own network when the problems are on your side of the cable or DSL modem.
Appendix A
This section includes the collected Quick Hits Web site listings for music, video,
games, support, and broadband speed tests. If you wonder if broadband is
worth it, go to some of these sites and see if you get bored waiting for your
browser screen to update. If so, get broadband.
Appendix B
Full of reference sites, this appendix provides more general technical, support,
and security listings than the entertainment-heavy Appendix A. Many of these
sites provided in-depth background and information for chapters in the book.
Appendix C
This appendix is the glossary. Acronyms are explained, and network terms from
all chapters are deﬁned.

his is going to be great fun. I know computers all
too often have the opposite effect on people, but not
this time. You don’t have to be serious at your computer
all day, and probably the best way to have more fun with
your computer is over a fast broadband connection.
But there is more than one way to get broadband to your
computer. You might think you don’t have a choice, but
you do. Everyone in the continental United States has at
least one broadband service provider available. If you live
near a city, you may have a half-dozen broadband service
provider options.
By the time you read this ﬁrst part of the book, you’ll
know your options, and you’ll have gone through
checklists to help you decide which service provider
delivers what you need. Then your new broadband
connection will help you stop frowning when you sit down
at the computer and start grinning.

ack when sneakers were shoes kids wore to play
in rather than $200 foot-borne status symbols,
one company distilled its advantages into the clearest
advertising slogan ever. If you wore its shoes, you could
“run faster and jump higher.” Doesn’t that capture the
dreams of every kid lacing up sneakers?
Broadband makes your computer run faster and jump
higher. Doesn’t that capture your desires every time you
sit down at the keyboard?
To be honest, broadband Internet access doesn’t make
the computer sitting on your desk process bits faster or
start bouncing around. Computer speed ratings are
derived from a set of variables including processor
speed, the amount and type of computer memory, and
the access ratings of your hard disk.
Broadband does, however, make the Internet and World
Wide Web run faster and jump higher for you and your
computer. Web pages appear in a snap rather than at a
snail’s pace. E-mail’s with photos or other images drop
into your inbox rather than drip forever down your
phone line. With broadband, you will ﬁnally realize why
people get excited about Internet radio.
The world of computing will get so much faster, you may
need a seatbelt for your chair. So strap yourself in and
hang on tight.

4 Part I ✦Determining Which Broadband Is Right for You
Computing Without Interruption
A friend of mine helped a taskforce at Texas Instruments (TI) in the mid-1980s to
study the balance between system response time and user productivity. The
taskforce studied mainframe applications, but the idea remains the same. The
study results showed that after a half second, the user’s concentration broke,
and it took mental effort and time to refocus on the task when the system ﬁnally
presented the updated information on the screen.
If you’re the same type of person TI studied nearly 20 years ago, after a half
second of waiting for a Web page to update, you probably lose patience and your
train of thought. The way everything in life has sped up during the last 20 years,
the time now could be less than a half second.
Involved computing sessions demand that screens change as fast as possible. If
they take longer than half a second, as far as your train of thought being
disrupted they can be 4 seconds or 2 minutes. But life on the computer really
runs faster and jumps higher when screens update in a half second or less.
Typical Web Page Download Speeds
An interesting note from broadband provider NTL.com in England shows how long
it takes to download a typical Web page (50 Kbps in the example). Here’s how
they break it down:
✦56 Kbps modem: 7.9 seconds
✦128 Kbps broadband: 3.5 seconds
✦600 Kbps broadband: 0.7 seconds
✦1024 Kbps broadband: 0.4 seconds
Nice dovetail with our TI study conclusions, isn’t it? If you get broadband download
speeds of at least 1 Mbps, most pages update in less than a half second.
Now you can justify the cost of broadband to your spouse by saying that faster
speeds mean fewer breaks in concentration, which means you’ll ﬁnish on the
computer faster than ever before. (Let me know if your spouse falls for that
rationalization.)
Support ﬁles download in a ﬂash
Nothing interrupts your time on the computer more than a pop-up window
demanding you stop what you’re doing to download a ﬁle, update, virus
deﬁnition, or browser plug-in. Windows users see these computing roadblocks
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 1 ✦Why You Need Broadband Internet Access 5
constantly, but Microsoft can’t be blamed for all the interruptions. Here’s a quick
list of interruption requests on my systems recently:
✦Windows automatic update ﬁles (okay, I can blame Microsoft for this
one)
✦QuickTime browser plug-in update (from Apple for equal time)
✦Mozilla plug-in update for Macromedia Flash Player
✦Real Player update
✦Norton virus deﬁnition ﬁles
Each interruption demands that you stop and download a ﬁle or ﬁles.
Sometimes, for example with a browser plug-in, it takes just a minute or two.
With Microsoft and other operating system ﬁles, it can take hours to download a
weekly update package. The same can happen if you download an update to
your browser or one of your multimedia players.
I get more aggravated by the 3-minute interruption and download than the
half-hour ones. When you know it will be 30 minutes, you can start the download
and go do something else. You can take advantage of being forced from your seat
at the computer by wandering around for a few minutes and grabbing a snack.
But when I’m searching for something on the Web and one of those ﬁle download
boxes appears and makes me slam to a stop, I curse and glare at the monitor
until I can escape from the trap and go back to my search.
With broadband, however, the downloads arrive in a fraction of the time that
they do with a dial-up connection. What used to be a 3-minute distraction is now
a 30-second annoyance.
Of course, when downloads, such as patches for your operating system estimate
they will take 30 minutes to download over a dial-up line, the broadband user
can laugh. Table 1-1 lists ﬁle download times, and you can see that downloading
a ﬁle that takes 30 minutes to dribble down a dial-up line takes 5 minutes over a
broadband connection.
Vendors now like you to download a small (under 1MB) ﬁle that triggers an
update download of the other 99MBs or whatever. The ﬁrst time or two I got
fooled by this it really steamed me. I downloaded the 1MB ﬁle and installed that,
only to see the newly installed application begin the real work of downloading
for what seemed like 24 hours. With broadband, I get up and start looking for a
snack because the download and installation will probably take 15–20 minutes.
With dialup, my computer is hosed for the evening and I want to threaten the
computer with a baseball bat.
As more companies move toward constant updates for security and operating
system patches, these interruptions will increase. Vendors want users to get
broadband service because it makes it easier on them and because they can
keep stufﬁng those large updates down the pipe to users.

If you get one of those annoying “download this update now” windows when you
have broadband, it’s no big deal. It will never be pleasant, but with broadband
the aggravation speeds by quickly.
Applications arrive in a blink
Patches and updates arrive on their schedule and not yours, but the
applications you ﬁnd and download also take time. Waiting for a ﬁle you want,
such as a new spam ﬁlter or digital music player, can be as frustrating as waiting
for a complete virus deﬁnition ﬁle.
Unlike patch and upgrade vendors, developers offering ﬁles for download want
your download experience to be quick and painless. Files are often zipped
(compressed) to save time during downloading. You may not even know when
you receive a compressed ﬁle because it will often have an .exe extension and
decompress itself automatically when you install it.
Searching for handy utilities, such as those shown in Figure 1-1, changes from
burden to delight when ﬁles download quickly. In fact, broadband connections
download ﬁles so fast that most of the time you don’t have to save the ﬁle and
run it later because you can download and install at the same time.
Figure 1-1: DownLoad.com is one source for new applications that you can
download quickly over broadband.
Table 1-1 contrasts download times for large ﬁles using broadband and dial-up
connections.

Do not take these numbers as absolutes or performance guarantees. Many
variables across the Internet inﬂuence download times, just like congested
roads inﬂuence drive times (yes, the Internet has rush hours). This table
shows estimates based on real-world tests done by the nice folks at NTL.com
in the United Kingdom. But now you see where broadband marketing
companies get their justiﬁcation for touting broadband as being up to
20 times faster than regular dialup, don’t you?
The application vendors really, really want to persuade customers to
download their programs rather than look for boxes on the store shelves.
Offering applications online is much cheaper for the vendors because they
don’t need to pay for packaging and shipping, and they cut the retailer out of
the equation to save even more money. The vendors say the move provides
fresher programs that include the latest ﬁxes and updates. You will soon get
almost all your programs via the Internet. Transfer speeds and reliability
become even more important when you’re downloading a 150MB ofﬁce
suite.
How I Will Write Speeds
Different people use different acronyms for speeds, and it can get confusing. Just
when you think you have it right, a typo will mess you up.
Here’s what I will use:
✦Kbps: Kilobits per second.
✦KBps: Kilobytes per second
(K for Kilo isn’t an even 1,000. it’s 1,024 because that’s what you get from 2 to
the power of 10.)
✦Mbps: Megabits per second
✦MBps: Megabytes per second
(M for Mega isn’t an even 1,000,000, but rather 1,048,576 because that’s what
you get from 2 to the power of 20.)

Know how you almost never use your ﬂoppy drive for anything anymore? Before
long, you may use your CD-ROM drive to play music CDs rather than load new
applications. That means downloading rather than installing off a local drive,
and that means you need faster downloading.
Immersive Experiences
Computing without interruption enables you to get more work done. The next
step, for relaxation, is to immerse yourself in some type of entertainment.
Watching a movie in a modern theater moves beyond the uninterrupted
experience into an immersive experience. Sounds come from all around you. The
screen takes up most of your ﬁeld of sight. Darkness diminishes distractions
from other audience members. When someone in the audience gets and takes a
cell phone call, the movie world is destroyed and you are dropped back into the
modern world where fools and their phones are never parted.
Broadband access transforms using your computer into something at least
closer to an immersive experience, even though you can’t duplicate a theater.
The screen ﬁlls most of your vision. Lower prices make a surround speaker
system affordable. And you control whether every cell phone in the area is on
or off.
Modem fans may take exception to this. Wait, they cry, can’t you do everything
listed in the previous paragraph over dialup? Yes and no. You can get the
surround sound speakers, lean close to the monitor, and turn off your cell phone.
What you can’t do, however, is maintain your immersive entertainment world
when the video jerks, stutters, and stops. You can’t immerse yourself in music
recorded at painfully low quality to enable transmission at dial-up speeds. You
can’t convince yourself that ground steak with ketchup is a ﬁlet mignon with
b´earnaise sauce.
Beyond entertainment, informational and educational programs take advantage
of computer-based video regularly. Although a short video clip illustrating snake
locomotion would be better on a big screen TV, it provides more valuable
information moving on the computer screen than just a static picture.
Broadband performance can change your computer from something to work on
to a speedy research assistant, from a maker of odd noises to a high-end music
entertainment center, and from a displayer of still pictures to a streaming video
treasure chest. Let me give you some examples.
Streaming audio
Today, ﬁnding and listening to interesting music outside the mainstream has
become a do-it-yourself project. If you live in a rural area, you have few radio
stations to choose from. If you live in or near a major city, you have more

stations but not more choices because corporate radio conglomerates now own
multiple stations in every metropolitan area. One owner and one program
manager means mainstream radio plays the same few tunes over and over.
Internet radio and online music sites will change your world if you’re a music
fanatic. If you just like music, you’ll ﬁnd more sources for more tunes from more
groups than you’ll ever hear on radio. In fact, depending on your music
preferences, you’ll ﬁnd more music online than you’ll ﬁnd in the largest music
store in the largest cities. BeSonic, shown in Figure 1-2, will thrill music fans and
particularly fans of European musicians.
Figure 1-2: One of my favorite Internet music tools for ﬁnding new groups.
Before I talk about some of the Web sites you should visit to explore the world of
music outside corporate mainstream control, let me give you an idea of what will
appear in the next year or two. Computers will drive the audio entertainment for
many households. This will occur whether you get a broadband connection or
not, but it will be much more fun if you have the fast Internet connection
broadband provides.
Consumer product companies (think Sony, Motorola, Phillips, and the like) now
race to include computers inside their equipment. Computer companies (think
Dell, HP, and Gateway) now race to include consumer products in their catalogs,
all of which connect to their computers. Which side will win? I bet those
consumers interested in linking the Internet into their stereo systems will win

ﬁrst; then the beneﬁts will slow down for a couple of years until broadband
speeds make downloaded video streams (as in movies) worthwhile. Although
video fans have a strong push underway to liberate the TiVO and make it a
broadband downloading tool rather than a second generation VCR. That will be
interesting to come home to a downloaded movie you ordered from work via a
Web site and had it sent to your home.
Before that happens, however, Hollywood will aggravate almost as many people
as the music industry has by trying ill-considered security measures to keep
honest people from enjoying their movies although doing nothing to stop
large-scale pirating operations. For the next couple of years, spend your money
and attention on the constantly improving world of streaming audio, and you’ll
have plenty of fun.
Lamented Music Site: RIP, MP3.com
The most popular Web music site for 4 years, MP3.com deserves a word of thanks
and a lament for its passing. No site did as much for unknown bands than MP3.com
did. I found many bands playing my favorite type of pop music (ska/punk bands
with horns) by listening to play lists assembled by music fans and posted on
MP3.com. Imagine good friends sitting you down and going through their favorite
cuts of their favorite CDs, and you have the idea.
In 2001, Vivendi Universal, one of the world’s major record companies, bought
MP3.com. Fans worried, but the independent music stayed online. Mainstream
artists from Vivendi and their partners blanketed the front page and much of the
interior advertising, but you could still ﬁnd great songs, for example: the funniest
rock song I’ve ever heard, “A Slut Named Rachel,” from Skasmopolitan.
At the end of 2003, however, Vivendi sold MP3.com to CNET.com to use in some fu-
ture music venture. The pleadings of fans worldwide fell on deaf ears as CNET.com
shut down MP3.com and took all music ofﬂine despite the offer of several other
Web sites ready to host the music ﬁles. A sad day indeed.
Quick hit: Example sites
Listing every streaming audio site on the Internet would take the rest of the book,
and I would still miss some. Here are a few places to go to get started in your
search for new and interesting music, or, if you prefer, old and interesting music.
Although GarageBand.com doesn’t generate the most trafﬁc of all music sites, I
show it in Figure 1-3 because of Apple Computer. Apple released a new music
software package in early 2004 called Garageband and I doubt they worried
about overlapping the established Web site of the same name. The two have
nothing to do with each other except the name confusion.

Figure 1-3: One of the best sites to ﬁnd new groups and their music.
GarageBand.com does a good job showing the most popular tracks in each main
genre with its Charts pages. For many songs, you can download an MP3 ﬁle for
personal use. GarageBand also makes it easy to ﬁnd CDs for sale by groups; it
shows whether they have live gigs planned (although those don’t seem to be up
to date), and you can leave messages for the artist or group. The site also helps
you ﬁnd groups that sound like another band.
Music File Formats
Here’s a quick rundown of the most common music ﬁle formats. The format type
is usually indicated by the ﬁle extension.
✦.wav: Music ﬁle format developed by Microsoft and IBM. Since Windows
95, Microsoft made .wav ﬁles the standard for all PC sounds. But the high
ﬁdelity ﬁle format requires nearly 10MBs per minute of music.
✦.aiff: Audio Interchange File Format, the Apple Macintosh version of .wav
ﬁles, including the high ﬁdelity and large ﬁle size.
✦.mp3: mp3 is short for MPEG version 3, from the Motion Picture Experts
Group. MP3 is the third generation of a compressed ﬁle format that requires
about 1MB per minute of music at nearly the same ﬁdelity as WAV ﬁles.

✦Ogg Vorbis: An open source, royalty free ﬁle format similar to MP3 but
not as popular for downloadable music ﬁles.
✦.wma: Windows Media Audio ﬁle format, the default to Windows Media
Player. Often used by music services because of embedded digital rights
controls in the ﬁle format.
www.SoundClick.com
Perhaps the most popular of the music sites after the unfortunate demise of
MP3.com, SoundClick appears to be chasing that market full tilt. They promise
to create play lists so people can string together their favorite tunes, like
MP3.com did, and they now show the number of plays a tune has gotten.
www.CDBaby.com
Built by a working musician trying to market his own music, CD Baby now
showcases nearly 55,000 CDs, all straight from the artists. You can listen to
tracks CDs, search genres you like, and crank up your PC speakers.
www.IUMA.com
The Internet Underground Music Archive (IUMA) started in 1993 and was one of
the ﬁrst music sites on the infant WWW. It includes a streaming radio station and
offers multiple tracks from every artist. It offers free MP3 downloads, streams in
MP3 or Real formats, links to CD sales and the like.
www.VitaminiC.com
Connected to IUMA, VitaminiC offers much more international exposure and
song protection by using Windows Media format ﬁles.
www.Ampcast.com
Another artist-oriented site, Ampcast started in 1998 and already includes
play lists for gathering your favorites together. The site streams plenty of
tracks, provides downloads, and sells CDs directly to you or recommends other
sites.
www.AcidPlanet.com
One of many sites sponsored by music tool vendors, this Sony-owned site
showcases artists using their products. In this case, Sony now owns Acid Pro
and Sound Forge, among others, and the music posted has almost all been
created or modiﬁed by Acid Pro or Sound Forge software.

Not just another music product vendor, BeSonic offers a ton of European groups.
(TerraTec is a German company.) Its excellent Mood Radio page, shown in
Figure 1-2, is at the beginning of this section. The site also provides a visually
cool artists “cube” to help locate groups playing the type of music you want.
Many artists provide a play list of their favorite BeSonic artists, offering another
way to get some interesting connections to different artists.
www.ArtistLaunch.com
This site is pretty self-explanatory, but adds some nice touches with a CD
catalog that lists CDs for sale by genre. The graphics are large enough so you can
actually see the CD cover, an unusual idea for many sites.
www.DMusic.com
This artist promotion site provides an icon beside its songs so you can send a
friend a link to that song. Clever marketing.
Streaming radio Web sites
Internet radio stations may be the only place left to hear interesting new music.
Small groups who self-publish their own CDs or sign with one of the many small
labels need distribution to reach new ears, and corporate-owned radio certainly
won’t give it to them. Next time you complain when hearing the pop vixen de
jour again and again during the day, look to the Internet.
When I searched Google.com for “streaming radio stations,” I received 2,810
listings. Internet radio stations come and go, so there’s no guarantee which of
the 2,810 stations will be up and running if you check them out.
However, here are a few you should give an ear to as you start your own journey:

Streaming video
Obviously you need enough bandwidth to stream the video fast enough to keep
your display going at full speed. Your computer, whether running an operating
www.it-ebooks.info

14 Part I ✦Determining Which Broadband Is Right for You
system from Microsoft (Windows), Apple (OS X), or Linux needs certain
minimum requirements to support streaming video. These aren’t absolutes, but
good guidelines.
Streaming video over the Internet suffers terribly when compared to the
streaming video appliance everyone watches for several hours per day: the TV.
Just about every major corporate content provider (TV networks, movie
studios, music video producers, and infomercial hucksters) wants to make the
Internet, and your computer, a broadcast receiver much like a television.
The world doesn’t really need a new form of TV. And sitting at my desk watching
a video window of maybe 4.5 inches wide by 2.5 inches high when a 37-inch
Toshiba TV sits in the next room strikes me as stupid. So I hope the corporate
content providers don’t manage to turn the Web into more TV stations.
But the race for eyeballs will not stop for me or you. Look for new products over
the next 3 years to link your computer, your broadband connection, and your
HDTV set-top box. Look for appliances that act as the go-betweens for your
wireless home network and your HDTV, including storing video streams for later
viewing. I wonder what the TiVO developers are really up to?
The many geniuses, artists, humorists, and just plain nuts on the Internet
provide enough videos to keep a person mesmerized for years. Any users with a
few dollars a month for a hosting service can offer their own videos to the world.
Be glad they do, because you’ll see some things online you’ll never see on TV,
even if you have full access cable or satellite.
An example of all that’s good and bad about corporate content providers is AOL.
AOL broadband puts streaming video right up front for users. (Its streaming
audio includes a wide range of interesting artists in 175 CD-quality radio stations
as well.) Advertisements abound, of course, but music videos and movie trailers
work well through AOL when you have a broadband connection. Using AOL
broadband also allows multiple members of your family to be online at the same
time. You can enforce parental guidelines that restrict your children’s access to
mature sites as long as you ensure that your children surf the Web through AOL
rather than with Internet Explorer or another browser.
The faster your CPU and the larger your memory, the better. A faster hard disk
always beats a slower one. Most computers built since 1998 include an Ethernet
networking connection that supports 100 Mbps, so you’ll be ﬁne there.
Speciﬁcation minimums are shown in the following list:
Chapter 11 covers networking in depth.
✦CPU: Intel Pentium III or AMD Athlon (faster is better)
✦RAM: 128MB (more is better)
(The information about the previous two items can be found by clicking Control
Panel ➪System.)
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 1 ✦Why You Need Broadband Internet Access 15
✦Video: 800 × 600, at least 16-bit depth (more is better)
✦Sound: Two powered speakers (the ones that came with your PC aren’t
worth much)
✦Broadband: At least 200 Kbps (faster is better)
Of course, the fastest new computer in the world won’t give you decent
streaming video if you use a dial-up connection. Broadband service on an older
computer beats the streaming audio and video performance of a newer
computer without broadband every time.
Many of the Web sites offering streaming video give warnings about mature
themes. Although the short ﬁlms usually equate to a movie rated R, some may
go further, so keep an eye on your children. Some sites with movies go much,
much further.
Yes, there are adult movies and pictures on the Internet. In Part III, I’ll explain
how to control who in your home or ofﬁce sees what, and what the legal
ramiﬁcations are for business owners who provide Internet access to their
employees but don’t monitor those same employees when they pipe
“entertainment” videos into the company network.
If you become a big fan of streaming videos on your computer, you might look
for one more accessory to enhance your enjoyment. Go to the bookstore and get
one of those full-page magnifying sheets or at least a big magnifying glass. You’ll
get tired of leaning toward the screen and squinting, I promise.
Quick hit: Example sites
There may be more streaming video sites than streaming radio stations, believe
it or not. But the number includes hundreds or thousands of sites using
streaming video to teach you something. Remote education often includes
streaming video, and there are educational sites for every career or hobby you
can imagine. Figure 1-4 shows the AOL 9.0 Enhanced video section.
In Figure 1-4, I mixed education (a National Geographic clip about volcanoes)
with entertainment (AOL). Few people consider AOL an educational site,
although I used it with my children to take advantage of its parental controls.
Hiding Internet Explorer and forcing the kids to use AOL made it possible for me
to relax when they were on the Internet.
I’m not sure how AOL does it, but the same music videos look better through
AOL than on MTV.com. Perhaps there is something to all AOLs talk about
broadband. And the extra speed makes it easier for my teenaged daughter to
keep a dozen IM windows open while playing Solitaire, watching TV, and talking
on the phone.

All major network television Web sites
ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, and even Fox offer plenty of streaming videos, although
most are from the TV rerun closet. The news sides of the major networks often
include video from other parts of the world not shown on network television
often.

Communicating Over Broadband
This may seem an odd heading, because broadband is all about sending
information. But information isn’t always communication, and when I think
“communication” I think of a two-way conversation. Many of the broadband sites
listed in the previous section are as two-way as radio and TV.
Some people believe the power of broadband, that of fast communications
across the public network, should be more than just “they broadcast and we
watch.” The beauty of getting a fast Internet connection is that it frees you to do
all sorts of things you couldn’t do before.
Here we hit upon one of the disruptive technologies you hear about sometimes,
when a new technology disrupts established businesses and no one saw it
coming. In the past, voice was analog and data was digital. The two didn’t mix.
But that was the old world, when all telephones had wires attached and all music
played from vinyl records. (Kids, ask your parents to show you a record.)
Voice over broadband
Today, voice conversations can be turned into data streams, just like music can
be turned into digital data on a CD. The process works much like capturing
music for the CD, in fact, because the sounds of the voice are captured, sampled
by the new Internet Protocol (IP) phone, and sent onto the network as digital
data. On the receiving end, the digital data packets are converted from bits back
into sound, just like your CD player does for the music it carries.
The technical term for all this is Voice over IP and the shorthand is VoIP. You
pronounce it just as funny as it looks: vo-eep.
Here’s where things get all tangled up. As I’ll explain in Chapter 3, there
are two primary types of broadband services: over telephone lines owned
and controlled by the telephone companies, and over cable lines owned
and controlled by the cable companies. There are other broadband ser-
vice options, but they don’t get into the VoIP world yet.

Chapter 1 ✦Why You Need Broadband Internet Access 19
If you’re the cable company, adding VoIP services gives you a wonderful new
feature to sell. Data networking companies like VoIP as well. since it gives them a
wonderful new feature to sell.
Guess who doesn’t like VoIP? The telephone companies. Does VoIP give them a
new product? No, it replaces their most important product. The great value in
Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), the broadband product sold by the telephone
companies, is that it runs over existing telephone wires. The telephone
companies want customers to keep using telephone services running over
telephone lines, not to replace them by running VoIP over cable.
In the long term, VoIP will become more important and more common. The
underlying network technology supporting VoIP makes it much cheaper to carry
voice conversations across data networks than across a pair of telephone wires.
VoIP quality goes up with each new product, and large companies save millions
of dollars by replacing dedicated telephone circuits with VoIP over data
networks for internal calls. One data network connection can carry as many
telephone conversations as a hundred pair of telephone wires, and the tools
used to manage the data network also manage telephone calls running over
those data networks.
The telephone companies, especially the large national carriers with huge
investments in data networks as well as telephone systems, are joining the VoIP
bandwagon. If you can’t beat ’em, join ’em, and it’s better for the telephone
companies to keep their customers than it is for them to keep protecting their
investment in telephone wires.
Individuals and small businesses now have options to buy VoIP telephones and
bypass the telephone companies if they believe the marketing from the cable
companies. Quality keeps going up and the cost keeps going down.
Most small businesses won’t get into VoIP for another year or two. The greatest
value so far is for large companies where the majority of long-distance calling
costs are generated by calls from one employee to another employee. Using
VoIP over existing data networks allows such companies to avoid the long
distance charges from their telecom providers and justify the new VoIP
equipment.
Webcams
News ﬂash: Webcams can be pointed at more than just friendly college girls
asking for your credit card number. Some of the earliest Web entrepreneurs
made a fortune with a cheap camera and a marketing list of voyeurs hiding
behind their monitors. The prurient news value of those webcams
overshadowed all the other ways people used a remote eye.
A few years ago, I interviewed the network manager of a check-cashing service
with branches across several states. This smart guy put a webcam in every check
cashing ofﬁce. Whenever a security alarm went off in any ofﬁce, he checked the
webcam before calling the police. It saved him a bundle in false alarm charges.

If I remember correctly, the ﬁrst networked webcam watched a coffee
pot in a university in England. People got tired of walking upstairs to ﬁnd
an empty pot, so they rigged the camera.
Some daycare providers advertise the placement of webcams in every
classroom. Parents use these cameras to check on their children during the day.
Figure 1-5 shows a playpen of a different sort.

Check your local TV station’s news Web site and check out their trafﬁc and
weather webcams. If your local station doesn’t have a good one, check out the
thousands of options at www.earthcam.com/.
Anywhere you have electrical power, you can have a webcam. Every security
camera you see is a webcam, but not viewable by the public. Every trafﬁc
monitoring camera you see watching your downtown streets is a webcam, but
again not open to the public.
Prices for webcams are down to, well, free in some cases. I’ve seen major stores
offer no-name webcams for $25 with a $25 rebate, which is pretty close to free.
Videophones and video IM
First shown to the public at the World’s Fair in 1964, videophones captured the
public’s imagination (and funny faces) from the beginning. Long a staple of every

futuristic movie and television show, videophones have yet to fulﬁll even a small
portion of their exciting promise.
But once again, the availability of broadband will make videophones work much
better because their big problem in the past has been the limited bandwidth
over telephone lines. The only way to make a videophone at all was to keep the
picture small and the frame rate low, which made no one happy.
Large companies started buying videophones and videoconferencing equipment
years ago to help cut down travel costs. But the costs were high, special network
protocols had to be supported, and only the executives got to play with them.
Those days when only the rich could afford small, jerky images of the person on
the other end of the phone line are gone. Now normal folks can afford
videophones and systems that offer better images than all but the most
expensive equipment a few years ago.
Unlike most competing products, the D-Link i2eye DVC-1100 hooks to your
television via standard video cables and connects to your computer wirelessly.
This makes sense to me. If you want more than one person to be involved on
each end, the TV offers a much better gathering point than a personal computer
(especially if your desk looks like mine).
Prices for electronics like this are tricky to put in a book because prices change
much faster than a book gets reprinted. But the unit shown in Figure 1-6 from

D-Link.com, one of the cost-leaders on the low end, priced this unit not much
more than a video game console. For the ﬁrst time, a usable videoconferencing
product (I call it more than a videophone because several people can use it)
costs far less than the computer it uses.

Broadband Gaming
I remember Pong with great fondness. Two lines and a blip ate many of my
quarters. Comparing Pong to modern games gives me the same feeling of
amazement as looking at the ﬁrst Volkswagen Beetle and a new Ferrari. Yes,
they’re the same thing, more or less, but they’re a long, long way apart.
Today I no longer need to stand next to my gaming partner, each of us holding
the knob on the Pong arcade game unit, to have a shared game experience.
Today I can sit at home and be mercilessly slaughtered by a trigger-happy
10-year-old in Cleveland over the Internet.
If you are a gamer, or are the long-suffering parent of a gamer, you are familiar
with the excitement and addiction awaiting those new to the world of modern
gaming. Gamers push the boundaries of computer technology constantly and
buy the newest, fastest, and most expensive hardware on the market. In a time
where a complete corporate workstation costs less than $2,000, gamers might
spend $3,000 and more on their systems.
Gamers love broadband connections for two primary reasons. First,
downloading takes a fraction of the time it takes with a dial-up connection.
Gamers download new games, new modules for older games, and demos of
upcoming games constantly. Second, a faster network connection means faster
interactive game playing online.
If you have a child gamer and you have broadband, you’ll always know where he
(perhaps a stereotype, but the gamer is usually male) is. He will be at home,
playing over the Internet.
Game play requirements
Besides the most expensive PC systems on the market, what do game players
need? More speed, always more speed. Latency, the technical term for the time
lag between when a command is given and the results take effect, is the enemy of
gamers everywhere.
The Internet, as you will learn later, consists of networks linked to networks
linked to networks. It is, technically, a network of networks.

24 Part I ✦Determining Which Broadband Is Right for You
Every connection between networks is a potential bottleneck. The good thing
about broadband service providers is that they tend to be the large companies
and their customer networks have direct connections to other large customer
networks. The Internet backbone is the highest level of network where all the
largest networks connect.
Some service providers offer a special package for game players. This includes
an extra IP network address so gamers can be online playing without blocking
another family member on another computer from an Internet connection. This
type of arrangement used to be special, but now many service providers
automatically provide a network router for connecting more than one computer
in the home or ofﬁce to the Internet. But check with your service provider to
ensure it supports a game console connection if that’s the platform of choice for
your gamer.
Using a network router between your computer and the modem provided by the
service provider offers a great troubleshooting option: resetting the cable/DSL
modem. When the going gets gummy, resetting the broadband modem (unplug
it, wait for 60 seconds, then plug it in again) forces a new connection. Just like a
telephone call sometimes has static, a network connection can get the digital
equivalent of static. Resetting the broadband modem helps clear that problem,
making a separate broadband modem an important piece of gear for gamers.
More detailed information on game-speciﬁc conﬁguration of routers, ﬁre-
walls, and proxies await you in Chapter 11. If you don’t know what
routers, ﬁrewalls, or proxies are, but fear you need them, don’t worry, I’ve
got your back.
Wrapping yourself in the game world
Few technologies are more engrossing and exclusionary than a good game.
When I ﬁrst saw the groundbreaking Wolfenstein 3D in 1992, the parts that
scared me the most were the sound effects. The large steel doors that opened
and closed in Castle Wolfenstein echoed with a surround sound that made it
sound like they were opening behind me. That they managed that effect with the
cheap PC soundcards and speakers at the time still surprises me.
Gamers spend hundreds of dollars on video cards to replace the ones you and I
happily use, in order to get the highest resolution and the fastest screen-drawing
times. Check out some of the game sites listed in the next section, and you will
be amazed at the realism and depth of the game environment. You don’t have to
sign up for a paid service just to view screenshots and movies taken from actual
game play, and those will be enough to show you that game effects now equal
movie special effects.
Developers work with hardware designers to try and get physical impact into
games. Even inexpensive handheld controllers vibrate to warn the players. Over
the years, companies sold packs to strap on the players’ backs with speakers
inside to shake them up and special chairs with surround sound and quaking
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 1 ✦Why You Need Broadband Internet Access 25
cushions to reﬂect driving over rough ground. These expensive options don’t
tend to stay on the market for long, but new ones always appear.
Parents who are afraid that their gamer children exercise only their thumbs may
check into some of the new interactive game additions. A few companies are
selling cameras that mount on the TV and capture physical player movements
and translate those into character moves in the game. Let your child physically
ﬂail around ﬁghting some demons and they’ll get into shape again. Somehow, I
doubt the chance for physical workout will attract too many gamers.
For me, ever since the ﬁrst time I saw (and heard those steel doors in Castle
Wolfenstein), sound provides the best immersion tool. Broadband offers higher
quality music than dialup by a considerable margin. The difference in music is
about the same as the difference between a cheap AM transistor radio and a
modern FM home stereo.
Get a better sound card, and get better speakers. You can spend as much on
surround-sound speakers for your computer as you can for your home theater.
Although I don’t advocate that outlay, moving up to a ﬁve-speaker system for at
least $100 will make a huge sonic difference. Even the game consoles like
PlayStation and X-Box support surround-sound speaker systems.
Are games intruding into everyday life? Radio@AOL has a channel with nothing
but the music from the Final Fantasy game series. Even when gamers can’t play,
they can keep their ears in the game.
The most popular games
Warning, if you’re new to the gaming world, popular online games take money.
You must subscribe to play. And you thought only pornography made money on
the Internet.
The choice of broadband type and other connection details will have no effect
on your choice of games. Gamers play certain games for a variety of reasons,
some of them innocent and some no doubt based in horrible neuroses foisted
upon them by bad parenting. When your kids tell you that, explain to them all
the violence in the game world has rotted their brains and they need to take up
tennis to get fresh air and exercise. Don’t let them tell you Topspin on the X-Box
is the same as real tennis.
Your gamer will, when you hook up to broadband, begin playing multiplayer
games across the Internet. These go by a variety of acronyms made from some
set of the words Massive Online Player Universe and the like. Entire worlds
exist for the big games, including people, places, weapons, and monsters never
seen in real life (thank goodness, if you’ve seen some of those weapons and
monsters).
There are too many games to list them all. Understand that even a relatively
unpopular game may have a hundred thousand fans playing the game online
now and then.

You know you want more from your computer. You know you want more from
the Internet and Web. You know you want broadband, you just have to make that

As I’ll explain in this book, broadband is no longer outrageously expensive, and
it’s no longer a technical nightmare. Cheap and easy may be going a little too far,
but that’s the trend.
Besides, your computer will be much more fun on broadband than on dial-up
connection. And don’t you deserve some more fun in your life?

fter reading the advantages of speedier Internet
connections in the ﬁrst chapter, you know that
you really do want broadband—even if you’re not
completely sure what broadband means. You want to get
more from the Internet and World Wide Web more
quickly than you do now. Broadband gives you what you
want. This chapter and the next two will eliminate the
mysteries of broadband and help you justify getting the
service.
No matter how fast your computer is, you want that
computer to go faster. Fact of life, this urge, and an
excellent example of modern man’s inability to be
satisﬁed with the status quo. You are perfectly normal if
you want your computer experience to run faster and
jump higher. In fact, people would only call you weird if
you said your computer is too fast and you yearn for the
old days when your 2,400 baud modem connected you
to the world.
You want images to arrive before your ﬁnger leaves the
mouse. You want music to start before you can think of
what the song sounds like after you click the title. You
need broadband. In this chapter, I deﬁne broadband
technology and help you get a handle on how it works.
What Is Broadband?
You want an “ofﬁcial” deﬁnition of broadband? Good
luck.
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
28 Part I ✦Determining Which Broadband Is Right for You
Try this deﬁnition from Webopedia.com:
A type of data transmission in which a single medium (wire) can
carry several channels at once. Cable TV, for example, uses
broadband transmission.
More technically, broadband is a transmission facility having the bandwidth to
carry multiple data, voice, and video channels all at once. Each of the individual
channels is transmitted on a different frequency through the transmission
medium (usually a wire of some type) and selected at the receiving end (such as
your cable TV box). Emtpy space in the frequency range between channels
ensures channels don’t interfere with each other.
Digging deeper, let’s call bandwidth the amount of data that can be sent or
received in a set amount of time. Bandwidth exists as a range within a set of
frequencies (for radio) or wavelengths (for light created by lasers).
Computers and other digital devices express bandwidth as bits per second (bps)
most often, but sometimes they use Bytes per second (Bps). There are eight bits
in a byte, so when you compare speeds make sure you check whether the ratings
use Bps or bps. Marketing often decides which rating to use, so be careful.
Think computer people don’t have a sense of humor? Four bits, (half a
byte) is called a nibble. Really.
Let me try and explain analog and digital, two terms with speciﬁc technical
meanings that are often misused. Analog refers to something continuous and is
normally represented in a form that emphasized a range of settings. Think of a
radio volume knob, hands on a watch, or a singing voice. Those all exemplify a
set of points, such as volume settings, but also include all the points in between,
such as the space between volume setting 5 and 6.
Digital refers to distinct measurements of values but not the steps in between. If
there are only two steps, such as a computer chip with transistors able to be
switched either off (0) or on (1), digital is easy to spot. Less well-deﬁned
examples of digital include items such as a radio with volume buttons for louder
or a software that shows a digital display (1-11 for instance) of the volume,
unlike the volume knob. On a piano, you can play C or C# but not the notes in
between. Singers, being analog, can include all the different sounds from C on
the way to C# (whether you and I want to hear them or not).
When talking about analog, such as voice and electricity, people talk about
bandwidth in cycles per second, or Hertz (Hz). This can get confusing, however,
because CPU speeds are expressed in Hertz (such as 2.4 GHz Pentium 4 chips)
even though most of us would call a computer chip digital rather than analog. So
you say 3.1415 GHz as “three point one four one ﬁve gigahertz.” When you see
Hertz expressed in high speeds, such as MHz (MegaHertz) or GHz, the reference
usually applies to modern digital technologies such as computer chip or
wireless networking speeds.
Taking the path of least resistance, let me quote Webster’s deﬁnition of
broadband: operating with uniform efﬁciency over a wide band of frequencies. If all
this talk of frequencies makes you think of radios, you’re on target.

What the Feds Call Broadband
The U.S. Government, or at least the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC), at www.fcc.gov uses this deﬁnition of broadband:
Broadband services are those that support bidirectional data
transmissions of at least 200K bit/sec.
Put bluntly, if broadband is nothing more than the FCC deﬁnition, it’s pretty
lame. After all, the FCCs idea of broadband is only four times faster than the
standard 56 Kbps modem you can buy for about $20. The broadband most of us
can get today, at least in the United States, follows this Fed deﬁnition and is
therefore pretty lame (like a lame leg that keeps you from running fast).
Don’t believe me? How about believing some of the 300 members of the lobbying
and advisory group called the Technology Network (www.technet.org/).
Called TechNet for short, this group includes senior executives from many of the
corporations providing broadband products, services, and network building
blocks.
The TechNet group, including many of the largest companies in American
technology, want to inﬂuence the FCC to change some of its rules. Check up on
the rules yourself at FCC.gov, shown in Figure 2-1. It shouldn’t surprise you that
many of the TechNet recommendations mean new business opportunities for
TechNet members, but the changes will also spread faster networks across all
parts of the United States.

30 Part I ✦Determining Which Broadband Is Right for You
Craig Barrett, CEO of Intel, gave a keynote speech at the SuperComm convention
of telecomm industry players on June 4, 2002. In that speech, he disagreed with
the FCC deﬁnition of broadband and said this:
“300 Kbps or 400 Kbps is not real broadband. When you get to ﬁve or
10 meg, going up to one hundred, that’s real broadband.”
Why did Barrett dis the FCC? He prefaced those remarks by saying, “I get to
travel around the world and see what real broadband content looks like
compared to some of the things we try to pass off for broadband in the United
States.” He knows real broadband, real broadband is a friend of his, and he just
told the FCC they aren’t real broadband.
TechNet called for a National Broadband Policy back at the beginning of 2002.
What do they want? 100 Mpbs to 100 million homes and small businesses by the
end of the decade. That, friends, is real broadband.
In fact, TechNet calls for the same national push to get to 100/100 by 2010 that
was used to put a man on the moon. They say that for America to stay
competitive, educate the workforce, and increase productivity, you must have
ubiquitous broadband.
Perhaps I’d feel better about this push by TechNet to improve broadband
if the membership of TechNet included anyone besides executives of
network and technology companies looking to make big bucks from this
push. Any thoughts of adding writers, teachers, musicians, artists, and
members of the public to TechNet? Seems that the push to put a man
on the moon came from the government back in the 1960s, not the
rocket builders and the Astronauts Union.
Groups like TechNet are pushing the FCC into making broadband more of a
priority. Here’s what the FCCs Web site (www.fcc.gov/broadband/) has to say
about its strategic goal for broadband:
Broadband technologies, which encompass all evolving high-speed
digital technologies that provide consumers integrated access to
voice, high-speed data, video-on-demand, and interactive delivery
services, are a fundamental component of the communications
revolution. Fully-evolved broadband will:
✦Virtually eliminate geographic distance as an obstacle to acquiring
information, and
✦Dramatically reduce the time it takes to access information.
All will beneﬁt as broadband’s technologies are developed and
deployed. Nonetheless:
✦The infrastructure is not yet ubiquitous,
✦Relative costs of deployment remain high compared to narrowband,
✦Access is limited in underserved areas, and
✦Adoption rates remain low relative to availability.

The ﬁrst paragraph, and ﬁrst two bullet points, certainly sound good, don’t
they? Reducing the time to access information sounds great because you all
want the screen to update instantly when you press a button or click the mouse.
Not so good are the last four bullet points. This page, when I grabbed these
quotes, was last updated on 3/13/03. This means the information is more than a
year old by the time this book hits the bookshelves. But nothing in the ﬁrst three
wafﬂing bullet points will change soon. But the last note, adoption rates in
relation to availability, are picking up, as you’ll soon see. Amazing what happens
when a technology becomes affordable.
Don’t you love the “gov-speak” in the third bullet point? Access is limited in
underserved areas. Correct: no one buys broadband services in areas where
there are no broadband services to buy. Perhaps they could simply combine
lines one and three and just say not enough people in the United States have
access to broadband and make this clear?
Symmetrical versus
Asymmetrical Connections
The two long words, symmetrical and asymmetrical, are just scientiﬁcally precise
ways of describing trafﬁc patterns in broadband service offerings. I am tempted
to say equal and unequal, but that wouldn’t be accurate.
Symmetrical means bandwidth throughput is equal in both directions, so as
much data can come into your computer as can go out of your computer.
Asymmetrical adopts the not preﬁx (a) which means that bandwidth going in one
direction is greater than bandwidth going in the other direction.
Think of a highway into a city during rush hour. Many cars are going one way,
and fewer cars are going the other way. You can also look at your mailbox (the
physical one) where you get more mail each day than you send out. You can look
at your e-mail box and see that the ratio of mail in, counting spam, may be a
hundred times greater than the mail going out.
Why service providers offer both options
There are technical reasons for service providers to offer both symmetrical and
asymmetrical connection options. With some providers and types of service,
you don’t have a choice whether you receive symmetrical or asymmetrical
connections. Usually, however, you have a choice. Let me warn you now: a
symmetrical connection almost always costs more.
Although the Internet developed an infrastructure based on sharing connections
between networks (the Internet is really just a giant group of networks
connected to each other), these high-speed data networks often don’t reach out
to the suburbs. The problem is the plumbing—or, in the case of data networks,
the infrastructure.

32 Part I ✦Determining Which Broadband Is Right for You
Infrastructure is a fancy (and clumsy) word for the hardware and software
framework that supports computing and the Internet.
Actually, if the problem really were with the plumbing, things would be better.
Cities and towns work with developers to install physical infrastructure items
such as roads, electricity, water, and sewer connections to support new homes
and businesses. The idea of buying a home and then having to negotiate with
Acme WaterWorks to get fresh water in and wastewater out, wouldn’t even be an
acceptable plot for a bad sitcom.
Housing developments include electricity and telephone service automatically.
New developments often have cable TV distribution wiring built in. Fancy new
developments now include digital broadband access options, such as ﬁber
cabling, to provide high-speed Internet access.
The majority of the houses in the United States lack such expensive high-speed
access, but they do have universal telephone service (by federal decree) and
near-universal cable TV access. Technological restrictions on connections to
you, the Internet consumer, come from the years of technology built to serve a
different function, such as the telephone company. Neither the telephone system
nor the cable TV distribution system was designed to do what we’re asking of
them now: to provide high-speed data connections.
Tech Bits
Another, more technical consideration, has to do with the early chips
built to support broadband connections. As is often the case with elec-
tronics, there is a ﬁnite limit to the number of actions possible within a
certain timeframe. Joseph Lechlieder, an engineer at Bellcore research
center in the 1980s, developed many of the algorithms establishing DSL
technology. He was among the ﬁrst to push an asymmetrical connec-
tion, recognizing most users would download more information than
they upload.
The following section looks at why the existing structure favors downstream
trafﬁc. Then I’ll share some details about upstream trafﬁc.
Downstream details
As I mentioned in the preceding section, network plumbing hasn’t yet caught up
with physical plumbing for most of the homes in the world. But if you think of
water pipes from the lake to your bathroom, you get the idea of how centralized
the plumbing systems are and how their distribution patterns were set in stone
(or actually buried in many cases) long before the Internet was even a glint in an
engineer’s eye.
When you turn the faucet, water comes out. That water had a long trip. First,
millions of gallons of water sit in lakes and reservoirs, sometimes scores or
hundreds of miles away from your city and your bathroom. Millions of gallons
await your faucet’s request for service. Huge pipelines carry the lake water to
holding stations closer to the city. Smaller pipes carry the water to other
distribution points near the suburbs and surrounding cities. Depending on the
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 2 ✦Getting Familiar with Broadband Technology 33
size of the area served by the reservoir, this process may repeat another time or
two. Next, the water arrives in your neighborhood. Most areas still use water
towers to let gravity provide water pressure to homes, but some areas use
holding tanks on (or halfway into) the ground. Finally, the faucet holds back the
water from the tower until you turn the handle. Then it jumps into your sink to
catch you by surprise and splash onto your new pants.
Good ideas for water distribution systems turn out to be good ideas for
delivering data connections to residential areas. The telephone and electrical
companies use the same type of distribution scheme. You may have read about
the network tree concept and how the data ﬂows through the trunk, on out to the
limbs, on to smaller limbs, and ﬁnally to the leaves. Our personal network
connections are the leaves. But this image really should be turned upside down.
It’s more accurate to think of the trunk as being at the top rather than at the
bottom. Our personal connections are at the bottom of this network, just like
we’re on the downhill side of the water pipes from the water tower.
Let’s be honest here. If you chart your Internet use for a week, you’ll ﬁnd the vast
majority of the trafﬁc comes to you, and very little goes out from you. E-mail
goes both ways; but other than mail, I’m betting that you download much more
than you upload—especially when you count spam. You view (download) local
weather radar to check on a coming storm. You view (download) the latest video
from your favorite singer. Plenty of exceptions exist, but most people receive
more content than they send.
One-to-many distribution cost advantages for providers
Centralization offers great cost beneﬁts during a technology’s development.
Reservoirs, water towers, and pipes—expensive as they are—are cheaper than
every house in a city drilling its own well for water. Consequently, a centralized
distribution system offers substantial cost savings. The early telephone
company (AT&T was The Phone Company until 1984, remember) recognized the
potential cost savings of centralization when it followed the water
tower-to-home concept to help contain its distribution costs.
The technology of the time demanded that AT&T create giant connection frames
where the phone line from every home and ofﬁce in the area terminated.
Remember the old switchboard operator pictures where ladies plugged wires
into a matrix of plugs in front of them? That’s the way the telephone network
started and still works today.
Virtual circuit, the operative word for the type of connection used by the
telephone network, creates a solid wire link between the calling and receiving
phone. When you call your next-door neighbor, the wire goes from your phone to
the central ofﬁce (the switching center with computers replacing the ladies with
hair buns and wires) and back down another wire to your neighbor’s house.
Some readers may politely point out that they have a cellular phone and so there
is no wire involved. Correct, but the technology works the same, because the
originating station (your cell phone) and the receiver (the phone you called)
stay connected to each other, and only each other, during the conversation.

34 Part I ✦Determining Which Broadband Is Right for You
Besides, there are few copper wires left to carry phone calls of any distance
anymore. Long distance calls go over ﬁber optic cable and wireless connections
between transmission towers. But the virtual circuit technology remains, and
we’ll see that it colors the types of broadband offered by various telephone
companies today.
All this virtual circuit talk may make you wonder where the one-to-many
distribution scheme appears. The last copper wires in a telephone run between
your home or ofﬁce and the central ofﬁce—still the hub of the local telephone
network. Local telephones link to the local central ofﬁce via old-fashioned copper
wires inside rubber insulators, just like they did over a hundred years ago.
Each central ofﬁce links to other central ofﬁces and combine lines until they
connect to the national network. The phone companies concentrate their
equipment in the central ofﬁces and larger switching centers connecting the
central ofﬁces. Expensive equipment sits in the central ofﬁces, not inside
telephones in every home. Each home links to a single central ofﬁce, although
businesses can link to multiple central ofﬁces for redundancy in case of a failure
at one central ofﬁce.
How would the telephone company connect calls using its virtual circuit method
without central ofﬁces? Not well, and perhaps not at all. Your telephone, and
your modem for that matter, connect your home directly to the neighborhood
central ofﬁce.
Everything the telephone companies do follows this pattern of a direct
connection between your home or ofﬁce and the central ofﬁce. All the various
ﬂavors of DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) services follow the same pattern: your
home by way of a wire to the central ofﬁce.
When I get to the details of DSL later in this book, you will see ways in which the
equipment providing DSL services make it easier to send information
downstream than it does to receive information. But some of the advantages
should be obvious. If the virtual circuit must handle trafﬁc from your house, it
must be able to capture the information, store the information for a fraction of a
second, digest the information, and forward the information somewhere else, if
necessary. These features come at a cost, but the good thing is that the cost is
dropping.
You ﬁnd out all about DSL in Chapter 3. Stay tuned.
The one-to-many distribution network by the telephone companies won’t go
away for years and years; in fact, distribution to the home will generally use this
model. There is too much invested in telephone wires snaking in, around, and
into our neighborhoods to abandon this system.
Centralization of resources will remain a key component of network design. The
Internet philosophy calls for smart devices in the center of things (giant routers
to switch trafﬁc around the network) that support dumb devices (small routers
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Chapter 2 ✦Getting Familiar with Broadband Technology 35
for Internet access at homes and businesses). Which is cheaper: upgrading a
thousand routers owned by service providers or a hundred million small routers
and cable modems?
One-to-many distribution future developments
Since the foundation of the Internet (and therefore the Web) depends on
centralized resources, will there be changes and improvements in the future?
Absolutely. Many of the fun things on the Web, such as streaming Internet radio
or multiplayer games, beneﬁt from the idea of one resource providing services to
many users at one time.
Yet coordinating synchronized streams across hundreds of users thousands of
miles apart is tough, tough, tough. Providing multiple streaming servers
scattered around the Internet is one way to improve the user experience in such
a situation. This means more and smarter servers (or, more accurately, clusters
of servers to provide fault-tolerant hardware and guarantee uptime) scattered
around the Internet closer to more people.
Initially, expensive to deploy, once in place these extra “streaming stations”
provide horsepower for a variety of new and interesting projects as yet unborn.
Perhaps you remember the line from the movie Field of Dreams: “If you build it
they will come.” On the Internet, the idea is “If we have servers and bandwidth,
people will use them.”
The worry for the future? Increasing consolidation in major Internet providers
(the cable and telephone companies) means decreased competition whereas
consolidation of content providers reduces innovation and choice. Many of the
same companies control both the content and method of distribution (Time
Warner, for example, owns cable companies, as well as AOL, WB TV, Warner
Brothers movie studio, and Time, Fortune, Sports Illustrated and even MAD
Magazine), and consolidation increases daily.
Upstream details
The preceding section covered a few of the technical reasons why service
providers ﬁnd it easier to send content downstream rather than accept it coming
upstream; but there’s more to the story. There are two serious roadblocks to
providing more upstream support in the short term:
✦Reworking the network will cost a ton of money
✦Content providers want to sell you content, not make it easy for you to
upload content
The two reasons intertwine as you might expect. Since the Internet stock bubble
burst in a shower of ﬂawed stock offerings, most technology companies stopped
ordering new equipment and delayed all upgrades. Things are picking up, but
one way the companies hope to increase revenue, by downstreaming content,
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

36 Part I ✦Determining Which Broadband Is Right for You
contradicts the idea of upgrading the network to encourage more upstream
trafﬁc. Companies want users to consume, not provide, content, so the
downstream trafﬁc means revenue for them, but not upstream trafﬁc going from
you to others.
I discussed the telephone network of copper lines radiating out from a central
ofﬁce to homes and businesses in the earlier section “One-to-many distribution
cost advantages for providers.” Equipment for switching, routing, and processing
connections from those homes and businesses all reside at the central ofﬁce,
as you see when you look at the various ﬂavors of DSL in Chapter 3. Upgrading
the network means upgrading equipment at each central ofﬁce, an expensive
proposition but in an environment they control. Telephone companies claim
they are upgrading as fast as they can. Interestingly, they upgrade quickly in
areas served by competitors, and slowly in areas with no competition.
Cable companies, by the very nature of cable broadband, must place quite a bit
of equipment in every neighborhood they serve. You may have noticed those
gray or green lumpy boxes in some yards with a wire or two hanging out? To
completely upgrade the cable network, many of these boxes will require
upgrading. This is on top of all the network equipment upgrades needed at the
cable company’s version of the central ofﬁce.
Remember also that cable companies started by emulating the TV broadcast
model. In other words, they send content to you and your only choice is which
channel to consume, er, watch. Of course, you can also turn it off, but few off
switches are overworked today.
In Dallas, the ﬁrst cable franchise for the city promised a marvelous interactive
system supporting upstream responses from every user. Viewers were supposed
to be able to vote on programs they liked, answer surveys, register objections
with a push of a button, and request that advertisers contact them. This was in
the early 1980s. The company making those promises long ago disappeared,
along with the grand plans.
So cable companies wanted to offer interactive, two-way systems allowing
upstream data, but the technology just didn’t exist during the initial cable TV
deployment early on. Even if the only upstream data consists of which new
product you want to buy, that technology requires considerably more
investment than the strictly downstream model.
Modern cable systems may look interactive and upstream capable, but look
carefully and ask your service provider what they mean by interactive. Choosing
your channel only means that your cable box ﬁlters for a different frequency to
display the right channel. All the channels ﬂow down the cable and your set-top
box chooses which to display. That’s not interactive. If you can’t answer a
survey with a button push, the service isn’t interactive.
Newer digital cable Internet access networks usually provide upstream
transmission capabilities because they upgraded the network to support the
higher-quality digital signals. This doesn’t always mean they allow you to send
much stuff upstream, but they have the capability to allow that.

Chapter 2 ✦Getting Familiar with Broadband Technology 37
Be aware that some broadband service providers choke off your ability to send
content upstream. A friend of mine in the public relations business sends
newsletters via e-mail to interested parties, such as writers and magazines, on a
regular basis. He’s been doing it for years with no problems. The local cable
company got purchased (name hidden to protect the company who changed
existing contract terms), and suddenly his upstream allowance dropped to
nearly zero—barely suitable for an individual sending more than just a few
e-mails per day. The fact that Marty had a business plan made no difference.
Always interested in redundancy, Marty called about DSL. They promised him
there were no limits on upstream trafﬁc or e-mails per day. He ordered the
service, moved his network to DSL for the primary Internet connection, and sent
his next newsletter.
Oops, it seems the DSL folks forgot to mention there was a little rule about
upstream trafﬁc. Marty could get out about 80 e-mails per day, but that was it.
This is after the sales department assured him everything was peachy. Evidently
the sales department doesn’t talk to the engineering folks. Marty, last I heard, was
ﬁghting the good ﬁght and expected resolution in his favor, one of these days.
Uploads you may not realize you make
Marty knew what he needed, and asked for a business plan to support the
amount of upload trafﬁc he generated. Some of you may be thinking you don’t
upload much at all, so you don’t have to worry. Take a minute to examine these
common Internet activities a little more closely:
✦E-mail: Sure, we all send some e-mail, even if not nearly as much as we
get. If you’re on one or more mailing lists, you may send 20 or 30
messages a day if you have the time and are interested in your list topics.
Forward a few long jokes to people? Adds up.
✦Photos: Many people send digital photos via e-mail, and that’s wonderful.
But remember photos can be 1MB or more in size. If your upstream
connection is slow, your photos will take forever to leave your e-mail
program.
✦Music: MP3 ﬁles, the most common for playing through your computer,
include about 1MB/minute of music. If you send music via e-mail or
through some type of peer-to-peer service, slow or restricted uploads will
cause delays or complete disconnection.
✦PowerPoint: Warning to all those tweaking your PowerPoint presentation
at home: when you send it back to the ofﬁce via e-mail, you may be
sending multiple megabytes. Simple presentations won’t get out of hand,
but the more images, fades, or music clips added to your presentation
the bigger (and bigger) it will grow. Of the PowerPoint ﬁles people have
sent me over the last year, the average size is 1.6MB, with some as large
as 8MB. Only one out of 65 is under 100KB (it’s a mere 90KB).
This list doesn’t count those of you hoping to run servers of some type at your
home or ofﬁce, or those interested in gaming. I cover those issues in the section
“Symmetrical Advantages” in a few more pages.

38 Part I ✦Determining Which Broadband Is Right for You
If you send any of these ﬁle types on a regular basis, be careful when you choose
your broadband service plan. Verify your upstream speed, even though all the
salespeople want to pitch are the download speeds. Force them to talk about
upstream trafﬁc rates.
Ask if there are upload allowances. If they say there are no upload restrictions,
ask them to tell you where in the service terms of agreement they say that. If
they don’t say there’s no limit, they probably have a limit. When the service
provider says there are no upload allowances, ask again. Don’t think you have
one now? Neither did Marty, and he asked.
Peer to peer networks
Literally everyone in positions of authority for Internet service providers and
the record industry was caught by surprise by the popularity of peer-to-peer
networks.
Napster and co-conspirators such as KaZaa tapped into the growing availability
of broadband connections to millions of personal computers controlled by
music-hungry teens and young adults. Before the Powers That Be caught on,
thousands of CDs were uploaded to the world. And yes, this practice is illegal if
the music is copyrighted, as all commercial CDs are.
Napster and others, however, showed the world of music fans that broadband
provides new avenues for ﬁnding, getting, and listening to music. Using a
broadband connection, every PC can become a real server and content provider
to the rest of the Internet. This echoes the early days of the Internet, except
computers are much cheaper and connection speeds are much higher these
days.
Keep in mind, however, that giving away music is wrong and illegal unless you
created the music or otherwise have the rights of distribution. Second, putting
peer-to-peer software on your computer today opens the door for an enormous
variety of viruses, worms, spyware, and computing pain of all kinds. Avoid
loading a ﬁle-sharing program just to stay away from that aggravation if for no
other reason.
If you’re interested in the ﬁght to make music available and affordable and in
stopping the RIAA from suing kids check out the folks at www.eff.org (see
Figure 2-2). They are ﬁghting the good ﬁght and can use your help.
Many-to-many distribution future developments
As more individuals get broadband access and start to provide content rather
than just download content, peer-to-peer networks will become many-to-many
networks. Napster and KaZaa and others started this trend, and it will continue.
Modern PCs (any ﬂavor, including Windows, Macintosh, Linux, and Unix) have
the horsepower and software to become content servers as well as
workstations. Too much of the software available today increases your security
risk rather than lessen it, but improvements are being made.

Figure 2-2: The group ﬁghting for electronic rights and privacy.
One of the many-to-many networks up and running today are Instant Message
(IM) systems. Teens, used to the immediacy of cell phones, almost always use IM
to communicate with their friends over the network in place of e-mail programs.
A dozen or more conversations may be running at the same time, each
connection linked to another dozen conversations, but only a few will overlap.
It’s not truly a many-to-many network because each conversation stays between
two people, but cutting and pasting and relaying of messages between
conversational partners happens constantly.
The next step for these groups is the appearance of some type of personal
conference room so that each participant can hear every other participant. The
adult world includes products for audio and video conferencing, and the teenage
world is starting to pick up on this.
Two interesting things will likely happen in this space in the short term. First,
better IM tools will appear, especially for connecting multiple users at a time and
supporting cameras as well. Second, users will demand the same type of
constant interaction with all network connections that they get with their
personal IM connections. Remote work connection support will improve, as will
interactive programs based on personal software clients run by group members.
Fueling these innovations? Broadband, of course, as it moves forward by
providing more speed, more speedy wireless connections for more products,
and a reluctance of users to ever be out of touch.

40 Part I ✦Determining Which Broadband Is Right for You
Asymmetrical advantages
Now that you have some idea why you have a choice between symmetrical and
asymmetrical broadband connections, take a look at which option suits your
needs the best. Although choosing the least effective option won’t ruin your
broadband experience, choosing the most effective option will enhance
your experience. And it may even save you some money. The following sections
provide you with some things to think about when deciding between a
symmetrical and an asymmetrical connection.
Common trafﬁc patterns
“Go with the ﬂow” works in high tech as well as everything else. The majority of
users, statistically speaking, download far more than they upload. Larger groups
of potential customers get more attention from vendors, and this is no
exception. It’s just lucky for the various broadband service providers that it’s
cheaper for them to handle the type of trafﬁc their customers demand.
Although Internet packets are immune to gravity, they do head downhill most of
the time. Not all the time, like water in a river rolling toward the sea, but most of
the time.
If you’re a normal Internet and Web user, an asymmetrical plan will work just ﬁne
for you. How do you know if you’re a normal user? Unless you know why you
aren’t, you are.
Cost
Here you ﬁnd the biggest advantage to the asymmetrical broadband option: it
costs less, across the board, than symmetrical broadband. Reduced equipment
needs of service providers supporting more downstream than upstream trafﬁc
results in lower costs.
The most basic and least expensive broadband option available to most users is
a subset of DSL called aDSL (asymmetrical Digital Subscriber Line) from the
local telephone company. Special offers drop the cost down to around $25–$30
per month with a year’s contract. These prices almost always include all the
necessary equipment for connecting one or more personal computers to the
broadband connection.
Be prepared for these prices to stay steady and probably drop for three
reasons:
✦Cable has twice as many broadband subscribers as DSL in the United
States.
✦DSL equipment resides at the central ofﬁce and 90 percent of users can
self-install the DSL modem, saving the costs of an installer visit to the
home.
✦Phone companies want to keep their customers from switching to cable
companies who offer telephone services over cable.
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Chapter 2 ✦Getting Familiar with Broadband Technology 41
You will see many more cost options with DSL than with cable, for reasons made
clear in Chapter 3. But as the telephone and cable companies square off against
each other for broadband and telephone service, the competition will keep the
price at a decent level. Actually, compared to what prices were not long ago, the
bang for your broadband buck is outstanding.
As I write this, here are my service costs for aDSL and Internet cable access:
✦SBC Yahoo! DSL: 384 Kbps downstream, 128 Kbps upstream for
$29.95 per month. One-year contract.
✦Comcast cable modem: 3 Mbps downstream, 256 Kbps upstream
(minimum speeds, may be higher depending on trafﬁc) for $42.95 per
month. This is normally the price I’d pay for a cable modem with a
combination cable TV/Internet plan. But I was able to take advantage of a
special offer. Otherwise, I’d be paying $52.95 per month for the cable
modem.
Symmetrical advantages
Just because I listed many good reasons to be happy with asymmetrical
broadband service doesn’t mean that’s your only choice. Remember that almost
all roads are built with the same number of lanes going as coming.
Earlier, I suggested that most people send more regular mail than they receive.
But what if your business uses mail constantly? For example, what if you are a
billing service, a direct mail company, or you send association news on a regular
basis? You are one of the exceptions that prove the rule. Businesses tend to fall
into this category more than individuals, but I do know people who send more
mail than they receive, including some who fall into the SOHO (small
ofﬁce/home ofﬁce) category.
If you disagreed with being called a normal Internet user just a few paragraphs
ago, you know why you don’t ﬁt into that category. The following sections look
at some of the most common reasons people feel they need the extra upstream
speed they get with a symmetrical Internet connection and why they’re willing to
pay the increased cost of a symmetrical service plan.
Peer-to-peer ﬁle sharing
A peer-to-peer network harkens back to the early days of the Internet (before the
World Wide Web) when each connected computer forwarded ﬁles, stored ﬁles,
and made ﬁles available to all other systems on the network. When you’re
involved in a peer-to-peer network, your system often uploads as much as it
downloads, or perhaps even more if you become a pseudo-server for your peers.
But let’s say it straight out: peer-to-peer ﬁle sharing got more than a bad name
from Napster, it gave Napster such a bad name they killed it. Now Napster has
reincarnated as a pay-music site whereas the RIAA sues children and
grandmothers and tries to win friends through litigation. Looks like bad times for
those interested in sharing person-to-person rather than through one of the
large service providers.

Perhaps the lure to set up connections between your computer and a few other
computers pulls strongly. Just as you have a group of friends for social
interaction, you may also have a group of friends (and their computers) for
electronic interaction.
Social networking now piggybacks upon computer networking, and peer-to-peer
networks facilitate this connection. One new peer-to-peer group that looks
interesting is LinkedIn at www.LinkedIn.com. This freeware ﬁle-sharing
community (see Figure 2-3) connects like-minded people more tightly through
shared ﬁles than any e-mail list and focuses on business relationships. Not sure
if these relationships work yet without a face-to-face component, but I have
friends who believe it’s working for them.
Figure 2-3: LinkedIn—one of the new person-to-person social networks with a
business slant.
Let’s take a look at a few completely legal reasons why you and some friends or
family may want to user peer-to-peer connections:
✦Photo exchange
✦Access ﬁles at home when at work or traveling
✦Instant message outside AOL, Yahoo!, or MSN
✦Give (or get) computer support to a computer over the Internet
✦Collaborate on projects of all kinds (scheduling soccer teams, organizing
a family reunion, writing the great American novel with a friend)

✦Create, send, and share your blog
✦Back up data ﬁles to a remote computer
✦Scan and share papers rather than fax them
✦To ensure secure Virtual Private Network (VPN) connections between
homes and ofﬁces
For every two people, there are three or more reasons to connect through a
peer-to-peer network. Anything electronic can be exchanged directly between
two people if they can connect in this way. Security software to guarantee the
privacy of communication between peers offers great advantages to many
business transactions.
Copying a commercial CD, or sharing any type of music or other media
to which you do not own (or license) the copyright is illegal. Owning the
physical CD gives you no rights to “share” the music.
Linking directly and securely from your home computer to the one at work, or
vice versa, is another example of good use of peer-to-peer technology. Several
companies, such as FolderShare shown in Figure 2-4, provide shared Web space
for document storage and transfer for a fee. Some new companies offering this
services are using peer-to-peer networks. Sometimes they are free, or have a
basic version for free with more features available for a price.
Figure 2-4: One of the new ﬁle-sharing sites.
Technically, when you get involved with peer-to-peer networks your personal
computer becomes a server. Because servers, by deﬁnition, “serve” ﬁles to
www.it-ebooks.info

44 Part I ✦Determining Which Broadband Is Right for You
others, your upstream trafﬁc will be higher than a normal Internet user. Minor
and occasional peer-to-peer activity will function well enough on an
asymmetrical arrangement, because upload speeds of 128 Kbps will support one
other computer connection pretty well. But if your peer-to-peer network use
pushes you into situations where you will be serving ﬁles to more than two
people at any one time, you’ll want to look at a symmetrical broadband
connection.
Web and e-mail servers
When most people think of servers today, they think of Web servers and maybe
e-mail servers. We all use them both constantly. If you plan to host your own
Web and e-mail server(s), you should look at getting a symmetrical broadband
connection.
Most individuals and small businesses lack the expertise to secure their
own Web and e-mail servers. Paying a Web-hosting company a monthly
fee for service puts the security burden on them and will cost less than
upgrading your broadband connection to a more expensive symmetrical
connection.
Microsoft started including Web server software in its personal computer
operating system several versions ago, and some third-party vendors also make
server software for personal computers. On one hand, this exempliﬁes the
“consumer and provider” of content nature of the early Internet. On the other,
this created a security nightmare as people connected unprotected Web servers
to their unsecured broadband Internet connections.
Security for personal computers and home users dropped even lower than dot
com stock options when Microsoft conﬁgured all the networking software as
“open to the world” as the default. Thousands of users, following Microsoft
instructions, saw their personal computers hacked and every connected
computer on their home or small business network compromised.
This isn’t meant to scare you (well, maybe a little) but to emphasize the
considerable security risk you run when connecting a system directly to the
Internet. Each broadband equipped system on the Internet appears just as large
and as tempting a target for hackers as any business site. I spend a considerable
amount of time in the coming chapters closing all the security holes possible to
keep you and your computer contents safe.
Now that the stern security lecture is out of the way (for now), I want to talk for a
minute about why and how people use their own Web and e-mail servers. In
spite of the added security considerations, running your own Web server is
handy, useful, and can be just plain fun.
Again, the server part of Web server deﬁnes the trafﬁc ﬂow direction. When you
have a Web server, your trafﬁc ﬂows more out than in; more upstream than
downstream. This certainly applies to those who share photos and music from
the Web sites because both create large digital ﬁles that take too long to
download under the best of circumstances. Choking your upstream bandwidth
connection using an asymmetrical connection just makes it worse.

Just keep in mind that every broadband service provider includes e-mail server
support. So unless you feel a business need to run your own server, or you just
want to have some fun with the experience, you should consider letting the
experts take care of it for you.
Game networks
Game players generally blast cable because the shared network in the
neighborhood causes performance ﬂuctuations. The rule for gamers tends to be
“go DSL” but that doesn’t always guarantee success.
As you’ll see in Chapter 3, DSL has plenty of network trafﬁc contention issues.
But these issues are in the central ofﬁce and not in your neighborhood. In other
words, your gaming experience will be determined by your service provider
rather than by the trafﬁc load in the network.
DSL gaming pros and cons:
✦Direct, private connection to the central ofﬁce
✦Performance more consistent than cable
✦Slower upstream speeds can mean slower response
✦Slower downstream speeds can slow video response
Cable gaming pros and cons:
✦Higher download speeds improve video performance
✦Higher pipeline bandwidth can mean less upstream latency
✦Shared neighborhood network causes performance ﬂuctuations
Unfortunately, there is no one right answer for game fans. Checking over game
forums around the Internet, I found people who loved their provider whereas the
next comment would curse that same provider.
If someone in your household loves gaming, they have plenty of friends to ask
for recommendations. Because an unhappy gamer generates more anguish in a
household than almost anything else, you may wish to choose your broadband
provider based on game requirements. After all, Web sites download pretty well
on any broadband connection, but a local provider that conﬁgures its network
well for games will generally serve all other content satisfactorily.
This recommendation doesn’t cover those of you hosting game servers. If that’s
the case in your house, you need upstream bandwidth. Again, the gaming
community your child uses will have valuable opinions to help deﬁne your
options.
Speed comparisons
Here’s a standard list of DSL speeds for symmetrical and asymmetrical
broadband connections.
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

46 Part I ✦Determining Which Broadband Is Right for You
Typical residential aDSL speeds:
384 Kbps/128 Kbps
768 Kbps/384 Kbps
Notice you have two levels from most providers. Some DSL providers are
starting to try and ﬁght the speed advantage of cable by saying their
downstream speed is “384 Kbps to 1.5 Mbps.” Cable speeds ﬂuctuate because
cable is a shared medium and more trafﬁc sharing the same bandwidth means
slower speeds for all. Yet DSL touts the fact that it isn’t a shared service. So
where does that extra speed come from? Technically, there are ways to make
that happen, but the providers aren’t upfront about what they’re doing.
Ask your DSL service provider before you pay extra for the increased download
speed option. This could be an improvement from the marketing department
rather than engineering. If the price is the same, take the higher speed option, of
course, but don’t be disappointed if the speed seems more like 384 Kbps than
1.5 Mbps most of the time.
Synchronous Digital Subscriber Line (SDSL) service is the symmetrical version
of the DSL sold to residential and small business customers. Actually, SDSL is the
“normal” DSL and aDSL is the variation, but you’d never know from the
information provided by the phone companies.
The last three speeds listed in the following chart are called IDSL (ISDN Digital
Subscriber Line), which isn’t really DSL. ISDN (Integrated Services Digital
Network) is a precursor to DSL from the ’80s and uses technology that is a bit
different from DSL. Due to prices higher than consumers were willing to bear,
ISDN had little market success when it was originally introduced.
Typical business DSL speeds (SDSL and IDSL):
1.5 Mbps/384 Kbps
1.1 Mbps/1.1 Mbps
768 Kbps/768 Kbps
384 Kbps/384 Kbps
192 Kbps/192 Kbps
144 Kbps/144 Kbps
Even businesses have asymmetrical options. That makes sense, because the
impact on your provider varies little if you’re a household, SOHO, or (very) small
business.
Larger businesses tend to host their own Web and e-mail servers and therefore
need more upstream bandwidth. This means their choices tend toward DSL (or
more expensive data-speciﬁc options as they need more bandwidth) rather than
cable. Few cable companies allocate enough upstream bandwidth to offer

Chapter 2 ✦Getting Familiar with Broadband Technology 47
businesses a symmetrical connection. But don’t feel sorry for larger businesses
because they have plenty of options, even though they all cost more than DSL or
cable.
The technology behind ISDN, however, makes it more distance tolerant. Users
out of the reach of “real” DSL often choose IDSL to grab the only broadband
service they can get. At least the success of DSL and the need to reach farther
means the phone companies had to break down and lower the price of ISDN to
something the market would bear. The only difference for IDSL users from their
aDSL counterparts is the slower IDSL speed and the (usually) higher price.
Nothing stops residential customers from ordering SDSL service, and nothing
stops small businesses from ordering aDSL service. Let your needs make the
decision, not the phone company salesperson trying to tell you they can’t sell
SDSL to a home. They can, and will, when you talk to a supervisor.
Summary
In summary, the U.S. Federal government doesn’t seem to know what broadband
really is, and what they deﬁne as broadband lags far behind European and Asian
broadband service. In addition, there has been little government protection of
consumers rights as FCC rulings routinely favor media corporation over citizen
access and Fair Use access to material granted by the Constitution.
Perhaps it’s not as confusing as all that. Broadband is, essentially, faster Internet
access using new digital technologies (for DSL) and a large shared neighborhood
bandwidth connection (cable).
Nothing bad will happen if you choose the wrong service for your needs. Your
service provider will be able to reconﬁgure your connection if you ask. Moving
from DSL to cable or vice versa will be a problem if you signed a long-term
contract to grab a lower price, but you can always change when your contract
expires.
When you have the choice, always get more speed. That includes upstream and
downstream speed. No one’s Internet response is as fast as they wish it were, so
choose the fastest connections your budget will allow.

here are two mainstream providers of broadband
services: cable companies and telephone
companies. The two alternative methods, satellite and
wireless, offer advantages in some situations but have
only niche markets.
Move your focus to Chapter 4 if you are out-
side the range of DSL or cable broadband ser-
vice, or your local provider(s) deliver such poor
service you want to avoid them. Satellite ser-
vice is available across the continental United
States, whereas wireless broadband requires lo-
cal providers.
Within the two most common broadband Internet
access services, cable and DSL, lurk a range of options,
speeds, and costs. Choosing the right technology for
your situation requires a bit of technical background
because you need to understand the options you have
(or don’t have) available.
Broadband from Phone
Companies: Flavors of DSL
The many versions of Digital Subscriber Lines (DSL)
come ultimately from one source: telephone companies.
You will not always see the telephone company’s name
on the DSL service, but the telephone companies are the
ones who own the telephone wires that reach into your
home, the bulk wire connections that go to the central
ofﬁce, and the Internet long-distance data lines that
provide access to the Internet.

50 Part I ✦Determining Which Broadband Is Right for You
Technically, each phone company is an Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier
(ILEC). AT&Ts dismemberment in 1984 left seven regional Bell companies, and
those are the ILECs. You may remember them being called Baby Bells, especially
right after the breakup. Most commonly they fall under the label of Regional Bell
Operating Company (RBOC).
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 opened the doors to the vast phone
network infrastructure to competition, and hundreds (or thousands) of
Competitive Local Exchange Carriers (CLEC pronounced see-leck) appeared.
Many CLECs have no equipment, network, or repair personnel, so they function
primarily as resellers of services they get wholesale from the larger CLECs and
remaining regional ILEC (Baby Bell) companies. Some of the CLEC companies
that appeared over the years had the life span of mayﬂies whereas others have
grown and prospered.
If you’ve ever seen the wonderful 1967 James Coburn movie The Presi-
dent’s Analyst you will understand if I slip and write TPC for The Phone
Company.
The important fact to remember is that all DSL companies and services stand
upon the underlying telephone companies. Whether this makes you happy or
nervous will depend on your experiences with various phone companies over
the last few years.
You may have ﬁgured out that you’ll need to have at least one telephone line
connected to your home or ofﬁce to support any ﬂavor of DSL. You can call this
line Plain Old Telephone System (POTS) or you may hear it referred to as a land
line. Sometimes you hear it called copper because that’s the metal used to make
telephone wires.
Whatever you call it, you have to have an old-fashioned telephone line into your
home or ofﬁce. That used to be given, but today many people rely completely on
their cellular phones and have no home phone. Unfortunately, cell phones don’t
support DSL.
Equally as important as the existing telephone lines running all over the place
are the technicians who run all over the place to install, conﬁgure, and repair
DSL services. Sending a technician out to a home or business to install and
conﬁgure DSL for a new customer eats most of the proﬁt for that line for the ﬁrst
year. The industry calls this a truck roll and that often sounds more like a swear
word than a service description.
The expense of a truck roll for new customers kept the price too high for many
consumers for years. Much research goes into designing products and creating
software to enable new DSL customers to install the service themselves. After
all, you can buy a new telephone and plug it into your existing jack and it works,
right? The industry wants to make adding a DSL connection just that easy (and
cheap), and they’re getting there.

Chapter 3 ✦Types of Broadband Providers 51
The development of DSL technology
The never-ending quest to run faster and jump higher pushes most technologies
forward, and DSL follows that rule. During the 1980s, the growing cable
television providers showed great promise (though most of those promises
remain unfulﬁlled to this day) and grabbed most of the headlines. How could the
dull, placid, monopolistic, and overly bureaucratic telephone industry
compete?
Enter DSL and the promise of video on demand to homes everywhere. And, since
everyone already had telephone lines, these fancy new digital telephone
services would cost less to deploy than burying coax cable everywhere as the
cable companies were doing.
Tech Bits
Copper, a handy metal for telephone lines and electricity cables, intrigued
researchers with its promise as a conduit for high-speed data. Joseph
Lechleider, now retired from the research facility Bellcore, ﬁrst mapped
out mathematically how to send broadband signals over a pair of copper
wires. He also suggested most users would beneﬁt from asymmetrical
speeds to focus available bandwidth on downstream performance.
Twisted pair wiring, the kind used by the telephone company to reach your
house, is exactly what it says: two physical wires twisted around each other.
There is no shielding wrapped around the wires, as there is with coax used by
the cable company. The twists, 12 per foot at minimum, help prevent electrical
noise and interference.
T1 circuits, a symmetrical 1.5 Mbps connection, always needed expensive
line-conditioning equipment. Finding a way to support those speeds without the
conditioning equipment became the goal. ISDN came ﬁrst, but the American
public never got excited about the symmetrical low-speed (128 Kbps) data
network protocol. The Europeans did, and I remember the telephone companies
in America over-promising ISDN and then delaying access to the technology. No
wonder consumers in the United States didn’t get excited. From ISDN came
HDSL, now used for most modern T1 circuits.
For a discussion of symmetrical and asymmetrical data transmissions,
refer to Chapter 2.
Discreet MultiTone (DMT), hashed out largely by John Ciofﬁ, became the
standard for DSL in 1993 after comparison tests showed much better
performance than other options. DMT separates the signal over a pair of copper
wire into 256 subchannels to help eliminate electrical interference and line
noise. Each subchannel has its own stream, starting at some frequency from
64 KHz up to 1.1 MHz, far above the 4 KHz signal used for voice telephone calls.
Having separate subchannels makes it easier to provide asymmetrical data rates
as well.

I particularly enjoy the fact that a connected group of 68 ADSL data
frames is called a SuperFrame. Wonder if the SuperFrames have a little
red digital cape ﬂowing behind them on the network?
Improvements in error correction and packet framing (the way the data packets
are put together) continue to increase reliability and provide better performance
over distance. The goal now for researchers is to cut installation time to the
point you no longer need a truck roll to install a new customer.
How DSL works for you
On one level, you can say that DSL works just like a super-charged modem. After
all, you connect it directly to your computer (if you’re only connecting one
system), plug in a line from a phone jack to the modem, and the call goes directly
to the telephone company’s central ofﬁce.
Just as with an old modem connection, your Internet service provider (ISP) must
have a matching piece of equipment on its end to communicate with the piece of
equipment at your end. Your computer is connected over a phone line to the
ISPs computer. Should be nostalgic for some of you.
Before plugging your computer directly into your DSL modem (or more
than one if your DSL modem has four ports), protect yourself. Check out
Chapters 7, 11, 12, and 13 for security tools and technique to protect
your computer.
You can, if you wish, skip the rest of the technical explanation and call a DSL
provider and let them do the work, assuming you don’t mind paying a high price
for services you don’t need, because the phone company is likely to add
services you don’t really need. This also assumes you don’t mind letting some
phone sales clerk at the service provider decide how fast a connection you want
and that price is no object.
However, if you want to get the right service for your situation, keep reading.
You don’t have to know many details about DSL and cable and other Internet
access technologies, but you can save yourself money and aggravation by
getting an idea of what will make you happy before you place your service order.
Take some comfort in the fact that there are quite a few similarities between the
way you’ve connected your computer to the rest of the world for years and the
new, faster ways to connect. All DSL technology comes from work started inside
the telephone company’s research labs back in the 1980s, so they’ve been
working on these services for quite a while. Now if they could just get a handle
on that whole customer service idea, they’d be in great shape.
As you’ll see in upcoming chapters, there are a number of ways to connect more
than one computer to your broadband connection, so I can’t say it always works
like an old-fashioned modem. But the choices of your broadband provider, and
your network design situation (whether two computers or a hundred) are
independent of each other. After you have your decisions made, you can change

Chapter 3 ✦Types of Broadband Providers 53
your broadband access provider without changing anything except perhaps
your broadband modem. Conversely, you can change just about everything
inside your network and nothing will affect your broadband service.
Changing providers means changing your e-mail address and more.
Check out Keeping your old e-mail address in Chapter 9 for your e-mail
address options before signing a contract.
DSL
The term Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) has become generic and now tends to
represent the family of digital data services over the telephone company’s
infrastructure. So referring to a “DSL connection” is like referring to a Ford. You
have the right group, but you don’t know if the speciﬁc item is a Mustang or an
F150 pickup truck. The site shown in Figure 3-1 is one of many that can help you
pick the best broadband service for your situation.
Figure 3-1: One of the sites to help you pick the broadband service that ﬁts you best.
The Phone Company, and later the Baby Bells, lusted after a way to compete
with cable television from the ﬁrst day cable TV companies started digging up
the streets to lay cable. One of the earliest rationalizations for research into DSL
was the planned capability to download video to a consumer’s TV through the
person’s telephone connection. I certainly call that a direct challenge to the
cable industry, which at the time promised us 500 channels of quality televised
entertainment.

54 Part I ✦Determining Which Broadband Is Right for You
Neither the phone or cable industries kept their word, did they? Video on
demand doesn’t exist from DSL providers in any sense of the word, and there’s
no easy way to push the video to the TV (yet). And the cable companies have
only a half-way answer to their promises, with about 250 channels. They
certainly missed as often as they hit that quality televised entertainment target.
If you call a service provider and ask for DSL and ask whether SDSL or G.Lite is
available (deﬁnitions upcoming), you will put yourself above all the other
customers who call in. This means you may get bumped up the line to talk to a
supervisor, which is good because they can sometimes offer deals the ﬁrst line
salespeople can’t. Take a look at the information provided by the DSLForum
shown in Figure 3-2 for some ideas and background before calling for service.
Figure 3-2: The ofﬁcial Web site of the DSLForum.org.
DSL implementations have run wild throughout the United States, and even
wilder in some other parts of the world. There are more total DSL broadband
users in Japan than in the United States, and China added more subscribers than
both in the third quarter of 2003. Table 3-1 contrasts usage in 20 countries.
Growth of DSL service made great strides outside the United States. The top
three leaders in percentage increase in DSL lines in the ﬁrst half of 2003 were
Portugal (60 percent), China (40 percent) and the UK (32 percent). South Korea
won the award for DSL penetration now that over 30 percent of the telephone

South Korea have upgraded to a faster form of ADSL.
The DSLForum.org group doesn’t plan to rest on these laurels. Its oft stated goal
is “200 million subscribers and 20 percent of all phone lines online by the end of
2005.” That’s a lot of phone lines and a lot of customers surﬁng the Internet via
broadband.
From now on, when I say “DSL” I mean that generically, and the subject at hand
pertains to all the common ﬂavors of DSL. As the big heading for this section
says, think of DSL as broadband from the phone company. When the topic
concerns only one type of DSL service, I’ll specify that particular technology.
ADSL
When you see a phone company advertising DSL, it usually means Asymmetrical
Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL). All consumer-oriented advertising, such as the
TV ads and newspaper inserts, touting the low price of broadband refer to ADSL.
In fact, you have to struggle sometimes to ﬁnd the right department and
salesperson to talk to you about faster services for business customers.
For almost all home users, including consumers and home ofﬁces, ADSL of some
type will be your choice of broadband that’s not cable. Many small businesses
can function quite well using ADSL, especially if they are close enough to a
telephone central ofﬁce to get fast download speeds.

56 Part I ✦Determining Which Broadband Is Right for You
Tech Bits
The sales literature ﬁne print will explain that you’re getting ADSL for the
low price option, even though it says DSL. Remember that ADSL means
you have slower upload speeds than download speeds, as explained in
Chapter 2.
Standards and chipsets to put into equipment to support ADSL appeared in
1995. Ofﬁcially, data rates up to 6.1 Mbps are supported. Expanded standards
appeared in 2001, adding plenty of features to help the phone companies and
your ISP. You can’t see the improvements, but the additional network
management tools may help your service provider solve a problem for you one
day.
How fast is ADSL? Sorry to weasel out, but it depends. Some of the most popular
downstream/upstream speeds are listed in Table 3-2.

Notice your upstream speed choices: 128 Kbps, 256 Kbps, or 384 Kbps. If you
need faster upstream speeds you need to look at another ﬂavor of DSL.
Your choice of speed depends greatly on your distance from the phone
company’s central ofﬁce. I’ll cover those variables in the Service Provider Details
section coming soon.
If you’re close enough to get a choice of speeds, your provider may try to
determine whether you are a business customer, a home customer, or a home
ofﬁce customer. This makes no difference to its equipment and network
conﬁguration, but oftentimes separate sales and marketing groups become
territorial about customer bases. Use your new-found DSL lingo ability to get
bumped up to a supervisor if you want a “business” connection to your home,
home ofﬁce, or small business.
Is ADSL the best choice for you? Check in Chapter 2 where I explained where an
asymmetrical transmission speed (download fast, upload slow) makes sense and
doesn’t make sense. For instance, if you play interactive action games hosted by
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 3 ✦Types of Broadband Providers 57
a game service provider, ADSL will work fairly well. If you plan on hosting games
on your computer, the slower upload speeds will cramp your style (and your
co-players will whine about your slow connection).
Most people receive more information from the Internet and Web than they send
out. If that describes your Internet usage, ADSL will work for you.
Why Dial-up Speed Boosters Aren’t Broadband
You may have wondered whether various speed boosters and turbo dial-up
providers are worth the money versus getting broadband. Those systems work
by caching information from popular Web sites at their end (the ISP) or your end
(ﬁlling your computer with temporary ﬁles). If you go to popular Web sites, you
will see improved speed with these systems. However, they do nothing at all to
improve your download speed on e-mail, music ﬁles, applications updates, or
noncached Web pages. If you can see the ﬁne print, they will admit this, but they
try hard to hide this fact.
ADSL2 and ADSL2+
Never content, ADSL vendors are working on ADSL2 and ADSL2+. ADSL2 product
component developers are starting to release the building blocks necessary for
equipment supporting the ADSL2 standard.
That may not mean too much for those of us in the United States, because the
differences in speed and distance between ADSL2 and the current ADSL
standards aren’t all that great.
Where best-case ADSL speeds are now around 8 Mbps, ADSL2 promises best-
case speeds of 12 Mbps. That sounds like a fair upgrade on a percentage basis,
but if you’re getting 6 Mbps downloads now, about the best possible, you’re
limited by Internet delays, not your ADSL service. ADSL2 won’t make that much
difference for you because it can’t relieve Internet congestion between you and
your favorite Web site.
ADSL2 offers increased distance, but only about 600 feet worth. Although that
will make you happy if you’re 400 feet beyond the limit, that doesn’t mean your
DSL service provider will upgrade to ADSL2 and connect you.
In fact, there are no major DSL vendors in the United States offering ADSL2
services as of early in 2004. There may be one or two who just purchased the
equipment and therefore received ADSL2-compliant hardware, but I haven’t
found them.
A search of popular DSL discussion boards turned up reports that many ISPs in
Japan are offering ADSL2 service. Finland, that hotbed of technical networking
advancement, has one ISP promising to roll out ADSL early in 2004.

58 Part I ✦Determining Which Broadband Is Right for You
The big news for ADSL2 is pair-bonding. First appearing with ISDN to hook two
64 Kbps digital channels together for 128 Kbps to justify the price of ISDN over a
56 Kbps dial-up modem, pair-bonding does what it says. It takes two or more
ADSL2 channels, or wire pairs, and electronically combines them into a single
data conduit. Suddenly (Bam!) you have speeds approaching those offered by
ﬁber optics over regular telephone company twisted pair wires.
ADSL2 also introduces ways to handle voice over data on ADSL connections
without disturbing the existing voice connection on the underlying telephone
line. Although that may seem somewhat stupid to jump through hoops to
support VoIP on a phone line, the more advances companies make in handling
voice over data lines will help quality increase while prices decrease.
ADSL2+ will be the newsworthy upgrade in the United States. The new standard
effectively doubles the bandwidth capacity of copper wire from 1.1 MHz to
2.2 MHz of signal room. This makes it possible to offer download speeds of up to
25 Mbps as long as you’re within 5,000 feet (one mile as the wire winds its way)
from the telephone company’s central ofﬁce.
Remember those dreams of downloading movies through your telephone wires?
The technology still isn’t there, even with ADSL2+. Television quality (broadcast
TV, not HDTV) requires 96 Mbps, but can be compressed to 6 Mbps. The
compression tools still need hardware support, not just software, so the
telephone lines will remain TV free for the next few years.
SDSL and T1
Symmetrical DSL (SDSL) vendors aim more toward businesses than residential
customers, but make exceptions for home businesses most of the time. But they
charge business rates, of course, even if they install the service at your home.
Some of the things you may get with SDSL you don’t get with ADSL include the
following:
✦A ﬁxed IP address (see Chapter 12)
✦Multiple ﬁxed IP addresses (ditto)
✦Bundled service packages for long distance call discounts
✦Support from people instead of voice response systems (no guarantees)
✦ISPs that understand business needs
✦Spam ﬁltering at the ISP site
As I explained earlier in the Development of DSL Technology section, DSL has
started to replace T1 data circuits for many situations. This helps the customers,
because DSL is cheaper than any T1 offering. It also helps the service provider
because DSL is cheaper for them to support.
The offerings from some service providers even call SDSL lines “Fractional T1”
products. As long as they charge SDSL prices rather than T1 prices, let them call
it whatever they want.

Chapter 3 ✦Types of Broadband Providers 59
Most common SDSL speeds are 384 Kbps and 768 Kbps (upstream and
downstream). These are, amazingly, two popular Fractional T1 speed options.
If your location isn’t within range of a phone company central ofﬁce offering DSL,
you can look into a Fractional T1 connection. The T1 technology reaches farther
but costs more than DSL of any ﬂavor.
Some of the things you will get with T1 you don’t get with SDSL:
✦A Service Level Agreement (SLA) covering the provider’s responsibilities
✦Improved monitoring
✦Improved technical support
✦Unlimited IP addresses and network conﬁguration options
✦Uptime (usually 99.99 percent uptime guaranteed)
✦Speciﬁcally ﬁltered and conditioned telephone line
If your service provider can connect you with SDSL, it probably can also support
T1 or Fractional T1 to your site. Whether it does or not is a different story.
Another broadband technology, Frame Relay, is almost impossible to purchase
unless your site is in a business location.
Pricing between T1 and SDSL are also two different stories. Since T1 lines can be
“stretched” to reach more locations, distance strongly inﬂuences pricing. More
distance and more speed always equals more expense. There are telephone
company charges included because of the conditioned line, so make sure your
quoted total includes that charge.
And how much is the total? Used to be horrendous ($1,500–$2,000 per month),
but the prices have dropped way down. But even dropped, they’re outside the
range of individuals and many small businesses.
T1 cost range estimates, with common marketing labels for fractional T1
connections, for the symmetrical digital data circuits:
✦Full T1 (1.5 Mbps): $600–$1,500 per month
✦Half (768 Kbps): $500–$900 per month
✦Quarter (384 Kbps): $400–$700 per month
✦Sixth (256 Kbps): $300–$700 per month
Not all speeds are available in all areas or from all service providers. T1 is
symmetrical, so you get 1.5 Mbps throughput upstream and downstream. That’s
one advantage of using two pairs of wires for T1.
Although conventional wisdom says homes and home ofﬁces don’t “deserve” a
T1 line, don’t let that restrict your thinking. Some small businesses need the
speed and reliability of a T1 line. If your business demands indicate a T1 or
Fractional T1, get one. The prices have never been better.

IDSL and ISDN
ISDN Digital Subscriber Line (IDSL) is the poor relation of the DSL family.
Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) is the lowest speed entry into the
digital data line world. More successful in Europe than the United States, ISDN
providers usually maxed out their standard offerings with dual-channel ISDN for
a total of 128 Kbps over standard telephone lines.
Yes, the dial-up modem you want to get rid of does provide a third of that speed.
ISDN offers digital links at longer distances than any other affordable consumer
DSL option, so the phone companies are slapping a coat of DSL paint on ISDN
and calling it IDSL.
IDSL can break through two big problems with DSL: distance and older repeater
circuits in the telephone system. ISDN, the basis for IDSL, can use repeaters to
extend signal range far beyond standard DSL connections. In addition,
approximately half the homes in the United States can’t yet be reached by ADSL
because of an old style of telephone circuit repeater. ISDN, and therefore IDSL,
can push through those circuits, as can the G.Lite technology described in the
next section.
IDSL is a symmetrical connection, because it’s based on ISDN and ISDN is
symmetrical. For that reason the price sometimes reﬂects business rates rather
than basic level ADSL rates. At least some IDSL service providers allow you to
buy more than one circuit and bond them for better throughput.
If your service provider says you can’t get ADSL or SDSL, ask about IDSL. If that
doesn’t do the trick, ask about ISDN. It’s better than dialup. Or skip to Chapter 4
and learn about satellite and wireless networking.
G.Lite, HDSL, VDSL, and RDSL
G.Lite, a new technology that’s been approved by the standards committees that
hopes to eliminate or greatly reduce truck rolls. Remember that truck rolls cost
the service provider a ton of money (hundreds of dollars to get a $30 per month
account). Every truck roll the service providers eliminate will make that new
connection proﬁtable in less than a year.
Sometimes called Universal ADSL (by some marketing VPs, no doubt), G.Lite can
handle the split between the telephone company’s frequency range for voice
calls and the higher frequencies used for data. Normal ADSL installations require
a splitter on the line close to the customer’s location, which means a truck roll.
Since the DSL modem installation in the home between the computer and the
DSL line has gotten so much easier, consumers can install DSL themselves, after
G.Lite handles that pesky splitter problem, of course.
The other big advantage of G.Lite is its ability to go through the repeaters that
block regular ADSL. This makes it possible to get connected at greater distances
but drops the maximum speed to 1.5 Mbps downstream and 512 Kbps upstream
in the circumstances.

Chapter 3 ✦Types of Broadband Providers 61
If your service provider supports G.Lite, the sales representatives may not
mention it unless you ask for a higher speed connection they can’t provide. This
is a new service and your provider may not have it yet or your sales rep may not
have been trained. For your part, you don’t really care whether your DSL modem
connects to ADSL or G.Lite, because it will look the same to you.
The explosion of inexpensive DSL recently reﬂects the availability of service
providers to push DSL out to about 90 percent of the U.S. residences now, thanks
to G.Lite. Not to be outdone, ADSL product manufacturers are ﬁguring out their
own ways past the repeaters and truck rolls. If your service provider pitches
Consumer DSL, they’re pushing reworked ADSL. Rejoice in the fact there’s plenty
of competition trying to grab your monthly Internet access check.
The following list discusses three other DSL ﬂavors your service provider won’t
mention unless your situation is unusual:
✦High Bit-Rate DSL (HDSL), an older technology, began the development of
T1 lines as DSL links. Two pairs (two phone lines) are needed for the
symmetrical HDSL. HDSL-2, the new and improved version, can run over
one telephone line. You won’t see either of these services offered to your
home or small business.
✦Very High Data Rate DSL (VHDSL) is the dragster of the DSL family. It
supports up to 55 Mbps of symmetrical trafﬁc, but only for 1,000 feet.
Large companies with a campus environment love it.
✦Rate-Adaptive DSL (RDSL) is another improvement on ADSL. Software
determines which data rates the customer can use on an RDSL line.
Downstream speeds can vary between 640 Kbps to 2.2 Mbps, and
upstream speeds can vary between 272 Kbps to 1.008 Mbps.
Service provider details
There are many DSL service providers other than the local telephone company.
However, the telephone company will not tell you about them, even though it
provides the actual lines and technology for the smaller broadband service
providers. If you want options, you’ll have to ﬁnd them yourself.
Some broadband service providers have a national presence, and some serve a
small community. Their size does not indicate their quality, but may indicate the
range of services they are able to offer.
Here’s a quick list of Web addresses for some of some of the major national DSL
service providers in the United States:

Are there other service providers offering DSL and Internet provider services in
your area? Absolutely. You may have dozens or more, either located near you or
including you in their service area. The previous list merely names some of the
national providers so you can compare their services against those of your local
companies. Hint: You want the smaller local companies to beat the national
companies in price, service, features, or all three.
www.broadbandreports.com, shown in Figure 3-3, makes for fascinating
reading, especially if you want to go through the forums and see how your fellow
citizens have been treated by broadband service providers in the past. Don’t try
and pick out a good provider based on just this feedback, however, because the
same provider will get cheers from one person and jeers from the next. But do
look at the ways customers have convinced their service providers to ﬁx their
problems and try them yourself when necessary.
Figure 3-3: A site that offers reviews of broadband service providers.
One thing you must remember is that your broadband service provider becomes
your ISP. If your current ISP adds broadband service, you can probably upgrade

with them and change nothing about your e-mail, name servers, personal Web
pages, or support contacts.
If your current ISP doesn’t offer broadband service, or you’re looking to go to
broadband because you hate your ISP, make a note of the following details. You
don’t need an answer for every item before you change, but the more you plan
ahead the less hair pulling you’ll do later. Take a look at Table 3-3 to see what I
consider important.
Table 3-3
Service Provider Feature Recommendations
Features to check
My recommendations
E-mail
Enough addresses for everyone on your network, plus a couple
for future use. Web-based e-mail, virus and spam ﬁlters are
nearly standard from good providers
Connection times
No limit to online connection hours
IP Addresses
Dynamic or static? One or more?
Personal Web site
Enough space for your needs, support for popular Web design
tools like FrontPage, and enough allowed bandwidth for the
trafﬁc you expect
Newsgroups
Full read and write access to majority of Usenet groups
Technical Support
Online and telephone options, with either a local or toll free
call. 24x7 support may come in handy one day
You may not agree with my recommendations, and that’s ﬁne. But be sure you
consider your own recommendations before you sign the service provider
contract. You have much more leverage before you sign than after.
Availability
Real estate agents know this joke: What are the three most important things
about broadband availability? Location, location, and location.
DSL requires physical wires to connect to each client. Building out those huge
bundles of twisted pair wiring took the telephone companies over a half century
of constant work.
For cost saving purposes, phone companies looked for ways to support more
users while building fewer central ofﬁces. They started putting extension units
out in the neighborhoods and business districts called remote terminals.
Sometimes these look like cabinets sitting by the side of the road. They started
by using T1 connections back to the central ofﬁce, but for the last couple of
decades have used ﬁber optic cables.
Remote terminals reset the distance limit to customers out of reach of the
central ofﬁce. My home, for example, is over 35,000 feet away from the central
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

64 Part I ✦Determining Which Broadband Is Right for You
ofﬁce. No DSL for me for years, until SBC added a remote terminal somewhere in
the area. Now I can get high bandwidth ADSL without a problem.
There is a problem with many of the older remote terminals, however. The
phone companies originally used what’s called a Digital Loop Carrier (DLC) to
provide the signal boost. They did this before DSL development, which meant
(life being the way it is) that the DLCs blocked DSL.
Tech Bits
Digital Loop Carrier blocks were serious impediments to early DSL rollout
efforts. At one time, over 50 percent of all U.S. homes and businesses
had a DLC between them and their central ofﬁce, blocking DSL for them.
ISDN worked, but not ADSL.
G.Lite, as I mentioned back a few pages, ﬁgured a way around these DSL
roadblocks. So have some ADSL product vendors who are claiming their
networks run faster and jump higher than G.Lite. Phone companies are
working to upgrade their old repeaters and put in place new DSL-friendly
circuits, but the cost is high and sometimes someone (like the Federal
Communications Commission on several occasions) has to nudge them to
keep them moving.
Depending on which survey you believe, either 70 percent or 90 percent of all
U.S. homes and businesses are now within the reach of some type of DSL
service provider. The phone companies are begging off “universal”
broadband service, even though they’ve taxed us on every phone bill for
decades to support universal telephone service. Whether the phone
companies will be forced to consider broadband telephone service that must
be universally supported will be the subject of high political drama over the
next few years.
Can you call and demand the phone company get DSL out to your location? Sure
you can call, but it will have no effect. Phone companies put new remote
terminals and upgrade old repeaters in areas willing to buy DSL service in large
numbers. Put your name on their “call when you have DSL” list and encourage
every person in the neighborhood to do the same, and maybe you’ll get lucky.
Location, location, location.
Distance and speed
The farther you are from a central ofﬁce, or a DSL-friendly repeater in a remote
terminal or other extension feature, the slower your DSL service. The closer you
are, the faster your service.
Let me boil down average distance limitations in Table 3-4 and show some
guidelines for what services you can get at what distances.
Table 3-4 is an estimate and average, not a guarantee. Your service provider will
measure and tell you what it can do. Technical limits are as the wire winds,
meaning a site physically 5,000 feet away may be 9,000 feet away following the
cable. Not likely, but possible.

Some DSL users report that broadband service providers have a policy where a
potential residential customer is just a little too far away. But, if they pony up the
extra money, the business class service can reach them. The fact that the two
services are functionally the same never creeps into the conversation.
Tech Bits
All speed listings for data transmissions are optimistic and theoretical
rather than practical. You’ll rarely if ever receive speeds as much as
80 percent of ofﬁcial speed.
Some Web sites can help you estimate your distance from a DSL-friendly phone
company installation. One is at www.broadbandreports.com/distance, a site
shown in Figure 3-3. Just about every DSL vendor includes a quick qualiﬁcation
test based on your telephone number and address to see what level of DSL
service will reach you. Prequaliﬁcation does not guarantee service, however, as
SBC in 2002 said I could get DSL but later changed the story because I was just a
little too far away.
Throughput
People talk about DSLs advantages since each connection runs directly from
your home or ofﬁce to the telephone company’s central ofﬁce in the area. Cable,
they sneer, is a shared medium and so your neighbor sucks your bandwidth.
Yes, but let me drill down a bit more. Once your direct DSL link hits the service
provider or central ofﬁce, what do you think happens? Every customer
connected to every line served by that service provider may try to reach the
Internet through the same router. You can’t see the congestion because it’s
upstream from you and hidden inside the service provider’s walls.

66 Part I ✦Determining Which Broadband Is Right for You
Your physical street may have a direct shot to the highway, so you make great
time out of your neighborhood. Yet that helps little if the highway looks like a
parking lot. The same thing can happen at the broadband service provider’s
switch that connects its customers to the Internet.
The term for all the arrangements service providers make with each other to
connect their networks is peering. Every service provider faces a bottleneck
issue if all its clients attempt to reach the Internet at the same time, just like the
crush at the door of a movie theater when the show’s over. Making peering
arrangements helps service providers ensure each data packet coming in from
customers has plenty of ways to reach its Internet destination.
But nothing in DSL technology addresses this issue. After the DSL connection
carries your packet to your service provider, the noncontention network design
disappears.
Yes, network congestion happens in your neighborhood on broadband over
cable. But network congestion happens at your service provider on broadband
over DSL. So there may be a slight advantage, but only a slight one.
Of course, if your cable broadband provider has over-subscribed the cable
capacity in your neighborhood, busy times on the broadband would be
noticeably slower and throughput will drop. The only way to stop this is to call
and complain when the “random service quality generator” kicks into overdrive.
Or, convince your neighbors to stay off their broadband connections when you
want access.
Reliability
Service and uptime matter, and broadband reliability does tend to favor a hub
and spoke arrangement (the phone company’s central ofﬁce is in the middle
with lines going out like bicycle wheel spokes) like that of DSL over a shared
medium like that of cable. And that’s not an underhanded shot at cable’s
reputation but the fact of a shared medium.
When your DSL line breaks, you suffer. When your neighbor’s DSL line breaks,
you don’t know it. When your neighbor’s cable breaks, and you’re on that cable
as well, you know it. Better you don’t suffer for your neighbor’s problems.
DSL connections within 10,000 feet of the central ofﬁce (or service provider)
may have no active components between the client and the ofﬁce. Fewer active
components means fewer mistakes.
Customers served by DSL via remote terminals to boost the signal for longer
distances do have some active components between them and their service
provider. If something happens to the remote terminal, the entire area’s DSL
service would be interrupted. But such a failure would ring alarm bells and send
technical support folks running.
Telephone companies do a pretty good job of keeping phone lines up. Since DSL
runs over the same physical wires as your home or ofﬁce telephone line, the DSL
service stays up as well.

Chapter 3 ✦Types of Broadband Providers 67
One detail with ADSL you don’t often see mentioned is the need for a splitter on
the phone lines. The DSL signals make noise on the line that interferes with voice
connections unless you put a ﬁlter on that line. Your ADSL supplier will include
the ﬁlters as part of your installation kit, or you can buy them at Radio Shack.
Once in place, your phone quality stays about the same even when you’re
listening to streaming music downloads over the Internet while talking on that
same phone line.
Security
Is your computer safe on DSL? Not really, because DSL puts your computer on
the Internet, and bad things can happen to computers on the Internet.
This isn’t the place to look for computer security information about
viruses, hackers, and ﬁrewalls. Skip to Chapter 7 for a full examination of
those topics.
However, using any ﬂavor of DSL does not make your computer less secure than
any other computer on the Internet. Some of the features increase security, such
as IP addresses that change every time you connect to the Internet. Those
changes make it difﬁcult for someone to focus on your particular computer.
Technically, someone could follow your phone cable and physically tap it
somewhere. Not likely, but the truly paranoid would worry about that. But if
you’re that level of paranoid, you shouldn’t use a computer at all, because you
expose all sorts of information about yourself when you traverse the Internet.
Costs
Pricing for DSL services varies from each provider, of course, but there are three
levels to most price structures. Basic ADSL, the 384/128 Kbps product, gets all
the promotional come-on pricing. See an ad for “High Speed Internet Access for
less than a dollar a day!!!” and they’re talking about 384/128 Kbps speeds to
residential customers. In the spring of 2004, prices for this service level seem to
be $39.95 per month with discounts and specials making the price $25 to $30 per
month. Although the low prices are supposed to run out after a year, I doubt
vendors will have any luck upping the price for existing customers. All you need
do if they threaten to bump your price is threaten to sign up with another
provider at its introductory price.
As hardware costs decrease for new generations of DSL equipment and the early
adopter customers all have service, I’m betting prices will ﬂoat downwards even
more. Some provider will start a price war offering service at $19.95 per month
before long, and that will be the new “basic” price. I’ve already seen $19.95 as a
“Special Three Month Introductory Special Price!!!” from two providers.
Mid-tier pricing, for the downstream speeds ranging up to a guaranteed
1.5 Mbps, are at least double the retail price for the basic price. The lowest
national pricing I can ﬁnd now is $49.95, and most service providers run the
price up to about $80 at the top end. Ask your potential provider about all
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
68 Part I ✦Determining Which Broadband Is Right for You
service levels, because some levels only jump $5 or $10 in price but offer
substantial speed increases.
Top end pricing for top speeds (6 Mbps/256 Kbps) averages around $150 per
month, but that will drop as well. At least one smaller service provider has run
promotions offering top speeds for $99 for a limited time. These speeds are only
possible if you can throw a rock and hit your central ofﬁce. (Okay, a slight
exaggeration), but you can ask. Table 3-5 compares estimated pricing levels.
Table 3-5
Three DSL Pricing Levels Estimate
Speed
Price Range
384 Kbps downstream
$20–30 per month
Up to 1.5 Mbps downstream
$50–80 per month
6 Mbps downstream
$100–160 per month
Although service providers list installation charges on their Web sites, the
competition today stops them from actually charging for installation. Every plan
I’ve seen provides free installation in exchange for signing a year’s contract or
just to entice you to sign up. If you’re situation is unusual or requires several
trips to reconﬁgure your outside DSL connections, they still shouldn’t charge for
installation. If the technicians start coming into your house, especially after
ﬁnishing the installation, you will almost always get charged. Keep ’em outside,
and you can avoid paying because the problem will be their fault. Bring them in
the house, and it will cost you, because the problem will be your fault (at least in
their eyes).
Your DSL modem, at least in most cases, will cost you a few dollars per month.
You can choose to buy your own DSL modem, but there’s little reason to do so. If
you rent the DSL modem from your service provider, they have to provide
support and updates. One plan I saw asked for $3 per month, but set a price of
about $200 per modem. Getting technical support is easier if you have the
“standard” DSL modem. The ﬂip side is that the service provider must repair or
replace your DSL modem if there’s a problem. Many of the people I know,
including me, have needed a DSL or cable modem replaced. Pay the rent and
you’ll almost always come out ahead.
If you have a second phone line for your computer’s dial-up connection, and
choose the least expensive ADSL product, the two prices may actually wash out.
Yes, you may be able to get ADSL and the 384 Kbps downstream speed for about
the same price as your wheezing 56K modem.
Second telephone line: $22–$28 per month (including fees).
ADSL basic service: $25–$30 per month.
Looks pretty close to me.

Chapter 3 ✦Types of Broadband Providers 69
With a ﬁnancial arrangement like that, how can you not justify ordering
broadband this minute? Or at least read the next section and the next chapter to
see which broadband makes the most sense to you.
Broadband from the Cable Company
Over the past 30 years, the cable industry built an enormous network. This is
good and bad. It has great reach, but as the phone companies found out with
their digital loop carriers and other ADSL–resistant repeaters, sometimes the
choices of the past complicate the future. The early cable network components
often hinder introduction of new broadband services over cable.
Cable companies have different regulations and government restrictions to deal
with than telephone companies do. Because of the expense in building out cable
plants, (the network of cable wiring all over a city), cable companies usually get
a monopoly granted from the city in question. Unlike the situation with AT&T
and the Bell companies in 1984, there’s been no move to break up the cable
companies. Therefore, there’s no move afoot to force them to support services
from competitive companies and give them access to the actual cable network,
as the phone companies have been forced to do.
So unlike DSL, where you usually have a choice of providers in an area, your
choice of broadband from a cable company is limited. Either you want service
from the cable company in your area, or you don’t. A few cable companies are
starting to partner with national provider such as Earthlink, America Online, and
MSN, so keep an eye out for those. It will still be the same cable, of course, but
you’ll get a different Internet service provider brought in to provide the Internet
functions like e-mail and handle technical support.
Don’t think of this as wrong or right, just realize it’s different. You may not have a
choice of broadband service providers over cable, but you have a choice of
broadband service providers reaching you through other methods such as the
telephone network, satellite, and wireless. But now it’s time to examine how
broadband over cable works.
How broadband over cable works for you
Like the telephone company network, the cable network follows the same
centralization philosophy. Although the phone companies call their collection
points the central ofﬁce, cable companies call theirs the head-end. Same
difference, although there tend to be more central ofﬁces than head-ends
because of the distance limitations of telephone wire.
Unlike the telephone company, the cable companies use a common cable with
multiple homes sharing access to the same cable. For cable TV, this works ﬁne.
Your cable box ﬁlters the right frequency based on your channel selection,
and your TV receives that channel. All channels are streaming by down the
cable, and you pick the one you want. When your neighbor picks a different

channel, there’s no interaction between you and your neighbor, as shown in
Figure 3-4.

Figure 3-4: Electrically, the cable system is one long wire reaching from
the distribution center to your home, and all users connect across this
long wire.
Traditional cable systems replicated the broadcast TV model but transmit
signals on speciﬁc radio frequencies over the cable rather than through the air.
Unlike with the telephone network, there was no need to support information
ﬂowing upstream from the customer to the cable head-end. They sent the TV
stations down the cable, and you chose which channel (frequency on the cable)
you wanted.
Honest cable executives will admit the history of cable development includes
two large mistakes:
✦Fixating on a one-way network early on
✦Burying their cables

Chapter 3 ✦Types of Broadband Providers 71
Adding interactive TV tools became a hot button in the 1980s, and adoption of
that feature set immediately turned existing cable company network hardware
obsolete. In the 1990s, as cable companies starting offering digital cable and
Internet access, most of the one-way equipment was long gone. If you live in an
area where the old cable system can’t support upstream communications, you
have my sympathies. But don’t buy broadband service from that company.
Which brings to mind the second serious problem with some cable providers:
their cables are old, worn, decaying, and out of reach. Need to upgrade a cable
repeater or check to see where a cable is broken? Call the heavy equipment crew
to spend thousands of dollars moving the dirt and concrete off the cable so they
can see it and ﬁx it. Increased use of ﬁber cables to neighborhood nodes will
help, because those can be easily hung off telephone poles.
The head-end station includes the Cable Modem Termination System (CMTS),
the cable equivalent of the telephone switch. Your cable modem, whether for
Internet or TV, communicates only with the CMTS at the head-end station
providing service for your area. The back side of the CMTS connects with the
signals from the TV networks, the Internet, and even the telephone system as
cable companies start offering telephone services.
Your cable modem, as you’ll see in Chapter 8, works more like a Local Area
Network router than a modem. You will treat the cable modem just like you do
your DSL modem: plug it into the broadband connection wire (telephone wire or
coax cable) and plug the other end into your computer or network wiring device.
Cable bandwidth
Coax cables have a maximum bandwidth of either 330 MHz or 450 MHz of
capacity, depending on the type of coax cable used. Networks with a mix of ﬁber
and coax (sometimes called HFC for Hybrid Fiber/Coax) can support up to
750 MHz of capacity. Fiber optic transmitters and receivers increase capacity
regularly, so the 750 MHz capacity limit may be long bypassed if your local cable
company has new equipment.
The available bandwidth is sliced into 6 MHz section for each TV channel.
Upstream and downstream channels both require 6 MHz of frequency room.
Data services on early cable systems allocated two 6 MHz channels, one for
downstream trafﬁc and one for upstream trafﬁc, separated by at least 8 MHz to
keep the channels from interfering with each other.
Tech Bits
Modern cable systems use ﬁber optic cables from the head-end out to
neighborhoods, where they connect to a node for distribution to homes
and businesses. Nodes may be situated to support up to 4,000 homes,
but cable companies design for a load of 10–25 percent for each node.
This means a normal customer count for a node is 10–1,000 customers.
These numbers vary according to provider, so use them as estimates
rather than factoids.
Newer cable systems lean toward offering 30–38 Mbps downstream and
5–10 Mbps upstream bandwidth. Yet up to 1,000 customers can share a
www.it-ebooks.info

72 Part I ✦Determining Which Broadband Is Right for You
30–38 Mbps upstream channel and a 5–10 Mbps channel and still receive their
promised 2–3 Mbps download speeds and 128–384 Kbps upload speeds. That’s
because not everyone is on the network at the same time, and those who are
don’t all try to download Super Bowl highlight videos at the same time.
Nothing stops cable providers from adding more channels to support more
customers or add more speed to downloads or uploads. That said, you as an
individual will have little luck getting that channel allocated, because there is
little room left on the modern cable TV network. Bandwidth, and therefore
channels, is expensive because there are limits to how much is available.
This number matters because you share the cable bandwidth with all the other
999 potential people supported by your node. Remember how DSL people like to
ridicule cable broadband because of local network contention? This is what
they’re talking about, but a properly conﬁgured and maintained cable network
will still provide around 3 Mbps downstream and 256 Kbps upstream speeds.
DOCSIS
Standards turn technology ideas into products, and cable companies are not
immune to that rule. Data Over Cable Service Interface Speciﬁcation (DOCSIS)
became an ofﬁcial standard in March 1998 and deﬁned the market for cable
modems and the equipment to support them at the head-end.
Now up to DOCSIS 3.0, the standard details downstream trafﬁc rates between
27–36 Mbps and upstream trafﬁc rates between 320 Kbps–10 Mbps. The radio
frequency range for downstream is between 50–750 MHz (and up as the
frequency range extends) and 5–42 MHz upstream. Notice the minimum 8 MHz
space between the two ranges.
Tech Bits
Do standards help? Absolutely. The reference Web site Webopedia
(www.webopedia.com) says there were 1.2 million cable modems in-
stalled in the United States in 1998, with an average street price of $245.
The estimate for 2004 is that 24.3 million units will be installed and
they will have an average price of $50 per unit. Big improvement for
consumers.
Whether you think to ask for it or not, your cable modem will be DOCSIS
compliant. The trade group that designed the speciﬁcation includes over
85 percent of the vendors in the market.
Service provider details
Just because you can get cable TV doesn’t mean you can get cable broadband
Internet access. The cable company must add some serious equipment to its
head-end and often to its neighborhood network cable plant to offer Internet
access.
Chances are good your cable supplier does include broadband Internet access,
however. According to most research groups at the end of 2003, active cable
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 3 ✦Types of Broadband Providers 73
broadband customers outnumber DSL customers by almost two to one:
10.5 million to 5.5 million.
Technical support, at least in my area near Dallas, has been good enough to not
notice. They answer when I call; the techs come when they say they will, and
they clear up problems when they say they will. If your cable broadband
provider doesn’t do the same, complain and keep notes.
Distance and Speed
When cable broadband is good, it’s very, very good. When it’s bad, it’s still
usable, but more aggravating.
DSL fans don’t like to admit this, but unless you live close (within 10,000 feet) of
a central ofﬁce or modern remote terminal, you’ll never get the downstream
speed of a cable customer sitting out in the suburbs. Even congested cable
during prime teenager online gaming times provides higher speeds than most of
the ADSL packages customers can order. The speed may not always be
consistent, but it’s always there, and sometimes so fast it will astound you.
Because modern cable installations include a mix of ﬁber and coax cables
distance from the head-end has little impact on the network speed for users. You
don’t need to worry about distance if you use a cable broadband supplier.
Upgrading the cable plant has the added beneﬁt of increasing the speeds to
customers. Many cable companies now advertise they guarantee (kind of)
3 Mbps rather than 2 Mbps downstream speeds. Every little bit helps. Unplug
your cable modem power plug for 30 seconds, plug it in, and see if your cable
system received the upgrade already.
Reliability
Write your own joke: Reliability is to cable as X is to Y. Dogs to cats? Politicians
to honesty? Fish to bicycles?
A cultural touchstone, cable technical and customer service problems permeate
humor because everyone can relate. When Hollywood makes a movie called
The Cable Guy with a psycho main character, you know it’s bad PR for the cable
business. At least it was a comedy, so try and laugh about the stereotype.
I certainly remember the bad PR days when my AT&T (and now Comcast)
broadband cable kept going out for hours every day it rained. But it went out
after the rain, usually the second day of a long rain or the dry day after a rain.
Thanks to a clever technician in the area who looked at the pattern of tech
support calls, I learned what the problem was. A person in my neighborhood put
an electric fence in his yard to help control his dogs. Unfortunately, he put the
fence down on top of the AT&T cable. Every time it got wet and the water soaked
through the ground to the cable, the electrical fence leaked enough current to
garble the cable signals.

74 Part I ✦Determining Which Broadband Is Right for You
Tech Bits
Only Wiley books drill deeply enough to warn you about the catastrophic
mixture of electric dog fences, buried broadband cables, and rain.
To be fair and balanced, there are two reasons you can’t just point to cable
broadband and say it’s not good. You get great bandwidth, and improvements in
the physical network keep increasing uptime and reliability.
I keep a list of every cable outage I experience in the computer address book
with the cable technical support contact information. When you call and say,
“your service was out last Tuesday from 12:24 P.M. to 1:07 P.M.” the online support
person realizes standard excuses won’t ﬂy. And when you track all the service
outages, you can look back and see months and months where you have no
entries whatsoever.
Various reports show a wide range of reliability statistics for DSL and cable
providers. You can’t always be sure who paid for a survey, but you can guess it’s
the broadband provider who came out looking strong in comparison to the
competition. Several studies seem to indicate DSL and cable have a similar
amount of outages, but that cable stays ofﬂine longer than DSL. Your mileage
may vary, so check out the Good, Bad, and Ugly reviews on
www.broadbandreports.com/gbu.
Security
DSL fans point out that cable connections within the same node are on the same
local area network (not exactly accurate technically but you get the idea.) and
therefore are less secure. To a degree, that is accurate. Computers directly
connected to the cable network rather than through any type of ﬁrewall can be
seen by other users. If those computers have any type of hosting services on,
such as ﬁle or printer sharing, others can see them. This used to be the default
for Microsoft Windows operating systems, and many people had security
problems because of their lack of understanding of network setup options.
Microsoft Windows 2000 and XP no longer turn on all their various hosting
services by default, closing some security holes. Many users now have routers
with ﬁrewalls to protect their in-house (or in-business) networks from outsiders.
The ability to snoop around your neighbor’s PC and ﬁnd bank account numbers
has declined greatly.
Speaking of bank accounts, all ﬁnancial institutions with access to their services
via a Web browser use a secure Web link (SSL for Secure Sockets Layer). The
chance of seeing your neighbor’s computer on the local cable loop has dropped,
and if you could, all the stuff worth stealing would be hidden by Web page
security routines guarding the data.
Costs
Most of the costs for broadband access are the same for both DSL and cable. You
will need a DSL or cable modem, and they cost about the same and are often
included in the service price, making it a wash. Service calls tend to be about the
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Chapter 3 ✦Types of Broadband Providers 75
same, especially when dealing with national Internet service providers.
Installation costs are comparable, although again, these are usually waived as
part of signing up for the service.
Everyone wants to discuss the monthly bill, because that’s what you see on a
regular basis. And the winner there is . . . <drumroll> . . . DSL by a nose, thanks to
aggressive ADSL pricing.
Basic ADSL, the 384/128 Kbps version, leads the broadband price parade by
offering regular pricing of around $40 and introductory pricing as low as $20 to
$30 per month. Cable prices bounce between $40 and $60 depending on provider
and whether you have cable TV service from that same provider.
Can I argue that 1.5 Mbps/256 Kbps cable broadband at $50–$60 is a better value
than 384/128 Kbps ADSL at $25? Yes, but that’s a personal decision. If you’re
close enough to get higher speed ADSL for a few dollars, you’ll usually get equal
or better service when compared to a cable broadband connection during peak
personal hours of 5:00 P.M. to 11:00 P.M. If you aren’t close enough for faster ADSL,
less absolute dollars for the ADSL broadband, but more speed per dollar for the
cable broadband, make it your choice of where to spend your money.
Either way you see the situation today, keep watching. I predict prices for
broadband of all types will drop even further.
Summary
The two mainstream broadband service offerings, DSL and cable, come from two
different worlds. Phone companies have a long history of data transmissions
over telephone lines and those companies keep pushing newer and faster
broadband options out the door. Cable includes many advantages, including
almost double the number of paying customers.
Both options provide broadband access suitable for many. If you live in or near a
large city, you will have many provider choices. Picking the broadband service
provider for your situation will be difﬁcult with all those choices, but if you’re
not happy, you can choose again.

he world of broadband doesn’t stop with DSL and
cable, as much as the phone companies and cable
providers would like you to believe that it does. You
have other options.
To be honest, most casual Internet users rely on DSL or
cable and make one of those mainstream choices their
service provider if possible. But both technologies have
service limitations, including distance and the cost of
building a cable and service network to support outlying
broadband clients.
Some folks just live too far from large communities to get
mainstream broadband service. Some folks like to do
things differently from everyone else. Some folks want
an alternative broadband connection so if their cable
goes out for a few days they can keep working.
Building the network necessary to reach every home
with cable or DSL costs more money than providers can
recoup. Satellite and wireless technologies do not need
to run wires of any kind to each customer.
Niche broadband service providers, which includes
satellite even though it’s the most successful, remain
vulnerable to market forces. Great ideas appear from
companies with little money and then those companies
disappear. On the other hand, most new innovations
appeared in some little company ﬁrst and took off and
created a market. Just realize that DSL and cable
broadband providers corner the majority of this market,
making all others ﬁght for customer at the fringes of the
market.

78 Part I ✦Determining Which Broadband Is Right for You
That said, there are a thousand reasons to use an alternative broadband service
provider. And although there aren’t thousands of alternative options, there may
be more out there than you think.
Satellite Broadband
Satellites provide almost all modern electronic communications now in one way
or the other. Network TV signals come down to afﬁliates via satellite. Long
distance telephone calls come down via satellite. Starting in 2003, commercial-
free radio stations come down via satellite.
If you live in the suburbs as I do, near a major city, you may wonder why anyone
would need satellite broadband. And according to DSL and cable companies,
they have already, or will soon, reach the house of everyone in the world who
wants speedy Internet access.
But according to Northern Sky Research (www.northernskyresearch.com),
shown in Figure 4-1, millions of people in the United States and Western Europe
will never get DSL or cable and will have only satellite as a broadband option.
Thus, the need for satellite companies to push their own type of broadband
access.
Figure 4-1: The market research ﬁrm counting potential satellite customer noses.
Studying population and census data, Northern Sky Research reported in
January 2004, that approximately 9.5 million households and small ofﬁces will be
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 4 ✦Types of Alternative Broadband Providers 79
forced to rely on satellite for broadband: in the United States 8.1 million and
Canada 1.4 million. In Western Europe, they estimate 11.3 million households
and 900,0000 small ofﬁces are in the same boat.
One satellite broadband company planning to launch a satellite by mid-2004 says
up to 30 million U.S. homes won’t have an option for DSL or cable during the
next few years. I wish them luck, but it seems the phone and cable companies
are still expanding regularly. However, with the cost of laying down new cable,
the satellite company may have a few years in which people who want
broadband can only look upwards.
Because of the start up expenses, there are no “regional” satellite providers. You
won’t have many choices for satellite service, but you do have two major
choices (one-way or two-way) plus at least two vendors for each choice.
If you run a broadband company, being the only broadband supplier for a total
of nearly 21 million households and small ofﬁces (or 30 million in the United
States if you count those who will have DSL or cable someday but don’t quite
yet) will grab your attention. There are more potential satellite customers in
Western Europe because there are more people and the telecommunications
companies don’t compete nearly as earnestly to increase DSL coverage as they
do in the United States. But even the 9.5 million potential customers in the
United States and Canada seem worth the effort to get a satellite up and ready to
download bad jokes to users across the two countries.
Rural America and the people therein seeking broadband access should see
beneﬁts from the Federal government. The Federal Communications Commission
has a variety of programs to spread advanced telecommunications throughout
the countryside. They focus heavily on satellite, but wireless plays a role as well.
How satellite works
If you or your neighbor has satellite television, you know how satellite
broadband works. Put a satellite dish on your roof, point toward the right
satellite (installers do this quickly, do-it-yourselfers take days), and receive TV
from the stars.
Channel selections, made via a set-top box that looks like the one from the cable
company, are chosen via a remote control from a recliner. The selected channel’s
frequency is then selected and ﬁltered and displayed on your television. Change
the channel and change the frequency to display.
Where a cable TV set-top box selects the proper channel by frequency running
down the cable coax, the satellite set-top box selects the proper channel by
frequency running down radio signals from the satellite. The process is the
same, but the transmission medium is not.
In fact, satellite TV reception technology looks quite a bit like regular broadcast
TV. Signals come through the air, something at your house or ofﬁce receives
those signals, and you select which frequency to view. Of course, the satellite
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
80 Part I ✦Determining Which Broadband Is Right for You
sends higher quality signals and packs more signals into a frequency range
managed by the receiver, but there are more similarities than differences.
Satellite broadband works much the same way, although you don’t have to tune
various frequencies for various Internet and Web addresses. One frequency for
the satellite company is all you need, because you’re receiving a link to a single
Internet service provider rather than multiple broadcast channels.
Notice what hasn’t been mentioned: cables or wires. Unlike DSL or cable
broadband access, satellites provide service to a large section of the
country while avoiding the costs of running cables to every home. That’s
much cheaper, if you forget about the cost of building and launching a
satellite.
Yet even with the satellite cost, companies offer service to so many millions of
people that the cost per subscriber (or potential subscriber) totals less than
cable or DSL. Or, you can look at the economics and realize the ﬁrst customer
costs $500 million to connect, but the rest are free.
The dish used for broadband satellite is slightly larger than the one used for TV.
Larger perhaps, but once mounted on your roof and pointing toward the south,
you won’t be able to tell the difference between the TV and broadband satellites.
Not that it matters, but the marketing people for the slightly larger broadband
dish claim extra stability through storms, wind, rain, and clouds. True, a larger
dish can catch and use a degraded signal slightly better than a smaller dish.
If you have an advanced satellite receiver, you can send information to it; for
example you could purchase a pay-per-view movie from the satellite provider.
But didn’t the box holding the satellite equipment say only “Receiver” on it, and
not transmitter?
Receiver is what the box said. Satellite TV receivers are receive-only. To
communicate with your satellite TV provider, you have to plug in a phone line to
your satellite set-top box. Any information from you to the satellite provider
goes over the telephone line.
You can get along quite well without an upstream data path when you watch
satellite TV. The telephone line connection makes it easy for your children to
order pay-per-view when you’re not around (a good reason not to have it). I
don’t have an upstream telephone cable attached to my satellite set-top box, and
I get along ﬁne. (The kids may tell a different story.)
The choice to add an upstream link doesn’t matter all that much for satellite TV.
But if you’re looking for Internet access, you must have an upstream data ﬂow. As
you can see in the next three sections, there are two ways to send data upstream.
Setup basics
Every satellite vendor requires you to install a satellite dish facing to the south.
Two-way satellites, because they have transmitters, must be installed by a
certiﬁed technician. You can install one-way units yourself, but professional
installation will get you up and running more quickly.

Chapter 4 ✦Types of Alternative Broadband Providers 81
When I ordered satellite TV, my system was installed and running in
2 hours. My next-door neighbor installed his own. I saw him on the roof
ﬁve different times and noticed the satellite dish in three different places
before he got it all working.
The satellite vendor will provide (or sell) you a satellite modem to connect your
computer to the satellite feed. It may be internal modem or an external modem
like all the DSL and cable modems. You will connect the modem to your
computer via an Ethernet cable, like the DSL and cable modems. A few new
systems use the USB port for connection.
If you order home satellite service, you may not get a router or other way to
connect more than one computer to the satellite modem. If that’s the case, you
must use Windows peer-to-peer networking to share access to the satellite
connection.
See Chapter 11 to get started with peer-to-peer networking software and
conﬁgurations. Chapters 14 and 15 show how to connect via wires or
wirelessly.
If you have a one-way satellite system, you will need to have a functioning
modem and telephone line for upstream communications. You don’t have to
have a dedicated phone line for your Internet connection, but it helps keep
peace in the family.
One-way systems
Early on, all the satellite broadband services were one way: satellite download at
broadband speeds, and computer uploads through a dial-up connection at
56 Kbps maximum speed. The ratio between the two seems lopsided, with
download around 400 Kbps versus upload at 56 Kbps.
Yet if you look back at the discussion about how much people upload versus
how much they download, the ratio isn’t terrible. Not great, perhaps, but not
terrible. After all, when you send a Web address like www.broadbandbible.com,
you’re sending only 22 characters plus some address and formatting
information. A few hundred bytes go up, 50,000 bytes come down. Not a bad
ratio for most Web users.
Westband Networks, shown in Figure 4-2, makes some compelling points for the
advantages of one-way satellite systems. It wasn’t long ago that one-way systems
were the only systems, and the vast majority of satellite users still have a
one-way system.
Here’s how one-way satellite works during an Internet session:
1. You connect your dial-up modem to the access number provided by your
satellite broadband service.
2. You open the browser or other application that will connect to the
Internet.
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
82 Part I ✦Determining Which Broadband Is Right for You
Figure 4-2: One of the one-way satellite vendors.
3. Your modem uploads the request to the satellite provider acting as your
Internet service provider.
4. The requested Internet material is routed through the satellite by your
service provider.
5. Your Internet information downloads through your satellite, your satellite
modem and appears on your computer screen.
Basically, the idea is pretty simple: requests go up through your dial-up
telephone connection, and come back through the satellite. Early cable Internet
services worked the same way before the providers upgraded their equipment
to handle two-way communications.
A normal Internet user (if there is such a thing) will surf perfectly well over a
one-way satellite broadband connection. However, there are limitations to this
technology.
Maximum satellite download speeds are increasing as more satellites come
online and technology improves, but you shouldn’t ﬁgure on much more than
400 Kbps in the short term and at the lowest price point. This speed equates to
the low-end ADSL speeds discussed in Chapter 3.
Issues with one-way systems include the following:
✦Download speeds lower than cable or higher-speed DSL
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 4 ✦Types of Alternative Broadband Providers 83
✦Minimal upload speeds
✦Telephone line required
✦Difﬁculty sharing the upload telephone link with multiple computers
✦Small upload bandwidth pipe to support multiple concurrent users
✦Higher cost of satellite hardware over DSL and cable broadband
✦Weather interference is rare but guaranteed at some point
These issues aren’t killers for most people. And if satellite broadband access is
your only option to upgrade beyond a dial-up telephone link, you may smile and
consider these points completely irrelevant. And you’d be right, because any
broadband is better than the best dial-up Internet access.
The primary advantage for a one-way satellite system is money. Two-way
systems require a more complicated and expensive satellite dish that is able to
throw your upstream signal 23,000 miles into the air to reach the satellite. That
upgraded dish includes an upgraded price tag. If money plays an important role
in your broadband satellite choice, the one-way systems will always cost less, at
least for the next few years.
Two-way systems
Second generation satellite services added a transmitter to the receiver for
two-way communications. Just like DSL and cable broadband, you can now
download and upload information to the Internet via the same connection.
The leader in this market, DirecWay (www.direcway.com), shown in Figure 4-3),
is a division of Hughes Network Systems, the giant military and industrial
satellite provider. It sells direct, through retailers, and through a variety of
computer and satellite TV resellers.
Advantages for the two-way systems include the ability to talk on the phone
while surﬁng and the less complex one-step method for getting to and from the
Internet.
Disadvantages for the two-way systems include the higher prices and the
relatively low-speed uplink. In fact, the upstream throughput for two-way
satellites only equals or slightly betters that of using a dial-up link for the
upstream information. In some ways, as you’ll see when we talk about latency in
the next section, the two-way satellite can be slower.
One big advantage for the two-way system is the primary vendor: DirecWay. They
have deep pockets behind them (Hughes) and a large dealer network helping to
ﬁnd new customers. DirecWay was one of the pioneers in the area, starting with
one-way satellites and has moved almost completely to two-way systems.
The DirecWay DirecDuo takes advantage of its sister company DirectTV. One
company provides for satellite TV and broadband Internet access. You can
upgrade an existing service by adding a second dish, or you can start fresh and
get TV and Internet on one dish.

Figure 4-3: A leading two-way satellite broadband provider.
Latency
Latency is just a fancy word for delay. Even the fastest broadband connections
speed-wise can have latency issues. You measure latency on a round-trip basis,
so delays introduced by network equipment, such as routers, ﬁgure into the mix
and are blamed for all the latency (by the vendors of cable).
For DSL and cable broadband, latency may be a slight annoyance but is rarely
serious. For satellites, however, the long distances often introduce painful
latency issues.
Satellites used for two-way broadband are in geosynchronous orbit 23,000 miles
above the Equator. That’s a long way from Cleveland. If you hit the Enter key in
Cleveland to download the latest Browns football news, here’s what happens:
1. Your request goes up 23,000 miles to the satellite.
2. The data packets travel 23,000 miles down to the satellite switching
station to connect to the Internet router.
3. Your request goes over the Internet to your Cleveland Browns fan Web
site.
4. Your information comes back from the Web site to the satellite switching
station.
5. The data packets go up 23,000 miles to the satellite.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 4 ✦Types of Alternative Broadband Providers 85
6. The data packets come down 23,000 miles to your dish.
7. The data packets arrive through your satellite modem and the requested
Web site appears on your screen.
Total that up and you get over 92,000 miles of travel distance. That doesn’t count
the miles in Cleveland.
Each round trip to the satellite takes between 700 to 1300 milliseconds according
to satellite vendors. Standard Internet Protocol (IP) Web-handling routines start
to assume the page request has been lost or disconnected after about
800 milliseconds and often send a second page submission because of the
behind-the-scenes timeout caused by latency. You receive the page and your
browser rejects the copies of the page coming in, but delays creep in while
handling all this work in the background.
The diagram in Figure 4-4 shows the long route for your football ﬁx Web page
request. Your house, your satellite provider’s earth station, and the Browns Web
page host may be just about anywhere, but they aren’t the parts causing any
serious latency.

One-way satellite vendors jump on this and remind potential customers that
using a telephone line for the upstream connection rather than the satellite
drops the latency time down to around 400 milliseconds, providing you with
your Cleveland Browns football ﬁx in a shorter amount of time without
behind-the-scenes timeouts.

chances, or use another detail to help make your decision.
Tech Bits
Web page caching uses special servers to hold copies of requested pages
locally. When a second person asks for the same page, the provider al-
ready has it and doesn’t need to fetch it from across the Internet again.
This gives the second client a faster Web page update than the ﬁrst client.
Caching works well on sites with heavy trafﬁc, such as major news sites
and online retailers. Dynamic sites, such as auction pages, change too
fast for caching to provide any beneﬁt.
High-speed games, such as various shooter games like Quake and Doom, suffer
from this latency. In fact, it can kill you, but you can click the Replay button and
come back to life. Games that require less urgent trigger ﬁngers work ﬁne over
most satellite links.
Service providers
There aren’t many service providers in the satellite world because satellites are
so expensive. I mentioned DirecWay, so let me show you the Web page for
StarBand (www.starband.com), its primary two-way broadband competitor.
(See Figure 4-5.)
Figure 4-5: Another two-way satellite broadband provider.
Because satellite broadband companies are national, you will have to deal with a
national Internet service provider. You may also be offered satellite Internet by

Chapter 4 ✦Types of Alternative Broadband Providers 87
various hardware and software partners, such as PC makers or AOL, but they
will be reselling one of the major satellite providers rather than starting their
own satellite service.
Resellers of satellite broadband may or may not tell you they will hand you over
to the national provider when you sign your contract. Going to a national
provider rather than a regional reseller means that someone probably already
grabbed your GreenDuck username.
Support for the Internet parts of your service will come from the satellite
provider, through their national technical support centers. Your local reseller
will provide the installation and physical support if needed, and intercede on
your behalf if there’s a problem with the satellite provider.
Availability
If you can mount a satellite dish (these are fairly small, remember) that points to
the south, you can get satellite broadband service. This wide coverage provides
broadband hope for the 21 million who may never get DSL or cable because they
are too remote.
Satellite providers can reach the following locations:
✦Continental United States locations (DirecWay)
✦Continental United States plus Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin
Islands with optional equipment (StarBand)
People often believe only the lonesome ranch house and mountain cabin are
potential customers for satellite service. Not true, at least not anymore. Suburbs
often lack the demographics to attract DSL and/or cable service providers.
Service providers for DSL and cable may be horribly inept and the horror stories
from your neighbors have scared you away. You might order satellite Internet
access when you order your satellite TV service to save money on the package
deals some providers offer.
Unlike with DSL and cable, you won’t have to worry that your side of the street is
too far away or serviced by obsolete signal repeaters. The continental United
States gets excellent coverage, as does Western Europe stretching down into
Africa. Anywhere a huge TV audience awaits, satellite coverage will beam them
down their TV. And, in most cases, providers will also use a few transponder
circuits on the satellites to sell broadband Internet access.
Every satellite vendor will say it over and over, but a southern exposure is
mandatory. No clear look to the south (for those of us north of the equator)
means no satellite broadband.
Speed
Early satellite broadband options topped out at 400 Kbps “burst” mode. When
the marketing literature quotes burst mode speeds, you can bet dollars to
donuts you’ll see that speed once every few months for no more than 7 seconds.

88 Part I ✦Determining Which Broadband Is Right for You
Newer satellites, and improvements in the ground-based equipment sending and
receiving signals, bump the speed up enough for basic levels. Providers claim
that the standard speed for the least expensive service is 400–500 Kbps, and
that’s fairly accurate. Some services offer 800 Kbps and higher speeds into the
Megabits per second range, but that usually means you’ve wandered onto a
sales page for large businesses.
Satellite is a shared bandwidth system, like most Internet connections. Only so
much trafﬁc can go through each satellite channel, and it’s pretty much
impossible to add new channels to existing satellites. Think of this like the
capacity of a highway that reaches a tunnel: you can expand the highway to
support more trafﬁc much more easily than you can expand the tunnel. The
news stories you’ve seen about the shuttle ﬁxing satellites were rare, and those
were mostly military satellites. So the capacity the satellite had when it went
into service is about all you’ll ever get.
WildBlue (www.wildblue.com) is the company with plans to launch a satellite
by the summer of 2004. It promises 1.5 Mbps downstream because the satellite
will use new generation Ka band technology. The company Web site promises
upload speeds “up to 256 Kbps” but offers no particulars. However, higher
upload speeds with a new generation of equipment seem plausible.
This is a nice segue to a question that some of you are asking as you read. Is it
better to get the one-way since it’s cheaper, or will upload speeds for two-way
increase enough to make it worth the extra money.
Satellite upstream speeds will increase, as promised by WildBlue, but dial-up
speeds probably won’t increase. Although the two options run neck and neck
upstream today (slowly, but each about as slow as the other), the future leans
more toward the two-way system taking the performance crown in another year
or two.
If you want to use a satellite link back to the ofﬁce through a Virtual Pri-
vate Network (VPN), you may be disappointed. Corporate VPNs encrypt
each packet, and this stops the satellite broadband service from being
able to batch packets together and send them in one burst. Updates
in the future may change this, but be aware and alert your corporate
data communications group if you plan to use a satellite for your remote
access back to the ofﬁce.
Reliability
The Internet service with a satellite broadband provider is always on when you
ask your computer to go to a Web site. Satellites stay in orbit and won’t wander
away from your antenna’s aim.
That said, there are a few things on the ground that will cause your satellite
broadband some problems. Heavy rain, especially when thunderstorms have a
frighteningly large amount of lightning, will blank out your connection for a
moment or three. Heavy, wet fog and snow will cause problems. One-way

Chapter 4 ✦Types of Alternative Broadband Providers 89
satellite vendors tout the availability of their service to run over dialup as an
advantage when two-way satellites are blocked by weather.
On the other hand, if your geosynchronous satellite suffers a complete failure,
your personal broadband service will be gone as well. There aren’t enough extra
satellite slots to accept an entire service provider’s client list in addition to
regular customers. Failures are rare and make the news because they are so rare.
Don’t let this issue stop you from signing up for satellite broadband.
Security
For the truly paranoid, rejoice in the fact that no one can wiretap a radio signal
stream going from you to your satellite. Attempts at intercepting your stream
and rerouting that stream would cause problems on your end. Don’t consider
the fact that “they” could tap into your cable from the satellite on the roof to the
satellite modem inside.
The more normal among us should realize that using a satellite for broadband
Internet access neither helps nor hurts standard security precautions. Although
you beneﬁt from the fact that no one really can wiretap a satellite stream, your
trafﬁc on the Internet doesn’t change because the ﬁrst hop from your computer
went up on a satellite.
Viruses and spam come down from the satellite just as easily as they come from
the phone or cable company. Your satellite broadband provider may offer spam
and virus ﬁltering, but using the satellite doesn’t offer any advantages over what
any other broadband provider can accomplish.
You must take the responsibility to handle your spam and viruses, and
I’ll tell you all about that in Chapter 7.
Costs
Satellite hardware costs extra for every satellite I checked. Sometimes the costs
are high, sometimes not so high. But all satellite vendors will ask you for at least
$150 for the hardware, and usually another $50–$100 for installation.
Warning: Jokes about the costs of satellite broadband access being sky
high will not be tolerated.
Okay, that’s all, I promise.
One-way satellite providers charge less upfront for their equipment. Prices range
from $150 to $200 from most vendors.
Two-way satellite providers charge more upfront for their newer, more
complicated equipment. Look for an initial payment of at least $500 and
sometimes up to $800 depending on the type of equipment and speed of
broadband service. Once installed, the monthly service fees start from $50 or
up. Prices are, of course, always subject to change. Some basic offers, with
limited bandwidth (250 Kbps downloads) and a single e-mail account are testing
the waters under $40 already.

90 Part I ✦Determining Which Broadband Is Right for You
To offset the more expensive equipment and the steeper upfront charges, the
two-way companies offer plans with less money down ($100–150) along with
higher monthly payments until the difference is covered. You’ll lose a few dollars
by paying a setup fee or initiation fee (whatever they choose to call it), but you
will avoid the upfront charges.
The one-way satellite systems obviously require a working telephone line for the
upstream communications. The two-way systems advertise the amount of
money you save by avoiding that telephone line charge.
My guess is that satellite will always be the highest cost broadband service. The
initial equipment investment for the broadband provider is too steep to drop
the price down to DSL and cable levels, at least for the next few years. Besides,
the primary customer for satellite broadband service is the person or small
business outside the reach of DSL and cable. With no competition, prices tend to
stay up.
Community Wireless
Satellite broadband providers might make a mistake watching as DSL and cable
providers keep gaining on the underserved areas. Although they’re looking one
way, wireless broadband providers are sprouting all over the place.
You’re surrounded every day by wireless data coming and going: in to your TV,
out from your cellular phone, in to your radio, and out through your PDA. And
wireless broadband service providers are popping up in some of the same
places that lack DSL and cable that the satellite service providers hope to have
all to themselves.
Radio waves have plenty of bandwidth to support broadband speeds. I’ll show
you how to set up a wireless network in your home in Chapter 15. With bigger
antennas and special frequency tricks, the entire neighborhood (or at least the
28 square miles around an antenna) can connect through wireless broadband.
Many small wireless service providers are popping up to take advantage of new
technology and lower equipment prices. Some may call themselves a Fixed
Wireless Broadband (FWB) service provider, while others may call themselves a
Wireless Internet Service Provider (WISP). Check listings at Yahoo and Google as
well as your local advertisements to ﬁnd these providers.
Unlike satellite service, wireless broadband access doesn’t disappear in bad
weather. The frequency ranges used by the providers cut through rain, fog, ice,
and snow.
How wireless works
Wireless broadband service providers use a variety of technologies to keep the
radio bits ﬂying between them and their customers. I could put pages of
explanation here about frequency hopping, frequency hopping spread spectrum,
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Chapter 4 ✦Types of Alternative Broadband Providers 91
direct sequence spread spectrum, and multichannel multipoint distribution
service, but instead I put the technical reference details and links at
www.BroadbandBible.com, if you’re interested.
Let me focus on the two technical details that determine how you place your
antenna and how you determine if you can get service from a wireless
broadband provider: Line of sight (LOS) and nonline of sight (NLOS).
Line-of-sight wireless networks
One provider in the Dallas area near me sums up the idea of line-of-sight wireless
networks simply and clearly: “If you can see our tower, then you can get service”
(www.itgbroadband.net/HowWorks.htm).
Somewhat like satellite, line-of-sight broadband service requires an antenna of
some sort on the outside of your building. They tend to be not quite a foot
square and ﬂat like a pizza box. Another antenna option is about a foot high and
four inches wide. Those antennas point toward a tower in the distance or a
wireless hub (base station) on another roof within a couple of miles.
Ofﬁcially, what some people call antennas are really transceivers because they
transmit and receive radio signals. They are relatively low-powered (putting out
no more power than a cell phone) and must be placed at least 12 feet above the
ground. A wire from the transceiver runs into the home or ofﬁce and plugs into a
wireless modem with an Ethernet connection. One computer can be plugged into
the modem directly, or a router may provide ﬁrewall services and allow an entire
network of computers to receive wireless broadband information.
Drive around your neighborhood and look at house roofs. When you see
a square white box or what looks like a cricket bat, that home uses a line-
of-sight wireless provider. If the provider is smart, the company name is
on the antenna. If the company didn’t display its name, you may have
to knock on the door and ask the people which company they use for
wireless broadband service.
Towers available for wireless broadband use are all over the place, mostly to
support cellular telephones. It’s difﬁcult to tell the difference between an
antenna for a cell phone on a tower and that for wireless broadband, but it
doesn’t matter. The combination of relative height, easy mounting, and electrical
power exist all around you on towers, billboards, buildings, water towers, and
even fake pine trees.
Frequencies used by wireless broadband providers are usually either 2.4 GHz
or 5.8 GHz. Both frequencies offer strong signals and employ a variety of
technologies to avoid interference with other wireless products.
Nonline of sight wireless networks
As one might guess from the name, nonline of sight networks don’t need to have
a clear view of the next transceiver to receive service. They do sometimes,
however, need an outside antenna if the service depends on reﬂected signals, for
example, in areas with tall buildings bouncing the signals around.

92 Part I ✦Determining Which Broadband Is Right for You
In an area covered by a nonline of sight provider, a small modem with a stubby
antenna beside your computer usually gathers all the signals necessary. If you
have a wireless router or access point in your home or ofﬁce to provide local
area network service without wires, you know what these modems look like. The
new generation of wireless broadband modems is actually smaller than the
wireless networking products you bought last year.
The biggest advantage for nonline of sight providers is the avoidance of sending
a technician to install and conﬁgure a transceiver on your home or ofﬁce. Most
providers in this market send you the modem via FedEx or UPS and you plug it
into your computer or existing network and turn it on. If you’re in the signal
range and do a couple of simple conﬁguration steps, you’re in business within
about 5 minutes.
Service providers
Barriers to entry are low for wireless broadband providers, at least compared to
the costs of launching a satellite or stringing wires all over the countryside. The
ﬂip side of low barriers to entry is that small companies appear and disappear
with startling frequency.
Wireless broadband access is the exact opposite of satellite access. Although
the technology forces satellite providers to cover entire countries, wireless
technology forces those providers to cover areas neighborhood by
neighborhood. The modern wireless broadband access provider is as local as a
diner and includes customers from about the same area.
Wireless broadband service providers do all the same things that all other
broadband providers do: provide access, connect to the Internet through
multiple high-speed connections for redundancy, and provide e-mail and
personal Web support. The major difference is the lack of a national wireless
carrier, although many national providers advertise wireless service.
Finding a list of current, up to date wireless broadband providers is nearly
impossible. Every list I located contained a huge number of dead links and
references to companies now long gone. The best I can ﬁnd so far is TheBoost at
theboost.net/interspeed/wireless/index.htm. (See Figure 4-6.)
Most market analysts predict that sooner or later the giant national companies,
especially those with cell phone networks, will start buying up successful
regional wireless broadband providers. That certainly makes economic sense,
since both technologies rely on multiple transceivers in service areas. Because a
major regional wireless provider will have maybe 5,000 subscribers, they are
susceptible to buyouts.
Availability
In the short term, before the national companies buy up the regional wireless
access providers, you can take steps to help provide service to you and your
neighbors. There are multiple guerilla wireless networks around the country,
although most seem based in California.

Chapter 4 ✦Types of Alternative Broadband Providers 93
Figure 4-6: Provider listings including many wireless broadband services.
The idea is simple: a mesh network with many transceivers provides high
speed and network redundancy. But the cost of putting up all the transceivers
is so high that providers have trouble getting the network rolled out
completely. Yet customers adding transceivers to their homes and businesses
spread the network range, so people partner with their regional wireless
provider.
By keeping the cost down to roll out transceivers, the wireless provider saves
money. Individuals and businesses get a reduced rate because they support the
network. Some groups take this so seriously they band together and have turned
this into a huge movement of like-minded groups to make “wireless for the
people” a reality. Check out the Association for Community Networking at
www.afcn.org, shown in Figure 4-7.
Just as peer-to-peer networks changed the music industry (see Chapter 1), so
has the availability of inexpensive wireless networking products changed
Internet access. Why limit a hotspot of wireless access to a coffee shop when
you can make your entire neighborhood a hotspot? If you think that way, you’ll
love the community network movement.
Distance and speed
Distances for wireless broadband providers are limited by the number of access
points and transceivers. As the data packet ﬂies, however, you must be within
4 to 6 miles of an access point to get connected.

Figure 4-7: People connecting wirelessly.
Speeds are easier to list. You can go as fast as you can pay for, or slow enough to
keep it within your budget. Here are some of the speeds offered by various
wireless service providers, listed by downstream Kbps/upstream Kbps:
256/128 Kbps
384/128 Kbps
768/128 Kbps
768/256 Kbps
1800/384 Kbps
2500/500 Kbps
3000/1000 Kbps
3000/3000 Kbps
4500/4500 Kbps
You can see a wide range of speeds upstream and downstream are available. If
you really need three times T1 speed (4500 Kbps) you can get it, depending on
your provider.
Reliability
Line-of-sight systems need to keep a clear view between your location and the
tower with the access point. Breaking that line for any length of time causes
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 4 ✦Types of Alternative Broadband Providers 95
interruptions. Placing the transceiver on the roof or at least out of the way of any
ground obstruction solves that part of the reliability issue.
Most wireless broadband providers avoid using frequencies susceptible to
weather interruption. That doesn’t mean that all wireless options are guaranteed
to work regardless of the level of rain or snow in the area. But satellite
broadband access resists all but the worst weather, and wireless broadband
resists interruption even more strongly.
Nonline of sight systems have an advantage with their ability to connect and
communicate with multiple access points at one time. This mesh network
design, commonly used in community networks, maintains connections even
when one or two transceivers go ofﬂine for any reason.
Security
You may have heard horror stories about war driving where people drive around
with a laptop, a wireless transceiver card, and a Pringles can to intercept data
communications from unprotected companies. Those problems are caused by
poor wireless local area network setup, not wireless broadband. Besides, in
Chapters 15 and 17 I’ll tell you how to secure your wireless internal network and
frustrate all the war drivers.
Since your providers supply the access points (their transceivers) and your
transceivers (either attached to your building or sitting on your desk), they can
securely conﬁgure communications between the two devices. Base stations,
where the wireless provider connects the wireless network clients to the
Internet, have authentication and authorization routines to verify that every
connected client has been authorized.
Most providers encrypt all data over their wireless links. This is possible
because they conﬁgure both ends. Rarely do they encrypt to such a degree that
the CIA couldn’t break the encryption, but they lock up data transmissions well
enough that no casual eavesdropper will have a chance to decode the messages.
Control over the authentication process makes it possible to lock out any other
systems in the area trying to spoof your computer’s details and log into the
network under a false identity. Such methods won’t work, because security
protections include keying transceivers to the receiving antenna so only
authorized client-based equipment will be authorized for access.
Don’t worry about someone stealing your data because you have a wireless
broadband provider. Thieves will ﬁnd it easier to break into your home or ofﬁce
and read your ﬁled papers than to grab your data out of the air.
Costs
Costs for wireless broadband access can range from nothing (see the community
networking information in the Availability section) to hundreds of dollars for
installation and up to hundreds of dollars per month for access fees. Between
the two points there exists a wide range of speeds and fees, as you might
imagine.

96 Part I ✦Determining Which Broadband Is Right for You
Low speed wireless works hard to keep the costs down in the range of DSL and
cable. Many wireless vendors offer packages competitive with ADSL, such as
384/128 Kbps for $30 or so. Your numbers may vary depending on your provider
and your chosen speeds. If you want T1 (1.5 Mbps) or above speeds in one or
both directions, you will spend hundreds of dollars per month. But you will
spend less if you ordered a physical T1 to your location, so that’s an advantage.
Wi-Fi hotspots: public 802.11b
Nothing goes with a cup of expensive coffee like expensive Internet access, does
it? At least that’s what many coffee shops are telling us, and people seem to be
buying both the coffee and the Internet access.
This type of wireless networking, although public, doesn’t work the same as
wireless broadband services. Yes, you can get broadband speeds in your coffee
shop. Yes, you connect wirelessly. But you do all this with the same equipment
and technology you use at your home or ofﬁce and your personal wireless
network.
Chapters 15 and 16 cover the performance and security concerns of using public
Wi-Fi hotspots for Internet access. But for now, let me tell you that my paranoia
pushes me to only read my e-mail from a Web page with security. This ensures
that my connection to the Web e-mail server is encrypted with the same level
of technology used by banks for online banking. I feel better, and you probably
will too.
If you travel quite a bit and access the ofﬁce constantly from the road, please,
please, please use a strong password on your computer itself and an additional
one on your application to connect to your home ofﬁce. Otherwise, the next time
you lose your laptop, you’ll have to replace it and change every remote access
security setting at your home network.
Summary
Satellite providers cover the world; wireless providers cover the neighborhood.
That’s plain but true.
If you’re outside the range of DSL and cable, satellite or wireless broadband are
your only real options over dialup. You can choose two-way satellite service if
you’re willing to pay the premium over one-way satellite service. And you can
become only a customer of your wireless broadband provider, or take an active
part in expanding wireless access to your neighbors.

t’s hard to run faster and jump higher when you’re
dragging an enormous telephone company or cable
operator along for the ride. Many of the promising new
ways to deliver high-speed broadband to the home
bypass the telephone and cable companies. One
emerging method sends broadband over wireless up to
31 miles (WiMax), one sends broadband over the
high-power lines running into your neighborhood
(Powerline) and another brings a ﬁber optic cable right
to your doorstep (Fiber to the Home).
Why aren’t the incumbent broadband carriers leading
the charge to 100 Mbps broadband? Money.
Any economist who protects the status quo in a market
will point a ﬁnger toward those with the majority market
share. The mantra, “protect our investment,” drowns
out the call to keep pushing forward. If telephone and
cable companies made a move to Fiber to the Home,
they would lose billions and billions of invested dollars
in copper wire strung on poles and buried in the ground.
Worse, they would suddenly be on equal footing with
small upstart companies determined to eliminate
copper wire as a delivery mechanism.
Market transitions hurt those caught in the vise of
supporting the majority market share while ﬁghting off
competitors offering new services. The companies that
deliver 100 Mbps of broadband delight to our homes
may well not be the ones delivering 1 Mbps to us today.
That’s tough on them, but the customers, meaning you
and I, will ﬁnally get broadband that completely
envelops us with the speed and services it delivers.

Fiber to the Home and Ofﬁce
In a bizarre twist of modern electronic fate, those who want optical ﬁber to their
home should move to the farm, or if not the farm, then to tiny Kutztown,
Pennsylvania, or Huxley, Iowa. Those folks have ﬁber optic lines running into
their houses, and the rest of us don’t have even a waiting time for Fiber to the
Home.
Other names for this technology include Fiber to the Premises (FTTP) and a
variation called Passive Optical Networking (PON). Sometimes people throw in a
“broadband” in front of Passive Optical Networking to make it BPON. Cornell
University has an institute named the Advanced Fiber Networks (http://afn
.johnson.cornell.edu/institute.php) so they call the process AFN.
Although I see the advantage of Fiber to the Premises to include business
customers, Fiber to the People has a nice, Declaration of Independence
feel to it, doesn’t it? So you and I will know that FTTP has changed from
Fiber to the Premises to Fiber to the People.
And the people are getting the message and pressuring their city leaders to
make something happen. Provo, Utah, home of multiple computer technology
companies over the past three decades staffed by students from the local
universities, has its own ﬁber-to-the-people project underway called iProvo
(see Figure 5-1).
Figure 5-1: Provo makes Fiber to the Home a city service like water, electricity, gas,
and sewer connections rather than an added outside service.

Chapter 5 ✦Emerging Broadband Service Options 99
Many fans of the idea of pulling Fiber to the Home talk about details, such as the
ease of installation and lower cost of adding ﬁber to the list of services provided
to every home. If you build the network correctly, they say, you don’t need to
pull phone wires and cable wires and ﬁber, you just pull ﬁber and run all the
phone, cable, and Internet access services through the one ﬁber connection.
Most of the data and voice services today, especially in new neighborhoods and
developments, run copper wire only from homes to collecting points for each
area. Remember the phone company remote terminals and the cable company
nodes? Those connect upstream to their assorted central ofﬁces and head-end
switches over ﬁber in most cases. Running new ﬁber to customers rather than
new copper wire doesn’t cost all that much extra.
The trick is to organize the ownership details of all the new ﬁber to the people
projects correctly, according to a variety of academic and technical experts. Let
the city own the actual ﬁber connecting to houses, but let Internet service
providers and phone companies and cable companies provide services to
customers over those city-owned ﬁber connections. Service providers pay the
city a cost-plus fee based on traditional public works projects, and the people
get wonderful buckets of broadband for a good price.
How ﬁber works
The “how” is simple: rather than running separate copper wires for the telephone
and cable TV and cable broadband connections, you run a single ﬁber optic
cable. In Figure 5-2, the Fiber to the Home Council (www.ftthcouncil.org)
lists some of the new projects underway.
Figure 5-2: This page lists new developments, but you should also check
Case Studies under the FTTH information button.

100 Part I ✦Determining Which Broadband Is Right for You
Any service provider that would ordinarily run copper wires to a home or
residence can choose to run ﬁber instead. The upstream network must support
ﬁber connections all the way to the central ofﬁce or head-end or Internet Service
Provider, but most systems run ﬁber from collection points anyway. The
difference is running Fiber to the Home or ofﬁce building to support more
bandwidth and offer more services.
Coordination between service providers often gums up the works of a deal for
Fiber to the Home. Rather than the phone company and cable company running
two different types of copper wires out to your house, they must work together
at the central ofﬁce or head-end to connect their service to the ﬁber network
running out to the homes. Large entrenched monopolies tend not to play well
with others, which brings us to the real items gumming up the works: lawyers
and politicians.
Tech Bits
One research report counts over 400,000 Fiber to the Home connections
with paying customers worldwide, but only 50,000 are in the United
States.
There are four types of Fiber to the Home wiring options. Each leans toward one
feature or another, such as less ﬁber cable needed or easy access for
competitive service providers.
✦Home Run Fiber, also known as Point-to-Point or Single Star
Architecture: Each ﬁber connection for each customer runs all the way
back the central ofﬁce. This requires the most ﬁber cable and the most
optical termination equipment at the central ofﬁce, but also offers the
most ﬂexibility for service providers located at the central ofﬁce.
✦Active Star: Remote nodes with active electronics support from four to
1,000 customers and link via a shared feeder ﬁber optic cable back to the
central ofﬁce. This option offers less bandwidth and ﬂexibility for each
user.
✦Passive Optical Network (PON): Similar to the Active Star but with only a
passive splitter at the remote node rather than an active switch. Saves
the setup ﬁber cable runs and is less expensive due to lack of switches at
the remote node collection points.
✦Wavelength Division Multiplexing Passive Optical Network (WDM-PON):
Similar to the Passive Optical Network described previously, but with more
wavelengths on each ﬁber cable to increase bandwidth and provide more
service provider ﬂexibility. However, this raises the cost of the ﬁber used
and the electronics needed to light those ﬁbers for data communications.
Building the network with home-runs from each central ofﬁce to each customer
would cost too much to be palatable in the near term. Because municipal ﬁber
network projects for customer broadband access piggyback off municipal needs
for ﬁber connections around the city, the local government will dictate the
network architecture. Cities or public utilities build a ﬁber network backbone
around the area to connect and control services, such as the electric utility,
water and sewer controls, or trafﬁc signals.

Chapter 5 ✦Emerging Broadband Service Options 101
Once the ﬁber gets back to the central ofﬁce (or head-end if you prefer), different
providers can offer their services. Each provider has its own services to offer,
but all go to the customer over the one ﬁber to each customer. Think of this like
one road leads to your house, and you choose whether FedEx or UPS brings
special packages to you.
Politics
More American fortunes have come from some form of public media than any
other source, if I remember one of the economic experts correctly. It doesn’t take
a stretch of the imagination to believe that statement when you look around at all
the television and radio stations. See any going broke? The companies leveraging
those publicly allocated monopolies (frequencies) for their own products, like
record companies, advertising agencies, television production studios, and
major sports leagues seem to gather money like dryers gather lint. Count the
telephone companies in as a publicly allocated monopoly as well, even though
they get right of way for their wires rather than a frequency for their TV stations.
Whenever large piles of money gather, large companies, lawyers, and the
government regulators gather as well. Fiber to the Home exacerbates confusion
because one tiny ﬁber cable can carry all the television, radio, and telephone
connections in the city to the customer.
Do you regulate Fiber to the Home as cable TV? As a telephone company? Is it
still regulated as cable TV if the cable company offers telephone service over
that link? This can get messy.
The push for municipalities and public utility districts to lay the foundation for
Fiber to the Home ran smack into the lawyers and lobbyists for phone
companies and television conglomerates.
Four cases so far have been bumped up to the Supreme Court. Three cases
resulted in favor of letting municipalities run the ﬁber network and sell retail
services, directly or wholesale, the bandwidth required to let third-party service
providers sell the services over the municipal network. One case went against
the rights of municipalities to provide retail or wholesale telecommunications
services.
According to Lightwave Magazine (www.lw.pennnet.com), as of December 2003,
the following organizations were delivering Fiber to the Home:
Competitive local exchanges (45.3 percent)
Municipalities (20.4 percent)
Developers (16.7 percent)
Public utility districts (11.6 percent)
Incumbent local exchange carriers (5.6 percent)
Regional Bell operating companies (0.4 percent)
Frankly, I’m a bit surprised at the high number of customers serviced by
Competitive Local Exchange Carriers (new telephone companies) and

102 Part I ✦Determining Which Broadband Is Right for You
developers. I’m not at all surprised at the nearly nonexistent fraction of the
market served by old-line telephone companies (Bell spin-offs). They’re the ones
with all the copper wire in place. The fact that DSL, and sometimes only slow
DSL, is the only broadband that wiring network supports is our tough luck.
Telephone companies won’t write off their huge investment in all their installed
wiring until they’re forced to do so. That won’t happen anytime soon.
Laws regarding municipalities offering ﬁber to home
The role of the status quo is to maintain itself, meaning it must squash
competitors before they become a threat. Such is the rule of the economic
jungle, and the world of Fiber to the Home is no exception. Municipalities getting
into the Fiber to the Home business, even when it makes great sense, steps on
the market toes of the incumbent telephone and cable companies.
Nine states have laws restricting municipalities from providing retail or
wholesales services on a telecommunications network they build, including
Fiber to the Home:
Arkansas
Florida
Minnesota
Nevada
South Carolina
Tennessee
Texas
Utah
Washington
Three states have overturned laws restricting municipalities from building a
ﬁber network to allow pilot projects to proceed:
Missouri
Nebraska
Virginia
Individuals can do little in this ﬁght. If you have a chance to make your voice
heard by writing a letter or e-mail to a local, state, or federal ofﬁcial, please do
so. The earlier list in the politics section tells you how much Fiber to the Home
you and I will get if the big telephone companies get their way and they block
cities from building out ﬁber networks and renting bandwidth to service
providers: 0.4 percent. Enough to say they are rolling out a pilot project, but
never enough to give us, the customers, real broadband at high speeds.
Coverage areas
Physically, the coverage area of Fiber to the Home includes any location within
33,000 feet from a central ofﬁce (30,000 from the central ofﬁce to a passive
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 5 ✦Emerging Broadband Service Options 103
remote node, then 3.000 feet more to the home or ofﬁce). Although you may not
be within 6.25 miles of a central ofﬁce or remote node, I bet some type of city or
public utility service is closer than that to you. Power lines come right to your
house, so ﬁber can piggyback on them.
In essence, every home or business with any connection to municipal services or
a public utility device can be within a broadband coverage area. That’s assuming
the world works in favor of the little guy, the one sitting at home waiting for real
broadband. In real life, unfortunately, the little guy better be sitting on a street
where a ﬁber to the home pilot test is underway if he wants to be connected.
Developers, especially in high-end neighborhoods, now regularly run ﬁber to
each home they build. When done during construction, the incremental cost of
adding ﬁber to the home adds little to the price, and provides a great selling
point. But connecting to service providers able to take advantage of that ﬁber
connection depends on your location. If there’s no trial project close by, you are
out of luck.
Trials in progress
Many cities jump into the ﬁber to the home movement because the city leaders
realized something critical: bandwidth for homes and ofﬁce, the kind of
bandwidth ﬁber cable connections provide, is becoming a necessity. Companies
looking to move in or expand look carefully at the telecommunications support
in place. Because the traditional broadband providers, telephone and cable
companies, are playing hard to get (and trying to block the municipal ﬁber
networks in court), the only entity large enough, and able to beneﬁt from such
improvements, is the local municipal government.
Tacoma, Washington, has 65,000 people who can get ﬁber connections today
out of the planned 184,000 when the rollout is complete. Only about 10 percent
of those homes eligible have so far opted to pay for broadband cable service
from one of four different service providers or one of the two cable TV
providers.
One of the largest trials in the United States is the Zipp Network in central
Washington state. The Grant County Public Utility District formed more than 50
years ago and installed ﬁber cables ﬁrst to manage its own electrical service.
The iProvo project mentioned earlier passed the bond election to fund
broadband buildout. 32,000 homes and businesses should beneﬁt before too
long.
Back in California, the city of Palo Alto plans to deliver video, voice, and data
over a Fiber to the Home network to 26,000 residents (see Figure 5-3). Part of the
incentive is to replace much of the city’s legacy network and communications
facilities.
I can’t go on without mentioning the exciting, but poorly named, UTOPIA project
in Utah. 18 cities, anchored by Salt Lake City, are planning to build an ultra-high
speed network, using municipal ﬁber. The Utah Telecommunication Open
Infrastructure Agency estimates it will cost around $470 million and cover

75percent of the population of the state of Utah. The following list shows the
ﬁgures for Utopia:
Total population: 723,933
Total households: 248,791
Total businesses: 34,580
The details about UTOPIA (the one in Utah, not the idyllic land) can be seen at
www.utopianet.org. They may claim the prize as largest project by far, if the
numbers all check out and the plan doesn’t crash and burn.
Cities are ﬁnding they must offer modern communications links, just as they
must offer good schools, fair taxes, and a low crime rate. Developers must not
show potential, say, warehouse clients only a site with easy access to highways
and rail roads, but also high-speed communications networks. Fiber to the Home
isn’t quite a commodity everyone expects to have, but it may reach that point in
this decade.
A good trend for Fiber to the Home is that some of the major telephone
companies are deciding to join them rather always than ﬁght them (in court).
BellSouth, SBC, and Verizon adopted a set of common technical requirements for
implementing Fiber to the Home. Only 10 percent of all business in the United
States currently have access to a ﬁber-based Internet service provider.

Chapter 5 ✦Emerging Broadband Service Options 105
And those little farm towns that had ﬁber back when your cable picture was still
fuzzy? They’re rocking along. Kutztown, Pennsylvania, has over 5,000 people,
and supports the Kutztown University. Huxley, Iowa, is gradually replacing the
copper pairs from the phone company to with ﬁber connections for each of the
600 customers in town.
The Fiber to the Home Council counts 94 communities in 16 states up and
running toward Fiber to the Home. Size ranges obviously swing to both extremes
and cover from a few hundred to nearly a million customers.
Speed
Fast.
How fast? Faster than you imagined the ﬁrst time.
Speed estimates run from 10 Mbps (like old-fashioned Ethernet coax cable
supported) to gigabits per second. Which do you believe? Yeah, me too. Early
project customers will be lucky to get 10 Mbps connections at all. There may be
a time when you and I have a choice between 100 Mbps and 1 Gbps (GigaBit),
but I doubt either of us will have a chance for even 100 Mbps during these next
few years.
In fairness to the Fiber to the Home proponents, the choice between 10 Mbps
and 1 Gbps means an enormous increase in costs. Higher speeds force the use of
more expensive equipment up and down the network. Realistically, putting all
the foundation equipment in place for 10 Mbps will cost a fortune for high-end
optical cards, memory, and network switches. Our best hope for Fiber to the
Home is to eagerly buy 10 Mbps connections to get the project rolling and
proﬁtable, and let the providers upgrade components over time to higher
speeds.
Everything, as always, depends on the service providers and how fast they want
to take their customers down the broadband road. But if they want to open the
throttles and let people have super broadband, I’m all for that.
Reliability
Once installed, ﬁber cable doesn’t suffer from electromagnetic interference no
matter how many other cables are around it. And, if your electric dog fence
shorts out when wet, the broadband over ﬁber services will stay up despite the
rain.
Fiber to the Home won’t cause any reliability problems and in fact will prevent
quite a few. Any problems will be at the remote node point or more rarely in the
central ofﬁce where the various service providers make their connections.
Problems there may affect many customers, lending urgency to troubleshooting.
Although tiny and thin, a single strand of ﬁber optic cable can withstand a fair
amount of torture by being wrapped in strong insulation. Conduits are great and
probably necessary for protection, and you can stuff in all the other wires for a
www.it-ebooks.info

106 Part I ✦Determining Which Broadband Is Right for You
home, such as electrical and telephone (at least until the ﬁber replaces the home
phone telephone wires in a few more years.).
Security
Fiber optic cables can’t be tapped easily, and eavesdropping will be nearly
impossible. The security from your home to the central ofﬁce will be as good as
anyone can hope for. Electronic switches or optical transceivers at the remote
terminal can be intercepted, true, but it would take some real work and quite a
bit of time.
Normal caveats apply here. After your computer(s) are on the Internet, typical
security procedures must be followed (antivirus software, ﬁrewall, and so on) or
you will be sorry.
WiMax
The quickest way to describe WiMax is “wireless broadband.” Sporting data
speeds much higher than the normal wireless options detailed in the previous
chapter, WiMax connects Wi-Fi hotspots to the Internet over a range up to 31
miles of linear service area range. A shared data rate up to 70 Mbps, as well as
nonline of sight installation options, makes WiMax an interesting new technology.
Figure 5-4 shows the ofﬁcial site for the WiMax standards development team.

Chapter 5 ✦Emerging Broadband Service Options 107
Ratiﬁed by the appropriate standards committee in early 2003, the ofﬁcial name
for WiMax is IEEE 802.16. (IEEE is the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers.) Deﬁned as a wireless Metropolitan Area Network, WiMax has the
strong support of Intel, Nokia, and Proxim as its primary proponents along with
a large group of other wireless vendors. By collecting various Wi-Fi hotspots,
WiMax can cover an entire city without requiring too many transceivers and
towers. Some feel (or at least hope) that WiMax will offer inexpensive high-speed
wireless to entire communities.
You may see some reference to 802.20, and think it’s WiMax as well. Not exactly.
That’s the standards label for mobile broadband wireless access, a group trying
to develop ways to deliver broadband to moving users, such as those in cars and
trains. 802.16, WiMax, is a ﬁxed wireless technology.
How WiMax works
Designed to be a do-everything ﬁxed broadband wireless access (sometimes
called BWA) system, WiMax started with a frequency range between 10 GHz and
66 GHz. An improvement already in the works will include frequencies between
2 GHz and 11 GHz. That’s a lot of frequency with plenty of room to avoid
interference and support multiple high-speed channels at one time. In other
words, it is enough wireless bandwidth to provide broadband. Some reports
already reference WiMax as 802.16a up to 802.16e for added frequencies and
improvements.
Plans are grand. Pop open your laptop or PDA 30 miles from the base station and
get a minimum 2 Mbps broadband connection. Connect wirelessly at high speed
everywhere in the city, not just at the coffee shop.
That’s the plan, at least. For the next few years WiMax users will have to
connect a wireless transceiver (the pizza box on the building) and wire that
to an internal Ethernet network. Power requirements for WiMax transceivers
remain too high for laptop and PDA use, but remember the primary backers
of WiMax: companies selling chips and other hardware to support wireless
communications. A generation or two of WiMax products will bring size and
power requirements to a range comparable to today’s Wi-Fi levels.
Coverage area
Big. Thousands of users over a wide area can be supported by a single base station.
The long reach (30 miles) from the ﬁxed wireless base station offers great
advantages for developing areas. One of the primary WiMax backer, Nokia,
obviously knows some tricks in voice communications. With the bandwidth
available from WiMax equipment, there’s plenty of room for voice channels as
well as data. One base station, conﬁgured properly, can instantly become the
telephone switch for an entire small city.
“Last mile” problems to connect homes to broadband service providers can be
solved by WiMax. Although Wi-Fi (802.11b) can transmit at speeds up to 11 Mbps
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

108 Part I ✦Determining Which Broadband Is Right for You
(best case) up to 1,000 feet, blanketing a neighborhood with Wi-Fi will require far
more access points in the area than providers want to pay for. However, a single
base station per large neighborhood can be a good value for delivering
broadband.
Wireless options for the last mile don’t require two critical components: physical
wires to the home or ofﬁce, and a truck roll to connect them. Just as with some
wireless broadband providers today, a WiMax customer in the future may be
able to buy a home transceiver at the store, plug it into their computer or home
network, and get WiMax service. That level of installation service from the
broadband provider (basically nothing) makes the provider happy. It also keeps
the price down, because the service providers don’t have to amortize hundreds
of dollars of installation costs over your monthly contract.
Trials in progress
Unless you’re British, you’re not going to see WiMax anytime soon. There have
been a few trials scattered around the United Kingdom, including ways to use
WiMax to let train passengers maintain their wireless Internet connections
through their entire journey.
One planned test in central Georgia will get started sometime in 2004 if all goes
well. What must go well includes someone putting up about $2 million for the
necessary WiMax towers and transceivers. Keep an eye on what people are
saying about WiMax at the ofﬁcial standards site: www.ieee802.org/16/
pub/buzz.html.
Speed
Total bandwidth for WiMax could be up in the 70 Mbps range. Whether that
ﬁgure will be reached per base station or for a total area remains unproven.
The few vague plans for service rollouts mention just enough speeds to beat
ADSL but not much more. Business early adopters would see about 2 Mbps,
while consumer pioneers will be allocated about 400 Kbps. If you think that
sounds suspiciously like the numbers of ADSL and cable broadband access, the
two primary competitors for jumping across the last mile to the customer, I
agree.
Reliability
There’s nothing to judge WiMax on yet except very early trials and vendor tests.
However, if we accept the fact that wireless systems using many of the same
technologies as WiMax have good reliability records, we can convince ourselves
WiMax will be just as reliable, if not more.
The long reach of every base station makes WiMax less expensive to deploy, but
more vulnerable to an outage. If all customers within 30 miles in any direction of
the base station lose their connections because of a problem with the tower
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Chapter 5 ✦Emerging Broadband Service Options 109
transceiver, every customer will be out of luck. The likelihood, especially early
on, to add redundant WiMax towers and base stations will be low. In a few years,
areas served by WiMax will have multiple base stations and the ability to move
customers if their primary contact drops. So if you have WiMax today and your
signal stops, it won’t take more than two or three years to rollout more WiMax
base stations in your area.
Security
Wireless systems always make some people (okay, me) nervous when speaking
of security. After all, every wireless systems broadcasts, by deﬁnition,
everything you’re doing on the network to the world or at least the part of the
world within range.
Nothing special is decided about WiMax security. It makes sense to extend the
Wi-Fi security technology to include WiMax, but logic doesn’t always rule in
these areas. We’ll have to wait and see what we get, but my money’s on the Wi-Fi
security model.
Powerline Broadband
What copper wires come into every home and business? Telephone and
electrical lines. What hasn’t been exploited for broadband yet? Electrical lines.
Running data over home electrical lines has developed into a strong, viable
option for wiring home and ofﬁce networks. Chapter 14 will cover that option in
depth.
“Power Grid” broadband points to another option of data over electrical lines,
such as using the electricity distribution network to distribute data. Sometimes
called Digital Powerline Technology, sometimes Power Line Communications,
and sometimes Powerline Communications, the goal is the same: piggyback data
on the high-power electrical transmission network.
Electrical companies have been using narrowband signals over their power grid
for control purposes for years. Although reliable and well tested, the
narrowband technology used by the power companies themselves offers too
little bandwidth to help consumers.
As a proof of concept idea, however, their own narrowband control technology
gives the power companies a leg up on some of their competitors. And because
power grids are ubiquitous, the last mile problem disappears.
How Powerline broadband works
Voltages across the power grid run up to 35 kV, far above the 120 volts in the
normal U.S. home. Lower voltages for home use are created by step-down
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
110 Part I ✦Determining Which Broadband Is Right for You
transformers located near the line endpoints. Powerline developments focus on
the middle voltage range because that’s what feeds the transformers for home
and business voltage delivery. The transformers come within 100 yards of most
of the homes and businesses in the United States.
There are two ways to encode data packets to travel across the modern
Powerline network:
Digital Spread Spectrum (DSS) passes through line equipment such
as transformers and is therefore less expensive to deploy.
Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) does not pass
through line equipment, but works better through noisy electrical
sources, impedance changes, and the multipath loop problems
created by the Powerline network.
Most likely, third-party broadband service providers will administer the service
across the platform supplied by the power companies. That’s already the case in
Manassas, Virginia, which introduced the service early in 2004.
Trials in progress
Manassas Virginia offers “real” Powerline service, although it just started late in
January of 2004. Cities in Georgia and Colorado have signed up for the service,
but are not yet installed as I write this. Figure 5-5 shows one of the private
companies helping to test powerline networks with real customers.
Figure 5-5: Broadband delivery through your power plugs.

Chapter 5 ✦Emerging Broadband Service Options 111
Several projects are underway, but just barely. Look for news coming out of
Colorado and Missouri. There has been quite a bit of work in Brazil as well.
Developing areas beneﬁt greatly when technology allows them to acquire more
than one service at a time, and broadband over power lines does that. After all,
every country trying to grow out of the “developing” tag needs power, so power
line availability is a safe assumption.
Speed
A combination of data transmission technologies, such as the OFDM mentioned
in the How powerline broadband works section along with Ethernet methods
used to determine successful packet delivery, add up to some decent speeds
across the Powerline network. Inside the home or ofﬁce, a maximum speed of
14 Mbps is standard. The Powerline grid itself supports speeds up to 45 Mbps,
and that may increase to 100 Mbps as the technology gets ﬁne tuned over time.
Consumer options to this point are limited to around 1 Mbps. This puts
Powerline broadband into the same area as DSL and cable, plus or minus a little
depending on your supplier.
Another nice point is the performance upstream from Powerline broadband
customers. Speeds upstream are the same as the speeds downstream.
Companies, large and small, with their own Web and e-mail servers can relax
knowing their upstream information ﬂow to customers is as fast as their
downstream ﬂow.
Reliability
Every service in the world of computing wants to compare itself to the electrical
service in the United States. Whenever you hit a switch, you expect lights, and
are almost never disappointed.
Just because the broadband signals go over power lines doesn’t mean that
broadband service will be as reliable as the power itself. Extra equipment and
different technologies are at work to provide broadband, making it different
enough from electrical power to take away all guarantees.
However, I doubt anyone with Powerline broadband will have less service
uptime than those on cable broadband. Even DSL has more outages than the
electrical company.
Security
Security details are sketchy, probably because the Powerline broadband
technology hasn’t been around long. Several documents outlining planned trials
and reports from Manassas mention security but give no details.
HomePlug network devices, the ones inside your home or ofﬁce running data
over power lines, do offer some security options that I’ll detail in Chapter 14.

112 Part I ✦Determining Which Broadband Is Right for You
Whether the Powerline broadband groups pick up on that security technology
or not hasn’t been decided.
If you’re lucky enough to get a connection in one of these trials or early adopter
programs, assume you have no security on the line. At least assume you have
the same security concerns as you do on a shared cable broadband installation.
Summary
Broadband isn’t standing still. New ways to deliver the high-speed broadband
experience you deserve to your home or ofﬁce are cooking at this very moment.
And the good news is that you don’t have to rely on the telephone or cable
companies, those hotbeds of crawling pseudo-innovation, to be the ones to
bring you faster and better service.
Where will you get your broadband in a few years? I’m guessing a combination of
Fiber to the Home when you’re stationary and WiMax when you’re traveling. But
I’m an optimistic guy, so it may be more than just a few years.

any people have multiple broadband service
provider choices. With that good fortune comes
a nagging worry: what if you make the wrong choice?
First, like the old joke says when updated for new
network technology, bad broadband service is a lot
better than no broadband service.
Second, if you don’t make the best choice, you’ll still
make a good choice. Every broadband service option
described so far in this book will make your Internet
access better than ever before.
Finally, no decision you make here is binding forever. In
fact, technology will improve so much over the next few
years that you will need to rethink your broadband
service option in two years no matter what you choose
today.
Get your pencil, get ready to make some decisions, and
by the end of this chapter you will have a good idea of
the best choice for your broadband service needs. And
if that service isn’t available in your area, you’ll still get a
good broadband experience. Then update your decision
in a year or two as new options become available to you.

114 Part I ✦Determining Which Broadband Is Right for You
There is no hidden agenda in the fact that cable starts the list for your
broadband service options checklist. Something had to start, and cable comes
earlier in the alphabet than DSL, satellite, or wireless. Feel free to go through the
DSL checklist ﬁrst, and if DSL gives you the comfort level you need, sign up for
DSL and don’t look back. But if you want to check around just a little, just to be
sure, this is the place to do so.
Decision Points for Your Comparisons
Cable and DSL broadband vendors all ask for your address to verify that they
can deliver service to you. The screens always include plenty of marketing and
sales excitement, but that’s to be expected. Figure 6-1 shows the search screen
for EarthLink, a national service provider of all types of broadband service.
Figure 6-1: Type in your address to see if you win the “broadband available” prize.
Interestingly, EarthLink told me I couldn’t get cable broadband access at my
location, even though I received the information over my Comcast Cable
Broadband service. This only means that Comcast handles its own service
provider chores and doesn’t feel the need to allow EarthLink to share its
customers. EarthLink did offer me DSL and satellite wireless broadband access,
however.
How do you know where to check for broadband access? The best search Web
site I know for this, www.broadbandreports.com, not only shows you the

names of local broadband providers, it gives you the feedback from your
neighbors using those services. (See Figure 6-2.)
Figure 6-2: I scrolled partway down the window to show service providers and
user comments.
If you’re interested primarily in cable, the National Cable and
Telecommunications Association (www.ncta.com mentioned earlier) includes a
service locator based on your address. It correctly found the Comcast service
listing for my address.
How to compare service features
You not only choose a way to connect your home or ofﬁce to the Internet via
broadband, you also choose your service provider. Make sure you feel
comfortable with access speeds, service provider features, and restrictions
before you sign on the virtual dotted line.
First, you must verify you can get some type of broadband service at your location.
There will be a few poor souls unable to connect to anything due to a collision
of bad luck factors such as distance, southern exposure, and no local wireless
service provider. All I can suggest for those folks is to learn the joys of patience.
Figures 6-1 and 6-2 show two methods of ﬁnding names of service providers in

116 Part I ✦Determining Which Broadband Is Right for You
You must prioritize your broadband service requirements. List, in order, your
three or four most important broadband service qualiﬁcations, as in the
following example:
✦Speed
✦Spam and virus e-mail controls
✦Reliability
✦Free phone support
Don’t feel bad if your list differs. What’s important to you may not be as
important to me and vice versa. Your list might just as easily say:
✦Cost
✦Web mail application to read e-mail via a browser when traveling
✦Dial-up number for backup
✦Personal Web pages included free
There is no “right” list, period. Whatever you feel is most important is most
important for you. But prioritizing before you make your decision will help
narrow your choices.
When doing product reviews for magazines, I have to assign a score in
ﬁve or six areas of product evaluation. Those areas are weighted, so that
a 9 rating in performance counts more toward the overall score than
a 10 in installation. This thinking assigns more weight to the features
assumed to be more critical and important.
If one service provider offers the world’s greatest features in an area you care
nothing about, don’t let that outweigh another service provider with good
scores in areas you do care about.
Look at the opening screen of www.broadbandreports.com/gbu for their
“Good, Bad, and Ugly” list of broadband provider reviews. If a local provider
consistently appears in the Horror Story column, you may want to keep looking.
Pros and Cons for Cable
Cable broadband access subscribers outnumbered DSL subscribers about two
to one at the end of 2003, but those numbers vary, depending on who tallied the
numbers. Surprisingly, the numbers reported by the cable industry don’t exactly
match those provided by the DSL industry. One might be tempted to think the
statistics reﬂect a wee bit of bias.
Cable companies have had longer to install the huge network of cables to reach
homes and businesses in the United States, which you would think gives them
an advantage. But many of the early cable systems didn’t support two-way
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 6 ✦Pros and Cons: Choosing Your Best Broadband Option 117
Internet access until upgrades added that functionality. Similarly, the telephone
companies have wires to every home and business, but also had to overcome
earlier technical difﬁculties that restricted broadband service to many
customers.
Placing your cable modem at the termination point of your interior cable wiring
may not be the best place for your computer. Cables terminate in great locations
for televisions, not computers.
Competition for broadband access between the cable and telephone companies
gets more pointed every day. Add local telephone service over cable networks,
and you raise the competitive stakes even higher. This is a good time to be a
broadband customer looking for a service provider.
Current coverage areas
Typical suburban homes, cable’s prime grazing area, are almost guaranteed to
have a ready cable connection. According to numbers from the National Cable
and Telecommunication Association (www.ncta.com) and from research
company InStat/MDR (www.instat.com), here’s how cable coverage areas work
out (numbers are rounded):
✦108 million: Total U.S. households
✦103 million: Occupied households passed by a functioning cable
✦73.5 million: Basic cable (or above) subscribers
✦12 million plus: Cable broadband subscribers
✦60 million: Total number of cable-ready homes that can get broadband
from their cable provider
Looking at the numbers, it appears that about half the homes capable of getting
cable TV can get broadband access through their cable provider. It appears
the cable companies still have a serious number of network upgrades left to
complete. It also appears 5 million customers will never get cable broadband or
cable TV, making them prime candidates for satellite service.
If your housing development sprouted less than 20 years ago, you will almost
certainly have cable access. If it sprouted less than a decade ago, you may have
extra features above and beyond cable, such as Fiber to the Home options.
Decision checklist
When evaluating your cable service provider, use this list when going through
their sales material and check off the items they meet or don’t meet. After you’re
done, go through and see which of these are dealbreakers for you. If none are,
you can then decide the cable service provider will give you the broadband
service you need, or you can run through checklists for your other options for
comparison.

Pros and Cons for DSL
Most DSL industry reports admit cable broadband access providers have more
total subscribers than the DSL broadband providers. However, they claim (and
provide research numbers to back them up) that their DSL subscriber base
grows faster than the cable subscriber base. In other words, new broadband
users pick DSL over cable.
Jupiter Research (www.jupiterresearch.com) covers broadband from a
variety of angles and lists a big reason that DSL growth now outpaces cable
broadband subscriber growth: money. Interviewed dial-up customers were
asked about moving to broadband. At $29.99 per month, nearly half (47 percent)
said they would be somewhat or very likely to get broadband within a year. As
prices rose, broadband interest dropped. By the time Jupiter asked about a price
of $44.99, around the cost for many cable broadband providers, only 22 percent
of dial-up customers felt broadband would be a good ﬁt for them.
The two major broadband service providers never make life easy on you. At $30,
you get the slowest ADSL broadband service, generally 384 kbps downstream
and 128 Kbps upstream. Better than dialup, but slower than cable. Is four to
seven times the download speed, which cable broadband provides, worth
50 percent more ($30 up to $45)? Only you can determine whether the speed
difference is worth the cost difference for you.
One good thing about DSL is your ﬂexibility inside your home or ofﬁce. When the
cable technician comes to install a broadband cable connection, you’re likely to
be stuck with a less than optimal connection location. After all, the cable will
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 6 ✦Pros and Cons: Choosing Your Best Broadband Option 121
terminate where the television (or home theater focus point) belongs, not where
your computer belongs.
DSL service works on every telephone outlet in your home or ofﬁce connected
to the number hosting DSL. Most homes have telephone outlets all over the
place, but certainly in great places for computers like dens, ofﬁces, bedrooms,
and even living rooms. Although there’s no reason to move your DSL modem and
router (if you have one) after installation, placing it anywhere there’s a phone
jack can make initial installation arrangements much easier.
Current coverage areas
Market research reported that at the end of 2003, the four major telephone
companies could offer DSL of some type on nearly 152 million telephone lines.
The largest two carriers, Verizon and SBC, claimed 37 percent and 36.4 percent
of those lines, respectively.
Because there are now over 280 million men, women, and children in the United
States, the telephone companies have one DSL-capable line for every two of us.
But they continue to face competition from cable, satellite, and wireless
broadband service providers.
Businesses hopped on the DSL bandwagon, with a 40 percent jump in DSL
lines to businesses between the end of 2002 and 2003. That adds up to over
3.7 million DSL business connections. DSL-friendly prognosticators estimate
the number of DSL business lines will grow to around 6.3 million by the end
of 2007.
Here’s a breakdown showing DSL coverage in the United States. There appear to
be millions more homes supported by DSL than are supported by cable, but I’m
not sure that I believe these numbers. In my experience and those of people I
contacted, the telephone lines may be ready according to the phone company
but the word hasn’t gotten over to the DSL sales department. However, the
phone companies are running to convert every line possible, so the 152 million
number may not be a lie, it just may be a future truth.
108 million: Total U.S. households
152 million: Telephone lines able to support DSL
8.2 million: DSL customers in the United States
This all means that if you don’t have DSL coverage now, you should very soon.
Remember, there are 108 million households in the United States at the start of
2004, and nearly 152 million DSL lines to serve them.
Just like cable broadband providers, various DSL providers offer Web sites
where you can put in your phone number and address and see if you can get DSL
service, and which speed of DSL. The screen in Figure 6-3 is typical of DSL
providers.

122 Part I ✦Determining Which Broadband Is Right for You
Figure 6-3: Type your address to see if you win the “broadband available” prize,
this time with DSL.
In my case, I can get DSL but only the slowest ADSL variety. But I can get SDSL at
384 kbps/384 kbps upstream and downstream. That’s fast enough to support a
mid-level Web and e-mail server for a business.
How to compare service features
Unlike with cable, assuming you’re close enough to the central ofﬁce or a remote
terminal to take advantage of such speeds, DSL gives you multiple options for
download speeds, along with multiple options for the monthly fee.
The speed options for the locationally lucky make your priority listings more
interesting. If speed is your ﬁrst option, fast (close to the central ofﬁce) DSL may
be your best choice.
Refer to Chapter 3. Table 3-4 shows how longer distances cut DSL
speeds.
Remember the opening screen of www.broadbandreports.com and its list of
broadband provider reviews? If a local DSL provider consistently appears in the
Horror Story column, you may want to keep looking for another provider.
Various smaller companies will piggyback on your local telephone company and
provide DSL service, often competing with the telephone company they rely on
completely. Odd situation, but thank the government for at least allowing some
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 6 ✦Pros and Cons: Choosing Your Best Broadband Option 123
competition over the telephone network we taxpayers bought and paid for
several times over.
With this competitor/supplier relationship, the DSL lines into your home or
ofﬁce may support half-dozen different service providers. If that’s the case in
your area, pay close attention to their Internet service provider information. If
the underlying cable and DSL are the same, you would use the service provider
details to help you make your decision.
Decision checklist
Most cable-based broadband service providers enjoy a monopoly, but you
almost always have multiple choices for a DSL service provider. The competing
providers will probably all rely on the same local telephone company for
installation and support, but at least the Internet Service Provider part of their
DSL offerings will be different.
You may want to use two or three different colored pencils if you’re comparing
multiple DSL providers. Or, you may get lucky and all are roughly equal and you
can pick the one with the lowest service charges.

Pros and Cons for Satellite Broadband
Distance from the central ofﬁce or head-end doesn’t apply when examining
satellite service. The node point that gathers customer information for routing
to the Internet is about 23,000 miles away from all of us.
Realistically, the majority of satellite customers are beyond the reach of DSL and
cable broadband service providers, and have no community wireless options.
They turn to satellite as a last resort.
Yes, you can order and receive satellite service even if your home or ofﬁce sits
only a hundred yards from a telephone company central ofﬁce and right beside a

brand new cable distribution box. But people do this so rarely it’s not worth
discussing.
Satellite providers do a good job, and new technology and new vendors getting
into the market will continue to improve the technology. Yet the advantages of
DSL and cable for speed and convenience outweigh the cool factor of satellite
Internet access, especially if the satellite provider still charges $150-$400 for
equipment installation.
Current coverage areas
Good news: If you’re in the continental United States, and can see the southern
sky at about a 45 degree angle, you can get satellite access.
Your coverage checklist is short and simple:
✦Are you in the huge coverage area for satellite service?
❑Yes
❑No
✦Do you have a clear view to the south?
❑Yes
❑No
If both of those Yes check boxes are ﬁlled, you can get satellite broadband
service.
How to compare service features
You have less choice with satellite when comparing service features than you do
any other service. When there is little competition there is little reason for the
vendors in that market to push to provide new and improved features. With
satellite, you pretty much have to take what you can get.
This is not meant to insult the few satellite vendors and their Internet service
provider features. But most people looking at satellite service have no other way
to get broadband service. When your choices are broadband satellite or dialup,
you will probably ﬁnd getting broadband outweighs a missing service provider
feature or two.
Speeds for downloads will not pass the 500 Kbps level for standard satellite
broadband service. If you buy faster satellite service, such as for a business, you
will pay substantially more money for the extra speed. For home and small
business users, ﬁgure the best download speed you’ll ever see is 500 Kbps.
Compare this to 384 Kbps and up for DSL and between 1.5 Mbps and 3 Mbps for
most cable providers.

Chapter 6 ✦Pros and Cons: Choosing Your Best Broadband Option 127
Pay attention to the Terms of Service agreement for satellite vendors if you have
more than one computer. Some basic satellite packages are strictly one-computer
plans. You may have to pay extra or upgrade your access plan if you have
a network of users wanting Internet broadband access through the satellite.
Downlink and uplink details
You have one choice to make: one-way satellite or two-way satellite? If you
choose one-way, you must use a dial-up connection to upload Internet
commands and requests. If you use two-way, the satellite dish includes a
transmitter to allow upstream communications. One-way upstream is tough to
conﬁgure for more than one computer at a time.
Upstream speed compares equally, at least for standard residential satellite
service with the generation of equipment in place. Newer providers, such as
WildBlue (www.wildblue.com), promise high-speed upstream connections, but
they are not yet ready to demonstrate that service.
You have to answer the following questions about upstream:
✦Should you pay more upfront for two-way satellite?
✦Should you save money upfront and keep using dialup for upstream?
Simple question, isn’t it? Again, there is no right answer; there is just the answer
that you prefer.
Decision checklist
There aren’t many satellite-speciﬁc decisions to make. Many customers who use
satellite have no other options.
✦Do you have a clear view to the south for the satellite dish to aim up
about 45 degrees at the satellite?
❑Yes
❑No
If not, skip to the next section on community wireless or back up to
the section on cable and DSL.
✦Does the broadband service provider meet your most important criteria?
❑Yes
❑No
If so, and you’re checking satellite providers as your last hope for
broadband access, none of the rest of the issues matter.
Service-poor broadband Internet access beats service-rich dial-up
access anytime.

Pros and Cons for Community
Wireless Broadband
Some picky wireless reporters claim only WiMax can be considered “community”
wireless because it serves an entire community at once. I call all local wireless
service providers community providers because they are the most local service
providers possible. Community wireless providers are tied to the local
community by the short reach of most wireless technologies in use today.
The local nature of wireless service providers works against community wireless
providers when they are providing services and technical support. Large
regional or national providers can easily amortize support costs over all their
customers, but a local wireless provider may have only a few hundred or few
thousand customers. Such a small installed base won’t sustain 24-hour support
manned by real people, although coordination between wireless providers into
associations helps give them the “big provider” look for many services. Talk to
your local wireless provider and see how it can help you.
Small companies or not, one of the major research groups (InStat) expects the
wireless market to more than double over the next 4 years. By 2007, they expect
the market to hit over $1.2 billion. That’s a pretty big community.
WiMax will jumpstart consumer awareness of community wireless in a big way
with the high speeds and wide coverage area. Even with a 30-mile reach from the
base station, however, wireless remains rooted in the community and is the
most “local” of all broadband access technologies.
Current coverage areas
Local community wireless providers are generally small, local, and not able to
spend marketing dollars like their broadband service provider competitors.
Finding them may be tougher than getting installed and running.
A listing service Web site run by Broadband Wireless Exchange Magazine
(www.bbwexchange.com) does a good job collecting wireless provider’s names
and contact information. In Figure 6-4 I’ve scrolled down to show the map BBW
Exchange provides to drill down and ﬁnd a local wireless service provider.
If you’re interested in getting into the Internet business in some way (outside the
spam offers you get every day), community wireless may be the place for you.
Small businesses with a building to serve as a base station are welcomed by the
wireless community. You can not only make some money but feel good by
providing a service as valuable to others as to yourself.
Security concerns
Some people believe community wireless cannot be as secure as DSL or cable.
Those people are working from incorrect information. (I’m politely saying
www.it-ebooks.info

they’re wrong.) Wireless access of every kind requires different security
procedures than wired connections, but they can be extremely safe and secure.
Chapter 12 dives into ﬁrewalls and other security issues.
Your location’s wireless modem that connects you to the wireless service will be
keyed to that service. Only authorized serial numbers of authorized user
modems will get access to the wireless service. Data between your location and
the wireless provider will be encrypted to a level similar to secure Web browser
connections.
Far be it for me to tell people not to worry about security, but a properly
conﬁgured wireless community network provides as much protection as a DSL
or cable connection. Careless users will always have trouble.
Decision checklist
Fixed wireless broadband service providers vary greatly in the range of standard
service provider amenities they include. A few national service provider ﬁrms,
such as EarthLink, work with community wireless providers, but most of the
service providers in this market provide all services themselves. The good news
is that most wireless providers are local, friendly, and willing to answer
questions.

Service Provider Restrictions
Every Internet service provider includes rules and regulations for its clients,
normally called their AUP or Acceptable Use Policy. Usually the terms of service
list what is and is not acceptable to do while using the system. Providers
sometimes call this Terms of Service (TOS), Terms and Conditions, or Members
Agreement. They can (and do) change these terms at any time.
You will rarely ﬁnd a large headline called “Things You Can’t Do Here” on the
marketing Web sites of broadband service providers. After all, the job of
marketing is to convince you to buy the service, not run you off.
The place to ﬁnd these restrictions is down deep in the service or support
sections of their Web site. Often providers detail some restrictions in their
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) pages. Sometimes they will be hidden on the
support page, and every now and then you can ﬁnd them on the System
Requirements page.
If you don’t ﬁnd the restrictions early on, keep looking. Every broadband service
provider has restrictions, and the one you’re about to sign on with is no
different. Better to ﬁnd out onerous details about service restrictions before you
agree to a year-long service contract.
After you ﬁnd the restrictions, you may ﬁnd they’re just as impenetrable as the
End User License Agreement (EULA) on software products. If you can’t read the
restrictions because the legalese can’t be interpreted by a normal person, you
might want to rethink your choice of service provider. When two providers are
about equal but one offers a common-sense set of restrictions, and the other
looks like a law-school contracts test, sign with the common sense provider. It
will be easier to work with when issues come up later.
Acceptable use policies
If you carefully read the acceptable use policies of most service providers, you
may believe the only thing you can do on the Internet is turn it off. Taking
advantage of the small personal Web page many providers offer adds an entire
new list of things you can’t do.

Chapter 6 ✦Pros and Cons: Choosing Your Best Broadband Option 133
Here are some standard boilerplate restrictions that come from several national
providers I checked. They clearly state YOU WILL NOT do any of the following:
✦Upload, post, e-mail, or transmit in any way any content that is unlawful,
harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene,
libelous, invasive of privacy, hateful, or racially or ethnically
objectionable
✦Harm minors in any way
✦Upload, post, e-mail, or transmit in any way any content that you do not
have a right to make available under law or under contract from the
copyright holder
✦Upload, post, e-mail, or transmit in any way any content that infringes any
patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or other proprietary rights
✦Upload, post, e-mail, or transmit in any way any content that can be
considered spam or junk e-mail in any way, but you can post solicitations
in shopping areas, such as eBay
✦Upload, post, e-mail, or transmit in any way any content with viruses or
any other program that causes problems for any computer hardware or
software or any telecommunications equipment
✦Stalk or harass someone else through the service
✦Collect personal data about other users
There goes almost every forwarded joke on the Internet. According to
this, they’re all against the Terms of Service in one way or another.
This is not an exhaustive list by any stretch. Most policies I checked were almost
three times this long.
Every one of us agrees to play by these rules when signing up for Internet
access. If you sign up to host a Web page, the restrictions become more involved
because hosting companies don’t want to be slammed for holding pornographic
or other illegal material on their servers because you provide those types of ﬁles
on your Web site.
You have no control over how your service provider administers and enforces
these guidelines. Users can, and do, get cut off from their service provider for
breaking the terms of service. Rarely does this happen unless someone, or some
law enforcement agency, asks the service to throw the users off.
However, it is legal for law enforcement to “tap” your connection to your Internet
provider without informing you of the action. Recent laws, such as the Patriot
Act, make it possible for authorities to tap your communications without a court
order.
The vast majority of service providers and their customers never have a
problem, regardless of how many tasteless jokes are sent. But service providers

134 Part I ✦Determining Which Broadband Is Right for You
must put all these restrictions in there to protect themselves in case someone
gets out of control.
Rules on connection sharing
Different service providers have different rules about connection sharing.
Sometimes they put these rules in their terms of service or acceptable use
policies, but sometimes they list those rule separately.
If you have only a single computer that will connect to the Internet through your
broadband service provider, this section won’t matter to you. If you have more
than one computer and you expect them to connect to the Internet at the same
time, you need to check your broadband service provider’s rules on connection
sharing.
There are several ways to “share” your broadband service connection. Linking a
home network to the cable or DSL modem obviously falls into that area. But
service providers set rules on the following:
✦How many user names you can establish
✦How many users can be connected concurrently
✦Whether you can connect via broadband and dialup at the same time
✦Whether premium services (extra access to content) purchased by one
user name can be used by another user name
The trend for service providers is to allow multiple computers on the home or
small ofﬁce network to connect to the Internet concurrently. One reason,
especially for home users, is that service providers want to sell home networking
equipment. And realistically, two or three normal Internet users at one home
generate far less trafﬁc than any type of Web server hosted at the customer site.
Satellite vendors, however, get stickier about concurrent connections. Check
your satellite terms of service if you plan to have multiple computers online at
the same time. At least one vendor charges extra to connect three users through
the satellite link.
Bandwidth hogs
Warning: In a quirk of language, “unlimited” Internet access may not really mean
you can stay connected and upload and download all day and all night. Many
Internet service providers now set a high number of access hours, such as
150 hours per month total (a quarter of the total number of hours in a normal
month) and charge you if you go over that limit. “Always on” service on your end
doesn’t mean providers allow “always using service resources” on their end.
Admittedly, these are primarily restrictions leftover from dial-up providers. Each
connection at a dial-up provider requires a modem at its end to communicate
with the modem at your end. The rule of thumb for service providers used to be
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 6 ✦Pros and Cons: Choosing Your Best Broadband Option 135
seven users for every modem. You can see that if you stay connected 24 hours
per day there will be six angry customers. At least they won’t be able to send
you rude e-mails (that’s a joke, son, a joke I say).
Offering the MP3 ﬁles from your CD collection free to anyone who asks? That’s
illegal for one (unless you have written permission from the copyright holders)
and an easy call to make from the broadband service provider’s point of view.
You will be labeled a bandwidth hog and may be restricted in terms of service
hours or uploads allowed.
Offering family photos to relatives and close friends? Should be no problem.
Offering photos not of family nature? Filters can actually check image contents
to see how prevalent ﬂesh tones are in the ﬁles. Read the section on acceptable
use policies if you think you can get away with this. (You won’t for long.)
If MP3 ﬁles ﬂow upstream from your residential, noncommercial Internet access
account all day, the service provider will cut your connection. Actually, the
provider will most likely inform you of your transgression beyond the limits of
your residential customer terms of service, and force you to upgrade to a
commercial account. It will impose service restrictions only if you don’t upgrade
and pay more money.
Running your computer as a multiplayer game server all day will get the same
reaction from your service provider. That also is against some ﬁne print
somewhere, and your service will be cut unless you upgrade to a commercial
account.
Summary
Use these checklists and your broadband choice will provide the type of service
you want based on your situation. But even if you make a mistake, you can
change your mind and try again.

omputer security becomes even more important
when you use a broadband service provider
because your systems are on the Internet all the time, not
just when you dial up. New precautions are necessary.
There are several ways to keep your systems safe, even
while surﬁng at high speed over your new broadband
connection. The equipment used to connect to your
service provider will help, as will free or inexpensive
software.
Broadband connections at a private residence have
certain responsibilities shared by the owner and the
service provider. Connections in multitenant locations,
such as apartments and ofﬁce buildings, have equal, but
different, responsibilities. Whichever group you fall into,
the tools and guidelines you need are in this section.

n one hand, having to protect their personal
computers against attacks from strangers
aggravates people to no end. People who don’t even
know you want to trash your computer and steal your
data.
On the other hand, you regularly lock your home,
ofﬁce, and car, and you store your valuable papers
in a ﬁreproof vault or in a bank safety deposit box.
Why should you believe the virtual world of
computing is safer and nicer than the real
world?
Computer security, and the time and expense users
must go through to protect their computers and data,
really stinks. But we spend even more time and
money protecting ourselves from similar things in
the real world. If you keep in mind that computer
hackers are no more personally motivated than
pickpockets, you may be able to deal with all this less
emotionally.
In many cases, computer attacks are crimes of
opportunity. Just like car thieves who ﬁnd the keys
inside an unlocked car, hackers ﬁnd easy targets
whenever possible. So when you look like an easy
target and don’t do the computer equivalent of locking
your car and arming your car alarm, hackers will
gleefully ruin your day. But when you have your
computers locked and protected, hackers go to the next
victim.
If I could just ﬁnd a way to be calm and less annoyed
about spam, I’d be in great shape.

How Miscreants Get into
Your Computer
Before you get to how, think about why someone would like to gather the
information on your computer. If you’re like most people, you have credit card
numbers, bank account numbers, and perhaps even passwords to your ofﬁce
network on your computer. That means, at the least, burglars, identity thieves,
and corporate spies would love to dive in to your data.
Some people like to destroy things and paint grafﬁti on walls. Their computer
equivalents are making viruses, worms, and other destructive programs.
Aggravating but not deadly, at least not if you take the proper precautions, these
destructive people cause more grief in the computer world than almost anyone.
Distinguishing a virus from a worm can be tough and the different attack
methods used today overlap quite a bit. A virus is any program that inhabits
your computer without your permission. These applications sometimes wreak
havoc by displaying taunting messages or destroying data, but they often hide
and launch attacks against other computers.
The term worm describes the method of transport more than the payload and
action. A worm often attacks computers across a network by looking for
openings in the operating system software. When holes are found, the worms
move into your computer and become a virus.
A Trojan Horse program (usually referred to just as a Trojan) refers to the Greek
story of the Trojan horse where Odysseus snuck into Troy disguised inside a
wooden horse. The gates open, the Trojans dragged the huge horse into the city,
and later the soldiers inside snuck out and wreaked havoc. Notice the repetition
of havoc wreaking? That’s what happens.
Sometimes, security experts and writers get tired of trying to separate what’s a
worm from a virus from a Trojan. That’s where the term malware came from.
Malware is good shorthand for malicious software and covers various
incarnations of evil programs.
The worst part of all this is that almost every time you hear about a huge virus
outbreak, users have only themselves to blame for their troubles. Viruses,
worms, and Trojan developers attack computers on several fronts, but the most
successful front, by far, is to trick users into opening the door and letting the
virus walk right in.
The following list describes some of the most common ways computers are
infected:
✦Opening an e-mail attachment from an unknown sender
✦Opening a Microsoft Word document with malicious macros
✦Downloading from unsafe Internet sources
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 7 ✦Understanding Computer Security 141
✦Sharing disks and CD-ROMs (including some from big-name software
vendors)
✦Contacting infected ﬁles on a ﬁle server
✦Contacting infected ﬁles in a peer-to-peer network
✦Visiting malicious Web pages
Can you stop exposing your computer to viruses if you’re careful? No, but the
smarter you surf around the Internet, the less trouble you will have. You can
certainly refuse to open e-mail attachments from people you don’t know. You can
refuse to download ﬁles when a pop-up window in your Web browser tries to
convince you to download some wonderful ﬁle you never heard of and didn’t
request. You can refuse to put disks and CDs of unknown origin into your
computer.
However, you can’t avoid worms and viruses just by being careful. You need
tools to help you avoid infection. You need several layers of tools to help you
avoid infection when you have a broadband connection that’s always on,
keeping your computers always connected to the Internet.
E-Mail
E-mail is the giant hole in your home or business through which almost all
worms, viruses, Trojan horse ﬁles, general malware, and, of course, spam pour.
Spam and malware go hand in hand.
When users open ﬁle attachments from e-mail without checking the ﬁle for a
virus ﬁrst, they run the risk of infection. Yes, I know that you shouldn’t blame the
victim and that the virus writers are to blame often fail to teach users to protect
themselves. Users who open attachments from people they don’t know pay the
price.
Making the situation worse, many viruses spread by sending e-mails (with
infected attachment) to every address in the infected machine’s Microsoft
Outlook or Outlook Express address book database. So trusting users who may
never open an e-mail from an unknown person open e-mails from someone they
do know. Bam! They’re infected, because the e-mail really wasn’t from someone
they know; it came from the virus stealing the addresses from someone they
know.
Be careful
E-mail (and spam) senders trick you into loading a virus in the following ways:
✦Pretend to be from someone you know and trust
✦Hide the fact that an attachment is executable
✦Offer help handling virus infections
✦Include HTML code to activate programs located on Web sites
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

142 Part II ✦Practicing Safe Broadband
When you get an attachment you don’t expect, verify the sender and ask that
person about the ﬁle you received. If the person sent it on purpose, you’ll have
no problem. If that person has no idea that an e-mail with an attachment came
bearing their address, both of you need to disinfect your systems.
Don’t open attachments if they are executable ﬁles. You can tell this by checking
their ﬁle extension (the letters to the right of the dot at the end of the ﬁle name).
Unless you are positive the sender and ﬁles are trustworthy, do not click the
attached ﬁles. Files with the following extensions can cause problems by
executing when you open them:
.bat
.com
.exe
.pif
.reg
.vb
.vbs
When you look at the ﬁles on your computer, you will notice many of your ﬁles
have these extensions and the ﬁles are trustworthy. Your operating system and
all your applications rely on these ﬁle types. However, when you click an
unexpected ﬁle in an e-mail message, the application will begin working so
quickly your system will be compromised before you can react.
Protecting yourself
Microsoft Windows hides the extensions from you by default. This setting makes
it easier for virus attachments to get by users. Change this setting immediately.
Go to Start; then open the Control Panel and choose Folder Options ➪View, to
see the selection options shown in Figure 7-1.
The check box is named Hide Extensions for known ﬁle types and that’s what it
does. If Windows believes it knows what type of ﬁle the extension describes,
you’ll never see the extension.
Devious virus writers try and fool users by hiding the ﬁle extension of an
executable program. Windows, in all recent versions, lets you have periods in
the ﬁlename. If your Windows settings hide extensions (by default) the virus may
come inside a program named Jokes.txt.exe. The ﬁle extension, the letters
after the last period, remains hidden by Windows, so users think a text ﬁle of
jokes can’t cause them any harm. After you clear the check box shown in
Figure 7-1, you’ll see the entire ﬁlename and realize the trick. Any program with a
ﬁle extension from the list before Figure 7-1 might wreak havoc and even go so
far as to erase all your data and reformat your hard disk if allowed to run.
Many attackers aim at Microsoft’s Outlook and Outlook Express e-mail
applications for the following reasons:

Chapter 7 ✦Understanding Computer Security 143
Figure 7-1: Make sure the box the arrow points to is
unchecked.
✦The majority of personal computer users rely on them.
✦Microsoft opens application interfaces so one program can change data
for other programs.
You can’t blame Microsoft’s problems on lack of market penetration and
dominance. The minute Microsoft included an e-mail and Web browser
application in its operating systems, it took over the market share lead. If you’re
a hacker or virus monger, you want to attack the leading programs to make more
of a splash.
You can blame Microsoft for building in all types of programming hooks between
their e-mail client (Outlook and Outlook Express), browser (Internet Explorer),
address book, and execution support for Visual Basic. Any code in any program
within the Windows operating systems and the Ofﬁce application suite can
trigger actions in other programs without requiring security checks or
authentication. The handy way you can send someone an e-mail and have it show
up on their calendar. Viruses use the same tricks to read your address book and
launch malware-laden e-mails with your name as sender and return address.

144 Part II ✦Practicing Safe Broadband
Microsoft turns on HTML (formatted) e-mail display by default. Links in HTML
messages can connect to Web sites and download programs or start other
mischief. Some users (yours truly included) read e-mails only in text format to
avoid triggering a connection to an unknown Web site. Even just opening the
e-mail message with an HTML reader can tell the spammer or hacker who sent
the message details about your system for future attacks, and even open
connections making further infection possible. Reading the URL in a text-only
reader eliminates that possibility.
If you’re interested in alternative e-mail applications to prevent another virus
attack sending e-mail malware with your name attached, check out these free
options:
✦Netscape: channels.netscape.com/ns/browsers/download.jsp
✦Mozilla: www.mozilla.org/
✦Other choices: www.download.com/ and other download sites.
The following options aren’t free forever. They offer a free trial option, and a
good reputation:
✦Eudora: www.eudora.com/
✦The Bat: www.ritlabs.com/en/products/thebat/
Using non-Microsoft e-mail applications breaks the coordination between your
e-mail, your calendar, and your task list. If you need those connections and enjoy
the automated connections between the applications, stay with Microsoft
Outlook or Outlook Express. If you prefer to gain more virus protection, try
another e-mail client application. If you prefer to stay with Outlook, pay your
protection money for the security applications like spam control, virus checking,
and personal ﬁrewall software.
Downloaded ﬁles
Your mother used to tell you, “put that down, you don’t know where it’s been.”
That same advice stands for users tempted to download ﬁles they ﬁnd here and
there.
Sometimes the ﬁle you download causes problems directly, and sometimes the
problem comes from a stowaway program attached and unnoticed in the
process. Either way, you can invite worms and viruses in the front door of your
computer when you download the wrong ﬁle from the wrong place.
Rule of thumb: If you go to a Web site looking for ﬁles, such as drivers from a
software vendor or the downloads section from the Web portion of technical
magazines, you will be ﬁne. If an e-mail comes out of the ether offering some
wonderful screensaver or the like, delete it quickly.
Be careful
Don’t download programs you don’t ask for. Some Trojan programs get
downloaded from a spam message pretending to be a legitimate service update
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 7 ✦Understanding Computer Security 145
request from some company like Microsoft. Download that program and pay the
price, because either that program will cause problems directly or will download
other programs that will cause problems.
Don’t download programs from friends unless you’re expecting a ﬁle from that
person. One of the primary ways viruses spread is by spooﬁng the name and
address of the sender. After all, would you download an attachment from an e-mail
from “Scumbag Scammer” with a subject “Pain in a pretend application patch?”
Spooﬁng and Phishing
When a virus program reads the Outlook address book on an infected computer
and sends messages to every listing, it almost always uses the address of the PC’s
owner. That’s spooﬁng.
When an e-mail arrives unbidden from some type of ﬁnancial ﬁrm, such as a
request from eBay or PayPal to click a special link and “verify your account infor-
mation” or provide passwords, that’s phishing. Even major national banks have
been victimized by phishing, but not as victimized as the users who fell for the
trick and provided their account numbers and passwords to thieves.
Protecting yourself
Download support ﬁles only from sites you went to directly, hosted by vendors
you trust. When an e-mail says it’s from a vendor and wants you to download
something, don’t click the link included in the e-mail message. Go to the vendor’s
Web site directly and download what you need.
The major Web sites for ﬁle downloads carefully virus-check all the ﬁles they
offer. Vendors will also virus-check, although in rare instances viruses hide
inside major vendor software. That’s why you must have virus protection
yourself rather than trust your good fortune.
If you own a small company, tell users never to download ﬁles themselves. Let
you or the IT person download patches and apply them properly.
Peer-to-peer networks, especially those used for exchanging pirated mu-
sic, are full to overﬂowing with viruses, worms, and other malware hiding
in some of the ﬁles.
Whether you are a home user or small business owner, keep an active virus-
protection application running at all times. At least that way, if you download a
malicious ﬁle by accident, your application may catch it as it downloads or when
it tries to execute.
Web sites
I didn’t put Web sites in with downloaded ﬁles because some jerkwad/con artists
now build fake Web sites to trick people. They do this do this grab your bank
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

146 Part II ✦Practicing Safe Broadband
account passwords or credit card numbers; the trick is called phishing. Usually
invited by a fake e-mail built to look like a notice from some trustworthy
company, users go to the faux Web site and try to login or put in their credit card
numbers for veriﬁcation.
These phishing Web sites often copy the real company Web site so closely you
couldn’t tell the difference unless you looked at the code behind the fa¸cade. By
the time you realize nothing happened after you put in your login name and
password or credit card number, it’s too late to erase the information from the
Web site. And some of the phishers send a polite thank you for providing the
information, just as the spoofed Web site would, to keep you from suspecting
you’ve been had.
Don’t provide any critical information to a Web site reached by clicking
a link in an e-mail you didn’t request.
Why does this work? Users click the Web site link within their e-mail message
without thinking. And the phishers hide the real Web site name within a long,
convoluted Web site address so it’s hard to see.
Be careful
As bad as phishing is, that’s not the only Web site problem waiting to trap the
unwary. Two of the most serious viruses in the last few years, Code Red and the
Nimda worm, often spread to unprotected computers when the Web browser
application (Microsoft’s Internet Explorer) visited Web sites.
Yes, just visiting the wrong Web site can clobber your computer with viruses,
worms, and even the electronic hives. (Okay, I made that one up.) Web sites
run by known retailers, major vendors, and other reputable companies with
a real-world reputation tend to be pretty close to worry free. Web sites run by
unknown groups with no real-world counterpart vary greatly in quality and safety.
Web sites mentioned in spam messages may not be actively trying to infect your
computer, but cross your ﬁngers. Any Web site referred by a spam message
offering cheap software, free music downloads, or passes to pornographic sites
does not have your best interests in mind.
Protecting yourself
Even if you don’t plan to go to questionable Web sites, you will by accident now
and then. Many unscrupulous Web site developers register “typo” sites, placing
pornography or worse on a Web site with a URL that differs by one letter from
that of a major site.
There are no absolute guidelines to distinguish a “good” Web site from a site full
of hackers, virus mongers, and thieves ready to pounce. However, here’s a list of
suspicious details, each of which should make you slightly more wary and
nervous. When enough details add up, bail out. So hit the eject button on a site
that

Chapter 7 ✦Understanding Computer Security 147
✦Offers the traditional “too good to be true” products or services
✦Pushes obviously illegal products, such as new hit songs or current
released movies for download
✦Bombards you with pop-up ads
✦Contains a high number of typos, misspellings, and syntax errors
(because those of us married to English teachers ﬁnd that wrong in
several ways)
✦Feels odd, even if you can’t say exactly why
If you don’t want to suffer through the security holes (well-documented in virus
circles) of Microsoft’s Internet Explorer that allows Visual Basic programs to
make changes in other Microsoft applications, you can try a different Web
browser. Netscape and Mozilla were mentioned a bit earlier because they
include excellent e-mail applications. The best other third-party Web browser,
according to many sources, is the Opera Web Browser for Windows
(www.opera.com), which offers a free version with ads in the upper-right corner
of the application, or a paid (ad-free) version.
Keep a good real-time virus scanning program loaded if you surf into odd and
seedy Web neighborhoods on a regular basis. Just as some bad parts of town
strongly suggest the need for a bodyguard, so do some parts of the Web.
Physical Security Details
Early viruses (starting back to 1982 or so for Apple II and 1986 for the IBM PC)
spread by infecting disks used to boot the personal computers of the time. No
one could afford a hard disk then, particularly because the IBM XT had yet to
burst on the scene with the unheard-of extravagance of a personal hard drive
with its 10MB (yes, MegaByte) hard disk.
Few people (maybe none) boot their computers with ﬂoppies today. Some new
computers don’t even ship with a ﬂoppy drive, but all modern computers can boot
from the CD-ROM or DVD drive. So you can get a boot virus (one that loads during
the boot-up process), or some other type, from a dirty CD-ROM. This makes
great sense when you realize that booting from a CD-ROM bypasses your typical
startup procedures, especially the step loading your virus protection software.
Home users won’t have to worry about physical security too much. After all, if
your home gets burgled you’re more likely to have no computer than a computer
with a virus or Trojan program installed on it surreptitiously.
Business users have slightly more worries, especially if the business invites the
public inside the doors regularly. Frankly, however, the chances of someone
slipping one of your computers a virus is low. That doesn’t mean there aren’t
physical security details to watch.
Keep servers far away from employees, much less visitors. Why would people
need to hack your company from outside if they could physically reach your
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

148 Part II ✦Practicing Safe Broadband
server? Someone copying ﬁles onto a ﬂoppy or USB mini-drive can walk away
with your entire accounting database on a keyring.
Every security checklist for companies, whether a one-person startup based in
the garage or a multinational conglomerate, always demands the server(s) be
kept out of physical reach of everyone. If outsiders can reach your physical
servers, you have no security. If employees can reach your physical server, you
have only slight security.
Traveling laptops
Laptops create multiple security problems, as I’ll cover in upcoming chapters
about security, wireless connections in public, and data backups. Just as a
person who travels picks up interesting souvenirs, traveling laptops often
pickup interesting things as well.
If your business has people come in and plug their laptops onto your production
network, you will soon have virus and worm problems. Try and stop these
laptops from becoming the transportation of choice for viruses if possible.
If your laptop travels around, verify the status of your virus protection software.
Make sure your operating system and your virus protection software are up to
date. Do the same for laptops of employees who take their systems home.
Laptop Paranoia is Good for You
Although not quite in the spirit of this chapter, let me digress for a moment and
strongly encourage some extra precautions for your laptop. First of all, backups for
laptops get ignored regularly. Chapter 13 will cover that.
Second, laptops often carry valuable information, yet are stolen on a regular basis.
Even if your laptop carries personal information rather than international com-
merce secrets for a conglomerate, giving that information to a thief won’t make
your life easier. Check into software to lock your laptop or encryption for the hard
disk. A little bit of trouble and expense, but far less trouble and expense than having
someone in possession of your complete banking history and account numbers.
Disks from outside
Floppy disks ﬂoated around, free for grabbing, for years. Programs, tightly
written and cheap, could ﬁt onto a ﬂoppy or two, making it inviting to try the
application.
Now the concern comes from CD-ROMs ﬁlling your physical mailbox, magazines,
and books. Personally, I trust CDs inside books without question. (I’ve done two
books with CD inserts myself.) Magazine CD inserts rate pretty high trust as well,
especially name brand magazines with good reputations in the market. CDs that

appear in the mail should be virus checked if possible, or at least run on a
nonnetworked computer with virus protection software loaded and up to date.
Be wary of employees bringing CDs or ﬂoppies from home. You have no idea
where those disks have been or under who’s protection. Even trustworthy
employees can accidentally bring viruses to work.
Wired network security
When wires connect your computer to the other computers in your home or
ofﬁce, security for data transmissions remains high. After all, you would
probably notice another computer plugged into your wiring hub.
There are other ways to breach physical security, unfortunately. Are you getting
the idea that protecting your data takes more time and effort than you ever
imagined?
Some early cable broadband access service providers and equipment
didn’t properly handle the barrier between the private network inside
your home or ofﬁce and the rest of your neighbors on the cable segment.
Users would jump onto their broadband connection and see the disks
and printers of other users all over neighborhood. That problem no longer
exists, luckily, thanks to improved security from Microsoft Windows and
the cable broadband service providers getting up to speed.
Popular remote control programs like GoToMyPC (.com) and PC Anywhere
(www.Symantec.com) allow a remote computer to effectively reach across the
telephone wire and completely control the PC running the client software. Many
people leave this type of program running on their work computer so they can
dial in from home or on the road to retrieve documents and look up information.
If you run the reverse scenario and leave the remote control client running on
your home computer, someone else could dial in and gain full access to your
computer and everything else on your network. Security holes exist wherever
the remote control software runs, because individuals rarely pick adequate
passwords. If someone ﬁnds the number of the modem, especially someone who
knows you, guessing your password may not be too hard.
Making Passwords
Great passwords look like this: a*RD!>,m7+d, but are impossible to remember. The
old joke about passwords on sticky notes attached to the monitor. Still happens
in every big company today, and that’s no joke.
Mix upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols into a password you
can remember. Do it intelligently. Your name and birthday isn’t a proper mix like

this: james0903 but is better like this: j0a9m0e3s. Better would be J0a9m0e3s
to gain a capital letter, or better yet J0a9*m0e3!s. See the distortion of an easily
remembered pattern? The name and birthday are there, but mixed up to confuse
guessers.
Dictionary attacks, where hackers try every word in a dictionary to break your
password, which means you can’t use a “real” word in your password. But you
can use words that mean something and are therefore easier to remember as you
scramble them all up
Speaking of modems, many companies have modems they have forgotten
existed connected to computers and other devices scattered around their
networks. Not many small companies have this problem, because ﬁnding a stray
phone line on small company’s bill takes less effort than in a big company. But if
you have an outside company handle networking installations, there may be
modems attached to some of your equipment to allow remote management
sessions. Check to be sure.
Wireless network security
Unlike the wired network with excellent security based on physical wires,
wireless networks actually eliminate all those secure wires (duh). With those
wires go many people’s last comfortable thought about a secure network.
Chapter 16 covers wireless security in considerable depth, but here are a few
things to chew on before you get that far back in the book.
✦Standard Wi-Fi signals go through only two walls, at least according to the
“rule of thumb” for network experts. However, you can’t count apartment
walls as a “real” wall, can you? The signals also go through windows
much easier than through walls.
✦Almost every vendor ships its wireless products with security disabled.
This helps get new users up and running, but many never go back and
add security. You wouldn’t forget that, would you?
✦The vendor defaults for name brand wireless networking equipment are
well known to people interested in eavesdropping on your wireless
communications. Change the defaults.
✦Place wireless access points near the center of your home and business if
at all possible. The pictures of wireless access by the pool look
wonderful, but they aren’t trying to sell security. Dropping your laptop
into the water ruins your entire day and ruins the relaxation.
This is only a quick overview of wireless security. Look to Chapter 16 for
details.

Chapter 7 ✦Understanding Computer Security 151
Remember that a curious neighbor or determined business competitor will not
knock on your door to tell you how leaky your wireless signals are. They will not
mention how lame your passwords are, if you even have any passwords at all.
Keeping Things Out (Viruses, Worms,
Trojans, Hackers)
You must approach computer data security, and keeping your systems and ﬁles
safe from worms, viruses, and other malware much like you approach the
physical security of your home. The doors all have locks, and you remember to
use them. An alarm alerts the authorities in case of an intrusion. Valuables hide
inside a safe, or at least out of sight in drawers. Insurance doesn’t act exactly like
a backup, but does offer a way to replace items in case of loss.
Once connected to a broadband service provider, your computer(s) can be seen
on the Internet anytime by anyone. This is the ﬂip side of the “always-on” feature
of a broadband connection. Always on means, always visible, but so are your
house and car.
The layered approach works best in security. I describe, sometimes in painful
detail, how to construct layers for security in upcoming chapters (12, 13, 15, 16,
and 17).
Tech Bits
Security experts follow trends like everyone else. Lately most of them
seem to prefer a Medieval layer description. The King must be guarded,
so he sits inside the castle along with his army. More troops sit between
the castle residence building and the walls of the castle. Outside the wall
swims alligators in the moat. Outside the moat is the village, which slows
attackers down. And putting the castle on high ground forces attackers to
climb up toward the castle in full view of the lookouts. That’s layered se-
curity, although the idea of your money inside a bank vault inside a bank
building wired with electronic alarms has appeal, but not as picturesque
as a castle.
But if you’re new to broadband access, you want to play with the Internet, and I
don’t blame you. So I just want to drop in a few security details before you get
too carried away.
Update your operating system
Examine the circle of computer life:
1. Hacker or virus writers ﬁnd hole in operating system
2. Developer patches operating system
3. Users apply patches to their machines with that operating system
4. Hackers and virus writers ﬁnd new hole in operating system

152 Part II ✦Practicing Safe Broadband
5. Developer patches operating system
6. Users apply patches to their machines with that operating system
7. Hackers and virus writers ﬁnd new hole in operating system (repeat and
repeat and repeat)
The part that often trips up users is the users apply patch part. Many don’t,
making their life more exciting if you consider viruses, worms, and hacker
attacks exciting. Many people class those as giant pains in the rear, and do
everything necessary to avoid that type of excitement.
When a new virus or worm hits, the news reports makes a point that many of the
users hit at the beginning have yet to patch some operating system ﬂaw that’s
been well documented. In other words, these people left their front door open.
Don’t be one of those people.
Microsoft greatly improved its update technology with Windows XP. Figure 7-2
shows the update screen in Windows XP Home.
Figure 7-2: You should see this screen regularly.
You can reach the Windows Update screen in Windows XP by choosing Windows
Update from the Start Menu and clicking Programs or by looking in the left-side
menu from Control Panel. On Windows 2000 you just look on the Start menu. If
you have automatic updates turned on, your system does the downloading and
installing of patches for you. If you haven’t checked out the options, let me show
you where to enable automatic updates.

If you’re nervous about letting your computer do such things when you’re
asleep, you can turn off automatic updates. Do I trust Microsoft to make this
work properly every time? No. But I believe Microsoft is causing less harm with
the automatic updates than they used to, and the potential harm from attack is a
greater worry. But be sure and read Chapter 13 about backing up your data.
Figure 7-3 shows you have three options for updates. You can be notiﬁed before
any downloads start and give permission at your leisure. You can download the
update ﬁles automatically and apply them at your leisure, or you can have
Windows download and install them automatically.
Figure 7-3: Make your choice for automatic updates.
You reach the screen in Figure 7-3 by opening the Control Panel, and clicking the
System icon. The Automatic Updates page tab is in the middle of the System
Properties box that opens. On the left you can see the menu listing Windows
Update just under the See Also heading. Clicking that opens the screen shown in
Figure 7-2. You can also click Windows Update on the left-side menu in Control
Panel.
Microsoft encourages you to use automatic updates. So do most security
experts. Other computer experts feel that mistakes in automatic updates
will cause more problems than they solve. If you don’t want to use au-
tomatic updates, at least run a backup and then manual updates on a
regular basis.

If you have only one or two computers, this process takes little or no time. If
your business has a dozen or more computers, along with a server or three, time
will become more of an issue. However, not updating operating systems might
cause you to loose much more time sometime in the future. A dozen computers
that need patching will make the investment in a management suite that pushed
patches out without your intervention worthwhile.
Update your virus protection
Most modern antivirus software works by matching patterns in the virus
program, called signatures, to a database of known viruses. Every time a new
virus appears, the antivirus companies grab it, scan it for a recognizable
signature, and add that new signature to their virus database.
The only way you beneﬁt from ongoing virus protection and installing a defense
against new viruses is to keep your virus database up to date. It does no good to
buy a virus program and never update the signature database. After a short
time, you’ll have no protection against the new viruses that appeared in the
computer world after your purchase.
If you don’t trust your virus protection software, or are afraid you have a virus
your software vendor has yet to ﬁgure out, take a look at HouseCall from Trend
Micro (www.trendmicro.com). For personal use, Trend Micro provides an
excellent virus-checking program, HouseCall, free for the downloading. Figure 7-4
shows the Trend Micro personal page. HouseCall is in the upper-right corner.
Figure 7-4: Free is always good.
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 7 ✦Understanding Computer Security 155
The program downloads a small client application but that won’t take long.
Running HouseCall gives you peace of mind and a quick way to double-check
other virus protection routines you have in place.
HouseCall does not leave a resident application running to watch all ﬁle activity,
such as when you download a new ﬁle from the Internet. This is a nice service
from Trend Micro, but it doesn’t eliminate the need for a real-time virus
monitoring application running on your PC at all times (and, of course, Trend
Micro wants you to consider its products, and you should).
If you don’t have virus protection, get some. If you do have virus protection,
check that you’re still able to update your virus deﬁnition database. Sometimes
people miss or ignore the virus vendor’s offers to extend licensing to get
necessary updates. Those users think they’re still safe because they see their
virus application running. The software could well be running yet allow a virus
access to your hard disk because the outdated database didn’t recognize the
new virus signature.
Verify that your antivirus software includes e-mail application protection and
use it to scan all incoming and outgoing e-mail. Because most viruses spread via
e-mail, the more eyes watching for miscreant software the better. Do not rely on
your ISPs e-mail scanning software alone unless you enjoy cleaning up virus-
ridden computers.
Update your personal ﬁrewall
Not every computer has a personal ﬁrewall. In fact, few do, but more should
have them. A ﬁrewall emulates the physical ﬁrewall, like the one in your car that
keeps your engine compartment and your passenger compartment separate.
Mixing the engine and passengers never makes for a happy ending. A personal
ﬁrewall runs only on your computer, and closes the software port addresses
worms use to inﬁltrate systems across a network. When the worm comes
knocking, your ﬁrewall keeps the door shut.
Sometimes ﬁrewall programs are included in a security suite of products from
one of the big vendors. Sometimes you can get individual ﬁrewall programs for
free or cheap. One of the long-time free personal ﬁrewalls, Zone Alarm, can be
downloaded from the Zone Labs Company at www.zonelabs.com. See the Zone
Alarm family of products in Figure 7-5.
Tech Bits
Internet devices talk about ports, which are software addresses used
to communicate between programs. Hackers look for unprotected ports,
which open the software to outsiders like an unlocked house door opens
to burglars. Firewalls block ports and examine packets to see if they’re
allowed through the open ports.
Routers have ﬁrewalls, but if your broadband connection goes directly to your
computer, you will need a personal ﬁrewall. If your router has a ﬁrewall built in,
or you have a separate ﬁrewall appliance, individual computers won’t need
personal ﬁrewalls.

If you have a personal ﬁrewall, keep the software updated. The same goes for the
ﬁrewall in your router, as discussed in the next section.
Keeping Things In (Your Information)
Protecting your data should be your top security concern. Worms, viruses,
Trojan horse programs, and hackers can be tolerated barely, but patience
disappears when your ﬁles disappear.
Although many settings in Microsoft Windows XP do a better job of protecting
your system by default, Microsoft sets the software to make some networking
tasks simple. Unfortunately, in the world of security, simple generally means
porous. Not good.
Chapter 11 will go through the details of conﬁguring your computers to close the
security door. If you can’t wait, go to your computer ﬁle settings now and turn
off ﬁle sharing of any type. That will make it harder for any hackers to see your
computer on the Internet, and keep them from adding, modifying, or deleting
any of your ﬁles.

not C).
2. If contents are hidden, ﬁnd System Tasks in the menu on the left and click
Show the Contents of This Drive.
3. Open Documents and Settings to ﬁnd your User folder.
4. Right-click the folder to keep it hidden, and click Properties; then click
Sharing.

Router ﬁrewall settings
If you have a router with a ﬁrewall, conﬁgure the ﬁrewall so that it ignores
Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) messages, which are pings from
outside. This is covered in Chapter 11, but setting your router to ignore these
queries makes it harder for hackers to ﬁnd you.
Second, block or at least monitor any outgoing messages. If you have a program
sending information out through some TCP/IP port address, it may be a Trojan
program left by a virus. The outgoing information could contain system
information that provides easy entrance to hackers, or spam e-mailers. Some
spam now comes from machines that are hijacked in this manner. If the
spammers are nice, they hide the sending address. If they leave the address, it
looks like you just offered the world a new low-cost mortgage or something even
more embarrassing, depending on the spam messages.
In short, set your router ﬁrewall to block outgoing messages unless they’re
authorized. Also, update your router ﬁrewall software regularly.
Desktop ﬁrewall settings
Personal ﬁrewalls vary as much as those on routers, but they tend to offer more
help in conﬁguration. If you have one, check out the settings to monitor outgoing
messages. Individual computers on broadband services rate high as targets for
viruses, worms, and hackers because so few people properly protect their
systems.
Protect yourself by blocking outgoing messages unless they’re authorized. Your
personal ﬁrewall software should have a setting to block or ﬁlter outgoing trafﬁc.
Set that; then test it to make sure you can still send e-mail.
Nag, nag, nag: update your ﬁrewall software regularly.
Note to online game players
Game players must make extra security allowances for outgoing trafﬁc, because
multiplayer games sometimes get treated like hacker activity by some ﬁrewalls.
Your game support information should tell you how to conﬁgure your ﬁrewalls
to allow game play to pass safely through the ﬁrewall.
Summary
There are people out on the Internet who want to ruin or exploit your computer.
Some of them do it as some bizarre idea of fun, whereas others do it for proﬁt.
I’m more worried about the ones doing it for proﬁt.

You take precautions in the real world, such as locking your doors, having

a target. The same approach works in the Internet world. Keep your doors
locked, your alarms set, and watch where you go. You can go where you want on

ntersections cause tension. This is true when driving
or on TV shows. When driving, intersections allow
other vehicles to come at you from all directions. On TV
dramas, whenever the good guys and bad guys run into
each other, something happens (or at least there are
threats of future happenings).
The same goes for your broadband connection. Outside
your walls, the service provider must take care of all the
details. Inside your walls, you are responsible for your
computer or the computers connected to each other
and the broadband connection.
Where your network meets the broadband service
provider network is a true intersection and therefore a
potential conﬂict. You are responsible for all broadband
access problems starting at any of the following
intersections:
✦Where the broadband service provider wire hits
your house
✦Where the broadband connection plug is inside
your house
✦At the plug where you connect your computer or
network to the broadband modem
✦At the router plug where you connect your
computer or network to the broadband access

depends on your service and the equipment involved. The focus here is the link
between your service provider broadband cable or modem and your router or
computer.
Cable and DSL “Modems”
When you get a broadband connection, the provider will send or deliver what
they call a broadband modem. Depending on where the broadband access line
comes into your home and whether the service provider installed the
connection, you will be responsible for everything beyond the cable modem.
The Phone Company used to, and often still does, call this type of equipment
CPE for Customer Premises Equipment. In other words, it is an equipment the
phone company controlled yet placed at your site. It might be less confusing if
cable and DSL modems were called Customer Premises Connection Equipment
to make it clearer to people what they really mean by cable and DSL modem.
Of course, normal people (those not in the computer or networking business)
understand modem perfectly well.
Your broadband service provider will do one of the following:
✦Provide your cable/DSL modem for free
✦Provide your cable/DSL modem for a small fee each month
✦Sell you the cable/DSL modem for a retail price
✦Tell you which cable/DSL modem to purchase separately
One way or another, you need a cable/DSL modem to make the connection to
your broadband service provider. These units are typically external, small boxes
with at least two plugs: one for the line from the service provider and one for
your computer or network connection. Internal modems ﬁt inside a computer
(almost always a PC running Windows and almost never a Macintosh or Linux
system) but they have a small and dwindling percentage of the market.
You will almost always have an external unit for the following reasons:
✦Many customers don’t like opening their computers.
✦Service providers don’t like opening customer computers when they do
the installation.
✦Replacing the customer computer hardware requires a new installation,
as do many software updates.
✦Access to the broadband connection for multiple computers is much
simpler with an external unit.
Early on, cable and (particularly) DSL providers used the internal PC card more
often because of cost. The internal system didn’t need a housing or power
supply, so it cost less to manufacture. Every installation required a truck roll,
because the installing technician usually installed the card into the computer for
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 8 ✦Examining Your Home Broadband Hookup 163
the customer. But the provider had to roll a truck anyway to bring the wiring into
the home, so that extra expense existed already.
This practice gave way, thankfully, to the use of external units for almost every
installation. External unit prices dropped and the installation software
improved. This makes it possible for customers to install the client side of the
broadband connection hardware and software themselves, eliminating the truck
roll. No truck roll means the service provider saves big money.
Using the external cable/DSL modem also makes networking simpler. Yes, you
can conﬁgure the single PC with an internal cable/DSL modem to be a router for
all other computers in the home or ofﬁce, but if you do, you would have to rely
on Microsoft networking software. The networking software can be tricky at
times, and software updates often require network reconﬁguration.
Worse, with an internal cable/DSL modem you have to rely on Microsoft’s
security software to protect all the systems from hackers and viruses. External
units released recently include the cable/DSL modems, routers for networking,
and ﬁrewalls for security.
Cable/DSL modems have gotten more reliable, faster, and easier to conﬁgure for
the service providers over the past few years. Now the race continues to add
features and increase the ability of modems from different manufacturers to
work together.
Modem/not modem
I keep referring to cable and DSL “modems” because everyone tends to call them
modems. They are not modems, at least by any technical deﬁnitions of the word.
I don’t mean they should be called customer premises connection equipment,
but the term “modem” has a speciﬁc meaning, and cable/DSL modems do not,
according to some experts, ﬁt that meaning.
Modem is a truncated word from the awkward phrase modulator-demodulator
and originated early in the world of telecommunications. Digital signals from
computers were modulated into analog sound wave forms for travel over voice
telephone lines. At the receiving end, the analog sound wave forms were
demodulated back into a digital signal.
You can hear this for yourself when you pay attention to your dial-up modem
connection sequence. That chrchrchrchr noise you hear right before the modem
connects to your dial-up site is the sound of digital signals being turned into
noise. Coherent and reproducible noise, but noise nonetheless. The modems cut
off the speaker when connections succeed so you won’t hear that noise.
Purists maintain only a dial-up modem can be called a modem because you must
connect a digital computer to a voice telephone line. Nonpurists say that a
modem encodes signals from one type of carrier signal to another, such as
digital to voice-line analog or digital computer to cable frequency, and so that
cable/DSL modems use the name correctly. You can argue back and forth if you
want, but the common usage does not obscure the original deﬁnition, and I think
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
164 Part II ✦Practicing Safe Broadband
most people deﬁne a modem as something connecting a computer to a service.
Although you may be able to throw network interface cards into that deﬁnition, I
don’t have any serious objection to calling these boxes modems.
But if you get chastised by people who claims a cable/DSL modem isn’t really a
modem, don’t get nervous. Just ask them to call it a Customer Premises
Connection Equipment node, no acronyms or truncated words allowed, and
watch how fast they go back to calling it a modem.
Cable modem information
You may not need a single bit of cable modem information. Your cable
broadband service provider will give you (or sell or lease you) a cable modem as
part of your service agreement.
External units vary from the size of a paperback book up to the size of a decent
hardback book. Wonder how many varieties of cable modems there are?
Figure 8-1 shows a gallery of photos. There are more than I ever imagined.
Figure 8-1: Not sure it’s art, but it’s an interesting gallery.
Notice that Rolf at www.cable-modems.org references the term DOCSIS. This
acronym stands for Data Over Cable Service Interface Speciﬁcations. The
DOCSIS standard was created and is maintained by Cable Television
Laboratories, Inc., at www.CableLabs.com. This group was founded by
cooperating cable television companies back in 1988 and started testing cable

Chapter 8 ✦Examining Your Home Broadband Hookup 165
modems for compliance to standards that enable any cable modem to connect
to any cable provider head-end equipment.
Even if you want to buy your own cable modem, your choices remain severely
restricted. At the other end of the cable line, at the Head-End ofﬁce, the
equipment must communicate sync with your cable modem. If they don’t
communicate exactly, you don’t have service.
DOCSIS standards aim for mixing and matching of equipment; but your
cable broadband provider may not have upgraded its head-end equipment to
the latest models. It may have a mix of open standard and proprietary head-end
equipment. It may have proprietary management tools that work only with a
certain model of client cable modem. It may have a distribution contract with one
of the cable modem vendors and make a few bucks extra off each one installed.
If your cable broadband service provider allows you to purchase your own cable
modem, and you can save money by doing so, it still may not be a great idea. Who
handles the warranty in that situation? If it’s the cable modem manufacturer, you
would have to send the cable modem back and wait several weeks for any repairs.
You would lose your cable broadband service for that length of time because
you have no cable modem to connect your computer(s) to the cable. Bummer.
When your cable company upgrades or changes its service conﬁguration, it has
no responsibility to update your privately owned cable modem. Any type of
upgrade may disable your cable modem, or at least force you to scramble
around and upgrade your cable modem yourself.
If your cable broadband service provider allows you to purchase your own cable
modem and you wish to do so, there are many places in the real world where
you can comparison shop online. Check your favorite computer retailer, and
don’t forget the more general suppliers, such as Best Buy, Circuit City, Ofﬁce
Depot, Ofﬁce Max, and Staples among others. Prices range far under a hundred
dollars for a wide variety of cable modems.
When the new 2.0 DOCSIS compatibility speciﬁcation becomes widespread, the
equation may change in favor of buying your own cable modem. Until then,
however, you may want to look at Table 8-1 and see if the upside is worth the
potential downside for your purchase.

what I think, and experts recommend, matters far less than what you think. It’s
your modem, your service, and you can make your own choice. The new
DOCSIS 2.0 standard may change the equation a bit, but probably not until 2006
or so.
I let my cable provider supply my cable modem. (I lease it, ofﬁcially.) That came
in handy when Comcast replaced my fading old unit with a nice new unit. My
cost for that replacement and service call? Zero.
DSL modem information
Much of the information concerning cable modems applies to DSL modems.
Service providers offer them free as part of the installation package even more
often, it seems, than cable broadband service providers do. After all, phone
companies coined the idea of customer premises equipment.
But a wide variety of DSL modems are on the market. Like the cable modems,
DSL modems are incorporating more and more features. For example, several
vendors (Netopia, 2Wire, and ZyXel among the leaders in this market)
incorporate wireless routers into ADSL modems. Other features added include
router software, ﬁrewall software, and Ethernet connections to support the local
network.
The size and shape of the DSL modems match those of cable modems. The
wireless units have antenna, obviously, but otherwise they look the same.
Pricing for DSL modems runs about the same as the cable modems, but may lean
slightly toward the higher end of the average cable modem.
Although cable modems hit the market ﬁrst, the standards work in the DSL
community may make owning a DSL modem safer than owning a cable modem.
Almost all the DSL service providers support ADSL for the best speeds
possible based on distance from the central ofﬁce or remote terminal. DSL
modems from different vendors work better than cable modems when trying to
connect to equipment from other vendors at the central ofﬁce. Because
standards change or at least get new features added to them, make sure any
modem you buy includes the ability to upgrade its ﬁrmware to keep pace with
updates.

For pedantic sticklers, complaining about the term DSL modem may be
even more of a stretch than complaining about the term cable modem.
After all, the idea behind DSL in general and ADSL in particular is the abil-
ity to support high-bandwidth digital service over a standard telephone
line. Doesn’t modem seem like the right term to describe connecting
your computer to the Internet over a plain old telephone line?
Demarcation point
You are not responsible for upkeep on your broadband access media (cable or
telephone line) out of your house, over the physical wiring across the
neighborhood, and up into the phone company’s central ofﬁce or cable
company’s head-end equipment Conversely, the service provider is not
responsible for its telephone or cable wiring all the way to the computer in your
bedroom. Somewhere, a split must take place, and responsibility for the wire
and the signal therein pass from one party to the other.
This spot is called a demarcation point. First used by the phone company, the
“demarc” as it’s sometimes called occurs where the provider’s wiring ends and
your wiring begins.
For your telephone lines, that point is usually on the wall outside your home
closest to the telephone line service entrance point. If your home has a
basement, you may ﬁnd the box there.
If your telephone line is buried, look for a box (gray, beige, or some other boring
color) that’s not very big (deck of cards, slice of bread, VHS tape) with one wire
coming in from the ground and another wire going up the wall and entering your
house. If your telephone line comes through the air from a pole, you can ﬁnd the
box easily. The box is where the telephone line attaches to your house.
This box is the Network Interface Device (NID) and is the ofﬁcial demarcation
point for your regular telephone connection. The phone company likes to call its
voice lines “the network,” which is where that ﬁrst “N” of the acronym comes
from. My network interface box can be opened on one side so I can look the
connections or test the system. The other side of the network interface, where
the telephone wires connect, has a lock that uses a key carried by the phone
technicians that keeps me locked out.
In my case, the phone company ran a wire from the network interface box
through the garage wall from outside and then through the wall into my ofﬁce.
They mounted a jack on my ofﬁce wall, which they labeled as “their” plug. I
laugh at the label because it was done three DSL providers ago (bankruptcy of
one carrier, discontinued service, new service). Although the phone companies
consider the network interface the end of their responsibility, I count that plug
as the demarcation point for my DSL service because the phone company
installed the wiring and the plug.
Your cable connections do not terminate at a network interface box, but there
will be a demarcation point somewhere. In my situation, the cable tech put a hole
www.it-ebooks.info

168 Part II ✦Practicing Safe Broadband
through the wall of the garage from outside, and another hole in the garage wall
into the ofﬁce, about four inches from the hole used by the telephone company.
A cable plug plate sits where the cable comes into the ofﬁce from the garage.
From there, a patch cable goes to my Speedstream (designed and made
originally by Efﬁcient Networks, which is now owned by Siemens) model 5100
cable modem. I don’t count the cable plug on the wall of my ofﬁce as the
demarcation point for my cable broadband. I count the internal network
connection plug on the Speedstream cable modem as my demarcation point,
because Comcast installed and conﬁgured the cable modem.
Satellite and wireless broadband service providers follow similar rules for
demarcation points and future responsibility. Of course, the wiring heading to
the demarcation point usually comes from a satellite dish or wireless antenna.
In this case, everything said about cable or DSL broadband access applies to
satellite and wireless service providers as well. However, I can speak only in
generalities. The ﬁne print of your service agreement with your provider will be
the ﬁnal arbitrator of service responsibility.
The provider’s responsibility
The company that installed your broadband service must take responsibility for
proper cable integrity and service function up to the demarcation point in your
home or ofﬁce. If you have cable broadband service, the cable company almost
certainly provides the physical wiring connection and the Internet service
portions. One provider, one contact.
DSL installations become much more confused at times. If the primary telephone
company in your area provided your DSL service, like my situation with SBC
Yahoo providing cabling and Internet services, the situation looks much like the
typical cable broadband situation. One provider, one contact.
But the courts forced regional Bell companies like SBC (Southwestern Bell
Telephone Company renamed) to support third-party DSL providers. This means
another DSL service company, such as Darrell’s DSL, relies on SBC to connect
the physical wires; then Darrell’s DSL takes care of the Internet service provider
functions. Who do you call when there’s a problem? Call Darrell, but he may
have to call SBC to get your problem ﬁxed.
Where do broadband service providers have problems they must ﬁx? Let me
count the ways (and places) in Table 8-2.

Your job, when you have a service problem, is not to diagnose and explain
exactly which piece of the network connection needs replacing or upgrading.
Your job is to explain, clearly, logically, and politely, exactly what problems you
are having. Take notes, with times and dates if problems are intermittent.
Providers advertising their Service Level Agreements strive for uptime.
Telephone companies getting into the Internet service provider business have a
great advantage because they already have a large technical support staff in
place to handle physical wiring problems anywhere in the network.
Service providers may detail their demarcation point in the service contract
somewhere, or they may not. A good rule of thumb is that if they installed it as
part of your service, they are responsible for it.
Your responsibility
Because the rule of thumb for service providers says they are responsible for
everything they install, that means you are responsible for everything they didn’t
install. This works out fairly cleanly regarding physical network components,
but can get messy inside the computer when considering added software.
If your broadband access connection looks like mine, with the termination point
from the service provider right next to the cable and DSL modem, you won’t
have many trouble spots to check. In my case, one connecting cable goes from
the cable and DSL modem to the routers supporting my internal network. You
probably won’t have two broadband access points and two internal networks,
but having both makes it easy for me to see how similar they are in many
respects.
If your broadband access connection runs over your home telephone wiring to
reach your router or computer, you have many more potential trouble spots.
Phone wires that work ﬁne with voice signals can have trouble carrying DSL.
Wall jacks that have been painted over may have paint on the connections that
weaken or stop the signal on one or more of the telephone wires. Phone cords
receive an amazing amount of abuse as they are often stepped on, rolled over

170 Part II ✦Practicing Safe Broadband
with wheeled ofﬁce chairs, and serve as puppy teething rings. If the phone cord
connecting your router to the telephone jack can be stepped on, it will be
stepped on.
The links between your router and your computer(s) offers another group of
potential problems, all of which you must ﬁx on your own. After all, even if the
phone or cable company sold you the home or small business networking
equipment, they aren’t responsible for how you’re using the products.
Ethernet Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP) wires look much like phone cords but
are almost always thicker and have a larger connector on the end (the connector
is an RJ45 with eight wires for Ethernet versus an RJ11 with four wires for
telephones, if you’re curious). But as with wire, repeated stomping, mashing,
rolling over, or bending will eventually break it down. Even if the wire doesn’t
break completely, the damage will cause network problems.
After your wiring physically reaches your computer, potential problems remain.
Network interface cards rarely break, but it can happen. Much more often, some
software conﬁguration in a computer changes and makes it appear the network
card quit. Never start yelling at your Internet service provider about problems
until you take a careful look at what’s changed in your computer. Any software
installation or reconﬁguration can impact network functionality. It doesn’t
always make sense, but computers are only logical, not sensible. Table 8-3
gathers together some problems and the responsible party.

Chapter 8 ✦Examining Your Home Broadband Hookup 171
Why should you care which party holds responsibility for each potential trouble
spot? Because when you call your service provider to ﬁx something that’s your
responsibility, you must pay for the repair. Sometimes the provider charges far
more than you expect, but after the work is done you’re stuck paying the bill.
That’s when knowing your responsibilities hits home and sticks.
Routers for Access Sharing
Routers connect at least two networks and send data packets from one network
to another. They can be stand-alone hardware devices or software within a
separate appliance or computer. Most routers used by homes and small
businesses to connect to the Internet are stand-alone hardware units. Figure 8-2
shows one of the early successes in the consumer router market.
Figure 8-2: An early Linksys router that helped solidify the consumer
broadband router market.
Internet service providers, including cable and DSL broadband providers, use
large routers capable of processing millions of packets per second. Routers look
at the header information in each data packet, decide the best path for that
packet across the Internet to the proper destination, and communicate with
other routers along that path to ensure delivery.
Check your service agreement with your provider to make sure you are allowed
to have more than one computer accessing the broadband service. Some service
providers now demand you pay extra if you have a home network and use a
router to connect more than one local computer to their service.
One good thing comes from paying extra for the ability to network multiple
computers to your Internet connection: you get a static IP address from your
service provider. Using a static IP address makes it possible to have servers at
your site, such as your own e-mail or Web server. Some service providers offer a
static IP address for a just a few dollars per month.
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

172 Part II ✦Practicing Safe Broadband
If you feel you need a static IP address (a unique number in all the world
in the form of 123.123.123.123 that identiﬁes a particular network device
across the Internet), check out Chapter 12 to learn about home and small
business servers that require that address.
Wireless vendors talk about access points quite a bit. A wireless router is an
access point (linking the wireless clients directly to the wired network), but not
all access points are wireless routers that include directional capabilities to send
packets to different networks. You can save money installing access points only
for connecting wireless clients to the existing wired network rather than getting
routers for every location supporting wireless client connection.
Router features
Simply put, routers route trafﬁc between two or more networks. They can be
hardware or software. Routers are extremely speciﬁc in their job description,
and in the following list you can see how many things routers don’t do in your
network.
✦Routers don’t ﬁlter packets going through them.
✦Routers don’t stop viruses going through them.
✦Routers don’t examine packets going through them.
✦Routers don’t stop hackers from penetrating your network.
✦Routers don’t hide your internal computers from outsiders.
✦Routers don’t connect multiple computers, they only connect networks.
✦Routers don’t report on Trojans sending packets out of your network.
Luckily, the hardware stand-alone routers often include ﬁrewall software and
other security software to provide a full service connection device. In this
current market, the hardware devices sold as routers almost always include the
following features:
✦Either a wiring hub to support more than one computer or a switch to
support multiple connected local networks
✦Some level of ﬁrewall or other security tools
✦Network Address Translation to hide internal IP addresses from outsiders
so hackers can’t ﬁnd and attack your computers
✦Dynamic Host Control Protocol software to allocate IP addresses to
computers on the network when they join the network for easier
administration
Some router devices include quite a few more features, but the previous list
should be your minimum acceptable feature set. Pure routers with the minimum
features listed can be bought for around $50 or less, which is why many service
now include them for free. The increasing sophistication of network device

Chapter 8 ✦Examining Your Home Broadband Hookup 173
manufacturers make for interesting combinations of features packed in a small
box along with routers today. Paying extra will get you Web ﬁltering software
(keep children from going to adult sites), time and date controls to block
Internet access after bedtime for some users, and more sophisticated security
controls against hackers.
Ethernet connections
Every router provided by a broadband service provider, or recommended by
one, must have at least one Ethernet network connection along with the
connection for the broadband service. After all, if you don’t have at least two
networks you don’t have a router.
Early routers included a single Ethernet connection, and some routers still
follow that model. The market demands inexpensive options, and a user with a
single computer (almost always a PC for this to work) can use the single-port
Ethernet to cable/DSL router to connect to an Ethernet port on the PC.
Connections between a PC and a router need a different cable conﬁguration than
connections between a network wiring device and a router. The ﬁrst option
needs a cross-over cable to match the right outgoing pins in the PC Ethernet
port to the incoming pins on the router’s Ethernet port (Ethernet hubs provide
the cross-over function, but a direct connection doesn’t use a hub). Some router
vendors include the special cross-over cable in the box, and other vendors add a
switch on the router to change the router port’s conﬁguration. I prefer the switch
on the router, because vendors of cross-over cable don’t use a special color or
differentiate it from the other, straight-through cables used all over the network.
The Linksys router in Figure 8-2 was an early model that included an Ethernet
wiring hub as part of the router itself. This worked great because people with
two, three, or four PCs could plug them all into the router and get broadband
service. If you already have a network in place, just connect one port on your
existing wiring hub to the router, and all computers will get broadband access.
Wireless connections
Some vendors now sneer at Ethernet twisted pair wiring because wires are so
pass´e. They use wireless connections, which have gotten better and faster than I
thought possible.
Figure 8-3 shows a Linksys WRV54G, a new member of the router family boasting
support for the fast new wireless standard. This case style appeared after the
formerly independent Linksys company was grabbed up by the giant network
vendor Cisco. Notice how much more businesslike the new router looks.
Just like the friendly blue router in Figure 8-2, the new corporate-looking Linksys
router includes four Ethernet ports for connecting more computers or an
existing network to the router. But the antenna sticking up gives away the fact
that this router also handles wireless connections.
Wireless connections on cable/DSL routers have been available for years and
will continue to be the “hot new thing” for a while longer. Some models don’t

Figure 8-3: An updated Linksys router with
Ethernet and advanced wireless networking
options
have the antenna sticking up, as you can see in Figure 8-4 of the Buffalo
AirStation G54 (www.buffalotech.com).
The Buffalo router includes all the features of the Linksys router in Figure 8-3,
including advanced ﬁrewall services and high-speed wireless networking. You
decide if you prefer the friendly rounded look of the Buffalo and early Linksys
routers or the more business-like appearance of the newer Linksys router.

Chapter 8 ✦Examining Your Home Broadband Hookup 175
To be fair, the newer Buffalo wireless routers with support for the higher speeds
also look more businesslike. The design is midway between the Buffalo router
pictured in Figure 8-4 and the Linksys router pictured in Figure 8-3. I guess
vendors can’t bring themselves to add the high-speed wireless access without
making the box look more serious.
Figure 8-4: Wireless but no antenna sticking up.
Router security
The term heading this section misleads you about the ability of routers to
provide security. Routers don’t do security; they send data packets as efﬁciently
as possible across a network. But now every router must have some substantial
security to make sales in this market.
Good news: Router security gets more sophisticated but easier to use with each
new version. Instead of feeling helpless when looking at security conﬁguration
pages, normal nontechnical users can make their routers reasonably safe
without sweating.
I strongly recommend a router with security tools enabled between your
computer(s) and the Internet. Even if you have a single computer, a router will
pay for itself with increased security. Default settings now protect you better than
before, and far better than the default settings of Microsoft Windows software.
Firewall software
Several legends account for the origin of the term ﬁrewall as applied to the
Internet. My favorite is the ﬁrewall in your automobile. It sits between the engine
and the passenger compartment and makes sure that never the twain shall meet.
Firewalls can be software only, such as when you ﬁnd a ﬁrewall in a router, or
they can be a hardware appliance. The hardware appliance really uses software
for the ﬁrewall control functions, but putting it in a hardware unit helps isolate
networks all the more. It gives the users a nice, secure feeling, because they have
something tangible to plug into their network.

176 Part II ✦Practicing Safe Broadband
Firewalls keep things out (like your engine should stay out of your lap while you
drive). Private networks (that’s you) set ﬁrewalls to block unauthorized access
by hackers. Figure 8-5 shows some default ﬁrewall settings.
Figure 8-5: Default ﬁrewall settings for the Linksys WRV54G.
The four types of ﬁrewalls, deﬁned in the following list, have their own strengths
and weaknesses. The more public and critical your network, the more ﬁrewall
options you throw in front of your network.
✦Packet ﬁlter: Uses predeﬁned rules to accept or reject every packet that
comes through the ﬁrewall. Difﬁcult to conﬁgure and can bog down under
heavy load.
✦Application gateway: Works with speciﬁc applications, usually File
Transfer Protocol (FTP) and terminal emulation connections (Telnet).
Special gateways for Web services are used by some large companies.
The extra level of packet inspection can slow performance.
✦Circuit level gateway: Veriﬁes established two-way connections using
TCP and UDP protocols and allows packets to ﬂow freely after the
connections are conﬁgured.
✦Proxy server: Hides the true network IP addresses of internal users by
looking like the server is doing the work. Used to provide cache services
for Web sites as well.
Firewall software provides good security, but not complete security. Okay, there’s
no such thing as a completely secure network, because people are involved. But
having a good ﬁrewall covers up many of the mistakes people make.
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Chapter 8 ✦Examining Your Home Broadband Hookup 177
The more advanced ﬁrewalls advertise Stateful Packet Inspection (SPI). This
feature tracks the state of each transaction so it can match incoming packets to
earlier outgoing packets.
You want to keep the bad guys, and their bad packets, out of your network. What
some people don’t understand is that you also want to keep bad packets inside
your network from getting out. Trojan programs, delivered by worms, often
gather and send information out so the virus writer can exploit the weak
networks found. A ﬁrewall should block those packets (and you can learn how to
conﬁgure a router to do this in Chapter 12).
Web content ﬁlters
One of the features many routers now include is a way to block access to Web
sites. You can also block certain services, such as Instant Messaging and games,
if you don’t want anyone playing those on your network.
Businesses need to take care with Internet access because one bad apple leaving
obscene Web sites on screen can cause a real employee nightmare. Whether
businesses handle this with software blocks or education is up to them.
Parents, especially those with young children, often think site blocks are the way
to handle objectionable content. I have found that is shortsighted and prone to
mistakes, even with the best content blocking software.
Here’s the quick method of controlling your children’s use of inappropriate Web
content:
✦Put the PC in the family room, not in a child’s room.
✦Put a good password on the system so children can’t use it while you’re
not there.
Sure, you can jump through the rest of the hoops, but children with the
computer in the family room behave themselves better. When people walk
through constantly, children can’t easily hide what they’re doing.
On the other hand, I am pleased with the job AOLs parental control blocks do.
Hide the icon for Internet Explorer or any other browser, and make your kids go
through the AOL browser so the parental controls are in force across the
Internet. That works for me.
At least playing with the Web content controls can be fun. Here is what my
teenage daughter is dying to get when she can drive: a Toyota Tacoma. Figure 8-6
shows the object of her desires.
But I’m not ready to buy her a truck because she’s not yet old enough to drive.
So I blocked www.Toyota.com and the keyword Tacoma as a joke.
Figure 8-7 shows what Laura saw when she looked for a truck the next day.
The tool for blocking Web sites with any router ﬁrewall is crude and far too
unintelligent to use. Linksys has a nice screen for adding Web site names and

keywords, but you can never manually put in enough keywords to block Web
sites effectively. If you want to use Web content blocking software, talk with your
service provider or look for one of the software options you can install on your
computer.
You can, however, turn off Internet access after certain hours. Linksys’ Access
Restrictions page includes a good time control setting. If you have problems
with children (of all ages) staying up too late playing on the Internet, you can
turn the router connection off at whatever time you prefer. Figure 8-8 shows that
screen. The time settings are at the top of the page, whereas the Web site and
keyword restrictions are at the bottom.
Figure 8-8: Time lock settings for the Linksys router/ﬁrewall software.
Don’t use your router ﬁrewall to block access to Web sites, and you won’t be
disappointed. Keep the computer in the family room and look over shoulders,
and you’ll block all the objectionable Web sites, not just the ones you can
remember.
Wireless Broadband Routers

180 Part II ✦Practicing Safe Broadband
Let me outline the basic wireless data communications standards used by home
and small business networks in the next section. If I can explain this clearly
enough now, you’ll have an easier time keeping the standards straight.
Wi-Fi speeds and more
Wi-Fi makes plenty of noise today, especially for a family of radio waves.
Truncated from Wireless Fidelity (a bit of a stretch for the name I think), Wi-Fi is
the new umbrella name for the standards-based wireless local area network
communications protocols. If you talk about wireless data connections, you’re
almost always talking about Wi-Fi today.
There are four current standards now called Wi-Fi:
✦802.11: The original standard, and the foundation for the others.
Released in 1997, 802.11 speciﬁes frequencies in the 2.4 GHz range and a
maximum bandwidth of 2 Mbps. Any more questions why you can’t buy
802.11 products?
✦802.11a: One of two standards delivered in 1999 that upped the speed to
something exciting. In the case of 802.11a, the speeds jumped up to 54
Mbps but used frequencies in the 5 GHz range, a regulated frequency. The
higher frequency shortened the distance but added other complications.
Vendors focused on the sibling standard, 802.11b.
✦802.11b: Uses the same unregulated frequencies around 2.4 GHz but ups
the speed to 11 Mbps. This speed matches standard 802.3 Ethernet, which
runs at 10 Mbps. Practical throughput for both is about half the rated
speeds, but that’s still far faster then the original 802.11 speciﬁcation.
✦802.11g: Released in mid-2003, although many vendors prereleased
products based on the pending standard. 802.11g ratchets the speed up to
54 Mbps while retaining the 2.4 GHz frequency range. 802.11b and 802.11g
products work together, so existing 802.11b networks can add 802.11g
gear and gain bandwidth as new access points and clients are added.
Originally, Wi-Fi referred to the 802.11b products. Chasing ever-better speeds
and marketing opportunities, Wi-Fi folks have spread the name to include all
802.11 technologies.
But don’t let that label fool you. Just because it says “Wi-Fi” doesn’t mean you
get the fastest, newest speeds and products. Intel’s Centrino systems, a nice
chipset for mobile computers, uses only 802.11b. Of course, most laptop hard
disk controllers won’t handle sustained speeds of 5 Mbps anyway. Plus, do you
remember any broadband services from cable or DSL providers that guaranteed
5 Mbps throughput? Only ADSL if you lived next door to the central ofﬁce, and
not always then.
Figure 8-9 shows the Linksys Basic Wireless Settings screen for the new WRV54G
802.11g cable/DSL wireless router. Notice the range of frequencies available and
how each channel uses a slightly different frequency.

Chapter 8 ✦Examining Your Home Broadband Hookup 181
Figure 8-9: Wireless basic settings.
The top pull-down menu, Wireless Network Mode, has four settings:
✦Disable: Turn wireless support off
✦B-only: 11 Mbps networking only
✦Mixed: 11 Mbps and 54 Mbps networking
✦G-only: 54 Mbps networking only
This illustrates my earlier point about mixing and matching 802.11b and 802.11g
products in one network. Linksys makes it easy to include both standards by
selecting the Mixed mode, as I did. However, 802.11b (11 Mbps) transmissions
monopolize the channel and force 802.11g (54 Mbps) to slow down. When only
802.11g devices are communicating, the speed remains high.
Interference
Business, and especially technology, requires constant decisions. The same goes
for Wi-Fi. 802.11, 802.11b, and 802.11g all use frequencies right around 2.4 GHz.
That frequency range is unregulated, meaning any vendor can make products
using frequencies in that range. And so many did, and not just wireless
networking vendors, either.

The following common items create interference for 802.11b and 802.11g
products:
✦Microwave ovens
✦Cordless phones
✦New Bluetooth short-range wireless devices
Most interference issues can be overcome by moving the wireless access point
or adding an antenna extender. That, or hope people making popcorn in the
microwave ﬁnish soon.
802.11b network devices use Complementary Code Keying (CCK) modulation,
relying on a single-frequency waveform. Interference on the same frequency as
your network really clobbers the data throughput.
802.11a and 802.11g network devices use Orthogonal Frequency Division
Multiplexing (OFDM), which splits data over multiple small subsignals and
transmits them at different frequencies. This lessens the interference problem
for 802.11g, but 802.11a uses a regulated frequency different from that used by
microwaves and cordless phones. The 802.11g standards group was smart to
grab the technical advantages of 802.11a and make them work with the 802.11b
products already out in the ﬁeld.
Interference doesn’t kill a Wi-Fi network connection; it just slows it way down as
the connection ﬁghts through the competing radio waves. The intermittent
nature of interference in the home or workplace makes it tough to track down
the offending products. But focus on cordless phones and microwaves.
Distances
Again you must take these numbers with a bit of skepticism, because distance
ﬁgures rival bandwidth numbers for “creative accounting.” Anything that blocks
a radio signal degrades the signal and shortens the distance. That anything
includes interference, walls, corners, and smoke. (Okay, the last two may be a
little harsh, but moving a metal ﬁle cabinet will change the radio wave pattern in
an ofﬁce.)
In the best case (outdoors) at low speeds (1 Mbps), 802.11b and 802.11g can go
over 500 meters. In the worst case, you won’t get the high-speed connection, 54
Mbps, through even one thin interior wall.
Signals go through glass better than through walls. Mounting access points
higher in the room seems to increase distance. The upcoming Antennas section
will provide ways to increase range.
Here is a list of speeds and approximate indoor distances for 802.11g:
✦54 Mbps: 20 meters (65 feet)
✦18 Mbps: 60 meters (195 feet)
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 8 ✦Examining Your Home Broadband Hookup 183
✦11 Mbps: 75 meters (245 feet)
✦1 Mbps: 125 meters (410 feet)
Does this mean the distance and speed ratings in the marketing literature are
fraudulent? Absolutely not, although they are optimistic, perhaps, but not
exactly fraudulent. You can cover a pretty large room at 54 Mbps if you put the
access point in the center of the room and place all computers within 65 feet in
any direction. Nearly 250 feet in any direction covers a pretty big warehouse at a
pretty good (11 Mbps) speed rating.
Mixing vendors
Standards, when followed, make it possible to mix and match products from
different vendors into a working network. Let me tell you how it really works.
The newer the standard, the less likely it is that products from different vendors
will work together. Why? Because all the vendors start designing their products
before the standards are ofﬁcial. If they waited until every standards committee
member gave thumbs up, their products would take another six months to reach
the market, and the market would be full of their competitors.
This standards jumping behavior infected just about every single wireless vendor
in the 802.11b market as they anticipated 802.11g. It didn’t make any sense
to see a full shelf of 802.11g products from different vendors, all claiming to be
“standards based” before the 802.11g standard was ratiﬁed, but there they were.
Can you take two ﬁrst-generation 802.11g products from different vendors and
guarantee they will work together? Absolutely not.
But by the time vendors put out their second-generation products based on
standards, working together becomes easier. The ﬁrst generation of 802.11b
products didn’t work well outside their own vendor family, but the second
generation works pretty well. The second generation of 802.11g products will
work the same way.
Buying all your wireless network products from a single vendor isn’t a bad idea,
but it’s hard to maintain. Your dealer runs out of stock when you need some
additional equipment. The vendor changes the model line, so you no longer have
the same products available. Your company buys another company, or your
company is bought.
Whatever the reason, you must start mixing products. Do it the smart way:
✦Don’t mix products from the ﬁrst generation of a standard.
✦Keep products from the same vendor in the same area.
✦Try connections at lower data rates.
✦Get products talking before adding security settings.
✦Look for Wi-Fi certiﬁcation on all products.

184 Part II ✦Practicing Safe Broadband
The Wi-Fi Alliance now includes over 200 companies selling over 1,000 products
(as of early 2004). Not every ﬁrm keeps in step with the increasing certiﬁcation
demands, but you’ll have better luck with certiﬁed products than with
uncertiﬁed ones. Plus, if they’re certiﬁed to work together and they don’t, you
stand a better chance of getting your money back.
Be ﬂexible in your installation and testing. If a wireless laptop card doesn’t work
in one laptop, try it in another. If a card and access point can’t connect, try a
different card and then a different access point.
Improving distances
People are never satisﬁed, and you’re no exception. You always want the
wireless link to reach a little bit farther and the speeds to be a little bit higher.
Vendors are never satisﬁed either. They always want you to buy more products.
Luckily, they sometimes make it easy to justify buying more. If more distance
drives you in your search, vendors have been listening.
Antennas
As you can see in Figures 8-3 and 8-4, some wireless routers have external
antennas and some don’t. External antennas can be made to stand higher and
include more usable projection area than most internal antennas, at least
according to those selling external antennas.
The older Linksys cable/DSL modem model shares a case with the wireless
routers. Some Linksys routers have one antenna, like the one shown earlier this
chapter, and some have two antennas. Double the antennas, increase your range.
To retroﬁt some earlier wireless routers, Linksys released a signal booster built
to ﬁt on top of its routers. Figure 8-10 shows the unit on the Linksys Web page.
The housing holds the electronics and extra-strength transmitter and receiver.
Cables run from the old antenna connections on the lower unit to the new booster.
Sometimes industrial strength antennas make the difference. SMC (www.smc.
com) makes a variety of wireless products that compete across the board with
Linksys and Netgear, and they have a couple of interesting antennas.
The antenna in Figure 8-11 looks the most sinister in some ways, but also pumps
out some serious power. Pushing 802.11b out to 7 miles takes some work, and
SMC says this antenna can do it.
SMC makes other antennas for shorter distances. They also make some odd
looking ones to place on ofﬁce ceilings to cover large areas and push the signal
through cubicle walls.
More power
Besides an antenna, another way to get more distance is to use more power.
Most wireless PC cards top out at 100 milliwatts (mW) and many use only

around 50mW. The SMC EliteConnect 802.11b High Power Wireless PC card
doubles the high end by using 200mW.
In real-world tests, I used one of the SMC cards and tested the signal strength
with a standard 802.11b card and then added the SMC High Power card.
I checked signal strength in four places: the same ofﬁce as the wireless access
point, the next room (20 feet and a wall away), at the top of the stairs (50 feet
and a wall and a ﬂoor away), and in the kid’s playroom (75 feet and two walls and
a ﬂoor away).
The normal 802.11b card could barely make a connection in the kid’s room: 10
percent to 15 percent signal strength and 1M to 2 Mbps throughput. Not great,
and in fact, I could never use a wireless link up to the kid’s playroom
Using the SMC High Power card along with the same Linksys Wireless Access
point in the ofﬁce as before, results were surprisingly improved. In the kid’s
room, I have 50–70 percent signal strength at a full 11 Mbps. Suddenly, with the
purchase of a different card, the connection went from not viable to comfortably
usable. A more expensive card, to be sure, but it was cheaper than adding
several more access points.
Summary
Your broadband service provider will either supply (most likely) or identify a
cable or DSL modem for your installation. Basic routers to link a computer or
network to your broadband connection have given way to routers full of
ﬁrewalls, security features, and wireless services.
Routers have dropped in price while increasing features, a happy situation for
consumers. Always use a router between your computer(s) and your cable/DSL
modem. Using a wireless router/access point cuts the cord and supports
wireless networking directly to your broadband connection and on to the
Internet. And increasing speeds arriving with newer standards (802.11g at
54 Mbps for wireless connections) in routers will make broadband networking
inside your home as easy as Web browsers have made the Internet.

hapter 8 covered what you do with broadband
after you get it into your home. In the case of a
traditional single family dwelling in the suburbs with a
white picket fence and nice ﬂowerbed, you control all
the access rights from the broadband service provider
to your internal connection. But what if you don’t
control that access? What if someone else owns the
building?
When more parties get involved, things generally get
messier, but not in this case. Service providers love
ﬁnding a dense population, which reduces their costs
because they can place a node of some type at the
location to service all the clients in the immediate area.
In some cases, service providers actually put central
ofﬁce equipment at the site and use ﬁber optic cables to
link to the real central ofﬁce.
The good news is that any modern apartment, condo,
executive suite, or ofﬁce park you move into should
have excellent broadband access and perhaps a
dedicated service provider. The bad news is that
sometimes you don’t have a choice about your service
provider and are stuck with the company holding the
contract from the landlord or property manager.
If your apartment management allows primary
broadband access providers to connect to individual
apartments, ignore this chapter. This chapter is

important only when the management of your site controls the access and
forces you to use a service provider of their choice.
Broadband When You Don’t
Control Access
Large groups of people look like a herd of customers to most large service
providers. In fact, American cities are an interesting mix of services chasing
customers (like public transportation near huge apartments) and customers
chasing services (like development around a new highway).
Often, especially today when serious money is at stake, developers and service
providers get together and strike a deal long before individual customers have
a chance to mess up their plans by choosing a different service provider.
Governments get in on the act as well, choosing cable TV franchises for
communities, and, of course, there used to be a single phone company for
everyone.
You can get upset about the lack of control you have over your broadband access
when you move into a multitenant situation if you want, but you won’t suffer.
When cable TV came out, and satellite TV afterwards, apartments and other
multitenant properties received service long before surrounding residential
areas. After all, if you were starting a service, wouldn’t you want to hook up as
many customers as possible with the least expense? That means multitenant
customers got connected ﬁrst to generate cash ﬂow for further expansion.
The building local exchange carrier
Yikes! Another confusing acronym! Building Local Exchange Carrier (BLEC) now
tries to force its way into conversation, but honestly the sound of BLEC doesn’t
bode well for wide acceptance.
However, a service provider resident at your apartment or condo can make life
much easier. Apartment managers don’t get any training on broadband network
management and sometimes struggle just to keep the elevators and
washing machines running. Farming out broadband service to a specialized third
party makes great sense for those managers and residents.
Ofﬁce buildings were the ﬁrst targets of BLECs (say that out loud although
keeping a pleasant image in mind), especially those buildings outside the easy
reach of the telephone company central ofﬁce or cable node. Although many
newer buildings include ﬁber optic cable connections to central services, this
feature doesn’t cover anywhere near the majority of buildings needing service.
The equipment developed by service providers to reach out to ofﬁce buildings
works perfectly well in apartments and condos today. In fact, a building local
exchange carrier almost always provides faster broadband access and speedier

Chapter 9 ✦Examining the Multitenant Broadband Hookup 189
service connections than either telephone companies with DSL or cable
operators.
How is this possible? When developing access equipment for remote sites, often
called “edge connections” (as in the edge of the network), vendors added
remote management tools to avoid having to send a technician out to each
building for each change. After a building has the wiring required to connect
each client location to the site of the edge connection hardware (usually a
basement wall beside the incoming trunk lines for the telephone connections),
service can be added, modiﬁed, or deleted for any client ofﬁce or apartment
through management software from a remote ofﬁce.
That’s exactly how these companies can connect you with broadband access in
as little as an hour. (Vendors make this exact promise to building owners.) Here’s
what happens (best case):
1. You arrange for service.
2. The service provider activates the port on the access hardware at that
location that connects to your apartment or ofﬁce.
3. You plug in your computer to the provided wall plug or broadband modem.
4. High speed Internet broadband access zooms you to the Internet.
Well-managed buildings make these arrangements before you arrive, just as they
do with other services. Some details must be arranged, such as username,
password, and network authentication details, but this is exactly the way you get
telephone service. When you move to a new apartment, you don’t have to beg
the phone company to run a wire to your apartment, because it’s already there.
Broadband service providers hope you soon assume the same level of readiness
for broadband access in new apartments.
Connection speeds from your building to the central ofﬁce or other access
provider ofﬁce vary. Less populated locations will generally have at least a T1
connection, meaning a 1.5 Mbps connection to share among all residents. A
bigger client population almost always means faster backhaul speeds from the
building to the access provider’s Internet connection location.
Not all third-party providers at a multitenant site are full-ﬂedged local exchange
carriers. Often the developer farms out management, up to and including billing,
to a service provider. You call your provider for service details and for technical
support.
Physical connection options
A service provider’s dream, apartments, condos, ofﬁce buildings, and executive
suites (and hotels, but that’s a different book) put hundreds or thousands of
broadband customers in one location. You already know the service providers
want you to assume service is waiting and demand access as part of expected
amenities.

190 Part II ✦Practicing Safe Broadband
There are three ways to provide the physical connections to support broadband
service in such a concentrated location:
✦Run new wiring (Category 5 UTP or coax or ﬁber) to every client location
(apartment, ofﬁce, condo, and so on)
✦Piggyback new broadband service over existing wiring
✦Spread wireless access points around the complex
Apartment developers are getting smarter and adding more connections to each
unit for broadband services. Ofﬁce building developers learned long ago to add
these extra connections and always to provide service connections to a central
point in every new ofﬁce built.
Depending on the broadband service access provider for your building, you
may have a broadband modem, router, or other hardware device in your unit for
connection.
If your building doesn’t have some type of broadband access wiring in place,
the owners probably won’t add it for you. The cost of rewiring an apartment
building, or any other multitenant property, jumps up pretty quickly. The cost of
wiring a new building during construction is minimal.
DSL service providers make a cost-effective option for older buildings without
any type of broadband access wiring to each unit. The good news for each
tenant is that because the building has its own node, speeds to each unit should
be pretty high. Most DSL companies that service buildings guarantee at least
1 Mbps downstream speeds. (Your mileage may vary.)
A few companies, such as www.icetech.net, are starting to sell apartment
complexes wirelessaccessservice that allows users to wander around the grounds
with their laptops or PDAs and remain connected to the network. This will be
great for some, but make others extremely paranoid. Security and authentication
will need to be at a higher level, obviously, than on the systems where your
connection over physical wire helps set your security and authentication.
But this does illustrate the increasing reach and capabilities of wireless vendors.
Wireless providers can, of course, provide the edge connection equipment for
your apartment or ofﬁce. You may never know you have a wireless Internet
connection because each apartment or ofﬁce will connect via wire to the edge
connection equipment and the router for service provider access.
Apartments
The good news for you, the apartment resident, is some type of service will be
delivered to your apartment. In rare cases, you will have a choice. In equally rare
cases, a single connection to each apartment will provide all telephone, Internet,
and TV services through a breakout box in the apartment.
When looking for a new apartment, ask about broadband access. Equipment
vendors always pitch the value of advertising broadband access in their
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 9 ✦Examining the Multitenant Broadband Hookup 191
marketing literature aimed at apartment owners. It would make them feel good
to have you verify the value of broadband access to the apartment managers by
demanding broadband Internet access. Frankly, many apartment residents will
use a broadband access service much more than a pool.
If broadband service is important to you (you bought this book, so it must be),
verify upfront your broadband service options. Your best negotiation time is
before you sign a lease contract, because you can still walk to the next
apartment complex and sign a lease there.
If broadband access is not provided, but you really like the apartment complex,
check into your options. Services like DSL may be available if you’re close
enough to a central ofﬁce. Large apartment clusters in one neighborhood often
force the telephone company to put a central ofﬁce in the area to handle the
customer load. If this is the case, DSL of some ﬂavor may be no problem, but you
must conﬁrm that fact before you sign a contract.
Because almost every apartment complex already has cable TV, you may be able
to get broadband service from the cable provider. Most systems today allow the
cable company to split the broadband from the TV frequencies inside your
apartment with a splitter. Your Internet connection may have to be close to your
TV, but that might not be a problem and could be an advantage.
Verifying your service provider of choice will connect you at the requested
apartment. Verifying your apartment will allow the service provider any access
necessary to install your connection. Write that information on your contract, or
you’ll be sorry. Chat sites for broadband include many tales of woe from people
dialing in to complain about territorial ﬁghts between apartment managers,
phone companies, and DSL providers. The companies ﬁght, service never gets
installed, and the individuals listen to the modem connection dirge and wish
they’d chosen a different apartment.
Although you’re verifying things, make sure your apartment broadband access
service rate is cheaper, or at least not more expensive, than the rates charged
directly by the service provider. Volume discounts from the service provider to
the apartment owner should be passed to you. If not, at least you shouldn’t be
charged extra.
If you’re a big wireless broadband access fan, you may be able to put a transceiver
on your balcony and get service. But be sure your apartment allows that
hardware installation. If the apartment complex has its own service provider, the
rules probably outlaw attaching hardware to bypass that service. Verify or regret.
What to ask the landlord
If it seems there are a lot of questions to ask before you sign your lease, you are
correct. Let me provide a checklist so you can objectively decide whether an
apartment will get you acceptable broadband service.
Notice that you can decide whether a detail doesn’t matter in your situation. If
you live by yourself, you may not care about concurrent connections, for
example. You may prefer to pay for your broadband access as part of your rent,

❑Acceptable

It doesn’t really matter what your answers are, just that you’ve thought about
the process and understand what you’re willing to accept for your broadband
service. After you discover what’s important to you, making your choices will
generate less mental uncertainty.
Keeping your old e-mail address
When you move to an apartment with a broadband service provider and no
choices (take its service or dialup) you get a new e-mail address. Some people
don’t really care, but many people ﬁnd that horribly inconvenient. If you want to
keep your e-mail address, there are ways to do so.
You can always plan ahead and get an e-mail address from one of the free
services, such as Yahoo, Hotmail, or iWon. There are a variety of Web sites that
provide vanity names or other permanent e-mail addresses not tied to your
service provider. Once you have this address, you can forward mail to this
account from whatever broadband service provider your apartment building
uses.
This plan requires you to plan ahead a year or two, so it won’t work for all
people. The other ways to keep your existing e-mail address cost money.
You can keep your account at your current Internet service provider after you
get broadband service. The ex-provider will be happy to let you do so, because
you’ll pay the monthly charge but you won’t dial in and use one of their modem
ports.
There are two advantages with this system: you can keep your old e-mail
address (and any personal Web pages) and you have a back-up dial-up option in
case something happens to your broadband service provider.
A third advantage, especially if you use AOL, is a reduced price on your old
service. Because you connect to the old services (e-mail account) the provider
will want to charge you something. But because you don’t dialup through that
provider’s network, the cost of supporting you is lower, and the price for the
service drops. Look for the AOL broadband with 5-hour dial-up plan, which costs
$15 versus $24 for the regular dial-up plan (as of early 2004). It’s not free, but it’s
nearly half price. If your current service provider has a national presence, it may
have a similar option.
If you keep AOL when you add a broadband service provider, which I did
because my teenage daughter threatened me with unending hatred if I
disconnected her from all her AOL-IM buddies, you make a simple change on the
AOL Sign On screen. Tell AOL to connect over broadband (cable/DSL/ISP) in the

Location line on the main screen. The program tests your network connection,
ﬁnds a broadband service provider already hooking you to the Internet, and
zooms through the connection sequence.
If you have a different service provider you want to keep, you keep your same
e-mail address and thus you get your mail from the same e-mail server as before.
Your outgoing e-mail server, however, must be the one provided by your
broadband service provider.
For Outlook Express, the critical name is the outgoing e-mail server name.

address and click Next. Provide the e-mail server type, e-mail server name, and
(ﬁnally) the outgoing mail (SMTP) server name.
Figure 9-1: Setting e-mail server details in Outlook Express.
Your incoming e-mail server will not be named mail.your-service.com but
will be supplied by your service provider. In the case of Comcast cable
broadband access, the incoming e-mail server is mail.comcast.net. This will
be the name you have been using, so you won’t need to change this setting.
The outgoing mail (SMTP) server ﬁeld will include the outgoing e-mail server
name provided by your new broadband service provider. Following the example
of Comcast in the previous paragraph, the outgoing e-mail server is named
smtp.comcast.net.

Tech Bits
SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transport Protocol. It’s called Simple be-
cause it was developed before the Internet became a land of spam-
mers, and the security model assumes people using e-mail servers were
honorable.
To stop (or at least slow down) spammers and hackers, service providers almost
never accept outgoing e-mail that doesn’t originate on their service. That’s why
you can’t continue to use your old outgoing e-mail server. If you try to use it,
after moving to a broadband service provider, your old e-mail server will reject
your messages and perhaps block you as a spammer.
Changing service providers may be a hassle, but you can overcome it. At least
you can keep your e-mail address, even if it costs a few dollars a month to
maintain service from two Internet service providers (old dialup and new
broadband).
Condos
Condos have much in common with apartments as far as broadband access.
However, instead of an apartment manager you may have homeowners
association, and they can be crazier than any apartment manager.
The good news from the world of condos is they attract the same type of
third-party service provider that apartments do. Many people in one place
makes for interested service providers, and condos ﬁt that bill
If your condo management made a deal with a third-party broadband service
provider, you’re in the same position as described in the previous Apartments
section. The checklist in the Apartments section provides all the questions you
need to ask your condo management.
One sticky detail with some condos is the homeowners association, drunk with
power and governed by aesthetics. You may not have an option to attach any
type of external antenna to your property, even though it is certainly your
property. If that’s the case, your hopes for wireless or satellite broadband access
may be dashed. For that matter, so may your hopes for satellite TV.
The restrictions on external antennas will be diligently enforced if the condo
developer or homeowners association has a contract with a third-party
broadband service provider. If that’s the case, the provider picked by the
association will be your broadband service provider as well. So skip ahead to the
next major section entitled “Security Control Points” and learn how to protect
your computer while using their broadband service.
Executive suites
Individual ofﬁces inside a building, with shared amenities, such as conference
rooms, telephone services, and (sometimes) a receptionist, are great options for
small business people who don’t want an ofﬁce in their home or apartment.

196 Part II ✦Practicing Safe Broadband
Executive suites offer the look and sound of a company larger than the one
person sitting in a rented ofﬁce.
The advantages, and rationalization for the cost of an executive suite, are the
added amenities. Everything a person needs for a company ofﬁce should be
provided, including telephone, fax, receptionist, coffee machine, and network
connection. Executive suites usually inhabit a ﬂoor inside a commercial building
with multiple service providers, and one or more of those providers will supply
service to the executive suite.
You may not have a choice of service providers, but you will likely get faster and
more reliable service at an executive suite than at any residence. If the executive
suite doesn’t offer full high-speed network connection options, keep looking for
an executive suite that does.
Ofﬁce parks
Ofﬁce parks, planned developments built and managed by one company, can
offer most of the same advantages as an executive suite does, and probably
more. Most include multiple buildings and multiple options for all types of
service, not just broadband access.
The other end of the spectrum appears as well, when an ofﬁce park offers little
or nothing except the space you rent. In cases like this, your situation is no
different than any business. You must get your broadband service provider
connection yourself directly from the provider.
If that minimalist approach was taken by your landlord, ask your neighbors who
supplies their broadband Internet access. It may be a phone company, the cable
company, or a specialized business-only provider. No matter who it is, any
provider that already has one customer in the ofﬁce park will want to get
another one. You may even get a discount if the network equipment installed for
your neighbor can support your needs as well.
Service from the landlord
Security in a multitenant situation ranges from absolutely wonderful to abysmal.
If your apartment manager and leasing company tries to run broadband access
themselves, chances are your security will lean toward the abysmal end of the
spectrum. If your apartment management brought in a third party to handle
broadband issues for them, you should be in good shape. If the third party
broadband access provider takes ownership responsibility for all Internet access
and puts switching equipment on the site, you should have great security.
When your landlord tries to perform all broadband access services, you must
take extra precautions. Internet access protection in the world of spam, viruses,
and hackers requires more technical expertise than most apartment
management companies can muster.

Chapter 9 ✦Examining the Multitenant Broadband Hookup 197
You want to protect yourself, from Internet problems and landlord problems.
This will take some effort if your apartment management is clueless or malicious.
Billing questions
Money makes people weird. Get billing questions answered before signing the
lease. Who bills for the broadband access? Is the service cost rolled into the
rent, or is there a separate charge?
If broadband service is included within the rent amount, you will have a difﬁcult
time deducting money for poor broadband access without looking like a rent
deadbeat. Tenants have some rights, but landlords have more in most of the U.S.
states. Can you deduct the portion of the rent payment if your broadband
service isn’t usable for most of the month? How much is the broadband access
portion? Will the landlord report your deduction for poor broadband service to
credit agencies as a services dispute, or a rent nonpayment?
The best situation you can hope for is that the broadband service is billed
separately and does not reﬂect on your credit rating if withheld for poor service.
But withholding any portion of your rent makes for a sticky situation with rental
management.
Separate terms of service
Each landlord includes a variety of thou shalt nots in every lease: that you won’t
run a criminal enterprise in the apartment, that you won’t steal the appliances,
and sometimes that you won’t badmouth the apartment complex to anyone
publicly or privately.
Broadband service providers include Terms of Service in their sign-up contracts:
that you won’t transfer obscene material through their system, that you won’t
spam, and sometimes that you won’t badmouth them, either.
If your landlord provides broadband access, will conﬂicts in one area spill over
to the next? If your computer is hijacked by one of the multiple viruses running
around that turn your PC (they exploit Windows vulnerabilities) into a spam-
sending e-mail server, will that violate your rental agreement? If it does, can they
throw you out of the apartment with little or no warning?
This may seem farfetched, and I hope for your sake it is. However, read the ﬁne
print on your lease and you may be surprised by the rights the landlord holds over
your housing status and credit rating. Landlords put all those restrictions in the
lease so they can protect themselves and throw you out if you become a problem.
When you ﬁnd that type of information in a lease, the rental agent will always tell
you “that never happens” and personally guarantee you’ll never have a problem
like that. But unless the agent amends the contract to reﬂect those words, those
promises are just random noises to reassure you until you sign the lease and
give up some of your rights.

198 Part II ✦Practicing Safe Broadband
Service level agreement
Broadband service providers tout their uptime and service reliability. Does
your landlord guarantee a certain percentage of uptime? If so, what are the
procedures for you to follow if your uptime drops below those levels?
If your cable broadband access connection drops for two weeks, do you get a
free month of service, your bill reduced by half, or nothing at all? If the lease
and broadband service agreement don’t spell out these details, you’ll get
nothing.
Support contacts
You will, I promise, need a contact to call about broadband access service
problems. No matter how good your service provider, there will be a problem.
If your site landlord is your service contact, expect more problems than
solutions. Good service departments are rare, and the chances of your
apartment management company being one of the few good ones borders on
hilarious.
Privacy assurances
Broadband service providers should always list their privacy policies so you can
read their idea of privacy before you sign up for their service. Here are some of
the questions you should ask:
✦Does the provider resell your name and address to afﬁliated companies?
✦Does the provider resell your name and address to everyone?
✦Does the provider sell your physical address information, or just your
e-mail address?
✦Does the provider track which Web sites you visit and sell that
information to other companies?
✦Does the provider notify you when someone ofﬁcial requests your online
activity information?
Unfortunately, some service providers do, in fact, resell, track, and monitor
constantly. You should know these details so you can decide whether you want
to ﬁnd a more polite service provider.
Landlords have speciﬁc rights to monitor and even search your premises
depending on the situation and the laws of your state. Do they automatically
extend those invasive rights to everything you do on the Internet? If so, they
should tell you and let you decide whether to allow these intrusions by signing
the lease or going to a less nosy apartment complex.

Chapter 9 ✦Examining the Multitenant Broadband Hookup 199
Update your security
No matter how pleasant or onerous the answers from your landlord are about
the issues in the previous sections, you must update your security if your
landlord provides broadband access. Go through your computer(s) and verify if
the following are in place:
✦Operating system updates (particularly for Windows versions)
✦Active and updated virus protection
✦Active and updated spam protection
✦Active and updated personal ﬁrewall
All of these features are smart Internet precautions, no matter what. But when
your apartment landlord provides your broadband access service, they move
from smart precautions to mandatory. You don’t want to pay the penalty for
your management company’s Internet ineptitude.
Summary? If your landlord and/or apartment management company provides
your broadband service, you may soon be disappointed and eventually look
elsewhere. However, if you ask the right questions before signing the lease or
contract, you will have more control over your broadband access situation and
time to make alternative arrangements if necessary.
Service from a third party
Some questions for your broadband service provider need be asked no matter
who does the providing. If your apartment group uses a third-party that
specializes in broadband access service you’ll have better luck all the way
around. It doesn’t matter if this company specializes in multitenant systems as
much as it does in broadband access.
Support contact
Ask for the support contact when you sign your lease, even before you move in.
The more warning you can give the service provider, the better your chances of
getting the service you want and having it ready when you arrive.
All Internet service providers have customer support centers of some type, along
with information concerning what clients should do to get started. These service
centers may not be staffed with phone-answering people 24 × 7, but they will
have some type of help online and numbers you can call at least part of the time.
Verify your billing options with the third-party before you get connected. It’s
easier to get the type of billing you want upfront than it is to change afterward. If
the bills come with your rent invoice each month, and the apartment forwards

200 Part II ✦Practicing Safe Broadband
the money to the service provider, ask about receipts or conﬁrmation to avoid
potential service hassles later.
Service level agreement and privacy
The service level agreement from a third-party service provider should be
considerably better than that from an apartment management team. Service
providers almost always offer some type of payment rebate when they drop the
ball too often or too long.
Privacy concerns still exist, but service providers tend to protect privacy much
more than apartment leasing companies do. Besides, if you a broadband service
payment, the provider doesn’t get nearly as upset as an apartment manager
would. The government can still demand your service details from a service
provider under laws associated with the Patriot Act, but your apartment
manager can’t snoop into your Internet activities if a third-party provider
delivers your Internet connection.
Keeping your account
As soon as you ﬁnd you really like your broadband service provider at your
apartment, you’ll probably start looking for another apartment for some reason.
If the service provider handles one apartment complex, it may well handle
others. If you have started receiving substantial e-mail trafﬁc or hits to your
personal Web site, you may want to keep the same provider.
If your provider services another apartment complex from which you wish to
rent, take care of the paperwork before giving notice at the ﬁrst apartment.
Sometimes these customer exit processes are automated to their own
detriment. If you give notice, the apartment contract with the service provider
may state to notify the service provider and stop all access at a certain date.
They may even scrub your account and leave no record of you or your e-mail
address.
Think ahead, and you won’t have to ﬁll out the new client paperwork again,
speeding your service availability in the new place. Planning ahead will also
keep a ton of e-mail from bouncing the week your e-mail address falls into
limbo.
Onsite broadband router
If your apartment (or condo or executive suite) supports enough broadband
clients, the service provider probably installed some edge connection
equipment onsite. Most likely, this unit will be a router of some type paired with
a multiplexor handing the cabling connections throughout the site. After all, one
of their big selling points, fast service for customers, demands they keep
equipment onsite to support the clients.

Chapter 9 ✦Examining the Multitenant Broadband Hookup 201
Your connection won’t be much different if it’s from a router in the basement or
a service provider in the neighborhood. There can be a couple of differences,
however, so let me explain two quick things.
Firewall
The router at your location may include a ﬁrewall or the service provider may
rely on its ﬁrewall between the entire network and the Internet. For extra
security protection, a ﬁrewall at your site is preferable. After all, you have no
reason to trust every other client of your service provider. You want to keep a
buffer between you and as many people as possible.
If the ﬁrewall is at your site, the service provider will have another one at its
ofﬁce as well. When you get the IP addresses and port numbers for game
connections, verify you’re getting all the necessary ﬁrewall client details and
your contact knows that you may have a ﬁrewall at your apartment as well.
Network address translation
Network Address Translation (NAT) details will appear, in depth, in Chapter 12,
but I want to mention something now. Your service provider should use network
address translation for each router-based site, including your apartment
complex. Network address translation converts the private, hidden IP address of
your computer into a known, public IP address when your data packets zoom
about the Internet. This keeps outsiders from seeing your real IP address and
targeting your real computer.
If they don’t use network address translation, it means your entire apartment
complex will be on one big happy network with little security between you and
the weirdo who skulks around the washing machines. Not good, because each
client connection should go to a separate physical port on the local router or
multiplexor.
This all-on-one method of placing everyone in the complex on one network is
stupid, but has been done from early on in Internet history. Demand network
address translation on each connection, if possible. Adjust your security
mindset accordingly if there’s a shared network connection. Check for this
networking method by going to Start ➪My Network Places and clicking the View
Network Computers in the menu on the left. If you see one or more computers
you don’t know, they can also see you. Oops.
If you can see other computers on your local network, they can see you (over
the network, not physically). That means you must complain to the service
provider and increase your security proﬁle. Although waiting for help, stay off
the network unless you’re actively surﬁng or getting e-mail. Do not leave the
computer turned on while connected to your broadband access provider in this
situation.

Summary
When you are in an apartment or other multitenant situation, your broadband
service provider choice may be completely out of your hands. Verify that the
apartment you want to move into has an adequate broadband access system for
your needs.
If some adjustments will make your connections better, ask. But ask before you
sign the lease, because when the ink dries on your lease, you’re stuck with the
conditions inside the lease and any additions you made.

onnecting to a broadband service provider pushes
you to connect other devices to broadband as well.
After all, for a few extra dollars every computer in the
house can enjoy fast broadband surﬁng.
The software side of networking includes conﬁguring
devices, handling network addresses, and a bit about
secure network routing. Underneath it all is TCP/IP, the
protocol that connects the Internet (and just about
everything else in the world today).
More computing means more people making more data
and more reasons to protect that data. A little planning
will avoid lost ﬁles and accidentally deleted documents,
and keep your favorite ﬁles, photos, and music safe and
sound.

o one ever has enough space. Not enough space
in their closet, their garage, or their hard disk.
After you start relying on your computer, the disk space
melts away like a snowball in July.
The solution to this problem isn’t to stop relying on your
computer but to manage your data better. Adding more
storage without a plan makes it harder to ﬁnd what
you’re looking for. But adding storage as a way to share
data, streamline controlling data, and ensure data is
protected makes computing life much easier.
Why You Want a
Home Server
I’ve had friends laugh at me when I’ve told them they will
need dedicated ﬁle servers in their homes before long.
They accused me of being a shill for server companies.
Then I tell them they will need to buy more computer
books, and they accuse me of being a shill for publishers.
I won’t argue that I’d like to see more computer books
sold (especially the ones with my name on them,
because I’m being honest), but I will argue with the ﬁrst
part. You can make a home server without buying a new
box of any kind. The goal is to gain the important
beneﬁts a home server provides.
A server serves, so a home server provides a
centralized storage location for ﬁles of all types,
including documents, photos, music, and ﬁ-
nancial records. Servers often provide security
and authentication for users, blocking those not

deﬁned in the system and allowing identiﬁed users access to certain
areas only (if you wish to be restrictive). Business servers also host
databases, Web servers, and e-mail servers.
I walk around the houses of my accusatory friends and start pointing. There’s
the “family” computer, which usually means it’s too slow for the kids to play
games on. That means there’s at least one computer for the children, and often
each child has his or her own computer. If one or both parents work for a large
company, there’s at least one laptop, and often two.
The conversations tend to go like this: “What’s on that computer?” I ask,
pointing to the family system.
“Nothing much. Nothing all that important.”
“Really?” I ask, looking at their digital camera. “Where are the images from your
digital camera?”
Turns out they’re on that computer and scattered around the children’s
computers as well. But when I ask to see the Christmas pictures from 2 years
back, no one remembers where they are. A search ensues until I stop them.
“Where are your online banking ﬁles? Where are your ﬁnancial records?” Turns
out that “nothing much” computer data includes their ﬁnancial history.
It also includes e-mails going back years, including some from family members
no longer around. Are there printed copies of those e-mails? No. Are there
backed up copies? No.
The kid’s computer(s) generally include homework, study notes, and personal
items like pictures from friends. How would you feel if I replaced that computer
with a brand new, faster unit? Kewl. What if all your data went to the dump with
the old computer? Can’t do that.
What about music? Kids tend to have plenty of MP3 music ﬁles on their hard
disks, some from downloading and some from copying ﬁles off the physical CDs
they own. Would you like to play those ﬁles on your stereo? Kewl. Just run a long
cable from your room to the stereo. Not kewl. Need a server.
Company laptop owners often create PowerPoint presentations on their home
computer, and then e-mail them to themselves at work. Why? Getting the
presentations from their home computer to the laptop means more effort than
they want to face.
The messy side of home computing
A few more questions like these, and the truth comes out. People’s computer
images, music, and data ﬁles are messier than their closets. Look at more than
one computer in a household and you ﬁnd the following:
✦Files are scattered around.
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 10 ✦Server and Storage Options 207
✦Backups for critical personal and business data are nonexistent.
✦Some hard disks are getting full and others have plenty of open space.
✦There is no way to share a high-speed broadband connection.
✦There is no way to play music ﬁles on another computer or a stereo.
✦There is no easy way to move work ﬁles from a home computer to a
laptop and vice versa.
It’s painful when family members realize they’ve spent thousands of dollars on
technology they can’t control. It’s almost funny when they realize some of their
aggravation about computers can be avoided with planning and a home network
designed to make their computing life easier.
Cleaning up home computing
A home server turns a computer mess into something reliable and useful for
everyone. Well, it can, if it’s done right. But like most things concerning
computers, you can also turn a small mess and headache into a giant mess and a
migraine.
My advice for those adding a server is to think of organization ﬁrst. When
properly organized, the rest of the server beneﬁts appear naturally.
Connecting devices
When you tell people they need to network computers (and storage devices
and printers and backup devices etc.) together they freak out, imagining wires
snaking down the halls and holes drilled in walls.
Relax.
Yes, wires do connect devices, especially devices close to each other. You will
almost certainly use an Ethernet patch cable to connect your cable/DSL modem
to your router. If a computer is on the same desk, you will use a cable to connect
it to the router. These small patch cables will disappear among all the other
messy cables computer spawn, such as the power, mouse, keyboard, and
monitor cables. But that cable mess is not necessary throughout your home or
ofﬁce.
Chapter 14 explains how to choose between wired and wireless con-
nections, depending on your situation. It also explains how to network
devices through the power plugs in your home or ofﬁce, meaning no
extra cables at all.
Chapter 15 tells how to connect devices using radio waves rather than
wires, the ultimate neat and organized solution. Although wireless ven-
dors like to show people lounging by a swimming pool reading e-mail on
a laptop, connecting the den computer to your broadband router with-
out wires is even more useful. Not as photogenic, perhaps, but greatly
appreciated.

208 Part III ✦Moving from Stand Alone PCs to a Network
Organization
People really want to be organized, but it takes time. Once you let a small pile
turn into a giant pile, either physically or electronically, attempts at organization
meet more of a mental block than an actual physical problem.
With a centralized hard disk for data storage, you can place all the data ﬁles in
one area, the music in another, the photos in their own section, and on and on.
You can do this with folders, or make each area look like a completely separate
hard drive.
Each person can keep a stash of favorite ﬁles, pictures, or songs on his or her
own computer, but still put a copy on the server. This also makes a quick backup
copy for recovery from accidents, such as your mouse crawling down to delete
the wrong ﬁle. Or worse, overlaying a good ﬁle with a junk ﬁle with the same
name. The Recycle bin on Windows won’t save you from that little mistake.
(Don’t ask.) But having a copy on the server will bring that ﬁle back in a ﬂash.
Backup
Computers are harsh, inanimate creatures. When you screw up, by clicking
Delete instead of Rename on a context menu, computers do what you tell them
to without any guilt.
People often consider backups valuable only when their entire computer crashes
and burns (sometimes literally). Backups save data then, obviously, but they
also work in less disastrous situations. Delete some work ﬁles because you think
you don’t need them anymore, then change your mind? A backup will save them.
All those photos you’ve been archiving? If they’re only on one hard disk, and
that disk fails or something else happens, those photos are gone. The MP3 ﬁles
you copied from your own, legal, CDs? Sure, you can copy them again off the
CDs, but wouldn’t you rather have a handy backup of those music ﬁles?
Businesses particularly need backups, for internal reasons and often to comply
with government regulations. Individuals may not go out of business if they lose
their ﬁles. Want to face your IRS ﬁling deadline after you realize that last year’s
ﬁles were on that PC you traded in for your new one? Learn to make backups.
Share ﬁles
You may not want to share your accounting ﬁles with the entire family, and you
can certainly keep them private on your home server. But you may want to share
photos, music ﬁles, family trees, electronic greeting cards, downloaded jokes,
books online, or sound effects. You can do all that, and more, with shared,
centralized storage, such as that provided by a server.
Share printers
Some people believe, and I’m one of them, that the biggest kick start to the local
area network industry was the original HP LaserJet printer. Those ﬁrst printers
fascinated businesses as employees demanded to have their own LaserJets.
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 10 ✦Server and Storage Options 209
But because the price was high, sharing printers over a new-fangled network
became the plan.
Today you can buy a new inkjet printer for less than you spend on replacement
ink cartridges for the same printer (at least for some low-end printers), so the
urge to share printers has dropped. Yet some printers, such as high-end photo
printers, are far too expensive to put on every computer in the house. Besides,
photo printers aren’t the best things to use for school reports or business
presentations. The modern wired household may have as many printers as
computers. With a network and some centralized control, you can share the
printing wealth with little effort and no hassle.
Security
Any computer you can get your hands on physically is not a secure computer. If
you don’t want to share the ﬁles on your personal computer with everyone in
the house, you can put those ﬁles on a server.
Because you don’t type or view a server, you can lock it up or hide it in a closet.
(I’ve seen this, believe it or not.) And because some servers have no keyboard,
mouse, monitor, or CD-ROM drive, the information inside that server can be
reached only by a network user with the correct username and password.
Here’s a basic guideline for public and private ﬁle storage folder on a server:
✦Public
• Photos
• Music
• Reference
✦Private
• Dad
• Mom
• Child-1
• Child-2
• Dog
• Finances
In the folder organization shown, everyone will have access to the Public folder
and all folders contained therein. Inside the Private folder, each user will have
access to the one folder set up for them and them only. Although I suppose the
Finances folder can be shared among the parents only, especially when they’re
spending the children’s inheritance.
The server operating system requires a username and password to grant access
to the server resources. When, for example, Child-1 (Alex, in this case) provides
the correct username and password, the server allows Alex to see all the Public

210 Part III ✦Moving from Stand Alone PCs to a Network
folder ﬁles, but only the \Private\Child-1 folder in the Private folder. As far as
Child-1 is concerned, there are no other folders in the Private folder area. Laura,
Child-2, can’t see the ﬁles in Alex’s folder, or any of the other folders in the
Private area. And I certainly don’t want our dog, Hunter, to see we could afford
more dog toys than we already buy him.
Do you want to lock Aunt Bessie’s family reunion pictures away from the rest of
the family? No, or probably not, depending on Aunt Bessie’s photos. But a server
makes it easy to restrict access to some folders although allowing anyone on the
network to see other folders.
Capacity
Personal computers have large storage capacities, especially compared to
computers from a few years ago. But when you need to add storage space, it
makes the most sense, and is most cost effective, to add space everyone can use.
Servers of any sort, whether full-ﬂedged network ﬁle servers with e-mail and
Web services along with tight security, or what amounts to an extra hard disk on
the network, make disk capacity available to everyone on the network. If your
family generates lots of data, which happens quickly when you start using music
or video ﬁles, a central ﬁle server will come in handy. It’s easier to put one 120GB
drive in a server than it is to add three 40GB drives to individual computers. It’s
also cheaper.
Media hub
Don’t look now, but your TV will soon become computer network savvy. If you
have a TiVo or other Personal Video Recorder (PVR), you’re halfway there
already.
Computer vendors aren’t happy with controlling your ofﬁces at work and at
home. Now they want to control the den at home as well.
High-end audio equipment now includes Ethernet connectors. You can play a
DVD in computers now and pipe that video to your TV (with the right extra
equipment). The computer and entertainment worlds are colliding. The “media
hub” according to vendors is nothing more than a home server.
Of course, when you buy a “media hub entertainment coordinating device,” you
pay big bucks for the hype and label. But with a home server, you have many of
the advantages of the media hub without the huge hole in your wallet.
Why You Need a Small Business Server
Home users, even the most technically advanced and gadget-laden, don’t really
need a server. They can beneﬁt from a home server, and having one will make
many things easier and more secure.
Businesses are a different story. Wasting time at home looking for a lost ﬁle or
trying to replace a deleted photo just keeps you from watching more mediocre

television. But losing ﬁles in a business, or losing all your ﬁles, means the end of
that business more often than not.
A U.K. research report from the spring of 2003 laid out the stark details. Small
businesses that lost their data due to system failures or a ﬁre (a pretty severe
system failure, but all too common), stood only a 50–50 percent chance of survival.
Lose your data systems, and your company stands only as much chance as a
coin ﬂip of surviving. Not encouraging.
Even less encouraging was the discovery that only half of small businesses had a
business backup plan in place. Another ﬂip of the coin, but one the business
owners controlled.
A home-based business can generate plenty of income. A home-based business
that loses all data records due to computer failure can’t generate any income.
The same goes for a small business outside the home. No computers in business
today means no business.
Backup
Backing up Aunt Bessie’s family photos is nice. Backing up the business records
of Aunt Bessie’s Photo Emporium is crucial.
Although the primary mover of early network installations was the HP LaserJet, I
always maintained the primary beneﬁt of a server was data backup. Centralized
servers back up all the data, either manually or automatically from each
computer client, and provide one location from which all backups can run.
Centralized storage means centralized backup and that means data security.
Chapter 13 covers various backup options, tools, and best ways to make
backups easier, but there are two critical areas, both provided by using a server,
to consider now:
✦Easy, reliable, regular, and automatic data backups
✦Off-site storage of backed up data
If you have a small business, in your home or in another location, a server may
make the difference between you being in business after a problem or throwing
in the proverbial towel. Like them or not, computers run the majority of
businesses today. Trusting Lady Luck with your data security will likely work out
as well as trusting Lady Luck at the casino to make payroll. It might work once or
twice, but in the long run the house always wins. In the data security business,
the house is fraught with chaos through accidents, worms, viruses, hackers,
angry employees, and disasters. That’s a lot of luck to rely on to keep your
business up and running.
Organization
Some people are naturally organized, and rarely lose a thing. Others are, well,
organizationally immune.

Searching through piles of photos at home to ﬁnd the one Aunt Bessie picture
where everyone’s smiling can take as long as you want. There’s no deadline or
time limit.
Searching through marketing images to ﬁnd the one scheduled for the
newspaper ad next week does have a deadline. Wasted time and lost images cost
you money, as anyone in advertising will tell you. (A healthy percentage of ads
are recreated because the originals disappear.) If you’re not on speaking terms
with neatness, a central ﬁle server will help limit your searches, and make it
easier for someone else to help organize items within folders for you.
Sharing
After organizing your data, sharing your data becomes much easier. Unless you
run a one-person company, company information must go to others.
Large companies spend millions on customer relationship management (CRM)
applications to track and keep customers. The key for all those big buck
applications? Shared information.
You can’t easily share the ﬁles on your computer, because peer-to-peer ﬁle
sharing breaks down as the demands for information or number of users grows.
Central ﬁle servers make sharing easier, and the included security options make
sharing safer, as well.
Peer-to-peer networking, long popularized by Macintosh systems and
Windows starting with Windows 3.11, shares resources between devices
without a centralized ﬁle storage location or security authentication con-
trols. This works reasonably well for three to four computers, but then
the need for security and organization strongly recommend moving to a
server of some type. It may be that one PC with a big hard disk acts as
the server for the other computers on the group by providing centralized
storage space and using its access sharing controls to force some level of
security. But a dedicated ﬁle server is almost always more secure, more
reliable, and more manageable.
Want to provide spreadsheets for quotes? Put them on a ﬁle server in read-only
mode, and no one will ever again overwrite your carefully constructed sheets.
Security
Computers people can touch aren’t secure. Servers can be set on a desk or shelf
anywhere and still do their job, because people don’t type on their keyboards or
watch their monitors (if they even have any). This fact makes it easier for
servers to stay hidden in locked rooms (with proper ventilation, of course).
Files on personal computers connected via basic peer-to-peer networking aren’t
particularly safe, either. Individual computers, especially PCs running Windows,
regularly catch viruses. Individual computer users regularly delete the wrong
ﬁles or overlay ﬁles by accident.

Chapter 10 ✦Server and Storage Options 213
Centralized storage adds security by keeping ﬁles farther away from bumbling
users, and the easy backup options on a server provide even more beneﬁts. You
can’t look at security as “stopping hackers” but as any and everything that can
damage data in any way.
All banks keep money in their teller cages, close to the people. But not too much
money. The big money stays in the vault, with extra layers of security.
Chapter 13 goes into quite a bit of depth on back-up devices, security,
and rationalizations. But let me say here that if you don’t back up your
ﬁles, you will lose some sooner or later. That’s a guarantee.
Capacity
Hard disk prices have dropped constantly over the past few years, and
centralized ﬁle repositories make the best use of big drives. Not only are the new
hard disks larger, they are faster.
One really, really big disk in a ﬁle server makes for faster ﬁle access times for
everyone. Two really big disks in a ﬁle server, writing ﬁles to both disks at once
(running RAID Level 0 fault tolerance), eliminate the worry of a disk failure
taking your company data (and your company) down the drain.
Tech Bits
RAID stands for Redundant Array of Independent Disks. There are mul-
tiple levels of RAID depending on how many disks are used to store the
data. The basic Level 0 fault tolerant application uses two disks in place of
one, so if one disk fails, all your data remains available on the second disk.
Choosing Your Server
So you ﬁnally agreed you need a server, right? Now you just need to ﬁnd the
server, or at least the type of server, that will do the best job for you.
The overlap between servers for home and servers for small businesses is quite
wide. Don’t limit your thinking to a “home” server based on case size or initial
price, or you may choose the wrong server for your job at hand.
Let me give you a quick rundown of server features, and explain how those
features may help your situation:
✦Cost: Low cost is attractive, but be sure and get enough server capacity
to handle your situation today and through the next year or so. A good
rule of thumb is to get twice as much storage as you think you need.
✦Performance: Home servers generally don’t need fast performance.
However, if you plan to stream videos to your home theater setup,
performance matters a great deal. Large ﬁle transfers need faster servers
and hard disks than relatively small digital photos and documents being
copied or viewed.

214 Part III ✦Moving from Stand Alone PCs to a Network
✦Upgradeability: All-in-one devices are rarely upgradeable. If you need to
buy small and upgrade, look toward a PC system with added software
rather than a server device.
✦Wireless support: Some servers allow client connections wirelessly.
Others can plug into the network via a patch cable and service wireless
clients who access the network through the wireless router. The result is
similar, but wires run faster than radio waves today and probably will at
least until new products appear in the year 2006 , so if performance is
critical look for wired support.
✦Accessible over the Internet: Some servers expect to be on the public
Internet and even run Web and e-mail services. Others are private servers
and don’t have the security feature set to protect them from hackers.
✦Application host: Some servers run applications, and some only provide
centralized ﬁle and print services. If you need applications to execute at
the server, such as databases for your business, make sure you choose a
system that supports applications.
Go through this list, and check which features are the most important for your
situation. Then I’ll help explain what type of server you need based on your
choices.

Get through those questions okay? Good. Now the bad news: every item checked
as “Very important” will cost more money. The more features, the more expense.
As features pile one on top of another, the meter keeps ticking and speeds up.
The next sections appear in decreasing order of complexity. If your checklist is
full of “Very important” checks, you should focus on server appliances. As the
number of Very important checks go down, the further down this list you can go
and still meet your needs. Or, at least the needs based on this checklist.
Now let me outline the different server types you should look at, depending on
what your checklist tells us.

216 Part III ✦Moving from Stand Alone PCs to a Network
All-in-one server appliances
Personally, I love all-in-one server appliances for small businesses and even
some home users. I’ve used several over the years in my home ofﬁce, and think
they do a pretty good job. This approval rating goes up even more now that
broadband service providers do a better job of supporting home and small
business networks.
The market doesn’t agree with me as well as I hoped about server appliances,
however, and many of the best ones over the years have disappeared. In fact, the
two best ones (the Cobalt Qube and the Netwinder Rebel) are gone. The good
news is that new products are approaching the quality of software from the
earlier systems, and the hardware is deﬁnitely better today.
Small companies tend to appear, make a great product, then disappear as they
run out of money trying to reach their market. Sometimes small good companies
are bought by larger ones and killed as when Sun bought the Cobalt Qube line as
part of the Cobalt rack server product line they wanted, ignored the Qube for
the rack servers, then discontinued all the Cobalt products.
Toshiba Magnia
Toshiba, long relatively unknown in the server arena (great laptops), now has
probably the best all-in-one server appliance out today, the Magnia. Check them
out in Figure 10-1.
Figure 10-1: Reigning all-in-one appliance champ, according to me.

Chapter 10 ✦Server and Storage Options 217
You can’t tell even with the zoomed-in picture, but the case is metal and feels
like a tank. The 16 × 2 LCD screen helps with status information during use and
particularly during installation.
The Toshiba Magnia includes several excellent features:
✦Wireless option with addition of PC card (extra $100 when ordered
through Toshiba even though this is the same type of PC card you plug
into a laptop).
✦No routing features, but it can be used for a ﬁrewall through a dedicated
Ethernet connection.
✦Dial-backup option with addition of PC card modem for second PC card
slot so the server can dialup your service provider if the cable/DSL
service stops.
✦Dual disk drives auto mirror of all data with scheduled disk-to-disk copy
much like RAID Level 0 for fault tolerance.
✦Number of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to remote sites limited only
by load on the system. Most large companies force users connecting from
home to use a secure and encrypted Virtual Private Network to link back
to the ofﬁce.
✦Outstanding internal-use portal with excellent templates for documents,
images, and photos makes it easy for small businesses or overly
organized home users to present information.
✦Provides all the network conﬁguration details, such as IP address,
for other devices on the network (Dynamic Host Conﬁguration
Protocol).
✦One-click method to download all e-mail from service provider and make
it available internally on the Magnia.
Overall quality of the administrative tools, reached via Web browser, outclass all
others on the market today. The clearly deﬁned screens contain logical features
based on their headings, and warn you when you’re drilling down into
something that can get complicated.
The Magnia 30 has a 1.2 GHz Intel Celeron processor, and the Magnia 25 has an
Intel Celeron running at 566 MHz. That appears to be about the only difference
between the two units.
One great advantage of the Toshiba software is the ability to send backup ﬁles
offsite to a remote File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server. You can also send them
anywhere else on the local network the Toshiba can access, but the offsite
option gains major points for Toshiba and their thoughtfulness.
Tech Bits
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a rock-solid method of putting ﬁles on a
remote server or getting ﬁles from a remote server. This protocol does
the undercover transfer work when you download ﬁles using your Web
browser.

218 Part III ✦Moving from Stand Alone PCs to a Network
Judging the high-end features, Magnia includes an e-mail server that collects
e-mail from the Internet and makes it available to your client computer but not a
public Web server. Backups can be done offsite, a huge plus for business users.
Not a complete 10, but pretty close.
Pricing (as I write this) ranges from pretty good to almost high. The Magnia 25
goes for $899 without the wireless option, and the Magnia 30 goes for $1499
without the wireless option. Add $100 to each price for the wireless card. This
puts the Toshiba pricing in a strongly competitive range for the features it
includes.
Procom Taurus
Some products and their companies disappear (like Rebel and their Netwinder),
some get eaten (as Sun gobbled and discontinued Cobalt) and some products
get a second chance after the company disappears.
The Procom Technology (www.procom.com) Taurus is an upgrade of an earlier
system by Celestix. Hard to miss the distinctive shape and the large LCD screen
that you can see in Figure 10-2.
Figure 10-2: Not a computerized toaster but an all-in-one server.
A complete Web and e-mail server suitable for Internet use, the Procom Taurus
also includes Wi-Fi support. In fact, the company calls it “wireless storage” as
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Chapter 10 ✦Server and Storage Options 219
much as an all-in-one server. If you want to create your own Web pages, and
make them available for the world of Internet users to see, the Procom Taurus
will support you. But I suggest using a Web hosting service until you feel
comfortable handling the security necessary to host a Web server and keep it
safe from hackers.
The biggest problem connecting new network devices in many cases is aligning
an existing computer or network with the new device’s IP address assigned at
the factory. You have to redo your computer, isolate any servers providing
addresses, and then plug in the new device. Then you must change the device
and, oh well, the whole process awaits in the Connecting Network Devices
section just ahead.
Procom’s Taurus skips that painful step, because the front LCD screen lets you
set the IP address before you plug the unit into your network. Major headache
relief, believe me.
When I tested this box, I set the IP address and then placed the Taurus in
between my cable modem and my lab network. In just a few seconds the unit
conﬁgured itself for the cable modem broadband connection and passed trafﬁc
from my PC out to the Internet.
Of course, equipment that becomes the primary ﬁrewall for a network should
offer some strong management screens, details, settings, and reports. Alas, the
Procom Taurus takes the “too simple” way out, giving too little information and
too few conﬁguration options.
The e-mail server offers only basic information, but the Web server seems more
capable. You can host multiple Web sites on the box, handy for small businesses
with multiple ventures. If you’re Alex of Alex’s Financial Planning and of Alex’s
CPA Services, you can have two separate Web sites on the same Procom Taurus
unit. But remember my concern about security when you host your own Web
server.
Pricing ranges from about $1,700 for an Intel Celeron 1.2 GHz processor, 512MB
RAM, and a 40GB hard drive to $2,350 for a unit with a 250GB disk. Only resellers
and a few online shops carry the unit, so you may have to look around.
Other choices
The EmergeCore IT-100 (www.emergecore.com) advertises itself as a complete
“IT Department in a box” but one must always be wary of brightly colored
advertising. Following much the same road as the Procom Taurus, the
EmergeCore IT-100 offers Web and e-mail servers, ﬁrewalls for placing the unit
between your network and the Internet, VPNs, and some rudimentary security
settings.
Lacking wireless support and coming with only 128MB of RAM and a 40GB disk,
the initial version of the EmergeCore doesn’t stack up well in the statistics
department. It does, however, transfer ﬁles faster than any server appliance I
ever tested.

220 Part III ✦Moving from Stand Alone PCs to a Network
Available through resellers at a listed price of $1,400, the EmergeCore IT-100
leans heavily on easy management (but incomplete) and some Web-creation
software for marketing traction. But in the hands of a good reseller to conﬁgure
it properly and integrate into a company network, it can be worth the money.
A new unit I have yet to test could be the killer product of the market segment, it
if lives up to the hype. Axentra Corporation (www.axentra.com) touts their new
H-25 Multifunction Server Appliance with the longest list of features in the
market, surpassing even the Toshiba Magnia.
Of course, seeing (and testing) is believing, but the Axentra makes the following
promises:
✦Broadband routing, content ﬁltering, and ﬁrewall security
✦Web server(s)
✦E-mail server with spam controls
✦Universal plug and play for easy installation
✦Wi-Fi wireless with 802.11g as well as 802.11b (with purchase of optional
USB wireless adapter)
✦Print server (parallel port and USB)
✦Web e-mail client, publishing, and address book
✦MySQL open-source database
✦Bonus Web designing software
All these features supposedly cram into a box about the size of a big book that
weighs less than 5 pounds. Great if they can make it work.
The best part: $499 retail, and already available just after release at one online
store for $450. Add the USB wireless adapter from the same online store and you
will still be in the $500 neighborhood. For an all-in-one server with these
features, that neighborhood is still very small and new.
Network-attached storage units
The term, Network Attached Storage (NAS) describes exactly what the units are.
They are stand-alone appliances that connect via Ethernet to a network and act
as a central ﬁle repository. They may sit by the router within a patch cable’s
reach, or you can use HomePlug connections and place them anywhere
See Chapter 14 for more on HomePlug devices.
There is a difference between a NAS and an all-in-one server like the Toshiba and
others in the previous section. The servers include more service applications,
such as Web and e-mail servers, than a NAS. The NAS clearly limits what it will
do: It will share storage on a network with approved users. A NAS trades
sophistication of applications for the brute force of buckets of disk space.

Chapter 10 ✦Server and Storage Options 221
Small NAS units today are 120GBs, and some vendors make NAS boxes with tera-
bytes of disk space. A bit overboard for homes and small businesses, but one can
never tell how many photos Aunt Bessie will snap. If it ranges into the hundreds
of gigabytes, there are affordable NAS boxes to support Aunt Bessie’s work.
It seems, at least for the low-end Small Ofﬁce Home Ofﬁce (SOHO) boxes, just
providing storage space isn’t enough. Many of the new NAS boxes also act as
cable/DSL routers. Another company adds a print server and removable disk
trays to add storage quickly and easily.
This market should thrill all buyers. Vendors are adding features and dropping
prices with each new product.
Kanguru iNAS-100
Yes, the spelling is correct. The Kanguru Solutions (www.kanguru.com)
company offers a wide range of external disk drives, readers, CD-ROM and DVD
writers, and other interesting products. The company recently delivered its ﬁrst
NAS and it made a strong impression when I reviewed it.
First, it’s pretty small. Figure 10-3 doesn’t show it in comparison to anything, but
the box is not much bigger than many of the cable modems in use today.
Second, look at the small LCD screen. Only 16 characters on two lines, but they
help, and they make some setups easier.

222 Part III ✦Moving from Stand Alone PCs to a Network
Third, the Kanguru is a full-ﬂedged cable/DSL broadband router, including
ﬁrewall protection and all the other bells and whistles. Every feature of routers
covered already in this book exists in the iNAS-100.
And unlike the other NAS devices, the Kanguru iNAS-100 makes it easy to access
ﬁles across the Internet. The only caveat is its relatively high price in the market
now, but prices have a way of drifting lower as competition increases. The 120GB
version has a street price of around $600, the 200GB version is around $750, and
the 250GB unit is around $850.
The feature of the Kanguru that puts it above the other NAS devices in this
chapter is its remote ﬁle access. Although not a modiﬁable Web server, the
Kanguru sports a Web interface for remote management and remote ﬁle access.
Remember the little LCD screen on the front? That shows the current IP address
assigned by your broadband service provider, especially handy on those
connections where the service provider reboots during the night and your IP
address changes. Put that IP address in your Web browser, connect to the
Kanguru, and drill down to ﬁles as shown in Figure 10-4.
Figure 10-4: The ﬁle access screen from the Kanguru (yes, the music ﬁles are legal).

Grabbing ﬁles remotely makes life much easier for those who travel, even if just
from home to ofﬁce. Other systems later in the book make this possible as well,
but each vendor adds its own ﬂavor, and the Kanguru offers one of the better
solutions.
Knowing that the target market is for less-technical home and small business,
Kanguru makes the initial setup and conﬁguration simple. Every vendor pays
lip service to that, but the iNAS-100 displays the Quick Conﬁguration screen
shown in Figure 10-5 the ﬁrst time the new owner connects to the administration
screen.
Figure 10-5: Step by step conﬁguration tools make installation less frustrating.
Tritton ASA1120 and brethren and cousin IOGear
One of the true low-cost leaders in this market, the Tritton Technologies
(www.trittonsales.com) company offers well-equipped NAS boxes for a retail
of $329. The street price? About $270 for the NAS120 with 120GBs of disk storage,
and the ASA1120 is $322 (street) with its excellent cable/DSL router, VPN, and
ﬁrewall.
The physical case and administration screens for the Tritton ASAP I reviewed
and the IOGear BOSS (the name comes from Broadband Ofﬁce Storage Server)
lead me to the unalterable conclusion the same manufacturer is making both
systems. I don’t know who makes the box for whom, but Tritton appeared ﬁrst
and has a wide range of products based on the same fundamental case and
Linux-based operating system.

Take a look at Figure 10-6 to see what I mean about the Tritton product lineup.
This doesn’t prove they make the box, but it strongly hints to me they are closer
to the manufacturing process than IOGear is.
Figure 10-6: A family of storage appliances packed with features.
The street price for the ASA2120 is about $360, and that model includes a public
Web server. There is a disclaimer about trying to make this a heavyweight
e-commerce server, but most Web sites use static pages full of brochure-ware
anyway, and this unit should be just ﬁne for that.
SnapAppliance SnapServers
Perhaps the originator of the SOHO NAS, the Snap company started, was bought,
and then later freed itself to be independent once again. It still has a huge market
share on the low end with SOHO buyers, but is expanding on the top end as well.
SnapAppliance makes one of the smartest moves in this market by including
client back-up software with the Workgroup product line. It also provides ways
to synchronize data between various SnapAppliances. Being one of the early
market entrants has given SnapAppliance a long history and plenty of time to
upgrade software.
Their Web browser administration shows the care and long development. The
range of client ﬁle systems supported, including Windows, Linux, Unix,
Macintosh, and NetWare clients adds to their versatility. Figure 10-7 shows the
SnapAppliance Network Settings information page.

Figure 10-7: Information overview pages help you monitor appliances.
The SnapAppliance 1100 travels easily, and they suggest you unplug it and put it
in your briefcase for easy transport. The company’s reputation helps it maintain
a substantial market share even through its prices are higher for pure NAS-only
devices. Street price for the SnapAppliance 1100 with an 80GB disk is around
$535, and the 160GB disk is around $780.
Linksys EFG80 and EFG120
One of the biggest names in home and small business wireless, HomePlug, and
router products, Linksys (www.Linksys.com) offers expandability and strong
administration to the NAS market. Now a division of Cisco Systems, Inc., the
friendly rounded shapes of products have been “corporatized” as you can see in
Figure 10-8.
The EFG80 on the right is a bit bigger than a shoe box. The EFG120 on the left is
about the size of a VCR, although one of the newer VCRs that isn’t as wide as
they used to be.
It’s tough to see in the small pictures, but both products place their disk drive in
a tray. You can remove the disk drive, or upgrade the disk to a larger one (the
120GB drive can bump up to 250GB, and the 80GB drive bumps up to 120GB).
Adding a second disk jumps the storage capacity, and you can replace the
original Disk 1 if you want to have as much as 500GB with the EFG120 unit when
fully expanded.

Figure 10-8: New look on the left, old look on the right.
Some of you are wondering how the Linksys operating system survives the
replacement of the primary disk that ships with the unit. Good question, and
that would be a problem, normally. But Linksys engineers built its operating
system into a ROM chip and placed that on the system motherboard. When the
unit gets power, the chip wakes and supplies the necessary information to the
disk drive(s) as they boot.
Linksys also includes a print server on its NAS boxes. There isn’t enough
administration and control over the print server, but it does come in handy at
times.
Are these the only NAS appliances? Absolutely not. But many of the others lean
toward the high end, far outside the budget of home and small business
customers. And it appears there will be more vendors, rather than fewer, as hard
drive prices drop and users realize the value of NAS appliances.
Turning an old computer into a server
What do you do with an old personal computer? You can always turn it into a
server for the rest of the computers on the network.
You might wonder if an old computer, too old to handle the applications you
need to run, can be useful as a ﬁle server. Absolutely. The reason you upgraded
your computer was because the demands of the operating system’s graphical
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 10 ✦Server and Storage Options 227
user interface grew too heavy. That, and the applications gained in size and
complexity and you got tired of waiting for screen updates.
I promise your ﬁle speed had nothing to do with changing your computer. Even a
fairly old computer can make a good ﬁle server. And with the prices of hard disks
dropping still, putting a 120GB disk into an old computer to turn it into a ﬁle
server will cost around a $100. Depending on the type of software you want, that
and a few minutes of conﬁguration time may be all you spend on the system.
Using Windows networking
All versions of Microsoft Windows since Windows 3.11 for Networks include the
ability to share resources with other computers on the network. It’s not great
networking, and it’s not particularly secure networking, but with the right
conﬁguration it will work pretty well.
One big advantage of making an extra computer the new centralized server is
that no one will be using the server machine for regular day-to-day work. When
you don’t ask Windows to do anything on a computer except share some ﬁles, its
reliability goes up considerably.
Windows XP Home and XP Professional make sharing ﬁles easier than ever. They
even provide a Shared Documents folder front and center whenever you open
My Computer. Figure 10-9 shows the Sharing Document Properties dialog box
open for the Shared Documents folder.

and Security or through Properties.

228 Part III ✦Moving from Stand Alone PCs to a Network
The explanations in the dialog box work well. Check the ﬁrst box, in the middle
of the dialog box, to share the Shared Documents folder. Microsoft does well to
tell you other users of that computer will see that folder, as will everyone using
Windows networking protocols on your network.
Notice the second check box under the Share name text box? Microsoft gives
you two options for ﬁle access: read-only, or read/write. That’s how computer
people put it, but Microsoft includes the nontechnical explanation. They don’t
do a good job explaining that the ﬁrst Share check box will only let people read
the ﬁles as supposed to make changes, but you can’t get everything when you
are dealing with software.
Similarly, shared printers attached to this computer will be seen by the network
users as well. This set up makes it easy to share a printer around the network by
hanging one off your old system.
Using Linux
Don’t think this Linux reference comes from left ﬁeld, because it doesn’t. Every
network appliance discussed earlier in this chapter uses some type of Linux
operating system. And why shouldn’t they? They get a great operating system,
well developed and well tested, for next to nothing when they follow one of the
license arrangements used by developers.
I can’t describe how to take a Linux distribution and turn an old PC into a ﬁle
server in the space I have here. There are many books on Linux and servers, but
you may not have to have any of them.
People just like you dig into Linux regularly and come away excited. New
distributions include more and more graphical administration tools, and most
jobs in Linux are now just as mouse-oriented as Windows.
Tech Bits
If you’re curious Linux and want help investigating the hottest operating
system in the past decade, you’re welcome to buy and read Red Hat
Linux 9 Bible by Christopher Negus. I did, and the included Red Hat
disks and other applications means you save money buying the book
rather than buying Red Hat directly.
One old PC with a Linux operating system can become your Web, e-mail, and ﬁle
server. Linux doesn’t lack for power, or Google wouldn’t use Linux on PCs to run
its giant search engines and Web sites.
If you don’t want to learn Linux yourself, check around the neighborhood. More
and more teenagers are getting into Linux. The old clich´e about asking the kid
next door to set up your computer is no longer farfetched.
Linux uses a program called SAMBA to implement the Microsoft Windows
networking protocols. After it is conﬁgured, you may never have to touch the
Linux server again, especially if you’re just sharing ﬁles. Even when running full
Web and e-mail services, you’ll ﬁnd that Linux systems stay up and running
longer than any Windows systems you’ve ever seen or even heard about.

Chapter 10 ✦Server and Storage Options 229
Setting Up Users and Disk Shares
Although the term “network administrator” may sound scary because of all the
syllables, modern server and storage appliances make user setup pretty easy.
Two or three steps are all you need to worry about.
Corporate networks include plenty of ﬁle and resource access options with
increasing granularity down to the point I can lock you out of an individual ﬁle
every Thursday from noon to 1:27 P.M. if I want. But homes and small businesses
don’t need that level of control (if anyone really does at all, anyway).
For each server or storage appliance, you need to perform the following steps:
✦Deﬁne the user (or let everyone access it)
✦Deﬁne whether the user can modify ﬁles or just read them
✦Include users in a group (optional)
As you can see in the ﬁrst bullet, you can deﬁne an appliance as open to
everyone, and everyone can use that ﬁle system. Technically, you allow guest
users to have full access. The users don’t even have to provide a name or
password because the device accepts everyone who makes a connection.
Security, obviously, comes from different angles. If you and your spouse have a
home ofﬁce together, locking each other out of folders won’t be part of the plan.
Some storage devices may be completely open for sharing whereas others on
the network are restricted to certain users. You have control.
Setting up users and groups
The Kanguru iNAS-100s administration screen provides a nice overview of all the
things you can do with users. Figure 10-10 shows the main user control screen
reached by clicking the user icon (funny little head) highlighted at the top of the
screenshot.
You probably won’t care about some items in the list, but they illustrate the
ﬂexibility and features of the iNAS-100. Notice the NFS Setting item? That
supports sharing ﬁle systems between Unix and Linux computers to make
remote ﬁle systems as available as local disks. Handy for some, but not many
SOHOs include peer-to-peer Unix networking.
The minimum you must provide for each user is a username (all one word with
no nonalphanumeric characters) and a password. Figure 10-11 shows the
Linksys NAS user setup screen.
You enter the following information for users:
✦Name: Use a short, one-word name that includes letters and numbers
only.

✦Comment: Not all systems have this, but it’s handy when you have more
users to manage.
✦Password: The best passwords have at least seven characters, including
numbers, letters, and symbols like $ or *.
✦Private folder: This option is not available on all systems, but gives each
user a private space on the storage or server device.
✦Disk quota: This option is not available on all systems, but it’s handy
when you manage a large group of users and some are digital packrats.
Group inclusion may happen during user creation or you may have to go to a
Groups screen to add users to groups. Relying on groups, especially as you get
more users, makes management faster and less error-prone. By using groups,
you can deﬁne the parameters for a group, such as Sales, and every time you
add a new salesperson you just plop the person into that group. All the rules and
settings you deﬁned for the group automatically apply to the new user in the
group, such as allowing them access to the Inventory folder but blocking them
from viewing ﬁles in the Payroll folder.
In Figure 10-12, you can see the Linksys screen that allows groups access to the
disk volumes.
Figure 10-12: Everyone doesn’t have access to everything, a typical arrangement.
The Group Access Rights dialog box that pops up when you click the Access
command button at the bottom of the screen shows that the group Everyone

does not have access to the Admin 1 volume. You can tell by the command
buttons between the two lists that groups can have access or not to disk shares,
or just read access, or read/write access (the RW Access command button).
Every setting you can make for a group you can make for an individual user. But as
your user list grows, taking advantage of groups of users with like access proﬁles
will save you time and prevent you from forgetting a setting for a new user.
Managing disks
Server and storage appliances don’t make a big fuss over disk volumes. You can
usually leave the entire disk as one big space and carve it up into multiple
network shares for organization.
Tech Bits
A volume is a logical storage unit that can be a portion of a single disk
or span multiple disks. A share is allowing access to a resource, which in
this case, is a folder on a disk.
Vendors handle multiple disk volumes in two ways. First, they can let you
allocate a certain amount of space for that volume, and keep track of that space.
When you reach the limit of that volume, you’re full.
Second, they can ignore the space used per volume, and let the disk space ﬁll up
as it gets used. If one volume had 80 percent of the allocated space and the other
one has only 20 percent, that’s ﬁne. System feedback, such as the free space
notation in a directory display, shows the total amount of space on the physical
volume.
Setting shares
Low-end NAS and server appliances have a single disk with a single volume. The
way to allocate disk space among users and groups is generally through the
network share.
Tech Bits
A share in Microsoft networking is a name given to a folder on a hard
disk allowing access to that folder and all subfolders. Users cannot move
up the ﬁle tree and see the parent folder of the shared folder.
Making a network share on a server or storage appliance looks much like making
it on a Windows computer:
✦Specify which folder to share
✦Provide a name for the share unique to that host
✦Tell the operating system to share it
✦Add any user restrictions
Figure 10-13 shows the New Network Share screen for the SnapAppliance 1100.

access or make special access arrangements on the next screen. Okay, it may be
slightly more complicated than on a Windows system, but not much.
Figure 10-13: Easy folder sharing for Windows networking.
Network shares are assigned under the Security page of the SnapAppliance.
After logging in as the Administrator, go to Security ➪Network Shares and click
the New command button for adding a network share. Other buttons let you
modify, change who can access them, or delete existing shares.
You can see the shares your Windows PC has connections to by going to
Network Neighborhood in Windows 9x or My Network Places in Windows XP.
Disk maintenance
Server and storage appliances include more disk maintenance tools than most
personal computer operating systems, but not so much as to be confusing. The
Linksys NAS boxes have the most disk maintenance information on one screen,
so that’s why the Disk Settings page from Linksys is in Figure 10-14.
The Linksys unit is the only one of the storage appliances that offers scheduled
disk maintenance. Notice the time settings for Scandisk and Defrag. The drop-
down box that says Never in Figure 10-14 offers a schedule to run either utility
every day, or any one day you choose.

Figure 10-14: Defrag is done, no reason to run a Scandisk now.
Connecting Network Devices
Every network device connects to the network slightly differently, but there are
more common conﬁguration steps than different steps. These are the common
steps:
1. Set an IP address or tell the system how to get one.
2. Name the device, if applicable.
3. Set the workgroup name for Windows networking.
4. Coordinate wireless channels, if applicable.
Four easy steps, right? If all goes well, the steps are easy, logical, and foolproof.
But in technology, as in real life, things don’t always go exactly right. So let me
show you a few examples of connecting appliances to your network and explain
where things may go awry.
Server and storage appliances
Adding a new server or storage appliance to your network requires a bit of
planning and several jumps through some networking hoops. The hoops are
caused by the vendors being forced to guess whether their appliance is the ﬁrst
server on the network, or you already have an appliance and theirs is an add-on.

Chapter 10 ✦Server and Storage Options 235
The details for Dynamic Host Conﬁguration Protocol (DHCP) are in Chapter 12,
but let me hit the high spots now. DHCP is a software server that runs on a
server of some type and allocates IP addresses to all devices on the network
when they ask for information. Systems that ask a DHCP server for an address
are called DHCP clients. Many server devices include this capability.
But vendors have no way of knowing whether you already have a DHCP server
on your network. If you do, they should (perhaps) set their box to be a DHCP
client. If you don’t, however, making the new device the DHCP server makes
much more sense, and eases network conﬁguration. Unfortunately, you must
make the decision before the system connects to the network.
So begins the installation dance. Commonly, the sequence looks like this:
1. Read the Quick Start Guide and see that the box doesn’t match your
network address scheme.
2. Connect this box and one client to a wiring hub.
3. Conﬁgure your PC (vendors almost always demand a PC) to be a DHCP
client.
4. Start the box; then start the PC.
5. Make connection from your PC to the new box and start the conﬁguration
process.
6. Set the IP address or the DHCP client or server settings depending on
your network.
7. Reboot the new appliance.
8. Reboot your PC to change the network address to match that of the
newly conﬁgured appliance.
9. Verify that the settings match your network.
10. Cross your ﬁngers and hook the new appliance and your PC to the
network and start all devices.
A bit disjointed, and certainly not a three-beat waltz, but that’s the dance.
Sometimes the dance is shorter.If the appliance reallyis the ﬁrst server-type object
on the network, the vendor’s conﬁguration may well work for you. In that case, you
keep the vendor’s IP address range and let the new appliance be the DHCP server.
If you already have a DHCP server, such as the router between your cable/DSL
modem and your internal network, you must conﬁgure the new appliance to
become a DHCP client. Or, you may want the new device to take over all the DHCP
server chores. Or, you may need to give your new appliance a speciﬁc IP address
that it will use all the time but not provide DHCP services to other network systems.
This does sound more complicated than it really is. Figure 10-15 shows the
Linksys NAS setup. In this case, the NAS has its own IP address, and will not
provide DHCP services.

236 Part III ✦Moving from Stand Alone PCs to a Network
Figure 10-15: Two steps of the connection dance are done.
Personally, I prefer giving all the servers their own IP addresses because it
makes it easier to connect to them to run their utility software. If you let a DHCP
server give them new addresses, it can be hard to ﬁnd them on the network.
Hard as in nearly impossible, but if you know their IP addresses you can put the
URLs in your bookmarks list.
There can be two or more DHCP servers on a network for fault tolerance and to
keep addresses available if one server goes down. The trick is to assign the IP
address ranges provided by the two servers so they do not overlap.
Now let me show you the Kanguru iNAS-100, which is the DHCP server for one of
the lab networks. Figure 10-16 shows the Kanguru screen that matches the
Linksys screen in the previous ﬁgure.
Notice the assigned IP address for the Kanguru NAS: 10.0.1.1. That’s the ﬁrst
address in the network because .0 is reserved and can’t be used. Many network
administrators put their routers at .1 for every network as a matter of policy, and
because it makes them easy to ﬁnd on the networks.
Yes, the Kanguru NAS is also the router and the gateway, one of its nice features.
It uses Network Address Translation (NAT) to hide the internal network IP
addresses from the outside. More on that trick in Chapter 12.

Chapter 10 ✦Server and Storage Options 237
Figure 10-16: The network DHCP server.
Routers
Network routers have to work in two directions: the internal network like the
one provided by the Kanguru router in the previous section, and the broadband
network provided by your broadband service provider. In very real terms, the
Internet comes all the way down to the cable/DSL modem and through to the
WAN plug on your router.
Let me show you router connections to a cable broadband provider, then to a
DSL broadband provider. The Kanguru NAS/router connects to the cable modem
provided by Comcast. This is interesting but easy, because Comcast provides
the information to the routers via DHCP. See how nicely the explanations
dovetail in this section?
The IP addresses shown in Figure 10-17 all come from Comcast. When the router
connects to the cable modem, it asks for network information (DHCP client). The
cable modem, under control of the head-end, assigns an IP address and other
details to the router.
I put in none of these IP addresses because they all came from Comcast. The top
entry, Specify MAC address, adds another layer of security by allowing only
preconﬁgured routers with a known MAC address (an internal number for the

Ethernet connection which can’t be changed) to connect to the network. A bit of
security overkill for a suburban cable modem connection, but useful in some
areas or corporate remote sites with increased security needs.
The picture looks a bit different on a DSL router connection. On the network
with the DSL modem to SBC Yahoo! DSL, the Linksys WRV54G wireless
broadband router must use Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE) which
requires a username and password.
Figure 10-18 shows the Linksys Internet setup screen. My username and
password go from the router to the DSL modem to the central ofﬁce for
veriﬁcation before I get connected. My setting says to stay connected all the
time, and as you can see at the bottom of Figure 10-18, this router also provides
DHCP service for the internal network.
DHCP and PPPoE are the two most common router connections used in the
United States. Both work reliably and reconnect quickly and automatically
whenever the service hiccups and resets the cable/DSL modem at your home or
ofﬁce. Because the internal network IP addresses remain separate from the
Internet IP addresses from the broadband service provider, those reconnects do
nothing to your computers and other network devices.
Wireless Webcam
Earlier I made reference to, and even showed a picture from, a wireless Webcam
from Linksys (Chapter 1). Let me show you how I hooked that up to the network.

Chapter 10 ✦Server and Storage Options 239
Figure 10-18: The DSL and Linksys version of the Kanguru and cable
information in the previous screenshot.
This chore required a typically complicated connection dance, because I had to
connect the Webcam over Ethernet to perform the initial system conﬁguration,
then make all the wireless links later. That’s why I said attaching some network
devices requires you to redo your network connections and IP addresses at least
twice in most cases.
Conﬁguring the Webcam itself wasn’t all that hard, because the Linksys software
searches for the intelligence in the camera and makes the link. Figure 10-19
shows the setup software and one of the primary installation screens for the
Webcam.
Remember I said you have to name almost all the devices you add to the
network? Here I provided the name for the Webcam. On the screen after this one
I clicked the Automatic Conﬁguration DHCP button to tell the camera to ask for
an address from the DHCP server.
Telling the camera to be a DHCP client takes care of the IP addressing issues, but
I still need to conﬁgure another setting to make the camera work wirelessly. The
Service Set Identiﬁer (SSID), essentially a name used in the header of data
packets going over a wireless network to help identify which network each
packet belongs to, must be provided.
Figure 10-20 shows the ﬁll-in value of the SSID. I used my daughter’s name
because she stole my wife’s laptop and uses it in the den while watching TV.
Because she’s the one using the wireless network most of the time, I ﬁgured
giving her naming rights was only fair.

Chapter 10 ✦Server and Storage Options 241
The SSID doesn’t provide any security protection, because the name goes over
the wireless network as plain text, but most vendors force you to have something
in the SSID ﬁeld. Anyone using minimal security-bypassing software can get this
information. Security details for wireless networks are coming up in Chapter 16.
After all the details are taken care of, the Webcam can capture images and send
them winging wirelessly around the house. Handy to keep pointed out the front
window when I’m expecting a FedEx delivery.
Server Security
After you include a server of some type in your home or small business network,
your security headaches go up. Placing all your critical ﬁles in one spot, one
advantage of a server, makes it more important to protect those ﬁles in that one
spot.
Physical security
As I mentioned, if someone can physically touch your computer, that computer
no longer has any security whatsoever. You may not be talking about state
secrets on your home server, but you don’t want the ﬁles stolen or destroyed.
If you have the ﬂexibility in your small business, take some of these simple
precautions to keep your server or storage appliances safe from accident:
✦Keep it away from crowded areas.
✦Lock it up, if possible.
✦Put it in an area with linoleum or wood ﬂoors rather than carpet to guard
against static.
✦Make sure employees know it is not available for any other use,
particularly when it’s an old computer transformed into a server.
Blocking hackers
Every computer visible to the Internet must repel hackers. The great value that
NAT support added to router functions is that they hide internal computers and
make them invisible on the Internet.
Not only does NAT keep your internal addresses blocked from those snooping
around on the Internet, the internal addresses suggested by vendors are
prohibited from Internet use at all. The following network addresses will not be
passed onto the Internet by any router:
✦10.x.x.x
✦172.16.x.x
✦192.168.x.x
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
242 Part III ✦Moving from Stand Alone PCs to a Network
That’s the reason vendors almost always assign one of these network addresses,
usually either the 10.x.x.x or 192.168.x.x to their equipment. The trend in
consumer and small business equipment seems to be to use the 192.168.x.x
network address, but equipment for large company use tends to be in the
10.x.x.x range. Neither address will ever be seen on the Internet, so no hacker
can try to focus in on your personal computer using an IP address of
192.168.1.23 inside your ﬁrewall with NAT enabled.
Look for much more about hackers and security in Chapters 12 and 16.
Backup planning
Too often people cross their ﬁngers and assume that because they have ﬁles
copied to a ﬁle server of some type, their backup duties are over. Sorry, but that
attitude will come crashing around your ears one day soon if that’s your only
backup plan.
Hard disks fail. Folders full of important ﬁles drop out of memory and get left on
a retired computer. Critical CDs full of valuable ﬁles get lost behind desks.
Adding a server or storage appliance just increases your need for a good
backup. Luckily, the centralized storage makes backup easier in many ways. But
you must include backup tools in your server or storage appliance budget.
Even if you use RAID Level 0 for fault tolerance to keep your data available if one
drive fails, you still need backups. Why? Because when you delete a ﬁle, it gets
deleted from both disks. That means if you delete the wrong ﬁle you will really
wish you had read Chapter 13.
Summary
Someday you will want a home server. Someday you will need a small business
server. This chapter explained many of the features and beneﬁts of a server or
storage appliance for home or business.
Using the servers and storage devices on my own lab networks, for examples, I
covered many of the installation and connection issues that beginning networks
face on a regular basis. Drilling a little deeper, I showed you several ways to
manage users on server or storage appliances.

ou need to know some things about desktop
networking that you don’t really want to know.
Sorry about that. I will try and slip in details now and
then during installations and explanations so it doesn’t
feel like protocol school.
If something doesn’t work immediately when you follow
the instructions in various chapters, you may have a
network issue. Issues concerning operating system
conﬁguration changes to support networking are
discussed in this chapter, and you can ﬁnd them based
on your client operating system. If the information here
doesn’t work, ﬂip over to Chapters 18 or 19 and keep
digging.
This chapter should be considered a reference chapter,
like a collection of frequently asked questions or an
encyclopedia. Sitting down to read this chapter like a
book, word after word after word, might be a bit dry.
Imagine home and small business networking like that
silly song we all sang as kids where the “knee bone’s
connected to the thigh bone” and you’ll get the most
important part. Your broadband provider delivers
broadband in the form of a connection on your
cable/DSL modem. You connect that to your router with
a short Ethernet patch cable (almost always). You
connect your computer to the router, with another
patch cable or radio waves with wireless networking.

244 Part III ✦Moving from Stand Alone PCs to a Network
You connect your server (if you have one) to your router as well, usually with a
wire of some type but sometimes wirelessly. Even when the devices don’t
physically touch via wires, they are connected. And that’s how a Web page
comes from the Internet to your screen, by crossing all the connections between
your service provider and your computer.
The physical part of the network follows the rules for Ethernet, which is a
shared-medium (one long cable electrically called a bus) network with collision
detection (when two computers “talk” at once, just like people interrupting each
other, they stop for a second) and collision avoidance (one person lets the other
person speak ﬁrst). These rules apply even when talking about wireless
networks, were there are no wires.
The software part of the network provides the organization. Network devices
can be both servers (they offer something to other network users) and clients
(they use resources from other network devices). Again, just like people, you
can have dedicated servers (those who always provide resources to others) and
takers who never share anything.
Here’s a quick list of the types of settings every network-attached device will
need, more or less. Servers won’t have Winipcfg is speciﬁc to Windows 9x/ME,
and wireless devices have another group of settings to handle:
✦Network adapter: An Ethernet adapter comes standard with all modern
personal computers. If your system doesn’t have one, you can attach a
network connector to the USB port, or connect a wireless network
adapter to the system.
✦IP address: Every connected device needs one. It can be set on the
device or provided by a server using Dynamic Host Control Protocol.
✦Workgroup or domain name: Small networks with only one or two
servers don’t need a fancy directory service to track each user, so I will
concentrate on workgroup computing. So every device must be
conﬁgured with the name of their workgroup to connect to the network.
✦Password: If you have a one-person network with no access from outside,
maybe you don’t need a password. If you have more than one person able
to reach your network resources, they need passwords. If your computer
can be seen across the network, it needs a password.
Inexpensive Routers with NAT Support
There is no one “cure all” security product you can buy today. However, an
inexpensive router with Network Address Translation (NAT) support will go a
long, long way toward making your computers inside your home or ofﬁce safer
from the social misﬁts called hackers roaming the Internet.
Some computer “explorers” complain that hackers are judged harshly
and called criminals when they are just curious. Sorry, but I don’t buy it.

If you want to see my ofﬁce but the door is closed, you can’t see it. Going
through the door without invitation is trespassing. In Texas, trespassers
are criminals. In some parts of Texas, trespassers are considered targets.
Chapter 12 goes into the technical details of Network Address Translation, how
it works, and how you set it up. But when you get a router from your broadband
service provider (or you buy it yourself), the default is usually for Network
Address Translation to be turned on, hiding your computers from the Internet. If
not, enable NAT immediately. Yes, NAT ASAP. You have to do very little, and it
provides excellent protection against many hacker attacks. The settings for
Network Address Translation are usually found in a security administration
screen, and are often part of the initial conﬁguration steps.
In effect, by using Network Address Translation, you can “hide” your computer
from the world. Not physically so your kids can’t download more viruses, but
hide it so it can’t be seen from the Internet. This technique should be the ﬁrst
step in every home or small business network.
The following manufacturers offer low-cost routers that sit between your
broadband provider’s cable/DSL modem and your computer(s). Even if you have
only one computer today, a router with NAT support will make your broadband
experience safer.
I have tested routers from the following companies and recommend them:
✦Linksys at www.linksys.com
✦Netgear at www.netgear.com
✦SMC at www.SMC.com
✦Siemens and their efﬁcient product line at www.efﬁcient.com
✦Buffalo Technologies at www.buffalotech.com
✦ZyXEL at www.zyxel.com
✦Netopia at www.netopia.com
These companies have received good reviews and also offer inexpensive routers:
✦Belkin at www.belkin.com
✦US Robotics at www.usrobotics.com
This list does not exhaust the market by any means. The technology for routers
with a minimum level of security protection, meaning NAT, is a long list. Any
product you ﬁnd from a reputable retailer, online or physical, will do a decent
job. And even a decent job provides much more protection than you’ll ever get
when connecting your computer directly to the cable/DSL modem and
bypassing a router. When you bypass the router, you give up an easy way to hide
your computer’s real IP address (NAT), address management to automatically
give IP addresses to devices, and usually a ﬁrewall which blocks all the software
addresses used by hackers to get into your local network.

Windows 9x/ME: Keep or Can?
Before you get to the information on making Windows 95/98 or ME work
correctly, stop and think a moment. Is upgrading the way you want to spend
your time?
Networking hardware and software improvements over the last several years
have been nothing short of amazing. Newer products include more features and
install and run better than older ones. Integrating older equipment into modern
networks takes time and sometimes more money than adding newer equipment.
Remember: the future of consumerism in America depends on people
like you and me replacing our old stuff with new stuff.
All that said, let me lay out some of the reasons you should upgrade your old
system, and some reasons you may not feel the upgrade is necessary. Every
operating system has strong points and weak points, and networked security
happens to be a particular weak point with Microsoft starting with Windows 95.
The details are many and technical, but let me just say that Microsoft developers
had little experience with the network protocol software they added to Windows
95, and they left some gaps in the security area.
Reasons to upgrade your Windows
9x/ME computer
New stuff is always more fun and exciting than old stuff, especially in technology.
So if that’s enough to justify upgrading your operating system or your entire
computer, great. Skip to the Conﬁguring Windows XP section and get to work.
If you (or the holder of the checkbook) require more reasons for upgrading, let
me and other experts lay a few reasons out for you. And to be fair, I will include
some reasons why you may not want to upgrade your operating system or
computer. Just be prepared to live with the consequences of your decision.
Why Microsoft says to upgrade
First, let me tell why Microsoft says you should upgrade your Windows 9x/ME
system. True, there is some bias on the part of Microsoft, which beneﬁts
ﬁnancially if you upgrade from Windows 9x/ME to Windows XP Home or XP
Professional. On the other hand, Microsoft knows reasons to upgrade that
others have yet to discover. This point becomes particularly potent when
discussing security.
One of the Microsoft Web pages provides several Top 10 lists for reasons to
upgrade. Let me present the reasons I believe make the most sense:
✦Less downtime: This is absolutely true. Windows XP Home and XP
Professional stay up longer and resist crashing far better than Windows
9x/ME and even Windows 2000. I say that from personal experience, and
other objective experts agree.
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 11 ✦What You Need to Know About Desktop Networking 247
✦Recovery Tools led by System Restore: This new feature gives you a
mulligan on all system changes. Try the change, and if it doesn’t work
out, you can roll back your operating system to the state it was in before
your changes. Just like a friendly golf partner, Windows XP makes it
possible for you to say, “I want to do that again,” and be able to do so.
✦Improved Internet security and networking: Microsoft includes an
Internet Connection Firewall as well as better default security
conﬁguration settings.
✦Wi-Fi wireless networking support: Microsoft calls it 802.1x, but that’s
primarily Wi-Fi and Windows XP includes support for Wi-Fi automatically.
It even works pretty well.
✦Updated peripheral support: Universal Serial Bus (USB) 2.0
speciﬁcations made it into Windows XP, and better support for FireWire
(especially from Sony computers) makes your Windows box almost as
media-connection friendly as a Macintosh. Not quite, but close.
✦Encrypting File System: Particularly critical for laptop owners, the
Encrypting File System (EFS) keeps your ﬁles safe in case your laptop
falls into the lap of someone that’s not you.
Microsoft lists other reasons to upgrade that I don’t necessarily agree are truly
progress in light of its safety record (remote access technologies). However, the
six reasons listed make a nice justiﬁcation in almost every situation.
What Microsoft doesn’t say on their Top 10 list is that TCP/IP conﬁguration for
Windows 9x/ME, the critical software for networking, wasn’t shipped to be
secure. In fact, networking security experts relate what I call gaps in security to
yawning chasms of operating system holes. But starting with Windows 2000,
network software security and ease of conﬁguration took a giant step forward.
If you plan to buy a new name-brand computer, you will be upgraded
automatically. All the major manufacturers still demand you get an operating
system from Microsoft for personal computers. The barrier is less certain for
some server products, which can include Linux, Unix, or NetWare as operating
system options, but that probably doesn’t apply in your situation. For
consumers and small business customers, a new personal computer means an
upgraded Microsoft Windows operating system. The only way out of the
Microsoft tax is to build your own computer, or buy from one of the auction sites
(www.ebay.com and www.ubid.com work best for me) and install your own
operating system after you get the computer.
The biggest hammer in the upgrade toolkit for Microsoft came out late in 2003:
no more support for Windows 98. Public outcry caused Microsoft to relent and
continue to offer support, but that support is no longer free.
Anti-Microsoft folks declared this a typical Microsoft plot to extort money from
poor helpless users still clinging to Windows 98. Other, more neutral observers
mentioned that no industry supports old products forever. Your new car comes
with a great warranty for the ﬁrst year at least, then fewer and fewer
components remain the responsibility of the manufacturer. Microsoft has done
www.it-ebooks.info

248 Part III ✦Moving from Stand Alone PCs to a Network
little more than phase out warranty support for an obsolete (by two newer
major operating system releases) operating system.
Bottom line: Upgrade your computer hardware and software for the most fun and
best possible computing experience with your new broadband Internet access.
Why others say to upgrade
I said several things in the previous paragraph, so you can count those as an
“others” argument. But I found the following additional reasons for upgrading
during my research.
Windows 98 is essentially only a pretty face on a DOS foundation. Critical system
components, such as memory space, are severely limited. Did you know every
running program in Windows 98 must ﬁght to register application details in an
address space on 64KB in size? That’s not MB or GB, that’s KB. When that
memory space gets full, you get error messages about lack of memory even
though you may have a gigabyte of RAM in your computer. That gigabyte doesn’t
increase that 64KB address space one nibble.
You get more for your money if you upgrade your operating system by
buying a new computer. Retail prices for Windows XP Home and XP
Professional software only range from $100 to $300 per computer. You
can get a pretty good brand name system for $400–$600, including the
operating system.
Windows 2000 and Windows XP do not rely on these DOS underpinnings and
that explains one of the best reasons why they are more reliable and run longer
before demanding a reboot.
Here’s a list of more upgrade justiﬁcations:
✦Newer application software will not run on older operating systems. This
chance of obsolescence increases with every new application released.
Particularly at risk are audio and video applications that take plenty of
computer horsepower to run.
✦USB 2.0 devices can’t be added unless you buy a special hardware card
and insert it into your computer.
✦More applications added to the system (not running, just installed) bloat
the registry and slow down the computer.
✦The hardware interface options for Windows 98 computers are Industrial
Standard Architecture (ISA), deﬁned by PC vendors in the very early
1980s. Expansion slots won’t support the newer Peripheral Component
Interconnect (PCI) cards almost all vendors sell today. I’m not sure you
can even buy an ISA expansion card manufactured this century.
✦Adding larger hard drives may be impossible because of Basic Input
Output System (BIOS) limitations in the older computers.

Chapter 11 ✦What You Need to Know About Desktop Networking 249
✦New memory for upgrades (to support a newer operating system on an
older PC) are harder to ﬁnd. Worse, BIOS restrictions affect total system
memory as well as hard disk sizes. Available memory will jump in price as
manufacturers concentrate on newer memory connection types not
supported by the older hardware.
Add my voice to this list. Upgrade if you can at all, in any way, justify the
expense and effort.
You don’t have to upgrade to Windows. You can buy Linux desktop op-
erating systems for as little as the cost of shipping on up to around $100
depending on included applications. You can get a pretty decent com-
puter, including a Linux operating system, for $200 that will take full
advantage of your new broadband Internet access as well as be the op-
erating system and application equivalent of Windows XP with Microsoft
Ofﬁce thrown in.
Reasons not to upgrade your Windows
9x/ME computer
If you want to avoid the expense or effort of upgrading, you may need some
justiﬁcations of your own. I’m nothing if not fair and balanced (okay, I’m biased
in some ways, but I try to warn you), so here’s the rest of the story.
Microsoft lists many reasons to upgrade that I don’t agree will beneﬁt most
readers of this book because of security issues. I don’t believe remote desktop
control over the Internet and ﬁle access control to your computer ﬁles really
make sense based on Microsoft’s poor security record guarding against
malicious intruders. Both these options leave open holes that expose at least a
portion of your computer to the Internet, and I feel there are better options for
both situations.
Microsoft also makes claims about performance that I don’t necessarily buy.
When Windows XP came out there was great confusion about whether
Microsoft’s performance-enhanced claims could be veriﬁed. New hardware
improvements make larger new operating systems seem faster than the replaced
software until you put the old software on exactly the same hardware as the
operating system.
I never saw a deﬁnitive answer concerning across-the-board desktop
performance increases I could trust. Some areas of the operating system ran
faster, but some did not. Call it at worst a draw, although upgrades in the
Windows XP (SP1) may have improved performance enough to make the claims
legitimate. Maybe.
The best and ﬁnal answer for your situation, and your choice to avoid the
expense and effort of upgrading, is that you like the way things are working now.
In sports, you don’t change your game when you’re winning. If you’re happy with
the applications on your computer and the function of that computer, you can
just stay where you are.

250 Part III ✦Moving from Stand Alone PCs to a Network
Most of the broadband connection options discussed in this book require an
Ethernet network connection. Windows 98 and even Windows 95 systems often
included Ethernet connection support on their motherboards, so you should
have one. If you don’t, you can get an Ethernet adapter, or use a USB connection.
Your choices are limited if you must use USB for your network connection, but
they are available. Assuming your PC has a USB port supported by the operating
system, of course.
You can always try something new to extend the life of your older PC
running Windows 98: Linux. A Linux desktop operating system will run
faster on older hardware than will a comparable Windows operating
system. You can get a Linux operating system, which usually includes
enough software to equal a full copy of Microsoft Ofﬁce as well as a
Windows XP-comparable operating system, for $30–$100 depending on
the vendor.
Conﬁguring Windows 95/98/ME
for Networking
Okay, you didn’t succumb to the lure of a new computer or even a new operating
system because you’re happy with what you have. That’s ﬁne. I will use Windows
98 for examples because that’s the operating system in largest use between the
three options I’m covering in this section. Some reports claim 25 percent of
home users are still on Windows 98, and millions of corporate computers also
lag behind.
The good news is that Windows 9x/ME operating systems are designed to be
user systems only and don’t include many server-type applications. That means
those server-type holes causing problems on other operating systems don’t
exist to be abused on a Windows 9x/ME system. The three ways to compromise
these systems are as follows:
✦Change conﬁguration remotely
✦Trick the user (you) into running a malicious program
✦Get physical access to the system
Of the three, I’m going to ignore the third option. Anyone hostile, who gets
physical access to your computer, will probably steal it. That means you’ll be
able to upgrade your system by replacing it with the insurance money, and you
can skip ahead to the Windows XP section.
Basic network settings
Windows does a pretty good job of setting up basic network access when you
install the software if there’s an active network connection during installation.
But those settings don’t take into account the modern aspects of broadband
access to the Internet and the climate of viruses and hackers today.

Chapter 11 ✦What You Need to Know About Desktop Networking 251
Password
You need a password on your computer when you attach it to the Internet. No
excuses. You need a password. Password creation is a science, not an art. You
want hackers to struggle enough to uncover your password they give up and go
to the next potential victim. All personal computer passwords can be broken
with enough time, but hackers tend to be impatient and won’t spend hours
attacking your system when the next one they hit may have a password of “no”
or something equally worthless.
Figure 11-1 shows the Password Properties and Change Password dialog boxes
in Windows 98 (Start ➪Control Panel ➪Passwords ➪Change Passwords). See
the asterisks in place of letters? That’s to hide the password from people looking
over your shoulder. Guess the developers who started that trend of using
asterisks never ﬁgured that if someone stood over your shoulder they could just
watch your ﬁngers when you typed your password.
Figure 11-1: Changing from a password from NO to something more secure.
If you’re the only one in the house or ofﬁce using the computer, you may not
want to use a password, and you can get away with that security breach. People
with coworkers or children tend to be a bit more paranoid.
Smart parents make themselves the only user with administrator privileges on
their computers and put good passwords in place. Many applications require a
user with administrator privileges to install them, which won’t be a problem if
you have only one user that accesses everything. Multiple user systems with
only one administrator require an extra step. When children need to install

252 Part III ✦Moving from Stand Alone PCs to a Network
software, the parent can perform the installation to help monitor the programs
and the installation success. Although some applications can be installed by any
user, viruses and worms tend to need more access to system services than just
user level security. So you have a chance to monitor installations and stop if
something insecure begins.
Network adapter
Your Windows 9x/ME system will need an Ethernet adapter supporting a
10Base-T plug. This plug looks like a telephone plug but is bigger because the
RJ-45 connector supports eight wires whereas the telephone’s RJ-11 connector
only supports four wires (four twisted pair versus two twisted pair).
Most computer vendors have put an Ethernet 10Base-T (unshielded twisted pair
wiring rather than the coax cables used before 10Base-T that look similar to the
wire the cable TV uses) connector on PCs for years. If your PC doesn’t have an
Ethernet connector, you can buy one (an Ethernet 10/100Base-T network
interface card can be purchased for less than a dozen dollars) and install it or
have it installed. But you’d be better off upgrading your computer to a system
new enough to include Ethernet support.
Some of the new cable/DSL modems include a USB connection so you don’t have
to use an Ethernet adapter in your old computer. But if your computer is so old
it doesn’t include a basic Ethernet connector, it probably doesn’t include a USB
connector, either. Another good reason to upgrade.
TCP/IP
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) became the only
protocol allowed on the Internet since January 1, 1983. Before that, the ﬂedgling
Internet included a wide variety of communication protocols developed by
different vendors. But TCP/IP won the protocol beauty contest, and has beaten
all other protocols, no matter their advantages in certain areas, as the reigning
network protocol.
Tech Bits
A protocol is a set of rules that communicates between machines.
Even protocols not called TCP/IP require TCP/IP, or some portion of TCP/IP, to
communicate. Although TCP/IP management details ﬁll many thick books, for
home and small business users the important thing to remember is that TCP/IP
is the networking software that does all the communications underneath your
applications. You see an e-mail client, but the Internet sees your TCP/IP address
and communication commands.
More details about TCP/IP await you in Chapter 12.
All you care about now is that every computer on a network (yours and the
service provider’s and the Internet) must have a unique number. This IP address
must be carefully controlled if used on the public Internet, but you have all sorts
of ﬂexibility with internal networks.

Chapter 11 ✦What You Need to Know About Desktop Networking 253
There are two ways for your computer to receive a TCP/IP address and therefore
the ability to connect to a network:
✦Assign the computer a speciﬁc IP address to use every time
✦Have the computer request an IP address and other network information
whenever the computer starts.
Both methods are conﬁgured on the same screen, as shown in Figure 11-2. You
reach this Properties dialog box by clicking Start ➪Settings ➪Control Panel and
then clicking Network ➪TCP/IP Physical Adaptor ➪Properties.
Figure 11-2: Notice in the foreground window on the right that there is no address
listed in the spaces.
Checking the Obtain An IP Address Automatically box tells your computer to ask
a Dynamic Host Conﬁguration Protocol (DHCP) server to supply a unique
address and other information. That server will probably be your router.
If your service providers tells you to put an IP address in that space and gives
you the address, it will look something like “24.30.107.139” with periods between
every group of three numbers. Yes, there’s space for three in every white text
box, so you have to press the Tab key to move to the next section if your address
has only one or two numerals in that space.
If your service provider tells you to put an IP address in that space, and it’s a
computer rather than a router, double-check that request. That means your
computer is attached directly to the Internet with no ﬁrewall or router in
between you and the global world of miscreant software developers.

254 Part III ✦Moving from Stand Alone PCs to a Network
The only time I specify an IP address in my local network is for servers that must
be managed via a Web-browser interface. If I let the DHCP server give them an
address I have a hard time ﬁnding the address of the server when I need to
conﬁgure or just check something on the server.
Winipcfg
Short for Windows IP Conﬁguration, this Windows 9x/ME program is hidden by
Microsoft for some odd reason. Must be scary for some users, but I think it really
helps novice and experienced users alike by showing all sorts of TCP/IP
information in one handy screen. When things work properly you won’t even
need to look at winipcfg.
You start the program by clicking Start ➪Run and typing winipcfg in the text
box that appears. Press Enter and the application will start by opening a small
box on the screen.
Two things you must do to make sense of this application. First, ﬁnd your
network Ethernet connector deﬁned in Windows for TCP/IP networking.
Software connectors, such as for AOL, tend to be placed in front of the hardware.
Scroll down to ﬁnd the Ethernet network connection you use for that computer.
You will only have one network adapter that is not software and labeled AOL and
the like, and that one will almost always say Ethernet of some type like the shot
in Figure 11-3.

Chapter 11 ✦What You Need to Know About Desktop Networking 255
In my case, this is a Linksys Fast Ethernet adapter I added manually to this
computer because it did not come with an Ethernet plug by default. Yes, if I used
this in a production setting it would be long gone by now. But it works well
enough to show a Windows 98 system when necessary.
Second, click the More Info command button at the bottom-right of the Winipcfg
application. This pops open considerably more TCP/IP network information and
makes it easier to see what’s happening, as you can see in Figure 11-3.
You can’t change anything directly through this screen, but you can reset the IP
address of your Ethernet card. Sometimes, such as when you change a server, or
a network connection freezes up in Windows, you must clear the old address
and get a new one.
Release your current IP address by clicking the Release or Release All command
button. The Release button just releases the network connector shown in the
Ethernet Adapter Information text box. Notice the down arrow at the right end of
that box tempting you to see what other adapters are running on your system. I
always click Release All so no odd connections that occurred in the background
stay open and cause me problems.
When you click the Release All command button, the address information you
saw in Figure 11-3 clears and you are left with a forlorn computer with no
network connection. Figure 11-4 shows a Windows 98 system with no
connections, after I clicked the Release All command button.

after releasing the connections.

256 Part III ✦Moving from Stand Alone PCs to a Network
Your computer will keep the Domain Name Service (DNS) server address even
after the connections are released, which is why you see 204.172.202.4 in that
space in Figure 11-4. The Node Type remains, as does the 16-byte Adapter
Address shown just under the double lines. The Adapter Address is the
hard-coded serial number of sorts given to every Ethernet adapter when it’s
built (called the Media Access Controller or MAC address). An international
numbering authority assigns the ﬁrst part of the number so it can track vendors,
and the vendors themselves keep track of the rest of the number as a way to
keep track of their own product sales.
Chapter 12 will go into detail about the 10.0.1.1 IP address listed twice in Figure
11-3, but that corresponds to the router (Default gateway) that also parcels out
the IP addresses (DHCP server). Those default gateway IP addresses will be the
same for every DHCP client on the network, because they all get that information
from the router acting as gateway and DHCP server.
Play with the winipcfg program if you want, and check out the details shown for
the other network adapters in the pull-down menu. You may be surprised by
what you see in some listings, but don’t let the details worry you, because the IP
address and details just described are all that matter when connecting to a
broadband service provider and the Internet.
Your workgroup
Microsoft offers two ways to connect personal computers to a network
(actually three, but one is ofﬁcially obsolete). Big companies use Active
Directory with server software dedicated to tracking and managing all
parts of all client computers. Small companies and homes use the
peer-to-peer networking (workgroup networking) Microsoft has provided for
years and years.
Workgroups consists of the computers and other resources (printers, storage
devices, servers) you are most likely to connect with while using your computer.
The connections between systems and resources make up the Local Area
Network (LAN) you read about. It matters not whether the connections are
wired, wireless, or even run over the A/C power in the walls of your house
because those are all ways to make up a network.
For workgroup identiﬁcation, each collection of resources must use the same
workgroup name. The default name for this in Windows 9x/ME is WORKGROUP,
a handy bit of redundancy. Yet Microsoft XP Home sets the default workgroup
name to MSHOME, which I ﬁnd inconsistent and egotistical on their part. If they
had to change the workgroup name to reﬂect a home network, couldn’t they
have used HomeNet or MyNet in place of MSNHOME?
The bottom line is that your workgroup consist of resources on the same
local area network all referencing the same workgroup name. Your home
links to share your broadband connection will be a small network. Your small
business may also use this method of networking, especially when adding
server or storage appliances. Remember in the previous chapter when I

Chapter 11 ✦What You Need to Know About Desktop Networking 257
mentioned all the storage and server appliances appear inside Network
Neighborhood (Windows 9x/ME) or My Network Places (Windows 2000 and XP)?
They appear because they guess correctly that the local workgroup name will be
workgroup.
Figure 11-5 shows the page where you set the computer name, workgroup name,
and computer description in Windows 9x/ME. You also set these details when
you install the operating system, but they are easy to change if you add
networking later.
Figure 11-5: Start ➪Settings ➪Control Panel ➪Network
➪Identiﬁcation to reach your network identiﬁcation page.
Tech Bits
Another reason to upgrade from Windows 9x/ME? Every time you change
any network parameter, you must reboot. Not true with Windows XP.
You can have more than one workgroup running on one local area network. The
workgroup name separates the resources from one network to the other.
However, there isn’t much reason to make this separation. If your network has
enough resources, such as in a small but growing business, moving up to a
better network operating system makes more sense than juggling multiple
workgroup networks.

258 Part III ✦Moving from Stand Alone PCs to a Network
Adjusting the default security options
If your broadband connection does not include ﬁrewall software on the router
between your computer(s) and the cable/DSL modem, prepare for plenty of
extra security conﬁguration work. If your computer(s) are Windows 9x/ME
systems, your workload just got heavier by as many Windows 9x/ME computers
as you have.
With Network Address Translation
Here’s the ﬁrst big security step and easiest way to protect your network: get a
router with Network Address Translation and ﬁrewall software. Use both, and
relax about hackers bursting into your network at all hours. You still have to
worry about spam and worms and viruses, but you need to read security and
e-mail control books to solve those problems.
There are no complicated examples in all the routers I have in the lab for
Network Address Translation. Engaging NAT rarely requires more than checking
box like you see in Figure 11-6.
Figure 11-6: NAT takes little effort to engage. See the check box?
The internal address range that your NAT service hides from the rest of the
world is the range set by your DHCP server. In the case of Figure 11-6, this is the
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Chapter 11 ✦What You Need to Know About Desktop Networking 259
IP address network 10.0.1.1. Clients requesting IP addresses will get those
addresses, on a ﬁrst come ﬁrst served basis, from the range 10.0.1.70.
Network Address Translation software tracks which clients send data packets to
the Internet. When the packets go through, the NAT software adds a port
number to the NATs IP address. When response packets return, the NAT software
knows which client sent the request because the response comes addressed to
that port number.
Outsiders looking to cause trouble can send queries to known port numbers, like
Port 80, which supports Web servers. Hackers like to ﬁnd Web servers because
so many of them aren’t well protected, especially those at smaller companies
with small security budgets.
But scanning a range of IP addresses on Port 80 won’t pass the NAT ﬁlter smell
test. Because no packets that left were tagged with Port 80 on the way out, no
return packets have permission to go through the ﬁlter using that port number.
Using Network Address Translation doesn’t solve every network security
problem, but it covers most attacks from the outside. It certainly protects you
from hackers scanning for easy targets, because the hackers can’t see any
computer on the far side (for them) of your NAT barrier.
Without Network Address Translation
Most people consider their ﬁles the most critical resource on their computer or
small network. If you don’t have a functioning Network Address Translation
barrier in place, turn off as many network shares as possible.
The easiest way to do this is to stop each Windows 9x/ME computer from
sharing ﬁles by turning off that switch for the complete computer. Figure 11-7
shows the small dialog box with the appropriate check boxes to stop sharing
any ﬁle from this particular computer.
Reach this dialog box by clicking Start ➪Settings ➪Control Panel ➪Network ➪
File and Print Sharing. Click the File and Print Sharing box and you’re in business.
The File and Print Sharing dialog box offers you two clever options: Share Files,
and/or Share Printers. One choice doesn’t affect the other, and few Internet
hackers are looking for printers to invade.
If you have no ﬁrewall and/or NAT barriers between your computer and the
Internet, you will be advertising your shared resources to the world. Remember
the discussion of early cable networks and the fact you could often see the
shared ﬁles and printers of your neighbors? The lack of ﬁrewall and NAT ﬁlters
allowed that to happen then, and it can allow that to happen today.
If you have no ﬁrewall and/or NAT barrier between your computer and the
Internet, turn off all resource sharing. Then look at the Inexpensive Routers
with NAT Support section earlier in this chapter and go buy a router immediately.

Figure 11-7: Disable ﬁle sharing by leaving these check boxes unchecked.
Closing exposed security holes
The only truly secure computer is one that is turned off, unplugged, and still in
the box. You don’t have that option, but you can close some security holes to
make your broadband life a bit safer.
I’d tell you to update the security ﬁles from Microsoft for Windows 9x/ME, but
because Microsoft declared Windows 98 obsolete, few, if any, changes are being
made to the source code. This means security patches and safety upgrades will
appear rarely if ever again. Yes, that’s a hint to upgrade.
Unbind TCP/IP
Windows 9x/ME doesn’t have any of the server software options that later
Windows operating systems include, but it does have a relatively poor
implementation of TCP/IP. Microsoft added TCP/IP support directly into
Windows in Windows 95, and Windows 98 still had some growing pains in the
TCP/IP area.
You don’t need TCP/IP to communicate between computers within your home or
small business. You do need TCP/IP to communicate with the Internet. But you
can turn off TCP/IP support for your local network, making it that much more
secure.
Figure 11-8 shows the page within TCP/IP properties to unbind (disconnect) the
TCP/IP protocol from the network interface card so that protocol won’t be used

as a client for Microsoft Networks. Uncheck both boxes, and you’ll make your
Windows 9x/ME safer from outsiders.
Notice the description in the Network dialog box to the left of the TCP/IP
Properties dialog box? The description, as shown in Figure 11-8, reads, “TCP/IP
is the protocol you use to connect to the Internet and wide-area networks.” Does
that mention local shared folders? No it does not. Reach this dialog box by
clicking Start ➪Settings ➪Control Panel ➪Network Interface Card Properties,
and then click the Bindings tab.
Repeat this process for every interface connection that reaches the Internet,
including any AOL adapters in the Network ➪Conﬁguration list of installed
network components. Because this is Windows 9x/ME, you will have to reboot to
make the changes stick.
Turn off ﬁle sharing
When you’re ready to share ﬁles, get a server or storage appliance like the ones
discussed in Chapter 10. Then put the appliance on your private network on the
inside of a router. If you’re not ready to do that, at least turn off ﬁle sharing on
your Window 9x/ME computer.
Refer to Figure 11-7. Notice the two check boxes? Make sure the top one, “I want
to be able to give others access to my ﬁles” is cleared. You can share your
printer with the world, if you want. It’s your paper.

Setting passwords for ﬁle sharing
Because you don’t want to turn off ﬁle sharing, or really can’t, let me show you
how to set passwords to keep those resources at least slightly safer. Figure 11-9
shows the screen where you set passwords for an individual shared resource.
You must conﬁgure passwords for each and every shared ﬁle resource. Get to
this screen by right-clicking the folder to share then choose Sharing.
Figure 11-9: Pick the way you want to share this folder.
Figure 11-9 shows the Properties page for My Documents, but it could just as
easily show any other folder you wish to share. You can drill down to the folder
to be shared, or share an entire disk drive if you want. When you ﬁnd the folder
(or disk) to share, right-click the item to open the context menu. Sharing is about
halfway down the list.
Give a better name than “My Documents” to the share in the example to
distinguish it from the My Documents folders all Windows operating systems
include. Comments are optional.
Notice under Access Type you have three choices: Read-Only, Full, and Depends
on Password. This selection makes pretty good sense. If you grant users
read-only access, they can view and copy your ﬁles in the folder but can’t mess
them up. Full access, or read/write access, allows all those with the password to
fold, spindle, and mutilate your ﬁles to their heart’s content.
Use real passwords, not just quick and dirty passwords.

Tighten Internet Explorer
The world of Web sites became a mineﬁeld over the last two years. Clever
hackers started running applications within visiting Web browser software to
infect the computer. Yes, now even looking at a Web site can cause problems.
And unfortunately, a NAT layer won’t help.
Hackers use ActiveX components or Java applets to attack your browser. You
can turn off these internal settings to block their use or at least prompt you to
allow ActiveX or a Java script on a site you trust. Figure 11-10 shows the Settings
page. On the Internet Explorer menu, choose Tools ➪Internet Options ➪

You want to set the following to either Disable or Prompt (scroll down to ﬁnd
them all):
✦Script ActiveX controls marked safe for scripting

how, you get asked to open the soft underbelly of your computer to the rabid
dogs of the Internet.
You do have choices in Web browsers, even for Windows 9x/ME. Netscape, for
instance, makes a better browser in many ways than Microsoft does. You can get
Netscape, and its brother Mozilla, free from www.netscape.com and
www.Mozilla.org, respectively.
Conﬁguring Windows 2000
for Networking
If you have Windows 2000, I won’t pressure you to upgrade at all. You get the
advantages of better reliability from Windows NT (not DOS with a graphical
interface like Windows 9x/ME) with graphical improvements over Windows 98
Special Edition. And you don’t have to reboot nearly as often.
Security with Windows 2000 improved over Windows 9x/ME, but you must still
be careful. If you completely separate your internal network (or even one
computer) from the broadband service provider’s network with a router or
gateway, you have done the best thing to protect yourself against malicious
outsiders.
Privacy advocates feel that Windows XP goes too far in collecting PC in-
formation and relaying that information back to Microsoft. Microsoft says
the data helps support product troubleshooting and future development,
but once someone else has your data you have no control over that data.
The technology exists within Windows XP to track an enormous amount
of Internet-derived tracking and transaction data and name the individ-
ual sitting at that computer. That makes privacy advocates nervous, and
they stick with Windows 2000, Linux, or Macintosh systems.
Unlike Windows 9x/ME, Windows 2000 does include server-type programs used
on a regular basis. Big in the corporate world, Windows 2000 Professional makes
remote desktop management easier than Windows 98 but not as easy as
Windows XP (see the progression?). So there are more things to worry about
concerning remote access, but more tools to handle and monitor the situation.
If you don’t have a router with minimum security controls, such as Network
Address Translation, jump back to the beginning of this chapter and read why
you must have one. Life on the broadband Internet will be much safer and more
secure with a router between your computer(s) and the cable/DSL modem.
Basic network settings
Settings for every network device include many of the same conﬁguration
details. The good news about Windows 2000 is that there are fewer than with
Windows 9x/ME, but they must be applied to every Windows 2000 system on

Chapter 11 ✦What You Need to Know About Desktop Networking 265
your network. So get ready to adjust some security options Microsoft leaves too
open for safety and shut the door on some hackers, such as:
✦Turn off services offering access to the system.
✦Disable Internet sharing through the Windows 2000 system.
The look of network conﬁguration screens in Windows 2000 echoes those of
Windows 9x/ME. One advantage is that you can reach the networking
components with one less mouse click. Windows 2000 adds a link to network
connections to the Settings submenu off the Start menu. But to complicate
things, Microsoft moved the advanced functions away from the Local Area
Network Properties page to the Advanced menu choice on the Network and
Dialup Connections window.
At least the primary page where you set the PC to ask for an IP address (DHCP
client) from a network server stayed put. Figure 11-11 shows how to tell your PC
to become a DHCP client. Reach this screen by clicking Start ➪Settings ➪
Network and Dialup Connections ➪Local Area Network ➪Properties ➪Internet
Protocol (TCP/IP) ➪Properties.
Figure 11-11: Setting Windows 2000 to request an IP address from a Dynamic Host
Control Protocol server on the local network.
Your Dynamic Host Conﬁguration Protocol server (usually your router) will
provide the gateway IP address along with the Domain Name Server
addresses. Setting those at your DHCP server makes it easier to change or
update that information, because every computer queries the DCHP server for

266 Part III ✦Moving from Stand Alone PCs to a Network
that information each time it is logged in to the network or has to release its IP
address.
Computer Name and workgroup/domain settings are part of the Windows 2000
installation routines, but you can make changes. Microsoft actually made the
change screen slightly easier to ﬁnd and slightly more helpful.
Figure 11-12 shows the Identiﬁcation Changes that may be necessary if you want
your newly networked computer to see other systems on your local area
network. The computer name must be unique within your network, and the
Workgroup name must be the same as all other computers in your workgroup or
you won’t be able to see them as easily. Reach this screen by clicking Start ➪
Settings ➪Network and Dialup Connections ➪Local Area Network ➪Advanced
(top menu) ➪Network Identiﬁcation ➪Properties.
Figure 11-12: Giving a Windows 2000 computer a unique workgroup name.
The default name for the workgroup is Workgroup, which makes it easy when
conﬁguring multiple new computers. This also means that everyone knows the
default name is Workgroup and anyone looking for openings in your network will
try the Workgroup name ﬁrst of all.
Adjusting the default security options
If you don’t need to share the folders on this PC, don’t do so. Shared folders are
an invitation to others to see what’s inside them.

Chapter 11 ✦What You Need to Know About Desktop Networking 267
The default setting for Windows 2000 is to add TCP/IP for all connections even if
that isn’t necessary. If you have no router with ﬁrewall and NAT protection, you
should unbind the Internet protocol, TCP/IP, from your local ﬁle and disk sharing
protocol.
Figure 11-13 shows the disconnection of TCP/IP from local ﬁle and print sharing
to keep your internal network out of harm’s way. Notice the arrow pointing
toward the Client for Microsoft Networks setting, which must not be cleared.
Find this dialog box by clicking Start ➪Settings ➪Network and Dialup
Connections ➪Local Area Network ➪Advanced (top menu) ➪Advanced
Settings ➪Adapters and Bindings.
Figure 11-13: This Windows 2000 dialog box looks
different from the similar one in Windows 9x/ME, but the
results are the same when conﬁgured.
Again, this step isn’t necessary with a router between you and the broadband
world. But if your broadband service provider gives you an IP address that
belongs only to you, you’re hanging directly from their Internet connection and
everyone on the Internet can see your computer.
Services to disable
Windows 2000 starts many services you may not need. Turning them off saves
time booting and leaves more memory for applications you do want. Even if
you don’t have a security need, turning off services you don’t need makes good
sense.

268 Part III ✦Moving from Stand Alone PCs to a Network
My concern now is with those programs that provide some type of host
environment for others. Windows 9x/ME didn’t have this issue to deal with, but
Windows 2000 and XP are powerful enough to act as servers in some capacities
as well as clients.
Turn these services off, one by one, checking machine stability after each
operation Figure 11-14 shows the Services control page. This dialog box is
reached in several ways, but the most direct is Start ➪Setting ➪Control Panel ➪
Administrative Tools ➪Services.
Figure 11-14: There are more services here than you probably imagined, and many
are not necessary for normal computing.
All the services remain on the system and are ready to go even if you stop them.
In fact, you must change them to Manual rather than the Automatic startup
command so they don’t restart when you reboot
The Messenger service highlighted in Figure 11-14 should deﬁnitely be stopped.
That’s what sends pop-up messages to your desktop.
Notice I put the cursor on the Stop Service button, which you can see in the
middle of the screenshot at the top. You can also right-click service names and
stop them that way.
Try stopping these services to improve network security:
✦IP SEC Policy Agent: An improved IP security driver that doesn’t help if
you’re not in a network domain. Provides no value to workgroup clients.
✦Messenger: Bringer of dreaded Alerter service messages co-opted by
spammers and popups.
✦Net Logon: Passes through user name authentication for logon services
in a domain. No help for workgroup clients.

Chapter 11 ✦What You Need to Know About Desktop Networking 269
✦Performance Logs and Alerts: Gathers local and remote computer
performance data then writes data to a log or alerts an administrator.
✦Remote Desktop Help Session Manager: Controls Remote Assistance,
where a remote user takes over your computer just as if they were at the
keyboard physically rather than across the Internet.
✦Remote Registry: Allows remote users (and management tools) to
modify Registry settings.
✦Routing and Remote Access: Allows dial-in access.
✦TCP/IP NetBIOS Helper: Resolves NetBIOS names and runs NetBIOS
packets on top of TCP/IP data packets.
✦Telnet: Remote user login application allowing programs to be executed
remotely. The default is to start manually, but be sure and check that
setting.
✦Universal Plug and Play Device Host: Universal Plug and Play (UPnP)
allows machines to communicate and conﬁgure access to each other
without involved humans. Not a safe or smart plan, and a regular hacker
target.
Try stopping these services to improve general performance:
✦Network DDE: Dynamic Data Exchange providing network transport and
security for enterprise-type application. Again, rarely used in a
workgroup setting.
✦NT LM Security Support Provider: Security for Remote Procedure Call
(RPC) programs that don’t use named pipes. Sound like a workgroup
application?
✦SSDP Discovery Service: Sniffs out UPnP devices on the network.
None of these suggestions are anything more than suggestions. You should ﬁnd
your level of comfort and act accordingly. However, if you don’t have a router
with the proper protection in place, I suggest you stop more of the services than
you allow.
Figure 11-15 shows the Properties page that appears on each service when you
double-click them. The Startup type listing, pulled open for display, shows that
the Messenger default is to start automatically whenever the system boots. Your
choices are to make it a manual startup process or to disable the service so it
can’t run even if some user or applications really wants it to run. Click Start ➪
Settings ➪Control Panel ➪Administrative Tools ➪Services. Then right-click the
service and choose Properties.
Internet Connection Sharing (ICS)
This feature was a big deal early on, as Internet service providers could use it
to help users get more than one computer connected to its service. And when
routers with ﬁrewalls and Network Address Translation were hard to ﬁnd or
expensive, using one Windows computer as a gateway to the Internet made
sense. Kind of.

Figure 11-15: I say set the services you don’t want to Manual settings. That makes
it easy for start them if realize later you really need them.
Okay, this didn’t make sense because of the security problems Microsoft had in
the past and continues to have. Trusting one computer to stay safe when
directed to the Internet through your broadband service providers is a stretch.
Trusting that one computer to keep the rest of your network safe from hackers,
viruses, and worms is a lot to ask.
Routers are too cheap today to run the risks of putting one computer directly
on the Internet and linking the rest of your computers to that computer. Buy one
of the low-priced routers with a decent NAT module and you’ll be far better off in
the areas of performance and security
Closing exposed security holes
If you read part of the Windows 9x/ME section, you know the security holes are
greater there than in more recent Windows operating systems. Yet there are
some security issues that will never leave.
Having a working router with Network Address Translation at the least and
full-ﬂedged ﬁrewall, at the best, closes the security holes in Windows 2000. The
holes I will help you close are holes everyone has to some degree.
First off, you can turn off sharing for your hard disk. Go to My Computer,
right-click your hard disk, and choose Sharing. It looks much like Figure 11-9, but
click the Do Not Share This Folder radio button, and your shared folders on that
hard disk will no longer be shareable.
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 11 ✦What You Need to Know About Desktop Networking 271
If you want to go deeper, you can. In Windows 2000, ﬁle sharing for the entire
system is controlled by the Server component inside the Services listing. Change
that service to start manually rather than automatically. You can’t see Server in
the list of services in Figure 11-5, but it’s there. Double-click that listing and turn
the Server off and you close most of your security holes.
If you’re nervous about turning off a service that “Provides RPC support and ﬁle,
print, and named pipes sharing” you can go to all resources around the home or
ofﬁce and see if anyone took the “Sharing” bait by seeing if your computer ﬁle
folders appears in their My Network Places folder. Someone probably did,
because Windows makes sharing the default, and the option to share any
resource appears in the context menu that pops open whenever you right-click a
sharable resource like a folder. Because this is peer-to-peer networking, without
a centralized network operating system controlling access to network resources,
you have to check each computer. Or, you can just stop the Server service and
see who complains.
If you ﬁnd an active share in a place you didn’t expect, close it up. Then look
around carefully, because the person who made that share probably made more
than one. If that’s the case, stopping the “Server” service may be your best
option. People tend to take the same actions time after time, so a “sharing”
person yesterday will likely be a “sharing” person tomorrow.
Conﬁguring Windows XP
for Networking
Windows XP became the “ofﬁcial” Windows when released in 2001. Microsoft
wants everyone to move to the new operating system, of course, and all new PCs
come with Windows XP of one ﬂavor or another.
Windows XP Home looks and feels exactly like Windows XP Professional. The
primary differences between the two products are enterprise networking
support for domains, Active Directory, and remote manageability. Home and
small business users have no reason to pay extra for the Windows XP
Professional version.
Just like with Windows 2000, there are a few details to clean up in Windows XP
for added security. You will turn off unneeded services to increase security and
decrease the load on your computer, and close a few other network security
gaps.
Why You Should Upgrade to Windows XP
Visually oriented people want to upgrade because Windows XP looks so much
more ﬁnished and sleek than Windows 2000 or Windows 9x/ME. That is, of course,

Continued
if those visually oriented people didn’t already buy a Macintosh, because that
visual interface sets the bar that Microsoft Windows seems to always reach for but
just miss.
The majority of the reasons I feel you should upgrade to Windows XP are listed at
the top of the chapter. Quick recap: more stable, System Restore, Wi-Fi support,
and better peripheral support with USB 2.0. There are a few other reasons, now
that you understand more of the reasons for some of the changes we’ve been
making to earlier Windows versions:
✦Sharing is not the default for all network resources
✦New personal ﬁrewall included
✦More controls for TCP/IP networking management
✦More resistant to system damage due to failures such as power outages
And, like I said, it looks nicer.
Basic network settings
If you have an active Ethernet connection on the PC when you install Windows
XP of either ﬂavor, the system will accept any network conﬁguration it can ﬁnd.
It may not do it completely right, but you will get a good start.
Figure 11-16 shows the Network Connection Status box. You can disable your
network connection here with the Disable command button, and then click the
Local Area Connection icon to enable the connection. This process resets the
network interface card and reinitializes most of the networking software in your
PC. Reach this dialog box by going through My Network Places ➪View Network
Connections ➪Local Area Connection ➪Status.
Notice something interesting in that listing? The last line in the Connection area
at the top of the window says “Signal Strength.” That’s one of the improvements
in Windows XP to support wireless networking.
One more click to drill down to more information that’s useful on a regular basis.
Click the Support tab in the Local Area Connection Status window to pull open
the Detail windows shown in Figure 11-17.
These two interesting windows provide more information than you got from
Windows 2000. The window on the left, the Local Area Connection Status
window, is the ﬁrst drill-down from the previous screenshot. This appears when
you click the Support tab at the top of that window.
The Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) information echoes the information received
from the DHCP server allocating IP addresses on the network. The Address Type
listing tells us this: Assigned by DHCP. This means the DHCP server on your

network did its job, and your PC client software requesting an IP address and
other information did its job as well.
IP Address tells us the IP address is allocated by the DHCP server. I’ll show you
more details about DHCP servers in the next chapter. But the IP address,
10.0.1.70, ﬁts within the range I set. The Default Gateway, 10.0.1.1, is the router
for this network.
Curious about the Details command button? That pops open the Network
Connection Details window on the right side of Figure 11-17. This echoes some
information from the window to its left but adds more.
Let me save the details for Chapter 12, but the nice lesson for this section is that
Windows XP does provide more network information than previous versions.
When you start worrying about changing your network or troubleshooting, the
more details you can get, the better.
The conﬁguration screen to tell your computer whether to be a DHCP client and
to specify some of these other details looks similar in Windows XP as in earlier
versions. Figure 11-18 shows the window, which should look familiar. Get there
through Start ➪My Network Places ➪View Network Connections ➪Local Area
Connection ➪Properties.
Figure 11-18: Telling your Windows XP system to ask for an available IP address.

dressed up in Windows XP style. I opened the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)
Properties window when I highlighted the last entry in the list in the background
window and clicked the Properties command button.
All you need do to become a DHCP client is to check the Obtain An IP Address
Automatically radio button. Your network will have a DHCP server because your
router (you have gotten the router, right?) will almost certainly include a DHCP
server module along with the Network Address Translation function that’s so
important.
You don’t specify the IP address of the DHCP server because you can change the
server, and have multiple servers if you want. Clients do the electronic
equivalent of standing on a street corner and yell, “Can someone tell me who I
am, where I am, and how to get out of here?” The DHCP servers respond by
providing an available IP address, other network information, and the IP address
of the default gateway.
Chapter 12 includes all types of details on getting to this point if your
Windows XP system has not yet been set up for networking. But if your
computer’s included Ethernet plug works as it should, all you need to
know to network your Windows XP computer is in Figure 11-18. But
you’ll still need to check out Chapter 12 to learn to conﬁgure the DHCP
server.
Adjusting the default security options
A new setting for Internet security appeared with Windows XP Home and
Professional: a personal ﬁrewall. They call it Internet Connection Firewall, and
you can see it in Figure 11-19. Reach this by clicking My Network Places ➪Local
Area Connection ➪Properties ➪Advanced Tab.
This screen looks simple and provides extra protection not afforded by
Microsoft operating systems before. And it’s easy to conﬁgure: check the box
and click OK, and you have more protection after than before. So check the box
and relax a bit more. But don’t turn this on if:
✦You have a third party ﬁrewall such as Norton, Symantec, or Zone Alarm.
✦Your router includes a good ﬁrewall.
More details about the Internet Connection Firewall settings are in Chap-
ter 12.
The second largest security hole, standard folder sharing, opens your computer
up to all sorts of investigations and possible attack and has been closed by
default. That’s a nice improvement from Microsoft, although long delayed.
File sharing should be turned off unless you are using your Windows XP as a
server of sorts. Using the newest computer, which probably includes the
largest hard disk, makes sense to conﬁgure as the server for many people. If so,

276 Part III ✦Moving from Stand Alone PCs to a Network
Figure 11-19: Turn on your Internet Connection
Firewall if you have no network router with ﬁrewall
capabilities.
don’t worry about the ﬁle sharing as long as your router has Network Address
Translation running. Right-click any folder if you’re curious, and choose the
Sharing context menu option to see if the resource has been offered to the
world.
You should also consider making the oldest and least exciting computer the
server rather than the newest. Heavy ﬁle activity slows the server. If it’s an older
system no one is using, no one cares. If it’s your system and someone’s dragging
your performance down, you care quite a bit.
This option keeps your Windows XP system one step farther away from hackers,
because you won’t share any ﬁles or folders directly from your system. You can
still get attacked and have some trouble, but your primary machine, not being a
server, wouldn’t be the primary target.
Closing exposed security holes
About the only other critical security option to address are the open services
that support remote connections to your Windows XP computer. Like Windows
2000, Windows XP offers quite a few services to other computers (and people)
on the network.

You should close services immediately if you have no router (then go get a
router). If you have a router, feel free to close the services anyway to speed up

should be using.
The ﬁrst option to check is your Universal Plug and Play settings. This feature,
handy for Microsoft-only networks, opens the door to many remote exploits
controlling devices with poor security.
Services look pretty much the same in Windows XP as in Windows 2000, as you
can see in Figure 11-20. You do have to go through a slightly different route to get
there, and interpret the new look of Windows XP a bit. Reach this screen via
Start ➪Control Panel ➪Administrative Tools ➪Services.
Figure 11-20: The look should be familiar, but there are a few new services running
in Windows XP.
UPnP in my system is off. Yours should be off as well.
The rest of the remote service options listed in the Windows 2000 section apply
to Windows XP as well. There are a few other services you may think of turning
off, depending on your network:
✦Terminal Services: Support remote connections from other PCs to your
system.
✦WAN Miniport ATW Service: Added by AOL and usually left behind if
AOL is uninstalled
✦Wireless Zero Conﬁguration: Allows Windows XP to try and conﬁgure
wireless devices rather than letting the vendor tools do the job.
And Internet Connection Sharing? Turn it off and buy a router.

Conﬁguring Other Systems
Other systems, primarily Macintosh and Linux, are ahead of Microsoft in some
ways, and even with them in others. Peer-to-peer networking, the equivalent of
Microsoft’s workgroup, has long been a standardized and well-oiled service for
both Macintosh and Linux systems (and the Unix systems before them).
Remember the famous tag line that “The Network is the Computer” from Sun
Microsystems? That came out in the 1980s. That’s why experts say Microsoft has
been catching up, not leading the market.
Microsoft does lead the market in volume, however, which has made the Mac
and Linux communities learn to interact with Windows workgroup networking.
And so it goes on today.
One excellent Linux desktop system, Xandros 2.0 (www.xandros.com) provides
a perspective into non-Windows systems that may surprise you. Take a look at
Figure 11-21 and decide if that looks like what you’ve seen other places in this
chapter.
Figure 11-21: Networking from a Linux perspective.
To me, using Xandros or one of the other new Linux desktop systems
takes little mental readjustment from Windows. Notice how I checked the
Xandros system to use the same DHCP services the Windows computers

use. No problem. Want to put a dedicated IP address for the Xandros
system instead? Again, no problem (more details about why to do that
in Chapter 12).
Using Shared Resources
It seems I’ve spent the bulk of this chapter telling you to disable shared
resources. Yet sharing resources deﬁnes the essence of networking. But
Microsoft’s security for shared resources in the workgroup does not stand up
against Internet hackers, so I must nag on and on about separating your local
network from the network hookup to your broadband service provider.
Now let me show you how to share those resources, ﬁnd the ones available, and
make repeatable connections for later use.
Finding and linking to shares
Finding shared resources doesn’t take much work at all: Click My Network Places
or Network Neighborhood (Windows 9x/ME) and all the shared documents and
shared folders will appear. Figure 11-22 gives a look at one of my lab networks.
Figure 11-22: Click My Network Places in the Start menu and here you are.
You can set your display to show the listing in various ways, but the view in
Figure 11-22 seemed the best way to show the shared folders in enough detail to

280 Part III ✦Moving from Stand Alone PCs to a Network
be visible. Can you see the difference between the third icon from the top in the
left line versus the other icons? That one indicates shared documents.
Ten of the 12 icons represent server or storage appliances rather than other
computers. The 10 icons come from six different appliances, so you can have
more than one share per device. Two icons represent other personal computers.
Can you tell the difference? Not without reading the names you can’t.
You can ﬁnd some network shared resources in the My Computer screen as well.
Figure 11-23 shows a My Computer listing for a Windows XP Home system.
Notice the bottom icon on the screen? The one labeled Network Drives?
Figure 11-23: Making shared resources look like local drives.
The trick to making a shared resource appear in the My Computer listing rather
than just the My Network Places is to “map” a drive letter to that shared ﬁle
resource. Just as your main hard drive is (usually) Drive C and your CD-ROM
drive is (usually) Drive D, you can assign a letter to be a network shared folder
as well.
This is simple to do, and you start from the My Computer screen if you want (or
any other screen with the Tools menu item). Selecting Tools ➪Map Network
Drive opens the small window in the left side of Figure 11-24, and clicking the
Browse command button next to the Folder ﬁeld opens the Browse for Folder
dialog box shown on the right of the screenshot.

Figure 11-24: Map a drive via Start ➪My Computer ➪Tools ➪Map Network Drive.
In a network with multiple server or storage appliances, you may be listed as a
different user on one or another shared resource. For example, a network
attached storage device for use by everyone may have a default username
(guest) and password (password) to make connections easy. Another network
attached storage device may be more restricted, and you’ll need a speciﬁc name
and password. If this happens, you will have to tell that resource who you are
and your password. Windows will save the information to make connection
easier the next time. The dialog box to map a network drive allows you to login
with a different name and password if necessary. You can have as many mapped
drives as you have alphabet letters available.
Tech Bits
Old Timer Alert: Mapped drives like this show up in the DOS window (or
at Windows command prompt) and as a local link in the Folders display.
If you remember what the command prompt looks like, and use it now
and then, the mapped drive letters come in handy. Type NET USE at the
command prompt to see your connections, and those with mapped drive
letters will use those letters in the display.
Sharing resources
Windows XP makes it easy to share resources, perhaps too easy. That’s why I’m
glad Microsoft now includes a link for users to learn more about security and

sharing in the screen where shares are created. I just hope people read that
extra section if they’re a little unsure about what they’re sharing or why.
On a Windows XP system, right-click a folder (directory for some of us), and
choose Sharing and Security from the context menu. The Properties dialog box
opens, titled with the folder name (Broadband Properties in Figure 11-25).
Figure 11-25: Right-click a folder and click Sharing and Security; then pick your
option.
Windows XP still clings to the idea that multiple users may be accessing this
computer, so the top section explains local sharing and privacy. Quaint, but still
possibly useful.
The Network sharing and security section makes it easy to share the folder with
one click. You can see in Figure 11-25 the cursor pointing to the Allow network
users to change my ﬁles check box. In other words, shares are read-only unless
you explicitly set them to read/write.
This looks nice and easy, but it’s a step backward in security control. Windows
2000 offers more security over the ﬁles shared inside the folder, and even
Windows 9x/ME asks for passwords immediately. Take a look at Figure 11-26 and
see what Windows 2000 offers as way of security on shared ﬁles.

Figure 11-26: Sharing with an extra security step.
Windows 2000 enables you to limit the number of users that can access the
shared resource. Interesting, but it probably won’t be an issue in your home or
small business. But after I clicked the Permissions command button, the extra
window (on the right) opened and I have more options.
Want to add a single user who can access to read, but not change, the ﬁles?
Windows 2000 allows you to do that. So do most of the storage and server
appliances in the book discussed earlier. That may be a problem with Windows
XP, however, so be careful there.
The Kanguru iNAS-100 network attached storage device (with included router)
shows a nice representation of assigning access rights. Figure 11-27 shows the
screen, and shows that everyone has access to the Public share.
Kanguru lists options as Full access (read/write), Read-Only, and Deny access.
Normally, you don’t need to specify Deny access because everyone not allowed
by name or group is automatically denied. But if you have someone you want to
block from something, and that person is a member of a group with access to
that resource, you can deny access individually, although retaining the same
proﬁle for the group.

Summary
First, upgrade your system. Then get a router with Network Address Translation.
Then have fun. Then you wake up.
Windows operating systems older than Windows 2000 have more security holes
and require more effort to conﬁgure and secure than you probably want to
spend. Upgrade if at all possible.
Every networked computer should be secured appropriately with the network
situation. The more people on your network, the more need for passwords to
guard network resources.
No networked computer is really secure. The best you can do is to close all the
obvious security holes, keep your Microsoft operating system updated, and use
a router with Network Address Translation and a good ﬁrewall.

ou’re going to have an interesting situation when
you get more than one computer ready to connect
to your broadband access point. You will have to use the
same type of networking protocols, software, and
conﬁguration routines used by the biggest companies
and universities powering the Internet. But you need to
know only enough to make your small network run
properly. The key points for this chapter are:
✦Networking protocols (often called the protocol
stack), which provide a standardized way for any
type of network device to talk to any other type of
network device, without the user or application
knowing the details.
✦Networking software, most TCP/IP commands, that
interface with the networking protocols so
developers can network their applications.
✦Address management to ensure every IP address
on your network is unique.
✦How Network Address Translation hides your
internal IP addresses from the world.
✦How ﬁrewalls leverage TCP/IP software access
points to keep your network safe.

286 Part III ✦Moving from Stand Alone PCs to a Network
computer. Reading this chapter from start to ﬁnish goes beyond dry. It would be
considered cruel and unusual punishment, so I’ll sprinkle in some snide asides
here and there to relieve the technical load.
TCP/IP Details
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) runs the world of
networking today. By law, all networking books must have a diagram of the
Seven Layer OSI model (don’t ask, but it starts at the physical layer, includes
software that communicates to the physical component and handles transport
across the network, and the application software). Because this book doesn’t
have “network” in the title, I’m going to risk it and refuse to put the diagram in
here. Just think of TCP/IP as a supporting layer between the physical (wired or
wireless network devices) and the application sending or receiving packets, and
you’ll be okay.
If it sounds like TCP/IP is a long name for one protocol, that’s because it’s really
two global networking standards. They just work together so well everyone now
mashes them together.
Most of the descriptions of TCP/IP focus on the IP portion. They show data
streams being split into multiple packets that travel across the Internet via
different routes, and even arrive at the far end out of order, forcing the receiving
system to reassemble the packets to makes sense of the data.
Imagine sending a letter with 100 words, by putting each word in a separate
numbered envelope, and mailing that from your house to an address across the
country. I have little doubt the letters would travel through different mail-carriers
hands and trucks. They would not all arrive at the same time, and some letters
may be lost. And the recipient would have to assemble the letter by arranging
the contents based on the number of the envelope. That’s how IP works.
IP became the standard because it uses best-effort delivery, which is usually
good enough. Besides, a best-effort delivery mechanism uses few resources at
either the sending or receiving end.
On the other hand, TCP guarantees the data arrives by establishing a connection
between the two hosts (usually computers or routers) involved. This is like you
hiring a courier to deliver a package directly to another person. The courier
establishes the connection between the two of you. The TCP packets travel the
same path across the Internet and arrive in the same order they left.
But that guarantee carries a price on the Internet just as in real life. A ﬁrst class
stamp costs far less than a courier. Even a hundred ﬁrst class stamps cost less
when you factor in distance. If the courier goes across town, it’s expensive. If a
dedicated courier goes across the country, faithfully carrying your package in
hand all the way, the cost will be outrageous. Tying together the two endpoints,
along with the route between them, takes resources from many systems.

Tech Bits
Why are people excited by phone calls over the Internet? Because a typ-
ical phone call works like TCP, making a connection between the caller
and called. But phone calls over the Internet (VoIP for Voice over Internet
Protocol) use IP and best effort, counting on the fact that a few dropped
or out-of-sequence packets won’t ruin the call quality. This reduces re-
sources needed and means cheaper phone calls with acceptable quality.
TCP/IP isn’t necessarily the best protocol in the networking world, but it won the
popularity contest for a variety of good reasons. It offers robust networking over
huge networks. Other protocols offer that as well, but TCP/IP offers ways for
devices to join networks without needing to have their addresses listed in an
authentication database of any central server. This method eliminates the types
of bottlenecks (overloaded authentication servers) that can choke networks.
Why TCP/IP?
You may have heard that the Internet was developed by the Pentagon to
continue communications after a nuclear war. Close. The Internet was developed
out of a series of networking projects funded by Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency (DARPA) to link existing networks. That’s where the term
Internet came from: Interconnected Networks gave way to Internet.
Early on, universities (often while funded by DARPA) connected their existing
campus networks to the new DARPA Internet. Technically, the Internet is a
network of networks.
Other protocols developed based on the requirements for local networking.
Connections between systems were assumed to be reliable and speedy. TCP/IP
designs assumed the networks were not local, connections were not reliable,
and bandwidth for high speeds was not available. TCP/IP developers tested the
protocol on wireless and satellite networks from the beginning.
Why did TCP/IP become the only protocol allowed on the Internet starting on
January 1, 1983 (called Flag Day, although not the one on your calendar)? The
following reasons highlight the features that made TCP/IP the protocol of choice.
✦Connectionless Packet Delivery Service: This is the IP part of the feature
list. Until this technology, most networking (like the telephone network)
had to create a link between end devices. That meant the connection
protocol had to understand all the details of the network between the two
devices. IP skips this problem by mapping directly onto the underlying
hardware (or now wireless network links) and traversing the connecting
devices linking different hardware networks. Lost packets in a sequence
are requested when the receiving end realizes the packets are lost.
✦Reliable Stream Transport Service: This is the TCP part of the feature
list. When applications need a direct link and will be disrupted by packet
loss (which happens with IP), the programmers demand TCP. The network
connection gets established by making a link across the Internet reliable

288 Part III ✦Moving from Stand Alone PCs to a Network
like a wire between two systems. The sending device won’t send Packet
2 until the receiving device has acknowledged the accurate receipt of
Packet 1. (There are ways to speed that process, such as acknowledging
seven received packets at once, but they aren’t important now).
The following features, along with the maturation of TCP/IP starting in the late
1970s (work started in the early 1970s), made the Internet technically feasible.
✦Independent network topology: The protocols are separate from the
underlying hardware, because TCP/IP is a standard implemented by
every hardware vendor who makes network equipment. As long as the
hardware supports TCP/IP, the packets zooming around don’t care whose
name is on the router, computer, network interface card, wire, or wiring
hub. They all support TCP/IP, just like the road doesn’t care what type of
car or truck runs on top of it.
✦Universal interconnection: By using unique addresses, any two
computers on the network can communicate. The address uses a form
recognizable to all other systems on the network, and each packet of data
(often called a datagram in the early days) holds its source and
destination addresses. Because each data packet knows its destination
address, it routes through the Internet to reach it independently of other
data packets.
✦End-to-end acknowledgments: Some early networks tracked progress
across each and every connection point along the way. In other words,
each router a packet passed sent an acknowledgment back to the source
of the packet. That caused an enormous amount of extra trafﬁc, and didn’t
really tell whether a packet reached the ﬁnal destination. The Internet
protocols decided to rely on acknowledgements from the end points,
rather than interim points. This end-to-end acknowledgment scheme gave
the crucial information (destination reached) without the extra trafﬁc,
and works when the end points don’t share any direct links to each other.
✦Standards for applications: Although the lower part of the protocol stack
looks to the transport support details, the upper part provides support
for applications. Developers can use these existing services to provide
communication support for applications rather than trying to write their
own communication protocols.
TCP/IP wasn’t discovered. These protocols developed after long years of hard
work by networking pioneers. Some funding and technology came from the U.S.
Government, some from universities and other research sites, and some from
the early vendors making the newly designed hardware and software products.
This process called for everyone to share information rather than hoard it.
Groups of individuals gave up their time to meet and hash out differences to
ensure all parts of the developing network ﬁt together properly. Many of those
groups (with new members, of course) still remain to watch Internet
development, but the aggressive push of some large companies has distorted
the process away from a spirit of community to a spirit of commercialization.
Not all changes bring advancement.

Addressing
I wrote an article for Network World magazine in August 1996 called Finding Your
Way Through TCP/IP. The following is the ﬁrst line of the article.
“If TCP/IP’s addressing scheme brings back memories of new math, take heart:
you’re not alone.”
Doing that article allowed me to talk to many of the smart people developing the
next generation of TCP/IP. I also talked to managers and designers of large
TCP/IP networks. All of them missed their time estimate for when the current
version of TCP/IP would run out of addresses and the next version would appear
to add billions of new addresses.
IP address format
IP addresses represent four numbers of 8 bits each for a total of 32 bits. The
numbers appear as a group of four octets, or four groups of 8-bit numbers.
If you think IP addresses are confusing, be glad you’re not seeing the real IP
address. When you see an address such as the following:
204.251.122.127
The computer actually sees this:
11001100.11111011.01111010.01111111
Now doesn’t 204.251.122.127 look better?
All IP addresses (in IPv4 which is still the current version) must have four
numbers separated by the periods. If you don’t see three numbers in each of the
four address octets, they are still there. Several times I’ve used an address like
10.0.1.1 for an example of a router on my lab network. Technically I should write
it 010.000.001.001, but that gets confusing. Your computer will understand
10.0.1.1 just ﬁne.
The highest number you can have in any of these octets is 255, because that’s
the highest decimal number you can represent with eight binary digits (the bits).
Yes, the number is really 256, but binary digits start counting at zero, making the
decimal maximum 255.
One of my favorite computer jokes is “There are only 10 kinds of people
in the world: those who understand binary and those who don’t.” If you
don’t understand binary send me a note and I’ll explain.
You may have noticed the IP address 255.255.255.0 in some of the screenshots.
That’s called a subnet mask and helps separate the IP address into network and
host (computer) addresses. Subnet masking used to be a pain, but new advances
in software make it much easier because your broadband service provider has
to do all the work now.

290 Part III ✦Moving from Stand Alone PCs to a Network
There are three major groupings of IP addresses: Class A, Class B, and Class C.
These addresses separate the network and host addresses at the periods
between octets. You can tell which class an IP address belongs to based on the
following list:
✦Class A addresses: 1-127.0.0.0
✦Class B addresses: 128-191.0.0.0
✦Class C addresses: 192-233.0.0.0
There are only 127 total Class A addresses, and those were gone long before
anyone outside the Internet development pioneers knew about the Internet.
Numbers of hosts per class are as follows:
✦Class A: 127 total networks, nearly 17 million unique host addresses per
network.
✦Class B: Over 65,000 total networks, over 65,599 unique host addresses
per network.
✦Class C: Nearly 17 million total networks, 254 unique host addresses per
network.
Companies almost never get assigned “networks” anymore, because the Class A
addresses were snapped up in the early 1980s and the Class B addresses were
running out by the mid 1990s. Class C addresses are usually assigned to service
providers who slice and dice the network address numbers to allocate the least
number possible to each client.
Now you have an idea where your single IP address ﬁts into the scheme of the
global network.
Using the IP addresses from your provider
Many times, your service provider assigns you a dynamically allocated IP
address for your cable/DSL modem. That means your cable/DSL modem
requests an address when it starts, and a server at the provider assigns your
cable/DSL modem an available address.
If that’s the situation for your network connection, you don’t need to know any
of these IP addressing details. You’re welcome to stay if you’re curious, however.
There won’t be a test but at least you’ll learn something new.
When your broadband service provider assigns you multiple IP addresses,
which is what happens when you buy a business plan from some service
providers, things work differently. But the service provider must have some way
to tell its network devices which part of your address is the network part and
which is the host part.
This used to be done with the subnet mask, that 255.255.255.0 address. That
subnet mask marks the ﬁrst three octets of the IP address (the 255.255.255) as
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Chapter 12 ✦What You Need to Know About TCP/IP Networks 291
the network address, leaving the last octet (the .0) as the host portion of the
address, a standard Class C address.
But addresses are in short supply, so giving a home or small business user a
Class C address with 254 IP addresses wastes the majority of them. So service
providers slice the number down by increasing the number of bits for the
network portion of the address and decreasing the number of potential hosts on
those networks. There are two main ways to slice these addresses:
✦Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)
✦Variable Length Subnet Masks (VLSM)
You don’t have to choose which option you receive because that decision
belongs to your service provider. But many small ofﬁce service provider
options include six IP addresses you can use for Web and e-mail servers and
the like.
The conﬁguration details of Network Address Translation (NAT) are deeper in
this chapter.
Reserved addresses
Some IP addresses are set aside for internal networks connected to the Internet
through a NAT service, and I’ll discuss those later. But two addresses are
restricted in every network address scheme, internal or Internet:
✦xxx.xxx.xxx.0 is forbidden for use by individual devices because that
number refers to the entire network.
✦xxx.xxx.xxx.255 is forbidden because that’s the number used for
broadcast messages.
If you use a server to provide IP addresses to clients this will never be a
problem. If you type individual addresses into each network host, be careful and
avoid these numbers.
Running out of IP addresses
There are over 4 billion IP addresses available using the scheme in place now,
IPv4. Some experts believe only 5–10 percent of all IP addresses allocated are
actually used. So how can we be running out?
Because address allocation is done inefﬁciently, that’s why. A Class A address has
the room to provide IP addresses to nearly 17 million unique devices. Companies
don’t have that many, so maybe 99.9 percent of those IP addresses are wasted.
Even small networks waste space. I once was assigned the Class C IP address
204.251.122.0. (I guess I still “own” that address but my service provider from
that time is long gone now.) I have a huge number of systems in the lab for a
two-person ofﬁce, but I never used more than a dozen addresses at a time.

292 Part III ✦Moving from Stand Alone PCs to a Network
Experts I interviewed in 1996 were sure the IP address space would run out
soon. One positive engineer declared that IPv6 networks would be rolled out by
1998 (oops).
That turned out to be far too soon, as Network Address Translation became
popular and allowed service providers to control their numbering schemes. Now
my service providers assign me a single IP address for the cable and DSL modem
connections that’s usually deﬁned dynamically.
One of the big advantages of IPv6 is the hugely expanded address space. After all,
cell phones and beepers and data watches and PDAs all connect to the Internet
now and more will do so in the future. Here’s how the IP address numbers
work:
IPv4 has a 32-bit address space. IPv6 has a 128-bit address space.
✦IPv4: 232 unique IP addresses
✦IPv6: 232 × 232 × 232 × 232 unique IP addresses
How many addresses does that mean? Even if we allocate IPv6 addresses as
inefﬁciently as we have IPv4 addresses, that still leaves us over 1,500 IP
addresses for every square meter of dry land on Earth. That should even cover
the cell phones.
Short take? Don’t worry about IP addresses. By the time we need them, service
providers will have their networks updated and will pull you along with them
into the future with unlimited IP addresses.
Routing
Routing is the process of moving a data packet from its source to its destination
in general terms, and speciﬁcally moving a data packet from one network to the
next network using the best pathway across the network. Routers can be
hardware appliances, as discussed earlier, that you place between your
cable/DSL modems and your network or software modules inside other servers.
Bridging is like routing, but not as complicated. When a data packet arrives at a
bridge, the bridge software checks the low-level packet destination address.
Then the bridge makes a simple decision: is the address on the side of the
network where the packet already is? If so, ignore the packet. If not, pass the
packet to the other side of the bridge. These are great devices for segmenting
high trafﬁc networks, but they aren’t smart enough to make complex decisions.
Router software examines data packets at a higher level of the stack of
networking protocols than do bridges. At this level, the router can see where the
packet came from and where it is going, and make a judgment about the best
direction to send the packet. The routing table in each router holds information
about optimal network routes for data packets coming to the router.

Your router will have a very easy decision to make, because it will connect to
your service provider. Any packet leaving your internal network will go upstream
to your service provider and then out to the Internet. Your service provider has
some serious routers, however, and ﬁghts with them daily to keep them up to
date, active, current, and processing packets at the highest speed possible.
Cisco has an excellent TCP/IP tutorial including most routing protocols
at cisco.com/warp/public/535/4.html
Any routing information necessary for your situation will come directly from
your service provider. But unless you start getting into multiple network
connections or virtual private networks, you can usually avoid diving into the
world of routers.
Dynamic Host Conﬁguration Protocol
I’ve mentioned Dynamic Host Conﬁguration Protocol (DHCP) several times while
dealing with network setup. Now you get to see what it is, why it’s useful, and
why you will like it.
DHCP is an internal network management tool. If your network has one
computer connected to a broadband service provider, network administration
means nothing. Even if your network is in a small business with 25 computers,
network administration will not ruin your day (at least the DHCP part won’t).
But imagine your job revolves around corralling a thousand computers across
multiple internal networks. Imagine the thousand computers include 50 different
ways to set their IP addresses for communicating to the network. You do
remember that each IP address must be unique on the network, right? That’s a
thousand addresses to track on multiple networks.
Early on in networking, the pioneer administrators realized something had
to change. Tracking a bunch of computer IP addresses on a piece of paper
to remember which computer used which address seemed downright stupid.
They were computers, after all, not desk chairs. The computers should help the
process.
Thus developed Boot Protocol (BOOTP, pronounced Boot Pea). One BOOTP
server on the network watched the wires for a BOOTP request from a client
trying to boot up and get onto the network. The BOOTP server responded to the
request with a packet of information telling the client its network IP address and
the location of a ﬁle on the server to boot the client. This was back when hard
disks were so expensive even Unix workstations didn’t always have their own.
And BOOTP was good, but limited. More complex networks demanded more
complex boot arrangements. BOOTP required preconﬁguration of a host
database and didn’t handle the developing dynamic networks in which hosts
come and go and clients look to connect to the hosts without having to conﬁgure
their connection database.

294 Part III ✦Moving from Stand Alone PCs to a Network
Thus developed DHCP. Supporting dynamic allocation of network addresses and
support for newly attached hosts, DHCP became the successor to BOOTP. Even
nicer in a world of expanding network-attached devices, DHCP includes a way to
recover IP addresses no longer needed so another device can use them.
Tech Bits
A DHCP server is a device that provides network conﬁguration informa-
tion when queried
A DHCP client is a device that broadcasts a query packet to the network
asking for network conﬁguration information.
By 1996, DHCP was well deﬁned and marching through the Internet standard
protocol process. Before the world of personal computers really discovered the
World Wide Web, DHCP was ready to handle increased network IP addressing
chores.
What DHCP servers do
Any number of different routers and server/storage appliances include a DHCP
server. The server software isn’t that complicated and provides value for all
small networks, and especially when the appliance is the ﬁrst server-type device
on the network. In fact, in my test lab, the following devices include a DHCP
server:
✦Every network attached storage unit
✦Every server appliance
✦Every wireless router
✦Every wired router
Essentially, just about every server-type device of any kind includes a DHCP
server. Wiring hubs and HomePlug wiring (TCP/IP over home power
connections) seem to be the exceptions. Oh, and the wireless Webcam doesn’t
act as a DHCP server. Maybe that will come with the next software version.
The majority of DHCP servers manage the following for their clients:
✦Provide client IP address
✦Provide client’s subnet mask
✦Identify the default router for the network
✦Provide other DNS or netbios settings if needed
DHCP can also supply the following if tweaked:
✦Host name
✦Available routes
✦Application and directory-speciﬁc settings

Chapter 12 ✦What You Need to Know About TCP/IP Networks 295
I don’t want you to push the DHCP envelope, although I’m not sure if you could
use the tools delivered with storage and server appliances. But at least the
various products display DHCP in a way that won’t confuse people.
The DHCP servers you will be working with provide the following to clients:
✦IP address
✦Subnet mask
✦Default gateway
✦DNS server addresses
✦Length of time to use the address
When a network device conﬁgured as a DHCP client starts its networking
connection—whether that happens when booting up, when started, when
restarted, or when restarting the network interface card—the client sends a
broadcast packet looking for a DHCP server. The server sees the packet, checks
for available IP addresses, and provides one of those addresses to the client.
A network can have two or more DHCP servers as long as its client IP addresses
don’t overlap. Using two servers on a large network provides fault tolerance and
redundancy. You won’t need that in your home or small business network.
Tech Bits
Redundancy means two independent devices performing a similar job.
Fault tolerance means two or more devices connected in some manner
so that their resources remain available even after a failure of one or
more units.
Some DHCP servers, even those in network appliances, offer a way to assign a
particular address to a particular client. You must conﬁgure the Media Access
Control (MAC) address, the nonchangeable address set in the network interface
card hardware, into the DHCP server. When the DHCP server gets a request from
that device, it supplies the speciﬁc IP address you conﬁgured for it. This is
handy in larger networks, but won’t matter in a home or very small ofﬁce setting.
This feature may be called something like Address Reservation.
Besides, some of the DHCP servers in the routers aimed at this market assume
they are the only DHCP server and do not provide an IP address for the default
gateway and automatically use their own addresses. That leads to trouble as it
tells the clients the gateway to the Internet is through that router, when in fact
another router actually connects to the cable/DSL modem. If you want a second
DHCP server for redundancy or to provide IP addresses in two different ranges,
make it one of the storage appliances that doesn’t act as a gateway so it will
provide the correct gateway IP address.
DHCP server settings
Connect your router running your DHCP service to the cable/DSL modem. This
causes the fewest problems, and that way your DHCP server gets the DNS server

addresses provided by your service provider directly from the cable/DSL
modem. That means the DNS addresses provided to your clients won’t have to
be conﬁgured (by you) in your DHCP server settings.
For clients
Figure 12-1 shows the DHCP server section of a Netgear WGT624 wireless
(802.11g) router and ﬁrewall. Netgear sells many products through retail, and
you can see this router provides plenty of helpful information on the screen
where you must put that information to use.
Figure 12-1: Menu on the left, conﬁguration screen in the middle, help
information on the right.
Because the Netgear puts its DHCP server settings under Advanced LAN IP
Setup, the screen includes some networking options not found in older routers.
But when you read the help information on the right part of the screen, Netgear
tells you to leave the two Routing Information Protocol (RIP) settings at their
defaults unless told otherwise by your broadband service provider, because you
will almost never have to specify which version of the protocol used to
communicate between routers (RIP) on your broadband network.
Most routers don’t consider DHCP service as part of the “Advanced” network
sections. Providing IP addresses for clients on a small network ranks as one of
the most important functions for routers in this market, so they put the DHCP
functions under an easily found label on their conﬁguration screens.

One storage appliance/router, the Tritton ASAP, adds an interesting touch to its
DHCP services. Like many routers in this market, the Tritton includes four
Ethernet 10/100 Base-T ports to plug in computers directly or wiring hubs from
existing networks.
That’s pretty normal. But the Tritton adds a way to assign different IP client
address ranges to each of the four Ethernet connections. Look at Figure 12-2 to
see what I mean.
Figure 12-2: Different IP address settings available for each Ethernet connection.
Notice the default lease time for each IP address: 360 minutes. That’s the default
for the Tritton device, but that’s a shorter time period than any other DHCP
server I’ve tested.
Set your DHCP Address Lease Time to at least one full day. Many broadband
service providers reset your cable/DSL modem every day or two, and if new
information is provided to your router you want the clients to receive that
information fairly quickly.
Some clients, networks, and applications have trouble with short DHCP leases,
however. If clients disconnect from servers, or act weird in other ways, lengthen
the DHCP lease time to a week and see if that helps. Some DHCP routers allow
you to set lease times as long as 999 days, so check out your model.

298 Part III ✦Moving from Stand Alone PCs to a Network
For broadband connections
Your DHCP settings for the router connected to your cable/DSL modem can
receive conﬁguration details from your service provider. That’s the smart way to
conﬁgure your router so network changes are passed to your client(s) whenever
they join the network.
The Kanguru iNAS-100 has a nice connection screen with good detail. Figure 12-3
shows the Wide Area Network (WAN) conﬁguration, which controls how the
router connects to the cable/DSL modem. Your broadband service provider will
tell you whether to use PPPoE (Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet) or DHCP
(see more information in the Connection Options to Your Service Provider section
later in this chapter). Either option used for connecting to your service provider
will still provide the DNS server addresses (the servers that translate IP
addresses into host names) for your router to pass along to your clients.
Figure 12-3: Notice the DNS Server IP address listing at the bottom of the screen.
This screen shows the WAN connection, but in the Kanguru NAS/router this is
where you ﬁnd the DNS server IP addresses. Notice there are two DNS server
names. Fault tolerance in DNS name servers means the difference between
surﬁng the Web easily or being locked out of the Web if your only DNS server
drops ofﬂine or you can’t reach it anymore. Having two DNS servers listed makes
it easy for your client to keep going if one DNS server is out of touch.
Did you notice the gateway IP address makes no sense based on my lab
network? That’s because that address shows the gateway IP address on the
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 12 ✦What You Need to Know About TCP/IP Networks 299
service providers network, where the cable/DSL modem sends packets bound
for the Internet.
The IP address just above that listing is the Wide Area Network IP address for
the router to use to ﬁnd the cable/DSL modem. This IP address, provided by
Comcast Cable, tends to change every day or two. The only reason I know this is
because the Kanguru iNAS-100 displays that IP address on the front panel LCD
screen, and I notice the numbers are different on different days.
Yes, this means that a device can be a DHCP server and a DHCP client at the same
time. That’s how IP networking works so well, by sharing resources. And devices
can certainly provide resources to some while using resources from others.
DHCP client settings
This is a snap. The designers of Microsoft Windows operating systems got smart
when they installed TCP/IP software and made use of DHCP servers on the
network. Now, Windows XP makes setting your client for DHCP use a one-click
job. And the default network setup for new clients is to look for a DHCP server
automatically.
Figure 12-4 shows the Windows XP Home networking conﬁguration screens. You
can reach the Local Area Network Connections Status screen various ways,
including by right-clicking the network icon on the task bar and choosing Status.

300 Part III ✦Moving from Stand Alone PCs to a Network
Reach this screen by highlighting your Ethernet network connection in the Local
Area Connection Properties window, the middle one in Figure 12-4. Once
highlighted, click the Properties command button to see the ﬁnal window
labeled Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Properties.
You have a place to put in a speciﬁc IP address for your client. That is often
necessary on larger networks or remote ofﬁces where links back to HQ require
special conﬁguration. Your home or small business network shouldn’t use
dedicated IP addresses for regular, run of the mill client stations.
The same advice goes for DNS server addresses. Your broadband service
provider will send the addresses to your router and DHCP server, so accept
those addresses. Large networks may have good reasons for specifying DNS
servers, but home and small business networks rarely do.
Windows now (ﬁnally throwing notebook computer users a bone) offers an
Alternative Conﬁguration page in Windows XP. This page allows you to set
another, completely different network IP address conﬁguration. Very handy for
those taking notebook computers between their home network and the ofﬁce, or
traveling between ofﬁces.
Domain Name Service
Sometimes called the Domain Name System, when you see the acronym DNS it
means the way to translate IP addresses (such as 64.236.16.20) into readable
names easier to remember, such as CNN.com.
Originally developed for local Unix systems on a network, a centralized DNS
server replaced the need to put the IP addresses and host names of every
networked system into a local HOSTS ﬁle on each computer. You couldn’t ﬁnd a
machine if it wasn’t in your own machine’s HOSTS ﬁle. With a handful of
machines, you could make something like that work. 50 machines turned that
manual system into scramble city. The Internet, obviously, made a manual
system impossible.
What name servers do
There are a handful of global “root servers” that are the ultimate authority for all
DNS queries. For years the Internet ran on just seven root servers, but hacker
attacks against those servers and the expanding Web made the addition of a few
more root servers necessary.
One reason some people like to call this a Domain Name System is that the root
servers for various networks and service providers constantly reference and
update each other. Although home users looking for an online bargain CD outlet
will never directly query one of the main root servers, they will query their ISPs
DNS root server, which queries a root server upstream, which queries a root
server upstream, which may query one of the root servers.

Chapter 12 ✦What You Need to Know About TCP/IP Networks 301
It may look complicated, and it is complicated to keep running and expanding,
but you’ll never see the complication. All you need do is provide your client the
IP address of one or more DNS servers. When you look for CNN.com, the name
server at your ISP tells your browser to go to 64.236.16.20, and CNN.com pops up
in your browser window.
Very rarely, a name server high up in the authority chain will go down or be
disconnected by accident or malicious intent. None of the main root servers
have had this happen, even though hackers have tried.
When a name server at your broadband service provider goes ofﬂine for any
reason, your surﬁng will suffer. Root server connections time out after just a few
seconds and the name server querying that server will shift to a secondary
name server. But those delays can cause hiccups in name service, causing your
Web searches for sites to fail.
Luckily, the fail-over time to a new server is only about 5 seconds, and service
providers have a range of options to keep name service up and running.
Although some worry about a global DNS shutdown, or hackers boast about
their ability to cause such, the name service structure remains solid, redundant,
and well protected.
Finding name servers
A name server provides some type of naming or directory service. DNS is a name
server of sorts, but doesn’t work as a typical directory service.
Your broadband service provider will do one of the following:
✦Give you the names of name servers to list in your TCP/IP conﬁguration
✦Automatically assign name servers through DHCP to your cable/DSL
router
In almost every case today, your broadband service provider will send the name
server details along with the DHCP setup for your cable/DSL modem. You
shouldn’t ever have to search for name servers.
Name servers must be listed when creating a new Web site. Your Web site host
will give you those names, or if you’re hosting your own server, check with your
service provider.
If your router doesn’t pick up the proper name servers, you will have to call your
service provider. Or, ﬁrst, reset your cable/DSL modem and your router, in that
order, then check back. If your devices don’t have a reset button, unplug the
device, wait 30 seconds, and replug the device. That’s a serious reset you should
really call a reboot.
No name server means you can’t resolve any IP addresses into names and
therefore can’t surf the Web. You can see your name server addresses in

Reach this point by right-clicking Network Connections (either in My Network
Places or in the task bar if the icon appears there when you network) and click
Status then the Support page. Then click the Details command button, and a
window that should look amazingly like the one on the right in Figure 12-5 will
appear.
If you need to set an IP address on a client, you need the addresses of at least
one name server. Do yourself a favor and copy down the information from this
page, and you can supply the IP address of the DNS servers in the space
requested when you write in a speciﬁc IP address for a client.
Static IP addresses
Standard residential broadband service plans almost always come with a
dynamically allocated IP address for your cable/DSL modem. When you
conﬁgure your router to use DHCP to get an IP address from your service
provider your cable/DSL modem gets a different IP address every time the
modem restarts or your broadband service drops and resumes a connection.
That IP address information goes to your router.
When you’re going out to the Internet, it doesn’t matter what your IP address is,
as long as it’s unique on the network. But users who want to connect to your

Chapter 12 ✦What You Need to Know About TCP/IP Networks 303
Web or e-mail server need a way to ﬁnd you. That means you need a stationary
location on the network. That means you need a static IP address.
Pros of a static IP address
Web servers have static IP addresses (with an exception I’ll explain in the
Dynamic DNS section upcoming). E-mail servers have static IP addresses.
Broadband service provider plans always include options for one or more static
IP addresses.
Here’s why Earthlink believes you should pay $15 per month more for a static IP
address:
✦Home teleworkers will beneﬁt by easier passage through corporate
network ﬁrewalls and connections to Virtual Private Networks.
✦Game players will be able to sign up for more multiplayer games.
SBC/Yahoo DSL doesn’t say why you should pay $25 per month extra for ﬁve
static IP address offered with residential service, but it has a price plan in place.
Verizon told me why I should have a static IP address, but called it a feature of
DSL rather than of IP addressing. Verizon echoes Earthlink’s reasons for having
static IP:
✦You need it to host Web sites.
✦You need it to host e-mail servers.
✦You need it for conducting e-commerce activities (I guess with the Web
sites).
✦It facilitates remote user access to business networks (VPNs).
Verizon didn’t show me a price for residential service with a static IP address,
but the charge is an extra $30 per month for the small business package.
It’s clear: If you want to host a server of any type (Web, e-mail, File Transfer
Protocol, or game) you need a static IP address. People can’t ﬁnd you if you don’t
stay put, and a static IP address lets you stay put in the world of the Internet.
It was interesting to me that no service provider I found in my search offered
reaching a Webcam in your home as an advantage of a static IP address. Guess
the Nanny Cam craze hasn’t hit the service providers yet.
Cons of a static IP address
Money. It costs more for a static IP address from every vendor of residential
broadband I checked, or at least could ﬁnd on their Web sites. Having a static IP
address costs you more money.
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
304 Part III ✦Moving from Stand Alone PCs to a Network
Why? It costs the provider more money. As I showed earlier in this chapter, IP
addresses are running out (some believe they are running out in the near term,
some believe in the far term). Supplying customers with IP addresses of their
own means the service providers can’t put those IP addresses in the DHCP pool
and lease them out.
Another reason some people avoid a static IP address is that is does make you
ﬁndable on the Internet. Security by obscurity can’t be your entire plan, but
having your Internet address change now and then makes it harder for hackers
to ﬁnd and target you. Whether that’s a real advantage with the fast-acting tools
hackers have today is a matter for another book.
So far, the arguments against a static IP address include the following:
✦It costs more money.
✦It’s slightly less secure.
Now if your company is paying for you to get broadband at your home, the price
difference won’t come out of your pocket. And if your company’s network
security requires you to have a static IP address, that’s what you’ll have.
But if you just want to host a Web and e-mail server, go another direction
entirely and sign up for a hosting service. With a hosting provider, you’ll get
much better network throughput. Providers have big, fat, and fast connections
to the Internet and they will keep the servers up and running. Running your own
Web and e-mail server, even with a server appliance, may be less fun than you
expect.
Dynamic Domain Name Service
Another option if you want to host your own Web and e-mail server but don’t
want to pay the high markups from service provider for their static IP addresses
is to check into a provider of Dynamic DNS. There are a variety of them available,
and you can ﬁnd them by searching for “dynamic dns” on your favorite search
engine.
Essentially, a Dynamic DNS service company keeps address listings for your Web
or e-mail servers (or Nanny Cam) on its hosts. An application resides on your
computer (or server) that notiﬁes the Dynamic DNS host when your IP changes.
It doesn’t matter if your broadband service provider reboots every night and
changes your address, because the local application will quickly update the
information on the DNS service company.
When others look for your Web site by typing the www.YourWebSite.com URL,
the DNS servers around the Internet will point them to your Dynamic DNS host.
That host will point them to your current IP address. Bingo, you have a
connection. And that connection costs less than any of the static IP address
options I found from broadband service providers (FYI).

Chapter 12 ✦What You Need to Know About TCP/IP Networks 305
Network Address Translation
Chapter 11 made it clear you need a router, and your router needs Network
Address Translation (NAT). That router must be between your computer(s) and
your cable/DSL modem. If you don’t have a router like this with NAT enabled,
you are not taking security seriously.
Some people think of NAT like a disguise: Your packets are really sent from a
computer with an IP address of 192.168.1.34 but the Internet services you visit
believe your IP address is really 24.0.103.139.
Some people think of NAT like a translator: Your packets come from a private
network, and a system in between (your router with NAT software) translates
the private language (er, IP address) into something the rest of the Internet
devices can understand.
Either way you want to think of it is ﬁne with me. Just enable NAT on your router
yesterday.
Tech Bits
Proxy servers are devices that act in place of other devices. Some people
consider them NAT devices; some people consider them more than a NAT
device, and some don’t know what to call them. If you use a proxy server
for caching Web activity or as a connection to outside Instant Messaging
servers, they do perform a type of NAT service. But they really aren’t the
same thing as a NAT, so don’t let people confuse you.
Public and private addresses
Remember that in the IP addressing sections earlier I said that every device
connected to the Internet must have a unique address. That’s the public address
that everyone else on the Internet can see. It’s not only a public address but also
a global address when you talk about the Internet.
Private addresses are those that are not seen on the Internet. In fact, the Internet
standards bodies created three separate IP address ranges that will never be
seen on the Internet because all routers must change or ignore those addresses
before passing on the data packets.
The private address ranges are:
✦10.0.0.0–10.255.255.255
✦172.16.0.0–172.31.255.255
✦192.168.0.0–192.168.255.255
You may have noticed one of these address ranges, especially the last one, when
looking at the default IP address of new routers and other appliances. The
192.168.0.0 network range is the most popular for new devices to use out of the
box. Many network appliances favor the 192.168.1.1 address for themselves, and
their DHCP settings start numbering at 192.168.1.2.
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
306 Part III ✦Moving from Stand Alone PCs to a Network
Large networks make good use of these private addresses because they provide
far more ﬂexibility and quantity than available public address ranges. The 10.0.0.0
network range can host nearly 17 million individual hosts and is easy to remember.
See an advantage for DHCP here? Network managers can renumber all
their network devices by changing their DHCP servers rather than chang-
ing their clients.
Because these private network addresses don’t go across the Internet, someone
on the outside can’t directly address any of your network devices (meaning
computers). Hackers can’t launch an attack against your computer, because
they can’t see it unless they’re on your private network.
Conﬁguring NAT
Even back in the mid 1990s when private addresses became available,
conﬁguration was straightforward and relatively simple. The good news is that
vendors haven’t found a way to make NAT more complicated.
There are two critical pieces to the NAT conﬁguration puzzle: your private
network address range for internal use and the IP address of the device running
NAT which is publicly viewable. The NAT device will be your router, and the IP
address it uses to connect to your cable/DSL modem is the public address. You
set your private IP address range when you conﬁgure your DHCP server (also
your router for convenience).
Figure 12-6 shows the most complicated NAT conﬁguration of any of the routers
in the test lab.
The Kanguru iNAS-100 is the only router with a speciﬁc check box to conﬁgure
NAT. How common is NAT? Every other router assumes NAT. If you enable the
DHCP server, the public address used is that of the router itself.
Translating the address
Behind the scenes a little bit more goes on than it appears with one check box.
But the process is straightforward. One explanation is to imagine you send a
letter from a PO box, using that PO box for your return address. The “public”
world of the Post Ofﬁce and the recipient see only the PO box address. When the
response comes addressed to the PO box, you carry it back to your home or
ofﬁce. Only you know your home address, and the outsiders only know the PO
box address.
But I need to show the send/receive dance with IP addresses. Let me simplify the
steps that occur when you send and receive a packet through NAT:
1. You request a Web page from the Internet.
2. The data packet leaves your computer bearing your private IP address of
10.0.1.23.

Chapter 12 ✦What You Need to Know About TCP/IP Networks 307
Figure 12-6: Check the box, and NAT is conﬁgured.
3. The router receives the outgoing packet.
4. The router replaces the 10.0.1.23 IP address with its own IP address of
24.0.103.149.
5. The router adds a port number to the outgoing IP address so it now looks
like 24.0.103.149:5788.
6. The router makes an entry in a database table to track all incoming
packets addressed to port number 5788 as belonging to 10.0.1.23.
7. The Web site responds and sends a packet to 24.0.103.149:5788.
8. The router receives the packet addressed to port 5788 and checks the
address table.
9. The router changes the IP address to that of your computer (10.0.1.23)
and delivers the packet.
Actually, there are a few more details in there with port number tracking for the
internal and external addresses and port numbers used to address Web pages
and the like. But all this happens under the covers, out of sight, and literally out
of mind. This stuff works, and works reliably.
A port number just speciﬁes a software address and allows the router to track
outgoing packets and match the incoming packets to the correct internal device
that requested the packet. The other port numbers get involved because when

you send a packet to a Web page you really send it to 129.201.34.7:80 because
port 80 identiﬁes the software listening for Web page requests.
Is NAT enough security?
Short answer? No, but it’s a good start.
Security experts always advise layers of defense. Your home exempliﬁes a
layered defense, for example. You have locks on the door. You have an alarm
system. You have all your jewels and extensive gold coin collection (fun to
pretend, right?) locked in a safe. You have insurance on your jewels and gold
coins.
Your excellent lock and alarm system keeps burglars out, like NAT keeps hackers
out. But the locks and alarms do nothing to stop someone you let into your
home, like the FedEx or UPS person, from getting to your jewels and gold coins.
NAT does nothing to stop worms, viruses, and Trojans. It does nothing to back
up and protect your ﬁles. It keeps your internal devices hidden, but only from
outsiders.
NAT limitations
Many new network features, such as multiplayer games and peer-to-peer
networks, want a direct connection to the actual device, not a NAT server.
Sometimes remote ofﬁce connections, such as Virtual Private Networks,
have a problem with a NAT server, although this problem is easing quite a bit.
A new function called Realm Speciﬁc IP (RSIP) works for large companies by
adding the public address at the client (your computer) rather than the NAT
server. The NAT server routes the new public address out of the network to the
Internet. This requires a new server to hand out the public IP addresses and
related port numbers and some new client software. Good for large companies,
but home users and small businesses won’t employ this for a while.
NAT products make allowances for more game playing and other peer-to-peer
network connections today. One feature of Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) will
address this issue to upgrade NAT to eliminate the current limitations. Not yet,
perhaps, but soon.
Firewalls
You know people tell you without a ﬁrewall you’re open to the world of hackers
and other Internet deviants. Good news is that your NAT service acts as a
ﬁrewall, and in fact is one of the main components of good security. In fact, a
“ﬁrewall” is really a collection of services that provide protection, not some
single item with magical properties.

Chapter 12 ✦What You Need to Know About TCP/IP Networks 309
The features that make up a “ﬁrewall” vary depending on who’s selling the
ﬁrewall. Here is a list of most common functions:
✦Packet ﬁlter: Examines each packet leaving or entering the network and
accepts or rejects that packet based on rules conﬁgured by the network
administrator. Difﬁcult to get working correctly.
✦Application gateway: Tightens security on speciﬁc applications such as
various servers.
✦Circuit-level gateway: Controls TCP and Universal Datagram Protocol
(UDP), which is part of the TCP/IP suite connections.
✦Proxy server: Hides all internal network addresses.
✦Network address translation: Hides internal addresses and functions as
a special type of proxy server.
✦Stateful inspection: Veriﬁes that incoming packets match a request from
an internal user. Can examine many parts of the packet, focusing on
addresses, applications, or ports requested.
Firewalls, at least the better ones, use two or more of these techniques. Again, a
ﬁrewall guards the gates of your network but doesn’t automatically secure and
protect everything on your network against worms, viruses, or user mistakes.
There are a boatload of books and Web information on the care and feeding of
ﬁrewalls. Dig in as much as you want, but it’s not a casual subject, and not one that
home users or even small businesses need to worry about as much as they do.
Both groups need a ﬁrewall, but default conﬁgurations from newer ﬁrewalls are
better than expert conﬁgurations done by security consultants a few years ago.
Router-based ﬁrewalls
Yes, many routers have ﬁrewalls. But because NAT falls under the deﬁnition of a
ﬁrewall, you must verify that you’re getting the level of protection you paid for, if
you paid extra. And before you pay extra, make sure you will use the features if
they are there. Conﬁguring ﬁrewalls requires more time and experience than
many people (including me in most cases) want to devote to the project.
The good news is that if you want a ﬁrewall, the router is the place for your
ﬁrewall. Your broadband service provider has security and ﬁrewalls on its side
of your cable/DSL modem, but can’t check your trafﬁc.
One good job for ﬁrewalls is to show when packets are leaving your computer.
These warnings are meant to alert you to Trojan applications sending out
information. All I ever see, however, are messages leaving some type of Windows
XP software subsystem to the Internet. And Microsoft wonders why people
accuse them of gathering information and personal data from PC users.
If you want tighter security, you need to conﬁgure you own ﬁrewall. Your ﬁrewall
location options are the router and your computer.

310 Part III ✦Moving from Stand Alone PCs to a Network
Conﬁguring a router-based ﬁrewall
Most routers advertise a ﬁrewall, but remember that NAT falls under the ﬁrewall
umbrella. But many routers, especially the newer ones, include more ﬁrewall
settings and options than you probably realize.
The new Netgear WGT624 Wireless Firewall Router (108 Mbps wireless when
things work right) includes extra ﬁrewall services. The conﬁguration screen,
shown in Figure 12-7, is about as easy a ﬁrewall conﬁguration as you’ll ever see.
Figure 12-7: An easy but limited ﬁrewall setup screen.
Two features you want in a ﬁrewall are already conﬁgured for you: the Stateful
Packet Inspection (SPI) ﬁlter and Respond to Ping on Internet Port rejection.
This conﬁguration, straight out of the Netgear box, means that the following:
✦Packets coming in are rejected unless they match packets going out.
✦Hackers testing your address to see if something is there won’t get an
answer.
The second option about the ping response is often called ICMP response or the
like. Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is regularly used to verify that a
device is up and running at a particular IP address (among other things too
tangential to examine here). Hackers send ICMP packets to every address on a
network to see which addresses have active devices. If a device is active on a
particular IP address, the hackers can start trying to cause trouble.

Chapter 12 ✦What You Need to Know About TCP/IP Networks 311
On the other hand, network administrators rely on ICMP for troubleshooting and
testing. Another example of a good tool warped by bad use in the hands of bad
actors.
Figure 12-8 shows a ﬁrewall setup that is considerably more complicated. The
Kanguru iNAS-100 includes plenty of ﬁrewall conﬁguration options because it
offers service to outside users on the Internet as well as routing and ﬁrewall
services for internal network users.
Figure 12-8: Fine-tuning your ﬁrewall protections.
Let me show you what’s in the drop-down menus you can’t see, and explain
some of these options. First, the protocol options are TCP, UDP, and TCP/UDP.
For our purposes, UDP is the same as the IP packets discussed at the beginning
of this chapter. UDP packets are not guaranteed to be delivered and set up a
connection but make their “best effort” to do so.
✦Source menu includes Indicate address (showing), Exclude indicate
address, and Any address. The address referred to is the Source IP
Address listed later in this list.
✦Source Port options include any (showing), WWW (World Wide Web), FTP
(File Transfer Protocol), FTPDATA, SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol),
POP3 (Post Ofﬁce Protocol version 3 used in most e-mail transactions),
Telnet (remote terminal connection), and Other. When you select one of
the options in the drop-down menu, it automatically ﬁlls in the port
number. For example, pick WWW and port 80 will appear in the window. If

you want to block or allow another port number, use the Other option
and type the port number directly in the ﬁeld.
✦Source IP Address allows you to list the exact IP address, or network
range, to include or exclude. If you want to allow all connections from
your ofﬁce back to your home computer, for example, you would put the
IP address of your computer at work in this ﬁeld. If your company uses a
NAT or a proxy server, you can put that address in. If your company has
multiple NAT or proxy servers installed, you can allow the entire range of
IP addresses.
✦Source Domain Name works like the previous ﬁeld, but uses domain
names instead. Want to block all future packets from www
.AllSpamFromHere.com? Put www.AllSpamFromHere.com in that
Source Domain Name ﬁeld. Too bad that’s only an example I made up and
not real.
✦Destination ﬁeld refers to the internal device, which is the subject of this
ﬁrewall “accept or deny access” exercise. You can put indicate address,
exclude indicate address, or any address in this ﬁeld.
✦Destination Address Type can be either a single IP address or a domain
name.
✦Destination IP Address refers to the internal IP address mentioned in the
previous listing if you clicked IP address.
✦Destination Domain Name refers to an internal domain. Internal domains
are rare in home and small business use, so this will not apply to you
unless your situation is extremely unusual.
✦Action is the critical choice, where you allow or deny the rule you are
creating.
There’s plenty in that ﬁrewall rule setup screen, isn’t there? But not all offer so
much conﬁguration detail. Frankly, unless you have e-commerce servers and
active peer-to-peer connections across the Internet, you won’t need this level of
conﬁguration detail. But it’s nice you can get this level of protection at a price
reasonable for home and small ofﬁce users.
Figure 12-9 shows a new Linksys WRV54G VPN broadband router, which also
includes plenty of ﬁrewall-type protections. Yet the conﬁguration screen doesn’t
require as many decisions from you.
The screen shows the default settings, which I will tell you how I amended for
better security.
✦Firewall Protection: Turns on or off the Stateful Packet Inspection ﬁlter.
Enabled (default).
✦Filter Proxy: Controls packets trying to bypass security by using a WAN
proxy. Enabled (changed).

Figure 12-9: The new Linksys ﬁrewall conﬁguration screen.
✦Filter Cookies: Blocks cookies attached to Web site trafﬁc that can
compromise security but are required for many Web pages to function
properly. Disabled (default).
✦Filter Java Applets: Java applets are programs running on Web pages
which can execute inside your browser, compromising security, but they
also provide needed functionality for many programs. Disabled (default).
✦Filter ActiveX: ActiveX is another programming language for Web pages
using Microsoft technology. I block this, but I don’t play online games
requiring ActiveX support, either. Enabled (changed).
✦Filter Multicast: Allows one data stream to connect to multiple
computers at once. Used for Web video and audio, so blocking them may
stop audio and video playback. Disabled (changed).
✦Block Anonymous Internet Requests: Refuses to acknowledge ping
packets from outside, as discussed earlier with ICMP. Enabled (default).
Personally, I prefer to accept all the group deﬁnitions, such as those shown in
Figure 12-9, that are available. Trying to drill down and specify individual
addresses to block speciﬁc protocols, as you can do with the Kanguru
router/ﬁrewall is something I recommend you leave to the administrators of
large networks, unless you have online game issues, which are covered soon.

314 Part III ✦Moving from Stand Alone PCs to a Network
Using a personal ﬁrewall
You may feel a personal ﬁrewall provides you the required peace of mind to
make you comfortable cruising about the Internet. If so, you’re in luck, because
there are a variety of them and some are free.
However, if your home or small business network has a working router with NAT
and at least minimal ﬁrewall services, and you’re not hosting servers on your
internal network, you may not need a personal ﬁrewall. You may even ﬁnd
having both causes some aggravation without increasing real security.
Internet connection ﬁrewall in Windows XP
Microsoft made plenty of public relations noise with the inclusion of its Internet
Connection Firewall (ICF) in Windows XP. It even went so far as to change the
default with the Support Pack 2 version of XP and enable the ﬁrewall by default.
Thank you, Microsoft, for once again misunderstanding the world of the Internet.
You can only use Microsoft’s ICF if that particular PC is connected directly to the
Internet. When you turn on ICF inside a router with a ﬁrewall already in place,
your PC networking gets weird and you must change the Windows XP setting.
You check your ICF settings inside the Advanced page within the Local Area
Network Connection Properties window. Right-click the network icon in the task
bar or click Network Connections inside My Network Places and the General
window will open. Click the Properties button then the Advanced tab to open
the page with the ICF check box. Click the Settings command box in the
lower-right corner, and the window you see on the right of Figure 12-10 will open.
Figure 12-10: Some of the setting options for Windows XP ICF.

Chapter 12 ✦What You Need to Know About TCP/IP Networks 315
All the services you might host on your PC that Internet clients would want to
use are disabled by default. If you run an FTP server, check the box allowing FTP
access. The same advice goes for all the others, all the way down the Web
server. Yes, your PC can become a Web server on the Internet, but you probably
won’t do that within a Windows XP system.
If you’ve been curious about the variety of ICMP messages (send a packet to see
if a device or software service is running), you’ll love the Advanced Settings
ICMP page. Take a look at Figure 12-11.
To ping something in the network means to send a packet to see if the service is
up and running. If you hear computer people talking about pinging someone it
just illustrates how another technical term moved into common usage.
Each item to be or not to be checked includes an explanation in the bottom of
the window as you can see in Figure 12-11. Nice of Microsoft to include that
information, and the deﬁnitions are accurate. Might be nicer to tell people what
type of problems they can get into when checking any of those items, but that’s
what help screens are for, right? Oops, the F1 help key only echoes what’s in the
bottom of the screen.

316 Part III ✦Moving from Stand Alone PCs to a Network
Here’s my suggestion: Don’t turn on any of these. Then move back one screen to
the Local Area Network Connections Properties page and click the link to Learn
more about Internet Connection Firewall so you’ll understand when you should
use it. Then get a router anyway, because you never know when some program
will reset your conﬁguration details and open your PC up to the world.
Other software ﬁrewalls
You can spend money on personal ﬁrewalls, or you can get them free (even more
than the one in Windows XP). To me, free is always good when the product
works. Home users have multiple free options as several personal ﬁrewall
providers make free versions available as a gesture of goodwill (and of
advertising their products, of course).
Perhaps the most popular over the years has been Black Ice Defender
(blackice.iss.net). Second to them may be the personal Zone Alarm
application (www.zonelabs.com). One that I ﬁnd interesting is the Sygate
Personal Firewall (Smb.sygate.com).
Figure 12-12 shows the main screen from Sygate’s product. The two graphs on
the left keep running all the time. I’ve seen no attacks in the graph on the right,
but this is sitting behind a ﬁrewall router, so I shouldn’t see any attacks.
Figure 12-12: A graphically interesting personal ﬁrewall display.
See the nice list of large icons in the bottom half of Figure 12-12? The one with
question marks on their faces are ones I must approve to send packets. Notice
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 12 ✦What You Need to Know About TCP/IP Networks 317
the Messenger service in the middle? I told you to turn that off, didn’t I? See why
I suggested that? The Messenger service sends invitations out just asking for
trouble (in my opinion).
You may not be able to see it clearly, but the last icon to the right has little blue
boxes in the bottom corners. This shows that it is transmitting packets out to
the Internet, and that’s correct. I’m streaming audio from the SoundClick music
server (www.soundclick.com) and the client application (Soundcast player)
must tell when it’s ready for more music.
The rules for blocking trafﬁc in a software ﬁrewall look much like those for the
ﬁrewall in the Kanguru router/ﬁrewall shown earlier. Each application has its
own conﬁguration screens with varying degrees of complexity.
If you feel the need for a personal ﬁrewall, download the options mentioned
earlier and others before you decide. See how automatically each application
blocks the type of trafﬁc that suits you the best.
Use the personal software that satisﬁes your security needs with the default
settings. No matter how good your intentions, you won’t create a proper set of
ﬁrewall rules. Even highly trained network managers for huge companies have
trouble creating the right set of ﬁrewall rules to be really safe.
Conﬁguring ﬁrewalls for online games
Gamers have it rough at times, because hosting games on their broadband
service connection makes the service provider mad (too much upstream trafﬁc)
and ﬁrewalls block other players from joining the game. But there are ways to
open some ports in your personal ﬁrewall to allow gaming, and they may even
work with your router/ﬁrewall appliance.
When you initiate connection to a game, your ﬁrewall matches incoming
response packets to your outgoing request. All is cool. You don’t have to do
anything to join a game.
When you create a game and invite others, you have a problem. When outsiders
respond, they are not allowed into the network. Bummer.
The best way to show how to do this is to show a conﬁgured ﬁrewall rule.
Figure 12-13 shows a rule in the Kanguru iNAS-100 allowing a user on the
network to play Warcraft III.
Warcraft III requires TCP port number 6112 open for remote users to connect. I
put in the UDP port because earlier versions of the game (Warcraft II) demand
UDP as well and I’m afraid there may be a leftover need now and then for some
UDP packets.
Your game providers will make the necessary port numbers and protocols
available, because they want you to play the game. So if there’s a gamer in the
house, a more ﬁnely controlled ﬁrewall will be necessary than for a network
without gamers.

Figure 12-13: Opening a door to marauding war parties but not hackers (cross
your ﬁngers).
Proxy and cache servers
Your broadband service provider may use cache and proxy servers when
providing a connection to your apartment building. A cache (pronounced cash)
speeds data access by keeping the most recently downloaded content in fast
memory, close to the user. Service providers often run a cache server to increase
speeds. Imagine a neighbor downloaded a song from www.Ampcast.com, and a
moment later you download the same song. If the music ﬁle is still in the cache
at your service provider, you can start downloading it immediately rather than
waiting for the music site to send it across a thousand or more miles again.
When you read several pages of one site, graphical elements of the site such as
logos, images, and navigation buttons repeat from page to page. A cache server
will provide those from closer memory than you’ll get from the remote server.
You can’t always see a cache server because some of them work on all trafﬁc.
Other cache servers are one part of a proxy server, which you must know about
to connect to it properly.
A proxy server acts as you’d expect with a name like “proxy.” It acts on the
behalf of another server. In this case, a proxy server may ﬁlter trafﬁc, cache
trafﬁc, and increase security by providing ﬁrewall protections. You must set your
client computer to use any particular proxy server, as shown in Figure 12-14.

Figure 12-14: Setting the proxy server address.
Connections tab, and then the Settings command button in the Local Area Network
(LAN) settings area to open the Local Area Network (LAN) Settings window.
There are three ways to ﬁnd and connect through a proxy server. Most service
providers give you an address and a port number. You can see in the bottom
portion of the right-side window in Figure 12-14 that I’ve put in an IP address
(68.94.199.126 in this case) and a port number (6112). Your service provider will
give you the exact IP address and port number to use.
The section at the top of that window, Automatic conﬁguration, is most often
used by large companies with involved networks. But if your service provider
tells you to conﬁgure that section, at least now you know where it is.
Summary
This is nowhere near all the information about networking and TCP/IP that is
available. Fat books dedicated to the subject can’t cover all the details. However,
these are the areas with particular concern to home and small business
networks connecting to a broadband service provider.
Between the information in this chapter and helpful hints in the troubleshooting
chapters, you will be able to handle all the networking chores necessary for a
home, home ofﬁce, or small business using a broadband service provider. Enjoy
your network, and don’t let IP addressing schemes cost you any sleep.

ad things happen to good computers. And
the most dangerous threat to most data? Users.
Most people assume backups are to protect you against
disasters, such as ﬁres or the upstairs bathtub
overﬂowing and pouring soapy water into your computer
in the ofﬁce below. But users delete most ﬁles by
accident. For example, with one twitch of the mouse a
user might highlight the wrong ﬁle, or a user might think
format means to put into data columns when it really
means to erase a hard disk.
An insurance company in the United Kingdom did a study
in the spring of 2003 and learned that nearly half of all
small ﬁrms that have disasters, such as a complete
system failure or ﬁre, never recover. Nine of ten ﬁrms that
lose data in a disaster are forced to close within 2 years.
More bad news? Less than half the small businesses
studied had any type of contingency plan such as backed
up computer systems to help them recover from a
disaster. Because you’re smart enough to pick up this
book, I assume you’re in the half who wants to prepare.
Tools to protect data exist in greater numbers, work better,
and cost less today than ever. I will show you a dozen
different ways to protect and backup data. You can do
this automatically, manually, to tape, to CD-ROM, to hard
disk, to online service, and even to paper, but please do it.
More Backups Mean
Less Frustration
People make mistakes. People lose things. People name
their ﬁles in weird ways.

322 Part III ✦Moving from Standalone PCs to a Network
Hard disks die. Application updates blow up. Operating systems upgrades fail
halfway through.
Anytime one of these six “things” happens to you and your data, frustration
appears. When you’re in a hurry and one of these things happens, frustration
brings your family members aggravation and anger. Then depression arrives as
you realize what you once had has now disappeared.
I don’t know about you, but I have enough frustration in my life, so I don’t want
any more jumping from my computer. I can’t promise you that computers won’t
be aggravating and frustrating on occasion, but I can promise that reliable data
backups shorten frustration and avoid depression.
What to backup
The easy way to determine what to backup is to determine all the things you
don’t want to repurchase, retype, download again, or rescan. Because to get
back to where you are today, you may have to perform one or more of those
onerous and potentially expensive tasks.
If you use your computer for work, all work ﬁles need to be protected. Writing
the Great American Novel? Save it. Write music? Save it. Have a hard disk full of
digital photos? Save them. Do all your personal ﬁnances on the computer, as
many do? Guess what you should do with those ﬁles.
How about e-mails? Many people realize, too late, that they used their e-mail
folders as a history for all types of information that can never be reclaimed after
their computer hard disk grinds to a halt, or worse, when a child erases space to
make room on the hard disk for a new game.
If you or your family members are music fans, backup the music ﬁles and any
license information you paid for. Windows Media Audio (WMA) ﬁles, created by
Microsoft Media Player and locked into the Digital Rights Management (DRM)
controlled by Microsoft, must have the license ﬁle on the same computer as the
music ﬁles or you will hear nothing.
Be selective?
Many hesitate to start a back-up process because they have no idea how to copy
everything on their hard disk onto some type of back-up media. But you don’t
have to duplicate everything. You just need your data in most cases.
Those who worry there’s so much data they can never capture it all should
relax. I’ve been writing professionally for 16 years, and that includes 14
published books before this one. All my word processing ﬁles, in Microsoft Word
(.doc), basic text like Notepad creates (.txt)), Rich Text Format (RTF), a
standard ﬁle type for formatted text, and WordPerfect (WP) formats add up to
less than 200MBs of data. I can store 16 years of writing work on one-third of a
CD-ROM disk.
Research (by back-up vendors) tells us that despite the huge hard disks in
today’s personal computers, the vast majority have only 4–6GBs of unique data.
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 13 ✦Backup and Disaster Recovery 323
And here I have only 200MBs. So selective backup is an excellent option for
many users, if you believe me or the back-up vendor research.
You already have backups of all your operating system and application ﬁles: the
CD-ROMs in the package. You can count the original CD-ROM disks as a backup
with complete justiﬁcation.
Backup everything?
The other option some people favor is to backup absolutely every bit of every
byte on their entire hard drive. That’s ﬁne too it just requires a different
approach.
Many users download applications constantly, and that trend continues to
accelerate as vendors increasingly sell online rather than through retail outlets.
If you buy your software online via download, there are no backup CD-ROM disks
that came with the product. So those applications must be treated like data.
There is no right back-up philosophy; there is only the answer that is right for
your situation and comfort level. You must decide how much risk you can
tolerate versus how much time and money you want to spend to alleviate that
risk.
Please, do something. So many people do nothing about protecting their
data it depresses those of us in the business. Backing up your data will
save you more grief for less money than anything else you can do with
your computer.
Conﬁgure your PC for easy backups
No matter how you plan to back up your data, you can make the process simpler
with a little preparation. After all, the easier the back-up process is, the more
likely you are to make those backups.
My secret for conﬁguring your PC to make easy backups is to establish a data
partition separate from the partition booting my computer and holding my
applications.
This separate partition (a separate section of your hard disk set aside and
formatted to look like a different physical disk to the operating system) can be
part of the one disk in your computer, or it can be a separate disk entirely.
Network servers, and even some of the server appliances discussed in
Chapter 10, can get complicated with volumes and storage pools and partitions,
but the hard disk in your PC can be handled in a straightforward manner.
I always do one of the following:
✦Partition a disk for applications (3/4 of the space) and data (1/4 of the
space)
✦Add a second hard disk just for data

324 Part III ✦Moving from Standalone PCs to a Network
I prepare every PC of mine used for anything other than lab testing in this way.
Why? So I can copy all the data and have an easy time restoring data to another
PC, if necessary.
With the amount of data I have, using 3/4 of the disk for applications (the
programs themselves) and 1/4 for data works out ﬁne. Your recipe may be
different. If you have but one application, such as a music program to create and
mix music on your computer, rethink that ratio. In that case, you would probably
reverse my ratio or at least start out with equal size partitions for applications
and data.
A partitioned disk looks like a second disk to your operating system. So instead
of having two disks (hard disk and CD-ROM) show up in the My Computer
display, you will have three disks. Nothing else changes, except you tell your
applications to store data on the data partition rather than the same partition as
the application program itself.
Prepare your disk(s)
Of course, new computers always come with the disk formatted in one large
partition. I even reworked the Windows XP Home computer used in the
screenshots for this book and didn’t think it was necessary to create the data
partition. So now you get to see the process.
When I start Windows XP Home and look for a place to add a partition to a drive
I see no place to add a partition to an existing drive unless I reformat the drive
and start over. That means erasing every program on the drive, and I don’t want
to do that. Microsoft does not include drive partitioning software in its operating
systems for desktops.
The third-party program I use for handling disk partitions is PartitionMagic. This
product was just acquired by Symantec late in 2003, so you may still ﬁnd it listed
as PowerQuest Corporation (but go to www.Symantec.com to ﬁnd it now).
PartitionMagic 8.0 also includes a nice back-up software program called
DataKeeper. The software watches all your ﬁles and backs them up to a network
shared folder after every change to your local ﬁle. When you open a document,
change two words, then close it, DataKeeper copies the changed document
before you know what happened.
Figure 13-1 shows the opening screen of PartitionMagic running on a
Windows XP Home operating system. The existing local hard disk, nearly 30GBs
worth, is highlighted in the upper-right third of the screen.
Figure 13-1 shows a healthy, barely used hard disk. Notice under 5GBs of space
have been used on this drive, almost all due to Windows XP Home. A tiny bit of
the drive, 7.8MBs, is not partitioned.
My ﬁrst step is to create empty disk space to use. It’s hard to see in Figure 13-1,
but only 7.8MBs of disk space was open. By that I mean not in a partition,
because disk preparation often leaves some bits unusable because of the drive

conﬁguration and the way the operating system divides available space. I used
PartitionMagic’s Resize/Move command to make the primary disk partition, the
one I’m using already as Drive C, about 7GBs smaller.
This follows my formula for application space versus data space. A quarter of a
30GB disk is a bit over 7GBs, and that’s close enough for my purposes.
My second step is to create a new partition in the open space. Figure 13-2 shows
the creation step, after I conﬁgured the extra space.
Notice I didn’t make the second disk partition NTFS (NT File System) like the
primary one. I don’t need the low-level security NTFS offers, because I’m not on
a network with a lot of people. And, I can always recover data from a partition
formatted with FAT32 much more easily than one formatted with NTFS.
FAT32 (File Allocation Table) is a disk formatting method that dates back
to the early DOS days. The FAT32 upgrade uses 32-bit addressing for the
disk directory to handle modern large disk drives.
NTFS (NT File System) arrived with Microsoft’s Windows NT. The newer
format improves performance, management, and security controls,
which made it popular for NT servers. Microsoft recommends using NTFS
for all Windows XP hard disks.
Trust me, when the low-level NT-based disk booting routines get all buggered,
you’re, ah, frowning. In all my years messing with Windows, I’ve never been able

to save a disk when the NT boot loader error messages started appearing. Not
with Windows NT, not with Windows 2000, and not with Window XP. Perhaps I’m
not smart enough and there’s something simple I’m missing, but when NT boot
loader errors appear I just curse a time or two and reformat the hard drive
partition.
PartitionMagic queues the proposed changes and applies them all at once,
requiring at least one reboot to make everything work. After the reboot, I have a
second disk partition for data completely separate from the boot disk. When I
have to replace the operating system on the boot partition because of problems
or upgrades, the data partition won’t be touched. The screenshot in Figure 13-2
provides a nice before and after shot, showing what the disk will look like after
the partition operation.
I can also, if I want, change the drive letter of the new partition to Drive D. That
requires three steps:
1. Change the CD-ROM drive letter to F.
2. Change the second disk partition to Drive D.
3. Change the CD-ROM drive letter to Drive E.
I don’t think I’ll go through all that for this exercise, but some users feel strongly
that the CD-ROM should be the last drive letter in the chain. I try to be ﬂexible,
but you can be however you want.

Move the My Documents folder
Microsoft Windows makes many assumptions for users, and not all of them work
to the user’s advantage. The My Documents folder, for instance, is the default
location for saved ﬁles. But the folder is three levels deep in the directory
structure and is ﬁlled with other directories, making them four levels deep.
At least Microsoft made it easier to move the My Documents folder in Windows
XP than ever before. You can move the folder in Windows 2000, but there are
more steps. And making it move in Windows 98 wasn’t worth the effort.
My plan is always to put data ﬁles on the second partition of the disk. In the case
of the PC shown in the ﬁrst two ﬁgures, that means putting My Documents on
Drive E. Figure 13-3 shows the steps involved, which aren’t many with
Windows XP.
Figure 13-3: Putting My Documents on your data partition.
Here are the steps:
1. Open the Start menu
2. Right-click My Documents
3. Click Properties
4. Click Move
5. Choose (or create if necessary) a folder on the second partition
6. Highlight that folder and click OK

328 Part III ✦Moving from Standalone PCs to a Network
You don’t have to name the new directory “My Documents” if you don’t want to,
but that may look more familiar to you. Calling it DATA always works for me, and
I create subfolders inside the DATA folder.
Windows will politely ask if you want all the documents and folders from the old
location to move to the new location. I said yes. When the default save location
is My Documents, you’ll know they are on the second disk partition. Many
applications prefer to put ﬁles in the My Documents folder, and now those ﬁles
will be on the data disk.
Did you notice in Figure 13-3 that Windows XP enables you to save My
Documents on a network shared drive? That can be a handy option when you
want everyone to save their ﬁles on a network folder for easier backup.
Windows 2000 enables you to relocate the My Documents folder, but the process
is a bit different:
1. Open the Start menu.
2. Click Documents
3. Right-click My Documents
4. Select Explore
5. Right-click the My Documents in the folder view
6. Right-click and select Properties
7. Click Move
8. Choose (or create if necessary) a folder on the second partition
9. Highlight that folder and click OK.
Again you have the option of using a network folder for My Documents with
Windows 2000. That’s a good option for coordinating backups among a small
workgroup.
If your My Documents folder is still on your Desktop, you can shorten the
process of moving it. Right-click the folder, click Properties, and then click the
Move button to open the dialog box with the Select Destination process.
Personally, I prefer to name my top folder DATA with subfolders. After all, not all
the ﬁles you create on a computer can honestly be called Documents, can they?
My Files would be more accurate, or you could call the top-level Projects and
label subfolders with the names of each project (Smith File, Reunion, Taxes, and
so on). It’s perfectly ﬁne to store all different types of data ﬁles inside one
folder.
Back-up technology overview
Back-up technology’s goal is to enable you to move information from one
medium or location to another to keep it out of harm’s way.

Chapter 13 ✦Backup and Disaster Recovery 329
Early mainframes used those huge reel-to-reel tape drives shown in all the
movies in the 50s and 60s. Don’t forget that data printed on paper is also backed
up in a way. However, the person you force to retype all the information from
paper into the computer won’t be your friend anymore.
On a high level, there are a few options for back-up data storage. Here’s how I
break down the market players:
✦Floppies
✦CDs and DVDs
✦Tapes
✦Disk-to-disk for one computer
✦Disk-to-disk over a network
✦Online storage services
Full and Incremental Backups
Different back-up applications make a big deal about how they handle full back-
ups versus incremental backups. Full backups are what you expect: everything you
want backed up is done in one pass. These backups make ﬁle and folder restora-
tions simple, but the majority of the ﬁles copied don’t change from day to day, yet
you’re still backing them up. This takes time and storage space.
Incremental backups check to see which ﬁles have changed since the last backup,
and only backup those ﬁles. This saves time and storage space, but makes it harder
to restore ﬁles because you may have to search a bit to ﬁnd the last time the ﬁle
was included in the incremental ﬁle backup list.
Each option has advantages and disadvantages. Let me explain exactly what I
mean with each back-up technology now. Then I’ll list all the pros and cons in
the next section.
Floppies
People sometimes believe these are the original backup media, but only because
they’re too young to remember cassette tapes. Early Apple ][ computers, as well
as the ﬁrst IBM PCs, had cassette deck plugs on the back. Personal computer
pioneers used the cassette tapes to load programs and save data. One soon
learned to change tapes before saving data (ahem).
For the majority, however, ﬂoppies were the backup of choice. The early IBM XTs
had a 10MB (yes, 10 MegaByte) hard disk, and the 360KB ﬂoppies could back up
the entire disk in a manageable manner. Of course, this era also sold complete
applications, such as word processors, on a single ﬂoppy with room for some of
the ﬁles you created.

330 Part III ✦Moving from Standalone PCs to a Network
By the time hard disks grew into the 40MB range with the IBM AT, ﬂoppies were
the backup choice of last resort. No one I knew ever reliably backed up their
computer with ﬂoppies more than twice. Too painful and boring.
Floppies do have an important place in backup today, but they are for individual
ﬁles rather than entire disks. You can, I guarantee you, put an entire novel’s
worth of words on a single ﬂoppy.
CDs and DVDs
The advent of the CD burner excited many people for many reasons, but back-up
fans realized there was a 600MB backup storage location with relatively cheap
and relatively sturdy media. Use the “data copy” method of burning a new CD
and that becomes a great back-up option.
Just about every back-up utility program takes advantage of writeable CDs for
storage. With 600MB+ of room, they make good options. Writeable DVDs, with
4.5GBs of room, make even better options. I say that because I’m a big fan of
complete backups every time rather than a full backup followed by incremental
backups.
Tapes
Individual tape drives with up to 20GBs of storage on a single compressed tape
cartridge make excellent back-up options. The problems appear with tape when
you try to restore a tape made from one drive with another drive, because
sometimes that doesn’t work. Tape drive heads are touchy, and misalignment
means no tape restore. Sometimes a tape made months earlier can’t be read on
the same drive head after wear and tear change the tape head alignment slightly.
Verify tapes regularly by doing restores from the tape, not just by trusting the
tape software that said it veriﬁed the ﬁles as they were written. If you can’t
restore ﬁles to another system, the tape backup is useless.
Disk-to-disk for one computer
I break down the disk-to-disk backup option into two categories: for one
computer, and for a network. With one computer, you can use an external hard
drive with excellent success. With multiple computers, you really need to use a
network-attached disk like some of the server and storage appliances discussed
in Chapter 10.
Advancements in hard drive capacity coupled with decreases in drive pricing
now make external disk drives with plenty of capacity inexpensive enough for
worry-free acquisition. When you can get an external hard drive with USB 2.0
connections with 120GBs of storage for about a dollar or so a GB, you have a
great product.
Disk-to-disk over a network
Chapter 10 included discussions about the type of storage appliances that make
great back-up tools. Network Attached Storage (NAS) systems can hold many
times the storage capacity of all your networked computer drives totaled
together and make that space available to all.

Online storage services
Now that you have (or will soon have) a broadband connection to the Internet,
online storage services begin to make sense. And there are great advantages to
such a service, as well as a variety of vendors ready to rent you storage space
“in the sky” so to speak.
Pros and cons of back-up options
Wouldn’t it be wonderful if all back-up options worked great for all users,
regardless of circumstances? And if the Easter Bunny left Faberge eggs?
Unfortunately, the ﬁrst assertion is just as fanciful as the second. What works
great for one back-up situation may be terrible for another. Relying on your
neighbor’s stock pick from his “insider” friends will cost you less money, in the
long run, than trusting your neighbor’s back-up system to work for you.
Back-up system decisions involve a mix of the following considerations:
✦Cost
✦Speed
✦Lifespan of media
✦Backup ﬁle availability for restoration
✦Number of systems to back up
✦Offsite storage plan
✦Disaster recovery needs
The trick is to ﬁnd your perfect back-up system in the range of product options
available. There are far more options than you have the time or money to
investigate, I promise, so let me help you narrow down your choices.
Your decision points
✦How many computers do you have? Simple problem: the more computers
to back up, the more complicated the backup becomes, and the fewer
back-up options you have.
❑1–5 (2 points)
❑6–20 (10 points)
❑21–50 (20 points)
❑50+ (50 points)
✦How much total data do you have to back up? The more data, the more
resources. 5 points puts you out of the CD-ROM burner category into tape
or separate hard disk products.

❑10GBs – 100GBs (20 points)
❑100GBs and more (25 points)
✦How much time can the total backup take? If time is not a problem you
have more options. If time is critical, such as needing a backup
completed in less than an hour, you move out of the tape, CD-ROM, and
online products into hard disk products.

so, you add points.
❑Manual (2 points)
❑Automatic (10 points)
✦Ease of carrying backup media offsite? Offsite data storage is the most
critical component of disaster planning. If you can carry a burned CD
home from your small business and leave it there for safekeeping, that’s
wonderful. A writer friend of mine walks his dog from his home ofﬁce to
the bank where he puts tapes into a safety deposit box. Those who can
do something of that nature will do their backups more regularly and
store data offsite more often than others.
❑Very easy (2 points)
❑Medium easy (5 points)
❑Difﬁcult (20 points)
✦How long can you be without your data? If you accidentally erase your
DOCUMENT ﬁle and click the wrong button on the recycle icon and erase
the ﬁles inside rather than recover them, how long can you do without
those ﬁles? The sooner you must have them the more resources you
must devote to keeping them close at hand.

❑4 hours (5 points)
❑1 hour (10 points)

Scoring your choices
My scoring is unscientiﬁc, because I want you to come to a back-up process
decision you can live with and use reliably. The higher the score the more
resources (hardware, software, and time) you will need. You can feel free to
move up a level and implement a hardier back-up process than your score
indicates. But if you move down the suggestion ladder, you run the risk of being
extremely frustrated and angry one day.
✦40 points or less: You have few back-up problems. A CD-ROM burner will
do all that you need. But this score almost guarantees you have one or
two computers in a noncritical situation, such as home entertainment
use.
✦40–80 points: Now you’re bumping into the advanced home user or home
ofﬁce category. Number of computers, data volume, and/or recovery
speed likely drives your score up. You need a dedicated back-up device
and probably an online service for offsite storage.
✦80–120 points: Business systems are in order. More than one back-up
system (one for data, one for recovering computers from scratch) should
be on your budget. More offsite storage room will be needed.
✦120 and more points: You need everything in the previous category, but
if your need for uptime bumps you to this score you probably need
hotsite or server co-location services. You deﬁnitely need a full,
business-oriented back-up system with local NAS storage and offsite
storage to go along with the remote hotsite support.
My recommendations
Unless your backup needs are small (see the ﬁrst two scoring answers in the
previous section), you may need more than one option for backups. The tools
that grab lots of data quickly are not the same tools that recreate systems after a
www.it-ebooks.info

334 Part III ✦Moving from Standalone PCs to a Network
disaster. The higher your data score, the more options you may have to use to
cover your self, and your data, acceptably.
First recommendation: Do a complete backup data set every time.
I always back up everything at once—no incremental backups. Incremental
backup systems capture “all” your ﬁles, then later (and usually on different
backup tapes) saves only the ﬁles that have changed since the ﬁrst full backup.
The problem with this method comes when restoring such a system. Yes, the
software is supposed to keep track of where the ﬁles are spread across your tape
library, but there are often problems with those systems. And because tape
cartridges are expensive, the more you use for incremental backups the higher
the cost and the slower the recovery.
If your back-up system does incremental backups, make sure it stores the
updated ﬁles as part of the same ﬁle-set it created during the full backup. This is
generally how the hard disk back-up systems work, and I like that. A full restore
of a data partition will restore all the ﬁles in their most current version.
Second recommendation: Always send data offsite one way or another.
The problem with hard disk backups is carrying your data offsite. Believe me, if
the unthinkable happens and your computers burn up, the Network Attached
Storage box sitting beside your server will burn up as well. For that matter, so
will the tapes thrown into the cardboard box sitting beside the tape drive. Tapes
have no secure offsite advantage if you don’t take them offsite.
You must send your data offsite or your data is not safe. If not, you do not have
an acceptable back-up process in place. Period.
Online back-up storage sites offer easy ways to send data offsite, and my favorite
back-up tool, the IntraDyn RocketVault, makes this simple. The RocketVault is
highly recommended if your score is above 60 on the earlier decision points, but
I’ll talk more about this excellent backup for small to large businesses in
upcoming sections.
Third recommendation: Set up a system you will use every day. Period.
Great intentions do not recover critical ﬁles deleted three weeks ago. Good
back-up systems do that. And they can only do that when they’re used regularly.
Back-Up Tools
There are many, many backup tools available. These tools range from free
software that backs up ﬁles to your CD-ROM writer (most CD burners include
this software as well) to automated tape storage units that cost over a hundred
thousand dollars. I doubt you need one of the latter (but if you do buy one, put
me down for my commission).

Chapter 13 ✦Backup and Disaster Recovery 335
Let me show you ﬁve back-up tools. Two are software, three are hardware.
✦The ﬁrst product is DataKeeper from PowerQuest (now Symantec)
mentioned earlier. It came with the PartitionMagic 8.0 software, so the
price is certainly right. In addition, the SnapAppliance folks include the
software with their Network Attached Storage products, and I received a
copy with the SnapAppliance SnapServer 1100.
✦The second product is from Acronis Inc., (www.acronis.com) called True
Image 7. This includes features, such as disk cloning and shortcuts to add
new disks to your system and get the right information on the right drive.
✦The third product is Mirra Personal Server from Mirra, Inc.,
(www.mirra.com). This is a customized system that connects to the
network and uses Windows share networking to pull ﬁles from PCs on the
network. You can also access the ﬁles over the Internet and even invite
others to view shared folders full of fun stuff like vacation photos (there
are fun things, really).
✦The fourth product is an external hard disk from Olixir Technologies
(www.olixir.com) that connects via USB 1.1 and 2.0, FireWire, and
PCMCIA card on laptops. It functions as a separate hard drive when
plugged into your PC, but there’s also specialized back-up software. This
product differs from other USB hard disks used for backup because it is
shock mounted and can be linked with other units to form a much larger
storage space. It comes with Retrospect Express Backup software from
Dantz Development Corp., (www.dantz.com).
✦Finally, the best backup system I’ve seen so far is RocketVault from
IntraDyn, Inc., (www.intradyn.com). This customized computer sits on
the network like the Mirra, but it also forwards ﬁles to remote online
storage facilities, including well-priced storage offered by IntraDyn.
I have it set to send critical documents to a hidden directory on
www.BroadbandBible.com.
Notice I don’t have any tape back-up products in here? I prefer hard disk
backups combined with online storage over tapes. External hard disks used for
backup are bootable with the right software; whereas tape drives are never
bootable. And the cost of online storage for offsite security is less per month
than most tape cartridges.
Backing up a desktop
This section shows examples of backing up a single desktop to CD-ROM, tape, or
an external hard drive. You can also back up desktops to other network drives.
The other drive can be on a Network Attached Storage device or even another
computer. I recommend that you use a storage or server appliance rather than
another PC, however, because other PCs have users and thus are prone to suffer
from accidents. Storage appliances don’t have users trying to run applications
on them all the time, and so are less likely to experience mishaps.
Backing up three or four desktop systems doesn’t differ all that much from
backing up one. But once you have two or three systems to back up, the manual

method using things like CD-ROM and tape start because they become
inconvenient are likely to be neglected. That’s the time to begin looking for a
network-based solution that works automatically.
CD-ROM or DVD backup
You have two good options with most CD burners: Run a speciﬁc back-up routine
included with the CD burner, or conﬁgure a writeable CD as another hard drive
and use other back-up software to write to it. DVD writers, being newer and
more expensive (not to mention with much more space) tend to have better
back-up software included.
Remember to change the CD after you use it. Remember to take ﬁlled CDs offsite
for safekeeping.
Tape backup
I said that I prefer not to use tape, but you can make your own choices. The
prices for individual computer tape back-up drives with low capacity tape
cartridges aren’t too high. You can usually ﬁnd internal tape back-up units with a
capacity of 10GBs (up to 20GBs with compression) for under $400.
A single tape drive for a single PC may be overkill, but it will still work. The
internal tape drives are less expensive, but harder to use on other computers
because you can only backup shared folders across the network
Also worth considering is one of the new Iomega Zip drives. They hold 750MBs
of data and read and write more quickly than tape drives.
Any system with removable media like a tape drive or a Zip drive must be
managed properly. Remembering to change the tape and to rotate tapes offsite
for safety will mean the difference between a working back-up system and an
expensive failure.
External hard drive backup
There are over 150 back-up programs available on www.Download.com, and at
least ﬁve are completely and forever free for personal use. Surely one of those
applications will feel comfortable for you.
Figure 13-4 shows the backup conﬁguration screen for DataKeeper from
PowerQuest (now Symantec). This is the ﬁrst screen that appears when you
start the program.
Remember the My Documents folder we moved to the new partition? In
Figure 13-4 I’m backing it up to the SnapServer 1100 storage appliance using the
DataKeeper software that come with PartitionMagic.
DataKeeper allows an immediate backup, but it monitors the folders you tell it to
monitor for any ﬁle changes. Notice the cursor arrow in the bottom-right of
Figure 13-4. Can you read the info message? It says, “Monitor selected folders for

changes.” A piece of the DataKeeper program stays active and sits inside the
task bar. When a ﬁle in a monitored folder changes in any way, DataKeeper
updates the back-up copy on the remote drive you speciﬁed.
Backing up a laptop
Because people don’t back up their desktop systems often enough, how often do
you think they back up their laptops? Even less to never, that’s how often.
Laptops don’t stay put, so they magnify the back-up problem. But they are more
prone to suffer from accidents than desktops are, and often the data on the
laptop disk is worth more to you or your company than the laptop itself.
Even the largest corporations with plenty of computer technicians struggle to
keep laptops backed up. Desktops left on overnight can be backed up
automatically by a central storage server. Laptop users have to purposefully
perform a backup. Human nature being what it is, many laptops don’t have a
recent backup and some have never been backed up.
CD-ROM or DVD backup
Some laptops make life easy by including a CD burner. Some newer systems even
have DVD burners, meaning a single disk back-up session can hold over 4.5GBs
of laptop data.

Even owners of the thin laptops built for portability may still be able to use CD
burners. External CD burners that attach to the laptop via a USB 1.1 or USB 2.0
connection are affordable and lightweight.
External hard drive backup
When the laptop connects to your home network at the end of a trip, you can
back up all the information to a network drive. Or you can carry a hard disk in an
external housing with you at all times. Heavy perhaps, but safer for your data.
The Olixir Mobile Data Vault puts 80, 120, 180, or 250GBs into a box about the
size of a VCR tape, but much heavier. Olixir brags that its Mobile Data Vault can
withstand up to 1200GBs, and I’m inclined to believe that based on its
heavyweight chassis with rubber corners I can hold in my hand. Figure 13-5
shows the backup software included with the Olixir drive.
Figure 13-5: The Olixir DataVault 3DX appears as a back-up volume option
in the Retrospect software included with the drive.
Some of the newer external hard drives, like the Olixir, can actually boot the
system if you have the right connection, such as a new Serial Advanced
Technology Architecture (SATA), which is a type of hard disk controller installed
in a desktop. For laptops, the Olixir software creates a bootable CD-ROM with a
ﬁle snapshot on the external 3DX hard disk to boot and restore a laptop so
garbled it won’t even boot.
External hard drives tend to be heavier than you may want to carry in your
briefcase with your laptop and its power supply. But the rugged Olixir 3DX
erases any worries about the safety of the hard drive when thrown into a
checked suitcase, which is thrown again (and again) by baggage handlers.

Chapter 13 ✦Backup and Disaster Recovery 339
Online backup and storage
Traveling laptop owners should thank their lucky stars every day for online
back-up services, and back-up options back home that make it possible to
retrieve ﬁles remotely. The growing number of hotels that include Ethernet
connections to the Internet in every room makes it possible to perform
complete backup or restore operations quickly enough for impatient
executives.
Almost every online back-up service enables users to update incrementally ﬁles
that have changed since their last update. These updates, often just a few ﬁles
changed while the laptop owner creates and modiﬁes data during a trip, upload
fairly quickly even with a dial-up Internet connection. The back-up service
software varies according to vendor, but will generally merge changed ﬁles into
the complete back-up set to be ready if a full data restore is necessary.
If you have a laptop that you carry around the country, make a full backup over
your network from home to the online storage service of your choice. Then
every travel day, no matter what, hook your laptop to the hotel phone line and
back up all your changed data ﬁles. You can turn on the back-up process before
you head to the hotel gym for your daily workout (hey, it could happen) and the
process will be complete when you return.
Backing up network-connected computers
Here is where you have the most options, which is good because this situation is
the one with the most variables. Remember the scoring list a few pages back? I
listed different scoring depending on whether you have 1–5 computers, 6–20,
21–50, or more than 50 computers. That’s because your approach must change
as you increase the number of systems under your management.
With ﬁve or fewer computers, the tools listed for individual computer backup
work perfectly well. For example, handling two computers the same way you
handle only one doubles the time spent but doesn’t really add complexity to the
problem and solution.
When you get to four or ﬁve computers, however, the time element can start to
become burdensome. This leads to trouble as backups slide down the priority
ladder, because people (even you and I) tend to avoid unpleasant tasks. By the
time you have six or more computer to manage, you better start thinking of
network-based solutions or your backups will be done adequately.
Don’t fall into the trap of thinking that once you start a network backup all the
tools you used for individual computer backups are worthless. You will need to
think of a way to rebuild systems quickly after they are lost to hardware failure
(dead disk drive) or how to load all the data to a new computer. The individual
computer back-up tools you used for your two computers still provide data
security even after you have a dozen or more computers.
After you start getting more than a few systems to manage, the need to keep data
copies offsite becomes critical. One or two computer’s worth of data you may be
able to recreate in case of a disaster, but a dozen computers? That implies much

more data and many more transactions to recover. You need complete data sets
stored offsite if you want your company to survive even minor disasters.
Storage appliances to the rescue
Here’s where I believe Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices really come into
their own: small but growing networks that need shared ﬁle space and backup
but can’t afford the expensive and feature-overloaded server software offerings
from Microsoft and others. An inexpensive storage appliance, like the ones
discussed in Chapter 10, really make sense for a small network.
It’s nice when these appliances include their own back-up software, especially
because Windows XP Home doesn’t provide a real “back-up” program. But the
opinion of many computer consultants (this one included) is that trusting
Microsoft for data security can be dangerous. Use a different back-up program
than Microsoft’s offerings, even when one is included.
System Restore does good things for Windows XP Home users, but relying on
System Restore and the Recycle Bin alone will not protect your data as much as
it should. Having old versions of ﬁles available through generational backups,
which some vendors provide, can save the day. And long-term storage of
archived ﬁles, available with storage appliances and the right software, can
really cover your, ah, bacon.
Go Beyond System Restore and the Recycle Bin
The Recycle Bin in Windows makes life easier on many people. However, you can’t
trust it to be your only backup.
Why not? Not all deleted ﬁles move to the Recycle Bin, especially ﬁles deleted
from a command line or by some applications. Also, Murphy’s Law dictates you
will empty your Recycle Bin the day before you realize which ﬁle you desperately
need.
Microsoft’s Windows XP include a pretty good System Restore utility. This allows
you to roll back your PC to the time before you mistakenly changed the system
in some disastrous way. But rolling back the system for a ﬁle may undo other
changes you want to keep.
And neither option provides any way to move data offsite for safe keeping.
Yes, any shared network disk can be considered a storage appliance for my
purposes in this section. If you converted an old PC into a dedicated ﬁle server
in Chapter 10, the upcoming comments will work with that system as well.
But it won’t be as compact and friendly looking as the Linksys EFG80 in
Figure 13-6.
You can make use of a networked storage device for backups with little effort. In
Figure 13-7, I’m conﬁguring the DataKeeper backup software to save my ﬁles to a
folder named \\Kanguru\Public\Users\James for my personal back-up area.

342 Part III ✦Moving from Standalone PCs to a Network
You can set every user’s My Document folder to a network storage device so all
their stored ﬁles go there. Then when you back up that one storage device, you
get everyone’s ﬁles. However, nothing stops applications or users from storing
ﬁles in other folders on their computer. That means your wonderful back-up
method no longer works, because you won’t get the new local ﬁles scattered
over the user’s hard disk.
The advancement in network storage devices over the past year has been
amazing. Not only are prices coming down (because the hard drives are getting
downright cheap) but new methods of backing up systems and implementing
data security are appearing.
Two really nice products appeared late in 2003 that improve the storage picture
for home and small business users considerably. Let me show you the home
product ﬁrst, the Mirra Personal Server (www.mirra.com). Then I’ll show you
my favorite network product for all of 2003, the RocketVault Server Management
Vaulting System from IntraDyn, Inc., (www.intradyn.com).
Mirra Personal Server
The Mirra Personal Server is an interesting mix of network storage, automatic
backup for any and all ﬁles on your computer, and sharing mechanism over the
Internet. It’s not too small and not too big, as you can perhaps tell in Figure 13-8.
Just over ﬁve inches wide, it stands about 11 inches tall and 10 inches deep.
This product is aimed at home users, but the market penetration of network
storage in the home market is less than tiny. Perhaps growing numbers of
broadband connected families will increase that percentage, but Mirra has to do
something beyond backups. And it does.
You can share the folders backed up with the Mirra Personal Server over the
Internet. Mirra works this cleverly by managing authenticated users through its
www.mirra.com Web site, and you can send an e-mail with connection
instructions to your family and friends. Mirra signs in the users, checks your
Mirra box for approval, and then makes the connection between the user and
your Mirra shared folders. You can share all or none of your backed up folders.
Figure 13-9 shows the Mirra client software. Each PC (and only PCs right now)
must run the Mirra client software to connect the computer and the Mirra
device. This main screen offers a good overview of what’s happening on the
Mirra device.
When you load the Mirra client software on your PC, you ﬁrst make a connection
to the Mirra server on your network. Once established, you can set local folders
for backup whenever a ﬁle in those monitored folders changes. If that sounds
like some of the other back-up software discussed earlier, that’s exactly right.
Applications can easily watch your ﬁle system and copy every ﬁle changed.
You can monitor and back up only local folders, not any attached network
folders. But you can load the Mirra client software on as many PCs as you want
on your local network.

Figure 13-8: A combo system: backup and remote sharing device, the

Notice in Figure 13-10 all the folder icons have a small red dot in their bottom-left
corner. It’s red, trust me, and it mirrors the round red Mirra logo. Even when you
run local folder tools, such as My Computer, the red dot on the folder appears.
This way you always know which folders are backed up by Mirra and which
aren’t.
See the File and Folder Tasks window in the bottom-left of the Mirra screen?
There, you can perform the following operations:

computer. You can’t copy ﬁles or folders to network disks, however.
✦Share this folder: Send an e-mail invitation to someone to access this
folder over the Internet.
✦Purge deleted ﬁles from this folder: Mirra holds on to deleted ﬁles so
you can undelete them if you want, or you can clear them for more disk
space.
✦Purge old versions of this ﬁle in this folder: If you need space, you can
clear the eight older versions of ﬁles kept by Mirra, folder by folder.
✦Open this folder in Windows: If this folder is from your computer, you
can click this to pop open a Windows Explorer window of this folder from
your local hard disk.

keep track of your expenses from the ofﬁce? Your Mirra Personal Server makes
this simple.

Internet, you can connect to the Mirra Web site, give your name and password,
and they will fetch the ﬁle information from your Mirra Personal Server.

ﬁles, and the second one is marked (deleted) in the ﬁle listing. You can undelete
and download that ﬁle if necessary. The others are available for immediate
download, so that expense spreadsheet you need is only a few clicks away with a
Mirra Personal Server.
As cool as this product is, there are some caveats. This product does not make it
easy to store your backed up data sets offsite. You can, for example, download
all your data from a remote location using the Mirra remote connection, but
that’s a manual process and must happen one downloaded ﬁle at a time. That’s
not good enough to be a reliable offsite back-up mechanism.
You can’t treat this like a typical network attached storage device, either. The
only way you can get ﬁles to the Mirra is to declare the folder for backup today
and forever. Doable, but it requires extra steps.
The good part is that the Mirra Personal Server, at least in the spring of 2004, is
priced comparably or less than any other network attached storage device. So
you get most of what a NAS device gives you, but you also get the easy remote
access through any Web browser from anywhere on the Internet.
RocketVault
The RocketVault from IntraDyn, Inc., (www.intradyn.com) sets a new
high standard for small network backup appliances. (See Figure 13-12.)
This is, at least in my opinion, the ﬁrst and best back-up device a company can
get from the time they have three computers networked together until they have
hundreds.
Figure 13-12: RocketVault is built into a Shuttle PC case.
As one might expect, large companies struggle with backup all the time, and an
entire series of products has been developed called data vaults. The process for
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Chapter 13 ✦Backup and Disaster Recovery 347
grabbing ﬁles and moving them somewhere offsite and safe is often called
vaulting. That’s why RocketVault calls itself a “Server Managed Vaulting System.”
Here’s what RocketVault does:
✦Copies ﬁles from client computers using Windows ﬁle share networking
on a preset schedule.
✦Sends the ﬁles and folder you specify offsite to a secure storage location
at IntraDyn or a remote server of your own.
Two of the three critical components of a successful back-up system, to me
anyway, are capturing data without user intervention, and storing that data
offsite to be safe in case of disaster. RocketVault does these things, and also
makes for easy restorations, which is my third criteria for a successful back-up
system.
Setting up RocketVault isn’t difﬁcult, but there are steps to watch to keep the
security straight. You tell the RocketVault which share you want to copy, give the
username and password for that share if it doesn’t match the default username
and password for all shares you can set, and repeat the process for all other
shares you want copied.
You can list quite a few shares, because the low-end RocketVault has 240GBs of
disk space. The ﬁrst step is to name a group for this back-up process, and I used
Images. Figure 13-13 shows the next part of the share-deﬁning process.
Figure 13-13: RocketVault sees the entire network.
www.it-ebooks.info

348 Part III ✦Moving from Standalone PCs to a Network
The RocketVault then opens all the shares on that computer. Notice there are
several hidden shares that the SnapAppliance never shows normally to Windows
network clients, but RocketVault picked them up with no problem. Figure 13-14
shows these formerly hidden shares, and my name and password so RocketVault
can now back up the Photos share.
Figure 13-14: Selecting shares for RocketVault protection.
There are three back-up operations to schedule. First is the local schedule,
where your ﬁles are pulled from the shared folders across the network by
RocketVault and stored on the local hard disks inside the RocketVault (local
storage starts at 240GBs but goes up to 1000GBs).
The second storage type is RemoteVault. This schedule connects to a remote
server, either one of yours or from a host company (including IntraDyn, who
rents storage space to RocketVault customers), and sends the indicated share(s)
to that remote site. Files are encrypted during transmission and in storage, so no
one else can get those ﬁles and make use of them. You can schedule every share
at a different day or time for uploading.
Finally you have SychDR, the synchronization service between local shares and
the remote storage. These ﬁles can be updated and the contents of the local and
remote shares equalized multiple times during the day or continually as the ﬁles
change on the PCs.
Every share storage operation includes a Retention Period. You may set shares
copied on a daily bases to be retained for 14 days, or two weeks. You may set
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 13 ✦Backup and Disaster Recovery 349
shares copied on a monthly basis to be retained for 12 months, giving a full year
of safely backed up and protected ﬁles. Certain transactions, such as banking
operations, need to be saved quite a while to protect yourself and cover any
mistakes you must correct at the bank.
There are two ways to restore ﬁles. You can restore entire shares, based on the
date they were backed up. So if your retention period was long enough, you
could make a share look exactly the way it did three months ago. Figure 13-15
shows the restore by share and date method.
Figure 13-15: Choosing leap year day for the restore point.
The other way to restore ﬁles is to search for the ﬁlenames in the Search page.
You can search by complete ﬁlename, a keyword that ﬁlenames should include,
and even several words that are in ﬁlenames. You must select the group and
storage area (LocalVault or a remote location), and specify whether you want
the search terms to be case sensitive and whether all words are required.
When the search is executed, you see multiple entries for the same ﬁle. They are
arranged by date, taking into account the retention rate you conﬁgured for each
share.
The starting price for RocketVault as I write this is $1,495 for the 240GB version.
All versions include stout security (256-bit encryption) and local and remote
storage. Although the price may be high for a three-computer network, it’s
amazingly reasonable when compared to high-capacity tape drive units and for
the security it gives your data. This level of data security was far too expensive
for small and medium companies until RocketVault appeared.

350 Part III ✦Moving from Standalone PCs to a Network
External hard drive backup
Great for laptops, as mentioned in the previous section, external drives that
connect via USB ports do a good job on desktop computers as well. Systems
such as the Olixir 3DX understand backing up multiple computers onto one hard
drive unit, and their software will keep the different computer data sets
separate. And there are many more external hard drive back-up systems than
just the Olixir, of course, and all provide value.
The problem with external hard drives when you get more than three or four
computers is the manual part of the process. Someone must carry the unit over
to a computer, plug it all together, run the backup software, and carry the hard
disk unit to the next system. Not fun, and a process prone to being skipped on
busy days.
When you have large capacity drives, such as the Olixir (from 80GBs to 250GBs
in the same VRC-tape sized housing,) they become excellent ways to duplicate
another back-up system for easy offsite storage. Figure 13-16 is a picture of the
Olixir 3DX hard disk brick.
Figure 13-16: You can drop this hard drive and your
data stays safe.
Say you have a storage appliance in place, and it grabs all the data from each of
your four computers overnight. First thing in the morning, plug the external hard
disk into a networked computer and copy the latest backup from the night
before. Then put the external hard drive somewhere far away in the ofﬁce from
the server you just copied. If you can’t get the data offsite, at least get it as far
away from the other systems as you can.
Tape backup
Tape back-up systems remain more expensive and more error prone for the
small and medium business situation than the RocketVault. Disk-to-disk back-up
systems have been trying to take over the tape market for years, and the
convergence of less expensive hard disks and faster broadband connections to
move data offsite for safe storage are hitting their stride. I don’t expect
RocketVault to be the only back-up system using a combination of local disk and
automatic remote storage for very long, but I don’t believe that tape drives will
be able to drop in price to match them.

Chapter 13 ✦Backup and Disaster Recovery 351
Servers (like Microsoft or Linux or NetWare servers) often have tape back-up
systems built in, but that jumps the price up too high for home ofﬁce and small
business customers. Those servers with appropriate software often cost two or
three times as much as the server appliances discussed in Chapter 10. Tape
systems to back up 100GBs+ in one operation cost thousands of dollars, not
hundreds, and their tape cartridges are expensive as well.
Many people still like tape, and that’s ﬁne. If you’re one of those people, please
do these three things:
✦Make sure you can get a full backup in one pass, either with high capacity
cartridges or autoloaders that automatically ﬂow backups across
multiple tapes.
✦Verify that the cartridges can be read by your tape drive on a regular
basis.
✦Test ﬁle restorations at least once a week so you don’t lose too much
when a tape gets too worn to read properly.
I did review a Sony StorStation tape drive with new Advanced Intelligent Tape
(AIT) technology. Essentially an 8mm video tape with some electronics onboard
the cartridge to help track and locate ﬁles on the tape and speed search
operations, the StorStation or equivalent tape technology is the only type I
would consider for a small business network. Even a home ofﬁce with a serious
amount of data (photographer, artist, music recordings, or composer, etc.) can
beneﬁt from a tape that holds 90GBs.
If you love tape and can get a system like Sony’s, feel free. Otherwise, save
yourself some grief and get a RocketVault.
Online backup and storage
One of my three critical issues for backup is some type of offsite data storage.
You can carry a newly burned CD out in your pocket, send ﬁles over the Internet
to your Web site, or pay a service to store information offsite, but data has to be
offsite to be safe and useful for disaster recovery.
The availability of high-speed data connections now makes it feasible to move
large amounts of data over the Internet to secure storage that’s way, way offsite.
Huge companies with mainframes have done this for years, but now the services
are priced for small businesses and individuals.
There are nearly 50 online back-up services listed at Yahoo alone (http://dir.
yahoo.com/BusinessandEconomy/BusinesstoBusiness/Computers/
Services/Backup/). You may ﬁnd others, and companies offering other
services may include online backup as well, such as IntraDyn, which rents space
to service its RocketVault customers.
You can create your own online backup service if you want. There are two ways
to do this:
www.it-ebooks.info

352 Part III ✦Moving from Standalone PCs to a Network
✦Make a deal with a similar sized company and you store their data
whereas they store yours.
✦Buy Web hosting space from one of the zillions of Web hosting services
and send the ﬁles there yourself.
Online back-up services provide client software, much like the back-up software
discussed earlier in this chapter, to schedule backups and coordinate uploading
the ﬁles from individual computers or servers. These remote services offer
excellent back-up options for travelers carrying laptops around. In fact, they
may be the only way many laptop users ever backup a ﬁle.
How Your Small Business Data Can
Survive Disasters
As I mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, most data must be restored from
backup because of user error or mistakes rather than disasters. Other data
restoration efforts help set up new replacement computers with data from the
old obsolete system. Be glad you don’t have disasters often.
But disasters don’t have to be worthy of a team of Hollywood special effects
magicians crashing asteroids onto your computer. Not all disasters require a
visit from the ﬁre department. Much more mundane events can accurately be
described disasters when you realize what they have done to your data.
What if an employee gets really, really mad and deletes all the ﬁles on your
storage appliance, then leaves without telling anyone. Could you recreate
accounting ﬁles from 7 months ago under your tax ﬁling deadline? That’s a
disaster.
Wondering what happens to companies who get hit hard by some virus
infestations? Wiping all the operating systems to disinfect the computers and
restore everything from backup is one sad possibility.
What if your youngest child thought your CD drive tray was the perfect size for
his or her sausage biscuit? That could be a disaster as well.
Have you ever seen someone pour water into an ofﬁce plant that dripped onto a
computer? How about a mug ﬁlled with coffee into a computer case? I’ve seen
both. Those are disasters if you have no data backups.
Many disasters involve police reports and insurance claims. What would it do to
your home ofﬁce or small business if you came in one morning to ﬁnd holes
where your computers used to be?
Cross your ﬁngers and hope your disasters don’t involve huge ﬁres, ﬂoods, or
nuclear explosions. But understand that your data is still gone if the cleaning
crew kicks over a PC and crashes the hard disk.

Offsite storage saves the day
If a disaster of any kind destroys your computers, you must have data stored
somewhere to reload on your new replacement computers. If you have back-up
tapes and you must get a new tape drive because yours disappeared with your
server, you have only about a 50/50 chance of getting your data back. You need
to move your data offsite in one of the following ways:
✦Burn CDs and carry them home in your pocket at night
✦Make tapes and carry them home in your pocket at night
✦Use a Mirra Personal Server (and remember the Kanguru iNAS-100 offers
remote ﬁle download) and copy ﬁles to your home computer
✦Use a RocketVault and combine fast local data backup with automatic
online storage
✦Use an online back-up service from your single PC and know you can
retrieve the ﬁles anywhere you are with Internet access
Imagine a chemical leak closed the building where your small company is, and
you couldn’t go back to your ofﬁce until the EPA gave the area a clean bill of
health. Could you rent a few computers, install all your data from your offsite
backups, and be back in business? You can if you move your data offsite with
one of the options I’ve been nagging you about.
Here’s a scary thought as you do your taxes: the IRS can seize your computers
and keep them for 90 days. Completely legal, I guarantee you, because I did
consulting for some IRS branches once upon a time. When they returned your
computers on that 91st day, would you still have a business?
Tools that rebuild systems quickly
Many back-up software packages restore data to only working systems. That
means if your hard disk goes psycho and you must reformat it, you must go
through a full operating system installation before you can restore your data.
Some software back-up applications make what’s called a disk image rather than
a copy of the ﬁles. A disk image is the exact copy of everything on the hard disk
you can save as one giant ﬁle for copying to the hard disk, if necessary.
One new product from Acronis, Inc., (www.acronis.com) covers both the
backup and disk image angle. True Image 7.0 enables you to recover the full
system image or pick and choose certain ﬁles to restore. Figure 13-17 shows the
opening True Image 7.0 screen.
The two leading applications in this market, by most accounts, were Norton
Ghost and PowerQuest Drive Image. But Symantec bought both companies over
the past couple of years, and whether Symantec keeps the two competing
products is up to the powers that be at Symantec.

Figure 13-17: A new contender in the disk imaging market.
Acronis, Inc. Used with permission.
Creating a disk image is one thing, but making it possible to rebuild a crashed
system means you need some way to boot the system. True Image 7.0 includes
options to create a variety of bootable media, including DVDs. This addition is
handy, because copying most disk images to CD-ROMs requires you to burn
several disks to get the entire image. DVDs, with over 4.5GB of space, stand a
much better chance of putting a complete system image (especially when
compressed) onto one disk.
Remember that many of the details inside Windows operating systems,
especially Windows XP, are tied to the exact system where they were in-
stalled. You can’t take a disk image of one computer and overlay another
computer’s hard disk with that image, because the underlying computer
details wouldn’t match, and Windows XP won’t work properly.
If you partition your disk and keep the applications and data separate,
you have much less problem restoring a complete data set to a computer, even
if that computer is a different one from whence the data came. But even with this
method in your toolkit, it is handy at times to have a way to restore an operating
system back to a known good point. Acronis True Image 7.0 can do that, and gives
you plenty of ﬂexibility for storing the disk image and booting the system as well.
Data retention rules for businesses
Storage issues create enough headaches under normal circumstances, but new
federal rules for data retention are making life even more miserable. Not only
must you keep all types of electronic data now, you have to be able to produce
that data within 24 hours.

Chapter 13 ✦Backup and Disaster Recovery 355
Worse, there are conﬂicting requirements between federal and state laws,
although various government branches argue among themselves and catch
businesses in the middle.
There are two phrases that strike fear in many business hearts lately: HIPAA and
Sarbanes-Oxley. The ﬁrst covers medical record privacy, including retention, and
the second covers business records.
Here’s how long you must keep records of various types (at least a best guess):
✦Permanently:
Audit reports
Cash books
Deeds and mortgages
Retirement and pension plans
Insurance records
Labor contracts
Tax returns
✦Almost forever:
Employee medical records (30 years after last day of employment)
✦8 years:
Bank statements
Paychecks
✦7 years:
Accounts payable
Purchase orders
Sales records
Voucher payments
Withholding tax
✦6 years:
Payroll records
✦3 years:
Employment applications
Notice that electronic mail records must be kept if they discuss any of the items
in the preceding lists. Because those items cover just about every business topic
most people may every use, which means your e-mail must be kept just about
forever.
Even instant messages now fall under the umbrella of electronic
communications which must be kept, just like e-mail. One might think these laws
are made by hard disk vendors and back-up application developers.

356 Part III ✦Moving from Standalone PCs to a Network
Summary
Computers and their data run the world of business today, from the largest
companies down to the person putting knitting patterns up for bid on eBay. All
these computers create all sorts of data, and that data must be kept in good
shape and able to be recovered after anything dreadful happens to your
computers.
Remember: you must be able to capture data without user intervention, store
that data offsite, and restore that date reliably to have a back-up plan. If you
can’t do all three of those things, you don’t have a back-up plan, you have a
potential disaster. And you never want “disaster” and “no backup” to ever occur
in the same sentence.

nowing about networking protocols and software is
one thing, but actually connecting devices together
is another. Use wires? Go wireless? Is it safe? Is it secure?
You have more ﬂexibility in networking options today
than ever. So many options, in fact, that I put in a checklist
to help you decide which option will give you the best
network for your location.
Wireless security is a new concept to most, but it doesn’t
have to make you nervous. There are some extra
precautions to take, but once conﬁgured properly, the
data ﬂying over your wireless network can be just as safe
as if it traveled in armored cars instead of radio waves.

omputers have to hook together somehow. The
most common choice is to use wires, or network
cables between computers and other network devices.
The alternative is not to use wires, meaning wireless.
This chapter discusses the ways in which you can use
physical wires to connect devices. Some of those wires
will be new, and some of those wires may be in your
home, apartment, or business at this very moment,
waiting for you to discover their value in a networked
world.
Let me gather your choices together here so you can
ﬁnd what you need to get your network up and running.
Your network will likely include wired and wireless
connections. Information on how to select and use
wireless devices is in Chapter 15, but this chapter will
help you decide where to use wires and where to go
wireless.
For the wired connections, you have a full toolkit of
options to cover a wide range of installation situations.
Here are your major choices and a quick overview of
their strengths and weaknesses.
Here’s a look at the good points of Unshielded Twisted
Pair (UTP) Ethernet wiring:
✦Widely available, and UTP connections are
included in every network device
✦Highest networking speeds
✦Inexpensive
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
360 Part IV ✦Linking Your Network Devices
These UTP characteristics may give you pause:
✦Neat installations require drilling holes in walls and ﬂoors
✦You may feel tethered, especially if you use a laptop or other portable
device
Good and bad points aside, when your network components are in one place,
using UTP patch cables makes great economic and installation sense. Running
inexpensive patch cables between your cable/DSL modem, router, computer,
and other networking devices works great, especially if you can hide the cables
under a table.
HomePlug devices send Ethernet networking signals through the power lines in
your home or ofﬁce. The connections are not as fast as UTP Ethernet, but these
devices are great tools for linking areas to your network without having to run
any UTP wiring through walls or ﬂoors.
HomePNA (Phoneline Network) devices were an early competitor to the
HomePlug groups. Although still available, HomePNA trails far behind HomePlug.
Cable TV type coax cables are the transmission media of choice for some new
vendors. These have value in new installations tying in home entertainment
devices, but are not yet mature and won’t help retroﬁt an existing home or ofﬁce.
Choosing Between Wired and Wireless
Connecting network devices with wires is the time-honored method for data
communications. But the convenience of wireless connections beckons. You
must choose the right set of physical network connections to make your home
or small business network communicate within itself properly.
One important note before diving in: I include wireless network con-
nections under the label of “physical” because they are. I understand
that you can’t see the radio signals, unless you’re a visiting alien from
a planet where vision evolved to cover the radio frequency spectrum in
addition to the visible light we Earthlings use. But networking protocols
treat wireless connections as the physical layer of the network. It’s just a
funny trick of technical language that the physical layer in this case is no
more physical than the connection used by your cell phone.
For purposes of this chapter and the next, any network device with a wire
connected to the network will be considered wired. Any network device without
a wire connecting it to the network will be considered wireless.
Your particular situation will determine the best ﬁt for your network. Many times
the choice between a wired or wireless connection comes down to a coin ﬂip.
But because it’s your coin, you make the ﬁnal decision. I will lay out the most
common options and network designs, along with cautions and warnings where
necessary.

Pros and cons of wired versus wireless
It would be nice if the pros and cons of the wiring options played out neatly so
decisions were easy. Unfortunately, a disadvantage for one person may be an
advantage for another, making the pros and cons listing somewhat arbitrary.
Let me go down the list of important considerations in your wiring (or nonwiring)
choices and see if I can make your decision easier. The good news is that the
levels of performance and reliability in wired and wireless products make it hard
to pick something that’s absolutely wrong for a home or small business network.
Each area for consideration includes a number of line items (or factoids). Feel
free to check or notate items that make sense for your situation.
Security concerns
Security in this case focuses on keeping outsiders on the outside of your
network. Nothing in this section addresses other data security cautions such as
worms, viruses, or ﬁle safety through backups.
You may not feel security matters for a home network, but you are mistaken.
When you have any type of shared ﬁles on your network, you want to be sure
only authorized users see those ﬁles. Any type of ﬁnancial information or
material that would facilitate identity theft on a shared computer resource
becomes open to outsiders if you don’t take security precautions.
Always assume someone else can get into your network in some way, especially
when you are connected to a broadband service provider. Put passwords on all
network resources, even if you tell your network client software to ﬁll in the
name and password automatically. The security breaks if an outsider sits at your
computer but makes an eavesdropper ﬁnd a valid username and password to
gain access to your network resources.
No home or small ofﬁce security precautions will be able to stop a determined
attacker, just as no locks on the door will keep out someone who really wants to
enter into your home or ofﬁce. For a home network, you want to make security
breaches difﬁcult enough that budding teenage hackers in the neighborhood
give up and move to someone else to attack. For a small business network, you
want to make things difﬁcult enough that an outsider or malicious employee
can’t wreak havoc by gaining access to critical information.
Wired Ethernet network security advantages:
✦Wires contain their signals and do not leak out into the air.
✦Devices must be physically connected to the network and tampering is
therefore visible.
Wired HomePlug network security concerns:
✦HomePlug connections can spread beyond your home or apartment
through connected power lines.
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

362 Part IV ✦Linking Your Network Devices
✦Outside electrical outlets allow the opportunity for eavesdropping.
✦Radio signals are sent over the power lines and may radiate for a short
distance, allowing eavesdropping.
Wireless network security concerns:
✦Signals radiate out of your location to the rest of the world.
✦Default settings on most wireless equipment bypass all security settings.
✦Other Wi-Fi clients in the area may latch on to your network by accident.
✦Eavesdropping tools exist in a variety of mobile devices (see Chapter 17).
When security tops your priority list, wired Ethernet devices protect you the
best. HomePlug devices are relatively secure, but signals wander a short
distance, so close neighbors could get on your network. Of course, wireless
networking devices broadcast your network information by default, and
neighbors will be able to connect easily if you don’t take precautions. For these
reasons, access passwords on all network resources should be used without fail.
Speed
Everyone in the computer and technology business dreams of running faster and
jumping higher. The race winners for high speed always start with wired
connections and then the wireless folks catch up, or at least get real close.
The speed hierarchy runs this way:
✦Fiber optic cabling
✦Coaxial cabling
✦Twisted pair cabling
✦Wireless
✦HomePlug over home powerlines
Speed over distance with wired connections is a function of signal integrity.
Cables that keep the signal tight and focused, like ﬁber optics, provide the
highest speeds over the longest distances. Coaxial cable wiring uses shielding
around the core wire to keep the signal focused, which doesn’t work as well as
the ﬁber cables. Twisted pair wires use the twists of a pair of wires around each
other to reinforce the desired signal and reduce interference, but the lack of
shielding limits the distance to about 100 yards (300 meters or so).
Listed speeds on technology equipment lie just as much as your car’s
speedometer. Sure, the car says 120 miles per hour or more, but do believe your
car could do that? Absolutely not.
When you read speeds on the box of wired and wireless connections, you must
think of your speedometer. Yes, 100Base-T has a theoretical throughput of
100 Mbps. But after you get through the technical time delays in applications,
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 14 ✦Wired Connection Options 363
protocols, physical layer interface devices, and errors on every transmission
media, you can ﬁgure roughly 50–60 percent throughput of the rated maximum.
I generally ﬁgure about half the theoretical limit will be about the upper limit I’ll
reach, and I don’t expect to reach that too often.
That same formula works for wireless connections as well. And the wireless
products have to take into account signal distance, which doesn’t create a limit
for wired connections.
Distance affects wired transmissions as well, but those devices tend to work and
work and work until they reach their limit and the signals fall apart and don’t
work at all. Wireless tends to work more and more slowly until you can’t receive
a signal, for a gradual decrease in performance over distance.
Wired Ethernet network speed advantages:
✦Speeds remain constant until you pass the allowable range of the cable
(300 feet for 10/100Base-T) and the signal degrades suddenly.
✦1GB (one gigabit) over twisted pair wiring equipment is now affordable
and in general use in many company networks and even down to some
desktop systems.
✦10GB network equipment is now on the market using ﬁber optic cable but
work on twisted pair versions has started.
✦Even in loaded networks, speed remains fairly constant.
✦Hard-core game players may not like the increased latency HomePlug
introduces over 10/100Base-T wiring connection devices.
HomePlug Ethernet speed advantages:
✦HomePlug has a speed rating of 14 Mbps with practical throughput of
between 6–8 Mbps (faster than cable/DSL broadband networks today).
✦HomePlug connections run faster than inexpensive wireless devices.
Wireless Ethernet network speed advantages:
✦Speeds have increased from 11 Mbps to 108 Mbps (rating, not actual)
over the past 2 years and will continue to improve.
✦Installation time for new wireless devices is nearly zero, meaning you
start networking faster (hey, that’s a speed).
✦Wired devices almost always transfer data faster and for less money than
wireless do.
✦Wireless speeds catch up in a few years.
Wired 10/100Base-T UTP Ethernet wins the speed race every time. HomePlug
runs faster than the 802.11b wireless networking standard (in-depth info in the
next chapter about wireless standards) but newer wireless devices are faster
than HomePlug. But those wireless devices cost more money than HomePlug
www.it-ebooks.info

364 Part IV ✦Linking Your Network Devices
devices, and HomePlug will speed up with the next version. All of these offer
faster transfer speeds than your broadband provider will deliver, so you will
only notice speed differences for large ﬁle transfers within your network.
Distance
Every network technology has a distance limitation. Homes and small
businesses rarely, if ever, hit those limitations in most areas.
The trickiest technology for distance operations is wireless networking. Power
settings for client devices are usually rather low (about 50 milliwatts for most
brands of client networking transceivers) and affected by distance and
interference. Higher-power client products and special antennas can often
improve a tenuous wireless networking connection enough to be usable, however.
Hybrid networks (wired and wireless components together) provide solutions to
distance problems in most cases.
Wired Ethernet distance advantages:
✦Repeaters, hubs, routers, and switches extend the distance of
10/100Base-T considerably. Network devices can communicate across
four hubs end-to-end for about 1,200 feet of distance.
✦Routers and switches reclock the data stream and extend that distance
even more.
✦HomePlug wiring networks cover all the distance inside a typical home
(99 percent of all homes were completely covered because the guideline
is 5,000 square feet) with no dead spots.
✦HomePlug distance is limited to about 900 feet (300 meters).
Wireless Ethernet distance advantages:
✦Wi-Fi equipment limited to about 100 meters (300 feet).
✦Every obstacle (wall or ﬂoor) between wireless devices reduces their
effective distance.
✦Wireless devices connect through walls without knocking holes for wires.
✦Wireless coverage in one room allows a mobile device to wander around
the area easily.
✦Inexpensive antennas or placement adjustments can greatly improve
signal distance.
✦Wired connections don’t fade as they run longer.
✦Routers and switches extend wired distance, but there are limits to the
number you may have between any two devices (four hubs is the
maximum without a router or switch involved).
✦Directional antennas provide a huge improvement in wireless distances.
✦Use a mixed network to extend wireless distance.

Chapter 14 ✦Wired Connection Options 365
Wired connections almost always win the distance race, but may require extra
wiring devices for long stretches. Wireless signal reach can be greatly increased
with extra antennas, but those cost money. Networks that stretch over a wide
area often need a mix of connection methods to link everyone.
Tech Bits
Do-it-yourselfers will have a great time buying and installing all sorts of
products from www.smarthome.com.
Interference
Every electrical signal can suffer from, and create, interference. ElectroMagnetic
Interference (EMI) is junk radio waves created by electronic devices that
interfere with useful waves. Running a vacuum cleaner by a radio usually
introduces static in the radio signal because of junk radio waves from the
vacuum’s electric motor. Of course, those signals inside shielded wires resist
interference far better than wireless signals broadcast in the open air. Some
wireless devices, for instance, stop functioning when a microwave or cordless
phone close by starts up because all devices use radio waves in the same
frequency range.
Your job is to make sure you have options when interference ruins one part of
your planned network. Being able to mix and match wired and wireless devices
will generally give you the options you need to beat an interference problem.
Products are designed to handle the interference problems of normal homes and
businesses. If your home or ofﬁce is next to an industrial area, you may have
problems. If your neighbor has a huge ham radio system, you may have
problems with wireless and be forced to use wired connections.
The wired product interference resistance ratings are outlined in the following list:
✦Twisted Pair Ethernet is more resistant to interference than wireless so
microwaves and portable phones don’t slow the network.
✦HomePlug network devices include several advanced networking
algorithms to allow them to ignore interference caused by other devices
connected to the power lines.
✦HomePlug networks do drop their transmission rate when interference
disrupts the signal. Connecting a plug-strip full of other electronic devices
into the same outlet as a HomePlug device will slow down your network.
Wireless product interference resistance ratings are outlined in the following list:
✦Older wireless products (802.11b) have less resistance to interference
than newer products do.
✦Antenna placement can make a big difference in interference effect.
✦Added antennas can often overcome interference problems.
Interference, especially in the 2.4 GHz frequency range used by early wireless
devices and cordless phones and microwaves, can shut down your wireless

366 Part IV ✦Linking Your Network Devices
network. Spectrum management tools, used by large companies to survey their
interference problems, are far too expensive for home and small businesses.
Because you can’t really control interference (it may come from outside), you
may have to use wired network components to supplement your wireless ones.
Another option is to use directional antennas in some areas (see Chapter 15).
Either way, you can almost always ﬁnd a way around interference.
Compatibility between vendors
Networks run on open standards set by a variety of international committees
made of representatives from vendors and large customers. No proprietary
network technology has made a major dent in the market, or even been
introduced, in at least a decade.
That said, early versions of standards leave questions and vague areas the
vendors must interpret when they make products. Therein lie the gotchas for
early product versions as minor incompatibilities in the standards get worked out.
After a product generation or two, the vendors and standards groups work out the
vague areas in the standard and compatibility between vendors becomes a reality.
There are no compatibility problems between wired devices from different
vendors. There are few compatibility problems between wireless devices
following the 802.11 family of standards.
802.11b products have been in the market the longest, and work well together.
802.11g and 802.11a (you’ll get the details about b, a, and g in the next chapter)
work together pretty well. Some vendors are adding extensions to the 802.11g
standard to up the speeds, and those products are not compatible between
vendors because they do not follow the standard.
Wired compatibility advantages:
✦Every Ethernet device will work with all other Ethernet devices from any
vendor.
✦HomePlug products from different vendors usually work together. Balky
units may work ﬁne when plugged into different sockets.
Wireless compatibility advantages:
✦Products from various vendors supporting the 802.11b (11 Mbps)
standard almost always connect and work together.
✦Products released recently from various vendors supporting 802.11g
(54 Mbps) usually work together.
✦By design, 802.11g wireless devices work with 802.11b devices.
✦Early products supporting 802.11g shipped before the standard was
approved and will likely have trouble connecting to products from
another vendor.
✦Enhancements to the standard, such as “turbo mode” and the like, rarely
work between product lines.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 14 ✦Wired Connection Options 367
Compatibility between vendors summary:
✦Wired Ethernet products (10/100/1000Base-T) almost always work
together.
✦Update wireless ﬁrmware and client software to improve chances of
connecting between products from various vendors.
If a device connects with wires, it will be compatible with devices from other
vendors. That’s true across the board for Ethernet and HomePlug devices.
Wireless devices are touchier about compatibility between vendors, but second
generation products almost always connect across company lines. You may wish
to buy all your wireless products from one vendor so you have a single supplier
or only one management interface to worry about, but wireless compatibility is
no longer a major concern. But all bets are off when you get products with turbo
modes and other enhancements not in the standard.
Future network devices
Network research and development groups work with wired connections ﬁrst
because wires (copper and ﬁber) are well-known and well-controlled entities.
Some technologies run at such a high bit-rate that the cables connecting devices
can only be a few feet long (like disk cables from servers to high-end disk
subsystems).
Breakthroughs happen with cable and then spread out from there. If you want to
add the fastest and best new products to your network over the next few years,
make sure you have some physical network connection points available.
Some business and consumer technologies go against this trend. Wireless
products obviously arrive at the market ready for wireless deployment. So my
advice about wired connections works for all new products except those that are
meant to be wireless by nature.
Wired advantages for future devices:
✦Wires are a known media. They are resistant to interference and provide
low transmission error rates that are attractive to new product
developers.
✦Faster products almost always use wires at introduction and maybe, but
not always, offer a wireless version later.
✦Adding wireless networking to a new product, such as network
appliances, introduces an extra variable for users to manage during initial
setup and conﬁguration.
Wireless advantages for future devices:
✦Consumers love wireless products and many cool new innovations are
released as wireless products only.
✦Mobility for personal data products (PDAs and entertainment devices) is
a huge selling point, leading to wireless devices.

368 Part IV ✦Linking Your Network Devices
✦Laptops sell just about as many units as desktop systems in many market
sectors, and people like wireless laptops.
✦The Wi-Fi “HotSpot” craze encourages more wireless devices.
✦Wireless is more convenient for any device that may move around.
✦Vendors are starting to link to home entertainment systems to play
streaming audio and video ﬁles from the Internet, and are using wireless
connections to do so.
The future belongs to wireless for the cool stuff, because portability and location
ﬂexibility matter to consumers, and wireless delivers those features. Devices
that remain in one place, such as your router, servers, and desktop computers
will continue to use wires for transfer speed and convenience.
Pros and cons summary
After all the listings of advantages and disadvantages of your two wiring
options, are you clear on what you want or are you more confused? That’s
okay, most people in the networking business stay confused, so you’re in good
company.
A few situations force one option or the other onto your network design, such as
walls you can’t drill through or distances too far for wireless links, but otherwise
you can use what you feel most comfortable using. I certainly can’t make a claim
that one option, wired or wireless, always works better and should be your ﬁrst
choice.
Wireless wins the cool factor, although wired products win the “higher speed”
and “better security” awards. I believe the trend for personal and household
items leans in the wireless direction, because of the cool factor. Network devices
that stay put, such as routers and server/storage appliances, are already adding
wireless support to their marketing pitches.
Many new routers include wireless support as well as 10/100Base-T Ethernet
connections. Only one device I know of, from Siemens, is a cable/DSL router with
Ethernet, HomePlug, and wireless support in one box (Siemens SpeedStream
2524 Power Line Wireless Cable/DSL Router - SS2524). It may be listed by some
vendors as from the Efﬁcient product family, because Siemens bought the
Efﬁcient company several years ago.
Don’t box yourself in. Be ﬂexible, and look toward using all the tools you have,
including wireless, twisted pair Ethernet, and HomePlug where they make sense
in your network.
Where to use wires
Perhaps because I’m a creature of habit, I look to wired products ﬁrst. There are
wires all over the lab network in my ofﬁce, 100Base-T patch cables are cheap,
and wires generally work. But then, most of my computing devices have no
inclination to wander around.
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 14 ✦Wired Connection Options 369
Wired network products tend to be less expensive than their wireless
counterparts that serve the same function.
Closely located devices connected to a wiring hub or network router through
patch cables are cost effective and controllable as far as I’m concerned.
Stack them up, bundle the patch cables as neatly as possible, and you’re
done.
Security issues may be the only ones that dictate that you use wired
connections, and those wired connections mean 10/100Base-T primarily, rather
than HomePlug. The data transmitted over HomePlug uses radio frequencies
similar to wireless and can leak off and be intercepted if an eavesdropper is
close enough (next door or the next apartment).
Those of you building a new home can, for relatively little money during
construction, have the builder run a cable bundle to every room. See the
upcoming section on Twisted Pair Ethernet Wiring for details on cable bundles
and why you may want one. You will also need to decide on a common location
where all the wires from the home congregate. That will be your future control
center, and you will be in great shape for all types of data and entertainment
networking if you install the cabling during construction.
Get construction advice and a thousand products to wire your new home
front to back and top to bottom at www.smarthome.com.
Wiring multiple rooms of an existing home can be a giant pain. The effort and
expertise needed to drill holes though ﬂoors and walls may be beyond what you
have. Businesses tend to have an easier time wiring between ofﬁces because
drop-panel ceilings give access to the spaces between walls. Many ofﬁce spaces
are refurbished between tenants, and building in your network connections
during remodeling will save you much time and effort.
My approach is to use HomePlug devices in residential situations to reach areas
wireless doesn’t reach easily, such as from the basement to the upstairs. But I
don’t have to support 100 Mbps transmissions across the network as you may
want to for business or hard-core game playing.
If you want a hard and fast rule on where you should and shouldn’t use wired
devices, security is the biggest reason for using wired devices. After that, you
can make the decision that works best for you.
Where to use wireless
If you’re a creature of habit and love wireless, you probably look to use wireless
connections before wired connections. That’s ﬁne with me.
Wireless device options give network designers, even those worried about
designing a home network, wonderful ﬂexibility. Here are some places you really
www.it-ebooks.info

370 Part IV ✦Linking Your Network Devices
want to use wireless:
✦In historical homes and buildings where drilling holes in the walls and
ﬂoors requires permission from oversight groups and diminishes the
historical ﬂavor of the site
✦When architectural barriers (glass bricks, a cement wall) make wiring
impractical
✦By your pool in the back yard
✦In your treehouse
The cost of adding wireless connections to an existing wired network does not
include construction and remodeling. That’s one of the great advantages to
wireless networking: you can easily add it to your existing wired network.
Twisted Pair (10 and 100Base-T)
Ethernet Wiring
For most of the network world, twisted pair wiring is Ethernet wiring. That’s
because 10Base-T became the standard for convenient Ethernet wiring before
the World Wide Web and Internet took off. Those of you who jumped into the
world of the Internet after about 1993 have no clue how much pain and
aggravation twisted pair wiring saves you when you run cabling anywhere.
First, however, you need to understand just a little about Ethernet and how it
works. There were many other types of network transmission systems in the
1980s and early 1990s, but Ethernet won over them all. Let me explain how and
why this happened.
A quick overview of Ethernet
Let me describe a problem much like that facing some people today: a new
employee was told to ﬁgure out a way for coworkers to share a new, expensive
laser printer. The difference? This was in 1972, for the Alto personal computer
developed by Xerox, for a newly developed one-page-per-minute laser printer.
Dr. Robert (Bob) Metcalfe, a newly minted Ph.D. from Harvard and MIT, went
to work. For the ﬁrst time ever, there were more than one or two huge computers
in the building. There were dozens of small computers that actually ﬁt on desks
(and used graphical screens with windows and a mouse, but that’s another book).
Ethernet developed over the next several years until by 1979 it ran at 10 Mbps
and many of the details were set and ready for commercial use. Here are two of
the details that matter today for your home or small business network:
✦Ethernet uses a shared-bus architecture. That means one electrical
circuit connects all the stations on the network, like one subway
connects all the stations.

Chapter 14 ✦Wired Connection Options 371
✦Ethernet uses a method of determining when data packets collide on the
network because two devices send a signal that overlaps called Carrier
Sense Multiple Access Collision Detection (CSMA/CD).
The ﬁrst bullet seems simple, but includes an important concept. Any device on
the network can “see” and send or receive packets to and from, any other
device. That means there is no central authority deciding which device can send
a packet at what time.
The second bullet seems complicated, but is actually simple. Because every
device on the network can hear every other device, they all listen for a period of
silence before sending a packet. Imagine a group meeting where people wait
until no one else is talking, to start talking themselves.
That process works great unless two people start talking at the same time.
Similarly, when two devices put data packets on the network at the same time,
they mash together and garble each other. In fact, that’s what happens in the
meeting, too. Just like the bored meeting attendees, the Ethernet devices wait a
random number of milliseconds before trying to “talk” on the network again.
As you’ll see in the wiring sections coming next, modern twisted pair Ethernet
does not look like a single network with all devices on the same string. But that’s
what it is, at least electrically.
Category 5 (CAT5) cabling
The term Category 5 (CAT5) relates to the grade of cabling and the speed rating
for that cable. CAT5 used to be the top end, but now you can get CAT5e and
CAT6. The ratings for the cable categories stack up this way:
✦CAT6: Highest rating available today. For 1000Base-T (Gigabit Ethernet)
and one day soon 10GB Ethernet over twisted pair.
✦CAT5, CAT5e: Up to 1000Base-T (Gigabit Ethernet).
✦CAT4: Non-Ethernet networks
✦CAT3: 10Base-T (10MB)
✦CAT2: Telephone voice lines, alarms
✦CAT1: Too low, not rated for anything.
Yes, you can technically use CAT3 cable for your 10Bast-T network, which may
be okay for your network device. Yet so many computers, wiring hubs, and
network appliances ship today with 100Base-T support you’d be running the risk
of network problems using such low rated cable. Stick with CAT5 at the
minimum, although CAT5e is now easier to ﬁnd and CAT6 prices are dropping to
almost the same level as CAT5e.
Premade cables are available from thousands of locations (even your local Radio
Shack). Figure 14-1 shows a good picture of a CAT5e cable from the people at
Smarthome, Inc., (www.smarthome.com).

Be sure and get a “snagless” or “booted” cable, which refers to a plastic hood
over the clip on the connector. If you have more than a couple of cables behind
your desk, pulling a cable out that doesn’t have a hood guarantees you will snag
it on something at least three times. Snagless cables are lifesavers when the
cables get thick.
There are eight wires in a CAT5 unshielded twisted pair (often shown as UTP)
cable arranged in four pairs. At least two pairs must be wired for 10/100Base-T to
function. The connector is called a registered jack, wiring pin diagram 45 (RJ45).
Your telephone cable is called an RJ11.
10/100Base-T cables come in a variety of lengths, generally from three feet to
300 feet already made with RJ45 connectors. Many standard premade lengths
are available, including 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 25, 50, 100, and 300 feet (although it’s
sometimes hard to ﬁnd a premade 300 foot cable). Boxes and rolls of raw cable
used for installation are available in 500’ and 1000’ lengths. Many suppliers make
custom lengths and apply the connectors for a small charge if you need a cable
that’s 128 feet long, for example.
Wiring your network using bulk cable is the cheapest alternative by far if you
don’t spend too much money on the installation (you do it yourself). For less
than a hundred dollars, you can buy 1,000 feet of cable and all the connectors
you need to support a small network in your home or ofﬁce. You will also learn
more than you wanted about crimp tools and how much your hand hurts after
crimping a few dozen connectors.

If you want to wire parts of your home for every conceivable current and future
digital entertainment connection need, check into bundled cables. These bulk
cable sets include multiple cable types within a sleeve to make running the
entire bundle much, much easier.
Smarthome offers two standard cable bundles they call SpeedWrap (other
vendors may have different names for a similar product). You can see in
Figure 14-2 that Smarthome include enough cable options to handle networking
today and in 10 years. These are perfect products to install in new home
construction if you want the ﬂexibility to put a media center in every room.

Think ﬁber optic cable is overkill? Maybe you’ll need it in 10 years? Think again,
because even consumer devices include ﬁber connections today. Check out the
back of high-end audio and video equipment and you will see a TOS-link
connector or two. That’s a ﬁber optic cable wrapped in black protective
insulation about the size of spaghetti with a small connector on each end.
Wiring hardware
If your home or ofﬁce arrangement looks like mine, where the feeds from the
cable and/or DSL service providers terminate on the wall beside a table with the

cable and/or DSL modem and wiring hubs, you don’t need to worry about wiring
hardware. If you want to provide connections to other rooms or ofﬁces,
however, you will need to run wires through the walls. When you reach the room
or ofﬁce to be connected, it’s considered bad form to just knock a hole in the
wall and leave the cables dangling out.
Network hardware suppliers got smart years ago and started collecting multiple
connectors on a single faceplate to save wall space and speed installation. That
type of thinking now must be used for home installations because we’re
determined to ﬁll every room (potentially) with ﬂoods of data, audio, and
video.
Products collecting telephone and network connections onto the same faceplate
appeared ﬁrst; then other connectors jumped into the mix. Figure 14-3 shows a
four-connector faceplate with room for telephone, network, and dual coax cable
connections.

RJ45 connectors are used to support multiextension phones, which some larger
homes have today. The phone connections, as well as distribution panels for the
various network and coax cables, congregate at one location in the basement,
garage, or utility closet. Some homes include a wiring closet, just like you ﬁnd in
ofﬁces, behind the wall supporting the home theater setup.

Chapter 14 ✦Wired Connection Options 375
When you use bulk wire for installation, whether SpeedWrap or the old-fashioned
kind, you must terminate that cable somewhere. A distribution panel collects
the lines run from locations around the home or ofﬁce and terminates each
cable at one point on the panel. Patch cables then connect the lines, which
must be connected on the panel, or link them to wiring hubs or routers.
Figure 14-4 shows a distribution panel from HomeTech Solutions
(www.hometech.com).
Figure 14-4: A FutureSmart (.com) distribution panel from Honeywell via HomeTech.
Can you put anything available to commercial wiring companies in your home?
Absolutely. You should check around with various home theater retailers in your
area for products and lists of certiﬁed installers. Many of the initiatives that
include network wiring around the home are driven by the home theater and
other entertainment industries.
Wiring hubs
Back in the pre-twisted pair wiring days, each network device connecting to an
Ethernet network had to “tap in” to the cable. The ﬁrst Ethernet cabling scheme
used “thick Ethernet,” a heavy yellow cable about the same size as a garden
hose. Connectors actually clamped on to the main cable. The most popular was
the vampire tap, which included teeth to hold on to the cable and a screw to drill

a sharp pin through the insulation to the copper center conductor. This was
obviously inspired by a medieval torture device.
Life in the network trenches improved greatly over the past 30 years so that now
you can use a neat little box with RJ45 female connectors ready for your RJ45
patch cables running from the network device to be added.
Wiring hubs replicate the same electrical environment as a piece of coax. Each
device connected to the hub sees all the packets and can send packets to all
other device. Figure 14-5 shows a small Netgear wiring hub for 10/100Base-T
devices.
Figure 14-5: A Netgear wiring hub.
There are three important parts to the wiring hub in Figure 14-5. First of all, you
can see the four RJ45 female connectors in the front panel. That allows four
network devices to connect to this device. You can see, barely, a button on the
far right of the hub that says Normal/Uplink. This supports a connection to
another wiring hub or router, which expects a crossover cable to keep the
transmit and receive pairs coordinated. In place of a crossover cable, you can
just push the button to make the hub cross the pins electrically. Much easier
than trying to remember which is a crossover cable, because they look the same
as a regular CAT5 cable but they don’t work in most situations. Aggravating, and
the switch on the hub eliminates some of that aggravation.
Tech Bits
A crossover cable changes the wire order to directly connect two work-
stations or two hubs. The crossover connects the transmit data to the
receive data pins on the connected device, such as you need connecting
two PCs without a hub in between.
You can also, somewhat, see the lights on the left side of the hub. These lights
show when the hub has power (the power connection is in the back) and when
ports are in use. Lights on the plugs themselves light up when connected to a
powered device and ﬂicker as data goes through them.
There are no smarts in a hub, except that they keep the 10 Mbps connections on
a separate data path inside the hub from the 100 Mbps connections. This keeps
the 100 Mbps devices connected to the hub from monopolizing the bandwidth
from the 10 Mbps devices.
Hubs come with 4, 8, 16, and 24 ports. When you see more than 24 ports, or the
price seems oddly high, you have stumbled upon a switch rather than a hub.

Chapter 14 ✦Wired Connection Options 377
The electronics controlling the network switching makes them much more
expensive than unintelligent hubs.
Wiring switches
Where a hub electrically replaces a coax bus-type network, a switch isolates
each connection from the others so that connection has the full bandwidth
available to the devices on that switch port. Usually the switches run at
100 Mbps but support 10 Mbps connections. You don’t need switches for a small
network, but they have become so inexpensive many router makers use them
rather than hubs.
Network designers connect hubs to switches, so the devices connected to the
hub have the full 100 Mbps bandwidth available without sharing any of the
bandwidth with other devices plugged into the switch. When a packet on
the hub needs to go to a device not on the hub, the switch takes the packet and
then connects it to all the other devices on all other switch ports.
Switches look almost exactly like hubs because the only difference between the
two is the electronics to isolate each connection as a separate network.
Figure 14-6 shows a Linksys switch about the same size as the Netgear hub
shown earlier.
Figure 14-6: A Linksys ﬁve port switch for home and small ofﬁce use.
Unlike the Netgear hub, the Linksys puts its RJ45 connectors in the back. This
has become a popular option for many manufacturers so that all the
connections and messy wires go in the back rather than the front. This leaves

the front panel free for advertising and, oh yes, information about which ports
are used and how busy they are.
Switches come most often in 4,8,16,32, and 48 port models. Even Gigabit
switches, supporting 1000Base-T (Gigabit Ethernet) are now affordable. Perhaps
not necessary for your home network, they have great value in larger companies
where a server attached to each Gigabit port has maximum throughput available
to the network.
Wiring devices in routers
The joy of electronics is the constant size reduction of components necessary to
perform certain functions. One great example of this is the huge number of
available cable/DSL broadband routers with wiring hubs or switches built right
in. Many also have wireless connections built in as well.
Many people with a home broadband connection will ﬁnd this type of
combination device does all they need. They run a short CAT5 patch cable from
the router/hub/switch/wireless device to their cable/DSL modem to establish
their link to their broadband service provider. Then they run another CAT5
patch cable to their desktop system right next to the router, and use the wireless
connection to handle their laptop when they’re lounging by their Olympic size
pool overlooking their acreage and polo pony barn, or when they’re sitting on
the couch in the den watching TV while checking e-mail.
The Netgear WGT624 108 Mbps Wireless Firewall Router in Figure 14-7 is fast, easy
to manage, and about the size of a paperback book. The lights, from left to right,
are power (on) Internet (your cable/DSL modem connection), wireless (the little
ice cream cone radiating outwards) and the four LAN connections (1 and 3 are lit
to show they are connected to at least one working network device). The wireless
light blinks on and off and the LAN connections blink when they have trafﬁc.

business with 20 or 25 people. You won’t ﬁnd, with any of today’s products, that
your router is your network bottleneck. Save that blame for your broadband
service provider, because they are the weakest link in the performance chain.
HomePlug: Networking through
Your Power Outlets
Walk into a typical but empty home as if it was a foreign world and guess how
the occupants communicate. Phone jacks come to mind, and there are phone
jacks in several rooms. Water? Only a few places in the house. Gas? The lines
only go to the kitchen and the garage for the water heater. Heating and air
conditioning vents? They go to every room, which is a good sign.
Electrical plugs? Hey, they’re all over the place and in every room. Many rooms,
especially in homes built in the last 20 years or so, have at least one plug on
every wall. If I were doing a survey for the StarGate team, I’d bet the power plugs
were critical to all sorts of life activities, including communications.
Guess what? Those little plugs are valuable to communications. The world of
HomePlug vendors wants you to take a close look at how many ways they can
help you network your home or small business.
You might think this was one of those head-slap moments where something easy
had been overlooked. Unfortunately, running high-speed data services over
electrical circuits is not easy. Problems with interference from other things
plugged in, such as motors that introduce an enormous amount of noise into the
circuits, stymied vendors for years. Circuit breakers used to cut a huge chunk of
the signal every time one was in the direct path between devices.
What made HomePlug possible, oddly enough, were all the advances made in
wireless and DSL technologies. By applying things learned from developing
those methods of communications, the HomePlug vendors ﬁnally made reliable
networking a reality through the humble electrical plug hiding under your desk
and behind your dresser.
HomePlug overview
You might want to think of HomePlug devices as a translator, or bridge. They
translate Ethernet signals from 10/100Base-T twisted pair wiring into signals that
the electrical circuits can transport. HomePlug devices turn your electrical wires
into a new physical media that Ethernet can traverse.
Ofﬁcial HomePlug speed is 14 Mbps, so if you get half that on a good day count
yourself lucky. In fact, half of any Mbps rated speed using TCP/IP at the client
(such as a computer on a local network) tops out as the best possible realistic
speed you will receive, so I’m not picking on HomePlug. Figure 14-8 shows the
best place to go and get information on the world of HomePlug.

Figure 14-8: The Web home of the ofﬁcial HomePlug Powerline Alliance.
If you remember way back in the DSL section, the transmission technique used
is Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). This is also used by
television signals, which is why I say that HomePlug designers looked around
and choose reliable, proven ways to send Ethernet over power lines. To handle
the odd nature of running over 120 volts of AC, HomePlug uses burst mode
transmissions and adds some other data transmission techniques.
Tech Bits
You MUST plug all HomePlug equipment directly into the wall plug. Do
not use an extension cord or plug strip of any kind. The only way for the
HomePlug devices to work is to be connected directly to the home or
ofﬁce wiring.
HomePlug devices connect to personal computers via Ethernet patch cables or
USB connections. When using Ethernet, most HomePlug devices appear as a
normal Ethernet connection to computers and other network devices. The USB
connections need some type of driver (in almost every case) to connect the
computer to the HomePlug network. CDs with appropriate drivers accompany
the HomePlug hardware.
The majority of HomePlug devices look like one-port wiring hubs: one Ethernet
cable in on one side, one power line going out from the other side. Some of the
newer models look like battery-eliminators (wall warts) that plug directly into
the power line and have a plug in the housing for your Ethernet (or USB) cable.

All the early HomePlug units looked more or less like the Linksys in Figure 14-9.
Some are plastic, like the Linksys, and some are metal. But second versions got
small as the market increased, manufacturing volume picked up, and new
components shrank and designers made custom chips that incorporated the
functions of several earlier chips, reducing the size of the electronics.
The results of these advances mean smaller units provide more ﬂexible
mounting options. One of the later entrants into the market, Netgear, now sells a
very sleek and small wall-mounted HomePlug unit. Take a look at the wall-wart

382 Part IV ✦Linking Your Network Devices
Crowded ofﬁce ﬂoors behind desks, where cables come from all directions and
emulate spaghetti, will have one less device to entangle. Sure you must run a
cable to this, but at least the cable won’t terminate somewhere on the ﬂoor into
a box half-hidden by other cables. You do have to give up a real wall socket,
sometimes a precious commodity, but plug strips are cheap even if you do the
right thing and buy one with surge protection. Plug that into the other wall
socket and you’re in business again.
Neighbors, at least those within about 900 feet and within the same electrical
wiring from the distribution transformer, will see your signals. Most HomePlug
devices now offer 56-bit encryption. This level won’t stop determined hackers,
but will stop your neighbors from reading the shared ﬁles on your network.
That assumes, however, that you have turned the encryption on by putting
the same password in all your connected HomePlug units. And I always
recommend good passwords for all shared network resources, HomePlug
passwords or not.
HomePlug and Ethernet
HomePlug devices aspire to be invisible, if not physically, at least electronically.
When your computer connects to a HomePlug unit instead of a wiring hub,
router, or switch, your computer should never know the difference.
For the most part, HomePlug works invisibly. The primary network design
shown by most HomePlug vendors is one device at your router by your
cable/DSL modem, and a second device at a convenient location for another
computer, such as a child’s room or the den. In fact, some early products only
worked with two HomePlug devices on the network. Now you can have up to 16
HomePlug devices in one network.
Notice that in Figures 14-9 and 14-10, both products called themselves bridges.
That’s in keeping with the idea that the HomePlug device “bridges” your
Ethernet network over the electrical wiring and delivers your packets back to
your Ethernet network as if nothing happened. You know, just like a bridge over
a river connects the road on either side. Sometimes electronic nomenclature
steals directly from the real world, and this is one of those times.
Interference does cause problems to HomePlug devices. Every time an electrical
motor starts up, it inserts an enormous amount of noise on the electrical
line. Ever turned on a vacuum and thought the lights dimmed for a second? They
did, because the vacuum noise on the line disrupted the electrical ﬂow at
startup and the new load of the vacuum motor dragged down the voltage as
well.
HomePlug uses spread spectrum frequencies to handle interference, just like
wireless Ethernet in the next chapter. When something new adds to the noise on
the electrical circuits, the HomePlug devices hop around the frequencies looking
for clear frequencies to use. That search and hop disrupts data transmission
speed.

A Web site with many HomePlug products gathered together for com-
parison and online sale is www.HomePlugs.net.
Fewer available frequencies means slower transmissions. HomePlug is rate
adaptive, another term for the process of looking around to ﬁnd new
transmission frequencies when one disappears because of interference. But one
of the ways to ﬁnd clear space on the circuit is to lower the data transmission
speed.
HomePlug security and compatibility
There isn’t much to HomePlug security, to tell you the truth. The standard calls
for 56-bit encryption between HomePlug units. This isn’t much, honestly, but on
the other hand your signals don’t travel as far or lend themselves to
eavesdropping as much as wireless signals do.
56-bit encryption can be broken but the hackers must still gather many of your
transmissions, analyze the patterns, and start churning through possible keys.
This takes time, and the hackers must do this while physically plugged in to
electrical wiring shared by your home or ofﬁce.
Part of the shortcut to a security challenge for an outsider is to guess your
password outright, without having to analyze and churn. How do they do this?
By guessing your password based on the default passwords supplied by
vendors. Look at the default password for a Siemens 2524 in Figure 14-11.
Figure 14-11: Setup for HomePlug security doesn’t take much.
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
384 Part IV ✦Linking Your Network Devices
This password is the name of the product line. Why do vendors do this? For
compatibility’s sake. If you buy your HomePlug devices from the same vendor,
they will automatically have the same password and all will be well. They will
work together and have some level of security. If you mix products from multiple
vendors, one of two things will happen:
✦The passwords won’t match so the units won’t communicate.
✦The units will communicate because security won’t be engaged.
Don’t be too hard on HomePlug vendors, because all manufacturers with secure
products walk the line between enforcing strong security or making life a bit
easier for their customers. Did you know that some reports show that fully one
third of all safes installed in the United States still have the default combination
assigned by their maker? If people buying a safe to protect expensive valuables
don’t bother to change the “password” for their safe, how can we blame home
users who don’t change their HomePlug passwords to protect digital photos of
Grandma’s birthday?
Security experts admit that appropriate security for the situation doesn’t always
look like much security at all. If you see a state of the art car alarm on a brand
new Porsche, you think that’s appropriate. If you see one on a 1994 Ford Tempo
with a crumpled rear end, bald tires, smoking engine, and wrong-colored hood
from a junkyard, you would laugh.
The Siemens 2524 in Figure 14-11 is the unit that includes wireless (802.11b at 11
Mbps max speed), HomePlug, four local 10/100Base-T twisted pair Ethernet
connections, and a ﬁrewall and other security. Every possible way to connect
comes in that single cable/DSL router. I expect them to upgrade the unit for
faster wireless speeds soon, if they haven’t by the time you read this.
If you don’t recognize the Siemens name, don’t feel bad. They take a lower proﬁle
than most huge global conglomerates, but you probably have some of their
products. The Yahoo SBC DSL modem I have is a SpeedStream 5100 from
Efﬁcient Networks. Recognize the SpeedStream name? Siemens owns Efﬁcient
Networks and makes deals with many of the cable and DSL service providers to
use their cable and DSL modems.
Every HomePlug device I have examined requires a Windows PC of some ﬂavor
to run conﬁguration programs (if there are any). Sometimes, as with the Siemens
Web-based conﬁguration shown in Figure 14-11, all management occurs through
browsers. Any browser will work, although a few vendors still (foolishly) write
pop-up windows and controls that work with only Microsoft’s Internet
Explorer.
After conﬁguration, HomePlug devices take any and all Ethernet signals from any
network device and bridge them to your power line “network” for transmission.
Why is this important? Because all network devices are compatible with
conﬁgured HomePlug devices, which provides great ﬂexibility in arranging your
network to your home or ofﬁce.

HomePlug and wireless
You can connect any wireless router or access point into a HomePlug connection
and extend the length of your wireless reach. Alternately, you can bypass
problem areas for wireless connections, such as thick walls that cut the signal
down too much. Or you can put access points on different sides of your home or
ofﬁce, using the HomePlug devices to link wireless-enabled areas.
I’m amazed how often this combination of HomePlug and wireless works to solve
aggravating network problems. I’m surprised at how often smart people never
consider using the two technologies together.
Perhaps “surprise” is too strong a word. Many people know and use wireless
products, but HomePlug hasn’t reached the same market awareness as wireless.
All the wireless products, especially in new laptops and PDAs, seem cool and
futuristic and high tech. Power plugs, around for more than a hundred years,
seem pretty dull and low tech by comparison.
Next time you face a problem with wireless reach, try this:
✦Connect a HomePlug device to your primary router. That may be your
wireless router plugged in to your cable/DSL modem or a separate unit.
✦Connect a second HomePlug device to your power socket in the area out
of wireless reach.
✦Connect a wireless access point to that second HomePlug device.
✦Verify your wireless device(s) in the remote area can communicate with
your access point.
✦Verify your remote wireless device(s) now reach your router and the rest
of your network connected to the ﬁrst HomePlug device.
Will you be able to solve every aggravating wireless problem by adding distance
with a pair of HomePlug devices? Not every problem, no, but you will be
surprised at how often a little more distance ﬁxes a wireless hiccup. And the
HomePlug devices will extend your wireless reach as far as 300 meters (900 feet
or so).
HomePlug pros and cons
Time to wrap up the HomePlug story into a simple pros and cons section.
Unfortunately, the answer won’t be simple and clear cut. Every network
installation is different, and your network situation is no exception to that rule.
But I can provide what I see are the strong and weak points for HomePlug
inclusion in your network design.

✦Slower than other wired network communication options
✦Electrical interference slows HomePlug data transmissions
✦Can’t plug in to a surge protector or plug strip
On balance, I believe HomePlug products work reliably and provide an
inexpensive option for connecting devices.

quently Asked Questions is at www.asokausa.com/support/faq.php.
HomePNA: Networking through
Your Telephone Line
Before the HomePlug folks got their act together, the Home Phoneline
Networking Alliance took a bite of the apple. Designed like DSL to run over
existing phone lines, but this time inside the home or ofﬁce, the HomePNA group
released its 1.0 speciﬁcations in the fall of 1998.
No earthshaking accompanied the announcement for a 1 Mbps transfer rate over
standard residential telephone lines. Unfortunately for the HomePNA,
earthshaking acceptance continues to elude them.
Why has HomePNA not done as well as HomePlug? Mostly, I believe, because
of wireless. Many, many vendors are big in the wireless market, public
acceptance runs higher every day, and speeds for wireless devices continue to
increase.
See for yourself what the HomePNA group has to say (www.homepna.org).
Also check out the friends of the HomePNA at the self-described “Source For
Home Phoneline Networking Links And Information” at www.homepna.com.
Do I think HomePNA is a good idea? After all, they now have version 2.0 products
available that run at 10 Mbps, giving a maximum throughput of roughly 5 Mbps,
which compares favorably with HomePlug. And, of course, 5 Mbps far outspeeds
any broadband service provider’s feed to any of us in the real world.

Chapter 14 ✦Wired Connection Options 387
Yes, HomePNA is a good idea, but I’m afraid the window may be closing. I
suggest you look to HomePlug for the following reasons:
✦More vendors make HomePlug products.
✦There are 45 plugs in an average U.S. home but only ﬁve phone
connections.
✦Three major online vendors I checked had no HomePNA products listed.
✦HomePNA released 3.0 speciﬁcations, including speeds up to 128 Mbps
(theoretical) in mid-2003 but no products are listed on their Web site as of
Spring 2004, 9 months later.
Putting network connections where the phone plugs are seems to make sense
when you ﬁrst look at it. My home builder put a phone connection in the master
bathroom, but I don’t consider that a good location for a network device. Even
Microsoft gave up the idea (search for Microsoft and public bathroom Internet
connections for what may, or may not, have been a great April Fools joke) of
computers in bathrooms.
Telephone installers use the cheapest and lowest grade wire available, CAT2.
Remember the chart showing CAT5 as the minimum standard for twisted pair
Ethernet, and how CAT5e and CAT6 were taking over the market? There is no
CAT1, making CAT2 the lowest grade of data cabling possible.
If you get a good deal on HomePNA products and you need a limited number
connections that won’t conceivably increase in the mid to long term, go for it. If
those conditions vary even a little, stick with HomePlug and wireless. Most
analysts started saying in early 2003 that HomePNA lost the marketing battle.
Although I’m not a fan of most analysts, they may have made the right choice
here.
Of course, nothing says that HomePlug will be able to survive the increased
reach of wireless. I may have to revise this book in a year and say that HomePlug
is a good choice only if you get a great deal and don’t plan any expansion. Time
will tell.
Networking through Your Cable Wires
A fairly new company recently announced a way to network Ethernet through
the majority of U.S, homes: coax cable. The same cable that feeds your cable TV
or maybe cable modem can transfer Ethernet. Rather than HomePlug or
HomePNA I guess this could be labeled HomeCOAX.
Coaxsys (www.coaxsys.com) makes an Ethernet bridge for coax. You put their
hub at the entrance of the coax to your home or ofﬁce, then put connect to other
coax lines from that hub. Figure 14-12 shows the Coaxsys Web site and big pitch.
I haven’t seen any of these products in action yet, so I can’t offer a review. The
company makes a good point that coax cables tend to congregate at the TV, so
running multimedia over these wires makes sense. It claims that its Pure Speed

Figure 14-12: A new contender in the home networking market.
equipment runs at 100 Mbps and supports 10/100 Mbps Ethernet connections
with no problems.
Coax in the home certainly has the most bandwidth available of any other cable
type. There won’t be the interference problems experienced by HomePlug or
wireless, either. But I remain unconvinced because I have yet to see it personally
and judge the added value above standard data networking cables and
connections.
Today, I can’t say Yea or Nay. Check out www.BroadbandBible.com for
updates as I see this stuff in action.
Summary
Many pages and several new wired networking technologies later, the summary
is that twisted pair Ethernet offers the best option for most people. If, however,
you don’t want to, or can’t, run CAT5 cabling through your home or ofﬁce, wired
alternatives exist.
I have been lucky using HomePlug devices to augment 10/100Base-T twisted pair
Ethernet and wireless connections. When you get to a barrier, and wireless
doesn’t work and there’s no easy way to run a cable, check back to the
HomePlug section and see if something catches your eye. You may solve a
problem without much effort or much money. That’s always a win–win situation.

n the last chapter we covered wires, so this chapter
covers nonwires, or wireless. Plenty of folks love the
wireless connections on their networks, and plenty more
folks can beneﬁt from understanding how to construct a
network with at least some wireless components.
Yet just like the different types of wires discussed in the
previous chapter, wireless products have a variety of
standards, applications, strengths, and weaknesses.
Knowing which wireless products best ﬁt your network
situation will mean smoother installation, increased
security, and more productivity when the network is up
and running.
Wireless Advantages Inside
Your Building
All during the last chapter you heard about easier ways
to run wires around your home or ofﬁce. What if you
didn’t have any wires to run anywhere? What if
everything worked as easily as turning on your radio to
hear music?
That’s where everyone in the technology business wants
to get to, I guarantee you. After all, most developers
leave home in the morning by turning a key in their car’s
ignition without any clue how to tweak, adjust, or
conﬁgure anything in their car except the radio. And
how wonderful is the radio? Turn it on and you get
music, anywhere you drive. Smaller ones ﬁt into your
pocket and give you music, news, weather, and sports
without a single wire to trip over.

Yes, wireless advantages are marvelous for many users, but sometimes people
get a little carried away. They tell you how wonderful it is that they can put a
wireless access point at the top of their warehouse ceiling and network the
entire place. But did they mention having to plug that wireless access point into
a power outlet?
Okay, the wireless access point depends on (power line) wires. But the
connections between that device and the network clients use no wires
whatsoever. Go to a warehouse sometime and look at a forklift. Know what you’ll
probably see? A wireless terminal on the forklift talking to the network and an
inventory application somewhere telling the forklift driver where to ﬁnd the next
product to move to the shipping dock.
The previous chapter mentioned the advantages for wireless connections in
buildings with barriers to new wire installations, such as historically signiﬁcant
sites. Architectural barriers create problems as well. The vaulted atrium
between wings of a building, for example, may require hundreds of feet of
10/100Base-T twisted pair Ethernet to reach around the opening. That may all be
eliminated by using wireless connections.
Someday, my friend Art will no longer be able to ask his “horseless carriage”
question. When did we stop calling a car a horseless carriage, or a network
without wires a wireless network? When will we stop distinguishing between a
network connection over copper and one over radio waves? When will we just
call it all networking and not worry about the details anymore?
Sorry, Art, but I think that’s a few more years away. However, many home and
small business users can approach their network design with the ﬂexibility and
mobility wireless networking provides. When wireless won’t work, then you can
pull out the HomePlug or CAT-5 cable and go back to copper.
Wireless Standards Overview
Standards drive the computer business, and today, the big companies drive the
standards. That works to your beneﬁt, however, as companies can “beat” the
standards products out the door with products that are technically proprietary
but usually pretty close to the upcoming standard.
The wireless world follows this model more than many areas in the technology
world. Not only do companies have to work with each other to develop the
standards, they have to coordinate with governments about which radio
frequencies are available. In the United States, there have been several
“spectrum auctions” for the cellular phone world. It hasn’t come to that for
wireless networking yet, but the scramble for “licensed” and “unlicensed”
spectrum (range of radio frequencies) can get pretty intense at times.
Developing, coordinating, and managing the standards for most wireless
networking products fall into the domain of the Institute of Electronics
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 15 ✦Wireless Connection Options 391
and Electrical Engineers, Inc., (IEEE www.ieee.org). All the wireless
products you can now buy so cheaply at your local retailer or online were
created, developed, and manufactured thanks to the work of the IEEE. Figure 15-1
shows the IEEE Web site for the 802 network family: Ethernet, Token Ring,
Wireless LANs.
Figure 15-1: The group that makes it possible for your laptop to connect to the
Internet in Starbucks.
The standards for wireless networking don’t seem to make chronological sense,
because you would expect the slowest technology to be labeled earlier than a
faster technology. But all is never what it seems in the world of government
bureaucracy and technology.
Frequencies, controlled by governments, can be a crowded mess at times. The
world set aside the Industrial, Scientiﬁc, and Medical (ISM) band for general,
nonlicensed use.
Why are wireless network connections subject to interference in the normal
home? Because spread spectrum applications (like 802.11) can broadcast with
only 1watt of power, but microwave ovens can use up to 900 watts because
they’re supposed to focus their broadcasts (but some leak). So when you take a
popcorn break, don’t get mad if your network slows to a crawl while the
microwave works its popcorn magic.

802.11b
Those of you who looked at the table of contents wonder why I’m not starting
with the 802.11a standard. After all, A comes before B in most alphabets.
But not in all technical alphabets. Letters were assigned based on when the
proposal delivery to the working groups of the IEEE 802.x committees. A group
deﬁned and delivered a proposal for 802.11a (54 Mbps throughput using
frequencies in the 5 GHz range) ﬁrst, so they got the “a” designation.
A second group appeared with another proposal using frequencies in the 2.4 GHz
range with a maximum throughput of 11 Mbps. They got the “b” designation.
Then the 802.11b folks got their standard details worked out sooner and got
products to market. Slower throughput leaves more margin for error, and the
2.4 GHz frequency range provides greater connection distance than the 802.11a
standard. The 802.11b folks became the embodiment of wireless local area
networks as far as most people were concerned.
Check out the details for 802.11b in Table 15-1.

For most people, 802.11b is what they think of when they think of wireless
networking, even if they don’t know it. Companies have provided equipment
using 802.11b technology for several years, and the prices have dropped to
downright cheap in many cases for 802.11b products.
Tech Bits
Wireless fans may wonder what happened to Bluetooth, the standard for
short range connections that was going to eliminate cables around your
desk? Sorry, but you’ll likely see Bluetooth connecting only cell phones on
your belt to the headphone wrapped around your ear. However, Personal
Area Networks (PAN) may revive the standard and put more Bluetooth
products on the shelves.

Chapter 15 ✦Wireless Connection Options 393
Now that 802.11b deﬁnes the low end of wireless network speeds, the vendors
focus on higher speed equipment (802.11g mostly) and present 802.11b as the
entry level networking. If entry level to the vendors means faster than any
broadband connection from a service provider to your location, take advantage
of that. The throughput for 802.11b in the real world maxes out around 5–6 Mbps,
but many of us only dream of a broadband connection over 1 Mbps.
Tech Bits
802.11b signal encoding technology uses only Direct Sequence Spread
Spectrum (DSSS). This technique provides increased resistance to inter-
ference.
Intel’s Centrino chipset uses 802.11b. Many criticized Intel for building 802.11b
equipment into the world of laptops right before 802.11a and 802.11g become
commercially viable. Why not wait, the critics asked, and get something just
much faster?
In technology, you can make that same argument each and every day about each
and every advance. I believe Intel did a pretty good job cementing the bottom
end of wireless networking using 802.11b as its foundation. After all, many laptop
hard drives can’t stream data much faster than the maximum throughput they
will receive from an excellent 802.11b connection. Making laptop customers (and
by extension PDA users and other wireless network devices) expect at least a
promised 11 Mbps raises the bar for wireless networking far higher than it’s
been raised before. Good for Intel.
802.11a
First to the standards ﬁnish line, barely, but way behind the race to market.
802.11a let 802.11b get a major head start before entering the race. Worse, the
difference in frequency range (5 GHz rather than the 2.4 GHz used by 802.11b)
made early systems incompatible with existing equipment. Not a debut meant
for future fame as a Harvard Business School successful case study.
The higher speeds in 802.11a come at the expense of distance. On the surface, it
looks like a good trade, because you cut your distance about in half but get ﬁve
times the bandwidth (theoretically). Real-life speeds don’t ever come to more
than half the promised levels, but you can deﬁnitely tell the improvement moving
from an 802.11b connection to an 802.11a link using the same devices in a test.
Check out the details for 802.11a in Table 15-2.

Advantages
Higher speed than 802.11b, far less frequency congestion

Disadvantages
Not compatible with 802.11b or g, shorter range, least common,
more expensive wireless option. Coming 5.8 GHz cordless phones
may cause interference
802.11a deserves better than it will get, no doubt, but you and I can’t help that.
The increased speed makes wireless networking useful for streaming audio and
video applications, but the short range will be a problem.
There are fewer 802.11a devices for sale, by far, than 802.11b. That’s not
surprising, because 802.11b came to market ﬁrst. But there are starting to be
more 802.11g devices than 802.11a devices. That is a problem for 802.11a fans,
because they will lose the distance comparison as well as price comparison with
802.11g products. The fact that 802.11a products don’t connect to 802.11b or
802.11g devices means they will gradually disappear.
Tech Bits
802.11a signal encoding technology uses only Orthogonal Frequency
Division Multiplexing (OFDM). This technique transmits on multiple fre-
quencies concurrently to reduce crosstalk and interference.
If you have 802.11a devices already, don’t throw them out. Many users prefer
wireless connections even when devices are within easy reach of 10/100Base-T
patch cables to keep down the clutter. Ofﬁces with several 802.11a devices will
continue to work ﬁne, but try and use the 802.11a devices in smaller, contained
areas to maximize their value and minimize their shortcomings.
Locations with high interference in the 2.4 GHz band, such as a microwave and
cordless phone testing center (it could happen) will be glad to have 802.11a as
an option. Pick the right tool for the right job and success comes easily. It’s when
you try and force an 802.11a round device into a square 802.11b or 802.11g hole
that you create problems for yourself.
802.11g
Now this is what you’ve been waiting for: compatible with the earlier 802.11b
equipment, yet ﬁve times faster at 54 Mbps versus 11 Mbps for 802.11b (all
numbers theoretical rather than real world). 802.11g will be the dominant
base standard for home and small business use for the next few years until
802.11n arrives. The prices for “g” are higher than for “b” but that difference
will narrow as more vendors get into the business of making “g” products.
802.11a prices are highest, 802.11g products are in the middle, and 802.11b
prices are the lowest.

Chapter 15 ✦Wireless Connection Options 395
802.11g takes a dual approach to frequency management. Under 20 Mbps, it uses
the same techniques as 802.11b, which is why it’s compatible to the earlier
standard. Over 20 Mbps, it uses the same technology as does 802.11a. Of course,
throughput always depends on signal strength (meaning distance) so an 802.11g
connection can drop to slower speeds (11 Mbps range) yet still provide decent
network throughput.
Check out the details for 802.11g in Table 15-3.

Frequency Range

places are adding 802.11g support
Advantages
Compatible with 802.11b equipment but faster because of
different signal encoding technologies at high data rates
Disadvantages
Frequency range competes with microwave ovens, cordless
phones, medical equipment, Bluetooth devices, and others
Distance for 802.11g makes a big difference in throughput. If you stretch your
luck (and distance) or go through a wall or two, your standard 802.11g product
will essentially become an 802.11b product.
Tech Bits
802.11g signal encoding technology uses Direct Sequence Spread Spec-
trum (DSSS) below 20 Mbps but Orthogonal Frequency Division Multi-
plexing (OFDM) for higher speeds, like 802.11a.
Although 802.11g uses the same type of frequency encoding at higher speeds as
802.11a uses, the two standards are not compatible. The frequency ranges differ,
and 802.11g vendors seem inclined to push their combination 802.11 “b and g”
products rather than some of their earlier 802.11 “a and b” combination
products.
That said, the Linksys people have introduced the WRT55AG Dual-Band Wireless
A+G Broadband Router. Although the name may be long, the product is pretty
small and includes all three 802.11 network standards in one small box.
Figure 15-2 shows the WRT55AG.
When one company makes a product like this, others usually follow. If you have
a mixed bag of 802.11a and 802.11b products, keep an eye on your favorite
vendor and see if they come up with a combination router like this one from
Linksys, for example, the D-Link AirXpert DI-774 wireless router.

802.11g nonstandard enhancements
People are never satisﬁed. Give them a fast network and they want a faster one.
That’s the drive behind 802.11g vendors who are goosing the speeds using a
variety of nonstandard techniques.
The value of standards becomes clear when you try and mix products from
various vendors. After a couple of generations of 802.11b products, I could
ﬁnally mix and match products and expect them to work. That’s with a single
deﬁned standard, yet early products, which supposedly followed the standard,
wouldn’t work together.
When you get away from standards, you lock yourself into a single vendor. That
may be ﬁne in your situation, and many home and small ofﬁce users won’t need
more than the two or three stations they install for their initial network. And if
you buy from one of the major vendors, you stand a pretty good chance of being
able to ﬁnd additional compatible units at a later time anyway.
It didn’t take long for vendors with 54 Mbps 802.11g products to realize a great
truth in consumer behavior: users want their network to run faster. Because
sales jumped with the advertised speed bump from 11 Mbps to 54 Mbps, some
wondered how high would they jump if it said “108 Mbps∗” on the box. The ∗
would refer the users to ﬁne print, hopefully not read until after the product was
purchased, that included all the various disclaimers.

Chapter 15 ✦Wireless Connection Options 397
Methods used to increase speeds
Different vendors obviously use different methods to ratchet up their 802.11g
speed ratings. On top of this, the three vendors of core chips driving the 802.11g
products have built-in limitations that must be accommodated if the products
are to work correctly.
Here are the most common methods used to boost speeds. Your favorite vendor
may use a different name for one or more of these techniques, but you should be
able to ﬁgure out their methods.
✦Channel bonding: This is a popular speed-boost method at the root of
some vendor mudslinging. Sometimes called “multi-channel bonding” or
“double-channel bonding,” this method uses two of the wireless channels
available and “bonds” them together. The device treats the bandwidth of
the combined channels as if they were one larger channel. This works
best in networks in which all devices use 802.11g, because packets from a
single-channel device can cause the router to revert to single-channel
mode. Effective distances are increased, according to most vendors and
some independent tests. That alone may make this technique (or trick,
depending on your viewpoint) worthwhile.
✦Packet bursting: Based on the draft standard (the working groups have a
fair amount of work done but all the details are not yet ﬁnished and
approved) of 802.11e for Quality of Service (QoS), packet bursting crams
more data in each packet and sends more packets at a time than usual.
When fully deﬁned, this technique should keep 802.11g streams fast while
still accommodating 80.211b trafﬁc on the same network.
✦Fast frames: This technique increased data throughput from packet
bursting by putting more than one data packet into a data frame. This
delivers more data per data frame header (addressing and other details),
increasing throughput. Also from the 802.11e Quality of Service work, this
technique will fall back to normal packet content speciﬁcations when
communicating with a node that does not support fast frames.
✦Hardware compression and decompression: Just like popular Zip ﬁle
programs (PKZip and WinZip, for example) compress ﬁles before storage,
this new technique compresses the data packets before transport over
the wireless network. Hardware chips in both ends perform the
compression and decompression, speeding the process to make it
possible in real time.
✦Select mode or mixed mode: When all network devices use the same
performance enhancing techniques, stations will no longer have to watch
each packet to see whether it must be handled by gearing down to a
lower speed. Mixed mode supports nonturbo-charged devices, and select
or turbo mode works only when each device improves performance the
same, nonstandard way.
Anytime vendors stroll off the standards path to make their own modiﬁcations
to “improve” the standard, compatibility with other vendors goes out the

window. Some pundits say no vendors should ever deviate from formal, adopted
standards. Good luck.
Check out Netgear’s white paper on their Super G wireless technology at
www.netgear.com/pdf_docs/108_Mbps_Super_G_WhitePaper.pdf
and
the

announcement

?prid=123.
People aren’t built to follow rules blindly when they can tweak those rules and
give themselves an advantage. Besides, would you rather vendors respond to
customer complaints to add new features to their products, or just wait for the
standards committee to get around to it? I prefer letting the people selling and
supporting real live customers help design the features of the next network.
After all, don’t you want real customers to have some input?
Interference issues
Claims and counter-claims between vendors are nothing new, and the world of
wireless turbo networks has not escaped this drama. Some people (vendors)
have come forward and accused other vendors of causing enormous amounts of
interference because of the way they handle channel bonding.
The best explanations I can ﬁnd, and my own testing, show the following:
✦Channel bonding causes interference in “turbo” 802.11g mode near a
standard 802.11g network.
✦Separating network devices by 50 feet considerably lessens the
interference problems.
✦A neighbor using an enhanced 802.11g network in the next house will be
hard pressed to interfere with your network because of the distance and
two exterior walls. If you live in an apartment and share a wall with this
other network, you might have some issues.
✦Not all manufacturers interfere with each other, even at relatively close
range.
✦These issues appear with ﬁrst versions of the enhancement software and
hardware. By the second generation, interference problems are limited to
devices uncomfortably close to each other.
One site doing some testing recorded usable throughput at almost 300 feet
because of the new 802.11g enhancements. That’s a beneﬁt everyone will enjoy.
Improvements are reducing the signal drop as it goes through walls as well.
Soon, wireless will be the network of choice for most people.
Wi-Fi
Technically, this is the same 802.11b discussed at the beginning of this section.
However, the branding and marketing, along with Intel’s Centrino chip set
advertisements, has made Wi-Fi bigger than 802.11b in several ways.

Chapter 15 ✦Wireless Connection Options 399
Coming from marketing types rather than a standards committee, the name Wi-Fi
stands for “wireless ﬁdelity.” Not sure why they picked ﬁdelity, a term associated
with music or monogamy, but they did. The Web home page for the Wi-Fi
Alliance is at www.wi-ﬁ.com.
Now the push from marketing types tries to make Wi-Fi mean any wireless
product. Hard to demand the nickname remain tagged to a single type of wireless
connection when it’s all marketing hype anyway. Rather than referring to 802.11b
as in the beginning, now the Wi-Fi Alliance lays claim to the entire 802.11 family.
The Wi-Fi Web site also offers plenty of advice for designing and building your
own wireless network. The site’s information tends to be correct but a bit
generic. It also has trouble advising use of 10/100Base-T and HomePlug cabling
where that may really make sense. But bias on a marketing Web site certainly
shouldn’t surprise you today.
One of the most critical functions for the Wi-Fi Alliance is to certify products.
Over 175 products from all the major wireless players have been certiﬁed,
meaning they will work in conjunction with comparable products from other
vendors with the same certiﬁcation.
Certiﬁcation takes time and costs money, however, and some vendors jump into
new certiﬁcations immediately and others wait to see whether customers need
or even care about such certiﬁcations. Sometimes that leaves a disconnect
between the Wi-Fi Alliance, vendors who certify immediately, and later vendors
in line for certiﬁcation.
Because the new Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) security ratings were put
forward in late 2002 by the Wi-Fi Alliance, some companies have jumped in and
others are waiting. Vendors complain about the constant “shake down” of
various certiﬁcation groups, as if various certiﬁcation labels were required for
protection of their products in the market. Hmm, maybe they are.
Details of WPA await you in the next chapter, so you can see for yourself how
important or not the certiﬁcation label is for your network products. Seeing the
details should also make you appreciate the effort vendors expend to make
conﬁrming products and the time and money they spend on the process. But if a
new product from a major vendor name in the wireless space doesn’t have a
WPA sticker, it may be more a matter of timing or other considerations than an
admission that the product has no security.
802.11 futures
Two sections ago, the 802.11e Quality of Service draft standard made some news
in the discussion about nonstandard enhancements to the 802.11g standard.
Because the 802.11e QoS standard has yet to be ratiﬁed and accepted at this
writing, that certainly falls into the realm of a 802.11 future enhancement.
Wi-Fi fans are like all other technology users: they want more sooner. Work
progresses on a variety of enhancements, including the following:

✦802.11k: Radio resource measurement of wireless LANs
✦802.11m: Maintenance update
✦802.11n: High throughput
✦No number: The Wireless LAN Next Generation Standing Committee
Where are these working groups trying to go? Several analysts believe that
802.11 networking speeds will be up to nearly 300 Mbps in 2006. Perhaps the
technology will ﬁrst tease us with about 100 Mbps by 2005, if some other
analysts are correct.
Interestingly, the rumors are that the 100 Mbps service may use the 5 GHz
frequency range. That could make those almost-orphaned 802.11a devices a hot
commodity in the future.
Of course, analysts often confuse their mission of objectivity when telling
vendors who are buying their reports what they want to hear. The list of wrong
analysts guesses never ends, because some of the worst technology analysts
continually spout off just to get their names in the paper.
However, the trend of all networking players is to run faster. There are bandwidth
and technology tricks aplenty to get your wireless devices talking at two or three
times the speed they talk today. Bet on it; just don’t bet on the arrival date.
Choosing the Right Wireless Local Area
Network Hardware
Now you get to have some fun and actually start playing with some of the
wireless toys, er, network devices. If you’re new to wireless, let me tell you three
things that everyone who builds a wireless network learns the hard way:
✦Installation won’t go as easily as you hope.
✦Signals won’t run as far as you hope.
✦Wireless won’t run as fast as you hope (but it will be faster than your
broadband connection).
You will learn these facts as well. Even though you may believe me at this
moment, you will be taught these lessons.
But all is not lost. People set up wireless networks every day, and you will get
yours running. It may be slower than you expect, but it probably won’t be slower
than your broadband connection. Even on the best day with my cable

Chapter 15 ✦Wireless Connection Options 401
broadband service I don’t get better than 3 Mbps download speed. 802.11b
actual throughput speeds on a good signal will beat that (5-6 Mbps) or equal that
(fallback to 2.5-3 Mbps at longer distance).
Now you need to decide what to buy for the wireless portion of your network. If
you have some network pieces already, you will have fewer choices. If you’re
starting a network from scratch, you have more ﬂexibility. The good news on
this front is that falling prices have made almost all the network components
you will need so inexpensive in the last few years you won’t have to “make do”
with subpar equipment because of money.
Every wireless network needs one or more of the following items:
✦Wired-to-wireless connection point: If your network router supports
wireless, as many do, that will be your connection point. If you don’t
make this connection in your router, you will need a wired-to-wireless
bridge. This is usually a wireless access point that connects to a wired
network.
✦Wireless access point: A device with an antenna for wireless client
connections and an Ethernet plug for linking into the wired network.
Some access points have no Ethernet connections and should really be
called wireless repeaters (and sometimes what’s called a wireless
repeater is really an access point).
✦Wireless connection device on every client: Clients can only connect to
a wireless network if they have a wireless network adapter of some kind.
These devices are often integrated into PDAs or laptops, and come in the
form of PCI cards for use inside a computer or USB connections for use
outside the computer.
You may have a perfectly acceptable wireless network that consists only of your
network router with wireless support and a laptop with built-in Centrino 802.11b
connection hardware. Or, you may have two dozen wireless clients connecting to
multiple access points scattered around your business.
Router
This device will anchor your network. Your broadband service provider will
leave you with a cable/DSL modem with an Ethernet plug. Every cable/DSL
modem I’ve seen has only a single Ethernet plug, which makes it almost
mandatory to connect a router to that Ethernet plug.
Technically you can connect your Windows PC to that plug, but that’s a bad, bad
idea. And I said Windows PC on purpose, because few if any broadband service
providers can support a Macintosh or Linux system connected directly into the
cable/DSL modem. Most have conﬁguration software, and all the software I’ve
seen is Windows-centric.
This router (or whatever you have plugged in to the cable/DSL modem) must
provide security for your network. Even if your service provider allows you to
connect a PC directly to the cable/DSL modem, don’t do it.

402 Part IV ✦Linking Your Network Devices
If you need a security refresher refer to Chapter 7.
Choosing your router
Here’s a critical question: What type of network will plug into your router? After
all, the router deﬁnes the network to a large extent, so you will save time and
trouble by picking the router that best supports your planned network.
Figure 15-3 shows the product page for Linksys. Notice how the wireless
products are subdivided into access points, routers, and gateways followed by
network adapters.
Figure 15-3: The Linksys product Web page does a good job of laying out your
options.
You may or may not need a wireless print server or specialty products, but you
will certainly need a router device and a wireless connection device for each
client. So use the following checklist to ﬁgure out what best ﬁts your network
needs:
✦Router connections:
❑Wired only
❑Wireless only
❑Wired and wireless
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 15 ✦Wireless Connection Options 403
✦How many local Ethernet ports (if any)?
❑One
❑Four
❑More than four
✦Must this router support HomePlug?
❑Yes
❑No
✦What wireless 802.11 standard(s) must this router support?
❑802.11b only
❑802.11g only
❑802.11a only
❑802.11b and g
❑802.11b and a
❑All three: 802.11a, b and g
✦Will you have a separate Ethernet wiring hub or switch?
❑Yes
❑No
Notice an option missing from the checklist? Usually network decision trees like
this include “how many users” type questions. But for home and small business
networks with less than 25 users, all the wireless routers discussed will provide
adequate service. If you have more that 25 active Internet-surﬁng, wireless-using
clients hammering on your network all day long, you need another book after
you ﬁnish this one.
No distance questions were asked. When you’re dealing with only wireless
product options, distance becomes a big deal. But because wired options to
handle distances were covered in the previous chapter, I don’t think spending a
lot of time rehashing the distance proﬁles of the various wireless standards is
necessary.
It shouldn’t surprise you that most vendors have ways to help you decide which
products ﬁt your needs. Figure 15-4 shows the D-Link conﬁguration page that
pops up whenever you click the Which Wireless Technology Is Right For You?
icon. All their answers include D-Link products, of course, but you can still learn
quite a bit here and use a comparable product if you prefer.
I ﬁnd seeing multiple product options displayed on one page helpful. You can’t
blame a vendor for displaying only its products in the assisted decision screens.
But this should also point out how different vendors coin different names for
product features.

Figure 15-4: Helpful, if product speciﬁc, wireless choice chart.
Another option missing from the decision checklist earlier is pricing. Everyone
has a budget, no matter how small or how large (lucky you).
Books have trouble detailing prices, because prices change quickly and books
take months to print and stay available (I hope) a long time. But let me give you
some relative pricing notes to help you compare routers:
✦Single feature products cost less than multifeature products.
✦More plugs on the router cost more than fewer plugs (local Ethernet
ports).
✦Single wireless standard routers cost less than multistandard routers.
✦Routers with all three wireless standards cost most of all and limit your
choices most severely.
✦802.11b support costs the least of all.
✦Buying a combination router will be cheaper than buying two
single-function routers.
Although reluctant to list solid pricing because of the fast-changing marketplace,
I will mention that I just saw a name brand 802.11b wireless router advertised in
the newspaper for a price, after rebate, of $10. Pricing has become a nonfactor
for most network decisions now, at least in the range of home and small business
equipment discussed in this book.

Chapter 15 ✦Wireless Connection Options 405
Besides all these carefully reasoned explanations, understand that this is a
competitive market with several major players working to increase their market
share. Pricing is one of the easiest changes they can make, so special deals come
and go regularly. New products constantly force lower prices on their
predecessors, so if you can ﬁnd last year’s product the savings may be
substantial.
Placing your router
The standard location for your router is right beside your cable/DSL modem.
Either your router or your cable/DSL modem (or both) will probably include an
Ethernet patch cable. Use the patch cable to connect the cable/DSL modem to
your router.
But “standard” doesn’t mean mandatory. You can place your router quite a
distance away using longer 10/100Base-T twisted pair Ethernet cables or even a
HomePlug bridge between your cable/DSL modem and your router. These
options become important when your broadband service provider puts your
cable/DSL termination point in a spot convenient for them rather than
convenient for you.
Installation technicians put cable/DSL modems in strange spots. One of my
neighbors has his cable modem, and his router, in the master bedroom closet.
For some bizarre reason, that’s where the cable connection wound up.
You will almost never have to touch your router after it’s up and running. The
only times you may have to touch it are when you add or subtract a new device
to the router or you have to reboot the router because your broadband service
has gotten “confused” and you need to reset everything. These situations won’t
happen often for the lucky but may happen daily for the unlucky.
Conﬁguration screens for routers are accessed via a browser to the router’s
internal Web server. You can be anywhere on the network, or anywhere in the
world in some cases, and still conﬁgure the router.
Client connection hardware
Most people consider clients to be their own workstations, and that’s the typical
use. In this situation, however, a client will be anything connected to your
network. If you have a network device, it’s a client. Backup server? Client. Small
business server appliance? Client.
Clients have these options for Ethernet or wireless network adapter connections:
✦Desktops almost always have an Ethernet port on the motherboard.
✦Desktops have a Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) slot inside the
machine for a PCI Ethernet or wireless network interface adapter card.
✦Desktops almost always have a Universal Serial Bus (USB) connector.
✦Laptops (especially newer ones) may have 802.11b built in (Intel’s
Centrino chipset).

406 Part IV ✦Linking Your Network Devices
✦Laptops almost always have an Ethernet port.
✦Laptops almost always have a PC card slot for network interface cards.
✦Laptops almost always have a USB connector.
Figure 15-5 shows the three types of client adapters in a nice concise display.
Figure 15-5: Your three choices for client adapters.
Network appliances always include at least one 10/100Base-T twisted pair
Ethernet connection. Some of them, in particular server appliances, also include
wireless connection options.
The Taurus server appliance from Procom Technologies comes from a company
that makes many storage products, and half the time it advertises that box as a
wireless storage appliance. But it includes routing, Web and e-mail servers, and a
variety of other features as you can see in Figure 15-6.
The Taurus server has a very handy LCD screen on the front. Unlike a few other
products with a screen, you can actually make conﬁguration changes through
the screen and front-panel buttons.
Toshiba’s Magnia server line also includes wireless support as an option, but its
Web site redesign makes it impossible to ﬁnd the page describing the Magnia
servers. Sorry, Toshiba, but I can’t ﬁnd a good screenshot.

Figure 15-6: One of the server appliances that include wireless support.
Pricing, always risky to state in a book, will be affordable for the standard
wireless client connection device. Many laptops have everything you need
already, so no additional purchase will be necessary. And if your network is a
mixture of wired and wireless, as it likely will be, you can always connect the
10/100Base-T twisted pair Ethernet connections on desktop systems to a wiring
hub or a port on your cable/DSL router.
Hardware conﬁguration tools
In this section, “tools” means software. Rarely if ever will you need to take a
screwdriver to your hardware. However, you may be tempted to adjust your
computer with a sledgehammer on a regular basis. I have to ﬁght those urges
now and then.
Because these are network devices, you must conﬁgure them to match your
existing network. If you are building a new network, chances are you will still
have to conﬁgure them to match your plans for your network.
Initial hardware setup
Product vendors have egos, just like everyone else. However, almost all vendors
treat their router or other network appliance as if it’s the lead device in a brand
new network. Few vendors make an effort to play nice with others and take into
account the possibility of an existing network.

408 Part IV ✦Linking Your Network Devices
This means you will have to use a single PC (a Windows PC) to conﬁgure most of
your network devices initially and that you will need an Ethernet port on your
PC and a patch cable to connect to the network router or other appliance for the
initial setup. Figure 15-7 shows the Windows XP screen conﬁgured to ask for an
IP address.
Figure 15-7: Setting your Windows XP Home system to accept IP address information
from another device.
Read the installation instructions for each piece of equipment, of course. But
here is the general outline of how to conﬁgure a router, storage appliance, or
server appliance:
1. Click Conﬁgure your Network Connections ➪Local Area Network
Connection ➪Internet Protocol Properties and check Obtain an IP
address automatically.
2. Turn off your PC and the network device.
3. Connect the patch cable between your computer and the device. If your
device comes with a crossover patch cable for use during conﬁguration,
be careful to mark it so you don’t mix it up with the regular 10/100Base-T
twisted pair Ethernet patch cables.
4. Turn on the network device.
5. After a minute or so (or indicator lights tell you the device has booted
properly), turn on the PC.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 15 ✦Wireless Connection Options 409
6. Let the network appliance give your PC the necessary network IP address
and other information.
7. Start your browser and go to the IP address shown in your installation
instructions. This will usually be 10.0.1.1 or 192.168.1.1 but it may be
something else.
8. Provide the username and password shown in the network device’s
documentation. If you can’t ﬁnd these, try “admin” and “admin” or
“administrator” and “admin” and hope for the best.
9. Conﬁgure the network device’s IP address to match your network (if you
have one). If not, perform all other conﬁguration options necessary.
10. If you change the network device’s IP address, you must reboot that
device and then reboot your computer before you can reconnect and
ﬁnish the job or even verify the changes.
11. Verify the conﬁguration and reboot and retest everything before you
allow yourself to believe you are ﬁnished.
This all looks more complicated than it really is. You must let the network device
conﬁgure your PC with the network parameters set as the default in your
network device. After your PC and device can talk, you can conﬁgure the unit
using your browser. Figure 15-8 shows the administration login screen for the
Kanguru router/NAS unit.

If the network device manual tells you the IP address of the unit, you can
conﬁgure your PC manually to that network range and skip some of the
steps listed. Best to let the network device’s Dynamic Host Control Protocol
(DHCP) server provide the details, however, because sometimes the manuals
represent some type of alternative reality and not the network device you must
conﬁgure.
After you have made connections with your network device, follow the
instructions for conﬁguration. (Sorry I can’t be more helpful here, but I don’t
know what device you have.) The good news is that many devices are getting
much better about providing users an easy conﬁguration process. Change your
network device passwords immediately if there is any chance of others misusing
your equipment or network connections, or if the device can be seen on the
Internet.
Two of the better setup procedures are in the Kanguru and the Netgear WGT624
108 Mbps Wireless Firewall Router. Figure 15-9 shows the Kanguru Quick
Conﬁguration initial screen.
Figure 15-9: How nice to see the upcoming process listed to allay fears.
Not only does Kanguru give you a list of what will happen in the main screen, the
left menu helps as well. Each menu step down the left menu will highlight as you
step through the process. You can then see what you’ve already done and what’s
left to do at every step in the process.

The Netgear router has an automatic process, but doesn’t provide all the
step-by-step assurance. However, Netgear does provide much more help
information on the right side of the screen, as you can see in Figure 15-10. And if
you let the newer network devices try to conﬁgure things themselves, you may
be surprised at how often they do the work pretty well.
Figure 15-10: Another automated setup sequence.
Changes during use
If you’re lucky, you won’t have to change many things on your network after it’s
up and running. Be aware, though, that big-company network managers don’t
manage the network, they really manage the changes to the network. The same
will happen with your network.
Network storage and server appliances may need changing at times, depending
on whether you add or delete users from your network.
You may tighten security on wireless connections after you notice a
strange computer name on your network, but that will appear in Chap-
ter 16 about security.
Keep a ﬁle with the quick install guides for every network device. I write the
username and password directly on the covers of the install guides so I don’t
have to read the thing to ﬁnd the details. If the devices have assigned IP
addresses, meaning (for me) servers and storage appliances managed via Web
browser, I write the address on the installation guide as well.

412 Part IV ✦Linking Your Network Devices
Physical Design of Your
Wireless Network
Networks all in the same room or ofﬁce together don’t need a design, they just
need a place to sit. Networks that span two rooms with one wall between them
still don’t need much in the way of network design.
After you start spreading your network around a home or small business, you
may need to start paying attention to where you put various network
components. You will have placement options to choose from, depending on
whether you need security or distance.
Designing for security
It may sound funny that you can design your wireless network in a way that
improves security. But just think of the way radio waves work, and you may start
seeing how device placement (network design) really affects your performance
and security proﬁle.
Remember that 802.11 × radio signals do the following:
✦Penetrate two or more walls (b and g)
✦Penetrate glass as if it were invisible (all)
✦Reach farther when higher up
✦Change signal direction based on antenna angle
✦May go for 1,000 feet outdoors
To avoid the problem with signals going through walls, place all types of access
points (wireless bridges, routers, and gateway) as close to the center of the
room as possible. This placement also helps cover the room with a strong signal.
Avoid putting wireless transmitters of any type near windows. This includes
desktops and laptops. Yes, the windows are scenic, but they stop radio waves as
well as they stop light waves (not at all, in other words).
Place transmitters as high as possible. Many companies even make antennas
that stick on the ceiling to get the best coverage possible. If your placement
choice is on a desk or on top of a bookcase, choose the bookcase.
If your ofﬁce shares walls with other companies, place your access point
(wireless router) as far away as you can from the other company and still cover
your clients. Shared walls make the need for strong passwords on all network
resources, along with various wireless security issues to be discussed in the
next chapter, more critical than ever.
There are new products coming that may help secure the perimeter of
your wireless network, if you can believe it. Newbury Networks
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 15 ✦Wireless Connection Options 413
(www.newburynetworks.com) of Boston recently released Wi-Fi Watchdog. This
enterprise-level tool effectively blocks those outside your perimeter from
receiving any wireless signal from your network. You train the system with
locator points that track you as you walk around the ofﬁce boundaries. Passive
sensors help the system deﬁne walls and doorways and other entrance and exit
points.
Short answer? Newbury Networks really can stop hackers from intercepting
signals leaking out of your network. It’s expensive and difﬁcult to set up in the
beginning (at least in the initial version tested by my friend Tom H), but it works.
Designing for distance
Now, a contradictory option for designing your wireless network. Because the
previous section outlined how errant signals from your network are a serious
security threat, extending the reach of your transmissions must be done
carefully. But many situations require a long signal yet are nowhere close to
another home or ofﬁce to intercept those signals. Just be aware that one of the
primary concerns for many wireless users is the idea that someone in a van in
the parking lot can intercept their signals and roam their network.
You can take advantage of small details to greatly increase your range and
coverage. If these tips are not enough, check out the Options heading in this
section for a few other tricks.
Quick checklist for distance improvements
Vendors know the most about their equipment, of course, and here’s a collection
of tips I culled from various wireless vendors to improve transmission range:
✦Place routers and access points close to the center of served client
devices.
✦Place routers and access points high in the room.
✦Keep line of sight between clients and access points whenever
possible.
✦Stay away from water, including ﬁsh tanks, water heaters, water coolers,
and full bathtubs.
✦Stay away from metal ﬁxtures, such as sprinklers and large light ﬁxtures.
✦Standard antennas must be as vertical as possible on routers and access
points. The weakest signals are below and above (better) the antennas,
so you may need another device on the ﬂoor below.
✦Interference from microwaves and some cordless phones will reduce
distance, so move either those objects or your wireless devices.
✦Aim client antennas toward the router or access point by pretending
you’re working with an old TV and rabbit ears.
✦Move laptops, especially those with antennas built into their viewing
panel, around the desk a bit to improve reception.
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

414 Part IV ✦Linking Your Network Devices
✦Make sure your antenna is fastened tightly to your wireless device.
✦Space wireless channels used on different routers farther apart. Try
channels 1, 6, and 11 for maximum range in a large network.
Sometimes small location differences make a big improvement in signal strength.
Many times the improvement comes from a change that wouldn’t seem to be
able to make a difference, but it does. Radio waves are always logical and
predictable, but because you can’t see their interaction with the environment,
keep moving things for better reception.
Options
There are two great ways to extend your wireless range after you’ve exhausted
all the easy ways mentioned previously:
✦Get special antennas.
✦Connect your wireless extra router or access point to a HomePlug device.
Every wireless device comes with an antenna or two, even if you can’t see it.
Laptops often wind antenna wires around the LCD panel because that part sticks
up in the air, giving better reception. Routers and access points may have an
antenna or two that can be rotated and position slightly.
Buying add-on antennas may be less expensive than extending your wireless
network some other way. Figure 15-11 shows most of the D-Link catalog of extra
antennas.
Figure 15-11: More solutions to the wireless range problem.

Chapter 15 ✦Wireless Connection Options 415
Notice the antenna in the bottom-right of Figure 15-11? The Yagi antenna family
is highly directional. This focus of radio waves transmitted greatly extends your
range while enabling you to control the wave pattern for security. If your home
ofﬁce overlooks a long yard in one direction, a Yagi antenna or some other
directional option would be more secure than placing a regular omni-directional
antenna in the middle of the area.
Of course, because I’m not selling wireless network products, I can also tell you
to mix and match wired and wireless to extend your range. HomePlug is a great
way to sneak data connections through walls or other barriers.
If a concrete wall in your basement ofﬁce or thick ﬂooring in your home blocks
your wireless signals, don’t automatically reach for the antenna catalog. You
may have more success by connecting an access point to a HomePlug bridge in
the area you’re trying to reach.
Just as a wireless bridge can help reach across a void like an atrium, a HomePlug
bridge can reach through a barrier. Home ofﬁce in the basement, but you want to
use your laptop on the second ﬂoor? If the signals won’t reach, try a HomePlug
bridge. You may be surprised at how often a low-tech solution can solve a high
tech shortcoming.
Channel settings
As you’ll see in the next chapter, 11 channels are used for wireless networking in
the United States (13 in Europe). How did 11 get to be the magic number?
Because about 550 MHz of spectrum bandwidth is allocated for wireless
broadcast use in this frequency range, and developers wanted about 5 MHz for
each channel. Hence 11 channels of about 5 MHz bandwidth each.
Radio signals weaken with distance due to interference and loss of wave
integrity as it spreads. You can see this yourself by watching the ripples in
smooth water after something is dropped into the water. As the resulting ripples
run, they get smaller and less distinct. So do radio waves.
The primary “ripple” for a radio wave is plus or minus 11 MHz from the center
frequency used. The secondary “ripple” extends that reach out to 22 MHz (for
802.11b but only about 10 MHz and 20 MHz for 802.11g).
Oops. See the problem? Channel 6, right in the middle, sends waves that
stretch out and interfere up to 22 MHz away up and down the spectrum. But
because each channel is only 5 MHz apart, Channel 6’s broadcast interfered
seriously with Channels 5, 4, and 3 on the downside and Channels 7, 8, and 9
on the upside. So you really don’t have 11 usable channels, you have only a
few that can broadcast without stepping on the toes of other channel
broadcasts.
Most advice for channel selection says to use only Channels 1, 6, and 11. This
spread gives maximum room to avoid interference. If you have only one or two
routers or access points, this advice works ﬁne. Because one router or gateway
will support 15–20 wireless users, you may be in good shape.

416 Part IV ✦Linking Your Network Devices
If your network density stretches these limits, however, you have another
option: using more closely packed channels. One company, Cirond Technologies,
Inc., put out a white paper explaining how four channels can be used and
without causing too much interference.
Check out the Cirond Technologies white paper here: www.cirond
.com/White_Papers/FourPoint.pdf
Essentially, using four channels (1, 4, 8, and 11) keeps enough distance between
frequency ranges and resulting interference although adding a fourth channel
option for wireless access points in a congested network design. Channels 1 and
4 may be closer together than some people would like, but if you put a router or
access point using Channel 11 between those two, you have plenty of distance
for radio waves in one channel to decay before interfering with waves from
another channel.
Will this be a critical installation tool in your design kit? No, but it’s nice to see
ways around roadblocks that “everyone” says are insurmountable.
Summary
Wireless network design isn’t difﬁcult for the majority of home and small
business users. Simple placement techniques can improve distance while
maintaining some level of security.
Don’t fall into the trap of believing that your network must be all wireless. That’s
great for design papers from wireless vendors, but you have choices. Wireless is
a great tool, but a great tool misused is only the wrong tool. Pick wireless
components for your network when they make sense, but always keep your eyes
open for options.

Those trusting souls who don’t believe in layers of
security to protect their data may want to avoid wireless
networking. Because of the medium used, wireless
forces layers of security onto you because you must
protect the network (wireless transmissions) as well as
your network resources.
Examples of layered security you may well implement,
include:
✦Firewall on your wireless router
✦Encrypted message trafﬁc
✦Directional control of wireless access points to
keep radio waves from leaking to the world
✦Unique usernames and passwords on all network
resources
✦Physical protection of servers and computers
✦Extra security to laptops used wirelessly when
traveling
All of these options make sense on their own, and they
make more sense when used in combination. Saying
layered security is just shorthand for saying multiple
security protections in place.
Be prepared. When wireless networking works, it’s
wonderful and simple and joyous. When wireless
networking doesn’t work, which is much of the time at
the beginning, it’s painful and aggravating and horrible.
Wireless networking gets weirder and crankier as you
enable security, so get a grip on your temper before you
start.
There are concepts in here you may never have seen
before, such as encrypting network trafﬁc and aiming

radio waves. That’s okay, because you’ve never tried sending your data
connections winging through the air before. Depending on your network’s use
and the data you have to protect, you may take a relaxed attitude or spend your
time anxious and nervous as you wonder who’s listening in to your network. Of
the two, I suggest you lean away from relaxed and more toward nervous, but
only as far as alert and informed.
Wireless Security: An Oxymoron?
I Googled “wireless-security +oxymoron” and received 970 results. That’s bad for
wireless fans who need security. The good part is that many results were from
articles declaring that wireless security is not an oxymoron. In other words, you
can have a wireless network and still sleep at night.
You can make a wired network secure, or at least secure your network resources
and connections so that an outsider gets no beneﬁt from wardriving and using a
portable wireless packet capture program to check out your network. You can
make it so secure your users revolt. So you need to ﬁnd some point in the middle
where your network is blocked from outsiders but usable by insiders.
Every writer of a security chapter has an obligation to say this: Insiders will
cause you more data security nightmares than outsiders. That’s based on
history, looking at common network problems. Don’t lock the gates on the
outside and leave things completely unprotected on the inside. That’s the
reason I have mentioned using passwords and access lists for internal network
resources all through this book. However, this advice does not mean an outsider
can’t cause you serious grief, just that an insider will likely cause you more grief.
But grief is the constant when dealing with computers.
Start Thinking Security When Wireless
Now that I’ve scared you with the difﬁculties of wireless security in particular
and the grief of computing in general, let me start ﬁlling in the holes in your
security proﬁle. First, of course, you need to start understanding that you
actually have a security proﬁle, which may be a new thought for you. But if you
go wireless, you have a security proﬁle, which is an organized approach, and the
steps you take, to protect your security.
Not only do you have a security proﬁle, you have one that’s exposed. If you just
use two wireless connections in your home, you are exposed (but not too
much). If you have dozens of wireless connections at your business, your proﬁle
goes up much higher. When your exposure becomes noticed by the wrong
people, you become a target.
When you activate your ﬁrst wireless network connection, you pass the
“security forever” point of no return.

Chapter 16 ✦Wireless Security in Depth 419
At the wireless router/gateway
The entry point to all your network resources is your wireless router, gateway,
or access point. Your wireless clients connect to your network proper at this
point, and so can outsiders.
Your wireless router/gateway/access point (let me just say router from now on)
must do several things:
✦Connect to the wired portion of your network
✦Provide access to your broadband service
✦Accept or reject wireless clients seeking access to the network
Outsiders looking to get into your network must breach your router to do so.
Plan on some type of strong authentication so your router allows only those into
your network you want in your network.
You can’t run your router free and open to the wireless world and hope for the
best. Adding security measures can be somewhat time consuming, but replacing
data stolen or trashed by a hacker will take even more time.
At the laptop client
The majority of wireless clients tend to be laptops, because they’re the
computers most likely to move around. Desktops can certainly use wireless
network connections, but things that stay in one place are pretty easy to tie
down with a network cable.
Laptops that travel out of your home or ofﬁce have extra security requirements,
especially when you use them to make wireless connections elsewhere.
HotSpots at the coffee shops are great, but you better start thinking of your
laptop less like a computer and more like a brick of money, because that’s what
it will cost you if it’s compromised.
A staggering number of laptops are left at airports every day. 96 were left at
security checkpoints at Denver International Airport over a two-week period in
early 2002, for example (according to USAToday). That’s not to say almost a
hundred people lost their laptops at the airport, that’s how many people forgot
to pick up their laptops after going through the x-ray machines. No telling how
many others were left at bars and restaurants and the like.
Many companies make laptop hard drive encryption software that effectively
renders a laptop useless if someone doesn’t know the password. Do you have
something like that on your traveling laptop?
How about dial-in numbers, access codes, and passwords saved so you can
connect to the home network with a single click? Many people conﬁgure their
laptops that way to make connections quick and simple. That means thieves
have a quick and simple connection to your network as well.

420 Part IV ✦Linking Your Network Devices
Do you share your laptop hard drive? If so, anyone who can get onto your
network can also get onto your laptop hard drive. If that happens, that person
may as well have your laptop in his or her lap.
All the security details upcoming must be applied with extra diligence on
laptops used for wireless networking. Not to do so puts your entire network at
risk. Losing a laptop is expensive. Losing a laptop that contains the keys to your
personal or business bank accounts can move from expensive to outrageously
exorbitant and blindingly painful.
Service Set Identiﬁer
The Service Set Identiﬁer (SSID) is the most basic security portion of any
wireless network, although it’s a stretch to call it a piece of security. Essentially
just an unencrypted password that sits in the header of every data packet, the
SSID isolates networks from one another if there are several in the area.
All trafﬁc inside one Broadcast Support Service (BSS) must use the same SSID or
the packets will be rejected, because the BSS performs the same function as the
Workgroup setting in basic Windows networking. Because packet rejection is
involved, you can kind of call the SSID a level of security.
The SSID setup is about the easiest of all settings, but there is a catch: every
station on the same wireless network must have the exact same SSID. If you
enter a typo in a wireless client, it won’t see the network.
Immediately change the default SSID for your wireless network devices (every
wireless device has an SSID). Hackers know all the default SSIDs used by various
vendors (such as “wireless” or the name of the vendor) and check those when
looking for open networks.
At the wireless router
Start your conﬁguration at the router. You will have to use a wired connection to
reach the router conﬁguration screen, or you may have to conﬁgure a client to
match the default setup of your router. For this example, I’m assuming you have
an existing wired network and are adding a wireless component or two.
Figure 16-1 shows the Wireless Setting page for the Netgear WGT624. There are
several settings on this page I will get to, but look at the ﬁrst one, the SSID.
Notice the SSID: Gaskin-Test-1. That’s a good start at a secure network name
(what the SSID is, essentially), but not a great one.
It includes letters and numbers, which is good. It includes punctuation, the
dashes, which is also good. It includes upper- and lowercase letters, also good.
But it doesn’t have nonsense names to guard against a dictionary attack, where
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 16 ✦Wireless Security in Depth 421
hackers run through common words and names while trying to crack
passwords.
Figure 16-1: Network name is a good explanation for SSID.
Tech Bits
SSIDs are case sensitive. NetworkName is not the same, to the computer,
as networkname.
A better way to create an SSID that is just as easy to remember as the one in
Figure 16-1 is to scramble the letters. You may want to substitute a couple of
numbers for letters, such as Ga5kin-T3st-1. This is just about as easy to
remember, but takes out almost all the words in the dictionary. Perhaps a better
SSID would be Ga5k1n-T3st-1. That changes every word, or part of a word, that
may be in the dictionary.
The SSIDs entered in the clients supported by this router must be written
exactly as the SSID is written in the router. Typos or changed capitalization will
look like a different (and wrong) SSID when they reach the router.
Usually, the router shows the SSID on one of the status screens. In this Netgear
example, the status screen shows quite a bit of information about the wireless
connection. Figure 16-2 shows it all.
The router can broadcast the SSIDs into the world. This feature works great for
HotSpots where clients don’t know any details about the available routers and

needs to ﬁnd them, but it’s a terrible idea when you want to hide your router
from outsiders.
Figure 16-2: Wireless port conﬁguration status screen for the Netgear WGT624.
Every router I tested comes with the SSID broadcast turned on. You need to ﬁnd
that conﬁguration screen and turn SSID broadcast off before putting your
network into production.
Figure 16-3 shows where to turn off the SSID broadcast for the Netgear router.
Notice you can also completely turn off the Wireless Router Radio (fancy name
for the wireless portion of the router) if you want to hide your network when
you’re not using it. Almost all wireless routers include a way to turn off the
wireless portion if you’re just using it in a wired-only network.
Does this plan work? Absolutely. In Figure 16-4 I made a connection with a client
computer to two different wireless routers. The ﬁrst one was the Netgear router
in Figure 16-3 I turned the SSID broadcast feature off earlier. I grabbed this
screenshot after the broadcast name disappeared.
Notice the second router on Channel 1 has no WEP security (Wired Equivalency
Privacy, the next security step, will be important in just a bit). Notice the second
router has its SSID broadcast turned on, so I (and anyone passing by) can see the
network name. That’s a second reason the lack of WEP security will be critical in
the next section.

424 Part IV ✦Linking Your Network Devices
To wrap up the SSID router details, you must always perform the following
actions:
✦Make the SSID a good password.
✦Turn SSID broadcasting off at the router.
At the wireless client
When SSID broadcasting is turned off, clients must know the SSID network name
to ﬁnd a router. That’s an improvement in the security world. Making your
network resources (and your router is a valuable network resource) hard to ﬁnd
improves your security proﬁle a bit.
Every wireless client conﬁguration utility includes a place to put in the SSID. In
the ZyXel USB wireless network adapter conﬁguration screen, the SSID text is
near the top of the screen. Figure 16-5 shows this client-side utility and the
aforementioned SSID.
Figure 16-5: The cursor arrow points to the SSID.
Isn’t it nice of ZyXel to tell us what SSID means? Be prepared for different clients
to call the SSID something other than what you’ve seen here, such as just
identiﬁer or SSID with no explanation.
Take another quick look at Figure 16-5. Notice the ﬁeld just above the SSID
named Operating Mode with a value of Infrastructure? Your other option for
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 16 ✦Wireless Security in Depth 425
Operating Mode is ad hoc. You always want infrastructure, because that tells
your client to make a connection to a router or access point. Ad hoc allows each
wireless client to be a server as well, and pass along packets from other devices
through its connection, sort of a peer-to-peer wireless network. Security with ad
hoc wireless networks is pretty low, so always use infrastructure and let your
wireless router earn its keep.
Every client has some way to search for network routers advertising their SSIDs.
Figure 16-6 shows the ZyXel client conﬁguration page with Site Survey listed on
the tab.
Figure 16-6: The wireless site survey ﬁnds only the one
router broadcasting its SSID.
In an active environment, the clients may list several networks available to them.
What’s more disturbing is when you start your wireless network conﬁguration at
home and you see the broadcast SSIDs of your neighbors. In high-density areas,
such as a street corner in a business district, you may see a dozen or more
wireless networks blasting their SSIDs to the world. But do you see the router
with the SSID of Gaskin-Test-1 on this list? Exactly.
I hope you’re honest and able to turn back the temptation to look at your
neighbor’s network. And if you don’t enforce security on your network, I hope
your neighbors are equally honest.

426 Part IV ✦Linking Your Network Devices
Copy your SSID carefully to each client so they can ﬁnd your router. The only
way for a client to ﬁnd a router that is not broadcasting its SSID is to have the
SSID conﬁgured beforehand.
Wired Equivalency Protocol
Wired Equivalency Protocol (WEP) gets a bad rap today. Although called 64-bit
security, the WEP developers were forced to stay with only 40-bit security when
ﬁrst released because of export restrictions in place by the U.S. Government.
The 40-bit of allowed encryption for the data packets keeps out some people,
but will not keep out determined eavesdroppers and hackers.
Tech Bits
WEP encrypts data traveling over wireless links, but the short security keys
makes it possible to break the encryption in a relatively short amount of
time.
Yes, WEP is vulnerable, but keep this in context. Your car door locks are really
pretty useless, too, but if they discourage thieves or joy riders enough to
convince them to move to the next car, that too has value. WEP won’t keep out
corporate spies bent on penetrating your network, but it can be enough to
encourage a wardriving hacker to move to the next business and stop snagging
signals while sitting in your parking lot.
Although WEP can’t stand for long, some reports say that hackers must gather
about 4,000 data packets before they can start the process of cracking your WEP
keys. And 4,000 packets doesn’t guarantee they will break your encryption; They
just provide enough raw material to work with to start the process of elimination
to ﬁnd your encryption key.
WEP provides three important security advantages:
✦The encryption prevents causal eavesdropping.
✦It increases the authentication barrier for hackers so they have to work
harder to gain access to any network resources.
✦The checksum (simple error detection technique) used by WEP prevents
any tampering with transmitted messages.
Many security experts consider WEP, even at 40-bit levels, to be enough security
for home users and small businesses. I buy the home user part, but not the small
business part. If you run a business and want to stick with WEP only, at least use
the 128-bit level and buy yourself a little more protection. That’s only a bit more
work on your part to make the hackers work a whole lot harder.
At the wireless router
Creating the WEP key has gotten easier, so there’s no excuse not to have at least
WEP enabled on your network. In Figure 16-7, you can see the process underway
on the Linksys WRV54G Wireless-G router shown earlier in the book.

Chapter 16 ✦Wireless Security in Depth 427
Figure 16-7: Use a 16-character phrase and generate your keys.
For the 64-bit security setting (WEP has 128-bit security because the U.S.
Government has relaxed some of the security export rules) a 16-character
phrase will be turned into four 10-character hexadecimal keys. Hexadecimal is
Base 16, so after 0-9 letters take the place of the next numbers, making A-F
numbers in this part of high school math you and I both forgot.
After ﬁlling out the passphrase all I had to do was click the Generate command
button and the four keys were inserted into the proper places. Each client must
transmit exactly the same key expected by the router or the packets will be
rejected.
Tech Bits
Encryption keys are used in an algorithm to decrypt messages. The longer
the key, the more secure. Key lengths have grown over time because
faster computers can encrypt and decrypt messages more quickly be-
cause of their increased number crunching abilities. Keys of 40 bits
(64-bit keys including the overhead) took weeks to break on old comput-
ers in the 70s takes hours today. Hence the move up to 128-bit, 256-bit,
512-bit, and 1024-bit keys and beyond. The increase in processing time
to encrypt and decrypt is far below the time needed by someone trying
to crack the code and identify the key.
One handy way to rotate keys (a good idea in the security biz) is to pick a day
every week or two and move from Key 1 to Key 2 and so forth. If someone has
cracked your network, changing the key will close the door. After the fourth key
has been used, issue a new passphrase and start with new keys.
If you get wireless gear that doesn’t include the passphrase option, you’ll have
to create your own hexadecimal keys. Not too hard, but you have to remember
the rules and make keys with exactly 10 characters.

428 Part IV ✦Linking Your Network Devices
At the wireless client
Using the 128-bit WEP encryption improves your security proﬁle considerably.
Figure 16-8 shows the ZyXel USB wireless client WEP encryption screen. Notice
there is room for a 32-character passphrase.
Figure 16-8: Here you can use a 32-character passphrase.
Using the longer WEP key improves your security enough to make using WEP
really worthwhile. Sure it can still be broken, but if hackers want your business
records that badly they can probably get all they need by going through your
dumpster at night.
Data security threats never rest. More business secrets go out in the trash
from most companies than ever go over the wireless network.
Again, your client and router must match exactly or your packets will be
shunted off into the void somewhere. You may ﬁnd them with the socks your
drier eats, but that’s only a theory.
Simple rule: activate WEP on your network. Clients and routers must match
exactly to communicate. Change your keys regularly. The newer client and
router conﬁguration tools make all this much easier than ever before.

Chapter 16 ✦Wireless Security in Depth 429
Media Access Control Filtering
You may remember way, way back in the discussions about Ethernet interface
cards that every Ethernet card in the world has a unique MAC address. MAC
stands for Media Access Control, but you can think of this as a serial number for
every Ethernet card.
A central numbering authority issues each Ethernet adapter vendor a unique
company identiﬁer, and the company then keeps track of every MAC address in
its address range. It’s a nice, neat system that provides some excellent security
advantages when used correctly. Imagine the wireless router checked each
incoming packet for a ﬁngerprint, and it had to be the ﬁngerprint of your client
device or the packet would be rejected. The MAC functions as that ﬁngerprint.
You can think of it as a hardware-based serial number if you prefer.
Again, newer conﬁguration screens make your life much easier. The Netgear
WGT624 lists each active workstation connected to the router and allows you to
enter the MAC address, along with a device name (deﬁned on the computer in
the operating system) with a single click. Figure 16-9 shows this handy screen.
Figure 16-9: The easy new way to enter MAC addresses.
After you have all your approved clients attached to your router, simply click
and integrate them each into the MAC address database. To make things easier

(they think) the vendors often hide the name MAC address. In Figure 16-9 they
call this the “Wireless Card Access List” of which you see the setup screen.
The old way was more trouble, believe me. Let me show you why you will greatly
appreciate the new way to capture MAC addresses.
The Linksys WRV54G provides room for 20 MAC addresses, as you can see in
Figure 16-10. Each “00” of the six in each space must be replaced with a
hexadecimal (that again, unfortunately) number corresponding to one of your
network clients or devices.
Figure 16-10: A list page for allowable MAC addresses.
Linksys calls this the “Wireless Network Access” page rather than Wireless Card
Access List in the Netgear router. But it’s all the same thing, and both
conﬁguration screens talk about what a MAC address is in their right-side help
screens.
Don’t let me leave you with the idea that it is horribly difﬁcult to conﬁgure the
MAC addresses for the Linksys. You can’t see in the screenshot, but at the
bottom of the 20 entry spaces there is an active Select MAC Address For
Networked Computers button. Click that and a window opens showing the
connected systems known to the router. All you have to do is click the Select
check box and the Linksys integrates the MAC addresses as easily as the Netgear.
MAC address authentication does a great job of restricting network access to
only the network clients and other devices you conﬁgure. As you may guess, this

Chapter 16 ✦Wireless Security in Depth 431
can become a pain for large networks. But small networks with stable client
populations (you aren’t adding and subtracting stations all the time) ﬁnd this an
excellent security control.
Technically, this is only an authentication control, not a complete security
option. You need to ﬁnd an option you’re comfortable using that includes
authentication and encryption. Although this is another good layer of security,
you still need to put passwords on your network resources just in case someone
gets access to your network through some other avenue.
Virtual Private Network Connections
VPN is another lovely three letter acronym, but one that’s fairly self-explanatory.
Virtual signiﬁes something that isn’t real, but acts like it is. A Private Network
keeps your data trafﬁc safe because no one else can see it. Thus a Virtual Private
Network provides a way for you and your data to feel like it’s running through a
data tunnel built especially for you, even though the trafﬁc goes over the
Internet with all the other billions and billions of bytes ﬂying around.
VPNs can be worth an entire book themselves (several, actually), but I don’t
have that much space left. So let me show you one quick way to connect a VPN
over my wireless network.
Does it make sense to go to the trouble of conﬁguring a VPN for use within your
own ofﬁce? If you want complete wireless connection security, it does.
In my case, I want a VPN to one of my server appliances to use as a ﬁle server. So
I created a VPN to go over the wireless link between the ZyXel USB wireless
network adapter and the Netgear WGT624 Wireless Firewall Router to the Tritton
ASAP 120GB Network Attached Storage unit. The important part is getting
access to the remote network by linking to the VPN device on the far end. After
you make that connection, your computer thinks it’s on that network.
Windows XP clients have all you need for the client side of the VPN. Here’s the
process for enabling VPNs for the client:
1. Open Network Connections (Start➪My Network Places➪View Network
Connections).
2. Under Network Tasks (the left-side menu) click Create A New Connection;
then click Next.
3. Click Connect To The Network At My Workplace; then click Next.
4. Click Virtual Private Network Connection; then click Next.
5. Provide the Connection Name for future reference.
6. Provide the VPN Server Selection (server name or IP address).
7. Click Finish to create an icon for this VPN connection.

432 Part IV ✦Linking Your Network Devices
Yes, the connection wizard assumes you’re connecting over the Internet to your
workplace, but that’s okay. You may do that as well with this same wizard, but
for now let me just get the link to my ﬁle server.
Figure 16-11 shows the Windows XP wizard asking for the name for this
connection. Give this a descriptive name if you have more than one connection.
Figure 16-11: In Step 5 of the previous list, you provide a name you can remember
for the connection.
Broadband-1 may not be descriptive enough for you, but it works here for me.
Feel free to give your icon the name of the ﬁle server, for example, so you can
keep track.
The next step asks for the VPN server name or Internet Protocol address of the
end-point connection. Because this is all on my local network, I prefer to use an
IP address rather than a name like http://tritton.gaskin.com because using
a name forces me to have a local Domain Name Server running in my local
network.
Refer to the Domain Name Service section in Chapter 12 if you want to
check out running your Domain Name Server in your home or business,
but most small companies don’t. They use Windows networking for con-
necting to Workgroup assets, and rely on the name service provided by
their ISP for Internet name translations.

addresses rather than let them grab an address from the pool? This is why: you
have to list the exact IP address of the connection point. You can’t give an exact
address if that may change after a device reboot.
Figure 16-12: Specifying the far-end connection of a VPN.
I don’t want to put the IP address of my router in here, because the router is not
the endpoint of my VPN (my ﬁnal destination). The whole idea is to convert an
open-air wireless connection with no protection into a secure communication
conduit. That means I want every stop on the network traversed by the VPN, not
my open-air wireless signals to keep the trafﬁc between me and the network
attached storage device encrypted for the entire trip.
Your network must have an intelligent VPN device on each end of the
connection. In this case, the ends are my PC running Windows XP Home, and the
Trident router/gateway/network attached storage unit. If I was trying to reach
the SnapAppliance server and storage device instead, I would make the router
the endpoint of my network. Because the Tritton includes VPN capabilities, I’m
securing my wireless connection all the way to the folders on the Tritton.
After you click the Finish button, Windows XP Home creates a new icon in the
Network Connections page. In my case, the icon is named Broadband-1. Now I do
wish I’d picked a better name.

You can check all these settings by right-clicking the VPN icon and choosing
Properties. The information you conﬁgured, plus many options and security
details you may not want to dive into at ﬁrst, are all displayed for you.
Figure 16-13 shows the Networking page of the Broadband-1 Properties window.
The other choices under Type of VPN are Automatic and L2TP IPSec VPN. You
won’t need to use them unless the device on the far end requires their use rather
than the Peer to Peer Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) shown.
Figure 16-13: Checking on the VPN deﬁned in the
previous screen shots.
The General tab enables you to set the IP address of the destination device
again, which is the Tritton storage device in my example but could be another
router in your case. The Options tab sets dialing behavior. (Microsoft still treats
this like it’s an old-fashioned data connection over a modem.)
The Security tab includes authentication and validation information. If your
company uses a Smart Card for security, you would have to register that with the
Windows XP Home software as well any reader you have to use.
The Advanced tab includes another chance to turn on the Microsoft Internet
Connection Firewall. I don’t recommend that because I prefer using router and

gateway products because of their better coverage and low hacker-attack
proﬁle. You can also turn the computer for which you are creating the VPN into a
gateway for all your other network devices (but I don’t at all recommend that).
Because we’re connecting to a wireless router on the same network, I think we’ll
leave this one blank and keep the router and included ﬁrewall as the primary
defense from outsiders.
Finally, my goal is reached. Figure 16-14 shows a directory listing of my Tritton
ASAP server appliance retrieved over my private VPN. It doesn’t look much
different than any other Explorer directory listing, but it does go over the VPN.

The next ﬁgure, Figure 16-15, shows the Broadband-1 connection Status page. I

from the defaults programmed by Microsoft.
In case you can’t read it, here’s what this page shows, along with a few words

Chapter 16 ✦Wireless Security in Depth 437
True, most people consider VPN a remote ofﬁce connection technology rather
than one used for local home devices. On the other hand, nothing in the VPN
descriptions I’ve read mentions any distance limitation, short or long. A safe,
encrypted data tunnel can run as far as you want, even if only a dozen feet.
Tech Bits
Point to Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) was developed by Microsoft
and some partners (U. S. Robotics and others) to wrap your data IP
packets inside the PPTP encryption scheme so the trafﬁc can ride over
the public IP network (the Internet) without being readable by anyone
else. Because Microsoft drove the development, they included it inside
Windows XP. This makes a very convenient VPN option.
If you truly want your wireless network to be usable without worrying about
every little security hiccup, getting a VPN for your local wireless trafﬁc will allow
you to rest easy. When every wireless connection occurs over a secure link, your
network wiring security solution is pretty much complete.
On the other hand, a VPN takes some level of client setup. With a few computers,
that’s not a problem. If your business has a large number of systems, keeping
everyone conﬁgured properly may be more difﬁcult and time consuming than
the effort justiﬁes. A security protocol built into the wireless gear, like with WEP,
makes life easier. That’s especially true if your wireless routers and client
hardware all support the newest wireless security connection, Wi-Fi Protected
Access (WPA).
Wi-Fi Protected Access
The 802.11 portion of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE)
spends much of its time wrestling with security. 802.11i, a draft working its way
through the process (too slowly for many people) will improve security in
multiple ways. One of those ways, now available as sort of a “future attraction” is
WPA.
How WPA works
Similar to WEP, WPA relies on many of the same security concepts but adds
several critical differences:
✦The Pre-Shared Key (PSK) is a longer key value than used with WEP.
✦The Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) includes mixing and
sequencing functions to change the key.
✦It offers 500 trillion values to try and crack.
✦It facilitates automatic key modiﬁcations over time.
✦The entire data packets are encrypted, not just the data payload.

438 Part IV ✦Linking Your Network Devices
Yes, eavesdroppers could listen to your data transmissions and try and crack
WPA. But they have to decode each piece of the data, track the key values, and
decode them before the key changes. With current technology, the estimate is
that it will take about 2 years to collect enough data from a normal wireless
network to crack the WPA encryption. But eavesdroppers don’t have 2 years,
because the key changes constantly (every few seconds) during data
conversations.
No security system is bulletproof, because people have to implement the
security and people make mistakes. However, a properly conﬁgured network
using WPA will be as close to complete protection as any wireless network
(outside the U.S. military) has ever been.
Conﬁguring WPA
Because the home and small business users who need security may not have
servers installed to support WPA, the Wi-Fi Alliance allows manually entered
keys to be used. These Pre-Shared Keys are nothing more than passwords
(actually passphrases) entered into the conﬁguration for the router and each
client. After that, WPA takes over.
The WPA for nonserver environments requires authentication (the matching
passphrase in the client) so it keeps eavesdroppers out of your router. Then it
starts up the key-changing rotation so keys mutate every few seconds. This
makes even the smallest home wireless network secure.
At the router
The Netgear WGT624 includes WPA, because it’s brand new on the market. Older
systems may be upgradeable via ﬁrmware updates from the manufacturers.
Starting in the spring of 2004, almost all the new wireless products you will ﬁnd
for homes and small businesses will support WPA.
In the same security setup screen I’ve shown you before, the Netgear includes
WPA support. The security folks have done a good job of making this simple to
use. Figure 16-16 shows the space for the passphrase, which can be from 8-63
characters long. Because the WPA screen real estate doesn’t require much room,
the arrow cursor points to the text ﬁeld.
Type your password or passphrase, save the conﬁguration changes on the
router, and you’re ready to go. Of course, now you must make sure the clients
have the exact same passphrase, including the case of every letter.
At the client
Just as the router portion of the WPA security improvements doesn’t require
much conﬁguration, the client side is a relative snap. Figure 16-17 shows the
client conﬁguration program from the Netgear WG511T wireless PC Card in a
laptop.

I reached the small Advanced Security window at the bottom of Figure 16-17 by
clicking the Advanced Security command button in the bottom-right area of the
main conﬁguration window. This client had no security to start with, as will be
the case when installing equipment.
It would be a cruel joke for vendors to ship products with security enabled and
force you to guess the 8–63 character passphrase. It’s aggravating enough when
routers have usernames and passwords conﬁgured automatically and I have to
search through the paperwork to ﬁnd them during setup.
Again, the passphrase must be exactly the same on the client as on the router. If
anything is different, such as a lower case letter rather than an upper case letter,
you will get no connection. That’s not meant to torment you, because it shows
the security process works properly, but it will be aggravating.
Copy your passphrase down clearly and keep it somewhere safe. A sticky note
on your monitor is not safe, and it’s an old joke. After you conﬁgure the
passphrase, you don’t need it for normal operations.
One WPA security hole to avoid
No good deed goes unpunished, and WPA is no exception. There’s a glaring
security hole in the WPA message initiation process: a hacker can force your
WPA router to renegotiate a connection and grab the key information sent by the
server during that process. If your key is less than 20 characters long and uses
common words, a dictionary attack can ﬁnd your key.
Let me repeat: Short, “real” word passphrases can be hacked. This WPA hole is
actually less secure than WEP at the very beginning if you use a short
passphrase with real words.
Solution: Use a longer passphrase without any “real” words involved. Remember
when I turned “Gaskin-Test-1” into “Ga5k1n-T3st-1” with a simple number-for-
letter substitution? Some other smart person may take a phrase, like “to err is
human, to forgive diving” and turn that into 2Eih-24giD. Do the same, or similar,
on your WPA passphrase and you’ll be okay.
Actually, you should make your passphrase longer so you’ll be even more okay.
But you only need type this phrase once at your router and once at every client.
That’s not too much of a burden for solid security, is it?
Security Improvement Checklist
One thing many vendors and informational Web sites provide is a security
checklist. These are good reminders to implement security and do it properly.
You think it’s funny that people today have to be reminded to implement
security? A recent survey of London businesses found that 67 percent (two out
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 16 ✦Wireless Security in Depth 441
of three) businesses with a wireless network did not have security enabled. No
security of any kind protected two-thirds of London businesses during the
survey in 2003.
Vendors ship WPA turned off, as all earlier security options have been turned off
for installation. You’ll see in Chapters 17 and 19 that security functions can
interfere with wireless connections or limit the range of your network. That’s
why one troubleshooting technique is to turn security off. But you must
remember to turn it back on.
So here is a long list of security reminders, prompts, prods, and nags collected
from various places:
✦Turn some type of security on. A little security is better than none.
✦Update the ﬁrmware for all routers and client hardware components.
Security improvements are one of the big reasons for updates from
vendors.
✦Change the default SSID value. Hackers know all the standard ones, so
don’t leave this glaring hole open in your network.
✦Change your SSID every week if your wireless network doesn’t use VPNs
or WPA.
✦Turn of SSID broadcasts. Don’t yell “here’s my network, come get me” to
the world at large. Wardriving works because people are lazy with
security.
✦Do not provide Dynamic Host Control Protocol (DHCP) service to wireless
connections. Put a speciﬁc IP address on every wireless client. Giving out
DHCP addresses makes it easier for hackers to join your network.
✦Set your network to “Infrastructure Mode” rather than “Ad Hoc Mode” so
your network will not allow peer-to-peer connections to a laptop out in
the parking lot.
✦Use MAC address ﬁltering.
✦Place routers and access points out of reach. If someone resets the
device, it reverts to the manufacturer’s default security conﬁguration and
leaves a hole in your security wall.
✦Use a VPN for all wireless connections.
✦Upgrade your equipment to WPA compliance, or buy only equipment
with WPA support.
✦Enable WPA for every device. Not just some devices, but every device.
✦Set out a trap for wardrivers: leave on old WEP-only router turned on by a
window for increased broadcast range out of your building, but don’t
connect it to the network. Hackers will spend their time trying to ﬁnd
your network through that device and won’t look elsewhere.
✦Use security yourself, so everyone else in your family or business
understands you strongly support the use of security procedures.

Summary
Protecting your data takes some time and effort, but your data is worth it. If you
use a computer, you have a security hole in your life. Close that security hole
with your wireless network and sleep easier.
One security “tool” will not protect you. WPA is the best wireless security option
available so far, but you have to turn it on and you have to use it on every device.
Do you leave the keys in your car’s ignition when you park at the mall? Then why
would you leave the keys to your network data hanging out in the air for anyone
passing by to grab and use?
Enable the security tools you have, and monitor all the routers and clients on a
regular basis to make sure they are all still conﬁgured securely.

avesdropping became popular as wireless
networks became popular. After all, wired networks
don’t broadcast their data packets to the world and
hope only the destination nodes are paying attention.
So just like you can’t help but eavesdrop on a cell phone
caller beside you at the movies, you can’t always help
being an eavesdropper in the world of wireless
networking. But polite members of a technical society
never consciously eavesdrop, and their proper response
when an outside signal intrudes is to inform the network
owner of the security leak.
You may never be able to stop wireless network signals
from leaking out of your home or small ofﬁce. People
tend to put their desks around the walls and their
computers on their desks. So if you have wireless
connections that have a clear signal at the outside wall,
the signal almost certainly goes through your walls and
out into the world. Some companies are working on this,
but the equipment has yet to be affordable for any but
the largest companies. It will be interesting to see if the
signal control tools do become inexpensive enough for
home use.
Polite isn’t the term for those who intentionally
eavesdrop on networks. The correct term, in almost
every case, is criminal. And with preparation, you can
avoid being the victim of the eavesdropping
criminal.

Why You Care About Eavesdropping
Some people seem not to care about eavesdroppers. You see them all the time,
chatting on their cell phones in the bathroom and laying their papers all over the
table in the break room.
If you don’t care about people eavesdropping on your cell phone calls, that’s up
to you. No one gets hurt in situations like that, although plenty of people get
annoyed. But if you don’t care about people eavesdropping on your wireless
network, you can ﬁnd yourself in serious hot water.
Here are a few things those eavesdroppers can do:
✦Steal your broadband service bandwidth, leaving you less than you need.
✦Read your e-mail.
✦Find your bank account numbers.
✦Download child pornography through your network.
✦Deliver child pornography to others through your network.
✦Delete your ﬁles.
✦Store stolen software ﬁles on your server.
✦Send spam to millions of users with your return address.
Anything intruders could do while sitting at your computer using your
password, they can do from outside your home or ofﬁce if your network isn’t
properly secured. In other words, anything you can possibly do on your
computer, hackers and wardrivers can potentially do.
I know few people who would willingly broadcast every e-mail message to the
world at large. Are you one of those? If you’re wireless network isn’t secure, you
are whether you know it or not.
You know all that spam you get every day? Many of those messages come from
hijacked computers under control of an outsider. You may have a great ﬁrewall
in place on your broadband router between your network and your service
provider, and that’s wonderful. Many hackers enter through insecure broadband
connections. But they can also enter through your wireless router as well.
Modern spam robot utilities don’t need to communicate often with their control
remote sites. The software can be “planted” in fairly small applications that
come through e-mail attachments or from outsiders via your wireless network.
You may never know your systems are infected and part of a spam network until
you notice your computers churning like crazy at 3:22 A.M. while ﬁlling your
broadband connection with outbound spam.
You put lock on your doors. You put a ﬁrewall on your broadband connection.
Take the next step and invest in appropriate wireless security tools when you
start your wireless network.

Unlike other pornography, child pornography is illegal to buy, sell, or
own. And if some wardriver puts child pornography on your system, you
own it and the trouble that comes with it.
Why do you care about eavesdroppers? Because they can steal your bandwidth,
your money, your good name, and your freedom if police follow child
pornography trails back to your system. You may be able to prove you didn’t put
the child pornography on your server, but just the fact you have it makes you a
felon.
How They Eavesdrop
Let me quote a hacker from an online forum run for, and by, eavesdroppers:
“More than 75 percent of the networks you’ll ﬁnd will have the default
SSID, and more than likely, the default router login. Just about all
(name withheld) routers can be connected through via
http://192.168.1.1/, leaving the username blank, and using “admin” as
the password. Also, any hacker can do his dirty work from the street
using poor Mr. Schmoe’s network as his connection. So who do they
trace the deed back to? Not Mr. Hacker, but Mr. Schmoe. . . poor poor
Mr. Schmoe. If somebody is computer savvy, they’ll most likely have
WEP encryption on their network, which requires a mere key to
connect. AirSnort (a tool for Linux) actually will break these keys.”
All the grammar, spelling, and punctuation comes straight from Mr. Hacker, not
me. For the record, I always spell Mr. Schmoe as Mr. Shmoo, but I remember
reading Al Capp. (I was young, very young.)
Eavesdropping is not illegal, but using someone else’s bandwidth is considered
theft of services by most law enforcement groups. One Web site document I
found on a wardriving says plainly, right up front: “It’s illegal to connect to a
nonpublic AP without permission. Period.” Then the paper goes on to detail
exactly which tools will help you ﬁnd and connect to nonpublic Access Points
(AP) without permission.
Wardriving
Don’t misunderstand the intention of those mobile hackers called wardrivers.
Yes, hackers like to protest they are only curious and do not cause a problem.
Maybe. Certainly wardrivers can’t be considered illegal, because they are in a
public space when they catch leaked wireless signals. The law clearly allows
photographers to capture whatever they want when standing in a public
space, so wardrivers are likely allowed to receive signals while also standing
in a public space. But photographers can’t climb a private fence for a better
shot, and wardrivers can’t transmit through someone else’s broadband
connection.

But just because they’re in public doesn’t mean they aren’t looking. Take a
gander at the Web site and this product kit they’ve put together in Figure 17-1.
Figure 17-1: Wardriving products collected and modiﬁed.
You can’t see but they describe the antenna as follows:
✦Discrete! Low Proﬁle Antenna
✦Portable! Magnet Mount Antenna Base
✦Effective! Gets the antenna outside and on top of the vehicle where it can
pick up more access points.
And I do think the American ﬂag is a nice, patriotic touch. You don’t want to
buy your hacking tools from someone who doesn’t believe in the rule of law, do
you?
Of course, carrying lock picks and safecracking tools is legal. Using them is a
different story. The same goes with wardriving tools. Although I wonder whether
a court has declared whether special antennas are allowable tools or burglary
equipment, like lock picks, and get wardrivers in trouble when used.
Powered interface cards and external antennas have multiple legitimate uses.
With the right equipment, you can stretch a wireless network connection from
the standard hundreds of feet to miles.

When your network is tagged by a wardriver, one of two (legal) things can
happen. First, the eavesdroppers can leave their mark on your building. This
process is called warchalking and will be covered in the next section.
The second thing that can happen is your location will be entered in a global
database of wireless networks. Figure 17-2 shows the main page of
www.wiggle.net.
Figure 17-2: Have your wireless network security leaks advertised to the world.
It may be interesting to see where all the wireless networks are in the world, but
the precision of some of these listings can be disturbing. The ofﬁcial toolkit for
wardrivers includes a GPS device connected to the laptop scanning the air for
leaky wireless networks. So if your network gets tagged, it more often than not is
listed as precisely as civilian GPS equipment can pinpoint your location.
Of course, knowing where all the drug dealers are doesn’t mean you will
automatically go and buy drugs. But if your neighborhood has a budding
wardriver looking for a network to start eavesdropping, GPS equipment can
reveal the exact coordinates at which your signals leak most strongly out of your
home or ofﬁce.
Of course, if freeloaders just want wireless Internet access, they can go to
thousands of coffee shops and even fast food restaurants. Would wardrivers be
doing something illegal if they accessed a free Wi-Fi access point from out in
their cars rather than while sitting in the coffee shop?

What can the budding eavesdropper do when he ﬁnds your corner and your
wireless signal? He (or she) can use one of the 33 software programs gathered at

Want to gauge how worried you should be? When I checked the site, there had
been 1,186,752 downloads of the NetStumbler software. Yes, nearly 1.2 million

For those who prefer to travel light, there is even a lite version of this application
that provides all the wardriving and net-ﬁnding software necessary and is written

Chapter 17 ✦Avoiding Wireless Eavesdropping and Hacking 449
Figure 17-4: Wardriving.com warns readers.
The critical point you should take away from this somewhat disturbing section is
that using wireless network connections without proper security in place is
effectively broadcasting to the world. Some wardrivers are merely curious, and
some just want free Internet access. But increased public Wi-Fi access satisﬁes
those who need a wireless connection, leaving the wardrivers who are curious
or worse. Security experts now warn that wardriving has become a corporate
espionage activity, enabling competitors to learn company secrets while sitting
comfortably in a car across the street.
Warchalking
Once a wardriver ﬁnds an open network, he or she often marks the location with
speciﬁc chalk diagrams to tell others about the free Internet access. The fact
that your network may be open to access as well, including your personal and
business information, is (to the warchalkers) your problem.
With the Web the way it is lately, going to anything dot com often leads you to
exactly what you’re looking for. Unfortunately, that doesn’t always work, and it
didn’t with www.warchalk.com (a metal band from Philadelphia—hear their
music at www.garageband.com/artist/warchalk). So I tried the dot net
extension, always a good second choice. Figure 17-5 shows the site awaiting me
when I tried www.warchalking.net.
Warchalkers have a code of ethics, and advocate the use of symbols to advertise
publicly available Wi-Fi HotSpots. Not all warchalkers follow such noble
endeavors, however, so if you see the symbols near your home or business, they
are telling you something. That something is that your security is worthless,
your network is wide open, and only blind luck has protected you to this point.

Sniffers
The ofﬁcial sales mark for Sniffer originated in the mid-1980s from a company
named Network General based in Silicon Valley. I know this because I sold
Sniffers, in their hardware incantation, in 1987 and 1988.
Based in the only real portable computer at the time, a Compaq Portable, the
Sniffer used the Compaq’s Intel 286 processor and whopping 20MB hard drive to
grab packets from Ethernet networks for real time performance monitoring and
analysis later.
Sold long ago and now owned by the McAfee company, the original Sniffer
opened a window into networks that few people had ever seen before. This was
back when Ethernet ran only over coax, Microsoft Windows barely existed, and a
Sniffer, hardware and all, cost around $30,000.
The reason “sniffers” (the lower case must be used unless you’re talking about
the Network General product owned by McAfee for years and now spun out to a

new Network General company) work is because of how Ethernet works. And
they work whether the network runs over wires or wirelessly.
If you remember back to the networking explanations back in Chapters 11 and
12, Ethernet is (at least electrically) a bus network. Every network adapter sees
every packet, because all the packets go all the way up and down the network
cabling system. Adapters watch the packets go by and grab only the ones
addressed to them.
The developers at Network General (led by chairman Harry Saal) wrote an
application that turned on “promiscuous mode” in certain Ethernet network
adapters. This was the term used to describe a node that captured every packet
no matter which destination address was on the packet. I should probably say
“copied” rather than “captured” because the original packet remained on the
network and was not disturbed by the Sniffer.
Of course there’s a promiscuous mode, because the original Ethernet
thin coax couplers came with male and female connections.
Over the years network analysis software became separated from the hardware
and inexpensive versions became available. The demand for network “sniffers”
remains high, especially for companies developing software and hardware
products. Figure 17-6 shows the Web site of a company that makes an excellent
product I’ve used myself many times.

Various protocol analysis tools like the Sniffer and Triticom have two great
customer bases: network troubleshooters and network software developers.
Troubleshooters need to see when requests for services go out, when they are
received (if they are received) and what the response is to the request. You
might be amazed at how many packets go back and forth two systems just to
type in a username.
Network software developers use these tools to see inside each protocol packet
on the network involved with their software. Applications rely on standard
programming hooks for network functions, but not all equipment vendors and
operating system developers read the speciﬁcations in exactly the same way.
The ability to see inside each packet on the network, down to the software code
included in the data portion of the packet, gives modern developers a huge
advantage over their predecessors.
Wireless sniffer tools have turned network monitoring into another tool of
wardrivers and hackers. Although wired Ethernet hubs, switches, and routers
have changed the “every adapter sees every packet” scheme of earlier days,
wireless network adapters must still examine each packet as it ﬂies by. So
wireless analysis tools became tools of wardrivers.
How do “sniffers” work? Quite well, thank you. And they have worked well for
two decades and will continue to do so. That means, if your network leaks and
has no encryption, the contents of every data packet on your network can be
captured, analyzed, and decoded into plain English with almost no effort on the
part of the wardriver.
Legal issues abound
There seems to be a bit of confusion about whether all of this stuff is legal, any of
this stuff is legal, or if it’s all illegal. On one hand, standing in a public place like
the sidewalk, and receiving “free” Internet access through a leaky wireless
network doesn’t seem illegal to many people. If it is, does that mean ﬁnding a
dollar on the sidewalk and picking it up is stealing?
The worldwide reach of the Internet confuses things even more. Many countries
have few if any restrictions about intellectual property, or at least vastly different
notions than the American justice system. Most laws protect property, and the
taking of property is depriving the victim of the use of the property. But if I have
a digital song ﬁle and you copy it, I still have my ﬁle, so I haven’t been deprived.
This is an argument the record companies have been ﬁghting for years.
Chapter 4 talked at length about community wireless broadband access. I
personally think community wireless is wonderful, especially when people get
together to extend broadband Internet access to areas underserved by
commercial service providers.
But community access networks buy their own Internet access and provide it to
their group. Wardrivers don’t, they piggyback on your Internet access. And your
contract with your broadband service provider may very well not allow more
than one computer connection to the Internet at a time. This means that not
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 17 ✦Avoiding Wireless Eavesdropping and Hacking 453
only can a wardriver not use your connection, your spouse or children can’t
either (what the salesperson says doesn’t matter, only the contract terms
matter). Read your service provider’s contract and see what you’re really
allowed to use.
Wardrivers claim that any open network is an invitation to access the Internet. In
other works, you are offering a gesture of friendliness and goodwill, as you
would offer a traveler a drink. But is it your water to offer? Read your contract to
see if that’s a noble offer or violation.
And if all the wardrivers and warchalkers were noble and honorable, what a
wonderful world it would be. But the world contains con artists, identity
thieves, burglars, muggers, swindlers, and others who often make modern life
painful.
Leave the legal arguments to lawyers sipping brandy and discoursing at their
club. If you want to protect your home and business, you better protect your
wireless network. Perhaps it’s a cold way to look at the world, but the number of
noble and trustworthy fellow travelers seems to be dwindling.
Like President Reagan said: “Trust, but verify.” Use veriﬁcation and security on
your network, so you can trust those who are using it in your home and business.
Common Wireless Hack Attacks
There are well-known weaknesses in wireless network hardware and software
products, particularly products shipped with security disabled or ports open for
outsiders to access. Even worse, the Wired Equivalency Protocol limitations
exist and a standard 64-bit security scheme can usually be broken within two
hours, depending on the trafﬁc volume on the network.
Let me go through a list of standard wireless attacks, and show how you can
defend yourself. Of course, the best defense today is Wi-Fi Protected Access
(WPA) or a Virtual Private Network connection between all wireless clients and
your network resources.
Wired equivalency protocol cracking
1999 was the year Wired Equivalency Protocol (WEP) became part of the 802.11
standard. The joy of an encryption scheme lasted only a short while once the
vulnerabilities became known.
Because it uses a static key, WEP encryption can be broken by a variety of
available tools. The trick for the hacker is to passively capture enough packets
to gather enough of the Initialization Vector (IV) packets to isolate the random
number used by the WEP encryption scheme. These packets are sent
unencrypted, making their capture and decoding even easier.
How available are the tools needed to crack your WEP encryption? At one Web
site, the software page lists almost 40 applications. The following operating
www.it-ebooks.info

454 Part IV ✦Linking Your Network Devices
systems can be used to host such cracking tools:
✦Linux
✦Windows
✦BSD Unix
✦Macintosh (OS 9 and OSX)
✦Java
✦PalmOS
✦PocketPC
✦DOS (yes, that DOS)
Want to read a real-life exploit of a WEP network? The O’Reilly Web site page for
the book Wireless Hacks at www.oreilly.com/catalog/wirelesshks/
includes a link to an article called “Dispelling the Myth of Wireless Security.”
Written in mid-2003 about Macintosh systems, the article outlines how the
author cracked his WEP-protected network in about 90 minutes.
One of the most popular WEP cracking tools, AirSnort, advertises that after the
software captures enough packets, it breaks the security key in less than one
second. While gathering the packets, AirSnort is completely invisible to the
network, because it captures packets passively.
Defense: Use Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) or a VPN for wireless trafﬁc.
Read Chapter 16 again for WPA details, and upgrade your wireless equip-
ment if your network data is worth keeping private.
Man-in-the-middle attacks
All wireless Ethernet trafﬁc can be captured by any eavesdropper stationed
within range of the network transmissions. The man-in-the-middle hacker
captures and decodes packets sent between the client and the access point
during initial association. All manner of information, including the IP addresses
and the network SSID, are exchanged during the initial handshaking.
After the information is gathered and decrypted, the hacker can emulate another
access point on a different channel. This assumes the hacker even has to
decrypt the information. Hackers know that the majority of wireless network
managers never turn on security protections (don’t be one of them). When done
sitting close to a client, the hacker can persuade the client’s network adapter to
reassociate to the new faux access point. Then the client and the server/router
believe they both are still connected to each other, but they aren’t. The
intervening hacker now can see all the data packets ﬂowing between the two
nodes, including all network resource login sequences.
Defense: VPN connections or strong authentication processes such those as
included with WPA can stop a bogus access point from being accepted.

Chapter 17 ✦Avoiding Wireless Eavesdropping and Hacking 455
The VPN discussion in Chapter 16 included ways that modern Windows
operating systems and VPN providers start the encryption immediately.
In addition, authentication controls on the wireless access point refuse
communication if the client device isn’t listed in the user database.
Two excellent protective measures, and both are free with the wireless
products.
Media access control attacks
Media Access Control (MAC) addresses can be cracked just like WEP encryption
keys. That assumes the network being attacked even uses security at all, of
course. After the MAC address has been gathered, hackers can “spoof” a valid
user by presenting the authentic MAC address. They can replace the MAC
address (the hardware serial number of sorts) for their network interface
adapter with the MAC address from an authorized user on the network. The
wireless router/access point believes the spoofed packets are coming from the
authenticated device, and grants access.
Defense: VPN connections (Chapter 16) or strong authentication processes like
802.1x (coming up).
Dictionary attacks
Although Blanche DuBois may rely on the kindness of strangers, hackers trying
dictionary attacks rely on the stupidity of network users. Every router or access
point issues a challenge to which clients must respond to before being
authenticated. The most common method is the demand by the access point for
a username and a password from the client seeking access. When the user types
the name and password, hackers can intercept them on their trip to the access
point.
When hackers capture that exchange, they assume the password is either really
lame (like password) or that standard words are used for the password. Working
ofﬂine, an application replays that challenge and response while electronically
substituting every common word in a huge database.
After the application hits on the right word or combination of words, the hacker
need only supply the newly found password when challenged by the router. With
a simple login, the hackers have full access to the same network resources as the
original client they monitored.
Defense: Longer passwords that include letters and numbers (but no real words)
defeat the dictionary attack. Authentication schemes, such as VPNs (Chapter 16)
and the new 802.1x mechanisms (coming up), also defeat these attacks.
Session hijacking
If hackers have enough information about your network, they can insert their
own bogus access point into your network scheme. This is particularly easy if
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
456 Part IV ✦Linking Your Network Devices
you have no security enabled, or just the weakest security options turned on.
Clients can be fooled into connecting to this new fake access point by sending
their authentication information. Then the hackers have the information needed
to login to the network directly.
Defense: Strong authentication procedures, such as for VPNs described in
Chapter 16, won’t fall for this hijacking scheme.
Thwarting Eavesdropping and Attacks
Notice the common thread of all the defense options listed in the previous
sections? Strong authentication like you get with VPNs, Wi-Fi Protected Access,
and other new security enhancements. If this doesn’t convince you to upgrade
your wireless network security, I guess you’ll have to keep reading.
I said before that turning off the SSID broadcasts, changing the SSID, and using
WEP will discourage casual hackers and nosy neighbors from reading your
network transmissions. If your home or ofﬁce sits in the middle of a densely
populated area and near many other wireless networks, just discouraging the
casual snoopers may not be enough. That’s when you need a more active
defense.
Unfortunately, after you get beyond the security tools available with products
such as WEP and WPA, things stop being free. If your wireless network
supports commercial transactions, you must protect those because of
banking and credit laws. If your wireless network transmits medical information,
you must protect them because of federal regulations concerning patient
privacy.
The following list contains four companies and one dealer that provide wireless
network defense tools and/or services. They are not free, but they may be far
less than the cost of losing some or all of your commercial business to wireless
hackers.
I have not used these services and therefore cannot endorse any of them. These
are references from others who are active in this area and these names came up
more often than other product names.

One thing you may have ﬁgured out by now is that protecting yourself and your
wireless network from attackers requires action, not hope. Implementing tight
security takes effort. Even weak security installations require effort, so you
might as well take a little extra time and do it right.
One company developed a wireless security program using an ingenious
solution to a common problem. Because the SSID (the wireless network name)
can’t be hidden from wardrivers with the right equipment, why not hide it in
plain sight, but in the middle of thousands of other SSIDs.
If a wardriver sees one or two SSIDs, your network security disappears quickly. If
wardriver sees 12,448 SSIDs, what do they do? Trying them all would take days,
and the hackers like action. They will, if all goes according to plan, drive on and

bother someone else’s network. And that’s about as good a security as you can

There’s no lack of information out there on the Web on wireless network
security, but much of it covers the same basic information I just covered. But
that should give you a clue: when every writer and consultant says you should
implement some type of security, and they have to say it over and over again, it
indicates people aren’t following these directions.
But you’re smarter than the average bear, right? If you’re reading this chapter,
you’re serious about keeping your business on the inside of your home or ofﬁce,

Chapter 17 ✦Avoiding Wireless Eavesdropping and Hacking 461
802.1x
802.1x deﬁnes a way to authenticate a user to a network. This can be a wired or
wireless network, as long as ports (software locations) are used. The basic idea
is that connections require port number access, and if authentication isn’t
granted, the port can be shut off. Thus the user can’t get access to the network.
There are three parties to this process:
✦Authentication server: The server that veriﬁes the user has access to the
network.
✦Authenticator: The device that accepts the authentication request,
formats it properly for the authentication server, and relays the
information to the server and back to the user.
✦Supplicant: The client application making the authentication request.
Personally, I would have used a different term than “supplicant” but nobody
asked me. But that term sounds so powerless. Hmm, that may be the idea.
Large companies use a Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS)
server for authentication. This device keeps a central database of all authorized
users and their access rights to network resources. Servers of this type are more
complicated and expensive than the server appliances discussed in earlier
chapters.
This means the 802.1x process automatically means more money than any of the
wireless options discussed to this point. But a RADIUS server provides excellent
security and encryption for remote users, which is why almost all the large
companies use it.
You will need familiarity with the following terms when working with 802.1x:
✦Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP): Software to allow users to
add security features.
✦Message Integrity Checks (MIC): Also used by WAP.
✦Public Key Infrastructure (PKI): The security method using one public
key to make it easy for others to contact you, but the messages must
include a private key for decryption.
✦Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP): A proposed (by
Microsoft, Cisco, and RSA Security) extension to EAP and LEAP.
✦Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol (LEAP): Cisco’s
proprietary version of EAP.
✦Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS): Authentication
server software used to verify remote connections against a predeﬁned
database of users and allowed devices.
✦Pre-Shared Key (PSK): For those WPA users who don’t have a RADIUS
server.
www.it-ebooks.info

462 Part IV ✦Linking Your Network Devices
✦Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP): An enhancement to 128-bit
encryption.
✦Secure Sockets Layer (SSL): Most often used to encrypt trafﬁc to and
from Web sites.
✦Transport Layer Security (TLS): The upgrade to SSL.
✦Tunneled Transport Layer Security (TTLS): A proposed enhancement to
TLS that requires network-based security certiﬁcates and another type of
authentication such as passwords. Does the same work as LEAP, so many
experts feel TTLS is enough by itself.
✦EAP-TTLS: Another name for TTLS.
✦Advanced Encryption Standard (AES): Secret key cryptography using
128-bit, 192-bit, or 256-bit encryption keys. Replacement for Data
Encryption Standard (DES) and the upgraded Triple-DES security
standards.
Too many acronyms, right? Diving into serious security topics will require large
bottles of headache remedies close by.
This list should emphasize that 802.1x isn’t a magic security bullet, but a process
and framework on which to hang a variety of other security and authentication
services. The size and complexity of this list should drive home the point that
the simple security measures you read about for wireless networks, mainly SSID
changing and WEP, are far down the ladder of security products.
Here’s a breakdown of the security steps in a typical 802.1x-compliant system:
1. A user requests a network connection.
2. The router or access point takes the user information but blocks the user
from network access.
3. The access point forwards the user information to an authentication
server of some kind.
4. The authentication server approves the user and speciﬁes what network
rights the user is granted.
5. The access point opens a port for the user. Encrypted and dynamic WEP
keys are assigned to the client to use during the network session.
6. The user can access the allowed network resources over a secure
connection.
Pretty complicated, isn’t it? This reminds me of the old movies where a person
knocks on the door of a speakeasy during Prohibition and gives a password to
the guard through the small sliding door. If the boss says the visitor is cool, the
door opens. If the boss says the visitor is not cool, the guard kills him. Well,
maybe not. But at least the visitor does not gain entry unless authorized.
Prices are still high for implementing full-blown 802.1x authentication, and will
remain so for several years because of the need for a secure RADIUS

implementation. The wireless vendors are beginning to add support for 802.1x,
but you need both ends. When you upgrade, 802.1x should be ready and priced
low enough to be worthwhile.
Public Wi-Fi Access
The lure of the open road traveled with laptop in hand (or slung over shoulder)
proves irresistible to many. If you are one of those I’m happy for you. And if you
want to be as happy when you return as you are when you start your journey,
you must take some extra precautions.
You don’t really expect the coffee shop to include serious Wi-Fi security for your
latte over laptop, do you? The whole idea of public wireless access is easy
access.
This works great if you want to read the news over the Web with your coffee.
This works terribly if you want to read your e-mail, order something online, or
enter business information into your customer database back at the ofﬁce
Secure your laptop
Chapter 12 goes into details about ﬁrewalls and their importance to your
network. Yet at a coffee shop, you have no protection from any ﬁrewalls. So your
only choice is a personal ﬁrewall for your laptop.
Remember ZoneAlarm, from Zone Labs, Inc., (www.zonelabs.com)? They have a
free personal ﬁrewall available for download. This may be enough, or you may
want a full security suite. The more business you do while traveling with your
laptop, the more protection you need. Zone Labs offers upgraded products for
your laptop, as do McAfee and Norton. All three products include as much or as
little security as you want depending on your budget.
You may get personal ﬁrewall protection from another product you have.
Vendors of products like spam blockers and virus protectors often include
ﬁrewall functions as well.
If all this seems to be too much trouble, good luck. At least turn it on the by
clicking Windows XP Internet Connection Firewall (My Network Places ➪My
Network Connections ➪Local Area Connection ➪Properties ➪Advanced).
See Figure 17-13 for a quick reminder.

up ICF, click the “Learn more about Internet Connection Firewall” text in blue to

You’re not really protecting yourself from your fellow coffee drinkers, but all the
hackers and criminals on the Internet at large. After you connect past the coffee
shop, all security bets are off. Actually, all security bets are against you unless
you have speciﬁc protections like a VPN to connect back to your destination.

Figure 17-13: The least you can do is turn on Internet connection ﬁrewall.
Verify that your laptop wireless conﬁguration proﬁle says you’re in
Infrastructure mode rather than ad hoc mode. Ad hoc allows peer-to-peer
connections between clients rather than going to a router or access point. That
option can be helpful at times, but in a public place it allows another user to ride
along on your wireless Internet connection. If you’re happy with your speed and
believe this is neighborly, you may not mind. If you’re never happy with your
surﬁng speed and are more cautious, turn off ad hoc mode. You can do this on
the primary conﬁguration screen of your laptop’s wireless adapter, as shown in
Figure 16-5. This is a major setting, so it’s always easy to ﬁnd.
Be mindful of physical laptop security as well. Losing your laptop may be more
expensive than losing your wallet and credit cards. Get one of the security suites
that block access to your laptop hard drive and operating system until you
provide the password. Then please, please don’t put that password on a note
stuck in your laptop case.
Connect home safely
The safest way to collect your e-mail or connect back to your ofﬁce is through a
Virtual Private Network. Chapter 16 shows how to set one up using Windows XP
inside your wireless network to protect against eavesdroppers. Calling one up
from a coffee shop in another city requires more conﬁguration.
All the authentication barriers discussed earlier this chapter come into play
here. If you just want to read your e-mail online, this may seem burdensome.

I recommend that people host their e-mail servers, along with their Web servers,
outside their home or small business. Your broadband service provider may be
your primary e-mail vendor, and that usually works great. If you have another
e-mail service or want to get one, make sure they have secure Web mail support.
Just like e-commerce sites that encrypt your communications with their Web
sites using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), e-mail servers can do the same thing.
Figure 17-14 shows the Webmail login screen for www.BroadbandBible.com.
Figure 17-14: Notice the lock symbol indicating a secure, encrypted connection.
This Web site offers three different Web e-mail applications. The only thing I
don’t like about it is the need to select Secure Site to engage SSL. Many sites do
that automatically, so check if yours does or if you need to take an extra step to
gain a little peace of mind.
Watch for shoulder surfers when entering your e-mail service username and
password. Strange as it seems, some people like to read other people’s e-mail.
And once they get your e-mail username and password, they can send
anything to anybody using your name and account. That could turn out badly
for you.
Probably the best option when doing any real communications from a public
Wi-Fi access point is to use a Virtual Private Network from the beginning. If your
company supplies a VPN, you can make the connection back there, then surf
back out to the Web from that point.

If your home or small business broadband router is visible on the Internet, you
can establish a VPN back to your home network. Then you can get your e-mail
securely or traverse the Internet safely.
Several third-party VPN options for travelers now exist. One company seems
created exactly to answer this situation. How do I know that? They call
themselves HotSpotVPN (www.hotspotvpn.com). Figure 17-15 shows their

I haven’t had the occasion to use this product, but friends have recommended it

If you’re an Earthlink customer, you may be happy to discover they have an
agreement in place with Boingo to provide VPN service from thousands of
HotSpots. If you’re not an Earthlink customer but travel quite a bit, it may be
worth the extra dollars.
Regardless of how you make your connections from public access HotSpots, you
do need to consider security. Just popping on for a quickie will still cause your

Summary
Wireless security isn’t an oxymoron anymore, but it’s not without its challenges.
Luckily, the tools you may be buying for your home or small ofﬁce wireless
network will likely ship with Wi-Fi Protected Access support. If not, the vendors
probably offer a ﬁrmware upgrade to add WPA.
There are many people out there who believe it is fun to ﬁnd open wireless
networks. Some of those people are benign and honest. But if I were you, I
wouldn’t trust my security to the hope that the next wardriver who discovers
my network is benign and honest. I would trust my security to at least two layers
of enabled security procedures.

will change as well. So don’t think of this change as
trouble, but rather a chance to reconﬁgure and improve
your network.
Sometimes things on your side of the broadband
connection must be improved, and I’ll show you how to
ﬁnd and ﬁx those details. Sometimes, your broadband
service provider needs to improve their end of the
connection. I’ll tell you how to isolate the issue as much
as possible, and how to deal with service providers who
forget that their ﬁrst name is service.

verything technically endowed eventually
develops problems. Because you have a computer
before you get broadband service, you should
understand this situation. Most people realize that
things sometimes go wrong, and they accept that. But
making things right again doesn’t have to be as painful
as it often is today.
You learn in this chapter how to solve many of your own
broadband service problems. True, you pay for the
service and support, and you shouldn’t have to learn
how to do their jobs. But if you want more uptime and
fewer breakdowns, even when the problems aren’t your
fault, pay attention in this chapter.
Learning to solve your own access problems will get you
back online faster. Even more important, this chapter
will teach you how not to go ballistic when dealing with
two industries (cable and phone companies) who lead
the ineptitude parade when it comes to solving their
own customer service problems.
This chapter will cover the type of problems that fall
under the responsibility of your service provider. Many
of these issues you can’t resolve yourself. What you will
learn includes how to:
✦Document your system when things are working
well
✦Determine when the problem is caused by
something in your home or ofﬁce, or by the service
provider
✦Verify whether things are bad (slow service) or
worse (no service)
✦Troubleshoot e-mail service interruptions

✦Deal constructively with your service provider’s technical support lines
and personnel
✦Possibly isolate the troubled piece of hardware or software (sometimes
this is much tougher than just determining if it’s your problem or the
service provider’s problem)
Chapter 19 covers problems that occur on your side of the broadband
connection.
This chapter focuses on how to determine if the problem is on your side or not,
and how to work with your service provider to get the service up and running
again.
Common Problems and Fixes
Most people use their broadband Internet connection for the same types of
things: view Web pages, get e-mail, stream Internet radio, and IM friends. So
who’s to blame if Web pages are slow, your e-mail server refuses to deliver your
e-mail, your Internet radio station ignores you, and your Instant Messages aren’t
returned?
Wires only make good connections when they’re plugged in. And a mon-
itor with the brightness turned all the way down makes a computer look
dead when it’s not. I learned that the hard way.
Here are a few common areas of complaint for everyone, home and business
alike, and how you can determine if the problem is on your end or not. Knowing
the location of the problem will direct your next steps.
Viruses and other malware
Customer service organizations from major hardware and software vendors will
tell you a large number of support problems (from 12 percent to nearly half
depending on the source of the numbers) are caused by viruses and other
malware. Chapter 7 includes information you may want to review if your
computer suddenly starts acting weirder than it usually does.
New to the trouble-causing mix lately are increasing numbers of system-resident
applications called spyware that monitor actions and report back to some
remote site. Sometimes these are relatively benign, such as applications
verifying correct licensing remains in place (although privacy advocates claim
this goes too far). Sometimes the spyware is from spammers delivered as a
Trojan or worm and are tracking your system’s proﬁle to see if it will make a
good zombie (machine taken over by spammers to send spam without the
machine’s owner knowing or approving).
If your browser suddenly starts popping up sites you don’t want to see, resets
your home page, or redirects you to Web sites you don’t request, check quickly

for spyware and viruses. If you security software doesn’t include spyware
removal, check out these sites for help:
✦www.safer-networking.org
✦www.ﬁrewallguide.com/spyware.htm
✦www.javacoolsoftware.com
✦www.download.com and search for “online privacy”
You may have to run two or more different spyware eliminators to get all the
spyware.
Slow or dead Web pages
The ﬁrst thing to check is whether the problem exists on the one Web site you
want to view or all Web sites. If the remote Web server is having problems, you
won’t get good service no matter how fast your broadband connection delivers
packets.
Sometimes you get the equivalent of a bad phone connection to a Web page. If
the page creeps slowly to your computer, hit the Stop icon or the Escape key.
Then hit the Refresh icon or highlight the URL and press Enter. It seems silly that
reconnecting like this could deliver much faster service, but it happens regularly.
If the reconnect fails, try another Web site. I tend to use major sites with short
names for tests, like www.cnn.com, www.msn.com, and www.aol.com. These sites
generate lots of trafﬁc, so your service provider may have them cached (held in
memory for faster service) and you’ll get immediate response. Then you know
the problem is not with your computer or your service provider, but that Web
site.
Sometimes entire sections of the Internet go down because of a router failure
(rare, but it has happened). You may then be able to see Web sites in California
but not Seattle. Major Internet problems like this generally get ﬁxed in a few
hours, but there’s nothing any client can do about the situation.
E-mail disruptions
There are several ways your e-mail service may be disrupted, depending on your
e-mail server location.
Disruptions at your provider
If your service provider or a hosting company hosts your e-mail services:
✦The provider’s e-mail server may be down
✦Routing or DNS errors may isolate your e-mail server and make it
invisible to other e-mail servers
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
474 Part V ✦Troubleshooting
In the ﬁrst case, you won’t get any response from your e-mail server at all. Your
client will appear to work, but will time out waiting for a response from the
server.
In the second case, you can login and get e-mail from your server, but there is
none to get. With the amount of spam most people get today, not getting any
messages for an hour means there’s a problem. Two hours of no spam, blessing
though that may be, deﬁnitely means something broke and needs repair.
You may be able to send e-mail out because that’s often handled by a different
server. The ability to send e-mail and receive e-mail rely on two different servers,
and those servers may be in different physical locations, believe it or not. This is
often the case when your broadband service provider handles your e-mail
service.
You can’t ﬁx those problems. All you can do is wait until they get it back up
again, or call technical support. If my Web or e-mail servers aren’t up within
2 hours, I call the service provider and report the outage. This creates a trouble
ticket or incidence report (different companies call them different things) tied to
your particular e-mail server or account.
If all or a large part of the e-mail server is down, it will be restored as quickly as
your hosting provider can make it happen. Believe me, other people miss their
mail just as much as you miss yours, and they have ﬁled their own trouble
tickets.
It’s important to call after a couple of hours to force them to examine your
particular e-mail server or addresses. Sometimes not all addresses get restored
properly and the hosting provider doesn’t know that unless you tell them your
e-mail remains out. Sometimes a server outage may have affected relatively few
e-mail clients, and technical support only knows to look for your address when
you tell them to look.
One thing to check, if you have this option, is to try to read your e-mail via a Web
browser interface. Many providers offer a Web mail option. If you can connect to
your e-mail through your Web browser, that means the problem may be in your
e-mail client software or the POP3 software portion of your hosting provider’s
server. And if this works, at least you can check your e-mail while waiting for
your e-mail client problems to get ﬁxed.
Disruption at your site
There are two ways in ways in which an e-mail problem will be your
responsibility:
✦You host your own e-mail server
✦Your computer or e-mail client software has a problem
The ﬁrst case will only be an issue if you host your own e-mail server at your
home or ofﬁce. Many server appliances discussed in Chapter 10 include e-mail
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 18 ✦Troubleshooting Internet Access Problems 475
server software, and many programs are available to run an e-mail server on a
personal computer or small server.
If you have your own e-mail server, you can check it for proper operation. Reboot
the server, and verify all the parameters for communication between your e-mail
server and the rest of the Internet are set properly. Your service provider may
have entries in their router to handle part of that connection, so check with
technical support if your side looks functional but you still have no joy.
Most homes or home ofﬁces (and many small businesses) don’t host their own
servers, so the ﬁrst option won’t be cause for concern. There are still plenty of
details to check on e-mail clients, however.
The most important check when a problem arises is to discover what has
changed since the system worked correctly. This statement will be repeated in
later sections because it’s critical to troubleshooting.
You probably didn’t change a setting in your e-mail client manually, but that
doesn’t mean a setting didn’t change. Installed software, especially downloaded
modules for Microsoft’s Internet Explorer, sometimes makes changes to the
network conﬁguration ﬁles relied upon by your e-mail client software. If you use
Microsoft’s Outlook or Outlook Express, macros or Visual Basic applications can
execute within the e-mail environment and change settings.
First step is to verify your e-mail client settings are correct. Important settings
for an e-mail client include:
✦User name (may be just james or james@GaskinGuides.com)
✦User password
✦Mail server port number (default is 110)
✦Authentication setting (can be on but is usually off)
✦Mail server name for incoming messages
✦Mail server name for outgoing messages
Check each of these settings against the information provided by your service
provider. You will learn in Chapter 19 that documentation of such information
saves you time and trouble when something breaks, but this information should
be part of your signup package.
The second step is to close your e-mail client, and if you run Outlook or Outlook
Express, also close Internet Explorer. These programs interrelate in a variety of
ways you can’t see on the surface, so just closing one may not clear up the
problem.
If the e-mail client doesn’t work after restarting, you must reboot your computer.
Network connection problems in the computer will not reset when the e-mail
program restarts, so if the problem is in your network settings only a reboot will
reset those.

Network settings on your computer can stop your e-mail or Web browser
from functioning properly. Details on checking these settings are in Chap-

Working with Your Provider’s
Customer Service
At the end of October in 2003, the Yankee Group reported that 77 percent of U.S.
broadband customers were satisﬁed with their service provider. That’s a nice
statistic, until you turn it upside down. Looked at that way, nearly one in four
people were unhappy enough to report that in their survey.
Some of you are unhappy with your service from time to time. That’s the way life
goes. Unfortunately, vicissitudes of life seem to infect customer service
organizations as well, adding another potential annoyance. Some might say that
annoyance with customer service is a guarantee, not a potential. If you’re one of
those people, this chapter will help, I promise.
The ﬁrst thing every computer support technician asks when a computer stops
working is, “what changed.” When a computer stops working, statistics and
common sense say something on that computer changed.
Complicating this problem is Microsoft’s new push for automated updates. Yes,
this helps get security ﬁxes out to the public more quickly than any other
method. However, any change to your computer, no matter how small, has the
potential to mess up your computer in amazing ways.
All you can do is track the changes you know have been made to your computer.
But that helps only about half the time, because many service problems are
caused by or because of your service provider. The trick is to know which side
of your cable/DSL modem has the problem.
The ﬁrst time you deal with customer service, start a folder. Put every note they
send you, and every thing they tell you (transcribed by you after the call) into
this folder. Keep this folder close at hand every time you deal with your
broadband service provider. Referring to the folder will illustrate their service
habits, and eventually your folder will contain all the information you need to ﬁx
your problems without calling customer service.
Before you call for support
Calm down. Don’t call when you’re angry.
Calm yet? Then wait a little longer. If you’re mad when you start, the time spent
listening to bad music on hold will only make you madder.

Chapter 18 ✦Troubleshooting Internet Access Problems 477
Got control? OK, good. Now let me show you a variety of things you can do
before you call customer service. After all, if you don’t have to call, you don’t
have to wait on hold, and you’ll be back enjoying your broadband service sooner.
Here’s what you need to do before you call:
1. Reboot everything.
2. Update your drivers and ﬁrmware on devices.
3. Reboot everything again.
4. Check your settings.
5. Reboot everything again.
6. Gather all information provided by your service provider.
If the ﬁrst ﬁve steps listed above don’t work, perform the last step. Then get a
book or magazine and prepare yourself for dealing with customer service.
But the ﬁrst ﬁve steps solve more problems than you might imagine. So there’s
always hope.
Reboot everything
Electronic devices have a wonderful habit of waking up fresh and clean and with
a blank slate. No matter how badly an electronic device gets screwed up while
working, rebooting gives you a chance to start over.
Conﬁguration ﬁles and saved settings on electronic devices, particularly your
computer, take over when the system “wakes up.” Those settings are almost
always more reliable than the state of the system when it got so bad you turned
it off.
How to reboot one device
A reboot is more than just turning something off and turning it on again
immediately. To let your electronic device wake up fresh and ready to work
again, you must purge all remnants of the problem hiding inside the device.
Here’s how to reboot something properly:
1. Turn the system off (if you have a power switch).
2. Unplug the system from the power source (if you don’t have a power
switch, and even if you do).
3. Wait one full minute.
4. Plug the system in to the power source.
5. Turn the system on.

478 Part V ✦Troubleshooting
Seems like a lot of extra work, doesn’t it? Trust me, there are reasons for
everything here.
Why unplug the system? Two reasons. First, many cable/DSL modems and
associated routers don’t have a power switch. So your only choice is to remove
the device from power by unplugging it.
Unplug your device from the wall, not from the little power connector on the
back of the device. Why? When you slide the connector back on, you create
voltage spikes as the connector makes better and worse contact with the metal
inside the device power plug. Those spikes, small though they may be, can
cause a problem.
The second reason to completely unplug the device is to make sure no power stays
on inside the internal power supply if you have one. Even if you don’t have a com-
plete internal power supply, there are power control circuits inside your device.
You can tell if you have an internal power supply or an external one on your
device by looking at the power cord. If it’s a normal power cord, you have an
internal power supply. If it’s a wall wart or mid-cable brick, your power supply is
the brick part and is therefore outside.
When you leave the device unplugged for a full minute, you give the device
capacitors enough time to lose all their current as it bleeds away. You also give
time for any electronic gates and latches to lose power and return to their
normal state.
Wait a full minute. Patience is hard when you’re in a hurry to get the system
working again, but it can make a difference. Go get a drink or something so you
won’t be tempted to plug things in too quickly.
Do this for each and every device you reboot. Do it every time.
When you reboot a cable/DSL modem, you may receive a different IP address.
Most broadband providers assign IP addresses to their modems dynamically
when they join the network from a pool of available addresses. The chances of
getting the same IP address after rebooting is very small. Of course, if your
service providers assign you a speciﬁc IP address, that address will be used after
rebooting.
Rebooting connected devices
Now that you know how to reboot a single device (even if you don’t believe me
yet), let me tell you how to reboot all devices. This is your best troubleshooting
step with your service provider, especially when you do it correctly.
Here’s the sequence:
1. Turn off your computer(s).
2. Turn off your router.
3. Turn off your cable/DSL modem.
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 18 ✦Troubleshooting Internet Access Problems 479
4. Disconnect all the cables between the devices.
5. Wait one minute.
6. Reconnect all the cables between all devices.
7. Return the power to your cable/DSL modem.
8. Return power to your router.
9. Return power to your computer(s).
Some of this seems stupid and redundant. I know. But it can make a difference.
And your customer support person will demand you do this anyway. If you do
this right, you may avoid a call to that customer service person.
Update ﬁrmware and drivers
Why update drivers and ﬁrmware when things have been working? Because your
service provider may have updated drivers somewhere in its network chain, and
your old drivers start causing a conﬂict.
Tech Bits
Drivers are the software modules that ﬁt between the operating system
and hardware components such as the driver for your network adapter.
Stand-alone devices have ﬁrmware, which is a combination of hardware
drivers and the operating system all in one. You install a ﬁrmware upgrade
much like you install a driver.
No, this shouldn’t be necessary, but it often is. Vendors swear they test drivers
with existing equipment and older drivers and the type of devices they connect
to, but that’s hard to do. It’s nearly impossible for vendors to check every
combination of every software permutation on every device that may be
affected by their changes.
Security enhancements and updates drive many ﬁrmware updates today.
Sometimes what happens is a security parameter update on a network device
requires updates on connected devices. Many users update devices on a regular
basis to include the latest security enhancements. For an example, let me update
a Network Attached Storage device.
Figure 18-1 shows the screen to update the SnapAppliance 1100 storage
appliance. Notice they expect you to have the update ﬁle already downloaded.
Many devices expect this, but some are able to update themselves over the
Internet.
Of course, if you can’t get connected to the Internet, neither upgrade option will
be available to you (lucky this unit isn’t a router with a problem, so I still have
Internet access). So put “update devices” into your monthly to-do list so you’ll
be ready next time.
Router DHCP settings
Your router connected to your cable/DSL modem most likely uses either
Dynamic Host Control Protocol (DHCP) or a set of IP address (see the next
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

480 Part V ✦Troubleshooting
Figure 18-1: Updating a device from a previously downloaded ﬁle.
section). You have no control over the DHCP settings, because your router gets
them from your cable/DSL modem, which gets them from your service provider.
Although you can’t change these numbers, it will help your troubleshooting to
know what they look like when things are working. At least you’ll be able to
reboot your router and see if things change after doing so.
Figure 18-2 shows the Kanguru iNAS-100 combination storage device and
router’s DHCP settings. This device looks like others in that it can connect to
your cable/DSL modem using a variety of addressing options.
The important part of this page is that the Status shows Connected. There is an
IP address from the cable/DSL modem (24.0.103.139 in this case) and there is at
least one DNS Server IP address (204.127.202.4 and 216.148.227.68 in this
case).
See the Gateway address? That’s the gateway on your service provider’s side of
the connection. That’s how your connection reaches out to the Internet.
It’s important for your router to have DNS information. If your router lacks a DNS
Server IP address provided by your service provider, the ask/receive
handshaking between your router and your cable/DSL modem didn’t work.
If you don’t have DNS server IP addresses, you will get error messages when you
try and ﬁnd Web sites. But if you’re able to reach them when you put in the IP
address rather than their name (66.161.11.20 rather than Linksys.com) that’s a
good clue about a network problem indicating the URL name isn’t being
translated into an IP address. That will lead you to look at DNS settings, which
refer you to the DNS server to provide that translation.

Figure 18-2: How a working DHCP page looks to my service provider.
Chapters 11 and 19 show several ways to ﬁnd the IP address of your
computer and ping other systems on the Internet for troubleshooting.
Router Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet settings
You have more to do if your cable/DSL modem requires your router to use Point-
to-Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE). Chapter 10 showed initial router
conﬁguration with PPPoE if that’s what your service provider requires, and here
you want to make sure those initial settings haven’t changed. You don’t have to
do too much more than with a DHCP client setting for your router, but you do
have to give a username and password.
Your Internet service provider will give you the username and password you
must provide. Essentially, you’re setting up a connection via name and password
authentication (nice segue from the last chapter, right?). So your broadband
service provider will not accept your connection unless your name and
password (and the serial number of your cable/DSL modem, but they don’t tell
you that) matches their authentication database.
Figure 18-3 shows the Netgear WGT625 PPPoE screen for Yahoo! SBC DSL
service. It’s in the middle section toward the bottom.
Notice there are no DNS servers set. Yahoo! SBC provides those IP addresses
when I log in, so my router passes those addresses along to my clients with the

other DHCP information. To check them out using this router, I have to click My
Network Connections ➪Local Area Connection ➪Status ➪Support tab ➪
Details command button. I then see either my DNS server IP address, or the
address of my router if it provides that information acting as a proxy for a
remote DNS name server.
Figure 18-3: How a working PPPoE page looks to my service provider.
The critical information in this screen is your username and password. If they
aren’t there, or are incorrect, put them right and see what happens to your
network problems (they may go away).
Ready for a new problem? If you just received your SBC service, read what
Netgear has to say about one of its new DSL modems:
The SBC DSL modem SpeedStream 5100b, used on new DSL and
Yahoo SBC DSL installations since Feb. 2004, causes the NETGEAR
router Setup Wizards to fail, and prevents routers from connecting to
the Internet. This problem affects many router brands.
The modem can be distinguished from the earlier 5100 by a 5th light
labeled “Internet.”

Chapter 18 ✦Troubleshooting Internet Access Problems 483
representative, because the representative can only help you with this type of
problem if he or she knows exactly what you have at your end.
What you need to know when you call
First thing, and most important: focus on exactly what you want to achieve
through your conversation with customer service. If you can’t tell the person
answering the phone what you need in one sentence, keep thinking. Call when
you can boil it down to something like the following:
✦When will my service be restored?
✦Why is the network slow?
✦Who can authorize a refund for my service outage last week?
✦Why can’t I reach my mailbox using Webmail any more?
See those questions? Short, to the point, and the answers should be as short and
as focused. You may not get the answer you want, but a clear, short question
stands a better chance of eliciting a clear answer than some rambling question
hidden within a complaint or three.
Other things you must know when you call include every single number of any
kind your server provider gave you at your service installation. Any missing
number may lead to a delay in customer service help.
Take a look now at all the paperwork delivered by the installation technician or
mailed to you at the beginning of your service contract. Take a look at the
equipment you’re using. Customer service may want to know any or all of the
following:
✦Your name
✦Your address
✦Your phone number
✦Your billing address
✦Your service address (if different)
All these make sense for any type of service call. They need to know who you
are, and where you’re calling from. Those questions won’t take any preparation
on your part.
Next come the service speciﬁc questions. Be prepared to offer the following:
✦Your account number
✦You registration code
✦Your username (for this service)
✦Your service password (you called them, so it’s okay to answer a
question about your password)
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

484 Part V ✦Troubleshooting
✦Your cable/DSL modem brand and model number
✦Your cable/DSL modem serial number
✦Your client operating system and other system details
✦Any work order numbers still open
✦Any trouble report numbers still open
Will every customer service person ask you for these numbers? No. But if the
service representative can’t get a necessary number from you, he or she can
close the call and blame you for not having the information. Is that fair? No, but
that type of thing happens now and then. Customer service reps in some
companies are judged on the number of calls they close per hour, and cutting
you off for lack of a number helps their average.
I put everything a service provider ever gives me in a folder. Every new piece of
paper goes into that folder. E-mails sometimes get printed so I can put the paper
into the folder with the other paper.
This is a lot of trouble, but this information can be important. Your service
representative on the phone will have a troubleshooting script to follow. That
script will vary depending on the type of equipment you have. If you can’t
provide the information, reps can legitimately throw up their hands and tell you
they can’t help you until you can tell them.
They usually will try to help if you let them. This is where being polite makes a
big difference. If the service representative asks you about your cable/DSL
modem type and you can’t answer, ask if they can check it from their end.
Usually they can.
When facing a question I don’t know how to answer, I often turn it back to the
service representative. “Don’t you have that in your records?” That often works,
because they should have the information in their records. And if you are
positive nothing has changed, such as your cable/DSL modem or service
location, their information should be up-to-date enough to start working on the
problem.
What they won’t tell you
One thing that aggravates me is a company that pretends nothing is ever wrong
with its service or product, and I’m the ﬁrst person in 12 years who mentioned
that, say, its toilet paper umbrella melted in the rain. I know company
representatives feel they must “protect their brand” and look successful, but
hearing the truth now and then would be nice.
So don’t expect the service representative to volunteer much about service and
current problems. At least the decent ones will answer you more or less
honestly if you ask them a direct question.
Don’t expect them to tell you where they are. If you suspect your service call has
been routed to the Lower East Side of an Asian subcontinent, you’re probably

right. But some companies adamantly refuse to admit this. Phone reps are
provided with tips and information about the United States so they can try and
answer general questions. This problem isn’t serious, but it does get aggravating.
If you are connected to a service representative you can’t understand because of
a language problem, ask for a different representative. Rather than struggle
through trying to understand someone speaking a language (technical
networking) you don’t understand in an accent your can’t understand, bail out
and call back. The time on hold will be worth the aggravation, unless you’ve
waited an hour or more already. Then tough it out, but make the service
representative repeat everything until you understand.
You probably won’t get anywhere asking how much experience the service
representative has. That may sound important, but the smart service reps move
up fast. The ones who have been there a long time are the ones who can’t get
promoted or get a better job. Based on this, you should hope for someone smart
who’s on the way up.
Here are some other things they probably won’t tell you:
✦How large an area the current problem covers
✦How many other users are affected by the same problem
✦How long the problem has been going on
✦How long they expect to take to ﬁx the problem on their end
✦How localized is this problem is: one central ofﬁce? More? National?
What they won’t tell you doesn’t matter if they tell you the right answers quickly.
But the more they try to hide, the more suspicious I always get. If they can’t tell
me how widespread the problem is, I ﬁgure they’re clueless. That’s not a good
thing in your service provider. Knowing what’s going on is the kind of good
things I want to hear from my broadband customer service reps.
Dealing with Lousy Customer Service
A little empathy, please. Would you like a job where people called you up all day
and whined about things you didn’t cause and couldn’t personally ﬁx? Why do
you think they will be in a better mood than you would be in their seat and
telephone headset?
More than that, ﬁrst level technical support personnel (the ones who answer the
main toll-free support number calls) are generally the new hires and trainees.
Anyone answering the phones may be out of training that very day and you
won’t know it. They could also be stuck in an entry-level job without the smarts
to move up and get off the ﬁrst level support desk.
So have a little understanding for the poor girl or guy who answers your phone
call. Even if you’ve had to wait a while, they’re stuck there for the rest of their

shift. At least you get to hang up and go do something else. They have to pick up
another call, then another, then another, then another . . . all the rest of their time.
But all that is their problem, not yours. You have a problem or you wouldn’t be
calling. So let me outline ways to get better service.
Just remember the voice on the other end of the phone belongs to a person.
That person can help you or not help you with almost no worry of getting in
trouble if they give little effort and no help. But if you work with that person,
make them feel the two of you are partners in solving your problem, you’ll get
more help than you ever imagined.
How to complain effectively
First off, vent to your friends about how horrible your service is and how you’d
like to ﬁre everyone at your service provider for incompetence. Don’t vent when
you get on the phone, because you’ll only make matters worse.
Second (and repeated), know what you want to get done in your call, and focus
on that goal and only that goal. Do not bring up the problems you had last month
unless they are directly related. Do not bring up a news report you read on the
Internet about the service provider and their troubles. Do not complain about
the amount of spam in your e-mail box. This is not the time.
Focus on your goal for this call, and bring up nothing else.
If you rant and emulate a crazy person, you will be tagged as a weirdo by the
support staff and your complaints become the ravings of a lunatic rather than a
legit problem. Don’t give them an excuse to dismiss you as a nut.
Know what you want and say it clearly. Decide before you start if you:
✦Want your money back
✦Want a service charge to be erased
✦Want a policy changed because of the problems it causes you
✦Need a new cable/DSL modem
✦Want to cancel the service without a penalty
If you can’t put your compliant into a short, quick sentence like those above,
don’t call yet. Figure out exactly what you want and ask for that. Ask again if you
must. Ask a third time if you must, but don’t start adding related or unrelated
issues. Focus on what you want and say it clearly.
Be prepared to invest the time necessary to see your problem solved. If you have
a service problem, that should be solved relatively quickly. If you are looking for
a refund or other hard cash, you may need to ﬁll out forms, ﬁll out other forms,
then ﬁll out even more forms. If you want your money back, be persistent.

Here are some other suggestions and cautions you should follow if you’re going
to pursue something serious:
✦Be prepared for some BS and/or the runaround. Some companies do this
as a matter of course in a short-sighted effort to save money.
✦Be polite. Even if you’re aggravated inside, don’t rant, rave, or abuse the
service representative on the phone.
✦Get the service representative’s name. Sometimes it helps to go back to
the same person in a continuing problem. Sometimes it’s good to have a
name to tell people when a second service representative asks who told
you some information.
✦Keep notes, as closely and accurately as you can. Jot things down as you
talk and amplify those and ﬁll in the blanks as soon as you hang up.
These will help you through the initial customer service contacts. Most of the
time, one contact will solve your problem. Unfortunately, however, things don’t
always work out so neatly.

When problems become more serious or drag on longer, additional steps are
necessary:
✦Ask to speak to a supervisor. Ask for some type of assurance that the
“supervisor” isn’t the ﬁrst level customer representative sitting beside
your ﬁrst contact.
✦Ask the supervisor straight out if they have the authority to resolve your
issues.
✦If the answer to the above question is no, ask for the next level of
supervisor.
✦Do not fall for the old speech about “there’s nothing anyone else can do
for you.” Executives can always put things right when they get involved.
Tell the person you’re trying to escalate from you would like to hear the
executives tell you themselves your problem can’t be solved to your
satisfaction.
Local or regional consumer advocates, often associated with an area newspaper,
radio, or television station, may be able to help. Figure 18-5 shows the Web site
of Benjamin Dover, a long-time consumer avenger in the Dallas and Houston area.

Going past this point when demanding service or recompense for lack of service
from your broadband provider doesn’t happen often. There are two interesting

options presented by various consumer advocates. Luckily, I’ve never had to
resort to either one, and you probably haven’t (and won’t) either. But in case the
worst happens, there are the two escalated options.
✦Send certiﬁed letters, with cc: (copies) to the company’s PR director, the
local media, and the state attorney general. If the ﬁrst batch doesn’t
work, send another message, via certiﬁed mail, and include all the local
newspapers, radio stations, and television consumer reporters.
✦File a charge for the lost money in Small Claims court. The companies
have to appear or lose the judgment, and big companies hate to have a
long line of small court judgments make them look bad. State laws vary,
but you can’t argue about more than $5,000 in most states Small Claims
court.
Some people believe one or the other of these last two suggestions always work.
I can’t imagine you having to escalate a problem with a service provider to this
level, but stranger things have happened. At least now you know two more
options for complaint resolution of any kind.
Figure 18-6 shows “How to Complain” from the AARP (it used to be the American
Association of Retired Persons but they just go by AARP now). Not all of this ﬁts
service providers, but every bit helps.

The AARP also has information on buying safely over the Internet and helpful
forums for discussions. You don’t have to be a member to view their Web site or
follow their advice.
Working through their system
Every industry has “ways to do things” and the Internet service provider
business certainly falls into that category. But the business structure varies
greatly depending on who provides your broadband service.
Federal and city regulations play a great part in the control over telephone
companies (DSL) and cable franchises (cable). There are few technical restrictions
and no regulatory oversight for wireless and satellite service providers.
Some advice works for all service providers. For instance:
✦Be reasonable: You can’t expect a free month of service just because
they dropped your connection for a few hours, even if your child was
doing research for a paper due the next day.
✦Give them time to solve your problem: Large companies can’t drop
everything and handle your complaint. To you it’s critical but to them it’s
another in a constant ﬂood of complaints, all listed as Top Priority. Give
them a week or so before escalating your complaint process.
✦Make your point calmly and quickly: Customer service reps are busy
(perhaps overwhelmed would be a better term). Don’t rant. Don’t spew.
Boil your problem and expected resolution down to one or two sentences.
✦Treat the support representative like a person: If you want the person to
help you, don’t aggravate them at the beginning. The person answering
the phone did not personally screw up your billing, I promise.
✦Stick with the same representative for complicated problems: Send
correspondence to one person if you can get them to agree to receive it.
This eliminates the learning curve a new representative to your case
must undergo, and helps commit the representative to personally solving
your problem.
✦Personalize your situation: One ex-service representative reports a
funny or attention grabbing subject line in e-mails always helped her
mood. “Vanessa, HELP!” got her more personally involved than “You
idiots blew it again!”
✦Assure them you want to remain a customer: The cost of keeping a
customer happy is almost always less than the cost of replacing that
customer. If you’re not under a contract, reminding the representative
you really want to remain a customer may make a difference in the
resolution options at their disposal.
All companies have systems and internal rules regarding customer service. They
will not change their system to accommodate your complaint. If you work with
their system rather than ﬁghting it at every turn, you will spend less mental
effort and get better results.

DSL
The laws and oversight responsibilities for the telephone industry are changing
and twisting and trying to understand which new services to regulate and which
new services to not regulate. But the normal consumer rules of “sending copies
of all letters to the CEO” for public companies may not always work in a
regulated environment.
Rather than just a CEO as ﬁnal arbiter, regulated monopolies answer to federal,
state, and local boards and commissions. If things get bad, you can always send
copies to the telephone company’s CEO, and also the city Utility Board, the state
Public Utilities Commission, and even the FCC (Federal Communications
Commission).
If you’re dealing with an Independent Local Exchange Carrier (ILEC), they have
different regulatory burdens than the Regional Bell Operating Company (RBOC)
for your region. Making things worse, your ILEC and every other one in the area
must rely on the RBOC for all service installations, repairs, and modiﬁcations.
You can threaten to move your business from one ILECT to another. DSL service
in most cities includes multiple operators. Unfortunately, if the problem really
exists in “The Phone Company” in the region, no other DSL provider may be able
to make your situation much better.
Some ILECs have better service integration support with the RBOC than others.
Finding that information out before signing a contract is pretty much impossible.
Check personal references from others in your area (see the next major section
in this chapter for details).
Cable
Unlike the mess of regulatory oversight in the telephone company arena, cable
companies have a clear monopoly in each served area. Of course, now that
they’re starting to sell telephone service over their cable lines, they may start
being lumped into the telephone provider category one day.
Sending copies of problem documentation to the cable company CEO won’t help
much, because that person is in New York or Philadelphia and the like. These are
all huge companies and the chance of getting a positive response to a problem
from the Ofﬁce of the CEO rates as slim to none.
However, the local franchise must renew its contract with the city on a regular
basis. Customer service results and problem resolution ranks fairly high in the
criteria used by cities to award these contracts.
Look at your city’s Web site or phone book listings to ﬁnd the appropriate ofﬁce
overseeing the cable franchise. Copy all your problem documentation to that
city ofﬁce as well as to the cable company service department. Figure 18-7
shows an excellent example of this found by my friend Rima.
Notice the contact information for the city department overseeing cable service
for Foster City, CA, at the bottom of the screen. Your city has a department like
this as well. Get them involved, if necessary.

Alternative suppliers
If your alternative supplier is broadband wireless, you’re probably served by a
small company owned and operated in your region. When you call their
customer service line, the person you talk to may well be the person who
installed your service or even the owner of the company.
Small companies with small customer bases understand that keeping a happy cus-
tomer costs them far less in real dollars and goodwill than ﬁnding a replacement
customer. You can almost always solve your problems with a local broadband
wireless operator in a phone call or two and some reasonable conversation.
If your broadband wireless carrier believes they are too important to ﬁx your
problem and that they have you as a captive customer, they won’t survive for
long. The push for national ﬁrms to buy regional wireless operators has yet to
get rolling well, so you probably have a local company to deal with. If they won’t
deal with you, check out satellite.
The satellite vendors are huge, national (even global) companies. Their
customer service departments are just as large, and potentially inept, as the
cable and telephone companies. But their response to customer service requests
tend to be better according to anecdotal evidence. Your mileage may vary.
Be your own customer service representative
Want to be your own customer service rep? Talk to yourself with a bored voice,
don’t listen to your explanations of the problem, and put yourself on hold.

Now that you have that out of your system, start thinking like the service reps
you will call. After calling for help once or twice, you should know the drill by.
✦Reboot everything.
✦Update your drivers.
✦Check your system for a virus.
✦Reboot everything.
✦Wait for an hour for the service to ﬁnd the problem and ﬁx it.
✦Verify that your connection conﬁguration remains accurate.
✦Reboot everything.
✦Read a book.
✦Reboot everything.
When your service drops out or slows way down, there’s little you can do at
your end. For problems on your side of the cable/DSL modem, look at the next
chapter. But for problems under the control of your broadband service provider,
there’s only so much you can do.
Most of my aggravations with my cable service (AT&T taken over by Comcast)
has been due to some conﬁguration change on their side or lack of service. The
good news is that rebooting (properly) my cable modem usually catches up to
the conﬁguration changes.
Every time I’ve called about a complete lack of service they already know there’s
a problem (usually caused by them). I’ve never had a situation where my service
only was affected by a cable problem. So if you want to wait for a bit, your
service provider will likely ﬁx the problem themselves.
If you lease your cable modem from your service provider, see if you can get it
updated. I got an old model when my service was installed and any conﬁguration
change on their end confused the cable modem into paralysis. After the old unit
was replaced with a modern one, my connection speed increased and outages
decreased.
Be your own customer service representative and order a new cable/DSL
modem from your service provider. That may provide a surprising amount of
problem relief.
Power in numbers: Enlist other subscribers
You are not the ﬁrst user on your broadband service to have the problem you’re
having. Other users solved the problem vexing you, and some of them are happy
to help you solve your problem. In addition, when a large group of users has a
problem with a service provider, the service provider pays much more attention.
Almost every service provider (and all the large ones for sure) include forums
where users can get together and discuss “issues” with their service and other

problems. It’s amazing how much support you can get from a group of
customers using the same service you use.
On Comcast.net Broadband forums, for example, you can read dozens of
complaints about promised speed upgrades that have yet to happen. Will the
speeds increase? Probably so, but the schedule remains under control of
Comcast. Can you get good info reported by other users who have talked to
technical support people and others in the know? Absolutely.
Quick hit: Example sites
I believe the most unbiased reports (but take them under advertisement rather
believing them automatically) come from third-party sites who have no
afﬁliation with the services being discussed. One of the best of these is

Don’t forget your vendor pages. Most of the major vendors offer multiple pages
of information on their Web sites, if only so you don’t call their technical support
lines for simple questions. Take advantage of this information.
If your broadband service won’t function, you can’t reach vendor Web
sites to get the information. That’s a classic Catch-22 (thank you, Joseph
Heller). But most service providers also offer dialup for emergencies. Look
at your documentation, or call their help lines and listen for an option to
get dialup numbers in your area. It will be slow, but it will work. Or, you
can go to a neighbor and borrow their computer. This is more sociable
and more fun than waiting for dialup.

little time tracking details and writing them down for later use will help you pass
the pop quiz later. Excuse me, I mean help to prove to your customer service
representative there may be a problem with your network on their end of the line.
Track normal performance
You must know what normal performance is so you know when you receive
abnormal performance. The only way to know what type of performance you
have is to keep track now and then.
The ﬁrst thing you should do is look at your cable/DSL modem and see which
lights are on. You should have labels on your lights saying some or all of the
following:

Chapter 18 ✦Troubleshooting Internet Access Problems 497
✦Power
✦Ethernet
✦DSL
✦Activity
✦Sync
✦Ready
✦Send
✦USB
✦Receive
Not all cable/DSL modems will have all the lights. My DSL modem, for example,
has only four (Power, Ethernet, DSL, and Activity). Normally the ﬁrst three lights
stay on solid and the Activity light blinks as trafﬁc goes through the DSL
connection. There’s not a power light.
My cable modem has a power light, as well as six more: USB, Ethernet, Send,
Receive, Sync, and Ready. Either the USB or Ethernet lights are on, depending on
how you connect to the modem, but not both. The Power light stays on if the
modem is connected to a power supply (there’s no on/off switch). The Ethernet
light blinks when there’s trafﬁc on the local network. The Send light blinks with
trafﬁc going out through the cable modem, and the Receive light blinks with
trafﬁc coming back. The Sync and Ready lights stay on solid when I have a good
connection to the Comcast network.
Basic? Yes, but if my cable modem doesn’t show both Sync and Ready, I reboot
it. Same for my DSL modem with the DSL light—if that’s missing I know I don’t
have a good connection to Yahoo! SBC.
A small program called ping does a great job loosely tracking network
performance. This isn’t the tool you want to rely on for high-end throughput
analysis, but it can tell you how quickly your network responds under normal
conditions.
Figure 18-11 shows a DOS window or Command Prompt in Windows XP parlance
with the results of a ping test on my Comcast network. I’m on a Comcast
network, so there should be nothing to delay packets or interfere with my
network connection.
To run this program, click Start ➪Run and type cmd in the text ﬁeld that
appears. That opens the DOS window.
At the command prompt, type ping and the name of your service provider. In my
case, on this network, it is Comcast.net. So I type “ping comcast.net” and press
Enter.
You can vary a number of ping parameters. I used a conﬁguration switch to tell
the ping command to send a total of 10 pings rather than the default four pings.

If the host being pinged doesn’t respond to the ping by replying in the proper
way to the ping request, the ping request fails. There’s no difference in the ping
results of a hidden site than from a host that doesn’t exist, at least until the ping
application reports that the domain name lookup system failed to ﬁnd the
domain name you typed.
Do a ping test now and then and keep an idea of the normal ping delay. It doesn’t
matter if your number is 30 milliseconds or 50 or 150, as long as they stay in the
same range (Okay, 150 ms is too long if you’re connected to that network.)
When you feel the network is slow, run a ping test. That will tell you a general
state of Internet health, or at least the heath of the stations you ping.
If you don’t have a domain name for a site, you can use the IP address. This is a
great tool for checking the response of your wireless clients around your own
network as well.
The other tool many network administrators use to check whether a problem is
located in their network or somewhere on the Internet is Trace Route, shortened
by Microsoft to tracert. This also uses a DOS window and provides even less
visual excitement and more confusion than ping, so let’s skip right to a graphical
trace route utility.
Unusual for a computer tool name, this program actually traces the route
a packet takes through the Internet to reach the deﬁned destination. If
a Web site you really want to see disappears one day, a trace may tell
you where the trail ends, although as an end user you can’t do much.
Network administrators at a service provider can do plenty with trace
route, however.
Figure 18-13 shows HyperTrace from AnalogX (www.analogx.com), a site with
networking and programming tools and music (appropriate for a broadband
book, don’t you think?). This utility is about as fast as the DOS command-line
version and easier to use.
No packet loss in our sample, which is good. Notice the longest response time
came from what look to be routers past the West coast trafﬁc hub (SJC.gblx
.net) into what is probably the Phoenix AZ area (PHX1.bglx.net).
Checking on your provider’s performance
People loooooove speed. NASCAR’s big, the 100 Yard Dash (okay, 100 Meter
Dash) fascinates us at track meets, and Andy Roddick hit a serve 150 mph (241.4
kmph) at the 2004 Davis Cup First Round in Connecticut on February 6. And
broadband users love their speed, too, which is why they want to test it and
verify it all the time.
The largest collection of speed tests I can ﬁnd on the Internet is at
BroadbandReports (www.broadbandreports.com). They have collected over
220 speed tests available for free, and have other tests and monitoring services

Of course, there’s always a disclaimer. Speeds from much distance across the
Internet are more a test of the bottleneck situation than of true speed. That’s
why I picked a speed test fairly close to me. Take a look at Figure 18-14 to see my
speed test on a Sunday afternoon.
I found this test site by going to Broadband Reports, and clicking the Tests and
Tools left menu. The resulting screen has a button at the top labeled Speed Tests.
One of the major Internet portals, CNet, also offers a speed test. They aren’t near

Figure 18-15 to see how much slower.
Not quite as fast, is it? Conditions on the Internet change quickly, but most
important, the more hops you go through the more chance for delay. Just like
when you drive across town and catch trafﬁc lights, isn’t it? Except in the real

They may be able to offer ways around your problem, or they may know of other
service providers who have a better service record.
Start replacing equipment. Your broadband provider should supply your
cable/DSL modem (for free or a few dollars per month) and suspect devices
should be replaced. If your router seems to ﬁght with your cable/DSL modem,
you can try another router. That’s the kind of service that a local consultant or
network expert can provide using a test router so you don’t have to buy one.
If worst comes to worst, you can change your broadband service provider. This
isn’t fun, but you have little choice. If you’re using DSL, another independent DSL
reseller may have better luck getting the local phone company to do its job. Or
you may need to contract with the phone company directly.
Don’t pay for bad service. If you can’t get what you need from your current
provider, switch and don’t feel bad. They didn’t feel bad messing you around, so
you shouldn’t feel bad waving goodbye.
Summary
Bad service makes everyone mad. Bad customer service makes everyone even
madder. But mad, angry customers don’t get good customer service from
anyone.
Before calling customer service, go through the reboot procedures for all
devices. Check your settings. Understand that the Internet sometimes clogs up,
like any other highway, and give things a few minutes to settle down before
calling technical support.
Make sure the problem is not on your side of the broadband connection before
calling technical support. And even when the tech asks you to do things you’ve
already done, do them anyway because for some reason that often helps.
When you’re having a problem with your service provider, take it easy, focus on
what you really want, and keep that goal in mind. Customer service ineptitude

should not deter you from your goal. When you start to lose your temper,
remember that although that’s a natural reaction, it won’t help you get your
problem solved.
Eventually, you will learn to solve your own problems. That’s the best customer
service of all.

ll the things that go wrong are not on the far side
of your cable/DSL modem. Unfortunately, things
go wrong on your side of the demarcation point, and you
are the customer service representative for your
network.
Luckily, when things jump the track a few common
problems seem to be the culprits in many cases
(changes due to newly-installed software, network
conﬁguration changes, and misbehaving applications).
Once you learn how to deal with some of the common
issues, you’ll be able to solve the majority of your
network problems.
These are the types of issues you will soon learn to
troubleshoot and conquer:
✦Physical connections
✦Identifying out-of-control applications
✦Network settings that changed
✦Network link status
✦Wireless connection weirdness
Troubleshooting goes much easier if you remember
what I consider the most important rule: change one
thing at a time. If that doesn’t help, change it back and
change something (one something only) and try again.
The trying again part may be the second most important
rule, because the best troubleshooters understand they
may have to check a dozen settings before ﬁnding a
resolution.

Common Computer and
Network Problems
The ﬁrst question to ask when a computer stops working is, what changed?
Many times a software change of some type made a mess of something else, and
your lovely computer is now an object of scorn.
Software changes can be as large and noticeable as installing a new application
or as small as a minor upgrade to a utility program. Microsoft Windows updates
fall into this blame bucket. Automatic updates are great, but when they clobber
something else it’s tough to uncover the cause of the problem and even tougher
to ﬁx.
If you aren’t sure if your Windows XP system is updating automatically,
open Start ➪Control Panel ➪System and click the Automatic Updates
tab. Here you can tell the system to not update at all, update automati-
cally every day, or download updates and ask your permission to install
those updates. The last option is the one I use, so I know when an update
causes a problem.
Anytime you’re surﬁng on the Internet and you accidentally download some
application and things stop, you know what happened. Fixing that mistake takes
more effort. Unfortunately, the relationship between loading something you
shouldn’t and seeing the effects are rarely that obviously linked.
System Restore Before You Need It
Windows XP Home and Professional include System Restore in an easy-to-use
and reliable form. None of the system restore functions available through various
methods in earlier Windows versions worked easily or all that reliably.
System Restore has a variety of options. Some are automatic, and some you can
set. Make a habit of saving a system restore point before you install new software
and you’ll curse much less when an application doesn’t work the way it should
and clobbers your personal settings or network conﬁguration.
Reach System Restore by going through Start ➪Programs ➪Accessories ➪System
Tools and choosing System Restore. From the main screen you can restore your
system back to an earlier restore point, or set a new restore point. Remember
this step and do it before installing new software or making major conﬁguration
setting changes.
The only bad news is that System Restore requires hard disk space. If you’re running
low, be careful. You may have to turn off System Restore if it keeps reinstalling a
system ﬁle that has been contaminated by a worm or virus. And please don’t use
this as a backup tool, or you’ll be crying. Chapter 13 has the backup information,
so use System Restore for installation recovery but not ﬁle protection.

Add anything to your computer? Even a new mouse with special drivers and
programmable buttons can interfere with other software.
Did your antivirus application perform a live update? Turn the antivirus software
off (but don’t download anything when it’s off) and see if your problem clears
up. You may have to reboot your computer and leave the antivirus software off
to make the ultimate test.
Tools for system examination
You might want to take a look at the Task Manager application. Shown in
Figure 19-1, the Task Manager can be accessed by right-clicking the task bar at
the bottom and choosing Task Manager from the context menu. You can also
press Ctrl+Alt+Delete to summon Task Manager (with Windows 2000 you had to
press Ctrl+Alt+Delete and choose Task Manager from that context menu, but
now the shutdown options are in the Task Manager).
Figure 19-1: The tasks running on my Windows XP Home PC.
The other pages in Task Manager are useful, but I ﬁnd myself looking at this
screen, Processes, most of all. All software modules from Windows and third
parties show up here, along with applications and their helper ﬁles.

508 Part V ✦Troubleshooting
These processes are programs executing on the computer. Some of these you
can recognize easily, such as the well-labeled Mirra.Client.exe and
Mirra.Service.exe programs about halfway down the list. Those are the
memory-resident programs used by the Mirra Personal Server discussed in
Chapter 13. These two applications keep an eye on all your ﬁles and copy the
changed ﬁles to the server automatically.
The list in Figure 19-1 is sorted by application name, although Microsoft calls it
Image Name at the top of the list. When you click any of those headings (Image
Name, User Name, CPU, or Mem Usage), the list sorts according to the
information in that column.
Whenever something seems to be eating all my CPU cycles, I open Task Manager
and click the CPU heading. This puts the highest CPU hog at the top of the list.
When things are going well, that item should be the System Idle Process at
around 90 percent. If a program is hung, monopolizing the CPU, it will appear at
the top of the list.
Tech Bits
Think of this as target practice: highlight the memory hog by clicking its
name. This makes it easy to follow that application as it bounced around
because the highlight bar stays on the name.
When you ﬁnd the program sucking all your CPU cycles away and highlight it,
you can then stop that process by clicking the End Process button in the
bottom-right corner of the Task Manager. You will probably have to verify you
really want to kill that process.
If you check the Applications tab for the Task Manager, you will see the names of
primary applications running on your Windows system. If you know one of the
applications is causing your problem, it may show up in that list as
nonresponsive. If so, you can end that task using the End Task button.
Most often, however, a subprocess of an application will be causing your
problems. The only way to ﬁnd that process is to use the Processes page as
shown in Figure 19-1.
Drilling down to more details for the services requires using a second program
called MSConﬁg. A program that Microsoft doesn’t advertise, MSConﬁg, helps
you control all the startup parameters and show you more details about the
processes for your computer. Figure 19-2 shows the main screen of MSConﬁg on
Windows XP Home.
Booting problems and troubleshooting is tough. If your computer boots
completely but doesn’t act right afterwards, you can use MSConﬁg to try a
diagnostic startup, or select which system services and conﬁguration proﬁles
are run during startup.
If you check the Services tab, MSConﬁg will show you manufacturer of all the
services on your system. One handy option is to check the box labeled Hide All
Microsoft Services so you can see just the third party services installed on your
system.

Chapter 19 ✦Troubleshooting Your Side of the Connection 509
If you check the Startup tab, MSConﬁg will show you the location of the ﬁles that
launch the services during the boot process. Applications you never heard of
may be spyware or virus related, and you can uncheck the listing for those
services and boot without them to see if that solves any aggravating
problems.
Figure 19-2: Conﬁguring startup options on Windows XP Home PC.
Start MSConﬁg, which is ofﬁcially the System Conﬁguration Utility, by clicking
Start ➪Run and type msconﬁg. Alternately, you can go to the File menu on Task
Manager and choose New Task (Run) to open the same text ﬁeld in which you
type msconﬁg to start the application.
The default is for the Normal Startup radio button to be clicked, but I clicked the
Selective Startup to make the ﬁve listings underneath that option active. That
made them dark enough to read in the screenshot.
This utility makes it possible to turn off a new driver or service (or driver
launched by a serverice) you suspect of causing problems. You can also use this
utility to launch System Restore from the command button in the bottom-middle
of the page.
Bottom-up network troubleshooting
Some advocate the bottom-up method of network troubleshooting. There’s a lot
to recommend this, particularly because some of these items are easy to check.

510 Part V ✦Troubleshooting
Essentially, you want to start at the lowest, most basic part of the computer or
network process and verify the easy things are done correctly. Whatever you
think is the beginning level, go down more.
The “bottom” of this method is the bottom of the seven-layer protocol stack.
Guess what’s at the bottom: the physical layer. You want to make sure everything
is connected to the appropriate device. Every plug goes somewhere, and taking
the time at the start of your troubleshooting session to verify a plug didn’t fall
somewhere will save you time in the long run, I promise. This approach is like
making sure you car has gas before calling the garage to get your engine
repaired.
Go through the following checklist when a computer refuses to cooperate at all,
or doesn’t want to play on the network anymore:
❑Is the computer plugged in?
❑Is the monitor plugged in?
❑Is the monitor brightness turned up?
❑Is the monitor plugged into the computer?
❑Are the keyboard and mouse plugged into the computer?
❑Is the network patch cable plugged into the computer?
❑Are all the hubs, routers, or switches still turned on?
❑Is the network patch cable plugged into the wiring hub, switch, or router?
❑Are the rest of the network cables plugged in on both ends?
❑Are some computers working but not others?
❑Are all the computers showing the same symptoms?
❑Can the problem computer see any of the other network devices through
My Network Places?
❑Did your cat step on the keyboard?
❑Have you replaced the cable in question with one you know works?
❑Have you rebooted the computer in question? Completely cold-booted,
where you turn it off for a full minute before restarting?
These things sound stupid, don’t they? Every one has roots in real situations. I
once drove across town in a snowstorm (granted, Dallas snowstorms aren’t
exactly Rocky Mountain blizzards, but still. . . ) to turn the monitor brightness
back up on a system. It took more time to slide across town than it did to ﬁgure
out the problem by using the bottom-up method. That’s when I became a
convert to this process.
Cables must be plugged in to work properly, and mysterious forces will pull
cables out at the strangest times. You may think it’s demeaning to make sure a
power cord still connects properly to the wall socket, but that’s only because
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 19 ✦Troubleshooting Your Side of the Connection 511
you haven’t kicked a power cord out accidentally, then spent hours wondering
what went wrong.
Look at the 10/100Base-T plugs on the computers. The connector should light up
when signals are seen on the network (most plugs include at least one light).
Corresponding light(s) should be active on the port of the connected hub or
router. If one side is not lit, that side has a problem. If neither side is lit, try a
new, known-working 10/100Base-T cable.
One thing you need to agree to right now: if you can ﬁnd an easy workaround to
a problem, you’ll accept it. That sounds weird, but trust me this will make more
sense after you read through this chapter.
Consultants sometimes quote two prices: one to get the system working again,
and a second higher price to explain exactly what happened to cause the
problem. Trying to understand why Windows or the network went screwy after
it worked ﬁne for weeks will only lead you to start pulling your hair out. When
you can use Plan B to make things work again, don’t let Plan A haunt you. Accept
it and move on.
Common TCP/IP Problems
Once you’re fairly sure the physical layer network details are under control
(everything’s plugged in and turned on), you can start up the protocol layers in
TCP/IP. There are two critical things to check for TCP/IP at a client:
✦TCP/IP is enabled and functioning in the client itself
✦TCP/IP packets can get out of the clients onto the network.
Yes, TCP/IP can be working on the client although the network adapter (wired or
wireless) isn’t working. So there are several places to verify how TCP/IP is doing
inside your computer and out to the world.
The ﬁrst place to check is the Local Area Connection icon in My Network Places
(Network Neighborhood in Windows 9x/ME). If things are working there, as they
are in Figure 19-3, you’re in good shape.
Reach this screen by clicking My Network Places ➪View Network Connections
➪Local Area Connection ➪Status ➪Support tab ➪Details.
Some people may stop at the Local Area Connections Status screen, but that’s
not going far enough. Figure 19-4 shows the Status screen General page from
within the linked windows shown in the previous ﬁgure.
It’s nice to see that the network connection in Figure 19-4 is working and sending
and receiving packets. But that doesn’t tell me that those packets can get out to
the Internet.

Chapter 19 ✦Troubleshooting Your Side of the Connection 513
The important details in Figure 19-3 in the Details window show the following:
✦The connection has a valid IP address in the correct address range (from
your DHCP server)
✦The Subnet mask matches the rest of the systems on the network (from
the DHCP server)
✦The Default Gateway is the right address (the router connected to your
cable/DSL modem)
✦The DHCP server provided an address lease covering the time this
display was checked
✦DNS server IP addresses are listed
Your service provider’s modem will send the Domain Name System (DNS) server
IP address to your router, which should pass it on to your network clients along
with an available IP address for your client. The IP address shown in Figure 19-3
must be within the range for your internal network, and will be assigned by your
router/DHCP server. The time for the lease will be provided by your DHCP server
at the same time.
If all these details are correct for a client your network should be working
properly.
Checking inside your computer
First verify that your computer has an IP address assigned permanently to it, or
has the correct instructions to receive an IP address from a Dynamic Host
Conﬁguration Protocol (DHCP) server. Figure 19-5 shows the Internet Protocol
(TCP/IP) Properties window where you set that IP address choice. I suggest you
use your router to supply internal IP addresses and hide the public address
using Network Address Translation (NAT), so you should verify the setting here
requests and IP address.
Reach this screen by going to My Network Places ➪View Network Connections
➪Local Area Connection ➪Properties. Highlight the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)
item in the middle section of the screen and then click Properties. When you
click the Obtain An IP Address Automatically radio button you have a choice to
set the DNS server address automatically (top radio button) or set a particular
DNS server address (bottom radio button).
If you choose to supply an IP address in the top part, you must supply the DNS
server address. You may use only a single DNS server address, but using two
provides redundancy in case one goes down or slows down so much it might as
well be dead. Requests for DNS support from the ﬁrst server that go unanswered
after about 3 seconds will fail over to the second choice without your knowledge
or involvement
There are two more things to check in general for your client’s TCP/IP health.
Both of these require going to a DOS window (or CMD program) to run the ping

514 Part V ✦Troubleshooting
Figure 19-5: Telling this computer to rely on a DHCP server for its IP address.
program. Ping is a diagnostic utility that relies on the Internet Control
Management Protocol (ICMP) standard that provides a way to sort of knock on
the door of a network device and see if it’s home. In other words, an easy tool to
tell you that your computer’s TCP/IP software is working correctly, that the
remote device is alive, and the network connects the two of you. Figure 19-6
shows them both in two connected operations.
To open a DOS window, click Start ➪Run. Type cmd and then pressEnter.
Type ping 127.0.0.1 ﬁrst. The address 127.0.0.1 is known as the localhost and is
the assigned IP address for the computer’s internal network. You see, in the ﬁrst
part of the information in the DOS window that the 127.0.0.1 address responded
to each ping.
The second task is to check the IP address of the network interface card used in
the computer. Earlier I saw that this address was 10.0.1.50 (assigned by a DHCP
server and shown in Figure 19-5). I pinged that address, and it told me the
network interface board was operational.
Some Web sites turn off their response to pings as part of their security
controls against hackers. Several of the diagnostic tools related to ping
can be used to disrupt devices. If you don’t get a ping back from a big
company (www.ibm.com, for one example), that’s the reason.
When things are going badly, and the computer’s internal network or the
connection to the rest of the world (and the DHCP server) is broken, Microsoft

assigns an IP address to the computer for you. You will ﬁnd this out when you
can’t reach anything else on your network or the Internet, and ping doesn’t
work out to other devices although it works internally to the local host
address.
Unfortunately, the IP address makes no sense with any other network and is
hard to reset. Figure 19-7 shows what happens if you start your network when a
cable is missing.
Yes, that’s the sign of network failure. When you see this, you will curse and sigh
and start troubleshooting.
So far (ignoring the last ﬁgure), everything in this computer used as an example
works ﬁne. I’ll show you options in the next few sections to pursue when things
don’t look this nice.
Checking outside your computer
The same ping command used to check your internal network available works
outside as well. Figure 19-8 shows a ping of the network router (10.0.1.1) and an
Internet site (www.BroadbandBible.com).
10.0.1.1 is the router on all my networks. Putting the router for the network at
the ﬁrst address number is a long network tradition that’s hard to break. And
because it provides an excellent starting place and locates the router on all
networks, it’s a good tradition to keep.

The second ping is out to the Internet. Notice that the ping command returned
the IP address of the Web site named in the ping. That can be handy as you’ll see
in a bit.

Notice the response times for this connection: 84ms-90ms. Those numbers aren’t
too bad, and they’re fairly consistent, which shows the trafﬁc is ﬂowing smoothly.
Going to the DOS prompt bothers some people, and the basic ping also lacks a
discovery mechanism. That’s why I searched for and found two third-party tools
that make ping much more useful.
The ﬁrst tool, Ping-O-Meter is from Obese Amadillo Software. Take a look at it in
Figure 19-9.
Figure 19-9: A much prettier face on the ping command.
Go to www.ObeseArmadillo.com or www.Download.com to download this free
utility. This version offers multiple upgrades over the original, and even the
earliest version makes ping more fun than ever before.
Take a look at the Min. and Max. numbers under the dials. Notice the Maximum
dial is 330ms. You can see I ran Ping-O-Meter for 50 requests, and at least one
round trip had a router hiccup somewhere that slowed down a packet by a
factor of four. That happens, and doesn’t indicate a problem for just a few
packets. And because it’s out somewhere on the Internet, you can’t do anything
about it anyway.
Because the ping command lacks a discovery mechanism, if you have a large
network, or even a handful of network devices, tracking their IP addresses can
be a pain. Do you write them down on a piece of paper you can lose? How do you
www.it-ebooks.info

ﬁnd the ones assigned by your DHCP server until you ping each possible
address individually?
You get Advanced IP Scanner from Famatech, LLC. (www.Famatech.com).
Figure 19-10 shows the scanner at work on one of the test networks.
Figure 19-10: Finally, a ping discovery program that works well.
This application pings every address within the range you set (see the range
setting just under the advertisement for Famatech’s Remote Administrator
package). Responses are further interrogated for details such as name,
workgroup, Media Access Control (MAC) address, and comments listed on the
system. You can right-click any live device and drill down for more details.
I don’t need to do that in this situation. I’m only looking for computers that
should be up and running and connected to the network. If I don’t see a device I
expect to see, I can go to that one unit and start troubleshooting.
DNS hiccups
When Domain Name System (DNS) service is not available to a client computer
or it can’t make connection to the DNS server at your service provider, you can
do many things on the network, but you can’t resolve names. DNS changes
64.68.6.131 (hard to remember) to www.SoundClick.com (easy to remember).
If you can’t get to Web sites with a URL, but everything else looks good, try
putting in just the IP address. If you make connection then, you know one of the
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 19 ✦Troubleshooting Your Side of the Connection 519
following is true: You can ﬁnd the IP address for a host by typing ping and the
host name in a DOC command box as shown in Figure 19-8.
✦Your listed DNS servers are unreachable.
✦DNS isn’t conﬁgured correctly on your client.
Of the two options, the latter one turns out to be correct more often than not
because your service provider keeps their DNS servers available at all times. In
this case, disable your network connection in the My Network Connections page
(right-click on the Local Area Connection then choose Disable in the context
menu). Then enable the device after about 30 seconds of delay by clicking the
Local Area Connection icon.
Your computer should then make contact and get new information from the
DHCP server on your network. If that doesn’t work, your DHCP server is having a
problem, which almost always means your router to cable/DSL modem
connection is having a problem as well. That means it’s time to read a book until
your broadband service provider gets its part of the connection working again.
DHCP timeouts
Check your DHCP server for the default lease time if stations start doing weird
things every few hours, or at the same time every day. Some applications and/or
update levels of Windows don’t do well when their DHCP lease expires and they
must reclaim their IP address. Figure 19-11 shows an example of setting the
DHCP lease time.

device/router.

520 Part V ✦Troubleshooting
This Tritton device sets the lease time in minutes rather than hours or days. An
unfortunate trend today in many DHCP server devices is to set the default lease
time to one day and not let you change that default. The way you ﬁnd that
disturbingly short lease time information is to check the client properties as in
Figure 19-3.
If your DHCP server stops and a station tries to reclaim its lease, it will fail. Then
the Microsoft IP default address will be applied and you’ll know the DHCP
service is the culprit.
Game playing and connection help
Vendors making networking products for home use understand that game
players require some special treatment. Each vendor has some information
about games and other applications that need a way through your ﬁrewall
through speciﬁc port assignments. Some vendors, however, tend to give a bit
more than others.
Netgear has a wealth of information. Go to http://kbserver.netgear
.com/main.asp and Search for “games” for a complete listing. However, the
Knowledge Base article n11495 may answer all your gaming questions:
kbserver.netgear.com/kb web ﬁles/n100495.asp.
Just like Netgear, Linksys and SMC have information available. Follow these links:
✦http://kb.linksys.com/cgi-bin/om isapi.dll?clientID=1358622
and search for “games”
✦http://www.smc.com/index.cfm?sec=Support&pg=Knowledge-
Base&site=c and search for “games”
The game maker has the most complete list of port assignments and other
arrangements that must be made for gaming. But these few places are good ones to
start with if you’re having trouble. The Netgear link has the most complete listing
of games and requested ports of all the major vendors I checked, so start there.
Common Wireless Problems
These can be aggravating, because your problem may be completely outside
your network, and even outside your home or ofﬁce. If your neighbor gets a new
cordless phone and puts it on the wall nearest your ofﬁce, your wireless network
can head downhill fast. And how will you ﬁnd that?
Only by the results of your worsening network situation. If you see a ham radio
tower going up in your neighbor’s back yard, you will know to look for
interference. If not, you can only guess by the intermittent problems. Or get
sneaky and test your network although you call your neighbor and see if the
interference appears when he or she picks up their new cordless phone.

network. A new phone or a microwave can wreak havoc on an 802.11b
network.
• Solution: Change channels, move the router/access point (Chapter
15), and look for new electrical equipment of any kind.
✦Problem (Range): Wireless troubleshooters, especially when adding or
moving devices, must take range into account. Range in this case also
includes walls or other obstructions, because they shorten range. Even
moving the furniture in an ofﬁce can change the wave patterns through
the space and shorten range.
• Solution: Move the router/access station around, reorient antennas
on clients and access points, and even look into adding external
antennas to devices. Verify that all removable antennas remain well
attached to their boxes, because a loose antenna doesn’t cover as
much range.
✦Problem (Encryption): Changing encryptions keys can be trouble if
there’s a typo or missed setting in any one unit.
• Solution: When installing wireless networks, start with encryption
off. Add encryption in phases and verify all wireless devices work
properly before moving to stricter encryption methods.
✦Problem (Vendor incompatibility): Yes, standards are supposed to
eliminate vendor incompatibilities, but your network must function in the
real world. Even name brand equipment using well-established standards
may not work together. You can go crazy trying to ﬁgure out why.
• Solution: Easier to try another unit, and then the same brand on both
ends of the connection, before you start redoing your entire network.
This short section just worries about the wireless-only connections. Protocol
and other networking issues can affect wired and wireless performance equally.
When changing the wireless channels to try and avoid conﬂicts, here’s a little
good news: you only need to change the router/access point channels (if you’re
using Infrastructure mode). When in Infrastructure mode (the better choice over
ad hoc mode as shown in Figure 16-5), the clients take their channel cue from
their access point.
Don’t trust Windows XP to manage the wireless adapter in your PC. XP keeps
trying to show how it will be more efﬁcient for Windows to run the client
operating system and the client wireless device, but resist. XP doesn’t show
everything it knows about your local wireless network, and especially hides the
details when multiple wireless network access points get involved. That’s why I
say use the wireless card’s utility rather than trust Microsoft.

522 Part V ✦Troubleshooting
After traveling with a laptop, make sure you have reconﬁgured anything in your
wireless connection proﬁle you changed to connect while on the road. If you
forget to change your wireless proﬁle, you’ll wonder why you can’t connect back
at home. Then you discover you’re still trying to connect through the Bronx Zoo
access point, and you’re a long way from the Bronx.
Microsoft published a little tip that may be critical for your laptop conﬁguration
routine. If you use your Internet Connection Firewall (ICF) in Windows XP while
traveling, check it when you return home. If you have ICF on for an adapter, that
adapter will ignore all local network devices. In other words, your My Network
Places will be empty. Another reason to use a different personal ﬁrewall on your
laptop rather than trust the Microsoft included utility.
Windows 9x/ME Family
Microsoft added plenty of networking functionality to the Windows 9x family, but
it’s hard to appreciate that now that Windows 95 is long dead and Windows 98 is
on life support.
One report from AssetMetrix Research Labs at the end of 2003 showed that more
than 80 percent of all U.S. companies were still using at least one PC with
Windows 9x/ME. Estimates in the range of 21 million Windows 95 users and 58
million Windows 98 users seem to be the consensus. In other words, about 20
percent of all desktop systems remain in the Windows 9x/ME family.
Yes, Microsoft has continued support for the Windows 9x/ME family longer than
most software companies continue their support. But even Microsoft, rich as
they are, don’t really want to cut their ties for around 70 million users. And
Microsoft has tried everything to get these people to upgrade yet hasn’t been
able to do so.
You will ﬁnd that wireless products do not always come with Windows 9x/ME
drivers anymore. If they do include those drivers, check the dates on the ﬁles. I
bet they’re the oldest drivers included with the wireless product.
Why you should upgrade
Much technological water has gone under the bridge since Windows 98
appeared. Your network can use many of those advances, so seriously consider
upgrading.
Refer to Chapter 11 to remind yourself why you should upgrade. Then
do so and save yourself some aggravation.
I installed Windows 2000 Professional on an old Dell laptop with a Pentium 166
MHz (the original Pentium, not Pentium II or Pentium III) and only 32MB of RAM.
If I can get Windows 2000 Professional running on that machine, you can almost
certainly upgrade any Windows 98 systems you have to at least Windows 2000.

Chapter 19 ✦Troubleshooting Your Side of the Connection 523
Do you enjoy rebooting your computer? With Windows 98, you must reboot
every time you make a change to any of the network conﬁguration options.
Every time. Not only that, you almost always have to supply the original
Windows 98 ﬁles from the CD to ﬁnish the conﬁguration. You can have the ﬁles
on a network drive so you don’t have to have the actual CD on hand, but the
process remains slow and aggravating.
One of the nice advantages of Windows XP Home and Professional is the System
Restore utility. Windows XP takes a system “snapshot” now and then of your
working system and saves that. If you add a program that messes up your
conﬁguration, you can rollback to a known good point.
Even better, you can specify when to make a snapshot. Going to try something
risky? Then take your snapshot before you start the installation process. If
anything goes wrong, rollback and start again. Very handy.
The standard Windows 9x/ME DHCP client support (Get an IP address
automatically) does not always support getting your DNS server addresses from
the DHCP server. If those server addresses change, your client will work ﬁne
inside your network but will be unable to connect to Web sites across the Internet.
You may well forget this, because all other DHCP clients (Windows 2000/XP,
Linux, and Macintosh) properly grab the DNS servers from the DHCP servers.
Lagging behind in the Windows 9x world will complicate your troubleshooting.
Haven’t you done something worth celebrating lately? If so, buy yourself a new
computer as a reward. It will make life easier in a variety of broadband ways.
Check Your Patch Levels
If you’re not going to upgrade, at least get the latest patches and updates from
Microsoft. They won’t be nearly as current as those for later operating systems, but
get the latest ones you can.
A few critical security updates will no doubt continue to be released, although Mi-
crosoft regularly threatens to stop patching the Windows 9x/ME family. Whenever
you have a problem, cross your ﬁngers and check the Microsoft support pages for
updates.
Checking processes
In another example of progressing by stepping sideways, Microsoft changed the
way you check processes considerably between Windows 98 and Windows 2000.
You can stop processes easier in Windows 2000/XP, but you can see more details
about them in Windows 98.
Figure 19-12 shows the Windows 98 version of the Processes display. Here it’s
called Running Tasks, and you can’t stop a process from this screen.

524 Part V ✦Troubleshooting
Figure 19-12: Quite a bit more information here, but less control than in Windows XP.
Check out the normal processes listing when your Windows 9x/ME system is
running correctly (hurry before you have to reboot). When something goes
wrong that you can’t ﬁnd elsewhere, see if a rogue process has appeared in here.
Viruses show up here, as do memory-resident programs like spyware. Neither
are fun, and you didn’t ask for them. Do delete them.
Reach this spot by going through Start ➪Programs ➪Accessories ➪System
Tools ➪System Information. This page shown is the Software Environment,
Running Tasks display.
Under the Tools heading in this screen you can ﬁnd System Conﬁguration. That’s
MSConﬁg. Click there to open the MSConﬁg application (or run msconﬁg from a
DOS prompt).
Figure 19-13 shows the Windows 98 MSConﬁg. Once again I clicked the radio
button for Selective Startup so more of the options would be active and
viewable.
Your only option to control the running processes is to go to the Startup tab on
MSConﬁg and choose what to start or not start. That’s one good way to make
sure something weird with the network is bothering the PC, rather than the
other way around. Stop various programs from loading and compare what starts
then with what starts when all the modules are rolled into the startup. This

method doesn’t work all that often, honestly, but you can try loading everything
interactively with the Diagnostic Startup option and see what kills the booting
process. When the computer hangs again, the last thing you loaded is the
problem.
Many people suggest you check out error messages at Microsoft Support’s Web
site. Feel free, and start here: http://support.microsoft.com/
default.aspx. However, Microsoft doesn’t update the Windows 98 section with
new troubleshooting messages anymore, so your chances of success are even
lower than they usually are. In other words, if you go searching around
Microsoft’s Knowledge Base you’re one step away from reinstalling your
operating system or trying a restoration from the backup tricks you learned
back in Chapter 13.
WinIPConﬁg
Another example of Microsoft progressing to the rear is the lack of WinIP Conﬁg
(winipcfg) past Windows 9x/ME. Would be nice to have this in Windows XP, even
if you have to reach it through the DOS command line as you do in Windows
9x/ME. WinIPConﬁg provides a quick look at all the network protocol
information that Windows XP provides through the six or seven clicks through
various menus to reach the display shown in Figure 19-3.

Figure 19-14 shows the TCP/IP networking protocol information through the
WinIP Conﬁguration program. Start this by going to Start➪Run. Type winipcfg
on the DOS command line that appears and press Enter.
Figure 19-14: A nice graphical display of
Windows 9x/ME network information.
You can choose any of a number of network-enabled connections from the
drop-down list in the Ethernet Adapter Information ﬁeld. AOL adds some, other
network applications add some, and the TCP/IP adapter list can get pretty full.
Notice Microsoft provides some NetBIOS details, such as the computer name. It
would be nice if it showed the workgroup here as well, but them’s the breaks.
Use WinIPcfg to verify your IP address has been assigned properly and your
gateway and DHCP lease is in decent order. If the gateway listing is wrong, for
instance, you won’t have any luck getting to the Internet, even though you can
use your browser within your own network.
Windows 2000 and XP
Windows 2000 may look more like Windows 9x/ME than it does Windows XP, but
there are enough advantages over Windows 9x/ME that I consider Windows 2000
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Chapter 19 ✦Troubleshooting Your Side of the Connection 527
the minimum acceptable modern Windows operating system. If you have
Windows 2000, don’t feel the need to rush out and upgrade.
The added bonus of complete vendor support for Windows 2000 and XP helps,
as well. All the developers now focus on Windows XP, which is backwardly
compatible (for the most part) with Windows 2000. If your application calls for
Windows 2000, it will almost always work on Windows XP. If it calls for Windows
XP, it will probably work on Windows 2000.
Check your patch levels
Microsoft has announced (Spring 2004) that the successor to Windows XP,
Longhorn, will be out, absolutely, in 2005. Oops, make that 2006. Absolutely
guaranteed, says Microsoft. Of course, everyone in the technology business
knows that a date announced this far in advance for a major upgrade from
Microsoft will slip at least one year past their absolutely guaranteed date. That
means Windows XP will be the main application for us all until at least 2007.
Get used to patching and repatching your operating system. I’m torn about the
automatic update process and can’t say yea or nay with enthusiasm either way.
The convenience is great, until an upgrade clobbers an application. Then the
time you saved through automatic updates, and much more besides, goes into
repairing your system.
On balance, I recommend automatic updates for nontechnical people. Why?
Because they are less likely to remember to upgrade themselves. So unless you
(honestly) remember to check with Microsoft on a set date every month for
updates, you should turn on the automatic update process in Windows XP as
shown at the beginning of this chapter, or go to http://v4.windowsupdate
.microsoft.com/en/default.asp on any Windows version to scan your
computer and get the necessary updates.
When something goes even a little screwy, check for updates again. Microsoft
wants to ration the updates to once a week, but that doesn’t always work. In
addition, Microsoft has a habit of pulling updates, adding different features to
the updates, then putting them back out there and claiming they never touched
them. Sometimes all this is the best possible advertisement for consultants on
retainer or Linux. Or maybe both.
Get your operating system up to date whenever you have a minor problem and
you may keep it from becoming major. Then you can argue with your vendors
about patches messing you up rather than begging for patches that haven’t been
supplied.
Checking processes
The processes list in Windows 2000/XP are less descriptive but more
manageable than in Windows 9x/ME. To open the display, right-click the Taskbar
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
528 Part V ✦Troubleshooting
and choose Task Manager. Then click the Processes tab to see a display much
like the one in Figure 19-15.
Figure 19-15: The Processes display for Windows XP.
You can choose how to display the processes by clicking the column heading. I
use either the alphabetical option (as shown) to better ﬁnd processes, or
arrange them by memory usage.
The second window, Select Columns, opens when you click View ➪Select
Columns. The defaults work most of the time, but if a help desk person asks you
to search for one of these numbers, you know where they are.
Take a look and see if anything in your systems screams virus or spyware. Sort
on the CPU percentage used and see which process is stealing all your cycles.
That may be the virus, or at least it will be the screwed-up program you need to
stop. Unlike Windows 9x/ME, the Windows XP version of Processes doesn’t offer
a way to print out the list or otherwise track the details.
IPCONFIG
There are two ways to see the information about your IP protocol in Windows
2000/XP: run ipconﬁg from a DOS command line or check out the details in your
Local Area Network connection. If you prefer the graphical approach, refer to
Figure 19-3. If you still remember (and like) a DOS prompt, open a DOS window
and type ipconﬁg/all to show the information in Figure 19-16.

Figure 19-16: Complete ipconﬁg information for Windows XP.
Notice the information looks quite a bit like that from the Windows 9x/ME listing.
But instead of a graphical utility, Microsoft retreated to a DOS window. Oh well,
who can fathom the unfathomable mind of Microsoft?
This shows the DHCP lease time, which helps if you’re having some odd
disconnect problems. It shows that the DNS server is the gateway. Some routers
like to do that, and cache some of the DNS information for the local network. As
long as your clients can get to the Web and refer to sites by their names, you’re
in good shape.
Checking Your Router Settings
Problems on your part of the network include the router connected to your
cable/DSL modem. Different routers obviously have different administration
screens, but let me show you a few places where I’ve had to do some
troubleshooting while researching this book.
For security, always check the level of ﬁrewall settings you have available on
your router. Figure 19-17 shows the default settings for the Linksys WRV54G
router.
Some network hardware, particularly wireless routers and access points from
Microsoft, want to conﬁgure the network for you. The process for this is network
Universal Plug and Play. I turn this off the ﬁrst time I conﬁgure a piece of network
equipment, because if there’s a problem with a router or other device after
another device changed the settings without telling anyone, how will I ever ﬁnd
and ﬁx that problem?

www.ebook777.com

530 Part V ✦Troubleshooting
Figure 19-17: Turn on the ﬁrewall, and block anonymous requests (pings).
Universal Plug and Pray Not Usually an Uplifting
Experience
Perhaps Universal Plug and Play will improve. Perhaps all vendors will coordinate
every UPnP command so there’s never a mistake on my network. Perhaps my hair
will stop turning gray and start growing back.
UPnP will get better (before my hair grows back in, at least). However, the idea
that any vendor of any hardware or software device on my network can change
conﬁgurations on other devices makes me nervous. When UPnP works, with Mi-
crosoft operating system and Microsoft routers in a small network, it doesn’t save
much time at all. And when it doesn’t work, you waste an enormous amount of
time tracking down what went wrong.
That’s why I call this Plug and Pray. It’s more alliterative than Plug and Curse.
Figure 19-18 shows the UPnP disable setting for the Linksys router shown in the
previous ﬁgure. The UPnP settings locations vary depending on the
manufacturer, but check out the security or advanced settings ﬁrst in your
search.

Chapter 19 ✦Troubleshooting Your Side of the Connection 531
Figure 19-18: UPnP is disabled using the radio button so network devices can’t shut
down Internet access without my knowledge.
The router status is a good screen to keep an eye on. If you don’t see your DNS
server addresses (at the bottom of Figure 19-19) or there is no IP address in the
Default Gateway on the broadband service provider portion of the network, you
know the problem is outside your network.
The router software version may be worth keeping an eye on as well. Upgrades
to the router ﬁrmware (the internal software that runs the router) add new
features and ﬁx old bugs. Upgrading the router software on a regular basis may
help keep some of the potential network problems at bay. And if you’re talking
about network problems, keeping them somewhere besides your network is
always a good goal.
Summary
Things will go wrong on your network. No network or network manager, is
immune from this sad fact of life.
Remember bottom-up troubleshooting and make sure the easy things are right.
Plugs are in, devices are turned on, and the monitor is turned up. Remember to
make sure your network protocol software is running by using internal computer

tests, local network tests, and then Internet tests. Most of all, remember what
software or hardware changes you made that could have caused the problem.
Remember to check only one thing at a time. Nothing wastes more time than
adding to your problems during troubleshooting, so change only one thing at a
time.
Remember you can dial up when your broadband connection is down.
Remember to update your operating system.
Remember that Windows XP System Restore really will help your computer
recover if you mess up an installation or the new application messes up your
conﬁguration. Everyone deserves a second chance, and System Restore gives
that to you.
At least now you’ll have an idea where some of the information you must check
and modify is hidden on your computer and the router. I just hope you don’t see
all this very often. You look like a nice reader who deserves smooth sailing
through the world of networking.

here needs to be some place where Web sites
that don’t ﬁt easily into the ﬂow of a chapter can be
listed, so this is it. Many times, a site is slightly off the
track of the chapter narrative, so putting it in the
chapter doesn’t ﬁt well. Other times a site may have
some valuable information on the topic, but the site
itself focuses on a different topic.
Sometimes, I ﬁnd sites doing my research that don’t
exactly ﬁt, but are too cool to forget and ignore. So here
they are, organized by topic.
Reference Sites
The Web encyclopedia for technology
www.webopedia.com
Obviously slanted toward technical areas, but the host
(www.Internet.com) includes a wealth of other content,
including a Small Business Computing Essentials area.
The TechEncyclopedia
