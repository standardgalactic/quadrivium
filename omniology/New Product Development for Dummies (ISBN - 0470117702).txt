About the Authors
Robin Karol is CEO of the Product Development and Management Associa-
tion (PDMA), a professional society that creates and nurtures a global com-
munity in which people and businesses learn to grow and prosper through
innovation and the introduction of new products. Robin is an adjunct full pro-
fessor at the University of Delaware Lerner School of Business Administration,
where she teaches courses on the Management of Creativity and Innovation.
Robin worked at DuPont for 23 years in various aspects of innovation and new
product development, achieving the role of Director of Innovation Processes.
A certified new product development professional (NPDP), she received her
PhD in Biochemistry from the State University of New York at Buffalo. She 
has numerous publications and has presented at many conferences and
workshops. The Industrial Research Institute (IRI) presented Robin with its
Maurice Holland Award for the best paper in its journal Research-Technology
Management in 2003.
Beebe Nelson is Co-Director of the International Association for Product
Development (IAPD), a consortium of leading product developers who come
together to improve their ability to execute new product development. She
has organized, chaired, presented at, and facilitated conferences and work-
shops in product development, and has contributed chapters and articles in
a number of venues. From 1998 to 2003, she was Book Review Editor of the
Journal of Product Innovation Management, a publication of the PDMA. Beebe
is a certified new product development professional (NPDP) and holds a 
doctorate in philosophy from the Harvard Graduate School of Education.
Beebe has taught Philosophy at the University of Massachusetts at Boston
and most recently in the College of Management at UMass-Lowell. She chairs
the Advisory Council of Partners in Ending Hunger, a not-for-profit organiza-
tion located in Maine.


Dedication
We dedicate this book to the members of the PDMA and the IAPD with whom
we have worked and learned, and to George Castellion and his Frontier
Dialogues. He was willing not to have the answers so that we could all learn
together.
Authors’ Acknowledgments
Our number one acknowledgement goes to the hundreds of new product
development professionals who have made the practice into a field that we
could write this book about. Thank you George Castellion for PDMA’s Frontier
Dialogues, where we asked each other dumb questions until the answers
began to emerge.
Thank you Kemp Dwenger and Dan Dimancescu (yes, those really are their
names!) for researching Japanese product development practices and bring-
ing them to the IAPD for us to learn from.
Thank you Merle Crawford, Robert Cooper, Abbie Griffin, and countless other
academics for doing the research that enabled us to regularize the practices
of new product development. Thank you Clayton Christiansen, Stefan Thomke,
Henry Chesbrough, and many others for continually pushing the limits of
NPD from your professorial offices.
Thank you Peter Senge for bringing home the systemic nature of new product
development, both in your writings and in your association with the IAPD
and the PDMA. And thank you Tom Bigda-Peyton, with whom Beebe applied
the lessons of “the learning organization” at a number of client companies,
including UTC, Corning, Fairchild, and Becton-Dickinson.
Thank you to the product developers and the leadership at DuPont, where
Robin learned almost everything she knows about product development with
the DuPont Consulting Solutions team. Thank you to the New Product
Delivery Support Center at Polaroid, where Beebe worked with one of the
most inspiring teams she has ever known.
Robin gives a special thank you to the original PACE(r) team members 
who struggled with her to understand how all this worked: Eric Schuler, 
Ken Pausell, Bob Gentlzer, Richard Tait, Greg Ajamian, Edmund Ziegler, and
Ed Artz. I would also like to thank Michael McGrath of PRTM (Pittiglio, Rabin,
Todd, and McGrath) for the creation of the PACE(r) process, for writing his

books, and for being a mentor as I was learning new product development. I
also thank Amram Shapiro and Mark Deck for working with the original team
at DuPont and training us all.
Beebe’s special thanks go to Polaroid colleagues Julie Manga, Karen Anne Zien,
Dick Collette, Christina Hepner Brodie, the late Pat McGurty, Carolyn Walker,
Catherine Seo, Jim Fesler, and Mark Durrenberger. We were all beginners —
none more than I — and working with you was a distinct pleasure. My clients
at Polaroid, including Walter Byron and Wendy Watson, provided lots of OJT,
and I hope they learned as much from me as I did from them.
I also have some very particular thank you’s. Thank you to Bob Gill for our
first glimpse of an NPD territory — one that went far beyond the “river of
development” — and to the late Bill Ausura for extending that view into the
product lifecycle. Thank you to Christina Hepner Brodie, who taught me
almost everything I know about customer visits when we worked together at
Polaroid and later at the Center for Quality of Management.
Beebe and Robin reached out to many colleagues as they wrote the chapters
of this book. The following people talked over content and structure, read
drafts, and generally improved what we had to say: Thank you Don Ross of
Innovare who helped us with Chapter 5 and with whom Beebe has done many
exciting early stage NPD projects, and Rich Albright of Albright Technology
Group, with whom Beebe co-wrote the chapter on technology mapping for
the PDMA ToolBook2. Thanks to Mike Compeau of Compeau-Faulkes for 
his help with the chapter on new product launch. Thanks to Scott Elliott of
TechZecs for help with Chapter 14 and to Don Hardenbrook of Intel for help
with Chapter 11. Thanks to Mike Ransom and Dave Vondle of Eli Lilly for their
input into Chapter 16.
Many, many thanks to our Technical Editor, Steve Somermeyer, a PDMA
Board Member, a long time member of the IAPD’s Steering Committee, and
the president of Somermeyer and Associates. Because of Steve’s hard work,
we don’t have to say “the errors that remain are ours.” Now they belong to
Steve as well.
Beebe particularly wants to acknowledge the IAPD and the IAPD members for
an ongoing, high-level course in new product development. This group of com-
panies has, for the past 15 years, been willing to set aside what they know to
explore what they don’t yet understand, and it has been a fascinating and
rewarding experience to work with and for them. I also know that without my
clients — David Deems of Becton-Dickinson, Shriti Halberg of Cerner, all the
folks at Praxair, Dick Tyler of Bose, Jacques LeMoine of Corning, Jennifer Lee
of Globe Union, and, well, I wish I could mention every single one by name —
I wouldn’t have understood what actually makes NPD work. Thank you all.

The success of the PDMA’s effort to codify the knowledge of thought leaders
in the field of new product development was crucial to writing this book.
Robin wants to thank the PDMA for supporting her with the time to work on
this book and for being a resource of information. I want to specifically thank
the Board Chair, Hamsa Thota, for his encouragement; Ken Kahn, VP of
Publications, for getting me started on this; Gerry Katz, who heads up the
PDMA’s Body of Knowledge; and all the directors, VPs, and members for
being there to talk to throughout this project.
Mike Lewis, Acquisitions Editor at Wiley, held our hands through the con-
tracting process, and Chrissy Guthrie, Senior Project Editor at Wiley, has
been unfailingly supportive as we’ve worked toward the final product. We
thank them both.
Steven Haines of Sequent Learning Networks held our hands as we worked
through a number of thorny issues. His contribution to our understanding of
product lifecycles enlivens many parts of the book. Phillip Clark jumped in to
rescue us when we were overwhelmed by Wiley’s editing process. Thanks to
you both.
We’re indebted to April Klimley, Editor of the PDMA’s Visions, who was always
there to lend her mind and heart, as well as a hand, an eye, or an ear. If we
couldn’t figure out how to do something, or to whom we could delegate it,
April always sprang to our sides and pressed through. The book, our readers,
and we owe her a great deal.

Foreword
N
ew Product Development For Dummies. I would guess that some of my 
colleagues might be offended at these words. But the fact is that a cer-
tain amount of naiveté is an essential ingredient in the process of getting a
new product to market. After all, if we know it all, where is the room for dis-
covery? It has been my experience that successful innovators have the char-
acteristic of trying something first to see if it works, and explaining it later.
Indeed, even better still, they get someone else to explain it.
This book teaches us the various hurdles to be overcome and the activities
required if this endeavour of developing new products is to be successful.
Indeed, it is a survival issue for many companies and for countries, including
the U.S. A recent study by the National Academy of Science shows that the
United States has moved from having a positive balance of payments of $33
billion for high–tech products in 1990, to having a negative balance of pay-
ments of $24 billion in 2004.
There are incremental new products, and there are revolutionary new prod-
ucts, those products that change the basis of competition. Developing new
products requires creativity — coming up with ideas for new products  —
and innovation — the process of turning those ideas into something of value.
I use the following definitions:
“Research and Development is the transformation of money
into knowledge. Innovation is the transformation of knowledge
into money.”
Clearly we need both. This book focuses on the transformation of an idea
into something of value — in other words, the transformation of knowledge
into money. We cannot be happy with satisfying the customer; we have to
reach the next level of delighting the customer. That often comes from prod-
ucts that satisfy a need that the customer did not even know he or she had.
To be successful with new products, an organization must provide an envi-
ronment that allows innovation to thrive, the resources to get it done, and a
measurable expectation of success.  If you want to activate innovation in an
organization, you need to:
Know where you want to go — Vision
Know where the rest of the world is going — Foresight
Have ambition — Stretch goals

Have freedom to achieve your goals — Empowerment
Draw from and work with others — Communication, Networking
Be rewarded for your efforts — Recognition
Passion and courage, however difficult they are to measure, are also essential
in new product development. I can tell you from my experience in championing
Post-It Notes that we had to have passion and courage. We were told several
times by management to kill the program. I know that if we had had some of
the processes like the ones described in this book, we could have had that
product in the market two years earlier than we did.
Companies of any size must hire innovative people to join their team. These
people should be creative, have broad interests, be capable problem solvers,
be self motivated, have a strong work ethic, and be resourceful.
And so in your passionate and courageous effort to get new products suc-
cessfully into the market by using the tools in this book, always keep in mind
the six phases a program is likely to go through:
1. Enthusiasm
2. Disillusionment
3. Panic
4. Search for the guilty
5. Punishment of the innocent
6. Praise and honors for the non-participant
A final message: Enjoy the book, innovate for the customer, network with
your colleagues, and have fun. But most of all, I wish you success with your
new products.

Introduction
D
o you watch the Super Bowl on a high-definition flat-screen television?
Does your microwave heat up leftovers in the blink of an eye? If so, thank
a new product developer. Are you confident that the package you sent today
will reach its destination by tomorrow morning? Have you found a retirement
package that meets all your needs? If so, thank a new product developer.
Are you hoping that someone will solve the planet’s energy problems and
find cures for the diseases that plague the world? A new product developer
is already on the case.
The people who develop new products look for problems they can solve,
gaps they can fill, and ways they can make consumers’ lives better, easier,
and more exciting. They take on these tasks because they’re curious, cre-
ative, and ambitious. They also want to make money — for themselves and
for their companies. Unlike visionaries who like to invent for the sake of
invention, new product developers commit to getting new products into 
markets where people can benefit from them, and for good returns on their
investments. If you’re looking to grow your business, sustain it for the long
haul, and become a hero to your customers, jump right into New Product
Development For Dummies. You can thank us later!
About This Book
We wrote this book for people who develop new products. Don’t let the title
of this book mislead you into thinking that developing new products is a walk
in the park. Developing new products is not only the most rewarding thing
you can do in business but also about the most challenging. It calls for both
creativity and discipline, and it requires a willingness to make mistakes and
then learn from them.
We first met at product conferences, where companies from around the world
came together to trade stories of their successes and share the reasons for
their failures. We were anxious to collaborate with others. Fifteen years or so
ago, though, none of us really knew how to make new product development
pay off on a consistent basis. We’d look at each other and say, “Do you suppose
it would help if we had cross-functional new product teams?” Or, “I wonder if
we ought to get management to review this project before we bet the farm
on it.” Many of us were willing to make the kinds of stupid mistakes people
make when they have no obvious answers.

Today, we do know what’s important to achieve success in developing new
products. We don’t mean that only we, Robin and Beebe, know. We mean that
many professionals know, and plenty of people in small and large companies
around the world use the practices that we describe here.
In this book, we give you tons of tips, examples, and pointers that illustrate
what successful new product developers do, and we help you to implement
the practices that separate “the best from the rest.” We had a blast writing
this book, and we hope that you have a blast reading it and applying it to
your work. After all, what’s more exciting than creating something that didn’t
exist before? You do very important and very hard work. Our biggest motiva-
tion as we wrote this book was to make sure that everything we put on paper
is accurate, helpful, and clear and represents the respect we have for you and
for the work you’re doing.
Conventions Used in This Book
To guide you through this book, we include the following conventions:
 Italics point out defined terms and emphasize certain words.
 Boldface text indicates key words in bulleted lists and actions to take in
numbered lists.
 Monofont highlights Web addresses.
Here are two important definitions:
 People who develop new products don’t develop only things; they
develop things and services and improvements to things and services
that already exist. When we use the term “new product,” we’re referring
to all the new products and services that solve customers’ problems and
make their lives better.
 When we use the term develop, we’re referring to all the activities that
occur between the time when a company sees an opportunity for a new
product and when it introduces the product to the market.
What You’re Not to Read
We really didn’t include anything that we don’t think is important, but if you’re
in a hurry (and if you’re a product developer, we bet you are), here are some
suggestions:
2
New Product Development For Dummies 

 Look at the Table of Contents to figure out exactly which chapter deals
with the problem that’s bugging you right now. You can skip all the rest,
until another problem or question rears its head.
 You can skip all the sidebars or save them for a rainy day. These shaded
boxes mostly give examples and pointers from real-world experience.
If you don’t read them, you won’t lose the thread.
 You can skip the text marked with a Technical Stuff icon. We put some
things in those paragraphs that seemed a bit, well, technical — it isn’t
the kind of stuff product developers talk about on a daily basis.
Foolish Assumptions
One of the cardinal rules in new product development is “Know thy customer.”
For us, that customer is you. We had to make some assumptions about you
in writing this book, and some of them may be foolish or just plain wrong.
Anyway, here they are:
 We assume that you’re interested in developing new products or in sup-
porting people who develop new products.
 We assume that you have some business background. We use terms like
“return on investment” and “business case” throughout the text — terms
that we assume you learned in school and/or use in your everyday work.
 We assume that you work in any industry imaginable and that you play
just about any conceivable role in your industry. Your company may be
large or small, old or just starting out. Also, we assume that you may be
changing roles or industries.
Product developers often create character sketches of people for whom they
develop their products. Here are some sketches that helped us picture our
readers:
I’m the VP of R&D at a small company that builds homes for first-time home-
owners. I’m sure we could do a better job of designing, constructing, and
marketing our homes if we treated them like new products. After all, we go
through a pretty complex design/development process each time we intro-
duce a new model. I need some kind of primer, an entry-level guide to help
me understand what product developers do.
I’m the CEO and founder of a small company that manufactures “environ-
mentally friendly” air-conditioners. Dave, the head of R&D, is always sug-
gesting ways to make our air-conditioners better, but Mike, the head of
manufacturing, usually manages to squelch Dave’s efforts. It’s probably just
as well, because I’m not sure that Dave’s bells and whistles would be useful
to our customers. I think we need to look into how some of the leading com-
panies develop their new products.

Introduction

I’m the process owner for new product development in our company. We’re
successful at developing new products and services, but I know we could do
more. Where I could get the most bang for my buck would be to bring all my
processes — front-end, development, lifecycle — up to speed. I’m going to
take a look at New Product Development For Dummies. Who knows, it may
give us the baseline we need across all our divisions and all our processes.
My partner and I have a great idea for a new product. We’re a long way
from getting it to the market, though. We need to understand what all the
steps are on the way. How do you get started? What are the necessary
resources? And if we want to hook up with an established company, how
would we go about it?
My boss, who’s the head of marketing at our company, wants me to go to a
Product Development and Management Association (PDMA) conference.
He thinks that we could improve our product-change and product-introduction
processes. I think I’ll learn some useful things there, but I want to find a basic
book that introduces me to the field before I go to the conference and make
a fool of myself!
I’m about to graduate from college, and I think that new product develop-
ment looks like an exciting career field. However, I didn’t learn much about
the field at school. I need something that will help me understand the field
so that I have an idea of where to begin.
I work in Purchasing. My company, a mid-size furniture business, has been
extending the amount of outsourcing we do in designing and developing
new products. I’m feeling increasing pressure to become more of a thought
leader and less of a responder in new product development. I wonder,
would New Product Development For Dummies help me understand the
processes better and teach me to be more of a contributor?
I’m the Chief Technology Officer for a process chemical company. People in
my industry don’t really think about developing new products or services.
My company has been doing what we do for years now and continues to
get decent margins. But I think we have a huge opportunity to extend what
we’re doing into new areas. I need to learn more. I could hire a consultant,
but then I’d get only his or her approach. I want to find a book that gives me
the skinny so I know how to take the next step.
I’m the process owner for a mid-size company’s NPD division. We produce
consumer goods. We’re extremely successful in new product development; in
fact, I’m traveling today to give a presentation on our voice of the customer
process at a professional conference. But I’ve found a book called New
Product Development For Dummies. One thing’s for sure in NPD, the finish
line is always moving. You know, I may learn something from this book.
If not, I can always leave it in a seat pocket on the plane so that no one
will know I was reading it.

How This Book Is Organized
To be successful at new product development, you have to know how and
why new products are important to your company; you have to develop a
way to continuously explore new opportunities; and you have to manage a
disciplined process that will bring the most promising opportunities to
market. The first three parts of this book address these important topics. In
the final parts of the book, you discover some of the new challenges that
product developers are facing, and you find some tips that help you navigate
issues that are important to product development.
Part I: The Basics of New 
Product Development
Exactly what are “new products,” and how do they contribute to your com-
pany? Until you can answer those questions, your company’s efforts at new
product development are likely to be helter-skelter. Your success will be hit-
or-miss, with “miss” usually coming out on top. In Chapter 1, you discover
what it takes to develop great new products, and you find out what role you
and others must play in NPD activities. In Chapter 2, you take a look at the
many different outputs we call “new products.” You get a handle on which
ones are important for your company, and you see how to integrate new prod-
uct development with your company’s overall strategies. Chapter 3 takes you
into the world of product portfolios, product lifecycles, product platforms,
and profit models — topics that help you come up with a clear NPD strategy.
Part II: Charting the Ocean of Opportunity
for New Products
The most successful new product developers stay on the lookout for oppor-
tunities. The point isn’t to build a better mousetrap, unless you’ve really
researched what will prompt the mice to run to your door. In this part of the
book, you go through the best practices of visiting customers (Chapter 4),
you find out how to turn your company into an “idea factory” (Chapter 5),
and you discover how to survey technology both inside and outside your
company (Chapter 7). You also discover how to identify the most promising
ideas within the ocean of opportunity (Chapter 6), and you read about the
disciplines that help your teams focus their efforts on those potentially win-
ning ideas (Chapter 8).

Introduction

Part III: Navigating the River 
of Product Development
Developing and launching a new product requires discipline, hard work, and
risk management. To help you through this part of the product development
landscape, the five chapters in Part III give you the scoop on the “river of
development,” which starts when management charters a team to develop
the business case for a new product idea or concept and runs all the way
to the market. Chapter 9 lays out the standard new product development
process from idea to launch. Chapter 10 gives information on how to assem-
ble and run a cross-functional NPD team.
Chapter 11 is the gearbox of the whole book: It shows how you can join the
strategies, the opportunities, and the products that your company already
has in the market with the ongoing work of the product development teams.
Chapter 12 discusses reviews and business cases and their roles in assessing
the progress of new product projects. Finally, Chapter 13 gives you advice for
making a successful transition from development to the market.
Part IV: New Challenges in 
Product Development
Being best-in-class in product development is a moving target you’ll continu-
ally aim to hit. You’ll face many challenges, and your company will have to
branch out to new areas of the product development tree. In this part, you
get to see some of the changes that are making the old dogs of NPD learn
new tricks.
In Chapter 14, we discuss the digitization of information. In Chapter 15, you
find out how companies are going global to create new products. And in
Chapter 16, you discover the increasing importance of partnering in product
development. All three trends impact product development, and as they
interact with each other, their impact becomes even greater.
Part V: The Part of Tens
Testing and measuring are important throughout the product development
process. We gathered some handy information that product developers use
to accomplish these important activities and put the info in the Part of Tens.
Chapter 17 tells you about the role of testing in NPD, and Chapter 18 presents
some ways you can measure NPD success.

Icons Used in This Book
Whether you want to flip through this book to look for tidbits or study each
section as if we’re about to give you a final exam, you should pay attention to
the icons; they’ll lead you to pocketable and useable take-aways.
Here’s a rundown of the icons you’ll see in this book:
We use this icon to flag bits of text that we think are very important to remem-
ber. This icon may present some new, breakthrough advice, or it may recall
something that we present in another chapter that also applies to what you’re
reading now.
Once in a while, we want to go a bit deeper into some specialized stuff. We tip
you off to that type of information by using this icon. You can skip over these
icons and be just fine, but the info they contain will add to your understand-
ing of new product development.
This icon flags actions or strategies you can use to set yourself up for success.
This icon flags the pitfalls and landmines that can derail your company’s new
product development train. We’ve tried to identify the most important traps
so you can concentrate on the positives and avoid the negatives.
Where to Go from Here
You don’t have to start reading this book at the beginning and continue
straight through to the end. In new product development, you really can’t
define a beginning or end anyway. Wherever you start, you’re always in the
middle of things — your existing products, your customers, your technology,
your business goals . . . the list goes on.
We advise you to take a look at the Cheat Sheet at the front of the book and
locate yourself and your NPD job on the map. You may be an executive whose
key responsibilities lie in strategy. If so, you may want to start with Part I.
Perhaps you’re a functional head who’s in charge of a business unit or an
NPD process owner; if so, you may want to start with Part II to get a handle
on what feeds the NPD pipeline. If you’re a member of a cross-functional new
product team or of a function that supports new product development, you
may want to read Part III first.

Introduction

No matter where you start, though, we have one strong belief: Chapter 11
should be required reading for everyone — especially for executives. 
Get to it when you can, but make sure you get to it.
When developing new products, you must keep your eyes on many balls at
once. You need the cooperation and collaboration of many people within and
outside your organization. We wrote this book so that you could see all the
pieces in one place. If you understand all the things that need to go right in
order to succeed in new product development, you’ll be able to work with
others — and to teach, coach, and influence others — so that all the balls
stay in play.

f product developers behave like the blind men with
the elephant, they won’t get too far. You’ll find the engi-
neer at the trunk exclaiming over the functional elegance,
the marketer at the tail stressing how easy it will be to
sell, the manufacturer tapping on the legs and complain-
ing that his current infrastructure won’t accept them, and
so on.
Developing new products takes a whole company (and
sometimes even more than one). When companies take
the new product development challenge seriously, they
become learning organizations. They take off their func-
tional blindfolds and discover how to communicate
across internal boundaries. Employees work together to
understand and share the work that they have to com-
plete. They set clear goals and objectives for their new
product development initiatives. They create common
languages in which to articulate their strategies.
To optimize your company’s ability to succeed at new
product development (NPD), you have to come to terms
with the organizational challenges that NPD presents. Part
I provides an overview of how NPD impacts a company,
and how the company can respond to that impact.

D
eveloping new products that will succeed in the marketplace goes way
beyond simply coming up with a great new idea, a great new invention, or
a great new design. Developing successful new products is a complex job that
comes with many tasks and many responsibilities. And how many different
people, with how many different skills, do you need to accomplish the tasks?
How about inventors, scientists, designers, and engineers? And manufacturers,
marketers, and salespeople? How about heads of businesses and functions
and people with finance and legal expertise? Maybe we should also include
suppliers and partners, and what about customers, and . . . well, you get the
idea. Instead of a village, “it takes a company to develop new products . . .”
Oh my! It’s no wonder that so many companies find it hard to be successful at
developing new products. In this chapter, we give you the general require-
ments for new product development (NPD) success, and we look at a map of
the processes that you can take on your NPD journey. We identify the players
in your company who have important roles in the NPD drama. Finally, we review
what role you, our faithful reader, play in your company and what that means
for your NPD participation.
We hope that by the time you finish this chapter, you’re ready to order copies
of this book for everyone you work with so that they’ll know how to play
their parts. NPD is one game you can’t play by yourself!

The Requirements of NPD Success
Over the years, product developers have come up with a pretty good list of
what new products need to do to succeed at NPD. They need to
 Meet the needs of potential customers (see Chapter 4). This is probably
the most important item on the list. If you haven’t identified your poten-
tial customers, and if you don’t understand their needs, the rest of this
list won’t do you much good.
 Use technology that your company has access to or can develop (see
Chapters 7 and 16). Peter Carcia at Polaroid used to warn his teams not
to design products that required “transparent aluminum.” Don’t limit
yourself to your existing resources. Have an aggressive program of tech-
nology development and technology outsourcing and/or acquisition.
But don’t fool yourself into thinking that you can develop products that
require miracles in the course of development (even minor ones!).
 Attract customers by being different from competitors’ products.
What’s worse than spending six months or two years working on a product
only to find that it’s a me-too? Be sure you know who your competitors
are and what they’re up to, and be sure that you understand your cus-
tomers well enough to produce a product that will delight them more
than your competitors’ products do.
 Be designed so that you can manufacture, package, ship, and/or 
service them. Long ago — not any more, we hope — engineers used
to consistently design products that manufacturers couldn’t build.
Successful product developers “design for X” by including manufactur-
ers, distributors, and so on in the early conversations and the ongoing
work of product design and development. See Chapter 9 for more on
how to “design for X.”
 Enhance or be consistent with your company’s brand image. The best
product with the wrong brand is the wrong product. Your products
reflect on your brand, and your brand reflects on your products, and if
they don’t enhance each other they may play takeaway. If you’ve got a
great product that doesn’t square with your brand, maybe your com-
pany needs a second — or fourth or fifth — brand. See Chapter 3 for a
bit more on lining new products up with your brand.
 Be promoted by a good marketing campaign (see Chapter 13, as well
as Marketing For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Alexander Hiam [Wiley]).
Don’t make the marketing campaign an afterthought.
12
Part I: The Basics of New Product Development 

 Provide a good return on your company’s investment. This is where
the rubber hits the road in terms of judging the success of a product.
Product development teams and business leaders can make this out-
come far more likely by taking the new product’s business case very
seriously (see Chapter 12) and doing what’s needed to make sure the
product hits its goals.
Having a successful new product from time to time isn’t enough. New product
development is a core competency of the company that takes resources and
generates revenue. To build its competence at NPD, your company must
 Develop employees who can make sure your new products meet all the
requirements in the previous list, and a little more.
 Assign its scarce resources to projects that are most likely to succeed.
 Ensure that new product projects and business functions within the
company support each other as much as possible.
Moving from Product Possibility 
to Market Reality
Although it’s true that every new product starts with an idea, not every idea
ends up in the market. The most successful companies start by exploring
many different opportunities and coming up with many different options.
You want to make sure that among these options are ideas for products that
will appeal to customers, sell in large markets, and take advantage of the
latest technologies.
When we go through the product development map in the sections that
follow, we say “start here” and “go there” as if we were playing a board game.
In this game, though, you can start anywhere and go anywhere. If you just
picked up this book and you’re in the middle of a new product development
project, you can skip to the part that addresses what you’re doing. When you
have time, read the other parts, too. Often, you can trace what goes wrong or
right in one part of the development process to good or bad work in the
other parts.
In the sections that follow, we take a quick look at the three major territories
of the NPD landscape.
13
Chapter 1: It Takes a Company . . . 

Discovering opportunities
In the NPD process (refer to the Cheat Sheet for a handy illustration of the
process), we call the place where you find product opportunities the “ocean.”
The ocean of new product opportunity is nearly limitless because constant
change opens up new vistas. Think of the changes you’ve seen just in the past
ten years. New technologies, new markets, and new products have enabled
people to dive deeper and voyage wider into the resourcefulness and creativ-
ity of the human race.
Exploring the ocean of opportunity gives you (and your new product team)
the information you need to develop your company’s strategy for new prod-
uct development. By identifying market and technology opportunities, you
can focus your development efforts on the most promising ideas and avoid
the traps and dead ends. And by reviewing your current product lines, you
know whether to direct NPD projects to improve offerings in your existing
product lines or develop wholly new products or product lines. (The chapters
in Part II describe the ocean of opportunity in more detail.)
Developing the product
After you’ve identified a bunch of opportunities, you want to choose the very
best ideas that can succeed in your market and that you have the resources
to develop. To do this, you use screens that allow only a few ideas to move
into and through the development process (also known as the “river of 
development”). These screens — companies call them reviews or Decision
Diamonds — are places where the company’s decision makers review ideas
for products against the company’s strategic criteria and decide which ideas
should use some of the company’s scarce resources. Only a small number of
opportunities should pass through the initial Idea Screen compared to the
vast amount that float around in the ocean of opportunity. After an idea has
passed the initial Idea Screen, it becomes the property of the cross-functional
development team, which works through the phases and reviews of the prod-
uct development process (see Chapter 9). At each review, business decision
makers do one of the following:

 Stop or hold (recycle) the project if the reviewers need more information

Part I: The Basics of New Product Development 

Don’t forget that a company’s executives need to know that they can get good
returns on their new product investments. Therefore, in addition to doing the
actual work of developing new products, the product development team has
to develop a business case for management. You can read more about busi-
ness cases and how to create them in Chapter 12, and you can find a business
case template in the Appendix.
Launching the product
Your development team has spent months, maybe years, anticipating this
moment — the moment when your new product launches from the protected
environment of the team atmosphere into the wide world of the marketplace.
In some companies, moving a product from development into the market is
called “crossing the valley of death.” Why? Because many new products fail
at this point. To avoid launch failure, you need to plan for the launch through-
out the development process instead of waiting for when your product is
nearly ready for the market (see Chapter 13 for more on this topic).
Identifying the Roles of the Functions
The major players in the development of new products are the people on the
new product development team. These people have different roles, which
may include the team leader, the members of the core team, and members of
the extended team. One thing they have in common, though, is that they
come from different functions and departments within the company. In this
section, we give you an overview of what each function contributes to your
new product development efforts, and we explain the particular roles the
functions play throughout the process.
Even if your company is too small to have distinct functions, you can recog-
nize the roles that individuals and groups play in your company. This section,
as well as the information in Chapter 10, can help you do a better job of
making sure the people and groups in your company are collaborating to
make your NPD efforts as effective and efficient as possible.
Many new product efforts include partners from outside your company.
You need to understand the basics of working with different functions when
“outsiders” are part of the development picture. See Chapter 16 for more on
partnering in product development.
15
Chapter 1: It Takes a Company . . . 

Marketing
Success in new product development depends in large measure on how well
you understand the market, including the following:
 The existing markets for your products
 How your markets are growing or shrinking
 What new markets you may be able to enter
 What your competitors are doing in the marketplace
The marketing function in a large company, along with market research, may
be responsible for collecting and managing market knowledge. In a small
company, one person may be most interested in the market. But here’s the
thing: Understanding the market isn’t the same as being good at selling in it.
Your company, big or small, and your new product development team need
to develop a deep appreciation for your customers and your markets. And
your marketers must be able to communicate their knowledge to others with
whom they share the responsibility for developing new products.
R&D
Research and development is where many of your scientists and engineers
live. Members of the R&D department contribute their understanding of tech-
nology to the company’s product development efforts. Much of what your
R&D experts know is pretty arcane (like that word, which means mysterious,
deep, esoteric!).
Successful product developers make sure that their scientists and engineers
work with others to share their knowledge and to understand how it relates
to what the other functions know and do. This type of collaboration and shar-
ing needs to happen in all the parts of the product development landscape.
Technologists can be very perceptive during customer visits (see Chapter 4).
They also have the best understanding of existing and emerging technology
(see Chapter 7). Members of R&D on an NPD team are likely to offer sug-
gestions about technology innovations or technology tweaks or that may
just provide a competitive leap forward as your new products meet their
competition.
Manufacturing
The role of manufacturing in NPD is to make the product concept a reality.
Within this role, manufacturing has the following tasks:
16
Part I: The Basics of New Product Development 

 Ensuring that the company’s manufacturing capabilities and infrastruc-
ture are adequate to produce the new product
 Deciding what parts of production the company may need to outsource
(see Chapters 15 and 16)
 Managing the supply chain for the new product
Your manufacturing function must be able to produce as much of the product
as you think you can sell, at the expected quality and performance. Therefore,
members of this function should be involved in the development process
from the very beginning. Include them when you visit customers to under-
stand customer needs (see Chapter 4). Not only are their insights different
from the insights of individuals in other functions, but they also have a much
better idea of what it takes to put products into production.
Service
Some of the new “products” that companies create are actually services.
Airlines, for example, distinguish themselves on the services they offer. So do
hotels, restaurants, and companies that deliver your packages overnight to
anywhere in the world. The people in your company who design and market
services should take the lead in developing services.
However, when the product a company creates is a product, companies may
make the mistake of paying little attention to service. The individuals in your
company who are responsible for providing service should be integral parts
of the new product effort whenever a product entails aftermarket service.
Integrating service into the NPD process can alert product developers to new
opportunities and help them avoid costly mistakes. For example, an NPD
team that includes a member from the service function is less likely to design
a product that’s overly hard to service. Integrating service into development
also can help NPD teams think about installation and repairs — whether
these are the responsibility of the customer or of your company, and how
expensive they should be (the easier and cheaper, the better for everyone).
Packaging
Packaging impacts your new product’s attractiveness on a store shelf, a com-
puter screen, or in any other place customers are likely to find and buy it.
Your new product’s attractiveness — and often the size and shape of the
final package — sometimes impacts a store’s willingness to stock it. Here’s a
bottom-line way to perk up management: How much it costs to ship your new
product depends, in part, on its packaging. And the cost of shipping impacts
the final price, which impacts everything!
17
Chapter 1: It Takes a Company . . . 

Our point? Involve your packaging function early in the development process.
The members of the function can help the team understand the preferences
of retailers and wholesalers; they can help influence product design to sim-
plify packaging; and they can participate in consumer preference tests (see
Chapter 17). At the end of the process, the packaging of your product often is
the first impression your product makes. Use the resources of your packaging
department to make it a good one.
Distribution
The four Ps of marketing include product, pricing, promotion, and place. Your
new product won’t sell unless you distribute it to places where customers can
buy it. A company’s distribution and channel strategy shapes the choices
that are open to the NPD team. Does your company sell through one of the
“big box” stores? Do you offer products through catalogues or on the Internet?
Is your distribution through dealers or distributors? Which of the existing
routes will the NPD team choose to get its product out? Or will it try to carve
out a new route? The distribution function should be involved in the product
development process to make sure your NPD team understands the distribu-
tion options so it can get the new product out in front of an eager audience.
Information technology
Your information technology (IT) department provides your NPD team (and
your whole company, really) with valuable tools for development and busi-
ness. For instance, through IT, you have the ability to
 Communicate internally: Many of us now send e-mails to the person in the
office next door instead of getting up and knocking on the door. Most NPD
teams are linked together via e-mail and instant messaging, and teams can
send and share documents and keep an assortment of others “in the loop.”
 Store data: Your NPD team can use an Intranet site to post documents
and progress reports to facilitate work, communication, and company
involvement. Your IT department can help with document formatting,
document control, and your ability to access and use data from other
parts of the company.
 Communicate with the outside world: Many development teams are
spread throughout the world (see Chapter 15), and many development
efforts require companies to outsource work to other locations (see
Chapter 16). IT provides the tools that help these teams communicate,
including Intranet sites where project information can be stored and
shared. Teams can access documents from a shared site, and team mem-
bers located in different places can work on projects simultaneously.
Go to Chapter 14 for more on the role of IT in NPD.
18
Part I: The Basics of New Product Development 

Finance
You can’t assemble the data your NPD team needs to represent the value
proposition for your new product (which is what management and your cus-
tomers are interested in) without the expertise of your finance department.
Involve members of this function early in the process as you map the ocean
of opportunity, and keep them involved as you build your business case (see
Chapter 12).
Human resources
People develop new products. These people need rewards, career paths, and all
the other motivators that keep employees happy and productive. Your human
resource (HR) department needs to understand the special needs of employees
who develop new products. The performance goals and reviews that work for
functional employees may not be appropriate for product developers.
Your HR department may be the right function in your company to create
a cross-cutting set of practices that enable the functions to support your
product developers. HR can look across the functions and design employee
reward structures that balance functional and project work. And these struc-
tures can help the company in other ways by leveling the playing field among
the functions.
NPD teams should also not hesitate to turn to HR for its special expertise in
organizational development. For example, HR can help a team leader under-
stand how to lead and motivate her team (see Chapter 10), and help a team
identify the diversity that they need to come up with the best ideas (see
Chapter 5).
Regulatory, legal, and standards
New product development can present challenges to legal and standards
boundaries. Many companies have to work within clear boundaries — for exam-
ple, the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. For others, these issues
come up when they’re developing some products, but not all. Be sure your team
has explored the possibility that its work may need to clear regulatory hurdles
or that existing standards may limit what the team can do. Involve the legal
department if the intellectual property (IP) it’s developing needs protecting.
Your regulatory, legal, and standards functions have the responsibility of sup-
porting your new product teams — as well as executives, business leaders,
and functional heads — and helping them to understand regulations that may
advance or hinder their work. But they can do their jobs only if the new prod-
uct developers keep them informed of potential issues.
19
Chapter 1: It Takes a Company . . . 

Playing Your Part in Product Development
Executives, business and functional heads, members of functions and depart-
ments, and so on — all these people play a role in developing new products.
In this section, we speak directly to you by identifying the roles people play
in product development. Find your title and read away, or brush up on all the
titles for a more complete understanding.
Executives
Executives include CEOs, CTOs — can we say “CXOs”? — as well as heads
of business units, vice presidents, directors, functional heads, and so on.
These managers are responsible for charting the overall direction of the 
business as a whole, and their top-down support provides the context for
product development.
The specific role of the executive depends a lot on the size of the company.
In a smaller company, executives may play a very hands-on role; in a larger
company, an executive is more likely to act as a context setter. In a company
of any size, executives often appoint a process owner to plan and execute the
tasks that build the company’s new product capabilities, such as strategic
planning and process development.
The executive role also varies depending on the role new products play in the
company’s strategy. In making the company’s new product strategy clear, exec-
utives set a frame for everyone else. In Chapter 3, you can read more about
the different parameters executives must consider in setting NPD strategy.
Functional heads
A functional head is someone who leads one of the company’s functional
departments, such as R&D or marketing. In this position, you play an impor-
tant role in building the expertise, the competency, and the capability your
company needs to excel in new product development. Your function is one of
the sources of NPD resources, in terms of manpower and expertise. You’re also
a major source of the information and knowledge that your company needs
to chart its NPD course (see Chapter 3). Quite simply, without the functions
and your leadership, product development wouldn’t exist. (Read more about
the roles of the functions in Chapters 9 and 11.)
Your responsibilities as a functional head point in two directions:
 You have to make sure that, as you build knowledge and expertise for
the product development effort, your function is working with the
rest of the company. Technology maps (Chapter 7) that no one outside
20
Part I: The Basics of New Product Development 

of R&D can decipher are useless; market insights that no one else shares
do no good; and process advances that don’t contribute to the company’s
product strategy are a waste of time and money.
 You have to make sure that your function is capable of providing the
necessary resources for developing new products (and is willing to
do so). Your function needs to resource the exploration that takes place
in the ocean of opportunity; you provide employees and infrastructure
for new product teams; and you support products in the market. (For
more on the politics of product development, see Chapters 9 and 10.)
Business leaders
Many companies have business units, or strategic business units (SBUs), that
focus on different business opportunities. These SBUs are headed by busi-
ness leaders who come up with strategies for the development of new prod-
ucts that advance the goals of the businesses — goals that should align with
the work of other businesses in the companies and in other functions. In a
smaller company, the top executives are responsible for NPD strategy creation.
As part of your strategy, you need to make sure that the portfolio of new
and existing products is well balanced and in line with your objectives (see
Chapter 3 for more on product portfolios). Is your business focused on exist-
ing markets and existing technologies? Then be sure your portfolio provides
adequate attention to all the markets under your care, and don’t be so
wedded to existing technology that you overlook new technologies that
might come with a “low-risk” price tag. Is your business focused on a volatile
market or technology? Then make sure that some of your new product pro-
jects explore future options, but don’t forget to balance the forward-looking
portfolio with support of existing product lines and platforms.
New product development team members
The members of the NPD team have the job of actually carrying the ball, so to
speak. You do the development work from front end to back end. You also
have to make sure that your company’s executives, business leaders, and
functional heads are aware of your value and of your resource needs (see
Chapter 9 for more on these relationships and for advice on dealing with
company politics, and Chapter 10 for more on the NPD team).
Some companies assign “product champions” to oversee important new
product development projects. The champion’s role is to advise the team
members, understand their needs — and the value of their project — and
influence the functions and executives in the company to provide the needed
support. A champion usually holds an executive position in the company and
has good powers of influence.
21
Chapter 1: It Takes a Company . . . 

Review committee members
Review committee members hold jobs in the executive, directorial, and man-
agerial levels of the company. As a reviewer, your primary job is to decide
whether products in the development process should go forward to the next
development phase, stay in the current phase for more work, be shelved or
sold, or cease to exist altogether.
Executing the job of reviewer means preparing for and attending all sched-
uled reviews, listening carefully to the product team’s presentation, and 
discussing your thoughts openly and honestly with other reviewers and
the team members.
As a reviewer, you need to do your homework before reviews, which includes
reading the executive summary and the business case provided by the team.
Be sure to talk with team members if you have questions or concerns before
the review.
For more on phases and phase reviews, head to Chapter 9. For much more on
reviews, executive summaries, business cases, and the role of the reviewers,
check out Chapter 12.
Functional support people
The functional head — of, say, marketing — is responsible for making sure
that the product development process has the functional resources it needs
(see the earlier section “Functional heads”). The functional employee, how-
ever, has a different responsibility: You need to be sure that you understand
the product development process (see Chapter 9), and you need to know
how you can contribute.
For example, if you work in the service function and a new product team asks
you to join — either as a full-fledged member of the core team or as a resource
at points during the product development process — your task may be to
identify ways in which product design might influence service issues later on.
The team will depend on you for a variety of expertise: anticipating the impact
of different designs, modeling the financial implications of one service option
over another, and so on. The more you understand about the NPD process
as a whole, the more effectively you’ll bring your experience to bear on the
team’s issues.

Chapter 2
What Are You Developing, 
and Why?
In This Chapter
 Choosing your company’s growth options
 Deciding how important developing new products is to your company
 Examining product development’s role in your organization
 Understanding the many different things people call “new products”
 Providing consumers with solutions and experiences
T
he term “new product” covers plenty of ground. A new product can be
a baseball bat or a toaster, a car or an airplane, a piece of software that
includes support and installation, a vacation package, a new type of checking
account, an in-home cleaning and babysitting service, and so on. Bank of
America, for example, won the Product Development and Management
Association’s Innovator of the Year Award for its innovative “products,”
which are actually services, like its “Keep the Change” program which allows
customers to round their credit-card payments up to the next dollar and put
the difference into savings accounts.
Many companies think of products as solutions that include the range of prod-
ucts and services that address a customer’s needs. For example, a company
might offer everything a customer needs related to computers, from wiring to
hardware to Internet connectivity to software to ongoing support — all bun-
dled into one product package and priced accordingly. Some “new” products
are actually the result of relatively minor changes to existing products. Other
new products are so radical — often called breakthrough products — that no
one has ever seen or thought of them before.

No matter what form new products take, you can make money from them in
many different ways:
 You can simply charge customers when they buy them (think clothing).
 You can rent or lease them (think cars and copy machines).
 You can practically give them away and charge for supporting services
and supplies (think razors, cameras, and printers).
In this chapter, we show you many different ways of defining and profiting
from new products. We help you figure out how you want to grow your com-
pany, and we look at whether developing new products is important to your
growth. If you decide that it isn’t, you can put this book down. But we bet
that after reading this chapter, you’ll be more convinced than ever that 
developing new products is critical to the success of your business.
Growing Your Business: Market
Expansion, Acquisition, or Innovation?
A company’s ability to grow is essential to its long-term success. Business
growth is tied to shareholder equity growth and to the ability of the business
to fund new initiatives. Organizations that fail to grow over time usually find
themselves slipping behind their competitors and may end up out of busi-
ness altogether. So, how will you choose to grow your company?
Companies can grow their businesses in three ways: Some put more empha-
sis on expanding into new markets with existing products, others grow by
acquisition, and some focus mainly on developing new products. Here are
closer looks at each of these ways of growing:
 Expanding into new markets with existing products: You may have
plenty of products in your traditional markets, but have you thought
about how to put your products into new markets? For example, a com-
pany could extend its products’ lifecycles by selling products developed
for more sophisticated markets in less sophisticated markets (see
Chapter 3 for more on product lifecycles). Last year’s computer may not
sell well in Tokyo or California, for example, but it may sell very well in
Venezuela or Senegal, where consumers will see it as brand new.
 Acquiring other businesses: Other businesses may have technologies,
products, markets, customers, or other assets that would complement
yours. Companies merge with other organizations or acquire them in
24
Part I: The Basics of New Product Development 

order to gain access to new markets and sell more products. Mergers
and acquisitions also can significantly expand your company’s technol-
ogy and product development capacities (see Chapter 16).
Nearly everyone complains that the total value of two companies that
have merged is almost always less than the value of the two companies
before the merger. Be prudent in your decision to merge, and expect that
M&As (mergers and acquisitions) may create at least as many problems
as they solve.
 Developing new products: Because you’re knee-deep in this book, we
assume that you’re very interested in this option. No surprise, it’s our
favorite, too. When your company’s growth strategy includes a healthy
measure of new product development (NPD), you focus on your internal
strengths in NPD and technology, encourage your development teams to
understand your customers very well (Chapter 4), and stay on the look-
out for markets and acquisitions that can support your NPD efforts.
Clateo Castelliani, former CEO of Becton-Dickinson, used to say that of
the three growth choices, new product development is the one that
spurs the organic growth of a company.
We believe that the best growth recipe is to blend the ingredients from the
previous list in ways that allow them to enhance each other in order to meet
your growth goals. A new market can often be the key ingredient in a new
product’s success, and partnering brings in added technology and other
capacity. See Chapters 13 and 16 for more on the connections between new
markets, new partners, and NPD success.
Assessing the Importance of New
Products in Your Growth Plans
Some companies pay lip service to their dedication to developing new prod-
ucts. Their executives put on their smiles and talk about the importance of
innovation and new products. You may even see the word “innovation” in
these companies’ core values. But when push comes to shove — and it does,
more and more, in resource-constrained companies — these companies often
put their new product projects on hold.
When investors are screaming for quick, high returns, companies find it hard
to provide resources for projects that won’t pay off for months or even years,
and developing new products doesn’t happen overnight. Many companies
that face these pressures focus their investments on improving the sales of
existing products. Other companies focus on cost reductions or incremental
improvements to existing products. Both of these strategies are low risk and
have quicker payoffs.
25
Chapter 2: What Are You Developing, and Why?

But if you try to survive in the market with aging products, you’ll get passed
by competitors that are putting out brand-new, shiny products that lure
away your customers. Developing new products is an investment that will
sustain your company over the long haul. You need to determine the impor-
tance of developing new products in your growth plans and then take 
appropriate actions.
Companies that truly value new product development tend to exhibit the fol-
lowing characteristics:
 They set targets and have metrics to predict and measure how many
new products they’ll develop each year, and they take them seriously
(see Chapter 18).
 They manage their products as portfolios by focusing on the aggregate of
products in development and in the market when they assess how well
their companies are meeting their strategic goals. For example, they
make sure that their portfolios include some radical and risky projects
as well as lower risk, incremental projects (see Chapters 6 and 11 for
more on product portfolios).
 They implement new product development processes and practices, and
they have individuals who are accountable for managing and improving
these processes and practices (see Chapter 9).
 Over the course of several years, they introduce a stream of successful
new products that range from incremental to radical (see the later sec-
tion “Defining the Types of New Products” for more on product types).
Are these traits evident in your company? If so, we hope that you’ll use this
book to assess the success of your company’s development efforts and to see
where you can improve when it comes to NPD. If not, or if you’re not sure,
read on to find out what being successful at developing new products can
do for you.
Identifying the Role of NPD 
for Your Company
How your company approaches new product development depends on many
factors. Your company’s unique culture and personality shape your approach
to risk, the way you connect to your customers, and so on. The industry
you’re in also impacts how your company plays the NPD game. The oil indus-
try does NPD differently from the medical device industry. If you’re in food or
fashion, the board on which you play the NPD game is different from the one
for trucking or hi-tech.
26
Part I: The Basics of New Product Development 

Whatever industry you’re in, take a look at other industries to see what
they’re doing. Can you learn from the way Harley-Davidson implements
Lean development, or the way P&G manages its product lines? Many of the
improvements in NPD over the past decades have come from cross-company
and cross-industry learning.
Take a look at some of the ways in which industries differ:
 If you work in the food industry, you probably come out with “new-and-
improved” versions frequently but radical innovations relatively rarely.
 The pharmaceutical industry tends to have long lead times (it often takes
ten or more years to develop a new product), but competition and advanc-
ing science and technology apply consistent pressure to innovate.
 Financial companies always are looking to differentiate through new
product development.
 Many of the large commodity businesses (including oil companies and
waste management companies) are beginning to use their vast wealth to
innovate and develop new products.
 In fad and fashion industries, you measure product development cycles in
months, not years. How different is NPD in these companies than it is in
the pharmaceutical industry, for example?
Other business elements that impact NPD are more company-specific. Here
are five elements to consider:
 Where does your company fit in the “value chain”? The value chain
describes the process for turning raw materials into end products.
Are you on the front end of the value chain, where you sell raw materials
to others? Do you process raw materials to make them more useful to
others? Do you make parts and pieces for final products? Or do you pro-
duce products that are sold to end-users?
27
Chapter 2: What Are You Developing, and Why?
Putting your hands into all their pockets
Many businesses gain revenue from hybrid
profit models. GE Medical, for example, loans
other companies money to purchase equipment
(financial product), sells other companies the
equipment (product), sells supplies for the com-
panies to use with the equipment (after-market
product), and sells services to customers (ser-
vice). Xerox almost didn’t survive its early years
when it was trying to make a profit by selling its
copy machines. Only when it learned to rent
equipment and charge for supplies and services
did the company take off.

You can find room for innovation and product development at every
point on the value chain. For example, TetraPak launched a revolution in
packaged food when it created the aseptic cartons that are now widely
used for packaging for juices and soups. (Take a look at Chapter 4 for
more information on the value chain.)
 Who are your customers? The answer depends on your company type:
• For some companies, the customer is the consumer or end-user;
these are the B-to-C (business-to-consumer) companies. B-to-C
companies have to be very focused on their customers. They need
to design, develop, and sell products that will fly off the shelves.
These companies have to understand the rest of the value chain
as well. How can they get parts and materials that will support
quality and keep the cost low? What are the requirements of retail-
ers and wholesalers, without whom the product will have no shelf
to fly off of?
• For many companies, other businesses are their customers; these
are the B-to-B (business-to-business) companies. B-to-B organiza-
tions have to understand their customers and their customers’
customers. TetraPak, for example, had to understand not only the
food producers to whom it would sell the cartons, but also the dis-
tributors, the supermarkets, and the end-users who would have to
learn to buy soups and juices in cartons rather than in cans or
other forms of packaging.
 What’s your industry’s “clockspeed”? If rapid innovation and quick
turnover are characteristic of your industry, your company needs to
move fast, too. The market for hand-held personal devices has no room
for a manufacturer whose products take years to develop and commer-
cialize. On the other hand, if your industry is a slow mover — for exam-
ple, the chemical industry, where typical products last five or more
years — your company should implement product development
processes that are appropriate to this slower cycle. Knowing your com-
pany’s clockspeed and the clockspeeds of the suppliers and customers
you work with is critical to understanding the right pace for product
development and innovation in your company.
 What’s your source of profits/revenues? Some companies make profits
from selling products. Others profit from selling services, from leasing,
or from services and/or products that customers will need after they
purchase the original product (known as after-market sales). Many com-
panies bring in profits from a hybrid business model, which gets rev-
enue from many different sources (see the nearby sidebar). (You can
read more about this topic in Chapter 3.) Recognizing where your profits
come from is critical to the product’s business case (see Chapter 12). It
also helps product developers understand where they need to focus
their efforts.
28
Part I: The Basics of New Product Development 

 How long does it take to go from idea to product? Companies that
are implementing a Lean or Six Sigma product development process
talk about the cycle time that a process is “entitled to.” That rather
odd way of speaking is how they communicate that there’s a certain
amount of time that it “ought” to take to develop a particular product.
In the real world, it often takes longer, but the notion of entitlement
implies that there’s some low number that you can’t do better than.
Cycle times tend to be characteristic of industries: The automotive
industry has longer cycle times, the clothing industry has shorter
cycle times, and so on. Note: Radical changes can and do alter the
expected cycle time in an industry. For example, the introduction of
high throughput screening changed the basic cycle times in the pharma-
ceutical industry.
It’s a good idea to do some research to find out how much time your product
developers are entitled to by comparing your cycle times with others who
make similar products.
Defining the Types of New Products
What do we mean when we say “new product”? The term covers more ground
than you may think. Sometimes a new product is just that: the cars that hit
the dealers’ showrooms every year around Presidents’ Day, or the new drug
that does a better job of lowering your blood pressure. Some new products
introduce new lines of products and are often based on new technologies or
processes. These platforms may include a new line of furnaces, a new kind
of hotel, and so on. Still other new products are radical departures from exist-
ing products — think cellphones or online banking — while others are just
tweaks or slight alterations on existing products.
29
Chapter 2: What Are You Developing, and Why?
How mature is your company?
Usually the companies that make the mistake of
placing all their bets on radically new innovations
and products are young and headstrong. Many of
them don’t survive. The ones that make the mis-
take of betting solely on yesterday’s successes
are usually on the older side. Some of these sink
into oblivion, some are acquired for their exist-
ing competencies, and some wander off into a
complacent old age. The right new product
strategy can help you survive to maturity and
stay there, healthy and vibrant, for a long time.

Most companies that succeed in NPD create products in all three of the fol-
lowing major categories:
 Breakthrough products (sometimes referred to as radical products)
 Platform products
 Derivative and support products (also called line extensions or 
incremental products)
Understanding the differences among these types of products helps you
focus your company’s new product strategy on some projects that will pro-
vide short-term revenues and on others that will provide growth and revenue
in the future.
Breakthrough products
Breakthrough products bring new technologies to the marketplace and often
enable or require customers to do things in new ways. For example, in the late
1940s Edwin Land invented a film that developed as soon as it was exposed.
This technology breakthrough changed people’s expectations about photogra-
phy. Although its image quality never matched that of 35 mm film, the instant
camera allowed amateurs to snap photos and share the results on the spot.
The technology also provided the movie industry with a way to document sets
(a process that people in the industry still call “polaroiding,” even though the
technology is now digital), vastly simplified the process of making picture
IDs, and won contracts from industries and governments all over the world.
Corning, the same company that makes the nearly unbreakable cookware that
can go straight from your refrigerator to the oven, devoted huge resources to
develop the catalytic converter in the 1970s. It was a huge success and every
car and truck has one. However, a few decades later, Corning put a similar
effort toward developing photonics technology. The company ended up wast-
ing significant resources as the world went wireless.

Part I: The Basics of New Product Development 
Breaking through the eye of the tiger (team)
Some companies separate breakthrough prod-
uct development projects from their ongoing
NPD work. Often, the teams for these projects
are called tiger teams, or heavyweight teams.
Members of management make sure the tiger
teams get the resources they need and protect
them from overt political battles with their indi-
vidual functions.
Advocates of separating such projects from the
daily grind feel that teams are more likely to
develop really radical ideas if they’re not in daily
contact with the existing culture of the compa-
nies. It can be good to get away from the legacy
of “how it’s done around here.” For more on the
tiger team approach, head to Chapter 10.

Breakthrough products sometimes allow companies to change the game. The
really good ones can send your competitors onto the rocks as you sail off to
new markets and new profits. But breakthrough ventures also entail risk:
Technology risk: Because we’re talking about a breakthrough — a radical
departure from what’s been done before — no one can guarantee that the
product will really end up working. Many pharmaceutical products are
breakthroughs — the first of their kind to introduce a whole new class of
drugs or a whole new approach to a disease into the market. Automobile
manufacturers are working on breakthrough engine designs, from electric
to hybrid to hydrogen fuel cell.
Market risk: Because radical new products often require new customer
behaviors and literally create new needs in the market, there’s always a
chance — sometimes a big chance — that customers won’t adopt the
new product. Many radical market entries fail to “cross the chasm”
from the small percent of the market that’s intrigued by the latest gadget
to the market majority who have to buy the gadget before it becomes a
money maker.
What the company is risking is opportunity — the opportunity to devote
time and resources to other, surer bets. The risk entailed in developing 
breakthrough products includes the following:
 They usually take a long time to develop. Typically, radical or break-
through products start as a vision of what the company could do in a
particular technology or market area. Unlike improvements to products
that already exist, the company must place its bets on a possibility that
requires research — maybe not basic scientific research, but research
into the technology feasibility and the potential market acceptance of its
new idea.
 At some point, developing a breakthrough product usually requires a
lot of resources. The company must invest significant amounts in R&D,
in infrastructure (such as manufacturing), and in market research and
development.
When Japanese car companies decided to develop and market the hybrid
auto, they had to invest significant manpower over significant periods of
time, and they were taking a market risk that none of the major U.S. compa-
nies were willing to take. In retrospect, as other automakers scramble to keep
up, it’s clear that the Japanese automakers’ decision was a smart one. But
when they took the step, they were taking a chance that very few of their
peers were willing to take.
To be successful at developing breakthrough products, a company needs
strong management support for the necessary risk taking and innovation. It
also helps to have a robust “bottom-up” culture where people regularly work
on projects that fall outside the normal routine.
31
Chapter 2: What Are You Developing, and Why?

A product champion — a person in the organization who works with the NPD
team and is committed to the project — can make the difference between
“flash-in-the-pan” status and success for breakthrough projects (see Chapter 1
for more on product champions).
Platform products
Many companies develop platform products in order to make major changes
in existing product lines and to come up with new product lines. A platform is
a product that forms the base for a whole set of products. For example, a
blender manufacturer will design the basics of a new blender line — the motor,
the container, the base, the cover, and so on — and use that as the fundamen-
tal architecture or framework for a whole line of blenders. It’s an easy job to
add or subtract dials, to add a fancy cover, and to use other tweaks to differ-
entiate the top of the line from the bottom. This can be a very cost-effective
way to develop a whole range of new products. (For more on platforms, take
a look at Chapters 3 and 11.)
It’s too expensive to incur infrastructure costs or to make radical changes/
innovations every time a team comes up with a good idea. Therefore, many
companies wait until they have a handful of prospective changes and bundle
them together to design a new platform.
Companies in the automobile industry use a product development strategy
based on a clear, timed sequence of product platforms. Every five years or
so, automakers come out with new vehicle models. The models have differ-
ences, such as the engines, the styles, the interiors, the brakes, and so on.
The new autos that you see in between these platforms are based on rela-
tively simple changes that don’t require new manufacturing capacities or
changes to the vehicle platform.
When new safety regulations hit the power-tool industry, many companies
responded by making their power tools larger and more unwieldy. At Black &
Decker, product developers — led by platform guru Al Lehnerd — pondered
over what to do and came up with a brilliant solution: Instead of simply adding
more stuff to the company’s existing products in order to comply with the
regulations, why not redesign the whole platform?
The team developed a modularized motor that could be stacked to provide
different amounts of power for different tools. Using this and other “platform”
approaches, Black & Decker met the new regulations with tools that performed
even better than its previous models, and it nearly put the competition out of
business.
The two previous examples — from the power-tool industry and the auto
industry — suggest two different ways of thinking about product platforms.
When you change one of your product lines, be sure you review the whole
product at the same time and create efficiencies of design, architecture, and
32
Part I: The Basics of New Product Development 

infrastructure. Even more important, try to bring platform thinking to the
way you develop new products. Instead of viewing every new product as an
opportunity for your product developers to be “creative,” try to regularize
and standardize how you develop products. Seek common architectures,
increase the modularity of your designs, and reward your engineers for how
much existing design they reuse. Be sure, however, that the specifications
you design for meet a wide range of clearly identified customer needs (see
Chapter 4).
Platform thinking requires management oversight, support, and encourage-
ment. Platform projects require more resources in the beginning for payoffs
later in the process. To succeed at platform design, NPD teams need to have
a very good understanding of customer requirements (see Chapter 4) and of
the state and future of technology (see Chapter 7). Bottom line: You shouldn’t
leap into platform development without planning and support.
Developing a platform takes a larger investment than developing a single
product — both in time and in people and other resources. The business
case for a platform project isn’t the same as the case for a single one.
The NPD team that creates the business case should show financials over a
spread of projects that the platform will spawn. (See Chapter 12 for more on
writing business cases.)
Derivative and support products
Derivative and support products include line extensions (for example, adding a
new faucet to an existing faucet line), incremental improvements (adding a
spray feature to a faucet that’s already in the market), cost reductions,
and other changes to products that a company already has in the market.
Derivative product changes are very important. They enable your company
to refresh existing product lines and to maintain its investment in those lines.
33
Chapter 2: What Are You Developing, and Why?
Customer needs cross platforms
Becton-Dickinson (BD) builds its blood analyz-
ers to serve two markets: the research market
and the clinical market. BD used to design dif-
ferent machines to sell to its two different sets
of customers. The company realized that plat-
form thinking could help them become more
efficient in designing its blood analyzers. They
brought co-author Beebe in to work with a team
that visited customers in both markets and
developed sets of requirements for them (see
Chapter 4 for more on customer visits). When
the team compared the two sets of require-
ments, it discovered that the company could
design one basic analyzer and differentiate it for
the two markets, which was much more effi-
cient than its old approach of developing two
totally different machines.

The food industry is famous for its line extensions and product improve-
ments — you can’t walk through the supermarket aisles without “new and
improved” flashing from boxes of crackers or cans of soup. And no software
company ever hesitated to advertise the newest version of a game or word
processing program.
Planning for derivative and support products is part of the planning you do
when you design and launch a product platform (see the previous section).
For example, you may launch a platform into the market as a mid-priced
product aimed at familiar customers. The platform project includes plans to
create next-on, or derivative, products aimed at other markets and/or other
price points.
Good product line management requires that you stay abreast of changing cus-
tomer needs and technologies (see Chapters 4 and 7) so that your derivative
products will attract new customers, retain the old ones, and take advantage
of technology advances. Well-managed product lines can bring in handsome
returns, over time, on your company’s investments.
Balancing your product portfolio
You want to distinguish between the types of new products so that you can
assess how well your company’s new product portfolio is balanced. Do your
projects address both the long range and the short term? Are you taking the
kinds of risks that “breakthrough” implies? Do you pay enough attention to
your existing product lines and refresh them appropriately?
You have many other questions to answer about the balance of your product
portfolio. For instance, are you focusing on a strategic range of markets? Are
you distributing your resources across product lines? We talk about these
product portfolio questions in Chapter 11.
Making the Most of Products, Services,
Solutions, and Experiences
Some companies develop and market products, and some companies
develop and market services. In today’s business world, though, more and
more companies look first at the needs and wants of their customers and
then they develop solutions and experiences that combine products and ser-
vices to meet all those needs and wants. You shouldn’t limit your thinking
about products to just products, or your thinking about services to just ser-
vices. Expanding your horizons can expand your customer base, your profits,
and the lifecycles of your products.
34
Part I: The Basics of New Product Development 

Customers don’t really care how smart product developers are, how elegant
their technologies are, or how well they stick to their cost and schedule tar-
gets. Customers care about the products they buy solving their problems,
improving their processes, or making their lives a bit brighter and happier.
The following list presents some examples of “products” featuring extras that
customers pay for; some of the examples are more like “services that come
with extras”:
 The product includes the experience. When you buy your coffee at a
high-end coffee shop, you pay much more per cup of coffee than you
would if you bought the beans and made the coffee yourself at home.
You’re paying for what product developers call the experience. Maybe
you like calling the person behind the counter a “barista” and listening
to the soft jazz that permeates the establishment. The same experience
logic is at work when you pay big money for a birthday cake that comes
with a party or for food at a fancy restaurant.
 The solution includes specialized knowledge. Product developers
know a lot about their industries, their technologies, and their products.
When product developers visit their customers (see Chapter 4), they often
find that their knowledge, as much as their products, can fill customers’
needs. For example, a company that provides a chemical ingredient to
small businesses discovered that its customers needed consulting ser-
vices to help them optimize their manufacturing processes and their use
of the chemical. Combining the commodity ingredient with the knowledge
of how to use it meant the company could attract more customers and
charge a higher price.
35
Chapter 2: What Are You Developing, and Why?
Connecting inside-out and outside-in
From the viewpoint of a company, the product
or service that it develops and sells to the cus-
tomer is what truly matters. This describes the
inside-out view. From the customers’ point of
view, the experiences they have with the prod-
uct or service and how well it solves their prob-
lems are the most important factors. This
describes the outside-in view.
We’re sure that the broadband Internet features
that allow us to watch thousands of movies, live
sporting events, late-breaking news, and even
live cop chases (if that’s your thing) required
amazing technology to develop. We certainly
admire the very intelligent people who made it
possible. But co-author Beebe Nelson wants to
get this off her chest: It routinely takes her and
her husband 15 minutes or more to figure out how
to get the broadband to work. She won’t settle
for the conclusion that she and her husband are
just dumb, and even if they are, they represent a
big percent of the market. They’d gladly switch
to whoever can solve their problem!

 The product developer takes over some of your work. Johnson Controls,
for example, doesn’t sell air-handling equipment. They come to your
building, ask you lots of questions, look around, and figure out the best
system for you. The company then delivers the system, manages it for
you, and keeps your air at the temperature and humidity that you want.
Because Johnson Controls does its job well, the process doesn’t cost as
much as it would if you did it yourself, so part of what the company
makes money on is those savings.
 Other great things support the product or service. Automakers and
dealerships are waking up to the fact that part of what can make cars
attractive includes providing excellent service. Toyota, for example,
makes sure that its customers are aware that after they fall in love with
a new Lexus, they have the chance to fall in love with the company’s 
luxurious service offerings. Airlines used to add give-away products
(dinners and such) to complement their services. Today, airlines try to
substitute funny flight attendants and the latest in peanuts or pretzels.
The airline industry is an example of a cash-strapped industry that, for
now, is competing pretty much only on price.
 You get the service plus more. Enterprise offers nice rental vehicles at
okay prices. But the company wins a customer’s heart by picking her up
at home so she doesn’t have to pay for a cab or get a ride from a friend,
and adds little benefits like remembering to give her a bottle of water
before she drives away.
 The brand/cause influences the purchase. Sometimes, a customer just
wants to be able to identify himself as the cool person on the block.
Young women buy Coach handbags and middle-aged guys buy Harley
motorcycles, for example. Today, brands often try to associate with
causes in an effort to attract new customers. For example, many compa-
nies are “going green” by becoming more environmentally sensitive in
their manufacturing and packaging processes. Other companies con-
tribute portions of their profits to AIDS research or hunger relief.
This list gives you a sampling of how products and services endear them-
selves to customers by being wrapped up with extra features. It certainly
isn’t an exhaustive list; product developers add to the list every day. Always
be on the lookout for what could make your camera (photography lessons?),
your adhesive tape (graffiti?), or your dry-cleaning service (a home delivery
service or environmentally friendly fluids?) more attractive to customers.

Chapter 3
Defining Your Product Strategy
In This Chapter
 Making market assessments
 Mapping your product lines
 Reviewing the product lifecycle
 Identifying ways for your products to make money
 Syncing your products with your brand
A
company’s product strategy guides its decisions and actions with
respect to developing new products, entering new markets, improving
or retiring existing products or product lines, taking risks, and so on. A prod-
uct strategy also defines how a company’s products will make money — in
other words, its business model or profit model. All companies have product
strategies, but some have never taken the time and trouble to make their
strategies explicit.
Your company’s product strategy must consider your markets and your
brand. Your organization will have great contacts and good customer rela-
tions in some markets; in some, you may not be so well thought of; and in
other markets, no one has even heard of you. Your company is part of an
industry in which you play a role: a supplier to some and a manufacturer to
others. Your brand shapes your approach to products as well, opening some
doors and closing others.
As you can see, you have many things to consider when defining your prod-
uct strategy. In this chapter, we lead you through the thorny underbrush of
your company’s existing landscape. We show you when you should “go with
the flow” with how you relate to customers, products, markets, and your
brand. We also show you how to map your opportunities and the risks and
benefits of pursuing the conservative and the adventurous options.

Understanding the Market
The best new product idea in the world won’t succeed without a market in
which to find customers. Duh! So, why do we mention this? You want the
market for your product to be accessible, full of potential customers, and
devoid of competition. Okay, even we can’t tell you how to get that situation.
But in the sections that follow, we tell you what to look for in real-world mar-
kets so you can improve your chances of selling your new products.
Assessing markets
The most successful companies focus their new product strategies on portfo-
lios of markets where their products — existing and new — have the best
chance to succeed. Your marketing executives often have the responsibility
of assessing markets, but your cross-functional NPD team should carry out
the process we describe here to make sure that you include relevant informa-
tion from plenty of differing viewpoints.
Your organization should answer the following three questions to help you
decide which markets to enter, which to stay in, and which to leave:
 How attractive is the market? Look at the size of the market, your com-
pany’s existing share of the market, and your ability to get to customers
in that market:
• How many customers do you have in that market, and how many
could you have? These numbers show the potential of the market.
If your company already has a large market share, you can’t count
on that market for a lot of growth. It may provide you with good
revenues, but it may not be a good candidate for new products.
The exception is a market where your company could lose cus-
tomers because your tried-and-true products won’t continue to
please customers in the future.
• Can you get to customers in the market? Maybe you have channels
of distribution that work really well to get products to customers
in this market. On the other hand, maybe you don’t know how to
get your product to the customer. If you don’t already have good
distribution in a market, don’t despair; a good channel partner
may solve your problems.
Channel partners can get your products to customers who will buy
them. For example, a medical device company might pair up with a
company that sells a variety of medical equipment, and companies
that manufacture pens might choose distributors of stationery
supplies. For many products, a big-box store such as Home Depot or
38
Part I: The Basics of New Product Development 

Wal-Mart can make or break the deal. And don’t forget the Internet!
Many products reach customers through a variety of Web sites.
• Can the customers in the market afford your product(s)? You
have to be sure that customers in your targeted markets want your
product, that you can get it to them, and that they can pay for it.
U.S. pharmaceutical companies, for example, continue to struggle
with the dilemma of how to get drugs to the customers and mar-
kets that really need them but can’t afford to pay for them. In these
markets, distribution is usually a problem as well.
 Where is the market headed? If the market doesn’t have room to grow,
it may not be an attractive option for your new products. Look for a
growing market where the kinds of products you want to introduce may
be just taking off. What are the “aging boomers” going to want in a couple
of years, for example? What opportunities will awareness of healthy foods
open up? In a growing market, your product sales have a chance to meet
your expectations and goals.
When you identify growth rates and trends, you’re predicting the future,
which means you can’t be certain of your conclusions. Examine the
market, gather data, review it, and check your assumptions to see whether
they’re accurate. Just because you can’t be certain of your conclusions
doesn’t mean you can’t make educated guesses.
 Who are your competitors in the market, and what threats do they pose
to you and your product(s)? You need to understand who your competi-
tors are, how many of them exist in the market, and exactly how they’ll
compete with you and your product. You should assess their offerings,
determine the pricing structure for these offerings, and identify which
customers the competitors appeal to. Also, take a look at the technical
capabilities (see Chapter 7) and the launch strategies (see Chapter 13)
of your competitors. You may be able to compete with them on those
parameters and win away some of the market.
Don’t forget that some competitors can help you — think of how fast-food
joints often turn up on the same corners, or how automobile dealers tend
to herd to one strip of road in what we’ve started to call “AutoMiles.”
Comparing markets with a market portfolio
Your company’s decision makers can use the market information you gather
when researching existing and potential markets (see the previous section)
to build a picture of how potential markets compare. This picture is called a
market portfolio. A market portfolio also enables your company to update
market information so that you can build a corporate knowledge base that
improves your company’s decision-making process over time.
39
Chapter 3: Defining Your Product Strategy

The market portfolio in Figure 3-1 shows how potential markets stack up
against the criteria of market attractiveness and competitive threat. This
portfolio view also includes several other variables that are important to
strategic decision-making.
In Figure 3-1, each circle represents a potential market. The white portion of
each circle shows the company’s share of that market. The shading shows
the overall growth rate of the market, from fast (light) to shrinking (dark).
The following list explains some of the things you can figure out by looking at
the portfolio in Figure 3-1:
 Markets A and B are the largest. In A, the company has a large share
of the market, which is shrinking. Not a good bet for new product 
introductions!
 Markets B and C are holding steady. A company could still gain sizeable
market share, so it should take a look to see whether a new introduction
could take share from competitors.
Be aware that taking share in an established market often is harder than
gaining share in a growing market.

 Market D is experiencing moderate growth, and the company’s share
is relatively small (less than 25 percent). In this market, the competi-
tion will greatly affect the company’s probability of success. Are the
other companies large and aggressive, with good channel and technol-
ogy assets? If so, Market D may be a tough market for new products.
However, if the competition is more fragmented, Market D may be a
good bet for new product introductions.
 Market E seems almost too good to be true. The market appears to be
highly attractive, and the company’s competitive position is strong.
The company has only a small share of this rapidly growing market.
Research your assumptions; if they check out, you may want to put sev-
eral of your chips on this space.Identifying
Opportunities in Existing Product Lines
The new products that a company develops and commercializes arrive in the
market alongside existing products and product lines. Many “new” products
are tweaks to products that already exist in a market — incremental improve-
ments or even cost reductions, for example. Some companies introduce
major changes and improvements to products that consumers are familiar
with — for example, automobile companies make major changes to their car
lines every four to five years. The cars still have the same names, such as
Camry or Wrangler, but the companies have updated them, restyled them,
made them more efficient, and so on.
Some new products launch whole new product lines — sometimes called
product platforms or product families.
New product lines can take a
company into a new business, or they may offer additional products within
an existing business. For example, a pharmaceutical company could reformu-
late the drugs it developed for humans and offer them in the veterinary
market. Or, a company may find that the process it developed to form glass
for test tubes and other lab equipment also works for producing specialty
glass products.
Sometimes, a company develops a radical, or breakthrough, technology or
product. A company may find itself entering a market so new that it has
to figure out new ways to bring its product to market. Even at this stage,
though, a company has to take into account its existing products and
existing brand. The fit may be as neat as an iPod into an Apple. Sometimes, a
breakthrough cannibalizes an existing product and shifts a company’s brand
image — like when Harley-Davidson decided to introduce the much racier
Buell motorcycle.
41
Chapter 3: Defining Your Product Strategy

In this section, you find out how to chart your products and the lifecycles of
your existing product lines so that you can go after opportunities strategically.
(Check out Chapter 11 for more about how companies diversify their new
products across portfolios of incremental, new, and breakthrough projects,
and head to the final section of this chapter for more on introducing new
products to your brand.)
Mapping product lines
A product line map shows your products and product lines against a timeline
so you can see what your company has in the market, what you’re develop-
ing, and what you’re planning. But, hey, your company is in the thick of it.
You don’t have enough time or resources to do everything you want to do.
Everyone is busy. You’re developing products that meet your customers’
needs. Wall Street and your investors seem pretty happy. What will making a
map of your product lines do for you?
Companies that work from inside the “thick of it” run into trouble in
several ways:
 They tend to focus their efforts on “me too,” incremental products.
Companies without explicit product strategies tend to choose the safe
and familiar over the risky and unfamiliar. They stop being innovative
and find their competitive edge slipping away.
 They focus almost exclusively on the needs of their most important
customers. “What’s wrong with that?” you ask. This is why it’s a prob-
lem. When companies focus too much on the needs of only a few of their
larger customers, they forget that one of their most important responsi-
bilities isn’t to say “how high” when customers say “jump.” Companies
need to innovate: to understand future trends, to develop resources to
meet those trends, and to coordinate their capabilities so that products
they develop for one customer help satisfy the needs of another.
Innovation is what keeps companies competitive.
 Their product development efforts have no rationale or strategy. The
work they do isn’t leveraged. They don’t plan for the future. And they
operate in an opportunistic or responsive mode. Every new opportunity
seems to require a “back to the drawing board” development effort. If the
companies get lucky, things work out; if not, their development efforts
fail. For sure, they don’t sit in the driver’s seat.
To find your way through the “thick of it,” you literally need a map. The fol-
lowing sections show you how to make the map you need.
42
Part I: The Basics of New Product Development 

Making a template to map your product lines
The first step in mapping your product lines is setting up a mapping tem-
plate. Figure 3-2 shows a straightforward template for your mapping tasks.
You can tailor this template to fit the needs of your company and your prod-
uct lines. We recommend that you add dates to the map to show, for example,
when your company plans to introduce or retire different products.
You can use the following labels for easy identification:
 PIMs: For “products in the market”
 PIDs: For “products in development”
 PICs: For “product innovation charters”
PICs are projects that are in the ocean of opportunity; PIDs are in the river of
development; and PIMs are in the market, earning money. Take a look at the
Cheat Sheet in the front of the book for more on these stages.
“Redwood,” “Oak,” and “Maple” are the names of the three major product
lines for the fictitious business shown in Figure 3-2. Redwood has two prod-
ucts in the market; Oak has three. Each of the product lines has one PID.
Maple’s PID will launch that product line. The company also has two product
innovation charters.

Chapter 3: Defining Your Product Strategy

When you come up with an acceptable template, keep using the same format
over and over. This way, you can compare the information you map between
different product lines and periods of time. Also, when you use the same tem-
plate, people involved in product development efforts can concentrate on the
information instead of being confused by the format.
Starting the mapping process
The process of mapping your company’s product lines is a business level
strategic process. The people who do the mapping are the planners and 
decision-makers at the corporate or business unit level. Like all strategic ini-
tiatives, you won’t map your product lines in a sitting. In the list that follows,
we sketch the basic do’s and don’ts for getting the process right:
1. Assign someone to be the process owner. The mapping process needs a
shepherd — preferably someone with a strategic mindset and good facil-
itation skills. The process owner should report directly to the business
unit executives.
2. Decide on the scope of your product line map. Corporations, like chick-
ens, have joints. Sometimes, the right way to “divide” the chicken is to
serve it whole. You can include all the company’s or business unit’s
product lines in a single map if your company is fairly small or if your
product lines are similar (based on the same technology and/or focused
on the same markets).
If your company is divided into business units, you may want to carry
out a mapping process for each business unit. If your company is large
and diverse — think 3M, GE, or J&J — you may implement several map-
ping processes within a single business unit.
3. Gather the business’s key planners and decision makers to discuss the
process. Mapping product lines is an iterative process. Often, the best
ways to map product lines emerge after several discussions.
4. Set up a series of meetings to kick off the process. For instance, you
can set up four 2-hour meetings — one each week for a month.
5. Hold the first meeting. At this meeting, you identify the company’s or the
business unit’s product lines. What are the product lines? How many are
there? How will you divide the products in a useful and rational manner?
Make sure that what’s said at the meeting is documented — preferably on
large wall charts so that everyone can follow the conversations. We find
that it works to use sticky notes to post ideas; this way, everyone can nom-
inate candidates, and you can easily move and change the nominations.
Don’t expect to come up with easy answers to the question “What are
our product lines?” The reason you hold several meetings to kick off the
mapping process is because you can’t finish right away. The first meet-
ing gets everyone’s ideas out on the table (or up on the wall). Instead of
44
Part I: The Basics of New Product Development 

continuing to slog it out, you call a break so people can come back sev-
eral days later with a fresh outlook.
6. Do work between meetings. At the end of the first meeting, the group
should agree on assignments for group members to finish between 
meetings. Two pieces of work, in particular, need to be completed:
• Document the discussion at the first meeting. It’s best to distrib-
ute the documentation soon after the meeting, so the person han-
dling this task should save some time that afternoon or the next
morning for documentation.
• Answer questions that come up during the meeting. These ques-
tions may include: When did that product line first enter the
market? What are the financials/P&L for that product line? Which
markets do these products currently serve? The process owner
should assign people to bring these answers to the next meeting.
7. Hold the next meetings. As people in the group think more about the
product lines and gather more information, they’ll start to make deci-
sions about how they want to map the products and product lines.
8. The facilitator or process owner should pick a format for drawing the
map. The example we provide in Figure 3-2 is a good beginning. Be sure
to include a timeline, and keep in mind that timelines vary from industry
to industry. Take a look at the technology maps in Chapter 7 for exam-
ples of some maps that include specific timelines.
We recommend that the facilitator draw the first draft of the map on a
large wall chart so that everyone can contribute. After the meeting the
facilitator can create an electronic version. PowerPoint works, but a
more updatable medium like Microsoft Excel or Visio works better.
Many companies now make software that can produce, update, and share
product line maps. You may want to look into what’s available. Just be
sure that the software helps you do what you want to do; some software
packages can lead you down an endless path of process redesign.
9. At the last meeting, if not before, set up the process by which you’ll use
the map to guide your strategic decision making. Maps don’t do you
any good unless you use them! You need to think of the following things:
• Who should you include in the reviews?
• How often will you update the information, and who will you allow
to add or change information?
• How will you share the information, and who will have access to it?
• How will you communicate decisions?
• How will this process relate to the product development process,
the technology development process, and so on?
45
Chapter 3: Defining Your Product Strategy

Making strategic decisions based on your maps
Now comes the point where your decision makers get to use the information
from your product line map to identify the good, the bad, and the ugly in
your existing and planned product lines.
Consider the example from Figure 3-2 once again in order to see this process
in action. The organization’s map shows the following characteristics:
It currently has two product lines and a total of five products in the market.
It has two upgrades (Rw1a and Oak2a) in the development pipeline.
Redwood’s timeline ends with an “X,” indicating that the company will
phase it out in the near future.
The company is planning a new product line, Maple; the first product is in
development, and the second is in the planning stage.
So, what do you think? With this scant amount of information, how would you
judge the company’s product line, and what changes would you make?
Here’s our take on it. For the company’s small number of existing products
(from which we assume we’re looking at a small company or business unit),
it seems to have good balance. We believe the company has made good deci-
sions about how to use its resources to generate a steady stream of new
products that complement its existing product lines. Why do we believe this?
 The organization devotes some resources to upgrading existing products.
 It plans to add an entirely new product to one of the lines (Oak).
46
Part I: The Basics of New Product Development 
Defining product lines
What defines your product lines? Is it the razor
or the razor blade? The camera or the film? The
software or the service? The motorcycle or the
owners’ groups? You need to spend some time
puzzling over this question because the answer
isn’t always crystal clear. You want to consider
such things as the following:
 What generates your profits?
 How do your customers identify you?
 What’s your base technology, and how does
it relate to your products?
In one photography company, for example, film
drove profits, technology, and even customer
perceptions. Its cameras were important, no
doubt, but their importance was to support
media sales and media use. The company
mapped its film product lines and integrated
everything else around that.

 It made the decision to phase out one product family and replace it with
a new line.
 It plans to grow by adding a whole new product line.
If the product map you create looks this good, congratulations! If not, you
now have the tools to conduct the discussions, gather the information, make
the decisions, and take the actions to rationalize your product line map.
The fictitious company in the product line map based some of its decisions
on the lifecycles of its products and product lines. Take a look at the next 
section to find out how understanding the product lifecycle helps you make
product decisions. And take a look at Chapter 7 to see how to connect product
line maps with technology maps andfor more on understanding the role of
maps in product planning.
Understanding the product lifecycle
Most products have fairly predictable lifecycles:
1. They enter the market and their sales grow (hopefully!).
2. If all goes well, they plateau into a period of healthy maturity. If not, they
may fall off early and generate disappointing returns. On the other hand,
some products seem to go on forever.
3. Toward the end of their maturity, the products either die off or continue
in a kind of limbo existence.
Innovative companies track and manage their products’ lifecycles. They find
ways to improve their products and extend their lives, and they retire prod-
ucts with dignity when they’ve served their purposes. However, too many
companies aren’t very savvy when it comes to understanding product lifecy-
cles. (We’re very much indebted to Steven Haines and Sequent Learning
Networks for gathering information on how some successful companies
manage their product lifecycles. Without Steven’s work, we’d still be in
the dark!)
When you draft the business case for a new product (see Chapter 12), you
should plan on the product taking some time to achieve maturity (how long it
takes depends largely on the industry). You often can figure on robust profits
and margins for several years. Again, how many depends on the industry;
typically, the lifecycle is longer for drugs and trucks and shorter for software
and services, for example. Too many companies make the bad assumption
that after they launch their products, they can go on enjoying profits forever.
47
Chapter 3: Defining Your Product Strategy

See Figure 3-3 for a picture of a “normal” lifecycle curve. We say “normal”
because the different products you develop and market may have variations
on normal, so you need to check their progress by looking at key indicators,
which include the following:
 Sales
 Customer acceptance
 Market penetration
 Key financial metrics
Always be aware that you can influence the shape of the lifecycle curve by the
market tactics you employ and by the timing of new product introductions.
In the following sections, we introduce the stages of the product lifecycle.
We also include some information on the lifecycles of product platforms,
which are somewhat different from the lifecycles of products. Understanding
the difference will help you manage your existing platforms. (For more on
managing product lifecycles, we recommend that you read “Overview and
Context for Life-Cycle Management,” by Bill Ausura, Bob Gill, and Steven
Haines. You can find it in The PDMA Handbook for New Product Development,
2nd Edition, by Kenneth Kahn [Wiley].)

Part I: The Basics of New Product Development 

Many companies appoint product managers to be the mini-business owners
for products and product lines in the market. Their job is to work with the
product development teams — they often lead these teams — to make sure
that the products are successful in the market.
Introduction
In the introduction phase of a product’s lifecycle, you can expect relatively
small sales and low initial revenue. The most important tasks in the first
part of the lifecycle are to promote the product and build awareness in the
marketplace.
Many newly introduced products have to “cross the chasm” during the first
stage of the lifecycle. When a product hits the market, it often starts by
appealing to a small group of customers who don’t represent the larger target
market. You want to promote and distribute your product so you’ll get to not
only the early enthusiasts, but also the much larger market you must reach
to make your product successful.
Growth
The second phase of the product lifecycle — the growth phase — is vital to
the product’s success. In Figure 3-3, you can see that profits are directly
linked to how fast and how high the curve rises during this early phase.
The most important tasks in the growth stage include the following:
 Promote the product.
 Make sure the product is available by managing the channels and the
supply chain.
 Keep close to the market and your customers.
What do your customers adore about the product? What doesn’t please them?
And what can you do to improve the product? You can use the answers to all
these questions to support your product in its growth phase.
When your product is in its growth phase, you need to start thinking ahead
to new products and product improvements:
 You begin to plan improvements and cost reductions.
 You try to identify opportunities for enhanced margins through product
add-ons or services.
 Your understanding of customers provides insight about what new prod-
uct you may want to develop next.
49
Chapter 3: Defining Your Product Strategy

For example, you may find that your product sells well to your more 
sophisticated customers. However, a defeatured, easier-to-use, and perhaps
less-expensive product may work well for another niche. You can use your
work in managing the growth phase to build your product lines and pursue
an effective and comprehensive product strategy. See previous sections in
this chapter for more on product lines.
Maturity
As your product moves into the maturity stage of the lifecycle, you should
expect to see competitors moving in to take some of your market share. This
competition is likely to drive down margins. In addition, the technology or
innovation on which your product is based may be beginning to mature.
At this point in the lifecycle, your job is to optimize your product “mix” by
exploring one of the following options:
 Prune your offerings to provide better focus. If your dealers are having
trouble selling five different furnace options, for example, you may want
to cut back to the most popular two.
 Add “new and improved” products to attract new customers. This trick
works especially well with many consumer products. Cracker companies,
for example, keep us coming back for the next new flavor, size, texture,
package size, shape, and so on.
 Fill in your product line to extend the offerings. If your standard prod-
uct has done well, maybe you’ll want to add features. For example,
make a cell phone that can take pictures or a blender that can whip up
exotic drinks.
The maturity phase is a good time to rethink your pricing, explore new 
markets, and perhaps investigate options like private labeling — allowing a
distributor like Wal-Mart or Target to put its brand on your product and sell
it as if it were its own — to extend the viability of your product.
Decline and retirement
In the decline phase, product revenues slow down. Customers wander off to
greener pastures and newer products. You need to be willing to recognize the
signs and make plans that are appropriate to the decline. Don’t make the mis-
take of blindly supporting a product that has pretty much outlived its useful
life. Be sure to take good care of your remaining customers; keep your focus
on any revenues or gains you can make by selling the product you have; and
only produce what you need to keep going during this phase.
50
Part I: The Basics of New Product Development 

Before you make the decision that your mature product is on a decline,
take another look. Some products and product lines can maintain excellent
sales, consumer loyalty, and good to great margins for a very long time.
Coke Classic is an example of this. Coca-Cola’s near-fatal error to try to
improve Coke Classic is a good warning to leave good enough alone —
as long as that good enough is building brand loyalty and bringing in the 
profits.
Some of the things you should do when a product or product line hits
decline include the following:
 Cut back on inventory.
 Cut back on advertising, or even stop advertising altogether.
 Consider selling intellectual property if you won’t reuse it in another
product (see Chapter 15 for more on IP).
When one product or product line is in decline, it may be the perfect time to
introduce a whole new product line. If you go this route, see whether you can
lure existing customers to your new products, perhaps by offering them an
incentive such as a percent price reduction.
During the decline phase of the lifecycle, you also need to make plans for
product retirement. Your decision makers should specify the conditions
under which your product will exit the market. For instance, you may cut ties
when existing inventory runs out or when a new product is introduced.
51
Chapter 3: Defining Your Product Strategy
A platform on platforms . . .
Different companies have different definitions
for the term “platform.” Some use it to describe
a technology that can produce many different
products or parts of products. For example,
think of the braking system that GM puts into all
its cars. Others use it to describe a basic prod-
uct that can be varied so that one product
development effort can produce many products.
Most customers don’t notice or care that the
products they buy are built from the same base.
An example is the ink jet printer. You can buy
one with plenty of bells and whistles, no bells
and whistles, or just a few. The printer’s devel-
oper saves a ton of time and money by not
having to invent many different products. Some
low-cost and low-function products even con-
tain the added functionality of the high-priced
products; consumers just can’t access the addi-
tional features. If they want them, they need to
pay the higher price.

Platforms
You know that products and product lines have lifecycles. What you may not
know is that the engines that support those products and product lines —
product and technology platforms — also go through lifecycles (see Chapter 2
for more information about what product platforms are and how product
developers use them).
When companies develop platforms, they look across a spectrum of cus-
tomer needs and technologies to see how they can best leverage their new
product development investments. Platforms are like the soup stock you
made from last year’s Thanksgiving turkey. You don’t put the turkey stock on
the table; you use it as a base for sauces, soups, stews, and so on. In the
same way, you don’t sell a platform to a customer; you use it and reuse it to
build many attractive and competitive products.
When a platform approaches the end of its lifecycle, you should consider
developing a new platform. Here are two situations in which developing a
new platform would be a good idea:
 You have an idea for a new product or service that you don’t currently
offer. The project will require technology, design, and development in
order to make it to market. All this development will cost quite a bit —
maybe so much that the business case for a single product doesn’t make
sense. However, if you can plan a sequence of products, the business
case may look a whole lot better (see Figure 3-4).
When you write the business case for the product platform, remember
that the first product may not look like a financial winner. You have to
base your business case on the platform or product family, not on a
single introduction (see Chapter 12 and the Appendix for more on writ-
ing a business case).
52
Part I: The Basics of New Product Development 
Whirlpool’s global refrigerator platform
A series of product introductions leverages the
investment you make when you develop a plat-
form. Several years ago, Whirlpool introduced
a refrigerator to markets in Asia, India, and
Africa. The customer needs in these places
were different from Whirlpool’s usual markets
and from each other. Whirlpool designed a
refrigerator platform around the product core
(the refrigeration unit, the insulation, and so on)
and tailored products for the different markets
by differentiating features like the size of the
freezer compartments.

 You’ve been making minor changes to improve a product line, but
recently the changes have been less minor. Every few months, it seems
like you have to fix something just to keep up with quality issues and com-
petitor pressures. You also may see that new technology opportunities
are hitting the market or that customer requirements are changing (see
Chapter 4). You need to sell that car and get a new one! Wait a minute,
that’s not what we meant to say! You need to launch a whole new plat-
form effort to bring your product lines up to snuff. There, that’s better.
Constructing Your Profit Model
Your product strategy has to include how your new products will make
money. Your newest new products — the ones you may call “radical” or
“breakthrough” — often have to make a profit in new, perhaps unusual ways.
These products also often ask customers to behave differently, and they may
require different channels of distribution. For example, with technologies like
the Internet or digital film, companies within the music industry, the photo-
graphy industry, the newspaper industry, and many others must figure out
how to use their ability to create value for customers in ways that create
profits for them.
But it isn’t only radical products and technology changes that require new
ways of making money. A shift in a profit model can make all the difference to
many kinds of product introductions. For example, think of what a difference
it made to the copier industry when companies decided to lease copiers to
customers and charge for supplies.

Chapter 3: Defining Your Product Strategy

Many organizations are overly committed to their existing business/profit
models. Their ways have been successful in the past, and the business lead-
ers can’t imagine any other way of making money. When companies remain
stuck on past models, they can overlook ways of making money; worse, they
can get locked into ways that used to work but don’t work anymore. In his
book Open Innovation (Harvard Business School Press), Henry Chesbrough
makes the point that serious innovations often demand innovative business
models. How and where your products make a return on your company’s
investments are crucial parts of your new product strategy. In this section,
you get the lowdown on some important profit model issues. What aspects of
your product are customers willing to pay for? And which part of your indus-
try can you earn profits from?
Deciding what your customers will pay for
Of course, as a business, you have to cover your costs and make a profit
when you develop new products (those shareholders are very demanding!).
This sets the lowest threshold for what your customers have to pay. But you
can charge your customers for the value they get from your products, and
fortunately the value your customers receive often is considerably more than
the costs you must cover. When you take advantage of that, you’re using a
technique called value pricing. (See Chapter 13 to read more about pricing
new products.)
Many companies have a pricing strategy that informs the way they design,
develop, and market their products. You can use the following list to deter-
mine how you’ll charge your customers for the value you give them.
New product pricing strategy isn’t the same as pricing tactics, which may
vary over the lifecycle of a product and respond to situational variations:
opportunities for discounting, seasonal demand, and so on.
 Single-product pricing: In single-product (or service) pricing, a com-
pany doesn’t expect additional sales or revenues that may accrue from
the sale of its product. With this pricing, you hope that your satisfied
customers will buy from you again and spread the word about how
much value you provide. However, your profit model doesn’t count
on these things happening. Most of the products consumers buy every
day are single-product priced: clothing, food, books, and so on.
 Product-plus pricing: This pricing strategy includes the expectation that
a customer’s initial purchase will generate further spending. This spend-
ing can include warrantees, extended service contracts, and ongoing
product/service repair (when you buy a car from a dealer that also 
provides service options, for example). The bigger the uptick from 
54
Part I: The Basics of New Product Development 

additional spending, and the more certain you are that these sales will
come your way, the further you can lower the cost of your product to
attract the initial purchase.
 Product plus-plus pricing (also known as “razor/razor blade”): You can
“sell” some products more as carriers of media than as products in their
own right. Polaroid, for example, sold cameras for close to cost in order
to maintain the flow of film media, on which it made enormous margins.
Gillette invented this pricing model with its cheap razors and expensive
razor blades. The list goes on. Printers, fax machines, and copiers — have
you noticed that companies practically give them away only to catch
you later when you go back to buy ink? Do you think that American car
manufacturers are in cahoots with the oil companies? Why, maybe they
sell those SUVs just so Exxon can sell more gas!
 Percent pricing: Companies price some products — usually services
and software — in relation to what they’ll save the customers. For exam-
ple, Johnson Controls manages air quality (heating, cooling, and so on)
for business-to-business customers. The customers don’t buy an actual
product from the company. Johnson Controls manages the customers’
air quality, saves them money, and makes a tidy profit based on their
savings. (This pricing model is similar to renting and leasing.)
 Renting and leasing: Another way to realize profits from a new product
is to lease or rent it to customers instead of selling it. When Xerox (way
back when it was known as Haloid) changed its profit model from selling
copiers to leasing them, its sales and profits took off. (You can read
more about this in the book Open Innovation by Henry Chesbrough
[Harvard Business School Press].)
Making yourself at home in 
your industry value chain
Few companies in today’s business market span the whole value chain from
raw materials to finished product. Even a neighborhood roadside stand that
sells organic vegetables during the summer probably gets material from a
supplier: mulch, seeds, or perhaps organic fertilizer. Even if the farmer pro-
duces everything herself, she’s almost certainly connected to electricity and
other energy sources and buys tools from the local hardware store.
Most companies have far more complex value chains. Some buy much of
what goes into the finished products that they sell to end-users. Others pro-
vide materials, parts, or services to other companies that produce products
for end-user markets (see Chapters 15 and 16 for more on supplier/partner
relationships).
55
Chapter 3: Defining Your Product Strategy

Understanding your organization’s place in the value chain is critical to
making good strategic decisions. Sometimes, that understanding can help
you capture more of the value in your value chain. Here’s how to get a good
view of the value chain and your place in it:
1. Make a map of your value chain. Draw a horizontal line, and put raw
materials at the left end and the customer (the end-user) at the right
end. Fill in the spaces. Who turns the raw materials into the pieces and
parts used by the product developer? Who actually builds the product?
Who distributes and sells it? (For a sample value chain map, take a look
at the motorcycle market example in Chapter 4.)
2. Locate your company in the value chain. Most companies fill one of
the spaces, but some companies play a role in several. For example, oil
companies explore for oil, pump it, refine it, and then sell it through
retail outlets.
3. Estimate the total value of the value chain and how much of that value
is gained in each of the spaces. Typically, the raw materials have much
less of the total value, and the final product has the most.
4. Look to see if you can capture more of the value in the value chain.
The most likely places are in the steps adjacent to your current place.
Although much of its R&D centered in raw materials and formulation,
Hercules Chemical, for example, discovered plenty of opportunities in
the next step of the value chain: manufacturing.
The companies in your value chain are your suppliers and your customers, so if
you change your role, you have to worry about disrupting your existing rela-
tionships. For example, when 3M decided to capture value further down the
value chain by installing the graphics it manufactures, the company had to take
care of its former customers — the companies that used to do the installation!
Fitting Your New Product Lines 
with Your Brand
Every new product you introduce has an impact on your organization’s
brand — what identifies, and what customers expect from, your company’s
products and services. If the product is consistent with your brand, it will
give your customers a comfortable feeling — that is, if they like your brand.
If it’s inconsistent with your brand, it may give your customers the impres-
sion that your organization is daring and forward-thinking, and they may like
you even more. Or, they may feel that you’re drifting away from their comfort
zone. In the sections that follow, you discover some of the ways in which
brand influences product strategy.
56
Part I: The Basics of New Product Development 

Every brand has an image — 
what’s yours?
How do your customers relate to your brand? In other words, how do they
view the products and product lines you’ve introduced in the past? Are you a
youth-oriented, counter-culture brand, like Apple? Do you appeal to the suc-
cessful professional, like BMW? Are you what co-author Beebe’s kids used to
call “earthy-crunchy,” like Trader Joe’s?
If you aren’t sure how consumers tag your brand, do some market research
to find out. Following the customer visit process we introduce in Chapter 4
will give you a chance to understand, at very basic levels, what you mean to
your customers.
Do your product concepts 
build your brand?
When you have a good sense of how your customers view your brand, you
can assess your new product offerings to make sure they’ll contribute to
your customers’ appreciation of and loyalty to your brand. If your brand just
shouts “quality and value,” for example, don’t succumb to the temptation of
introducing a low-quality product to make some fast profits. If your brand
says “cheap — I can afford it,” don’t bother with a fancy product that belongs
in a high-end store.
The fastest growing segment in the U.S. motorcycle market is women who
buy and ride their own motorcycles. This segment posed a challenge for
motorcycle giant Harley-Davidson. The company didn’t want to ignore the
market, but executives were having a hard time figuring out how to serve the
new market with the company’s tough-guy brand image. “Whaddya want us
to do? Paint ’em pink?” one Harley executive asked co-author Beebe when
she inquired about the segment.
In the end, Harley solved its problem and preserved its brand. In fact, the
problem turned out to be not such a big deal as the company discovered
more and more about the women who were buying and riding Harleys.
They didn’t want pink, and they didn’t want girly. They wanted what Harley
has to offer. As Beebe’s product development class concluded after interview-
ing many women riders, the Harley woman rider’s slogan is, “I am woman,
hear me roar!”
57
Chapter 3: Defining Your Product Strategy

Harley hit the nail on the head with a subsequent advertisement. In the ad, a
guy is bragging to a girl about a motorcycle parked on the street. He acts
macho and claims the bike is his, saying that he’s really into Harleys. A few
minutes into the conversation, just as the girl’s eyes start to widen with admi-
ration, another woman walks up, jumps on the bike, and rides away, leaving
the macho man embarrassed.
Can you connect your brand and 
your new product strategy?
Your brand opens some development doors and closes others. The following
list presents some advice on how to leverage your brand and how to know
when the time has come to modify it:
 Find out what your brand means to your customers. When you know
what effect your brand has on customers, you can direct your product
strategy to take advantage of that. During a customer visit process (see
Chapter 4), invite your customers to share what your brand means to
them. A brand means more than the sum of its parts. Brands include
myths and stories. Brands respond to our values and to how we want
to live. (For more fascinating stuff on how customers perceive brands,
look at Gerald Zaltman’s book How Customers Think [Harvard Business
School Press].)
 Assess the strength of your brand. Does your brand help sell products?
Or does your brand tend to turn customers off? If your brand is strong,
be sure your product strategy takes advantage of its strength. If it isn’t,
plan to devote some of your resources to brand improvement (check out
Branding For Dummies, by Bill Chiaravalle and Barbara Findlay Schenck
[Wiley]).
 Get clear about where your brand is leading you and what paths it’s
closing off. Direct your product strategy to build on a strong brand, but
don’t let your brand close doors. When Toyota wanted to come out with
a car that could compete with the Beamers, it didn’t call the car a Toyota.
The company created a brand-new brand called Lexus.

world and on their opinions about what’s good and
exciting. Putting customers first, and really understanding
them, gives companies a “higher power” that can shake
them loose of their stuck-in-the-mud ways. When “cus-
tomer intimacy” fuels a company, the organization won’t
have any trouble coming up with plenty of ideas for new
products. The problem becomes choosing the best ideas.
For that, a company needs discipline and focus.
The chapters in Part II take you into your customers’ wide
world and introduce proven ways of using the knowledge
of your customers to create great solutions for them. The
chapters in this part also help your company focus its
efforts, both in developing products and in developing or
acquiring the necessary technology. Finally, we show you
how to put everyone on the same page to work together
for NPD success.

You don’t have to be a dummy to fail at new product development. In fact,
around 50 percent of new products fail in the marketplace. And the
biggest reason for failure is that the products don’t fill the needs of customers.
In this chapter, we walk you through the customer visit process. This process
gets you right into your customers’ worlds — past, present, and future. We
begin with preparing for the visits, move on to how you’ll gather customer
information, and end with the all-important topic of how you can use the
information to jump-start and sustain your product development efforts.
Through the customer visit process, new product development teams
acquire a gut-level understanding of customers that enables them to come up
with great and often unexpected solutions to customers’ problems. It is this
understanding that can put distance between you and your competitors.
Dissecting the Customer Visit Process
The customer visit process is a qualitative market research program that
companies have used to develop thousands of products and services in every
industry imaginable — from blood analyzers to insurances policies; from soft-
ware products to custom homes; from air conditioners to semi-conductor

chips to chocolate-chip cookies. The following list presents the customer
visit process in a nutshell:
1. Focus the development team on an opportunity.
Select a good market or technology opportunity to research, assemble a
customer visit team, and choose and schedule your customer visits.
2. Prepare for the customer visits.
Before you set off to visit your customers, you need to take the time to
write a visit guide and practice your interview skills.
3. Execute the process.
Now it’s time for the teams to get in cars or on planes to go visit the 
customers. You should travel in teams of two and bring back loads of
information — notes, tape recordings, photos, videos, and memories!
4. Distill the results.
What do you do with all your notes, tapes, and photos? We’ll show you a
disciplined way to map the essential elements of your customers’ worlds
and to figure out their requirements.
5. Quantify the results.
Before you develop that great new product, check with a wider sample
of customers to make sure what you’ve identified are the factors your
customers consider the most important.
After your customer visit team completes these steps, you’ll be ready to gen-
erate ideas for products that address the customer needs you’ve identified
(see Chapter 5 for more on coming up with winning ideas).
Building the Foundation for the 
Customer Visit Program
You’re about to take a dip in the “ocean of opportunity” (see the Cheat Sheet
in the front of this book). The ocean of opportunity is vast; it includes every-
thing you might do to please your customers, all the technologies you could
use, and all the information you could gather about markets and competitors.
One of the most important things you can learn as you swim about in the
ocean is what your customers really want.
In this first step of the customer visit process, we walk you through how to
choose an opportunity, how to assemble a visit team, and how to select a
small group of customers to visit.
62
Part II: Charting the Ocean of Opportunities for New Products 

Identifying an opportunity
A customer visit program allows your company to explore NPD opportunities
and come up with plenty of ideas for new and different products or services.
Before launching a customer visit project, however, you need to identify a
valid and important opportunity on which to focus. The following list pre-
sents some different opportunities to look for, along with examples that show
how several different companies chose a focus for their projects:
 Technology opportunity: Successful customer visit programs are often
based on technology opportunities. Changes in technology can be large
(the digital revolution and nanotechnology, for instance) or small.
Can your new product pump gas faster? Can you reduce the amount of
packaging needed for your cookies? Can you increase the amount of
memory on a hard drive? Can your fertilizer work for every plant in
your customers’ gardens?
If you can do something new and different, you need to go out to cus-
tomers to see just how this ability may affect their lives. If cookies need
less packaging, how might that affect the cookie manufacturer? The distrib-
utor? The customer who wants to put cookies in his kids’ lunchboxes?
Be on the lookout for changes in your industry or your company that
may lead to changes in your customers’ behavior, needs, expectations,
and so forth. These kinds of changes can provide good focus for cus-
tomer visits. For example, say a small manufacturer of respiratory
devices is planning to acquire a new oxygen-delivery system. The com-
pany commissions a team to interview doctors and therapists and to
visit hospitals. Along the way, the team discovers that the company’s
new system could make a radical change in patient care.
 Market opportunity: Changes in the market also can provide direction for
a customer visit project. Try to identify new behaviors from customers
in your existing markets. Be on the lookout for trends that influence 
customers’ preference — for example, the impact of a diet fad on what
kinds of foods customers want, or the impact of heightened environmen-
tal awareness on customers’ buying choices.
Also take a look at potential new markets. Your company may be quite
comfortable selling its products to existing customers, but you may have
great market potential in areas you haven’t yet focused on. For example,
around the time of this writing, the motorcycle industry woke up to the
fact that more and more women were entering the market as buyers and
riders. That type of demographic change is fertile ground for a customer
visit program.
 Regulation change opportunity: Regulations — which can be local,
state, or federal government regulations; legal statutes; or industry
codes and agreements — have a huge impact on customer needs and
63
Chapter 4: What Do Your Customers Really Want?

provide interesting opportunities for new products or services. Be on
the lookout for regulatory changes that affect your industry, and figure
out a way to turn them to your organization’s advantage.
Many companies simply try to comply with regulations. However, the
smart ones take the time to discover how the regulations impact their
customers. For example, an educational publishing company might 
commission an NPD team to research how new federal regulations on
educational testing impact teachers’ needs and preferences in text-
books. The team might visit teachers, administrators, and students
around the country in order to help the company redesign its textbooks
so that teachers can do a better job of complying with the regulations.
Assembling your customer visit team
In order to get a project off the ground, you need to have a customer visit
team. The team should consist of 8 to 12 members from different business
functions. (We talk more about why you need functional diversity on your
teams in Chapter 10.) The team needs a sponsor and a team leader. If your
company has carried out customer visits before, it’s a good idea for the team
leader, and also several of the team members, to have experience working on
customer visit projects.
The team’s responsibility is to gather customer information and to shape it
so that the members or others can use it to generate new product ideas (see
Chapter 5), to develop new products, and to make improvements to existing
ones. (See Chapter 9 for more on how understanding customers helps focus
the product development process.)
First things first: Getting a sponsor and charter
Customer visit programs take time and money, and customer visit teams
require resources, which fall under the control of many different people: the
head of R&D, the head of marketing, the head of manufacturing, and so on.
Every customer visit project should have a sponsor who can negotiate with
the different department heads to acquire the needed resources. The spon-
sor might be a director, an executive, or the head of a business unit or func-
tional department.
Whoever the sponsor is, make sure she or he has enough political capital to
secure the resources you need.
At the beginning of the customer visit project, you should draw up a project
charter that acts as a contract between the visit team and management.
We emphasize this because customer visits are often “out of the ordinary”
64
Part II: Charting the Ocean of Opportunities for New Products 

projects. Unless members of management have signed on the dotted line,
they may think that it’s okay to cancel or under-resource the projects.
In addition, a project charter helps to spell out, for the team members,
exactly what they’re responsible for.
The project charter should include the following information:
 The number of customers the team plans to visit: Research and experi-
ence establish that between 10 and 20 customers is a good number.
If your team can visit customers in a place that offers opportunities for
several visits, by all means take advantage of that. You’ve made the trip,
so absorb as much information as you can.
 The opportunity the team is exploring: For example, the opportunity
may be to discover what draws women to motorcycle riding so that a
motorcycle company can design products for them.
 The planned project outcomes and time frame: A project should take
between three and six months, depending on the amount of travel
involved, the number of team members available, and the number of
customers the team plans to visit.
Formal chartering assures that a customer visit team will have adequate sup-
port and resources, clear goals, and defined deliverables.
Deciding who should make up the team
A customer visit team should have 8 to 12 members who come from different
business functions. The team sponsor and the team leader should select
team members with an eye to experience and diversity; however, the final
say about who will make up the team is usually up to the functional heads.
It’s important to include people with different experiences and perspectives.
For example, a marketing member and a manufacturing member will each
come away from a customer visit with very different experiences and obser-
vations, and they’ll interpret the information the team gathers differently.
Different perspectives are essential to creating a 360-degree view of the 
customer’s world.
A customer visit team should have a strong team leader who can help the
team align on the goals and the tasks and make sure that the project sponsor
stays informed and on board with the program. Ideally, the team leader has
led or participated in such a program before. If not, choose someone with
experience in leading teams and projects — someone who, if possible, has
led projects that may go in unpredictable directions. The sponsor, working
with the business and functional leaders, should make the decision about
who will lead the team.

Chapter 4: What Do Your Customers Really Want?

Creating and choosing from a customer pool
You can’t visit all your customers for a customer visit project, and you cer-
tainly don’t need to. In the following sections, we help you create a list of the
customers you may want to visit and construct a matrix to narrow down your
choices.
You may meet with and interview several customers on a single visit. For exam-
ple, on a visit to a hospital, you could meet with a doctor, a nurse, a therapist,
a patient, and a purchasing agent. That’s five interviews, which could count
as one-third of your whole program. You don’t want to limit your customer
sample to just three hospitals, however. A good compromise may be to visit
five hospitals, for a total of 25 interviews.
Tagging the most desirable customers
The following steps show you how to identify the many different customers
who may be relevant to your opportunity (the section after this one shows
you how to narrow the field to a manageable number):
1. Brainstorm a list of the people and organizations that together would
provide the product, service, or solution that the end-user would buy.
For example, if your company produces motorcycles, your list should
include the manufacturer, the dealer or distributor, and the places that
service motorcycles. You can include organizations and businesses that
make cycling attractive to consumers, like owners groups and apparel
shops. You also can list infrastructures that support or get in the way of
people who ride: highways, traffic laws, insurance agencies, and so on.
One graduate student group explored the market opportunity of women
who ride motorcycles. In Figure 4-1, you can see a value chain diagram
that shows how the students represented their list; the bubbles show
some of the other stakeholders the students included.
Using a value-chain diagram for your list of stakeholders can help your
team remember all the parties you want to include.

66
Part II: Charting the Ocean of Opportunities for New Products 

2. List any other segments of the customer population that you may con-
sider important.
Include the typical demographics that marketers use: age, gender, geogra-
phy, socioeconomic grouping, and so on. In the motorcycle example, the
students focused on women, but they divided the population by age, from
the 20s to the 60s. If you’re focused on a business-to-business opportunity,
where the customer is another business, the demographics could include
large and small businesses, urban/rural/suburban businesses, and so on.
We recommend that you list these segments or demographics on sticky
notes so that the team can move them around when you’re selecting the
most important segments.
Now your team has two lists: stakeholders (or the value chain) and customer
segments. In order to keep your whole team focused, write up these lists on big
flip chart pages, and tape the pages to a conference room wall. If the team has
written segments on sticky notes, paste the notes to the wall chart. (We find
that putting the lists into digital format too quickly tends to limit discussions.)
Creating a customer visit matrix to focus your efforts
But wait! Your team now has lists that highlight everyone you can think of
who may relate to your development opportunity, and we say earlier you
should visit 10 to 20 customers. Exactly right. Your team must now decide
where to focus its efforts. This can be kind of like making sausage: a messy
process. One expert calls it “part art, part science.”
Setting up the matrix
You start by making a customer visit matrix by drawing rows and columns on
a large sheet of paper. The headings for the columns should list the stake-
holders you’ve brainstormed, and the headings for the rows should list the
important customer segments you’ve identified.
Where the rows and the columns cross is where you find the intersection of the
stakeholders and the segments. Within the matrix, the team will identify some
intersections as more important than others. For example, the opportunity
you’re researching may be more relevant for older customers who live in cities
(imagine a new product for coloring gray hair) or for large hospitals located in
urban areas (imagine big, expensive medical testing equipment). Your team
should highlight the intersections in the matrix that you identify as the most
important for your project — the groups you’ll select customers from to visit.
You should do your best to keep the customer visit matrix simple — in other
words, limit it to two or three dimensions. Human beings can’t think in four or
five dimensions very well! However, your team may want to include other cus-
tomers that aren’t part of the two-dimensional matrix. We suggest that you list
groups of customers whose needs may be different from the needs of the cus-
tomers and segments you’ve selected. Teaching hospitals, for example, have
different needs than other hospitals. As you select your customers to visit,
67
Chapter 4: What Do Your Customers Really Want?

you can make sure you’ve included some of these different groups, but make
them your second or third priority.
Selecting your customers
Each box you highlight on the matrix includes many customers — possibly
even hundreds. For example, your team could locate hundreds of motorcycle
dealers, repair shops, and owners groups. You also could contact thousands
of riders. With the matrix, you’ve decided which categories are most impor-
tant to your project; now you have to identify one or several customers in
each box that you’ll actually visit. The following list presents a way to go
about selecting who you’ll visit from your many options:
1. Decide which geographic areas you want to visit. If your list includes
different parts of the United States, for example, each visit team can
choose one location for all its visits. This saves on travel costs and wear
and tear on your team.
2. Within each geographic area, identify which kinds of customers each
team will visit. In the motorcycle example, each team could visit riders,
dealers, owners’ groups, and so on in each designated area. In order to
spread the visits among the customer segments, the team that goes to
Indianapolis, for example, may decide to visit customers in their 20s,
and the team that goes to Massachusetts may visit customers in their 40s.
3. Identify customers in each area who represent the segments each
team will visit. Cold-calling, searching the Internet, and perusing phone
books can help you identify customers and schedule visits (see the fol-
lowing section). Your sales and marketing folks can also help.
Here’s where a list of other “dimensions” can come in handy. If the
Massachusetts team sets up a visit with a 40-year-old woman who uses her
motorcycle for transportation, the team that goes to Indianapolis could visit
a 20-year-old woman who rides as part of a couple or group.
If your customers are business customers, you probably won’t have as many
customers to choose from, and someone on your team may personally know
customers the team should visit. When visiting business customers, be sure
to set up visits with different functions within the businesses. Customer
needs differ widely depending on whether an employee uses the product,
pays for it, or oversees the function in which it’s used.
If your team can’t pinpoint appropriate customers from the multitude of
options, you should call in resources from sales, market research, or other
functions that may be willing and able to help.
See Figure 4-2 for an example of a completed matrix for a customer visit pro-
ject. You can adapt this matrix to your own project and write the actual cus-
tomer names in the boxes.
68
Part II: Charting the Ocean of Opportunities for New Products 

Your lists and matrix show your team exactly what you did when targeting
customers — and, just as important, exactly what you didn’t do. You won’t
make the mistake of thinking that the information you collected for customers
in North America automatically applies to customers in Japan, or that what
you learned about small rural hospitals applies to large urban hospitals. And
later on, if you want to find out more about other segments, you’ll be able to
focus your efforts and streamline your process.
Scheduling the customer visits
As soon as you decide which customers to visit (see the previous section),
you should start scheduling the visits. We recommend that you visit cus-
tomers in pairs (you can read more about the roles team members play in the
section “Setting up a practice interview”). Your team members may know
some customers or know someone who does, which makes contacting them
much easier. If you don’t have many connections, consider doing some 
cold-calling — calling current customers and potential customers you find
on the Internet or in the phone book — to set up some of the visits.
No matter which contact method you use, we recommend that you schedule
the visits as early in the project as you can. Your project can stall if a cus-
tomer you want to visit is unexpectedly unavailable. If you schedule early,
you can make alternate plans.

Chapter 4: What Do Your Customers Really Want?

The following list presents some tips to keep in mind when you begin sched-
uling customer visits:
 Schedule a 1.5 to 2.0 hour interview with each customer. It can be
interesting to meet with several customers, perhaps over lunch, in 
addition to your “two-on-one” interview. Ordinarily, however, you get
the best information from a single customer reflecting on his or her
experiences.
 Don’t schedule more than two visits in one day. If a team is traveling,
you want to take advantage of their time on the road and pack in a
couple visits. But don’t overload them. The visit team should be able to
conduct one or more interviews, observe the work that people at the
organization do, perhaps visit with one or two other people in the orga-
nization, and still have time to debrief together afterward. If the visit is
local, and travel time isn’t an issue, one visit in a day is quite enough.
(See the following sections of this chapter for more on the interview and
review processes.)
 Don’t underestimate the difficulty of getting visits scheduled. In our
experience, customers usually are glad to talk with you if you can clearly
explain the purpose of the visits. However, you have to reach them at
good times, the customers have to find time on their calendars, and the
proposed times have to fit the times your team has available.
 After you schedule a visit, send a letter thanking the customer and
briefly explaining the purpose of the upcoming visit. If you asked for
a tour or other opportunity to observe the customer’s site during your
visit, confirm this. Also, you should offer an honorarium for an end-user
customer or a token gift for a business customer to express your appre-
ciation. If one of your products makes a nice gift, use that.
When scheduling your visits, make sure you include your company’s current
customers as well as customers your company may have lost. You can learn
plenty by talking with someone who decided not to use your products anymore!
Also include people or businesses who are your competitors’ customers.
Who knows, maybe what you discover will entice them to become your 
customers in the future.
Dipping Your Toes into 
the Visiting Process
Before your teams of two actually go out to visit your customers, you need to do
some preparatory work. You don’t go into a job interview without a résumé and
some prepared answers, do you? For starters, your team should prepare a visit
guide. When you have the guide drafted, you can start practice interviewing. For
70
Part II: Charting the Ocean of Opportunities for New Products 

most people, really listening and asking good questions are new skills. You also
practice collecting information. With all this prep work under your teams’ belts,
you can unleash them into the world of interviewing — allowing a bit of time to
make necessary adjustments along the way.
The following sections address these topics and start you down the road to
successful customer interviews.
Preparing a visit guide
A visit guide includes a list of themes and topics that each visit pair should
cover with each customer. Although each customer visit has a flavor and a
character all its own, you want your teams to cover the important points
with every customer. A visit guide ensures that this happens.
Your team should follow these steps to create a useful visit guide:
1. Brainstorm a list of all the information you want to gather during the
customer visit.
Maybe you want to know what your customers’ typical work processes
are, what frustrations they encounter, and how they ideally like to get
their work done. If you’re researching a consumer product, you may
want to know about typical situations customers encounter when they
use the product and what their frustrations are.
You should write the items you come up with on sticky notes so you can
post them on big wall charts.
A real treasure that comes from customer visits is discovering “what you
didn’t know you didn’t know.” During this process, you may come up
with a whole new set of questions that allow you to understand your
customers better. Be open to the unexpected, and be willing to alter
your visit guide to include research into new insights.
2. Group the items into categories, and give each category a title.
If the team members have written their learning objectives on sticky
notes, they can paste the notes on a large wall chart and begin to sort
them into categories. Each category will be a theme in your visit guide.
Categories might include different situations in which customers could
use the product — for example, at children’s parties, Super Bowl parties,
and so on. Categories also can include the customer’s work processes
that may involve your product: drilling, refining, processing, shipping,
and so on.
3. Choose the most important categories.
You don’t want to have more than six or eight categories. Usually, when
each team member puts check marks on the categories she feels are
important, using a simple voting method, you end up with the right
71
Chapter 4: What Do Your Customers Really Want?

number. If you still have too many, we recommend that you discuss the
project focus with the team, because maybe your focus is too large. In
that case, now’s the time to narrow the focus.
If the customer visit team changes the focus, that change will influence
the project charter. Be sure that the people who are providing the
resources for the project are on board with the changes. Don’t force
functional leaders to cancel the project because you don’t meet their pet
objective (see the earlier section “First things first: Getting a sponsor
and charter”).
4. Use the items in each selected category to develop probe questions.
Within each theme (category), the team needs to develop probe ques-
tions that will encourage the customers to elaborate. For example, if the
theme is taking pictures at children’s parties, probe questions could
include the following:
• “Could you describe a time when taking pictures went really well?”
• “What was it about that time that made you really happy?”
• “What else can you imagine that you’d like to be able to do when
taking pictures at children’s parties?”
Consider the motorcycle team example introduced in earlier sections.
The team thought of a number of probe questions that would help its
customers discuss their experiences. Some of the questions the mem-
bers asked included the following:
• “Do you go on trips with others?”
• “Could you describe a recent trip? Where did you go? What did
you do?”
• “Describe any clubs or groups you ride with. (If they don’t ride
with groups, ask, “Do you wish you did? Why?”)
5. Put the important categories (themes) and the probe questions into a
logical flow on a visit guide (see Figure 4-3).
Putting the categories in a logical flow helps the interviewers and the
customer to feel more comfortable with the interview’s progress.
The categories could go in order of time — for example, “How patients
contact their doctors” followed by “Visiting the doctor.” They could go
in order of importance — for example, “Visiting the doctor for routine
check-ups” followed by “Visiting the doctor for serious illnesses.”
Another “logical” order for an interview is when you can start by asking a cus-
tomer to describe a typical day, a typical process, or a typical event. You can
discover plenty by listening to what really happens in your customer’s world.
Next, you may want to ask about the really great and really bad experiences
the customer has had. You also can ask what would improve the customer’s
life and work. Customers often have great suggestions, and even if they don’t,
you can find out what’s bothering them and what they want changed.
72
Part II: Charting the Ocean of Opportunities for New Products 

Conducting practice interviews
An interview with a customer isn’t just an ordinary conversation. In fact, it
may be quite unlike any conversation you’ve had before. The visit team has a
complex task to perform. The pair has to
 Make the customer feel comfortable and encourage her to talk frankly
about her work, her life, her experiences, and so on.
 Follow the outline of the visit guide (see the previous section) so that
they cover the points your team has agreed on.
 Listen for what’s important to the project in what the customer says,
and ask questions or give responses that encourage her to say more
about the important things.
 Document the interview by using a tape recorder, hand-written notes,
and perhaps photographs.
Learning to juggle this many balls takes practice. In this section, we provide
guidelines you can use to practice before your teams go out into the field.

Chapter 4: What Do Your Customers Really Want?

Setting up a practice interview
For the practice sessions, we recommend that you divide your team into
groups of three. In each practice group, you have the following members:
 A lead interviewer: This member of the practice team is responsible for
initiating the different themes or topics of the interview and for doing
most of the follow-up or “probe” questioning.
 A notetaker/observer: This member is primarily responsible for collect-
ing information. The notetaker may get the chance to ask an insightful
probe question or to steer the interview in an interesting direction, but
he or she should never cause the customer to wonder if there’s any con-
flict over who’s running the show. When in doubt, the notetaker should
keep his or her mouth firmly shut. (See the upcoming section “Practicing
your information collection” for more advice on notetaking.)
 The customer: This member should “introduce” him- or herself as
the customer — “I’m a respiratory therapist in a large urban teaching
hospital,” for example.
Make the roles in the interview very clear before you start. Set a time — five
minutes works well — for the “interview.” Advise your team members to 
pretend that the session is real, to listen, and to be fascinated by what the
customer is saying. Chances are your team members will choose customer
roles that they’re somewhat familiar with, so everyone can learn something.
Three rounds of interview practice gives everyone on the team a chance to
play all three roles and a much better sense of how the interview process
works. Start each round of interviews in a different place in the visit guide to
give the team a sense of how a longer interview would flow.
Interviewing the “customer”
Your lead interviewer can start the practice interview with an overarching
question. For example, the lead interviewer might ask, “Could you describe
a typical day in your job? Maybe start with what happens when you first
arrive . . .” Now comes the tricky part: The interviewers have to listen. Their
body language should signal that they’re interested — leaning a bit forward,
nodding, and not looking around the room or at their notes. The lead inter-
viewer can use verbal cues, such as “hmmm” and “ahhh.” Remind your inter-
viewers to ask questions or say things that show their interest: “Tell me
more!” “How exactly did you do that?” And so on.
A good interviewer recognizes the moment for a “probe.” He or she knows
when to ask, “Can you tell me more about that?” Or, “Can you describe a
time when that happened?” Another kind of probe is a simple reflection
back to the customer of what the interviewer is discovering. The interviewer
74
Part II: Charting the Ocean of Opportunities for New Products 

might say, for example, “So, I take it that this step is very important to you.”
An interviewer wants to lead his or her customer from generalities and
abstractions to specifics and from solutions to needs (“If you had that, what
would it do for you?”). The practice interview is a great place to practice pro-
viding an atmosphere in which a customer can talk, reflect, and explain how
things are from his or her point of view.
The group of three should spend about five minutes conducting the practice
interview, with each group member playing his or her role.
Debriefing the interview
After the practice interview, the three-person practice team should take
another five minutes to debrief the interview:
1. Assess the lead interviewer’s performance.
Did the customer feel comfortable, and was she able to talk? Were the
questions open-ended? What improvements can the lead interviewer
make?
2. Debrief the visit guide.
Was the guide helpful? Were the probe questions open-ended? How
could you change them? The team won’t have time to get through the
whole guide, but they can learn enough about how it works to know
whether it needs to be revised.
3. Debrief the notetaker role and assess what the interview pair learned.
How well did the notetaker record the customer’s words? Did the notetaker
record images? What other images or insights can the team reconstruct?
To help your pairs draw out the customer’s unspoken needs, you should
ask your visit teams to focus on images. The images your teams bring
back help them share their understanding of customers with others.
Images also spur the whole team to think creatively about solutions to
your customers’ problems. Right after an interview is a good time to
look back over the notes and record images that you may forget after a
day or two. (See the section “Organizing the image information” later in
this chapter.)
Sharing insights with the whole team
When all the three-person teams have completed their practice interviews,
the team leader should call the whole group together so the teams can talk
about what they’ve learned. Hearing the strong and weak points of other
interviewers can help everyone improve. During these sharing sessions, the
team builds a common understanding of what makes for a successful interview.
Be sure to share critiques and strong points you’ve identified with respect to
the visit guide. A team member should take the responsibility of revising the
75
Chapter 4: What Do Your Customers Really Want?

guide if necessary and making sure the whole team gets to review the revisions.
Write the insights and ideas shared at the meeting on a flip chart to help the
participants focus during the meeting. You can type up the list afterwards so
team members can refer to the learning later in the process.
Practicing your information collection
The notetaker of the visit pair has the job of collecting information during the
customer visit. When you first hear about “notetaking,” you may think of being
back in school and trying to transcribe an entire lecture in a notebook. Taking
interview notes that way is unbelievably frustrating, and it makes your hand
hurt.
However, the actual, verbatim words of the customer are invaluable sources
of insight for the team. We human beings tend to listen in generalities. We
hear “I liked using that device” rather than “When I used that device, I was
able to provide much better patient care.” When the interviewer follows the
latter statement with a probe question and discovers that “When my hands
are free, I’m able to adjust dials much more accurately,” the team has infor-
mation to begin to design a product around.
Therefore, we recommend that your notetaker bring a good tape recorder to
the interview. One of the important resources a customer visit team can have
is a skilled typist who can transcribe interview tapes verbatim and include
them in the team’s store of information.
Some teams videotape their visits. For example, a Kodak team videotaped
customers dealing with hard-copy photos to help the team design solutions
for digital photo archiving. The videotapes provided both images and inter-
view text. Videotaping presents a challenge because the team gets so much
information, but it provides team members and others in the company with
what amounts to a real re-creation of the visit.
Even if the notetaker has a tape recorder, though, we recommend that he or
she take some verbatim notes during the interview. Here’s why:
 The tape recorder may malfunction. You want to have as full a record
as possible after your team travels many miles to visit a customer.
 People tend to listen in generalities. Taking notes verbatim actually
gets the notetaker in the habit of listening to what others are saying
rather than filtering words through his or her own ideas and opinions.
76
Part II: Charting the Ocean of Opportunities for New Products 

So, how does the notetaker take verbatim notes? Glad you asked. Here are
some tips:
 Have a large pad with plenty of paper, your favorite pen, and a spare.
 Even though you can’t write down everything the customer says, be sure
to write down what the customer says.
 If you get behind, don’t paraphrase; draw a line and start again. You’ll
eventually get the hang of leaving out the “um’s,” the “ah’s,” and the
“well, I think it was’s.” When you sit down to review the notes after the
visit with your visit partner, you can fill in many of the gaps.
If you bring a tape- or videorecorder to a visit, be sure to ask the customer’s
permission to record the interview. Your team needs to build relationships
with the customers, and if you come across as sneaky, you risk these relation-
ships! Leave the recorder in plain sight; most customers forget all about it
after a few seconds.
In all transcripts and notes, identify the customers and the companies with
coded letters and numbers. Using a code — Company A, Interview 1, and so
on — helps protect customers’ confidentiality when the team shares informa-
tion (with the executives, for instance).
Baby steps: The first visit
The first time team members actually go out to visit customers is a big step.
They’re going from inside the safety of the company to outside into the big
wide world. Although the marketing members of the team may be perfectly
comfortable visiting customers, engineers and manufacturers usually find the
whole idea rather strange.
This section introduces two ways of conducting the first visit. The first is fine
for most visit teams; we introduce the second in case any of your teams need
some extra help.
Going on your first visit
The first visit for each two-person team should serve as a smooth transition
from the practice interviews. The first real visit should be
 Local, to save on travel costs.
 With a “friendly customer” who knows the company.
 With a customer your team can easily contact in case the interviewers
miss something or have further questions.
77
Chapter 4: What Do Your Customers Really Want?

Nothing is really different about this visit compared to subsequent visits,
except that it’s the first one. The first time is always the hardest! During the
first visit, your team will
 Confirm the visit details.
 Briefly explain the purpose of the visit.
 Have a tape recorder and ask permission to use it (see the previous 
section).
 Conduct the interview, following the themes and probes on the visit
guide (see the section “Preparing a visit guide”).
A customer may wander all over the place and make it hard for the inter-
viewer to follow the visit guide. Here’s how your interviewers can deal
with that: They shouldn’t feel that they have to follow the themes in any
particular order, but they should listen for how they can bring the cus-
tomer back to the themes of the visit guide. With practice, the guide will
become a background for a normal conversation that “just happens” to
cover all the points (because of the interviewer’s skill and familiarity
with the guide).
 Thank the customer and confirm that they can call later if needed to
clarify points.
Customers typically want to know how your NPD team will use the information
you gather during the visits. Always reassure them that you won’t connect
anything they say to their names or their companies and that only people
inside your company who develop products will have access to the informa-
tion (and then make sure this is true!).
After the first visit, your visit team will
 Debrief the visit with each other.
They can add things they noticed and talk about any confusions. Try to
hold the debrief meeting the same day as the visit — maybe over dinner
at the end of the day.
 Write down any images you identified during the visit.
Include what you observed in the customer’s environment and what the
customer said.
 Have the interview transcribed.
 Send the customer a follow-up thank you letter, along with any fees or
gifts you promised.
Holding interview practice for real beginners
If customer visit team members are very inexperienced or are unnerved by
the thought of conducting visits, you may want to include special practice
78
Part II: Charting the Ocean of Opportunities for New Products 

sessions — sessions that are just like “real” interviews but with much
lower stakes. Co-author Beebe Nelson once used this approach with a very
nervous scientist who couldn’t imagine visiting customers unless he was the
expert. By the end of the project, he was thinking of going into the customer
visit business himself!
Here are a few suggestions for setting up a low-stakes practice interview:
 If you have a team member who has experience in the market segment
that you’re researching, ask him or her to be the “customer” for a full
hour interview. Follow the whole process (see the previous section),
including taping the interview.
 Find an employee in your company who may be an “internal customer”
for the opportunity you’re exploring — a researcher or a salesperson, or
someone in purchasing or manufacturing, for example. Again, follow the
whole interview process. Make it as real as you can.
 Set up a practice interview with a customer in your area whom you know
well. Explain that you want your team to gain some experience. Ask if
the team can come back another time if they need to clarify some points.
 Interview a friend or colleague who has experience in the area the team
is researching.
Working out the kinks: 
The mid-course debrief
After all your team’s visit pairs complete and transcribe their first real visits,
your whole team should gather to work out the kinks. This meeting, called a
mid-course debrief, gives your team a chance to approve what’s working and
fix what isn’t.
Don’t forget your charter! We recommend posting it on a wall in the meeting
room so that the team can refer to it when they have questions about the
scope or purpose of the project (see the earlier section “First things first:
Getting a sponsor and charter”).
One of the most important questions to ask is, “Are we getting images of
our customers’ environments?” (See the section “Organizing the image
information” later in this chapter for more on images.) So, start the meeting
by having a facilitator or a team member ask the team members to report
images from the visits. You can write the images on the wall charts.
Next, ask team members what they’ve learned about interviewing and con-
ducting visits, including the problems they had. Write headlines on the wall
charts, and give the team members time to describe their issues. The team
discussion of these points usually clarifies any problems.
79
Chapter 4: What Do Your Customers Really Want?

Use the last part of the meeting to discuss any logistical issues — problems
with the interview guide, scheduling issues, problems with transcription,
and so on. Take the time to solve these issues or make plans to solve them.
Be sure that the team leader or facilitator gets back to the team later to let
them know how any issues have been resolved.
By sharing this information, the whole team can learn from one another. You
can read all the books you want, or listen to all the experts, but personal
experiences and the shared experiences of colleagues make all the difference.
The Final Push
You’ve prepped and practiced. You’ve worked out any kinks with your
recording and transcription process. Your team is seeing and hearing images
everywhere. You’ve scheduled all the remaining interviews. You’re ready to
execute your full customer visit program.
Tackling the rest of the visits
A program of customer visits can take way too long if you don’t complete the
visits promptly. The whole project, including preparation time, usually runs
from three to six months. If it goes much longer, the team and your execu-
tives may begin to lose energy and enthusiasm. Therefore, it’s critical that
your team keeps to the proposed schedule. If, as can happen, a customer
postpones or cancels a visit, you should reschedule or replace the visit with
another customer as soon as you can.
Be prepared to take advantage of unexpected opportunities during your cus-
tomer visits. A customer may ask, “Want to see where we do the assembly?”
Or, “One of our customers is here on-site; would you like to meet with her?”
As long as you allocate 11⁄2 to 2 hours for an interview with the customer, you
should take advantage of any chance opportunities that will give you more
insight into the environment the customer works or lives in. Unexpected
opportunities are often great ways to collect real live images. One of our
favorites is from a tool company visitor who saw “one of our tools lying
rusting on the shop room floor.”
Assembling the visit data
The program of customer visits is a knowledge-building project. The informa-
tion the team gathers is important for the team and the company. It often con-
tributes to other teams and projects long after the current project is complete.
80
Part II: Charting the Ocean of Opportunities for New Products 

Your team needs to put all the information you gather into a format that you
can store easily, that your team members can access without issue, and that
can provide a permanent and accessible record for other teams (these days,
that pretty much shouts out “Internet!”).
The following list inventories the pieces of information you should update
after the visits are complete:
 The customer selection matrix, which records the customers and seg-
ments the team planned to visit and those they didn’t (see the section
“Creating a customer visit matrix to focus your efforts”)
 A list of the customers that the team actually visited, including their
contact information
 The visit guide, which provides an overview of the learning objectives
of the project (see the section “Preparing a visit guide”)
 The transcript of the interviews, plus interviewers’ notes, which will
include the images they logged right after the visit (see the section
“Practicing your information collection”)
 Photos or videotapes the team shot
 Images of the customer environment, including the final map of the
images the team found most important (see the upcoming section
“Organizing the image information”)
 Customer requirements the team generated (see the section “Writing
product requirements: What does your customer want?”)
Staying in touch with customers
During your team’s customer visits, you form important relationships with
the customers who give you valuable information you can use to develop
successful new products. They’re useful to you in many ways during the
visits; what you may not know is how useful they can be in the future. You
have several reasons why your team members may want to contact these
customers in the future:
 You may have questions about something you heard or failed to ask
during the visit. At the end of the visit, a member of the team should
ask the customer if you can call, e-mail, or write if you have additional
questions.
 You may want customers to participate with you in future idea-generation
sessions (see Chapter 5) or in another aspect of product development.
 Some customers could make perfect candidates for product or proto-
type testing later in the development process (see Chapter 17).
 Customers might participate in advertising or promotional campaigns.
81
Chapter 4: What Do Your Customers Really Want?

The first thing you should do to maintain your relationships for the long term
is to send thank-you’s! Draft a letter that your team can use. Each pair of
interviewers should personalize the letter with a few of their visit details. Be
sure your teams send their letters within a few days of their visits.
Distilling the Results: Images
and Requirements
Visiting customers to gather product information is like drinking from a fire
hose. No, really! Each visit may produce 20 or more pages of transcribed
notes and observations, complete with photos, insights, and images. What’s
your team supposed to do with all this information?
Lucky for you, in the sections that follow, we show you how to organize the
information and shape it into a form that your team can use and share. We
concentrate on two kinds of information: images of the customers’ environ-
ments and what your customers want or need — the “customer requirements.”
Organizing the image information
What to do with all the gathered images from the customer visits? In a list, all
by themselves, they don’t make much sense. At best, they’re contradictory —
they show the confusion and richness of the real world.
The following sections explain how your team can assemble the images and
then shape them so that the team members, and others, can use the images
to deepen their understanding of customers.
Writing and assembling the images
The first step in organizing and shaping visit information is to generate a
simple list of the images. By listing the images, you give the team members
and others access to a rich repository of customer information. The best
time for the visit team to identify and select images is right after each visit.
When the visits are complete and you have a pool of information (see the sec-
tion “Assembling the visit data”), your whole team should meet to compile a
complete image list and to select some of the most powerful images. These
selected images — which members can write on sticky notes — will help the
team to identify customer needs.
82
Part II: Charting the Ocean of Opportunities for New Products 

The following list presents some examples of images from customer visits:
“A doctor climbing on a filing cabinet to get a picture.” Quote from a
camera manufacturer on a visit to a doctor’s office to find out how dental
surgeons document operations.
“I make a complete mess pipetting solution into the receptacles.” Quote
from a customer of a manufacturer of blood analyzers.
“I’m spending too much time learning new applications — I’m frustrated!”
Quote from a customer of a software manufacturer.
At the simplest level, these images are pictures. When you read or hear about
an image, you can picture the situation. The image often involves action —
“climbing on the filing cabinet,” for example. Notice that in some of the images
in the previous list, emotion is clearly involved — “I’m frustrated.” In others,
the images imply emotion — “I make a complete mess.” You can think of an
image as the scene a video camera would capture — a little slice of the cus-
tomer’s life.
A customer’s words (verbatim quotes) can make good images. Just be sure
that the emotional overtones are there before you label the situation as an
image. Sometimes, for example, the emotion is clear but unspoken — “I make
a complete mess when . . .” Go ahead and throw in the label in these cases.
The visit team members should select images that they feel are important in
your customers’ environments. As much as possible, select images that cover
what was learned during the visits. For example, the doctor’s office image in
the previous list showed the team many things, including how badly the
doctor wanted to get the picture, and how poor the available process was.
Some interviews will be overflowing with compelling images. Some will be
less vivid. The team should include the compelling images, of course, but
also include some images that represent the depth and breadth of what they
learned about the customer environments — even if some of the images are
weaker or less interesting.
Grouping and mapping the images
After the visit team has identified the important images from the customer
visits and written them on sticky notes, the next step is to group the images
so that team members can begin to see some patterns.
Call a team meeting and follow these steps to bring some order to your images:
1. Sort and group the images.
You can follow this process:
a. Post the sticky notes on a blank wall, on wall charts, or on dry-
erase boards. Make sure the sticky sides of the notes are on top!
83
Chapter 4: What Do Your Customers Really Want?

b. Weed out duplications. We prefer to put duplications in a stack
instead of tossing them out so that we don’t lose wording that may
come in handy later.
c. Group the images. At this point, it’s okay to group them logically.
These three steps get the team members familiar with all the images and
allow them to sort the images into manageable categories.
2. Reduce the number of images.
Each team member puts a check on all the images she or he wants to
include in the final count. When that round is done, eliminate all the
images with no checks, and repeat the process. Take off all the images
with one check, and do a third round. Your goal is to identify 25 to 30
images. Keep the earlier round losers in your team documentation.
3. Start grouping the selected 25 to 30 images.
“WAIT! Not that way!” Most people will want to group the images by
obvious properties or characteristics — which ones talk about paint and
which ones talk about wallpaper, or which ones happened to old patients
and which to younger ones, for instance. That’s how our little logical
minds usually work.
Try this instead: Try having group members work silently, looking to
gather the images on the sticky notes into groups that represent some
other image — an image at a higher level of abstraction, perhaps. For
example, a team that visited hospitals grouped these three images:
• Therapist having to explain to a patient’s family member that a
needed supply is in backorder
• Therapist fumbling to find the right connection
• Therapist custom designing an oxygen-delivery system for each
patient
The team came up with this higher level abstraction: “We never have
exactly what we need.”
The grouping process shouldn’t take too long. If you’re still grouping
after half an hour, call a halt to the exercise. Have a brief discussion
about what you’re doing and what’s not working. Then have the team
come to a workable consensus on the groups. It helps to say “Be sure
the grouping is 60 percent okay with you.”
4. Label each group — with images that give the flavors of the images in
each group, if possible.
The team that visited the hospitals imagined something a therapist might
say that depicted frustration and covered all the lower-level images.
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4, if necessary, until you have five to seven groups.
You group the initial groups and give them titles, and then you group
again and give the second-level groups titles, and so on. For example,
84
Part II: Charting the Ocean of Opportunities for New Products 

when the hospital visit team did a second-level grouping, they put the
title “We never have exactly what we need” together with “Changing to
products that work differently is annoying” and then labeled both with
“Listen to us before you come up with solutions.”
6. Paste all the groups formed by sticky notes on flip chart pages to form
a map, and decorate your map with real images.
You can use pictures, drawings, or whatever helps you to convey your
customer’s environment.
Writing product requirements: What
does your customer want?
Now that your customer visit teams have completed the visits, gathered
information, and mapped the images, your team is ready to identify clear
customer requirements. Things your customers desire in a product. Things
that make the difference in your customers’ buying decisions. Things you
want to concentrate on providing.
85
Chapter 4: What Do Your Customers Really Want?
The taming of the screw
Most product development teams are inter-
ested in product requirements. They tend to
think that what customers want and what team
members think would make a better product are
one and the same. But not so fast!
Co-author Beebe Nelson once worked with a
manufacturer of tools and equipment for the
automotive and aerospace industries. The firm
wanted to improve its handtool line. Everyone the
firm’s development people talked to — from sales
people to the tooling engineer at one of the com-
pany’s largest clients — told them that the com-
pany’s mechanized screwdriver needed more
torque. The manufacturer ordinarily would’ve fol-
lowed this advice and increased the speed at
which its screwdriver could set a screw — from,
say, 5 seconds to 2.5 seconds. But this time,
before starting, the company’s development team
decided to do a series of customer visits. The
members of the team visited tooling engineers,
purchasing people, and designers. They also
wanted to visit the operators who actually used
the tool. “Why do you want to do that?” a tooling
engineer asked. “They use the tools the way I tell
them to.”
This statement sparked the team’s interest.
Fortunately, the team got access to the floor
where the operators assembled parts. This is
what they saw: The assembly line would stop
for about two minutes in front of an operator.
The operator would use the screwdriver to tap
screws into position and then to drive in the
screws. The issue wasn’t the screwdriver’s
torque; and it wasn’t how long it took an opera-
tor to drive in a screw. The issue was how long
it took an operator to line up a screw so that the
screwdriver could do its work. The team now
had an entirely different set of issues to work
with in order to solve its customers’ problem.

One of the keys to succeeding at new product development is understanding
what the customers want — what will satisfy, please, or delight them. By vis-
iting your customers, hearing what they have to say, and mapping the images
of their environments, you begin the process of understanding the customer.
The information in this section enables your team to come up with clear and
precise requirements. The advantage of identifying clear requirements is that
when product developers have to make hard and sometimes unexpected
choices during the development process, they can be absolutely sure that
their choices will meet the customer requirements identified during the
customer visit program.
The following list conveys what the visit team should do to create customer
requirements from the information they’ve gathered:
1. Go through each transcript from the visits and pull out any require-
ments you find.
Customers often know exactly what they need, and these insights are
valuable sources of product ideas. For example, a customer may have
said, “I need a way of measuring the salinity before I start the process.”
Start with the transcript your team thinks is the “richest” in terms of
requirements. You should find plenty of requirements in this first visits,
and probably fewer from the next ones.
2. Use the image map (see the previous section) to shed light on other
statements — complaints, suggestions, and so forth — that may yield
requirements.
For example, a customer may say, “That’s way too slow. You should make
it faster.” Product developers could jump to the conclusion that the cus-
tomer needs a faster process, but if you’ve created an image map, you
may be able to see the customer’s complaint in the light of an image. The
image “I’m spending too much time learning new applications” may lead
the team to think of other ways of dealing with the complaint.
3. Write clear requirements — one per sticky note.
Here are some guidelines for writing customer requirements:
• Each requirement should start with “I can.” For example, “I can
complete the process quickly.” If you start with “I can . . . ,” you’re
sure to think about the customer, not about the product.
• The requirement shouldn’t contain or imply a solution. For exam-
ple, a requirement shouldn’t state, “I can use a thinner mixture to
complete the process quickly.” Maybe the development team will
end up with exactly that solution, but if the statement doesn’t con-
tain a solution, it gives product developers more freedom to invent
solutions when the time comes.
86
Part II: Charting the Ocean of Opportunities for New Products 

• The requirement should be as specific and clear as possible. “I
can do the process better” gives the team no clue about what has
to be improved.
• The requirement should be positive. For example, instead of writ-
ing “I can keep from getting wet in the rain,” say “I can stay dry in
the rain.” Positive statements help your creative team come up
with more and better solutions.
4. Group, select, and organize the requirements.
Thirty or so is a good number of requirements to work with. You can use
the same process we describe in the previous section for grouping and
selecting images. Each initial group should have three to five sticky
notes. Use the “I can . . .” style for the group labels as well so the labels
are also requirements.
Figure 4-4 shows a sample “I can . . .” diagram produced by students in
one of co-author Beebe’s classes.
When you’re ready to brainstorm for product ideas and concepts
(see Chapter 5), and later when you’re developing your product, the
“I can . . .” tree will help you and your team stay on track. You’ll be able
to think of ideas that will help your customers do what they want to do,
and when you make changes during the development process, you’ll be
able to refer to the important customer requirements that you want to
fulfill.

Chapter 4: What Do Your Customers Really Want?

Quantifying the Results of the
Customer Visit Program
Before your product development team depends too heavily on the research
you’ve done with customers — known as qualitative research — you should
do quantitative checks. You want to make sure that a sufficiently large number
of customers value the customer requirements you’ve identified to make it
worthwhile to design products to accomplish them. You also want to know
which of the identified requirements are most important to your customers.
Your company’s marketing or market research department should be able to
help your visit team conduct research that’s statistically valid. Here are a
couple approaches we’ve used:
 Assessing the relative importance of requirements: Your team can do a
quick sanity check by asking customers how important a particular
requirement is to them. One way to quantify this is by asking, “If you had
$100 (or $1,000 or $10,000, depending on the product), how much of that
money would you spend for . . .?”
 Assessing whether a requirement is a “must have,” a “pleaser,” or a
“delighter”: Noriaki Kano, a Japanese quality expert, found that require-
ments fall into three categories:
• Things a product must have: The wheels on a car, for example
• Things that make a product more attractive: Better gas mileage,
for example
• Things that make a product delightful but that aren’t expected:
Built-in televisions in the back seat, for example
Checking with customers to make sure which requirements fit which cate-
gory can really help focus the development team’s efforts. Take a look at
Chapter 17 for more information on product testing.

W
e want your company to be an “idea factory” — a place where ideas
for new products pop up all over the place. Ideas are the starting
point for new product development success. Without creativity — without
the ability to see what could be rather than only what is — a company can’t
come up with new products of any kind.
Coming up with ideas for new products isn’t a random occurrence. It doesn’t
happen just because you, by chance, hired very creative people. Becoming
an idea factory requires the creation of an environment and a process that
enable your company to continually generate new ideas in abundance.
Why in abundance, you may ask? Because for every good idea that gets puts
into development, your company may shelve or discard hundreds of “not so
good” ideas. You may even identify hundreds of “good” ideas that unfortu-
nately don’t fit with your new product strategies. To ensure success, you
need plenty of ideas, good and bad, to choose from.
In this chapter, you find out what some of the leading product developers do to
turn their companies into idea factories. You discover how to bring together
the right mix of people who will spur each other on to more and better ideas.
You find out how to provide the structure that enables people to be creative

and how to incorporate an understanding of customer needs and wants to pro-
vide a foundation for idea building. You see how ideas can provide solutions
for customers. Also, the best product developers aren’t shy about bringing in
outside experts to provide the sauce, and sometimes even the main course, for
idea-generation sessions. Therefore, we describe how to involve experts to give
you a leg up.
Drafting Your Creative Teams
Some companies rely on individual contributors to come up with great ideas,
and others have processes in place for soliciting new ideas from employees.
Both of these strategies can be effective, but in this section we focus on the
most powerful and predictable way of generating new ideas: selecting and
using a creative team.
The teams that develop new products — cross-functional teams (see Chapter
10) — should be included on your creative teams, but you shouldn’t limit
yourself to the functional experts who know how to do what it takes to
develop new products. Reach out beyond the experts to bring in the kooky,
the uninhibited, the scientific, and the curious — in other words, the folks in
your company and outside your company who will bring spice and fire to
your proceedings.
Often, companies run customer visit projects (see Chapter 4) and creative
sessions before they have any product concepts or new product teams.
Members of the creative teams you assemble may end up on the new product
development teams for the concepts that they helped bring to life, or they
may go on to generate more concepts and leave the hard work of develop-
ment (see Chapter 9) to others.
Who’s responsible for drafting the creative team? In some companies, the
person responsible is the NPD process owner. In others, the task may fall to
the heads of the business units. Ultimately, it’s managers and executives who
need to make sure that their company’s idea factory is providing plenty of
inventory for the NPD pipeline.
To make sure that they assemble a team that is indeed creative, managers
need to pay attention to the mix of people they include. You want people who
can work well together, spur each other on, and make the most of each
other’s creativity. Usually, this means you need people who don’t often see
eye to eye with each other; in other words, you need people from different
backgrounds and with different worldviews. We recommend that you gather
people from different functions, and sometimes from outside the company as
well, including suppliers, partners, and customers.

Identifying creativity styles
Creativity style differences are real. You may even say they’re hardwired in
everyone. People process information differently and relate to people and
tasks differently. For example, some people respond to problems by coming
up with ideas that improve the existing system; others tend to generate more
radical ideas — ones that call for drastic changes. As you put together your
creative team, you need to be aware of these differences. When you have dif-
ferent creativity styles working together, you get the best of all worlds.
Another big difference is between extraverts and introverts. You may think
that you’d prefer to have all extraverts on your creative team. These are the
people who will jump into a session, call out their ideas, and never be at a
loss for words. But if you manage creativity sessions well, you can design
ways for the introverts to participate, too, and you’ll get the added benefit of
their thinking, which can be more carefully considered than the extraverts’.
If you have a qualified person to administer them, you can use surveys to
assess your employees’ creativity styles. Some of the most widely used
assessments include the Myers-Briggs, the Herman Brain Dominance, the I-
Opt, and the KAI (the Kirton Adaptive/Innovative Scale). You can find out
more about these assessments on the Internet.
Knowing the styles of your prospective participants will help you to build a
diverse creative team. But even if you can’t effectively assess creativity styles
by using surveys, you can observe to get a sense of how people relate to the
world — how radical or conservative they tend to be, how talkative or silent
they appear, how thoughtful or off-the-cuff they seem, and so on. Use your
instincts to make sure that you include people who fall on all sides of these
spectrums.
Uniting the styles and functions
When forming a team that will stock your company’s inventory of new product
ideas, you must remember that diversity is essential. You need people with dif-
ferent types of creativity styles (see the previous section). Furthermore, you
should add people with different skills, experiences, and roles in the company,
because they’ll see processes and ideas from different points of view and will
approach the task of being creative differently. Marketers will come up with dif-
ferent ideas than engineers or software experts; together, they’ll come up with
ideas that none of them would’ve thought of alone. You should also include
people of differing age, gender, and cultural or ethnic background whenever
possible.
91
Chapter 5: Turning Your Company into an Idea Factory

In addition to the team members, each creativity team should include a facili-
tator who can guide the team through the creative process. The facilitator
also helps team members to “get along” despite their diverse perspectives
and styles.
People who play different roles in a company, and who have different skill
sets and experiences, often find it difficult to work together. Perhaps you’ve
heard old stories about marketing and R&D members trying to talk to each
other. Engineers from China and the United States tend to be more like each
other than engineers and marketers from the same country and culture.
However, these business differences, blended in the task and spirit of a cre-
ative team, are necessary. They provide impetus and incentive for many more
ideas, from process changes to product concepts, than you’d get from one
business function on its own. (See the later section “Breaking the ice” for tips
on creating a friendly environment.)
Enticing customers to participate
If you’ve carried out a customer visit program — and, ideally, you should do
this before the creativity sessions — you should have plenty of information
from customers on what they dislike in the marketplace and on what they
desire and need from prospective products (flip to Chapter 4 if you want to
get going on customer visits). In addition to sharing information from cus-
tomer visits with the creative team, it can be very useful to include cus-
tomers as members of the creative team.
92
Part II: Charting the Ocean of Opportunities for New Products 
What’s missing here?
Co-author Beebe Nelson walked into a meeting
held by a team that wanted to improve sanitary
products for women. Every participant was an
engineer, and they were all men. All they could
think of to improve the products was to find
ways to prevent leakage.
Co-author Robin Karol once worked with a
creative team at a consumer products com-
pany. The team was charged with generating
ideas for a new deodorant made especially for
teens. No participant on the team had teenage
children.
In the first example, it would’ve been easy for
the team to ask female employees to participate
in the creative session. In the second, the team
could’ve found employees with children and
asked whether their children could participate.
Don’t overlook the useful resources in your own
company — the people whose experiences
might make them perfect members of creative
teams. And don’t fall into the trap of thinking that
one type of knowledge or experience — for
instance, marketing savvy or scientific know-
how — is all you need to come up with ideas for
products that will please your customers.

Finding customers
One of the easiest ways to involve customers on a creative team is to invite
employees from your own company who are members of the target customer
group. Co-author Robin, for example, was once part of a group of scientists
who held a technical creative session to generate new ideas for hair-coloring
products. She asked the session manager how many people in the group
actually used hair coloring. The answer was zero. Robin suggested that they
invite the administrative assistants in the department who used hair-coloring
products to join the scientists. The scientists would’ve been reluctant to put
outsiders in the room because the session would reveal information about
proprietary technology; however, the administrative assistants were employees,
so the scientists agreed.
The “customers” on the team provided outstanding insight into how people
used the products and what improvements they would want. The result of
the session was very positive, and the session was extremely motivating for
the administrative assistants. They found the day exciting and stimulating,
and they got an inside look at what their company was up to.
If your development team has been visiting customers — and we hope they
have — you probably have contacts outside the company whom you could
invite to participate in a creative session. If not, your sales department
should be able to introduce you to some appropriate customers. Always be
aware that you’re looking for diversity. Even as you invite customers, think
about creativity styles, company role, age, gender, and cultural diversity.
Customers aren’t always easy to manage! Co-author Beebe once invited a
therapist to participate in a creative session for a product he used in the hos-
pital. He had very strong ideas. So strong that instead of an idea generation
session, the meeting turned into a lecture on the best way to design the prod-
uct. The creative team did learn something from the customer, but it didn’t
accomplish the goals of the session. If you invite customers from the outside,
you have to realize that they have their own agendas. Make the details and
goals of the session and process very clear to the customers.
Many outside customers expect to be paid to participate in idea generation
sessions, which is perfectly appropriate. You should also follow up with a
thank you and a gift if it seems appropriate. Some companies build groups of
loyal customers whom they can count on to participate in sessions regularly.
Treat them well — they are your customers!
Scheduling a session with customers in mind
You should always allocate at least two days for a creative session (see the
following section for more on setting up sessions) — especially when you’re
working with customers. You can invite the customers to participate on the
first day and then spend the second day fleshing out the customer input in an
employees-only session.
93
Chapter 5: Turning Your Company into an Idea Factory

You don’t have to reveal proprietary knowledge when you run idea genera-
tion sessions. However, to build on ideas, you need to understand what your
company can do. Customers can generate plenty of ideas without knowing
the technology; on the second day of the session, the internal team can elab-
orate on the ideas with knowledge of the company’s resources.
You may want to schedule a half-day session that includes only customers
before you put them in with the creative team. The rest of the team can listen
in or observe the session through a one-way mirror; you can even tape the
session (be sure the customers have agreed to being watched or taped!).
This meeting allows the creative team to understand what the customers
are thinking before the actual session, and it gives the facilitator a chance
to teach the customers how to be most productive in the creative setting.
Setting Up and Opening
the Creative Session
Creativity may seem like a random or lucky experience; it can be, but more
often it’s the result of careful planning. An idea generation session needs
structure. The people who attend the session — the creative team — need to
place all their attention and energies on coming up with ideas. The environ-
ment of the meeting should make this easy for them. Why aren’t people cre-
ative all the time? Probably because their attention is pulled to other, more
practical matters. People have things to do, others to meet, reports to write,
research to do, and so on. While the team members are working together,
they should have as few of these distractions as possible, because your cre-
ative team should experience the luxury of being able to focus all their atten-
tion on coming up with good ideas.
Every creative session needs someone who’s responsible for providing
structure, the person we call a session manager. Better yet is a small group
of people who have that responsibility. If you go this route, the group should
include a skilled facilitator, someone to whom the results are important
(a team leader or senior manager, for example), and someone who has the
time, skills, and contacts to pull off the session design (such as a project
manager).
The session manager(s) is responsible for confirming the participants,
attending to meeting details, providing an agenda, and getting the session
going. The following sections detail these duties.
94
Part II: Charting the Ocean of Opportunities for New Products 

Informing the participants
The session manager’s first duty is to communicate with the meeting atten-
dees to give them the details of the session. Be very clear about the timing —
the date of the meeting and the meeting times — and the logistics. Most cre-
ative sessions are two-day affairs, so be sure to let them know whether a
dinner will be served for the group. Make sure that everyone has directions
to the meeting location and that they know how to get in. If they need to ask
for a contact person when they arrive, let them know about that.
If you plan the session well in advance, we recommend that you reconfirm
people’s plans to attend a few days before the session.
Providing a conducive environment:
The devil’s in the details
You have all kinds of details to consider when you’re setting up a creative
session. You’ll want to provide the following for session participants:
 Comfortable seating in a comfortable room: For a creative session, you
want a room with plenty of space and plenty of empty walls. Creativity
includes walking around, meeting in small groups, and hanging the
results of everyone’s thinking on the walls.
 Snacks, drinks, and meals as appropriate: Be sure to keep people well
fed and snacked while the session is in progress. It’s nice also to bring
the group together for a relaxed dinner if your session will last more
than one day. Such informal settings often get participants thinking in
different ways, which may help to produce even more ideas.
 Pre-work displayed for all to see: This includes the results of any prior
customer visits — images, requirements, and so on (see Chapter 4). You
may also need space and tables for building rough models and proto-
types (see the later section “Building a rough concept model”).
You also need the right materials to support the creative session. At a mini-
mum, you need an ample supply of the following:
 Flip chart paper
 Markers
 Sticky notes
 Felt-tip pens
 Tape
95
Chapter 5: Turning Your Company into an Idea Factory

Be sure that everyone supporting the structure of the meeting — for
instance, the people setting up the breaks — is clear about the meeting’s
schedule and the session manager’s needs.
We can’t overstate the importance of this: Have the name of the contact person
who can help you keep the room comfortable and functioning. A/V equipment
and room temperature are two areas where you may need outside help!
Breaking the ice
The creative session participants will be spending quite a bit of time together.
The more comfortable they are with each other, the more they’ll open up and
share their thoughts. Start the creative session with informal introductions.
Even if the participants already know each other, they may know each other
only as colleagues, bosses, and so on in the everyday world of work. An ice-
breaker establishes the possibility of another kind of relationship — one in
which the participants are free to say what they think, make mistakes, be
outrageous, and have fun.
Here are a few icebreakers that work well:
 Ask participants to draw pictures of themselves to show to the group.
When they introduce themselves, ask them to describe how the pictures
reveal something about them.
 Ask them to share personal facts that no one in the room is aware of.
 Ask them to share what excites them about the project and what they
hope won’t happen.
 Ask them to tell the group about where they were born, using little-
known facts. One of co-author Beebe Nelson’s colleagues, who lives in
Quincy, Massachusetts, introduced himself as coming from the “city of
dead presidents.”
Almost anything that isn’t the typical “My name is X, and I work in Y depart-
ment” will do the trick.
Presenting the problem
and the ground rules
After the participants of the creative session get acquainted, the facilitator or
session leader needs to present a clear statement of the problem that the ses-
sion is intended to solve. This statement must be much more specific than a
broad question like, “What new products can we come up with for our com-
pany?” The group members should have a general idea of why they’ve been
96
Part II: Charting the Ocean of Opportunities for New Products 

invited to participate in the session, but they’ll be able to focus their work
much better if they have a statement or question that has the following
characteristics:
 Is clear and concise
 Addresses the true issue/problem
 Includes any necessary boundary conditions
Here are a few examples of good problem statements:
 “Our job is to come up with solutions for farmers who own small farms
and often must repair their own farm equipment. We should focus our
solutions on all different kinds of equipment, from large motorized
machines to small handtools, and metalwork.”
The boundary conditions are “own small farms” and “all different kinds
of equipment.”
 “We want to come up with financial products that will attract customers
to our mortgage services. We can include all sizes of mortgages, from
first-time small-home buyers to jumbo loans, and from first to second
mortgages and all other kinds of home-equity lending.”
The boundary conditions here are “all sizes of mortgages” and different
types of mortgages.
 “What could we do to make our toothpaste fun, effective, and easy to
use? What would totally change tooth-cleaning habits? Do you really need
to use a brush? Do you have to brush twice a day? On the ‘improvement’
side, how can we improve how people brush their teeth now — can we
make our product taste better and prevent bad breath?”
The final example really makes room for both product improvement and radi-
cal breakthrough products.
A great icebreaker is to have the participants build a “vision” of the solution
by using bits and pieces of materials. You divide the group into subgroups of
three or four and give them instructions (for example, you can say “Build a
model of your vision of the perfect solution for this problem”). We often ask
groups to do the task without talking. After the groups have completed the
task, have each group discuss what it has done and then show its “vision” to
the whole group. (See “Building a rough concept model” later in this chapter
for more instructions on using materials in your sessions.)
In addition to clear problem statements, creative teams need explicit ground
rules to focus their work and help the session run smoothly. We find that it
works best to generate ground rules in a discussion and to write them up on a
flip chart, which should remain posted throughout the session. See Figure 5-1
for an example of a session’s ground rules.
97
Chapter 5: Turning Your Company into an Idea Factory

Always wait until after the participants have gotten to know each other and
have looked at the session purpose before asking them to generate a list of
ground rules. The less somber they are, the better — generating ground rules
can be a creative act.
Getting Creative by Thinking
Outside the Box
You hear the phrase “Think outside the box” all the time, but what does it
really mean, and where did it originate? It comes from a puzzle that asks you
to connect nine dots in straight lines without raising your pencil. To com-
plete the task, you have to go, literally, outside the box.
Thinking outside the box is shorthand for open-ended, divergent thinking.
Creative thinking doesn’t judge the results. It seeks novelty in whatever occurs
during the thinking process. It builds on whatever anyone has said. It asks
“How?” in a spirit of curiosity. It doesn’t say “Yes, but,” it says “Yes, and . . .”
In this section, we show you some ways to help your creative team think out-
side the box during your idea-generation sessions. But first, we talk about
how to “empty the box.”
Sample Ground Rules for a Creative Session
• Go for quantity, not quality
• Don’t filter your own ideas
• Don’t criticize others’ ideas
• Don’t be afraid to mention anything
• Crazy ideas can lead to other things
• There’s no such thing as a “bad idea”
• Cheat!!! Piggy-back on each others’ ideas
• >>> Push yourself
• Each and every idea is valuable
• Have fun!!!!

Part II: Charting the Ocean of Opportunities for New Products 

First things first: Emptying the box
We like to start creative sessions by emptying the box. What does this mean?
Well, when you’re presented with a problem to solve, you immediately put it
in the context of what you already know. Therefore, the first ideas that come
to mind usually are familiar, already understood, and easy to think about.
These ideas represent the easy solutions. They may work, but they aren’t
“outside the box.” You want to get these ideas out on the table; until you do,
the creative team will have trouble moving on to the out-of-the-box ideas.
So, how do you empty the box? If the creative group is small (say, just six to
eight people), participants can start by suggesting ideas out loud and captur-
ing them on a flip chart until everyone is “empty.” If the creative group is
larger, or if it has many introverts who might not participate in an out-loud
session, you can give out sticky notes and have everyone write ideas on
them. This method is easier on the facilitator or notetaker (she doesn’t have
to write down the ideas), and it helps the more introverted members who
may not be as willing to call out their ideas early on in a group session.
Here’s a way to work with the sticky notes:
1. Each person writes down a minimum of 10 to 15 ideas on individual
sticky notes.
2. Each person passes her note(s) to the person on her right.
99
Chapter 5: Turning Your Company into an Idea Factory
The bear that climbed out of the box
Once upon a time, a group of people were trying
to solve the problem of ice damage to high-
tension wires in cold climates. One group
member suggested that they could have bears
climb up the poles, which would shake the
wires and cause the ice to fall off. Another
member replied, “Great, and how will we get
the bears to climb the poles?” The first group
member answered, “We could hang pots of
honey at the tops of the poles, and the bears
would smell the honey and climb up to get it.”
“Okay, and how will we get the honey up the
poles?” “We could fly helicopters over the poles
and drop the honey pots down.” A secretary,
who attended the session to take notes,
exclaimed, “When I was a medical aide in
Vietnam, I rode in a lot of helicopters. The down-
draft from the blades makes a really strong
wind. It blew everything all over the place. I’m
sure it would knock the ice off the wires!”
The participants looked at each other in amaze-
ment. They had just come up with a viable, inex-
pensive way of solving the problem. The
discussion started with a silly idea and ended
with the insight of someone who just planned on
taking notes.

3. Each person reviews the note(s) she receives and writes down three
new ideas.
A participant can come up with a totally new idea, or she can build on
an idea or combine two or more ideas into a new concept.
4. Each person passes the notes to the right again, and the group pairs off.
5. The pairs review and discuss the notes in front of them and come up
with a minimum of three to five more ideas.
Again, these ideas can be new, built on other ideas, or be combinations
of earlier ideas.
6. The pairs paste their ideas on a flip chart page (or two) for everyone
to look at and discuss.
If, during this discussion, the group comes up with any new ideas, you
can add them to the chart.
No idea is a bad idea! Keep these ideas posted during the rest of the creative
session. The group may use them to strengthen ideas they come up with later
or combine them into a more “out-of-the-box” idea. Sometimes, even though
you’re just emptying the box and not expecting people to be all that creative,
someone comes up with the best idea of the day in the first hour of the session.
Brainstorming
After the group has “empty brains,” the members will find it easier to come
up with more creative ideas by brainstorming. The term brainstorming refers
to the many methods of generating a large number of creative ideas with a
group. You can use brainstorming all by yourself when you’re trying to find
creative ways to solve a problem. And you can use it over and over during
the session to capture the ideas that the group comes up with.
The following list presents the basic steps of brainstorming:
1. Post the brainstorming ground rules.
These rules are similar to the ground rules you set for the whole session
(see the section “Presenting the problem and the ground rules”), but
they include some specific rules for brainstorming. In particular,
• Don’t judge ideas (negatively or positively!).
• Go for quantity over quality.
• Cheat (use others’ ideas by building on, combining, or altering
them).
100
Part II: Charting the Ocean of Opportunities for New Products 

2. Set the brainstorming agenda.
Include a clear time frame. A half-hour works well. If you go longer,
people get stormed out; if you go shorter, you’ll leave ideas on the table.
Review the brainstorming agenda (outlined here in Steps 3 through 8)
with the team and post it so participants can remind themselves of the
steps they’ll go through.
3. Display the problem statement for the whole creative session, or draft
one that focuses on a specific issue you want the team to address.
4. Begin the brainstorming by asking people to call out ideas or to write
them on sticky notes.
Ask for full sentences that focus on the problem statement. For example:
“We could provide a tool kit that holds a tool for every situation a farmer
with a small farm might come across.”
If you use sticky notes and put them all up on the wall (hundreds of new
ideas, we hope), a useful and productive action at this point is to have
the team silently group the notes into common themes. For example, the
team may group all the ideas that have to do with storing tools and sep-
arate all the ones that have to do with repairing tools. The groupings will
sometimes create themes that lead to new ideas.
5. Write up or post all the grouped ideas, and then have the team mem-
bers “vote” by placing check marks or dots on the ideas or themes
they like.
Be sure to tell the group members to look for unique ideas and ones that
stand out by themselves. You can limit the number of votes — say, by
giving each team member three or five — but unlimited also works.
The team is voting in order to narrow down the number of possibilities.
But don’t let good ideas go down the drain at this point! Here are two
ways to avoid this:
• Give every team member the opposite of a U.N. Security Council
veto: Any idea that a team member wants to include is in, no
matter how many votes the idea gets.
• Keep all the ideas in plain sight throughout the session. Just like
the “empty the box” ideas (see the previous section), ideas that get
few votes may still be important — by themselves, or when com-
bined with others.
Another fun and useful way to vote on ideas is to give each participant a
set of stickers that have values on them, like coins. Each individual
should have a fixed amount of “sticker money” to spend on the ideas.
After the money is spent, you add the value next to each idea to priori-
tize and select.
101
Chapter 5: Turning Your Company into an Idea Factory

6. Put the most popular ideas on a clean wall or flip chart page.
Make sure you keep the “losing” ideas visible — you may still have a
treasure in there!
7. Pair up the group members and have each pair use the popular ideas
to create a new, composite idea.
They can write this new idea on an 81⁄2"-x-11" sheet of paper. Instruct the
teams to write full sentences to describe their ideas. You can also give
them an outline to follow. For example, you may ask them to give a name
to an idea, identify what customer needs it will fulfill, and briefly describe
it. Encourage each pair to make a sketch of their idea — one picture, no
matter how crudely drawn, really is worth a thousand words at this point
in the process. (Take a look at Chapter 6 for an Idea Form outline you
could use here.)
8. Post these ideas and have the whole group review, critique, and build
on them.
Each time you complete a brainstorming session, you should have tens or
hundreds of ideas, plus the judgment and deliberation of a team in narrowing
them down and improving them. The flow of divergent (opening out) and
convergent (narrowing down) is typical of creative processes. Brainstorming
allows the creative group to be creative (divergent) and also to use their
judgment (convergent).
Mindmapping
Mindmapping is becoming increasingly popular for stimulating both individ-
ual and group creativity. Mindmapping is a great way to come up with plenty
of ideas quickly and to help the creative group find themes or issues it may
have overlooked.
To mindmap, you follow these steps:
1. Pose a question and write it at the center of a large piece of paper,
which you hang on the wall.
This question provides elaboration on the focus or problem statement
for the session (see the section “Presenting the problem and the ground
rules”). For example, you may ask, “What kinds of equipment do farmers
with small farms use?”
2. The session manager or facilitator asks for major themes that relate to
the question.
For instance, if the group is meeting to solve the problem of a farmer
who always needs to repair his own farm equipment on his small farm,
the themes may include tractors, milking equipment, handtools, power
tools, and so on.
102
Part II: Charting the Ocean of Opportunities for New Products 

3. The session manager draws lines that jet out from the central
question — like the arms of a spider web — and labels each arm
with one of the themes.
4. The group starts to brainstorm solutions that may serve the different
themes.
For example, the group may come up with solutions for repairing milking
equipment — “Have a spare piece of equipment in the closet” — or for
repairing tractors — “Get the tractor manufacturer to redesign how the
farmer can get to the engine.” Neither of these ideas may lead directly to
solutions, but they may spur on others to come up with new thoughts or
be useful later on when the team is building concepts (see the section
“The solution: Putting together ideas to form concepts”).
If a participant thinks of another theme during the brainstorming, the
facilitator can add it to the chart. Solutions that may cut across several
themes can appear on several arms of the web.
Setting sail on a creative excursion
One of the best ways to inspire creativity in your team — and certainly a
method that’s out of the box — is to go on a creative excursion. Many teams
use excursions to set up a brainstorming session. You define the problem —
say, for example, “How can we meet our customers’ needs for increased
safety in using our product?” After you empty the box and brainstorm ideas,
your team is struggling to come up with ideas. Give them a break! After some
coffee and doughnuts (or fruit and cookies), you can start the excursions.
Ask the participants to consider how they might solve the problem in the
jungle. Do a mini-brainstorm with that task in mind, following the brainstorm-
ing steps we list in the section “Brainstorming.” Ask the group to solve the
problem as a plumber might. Ask them to consider how they’d solve the
problem if they were at sea in a boat. And so on.
To continue the example from the previous sections, how would our farmer
repair his equipment if he lived in the jungle? He might use palm fronds and
coconuts to fix broken tools. What if he were a plumber? He’d probably use a
plumber’s helper to suck liquids out of broken tractor engines. At sea in a
boat, he’d use rope to tie the broken parts together. It’s the combination of
ideas, not any one kooky idea alone, that brings the team to creative and
implementable solutions.
A session manager or facilitator should come up with a list of creative excur-
sions that she can pull out of her pocket whenever the energy of the group
seems to be lagging. In addition to the previous examples, she could ask the
group members what solutions would certainly fail. What would get them
103
Chapter 5: Turning Your Company into an Idea Factory

fired or would probably lose money for the company? What would break the
laws of physics? Don’t limit yourself to the obvious. The random and the off-
beat can produce the best responses.
Using Your Knowledge of the Customer
to Inspire Solutions
Even if actual customers don’t participate in your idea-generation sessions,
the session manager(s) or facilitator should make sure to have as much
knowledge of the customer as possible in the room to inspire and focus the
group. A small group — the session manager(s) and the facilitator, for example
— should take time before a session to gather known customer information
and put it in a form that will provoke creativity. (See Chapter 4 for tips on
customer visits.)
During the idea session, if you have photos of customers or of customer envi-
ronments, post them. Perhaps you have a map that shows where your target
customers are; at times during the idea session, the facilitator may ask the
group to focus “just on the customers in Canada,” or “just on customers in
Japan,” or “just on teenaged boys,” and so on.
If you’ve gathered enough information about your customers, try construct-
ing several composite sketches of “typical” customers before the session.
These customers should represent all the diversity and contradiction that
exist in your customer group. These sketches will influence the creative
team, so you don’t want to slant their influence in any one direction. Making
your customers real inspires your creative team to come up with real solu-
tions for them. Keep the sketches short, and add a picture of someone who
might look like your “character.” Post the sketches on the wall where every-
one can see them. (Take a look at this book’s Introduction to see the sketches
we drafted to help us picture our customer — YOU!)
The objective: Enabling the customer
to do what he wants
If you’ve done a customer visit program (see Chapter 4), you already have a
list of customer requirements that you can use to come up with ideas and
solutions. But even if you haven’t followed the customer visit process, you
104
Part II: Charting the Ocean of Opportunities for New Products 

can brainstorm a list of requirements, or customer needs, that your creative
team’s solutions will address (see the earlier section “Brainstorming”). Your
objective in creating new products, after all, is to give your customers what
they need and want. Here’s how the process should go:
1. Post and review your customer information.
See the introduction to this section for ideas on how to prepare cus-
tomer information for the team.
2. Ask the team to brainstorm requirements.
Use the sticky-note method or write the requirements on flip chart pages.
Start each requirement with “I can,” which forces your team members to
think of what customers want to be able to do. Here are a few “I can”
statements that capture the requirements of patients who use medical
devices:
• I can hold onto my device with my arthritic hands.
• I can carry my device with me inconspicuously.
• I can clean my device easily.
If you’ve made a customer requirements tree by following the instruc-
tions in Chapter 4, you can use that.
3. Narrow down the requirements by voting, and then group them into
not more than four or five groups of similar requirements.
The team from the medical device session grouped the previous require-
ments under the following theme: “I can carry out my therapy just the
way I am.”
4. Post each group of requirements on the wall of the meeting room, and
instruct the team members to wander around the room thinking of
solutions for each specific requirement.
They can write their ideas on sticky notes — one idea per sticky note —
and then stick them to the flip chart pages that list the requirements
those ideas relate to.
As the group members wander around, remind them to focus on each
individual requirement rather than the total solution. When a team at
Bose was brainstorming ideas for a home-theater system, one of the cus-
tomer requirements was “I can hide my system so no one notices it.”
One of the team members drew a picture of speakers cleverly designed
as coats in a closet. Another member drew pictures of dog statues —
with the big one labeled “woofer” and the little one labeled “tweeter.”
105
Chapter 5: Turning Your Company into an Idea Factory

The solution: Putting together
ideas to form concepts
When your creative team has produced many ideas and solutions for the indi-
vidual customer requirements you’ve identified or brainstormed, take a break!
When you regroup, the next step is to gather the solution ideas into concepts
(you can use the Idea Form we include in Chapter 6). Each member of the team
should wander around the room to collect ideas from the earlier brainstorming
to blend into a concept. Let the participants know that they can deviate from,
build on, or change the ideas they find on the requirements sheets. They can
even come up with totally new solutions that no one thought of before the
break!
What’s the difference between an idea and a concept? You can’t draw a clear
line of demarcation, but an idea usually can be expressed in a sentence. “We
could hide the speakers inside dog statues!” A concept fills out the idea and
provides more information. Often, a concept is based on several ideas. A
concept should include a description of the customer needs addressed and
a suggestion of “how” — what technology would it use, for instance.
After the team members have created a number of concepts, have each con-
cept author share her concept with the group and post it on a flip chart page
or on the wall. All told, you want about eight to ten concepts to work with. If
you have more, and you probably will, team members can vote for the ones
they feel are strongest and then make those even stronger by cherry-picking
from the others.
To improve your team’s beginning concepts, you can use a process based on
Pugh Concept Selection. We talk about using this process to select concepts
in Chapter 6, but we’ve also gotten great results by utilizing it early in the
development process when you want to strengthen concepts rather than
select them. Here are the basics:
1. Create a matrix with the concepts along the top (X-axis) and the
requirements down the side (Y-axis).
2. Give each concept a name or number at the top of the matrix; leave
the concept sheets posted so team members can refer to them.
3. Fill in each square of the matrix with a code.
For example, a concept that fulfills a requirement well can get a 3 in that
box; if the concept fills the requirement just so-so, it can get a 2; and if
the concept does a poor job of fulfilling a requirement, it can get a 1.
The facilitator can get the team through this process by calling out the
concept, asking the team members to rank it against each of the require-
ments, and then filling in the squares.
106
Part II: Charting the Ocean of Opportunities for New Products 

4. Strengthen each of the concepts by stealing bits and pieces from other
concepts.
Because the concepts started from specific customer requirements, they
hit that nail on the head. And because you have the chance to combine
and strengthen, several of the concepts can end up doing a good job of
meeting all or at least most of the requirements.
In Chapter 6, you find out how to select the best product concepts — the
ones that will pass through the Idea Screen and into the river of development
(see the Cheat Sheet for more on the river).
Dipping into Your Bag of Tricks to Make
Creative Sessions Even More Creative
In this chapter, we’ve described plenty of activities you can conduct to come
up with ideas and concepts for new products. But we couldn’t resist adding a
few more! After all, this chapter is about being creative, and there’s no limit
to the things a creative mind can do.
In this section, we explain how you can bring in experts from outside the
company to expand the team’s appreciation of market and technology issues.
We also describe some ways that creative teams can use their artistic
propensities in the service of coming up with the next, best ideas.
Bring in the experts!
Information about technology and market trends — information that can
come from experts inside or outside your company — can really help your
team think outside the company “box.” What new technologies are being
developed in industries that impact yours? What are the latest market trends
that could affect your customers? For example, has someone developed a
new way of delivering oxygen that may impact the medical devices you can
develop? Are farmers beginning to use a different line of plowing equipment?
How are young professionals dressing these days?
To answer these questions, you can bring in experts in various fields for day-
long sessions with your creative team. In this section, we describe how you
can collect information that you can bring right into the creative session and
post on the wall for teams and experts to work with.
107
Chapter 5: Turning Your Company into an Idea Factory

Creating the session focus statement
For your informational sessions, which should run at least one day (and
preferably two), you need clear focus statements to start the days (and to
prepare your speakers; see the following section). The problem statement
specifies both the customers whom you want to create product ideas for and
what issues most interest you. Here are a few examples, each of which might
be the focus of a different session:
“We want to learn about ways people are meeting the needs of parents
who want to give their children healthy food. We’re particularly inter-
ested in the issues of obesity and ‘eating on the run.’”
“Where are the principal markets for healthy foods for kids? Who are the
players in these markets? What are the regulatory issues? What are the
key cultural factors? How are these factors changing, and what changes/
trends should we anticipate?”
“What are the new process and product technologies that address
healthy eating? We’re particularly interested in what scientists are learn-
ing about trans fats and other ingredients; what the implications are for
products in terms of packaging, texture, flavor, and so on; and what new
technologies may be on the horizon.”
Inviting the experts
After you’ve framed your questions, do some research — with people in your
company and on the Internet — to identify who the experts are. You want
them to visit you to answer your questions — that is, to deliver the wealth of
wisdom they have on the topic you’re interested in. Often, cold-calls to these
experts can secure a visit commitment. If not, use the cold-calls to ask the
known experts who they can recommend for an invitation.
It’s perfectly appropriate to offer to pay expenses and an honorarium.
However, you don’t need to pay top price to an expert. If someone is asking
for what seems like an outrageously high fee, find a more junior person who
may know just as much, will be flattered to be invited, and will likely com-
mand a much lower fee.
The agenda for the informational session should include no more than three
or four expert speakers and allow plenty of time for questions and discus-
sions. If your speakers can stay for the whole day, they can enrich the discus-
sion with their questions and observations of others’ input.
Diversity is important in your selection of experts. You want to hear from
people with different points of view. For example, if you want to think of new
solutions for customers who drill oil, you want to hear about global warming
and the future of energy from someone who’s focused on sustainability and
renewable energy sources. And you want to hear from someone else who thinks
that the solution lies in exploration and production. Try to find out as much as
you can about the opinions and points of view that exist in the market.
108
Part II: Charting the Ocean of Opportunities for New Products 

Bringing in outside experts is great, but don’t overlook experts in your own
company who can offer a lot of information that the team may be unaware of.
There are often “pockets” of expertise in companies — world-class knowl-
edge that rarely gets out to the rest of the folks in the companies.
Having in-house experts at the information session presents two advantages:
 It helps with confidentiality and the protection of intellectual property
(see Chapter 15).
 Any applicable market knowledge or technology is more easily available
if you find later that you want to access it to develop products.
For these reasons, you may think that it’s best to invite only internal experts.
However, you want to get a broad view of the markets and of emerging
technologies — one that isn’t limited to what your company already knows.
Therefore, be sure to include folks from “away,” too, as they put it in the South.
Use the problem statement you drafted for the team (see the section
“Creating the session focus statement”) to help your invited guests prepare.
Ask them to be ready to talk for about a half-hour each, with another half-
hour of Q&A. Ask the guests to prepare PDF documents or slides that they’re
willing to leave with the team for later review.
Here are some additional questions you can present to help the experts
prepare:
 What’s the current picture (of the technology or of the market)?
 What do you see developing or changing in the next six months? Two
years? Ten years?
 What opportunities or threats do you see as a result of current condi-
tions and future changes?
Organizing the session output
The output of the expert session should be a number insights that relate to the
problem area you want to solve for customers. Use the brainstorming process
to collect the team’s insights and narrow them down. If the team creates story-
boards to depict what they’ve learned, these storyboards can be brought into
the room and used as a focus for brainstorming during the creative session.
(See the next section for tips on how to create and use storyboards.)
Schedule this session for the next day, which leaves the team free to invite
out-of-town speakers to join them for dinner.
Have the team prepare to collect insights as the session goes along by writing
their thoughts on sticky notes.
109
Chapter 5: Turning Your Company into an Idea Factory

Enlisting the team’s artistic right brain
in the creative process
Creative idea generation sessions draw more on a participant’s right brain than
the left. Your right brain is the more intuitive part that sees things in pictures
and that makes nonlinear connections. It leaps to conclusions from scant bits
of data; that can be bad in some situations, but when you’re being creative, it’s
all good.
Plan your idea generation session to include some right-brain activities, and
have a few in reserve in case you find the energy lagging. A good facilitator
can sense when the creative team needs more fuel and will depart from the
set agenda to include “playtime.”
The tools we describe in this section give your team members a chance to do
the right-brained activities usually reserved for artists and kids: drawing,
model building, and acting. Each of the activities takes about an hour from
start to finish.
Right-brained activities bring a spirit of play into the creative sessions. They
can help the team lift its sights to a longer-term vision instead of staying too
focused on today. They gather information in a form that can short-circuit the
rational, skeptical left brain. But don’t worry — the left brain gets to do
plenty in new product development. Chapters 6 and 8, in particular, explain
how to narrow down, judge, and apply criteria — to look before you leap, in
other words.
Storyboards and skits bring the customer experience home
Storyboards and skits are particularly useful tools to insert the customer
experience right into the creative session — and right into the team mem-
bers’ emotional centers. These tools require that your team get creative —
artistically creative. We’re always surprised and pleased to see how quickly
people who’ve never drawn, painted, or acted get into these activities.
Storyboards tell a story
We’ve used storyboarding in creative sessions to help teams understand the
customer experience, to represent insights into markets and technologies,
and in other ways to condense information and make it readily accessible to
the teams. Storyboarding was developed at the Walt Disney Studios in the
early 1930s. A filmmaker uses a sequence of storyboards to describe how the
film’s action will progress. Because each storyboard depicts a specific event,
we recommend that you use single storyboards to show what’s going on in
the lives of customers or in the world of technology and/or the market.
110
Part II: Charting the Ocean of Opportunities for New Products 

Here’s how to construct a storyboard:
1. Hold an information-gathering session, such as an expert session (see
the section “Bring in the experts!”) or a program of customer visits
(see Chapter 4).
2. Identify key themes or insights from the session.
3. Pair off your team members, and have each pair choose a theme or
insight that they want to work on.
4. Have each pair create a poster-sized storyboard that captures the
insight in pictures and words.
The more the pairs think like Disney cartoonists, the more interesting
and useful their storyboards will be.
5. Halfway through the storyboarding session, bring the groups together
to share what they’ve done so far.
Encourage feedback from all the pairs. The team members should let
each other know what they see, feel, and understand when they look at
the storyboards; they also should ask questions about anything that’s
unclear and offer suggestions for how to make the storyboards more
interesting.
6. Have the pairs go back to complete their storyboards.
Make sure each pair is clear that their storyboard has to stand on its
own. If something on the storyboard requires explanation, the team
members have to figure out a way to make it self-explanatory to people
at the creative session.
If your product is a service, storyboarding can help to bring the steps in the
service alive. For example, storyboards might show a customer arriving at
the hotel, registering for a room, checking in, and ordering a meal from room
service. These storyboards can be constructed before a session to show
where the issues are, and/or after a session to show how solutions delight
the customers and meet their needs.
Here are the materials you’ll need for a storyboarding session:
 Large sheets of paper that can sit on a flip chart stand or stay taped to
the wall. Each pair should have several sheets.
 A variety of markers in different sizes and colors.
 Access to the Internet, a printer if possible, and old magazines or other
sources of pictures and photographs.
 Glue, scissors, a ruler, and maybe a compass for drawing circles (remem-
ber elementary school?).
111
Chapter 5: Turning Your Company into an Idea Factory

The best storyboards combine words with pictures. Team members should
use drawings or photographs to illustrate their storyboards. Sometimes, flow
charts illustrated with cartoon characters can get ideas across well. And in
this digital age, you can easily download a photo or find some clip art online
if you don’t have the right photo or drawing handy.
Skits bring customers right into the room
You can turn your creative team members into thespians in order to carry
out skits. Seriously, can you picture a group of marketers, engineers, manu-
facturers, executives, financial experts, and purchasing agents willingly play-
ing roles and acting out scenes in their customers’ lives? We couldn’t either,
but after we tried it a couple of times, we realized that we’re all hams under
the surface, and we all love stepping into other worlds and acting out.
When people act out a situation, they learn about it. They discover issues
they never knew existed. They get “under the skin” to relate to the joys and
frustrations of customers. And when they go back to generating ideas, they
do so with a considerable increase in empathy and understanding, along with
a much fuller appreciation of what product developers call “latent needs.”
To do skits as part of or in preparation for a creative session, you need good
customer information. You can use the information you gather during cus-
tomer visits (see Chapter 4). You can use the customer descriptions that you
gathered into customer sketches (refer to the section “Using Your Knowledge
of the Customer to Inspire Solutions,” earlier in the chapter). Perhaps some
people from your sales or marketing department could help prepare the
scenarios.
The facilitator or small session group that organizes the creativity session
needs to plan the skits and activities very carefully. You should allocate time
for the skits on the agenda and be clear about the purpose of the skits. For
example, the facilitator could say to the creative team: “We’re going to do
several skits in order to get deeper into the customer experience. After each
skit, we’ll brainstorm ideas that would be appropriate solutions for the cus-
tomers in the skit situation.”
The facilitator(s) reviews the customer information and chooses several situ-
ations and key customers to design the skits around. Plan for a range of
topics. For example, for a farmer who needs to repair his own farm equip-
ment, you could present a difficult problem or breakdown, a situation in
which the farmer is successful in solving the problem, and a situation that
shows a pretty typical event in his life. The characters could be the farmer,
the hired hand, the farmer’s son, the neighbor, and the repairmen who will be
out of a job after you develop all these great solutions!
112
Part II: Charting the Ocean of Opportunities for New Products 

For each skit, you need to write a plot. This process actually is pretty simple.
Each skit needs a beginning, a middle, and an end. You let your actors know
what’s happening, what issue or crisis happens next, and how they resolve
the issue. You don’t need to tell the actors everything — part of the fun is
how the actors respond to what you prepare for them. However, you can’t
leave them with blank pieces of paper and give them writer’s block, either.
Print the play list (the list of characters) and the plot on a piece of paper. Use
at least 14-point font so that team members don’t have to scurry for their
glasses. As you assign the skits, hand one sheet to each of the groups.
You may want to add a few minutes to a session break, during which your
actors can discuss their skits. They should feel free to develop the characters
and the situation from their own knowledge of the customers. Instruct them
to use any materials in the room to set up their scene, props, and costumes.
You may see your room transformed into a ranch, a living room, or the inte-
rior of a car dealership or factory.
You can do all the prepared skits at once, or you can space them as energy
boosters when needed — for instance, after the team has eaten a bit too
much lunch! Each skit should last only about three to five minutes. After each
skit, give the actors a hearty round of applause and then hold a brainstorm-
ing session so that the team can capture any new ideas inspired by the skit.
We suggest preparing three skits. A group often can’t get into just one or two.
If you assign more than three, the team may start to get bored. And with
three, you usually can give each member a role so that no one feels left out.
Building a rough concept model
Building a rough model of an idea or concept helps to flesh out the idea and
can help the team see new ways to improve it. We’re not talking about proto-
typing here; we’re talking about using bits and pieces of “stuff” to create a
first rough model of the idea or concept (for information on prototyping, see
Chapters 9, 14, and 17). Drawings of ideas are great, too, but the three-dimen-
sionality and the humor in people’s models provide both serious and light
input to the process.
Chris Miller, the founder of Innovation Focus and a past PDMA president, is
one of the “deans” of creative ideation in new product development. He car-
ries cases of pipecleaners with him wherever he goes. Give your team mem-
bers some pipecleaners and see what they can come up with!
Even better, give your team several tables full of various materials that team
members can fashion into different scenes and models. Co-author Beebe col-
lects assortments of “useless stuff.” She buys paper cups, pipe cleaners, and
113
Chapter 5: Turning Your Company into an Idea Factory

toothpicks. She also visits the Children’s Museum in Boston to buy recycled
“stuff.” Craft stores are great sources of “stuff.” Pasta makes for a great build-
ing material. Beebe once brought dried peat pots to a session, and the teams
found plenty of ways to use them. We find that the less the “stuff” resembles
anything complete, the more fun teams can have building their models — and
doing so creatively.
When collecting your “stuff,” be sure to include the following items:
 Material that can form the base of a completed model — pieces of card-
board, for example
 Material that will make other objects stick together — glue works, as do
toothpicks, paper clips, and tape
 Scissors
Divide the creative team into groups of three or four, and give each group a set
of materials and a space to work in, as well as a set of clear instructions. For
example, you can say, “Build your vision of the perfect product for fly-fishing,”
or “Build a model that shows your vision of how people will get to work in the
future.” Give the groups about ten minutes to work with the materials.
We suggest that you ask the groups not to talk while they’re working on their
models, and that they not write much, if anything, on their models. Talking and
writing tend to push people to think and judge rather than react and create.
When time is up, give the groups a couple of minutes to talk about what
they’ve done and to prepare to share their creations with the rest of the
team. Have all the groups walk around the room to look at each other’s cre-
ations; the groups should gather at each “station” to hear the creators of that
model present their thoughts and motivations behind the model.
After all models have been shared, you can run a brainstorming session to
create ideas that the activity may have inspired.
Even if you don’t have time in your creative session to do the full model exer-
cise, it’s beneficial to have the materials and the models in the room to create
an atmosphere of playfullness and fun. People enjoy holding, manipulating,
and creating with the materials, even if you don’t tell them to do so. Crayons
are a particular favorite to bring out the child in adults! And pipe cleaners
provide an easy way for people to build 3-D models quietly and without mess.

Picking Winners
and Losing Losers
In This Chapter
 Filtering your product options with an Idea Screen
 Taking your ideas to the next level
 Finding value even in the “losing” product ideas
I
magine a small company that’s known for being innovative. It has enough
product development resources to work on only one major initiative at a
time. The company puts all its energies into developing and launching a
single new product.
After the company launches each product, the CEO suggests another project
he has in mind, and his employees all go to work on the new initiative.
Sometimes his ideas fail, and the company has to return to square one. The
CEO starts to get frustrated because his employees aren’t helping to come up
with new ideas. He decides to send out teams to visit customers (see Chapter 4)
and to run idea generation sessions (see Chapter 5). The teams come up with
plenty of ideas for products, and the company puts each idea through an Idea
Screen. Some of the ideas look like great opportunities, some look so-so, and
some appear to be losers.
Take a look at the Cheat Sheet at the front of the book to understand how the
strategies implemented by the CEO have changed the company’s approach to
developing new products. Now it can choose from many different options in
the ocean of opportunity. It can balance its product delivery pipeline. At any
one time, the company’s river of development has large and small projects,
risky and safe ones, and projects that address gaps in the company’s product
lines. The product developers are able to make the best use of the company’s
resources and maintain a clear vision of what the next big initiative will be.

We hope that as you explore the ocean of opportunities out there, you dis-
cover too many ideas for products that you want your company to develop. 
If you have too many opportunities, you can be picky about what goes into your
product development pipeline. If you don’t have a good supply of ideas, you
may have to put so-so projects into the development funnel just to keep your
product developers busy. In this chapter, we show you how to put the ideas
you come up with through an Idea Screen so you end up with the best product
development options.
The amount of money you spend and the resources required during the
screening process are minimal. However, the further an idea travels down the
river of development, the more resources it requires. It’s important to weed
out the weak ideas and to cancel weak projects, or projects that don’t fit your
company’s strategy, before you spend too much on them.
Screening Your Ideas and
Developing New Concepts
We hope you come up with plenty of ideas for products. We also hope that
many of your ideas are cockeyed or impossible, or incompatible with your
business. No, we’re not being sadists. What we’re saying is that when you
come up with ideas, you should be creative and open-minded. If you try to
get it right the first time, you’ll get it wrong — that is, you’ll stay too close to
home and be too conservative. When you brainstorm with an open mind, you
give your company a chance to come up with a great idea that changes your
industry, your business, or the way your customers do their jobs. (Take a
look at Chapter 5 to find out more about being creative and open-minded
when brainstorming ideas for new products.)
After you’ve come up with bunches of ideas, you have to screen all these
ideas and pick a small handful to pass on to the executive team, whose job it
is to make the decisions about which new projects to fund. You want to make
the executives’ jobs easier by screening the ideas, turning the best ideas into
concepts, and giving the executives the ones that look the most promising.
(For more information about how NPD decisions get made, head to the chap-
ters in Part III — Chapters 9, 11, and 12 in particular.)
In the following sections, we explain how to screen your initial ideas, using an
Idea Form to help identify the best ones. We then show you how portfolio
views of these ideas can help you select a varied group of the most promising
ideas to turn into Concept Briefs. The Concept Briefs give decision makers
enough information to decide which concepts should be passed into the river
of development.
116
Part II: Charting the Ocean of Opportunities for New Products 

It works best when the team that comes up with the ideas sticks with them
through the Idea Screen. The people on the team are familiar with the ideas,
so they can do a good job of describing their strengths and weaknesses.
Adding a few others to make sure you have diversity of experience and points
of view is also a good idea. Also, when the team stays with its own ideas, the
ideas are less likely to get lost in the shuffle. Many companies have plenty of
ideas floating around with no champions to support them and no processes
(or, at best, haphazard ones) for getting them in front of executives.
The more consistent your decision-making format, the better your company’s
decisions will be. It’s a small but important task to develop a “language” for
coding information. For example, your company can create similar portfolio
maps for every portfolio exercise, and you can use the same forms for logging
ideas and concepts. When you’re consistent, you don’t have to try to figure
out how to compare the results of one idea generation session with another.
The comparison is obvious because all the teams use the same formats.
Narrowing the field with an Idea Screen
After each idea-generation session that your company conducts, or whenever
you collect a number of ideas for new products, you can hold an idea screen-
ing session so that your company can focus on the most important ideas. We
often include the screening process we describe here as part of the schedule
for generating ideas. That way, a team can review its ideas while they’re still
fresh in their minds, and its members can be sure that the job won’t get
pushed aside and left undone.
An Idea Screen consists of three steps:
1. Describe the ideas.
2. Select the winning ideas.
3. Create an idea portfolio to display the winning ideas.
After completing these three steps, an NPD team will select several of the
ideas and write up Concept Briefs for them. You could call that the fourth
step of the Idea Screen.

Chapter 6: Picking Winners and Losing Losers
Riding through Harley-Davidson’s Wall of Fire
Harley-Davidson, the premier U.S. manufac-
turer of motorcycles, calls the ocean of product
development opportunities “The Swirl,” and it
calls its Idea Screen “The Wall of Fire.” You can
guess that product ideas don’t pass easily into
the development pipeline at Harley!

Step 1: Describe the ideas
For the first step of the process, the team meets to log the ideas and get a
rough idea of which ones should be carried forward. Here are the steps:
1. Divide the ideas among the team members.
2. Distribute and fill out one Idea Form per idea.
3. Post the completed Idea Forms on the meeting room walls.
4. Give each team member a chance to read through all the Idea Forms.
The completed Idea Form provides a record of the idea that your company
can use in making the next decisions about what to do with it. Figure 6-1
shows a completed Idea Form. Team members included enough information
so that the people who weren’t in on the idea generation and screening ses-
sions could understand the ideas.
The Idea Form should be simple. Don’t ask for too much detail at this stage in
the development process because, honestly, you don’t know very much yet,
and you don’t want to spend a lot of time and effort researching ideas that
may not make it to the next stage. Don’t kill off your ideas with too much for-
mality, and don’t ask for precision that goes beyond the data you already
have or can gather easily.
We recommend that you keep all these forms on file. You may want to go back
to an idea that didn’t seem so great at one time and rework it into a compelling
concept. Maybe your group had an idea that was before its time — the technol-
ogy wasn’t available, or the world wasn’t ready yet, for instance.
Step 2: Select the best ideas
The second step is to ask the team members to “vote” for the ideas they
think the company should investigate further. Members vote by placing a
check mark or a dot on the Idea Forms they like.
Remind team members to vote for ideas that they think will appeal to cus-
tomers (even customers who may not yet be part of the company’s market)
and that are technically feasible. Remind them that it’s okay if an idea doesn’t
fit with the company’s existing business as long as they think that someone
could develop the idea into a successful product.
You don’t want to use rigorous criteria at this point. It’s sufficient to get rid of
some of the weaker ideas that the team came up with. Wait until you have a
chance to review all the ideas together — during the portfolio step — before
eliminating too many of them. Some ideas will drop out because no one will
vote for them. For example, in a recent session of ours, someone had the idea
of sending all the garbage to the moon. No one voted to carry that idea for-
ward! Some ideas, on the other hand, will be obvious “winners” and will get
plenty of votes.
118
Part II: Charting the Ocean of Opportunities for New Products 

After voting, the team should discuss the “maybes.” This discussion will help
clarify the ideas and identify their strengths and weaknesses. After this dis-
cussion, the team may decide to drop out some more of the ideas.
We recommend that the team retain any idea that any team member strongly
favors. Hunches often turn into the best concepts.
Step 3: Create an idea portfolio to display the winning ideas
After you review all the available ideas and eliminate the ones that don’t look
promising, you can create an idea portfolio with your team. An idea portfolio
shows how the ideas you’ve selected fit with different criteria that are impor-
tant to the company.

Chapter 6: Picking Winners and Losing Losers

The collection of new products that the company plans to develop should
represent a diversity of size, risk, market focus, product line, and so on.
Without the portfolio view, decision makers are likely to settle for a more lim-
ited range of projects. For example, they may choose all sure bets or all prod-
ucts that focus on markets with which they’re familiar. The idea portfolio
shows the decision makers at a glance how the ideas range across several
important dimensions.
To create an idea portfolio, follow these steps:
1. List several portfolio criteria. Portfolio criteria relate to your com-
pany’s overall product strategy. Here are some criteria that companies
often use:
• Market: New markets versus existing markets
• Technology: New technologies versus existing technologies
• Product type: Incremental improvements versus product plat-
forms versus unique/radical projects
2. Tape a large sheet of paper on the wall and draw the portfolio dimen-
sions. (See Figure 6-2 for an example.)
3. Ask team members to write each idea that passed the Idea Screen (see
the previous section) on a sticky note.
4. Paste each note onto the appropriate position on the portfolio.
The ideas also may fall into other categories — for instance, which prod-
uct lines or businesses they belong to or which markets they serve.
Team members might use different color ink or different color sticky
notes to represent other categories.
Figure 6-2 shows a sample idea portfolio.

Part II: Charting the Ocean of Opportunities for New Products 

The team that created this portfolio used market and technology newness to
form the dimensions. They indicate product types — improvements, plat-
forms, and so on — by the placement of each idea: The lower-right corner rep-
resents product improvements, the middle includes next-generation products
and platforms, and the upper-left corner shows unique or radical products.
In this map, the team used different card suits to indicate different product
lines the ideas related to. Two of the ideas will improve the “spade” product
line; the team has come up with a new technology to serve an existing “heart”
market; and they’ve got two ideas to make some fairly radical extensions to
the “diamond” product line. Looks like they’ve also come up with a whole
new line, “clubs,” which includes a platform idea and an idea for a radical new
technology.
Note: A “real” idea portfolio would include many more ideas; Figure 6-2 looks
more like the portfolio you might end up with after the team has selected a
few of the ideas to turn into concepts (see next section).
Turning winning ideas into concepts
With your team’s idea portfolio on hand to refer to, your next job is to select a
handful of ideas that the team will turn into concepts for your executives to
review. Usually, a team chooses a range of ideas, from incremental to platform
to radical. Your team should also take into account any other dimensions that
add diversity to the ideas they choose — for example, which market the idea
relates to or which product line it would be a part of. A simple process for
making these decisions is to ask the team members to vote for ones they want
to keep. Usually, a handful are obvious keepers and a handful are obvious
losers. The team can debate the others and come to a final tally.
If any one team member feels strongly about keeping an idea, keep it. She
may be seeing something the rest of the team just can’t see.
Now you’re ready to write up Concept Briefs for the winning ideas. A Concept
Brief has more information than the Idea Forms you use to do the initial
screening. It provides estimates and descriptions of many factors, including
 Market opportunity
 Technology
 Financial cost and return
The information in a Concept Brief gives decision makers a way to judge
whether a concept is worth spending scarce resources on. Your team should
meet to fill out the briefs for the ideas you’ve chosen. You can complete some
of the briefs on the spot, but some may require homework.
121
Chapter 6: Picking Winners and Losing Losers

See Figure 6-3 and the following list for guidance in creating your own
Concept Briefs. The figure gives an example of a Concept Brief in outline
form, and the list presents the main topics of the brief.
 Opportunity Definition and Value Proposition: Begin by giving a brief
description of the concept and explain why it represents an opportunity
for the company. You’ll go into more detail later on; here, you just want
to provide an overview. For example, a team working on wireless com-
munications could say, “To develop a cellphone that meets customer
needs for fewer dropped calls. This product would enhance product line
X and serve a growing market of XX million cellphone users worldwide.”
You can also include important limiting conditions — for example, “This
product must be introduced by Q4 2007 to beat competitor entries into
the market.”
The Value Proposition is a short statement that explains what value the
concept will deliver, both to customers and to the company. The propo-
sition answers the following questions:

• “Why would customers find this product attractive enough to pur-
chase it?”
• “How can the company develop, produce, and market this product
in a way that aligns with its innovation strategy and provides an
attractive return on the investment?”
A clearly written Value Proposition serves as a beacon for the team as it
moves into the actual work of developing the product.
 Opportunity Assessment: You should describe the market opportunity
the concept affords. The assessment should include your estimate of the
market size, the predicted market growth, and the opportunity to take
share or further penetrate the market. You also can indicate the exis-
tence of competitive products and assess how the concept will be able
to compete against them.
 Market Overview: Answer the following questions:
• What identified customer needs will this product satisfy (see
Chapter 4)?
• Who are the expected customers for this concept?
 Technology Overview: Answer the following questions:
• Can the concept be developed with currently available technology?
• What’s the extent of technology development needed?
• What are the potential technology hurdles and technology risks?
 Strategic Fit: How will the concept contribute to meeting the company’s
strategic business objectives (see Chapter 3)? Here, you describe the
concept’s fit with the following:
• Product lines
• Brand strategy
• Growth objectives
• Any other dimensions of your company’s strategic objectives
Improving Your Concepts with
Quality Function Deployment
You have one more trick up your team’s sleeve that you can use to improve a
concept and narrow the field for the decision makers at your company. The
technique is called Quality Function Deployment, or QFD. Stuart Pugh came up
with the specific process we use here.
123
Chapter 6: Picking Winners and Losing Losers

QFD is a term that refers to the practice of using a matrix to match customer
needs with concept functionality. It comes out of the quality movement, or
Total Quality Management (TQM). This may sound confusing, but the process
can be quite useful. We’ll give you the nuggets from the alphabet soup!
The following list explains how you can use QFD, and Pugh’s process in par-
ticular, to improve your concepts before submitting them to decision makers:
1. Set aside a day or more to do this work.
2. Set up the meeting room with your teamwork supplies: large wall
charts, a ruler for drawing, sticky notes, felt-tip pens, and tape.
3. Select groups of concepts that focus on similar customer needs (see
Section 3 of the Concept Brief in Figure 6-3).
4. Make a two-dimensional matrix and draw in the columns and rows.
You’ll write the customer requirements along the Y-axis (the vertical line
on the left side), assigning one requirement per row, and then put the
concepts along the X-axis, assigning one concept per column.
You can use a catchy name, a cartoon or sketch, or any other moniker to
help your team remember which concept you’re working with. Just don’t
use more than ten or so requirements, and focus on fewer than eight
concepts.
5. In the first column of the matrix, enter a concept or product that
already exists in the market and does a pretty good job of meeting
this set of customer requirements.
The product may be yours, or it may be a competitor’s. This concept
will be your point of reference.
6. Choose symbols that represent “better,” “worse,” and “same.”
The numbers 1, 2, and 3 will do, but you can use more meaningful sym-
bols, such as smiley, frown, and neutral faces. These are more fun and
help keep the team interested.
7. Fill in each of the squares (formed by the rows and columns) with a
symbol that shows whether the concept does a better, worse, or simi-
lar job as the reference concept with regard to the customer require-
ment in the row.
Hold an open discussion to come up with the team’s consensus on each
of the judgments. Make note of any disagreements and other potentially
useful information that comes up during the discussion.
Now you have a completed matrix that shows how well, in your team’s
judgment, each concept meets each of the customer requirements.
Now’s the time to improve the concepts.
124
Part II: Charting the Ocean of Opportunities for New Products 

8. Strengthen each concept by stealing bits and pieces from other
concepts.
For example, if Concept A meets five requirements well and looks like a
winner, can you make it even better by creating a hybrid A/D Concept?
Can you blend in a bit of E and G?
9. Select the best concepts.
You’ll need to write up new Concept Briefs for the hybrid, improved
concepts. Now you have a smaller number of better concepts to pass
along to your executives.
We think you’ll be very pleased at how much you can improve your concepts
with QFD. As a bonus, you also can eliminate some concepts that you thought
were okay. With this work, you set up your executives to make even better
choices about what will go into your company’s product development pipeline.
Turning Losing Concepts into Assets
Just because an idea for a new product project gets dropped onto the cutting
room floor doesn’t mean that it has no value. A good idea may not work for
your company because you don’t have the technology capability. Or perhaps
the project seems risky, and your organization already has too much invested
in risk and not enough in sure bets. In other cases, a good idea may not fit
your company’s business model — the way it goes about making money (see
Chapters 3 and 12).
Before you dump an idea, examine it to see whether it deserves some kind of
special attention. Smart companies always look for ways to turn their
rejected options into valuable assets. The following list presents some
options you may explore:
 Some companies assign employees to look for ways to create value from
technology developments that the organizations won’t use. For example,
if the company patents its technologies, it can sell or license them, and
the company profits from the royalties.
 Some ideas are big and bold enough to warrant the creation of new busi-
ness units if they don’t fit existing business models. Questioning and
expanding a company’s business models is becoming more and more
important in this age of open innovation (see Chapter 16).
 If your company can’t pursue a promising opportunity within your exist-
ing business model, you may decide to allow employees to launch a new
business with the idea as the focus.
 You can offer “losing” concepts on Web sites that allow inventors and
companies to search for different patents, ideas, and technologies.

Chapter 6: Picking Winners and Losing Losers

126
Part II: Charting the Ocean of Opportunities for New Products 
A tip for entrepreneurs
You may have only two or three great ideas, but
you may be able to develop only one or two. You
should ask yourself, can I get needed funding by
selling or licensing one or more of my good
ideas? Larger companies may be anxious to
acquire the technologies that they need. The
trick is to understand the needs of larger com-
panies (try visiting them — see Chapter 4) and
to present your technology in a way that helps
them connect your solution with their needs.
However, before you sell or license your ideas
and technologies, be sure that you consider
which concept could turn out to be valuable to
you in the future. Don’t be so excited to turn a
profit that you give away next year’s, or next
decade’s, blockbuster.

In This Chapter

 Familiarizing yourself with the tools of inventorying
 Relating technology to products and markets
 Forming a technology agenda
T
echnology, broadly defined, is what enables companies to develop prod-
ucts that meet customer needs. The technology in your company includes
the output of research and scientific development, as well as the process and
manufacturing knowledge that helps you produce products and develop serv-
ices for your customers. More and more in today’s business world, partners and
suppliers also provide the technology that product developers need. Technol-
ogy is important insofar as it helps your organization to be successful in the
business you’re in.
In this chapter, we show you how to inventory your organization’s technol-
ogy capabilities. With this inventory, you can accomplish a number of things:
 You can link technology to products that you want to develop and to the
market needs that you’ve identified (see Chapter 4) so that your technol-
ogy contributes to your organization’s success.
 You can identify what technology you’ll need for products and markets
in the future so that your technology development has a strategic focus.
 You can decide what you don’t have to develop within your company so
that you can take advantage of partners and suppliers (see Chapters 15
and 16).
Rich Albright and co-author Beebe Nelson developed most of the examples
we use in this chapter for their chapter on technology mapping in the PDMA
ToolBook2 (Wiley). Take a look at that chapter if you want to get deeper into
this topic.

Recognizing the Importance of
Inventorying Your Technology
“You know what keeps me up at night?” asked the Chief Technical Officer
(CTO) of a successful mid-size company. “Wondering if the problem that one
guy is working on could be solved by something the guy on the next bench
has already done.” Even in small companies, it isn’t uncommon for executives
and managers to be unsure of their organizations’ technology capabilities.
If, as an organization, you’ve never sat down to make a list of your technology
capabilities, we’re willing to bet that your decision makers and tech special-
ists don’t know the full scope. One person understands how fans work,
another in another area of the company is an expert in wiring, and a third has
world-class expertise in plastic molding. What might these specialists be able
to do if they could talk to each other? You won’t know if you separate them
with the walls of culture, habit, workload, and functional orientation.
When knowledge of technology capabilities is fragmented, it stays within
small groups of people or even in individuals’ heads. Your organization can
miss opportunities to develop new products. Even worse, the people with the
knowledge can walk out the door and into the arms of your competitors.
So, if sharing technology knowledge within a company is so important, why
don’t all companies inventory their technology capabilities? Here are a
couple reasons:
 It never occurred to them. When people are doing their jobs and no one
sees any obvious breakdowns, companies don’t realize that something
may be missing.
 They don’t think they need to. If employees have the know-how, the
jobs get done. You have to exert extra effort to get them to share their
knowledge, and many people believe they’re too busy to do that.
To help you get motivated to inventory your technology, here are several rea-
sons why you should make this activity a priority:
 You may already have a solution you’ve been searching for — a solution
that would allow you to get a great new product to market in half the
time you thought it would take.
 You may lose tacit knowledge — knowledge that hasn’t been widely
shared — when employees retire or leave.
 You may have technology solutions you could turn into unexpected
product advantages — for example, ways to make a product lighter or a
way to cut packaging or manufacturing costs.
128
Part II: Charting the Ocean of Opportunities for New Products 

 You can plan strategically for technology development and focus your
technology resources instead of being at the mercy of ad hoc and arbi-
trary decisions.
 You’ll know what to develop inside your company and what you can
partner on with outside sources (see Chapters 15 and 16).
Whether you share your technology capabilities with seven others in a start-
up company, with several hundred associates, or with people across multiple
business units in huge companies (such as 3M or Intel), making your capabili-
ties more explicit will make them more useful. When you inventory your tech-
nology, the people in your company will be better able to communicate
 Among technical employees.
 Among technical employees and marketers.
 Among business units, managers, and executives.
 With partners and suppliers.
Surveying Ways to Inventory 
Your Technology
Before taking inventory of your technology, you probably have more ques-
tions than an IRS investigator (which is what brings you to us!). What tech-
nology do you have? How does it connect to market and customer needs?
How can you use it to develop new products or improve existing ones? How
is the technology in your field evolving? What changes will make your tech-
nology obsolete or enable radical innovation? These are just some of the
questions that you can address with a technology inventory. In this section,
we show you two ways to inventory your technology: spider charts and tech-
nology roadmaps. Spider charts depict the gap between how good a product
could or should be and how good your products and technologies are right
now. Roadmaps add the explicit dimension of time. They show what tech-
nologies and products you can develop right now and what will be possible
in the future.
The good news? Both ways of inventorying technology are simple to under-
stand and implement. Executives, functional managers, and NPD teams can
use them to record information, support decision-making, and communicate
with each other. They include information from different functions — at a
minimum, from both research and development (R&D) and marketing. In the
process of building the charts and maps, members of different functions can
question each other so that the information is accessible to people with dif-
ferent experiences and knowledge.
129
Chapter 7: Making the Most of Technology

You’ll use spider charts and technology roadmaps to create a visual record of
today’s technology inventory and your plans for tomorrow. The fact that the
tools are visual — a picture or a map — means that you can see relationships
between different elements and that several people can share the informa-
tion, discuss it, question it, understand it, and use it to make decisions.
Spider charts
A spider chart lets a company compare its product and technology features to
its competitors’ and to what its customers would like. Companies and teams
use spider charts to document how well their technologies meet customer
requirements.
Spider charts are also known as figures of merit or radar charts, but most
people call them spider charts because they look like spider webs.
Follow these steps to build a spider chart:
1. Assemble a group of technical and marketing employees and agree on
important customer requirements.
Most spider charts depict eight requirements. Our spider chart in Figure
7-1 shows customer requirements for family cars: handling, fuel efficiency,
performance, comfort, safety, durability, styling, and interior space.
If the NPD team has conducted a customer visit project (see Chapter 4),
it will know precisely what’s important to customers — in the cus-
tomers’ own voice.
2. Use the customer requirements to create and name the arms of 
the chart.
The dimensions of an arm represent the figure of merit — how good the
customer requirement could get. The outside circle we’ve drawn shows
the “theoretical limit” of the requirement. For example, the number of
miles per gallon (fuel efficiency) could be set at 50 mpg — a quantitative
representation. The “softer” requirements, such as comfort, should be
defined with qualitative measures.
3. Put a hash mark on each arm to show how well the industry’s cur-
rent products and technologies deliver on each of the customer
requirements.
A hash mark placed close to the outside indicates that technology can
deliver what the customers want; a hash mark placed closer to the
center indicates that companies in the industry still have some way to
go. Connect the hash marks — we’ve used a solid line and labeled it
“Industry standard.”
130
Part II: Charting the Ocean of Opportunities for New Products 

4. Put another hash mark on each arm to show how well your technolo-
gies and products deliver against customer requirements, and connect
these marks with another line.
In the example, we use a dashed line to represent how well your com-
pany’s technologies and products deliver against customer requirements.
The gap between the dashed line (your products and technologies) and
the solid line (the industry’s standard products and technologies) shows
what you need to do — and what you’ve done — to be competitive.
In our example in Figure 7-1, your company is beating industry stan-
dards for comfort. You’re giving up a bit on performance. Safety and fuel
efficiency are both better than the industry. Looks like a great family car!
You also can add hash marks and lines that show how well specific competi-
tors can meet the customer requirements. This helps you to focus your tech-
nology efforts. For example, Ford may be much more interested in how well
Chrysler is doing than in how well Toyota or BMW is doing.

Chapter 7: Making the Most of Technology

When a company or industry makes a radical improvement, the dimensions of
the spider chart change. For example, in the face of rising oil prices and com-
petition from alternative technologies, automobile manufacturers had to come
to the realization that what was acceptable gas mileage in the past no longer
satisfied many of their customers. As customer expectations change, technol-
ogy must try to meet the challenge and deliver what the customers want.
You have multiple formats in which you can create your spider chart. We like
to start by drawing the chart on a large sheet of paper taped to a wall or dis-
played on a flip chart. This setup allows groups to work together as they con-
struct the chart. To preserve the chart and communicate it in digital form,
you also can try building it in Microsoft Excel.
Technology roadmaps
Technology roadmaps allow your organization to identify the technology it
has now and how that technology may evolve. It also provides a template for
linking technology to products and markets. Unlike spider charts (see the
previous section), technology roadmaps include an explicit time dimension.
You should have cross-functional teams build technology roadmaps (see
Chapter 10 for more on cross-functional teams). The best maps include knowl-
edge from different parts of the company. When cross-functional teams update
the roadmaps over time, they turn them into repositories for a corporation’s
knowledge and a key element in strategic and tactical planning. Technology
roadmaps are often used to make short-term, tactical decisions. The good thing
is that they also provide the strategic context within which tactical decisions
are made.
132
Part II: Charting the Ocean of Opportunities for New Products 
Watching technology evolve
Sometimes companies use spider charts over
years and even decades to show how well 
they — or even entire industries — meet cus-
tomer needs. Many years ago, the manufactur-
ers of television sets knew that their customers
wanted more brightness and contrast and
sharper colors. The industry worked to improve
these dimensions. Companies also knew that
customers wanted flat screens. Manufacturers
made incremental improvements from one year
to the next, but it took a technology break-
through for them to create the flat-screen TV
that we know today. Spider charts provided the
constant reminder that the industry hadn’t yet
accomplished all its goals.

General roadmapping steps
Your organization needs to take the following actions to make sure that your
technology roadmapping efforts are successful:
 Identify the projects, products, platforms, or technologies to roadmap.
 Secure management’s support. Management will both sponsor and
review the team’s work.
 Assemble the cross-functional team who will build the map. Select
team members who have a diversity of experience as well as expertise
with the roadmap topics.
 Identify the roadmap owner. Each roadmap should have a person des-
ignated as the “owner.” He or she is the go-to person for questions, and
is responsible for keeping an eye out for changes in technology or
market and for scheduling reviews when the map needs to be updated
(see Chapter 12 for more on reviews).
The roadmap owner is usually an executive or director who has interest
in and is committed to the team’s work. The owner may participate on
the team, or he or she may be a member of the management support
group.
 Schedule a series of sessions, with time between sessions for home-
work. We find it works best to schedule four or five sessions, each 
one a week apart. Each session should have at least two uninterrupted
hours. This schedule allows time for homework and reflection, but the
project doesn’t take too long. You want employees to be ready and will-
ing to take on another project, so be reasonable with the time/work
requirements.
 Identify technology building blocks. We describe a method for execut-
ing this step in the following section.
 Draw the first map, placing the building blocks in a timeline. See the
section “Drafting your first roadmap” later in this chapter.
 Review and revise the draft of your map. Review the map with mem-
bers of management to get their input. We recommend that you also
share the map with customers, suppliers, and other stakeholders to get
many types of opinions and input. Be sure to remove or disguise sensi-
tive information when you share maps with outside people.
The more audiences you review your map with, the more information you
can include. Also, when groups participate in map review, they develop a
commitment to and agreement with the map, which encourages people to
make use of it.

Chapter 7: Making the Most of Technology

You’ve built a map, but your mapmaking job isn’t over. Technology changes,
markets change, and you always strive to uncover new information. A critical
part of good technology mapmaking is to schedule regular review meetings
to revise your maps and to call special meetings when unexpected changes
occur.
Mapping your technology building blocks
Technology building blocks are the technical capabilities that enable your com-
pany to develop and maintain products, and they’re vital parts of the technol-
ogy roadmap. For example, the technology building blocks of a chocolate man-
ufacturer would include the know-how and processes that enable melting,
mixing, forming, coloring, and flavoring, as well as packaging. Some of these
building blocks would be unique to the individual candy company and give it
its unique flavor, so to speak, and some would be common to the industry.
Here are the steps you follow to identify and map the technology building
blocks you’ll use to draft the technology roadmap. We illustrate each step with
an example from the HVAC (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning) industry:
1. Select the focus of your building-block map.
The team’s job is to list and map the technology building blocks for its
furnace and air conditioner platforms.
2. List all the technologies and capabilities in the area you’re studying.
In our example, we include fans, heaters, and coolers — the basic build-
ing blocks needed for the HVAC products.
3. Assess any gaps in your collective knowledge and assign homework
before the next meeting.
The HVAC team needed to do more research between meetings, so it
divided into research pairs. The areas that needed the most work were
user interface and software for each of the platforms, although the team
had some questions in almost every area.
4. At the team’s next meeting, add any technologies and capabilities 
that turned up in the homework. Eliminate from consideration dupli-
cates and technologies or capabilities that aren’t relevant to the area
you’re working on, and be sure to clarify any questions that arise
within the group.
Up to this point, you’re bringing as much to the table as possible. Now you
have to narrow down so that your map focuses on the area you’re respon-
sible for. The HVAC team found all sorts of neat stuff about user interface
but decided to include only a bit of it. The members discussed some of the
issues they uncovered in the area of fan technology and came to an agree-
ment about which building blocks were most important in that area.
134
Part II: Charting the Ocean of Opportunities for New Products 

5. Write the remaining technologies on sticky notes — one technology
per note.
The HVAC team selected 30 technology building blocks that its members
identified as core elements in this technology area.
6. Group similar technologies and make a header for each technology
group.
The team used the grouping that it had started out with and added a
new category for software building blocks. You see it on the chart as
“New Platform” (see Figure 7-2). The team believes that this new plat-
form could provide a competitive edge for its products.
The categories a team starts out with are only first guesses. Sometimes,
as a team explores a field of technology, its members come up with
unexpected connections, and the groups look different from the ones
the team started with.
Figure 7-2 shows a map of the HVAC technology building blocks. Each platform
has similar icons — musical notes for Software, circles for Coolers, and so on —
which shows that the platforms share similar building blocks. However, the
mapping exercise also reveals that some of the platforms use building blocks
that are associated with other platforms. The line that connects Fans with the
first block in the Cooler platform is an example of this. The lines that connect
the platforms with their building blocks suggest which technologies are cur-
rently key to those platforms.

Chapter 7: Making the Most of Technology

After you build the first chart, you can use it to build a technology roadmap.
(Note: The building block chart doesn’t include a timeline; that enters the
picture when you get to roadmapping.)
Some companies expand their building block charts to show which technolo-
gies are most important to fulfilling customer needs, which technologies they
possess in-house, and which they plan to develop. In this way, a chart can
lead to a technology action plan.
Drafting your first roadmap
The technology building blocks are the ingredients you need to draft your
first technology roadmap. In the following steps, we show you how the draft-
ing works, and we illustrate the steps by looking at a roadmap of possible
technologies for a car engine (shown in Figure 7-3).
Co-author Beebe Nelson and Richard Albright created this roadmap illustra-
tion for The PDMA ToolBook2 (Wiley). In this fictitious example, the key
driver for the planning effort is the engine manufacturer’s concern over new
fuel technologies. Senior management charged a team with coming up with
technology plans to address the changing landscape.
To prepare for the first roadmap team meeting, hang a couple of pages of 2'-x-3'
paper on the wall. You also need a ruler (if you’re picky about straight lines),
some felt-tip pens, and plenty of sticky notes.
1. Decide on a time frame for your roadmap, and divide the map into
columns that depict equal lengths of time.
You can use your ruler to make the columns equal. Technology roadmaps
always include a time dimension, and time generally runs from left to

right. In the engine map in Figure 7-3, you see dates written at the top
that run from 2005 to 2014. The mapmakers have also left room for
“Future Vision” — what may happen after 2014.
Be aware of your industry when you decide on a time frame. If you work
with software or fashion products, your whole map may run less than
five years; if your company develops new drugs, your map will have to
include ten or more years.
2. Divide your technology into subcategories.
You can start with the technology building-block groupings you create
(see the previous section).The engine team has divided the powertrain
into two elements: the engine and the fuel system. The technology in
both of these areas is related, but the division into subgroups allows the
team to get a closer look at the technology the company needs for each.
3. Put your existing and planned technology onto the map.
A good place to start is with the building blocks. Adding the time frame
in the map may lead you to eliminate or add elements.
You can indicate projects that are underway, planned projects, and pro-
jects that are possible but not yet planned. Use different shapes or colors
to denote the different projects. In Figure 7-3, staffed projects have a heavy
line, planned projects have a thinner line, and possible projects not yet
in the company’s plan have an oval.
A company may decide to outsource or partner on some of its technology.
The team indicates this by shading in the bar for those projects. (You can
find out more about outsourcing and partnering in Chapters 15 and 16.)
4. For each technology project, draw a bar that shows how long you
expect the project to take.
Having a clear and explicit map in front of your team and the company’s man-
agement makes real resource planning possible (see Chapter 11 for more on
project resources). You must update the roadmap regularly because it’s a map
of the future and things will change. However, the map provides a basis for
decision-making and accountability that can make a huge difference in your
organization’s ability to focus resources and accomplish the important projects.
Reading and using roadmaps
The company that Figure 7-3 illustrates wants to develop technology that will
allow the organization to respond to increasing pressure to reduce fuel con-
sumption. What can you learn about the company’s technology plans for
accomplishing its goals from the roadmap in Figure 7-3? Until 2007, the com-
pany will focus its technology efforts on increasing the gas mileage of the
internal combustion (IC) engine. Starting in 2006, the company plans to
develop a more efficient IC engine, the “multivalve.” At the same time, the
company plans to develop its hybrid capabilities. It will continue to staff
137
Chapter 7: Making the Most of Technology

research and development of all gasoline technologies until 2009. The company
plans to begin research into fuel-cell technology in 2009. The roadmap shows
that the company plans to complete the work on the new multivalve IC engine
in 2009. It doesn’t expect work on the hybrid to be complete until 2012.
The company’s technology roadmap provides management with an under-
standing of its resource needs now and in the future:
 Management has already staffed the work on IC development — you can
tell that because the outline of the project is heavy.
 Both the projects starting in 2006 are planned but not yet staffed. These
project outlines are thin.
 The projects to develop technology for an electric engine and for the
fuel cell are unplanned. The shaded bar shows that when it comes time
to include the projects in the company’s plan, the company will be look-
ing for a partner to develop the technology with. Because they have a
map, they can start looking for the right one now!
Although the map in Figure 7-3 is in black and white, clever use of shapes and
line thickness allows the company to show plenty of planning detail. You can
use color to add even more. For instance, you could add information about
staffing requirements for each project, as well as detail about the kind of part-
ners the company wants to look for.
Connecting Technology Capabilities 
to Products and Markets
Companies develop and acquire technology so that they can develop new
products that will fulfill customer and market needs. They don’t develop
technology just for fun or to keep their R&D departments busy! Connecting
technology planning to customer and market needs enables your company to
decide just what technologies it needs.
When you embark on a technology research, start by asking yourself some
key questions:
 What are the key drivers in your industry and in your markets?
 How do the drivers relate to your existing agenda for technology devel-
opment (see the later section “Creating an agenda for technology 
development”)?
 Should your technology development agenda look into the future, or is
your research and development (R&D) focused only on short-term
goals?
138
Part II: Charting the Ocean of Opportunities for New Products 

In this section, we look at how you can link your business and technology
agendas and at the same time balance your focus on long- and short-term
projects. The secret is to create maps that link your market and technology
drivers in a time frame that’s appropriate for your industry.
Mapping the strategic geography
The strategic geography is a visual representation of the most important influ-
encers or drivers in a particular market. Corning, Inc., a leader in effective
innovation processes, uses a simple and effective approach called event map-
ping to chart the strategic geography. An event map provides a framework or
context for technology mapmakers. For example, it guides the mapmakers to
think of technologies that they otherwise may have overlooked.
Follow these steps to create an event map:
1. Take a huge sheet of paper, divide it into rows and columns, and label
the left side (the Y-axis) with trends.
For example, you could insert “market/customer/competition,” “eco-
nomic/social,” “legal/regulatory,” and “technology.”
2. Along the bottom of the paper (the X-axis), show the time from left to
right — from a short time ago, to now, to the future.
3. Write down all the relevant drivers you can think of within the cate-
gories you’ve listed on sticky notes, and paste the notes in the appro-
priate spots.
If you create an event map with a diverse group of people, different people
can add their ideas and group members can question each other for elabora-
tion. We recommend that you take a break of several days between sessions
so that people can digest, reflect, and do some homework before you com-
plete the map. Like technology roadmaps (see the earlier section
“Technology roadmaps”), maps of strategic drivers are most valuable if you
update them over time.
What would an event map look like for the food industry in the United States,
for example? Here’s a list of some of the shifts and changes in the food market:
 Customer/market trends:
• Americans are both more obese and more health-conscious.
• Americans often eat on the run.
• We still believe in fad diets. Which one is it this month?
• Consumers want convenience and health in the same product.
• Global producers are entering the U.S. market at an increasing rate.
139
Chapter 7: Making the Most of Technology

 Social trends:
• The list of ingredients considered either dangerous or desirable is
growing.
• There’s growing concern about how and where producers grow
foods, leading to increased demand for organic and locally grown
produce.
 Legal/regulatory: Federal regulations are making increasing demands
on growers and producers to use safe ingredients and to label foods.
 Technology trends: Food packaging and processing are becoming more
sophisticated.
What a bunch of contradictory drivers! One advantage of a sticky-note process
(see Step 3 of the previous list) is that you can capture all the contradictions,
each one on its own note. You don’t have to resolve the contradictions. For
example, have you noticed that many food companies produce both healthy
and “sinful” brands of the same product types? When you’re developing tech-
nologies, you may find solutions that address several of the issues, and some-
times you have to go with only one.
Mapping product/technology evolution
Combining technology roadmaps (see the section “Technology roadmaps”)
with product line maps helps forge a link between your new product planning
and your technology development plans.
You may think it’s obvious that you should have technology ready when you
need it to develop a new product, but you can easily get involved in the rush
of developing a product without having a clear idea of the technology you
need. You get there and say, “Oops, I guess now we have to invent something.”
That’s a really bad way to go about introducing a new product into the market!
Creating a visual diagram of how technology will link to potential products in
the market expedites your product development process. It also keeps your
company from spending resources on technology projects that look interest-
ing but don’t clearly link with market/product opportunities. Another good
thing about this kind of mapping is that it lets you see, at a glance, how your
planning shapes up. Before you make a map of your plans, you may think that
everything is just great. When you — and others — can see the planning
process on a big sheet of paper, you can easily identify the gaps, the prob-
lems, and the opportunities.
140
Part II: Charting the Ocean of Opportunities for New Products 

In Chapter 3, we map product lines so a company can see where it may need
new products or product improvements. We use that same mapping process
here to link products and technologies. You place the products you intend to
develop and introduce on a timeline and then add the technologies that you’ll
need in order to develop them. Figure 7-4 shows an example of such a map.
A product/technology map needs to be used, communicated, updated, and
reviewed. If a team makes a map like the one in Figure 7-4 and then puts it in
the closet, the team will just be wasting time and paper. These maps are
made to be dynamic, not set in stone.

Chapter 7: Making the Most of Technology

The following list shows how the company in Figure 7-4 mapped the relation-
ship between technology and products, as well as some interesting details
about its product/technology planning:
 The map represents the product lines supported by two distillation
technologies. We call them “Bubble” and “Squeak.”
 The company decides to break its timeline into three-year chunks. Note:
Every industry has its own timing and rhythms. Charlie Fine of MIT has
referred to this as an industry’s “clockspeed.” Three-year chunks may
work well for the industry featured in Figure 7-4 but not for faster or
slower industries.
 The company’s planning looks fairly balanced. The Squeak technology
seems to focus on fairly significant improvements, including the intro-
duction of a whole new product line.
 It looks like the company may phase out Merlot after 2012. Pinot, to be
introduced in 2009, continues, as does Shiraz.
 The company links each of the technology projects to one or more
planned products or platforms.
A platform allows a company to develop a number of different products,
using the same technology or architecture (see Chapter 3 for more about
platforms).
When companies are in the middle of developing new products and technolo-
gies, they can lose sight of the big picture. A product/technology map helps a
company assess its agenda. Did the company from Figure 7-4 plan to abandon
Merlot, or is that an oversight? Should its researchers be investigating new
technologies, or are they comfortable with this rather conservative agenda?
Developing or Finding the 
Necessary Technology
You need to be sure that the employees who develop new products in your
company work on solutions that are important to your customers. You may
have noticed that many of the products you buy have features and functions
that you’ll never use or that you don’t know how to use. For example, we’ve
never met anyone who actually uses all those buttons on a microwave oven.
We’re not sure anyone even knows what they’re all for or how to use them.
142
Part II: Charting the Ocean of Opportunities for New Products 

Sometimes, product developers add features on purpose. It actually costs
less to include all the stuff on a cellphone and digital camera that your kids
know how to use than it does to make defeatured products for us older folks.
However, the insertion of extra features often occurs because engineers and
researchers who develop technology for the products are more interested in
their own ideas than in what creates value for the customer and returns for
the company. Maybe, in fact, they’ve never even thought about what the cus-
tomer values at all.
People who develop technology — the people in your research and develop-
ment (R&D) department — like to invent new things. They enjoy the techni-
cal challenge of making products better and better. Basically, that’s what you
pay them for, but you need to make sure that they don’t go overboard.
A focused agenda for technology development helps R&D employees stay in
line with what provides the best returns, and it helps the people who manage
R&D employees to judge how well they’re doing what they should be doing. A
focused agenda also allows you to decide what you should develop in-house
and what you may want to acquire from outside partners (see Chapters 15
and 16). We cover technology agendas and outside partnerships in the sec-
tions that follow.
Creating an agenda for technology 
development
Technology roadmaps, product/technology maps, and spider charts (see the
previous sections of this chapter) are all helpful tools for drafting a clear action
summary for your organization’s technology development. But even if you
haven’t had time to do all this mapping, we suggest that you create an agenda
or action summary for technology development. Drafting an agenda literally
puts people on the same page. It pushes you to answer key questions, such
as the following: What will you devote resources to? What information do you
have or are you lacking? What degree of risk are you willing to take on?
The agenda connects management’s decisions with technology develop-
ment projects. The agenda can be updated and revised as you gather new
information.
The following list gives you the steps for creating an agenda, using the spider
chart (Figure 7-1) and the technology roadmap (Figure 7-3) we discuss earlier
in this chapter. Figure 7-5 shows a sample agenda.
143
Chapter 7: Making the Most of Technology

1. Decide what the most important customer needs are for your products
and rank them in order of importance.
The example in Figure 7-1 shows that the car company plans to lead the
industry in fuel efficiency. It plans to lag on performance, excel in comfort,
and stay at parity on handling, interior space, styling, durability, and safety.
Scaling back on some drivers is very hard to do, because we all want to be
the best at everything! But the purpose of an action agenda is to make sure
that you focus resources on the factors that are most important to your busi-
ness’s ability to compete and to create return on new product and technol-
ogy investments.
2. Divide your technology initiatives into reasonable chunks that will
give you the advantage you seek in the most important areas.
The car company focuses its technology resources on the engine and
the fuel system to give itself a chance to lead its industry in fuel effi-
ciency. (Note: The action agenda in Figure 7-5 shows the company’s
plans for this effort; it will prepare separate agendas to focus efforts on
the other areas if needed.)
3. Within your technology initiatives, decide on the technology develop-
ment projects that you must accomplish.
To meet its goals, the car company decides to develop two engines —
multivalve and electric drive — as well as fuel-cell technology.
4. Estimate how long each technology-development project will take.
To estimate this, you need to understand the dependencies. What do you
have to complete before you can work on the next thing? What work will
contribute to a later project?
The car company estimates that the multivalve engine will take two
years. Development of the electric drive engine will require different
technology and won’t start until the multivalve engine is complete.

Part II: Charting the Ocean of Opportunities for New Products 

The staff resources for the multivalve engine will be different from the
resources needed for the electric drive engine. The company will have to
staff up in order to resource the second project (see Step 5). For these
reasons, it makes sense to put the second project’s start date after the
completion date of the first project.
You can see in Figure 7-5 that the company doesn’t plan to begin the fuel-
cell project until well after it completes the multivalve engine, and look-
ing at Figure 7-3, you can see that the company plans to outsource it.
You should always record the rationale for your decisions. You can do
this by providing live links from the action agenda to supporting docu-
ments such as technology and product maps.
5. Estimate the resources, in dollars and in people, that you’ll need to
accomplish each technology-development project.
The multivalve engine will cost $3 million and require 5 FTE (full-time
equivalent staff). The electric engine is a much bigger project; it will cost
$8 million and 20 FTE. The fuel cell will require $3M and 8 FTE of internal
resources to integrate and coordinate the outsourced project into its
own technology and product development projects. The outsource cost
isn’t included on this agenda.
You should show — either on the chart itself or on a linked chart — exactly
what staffing you’ll need. If you need employees with specialized skills,
you need to be sure that they haven’t been assigned to several projects
at the same time.
6. Use the information in this summary to guide your company’s technol-
ogy development efforts!
You’ve created a plan that spans many years. Many things will change.
You’ll have new opportunities and face new challenges. The action agenda
is a plan of action — a contract, really — between R&D and management.
It spells out what R&D should do and the resources management will pro-
vide. It suggests the rationale for your plan and the context for the team’s
work. But if anyone assumes that just because it’s written down, the future
will unfold that way — well, you know what “assume” spells . . . .
Getting a little help from your friends
Be sure as you develop your technology agenda (see the previous section)
that you look carefully for opportunities to avoid unnecessary labor and cost.
For example, many companies are now partnering with others who invent
and develop technologies for them. Often, you can come up with what you
need by putting old things together in new ways. One of your most important
goals is to get new products to the market quickly. Don’t get stuck in the
145
Chapter 7: Making the Most of Technology

invention stage while someone else brings a successful, high-margin new
product to market!
Take a look at the bars labeled “All Electric” and “Fuel Cell” in Figure 7-3. The
car company uses a shaded oval bar to indicate that it plans to accomplish
these projects with a partner. Even though the development of the fuel cell
and the electric engine are extremely important to the company’s future, the
company doesn’t have the necessary resources in-house, and it would take
too long to develop the technologies on its own. Furthermore, the company
is fairly certain that it can find a partner whose main interest is in the tech-
nology itself; therefore, the partner won’t present a competitive threat.
In Chapter 16, you can discover much more about how to develop technology
and new products with a partner, how to manage your alliances, and how to
protect your assets. The better job you do of mapping your technologies and
understanding your needs and resources, the more effectively you’ll be able
to take advantage of partnering and outsourcing.

H
ere you are at the NPD buffet. Instead of guacamole, fried chicken, and
bean salad, you’ve got technology projects, ideas for radical new stuff,
and concepts that will improve your existing products and product lines. And
at this buffet, your eyes often are bigger than your stomach, and your plate
will hold only so much. You need to set targets and goals for your new prod-
uct development efforts, and you need to communicate them clearly to
employees who work to develop new products. Companies that accomplish
this are able to optimize their product development resources.
Different parts of the company — teams, functions, business units, and the
company as a whole — have different targets, and metrics are what make the
targets precise. You need to design different metrics for different parts of the
company. With well-designed metrics, your company can measure how well
it’s implementing its NPD goals. (Take a look at Chapter 18 for more advice on
NPD metrics.)
In this chapter, we show you how to focus your NPD efforts. You discover how
to set up targets and how to measure your success in reaching them. We also
summarize the logic of partnering — with another firm or with a supplier —
and the logic of going it alone. Finally, we introduce a communication plan to
put your whole organization on the same page.

Setting NPD Targets
Developing new products takes resources that business functions could be
spending in other ways — for example, to reach new markets, acquire other
companies, or expand the company’s manufacturing infrastructure. Typically,
a company’s employees have competing priorities and more than enough
tasks to fill their time. Therefore, everyone in the company needs to know how
important it is to devote time and resources to new product development.
Executives communicate the importance by setting clear NPD targets and
measuring the performance of the business units, functions, and employees
against these targets.
Don’t make the mistake of setting targets and then not using them to judge
performance. Consider this case: A company’s executives set a goal of getting
a certain percent of its revenue from new products. Co-author Beebe Nelson
asked how the company assessed its performance. “We don’t,” was the answer.
“We just say that that’s what we want to do, but we never go back to see how
we’re doing.” In this situation, targets and measures have no meaning.
Stock analysts often look at a company’s product pipeline to assess the future
health of the company. When you set NPD targets, you and the analysts can
see — month after month and year after year — how healthy your product
pipeline is and how well the company is positioned to grow.
New product development results don’t happen overnight. Your targets
should extend three to five years or more, depending on your industry.
In this section, we suggest a number of methods that you can use to set your
NPD targets.
Financial targets
Financial targets for new products include both the company’s growth targets
and targets for replacing revenues that are lost as product lines age. When you
look at the lifecycles of products already in the market (see Chapter 3), you
see that most of them produce less and less revenue over time. Older products,
pressed by competition and plagued by customer familiarity, tend to produce
lower revenue and lower margins. How quickly revenues decline depends in
part on the kind of business you’re in. Products lose value relatively quickly
in such industries as fashion, food, and hi-tech. In more stable industries, prod-
ucts may sustain their ability to produce satisfactory revenues over a much
longer period of time.
148
Part II: Charting the Ocean of Opportunities for New Products 

Don’t make the mistake of supposing that a product will produce revenue for-
ever. We can’t tell you the number of times we’ve seen business cases for new
products that make this assumption.
When setting financial targets, you should take into account the amount of
revenue you expect to gain from products already in the market. New prod-
ucts need to make up the gap between existing revenues, expected decline in
revenues, and your growth goals. Financial targets for new products include
the following:
 An overall target for the company: Every company, large or small,
should set a financial target for new product development.
 Targets for business units: If the company has separate business units,
each should have an NPD target. The sum of the business unit targets
should add up to the overall company target.
 Targets for different product lines and product categories: Setting dif-
ferent targets helps managers make decisions that are appropriate to dif-
fering categories. For example, if a company has a line of automobiles
that have been in the market for a long time, it will set smaller targets for
revenues from new products. If the company manages a newer line —
say, a line of hybrids — it can set higher targets for new products as a
percent of revenue.
Although financial targets are an important part of the target mix, don’t make
the mistake of basing all your judgments on them. Researchers consistently
find that companies that rely solely on financial measures do worse than
companies that use a mix of measures. This is why we tell you later in this
chapter about other, non-financial ways of setting new product targets.
Posting your financial targets
Companies use a number of different ways to express financial targets for
product development. The most common are the following:
 Internal rate of return (IRR)
 Return on investment (ROI)
 Net present value (NPV)
You calculate IRR and ROI as percentages: If we spend this much now, what
can we expect to get back later? For example, you can look at the ROI over
one calendar or fiscal year. If you invest $1,000 in a new product, and in the
first year it earns $50, your ROI is 5 percent. If you invest $100 in another
product and it earns $20, your ROI for that product is 20 percent.
149
Chapter 8: Focusing Your NPD Efforts

You use NPV to calculate the future worth of a current investment, and you
subtract the expenditures required to get there.
Many companies also set standards, or hurdle rates, for IRR, ROI, and NPV.
Your new product development expenditures must provide better returns
than a safer investment. After all, why go to all the trouble and risk of devel-
oping a new product when investing in the stock or bond market seems like a
safer option? A company’s understanding of the economy influences the hurdle
rate it chooses. If the executives think that they could get a 15 percent return
in safer investments, they may set that figure as the hurdle that new product
projects have to meet or clear. Setting a hurdle rate reminds everyone that the
resources directed to developing new products could be directed elsewhere.
Product developers have to demonstrate that they can make good use of the
resources entrusted to them (see Chapter 11 for more on managing resources).
In Portfolio Management for New Products (Addison-Wesley), Robert Cooper,
Scott Edgett, and Elko Kleinschmidt introduce several other financial mea-
sures that companies use to set targets. These measures help you to get a
handle on the relative worth of resources expended now compared to their
future value. One measure is expected commercial value (ECV), which you cal-
culate by using a combination of NPV and risk assessments.
Another measure is the options pricing theory (OPT). OPT provides a finan-
cial framework for the phase/review process. Reviewers stop projects when
the business case starts to look bad. The decision to invest is, in reality, a
decision — or option — to invest only until the next review. (See Chapter 9
for more on reviews and the phase/review process.)
How do you decide which financial measure to use? Get advice from members
of your financial department, and choose the measure that allows you to take
information from different parts of the company and merge it into an overall
measure. In other words, if your company is running on NPV, for example, that’s
a good reason to choose NPV; if you’re running on IRR, you should choose IRR.
When you choose a financial measure, you’re choosing a template that allows
you to put information and assumptions about different projects into com-
parable form. The value of such a measure is that it allows you to compare
projects so you can decide which seem better, and you can compare today’s
measures with tomorrow’s to see how well your projects are doing. Never
forget, though, that when you gather the information and the assumptions
into a measure, the measure is only as good as the information from which
it’s built — and the information always includes guesses and projections
about the future.
When a company settles on its financial measures, it should use them for all
its new product projects. Using the same measures provides a common metric
on which to base project comparisons. (We talk more about this in Chapter 12,
where we discuss business plans and project reviews.)

Questions to consider
Setting or reassessing financial growth targets depends on your estimates of
several “real world” factors, including the following:
 What’s the potential for market growth? If the market is likely to be
growing, you can target higher returns; if the market is shrinking, your
targets should be lower.
 What’s our current share? Can we grow that share? In markets where
your company already has large shares, you may not be able to make
much more on new products. If your shares are lower, or if you’re likely
to be able to grow your shares, the target can be higher.
 What’s the competitive picture? Are competitors strong compared to
us? Are they entering or leaving? The financial returns of a great new
entry to the market can be undercut by “fast followers” who come up
with similar or even better products. On the other hand, perhaps you’ve
found a market where competitors are moving out and you can take
advantage of the leftover space.
 What’s happening to prices? Are they holding steady, increasing, or
declining? Prices often start relatively high when products are intro-
duced, and they decline during the products’ lifecycles. If you introduce
products into an old market where the prices are declining — for exam-
ple, the computer market — don’t set your targets too high (for the com-
puter at least). If the market is newer, you can expect to charge higher
prices and gain better margins, so set your targets higher.
 If we enter a market that we’re not currently in, how will that action
change the overall picture? How are competitors likely to respond? 
Will your entrance attract more customers or simply create more
choices for existing customers? Take these things into account when
you set your targets.
If your company’s executives respond to all these questions, they’ll be able to
set realistic financial targets for new product development. But this is no easy
process. You need to have a good grasp of your market situations and of your
opportunities within those markets, and you need to have expertise in devel-
oping financial information.
Market share targets
A clear market share target presents a picture of what a company wants to
accomplish in developing new products. If you specify your current market
share and the likelihood of market growth in each of your markets, you’ll
have a benchmark for projecting your desired market share.
Product developers use market share targets to formulate a strategy for gain-
ing the company’s desired share. The strategy to achieve this target may
151
Chapter 8: Focusing Your NPD Efforts

include improving existing products or developing new ones. In some cases,
a market is so saturated that further growth is unlikely, no matter what the
product developers do. In such a case, a company may turn to entirely new
markets in order to find room for the profitable introduction of new products.
Say, for example, that a transistor manufacturer controls nearly half the
market for a cellphone part. The company shares this market with one other
competitor. To gain more share in this market would be very hard to do —
maybe even impossible. The company decides to launch a new business in
order to pursue high margin returns from new products in totally different
markets. The company still enjoys high returns in the cellphone market,
which it shares with its nearest competitor, but the company’s growth strat-
egy focuses on other markets.
Percent-of-sales targets
Another popular target within new product development is a percent-of-sales
target. 3M, for example, uses this measure. For years the company has set a
target of earning 25 percent of its revenue from products it has developed in
the last five years.
Your company can express percent-of-sales targets in different ways to cap-
ture the particular conditions and strategies of the company. Take a look at
the following examples:
 In a fast-moving industry, such as electronics or software, a target of 50
percent of revenue from new product sales may be appropriate.
 A mature company that focuses on profitability, such as DuPont, may
create a target of 15 percent or less for revenue from sales of new prod-
ucts; the rest of the revenue will come from existing products.
 Consumer products firms, such as Procter & Gamble, often have a target
of 20 to 30 percent of their revenue from sales of products that are less
than three years old.
 Companies with stable product lines may have targets for new products
of 10 percent of revenue or less. Big oil companies fit this picture. Most
of their revenue comes from traditional forms of oil exploration and pro-
duction, but they earn some revenue from newer technologies and prod-
ucts in the alternative energy field.
Although percent-of-sales targets can be useful, they’re subject to gaming.
We’ve known product developers who count the tiniest changes in their tal-
lies of new products. Not only does this derail the intention of the percent-of-
sales target, which is to assess the impact of new products, but also
contributes to a culture of deceit in which employees pretend to fulfill the
company’s objectives in order to hide the fact that they haven’t.
152
Part II: Charting the Ocean of Opportunities for New Products 

Including Partners in New 
Product Development
An integral part of focusing your NPD efforts is being clear about where your
resources are coming from. Are you limited to the resources you have in-house,
or can you draw on outside support from partners or suppliers to achieve
your product development goals? Working with partners and making effective
use of your supply chain can add greatly to your capacity to develop new
products. Outsourcing and partnering are important issues for product devel-
opers. We devote Chapters 15 and 16 to these topics.
In this section, we address three important questions: What should you keep
inside your company? What can you get from a partner? And what could (and
should) you buy from a supplier?
What should you keep inside?
The best way to keep your development efforts protected is to keep your
work in-house. The overwhelming agreement among companies is that you
shouldn’t partner on or outsource your core competencies — the things that
you do especially well, that give you competitive advantage, and that attract
your customers. Generally, firms should identify no more than three to five
competencies that they consider to be core.
However, it can be hard to agree on what your competencies are. The
International Association for Product Development came up with three
important characteristics:
 A core competence provides a significant customer benefit that consti-
tutes a long-term competitive advantage in performance or cost.
 A core competence gives you access to a variety of markets.
 A core competence includes physical and intellectual assets that com-
petitors have difficulty imitating.
Asking the following questions will help you identify your company’s core
competencies:
 What knowledge do you have that’s better than the knowledge pos-
sessed by your competitors? For example, Corning’s knowledge of how
to work with glass is its defining core competency.
 What are the chief intellectual assets that a competitor would want to
acquire from your organization (and that you wouldn’t want to give
153
Chapter 8: Focusing Your NPD Efforts

up)? For example, what competitive advantage would Intel have if others
figured out how to make its processors?
 What intellectual assets does your organization have that, if lost,
would threaten your existence? Pharmaceutical companies protect
patents on drugs they’re developing and drugs or compounds that they
want to keep from their competitors. Without such protection of intellec-
tual property, the competitive environment in the pharmaceutical indus-
try would be very different; many of the current players might no longer
be in the game.
Technology roadmaps and spider charts (see Chapter 7) can be very helpful
in your quest to identify your company’s core competencies.
Your company’s leadership should make its core competencies very clear
and should communicate them widely within the firm. You need to protect
these assets and nurture them as you develop technologies and products.
However, when you need a technology or product that isn’t part of the core,
you can consider bringing in a partner or buying from a supplier.
What can you get from a partner?
Often, the best route to the quickest return is to find a partner for your prod-
uct development efforts. Partnering provides the following benefits:
 A partner may provide the resources that allow you to achieve success
in certain technologies and markets — success that you wouldn’t be
able to achieve on your own.
 If a partner has already developed a technology, or has more expertise
than you, you get to a market and a profit quicker than you would on
your own.
 Partnering can provide access to new markets and can fill product 
line gaps.
 Partnering can reduce the costs of development.
 Partnering can provide competencies that you may lack.
Partnering can be a risky proposition, however. Consider the following pitfalls:
 Partnerships often fail for organizational reasons, including cultural dif-
ferences, misaligned objectives, and failure of leadership.
 Partnerships can fail for some of the same reasons that cause internal
technology projects to fail: unanticipated market changes, failure to
understand the market, and technology failure.
154
Part II: Charting the Ocean of Opportunities for New Products 

 Partnerships expose your company to losses of knowledge assets and
intellectual property.
 Partnerships always mean that you have less control over the whole
enterprise.
When your company needs to decide whether to enter into a partnership,
make sure management asks and answers the following questions:
 Could we lose core competencies if we partner on this? If the answer is
yes, don’t enter into a partnership.
 Can we get the technology we need from a licensing or supplier
arrangement, where we don’t have to enter into complex develop-
ment relationships and we can hold onto our intellectual assets? If the
answer is yes, don’t enter into a partnership.
 Does this represent a significant opportunity that we couldn’t pursue
on our own and that doesn’t threaten our core competencies? If the
answer is yes, partnering may be your best option.
If you decide to take on a partner, be sure to read Chapter 16 for more infor-
mation on finding and managing partnerships.
What can you buy?
If you need outside assistance to develop and profit from a new product, the
cheapest option with the lowest risk usually is to buy from a trusted supplier.
In contrast to a partnership arrangement (see the previous section), your
company retains control over the relationship. You can specify what you
need, and you can protect your intellectual property. Of course, the more you
keep your supplier in the dark, the less you can expect the supplier to partici-
pate in the product development process. There’s always a tradeoff.
So, what should you try to buy from a supplier? You’ll have the best success
purchasing elements that have the following characteristics:
 Parts of products, or even entire products, that are of little value to
the customer: This category includes commodities, things that the cus-
tomer can easily get from others, and things that the customer can use
substitutes for.
 Parts of products that are modular: Modular products are like building
blocks. You can have a supplier produce one of the building blocks that
make up your product, and then you can fit the piece into the overall
product. Your supplier doesn’t need to know about the whole product.
155
Chapter 8: Focusing Your NPD Efforts

You also can change the product without having to change the out-
sourced part.
 Parts or products that you have a weak position in: If you’re the
market or technology leader, you should keep the part or product to
yourself. If others can do as good a job or better, you won’t put your
position in jeopardy if you entrust work to a supplier.
If a certain element is high in customer value, but you have a weak position 
in it, you may consider a partnership, a strategic alliance, or an outright acqui-
sition. We give the same advice about highly integrated technologies, because
it’s difficult to outsource a piece of a complex entity. However, if you can
identify elements that
1) Don’t contribute very much to the customer
2) You can’t do easily yourself
3) Are separable from the rest of your efforts
you probably have good candidates for outsource transactions.
Consider a company that designs and manufactures inhalers. The company 
is an expert at plastic molding and manufacturing, and it understands the
customer and the market very well. It wants to include a metal part in a new
product, which will make it easier to calibrate the product. However, the
company has no experience or expertise in metal work; the customer could
calibrate the product without the metal part; and the metal part is entirely
modular — anyone designing and manufacturing it wouldn’t know what it will
be a part of. Therefore, the metal part is a good candidate for outsourcing.
Managing Your Business to 
Achieve Your NPD Goals
Being successful at new product development demands the integration of
many activities within a corporation. In order to gauge success and identify
areas that need improvement, corporations use sets of measures to chart
how well they handle their business in many places and at many levels.
The following list presents the four areas of business your company needs 
to manage and measure to be sure you’re doing all you can to achieve your
NPD goals:
 You need to track your corporate and business level targets.
 You need to be sure that your new product development teams — the
people who actually do the work — have the company’s support and are
producing what you’re counting on them for.
156
Part II: Charting the Ocean of Opportunities for New Products 

 You need to make sure the functions are playing a helpful role.
 You need to know that the processes you count on to produce new prod-
ucts are working well.
Corporate/business measures
After you set your targets (see the section “Setting NPD Targets”) and decide
whether to buy, to partner, or to develop products alone (see the section
“Including Partners in New Product Development”), you need to start keeping
track of how well you’re measuring up.
The predicted earnings of new products in the development pipeline, taken
together with what products are earning in the market, should equal your
growth goals.
We recommend that your company executives meet to review and update
your target and revenue numbers frequently. If you aren’t meeting your tar-
gets, you need to find out the source(s) of the problem and take corrective
action as quickly as possible. Maybe the targets are unrealistic, or maybe
things have changed in the market. Maybe your company is expecting too
much from the product development teams, or perhaps your outsource part-
ners aren’t providing as much as you expected.
You have two choices:
 You can change your targets. Executives base their targets and goals on
the best information they can gather. If new information changes the pic-
ture, you need to change the projections.
 You can change how you’re attempting to meet the targets. Your tar-
gets are based on assumptions about your company’s ability to meet
them; if you’re falling short, you can review those assumptions and
revise your approach. You can look at staffing and at whether your pro-
jects have sufficient resources. Outsourcing may not be providing as
much help as it could. You also can review your new product portfolio
and make changes to that (see Chapter 11).
If your company is hitting its targets, get the word out. Employees who know
they’re on the right road function better than people who are unsure of their
progress. When the business is succeeding, congratulate yourself and every-
one else!
Team measures
When you’re developing products, you need to measure how your teams are
performing, and do so frequently. When a team or project is failing with respect
157
Chapter 8: Focusing Your NPD Efforts

to schedule, budget, time-to-market, or meeting its financial targets, you need
to find out what’s happening on that team and within that project. If you’re
willing to look for root causes instead of rushing to assign blame, you may find
that teams that fall short of their goals can provide occasions for improvement
rather than for despair.
Ask the following questions:
 Do they have the resources they need? The necessary skills and experi-
ence? Your teams should have the training, skills, experience, and sup-
port they need to be successful (see Chapter 10 for more on NPD teams
and Chapter 11 for more on managing resources).
 Are the project goals realistic, and have the team members participated
in setting goals and targets for their project (see Chapter 12)?
 Are they working well as a team?
 Do they understand the “best practices” they should be using, including
understanding customer needs (see Chapter 4), project management
(see Project Management For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Stanley E. Portny
[Wiley]), and the phase/review process (see Chapter 9)?
Management may have to intervene with an underperforming team. Maybe
members of the team are slacking off, or maybe they just aren’t up to the
assignment. Most often, however, a team’s failure points to organizational
needs, such as lack of training or skills. A team’s failure may even point to
organizational patterns — for example, the tendency to overload teams with
too many projects.
Functional measures
Your company’s success at NPD depends very much on how well your organi-
zation’s functions support the development effort. You need to make sure
that each functional area has the personnel in place to support NPD and that
the functions are willing to devote their resources in order to fulfill the NPD
agenda. The following sections outline some measures that will highlight the
strength of your functions as they relate to NPD.
Project resources
New product development doesn’t have its own resources. The success of
new products depends on the ability of your company’s functions to provide
needed resources. Your functions are “centers of excellence” in the company.
One of their jobs is to have resources for the timely and effective develop-
ment of new products. The ability to see what’s needed now and to plan for
what you’ll need in the future is critical to your company’s NPD success.
158
Part II: Charting the Ocean of Opportunities for New Products 

So, do the functions within your company have the resources needed to sup-
port your NPD effort? Ask the following questions to find out:
 Does your research and development (R&D) function have the resources
it needs to staff new product teams? Does it have plans to build resources
in anticipation of new skills that may become necessary?
 If new product targets involve new technology, is your R&D division
working on developing, acquiring, or outsourcing the technology so that
it will be ready for the new product? (Refer to Chapter 7 for more on
planning for technology resources.)
When new technologies enter a market, they can change how companies
develop products and can impact the functionality that customers
expect. A company’s R&D function must anticipate and build the new
expertise that will be needed. Consider how many manufacturers were
caught napping when software was included in almost every product
except hammers! Too many product development teams had to put
development work on hold while the company’s few software experts
ran from project to project.
 Can your marketing function support product introduction in the
planned markets?
Marketing functions have expertise and relationships in a number of
markets. If a new product is planned for a market the function is unfamil-
iar with, members of the function will have to do a lot of extra work to
prepare for the product introduction. You can’t assume that the mar-
keters in your company can work their magic anywhere and everywhere.
Be sure to plan for marketing’s role in product introduction. (See
Chapter 13 for more on launching new products.)
 Are your packaging, service, and other functions set up to do what they
need to do? At a minimum, these functional members need to be involved
in up-front planning for new product projects (see Chapter 10 for more
159
Chapter 8: Focusing Your NPD Efforts
To cancel a project is not to fail!
Sometimes, during the phase/review process
(see Chapters 9 and 12), management cancels
projects. When this happens to a project, you
shouldn’t necessarily consider it a failure. What
is a failure is when a project keeps going when
it deserves to be cancelled. Not every project
that starts down the development pipeline
should reach the market. In fact, in many com-
panies fewer than 50 percent of the projects
that start ever reach the market. Your NPD
resources are too valuable to squander on pro-
jects that, on the way to market — or, even
worse, in the market — turn out to be mediocre.

on cross-functional NPD teaming). In addition, the functions should include
expertise in new product development efforts. For example, the functions
should be able to provide skill and experience in designing packaging,
service, and so on for new products.
 Will your manufacturing division be able to develop the processes and
resources needed for the new product(s)? If any new products require
manufacturing changes, will the manufacturing part of your company be
ahead of the curve or be left dragging its feet? Manufacturing must also
play a role in ensuring that your company designs products with an eye
to manufacturing — in other words, the manufacturing function must
provide “design for manufacturing” expertise.
In order for the functions within your company to know what’s needed to
succeed in NPD, you need to keep them in the loop with respect to the prod-
uct development agenda (see the section “Uniting Your NPD Efforts with an
Internal Communication Plan”).
Functional process alignment
Another important aspect to consider is whether your functional processes
are in sync with your company’s product development agenda. For instance,
functions often reward people — monetarily and in terms of career path — in
ways that don’t jibe with participation in NPD. If this is the case in your com-
pany, team members may be more loyal to their functional goals than to their
NPD goals. Your human resources department can help fix this problem by
aligning functional and project rewards.
Problems also arise when functional calendars make it hard to achieve suc-
cess in NPD projects — for example, when yearly budget cycles get in the
way of the project-based timing of NPD. Some companies sidestep this prob-
lem by assigning project resources that teams can tap into when needed.
Your company must take the time to look at functional issues to see whether
you can align the functional processes and schedules with your NPD efforts.
Process measures
Your NPD processes — including the portfolio process (see Chapter 11), the
phase/review process (see Chapter 9), and customer visit and roadmapping
processes (see Chapters 4 and 7) — are the engines that power your organi-
zation to meet its growth targets. A variety of process measures show the
effectiveness of your product development processes in delivering value to
the organization over time.
160
Part II: Charting the Ocean of Opportunities for New Products 

Process measures help your organization look at systemic issues that may be
preventing projects from succeeding. The failure of a single project or team
may be the result of a company’s poor decision making, a lack of resources,
poor planning, and so on. You need to resolve these systemic issues at the
level of the processes rather than at the level of individuals and teams who
don’t have the leverage to fix the issues themselves.
Here are some questions that should be included in your process assessments:
 How robust is your front-end process? In particular, do you routinely
have more good ideas and opportunities than you can resource and
fund? You should. Take a look at Chapters 4 and 5 to find out how.
 How quickly do your processes move projects from idea to commer-
cialization? If your cycle time — your time to market — isn’t competitive
with or better than your competitors’, you have some work to do. (Take
a look at Chapter 9 for more on cycle time.)
 Do your processes deliver a product on time or ahead of schedule
while staying on or under budget? If your projects routinely fail in this
category, you should look to the process rather than at individual pro-
jects to find a fix.
Your schedule and budget projections need to be as accurate as possi-
ble so that your executives can make good decisions about which pro-
jects to resource. Coming in ahead of schedule and under budget means
that there’s slack in the system. See Chapters 9 and 12 for ways in which
product teams can work with executives to make accurate predictions.
 Do your projects routinely meet the financial targets you predict for
them at the beginning of the pipeline? If not, look to the process to find
the reasons.
Uniting Your NPD Efforts with an
Internal Communication Plan
You can’t achieve focus in your NPD efforts by writing a document and then
crossing your fingers. You have to have a plan — more specifically, an inter-
nal communication plan. This plan is a process for exchanging information
about your company’s goals and objectives. This exchange will make the
intentions of top management clear; it will allow the different parts of the
company to coordinate their efforts; and it will permit the actions and exper-
tise of your NPD teams to be integrated into both planning and delivery.
161
Chapter 8: Focusing Your NPD Efforts

The internal communication plan isn’t a document (though there may be doc-
uments involved). It needs to be a living process that engages the people
involved. And like any living thing, the plan changes. You need to plan to
update it frequently.
In the following sections, we outline a number of methods for documenting
and updating the plan and making sure it keeps everyone on the same path.
Making sure your plan starts at the top
Your company can’t set product development targets in a vacuum and expect
employees to accomplish them. Ongoing dialogue — from top management
to business units and from business units to new product teams — is an
essential ingredient. And it’s up to top management to formulate the com-
pany’s overall goals.
Harvard’s Steven Wheelwright and Kim Clark conducted research that shows
that many senior managers get involved in new product development too far
along in the process. What often gets them involved is a breakdown that
occurs during the development process. The managers jump in, act like
heroes, motivate the team, and bring in resources. Often, they exercise their
considerable project management and technical skills. What these mangers
don’t do, however, is lead. Leading requires a view of what’s causing break-
downs and how the organization can learn to overcome them.
If many of your projects need remedial help late in the development process,
take it as a sure sign that your senior managers aren’t succeeding at their
jobs. Senior managers need to do the following to ensure NPD success:
 Set the direction of the product development effort
 Be good communicators
 Be sure that the goals and objectives for new product development are
achievable
 Inspire the commitment of the business and functional heads who will
be responsible for resourcing and carrying out plans
Assigning a plan leader
New product development cuts across many other business processes. It
both affects these other processes and is affected by them. The internal com-
munication plan needs a “plan leader” who can work across all these internal
boundaries.
162
Part II: Charting the Ocean of Opportunities for New Products 

Many companies have an NPD process owner who acts on management’s
behalf to manage and improve the product development practices of the
company. The process owner is the best choice for “plan leader,” since he or
she is already working across these boundaries with the large variety of
people who participate in the development of new products.
The key role of the process owner is to coordinate the needs and the activi-
ties of the players in your NPD processes (see Chapter 1 for an overview of
who those players are). To do so, he or she must
 Create dialogue.
 Verify that plans are up-to-date.
 Make sure that resources are present where and when they’re needed
(see Chapter 11).
To accomplish all his or her responsibilities, a process owner also must be in
charge of the decision-making and delivery processes that surround product
development. It’s up to the process owner to know what the best practices
are, to understand how well the company is doing compared to the competi-
tion and to agreed-on benchmarks, and to make sure that the company
improves processes and trains personnel to use the processes effectively.
163
Chapter 8: Focusing Your NPD Efforts
The process owner: All the right wares
To provide a little insight into what an NPD
process owner does, here’s a story about a
company that develops housewares. In this
company, no one had the job of coordinating the
activities of the different business units, func-
tions, and teams. No one was responsible for
deciding what projects should get which
resources, or even which projects the company
most wanted to pursue. To make matters worse,
the company’s marketing function was in North
America, but its product development and man-
ufacturing functions were in Asia. When the
company finally took a look at what was miss-
ing in coordinating its NPD efforts, its leaders
came up with three critical needs:
 A person who could communicate plans
(short- and long-term)
 A person who could make sure that senior
management decided what products the
company would develop
 A person who could make decisions that
crossed boundaries
Recognizing these needs spurred the company
to create the role of NPD process owner. The
process owner enabled the company to focus
its NPD activities, to eliminate waste and rework,
and, consequently, to enjoy more success in
focusing resources on its NPD goals and targets.

Ensuring that team members know 
their roles and play them well
New product development teams consist of the people who actually carry
out the work that allows companies to meet their objectives (see Chapter 10
for more on these teams). Too often, however, team members don’t under-
stand or realize how their work needs to contribute to their company’s over-
all strategy. They just see their jobs, their projects, and their products.
Teams can become very committed to a product — sometimes to the detri-
ment of other projects and to the company’s overall business plan. For exam-
ple, an NPD team (possibly in the R&D division) may be asked to develop a
technology or a part that other teams in other projects will use later on. A
team that understands the goals of the company will work to make a part
that the company can use as widely as possible; a team that’s committed to
its own vision may produce a part that’s great for its product but useless for
others.
If NPD teams in your company are ignoring others’ goals, you can’t fix the
problem by chewing out the teams that behave this way. You need to improve
company-wide communication. The teams need to have frequent and mean-
ingful briefings on the company’s goals. They need to have a chance to par-
ticipate and offer suggestions and solutions that may improve the company’s
ability to achieve NPD success.
The team’s leader (see Chapter 10), working in conjunction with management
and the process owner (see the previous section), shares the responsibility
for making sure that the team stays focused — not just on a better mouse-
trap, but on the role that the mousetrap plays in forwarding the company’s
NPD agenda.
In many companies, formal or informal “product champions” work at the
executive level, play an important role in explaining the benefits of NPD pro-
jects to management, and help team members understand management’s
concerns and expectations.

Development

In this part . . .
H
ere’s where you move from the ocean of opportunity
into the river of development. Now the work gets
very disciplined. Product development teams have real
schedules and real budgets, and missing timelines or bud-
gets means serious consequences for projects and for the
company.
Part III gives you precise information about the role of 
the product development process; how to organize, lead,
manage, support, and work on cross-functional teams; how
to facilitate meaningful and appropriate dialogue between
executives and team members when they assemble for new
product reviews; and how to make sure that all your hard
work pays off as you launch your products into the market.
In the middle of this part is Chapter 11. In this chapter, we
present what you could call the Master Control Program —
the processes and practices that enable companies to
control the many opportunities, issues, and problems that
product developers have to deal with every day. The chap-
ter has a simple title: Managing Your Corporation’s NPD
Resources. However, by managing its resources, a company
can put its ideas, strategies, dreams, and visions into
action. If we could require you to read one chapter in this
book, Chapter 11 is the one!

Product Development Process

 Building knowledge and managing risk
M
ost companies have some kind of formal process to get new product
ideas developed and into the market. Developing new products pulls
people together from all over the company — marketing, R&D, manufactur-
ing, and elsewhere. A formal, explicit new product development (NPD) process
enables these people who come from such different backgrounds to work
together, to assess and manage development risk, and to use common terms
to communicate. The process also ties the work of new product development
teams to the activities and objectives of the wider corporation — to functions,
business units, and upper management.
If your company has a new product development process in place, you may
think that your process is special or unique. And why not? It may even have a
special name, such as the “Idea to Business Process,” the “Commercialization
Process,” “FastTrack,” or whatever. But after you look at many product devel-
opment processes, you realize that the most important parts and elements of
an NPD process are the same from process to process, from company to com-
pany, and even from industry to industry. In this chapter, you get a clear view
of these important parts and elements. You may even be able to trim off some
things you’ve added to your process — things that get in the way and slow
you down.
If you work by yourself or in a very small company but you want to be able to
play with the big guys, you need to understand how the larger organizations
define and manage their product development processes. Visit your customers
to see what they do (see Chapter 4 for tips on visiting customers), talk with
them about how they organize their product development work, and take

advantage of the networking and resources for NPD professionals by hooking up
with organizations like the Product Development and Management Association
(PDMA; www.pdma.org).
In this chapter, you discover the basics of the new product development
process — a process that outlines the phases of product development (some-
times called stages) and combines them with reviews (sometimes called gates
or decision diamonds). Structured phases and reviews help NPD teams manage
their work, ensure that teams are meeting project goals, and help teams and
managers make sure that NPD projects stay aligned with the company’s goals.
You also figure out how to tailor the NPD process so that it fits your company’s
special style, and how to use the process to integrate functional objectives 
in order to navigate the often rocky political terrain. Finally, you find out how
the NPD process enables teams and executives to manage risk and to antici-
pate issues that may show up as a product gets closer to market (see Chapter
13 for more on that).
Connecting Research to Development:
The Fuzzy Front End
The fuzzy front end is the bridge between the upfront research and 
brainstorming — exploring market and technology opportunities in the “ocean
of opportunity,” visiting customers (see Chapter 4), and coming up with ideas
and concepts (see Chapter 5) — and the very focused and disciplined process
of bringing a product to market.
Crossing the paths that run through the fuzzy front end requires a culture
change, because being great at developing new products means that you can
work in two different styles. You have to be open, creative, innovative, and
divergent in the beginning, and then you have to be disciplined and time-and-
budget bound, and you have to work to clear deliverables and clear timetables.
The front end of the product development process is the time when the pro-
ject, the company, and the development team must accomplish this change.
Phase 1: Navigating from 
the Ocean to the River
Before an idea can really enter the “river of development” — the product
development process — it has to go through several hoops. We call these the
Idea Screen and the Concept Review. These hoops begin to take the “fuzzi-
ness” out of the initial idea and help the idea to stack up against the business
criteria that are all-important to NPD success.
168
Part III: Navigating the River of Product Development 

The Idea Screen and the Concept Brief
The Idea Screen is the initial review in the new product development process.
The purpose of the Idea Screen is to reduce the large number of ideas for
potential projects to a manageable number. Sometimes new product teams
narrow down the choices, and sometimes management makes these choices.
You can find a lot more about this screen in Chapter 6.
The information that companies usually require to enter the Idea Screen tends
to be qualitative and full of “perhapses.” Rigor and precision at this stage will
kill off any but the most mundane and easy-to-understand ideas. However,
before the idea can pass the Concept Review, a team has to write a Concept
Brief in order to begin to turn the creative idea into a business proposition.
(In Chapter 6, you can read more about the Concept Brief and find a form you
can use to draft one.)
In the Concept Brief, the team needs to show how the concept will meet cus-
tomer needs. You may have gaps in your customer information. For example,
if you haven’t visited an important market segment, be sure to note that in
the brief (and see Chapter 4 for more on how to visit customers and under-
stand their needs). The Concept Brief should outline what technology the
concept requires and indicate what technologies are available and which need
to be developed (see Chapter 7 for more on linking technology with product
development). Be sure to check the assumptions you’ve made about the
market opportunity — the potential size of the market and the attractiveness
of the product in that market are critical elements in understanding the busi-
ness proposition. And in the Concept Brief, for the first time you’re expected
to include estimates of financial outlay and return — supported by prelimi-
nary research.
The team that develops all this information must have sufficient time allocated
to the effort Too many companies fail to support the front end of the NPD
process. The most successful companies provide defined resources so their
NPD teams can create clear and useful product concepts. See Chapter 10 for
more on forming a team, and Chapter 11 for the importance of providing ade-
quate project resources.
The Concept Review
After completing the Concept Brief, the NPD team is ready to hold a Concept
Review, at which it presents a preliminary business case to the project’s
reviewers.
The Concept Review is the first time that reviewers will judge an idea for a
product against the same criteria that they’ll use at every review between
now and launch. In this early review, you use ranges and estimates because
169
Chapter 9: One Foot in Front of the Other: The PDP Process

you still don’t have much information. However, pulling the information
together in this form allows you to update and revise the business case as
you move through the product development process.
At the Concept Review, and at every review after the Concept Review, review-
ers do one of three things:
 Pass the project into the next phase.
If the project looks promising, if reviewers believe it will contribute to
the company’s goals, and if reviewers can provide the needed resources,
the reviewers pass it on to the next phase, where the team will draft the
complete business case (see the following section).
 Recycle the project to give the NPD team a chance to develop more
information.
If the reviewers aren’t sure whether the project meets the criteria to
pass, they may choose to recycle the project. A recycle decision gives
reviewers an opportunity to tell the team members what else they need
to know and gives the team a chance to develop the needed information.
It’s far better, in most cases, to ask the team to do more work instead of
passing a dubious project into the next phase.
 Stop the project altogether.
If the project doesn’t meet the criteria, it’s easy and cheap to stop it
early before a team has done much work.
If reviewers stop a project at the Concept Review, they should return it
to the stockpile of concepts that the company may use later on or sell
for whatever value it may have. (See Chapter 6 for more on getting value
from shelved ideas and concepts.)
Phase 2: The Business Case Phase
An important part of the NPD team’s work in the second phase of the devel-
opment process is preparing a potential product’s full business case. Ohmigosh,
you got into product development because you wanted to invent stuff, and
we’re telling you to act like an MBA! Yup, and here’s the reason. If your new
products don’t earn good returns on your investments, you won’t be able to
develop any more later on.
The product development process provides a format for the NPD team and
members of management to hold meaningful conversations about the business
merit of projects. When reviews are done well (see Chapter 12 to find out
how), they cultivate an environment where everyone has a chance to shine —
in other words, to contribute based on expertise and knowledge — and to
work together to create a complete picture of a project’s merits and risks.
170
Part III: Navigating the River of Product Development 

Preparing the business case
The business case should include everything your team developed for its
Concept Review and more (see the section “The Concept Review”). In this
phase, the team needs more resources to do more research. Most business
cases include a Project Overview and Business Strategy section early on.
Here’s what you include in this section:
 What the team is planning to develop: The team describes the new
product and the customer needs the new product will fulfill.
 Rationale for the project: How the project is aligned with the company’s
business, market, and technology strategies.
 Resources the team will need to develop the product: The team esti-
mates what employee resources it will need and includes an estimate of
what it will cost to develop the product.
The language of the business case has become rather formal. The team that’s
developing the product is talking to the executives — the business and finan-
cial side of the house. The team’s enthusiasm and conviction that the concept
will be a great product is important, but the team has to make the dollars-and-
cents arguments. Advice to the team: Watch out for the temptation to make
those arguments sound better than they are — check your passion with a good
dose of reality so that you don’t get stuck trying to meet unattainable goals.
The following list presents some of the other pieces of information that most
executives ask for in a business case:
 Who are the target customers for the new product, and how will the
product benefit customers after it hits the marketplace? See Chapter 4
for more on customer information.
 What’s the new product’s market potential? Include how stiff the com-
petition is in the proposed market. (See Chapter 3 for more market info.)
 What are the details of the technical development and manufacture of
the product? Include as much as you know now. For example, is the nec-
essary technology ready, or do you need to develop the technology? Will
you manufacture the product in-house or contract/partner on it (see
Chapter 16)? What changes to your existing manufacturing processes
will the product require? Will these changes require facility or capital
investment?
In the Appendix, we outline a business case template that gives an excellent
overview of what many companies require. You can copy the template
exactly or tailor it to suit your company.
171
Chapter 9: One Foot in Front of the Other: The PDP Process

Conducting the Feasibility Review
The time has come for the team to present the project’s business case to the
reviewers. Companies often call this the Feasibility Review because what the
team and the reviewers must establish is that the project is feasible: that the
technology exists or can be developed; that the product will meet customer
needs; and that there’s a sufficient market for the product to ensure a good
return on the company’s investment.
In other words, the team will present all the reasons it believes a project
should go forward — or not. Reviewers want to know about the project’s
risks and how the team plans to address these risks. They want to know that
the team has included an assessment of the competition. The team should
indicate how complete its knowledge is, show where the gaps are, and pre-
sent its plans for filling the gaps.
The team documents these topics in the business case. The team updates and
refines this business case when it presents the project status at later reviews.
Phase 3: The Development Phase
These next three stages of the product development process take the prod-
uct from concept to the market. You must define and design the product, test
it, and manufacture enough of it to be sure you can ramp up production, all in
an effort to prepare for launch. Often, companies overlap these stages
instead of carrying them out totally sequentially.
The development phase of the product development process is the most vari-
able of all the phases. It depends a lot on the industry and on the kind of prod-
uct you’re developing. If you’re developing software, the phases are extremely
iterative and loopy, and after the product is designed, it’s done — no manu-
facturing phase needed! If you’re developing trucks, though, manufacturing
looms. If your project is to develop a modest improvement to an existing
product or product line, the development phase can go quickly; if it’s a whole
new platform or a breakthrough product, this phase can take months or even
years. In all these cases, however, if your team has done some good upfront
work, you can reduce the time you spend in these phases.
Defining the product
The first stage of the development phase is defining the product that manage-
ment has cleared for development. “Haven’t we already done this in the
172
Part III: Navigating the River of Product Development 

Concept Brief,” you say? Maybe. But you need to make sure. Good product
definition starts with a clear understanding of customer needs (see Chapter 4).
The product concept should meet those needs, and every aspect of the prod-
uct should contribute to that effort.
You may need to include other requirements in addition to customer needs:
 The product may have to come in at a particular price point in order to
fill out a product line.
 The product may have to hit a seasonal market or meet other “window
of opportunity” timing (for example, launching ahead of a competitor
product).
 The product may have to include technology that works for an entire
platform of products.
 The product may need to meet regulatory requirements.
 The product (and processes) may have to meet environmental require-
ments (such as a specified percent of recycled material, or certain chem-
icals being eliminated from the manufacturing process).
All these needs must be spelled out clearly in the product definition.
One of the most common reasons for product development failure is that the
product definition is fuzzy and unclear. Unclear product definition results in
serious problems, including the following:
 The design changes later in the process. A change in design is one of
the most common results of poorly conceived product definition, and
one of the largest contributors to projects going over schedule and 
over budget.
 The product fails in the market because it doesn’t meet a clear cus-
tomer need. If the NPD team doesn’t tie product definition to customer
needs, the team is left to come up with something its members think is
interesting. The results of this are all too predictable.
 The product isn’t aligned with strategic objectives. If you don’t define
the product early on, the project tends to wander off and depart from its
strategic focus.
One of the best ways to nail down a product definition is by generating a
product requirement matrix (see Figure 9-1). The requirements — the cus-
tomers’ as well as the company’s — appear along the Y-axis. Along the top, or
X-axis, you label columns for the product requirements. With this setup, the
team can be very clear about the requirements so it can design and develop
the product in exactly this way.
173
Chapter 9: One Foot in Front of the Other: The PDP Process

The team members who developed this saw used the matrix to make sure
that the features they designed really met the needs of their customers.
When they designed the sloped nose, they made sure that it helped the cus-
tomers fit the saw into hard-to-reach spaces. They designed blade storage in
the saw itself in a way that made changing blades easier for the customer.
Here’s the thing: It’s all too easy for a team to get into the aesthetics of a
sloped nose and forget what it’s for. It’s even easier for a team to design really
great storage in the handle but put it in a place that actually makes it harder
to change the blades. We wish you couldn’t think of so many products you’ve
bought recently that evidently fail the design-for-customer-needs test.
As the development process goes on, your team will have to make some
trade-offs — hard decisions about changing specifications. Your initial specifi-
cations are almost sure to contain some impossibilities. For example, the
product specs may demand a particular ruggedness and a particular weight.
During development, you may discover that it’s simply impossible to achieve
both. A product requirement matrix allows the team to see exactly why that
particular ruggedness and weight are requirements, and it enables the mem-
bers to make sensible decisions about how to compromise, or trade off.
It’s a good idea for projects to have clear “out-of-bounds” criteria. If trade-off
decisions force a project outside these conditions, it’s time to call for a review
to make sure the project can still deliver on its promises. (See Chapter 12 for
more on out-of-bounds criteria.)

Part III: Navigating the River of Product Development 

Designing the product
To turn the concept that your executives have approved into a real product,
you need to bridge the gap between idea and reality. Good product design
starts with understanding your customers and their needs (see Chapter 4).
Product designers bring an understanding of the required materials and tech-
nologies, combined with artistic and creative approaches.
For example, when NPD teams first designed toothbrushes for children, they
made them smaller, because kids’ hands are smaller than adults’ hands. But
when good designers started thinking about the best toothbrush design for
kids, they realized that kids have a hard time grabbing onto small objects.
The right toothbrush for kids, paradoxically, features a much bigger handle
than what works for grownups.
The design phase of development requires drafting and modeling. It requires
that your team move through iterations. If possible, you should create proto-
types at this point in the process and test them with customers (see Chapter
17). Michael Schrage of MIT’s Design Lab refers to this part of the process as
“serious play.”
In Chapter 10, you read about the value of having a cross-functional NPD
team — a team that represents the perspectives and needs of the many differ-
ent functions and disciplines that will contribute to a product concept. You
need these varying perspectives during the design stage, because this is the
time to think about the many requirements that you’ll face “downstream” in
the process. You need to design for x — for manufacture, service, recycling,
and so on. Failure to design for x results in costly delays and reworks. And if
you anticipate downstream needs, you often can include “extras” in the prod-
uct design that don’t add to product cost. For example, a phone manufacturer
roughed up the surface of the phones so that users couldn’t cover them with
stickers, because phones covered with stickers are much harder to recycle.
The extras may even reduce the cost. For example, making a minor change to
a product’s upfront design may enable you to extend the product’s warranty.
In recent years, industrial designers have become a real force in product
development. Industrial designers combine design skills with a knowledge of
materials — kind of like having an artist whose medium is the stuff you make
products from. If you have employees with that combination of skills, do your
best to enlist them in your product design process. If you don’t have these
kinds of people around, you may want to think about hiring them. Another
option is to acquire these skills from an industrial design house, which can
provide design skills on an as-needed basis.
175
Chapter 9: One Foot in Front of the Other: The PDP Process

Developing the product
Developing the product, as you may figure, is the heart of the “product devel-
opment” process. If you’ve done your homework, developed an understand-
ing of customer needs, assembled a cross-functional team, faced and resolved
technology hurdles, and so on, the development stage should go smoothly.
On the other hand, if you have to answer preparatory questions late in the
process, you create a rework cycle that pushes your product beyond sched-
ule and budget and sets it up for failure in the market.
“Managing by checklist” is a good way to ensure that your team moves
smoothly through the development part of the process. Figure 9-2 shows a
sample checklist used by a manufacturer of small consumer products (this
list is similar to the launch checklist — see Figure 13-1 in Chapter 13).
The checklist in Figure 9-2 was designed for a manufactured product. You can
change the list to meet your particular needs. For example, if your product
concept is a service, you can use the list to describe how you’ll make the ser-
vice available to large numbers of customers — perhaps by training service
providers and making an infrastructure available to them.

Part III: Navigating the River of Product Development 

In Figure 9-2, in order to complete the deliverables set up for its development
phase, the team members have to build a working prototype. Notice that the
team also has to make good on its “Design for Manufacturability,” including
its plans for manufacturing scale-up and key suppliers. The team also out-
lines its plans for customer service, making good on “design for serviceabil-
ity.” If the team has done its work well in the design phase, this deliverable
can be relatively easy; if the team is making up for earlier omissions, this step
can be horrible.
A good way to check team progress during the phase is to review the check-
list at team meetings, assess how much of a task is complete, and make sure
that team members have the resources they need to complete the work in
time for the review.
In the development phase, the team has to reconfirm its marketing and sales
estimates and assure the reviewers that the team can commit to the numbers
in the business case (see the earlier section “Phase 2: The Business Case
Phase”). This deliverable usually requires further market research on the
part of the marketing members of the team.
Notice that in the checklist in Figure 9-2, the team doesn’t have to pinpoint
the marketing volumes; it needs to estimate them in a range of ±30 percent.
This is, without doubt, a better way to proceed than to ask for an exact figure.
First, the exact figure won’t be correct. Second, the team may expend far too
much time, wasting scarce resources, in an effort to come up with an exact
number. The specified range varies from industry to industry, but determin-
ing what degree of precision is needed and appropriate at each phase of the
development process is a valuable exercise for executives.
Testing the product
During the testing stage of the development phase, the team determines how
well the product meets the goals for the product’s performance and reliability.
As the team members move from concept, to prototype, to actual product —
in other words, as the product comes closer and closer to its final form — they
can define the goals more precisely, and the goals become more stringent.
Performance and reliability criteria form the basis for product testing. In the
checklist in Figure 9-2, you can see that the NPD team is expected to accom-
plish Alpha Tests before the next review. In an Alpha Test, you give a small
number of products to friendly testers — usually company employees — to
use. You ask them to report any problems. Better yet, you observe them
using the product so you can discover what happens.
177
Chapter 9: One Foot in Front of the Other: The PDP Process

Alpha Tests enable you to get the bugs out of a product. During this stage, it’s
okay if the product doesn’t perform perfectly. Your friends will help you by
letting you know, perfectly frankly, what works and what doesn’t. Later in the
process (after you’re as sure as you can be that the product is working well),
you move to Beta Tests — tests with actual customers. At that point, your
product better be working close to perfectly. Beta Tests aren’t looking for
bugs, just opportunities to make a good product even better.
Alpha and Beta Tests help the team to make sure that the product is meeting
its performance goals — in other words, that it performs as expected in the
customers’ hands. Teams also have to run tests to make sure that the prod-
uct won’t break if dropped or that it will withstand normal use over time.
Most companies have experts who can help the teams with this. (You can
find out more about product testing in Chapter 17.)
The checklist in Figure 9-2 asks the NPD team to document what it learned
during the phase it just completed. Documenting your newly found knowledge
is an excellent practice. It enables teams and managers to look backward and
forward. It provides a basis for continuous learning in order to improve the
product development process and practices. Each new product project
becomes an experiment in how to develop a product from which later pro-
jects can learn.
Reviewing from development to launch
The product development process should look like a funnel: More projects
should show up at the beginning than at the end. Reviewers have a chance at
every review to weed out projects that don’t perform as well as expected or
that no longer meet the company’s strategic objectives. However, after the
Feasibility Review, the “funnel” should straighten out. Reviewers should still
be on the lookout for projects that don’t measure up or projects that meet
unexpected market or technical hurdles. However, in most cases, as the pro-
ject moves from development and testing to launch, the team and the review-
ers have enough information to “see” from here to the market. The team
should concentrate on moving from development to market as fast and as
efficiently as possible.
For low-risk or quick projects, it’s often appropriate to set out-of-bounds crite-
ria (see Chapter 12). Under these criteria, management allows a team to pro-
ceed with few or even no reviews unless the project violates the conditions.
Out-of-bounds criteria include the range of acceptable likely market share,
project and product costs, and also changes to the product that may make it
hard or impossible to meet customer needs.
178
Part III: Navigating the River of Product Development 

In some companies, the phase reviews — especially the later ones, when the
product is becoming more and more “real” — can become more like technical
reviews. If you’re an executive who finds him- or herself more interested in
the technology than in the business, perhaps you need to focus on the part of
the company where your technical brilliance can be appreciated. But please
don’t use reviews as a chance to tinker with a product’s technical subtleties!
Some executive insight is appropriate, but you shouldn’t oversalt the soup.
Phase 4: Launch and Commercialization
The launch and commercialization phase is the last phase in the product
development process. After all, you can’t launch a product into the market
until you’ve designed it, developed it, tested it, and figured out how you’re
going to produce it.
Ideally, you should be thinking of prospective markets, of your target cus-
tomers, and of how you’ll get the product to your markets and customers
from the very beginning of the process. Too many NPD teams leave launch
planning until the end of the process. This is a mistake. You should have a
launch subteam working with your NPD team from the get-go. This is so
important that we devote a whole chapter to it — see Chapter 13.
When a product goes to market, the reputation of the company rides on its
shoulders. In addition, when a product goes to market, it takes its place
among the company’s other products and usually has an effect on them — it
might enhance customers’ perceptions of them, or do the opposite; it might
boost sales of other products, or it might cannibalize them.
Sometimes, even when the reviewers have been following the work of the
team closely, the team makes decisions during the late phases that change
the product enough that it doesn’t meet the reviewers’ expectations. For
example, a team may discover that it can add a great feature to a product, but
not be aware that the executives are planning a whole new product line cen-
tered on that feature. For these reasons, we strongly recommend that your
company’s executives hold a launch review.
The launch/commercialization phase brings the project to another critical
juncture. The work of the product development team is nearing completion,
but the project is, in some senses, just starting. Now’s the time when the
product goes to market to be judged by the court of the customer. A market-
ing manager or product manager — ideally someone who has worked as a
part of the NPD team from the beginning — should take over responsibility
so that the passage from development to market is as seamless as possible.

Making the Product Development 
Process Work for You
Every company we’re familiar with has developed its own product develop-
ment process. The process involves many different people in many different
roles. You have to deal with various interests and make various judgments
about what’s important and what isn’t. We strongly recommend that you
design a product development process that fits your company. Be sure to
involve the functions in the creation of your company’s NPD process (see the
section “Involving the Functions in the NPD Process”). After you’ve designed
the process, with input from as many different stakeholders as possible, you
can call it whatever you want.
Put someone in charge of making sure people are following the process and
of making changes (with input from others) when necessary. The person in
charge is usually an executive, or at least reports to an executive, and is often
called a process owner.
Many companies assign process owners for their product development
processes. The process owner is responsible for making sure the process is
successful and for changing and improving it over time. Check out Chapter 8
for more information on the process owner role.
In this section, we give you some tips about tailoring the product develop-
ment process so that it fits your company to a T.
If you walk in on Monday morning with a bright and shiny write-up of a new
product development process, and you tell everyone it’s time to wake up
about how to succeed in new product development, we can tell you one
thing: You’ll fail. If you want to improve how your company goes about devel-
oping new products, you need to gather many people to discuss what you
need to do. What are your organization’s (and process’s) strong and weak
points? What parts of the process do you need to improve, and what’s okay
the way it is? The process you develop with your colleagues may look like a
camel rather than a horse, but it will get much more care and feeding, and
much more use, than the slick thoroughbred that no one likes.
Note: If you develop products, you have a product development process.
When you design your new one, build on the tacit process that everyone
already follows, and improve on it.

Part III: Navigating the River of Product Development 

Right-sizing the process for your company
The right number of phases for your company’s product development
process equals the number of phases you need to divide the workflow into
logical chunks. Well, how many is that? Most product development processes
have between four and seven phases. At a minimum, no matter what kind of
products you produce or what industry you do business in, you need the fol-
lowing basic phases in your process:
 A front end or concept phase: The front end phase is where you
develop ideas or concepts. Many companies now have a Phase Zero,
because years ago, when they designed their product development
processes, they didn’t appreciate the importance of the earliest phases.
The front end is where a company’s leaders select from a large variety of
product development options. You need a front end phase; without it,
your company will probably end up with few development options.
 A business case phase: The product development process allows man-
agement to make business decisions about how to invest the company’s
resources. The business case phase provides executives with critical
information so that they can get their jobs done. No matter what type of
product you develop — chemicals, crackers, software, or services —
your company’s leaders must have business case information.
 A development and testing phase: The NPD team has to get its work
done to design, develop, and test the product concept. This basic phase
is where the greatest variability comes in with respect to the phases:
• If your product is fairly straightforward (for example, an improve-
ment to a product or product line that’s already in the market),
181
Chapter 9: One Foot in Front of the Other: The PDP Process
Being the product developer of your 
product development process
Installing a new product development process
for your company isn’t unlike producing a new
product. You need to understand your cus-
tomers’ spoken and unspoken needs (see
Chapter 4) — in this case, the customer is your
company. You need to generate ideas that can
meet your customers’ needs (see Chapter 5),
and you need to understand the capabilities that
you can use as you develop the solutions (see
Chapter 7). You need to narrow down the
process options and choose the best ones (see
Chapters 6 and 8). You may even discover that
you can mold a process quicker, better, and
cheaper if you go outside your company for help.

you may need only one phase to lay out the deliverables for this
stage of the process.
• If your product is complex, needs to be manufactured, or requires
the development of processes, it may be a good idea to add dis-
tinct phases or subphases. An example of this kind of product
would be a new product, such as the iPod, that requires new tech-
nology to be developed and that meets new customer needs.
• If your product requires extensive testing to meet regulatory or
other requirements, you may include phases that tie directly to
that requirement. Pharmaceutical development processes, for
example, usually include a phase called “Clinical Trials” because
conducting clinical trials is such a major issue in getting a drug
into the market.
• If you’re producing software, your process needs to allow for the
iterative “design/test/design” process that typically goes with soft-
ware development. On the other hand, your process doesn’t have
to specify a manufacturing phase, because after you design,
develop, and test your product, it’s good to go.
So, you need at least one phase for your product’s design, development,
and testing, but the number of phases varies depending on your product
and your industry.
 A commercialization or launch phase: Every product that gets all the
way through the development process needs to end up in a phase that
precedes its entry into the market — the launch or commercialization
phase. You need this phase at the end of your product development
process, but you also need to start the activities and planning for launch
early — see Chapter 13 to find out what’s involved.
Deciding how many reviews to hold
Reviews connect the ongoing work of the NPD team with the business acumen
of executives. How many reviews should you include in your product develop-
ment process? For sure, you need a review that kicks the project off — the
review that follows the front end or concept phase (see the section “The
Concept Review”) — and you need a review that assesses the business merits
of the project — the business case or Feasibility Review (see “Conducting the
Feasibility Review” earlier in this chapter). Finally, you should hold a review
before you launch the product into the market. That’s a “point of no return,”
and both the NPD team and the company’s leadership should be comfortable
with the decision to go to market.
As long as you complete those reviews, many projects can proceed to market
without other reviews — as long as the projects continue to meet the objectives
in the business cases. The following list points out when you should have
more reviews:
182
Part III: Navigating the River of Product Development 

 You’ve built a business case, but the project has major uncertainties.
The reviewers may decide to recycle the project while the team gathers
more information (see the section “The Concept Review”), or they may
ask for a review at the conclusion of the next phase.
 The project will cost significantly more as development proceeds. You
may have to pay for expensive testing, for example, if you develop
drugs. You may have to cover capital outlays for process or manufactur-
ing facilities. Or perhaps you have to enter into contracts with vendors
and suppliers. You should schedule reviews to precede such outlays to
give reviewers the chance to make decisions based on “options” —
“we’ll invest this much, but then we want to review our options.”
 The project must pass outside hurdles. If a product has to meet regula-
tory requirements, such as environmental permits or FDA approvals,
you should schedule reviews to make sure that project is on course.
 The project breaks new ground. If you’re working on a radical or break-
through product or technology (see Chapter 2), you should hold reviews
after every process phase. Radical products impact your company’s
infrastructure and capacities. They may engage your company in new
markets and in relationships with new suppliers and partners (see
Chapters 3 and 16). They may have an impact on your company’s brand.
Such projects should always move with due diligence through your
phase/review process.
Because each new product project has its own particular situation and needs,
your NPD team and the company’s reviewers should outline the reviews they
feel are necessary for the project instead of relying on review guidelines that
“fit” all projects. The best time to do this is at the Feasibility Review, when
the team has gathered enough information to make an informed decision
about which reviews should be required.
The NPD team members or the reviewers should never hesitate to call for a
review meeting when, in their opinions, the project’s situation has changed
since the last review. New information may lead to new decisions. (Also see
Chapter 12 for out-of-bounds criteria that may lead teams or reviewers to call
for an unscheduled review.)
Involving the Functions 
in the NPD Process
The product development process doesn’t come equipped with its own
resources. You must draw on resources that typically are “owned” by the
business functions in your company: R&D, marketing, manufacturing, cus-
tomer service, and so on.
183
Chapter 9: One Foot in Front of the Other: The PDP Process

The business functions can be barriers to product development. They have
their own priorities, and for many of them, developing new products may not
be on the top of the list. Even the “D” in R&D — the research and develop-
ment function — has to be enrolled into working with other functions to
develop new products. The functions provide the expertise and the people
power that make the process tick — all the things we collapse together when
we talk about “project resources.” For product development to work as well
as it can in your company, be sure to pay attention to WIIFM — “what’s in it
for me” — as the functions cooperate to develop new products.
“How will my function benefit?”
Why should a functional leader provide valuable resources for a cross-func-
tional NPD activity? Functional heads always have important things to do to
achieve functional goals, after all, and no one has extra resources to give away.
The members of the management team need to make the necessity and value
of supporting the development of new products absolutely clear to the func-
tional heads. Your company’s executives must measure the contribution of
the functions to its new product development objectives and assess the func-
tions (and the functional heads) based on that evaluation (see Chapter 18 for
more on NPD metrics). In addition, executives should tie the ability of the
functions to grow and thrive — to get needed resources — to the contributions
184
Part III: Navigating the River of Product Development 
Teams and functions need the big picture
When co-author Beebe Nelson was consulting
at Polaroid, one of her first assignments was to
compile what she called “The Big Picture
Briefing.” She wrote the briefing for people who
worked as team leaders or team members on
new product development projects. Beebe vis-
ited all the functional heads in the company to
find out how, in their opinions, their functions
connected to product development. She also
inquired about how product development team
members and team leaders should contact the
functional heads, and when in the development
process the functions played key roles.
It was a fascinating project that delivered two
outcomes (in addition to being a terrific learn-
ing experience for Beebe). First, it gave the
product development teams a better sense of
when to go to the functional leaders and what
they may expect from them. Second, and
equally important, it gave the functions a
chance to define their relationships to the com-
pany’s product development effort.

the functions make to new product development. (For more on obtaining
resources from the functions, see Chapter 11.)
Setting clear NPD objectives (see Chapter 3) and a clear technology develop-
ment path (see Chapter 7) are tasks that link the functions to product devel-
opment. Without such clarity, the functions can easily ignore the complexities
of NPD and sink into the comfort of setting their own agendas. You need to
involve the functions in creating these goals and paths so they know how they’ll
benefit from the process, and so that management can assess the functions
and the process by how well the goals and paths are accomplished.
Tailoring functional processes 
to support NPD
Each function has its own processes — ones probably designed years ago —
that fit its culture and its business needs quite well. You can’t just go to a
function and ask politely whether the function heads would mind changing
everything just to develop a new product. For sure, the functional leader
would mind!
You need to involve the functions in the design and creation of the product
development process. You should get their suggestions to tailor the develop-
ment process to fit their needs as well as it can and to tailor the functional
processes to support NPD. (That’s why you include members from the func-
tions when you’re designing a product development process for your com-
pany; see “Making the Product Development Process Work for You” earlier in
this chapter.)
You’ll run into some pitfalls when you address the relationship of the func-
tional processes to new product development. With each pitfall, however,
comes an opportunity to put the functions and the NPD efforts on the same
page. Here are a few pitfalls, along with opportunities to fix them:
Pitfall: Human resources (HR) has no career path or reward system for
employees who participate in new product development.
Opportunity: Help HR design ways to recognize and reward employees
who contribute to this important enterprise.
Pitfall: The finance department has no tools to track numbers that are
important to product developers (such as time spent by functional mem-
bers on new product teams).
185
Chapter 9: One Foot in Front of the Other: The PDP Process

Opportunity: Work with finance to develop accounting systems that are
in sync with product development.
Pitfall: Information Technology (IT) doesn’t have a flexible Intranet
system designed to allow new product team members to communicate
and share their data.
Opportunity: Introduce IT to some of the many Intranet systems that 
professionals are developing to work with their existing information
processes. (See Chapter 14 for more information about IT’s role in prod-
uct development.)
Pitfall: Your budgets are locked for the year, so projects that manage-
ment approves for development outside of the designated fiscal year
have to beg, borrow, and steal to get resources.
Opportunity: Work with the finance department to find a creative way to
store resources so that you can allocate them as projects make their way
into and through the NPD process.
Relating to Management 
during the NPD Process
The new product development process ties the work of your product devel-
opment team to the goals and objectives set by your company’s manage-
ment. The process, from idea to market, requires team members to think like
business people and like engineers, marketers, and so on. The business case
that your team develops (see this chapter’s earlier section “Phase 2: The
Business Case Phase”) puts the argument for developing a product concept
in a language that executives can understand, and it offers evidence that
shows how the concept relates to the company’s business objectives.
In this next section, you read about how to recognize the political activities in
NPD. Part of managing the politics is including the voices of all the functions
in designing the product development processes. In this way, more of the
people involved have a chance to discuss, bargain, and negotiate in ways that
encourage them to identify and work toward similar goals.
How do I manage the politics of NPD?
Of course you don’t have politics in your company. You’re running a busi-
ness, after all, and each employee is focused on improving the business, not
on jockeying for position. Really? If so, please give us a call; we want to do a
research paper on your unique firm!
186
Part III: Navigating the River of Product Development 

Remember this: If people are gathered together, politics is involved. This
statement is especially true in product development because the process
involves so many different groups and interests, and a business has to spend
scarce resources that functions may want to keep for their own purposes.
The more the processes take the functional differences into account, the
better the functions will be able to work together.
Stephen Markham of North Carolina State University and Patricia Holahan of
Stevens Institute of Technology have researched the issue of politics in new
product development. They make an important and interesting point: Not
only is product development “political” — that is, it involves the transfer of
power and influence among people and groups — but it also represents the
transfer of functional power to the NPD teams, the process owners, and
others who are charged with developing new products.
Markham and Holahan describe the following places where product develop-
ment tends to be politicized. It’s in these critical areas that management and
product developers need to be alert in order to manage the politics:
 Differences in goals between the business functions, the new product
development enterprise as a whole, and the individual NPD teams
 The scarcity of resources that management can allocate to achieve the
different goals
 The interdependency of the functions, the NPD enterprise, and the NPD
teams, which can cause conflict over resources
 The ambiguity of product development efforts, which can put leaders
and employees in the position of arguing over opinions rather than facts
 The vulnerability of the product development process, and of product
development projects, to organizational change
Understanding and managing these critical aspects within the product devel-
opment enterprise can help functional leaders and product developers iden-
tify the causes of inappropriate political behavior and reach solutions that
achieve both parties’ goals. (For more on the politics of NPD, see The PDMA
Handbook of New Product Development, 2nd Edition [Wiley] and take a look at
Chapter 10.)
The book was originally published decades ago, but Roger Fisher and William
Ury’s slim volume on negotiation, Getting to Yes (Houghton Mifflin), should be
required reading for all businesspeople. If you’re enmeshed in the politics of
new product development, pick up a copy and read through it to nail down
the basics of negotiation. It can help you with your spouse, your tennis part-
ner, and anyone else you want to negotiate agreements with!
187
Chapter 9: One Foot in Front of the Other: The PDP Process

Tailoring business processes 
to support NPD
The business processes that provide a structure in which companies make
decisions — the budgeting process, the strategy process, and so on — can
support product development or get in its way. In order to support product
development, business processes must accommodate the way in which new
product projects create their own time frames, and they must have an urgency
for getting work done and making decisions so that products can get to
market on time and on budget.
Many companies design business processes to work on an annual calendar.
They hold strategic planning sessions annually and review them quarterly.
Their budget cycles tend to be annual. They hold personnel reviews yearly.
This logic hails from the way our ancestors, who worked in the agricultural
business, tied their work cycles to the seasons — you completed tasks at 
the same time every year, from spring to summer to fall to winter. Seasonal
cycles work fine for most business processes, but they don’t work well for
product development. New product projects can’t always wait until the next
budget meeting or strategy cycle.
The companies that successfully support product development provide for
the eccentricity of new product decision-making by making time for reviews
and decisions that fall outside the “normal” calendar.
Understanding and Managing NPD Risk
The development of new products is one of the riskiest (and most rewarding)
activities that a company can take on. Of course, it’s not really as risky as not
developing new products, but the risk entailed in NPD happens today, while
falling behind competitors and becoming a nonentity in markets the company
used to own happens slowly — maybe even on someone else’s watch.
In many chapters throughout the book, we talk about the balance of risk and
reward in new product targets and in new product portfolios (see Chapters 3
and 11). In this section, we look at how the product development process
helps companies manage and mitigate the risk of developing new products.
Preparing for risk
Here’s a paradox: As a new product team, you want to write the best busi-
ness case you can (see the section “Phase 2: The Business Case Phase”) for
188
Part III: Navigating the River of Product Development 

management’s review. You want to do the best job you can to produce the
best product you can. But you also have another very important job: Being
aware of the uncertainties and the risks of the project. You have to let man-
agement know about the risks to the project that you foresee and how you
plan to mitigate those risks. If you come to the conclusion that you can’t drive
them down sufficiently, you may have to recommend that management stop
the project.
The following list presents a simple method for a product development team
to get a handle on risk. Like many of our suggestions in this book, it entails a
team meeting, a facilitator, a big wall chart, sticky notes, and felt-tip pens!
1. Brainstorm a list of the possible sources of risk in your new product
project.
Here’s a short sample list:
• Technology not ready when needed
• Key resources missing
• Prototype unable to meet customer needs
• Product cost too high to meet desired price point
To read about the rules and processes of brainstorming, see Chapter 5.
2. Group and label the sources of risk.
For example, you may have a category called “technology risk” and
another called “possible competitor moves.”
3. Through a group discussion, give each source group a ranking: How
likely is this to happen, and how serious would the consequences be?
Usually, the best approach is to use a simple scale. For example, you can
rank both likeliness and seriousness as low, medium, and high. It’s very
helpful to anchor these rankings with more detail. You may say, “A low
ranking means that this is very unlikely to happen; a medium ranking
means that we have to be on the lookout for it; and a high ranking means
that we should be implementing risk management right away.”
This method gives you the basics for managing the risk of a new product pro-
ject. Assign someone to make a document to preserve the team’s thinking by,
for example, uploading the data to an Excel file. Set up regular times to
review the risk-assessment document during the development process, and
call meetings whenever something changes. Also, you should use the risk-
assessment document when you’re preparing for the next review in the devel-
opment process. If your team has an Intranet page, include the risk document
and encourage everyone to refer to it frequently.
189
Chapter 9: One Foot in Front of the Other: The PDP Process

Using the NPD process to increase 
knowledge and decrease risk
In its simplest form, the new product development process is a way to get
from a point where you know nothing except that you want to develop a new
product to a point where you’ve designed, developed, tested, and marketed a
product and can now sit back and count the cash. The process takes you
from a place of near total uncertainty to the relative certainties of market
share, cash flows, margins, and profits — that is, until you decide that the
product line needs refreshing or the model needs to be updated, and then
there you go again.
In every phase of the process and at every review you conduct, your NPD
team has a chance to find out more information to reduce uncertainty. Will
this technology work the way we thought it would? Will this additional fea-
ture please our customers? Will consumers find our product attractive
enough to choose it over competitive offerings in this important market?
Your NPD team uses product testing, market research, and other activities to
ask questions about the product, design experiments to answer the ques-
tions, carry out those experiments, and improve the product based on the
answers (see Chapter 17). Rather paradoxically, one of the most important
things the team must gain knowledge about is risk. In the previous section,
we give you a way to understand risk. Never, never turn your face from risk!
That’s the riskiest thing you can do, no matter how tempting it is.
The product development process gives your NPD team an explicit way to
understand the risks you should be looking for in each part of the develop-
ment process. Early on, for example, you need to address technical risk: Will
we be able to design and build this product? When you have a sample prod-
uct, or a prototype, you have to address the risk that it won’t appeal to your
customers.
Sometimes, you go to market with major risks still “on the books.” And some-
times, that’s okay. The development process helps you to face the risks; the
team members and reviewers must decide, after the team has reduced the
risk as far as it can, whether the company is willing to bear that risk in the
market.

 Organizing the teams within the product development team
T
o be successful at new product development, you need to gather skills,
experiences, and insights from all over your organization. This isn’t like
running a relay race, where people with all the same skills and training can
achieve a common goal. No one functional area alone can accomplish the
complex task of creating a new product and bringing it to market.
In this chapter, we show you how to assemble a cross-functional team — a
team composed of members from different functional areas whose knowledge
and expertise are needed in the new product development process. We explain
how to recruit members who possess the necessary knowledge and talents;
how to help the team work well together; and how to anticipate the changing
needs of a new product project as it moves from idea to market. We also
address the organizational structures that can help NPD teams realize the
most success.
Getting a team — even a cross-functional team — to work together effectively
isn’t all that hard. More often than not, organizational brick walls, rather than
a team’s ineptitude, cause new product failures. For your NPD teams to be suc-
cessful, they must have the support and resources they need from your organi-
zation. (For more on involving management in NPD processes, see Chapter 11.)
What Makes Teams Fly?
People in the business world — heck, even people in the sports or board-
game-playing world — have come to a widespread agreement about what

makes teams work well. The following list presents the characteristics that
most everyone would include:
 The team has shared goals and objectives. The team should have an
explicit mission or vision, and its goals and objectives should be expressed
so that all members can agree when they’ve reached an endpoint.
Here’s a good place to bring up SMART objectives. Team goals and
objectives should be specific, measurable, actionable, realistic, and
time-bound. If the team members follow this rule, they know what to do,
that it can be done, and when they’ve achieved it.
 Team members have clear roles and work assignments. For a team to
work well together, its members need to make all the work assignments
explicit. Most teams create a project plan that spells out deadlines to
achieve both interim and end goals. Team members must agree on the
role each team member will play and the specific tasks each team
member is responsible for.
 The team holds itself mutually accountable for the work of the whole
team. No member whose team is functioning well sits back and says, “I
did my bit. Now it’s up to the others.” Good teamwork depends on a bal-
ance of individual and mutual accountability, which may be expressed
as both “How can I help?” and “I’m getting behind. Can you help?”
 The team, not the individual, succeeds or fails. If you need a team to
accomplish your goal, you need to realize that your success is the
team’s success, and the team’s is yours. All team members need to
check their Lone Ranger masks at the door.
 The team has effective leadership. Cross-functional teams may have
single leaders or shared leadership. In either case, the leaders keep an
eye out to make sure that the team has a clear mission and goals, and
that all team members have clear roles and work assignments. The lead-
ers are also responsible for the softer stuff: that the team members are
in this together, working not as a collection of individuals, but as a real
team.
Team leaders have a wider responsibility than other team members.
They assess the capacity of their teams to accomplish their goals; they
provide what’s missing; and they bring breakdowns to the attention of
their teams or to management if the teams can’t solve the problems on
their own.
Several other factors allow teams to be as effective as they can be, including
diversity, ground rules, good meeting behavior, and the support of managers
who commissioned the teams and count on their output. We review all these
ingredients as we discuss what’s special about new product teams in the next
section.
192
Part III: Navigating the River of Product Development 

Understanding Why Cross-Functional
Teams Are Special
Unlike new product development teams, most business teams are made up of
people with the same or similar roles in the company. Manufacturers work
with other manufacturers, engineers huddle with other engineers, and so on.
People from similar positions share a language and a common set of concerns.
They’ve had similar experiences in their work and their education. When
these types of teams come together, their members find it relatively easy to
agree on a mission, objectives, and the work roles of the team members. The
group may share common beliefs about what makes a leader effective and
how members should behave in meetings. They often have an unspoken con-
sensus about “how it’s done around here.”
We don’t mean to imply that teams with shared experiences are always as effec-
tive as possible, but those teams do start with some advantages — especially
compared to the hodge-podge of expectations, backgrounds, and so on
within a cross-functional new product development team.
Cross-functional teams are different from most business teams in the follow-
ing ways:
 Team members have different experiences, different expectations,
and different ways of working that they consider “normal.” Here’s an
example: Marketers stay up later than engineers and manufacturers and
may object when the team wants to meet at 7 a.m.
 The team must draw resources from many different “control centers”
instead of being commissioned by a single manager. When one man-
ager controls the team’s resources and is committed to the team’s
results, the team has one go-to person. On cross-functional teams, the
team leader may have to beg, borrow, or steal to obtain the resources
the team needs. How hard it is to hear from a manufacturing manager,
“No, you can’t use our manufacturing line to test the new product. We
have to build the inventory for next year’s ski season.”
Some companies commission heavyweight or “tiger” teams, teams
which control their own resources and often have their own location
away from “business as usual.” When the project is large and important
to the company, this structure helps to ensure that the team will have
the resources it needs.
 The executives commission the NPD team to carry out the task of devel-
oping a new product; upon completion of the task, most team mem-
bers return to their former roles, and the team’s output may have
193
Chapter 10: Organizing the NPD Troops

little effect on the members’ next jobs. Working on a cross-functional
NPD team doesn’t always add to a team member’s status “back home.” We
hope the following tale never happened, but we’ve heard similar stories:
“A team member from packaging staked his career on a new product
project he was working on. He did a terrific job. Everyone on the team
agreed that the packaging design had made a great contribution to the
product’s success in the market, even though the company’s packaging-
as-usual was pretty fair to terrible. After the project ended, the team
member returned to his function, where he was penalized for making
changes to the way his peers went about designing packaging. ‘What
have you done?’ they asked. ‘Now they’ll be breathing down our backs
and asking for stuff like this all the time!’”
Cross-functional teams are essential to the success of a company’s NPD
efforts. However, the company has organized itself to accomplish functional
tasks. When a team cuts across these organizational boundaries, it needs spe-
cial “care and feeding.” It thrives on all the same practices, such as good lead-
ership, that nurture functional teams, but it also needs special conditions to
ensure that the team is effective. In the next sections, we discuss the special
and the regular conditions that support cross-functional team success.
Leading Cross-Functional Teams
Leading a cross-functional new product development team requires a delicate
balance of traditional leadership skills — setting direction, making decisions,
evaluating the work of the team, and so on — and facilitative leadership skills —
enabling the team members to set direction and make decisions collabora-
tively, coaching and mentoring team members, and so on. In cross-functional
teams, the facilitative skills are critically important because of the different
backgrounds of the team members. Note: Good team leaders sometimes add
facilitators if their skills aren’t top-notch. This approach can work extremely
well because the facilitator can also act as a coach for the leader.
194
Part III: Navigating the River of Product Development 
Same isn’t always better
Sometimes, teams with the most diversity can
be the most effective. Peter Carcia, a new prod-
uct developer at Polaroid, once led a team com-
posed of Japanese and American workers. He
believes that team made the fewest costly
assumptions of any team he had ever been
associated with because no members assumed
that they knew what anyone else meant. The
team members constantly pushed to clarify
goals, deliverables, work plans, product speci-
fications, and so on. And the work went
smoothly compared to the work of teams whose
members think they’re communicating but in
fact are not. As George Bernard Shaw warned,
“The greatest danger in communication is the
illusion that it has been achieved.”

In addition to these skills, the cross-functional team leader must lead the
team through the thorny underbrush of competing functional priorities. The
leader must have good political skills. Within this political sphere, the team
leader’s job description includes the following:
 Negotiating with forces outside the team to get resources
 Aligning the team’s objectives with management’s objectives and busi-
ness strategy
Take a look at Chapter 9 for more on navigating the political terrain.
The good cross-functional team leader should possess healthy doses of the
characteristics we list here. All good team leaders possess these same char-
acteristics, but the special nature of cross-functional teams makes them even
more important:
 Team-oriented: Good team leaders strongly believe that the teams suc-
ceed or fail and that their job is to make sure their teams are doing top-
notch work. Unlike the superhero leader who rushes in and insists on
doing the job herself, the good NPD leader prefers the often more diffi-
cult task of facilitating and coaching; she knows that in the end, this
approach will produce the best results. (See Chapter 8, where we make
the same point about the leadership of the organization!)
A corollary to this characteristic is that good NPD team leaders realize
they don’t have all the answers. Typically, team leaders are marketers or
engineers, although good leaders have come from manufacturing, design,
and any number of other functions. No one function can develop a new
product alone; therefore, no team leader — no matter her background —
can have all the answers. A good team leader knows this in her gut.
 Goal-oriented: A good NPD team leader is passionately committed to
the goals of her team. She’ll go the extra mile to make sure her team gets
the proper support from management. She’ll inspire and push her team,
making realistic but ambitious demands for completing tasks and for
finding better solutions.
 Nurturing: A good NPD team leader takes care of her team. She doesn’t
push the members too far or judge their performances by the number of
hours they put in or how many Saturdays she sees their cars in the park-
ing lot. NPD is a critical function for a company — one that needs long-
term nurturing. The team leader can’t approach the work of her NPD
team like a “make-or-break,” just-this-once job.
We’ve seen far too many NPD teams stretched to the point, or past the
point, of breaking. When management pushes an NPD team to its limits,
expecting team members to work far too many hours to meet unrealistic
goals and withholding resources without changing the project schedule,
it may bring a project in on time and on budget, but it makes it harder and
harder for a company to field excellent NPD teams. The kind of leadership
195
Chapter 10: Organizing the NPD Troops

that pushes teams too hard exhausts resources instead of building
capacity. Take a look at Chapter 11 for ways to make sure that projects
in the product development pipeline are adequately resourced.
 A realist: An important part of a team leader’s job is to continually encour-
age her team to look at the dark side — the empty half of the glass. Too
often, in their enthusiasm for the project and their desire to succeed,
NPD teams assume they can produce needed inventions on schedule, or
that customers will love their products even though they haven’t done
the needed market research to make sure that they will. These kinds of
assumptions get teams into real trouble as they skate onto the thin ice
of making promises to management that they ultimately can’t fulfill. (In
Chapters 9 and 12 we talk more about why a team needs to understand
the risks and make them explicit.) The responsibility of making sure that
team members don’t sweep difficulties and risks under the rug falls on
the team leader.
 Willing to take responsibility: The NPD team leader takes charge of
developing and presenting a business case that will convince manage-
ment to support a project — or not (see Chapter 12). The team members
are integral parts of this effort, but most of the responsibility belongs to
the team leader.
The company’s top leaders should always be on the lookout for employees
who may excel at leading NPD teams. They don’t grow on trees, but they can
be developed. Executives should recognize people who have the characteris-
tics of good, even great, cross-functional team leaders and nurture them so
they can go on to bigger and better NPD projects.
Taking the “Cross” Out of 
Cross-Functional Teams
Cross-functional team leaders need to possess the characteristics of good
team leaders; we list those characteristics in the previous section. Companies
that are committed to NPD success develop such team leaders. They also work
at developing employees who will be great team members. Almost anyone in a
function can wind up on a cross-functional team, but smart companies under-
stand what makes for really good cross-functional teaming, and they develop
people to have the traits that take the “cross” out of cross-functional teaming.
Here are some of the traits of good, even great, cross-functional team members:
 Demonstrated competence in their functional area: NPD team members
bring their function’s knowledge and expertise to the cross-functional
196
Part III: Navigating the River of Product Development 

team, so they need to be good at what they do back home in the func-
tion in order to make a contribution to the team. It also helps if others
respect their competence so that they don’t have to fight to get people
to listen and to believe them.
 Ability to work with different kinds of people: Cross-functional NPD
team members have to work with people from different functions, which
means they have to be able to work well with different cultures. After all,
the engineering culture and the marketing culture are about as different
as cultures can get! In addition to cultural diversity — functional and
other — NPD team members differ in personality and style. (As you can
read in Chapter 5, this diversity is a good thing, because it increases a
team’s chances of being creative. However, it can also make communica-
tion difficult.)
A team leader doesn’t have to count on team members arriving with the
ability to work in a diverse group. Team training can help its members to
practice respecting and appreciating differences and capitalizing on the
opportunities that diversity affords.
Here are some things that management can do to develop cross-func-
tional team skills in their company:
• Provide training for people who will end up on teams
• Enlist the human resource function in keeping a record of who has
spent time on cross-functional teams
• Make sure that every team has a balance of experienced, less-expe-
rienced, and sometimes even totally inexperienced members
 Independent thinkers and doers: Because NPD teams often include only
one member from each function (marketing, manufacturing, and so on),
each team member has to be the voice of his function; if he allows other
team members to drown him out, the team misses his function’s contri-
bution, and the project suffers.
 Good listening skills: In addition to being able to clearly and effectively
represent their points of view, NPD team members need to use active lis-
tening skills so they can understand other members’ points of view.
Good listening skills are a key feature of being open-minded!
 Ability to negotiate: Standing for personal convictions and listening gen-
erously to the convictions of others are prerequisites of having good
negotiation skills. Team members use negotiation skills in order to effec-
tively present a functional point of view and argue for its place in the NPD
team’s plans. Negotiation skills also are necessary because team mem-
bers have to make their functional resources available to the team’s pro-
ject. (We talk more about the importance of negotiation in Chapter 9.)
197
Chapter 10: Organizing the NPD Troops

Preparing for Engagement: Assembling
and Equipping Your NPD Team
Like most athletes or scholars, good product development teams are made,
not born. The people responsible for chartering NPD teams need to pay
attention to the skills, talents, and personalities of the people whom they
appoint to carry out a project.
Who’s responsible for chartering NPD teams? This question has almost as
many answers as there are companies that develop new products. The issue
is a thorny one. In Chapters 8 and 11, we cover how companies select and
resource new product projects. A critical responsibility of the corporate lead-
ers who select these projects is to be sure that they also charter a team to
carry the project out — or that they have clearly designated someone to
carry out that important task.
Although the best teams include all the characteristics of good leaders and
members that we talk about in the previous sections, you can’t find a substi-
tute for experience. Don’t forget that you’re also building the competence to
carry out NPD projects, and that each time an employee participates on an
NPD team, he or she should come away better prepared to be an even more
effective member of the next one.
In this section, you discover how to put together a good NPD team. You also
find out how to equip the team you assemble — with information and skills —
so it can function as well as possible.
Commissioning the troops, 
chartering the team
When should management assemble a cross-functional team to take on a new
product project? Take a look at the map of the product development process
on the Cheat Sheet at the front of this book. In this chapter, we focus on the
cross-functional team that develops the product in the river of development,
but knowing multiple places where cross-functional teams should or could be
used is also important. The following list gives you this information:
 In the ocean of opportunity: Savvy executives and functional leaders are
willing to put resources behind searching for opportunities. In Chapter 4,
you see how cross-functional teams set sail to visit with customers and
explore what solutions might work best for them, and in Chapter 7 you
find out how cross-functional teams inventory technology.
 In the river of development: After a new product project passes the
Idea and Concept Screens, the company’s leaders should charter a full
198
Part III: Navigating the River of Product Development 

cross-functional team to write the business plan and carry out the devel-
opment tasks. This team may be the same as the one that sailed the
oceans looking for the opportunity, or it may be different. Here are two
reasons why the team may be different:
• The personality characteristics of good explorers don’t always
translate well to the duties of good developers, so some of the
explorers may be set free to explore yet another opportunity.
• Almost always, after the project passes through these initial
screens, the team needs additional resources in order to do the
work of developing the product. We talk a lot more about that in
the next section.
 In the market: The map shows a pretty clear line between product devel-
opment and the market, but please take that with a grain or two of salt. In
Chapter 13, we describe how the team should make plans for launching
the new product during the development process instead of waiting until
the last phase. In many companies, a product manager, who’s responsible
for the success of the product in the market, uses cross-functional teams
to help discover and act on opportunities for improvements.
We’ve said it before, and we’ll say it again — senior management must explic-
itly charter cross-functional NPD teams. NPD is a political activity, and people’s
toes can get stepped on. We cover some of the political issues in Chapter 9, but
here we stress that without a clear charter, team members run the risk of being
pulled away from their NPD commitment to cover functional priorities.
You must charter a cross-functional team to carry out the tasks in the river of
development; we recommend that you charter teams in the ocean of oppor-
tunity and that you make cross-functional expertise available when the prod-
uct is in the market.
Combining necessary skills and experience
New product development teams have to go “where no man has gone
before.” They have to develop products that don’t yet exist. Therefore, we
can’t give you a simple formula to figure out what skills and experiences you
need for each and every team you assemble.
However, you can ask yourself the following questions; the answers will help
you identify the people resources you need:
 Does the product concept have to be designed, developed, tested, and
manufactured? If so, you need designers, engineers, quality personnel,
and manufacturing members on the team. But not all products need the
full gamut. When the new product is a service, you need to design and
test it; when it’s a software product, you can skip manufacturing.
199
Chapter 10: Organizing the NPD Troops

 When it gets to the market, will the product need to be serviced? If so,
get service technicians on the team.
 Will the product need special packaging? If so, someone from packag-
ing should be on the team.
 Does the product concept include software? If so, include an employee
with the skills to design the software.
 Are you developing a software product or service? If so, you can forget
manufacturing, but be sure to include an employee who will understand
the user interface or ergonomics.
 Do you expect complex channel or distribution issues? If so, include
someone from distribution on the team.
 Do you foresee complex regulatory or legal issues? If so, you need a
legal or regulatory expert on your team.
 Will you have to deal with a supply chain to provide parts of the prod-
uct? If so, you should include someone from purchasing on the team.
Every NPD team should include a marketing member. Every team needs
someone who has leadership skills and can lead the team. The team should
also have someone with good product planning skills and someone with 
good facilitator skills (see the earlier section “Taking the ‘Cross’ out of Cross-
Functional Teams” for more on general characteristics). Any of the functional
members can take on any, or even several, of these roles if they have the
skills. Some companies develop project management skills and assign some-
one with those skills to the more important teams.
Not all these NPD resources have to be on the core team (see the section
“The core team”); however, you need to be sure that their skills are available
when you need them so a delay won’t hold up the work of the team.
Getting everyone acquainted
On an NPD project, you can’t afford to leave “getting to know you” to chance.
Even if your team is made up of people from all over the world — and it may
very well be (see Chapter 15) — gathering everyone for an extended period
of time near the beginning of the project to get acquainted is usually worth
the expense.
A kick-off meeting is the perfect time to complete the following tasks:
 Create the project plan (explained in the next section) and the team’s
communication system.
 Discuss all applicable ground rules and protocols.
200
Part III: Navigating the River of Product Development 

 Hold any team training you think is important. For example, diversity
training is a great icebreaker for new teams and will help team members
work well together as they get into the project.
 Clarify any questions the team members have about how the project fits
within the business, technology, and market strategies of the company.
You can show the team what the company’s strategic drivers are, and
you can have representatives of business, technology, and marketing on
hand to answer questions. (See Chapter 3 for more on how a project
relates to strategy.)
 Introduce members to their customers. The customers don’t have to
show up in person, but make sure your team has a chance to steep itself
in everything you know about the customer. (See Chapter 4 for advice
on gathering customer information.)
The new product project’s executive sponsors should attend a part of this
first meeting. The team members need to hear how committed management
is to the project and get to know the sponsors. How involved will they be?
How should the team members communicate with them? Sponsors can
address all these questions at the first meeting.
Every new product project exists because leaders in the company have given
it their blessing. The larger and more important the project is, the more
important it is to make sure that those leaders stay involved with the project.
Some companies explicitly name “champions,” while others call on project
“sponsors.” But in your company, even if these people don’t have a name,
hold their feet to the fire when it comes to making sure the team knows why
this project is important to the company.
During this meeting, you should try to build in as much informal time as pos-
sible. The team should certainly stay together around the clock so they can
spend mealtime together. Can you also arrange for the members to attend a
ball game in the company’s suite? Can you go for a boat ride on a nearby
river? Can you set up leadership training in a nearby wilderness area? Use
resources you have available to try to mix in some fun.
Putting people on the same 
page with a project plan
A project plan includes the project mission, its key goals, and a time-based
schedule of activities for achieving the team goals. Good plans also include
an explicit assessment of project risk.
201
Chapter 10: Organizing the NPD Troops

A good project plan provides a great way to actively coordinate the work of
the NPD team. At every team meeting — that may mean as often as once a
week — the team reviews the status of the plan. This keeps all the team mem-
bers updated on the status of their work toward the team’s goals.
To build a project plan, follow these steps:
1. Review everything you know about the mission of the project. This
will include the following:
• The product concept or idea
• The customer requirements the team must meet in developing the
product
• The product definition, including any specifications that you’ve
identified at this point
• The relationship of the product to existing and planned technology
• The market information, including segments you’ll address, key
competitors, and marketing targets
• The strategic role you expect the product to play, including its
place in the product line and in the company’s product portfolio
• Key indicators of product quality to use when designing tests (the
indicators will include the identified customer requirements)
2. With a clear understanding of what the team wants to accomplish, you
can draft a team mission statement from the elements in Step 1. Here’s
an example:
“The Tailgater Team will develop a product that warns other drivers when
they are tailgating. Customer needs include highway safety and an expressed
concern on the part of parents regarding their teens’ driving habits. The
technology for this product is already developed. Use testing must demon-
strate contribution to highway safety, including absence of negative responses
from drivers who are ‘warned’. The team needs to establish markets for
this product outside the Northeast, where the concept has already received
good feedback. The product is being developed for after-market use.”
3. Using sticky notes, have the team members write down everything
they can think of that the team will need to do to develop the product.
This is often called work breakdown structure (WBS), and includes all the
tasks of all the functional areas.
4. When the team comes up with a hundred or so notes, you can stick
them all on a wall board or wall chart and group them based on type
of activity. For example, you can group them based on their relation to
marketing, manufacturing, design, and so on.
5. Have the team add anything they forgot and regroup the sticky notes
if necessary (sometimes a whole new area of work shows up in this
202
Part III: Navigating the River of Product Development 

second round!). Mark each note to show which group it belongs to,
because in the next step you sometimes lose track of the groupings.
6. Have the team order the sticky notes — or, in other words, the tasks —
in chronological order. To keep the sense of the groupings, you can
divide the wall chart or wall you’re working on into rows labeled for
each group — marketing, engineering, manufacturing, and so on. Even if
you do this, it’s still a good idea to label each note (see Step 5).
At this point, the team begins to identify dependencies — tasks that team
members can’t complete until they’ve accomplished something else. For
example, you can’t put a prototype product in customers’ hands for test-
ing until you’ve developed and built several of them. These dependen-
cies help to define the project’s critical path — exactly what tasks have
to be done and when. Without that information, you can’t manage the
complex tasks of developing a new product, let alone complete your pro-
ject on time and on budget.
In order to display the project plans at meetings, you need to have the plan in
a form that allows for displaying. You can use Microsoft Project or Excel to
document the plan, and you can display it by using an LCD projector and cap-
ture changes as they’re made. You also can load the plan to a team Intranet
site so that nobody has an excuse for blanking on the status of the project.
We suggest that, especially on large and complex projects, you include some-
one who’s familiar with the process of project planning and who understands
dependencies and critical paths on your NPD team. (The Project Management
Institute [www.pmi.org] can guide you through the intricacies of project
planning — and see Project Management For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Stanley
E. Portny [Wiley].)
Figuring out how to work, 
together and apart
NPD teams function in two modes: They do some of their work together, and
they do some of their work apart. This may seem obvious, but much of the
advice experts give you about how to develop effective teamwork focuses
only on the time when a team works together. The following sections break
down the two modes of work.
Embracing togetherness
When product development teams work together, they need to have good
meeting skills. Here’s what you need to hold effective meetings:
 A set time and a convenient place (which nowadays might be around
computer screens all across the world!)
 Clear communication to the team of the time and place
203
Chapter 10: Organizing the NPD Troops

 An agenda that leaders circulate to the members before the meeting so
that they can prepare
 A notetaker who circulates the meeting minutes and agreed on action
items to the team members after the meeting
NPD teams should meet regularly — preferably once a week. If the team mem-
bers are co-located, or at least in some geographical proximity, you should
have the meetings face to face; if that isn’t possible, team members should
come together, using some combination of Internet, phone lines, and video
lines. They take some practice, but remote meetings can be very effective
after members get used to them (see Chapter 14 for more on meeting tech-
nologies for dispersed teams).
Surviving time apart
Two big issues arise during the times when NPD teams work apart: account-
ability and communication. You want to be sure that team members agree to
carry out the necessary tasks — on time. And you don’t want your members
to lose contact with one another.
Here’s what the team needs in order to make sure that its members coordi-
nate their activities and tasks between face-to-face meetings:
 Clearly specify actions and accountabilities. Make sure that every
action has a clear doer, a clear by-when schedule, and a clear deliver-
able: “X will do Y by time Z.”
 Communicate to the team when a team/team members accomplish an
action. When a task is completed, the team member should post this
information where the rest of the team can see it, usually on an Intranet
site. If the team is meeting weekly to review the plan, members may not
need to communicate between meetings. But if you know that Joe down
the hall is waiting with bated breath for you to finish a piece of the design
so that he can move ahead with his task, by all means send him an e-mail,
pick up the phone, or — this is still a valid mode of communication! —
walk down the hall to his office and let him know he can go ahead.
The following tools help make sure that your team stays in constant 
communication:
 A team list that gives team members’ names and contact information
 A written agreement on communication protocols, including document
formats and handling of revisions
 If possible (in this century, why wouldn’t it be?), an Intranet site that
allows team members to deposit and access information
204
Part III: Navigating the River of Product Development 

Acquiring functional support
One of the most common reasons why NPD projects come in over budget or
late is that they simply don’t have the resources they need — money, man-
power, and so on. Team leaders need to make sure that executives know what
the teams need, and team members must negotiate with their own functions
to obtain the necessary resources. (In Chapter 11, we talk about manage-
ment’s responsibility to resource the NPD pipeline.)
Teams need to be clear about what resources they need, and they need to
ask for them. This is no time for hero behavior exhibited by proud silence, or
for what psychologists call “co-dependency.” When teams are underre-
sourced, the whole company can fall into a tailspin caused by what Nelson
Repenning at MIT calls “firefighting.” When new product development goes
into this kind of tailspin, executives pull resources from early-stage projects
to get late-stage projects to market on time and with the expected quality.
This action delays the early-stage projects, which then need even more
resources in order to get to market on time and meet quality targets. If this
cycle repeats, the organization falls into a situation from which it can’t
recover without drastically cutting its NPD pipeline.
Teams can make another mistake, other than staying silent, that makes it
hard to get the necessary resources. They leave too much to be invented or
solved late in the process. The point of a disciplined product development
process is to enable a team of mere mortals to carry out the innovation of a
new product. In Chapter 9, we discuss the importance of defining the product
early on in the process — the “fuzzy front end.” Don’t make the mistake of
thinking that a miracle will save you later on. You can’t blame management if
you agreed to carry out a project with “and then a miracle occurs” embedded
in the project plan.
Defining the Troops’ Roles 
and Responsibilities
How many employees does it take to develop a new product? Maybe not
quite as many as the number of licks it takes to get to the center of a lollipop,
but quite a few, nonetheless. NPD projects need firm and clear leadership on
the team as well as from executives, they need clear shared practices, and
they need access to groups that have the expertise needed to carry out the
actual work. NPD teams need to get a lot of work done — and it’s more com-
plex work than most small teams are expected to accomplish.
205
Chapter 10: Organizing the NPD Troops

Most companies make a distinction between the core team (you can call this
the “leadership team”) and the extended team (you can call this the “working
team”). We cover the basics of these teams in the sections that follow, includ-
ing who should make up the teams and what roles they play.
The core team
Members of the core team should have a big-picture understanding of the
new product project at hand — its strategic importance (see Chapter 3), the
customer needs it will fill (see Chapter 4), how it relates to the company’s
technology (see Chapter 7), and so on. The core team must ensure that as its
members and members of the extended team accomplish the project work,
the project stays on track and aligned with its set goals.
A core team member has three leadership responsibilities:
 She’s responsible, along with her teammates, for managing the big-pic-
ture work of the project. This includes the following tasks:
• Making the decisions about the direction and work of the project
• Keeping the project visible to top management
• Developing and maintaining the project’s business case
 She leads the extended functional team, whose members carry out the
project work that relates to her function (see the following section).
She must keep the extended functional team working and make sure its
work is aligned with the directions and decisions of the core team.
It’s extremely helpful to have clear, visual representations of the project
goals to keep extended teams on track. For example, you can incorpo-
rate tools that can stop a team from wasting time looking for solutions
that don’t connect specifically with project goals. One such tool, a tech-
nology map, shows how technical solutions link to customer needs (see
Chapter 7). A product requirement matrix shows how product specifica-
tions connect to customer needs (see Chapter 9).
 She must keep her function “in the loop.” A core team member should
stay in touch with her functional leaders to make sure they can resolve
any issues before they get out of hand (for example, an unanticipated
need for additional functional resources during a part of the project).
Before reviews, the functional team member will deliver the executive
summary to the functional head at a sit-down meeting to resolve any
issues. (See Chapter 12 for more on reviews.)
206
Part III: Navigating the River of Product Development 

The extended team
Each functional area of a company, from marketing to manufacturing, may
have significant work to do in order to accomplish a project’s goals. These
functions have to assign personnel and other resources to the project. The
members of the extended team work under the direction of the core team
members (see the previous section).
Extended team membership varies from project to project, depending on the
specific project needs that the core team identifies during its planning process.
The following list shows some examples (and see the section “Combining
necessary skills and experience”):
 Marketing: Personnel from marketing communications, market research,
and product management
 R&D: Software engineers, electrical and mechanical engineers, design-
ers, and optics
 Manufacturing: Personnel from contract manufacturing, purchasing,
materials management, and manufacturing engineering
In addition, the extended team may include support functions, such as finance,
human resources, and legal. If the function’s expertise is critical to the project,
the core team should include a member from that function. Often, however,
members of these functions can work with a core team member and be “on
call” when they’re needed. For example, if a project involves major intellectual
property (IP) issues (see Chapter 15), the core team should include a legal
expert. But all teams should identify a legal expert to help with routine legal
issues and to be available should knotty problems arise.
Organizing Your NPD Teams
Most modern businesses are structured like a series of silos, and each silo
controls significant percents of the corporation’s resources. Often, these silos
fill the corporation’s internal needs more than the needs of its markets. To
produce value for your customers — which is the goal of product develop-
ment activities — you have to cut across these silos (in other words, people
have to join hands, communicate, and collaborate across the functional
boundaries in the company). When you do that, you cut across, and into,
stuff (people, money, equipment, and so on) that each silo owns.
207
Chapter 10: Organizing the NPD Troops

In this section, you find out how to organize teams and maintain good work-
ing relationships to bandage the cuts that NPD projects can inflict.
We discuss some of the best ways to balance the needs of the team with the
needs of the functions. When a company puts too much emphasis on the
team, in effect separating it — and its members — from the functions, you
can’t expect the functions to spend too much energy building the resources
needed for NPD. On the other hand, if teams are too much under the many
functional thumbs, they have a tough time coming together and putting in the
effort needed to accomplish the project. So the key, if the company is com-
mitted to growing its NPD resources, is balance between functional needs
and team needs.
The following list presents the different kinds of team approaches you can
adopt. We explain their relationships to the functions, how they should be
led, and what kinds of projects they’re best suited for:
 The functional team: In the functional approach — often called an over
the wall team — management divides a project into its functional parts
and assigns the parts sequentially to one functional team after the other.
The functional approach is almost never a good way to develop any but
the most routine of new products, but if the NPD project is limited to a
slight change of an existing product, for example, this approach can work.
 The matrix team: The leadership (core) team shares responsibility with
the functional heads. They work together to establish the team’s objec-
tives, manage work flows, and resource the project. The matrix-team
format is appropriate when the new product project won’t deviate very
far from the company’s existing technologies and products. For example,
you may use this format for a platform upgrade or to revitalize a product
line, when the changes are reasonably straightforward.
 The project team: The core team and the team leader (see “The core
team” section earlier in this chapter) lead the project team. The core
team leaders negotiate with the company’s functions for resources and
turn to the functions for technical expertise. The project team format is
the “gold standard” of teaming approaches. It’s almost always the best
format for a project of any newness, importance, or size. The sugges-
tions for good teaming that we make in this chapter are almost always
with the project team in mind. We like this format the best for several
reasons, including the following:
• The project team is more autonomous than the matrix team.
Although they negotiate with the functions, the functions expect to
turn resources over to them to be used as the team wishes. The
team isn’t constrained by how the functional leaders would want
or expect these resources to be used.
• The project team can turn to the functions for needed expertise,
but they’re also more likely than the matrix team to go outside if
the functions don’t have what they need. This can help overcome
208
Part III: Navigating the River of Product Development 

the functions’ typical negative response to outside expertise, often
called NIH — not invented here.
 The tiger team: Sometimes, a company wants to develop a product that
differs greatly from its existing technologies and products. In projects
that call for radical or breakthrough products, some companies form
special teams that they empower to work quite independently. Like the
project team, a team leader and core team lead the team. The teams are
often located away from the existing business, which helps the teams be
more creative and keeps the companies from trying to rein them in.
The tiger-team approach is sometimes called “ambidextrous.” The right hand
and the left hand are both up to something, but the right hand (the team)
doesn’t know what the left hand (the company) is doing — and vice versa.
If your company plans to depend on the over-the-wall team approach to
develop new products, you’ll probably be a very ineffective and me-too prod-
uct developer. It’s almost impossible to develop a great product that will
really please your customers when the team that’s responsible for the devel-
opment isn’t communicating. Sorry! If your company uses a balance of the
matrix and project team approaches, good for you. You give your new prod-
uct teams the resources and independence they need, and you still build
technical expertise in the functions, where it belongs. With a combination of
these approaches, you also build the political base for effective negotiation
between teams and functions (see Chapter 9). Both approaches work to build
your capacity to be effective — even excellent — at developing new prod-
ucts. And when you launch a really new, complex, and risky project, consider
the tiger team approach.
If your company is planning to use the tiger-team approach, we suggest you
be judicious. This approach often leads to NPD success, due in large part to the
commitment and excitement it generates among team members. But for the
same reasons, it tends to drain the team members and often has one of two
effects on them: Normal life looks boring, and they don’t want to return to their
day jobs, or project life looks exhausting, and they never want to develop
another product. You should use tiger teams the way you use wasabi: sparingly,
expecting that it may blow your head off.
On the other hand, if you have a “bet the company” project, or one that has the
potential to be a real technology or market game changer, a tiger team may
be the best approach. The team has the autonomy and resources it needs to
come up with something really “out of the box”; executives and functional
leaders have acknowledged the importance of the team’s work; and team
members are free to invent new approaches instead of being weighed down
by “how it’s done around here.” If a tiger team is really what’s needed, we
hope your executives will have the courage to charter one — and work hard
with it to make sure it’s guided and supported more than adequately.
Your functional heads and your product development leaders — the executives
and business heads who need new products to grow their business — need
209
Chapter 10: Organizing the NPD Troops

to understand that by creating a cross-functional team to develop a product,
they’re working in an area replete with political traps. Teams and functions
can get in each other’s way. They have different goals and scarce resources
to accomplish those goals. However, an NPD team can’t succeed without the
help of the functions, and the functions depend on the NPD team to create
their future.
Take a look at Chapter 9 for some sage advice on how to help teams and func-
tions navigate the political terrain so they all end up winners.

Managing Your Corporation’s 
NPD Resources
In This Chapter
 Assessing how well your company uses its resources
 Developing your product portfolio
 Supporting the projects in your development pipeline
 Reducing the cycle time of NPD
 Stretching your resources by becoming Lean
You may think that coming up with good product ideas, developing prod-
ucts that customers want, and getting those products to markets where
customers can buy them are the main ingredients you need to bake up an
impressive piece of the profit pie. All those ingredients certainly are impor-
tant, but they aren’t enough.
Too many companies fail at the new product development game because
they don’t manage their resources well. Product development resources are
mostly people, and people provide the needed skills and experience. Resources
also include financial outlay — for people, of course, but also for equipment
and infrastructure. Some projects require capital outlays — for example,
when a new product requires new manufacturing facilities.
No company has unlimited resources for developing new products. In this
chapter, you find out how to assess the way your company resources its pro-
jects. You discover how successful companies make decisions about which
projects to resource and which to shelve. We explain how you can make sure
the people who develop your new products are optimally busy (not sitting
around with nothing to do, but not stretched so thin that they delay impor-
tant projects). Product developers have discovered how to shorten the time
it takes to get from idea to market, so at the end of the chapter, we explore a
couple effective ways to do this: the Lean and Six Sigma processes.

Is Your Company a Well-Oiled 
Machine or a Herd of Cats?
The companies that have the most new product development (NPD) success
set themselves up to produce new products like a well-oiled machine. Like a
machine, all the parts of the process work together to produce the desired
result. These companies have the following characteristics:
 They understand their new product goals, and they make sure that all
their new product projects, taken together, can achieve those goals. 
(See Chapters 3 and 8 for more on setting new product goals.)
 They know what resources they need and can tell you what resources
they have.
 They have plans in place to develop or acquire resources they need but
don’t have. In Chapter 7, you can find out how companies plan to
develop technology resources; in Chapters 8 and 16, you can read about
partnering to acquire needed resources.
 They look for synergies among projects, sometimes building technology
or product platforms (see Chapter 3) that will produce many individual
products.
 They try to optimize the output of their product development pipelines
instead of sacrificing speed and efficiency to gain short-term advantages.
 They select methods to shorten NPD cycle time with great care, knowing
that shortcuts can lead to disaster; however, they use every trick in the
book to get as much from their pipelines as they can (see the final sec-
tion of this chapter for cycle-shortening tips).
So, does your company work like a well-oiled machine? Or are your product
developers and business functions more like a herd of cats, running around
frantically but not getting enough done? Don’t worry, even the best innova-
tors can fall into traps. The following questionnaire helps you assess where
your organization stands on the “herd of cats” versus “well-oiled machine”
continuum. We suggest that you start this chapter by answering Yes or No to
these questions:
1. Our engineers and new product developers work on between 1.5 and
2.0 projects at a time.
2. Most of our projects don’t change significantly between Concept
Review and commercialization (see Chapter 9). If a change does
occur, it happens for a good, and documented, reason (for example,
because the market changes or a competitor comes out with a better
product).
3. We change or stop projects that aren’t meeting business goals.
212
Part III: Navigating the River of Product Development 

4. We can see a clear connection between our resourced technology pro-
jects (see Chapter 7) and product development projects.
5. Every project has a well-defined place in our product portfolio (see
the following section).
6. The strategic criteria for making decisions about what we should
include in our new product portfolio are clear and well understood
(see Chapter 3).
7. We know what resources we need for NPD, now and in the future, and
we have a plan to obtain those resources.
8. We use outsourcing, acquisition, partnering, and other means to
obtain resources beyond our borders (see Chapter 16).
If you answer Yes to six or more of these questions, your organization has, or
is on its way to having, a well-oiled product development machine. You may
even be able to skip this chapter, though you may want to read on to pick up
some more useful hints (hey, you can never be too successful, right?). If you
answer No or I Don’t Know to four or more questions, we suspect that your
resources for NPD are more like a herd of cats. You really need this chapter.
And if you fall somewhere in between with your answers, you have a pretty
good base, but you still have plenty to learn. Read on!
We suggest that you distribute these questions to others who are responsible
for new product development in your company to get their responses. After
you read this chapter, call a meeting to find out what problems and strengths
your group has identified, and come up with some fixes and improvements you
can make.
Filling and Balancing Your NPD Portfolio
In the good old days, the resources needed for product innovation seemed
less constrained. For example, Edwin Land at Polaroid used to commission
several projects to work on the same idea to see which would come out on
top. Companies like 3M and GE used to have huge internal budgets for R&D.
Today, every company is resource-constrained. Businesses must try to make
the most of every dollar spent on innovation and product development. What
this means is that every company needs to make tough choices about what
projects to fund and what to dump, shelve, or sell.
In the sections that follow, you discover how leading companies figure out
just what to develop and what to set aside. The key, they’ve discovered, is in
thinking of product development like an investment portfolio — which, of
course, it is. You probably have some really safe investments in your own
portfolio — bonds, for example. You probably have some that should perform
pretty much the same way the rest of the stock market does — reasonable
213
Chapter 11: Managing Your Corporation’s NPD Resources

growth but maybe not great. And you may have a small percent of your
investments on the possible big winner; you could lose, but you’ll lose only
your T-shirt, not your whole shirt.
Companies that manage their NPD resources well do much the same thing.
They balance their investments in new and risky projects with investments
that are more safe and sound, and they make sure to spread their invest-
ments among the different product lines and businesses that make up their
companies.
Focusing your portfolio with disciplined
portfolio management processes
Your organization needs to have many new product options to choose from if
you want to be a successful new product developer. If you don’t have more
ideas for projects than you can resource, you’re putting yourself in the 
guaranteed-to-fail situation of sticking whatever projects you have hanging
around into your NPD pipeline. Have you ever been in a brainstorming ses-
sion where desperate people are saying things like the following: “Maybe we
could dye it red and sell it at Christmas!” “Maybe we could turn our sippy cup
into a device for the medical market?” These kinds of ideas are the NPD
equivalent of “Let’s run it up the flagpole.”
You need to have plenty of options, and you can read Chapters 4 and 5 to make
sure you have them, but that’s only the starting point for having a successful
product portfolio. You also need to devote your resources to the best combi-
nation of projects in order to meet your strategic objectives (see Chapter 3
for more on your company’s objectives). Even a seemingly great idea may not
be the best fit when you look at it in the context of your other projects. To
select the best options, you need a disciplined decision-making process.
Companies use a disciplined portfolio management process to identify the opti-
mal mix of products/projects to develop. The best combination of projects
will meet your strategic objectives without overloading your capacity.
Implementing a disciplined portfolio management process turns the decision-
making process into an iterative, aggregate, and business-level practice. To
implement a portfolio management process, you have to bring decision makers
together — you can’t do it by yourself — and these decision makers have to
have good information on which to base their decisions. If you bring the right
people to the table and provide them with the right information, you’ll find
that the implementation of a disciplined portfolio management process will
lead your company to obvious and wonderful improvements in product
development decision making.
214
Part III: Navigating the River of Product Development 

Here are some of the areas of your NPD portfolio you should discuss with the
portfolio implementation team:
 What criteria are important for making decisions about what you’ll
include in your product portfolio? Portfolio criteria usually include
financial, strategic, and balance targets (see the following section).
 Who will make the decisions about what goes in? What level of man-
agement is appropriate? For example, will you make decisions at the
business unit or the corporate level?
 What’s the right calendar for portfolio review and decision making?
How often will you review the portfolio? How will your portfolio deci-
sions be tied to your strategic and budget calendars?
The portfolio review calendar sets the timing for “regular” reviews. Your
company also must track the portfolio in real time and call reviews if you
notice any significant changes in, for example, the market or technology.
 How will you link portfolio decisions to decisions about resourcing
projects in the pipeline? It isn’t enough to decide what collection of pro-
jects will deliver on your company’s goals. The portfolio decision
makers have to know what resources they have so that they can
resource the projects they select. And they have to monitor the use of
resources as the projects move through the pipeline.
 How will you get the data you need for making portfolio decisions?
What form will the data be in? How detailed does it need to be? The
information you gather about your customers (see Chapter 4), about
technology (see Chapter 7), and about markets and competitors (see
Chapter 3) will be important in making portfolio decisions.
 What tools can you use for gathering and organizing the data? How
can you support portfolio decision-making? How can you streamline the
collection of data? (In Chapters 3, 4, and 7, you can read about ways to
gather and represent data to support decision-making.)
You shouldn’t expect to answer these questions in any particular order. Each
answer will influence the others, and you’ll have to go back and forth to
establish your decision-making process.
Making decisions about how much to allocate to different business functions
and product lines is, by its nature, a political process. Expect product man-
agers and functional heads to argue for their own corners. (For some tips on
how to deal with NPD politics, take a look at Chapter 9.)
You should put the information that the portfolio decision makers will use
into a format that all functions and decision makers can understand. Supporters
of Joe’s pet project should be able to compare Joe’s ideas, apples to apples,
to Sally’s favorite project by using comparable information and portfolio tem-
plates (see the following section for more on this topic).
215
Chapter 11: Managing Your Corporation’s NPD Resources

Using different criteria 
to shape your portfolio
Companies use a variety of tools and approaches to shape and manage their
product portfolios. The key to successful portfolio management is under-
standing how these different approaches work and finding the best fit for
your company. In the following sections, we outline the approaches available
to your organization.
The most successful new product developers don’t settle for just one
approach; they use a hybrid approach, mixing and matching the tools we
describe in this section.
Financial targets
The products you develop will consume a portion of your resources, from
overhead to capital expenses to manpower, so, of course, they also should
deliver against your goals for financial growth. Companies use financial mea-
sures such as net present value (NPV) and expected commercial value (ECV)
to estimate the likely return of a product portfolio. (You can find more detail
on financial measures in Chapter 8.)
Financial targets set a threshold or hurdle rate for the new product portfolio.
Your company has growth goals, as well as goals for how much it expects
developing new products to contribute to those goals. When you add all the
projects in a new product portfolio, they should equal or exceed the financial
targets your company has set for NPD. If your new product portfolio can’t get
its chin over the financial bar, you need to go back to basics and develop a
better set of new product options. The chapters in Part II are all about that.
People can present many arguments for using one financial measure or
another. Our advice is that you use the one that’s simple for you. The best
thing to do is to use the one your company uses now.
The financial measures allow you to compare the expected financial return of
projects and to aggregate the estimated financial value of a portfolio. Just be
sure to do all the measures for all the projects in the same manner so you can
compare apples to apples. Also, remember to document all your assumptions
when you do the financials. If you suppose that the market will grow at a rate
of 5 percent per year, or if you suppose that the needed technology is “off the
shelf” — in other words, you’ve already developed it — write that down. If it
turns out not to be true, it’s time for revisions!
You should review your aggregate financial measures regularly — perhaps
quarterly or twice a year. You can update each project in a portfolio with
recent information, and you can see how your portfolio performs over time.
216
Part III: Navigating the River of Product Development 

Although financial measures are important, research shows that firms that
rely exclusively on such measures typically have poorer performing portfo-
lios than those that incorporate the other parameters we discuss in this sec-
tion. You can easily set financial targets that are out of touch with reality, and
you can easily “game” financial projections (for example, by inflating market
estimates or likely product price points). You should use a combination of
metrics to assess the value of a portfolio.
Balance of product types
One of a portfolio’s most important uses is balancing the types of projects
your organization funds. Portfolios help your decision makers balance
risk/reward, project types, product lines/businesses, and markets/geogra-
phies. Product developers often say that a particular new product project
“fits the company’s strategy” or “is in line with strategic goals.” But even if
your company is very small, no single project can achieve the strategy all by
itself. Companies that balance their new product portfolios can assess
whether their resources are indeed enabling them to meet their strategic
goals, including growth goals, goals for their different product lines and busi-
ness units, goals for demographic and geographic diversity, and so on.
Balancing risk and reward
To figure out whether a project portfolio is properly balancing risk with reward,
you can use a chart like the one you see in Figure 11-1. The chart indicates
high to low market and technical risk on the Y-axis, and high to low “reward” —
that is, how much revenue product developers expect the new product to earn
during its lifecycle — on the X-axis. In this chart, the size of the circle shows
how much developers expect the project to cost overall, and the little pie slices
represent how much they expect the project to cost in the current year.

217
Chapter 11: Managing Your Corporation’s NPD Resources

When you draw your projects on this type of chart, you can see which ones
fall into the low-risk/low-return category (the lower-right corner), which fall
into the high-risk/high-return category (the upper-left corner), and which fall
in between. Most projects are likely to be low-risk/low-return. In this chart,
just one project is high-risk/high-return. This chart has a number of low-risk
and high-reward projects. If you find any in that part of your chart, go for
them! Notice that two projects are in or near the high-risk/low-return part of
the chart. You may decide to resource these kinds of projects, but only if they
fulfill other critical strategic objectives.
A portfolio that’s balanced between risk and reward has some projects in the
lower right-hand corner — no great reward, but not much risk either. It has a
few in the upper-left corner — the company wants to be sure to have some
risky bets, but it isn’t going to “bet the ranch” on them. The “bread and butter”
in a risk/reward portfolio is in the middle space — the company is taking
risks, but not huge ones, to get good return on its investment.
Although you certainly want to avoid unnecessary project risk, creating a
portfolio full of low-risk projects probably won’t allow you to achieve your
strategic objectives. If a low-risk portfolio does meet your strategic objectives,
maybe it’s time to rethink your objectives! The goal of a product portfolio to
create the balance you need to accomplish your strategy.
Strategic buckets
In order to ensure that their resource allocations allow their business teams
to meet strategic objectives, many companies create strategic buckets — set
amounts of resources given to different products, product lines, or businesses.
A company can also create buckets for high-risk/high-reward projects, for 
different markets or geographies, or for any other category that leadership
deems important for achieving strategic goals.
This is a top-down approach that starts with an articulated strategy for new
product development. The strategy specifies targets in different categories.
To achieve the best results, companies should combine the strategy with a
more bottoms-up approach. For example, you could use strategic buckets at
semi-annual or annual portfolio reviews but manage changes to the portfolio
at interim reviews.
Bob Cooper, Scott Edgett, and Elko Kleinschmidt, in Portfolio Management for
New Products (Addison-Wesley), describe how a number of successful compa-
nies go about building strategic buckets in order to allocate resources to new
product projects. The process goes like this:
1. The company articulates its new product strategy, including a vision and
mission (see Chapter 3).
2. The company’s executives and business leaders decide on the role that
different markets, geographies, products, product lines, and technolo-
gies will play in achieving the strategy.
218
Part III: Navigating the River of Product Development 

3. They decide how much they’ll allocate to each of these strategically
important areas.
4. They assign the available resources to “envelopes” or “buckets” — the
way you might divide your cash into different envelopes for food, cloth-
ing, entertainment, and so on.
For example, the company may decide that an existing product line
needs to generate stable revenues compared to the past several years,
and that to do that, the product line will require a certain amount of
resources. Executives may decide that a promising new market will gen-
erate revenue in the future and that a technology will block a competitor
from entering a market and conclude that achieving these goals is worth
a percent of the company’s total investment.
Too often, executives think they have set a strategy when they haven’t
made the hard resourcing decisions. But Cooper, Edgett, and Kleinschmidt
remind readers that “strategy is not real until it translates into spending
money on specific activities or projects.”
Resourcing New Product Projects 
in the Development Pipeline
A product portfolio represents the combination of projects a company’s man-
agement wants to see developed in order to meet the organization’s strategic
objectives (see Chapter 3). The projects in the portfolio go into the company’s
development pipeline, which is where the rubber meets the road. However,
too many companies separate portfolio management from pipeline manage-
ment. In these companies, executives and senior managers make the “strate-
gic” decisions and leave others to make the “tactical” ones. The result is often
that the actual work being done does not accomplish the strategic goals.
Allocating resources to strategic buckets (see the previous section) helps to
tie strategy with resources. However, the new product pipeline is dynamic,
and resource needs of projects tend to change over time. Even if your com-
pany’s executives have made decisions about which projects will get which
resources, resources need ongoing management as projects move through
the development pipeline.
A company’s executives must oversee and manage the allocation of NPD
resources in order to make sure that their teams can complete the approved
projects in a timely fashion. It’s the team members’ job to make careful esti-
mates of the resources they need, project by project. These resources include
those the company owns; more and more, resources also include external
partners, technologies, and so on (see Chapters 8 and 16). If the team can’t
acquire the resources it needs, from internal or external sources, executives
219
Chapter 11: Managing Your Corporation’s NPD Resources

need to rethink their strategy and trim the project, cancel the project, or
spend more to bring the needed resources on board.
In this section, we outline the tasks and responsibilities new product teams
and members of management must carry out to appropriately resource 
projects.
Managing the product 
development pipeline
The following list presents the main tasks that lead to successful project
resourcing. Some of these tasks are the responsibility of the team members,
and some fall under the executives’ watch. But in the age-old recipe for 
success — “manage up and manage down” — make sure you’re doing your
part, and make sure the people you report to or who report to you are 
doing their parts, too.
 Estimate the people resources needed to support each new product
project. The resources include the number of full-time employees with
specific skill sets who will work on the project, as well as the time frame
in which they’re needed. They also include people outside the company
with needed skills that the company may not have.
Members of management depend on new product teams to give them
estimates of the necessary resources for each project. The estimates
should be completed by folks who are close to the projects. The man-
ager who’s responsible for resourcing the pipeline should provide his 
or her teams with templates to guide them in making their resource 
estimates. Otherwise, the manager will get everything from a 20-page
project plan to scrawls on the back of an envelope, when what’s really
needed is data that he or she can use to see what the project portfolio
requires. In other words, the manager needs to be able to aggregate the
needs of all the projects in the pipeline, so comparable data is essential.
(See the following section for a simple template for reporting resource
needs.)
 Review resource allocations monthly, and make the necessary adjust-
ments to keep your pipeline running smoothly. No matter how well
you’ve estimated resource requirements at the beginning of a project, as
the work progresses the needs will change. The resource manager
should make sure that teams use a standard template and report vari-
ances on a regular basis.
Don’t assign more than 85 percent of your available resources to new product
projects. If your pipeline includes projects with high technology risk, you
should consider assigning even less of your resources. You need resource
220
Part III: Navigating the River of Product Development 

flexibility to address emergencies and backlogs — work that “should’ve been
done by now” but somehow isn’t (like that stack of paper on your desk that
you keep meaning to file). Companies that don’t follow the 85-percent rule
may fall into firefighting as their projects fall behind and turn into emergency
situations.
Understanding a project’s resource needs
Each approved project that enters into the product development pipeline
must have a clear outline of its resource needs. Projects require both normal
resources — people with adequate but widely available skills — and special
resources — people or other resources that are in short supply. The company
may even need to develop these special resources or find them outside the
company (see the later section “Going outside for resource help”). Be sure to
note these special resource needs. Management will need to plan for them so
that projects aren’t held up at critical junctures because they can’t get the
needed software expertise, or the model shop is jammed with work, or they
didn’t anticipate the changes to manufacturing processes.
Figure 11-2 gives you a simple matrix that you can use to plot the resource
needs of each project. You can aggregate this work into an overall plot of the
resources needed for the pipeline.
If the manager asks teams to use this matrix, the information will come in a
form that he or she can easily compare and aggregate. Of course, you aren’t
going to know everything right at the beginning. But by predicting resource
needs as accurately as possible early on and updating your predictions as sit-
uations change, you can avoid a lot of headaches.

Chapter 11: Managing Your Corporation’s NPD Resources

Securing functional resources
NPD team members come from the business functions within the company. The
team comes together depending on whose expertise needs to be involved, from
the fuzzy front end through the launch into market (see Chapters 9 and 10).
The team members must assess the resource needs for a project — resources
that come from many of the company’s functions — and make those needs
very clear to the managers who will give the project the green light — or put
on the brakes. (See Chapter 12 for more on the relationship between the NPD
team and the managers who sit on the review boards.)
Securing functional resources is complex. It isn’t like going to your boss and
requesting an extra week or three more rolls of tape to complete a project.
The members of the NPD team — having formed a clear idea of the resources
they need and when they’ll need them — must negotiate with the functions.
(Take a look at Chapter 9 for some advice on how team members can negoti-
ate successfully with their functions and for more on the politics of NPD.)
Team members should stay within their areas of expertise during negotia-
tions. For example, the marketing team member should negotiate with the
marketing function. She can secure market research resources and resources
for launch planning and execution (see Chapter 13). The engineering team
member should negotiate with R&D for the necessary skills and capabilities
and for the equipment and infrastructure required.
An NPD team has great leverage in a company that includes its new product
projects in a strategic portfolio (see the section “Filling and Balancing Your
NPD Portfolio”) and that approves projects in a disciplined phase/review
process (see Chapters 9 and 12). In companies with clear new product strate-
gies, if a business function can’t provide the team’s needed resources, that
sends up a flashing warning light for the team and management to see. At this
point, the team needs to return to the managers who included the project in
the portfolio and renegotiate.
222
Part III: Navigating the River of Product Development 
Putting chunks into the pipeline
Some companies use resource chunks rather
than headcounts to estimate project needs. The
motorcycle company Harley-Davidson, for
instance, assigns each project a number from
one to six to identify the magnitude of the pro-
ject. The company determines how many sixes
it can have at any time, and how many fives and
fours. With these numbers set, team leaders
can fill in the gaps with the small-scale threes,
twos, and ones. Fairchild Semiconductor, on the
other hand, counts intact teams. Until a team
completes its current project, it won’t receive a
new one. The company assigns team members
who aren’t needed on the project to help out
with other projects until everyone is ready to
move on to a new project.

One of three things will happen:
 The team can’t carry out the project because of a lack of resources. If
management is unable to secure the resources needed, one option is to
cancel the project. This has the good effect of making resources avail-
able to other projects in the pipeline. Of course, before taking this step,
management needs to be sure that the project isn’t critical for achieving
its strategic objectives.
 The project gets delayed. When projects get delayed because resources
are lacking, the products arrive late in the market. When this happens, it
should be obvious that the company is slated to lose money. If you cal-
culate what a particular resource may cost — for example, using the ser-
vices of a software designer for two weeks or outsourcing work to a
model shop to build a prototype — you often can show that the cost of
the resource is almost insignificant when compared to the revenues lost.
Product developers call this calculation the dollar cost of time or the
opportunity cost. (See the following section for help persuading your
company that spending money now may be worth it in the future.)
 The managers will go to the functions and strengthen the requests for
resources with more information and data. If the project is too critical
to be cancelled, and if delay is too costly an option, managers or business
leaders may put more clout behind the team requests for resources.
Going outside for resource help
If your NPD team can show your company that spending on resources now
will increase revenue later (see the previous section), you may be able to
argue for and obtain outside help. Timely use of external resources can do a
world of good to help your team meet or exceed its schedule predictions,
with little additional cost and the same or better quality.
If your team has created a well-thought-out plan of its resource needs (see
“Understanding a project’s resource needs”), you can specify exactly what
external resources your team needs to keep a project on track. You may need
to farm out the design and development of a whole subsystem, for example,
or you may contract with a firm or person who has the skills you need to
design or build a part.
Companies count more and more on external resources these days. In fact, as
you plan for your resource needs, it may make sense to see not how little you
can outsource, but how much. You can look in Chapters 7, 8, 15, and 16 to
discover more about how companies are farming out, outsourcing, allying,
and partnering on many parts of the product development process.
223
Chapter 11: Managing Your Corporation’s NPD Resources

Keeping the product development 
pipeline flowing
The product development pipeline works like a highway. At 10 a.m. on a high-
way that surrounds a major city, you won’t see very many cars. Every car can
go the speed limit, and most are going faster. If an online directions service
says that it will take an hour for your trip, you may be able to complete it in
50 minutes. These driving conditions are pleasant, but if you always drive at
10 a.m., you may think that the state’s transportation department built too
many highways and didn’t make good use of its resources.
Now suppose that you’re making your trip at 4:00 or 4:30 p.m. The highway
has some traffic. You go the speed limit, and maybe you curse the jerks in
their luxury sedans who dodge in and out of lanes to make better time. On
the whole, drivers are using the highway well, and the cars are moving at a
pretty optimal rate. But you realize that you left too late. All of a sudden, the
traffic slows to a crawl, and you realize that you’ll be here, stuck in Friday-
afternoon, rush-hour traffic (where’d they get that name for it?), for at least
another 45 minutes.
What happened? Simple. Material, particles, cars, water, projects — they all
flow at the optimal rate for the “highways” they’re on until too many cars, too
much water, too many projects, and so on enter the picture. At that point, the
flow slows to a crawl. When this happens, nothing gets through in good time.
In a new product pipeline, when projects compete for resources, they slow
each other down and all the projects get delayed. Once in a while, a project —
like the guy in the luxury car — finds a hole, speeds up, and makes good time
for a while. There may be accidents on the road, but the project in the luxury
car gets to the goal (market) ahead of everyone else, and the company’s exec-
utives cheer and tell the project’s team how great it is. Meanwhile, 20 or 30
other projects are still stuck in rush-hour traffic, a few are sidelined by acci-
dents, and the company is no closer to meeting its new product objectives.
If your NPD team and executives haven’t had the time or the discipline to
examine your projects’ resource needs, we recommend that you sideline a
few of your projects to see whether the projects that remain in the pipeline
start moving faster. Keep taking out projects until the pipeline is moving at a
healthy clip and projects are meeting their schedules. By staffing these pro-
jects for success and finishing the first set, you’ll actually complete the next
set sooner than if you staff all the projects at once with less-than-optimal
resources.
As you thin out the pipeline, you’ll remove the projects that seem less strate-
gically vital than the others. Try to achieve “portfolio balance” even if your
portfolio management process isn’t all that well-developed (see the section
“Filling and Balancing Your NPD Portfolio”) by keeping some projects in as
224
Part III: Navigating the River of Product Development 

many of the important areas as you can (for example, don’t remove all the
projects focused on one market unless you plan to exit that market).
This strategy works, but it’s just so counterintuitive. If you aren’t putting
enough products into the market, you’ll have the urge to put more projects
into the pipeline. If you add more, though, you’ll slow down the pipeline even
more, and you’ll put fewer products into the market.
Of course, you don’t need to take these measures if you can make more pre-
cise estimates of your projects’ resource needs and your organization’s
resource availability. The task isn’t easy, but the longer you work at it, the
more data and experience you’ll build.
Shortening Cycle Time
One of the most obvious and widely measured results of implementing a dis-
ciplined phase/review process (see Chapter 9) is that the process can shorten
the time it takes for teams to get new products into the market, or the cycle
time. Shortening cycle time has many benefits:
 Projects tend to absorb fewer resources (contrary to common belief,
which is that shortening cycle time requires more resources).
 Companies can deploy resources to other projects more quickly.
 Products get into the market quickly, where they’ll (hopefully) start to
earn back the money their companies have spent on them.
In this section, we tell you why it’s so important to shorten cycle time, and
we give you some of the best ways to go about it.
Getting to profits within the 
window of opportunity
When you introduce a new product to the market, be aware that the product
has a lifecycle (see Chapter 3). Much as you may want it to, the product won’t
continue to produce profits forever (unless you have the equivalent of Classic
Coke or a commodity product such as bottled hydrogen, in which case the
revenue stream may last — at least until you retire).
For most products, teams really need to time their launches for what many call
the window of opportunity — when the products will bring in the best returns.
The more time products spend in development, the more time they lose in the
window of opportunity, and after this time is lost, it can’t be regained.
225
Chapter 11: Managing Your Corporation’s NPD Resources

For seasonal products such as ski jackets or bathing suits, the window may
be the holiday season or summertime. For other products, the window may
depend on the following:
 Trends or fads (like hula hoops or fad diets)
 How quickly a competitor can launch a product that could steal a part
of your market
The pace of product development is so fast now that even breakthrough
products like digital cameras or the iPod find competitors breathing
down their necks.
 The length of time patents will protect your product
This is critically important for the pharmaceutical industry, which mea-
sures its returns on how long a drug will stay on patent.
Poor resourcing is a major cause of delay in getting a product to market (see
the earlier section “Securing functional resources”). You need to be sure you
provide your time-sensitive projects with adequate resources so that you can
get them to market as quickly as possible and gain the most benefit from
their best years.
Spending more time upfront 
to reduce rework later
It may seem paradoxical, but spending more time upfront in the development
process may shorten the time it takes to get to market. Companies that take
the time to thoroughly understand their customers and come up with solu-
tions that meet their customers needs, instead of hurrying through the early
parts of the product development cycle, not only get to market with products
that customers will buy, but also often get there quicker (see Chapter 4 for
more on understanding customers).
When teams rush into the projects, they often misunderstand their cus-
tomers’ needs. In addition, they often do things wrong — use the wrong tech-
nologies, design parts that don’t fit with other parts, design products that are
hard or impossible to manufacture, and so on. These kinds of mistakes send
the teams into a rework loop where they have to fix things that they could’ve
avoided with better planning.
Executives can get antsy about projects that take longer in the upfront part of
the cycle. They’re human, and they want to see results. They’re happier when
they can see a prototype and even happier when they can see the money the
product is making. Be sure they read this chapter!
226
Part III: Navigating the River of Product Development 

This is a tip for executives: Put more resources into the front end of the prod-
uct development process. Realize that your teams need to plan in order to
work quickly later on and that you’ll be saving later in the process. You’ll be
saving on their ability to get it right the first time — on the rework they don’t
have to do because they took the time to get it right. Best of all, you’ll reap the
rewards of a product that meets customer needs and sells well in the market.
Planning makes perfect
Do you really understand your customers’ needs and wants (see Chapter 4)?
Does your team have a good grip on the technology you’ll need and how you
plan to get it (see Chapter 7)? Do you understand how the product will be
manufactured so that you don’t have to fix a whole lot of glitches late in the
product development process (see Chapter 9)? Hopefully so if you want to
get your product into the market as quickly as possible, make a product that
customers will buy, and save your team a lot of headaches, rework, and the
finger-pointing that usually goes with making mistakes. And, of course, you
avoid the need for additional resources, time, and money; needing these
things throws off the business case for your product and often steals
resources from other projects in the pipeline.
Team leaders shouldn’t push their teams to jump into developing products
until they’ve spent enough time working on their project plans. If team mem-
bers find gaps, they should go back and get better information. Time spent in
preparation should surface assumptions, uncover risks, and help the team
members become a focused group.
A product’s design and specifications should be set early in the product
development process. Late changes can be costly causes of project delay.
Take a look at the last section of this chapter for a description of the Six
Sigma approach to upfront design, which helps to avoid late changes.
227
Chapter 11: Managing Your Corporation’s NPD Resources
We’re so glad we invited that guy to the party!
Co-author Robin once worked with a team that
was developing a new chemical, along with the
process to produce it. Fortunately, the company
was using cross-functional teams (see Chapter
10). The R&D members of the team suggested an
additive that they were familiar with for the chem-
ical. The manufacturing team member explained
to the team that the additive wouldn’t scale up
well. He suggested a replacement — one that
would work better for the scale needed in man-
ufacturing. Because the manufacturing member
was a member of the team from the beginning,
instead of waiting until “manufacturing issues”
arose later in the process, the team prepared
itself to produce a chemical that could make 
a smooth transfer to manufacturing and have a
successful launch.

Our friend Professor Jean-Philippe Deschamps of IMD in Lausanne, Switzerland,
tells us: “Plan superbly and, only then, run like hell.”
Working on back-end issues during the front end
NPD teams shouldn’t be tempted to leave the later parts of projects for later.
And they can be tempted if the culture of new product development at their
companies doesn’t include a deep understanding of the importance of plan-
ning and upfront work. Even though the work of developing new products is
linear — it starts at the beginning with an idea, goes through the phase/
review process, and ends up, hopefully, with a product in the market — the
planning is not.
Teams need to understand manufacturing issues, legal issues, and regulatory
issues. They should be planning early for market development and product
launch (see Chapter 13). They need to anticipate technology issues so they
can start early to develop or acquire the needed technology. They should
consider the impact of packaging and distribution early on.
The more you understand up front, the less you have to deal with downstream
issues that hold up projects; the more likely it is that you’ll complete the pro-
ject in the scheduled time; and the fewer resources you’ll need overall.
Knowing when fast becomes too fast
Although shortening cycle time is important and beneficial, speed to market
can become the only thing that management, or the team leader, cares about.
Careful! The goal is to get your product to market quickly, but you want it to
be a quality product that your customers will buy.
The following list presents some of the speed traps that NPD teams can fall into:
 Pushing people or teams with extrinsic rewards or threats. Most new
product team members — and most people in general — respond to the
intrinsic reward of doing work they consider worthwhile. Realistic goals
to shorten cycle time can motivate NPD teams, but carrots and sticks
rarely do.
 Skipping steps to save time. You often can skip steps in a phase/review
process, but you should think this out carefully in advance. You can’t
skip reviews if you foresee important questions popping up about the
technical or business viability of a project, for instance.
For many projects, setting out-of-bounds criteria is an appropriate way
to speed up a product’s cycle time. You can find out more about these in
Chapter 12.
 Compromising quality. Many speedsters are tempted to cut corners.
We’ve known teams that have eliminated features in a rush to the market,
228
Part III: Navigating the River of Product Development 

only to find that without those features, the products weren’t attractive
to customers. Another temptation is to make the product less robust,
but that may come back to haunt you when warranty claims skyrocket.
The exception to the quality warning is when your company has a
planned sequence of products from a product platform. In this case, the
early products could be of lesser quality, or have fewer features, than
the later products. See Chapter 3 for more advice on this topic.
To avoid the speed traps, do the upfront work so you don’t waste time cor-
recting mistakes you could’ve anticipated, set conditions that may let teams
move quickly through reviews, and, most importantly, value product quality
over a senseless rush to get to market.
Practicing the Discipline of No Waste
Many companies want to cut the waste out of their product development
processes and capitalize on the resources they have (or can easily obtain).
The approaches most discussed today include Lean development and Six
Sigma. This section won’t give you the last word on these strategies, but we
want you to see how they connect to developing new products.
If you want more information, we encourage you to check out Six Sigma For
Dummies, by Craig Gygi, Neil DeCarlo, Bruce Williams, and Stephen R. Covey,
and Lean For Dummies, by Bruce Williams and Natalie Sayer, both published by
Wiley. And for a comprehensive look at these types of techniques, you can look
at Quality Control For Dummies, by Larry Webber and Michael Wallace (Wiley).
Lean development
Lean development is a discipline that has emerged from the quality movement.
The quality movement has enabled companies to make impressive improve-
ments in efficiency and quality in their manufacturing enterprises. Although
product development differs in many ways from manufacturing, many compa-
nies have successfully eliminated waste from their product development
processes by using Lean processes.
Follow these steps to follow their lead:
1. Identify the sources of waste in your new product development efforts.
Assign a team to observe your new product teams and processes to see
where they’re taking unnecessary steps or doing work that could be
avoided. Examples could include hand-offs (for example, from engineer-
ing to manufacturing), scatter (in other words, making your team members
229
Chapter 11: Managing Your Corporation’s NPD Resources

scatter-brained by giving them too many projects — see “Understanding a
project’s resource needs”), and wishful thinking.
2. Eliminate waste wherever possible.
Here are some methods you can use for the examples in Step 1:
• To eliminate hand-offs, use a team approach; make sure team mem-
bers make decisions about the project together (“no decisions out-
side of this room”); and make a detailed plan for the steps needed
to develop the product. You can find more on planning in the prod-
uct development process in the section “Planning makes perfect”
and in Chapter 9.
• To eliminate scatter, be realistic about the projects you can resource,
and don’t have a team spend too much time fixing a product that
you launched six months ago. Yes, too often people who should be
working on new product development are the ones who are diverted
to fix problems that should’ve been taken care of earlier.
• To eliminate wishful thinking, get serious about what you can
accomplish, and don’t add more projects until you’ve completed
the most important ones in your pipeline.
Six Sigma
Like other quality movements, Six Sigma was originally introduced to improve
the quality of existing products and processes — manufacturing in particular.
230
Part III: Navigating the River of Product Development 
So what’s really new?
When executives first hear of Lean or Six
Sigma, they often have a missionary glaze in
their eyes. They’ve found the Holy Grail, the
silver bullet, the ultimate answer to the ills of
their corporations. But you shouldn’t be so quick
to throw out what you already know.
If you’ve read this whole chapter, you’ve seen
that many of our recommendations for resourc-
ing your product development efforts are
reflected in the Lean and Six Sigma processes. If
your executives bring these approaches to your
company, by all means use them to link the
great processes you already use. The truth is
that many of these processes have their initial
impetus from the “Japanese Miracle” in which
many companies, including Toyota, made
impressive changes to their product develop-
ment processes. These changes scared the
heck out of U.S. companies and made them
realize that teams, processes, and cross-
functional planning are the keys to improvement
and competitiveness.

Design for Six Sigma (DFSS), however, is a process that seeks to prevent qual-
ity problems by focusing on upfront design. Upfront work helps to reduce the
number of changes to design as projects move forward. DFSS focuses on
developing product requirements by understanding customer needs, using a
process similar to the one we describe in Chapter 4. DFSS also focuses on
system design in order to identify critical interfaces. This attention to system
design reduces rework and frustration later in the process.
Although DFSS can add work to the early parts of the development cycle, com-
panies make up this added time as projects move through the development
phases with fewer changes and iterations. See the earlier section “Spending
more time upfront to reduce rework later” for more on the need to spend time
and resources in the early part of the cycle.
Another benefit of Six Sigma (and one we consider huge) is that companies
usually implement it as a system-wide change that includes business, manu-
facturing, and R&D processes. What this means for a product developer is
that the systems and processes that optimize product development won’t 
be so foreign to the rest of the company. You create a common process lan-
guage that helps employees relate to the other functions and businesses in
the company.

any things can change between management’s initial decision to
resource a project and the time when the product development team
has the product ready for market. You don’t want managers looking over the
product development team’s shoulder, second-guessing and getting involved
in the day-to-day or week-to-week decisions. On the other hand, you don’t
want your team moving forward without the benefit of management’s wider
and more strategic view, and its enthusiastic support.
The solution is a reviewing process. At reviews, the product development
team updates reviewers on the project status, and reviewers make decisions
to supply necessary resources to projects to continue them through develop-
ment to the next phase — or not.
At the heart of the review process is the business case. It gives the team a
way to track key financial and strategic project parameters, and it gives mem-
bers of management necessary project information that allows them to make
“apples-to-apples” comparisons with other projects.
In this chapter, you find out how reviewers strike the tricky balance between
focusing on the merits of the project under review and considering the objec-
tives of the entire product portfolio (see Chapter 11). You also discover how
reviewers can stop projects and still gain value from the team’s work. Finally,
we explain how to write a business case to keep reviewers and the new prod-
uct team on track.

Understanding the Purpose of Reviews
In the product development process, NPD teams and their projects are char-
tered (authorized, funded, or “given the go-ahead”) by management. This
authorization happens early in a project’s lifecycle, in what people some-
times call the “fuzzy front end.” (Turn to Chapter 9 to find out more about the
product development process and the fuzzy front end.) From that point on,
teams need to be adequately resourced and have autonomy. They should
have the ability to be creative in their approaches to turning concepts into
products that hit the market.
However, NPD teams shouldn’t be so autonomous and so creative that they
stray from the business case approved by management. Your company has to
strike a balance and also be prepared to deal with unexpected roadblocks or
changes in the business and strategic landscape. What looked like a good
project six months or a year ago may not seem like such a good bet today.
That’s where the reviewing process comes in. In this section, we discuss the
main purposes for reviews, and we describe when they should take place.
Phase reviews — the reviews that occur between the phases of the product
development process — should focus on business issues, not technical
issues. Reviewers and teams need to know whether a project is feasible, but
the reviewers don’t need to get into the technical details. The key technical
issues at a phase review are as follows:
 Can we make it?
 How long will it take?
 How much will it cost?
 How does this technology relate to the company’s technology develop-
ment strategy (see Chapter 7)?
Is the project still on track?
One big reason why you have to monitor new product projects as they go
through the development process is to make sure they don’t migrate from the
value propositions managers expect them to fulfill.
For this reason, companies divide the product development process into
phases and punctuate the phases with reviews (or what some companies call
gates or decision diamonds). Take a look at the Cheat Sheet in the front of the
book to see the major phases and reviews.
234
Part III: Navigating the River of Product Development 

During each phase, the development team has a chance to be autonomous
and creative; at the reviews following each phase, management gets to see
what the team is doing and assess whether the project is meeting the reviewers’
strategic and financial objectives (see the following section for financial issues).
The outcome of a review is like a contract between the team members and
the reviewers. The reviewers, representing executives and managers, can
give the team the resources and direction it needs to go through the next
phase and to the next review.
Sometimes, at the beginning of a project, the reviewers and team members
decide that the project needs only a few reviews or none at all between the
initial Feasibility Review and the final “go-to-market” review. This is especially
likely in the case of low-risk or incremental projects, such as a minor improve-
ment to a product that is already in the market. Instead of just assuming that
every NPD project has to go through every review in the phase/review process,
be sure to consider, at the Feasibility Review, which reviews are important. Then
set out-of-bounds criteria — financial and other limits the project has to stay
within — so that if things change, the team can call for an unscheduled review
(see the section “Creating out-of-bounds criteria” later in this chapter).
You should always hold a review before you launch a product into the
market. Every new product affects your company’s brand, its competitive
position, and, of course, its other products and services. Management should
get one last look before you take the fateful step to the market!
Does the project still make 
financial sense?
When management approves a project, they base a significant part of their
judgment on “What’s the return on our investment (ROI) likely to be?” Many
companies use hurdles or thresholds — for example, the company might
decide that it will seldom approve a project that won’t realize 15 percent 
over its cost.
Don’t let company hurdle rates keep managers from approving projects that
might have strategic benefits even if their numbers aren’t quite up to snuff.
For example, a platform project (see Chapter 3) — one that you expect to
provide the basis for many products going forward — might have poor finan-
cials if you assess it all on its own.
Companies often hold reviews before project phases during which their
investments will increase. For example, if the next phase requires expensive
235
Chapter 12: Using Reviews to Keep Projects on Track

investments in special tooling or manufacturing infrastructure, management
should make doubly sure that the project is worth the additional resources.
This strategy is just good risk management — investing small amounts is
okay, but when the sums get larger, the success criteria get firmer.
Each time your company holds a review, the reviewers make a decision to
move the project to the next phase, to hold the project for more work, or to
stop the project. If management is unwilling to make go/recycle/stop deci-
sions and simply lets most projects move through the review process, your
company will spend its scarce resources on many projects that have almost
no chance of living up to early promises.
Of course, you have to balance the impact of shutting down a project with
the possibility that it will ultimately succeed. 3M had a legendary culture of
innovation in part because projects like its Post-it Notes were able to keep on
going even though many people in the company thought the product was a
bad idea. 3M made room for such projects through its “15 percent rule”: Each
product developer was able to spend 15 percent of his or her time on what-
ever he or she wanted. 3M’s Post-its survived because of that rule.
Recycled or canceled projects don’t signify failure! Reviews allow the team
members and the managers to come together and mutually determine the
best use of the company’s scarce resources. And the responsibility doesn’t
fall only to the reviewers. If the team has good reason to believe that a pro-
ject shouldn’t continue or should stay longer in its current phase, it should
recommend this to the reviewers.
For more advice on stopping or stalling projects, check out the later section
“For Reviewers: Knowing When and How to Say No.”
Abiding by the Rules for a 
Successful Review
Phase reviews in the product development process are an important part of
what makes a company successful at developing new products. They are not
informal meetings where “the folks” gather to shoot the breeze about the
latest new technologies. They are formal occasions, and the best review ses-
sions follow a few basic rules. But don’t let this stern warning keep you from
enjoying your work! Formal occasions though they are, the best reviews are
also places where people who know and respect each other can ask the hard
questions and give deserved congratulations for jobs well done.
In this section, we discuss the rules for a successful review, as well as who
needs to do what to ensure that you meet these rules.
236
Part III: Navigating the River of Product Development 

Provide clear guidelines 
for team deliverables
In order to grow your company’s competence in holding phase reviews,
teams have to follow guidelines so that they prepare appropriately for the
reviews. You can make two big mistakes regarding guidelines: leaving the
guidelines unclear and overspecifying them. Good guidelines tell team mem-
bers exactly what the reviewers need to know and what the team has to
accomplish before a review for a phase is scheduled.
Who creates these guidelines? It should be someone in management, because
guidelines are effective and useful only insofar as they’re followed by a large
majority of teams. In many companies, the executives appoint a process owner
for NPD. The process owner’s responsibility is to manage the processes, includ-
ing the review process. This person is also responsible for making sure that
processes are changed over time, as his or her company learns what’s work-
ing and what isn’t. (Check out Chapter 8 to find out more about the role of
the process owner.)
Having a standard checklist of review deliverables brings uniformity to the prod-
uct development process. If all of the company’s NPD teams use the same check-
list, you can weed out what doesn’t work and improve the list over time. Your
teams will appreciate the guidance that good checklists provide, and reviewers
will appreciate knowing what to expect. Your checklist will likely contain plenty
of jargon — things that teams always do in your company. That’s okay. Just be
sure that everyone understands what you mean when you include jargon on
your checklist. Don’t ask for Beta Testing, for example, if your company doesn’t
do it or doesn’t call it that (see Chapter 17 for info on Beta Testing).
The following is an example of a deliverables checklist for a project that’s
nearing the end of development. There’s another example in Figure 9-2 that
you may want to look at. This checklist was used by a company that manufac-
tured cameras. You’ll want to change the items to include the things that are
important in your company. The cross-functional team leader (see Chapter 10)
can use the checklist to manage the work of the team leading up to a review.
After each item, write “by whom,” “by when,” and “percent complete.” When
you’ve checked all or most of the items as “100 percent complete,” your team
is ready for the review.
❑Beta Tests complete
❑Pilot production runs complete; manufacturability confirmed
❑Quality and reliability testing complete
❑Product launch details complete and committed to by functions
❑Market research that demonstrates market acceptance

Train the reviewers to know 
what to look for
Companies usually assume that their teams — the product developers — need
the training on how to make reviews effective. This is true, but reviewers
need review training, too. What reviewers expect, teams are likely to do. If
your reviewers don’t know what to expect, though, trying to improve reviews
by focusing on NPD teams is like carrying water uphill in a leaky bucket.
An executive should be responsible for making sure that reviewers are
trained. The training doesn’t have to be a time sink for busy executives. With
a well-thought-out plan, most reviewers will get what they need even if the
training is limited to “JIT” (just-in-time training) that gives them what they
need to know when they need to know it.
When building a training program for reviewers, include an overview of the
following points, at a minimum:
 You need to know about the project under review before the phase
review meeting so that you’re ready to make sound and informed deci-
sions. If this means contacting functional members of the team before-
hand, don’t hesitate. For example, if the project is developing technology
that is of strategic significance for other projects, be sure to understand
how all that is supposed to work.
 You should know the role the project plays in your company’s overall
new product portfolio, as well as the resource implications of the project
for the new product pipeline. (See Chapter 11 for more on portfolios and
pipelines.)
 You should understand the different types of reviews. You need to know
when it’s appropriate to call a technical review, for example, instead of
addressing technical issues at a phase review.
238
Part III: Navigating the River of Product Development 

 You should understand the purposes of the phase review, which are to
determine the individual merits of a project and its ongoing fit with the
company’s strategic objectives and to make a decision to continue, stop,
or recycle a project (see the later section “For Reviewers: Knowing
When and How to Say No”).
Co-author Robin’s training sessions with review committees include a mock
phase review, where reviewers hear project information, discuss it, and come
to a decision. After the role-play exercise, the reviewers discuss what worked
and what didn’t so that they’ll know what to expect at the real reviews. For
smaller companies, the JIT approach discussed earlier in this section might
be more appropriate.
Do the necessary team prep work
Your NPD team needs to complete many tasks to prepare for a phase review.
Preparing for a review includes, but isn’t limited to, updating the business
case and creating an executive summary. (You can read about the business
case in Chapter 9, and we offer plenty more later in this chapter. We also pro-
vide a template in the Appendix.)
An executive summary covers all the information contained in the full report
which the team will present at the review, but in condensed form. An execu-
tive summary shouldn’t be longer than one or two pages. If your report has
an outline or table of contents, follow that, and write short paragraphs. Write
so that if a reviewer reads only the first sentence of each paragraph, she’ll
still get the gist. Think of it this way: If an executive reads only the executive
summary, she should be able to participate in a discussion without revealing
that she didn’t do all her homework.
Your NPD team should send the summary and the updated business case to
reviewers several days before a review. In most cases, members of the core
cross-functional NPD team should meet with their functional counterparts
before the review — especially if the reports contain any information that
may be puzzling or controversial for a functional reviewer. (Note: All review-
ers should, at a minimum, read the executive summary and review the busi-
ness plan before the review. They should contact a functional member of the
team if they have any questions.)
Another piece of preparatory work is readying the discussion agenda. The
team leader should prepare an agenda, circulate it to the team members and
to the reviewers, and make sure that the review is scheduled for a convenient
time and at an appropriate location. He should also allocate enough time for
the review (usually an hour, and no more than two).
239
Chapter 12: Using Reviews to Keep Projects on Track

We recommend keeping the agenda short and sweet. Include an overview of
progress since the last review, the team’s recommendation and the decisions
that the reviewers will make, a comparison of the current state of the project
with expected deliverables at this time, and any specific presentations that will
add to reviewers’ understanding of the project status. Keep these added presen-
tations to a minimum, and include plenty of time for discussion. We recommend
including times on the agenda to help the team leader manage the discussion.
If your company’s review committee takes on the role of scheduling meetings,
your new product team leader should still confirm the details. A new product
project belongs to the team, and you don’t want the review to fall off the radar.
A team’s final piece of prep work can be practice. The team can practice its
review presentation ahead of time with some “friendly outsiders” — colleagues
who are not working on this project. Through practice, you can make sure
that the presentation works well, and the outsiders can help the team to
anticipate the questions reviewers may ask.
Ensure complete review attendance
Having 100 percent attendance seems like a foregone conclusion, right? Not
so fast. As companies and new product projects become more and more
spread out, it becomes harder to bring a whole team and all the reviewers
together for a productive hour of discussion and reflection (see the later sec-
tion “Inviting the right people to the review” to see who should attend). If
you’re finding it difficult to gather all required review parties, try some
approaches that other companies have found successful:
 Set aside a time — perhaps one day per month — when all the reviews
take place. If you have a set time, you can expect all the reviewers and
the key members of the core NPD team to attend. The drawback of this
method is that it can delay projects if your company has a hard stop at
the end of each phase before the next phase can start. It works best if
your reviews happen “around the time” of the transitions from one phase
to the next. In Chapter 9, you discover more about tailoring phases and
reviews to meet your company’s needs; you also see that we both strongly
recommend allowing for overlapping phases.
 Use videoconferencing to “gather” reviewers and teams. With video-
conferencing, you can still display the team slides, the agenda, and any
other necessary information for all the participants to see. Videoconfer-
encing works well if your team members and your reviewers are dispersed,
which is more and more the case these days.
Be sure that the review participants have a chance to practice with the
videoconferencing technology before the review. When you’re familiar with
the technology, it feels almost like being in the same room. If you don’t
practice, videoconferencing can be very distracting and disruptive. (For
240
Part III: Navigating the River of Product Development 

more on this tool and the impact of technology on product develop-
ment, see Chapter 14.)
 Create rules of attendance. No one wants to be called out as the cause
of project delay and a waster of company resources. Rules of attendance
can instill this fear. At DuPont, for example, the PAC (Project Approval
Committee) rules state that if more than one PAC member doesn’t show,
the review is cancelled. A cancellation can significantly delay a project
and upset a team. After DuPont put the rule in place, PAC members
made sure they attended the sessions. One PAC member participated in
a review from a telephone on the side of the road (he was on a bicycling
vacation). Another joined a review from a cruise ship. It can work!
Communicate review decisions
The reviewers’ decision during a phase review isn’t really a simple “go, stop,
or redirect” decision. That final word is just the output of the decision-making
process — the choice the reviewers make after they consider all the options,
the information, the debate, and discussion. The decision-making process
includes the following:
 The reviewers’ assumptions, values, and concerns
 What the reviewers know or find out about the project
 What the reviewers understand about the new product portfolio and the
resources that are available to the new product pipeline (see Chapter 11)
 The reviewers’ takes on the company’s market strategy, their under-
standing of the company’s competencies, and their assessment of how
the current project aligns with these
The review is a conversation in which the team gets to understand the basis for
a decision about a project. Team members also get to inform reviewers about
their project and correct misunderstandings. The reviewers should walk away
with a better understanding of the project; the team should walk away with a
better understanding of exactly what reviewers are expecting and how their
project aligns with the company’s NPD strategies. (See the later section “For
Reviewers: Knowing When and How to Say No” for more on decision making.)
One of the most important and helpful parts of the review process is the
opportunity that the development team has to listen to and learn from the
reviewers. We’re not saying that managers and executives are smarter or
better than the rest of us. But when it comes to new products, they should
have a wider perspective because they must understand the strategic con-
text for a product. Executives often have wider experience than many team
members, and they can bring that experience to a review discussion. So it’s
worth paying attention, and expecting that the review and the discussion on
the reviewers’ decisions will be useful and productive conversations.
241
Chapter 12: Using Reviews to Keep Projects on Track

For Reviewers: Knowing When 
and How to Say No
Businesspeople are supposed to be hardheaded and unsentimental, but for
some reason, members of review committees often have a hard time saying
no. Sometimes, we suspect, it’s because they aren’t sure that there are any
better projects to replace the cancelled ones. If that’s a problem in your com-
pany, read Chapter 5 for advice on how to come up with plenty of great
options. Some executives really don’t understand that there’s room for only
so many projects in the development pipeline. If your executives think this
way, get them to read Chapter 11 on “Managing Your Corporation’s NPD
Resources.” Whatever the reasons, make sure that the reviewers in your com-
pany have a firm grasp on when they should cancel projects and on how they
should do so. The following sections show you the way.
When (and why) to stop projects
Here’s a list of appropriate times for reviewers to stop new product projects:
 At the very beginning of the process: The concepts that you review
during the Idea/Concept Screens (see Chapter 6) barely qualify as “pro-
jects.” The team needs to present the review committee with many con-
cepts to choose from. The ones that don’t make it into the development
pipeline should hit the shelves for later or be licensed/sold if they have
value that your company isn’t likely to use any time soon.
 At the Feasibility Review (see Chapter 9): After a project passes
through the Concept Review, the development team has many questions
to answer, including the following:
• How long will it take to develop or acquire the needed technology,
and how much will it cost?
• Will the proposed product appeal to a large enough market of 
customers?
• Will the margins be high enough for the company to make a good
return on its investment?
The Feasibility Review is when reviewers and teams should weed out the
projects that can’t answer yes to these questions.
The best-run NPD processes look like funnels up to the Feasibility Review.
After that point, you won’t mind if your process straightens out and looks
more like a tunnel. Be sure, however, that the reviewers aren’t closing
their eyes to problems that can occur after the Feasibility Review.
242
Part III: Navigating the River of Product Development 

 During the phase/review process: Reviewers have the opportunity to
stop a project at scheduled reviews during the development process.
For example, they can stop a project whenever
• The team and/or the reviewers determine that the project is so far
out of bounds that it no longer makes good business sense to
pursue it. (See the later section “Creating out-of-bounds criteria”
for more on the topic.)
• You run into resource issues. Perhaps the product pipeline is over-
crowded and you have to hold up other projects. When this
occurs, reviewers need to determine which projects they should
stop or put on hold in order to free up resources for other projects.
(For more on resources, see Chapter 11.)
• Competitors have changed the basis of competition by introducing
products that make the product your company is developing less
attractive. This is particularly true in industries where the market
and/or technology are changing rapidly.
• Changes to the company’s new product strategy — usually expressed
as a portfolio of products (see Chapter 11) — impact the strategic
importance of a project.
 Before or just after launch: No, not lunch. Launch. This should be a last
resort. However, if the development team or the reviewers have reason
to believe that their expectations for the product were way off, or if it
looks like putting the product into market will harm the company’s
brand or existing products, they should bite the bullet here instead of
creating a bigger mess to clean up later.
How to stop a project
Stopping a project is really as simple as saying to the team, “We’ve decided to
stop your project.” The advice in this section centers on how to stop a pro-
ject well – how to take care of team members, how to get value from can-
celled projects, and so on.
When a project hits the cutting-room floor at a review, be sure the develop-
ment team on the project is taken care of. Have your human resource profes-
sionals and your functions make it very clear in their evaluations that project
failure often results from changes in circumstances, discovery of new infor-
mation, and other stuff that’s usually beyond the team’s control. Failure
shouldn’t hurt a team member’s evaluation or his or her chances of promo-
tion. In fact, team members who’ve done an outstanding job on the failed pro-
ject should be in line to get a great project the next time around.
First, management should take great care of the team. Next, management can
turn its attention to the rejected project. You should try to extract all the
243
Chapter 12: Using Reviews to Keep Projects on Track

value that you can from a stopped project. This benefits a company in sev-
eral ways, including helping the development team recognize that the com-
pany values its work. The following list presents some possible sources of
value from stopped projects:
 You may be able to sell or license any intellectual property (IP) you’ve
developed (see Chapter 15 for more on IP).
 You can shelve the project if it seems like it may be worth developing in
the future.
 You can make the customer visits and other market research the team
carried out (see Chapter 4) available to other projects.
 You can divide the project’s resources or what the project has learned
among other new product projects. This can be especially useful if a
team member’s expertise is needed on other projects.
Whenever you stop a project, the development team — and sometimes the
reviewers — should do a post-program assessment of what it has learned.
The team should consider technical discoveries, information about the market
and customers, and process examinations. Often, a process error causes the
breakdown that results in the project’s cancellation. Stopped projects can pro-
vide very valuable information about how well your development process is
working and help you to make the process better for future projects.
The review team owes it to management, and to the people responsible for
NPD strategy (see Chapter 3), to communicate the reasons for the stoppage,
especially if the reasons are strategic and might impact other projects.
Making Review Meetings Work
Good new product phase reviews should be set up like any good business
meeting. They work best when the right people are in attendance, when every-
one comes prepared, when the participants follow a clear agenda, and when
all parties come away with a clear decision and goal to reach before the next
review. We take you through these requirements in the sections that follow.
Inviting the right people to the review
The new product team leader(s) should attend every review, as should most
or all of the members of the new product core team (see Chapter 10 for more
on the team leader and the core and extended teams). The team leader should
invite any members of the extended development team whose specific knowl-
edge the team needs in order to answer questions from the reviewers.
244
Part III: Navigating the River of Product Development 

The other people who attend reviews are, of course, the reviewers. Reviewers
are business and functional heads, managers, and executives who can assess
the merits of the project under review while understanding the larger strate-
gic landscape. The reviewers oversee the resources that the team needs to keep
the project going. Some companies call these people the Project Approval
Committee, or PAC.
The number of people attending a phase review should be kept small enough
to facilitate dialogue. Three to five reviewers can represent functional and busi-
ness interests; five or so team members should attend the review. Reviewers
will generate most of the discussion, with team members presenting the pro-
ject status.
Some companies have standing committees of reviewers; some call reviewers
together as needed for particular projects. Two things to remember:
 Make sure your reviewers know what’s expected of them (see the earlier
section “Train the reviewers to know what to look for”).
 Make sure your reviewers clearly understand the company’s strategic
new product objectives (see Chapter 3), along with the company’s new
product portfolio (see Chapter 11).
Following a clear meeting plan
A new product review meeting needs a clear agenda. It also helps if you have
a facilitator who can lead the group and write key discussion points on a wall
chart. An hour is usually enough for presentation, discussion, and decision —
but you don’t want to waste any of it. For more complex projects, a review
may take up to two hours.
A review usually starts with the team leader or the review committee chair
calling the meeting to order. The leader or chair reminds the attendees of the
purpose of the meeting. The purpose should be a simple variation on this
theme: “The purpose of this meeting is to review the status of the X project,
to address any questions the reviewers may have, and to come to a decision
about the next phase of the project.”
The team then updates the reviewers — briefly — on events that have taken
place since the last review and presents highlights of the business case. Note:
Usually, the team leader will do the presentation, with team members attend-
ing in order to answer questions. However, if a part of the presentation is dicey
and clearly in the lap of one of the functional members, he or she might pre-
sent that part.
245
Chapter 12: Using Reviews to Keep Projects on Track

Smart companies create standard formats for presenting the information so
that reviewers don’t have to figure out what the teams are presenting and
why. As much as possible, your team should present project information
visually and in a format that allows for comparison — both with prior phases
of the project and with other projects.
As part of its presentation, the team should make its recommendation to the
reviewers to continue, hold, or stop the project. You should also make the
necessary decisions very explicit. When co-author Robin facilitated reviews,
she would recommend that the teams have a slide at the beginning of their
presentations entitled “Decisions Needed.” The slide listed all the decisions
needed at that review. The teams would show the same slides at the end of
their presentations.
Invite reviewers to ask questions at any time, but ask them to hold discussion
until set points. Design the presentation so that when you present something
that probably needs discussion, you have a slide announcing that.
Ending with a clear decision
Every phase review should end with a clear decision: The project goes to the
next phase, stops altogether, or requires more work in the current phase. Some
of the issues that may prompt a review board to “hold” (or recycle) a project
include the need to clarify customer requirements (see Chapter 4), demon-
strate technology feasibility (see Chapter 7), or to make sure that the proposed
design can be manufactured (see Chapter 9 for more on “design for x”).
In some companies, reviewers send the new product team away after they’ve
completed their questioning to give themselves a chance to discuss and
decide alone. Other companies complete the whole process with the teams
and reviewers together. Be sure your participants are clear at the beginning
of the meeting about how the decision-making process will unfold.
Companies also differ in how they make the decision. You can vote, in which
case a simple majority wins, or you can work to consensus. It seems best to
us that if any reviewer is firmly opposed to the majority decision, the team
should do some further work to answer the questions that would allow the
reviewers to come to consensus.
What doesn’t work is to have an intermediary communicate the reviewers’
decision to the team. Make sure that the team, or at the very least the team
leader, has a chance to hear the decision in person and ask questions to
understand the reasoning behind it.
246
Part III: Navigating the River of Product Development 

Keeping review records
Every review meeting should have a notetaker present (it’s a good idea to
tape-record and transcribe the proceedings as well). A team member should
have the assignment of circulating the review minutes to the review partici-
pants within 48 hours. Every participant should provide additions and cor-
rections, and the team member should create and circulate the final set of
minutes and add them to the team’s ongoing documentation.
If participants made any explicit requests or promises at the review, the note-
taker should clearly include them as part of the review minutes. When the
requests or promises are carried out, you should note it in the documenta-
tion of the review. Also, if the team and the reviewers suggest a time frame for
the next review, include that in the review minutes, too, and have people add
it to their calendars.
The Prose of Finance and Strategy:
Writing a Project’s Business Case
Companies invest scarce resources in new product development in order 
to get returns on their investments. It doesn’t matter if you think your idea
will revolutionize an industry; if it doesn’t make good business sense, your
company shouldn’t invest in it. How you prove that your project makes good
business sense is with its business case — a document that sets forth the
basic market and technology assumptions of the project, along with the
financial implications of those assumptions. (We included a business case
template in the Appendix which you can use as-is or revise for your projects.)
A business case also can include specific out-of-bounds criteria — metrics,
agreed on by the team and the project reviewers, that define the project’s 
key objectives.
In this section, we look at how a new product team moves from an early, pre-
liminary business case to the full-fledged financial justification it will need as
it moves into the Feasibility Review. We also explain how to update the busi-
ness case as the team moves through the rest of the product development
process (see Chapter 9).
Drafting the preliminary business case
The new product team should draft a preliminary, mini business case (some-
times referred to as a trigger document) as part of defining the product concept.
247
Chapter 12: Using Reviews to Keep Projects on Track

The preliminary business case outlines the requirements for the project and
includes estimates of likely return. At this early stage, the team should use
ranges — “The market for the product is between 100K and 300K,” for exam-
ple. Ranges can accurately represent what the team can know at this point in
the project.
The best way to create a preliminary business case is to start with a docu-
ment that asks for high-level estimates of what you’ll include in the full busi-
ness case. Following are suggestions of what you might include in the
preliminary business case:
 Project overview: Include a one-sentence project “mission” or value
proposition, a brief description of the proposed project, and a brief
description of the product that includes key customer requirements that
the team has identified to date.
 Estimate of resources needed: Include the likely skills and material sup-
port the team will need, and for how long. This is also the place to out-
line possible supply-chain or partnership plans.
 Strategic alignment: Include a statement of the project’s strategic
importance and its alignment with the organization’s strategy.
 Project timing: Include the proposed launch date and a description of
any known factors that might impact timing.
 Market overview: Include key segments and competitor information to
the extent known.
 A brief description of technology to be included, plus any foreseen
technology hurdles: Include important manufacturing and operations
information here as well.
 Overview of legal, regulatory, and other issues: Include plans for
addressing these to the extent known.
 Key parameters that will affect the financial value of the project:
Include range estimates of sales units and volume, cost targets, margins,
and market share.
Be sure to include the names, team roles, and contact information of key
team members, too.
You can’t really know, with any certainty, what it will cost to develop your
product or how long it will take, not to mention exactly who will buy how
many and for how much. Beware of precision without accuracy! As you
create the preliminary business case, use range estimates and advertise your
degree of confidence. Sometimes, even early on, it’s possible to be sure of
some information. Other times, you simply put down a guess. Don’t pretend
to have more information than you really do.
248
Part III: Navigating the River of Product Development 

Factoring in project financials
At some companies, the business case is reduced pretty much to financials. If
that’s the case in your company, we give you some good arguments at the
end of this section as to why relying on financials alone isn’t such a good
idea. However, financials are very important. They’re based on estimates of
market size and share, competitive assessments, and estimated selling
prices. These estimates are part of your launch plan and should be included
in the business case that the team prepares.
The following list presents some ways that companies judge the financial via-
bility of their new product projects:
 Net present value (NPV): The present value of cash inflows minus the
present value of cash outflows (or minus initial investment in most cases).
NPV is a standard method for financial evaluation of long-term projects —
like NPD projects.
 Internal rate of return (IRR): The return rate that a company expects to
earn on the capital it invests.
In general, if the IRR is greater than the project’s cost of capital, or
hurdle rate, the project will add value for the company.
 Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT): Also known as operating
income and operating profit.
In deciding whether to invest in a new product project, executives some-
times compare the firm’s existing earnings potential (or EBIT) with the
profit potential of the investment.
 Shareholder value added (SVA): Will the investment in a new product
return more value to the company’s shareholders than it could earn in
an alternative and safer investment such as risk-free bonds? If so, it will
be an investment that produces a positive SVA.
This alphabet soup includes various ways that companies figure out the likely
value of the projects they spend money on. They all have to do with assess-
ing the cost of capital — how much it really costs the company to spend its
resources today on projects that will not yield results until some time in the
future. Businesses, and their investors, tend to want their money now (if not
yesterday). New product development forces them to use present money and
resources for results that will come in the future. New product teams have to
show executives, shareholders, and reviewers that this makes good sense;
the formulas in the previous list help to do that.
249
Chapter 12: Using Reviews to Keep Projects on Track

Computing/estimating the financials for your project
To compute the financials for your project, you use a combination of estimates.
The estimates usually include expected gross revenue, how much the prod-
uct will cost to produce and distribute (cost of goods sold, or COGS), and
other expenses. To figure your expected net revenue, you add the cost to
develop the product, any capital expenses incurred, and usually some over-
head charge.
Most companies calculate expected revenue over the three-year period when
they expect their products to be at peak sales. This time frame varies, how-
ever, depending on your industry. (For a discussion of product lifecycles, see
Chapter 3.)
Recognizing why companies shouldn’t 
become too fixated on financials
Financials aren’t the whole story. Companies that rely too much on them
tend to pull the risk out of their new product portfolios and end up falling
behind as product developers. The following list outlines a few problems
with the world of project financials:
 Financial estimates can be very uncertain.
 The reason for launching a project may be strategic, not financial. For
example,
• You may launch a product in order to block a competitor’s entry to
a market.
• You may develop a product in order to build technological capac-
ity or capability.
 Sometimes projects that don’t cost much but won’t return much either —
for example, exploratory projects — can position a company for success
downstream.
Keep an eye on the financials of a project, but remember to be honest — with
yourself, your team members, and your reviewers — about how certain you
are of your estimates.
Updating the prelims to draft the 
full business case
When you start with a preliminary business case that asks for the early version
of information that you’ll include later, keeping the business case up-to-date
becomes a normal part of your team’s activities.
250
Part III: Navigating the River of Product Development 

Make sure the checklists that teams use in preparing for reviews (see the sec-
tion “Provide clear guidelines for team deliverables” earlier in this chapter)
include the information that’s necessary for completing and updating the
business case.
In a business case update, your team should make clear exactly what elements
have changed since the last review. The team is involved with the project nearly
every waking moment (and in some sleeping ones, too) between reviews; the
reviewers have had plenty of other tasks on their minds. You should provide
a summary of changes to the business case as a part of the executive summary
(see the earlier section “Do the necessary team prep work”).
Most business cases include three parts:
 Program assumptions and resources: You cover the rationale for the
NPD project, the key financial assumptions (see the previous section),
an assessment of risks and uncertainties, and the team’s request for
resources from the company’s different functions (see Chapter 11).
The team should honestly tell reviewers what the risks and uncertain-
ties of the project are, and the reviewers should be able to discuss these
risks without blaming anyone. Being able to hold frank discussions of
the business case is a good indication that your company has a culture
in which new product development can thrive — a culture of openness,
honesty, and respect.
 Customer satisfaction, competitive landscape, and marketing plan:
You include information about the target market, identified customer
needs for the product (see Chapter 4), and the launch plan to date (see
Chapter 13).
 Product development and production plan: You provide the project
schedule, including target review dates, your plans for research (if any),
and your plans for working with partners and/or suppliers (see Chapter
16). You also include environmental issues, patent/legal issues, and stan-
dards and quality issues in this part of the plan.
You can find a business case template in the Appendix to this book. Feel free
to copy it just as it is, or tailor it to fit your organization’s needs. A big part of
the difference between the full business case and the preliminary business case
is the thoroughness of the information that you should include. To create a
preliminary business case, just weed out the more detailed stuff from the full
case, and be sure to remind people to use estimates and ranges.
Creating out-of-bounds criteria
At the Feasibility Review of the development process (see Chapter 9), the
review committee makes a decision about whether to fund a project, stick it
251
Chapter 12: Using Reviews to Keep Projects on Track

on the shelf, toss it in the scrap heap, or try to sell it to someone else. The
members base their decisions on the information the new product team pro-
vides in its business case.
But what if things change? What if, for example, the target market is smaller
than estimated, meaning that the company will sell fewer products than the
development team was counting on? What if the time and resources neces-
sary are much greater than anticipated? Or, what if it turns out that the tech-
nology you had thought would take a year to develop can be acquired
cheaply, driving your development time from years to months?
During your Feasibility Review, you should specify certain changes that would
affect the business case so seriously that the team would need to call an emer-
gency review. The parameters you specify are known as out-of-bounds criteria.
To specify out-of-bounds criteria for a project, the team sets a range for how
much the net present value (NPV, the value of the resources being spent on
the project) can vary without making a huge difference to the business case.
Other criteria include project schedule and expected return.
By setting out-of-bounds criteria, the team members give the reviewers confi-
dence that the product will be developed in a way that meets the review cri-
teria and that the reviewers will be the first to know if that doesn’t happen —
in time for corrective action, of course. This certainty also motivates review-
ers to let projects move ahead without scheduled reviews, which speeds up the
development process. As long as the team has set clear out-of-bounds crite-
ria, increasing the speed won’t increase the risk. (For more on out-of-bounds
criteria, check out Chapter 9.)

Launching Products for 
Market Success
In This Chapter
 Making preparations for a successful launch
 Creating a plan to execute a great product launch
 Executing a product launch (with the help of some friends)
 Staying on the job after the product gets to market
A
new product’s market success depends on many factors, and a good
launch is certainly one of them. If you’ve identified what your customers
really need (Chapter 4); if you’ve conjured up great ideas for products that
can fulfill those needs and delight your customers (Chapter 5); and if you’ve
assembled a dedicated cross-functional team that has whittled down the
ideas and developed a product by using a well-implemented phase/review
process (Chapters 9 and 10), all your hard work deserves a well-planned and
well-executed launch.
The launch phase is when the company actually releases the product into the
market. It’s kind of like sending Junior off to college. You know there will be
new and different support networks available to him, but you also know that
it’s a huge transition — for you and for him. At this point, all the launch plan-
ning the team has already done and all the new tasks that the team has to
carry out become the central activity of the development team. You’ve exe-
cuted many duties in direct support of the launch — far in advance of push-
ing the “Go!” button on the big day.
In this chapter, you discover that you should start your launch planning early
and in parallel with all the other development activities. You review the ele-
ments of a successful launch. You find out who should complete what tasks
and when they should complete them. Finally, you read up on how to support
your new product in the market well after it has lost its new-car smell. (Our
thanks to Michael Compeau, who provided input, ideas, and edits to this
chapter.)

Preparing for a Successful Launch —
You Gotta Start Early
Many phase/review processes in product development name the last phase
“Launch.” This conveys the idea that the NPD team should work linearly, first
on the business case, then on developing the product, then on testing and
validating, and then — and only then — launch. No! Postponing launch issues
until the last part of the development process is a recipe for disaster. Even
though you can’t actually launch a product until you complete all those other
activities, you can and should start planning your launch right away.
In this way, the launching of a product is no different than the other parts of
the phase/review process (see Chapter 9). If the development team keeps the
entire scope of work in view and starts on activities as early as possible, it
gives the team and the company a much better chance of bringing a success-
ful product to market.
A successful launch requires both administrative tasks and creative thinking,
starting at the beginning of the development process and continuing until the
product has safely set sail in the market. The sections that follow take you
through important steps for planning a successful launch, from naming a
“launch leader” to setting the goals for the launch.
Naming the launch leader
The launch leader is a member of the new product team whom the team
leader counts on to plan and execute the launch.
Team leaders and managers are responsible for naming the launch leader. When
they’re assembling a new product team, they should include a team member
who has launch experience and possesses the qualities you look for in a suc-
cessful leader. The team leaders should recruit the launch leader as a team
member — a member who has the full awareness that leading the launch is
her job. You don’t want to be looking around for a launch leader when the
project is half over — or worse, a few months or weeks before the end!
Launch leaders often come from the marketing function and have experience
in product launches. The launch leader has many responsibilities. She updates
the new product team at regular team meetings about how the launch plan-
ning is going. She also works with the other team members to make sure their
activities and goals stay in sync with her objectives for a successful launch.
For example, launch timing is of critical importance. If the team is developing
a seasonal product, they’ll have a tight window during which they must launch
it. If a competitor is breathing down their necks, speed to market may be
254
Part III: Navigating the River of Product Development 

essential. To meet an essential deadline, the launch leader may work with the
team and the reviewers to eliminate a product feature in order to get the
product to the market on time.
Pulling together the launch team
One of the launch leader’s first tasks is to assemble a team of people who can
carry out the activities of launch planning and execution — a launch team,
which is an extension of the core NPD cross-functional team. Launching a
product, like coming up with the idea and developing it, requires a breadth of
skills and experience. At a minimum, the launch team needs people who can
plan and carry out the following (you can read more about these tasks in the
section “Forming the Launch Plan”):
 Market research (see the following section)
 Supply chain management
 Distribution and channel planning and coordination
 Training for sales and service
Some of the people on the launch team will be members of the core cross-
functional team. For the core team members, planning and executing the
launch is only a part of their NPD job, but their participation as a part of the
launch team is critical. They’re the ones who can tie in other aspects of the
project — product design, product testing, manufacturing, and so on — with
the launch plans.
But for many product launches, the launch leader will need additional skills
and experience. These additional people come from different business func-
tions, such as marketing, sales, customer service, and distribution. You can
think of them as the “extended” launch team — resources that the launch
leader needs to carry out her duties — and their relationship to the new
product team is through the launch leader.
In Chapter 10, you find out how to form cross-functional NPD teams and the
extended teams that help them carry out the project tasks.
Understanding marketing’s role
Marketing employees are integral to making sure that a new product suc-
ceeds in the marketplace. The launch leader must make sure that the launch
and core teams are working on marketing issues while they’re designing and
developing the product. The following list presents the key roles of the mar-
keting members on the new product team.
255
Chapter 13: Launching Products for Market Success

Although all these roles are important to the launch process, the ones in bold
are roles that the launch leader, usually a marketing team member, should lead.
 Participating in customer visits (see Chapter 4)
 Participating in idea generation sessions (see Chapter 5)
 Conducting market research throughout the development process —
market segmentation and testing, product use testing (Alpha and Beta),
and so on (see Chapter 17)
 Forecasting market and sales projections (see The PDMA Handbook of
New Product Development, 2nd Edition, edited by Kenneth B. Kahn
[Wiley] for more on forecasting)
 Establishing launch goals (see the following section)
 Creating the launch plan (see the section “Forming the Launch Plan”):
• Rollout strategy
• Channel strategy
• Sales training plan
• Customer service plan
• Test marketing and customer trials
• Pricing strategy
• Supply chain management
 Performing a post-launch evaluation (see the section “Factoring In
Post-Launch Evaluations”)
 Planning for product obsolescence
Establishing goals for a successful launch
The launch leader and team members, working with the core team, should
use the project’s business case (see Chapters 9 and 12) to guide them in
establishing what’s required for a launch to be successful. The key launch
objectives that the team should track include the following:
 Gaining market share and market penetration
 Solid financial performance, including sales
 High quality and customer satisfaction
The goals in the previous list aren’t like the final report card you got when you
graduated from high school. These are formative metrics. The core team and
the launch team should develop the product with these goals in mind, and
they should track a product’s actual performance against these objectives.
256
Part III: Navigating the River of Product Development 

Often, taking corrective action after a launch can be the difference between
success and failure (see the section “Factoring In Post-Launch Evaluations”).
Be sure that the formative metrics your team chooses are actionable. In other
words, the information has to get to the team quickly so members can respond,
it has to be accurate so they can respond correctly, and the responses have
to be within the team’s ability. Tracking sales numbers is a good example of
an actionable metric if the metric is clear. For example, the metric might include
sales volume and sales growth over time, excluding promotional sales.
Forming the Launch Plan
The launch plan, which the launch leader creates (but be sure to involve the
rest of the core team!), is a set of strategies that guide the launch team in exe-
cuting a successful launch. Launching a product has been compared to a
three-ring circus — one in which each ring features high-wire acts, jugglers,
balancing acts, and wild-animal shows. The core NPD team (see Chapter 10)
may feel pressure and confusion as it develops the product, but many people
report that that’s nothing compared to what the launch team has to deal with
as the product moves from the relative protection of the company into the
big, wide world.
The following sections discuss the various actions you need to take to create
a complete launch plan.
Creating a rollout strategy
You’ve finished designing and developing the product, and you’ve produced
enough inventory to support the launch. It’s time to open the factory doors
257
Chapter 13: Launching Products for Market Success
Product introduction versus product launch
At an International Association for Product
Development (IAPD) workshop in 2000,
Professor Jean-Philippe Deschamps of IMD in
Switzerland pinpointed the difference between
introducing an incremental innovation and
launching a radical innovation. Introducing a
“new-and-improved” version of an existing
product should be a smooth process that
extends or shifts market demand. On the other
hand, launching a completely new product
requires mobilization of a company’s marketing
and sales forces and the creation of new
demand in the marketplace. The more radical
your new product ideas are, the more you need
the advice in this chapter and book as a whole!
Note: From the point of view of launch, radical
includes both technology newness and market
newness.

and let the product “roll out” into the market (even if your product didn’t get
produced in a factory). The rollout strategy helps define how your product
will get to market. You can introduce the product in one of two ways:
 Hard launch: You introduce the product all at once. With a hard launch,
you have to orchestrate it so that you introduce the product simultane-
ously in all your target markets.
 Rolling launch: You introduce the product in a sequence of different
markets. With this strategy, also known as a soft launch, you more liter-
ally roll out the product into the market in successive waves. Often, you
start with one channel or region first, and then you expand into more
markets as manufacturing flow and sales build.
Rolling launches can be easier to coordinate, but communication and
digitization (see Chapter 14) in today’s world make it harder to execute
a rolling launch. You may find customers wondering why your product
isn’t available in their areas or, worse yet, competitors moving in to
block your access to certain markets.
The launch leader must help the NPD team determine the right rollout strat-
egy for a product, taking into consideration all the issues in the following list.
Notice that the launch leader and the launch team can’t decide many of these
issues on their own. The NPD core team as a whole should look at the issues
these questions raise and decide what makes the most sense for the product
to achieve success in the market:
 How important is speed to market for the product and “first-mover”
advantage in the product or service category? If you answer “very,”
you’re looking at a hard launch.
 Can competitors easily move in after you launch your product? If so,
you may want to protect your position with a hard launch.
 Can you stay ahead of the competition by innovating faster than they
can? If you can, the slower pace of a staged rolling launch may work
best for you.
 How much of the product can you produce in time to support your
launch? Can you produce enough product, get it distributed, and put it
on the shelves in order to support a hard launch? If you can’t, a rolling
launch may be your only option.
 How much territory are your sales and service people ready to sup-
port? You should do a rolling launch if you need the extra time to get
sales and service up to speed throughout your market.
Here are a few ways that companies take advantage of very small beginnings
in order to build up into a larger launch:
 Can you target a specific customer group to jump-start your launch?
Sometimes, you can create a buzz and excitement about your product if
258
Part III: Navigating the River of Product Development 

you soft launch to a particular customer group. The minimal launch will
act as a “promotion” for the successive rolling waves.
 Can you start by selling the product through an easy-to-manage chan-
nel? For example, if you can sell the product through your own dealers
first, you can conduct a limited launch during which you discover how
customers respond to the product. Depending on the response, you can
get ready to move to the larger markets. You might also discover
changes that would make your product more attractive in the market.
 Can you start by selling the product online? Some products succeed
through Internet sales before their companies start selling in more tradi-
tional channels.
You also need to know how much product differentiation you need in order to
sell in different markets and how soon you can create it. If your product will
be identical in every market in which you plan to launch, a hard launch could
work best. If, however, you need to tailor the product — providing instructions
in different languages, adjusting for different regulatory hurdles, or changing
functionality to serve customers in different markets, for instance — a rolling
launch may be your best bet.
Before you can launch your product, you may need regulatory approvals. It is
up to the core team, and usually the technical members in particular, to antici-
pate and secure regulatory approval. However, it’s a good idea for the launch
leader to make sure that the NPD team gets these approvals in time for launch.
And if you plan to launch in different markets or geographies that require dif-
ferent approvals, the launch leader should make sure the team is managing
this as well. You can stage a rolling launch so that you secure approvals in
time for each successive wave, or you can secure all the approvals in time for a
hard launch. Make the decision based on what’s best for launch success.
Determining how your new product will
work with (or replace) your existing ones
Launching a new product often means displacing, or cannibalizing, existing
products. Your company’s new product and launch teams don’t have a per-
mission slip to launch a new product into a market without first considering
its impact on the products you already have there.
How you choose to relate the new product to an existing product depends on the
place of the new product in your overall product portfolio (see Chapter 11 for
more on product portfolios). Do you want the introduction of the new product
to sustain sales in the channel or to contribute to growth of the product line?
Do you want to undermine the efforts of a competitor or enhance your brand
image? Do you aim to go after a whole new market or technology opportunity?
259
Chapter 13: Launching Products for Market Success

The answers to these questions will help your team make better decisions
about how to place the new product in the ongoing mix of products and sales.
You can use several approaches to dovetail your launch strategy for a new
product with your existing products (notice that most of these strategies
need to be planned early in the product development process, when you’re
selecting concepts and designing the product):
 Plan for the retirement or the phasing out of the product that you’re
replacing to coincide with the introduction of the new product. Your
new MP3 player’s launch might be just the right time to pull the old one
off the shelves. If you’ve got too much inventory for that, consider moving
the old one to some out-of-the-way markets so that the new one can take
center stage in your most important ones.
 Identify new markets in which the new product could be successful,
and launch in those markets. You may look to different geographies,
industries, or even price points. You can keep your new kitchen product
from competing with your existing ones if it’s pricier (and, of course, has
more and better features) or if it’s designed for small spaces, summer
homes, or trailers.
 Price your new and improved product higher than your existing prod-
uct. Expect to cannibalize sales of the existing product and to phase it out
over time. If you’re coming out with a new and improved inkjet printer,
for example, take advantage of putting a higher price on it. Some people
will buy the old, lower cost one; people who buy the higher priced one will
feel they’re getting more value because they can compare with the old
one; and as you whittle down your inventory on the old one, you’ll fore-
stall the inevitable day when your fancy new printer prices will also have
to drop to meet price pressure from competitors.
 Price your new and somewhat slimmed-down product lower than your
existing product. Expect to attract customers for whom the current
product is too pricey. This strategy is the opposite of the one in the pre-
vious bullet. Suppose you have a printer on the market with all the bells
and whistles; you might introduce one with fewer of these and attract
new customers. Do your research to make sure that your higher end cus-
tomers won’t migrate to the lower price product! And be sure that if this
is your strategy, you’ve designed a product platform (see Chapter 3) so
that you don’t have to reinvent the whole wheel when you develop the
new product.
Flipping through possible 
channel strategies
Many companies, instead of selling their products directly to the end-user
customer, go through channel partners. These are the dealers, distributors,
260
Part III: Navigating the River of Product Development 

and retailers who help to distribute and actually sell your product. They
include exclusive dealers, like Harley-Davidson’s network, retailers like
Shaw’s and Stop-and-Shop, and the huge outlets like Wal-Mart and Sears.
Many companies design successful products with the requirements of channel
partners in mind. As the NPD team builds its understanding of the customer
(see Chapter 4), it also should include market players besides the end-user —
and the channels through which the team intends to market the product
often play an important role.
Here are a few approaches to channel strategy design. Don’t limit your think-
ing to these alone — here’s a good place for your team to be creative!
 Many new product launches are successful because their product devel-
opment teams recruit downstream channel partners as dedicated launch
partners well before the launch. These teams carefully coordinate activi-
ties to ensure a clockwork-like success when the time comes to launch
into the channels. This strategy is particularly common when teams work
with large retailers like The Home Depot, Wal-Mart, and Target, but you
can apply the logic to any reseller channel.
 Many companies recruit dealer networks to distribute and sell their
products. Some dealers are exclusive — they carry only products from
one company — and some are not. For example, a dealer/distributor of
lawn and garden equipment will carry Toro and John Deere and what-
ever other brands sell well in its territory.
 Many companies work with wholesale distributors to make sure that
their products get onto the shelves at your local supermarkets or book-
stores or into retail shops like K-Mart.
Sometimes, channel partners work closely with the product developers to
design products that appeal to their customers and/or fill out their offerings.
The NPD team brings its intimate understanding of what the customer wants
or needs, and the channel partner brings its understanding of what products
may be missing on its shelves and what products it can sell. The channel
partner functions almost like a member of the team; however, don’t forget
that the channel partner holds many of the cards. With this strategy, you give
up a degree of independence in exchange for the likelihood — but seldom a
guarantee — of a successful launch.
The channel strategy you choose can impact product design, development,
packaging, and timing. The launch team members should thoroughly review
their recommendations for a channel strategy and do the same with mem-
bers of the new product team. Otherwise, the team is headed for disappoint-
ment when it discovers that the product it has developed cannot be
packaged in a way that meets retailers’ needs, for example.
261
Chapter 13: Launching Products for Market Success

Training your sales and service teams 
to support the new product
The launch team needs to plan for any necessary sales and service efforts. If
your company has a sales force that will drive the sales of the product, the
launch team needs to provide for the necessary training. As part of the train-
ing, the sales force also needs any manuals, instructions, and other materials
that go with the product.
The NPD team may need to complete some actual products that you can use
for this training well ahead of the launch date. This is only one of the circum-
stances that may speed up the need for at least a limited manufacturing run.
Others include various kinds of new product testing (see Chapter 17) as well
as test marketing (see “Utilizing test marketing and consumer trials” later in
this chapter).
If you’re launching a new drug, the sales force has to be able to talk to the
doctors on the level that the doctors will respect. “Hey, your patients are
gonna love this one!” just won’t do. The sales force needs training in the
results of clinical studies, comparison with other medications, benefits and
side effects, and so on. If your new product is a machine for baking bread tar-
geted at high-end restaurants, your sales people had better be prepared to
demonstrate to people who already know a lot about bread baking!
In the same way, a service force may need to receive training before the
launch. This may include workers who run a call center and the personnel
who make visits to the customers. Good use of Beta Testing — testing the
product in the hands of friendly customers — can help iron out any service
issues. The launch team can take responsibility for training a small core team
during Beta Site tests, and this team can provide expertise to a larger team
when the product is launched. (Take a look at Chapter 17 for more on Beta
Testing; the next section talks more about customer trials.)
Utilizing test marketing 
and consumer trials
When you use a test market, you make a limited amount of the product you’re
developing available to a small market, and the NPD and launch teams use
the experience to improve the product and their launch/market strategies.
You benefit from some obvious advantages by dribbling product into the
market, including the following:
 If the product fails, only a small portion of your customers will know.
 You can assess consumer response to the product, including packaging,
pricing, and use.
262
Part III: Navigating the River of Product Development 

 You get some real stories from satisfied customers to beef up your pro-
motion and sales when you fully launch the product.
 You can test and improve the logistical aspects of the launch: coordinat-
ing with suppliers, manufacturing in quantity, shipping, dealing with
your dealers and distributors, and so on (see the earlier section
“Creating a rollout strategy” for more).
Test marketing comes with considerable risk. Your competitors may find out
about your new product and try to beat you to a wider launch. Because of
this, test marketing has become less popular in recent years. We live in an
“instant” society where news travels fast and people want everything now or
earlier — including your company’s investors, who may see test marketing as
a way of delaying their share of the goodies.
So how can you decide whether to launch in a test market? If you’re one of
the big guys, we suggest using these only when you’re dealing with an impor-
tant customer — one you’d actually like to get involved early. A manufacturer
of breast imaging technology placed its brand new technology with a single
customer to get early results, for example. After the equipment proves suc-
cessful there, it plans to ramp up distribution to other sites.
There are surely other times when a limited introduction may be appropriate.
Could you get famous socialites to chew your new bubble gum before you
introduce it to the wider public? Go ahead, by all means! But our general rule
here is caution.
On the other hand, if you’re one of the little guys, limited launch and test mar-
keting may be all you can really do. Find the best place to start — perhaps
with a customer whose status in the industry will attract other customers —
and keep your marketing pace in line with your ability to produce, distribute,
sell, and service your product.
You have to support test marketing with adequate amounts of product —
including literature, packaging, instructions, and the training of sales and ser-
vice people. Don’t underestimate the need to be “almost ready” for a full
launch when you move into the market in a limited fashion.
Instead of thinking “test market,” think “consumer trial.” Consumer trials are
often called Beta Tests (see Chapter 17 for more on these kinds of tests). The
next time a Web site offers you a chance to participate in a Beta Test, go ahead.
See for yourself how they work, and consider whether a consumer trial could
be beneficial as you develop and launch a new product.
Establishing a price
Pricing is a key factor in launch success. Too high and no one will buy it; too
low and you’ve left cash on the table. The problem is, there is no simple way
263
Chapter 13: Launching Products for Market Success

to decide what’s “too high” or “too low.” Even when the product is in the
market, you can’t always pin success or failure on price points.
So no wonder pricing isn’t a job that most NPD or launch teams want to take
on. But achieving the project’s goals — the objectives that you establish in the
business case (see Chapters 9 and 12, as well as the Appendix) — depend on
your pricing strategy. A product’s pricing strategy is where the rubber hits the
road. Will your new product live up to its financial predictions or fall short?
Calculating a range
Your first job is to establish a range within which your price will fall. One of
the simplest ways to do this is to determine the lowest price at which the
company will see return on its investment, and then establish the highest
price it could possibly expect because of the product’s perceived value in the
customer’s eyes. To do this, the NPD team, with the help of the launch leader,
has to establish two parameters:
 Cost: Be very clear about the cost of the project and the product — what
it has or will cost the company to develop the product, and what it costs
each time it produces and sells one. The cost defines the threshold at
which the company will lose or make money on the project.
Every time you spend more on the project, you add a little to the overall
amount that the product must regain in the market. But each time you add
as much as a penny to the product cost, you add a financial burden to the
product that will have to be figured in over its lifecycle. Beware of adding
that cute detail that might skim margin from your product for its entire life!
 Value: Establishing the value of a product starts at the beginning, with
customer visits (see Chapter 4). By visiting customers, listening to them,
and observing their work processes, you’ll begin to understand the 
benefit — financial or otherwise — that customers get from buying and
using your product.
Setting a price
After you establish a range — the space between cost and value — you can
nail down the actual price you want to set. The launch team and the new
product team should consider the following factors:
 The competition: How much are other, similar products selling for? If that’s
at the high end of your range, you might get away with a higher price; if at
the lower, you might have to charge less. If it’s in the basement (defined by
your costs), shame on you for developing it in the first place!
 Distributors/sales force/channel partners: What percent of the selling
price will go to the folks who get your product to the customers? If you
can sell your product directly, you’ll get 100 percent (but be sure to add
the cost to the company of maintaining its sales force and distribution
network when you calculate the cost to produce the product).
264
Part III: Navigating the River of Product Development 

 Discounts: Will you offer savings (to large or loyal customers, for exam-
ple)? How much? Your price might be toward the upper end of the range,
but discounts will eat away at profits. Be sure to address this in your cal-
culations. And don’t forget: If discounts mean that you’re going to sell
more, they may well be worth it. Plus, there are some industries, like
software, where customers expect a discount nowadays.
 Markets: Will you offer the product at different price points in different
markets? It can be a good strategy, for example, to pin a few dollars or
cents onto product that’s sold in places where the overall cost of living
is higher. Buyers in those demographics tend to be less price-conscious
than buyers where a higher price compares unfavorably with other
costs in their region.
 Features: Another variable is product features. Many manufacturers
create entire lines of products from low-end vanilla to high-end almond-
soy latte. An example of this is blenders. You can get the cheapest one,
which will do the trick. Or you can get the most expensive one, which
will chop, dice, whirl, heat, bake, set the table — whoops, we’re going
overboard here. Manufacturers have found that giving customers all
these choices pushes them toward the middle of the range, where they
probably spend more than if they only had three choices. And a smart
product line strategy (see Chapter 3) allows the manufacturer to pro-
duce all this diversity with not much added product development time
and cost.
 The profit model: Where and how will this product produce revenue?
Some products depend on sales price, and others depend on down-
stream services or media (think razors/razor blades). Some may even be
“loss-leaders,” which lure customers to buy your other products. (See
Chapter 2 for more on the profit model.)
No one priceing stratregy fits all products or companies. If one does, it’s like
Plato’s “Ideal Forms”: there, but unknowable. You should come up with a rea-
sonable price by considering all the issues; and then be ready to alter your
pricing strategy if it doesn’t work.
You can always lower the price, but you rarely can raise it!
When establishing the launch price, the teams involved should also consider
the pricing strategy for the product’s lifecycle. Will you introduce the product
at a high price point and lower it as competitors apply pressure? Will the
product be patented, such as a drug, and have to gain as much revenue as
possible before the competition kicks in the door? Is the product a fashion or
a fad that will have to make a killing this season? Is the product part of a
product line or platform that will reap its return over the course of many
related offerings? (Check out Chapter 3 for more on the intricacies and the
importance of the product lifecycle.)

Chapter 13: Launching Products for Market Success

Managing the supply chain
If your company is designing, developing, and manufacturing the whole prod-
uct, you can skip this section (no, really, we don’t mind). Most likely, however,
you’re developing the product with suppliers and partners (see Chapters 15
and 16), which complicates your launch planning and execution. Not only do
you have to make sure your internal teams have the product ready, in suffi-
cient quantity, for launch, but you also have to make sure your external sup-
pliers and partners are coordinated. And by “you,” we mean the launch team.
Many of the issues that the launch team has to manage are the direct result
of the project’s partner/supplier strategy. You can read more about partner/
supplier strategy in Chapter 16, and if you’re on the launch team, we recom-
mend that you do that. Here are some suggestions for succeeding in this very
complex activity:
 Know exactly who your suppliers are, what their deliverables are, and
what the due dates are. That sounds simple, but with use of international
sources growing every day, it’s easy for a team to overlook a supplier
until it becomes apparent that a needed part is missing.
 Keep track of your low-cost suppliers. Make sure they are delivering,
and also keep your eyes out for better deals. You can increase a prod-
uct’s chances of success by finding a switch that costs less than the one
you were planning on.
 Be sure that the core team is “overcommunicating” with its suppliers
and partners. Manage that by being willing to ask the “dumb” questions
at meetings. “When you say ‘switch,’ does that mean the switch for the
on/off button or the switch for the digital/analog switch-over? Does our
supplier know exactly which one it is?” Confusions about things like that
have led to the downfall of many product plans.
 Act quickly if it looks like a supplier or partner won’t come through.
As far as possible, anticipate breakdowns instead of letting them sur-
prise you. Here again, asking dumb questions can save the day. “I know
you said you’d have that last order in early next week, but can you tell
me exactly how much you’ve done, and whether there’s any chance
you’ll miss the deadline?” And here’s also where having a list of alternate
suppliers can sometimes help to fill in gaps.
 Coordinate schedules between the NPD team and the suppliers. If your
launch team works with the NPD team from the beginning, you can avoid
having too little inventory or too much inventory.
 Vet your partners and suppliers very carefully. You don’t want the NPD
team to outsource part of the development and production to a partner
266
Part III: Navigating the River of Product Development 

that may not be able to come through, for example. An advantage of
more intimate supplier/partner relationships (see Chapter 16) is that
you know the company better, you’ve developed communication path-
ways, and it has more commitment to meeting your needs.
You want as little supplies and products in inventory as possible. Try to
apply Lean principles (see Chapter 11) to make sure that your supply chain
delivers only the amount of raw materials and finished goods that you need.
The mantra in business is “just in time,” not “just in case.”
Planning for public relations 
(buzz and chatter)
All too often, development and launch teams postpone public relations work
until three days before they’re ready to put the product into boxes. That
strategy is bad for you and for your product. In an age when the hippest
bands — and products! — have Web pages on myspace.com, and the buzz
online is about the next social media channels, you don’t want to fall too far
behind. Your marketing team members — and your youngest, hippest team
members (even if they’re accountants) — should be thinking about how to
obtain plenty of free press coverage about your product. And they should be
thinking well before, during, and after your launch.
In order to decide what and when information should be made public, the
launch team and the new product team have to consider issues like tipping off
the competition, getting customers excited too long before product is avail-
able, and so on. The timing varies by industry, by product, and by market.
But don’t let that warning keep you from creating a buzz. Here are a few ways
to go about that:
 For starters, every industry has a trade journal. These journals often
publish announcements of products for free — if you get copy to them
by their deadlines, which usually come three weeks before the publica-
tion dates. (Of course, they’re even more likely to do this “for free” if
your company places ads in their journals!)
Do a bit of research to find a handful of print publications that make good
candidates for your launch press release. You also can send information —
and sometimes samples — to editors who may review your product.
 Similarly, scour the Internet for blogs and other social media sites that
serve as the mileposts of would-be authorities in your product or serv-
ice category. Well in advance of your launch, recruit these personalities
267
Chapter 13: Launching Products for Market Success

to serve on an informal product-advisory team. They’ll help you identify
other places where your product can be promoted, and they’ll also be
able to identify — perhaps better than you can — what about your prod-
uct is most likely to bring on the buzz.
 Be creative — ply them with T-shirts, free software, key fobs, hats, and so
on. Many online mavens who publish blogs spend hours writing and influ-
encing readers with their opinions. If you land a few strong and influential
opinions in your corner, you can reap some handsome dividends — not
only with great feedback during the development process but also with
reader persuasion, all the way through your launch and beyond.
Get your core team members, and any other people who are working with
you on the product development effort, to talk with like-minded people in the
media outlets who cover your industry. For example, you can assign a team
engineer to contact a journalist who has a technical bent. They speak the
same language and may bond over your product features.
Double-Checking the Details
Before you go public, it’s a good idea to make sure one more time that you’ve
covered your bases. Consider the following:
 Revalidate the original value proposition for your product versus the
current market and competitive situation. You’ve been checking into
the market and competitive situations all through the development
process, right? At the end, you should make one last check to be sure
that the need you want to fill, the fad you want to introduce, or the prob-
lem you want to fix is still compelling. Also, make sure your competitors
haven’t done anything to make your product obsolete, or nearly so.
 Double-check that all your marketing/sales collateral and launch sup-
port materials are ready. Make sure your sales force and your channel
support people are fully supported. They need instructional materials —
translated into the languages that they’ll use when selling your product.
They need brochures and flyers, and samples of the product.
 Confirm that all relevant training has taken place or is ready to go.
Your sales and customer-service teams should receive training before
the product launch (see the section “Training your sales and service
teams to support the new product”). If you need training for customers,
that should be ready as well. And if your service teams need to be
trained to deliver training, make it so!
268
Part III: Navigating the River of Product Development 

 Develop detailed announcements and demo packages, and obtain
approval for public notices and advertising. This isn’t the time for gen-
eral or hazy ideas or last-minute administrative red tape. Right before
the launch is the time for putting final ink to paper.
 Make sure that you’ve tested and trialed all your internal systems
(billing, supply, manufacturing, and so on) for full release of the prod-
uct. Don’t forget how many internal systems have to be up and running
to support your product. You don’t want your distributors to run out of
product, and you don’t want customers to complain because they
weren’t billed on time or accurately.
Try creating a checklist that your launch team can use to coordinate all the
complex activities that go on before a launch. You can use the one shown 
in Figure 13-1; we recommend that you tailor it to fit your team’s and com-
pany’s needs.

Chapter 13: Launching Products for Market Success

Factoring In Post-Launch Evaluations
Your product is in the market. Your sales force is selling, and your product
channels are stocking and selling. The service reps are documenting any
reported problems, and they’re doing their jobs in installation and customer
training. Perhaps the NPD team members are looking around for their next
jobs or returning to their old ones.
Now, however, isn’t the time for the launch team to disband. For the first
months after a launch — often for up to a year — the launch team must keep
its eye on things. Keep the following questions in mind and be prepared to
make changes:
 Is the product meeting its goals?
 What problems do we need to iron out?
 What new opportunities have presented themselves now that the prod-
uct is in the market?
The launch team can make a huge difference for the company by staying
involved as the product moves from the introduction phase to the growth
phase of the product lifecycle (see Chapter 3 for more on the product 
lifecycle).

Part IV
New Challenges 
in Product
Development

In this part . . .
H
ere we explore three trends in product development:
the digitization of information, globalization, and
partnering. These trends are changing the product devel-
opment landscape and making the job of the product
developer even more challenging — and potentially even
more rewarding.
One thing we can tell you for sure: The more our world
shrinks, the more our work becomes global. And the more
we rely on each other to fulfill our business objectives,
the more imperative it is to implement the core practices
we present in Parts I, II, and III.

is blowing, and then go back to the other parts to make
sure your company has the foundation it needs to stand
strong in that wind!

Chapter 14
Developing Products 
in the Digital Age
In This Chapter
 Testing and experimenting with digital technology
 Synchronizing your new product strategy
 Organizing your innovations with information technology
C
an you remember way back in the early 1990s when you couldn’t com-
municate by e-mail unless you both used the same software? Have we
made you feel old? Sorry! Those days have flashed by so fast. In today’s
world, anyone and everyone can own a computer and operate a Web site. You
can send e-mail to anyone anywhere in the world with at least 90 percent cer-
tainty that the message will get there and that the person you sent it to will
be able to open it.
The digital age has transformed not only how people communicate, but also
how they manage projects and integrate actions with business strategy. We’re
sure that you and your company are already somewhat “digital” and that digi-
tal technology influences how you work — alone and with others.
In this chapter, you find out how companies are developing products in the
digital age. We discuss how digital information enables new forms of product
testing and experimentation. You find out how digital technology can help
your teams come together. And we show you how information technology
can help you become organized and efficient.
As you read this chapter, you can expect to broaden your horizons for how
“digitization” can help you be more effective in your product development
endeavors. However, these days are still the early days of the digital age, and
plenty of pitfalls dot the opportunity landscape. You have to move cautiously
and think long term. But you also have to realize that without some imple-
mentation of the available tools, you aren’t likely to be competitive in this
day and age. We hope that you come away with some healthy skepticism and
some basic rules for avoiding digital pitfalls. (Our thanks to Scott Elliott for his
help with this chapter, all of which he provided through digital technologies.)

Using Digital Technology 
to Test and Experiment
“Never before,” Stefan Thomke tells readers in the introduction to his book
Experimentation Matters (Harvard Business School Press), “has it been so eco-
nomically feasible to ask ‘what-if’ questions and [get] . . . answers.” Today’s
product development teams use digital technology to run tests and experi-
ments that were prohibitively expensive and/or time-consuming in the past.
As a result, companies can model early product ideas, test for quality, and
simulate system integration long before they actually develop the products.
They can get nearly instant customer feedback throughout the product devel-
opment process. This fast feedback pushes the most critical decisions to the
beginning of the product development process, where teams can make changes
to design with the least amount of rework and other negative impact.
Modeling, simulating, and prototyping give companies ways to represent things
they want to learn more about, to manipulate, to iterate, or to change. The
terms cover a lot of ground. They can cover clay models, mathematical models,
crash-test simulations, and digital prototypes. What they have in common,
though, is that they can provide information about things that are too big or
too expensive to be investigated on their own, or that maybe don’t yet exist
(like a new product). Michael Schrage, in his book Serious Play (Harvard
Business School Press), tells readers that the three terms — modeling, simu-
lating, and prototyping — have become different “flavors,” and that they all
point to how people “use technology to re-create some aspect of reality that
matters to us.”
Tests and experiments can tell you that you’re on the right track, that another
track may be better, or that you’re on the path to failure. Most people prefer
to get good news — that their projects are on the right track. However, tests
and experiments can be most useful when teams welcome the bad news as
well. Leaders and managers need to make the value of uncovering negative
results explicit. Knowing upfront that the technology you need to meet a key
customer requirement can’t be developed within schedule and budget allows
you to make other plans — to substitute a different project, or perhaps to
change the schedule and/or the budget. To discover the missing technology a
month before the scheduled launch leaves you with no good options. To help
employees accept the negative, try to lighten it up a bit, maybe by giving
rewards or prizes for the teams or people who uncover the negatives.
The following sections present some of the ways that your development team
can use digital technologies to test and simulate new products in the develop-
ment pipeline. Be sure you take note of the limitations of these technologies
along with their benefits! (See Chapter 17 for more on prototyping and other
kinds of product testing.)
274
Part IV: New Challenges in Product Development 

Computer simulation
Computer simulation allows a team to produce a model that behaves — right
on the computer — like the product the team is designing. If you’ve ever played
a video game, you know how powerful computer simulations can be in show-
ing the consequences of different inputs to a situation. A team may use com-
puter simulation in the following kinds of situations:
 When it needs to model vast amounts of data. For example, the human
genome project is based on computer simulation. It enables scientists to
understand the interactions and functions of human genes and has led
to whole new industries based on genetically modified or genetically tar-
geted products.
 When doing an actual experiment is dangerous or expensive. Finding
out how your product may behave in extreme situations provides great
information for your design team. For example, car manufacturers use
computer simulations to model car crashes. Face it, you’d rather crash a
car in a simulation than wreck a real one. And in fact you can usually
learn more about the effects of a crash from a simulation than from a
real crash.
Simulation is a powerful tool, but it has limitations. Here are a few things to
watch out for:
 Not all situations can or should be simulated. Often, creating a clay
model or a prototype is easier (see the following section). But don’t give
up too quickly. Imagine designing a tennis ball and being able to model
its elasticity, the way it bounces in different temperatures and on different
surfaces, and the durability of the cover in different situations. It could
take you years to develop that kind of information in the “real world”!
 Your teams need to have access to a large amount of computer power
and know-how. If you lack either of these, but you really think simula-
tion will provide important information, consulting firms can help you —
for a price, of course!
 Some of the information a simulation provides may not be accepted by
everyone involved. For example, some regulatory bodies may require
“real” rather than simulated experiments. Make sure your stakeholders
and customers will accept the results of a simulation before you rely on it.
Rapid prototyping
In the old days, it took product development teams weeks or even months to
build prototypes in order to test their designs. Bottlenecks in a company’s
275
Chapter 14: Developing Products in the Digital Age

model shop often held up product projects because too many teams tried to
get their models done at the same time. Today, teams have resources — known
as rapid prototyping — that enable them to build prototypes easily and quickly.
One method, called stereolithography (a process in which a computer lays down
thousands of tiny layers of material that quickly form a 3-D model of the prod-
uct), is widely used to create actual models of products in a fraction of the
time it used to take. (See Chapter 9 for more information on how prototyping
fits into the product development process.)
Teams can use prototypes to show any of the following things:
 Form: showing how the product would look
 Fit: showing how the different parts would fit together in the final product
 Function: showing how the product would work
Be careful! Rapid prototyping is a heady thing. You almost can snap your fin-
gers and produce a viable model of a product that had been just a gleam in
your eye. This would seem to be nothing but a great thing; however, teams
that use this technology can fall prey to “feature creep.” The lure of “just one
more” motivates them to add on feature after feature until they’ve strayed
away from the business cases they’re supposed to be fulfilling by adding fea-
tures, cost, and time to the project. See Chapter 12 for advice on how you can
keep your projects on the straight and narrow.
Combinatorial chemistry
Are you in the drug business, or in any industry that requires your company to
sort through hundreds and thousands of possible chemical combinations? If so,
good news for you: New advances in chemistry experimentation now allow drug
companies to synthesize thousands of potential molecules and compounds that
are possible candidates in drug development. Scientists can now create vast
“libraries” of chemical compounds that drug manufacturers screen to find new
drugs. Established pharmaceutical companies often get into combichem through
an alliance or a merger with a company that has the technology.
Although combichem is a chemical process, we include it here because the
methodology requires researchers to handle vast amounts of data. Combichem
would not have been possible without advances in computer power gained in
the digital age.
Combinatorial chemistry has been a great boon to the pharmaceutical indus-
try among others, but it also brings challenges. The output of combichem
often isn’t as accurate or as pure as the information that comes from experi-
ments executed in traditional ways. Also, drug companies have had to
276
Part IV: New Challenges in Product Development 

revamp the rest of their drug-discovery processes in order to deal with the
huge number of chemical candidates.
For more information on the uses of product testing in the digital age, take a
look at Stefan Thomke’s book, Experimentation Matters (Harvard Business
School Press). It covers the topics we introduce here in much more depth.
Using Digital Technologies 
for Team Collaboration
When everyone worked in the same room, or at least in the same building or
the same city, managing information wasn’t such a big deal. Many teams had
“war rooms,” where product and project information was displayed perma-
nently on the walls. Big sheets of paper displayed schedules, technology
maps, customer requirements, and other important product and project
information. Teams held meetings in the war room so everyone could look at
the same information. Teams would update information after meetings, and
team members could visit the room to check on the latest changes.
Which came first, the chicken or the egg? Did teams start to entrust their
information to digital formats because they could no longer count on being
physically co-located, or did the rise of digital technology enable teams to
work together effectively even though they could no longer shake hands or
share a cup of coffee? In The World is Flat (Farrar, Straus and Giroux), Thomas
Friedman counts “the digital revolution” among “the ten forces that flattened
the world.” Whichever one got the ball rolling, it’s now in full swing, and we
suspect that you, too, spend some of your time talking to telephones and
computers that connect you with people around the world. And you probably
find yourself getting out of bed too early or staying up too late to meet with
people whose time zones aren’t in sync with yours.
Digital technology connects people with other people and with information
that previously would’ve been unavailable. By using digital collaboration
tools, product development teams can communicate in real time and simulta-
neously, whether they’re on the same site or spread out across the world —
as many teams now are. When project data are digitized on compatible and
readily accessible formats, a product development team can work from any-
where on any aspect of a project. And when company data are digitized,
product teams have access to a huge repository of knowledge — technical,
market, and so on — that their members can access and use.
Digitization of information has radically changed not only how teams manage
product and project information, but also how they work together. In the 
277
Chapter 14: Developing Products in the Digital Age

following sections, we introduce the basics of managing information and man-
aging teams in the digital age — around the clock and around the world. (Take
a look at Chapter 15 for more on how product development is going global.)
Corralling product information
The key to successful management of your new products’ information is the
standardization of processes, methods, and tools that the development team
uses to organize, store, and access information. When product information is
well-organized and stored where it can be accessed, the team is able to coor-
dinate work tasks and to make good, timely decisions.
Take a look at the real limitations of the “pen and paper” ways that compa-
nies used to collect and store information in the past. If you store the infor-
mation your development team needs to make decisions and get its work
done in a three-ring binder, or if it exists only in drawings that hang on the
team room wall, your team will experience trouble, for two reasons:
 Remote team members won’t have access to the data.
 The format will discourage team members from changing the data.
Teams in the digital age use CAD (computer aided design) and CAM (com-
puter assisted manufacturing) to create and store their product information
digitally. In these forms, all team members can see the information, read it,
and — with the right password protections and version controls — change it.
The information inventory you build as your team develops a product should
take its place in your corporation’s knowledge inventory. Like any inventory,
employees can use it, and it can grow in value. Likewise, it can sit there and
do nothing! The more your product information is digitized and shared, how-
ever, the faster your company will move knowledge through “inventory
turns.” Company-wide knowledge can contribute to projects today, tomor-
row, next year, and the year after.
Be sure your company has good controls in place for who has access to the
information, who can change the information, and what information gets sent
to whom. The amount of access and flexibility that the Internet provides can
turn your careful product plans into a hodge-podge.
Collaborating with customers
The projects that have the best success rates start with intimate knowledge of
the customers (see Chapter 4). However, it can be hard to reach your customers
278
Part IV: New Challenges in Product Development 

while your team works on the design and development of a product. You’re
under severe time and budget restraints. (If not, what are your execs think-
ing?) Also, your team likely will develop an internal focus, which includes a
commitment to the solutions developed by the team.
Thankfully, the digital age takes away any excuse you may have for not check-
ing in with your customers in order to test your product during development.
You can simulate your product (see the first section in this chapter), and you
can reach thousands of customers on the Internet. Here are some methods
you can use to collect information from your customers:
 Questionnaires and surveys: Some of our favorites are Kano question-
naires and importance surveys. Teams use these tools to validate the
importance of different requirements. They can be helpful throughout the
development process to answer questions about customer preferences.
 Online Alpha and Beta Tests: Teams use Alpha and Beta Tests to find
out how the product works in customers’ hands (see Chapter 17). If you
can simulate the use of your product online, you discover plenty about
how your product would really behave.
 Online sales forecasting: Use conjoint and other methods (see Chapter 17)
to pinpoint your customers’ likely buying behavior.
Intelligent use of the Internet can provide your team with scads of useful cus-
tomer information. Be sure your team plans carefully for what information
you need and how you plan to use it. You don’t want to have so much infor-
mation that you ignore certain pieces or find yourself changing directions,
missing deadlines, or forgetting what the original project was all about. (See
the later section “Developing products in the standard Internet time zone” for
more on using the Internet.)
Your company’s market research department can be very helpful in setting
up and managing these methods. Note: These methods work best if your team
members are willing to be very frank about their concerns and questions.
Managing project information
The ability to digitize information should encourage your company to create
a virtual space — an Internet or Intranet site, for instance — to store your
project information. This space can house many of the project’s important
pieces, including the following:
 The project mission and vision
 Schedules
279
Chapter 14: Developing Products in the Digital Age

 Action items
 Meeting minutes
 Project metrics
 “Bug” and problem lists
No one on the development team, or elsewhere in the company, has to wonder
what the deliverables are for a certain week or who promised to do what at
the last meeting, for example. The members of the development team can
share the responsibility of updating the information and blowing the whistle
when something isn’t going well.
Developing products in the standard
Internet time zone
More and more products that hit the shelves for customers are being devel-
oped by teams that span the world and include partners from different busi-
nesses. When a product development team isn’t confined to one place,
communication tends to become formal. However, a team needs to “hang
out,” to inspire each other and have space for complaints. To accomplish all
this, new product teams need different modes of communication.
The following sections cover some approaches and some secrets to achiev-
ing success in Internet time.
No matter how good your development team gets at communicating over dis-
tances, don’t under-budget for travel! Teams really do need to meet; man-
agers need to have face time with team members; and at critical times — the
beginning of a project, in particular — you can’t substitute for having the
whole team in the same room. See Chapter 10 for more information on build-
ing and nurturing your NPD team.
Convening formal meetings
Every product development team needs a format in which to conduct a
formal meeting — whether the team members are sitting face to face or are
spread around the globe. Many teams schedule a regular meeting — usually
held weekly — at which they cover an agenda, take notes, make time for dis-
cussion, and so on. A team that’s spread out in different locations should
hold similar meetings.
You may be surprised at how quickly teams can get used to working together
through Internet communications programs such as NetMeeting or WebEx, a
280
Part IV: New Challenges in Product Development 

videocamera (also known as videoconferencing), and/or the phone. In Chapter
10, you can read about the basic rules for formal team meetings. The rules
are the same for distributed teams: make sure participants receive an agenda
before the meeting, take notes at the meeting, and distribute minutes and
action items as soon as possible after the meeting. Note: Many software pack-
ages can facilitate meetings on the Internet. We’ve found that the simplest
ones work the best.
The team leader is responsible for convening these meetings and setting the
tone. However, the team leader often delegates much of the responsibility 
for setting up the meetings, arranging the logistics (such as scheduling the
videoconferencing or arranging telephone conference calls), note-taking
during the meeting, and distributing meeting results afterwards. Often, too,
the team leader designates a facilitator to actually run the meeting so that
everyone else can focus on the substantive issues.
Working on Internet time often means that teams have to work in many differ-
ent time zones. Try to hold meetings in a way that’s “fair” to everyone. Here’s
some tried and true meeting advice:
 We hate to say it, but most Americans assume that their workdays are
what others should conform to. Having that attitude isn’t a good way to
build a team! Spread out the pain of meeting at awkward times. Meet at 
6 a.m. your time one week and at noon your time the next, for example.
 Come up with some basic ground rules to facilitate meetings in which par-
ticipants aren’t face to face. Have your members say their names before
they launch into their diatribes. If someone forgets, the facilitator — or
any member of the team — could say, “It seems awfully dark in here; I’m
not sure who’s speaking.” If people enter or leave the meeting, they
should announce their actions to the group.
A number of software products make it easy to share information via spread-
sheets, diagrams, or slides. These products allow you to show your images,
spreadsheets, and other team data to anyone who has access to the Internet.
During the meeting, different people on the team can “control” a presentation
by using pointers and highlights to direct attention to certain aspects of the
information being presented. Another member can edit the information in
real time as the discussion goes on.
Gathering in informal spaces
Distributed teams should make time for informal communications in addition
to the formal meetings. Team members need to get to know each other and to
understand each other on a personal level. When team members have real
relationships, they can more easily talk together, understand each other’s
positions, and challenge each other’s assumptions. Also, a lot of teamwork
281
Chapter 14: Developing Products in the Digital Age

can’t be done in formal, agenda-driven settings. To be creative, people need
to loosen their ties, sit back, and let their imaginations go.
The following list presents some avenues and advice for informal 
communications:
 Your team members can convene in live chat rooms on the Internet.
These tools can help team members mull over issues that they can’t
settle in a formal meeting.
 Team members can brainstorm ideas online and over the phone.
 Team members can post personal information, such as photos and birth-
days, on team-only Web sites. This helps people who don’t get the
chance to hang out face-to-face to form personal bonds.
Rockin’ around the clock
Can you imagine how fast your team could develop your company’s new
product if the sun never set on the work that you have to do? Believe it or
not, some new product teams have discovered that they can actually make
this happen. The following hypothetical narrative presents an example of
how it can go:
 A portion of a product development team based in New Jersey starts
work at 8 a.m., eastern standard time. The afternoon before, they had
uploaded their work to the Intranet site and called a meeting with their
teammates in Palo Alto, California, to get them up to speed. The New
Jersey team’s first move when they arrive to work is to tap into the
Intranet site where the entire team stores its project information to see
what team members in other locations have accomplished since yester-
day. Here’s what the New Jersey members find:
• The Palo Alto team worked on the project, and at the end of their
day, the team members uploaded their work to the site. Before
leaving work, they called a meeting with their teammates in
Taiwan, who then worked their whole day on the project.
• The Taiwanese team members ended their day by uploading their
work to the Intranet site and holding a conference with their team-
mates in Paris to get them up to speed.
 At 8 a.m. New Jersey time, the team members in Paris have uploaded
their work to the site and are ready for a conference call with New
Jersey to review a few issues they couldn’t resolve.
 In 24 hours — from 8 a.m. the previous day to 8 a.m. this day — the
entire team has accomplished roughly a week’s worth of normal work.
Furthermore, the teams haven’t had to work overtime. No room for
heroes, and no need to miss your kid’s little league game.
282

Sound too good to be true? Usually it is. If you want to experience the bene-
fits of “round the world, round the clock” work, be prepared to be extremely
organized. You must start with extraordinarily clear product definitions. You
have to put processes in place for managing anomalies. And you have to
make leadership and decision making very clear. To succeed at this, you have
to follow just about every bit of advice we give you in this whole book.
You may have to be super-human to make the process work the way it does
in our example, but that’s no reason to avoid using worldwide resources to
increase your project’s efficiency. As you use these resources, you discover
what it takes to accomplish more and more of the project on Internet time.
Working in Internet time is very hard on mere mortals. Be sure your leader-
ship judges the productivity of your teams, not of your individuals, to keep
from burning out your employees.
Booting Up IT to Organize Your
Corporation’s Innovations
The opportunities that digital technology provides are huge, and so are the
pitfalls. Today’s digital information technology opens up the possibility that
professionals everywhere can communicate with each other, using common
language and common platforms.
Some of the information in this section applies to teams, not to whole corpo-
rations. However, if your organization doesn’t make decisions at the corpo-
rate level about what platforms and tools to use, you miss out on an
opportunity to make your systems coherent. In fact, with a piecemeal
approach, your company is building in incoherence. Be sure that your com-
pany makes decisions from the top down (with plenty of bottom-up input).
From common to fully integrated:
Exploring the best digital technology
Information technologies that can help your organization manage its new
product processes and initiatives range from widely available software pack-
ages to platforms that promise to automate and integrate just about every-
thing within your company. The following list presents some technology
283
Chapter 14: Developing Products in the Digital Age

options that your company can explore, in order of increasing integration,
sophistication, and complexity:
 Common software packages: Everyone should be using the same soft-
ware to create documents, give presentations, assemble spreadsheets,
create financial analysis, and so on. You shouldn’t put up with the argu-
ments of an accountant who has to have her special spreadsheet or an
engineer who can’t use Microsoft Excel.
 Project management software: Using a common platform for project
management helps development teams succeed, and it helps a firm build
project management competency over time. Project management soft-
ware packages are widely available; your organization should get one
that allows for Web-based use, even if you don’t rely on the Internet at
the beginning of the project (see the section “Developing products in the
standard Internet time zone” for more on Internet-based development).
 A common phase/review product development process integrated
with project management software: Your organization shouldn’t try to
integrate its product development process with its project management
software until your teams and managers have a good understanding of
both. See Chapter 9 to read about the phase/review process.
 Communication tools for distributed teams: Teams whose members are
spread around the globe can make good use of phone systems, video-
conferencing, and Web-conferencing tools. Make sure your teams have
good project and development management processes (common to all
of them) before you launch into having them work remotely!
 Design/development tools, such as CAD and CAM: Common com-
puter-aided design and manufacturing tools are helpful to teams that
manage their projects well but of limited use to teams that aren’t good 
at collaboration.
 Intranet sites: After a development team makes its project data digital, it
can store the data in a secure, accessible Intranet site.
 Portfolio management software: After an organization’s management
team gets a good grip on the resource needs and timing of projects in 
its pipeline, it can start to automate the company’s portfolio decision
making. Many IT tools help to sort projects into strategic buckets, aggre-
gate portfolio worth, and so on. See Chapter 11 for more on managing
the product portfolio.
 Resource management software: Software that aggregates a develop-
ment team’s available and in-use resources can be helpful when the
whole product development process has matured. If you think your com-
pany’s process is grownup enough, be sure you get a package that’s
284
Part IV: New Challenges in Product Development 

sophisticated enough to identify special versus common resources and
flexible enough to illustrate how your resource needs change over time.
For more on resource management, check out Chapter 11.
 Corporate repositories or libraries: When your organization has imple-
mented data gathering and the use of information at the project level
and across projects at the portfolio level, you should start creating a
flexible, integrated repository that allows project teams to learn from
each other and enables executives and managers to oversee and review
progress in real time.
Implementing the technology tools
Selecting and implementing technology tools must be done top-down and
company-wide. The benefits come from standardization. The most important
lesson we can give you about implementing technology tools is to match the
degree of maturity of your product development processes to the tools you
install. The list we provide in the previous section appears, roughly, in order
of maturity. Your company can’t go for the glitz until you have a firm process
base. For example, there’s little point in installing software for project resource
management if your phase/review process doesn’t allow you to predict
resource needs in the product development pipeline.
285
Chapter 14: Developing Products in the Digital Age
Choosing a vendor
Many firms can sell your company software to
automate your product development processes.
However, caveat emptor! Be sure you know
what you’re getting into before making tool and
vendor decisions. Here are a few simple rules:
 Try to find an automated system that’s simi-
lar to the processes you’re currently using.
 If you have homegrown processes, do some
research and find tools that support the
processes you have.
 If you have no or poorly implemented
processes and if your culture is hierarchical,
or top-down, look for a package that comes
with process design and implementation.
 If you have no or poorly implemented
processes and if your culture is bottom-up,
you should first get serious about improving
how you develop new products. Realize that
it may take more discipline than you usually
have. Second, you should establish a work-
ing group that can develop processes and
select the appropriate IT to support them.

Your development team should think through the whole sequence of tool
implementation before making choices at the beginning. What kind of resource
management process do you want? The answer should impact your choice of
project management tools. What data do you want to have available in your
corporate repository? The answer may affect all the choices you make.
Our next most important piece of advice comes as your team begins to imple-
ment the use of digital tools: Be patient! Get each tool fully working before
going on to the next. You’ll be tempted to rush ahead and build a corporate
library that supports full automation of your product development. Only it
won’t support it. Everyone involved will get frustrated, and your projects will
be less efficient.
We recommend that your development team find someone with broad tool-
implementation expertise who can help you think through the implications 
of your choices. The person for this job will probably be a consultant. Make
sure that the consultant you work with isn’t 100 percent committed to con-
vincing you to buy her technology. Always ask questions before you seal 
the deal.

W
e’d lay dollars to doughnuts that you outsource some aspects of your
company’s new product development to other countries. Maybe you
buy widgets from China, or a company in Mexico makes your springs. Perhaps
you test your new products in other countries before you send them to
market. In our highly interlinked world, more and more companies are turn-
ing to suppliers to streamline the product development process. Many of
these suppliers are located in other countries, and many of them don’t just
provide widgets — they’re becoming partners in the product development
process, which turns up the heat on opportunity (and increases the risk).
In this chapter, we introduce you to what leading companies are doing in the
global marketplace — including what challenges them and how they meet
those challenges. You discover the distinction between “outsourcing” and
“offshoring,” and you find out why the distinction makes a difference.
Companies that approach globalization in a purely opportunistic manner
often run into trouble, so we give you some tips to consider as you create
your strategy for globalization. Finally, we review some of the basics of col-
laboration, because collaboration is a key to success in the global economy.
We don’t just look at plain vanilla “outsourcing” in this chapter, in which com-
panies use suppliers to gain access to the standard materials they need to
run their businesses. Instead, we look at the much higher stakes game of glob-
ally distributed product development (GDPD). When you develop products
with others, you expand your capacities, and you put some control into other
companies’ hands. Companies that succeed at the GDPD game have clear
new product strategies (Chapter 3), understand their customers (Chapter 4),
know where their technology is headed (Chapter 7), and focus their resources
(Chapter 11). They also understand the impact of the digital age (Chapter 14)
and how to partner with others (Chapter 16).

Mapping the Landscape in the 
Global Development Game
Where in the world might you find partners to join with you in the game of
globally distributed product development (GDPD)? Literally anywhere. If you
haven’t heard yet, let us be the first to tell you: The world is flat. In his book
by that title, Thomas Friedman speculates that one of the leading flatteners
of the world is the rise of digital technology. In the digital age that has defined
the early 21st century, we can communicate with almost anyone anywhere in
seconds. So if the world is flat and distance isn’t a factor, what does the global
product development landscape look like? How can you draw a map and find
your way in this new world? Read the following sections to find out.
Understanding your company’s 
place in GDPD
Where and how your company plays in the global game of product develop-
ment depends in part on where you are now on the game board. Over the
course of the digital age, the global distribution of product development has
followed three stages:
Stage 1: Companies identify strongly with their home bases. The drivers
of globalization are a combination of low-cost suppliers and emerging
markets. The game is opportunistic, not strategic. Companies in this
stage may outsource some of their product development because coun-
tries where they sell products mandate that they spend some percent of
their sales on local research and development. Or, companies may look
for engineers or scientists in other countries because they can’t find the
talent in their locations.
Companies that enter the GDPD game in Stage 1 sometimes end up devel-
oping products all over the world without any clear strategy. As GDPD is
becoming more accessible, common, and strategic, some of these compa-
nies are playing catch-up with companies that enter at Stage 2 or 3.
Stage 2: The strategic nature of the opportunity becomes more appar-
ent. Companies see more that’s attractive in the GDPD game. Former 
low-cost suppliers — in Taiwan, India, and China, for example — gain
technology competence. Risks and advantages are becoming clearer.
In this stage, product and technology strategy direct a company’s
choices. The company may begin to build specific capabilities that will
help it to succeed with partners in GDPD (see Chapter 16 for more).
288
Part IV: New Challenges in Product Development 

Stage 3: Companies are founded as global companies. Companies seek
and find suppliers, markets, and technology partners all over the world.
A company’s “backyard” is everywhere. Lines of communication and cul-
tural differences are integrated as matters of course.
Some authors call these companies “meta-national.” Often, the home
base is a country that can’t provide adequate markets. Nokia, for exam-
ple, is a Finnish company. It started out with the goal to become a signifi-
cant player in the cellphone market by identifying not with Finland, but
with the world.
We imagine that you can identify which stage best describes your company.
Did you get into the game early? In that case, there’s a good chance that your
scene is Stage 1. Did your company start global, in Stage 3? The following list
presents some detail about the different stages. We include the most important
jobs for your company to focus on in order to optimize its global position:
 If Stage 1 describes your company’s GDPD position, you may have woken
up one morning to find yourself doing business all over the world. You
may be developing products in Alaska to sell in Honduras and in China
to sell anywhere you can find a market. Your job is to get a handle on
your global assets and use them strategically.
Stage 1 companies often have very strong identifications with their
home base. That identification may be historic (“We were born here, and
we grew up here”). Sometimes, it includes brand identity. For example,
although Ford has widely distributed development centers and markets
all over the world, make no mistake: It’s a U.S. company.
 If Stage 2 describes your company’s GDPD position, you may be
researching how to get more out of your existing business partnerships
and looking around to find new opportunities. You may have legacy pro-
jects that focus solely on low-cost or new markets, but you — and your
company’s leadership — are getting more and more strategic in your
approach. Your job is to create a robust strategic plan for GDPD.
 If you started life as a Stage 3 company, please come on over and help us
write the next version of this section! These companies are the lucky
ones — except that they have to launch their businesses in a world of
high uncertainty and high risk. The most critical job of the Stage 3 com-
pany is to take advantage of the wide world of opportunity and to lead
the way by implementing new and successful practices.
As you read the rest of this chapter, keep in mind that how your company has
evolved in the globally distributed product development story influences
what will be important to you and what your next steps will be.

The sections that follow discuss these relationships in detail. For more infor-
mation on partnerships, check out Chapter 16.
Outsourcing product development tasks to a vendor
The lowest level of GDPD is when you outsource product development tasks.
In other words, suppliers and vendors that you don’t own do some routine
work for you — updating drawings, for example. In this chapter, we concen-
trate on global outsourcing, but “outsourcing” also can apply if your supplier
does business in the next town just down the road.
Although you don’t give away any trade secrets or intellectual property to
your vendors, you still have to be careful when you collaborate with suppli-
ers that do business in different countries, with different customs and laws.
See the section “Protecting your company’s core assets and capabilities” for
more information on how to protect your knowledge assets when you work
with outsiders.
If you outsource even the most routine parts of NPD, expect to spend time
and resources on training. No matter how explicit and clear you think your
processes are, even the best partners need to learn exactly how you go about
designing, building, and testing if you expect their work to fit seamlessly with
yours. Successful companies combine bringing partners in to learn the ropes
and sending managers offshore to teach them.
290
Part IV: New Challenges in Product Development 

Building a relationship with a preferred vendor
The next step in GDPD is when you start trusting your suppliers with more
complicated and important work. If you’ve been outsourcing the testing 
of circuits, for instance, you may move on to outsourcing circuit design.
Companies often take this step because they find out that suppliers they’re
already working with have the skills and experience needed to take on more
sophisticated work. This often is work that their product developers are
struggling to keep up with on their own.
When you take this step, you probably already have a degree of comfort with
your supplier. Taking the next step with a supplier you already know and
trust takes some of the anxiety, and risk, out of the picture. Also, it means
that your supplier has made some strides toward learning the ropes of your
business and industry — the way you define them.
When your company begins to give a preferred vendor more responsibility,
you have to be even more careful about what work you outsource because
the work is getting closer to the core of expertise that creates your com-
pany’s competitive advantage in new product development. You can give
engineers in Beijing drawings to update without giving them enough context
to understand the product innovation they’re working with, for example. But
when you ask these engineers to design a braking system, you’re inviting
them into your inner world, where the secrets that make your golf cart better
than anyone else’s reside. Check out the section “Recognizing (And Avoiding)
the Risks of Globalization” for more on protecting your company’s core
knowledge and intellectual property.
Insourcing
When a company insources its product development, it owns product devel-
opment capabilities away from its central location. For example, Kodak’s
home base is in Rochester, New York, and its digital camera facility is in
Taiwan. Kodak owns the Taiwanese facilities, and the employees there are
Kodak employees. That facility is an example of what companies often call a
“captive site,” or offshore insourcing.
The difference between outsourcing and insourcing is critical. When you out-
source, you create a situation in which someone else will carry out some of
your product development. You need to be sure that your vendor is depend-
able and that what you outsource isn’t a critical competency for your organi-
zation. When you insource, you find new places, new competencies, and new
capacities for developing products; however, you buy them (acquire them) or
build them yourself. In other words, you own them. The “vendors” are part of
your company.
Although insourcing limits the risk you take — you can’t “lose” assets to
another part of your own company — you create even greater issues of 
291
Chapter 15: Product Development Goes Global

culture, communication, and integration than when you outsource. See the
later section “Recognizing (And Avoiding) the Risks of Globalization” for
more on how to work through the risks.
Surveying the Benefits of Globalization
and Defining Your Strategy
In order to be competitive, most companies need to access global capabili-
ties and global markets. “To be all you can be,” you almost certainly need to
tread the path of globalization.
In this section, we look at the basics of what globalization offers your organi-
zation — in other words, why globalization may have strategic importance
for your company. When you decide that a globalization strategy is important
for your company to accomplish its goals, you’re ready to read further. You
also discover how many companies decide where to locate their facilities and
where they can find suppliers and partners.
Going global to add capacity
Perhaps the most common reason companies “go global” with product devel-
opment is to expand their capacity — in other words, to add skills, knowledge,
expertise, and infrastructure that can help them develop more and better
products. The following list presents some of the resources your company
may want more of and that you may be looking around the world to find; what
your organization is looking for should shape your globalization strategy:
 Finding more skilled hands to do the routine work. Your skilled prod-
uct developers — engineers, designers, market researchers, and so on —
spend much of their valuable time completing tasks that don’t require a
high level of skill or integration. Many companies outsource tasks like
updating drawings or collating questionnaire results to reduce the
burden shouldered by their skilled workforce.
 Finding resources that can extend and complement your product
development work. Many employees possess skills that your company
needs over and over in the NPD process. Pharmaceutical companies
need research scientists, electronics companies need electrical engi-
neers, and so on. If you need more skilled people to keep your new prod-
uct pipeline flowing, you may want to outsource work to a competent
supplier or establish a center of your own in another country to
insource the work.
292
Part IV: New Challenges in Product Development 

 Increasing your access to special competencies. Many times, your
product development projects can be held up because a particular skill
is missing in your company. Or perhaps you have too much demand on
the limited capacity you possess. This could be true, for example, of spe-
cial software design skills or of various kinds of product testing. An out-
side supplier may be able to help you cope with the bottlenecks.
If the problem is acute, and you’ll need the resource for a long time, you
may want to acquire or establish the competency by using the insourc-
ing model — if adding competency at home isn’t an option (see the ear-
lier section “Insourcing”).
 Acquiring special skills that out- or insource vendors may do better
than you. Some of the talent and skills you need may be more abundant
elsewhere in the world. If so, you should consider establishing relation-
ships that make those skills and talents available. For example, Kodak’s
digital facility, located in Taiwan, has access to the skills of the “Silicone
Valley of the East,” skills that tend to be in comparatively short supply in
Kodak’s home base in Rochester, New York.
Saving product development costs
Saving on product development costs is the first reason why many compa-
nies outsource or offshore their NPD efforts. In the pursuit of bottom-line 
efficiency — of “doing more with less” — many firms outsource and offshore
parts of their product development activities.
The first “bottom line” is that the labor rates are far lower in many parts of the
world outside of developed countries. For example, one company increased
its capacity, measured by its number of full-time employees, by almost 20
percent by outsourcing a portion of its NPD work. At the same time, the orga-
nization lowered its spending on labor by 10 percent and its spending per
year per employee by nearly 25 percent.
Wow! But we called this “the first bottom line.” Don’t be fooled by the appear-
ance of savings. In the previous example, when this company figured in its
other costs associated with GDPD, the savings were much lower. Successful
outsourcing and offshoring require plenty of support. When you do the math,
be sure you add in the unexpected costs, like training, travel, and so on.
Also, you must recognize that the more the developed country exports its
work, the more the developing country develops. In this cycle, the develop-
ing world’s labor supply becomes more skilled — and more expensive. At the
same time, its populations become more and more attractive markets.
293
Chapter 15: Product Development Goes Global

Making global products
In order to make products that appeal to customers in different parts of the
world, many companies are finding that they need to develop a deep under-
standing of consumers in different parts of the world. When a company locates
design and manufacturing facilities — and its designers, developers, marketers,
and so on — near potential customers, it can be much more successful in
understanding and meeting customer needs in a wide variety of markets.
In general, European companies tend to be more aware of these market differ-
ences than companies in the United States. Nestlé, for example, alters its
foods and its brands to suit local populations. The “same” product, such as
chicken bouillon cubes, looks and tastes very different depending on whether
it’s being offered in China, Nigeria, or Poland. Nestlé bases its ability to meet
customer needs and expectations in all these locations on a comprehensive
methodology of customer understanding backed by a worldwide local train-
ing program. (Take a look at Chapter 4 for more on understanding customers.)
Such an “act local” approach runs the risk of creating a fragmented set of
product offerings that can be very difficult to manage. Nestlé integrates tech-
nology and market strategies to achieve as much consistency as possible. Its
byword is: “Optimize on similarities; respect local differences.” Take a look at
Chapter 3 for information on developing product platforms that can meet dif-
fering customer needs.
Deciding where to go when you go global
Most companies begin to globalize their product development activities in
order to exploit low-cost suppliers or global markets. They stick with global-
ization to reap the benefits of additional skills and capacities. Many of your
GDPD activities may emerge from early attempts to outsource lower-skilled
tasks. Intel, for example, developed a site in Israel around 30 years ago
because of low labor cost and tax incentives. The Israel site has evolved from
a low-cost design center to a robust corporate business group.
When deciding where to take your development efforts, scan the world to
find different strengths that could attract you to outsource work or locate
centers for GDPD. Consider the strengths of the following locations:
 In Taiwan and Japan, you can find high-tech and electronics capabilities.
 In China, you can find vendors/partners that can link into your manufac-
turing efforts and work well with offshore facilities in Taiwan and Korea.
 India excels in design services and information technology.
294
Part IV: New Challenges in Product Development 

 Russia and Eastern Europe are big into industrial projects, including
aerospace, automotive, and defense.
 Canada has most of the talent you can find in the United States for lower —
although not low — cost.
Of course, you can find pockets of just about whatever your organization
needs in many locations these days, if you devote the time and have the
patience to seek them out. By combining your company’s existing relation-
ships and a careful review of the different capabilities around the world, you
can select the places that will meet your needs.
Making decisions about where to locate is where the hard work begins. You
need executive involvement, very careful project planning, and plenty of
patience to make GDPD pay off. Your company needs to make globalization
decisions strategically. Companies get themselves into trouble when they
make opportunistic, short-sighted, merely tactical decisions about globaliza-
tion. And you need to be aware of the risk from the start (see the later sec-
tion “Recognizing (And Avoiding) the Risks of Globalization”). Consider the
following examples:
 Depending on outsourcing to fill an immediate need can weaken a com-
pany’s resolve to build the capacity in-house.
 Outsourcing keeps a company dependent on outside partners.
 Insourcing saddles a company with the large responsibility to create and
maintain that asset.
From the start, be committed to bringing your globalization decisions to
senior management. Make sure that you include the issues in the strategic
decision-making process.
Recognizing (And Avoiding) 
the Risks of Globalization
Every new product project and every new product strategy brings some risk
to the table. In Chapter 11, which deals with managing your company’s NPD
resources, we recommend that you take on a reasonable amount of risk; oth-
erwise, your new products will turn into commodities, mere ho-hum’s, and
me-too’s that customers won’t get excited about or pay for. Along with the
opportunity to differentiate your products, globally distributed product
development brings risk, and much of it is new risk that you may not have
any tried-and-true methods of assessing and managing.
295
Chapter 15: Product Development Goes Global

If your organization goes the globalization route, you need to be aware of at
least three major risks: losing your core capabilities, giving away your intel-
lectual property (IP), and political conflicts. In this section, you discover how
to recognize these risks and avoid, or at least mitigate, them.
Protecting your company’s core assets 
and capabilities
Your organization’s core assets and capabilities are your life force. What dis-
tinguishes you as a company? What do customers look to you for? What do
you possess that allows you to continue your success into the next year? The
next decade? GDPD puts your core assets at risk because you outsource work
that you used to do yourself. How far is too far in the GDPD game? We can’t
give you a simple answer to this question. It’s a strategic issue, and you need
to ask some tough questions:
 What do you want to preserve?
 How much can you outsource before you become nothing more than a
“system integrator” of other people’s work?
 Is your distinctive competency exactly that of a system integrator?
You need to be sure that you make strategic assessments of what you can
have others do and what you have to keep to yourself before you’ve gone too
far. Some companies — Bose and Corning, for example — identify strongly
with their technology competence. Others’ identities are tied up in products
and/or brands. A company like Caterpillar can outsource a fair amount of
development work as long as the end result is a huge, yellow earth-moving
machine. Some companies are frankly integrators; Dell has made a great busi-
ness following this model. Our advice to you is that you choose the direction
that GDPD opens up for you instead of waking up five or ten years from now
and finding that your core identity has changed. (In Chapter 8, you find out
how to identify your core technologies. Mapping product lines, which we dis-
cuss in Chapter 3, also helps you spot your most important assets.)
Guarding your intellectual property
The United States and many other developed nations have very clear rules
about intellectual property (IP). Intellectual property is knowledge that pro-
vides competitive advantage to its owner. It includes such assets as technol-
ogy competence and designs. If you know how to do something or make
something that others can’t do and it’s clear that you own the rights to the
296
Part IV: New Challenges in Product Development 

process or the design, that becomes your intellectual property. The United
States and other parts of the “developed world” have rules in place to protect
IP because the countries have so much of it, and it behooves everyone to
play by the rules that protect them while also protecting others.
We’re not saying that developed countries have ironclad IP protection; think
of the impact Napster and other Web-based technologies that enabled con-
sumers to download music for free had on the music industry. What we’re
saying is that when you do business in countries where IP isn’t well protected,
you have to take special care. IP protection is improving in developing coun-
tries, including China. But you shouldn’t count on IP protection in other
countries. Many countries don’t have laws in place, they don’t have the legal
infrastructure to enforce the laws they have, and often they don’t have a cul-
ture that condemns taking other people’s IP.
We recommend that you prioritize your intellectual property into three 
categories:
 Very important to you. Protecting this first category is a critical issue.
As much as possible, you should simply keep this IP at home. If you
must offshore work with this IP, make sure that you offshore it to a
trusted partner (see Chapter 16) and install strong protection proce-
dures and processes.
 Important, but not critical. In the second group, be sure that you assess
the risks and put in place reasonable protections, such as making sure
that you share only parts of projects that your outsource partner cannot
copy. The downside is that you may have no ironclad laws and proce-
dures to protect your IP, and going after offenders may be both expen-
sive and ineffective.
 Not all that important. This IP does belong to you, and “stealing” it isn’t
nice or right, but it isn’t too important. Because protecting IP in many
countries is uncertain, difficult, and expensive, many companies identify
IP that isn’t critical and simply take their chances with it.
Here’s a great strategy to follow when you must offshore important IP:
1. Deconstruct the project into separate pieces.
2. Identify parts of the project that separate groups can develop and that
don’t make much sense individually.
3. Give each group a stand-alone piece.
With this strategy, even if your offshore partners try to cheat, you’ve given
them something that won’t lead anywhere.
297
Chapter 15: Product Development Goes Global

Navigating political landscapes
The politics of globally distributed product development include the following:
 The political environments of the countries you do business with
 The political relationships between your home country and your out-
source countries
 The political/regulatory landscape you work in
 The internal politics of outsourcing work and working across boundaries
You want to avoid doing business in a country that has an unstable and/or
unfriendly political environment. That may be easier said than done, though.
As of press time, major oil companies are doing business where the political
environment can range from unstable to downright hostile.
When doing business in another country — by outsourcing or partnering
with vendors — don’t assume that your relationships with its government
and local corporations are all that you need. You need to spend time getting
to know other parts of the country, including its students, workers, and ordi-
nary people. Setting up an offshore center for GDPD that has a local flavor
can make all the difference.
Also, within the previous list, you need to take a close look at the following
when you outsource work to other countries:
 The regulatory issues: The countries in which you do business often are
very different from the one(s) you’re used to. Europe’s environmental
protection regulations are far more strict (so far) than those in the United
States, for example (good for them!). Japan requires researchers to test all
medicines on Japanese subjects in order to gain approval for use in Japan.
 The general political implications of outsourcing in the first place: Your
stateside employees may feel that your organization doesn’t value their
work, and they may fear that their jobs are at risk. Beyond that is the
brand issue. If you have a brand that’s tightly associated with your home
country — Harley Davidson is a good example in the United States — you
may run the risk of weakening your brand image if you depend on offshore
labor (see Chapter 3 for more on brand considerations).
Beefing Up Your Social Skills 
in the Global Economy
Good communication is a foundation stone of GDPD success, and good com-
munication includes a number of important factors. We consider the following
298
Part IV: New Challenges in Product Development 

to be critical ingredients of good communication and success in the global
arena:
 The sharing of practices
 Patience
 Respect for diversity
 A commitment to partnership
In the sections that follow, we focus your attention on some basic rules of
communicating when you can’t depend on sitting down with your team over
a cup of coffee to work through knotty problems. We emphasize the need for
sharing practices in the last section, but remember that everything we say in
the concluding pages of this chapter assumes, even when we don’t say it out
loud, that you’re including patience, respect for diversity, and a commitment
to the partnership.
What time is it there? What language 
are we speaking?
Even though distance disappears in the age of digitization and globalization,
languages and time zones don’t. Too bad. Global collaboration puts a huge
strain on us mere mortals. Working in different time zones means that you
always have to be working in multiple circadian rhythms. In the process, your
own rhythm may get totally messed up.
Working with colleagues who speak different languages is fairly straightfor-
ward for English speakers, which is a good thing for those of us who live in
the United States. Most of us are utterly incompetent in any language but our
own — and some of us in that one as well.
As your organization globalizes its product development work, you must
account for the fact that employees who usually work from 9 to 5, 8 to 5, or
even 6 to 6 will have longer days because of communication to other conti-
nents. Most of China and most of the United States are roughly 12 hours
apart, for example; just about no time falls within the normal workdays of all
the members of a team that’s distributed between those two countries.
In this section, we talk about how to facilitate communication on distributed
teams. You may be wondering: Isn’t this just a matter of sending some work
overseas to get it out of our hair? No. You need to form relationships with your
outsource and insource partners that allow you to become a cross-functional
team. (Take a look at Chapter 10 for more on cross-functional teams.) This is
a project, with goals and objectives, a time frame, and a budget. If you just
send off information and wait for the results to return, your partnerships are
likely to fail.
299
Chapter 15: Product Development Goes Global

Following are a few rules you can put in place to make sure that your distrib-
uted new product team, as well as the parts of your company that support it,
can communicate effectively:
 Meet regularly. Get members of the team used to a regular meeting —
every Monday or the second Tuesday of the month, for example. You
can vary the times, if necessary, to spread the pain of having to meet
outside of normal work hours.
 Use a consistent format. Keep the agenda simple, and keep the agenda
format the same. For example, you might include time for the team to
greet each other, followed by the status of the project. The team can
then work on any problems that have surfaced, as well as any new
opportunities. It’s a good idea to include a time for new business and to
encourage team members to bring up issues that don’t fit the rest of the
agenda in that slot.
Be sure to include time for team members to share about what’s going
on with them during each meeting. A simple and brief “check-in” to start
each meeting can encourage team members to inform each other of
births and birthdays as well as insights and learning that might forward
the team’s work.
 Create a central location for product documentation. A password-
protected Internet/Intranet site can provide a repository for the team’s
work (see Chapter 14).
 Implement a process for version control. Make sure that your team
doesn’t end up in document chaos! This can be as simple as enforcing a
format that team members use when they access or change a document.
If you have software that allows several members of the team to access
documents simultaneously, make sure that software includes version
control features.
 Use the advantages of a “work-around-the-clock” system. One team can
post its work at the end of the day so a partner whose day is just start-
ing can review it and carry on. Be careful not to go overboard with this;
too much 24/7 work can take a huge toll on a team. Take a look at
Chapter 14 for an example of ‘round-the-clock work.
 Familiarize your teams with all the new collaboration tools (see Chap-
ter 14). Phone conference lines, Web meeting tools (like WebEx and
NetMeeting), and videoconferencing allow teams to share information
and help to build a sense of team and teamwork.
In Chapter 10, you find out how to make cross-functional teams work. In
Chapter 14, you can read up on how digital technologies support the work of
distributed teams. Most of what we say there can be applied in spades to
teams that work in different locations in our global economy.
300
Part IV: New Challenges in Product Development 

Sometimes, the best practices and procedures for making distributed teams
work just aren’t enough. During these times it can help if you meet face to
face. As a general rule, groups should meet face to face toward the beginning
of projects and at critical junctures (for example, when the team’s work has
to be integrated). In addition, an outsourcing team may need to spend time at
your home-base facility to get a better sense of how you “do it around here,”
and managers and team members should plan to spend time with outsource/
insource teams — giving oversight, holding training sessions, and keeping
the team’s work on track.
Aligning your processes and practices
New product developers are using plenty of well-honed processes and prac-
tices to roll out great products that meet customer requirements. Even prod-
uct developers who work in the same location must align their processes.
This task becomes even more critical when an organization collaborates
across cultures and languages, companies, and continents to produce new
products.
Companies that succeed at aligning their processes and practices at home
generally have the best success at aligning the work of teams globally. They
also have the ability to create an aligned strategy for new product develop-
ment. You can learn more about most of these important processes and prac-
tices elsewhere in this book. The following list reviews them in the context of
promoting GDPD success:
 Understanding customer needs: The best way to put a team on the
same page is to visit customers together to find out what they really
want/need. Use the information we present in Chapter 4 to organize a
cross-functional, cross-cultural, and international team to carry out a
program of customer visits.
 Linking customer needs to product requirements: When your teams
understand what customers all over the world want, and when they can
tie those needs to what the product should do, they can travel a relatively
straight and narrow path to the end result. (See Chapter 4 for techniques
that make these linkages work.)
 Mapping technologies, product portfolios, and product lines: When
your teams understand the role their work plays in the company’s over-
all product strategy, they can make good decisions about trade-offs 
and can hoist a red flag if their work doesn’t seem to be in sync. (See
Chapter 3 for more on mapping the key aspects of a company’s new
product strategy.)
301
Chapter 15: Product Development Goes Global

 Using digital formats for design and drawing: Make sure you have a
standard and well-accepted format for rendering your designs. You don’t
want to have to translate any drawings into different formats. (See
Chapter 14 for the impact of digital technologies on NPD.)
 Implementing standard project management practices: Every member
of every team should have some training in, and a great deal of respect
for, standard project management (PM) practices. Some teams use pro-
ject management software, some don’t; what makes the real difference
isn’t the software but the practices themselves. (Take a look at Project
Management For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Sydney E. Portny [Wiley] for
more information.)
 Implementing a robust phase/review process: Using a phase/review
process streamlines the new product development process. A phase/
review process keeps the workflow aligned, forces the teams to pay
attention to the business cases for projects, and connects the work of
the teams to executive oversight and judgment. (See Chapters 9 and 12
for more advice on conducting the phase/review process.)
If you use these practices and processes for your product development pro-
jects, you’ll find it much easier to keep your GDPD projects on track. Most of
the time, your organization’s GDPD projects constitute only a portion of a
whole NPD project; your GDPD partners may not need to know all about how
your project fits within the related technology, the portfolio, and the product
line maps. But you’ll be able to connect your in-house work with the work
that you in- or outsource, manage that work, and provide consistent formats
for your partners and suppliers to work with.

Choose Your Partner! Partners in
Product Development
In This Chapter
 Discovering what partnering can do for you
 Choosing the proper partner
 Defining your business relationship
 Making the most of open innovation
 Partnering up or keeping your assets to yourself
 Managing the partnership
M
any companies of different sizes and in different industries take advan-
tage of partnering to boost their ability to bring new products to
market. When a company partners in product development, it relies on
another company to accomplish some of the tasks associated with develop-
ing a product.
The partnering trend has accelerated in recent years, in large part due to our
shrinking planet. Finding resources all over the world is getting easier (see
Chapter 15). Companies often start by working together on more routine
tasks, but then they begin to notice opportunities to partner on ever more
complex ones, such as product development. Today, virtually all pharmaceu-
tical companies use partners to extend their research and development
capacities, and firms that do business in many other industries are discover-
ing how to grow their capabilities and profits.
Of course, with the advantages of partnering come risks — of losing intellec-
tual property, of not developing needed assets in-house, and so on. Your
organization must ask a critically important question: What business should
we do with partners, and what should we keep inside?
In this chapter, you discover the advantages and the risks of partnering. You
look at how to choose the right partner for your business situation, and you
find out what kinds of alliances make the most business sense. You’ll also see

how a leading pharmaceutical company executes another tricky part of 
partnering — actually managing its partnerships.
We’d like to thank Eli Lilly, and Lilly representatives David Vondle, Global Brand
Development Leader, and Mike Ransom, Alliance Manager, for their contribu-
tion to this chapter.
Understanding the “Open 
Innovation Paradigm”
The new buzz on the NPD campus is open innovation — finding and exploit-
ing other companies’ inventions to create your own marketable innovations. It
seems obvious that it took a consortium of partners to develop and market
just about anything of value that’s in the market today — the products and
services that are the core of our global economy. Nonetheless, the dominant
paradigm in innovation and new product development has been what author
Henry Chesbrough calls “closed innovation.” Corporations have operated
within a world view often characterized as “not invented here,” or NIH.
Roughly, this translates to “if we didn’t invent it, we don’t want it.”
But why limit your resources to what you can do in-house when a whole
world of innovation awaits you?
As Chesbrough convincingly argues in his book, Open Innovation (Harvard
Business School Press), companies need to give the NIH paradigm the boot.
Successful companies in a number of industries have already done so. The
open innovation paradigm invites all companies to declare open season on
advances in technologies and products, no matter who came up with them or
who owns them. The paradigm also invites businesspeople to respect their
own and others’ intellectual property and to learn how to be good partners.
The go-it-alone approach is fading for a number of reasons:
 Many traditionally research-focused companies have severely reduced
their R&D budgets.
 Pressures for short-term results — from investors on the outside and
executives on the inside — have dampened spending on internal tech-
nology initiatives that could create new and breakthrough products.
 Our world’s “technology metabolism” is speeding up. If the metabolism
of technology is getting faster and faster, your company’s great ideas,
your inventions, and your new technologies are becoming old hat at a
faster and faster rate. What used to seem like a good plan — inventing
stuff and then putting the products on the shelf for later — is becoming
less and less prudent.
304
Part IV: New Challenges in Product Development 

Convinced? Read on so we can tell you how to navigate the rough seas out-
side your company.
And if you’re an inventor, you should read on, too. The open innovation para-
digm has pushed companies large and small to look to the little guys — the
inventor who works in his garage, the small start-up company with the intrigu-
ing technology and limited resources, and so on. The more you understand
about how the big guys operate, the better you can attract their attention.
If you need some convincing that partnering is truly a good way to go, look
no further than the following list, where we present some of the benefits your
company can generate by working with partners rather than working alone:
 Accessing new ideas. You can network with other companies to
broaden your perspective and leverage external knowledge.
 Speeding to market. You can see beyond your organization’s boundaries
to find a missing NPD link that may get your new product to market
quicker.
 Meeting a customer need. You may find inventions that allow your orga-
nization to address specific customer needs or differentiate your new
products.
 Getting value from your inventions. In the open innovation paradigm,
you can manage your technology and intellectual property (IP) so that, if
you don’t have a use for it, you can sell or license it to other companies.
 Breaking into new markets. A partner may be able to introduce you to
markets your company couldn’t have entered on its own.
Deciding Whom to Partner With
Sometimes, your choice of partner is obvious. Two companies already know
each other and may have worked together on previous NPD projects. Perhaps,
during your work, you identified some additional ways that you can benefit
each other. For example, a company that makes oxygen delivery systems was
able to improve its product by working with a company that had expertise 
in moisturizing oxygen. The second company benefited from the partner’s
much more elaborate product line and wider reach into the market. Other
times, you have a specific need or opportunity, and you must target a com-
pany that can make your NPD dreams come true. In the latter scenario, the
world is your oyster (or your potential partner).
How will you identify the best companies from the list of maybes? Co-author
Robin used a process at DuPont called Strategic Gap Analysis. Following are
the general steps of the process and how the folks at DuPont used it:
305
Chapter 16: Choose Your Partner! Partners in Product Development

1. Clearly identify the need or opportunity for which a partner may be
appropriate.
For example, DuPont identified an opportunity to expand its nylon busi-
ness globally, and in particular in Taiwan and other Asian countries.
2. Gather a team of people — preferably employees who are familiar
with the NPD area you want to address in your project and who repre-
sent different functions and areas of expertise.
They formed a cross-functional team (see Chapter 10), which included
people with expertise in M&A (mergers and acquisitions), nylon tech-
nologies and processes, marketing and market research, and so on.
3. The team members identify whether their company can be a winner
in the market, the processes, and the technology for this project.
To do this step, the team should address the following three questions:
• Market: What’s the best way to access the target customers with a
compelling message?
• Process: What’s the best way to develop the new product, including
design, development, packaging, launch, and other issues? How can
we produce a streamlined flow of new product for our customers?
• Technology: What’s the best technology to use in this new product?
Robin’s team members identified DuPont’s strengths in the areas that
they would need in order to succeed. These strengths included market
knowledge, customer access, process and technology, and employees.
You may want to schedule several meetings for your analysis team.
Team members will raise many questions at the first meeting, and you’ll
do a much better job if you can do some research to answer the ques-
tions before you forge ahead to a decision.
4. With this combined understanding of market, process, and technol-
ogy, the team identifies what the company can accomplish internally
and where the gaps are.
If you list the questions and answers from Step 3 in a table, you can put
green, yellow, and red dots against each element of the winning scenarios.
Green means “go” — in other words, your company can go to market
without outside help; yellow means there are gaps, but not show-stop-
pers; red means you’ll need help to accomplish your goal.
DuPont’s matrix (see Figure 16-1), not surprisingly, showed they had
great strengths in the necessary technologies and processes. What they
were weak in, in this case, was market knowledge and employees, and
what they need most of all is access to customers in the new market.
306
Part IV: New Challenges in Product Development 

5. Create a list of potential partners, and use dots to show their capabili-
ties against each of the required elements.
DuPont started a search for a Taiwanese partner. The result was a 50-50
joint venture called DuPont Far Eastern Company, between DuPont Nylon
and Far Eastern Textile Ltd. (FETL), which constructed and operated a $100
million nylon fiber plant located in Taiwan, using new fiber-spinning tech-
nology from DuPont and local resources and knowledge from FETL. The
joint venture successfully introduced products into the Taiwanese market.
You can do a Web search to identify potential partners. Also, employees usu-
ally know pretty well who’s good at what in their particular fields, so a combi-
nation of internal and external approaches works best. Use the red, yellow,
and green dots again to show the team’s guesstimate regarding the potential
partners’ capabilities in the areas you’re interested in.
Structuring the Business 
Partner Relationship
You can join forces with others in the NPD game in many different ways. The
approach you choose depends on how serious you want the relationship to
be and on your company’s and project’s business situations. These variables
make your organization’s decision complex, but if you consider the possibili-
ties before you jump in, you’re more likely to come up with a partnering model
that works for you. We go through the variables you must consider in the sec-
tions that follow.

Chapter 16: Choose Your Partner! Partners in Product Development

Deciding how “serious” the 
relationship should be
When teaming up with a business partner, the form of the partnership you
create determines how involved the relationship will be. NPD alliances run
the gamut from the relative simplicity of a vendor or supplier contract to the
complexity of mergers and acquisitions. Take a look at Chapters 8 and 15 for
more on the spectrum of partner relationships, from just dating to buying
your first house together.
The following list reads from least to most complex and from least to most
involved — and from least to most risky!
 Vendor/supplier: In this relationship, you’re the customer, and ending
the relationship is easy.
 Preferred supplier: In a preferred supplier relationship, you have each
made concessions to the other that make the relationship more attrac-
tive on both sides but also harder to dissolve.
 Outsource partner: In an outsource partner relationship, your company
keeps control of the entire project, including any intellectual property.
However, the outsource partner isn’t just making “stuff” that you could
probably get elsewhere without much difficulty. The partner is providing
you with key input that depends on your partner’s capabilities to
develop or produce that input.
 Joint venture: In a joint venture, or JV, both parties pony up with equity,
and both share in the profits and the expenses. However, their intellectual
property and know-how assets are usually not co-mingled.
 Acquisition: If one company finds another company that has “just what
it needs,” and if the price is right, one company may acquire the other. In
that case, of course, all the assets and IP of the acquired company are
brought into the acquiring company.
 Merger: If you find a company that has just what you need, it may be
time to consider a merger. In a merger, the two companies come together
under common ownership and duke it out over who will do what, whose
processes will survive, and so on.
You should choose the partner relationship that allows you to get the job
done with the least amount of involvement from the partner. A supplier, for
example, gives you more flexibility than a preferred supplier because you can
negotiate prices and easily move to another supplier if you find one that will
give you a better deal in terms of quality or price. A joint venture has an easier
exit path than an acquisition, while an acquisition allows the acquiring com-
pany to preserve its company’s culture and competencies — things that the
company may have to blend, and perhaps lose, in a merger.
308
Part IV: New Challenges in Product Development 

On the other hand, you want to choose the partner relationship that gives you
a level of commitment on par with the goals you want to achieve. A supplier can
easily walk away from the partnership, leaving you with no resources to meet
your deadlines. However, you’re more likely to lose valuable intellectual prop-
erty with an outsource partner or a JV than you are in a supplier relationship.
Consider the following factors when making your choice:
 How much you need the partner, and for what
 The importance of the project to your goals and objectives
 How big the project is compared to your entire portfolio
 How long the partnership is likely to last
We’d love to give you a yardstick to measure all these variables, but in the
end, the partnership decision you make is a judgment call. If you consider all
these variables, though, you make decisions with your eyes wide open. (Read
the section “Unveiling the How-To’s and Secrets of Collaboration,” later in this
chapter, to find out how creating good contracts and managing your partner-
ships are critical tasks for success in partner relationships.)
Investigating the different flavors of
alliances and partnerships
Partnerships come in many shapes and sizes. If you work for a small com-
pany, your choice of a partner may be a life-or-death decision. If you work for
a larger company, the decision may affect only an individual project or busi-
ness unit. For a big company, success is nice, but disaster shouldn’t be fatal.
However, both large and small players should be thinking about some key
factors as they research possible alliances. The following sections point out
food for thought.
Understanding your core competencies is at the heart of partnership deci-
sions. See Chapter 8 for more on identifying them, and see the later section
“A Line in the Sandbox: Deciding What Assets to Keep and What to Share” for
more on how core competencies affect partnership decisions.
David-and-Goliath alliances
How do the big companies get the technologies they need to provide customer
value and to differentiate their products? Instead of, or in addition to, devel-
oping the technologies themselves, they often look for little businesses that
have the inventions they need. And how do the little companies get technolo-
gies and get into markets that, at their size, they wouldn’t be able to enter?
309
Chapter 16: Choose Your Partner! Partners in Product Development

They find a bigger company that has the technology and market reach that
their innovative new products deserve.
David-and-Goliath matches can come together in several ways:
 A big guy may want to make use of the growing number of brokers who
help corporations find the geniuses in their garages — people who just
happen to have the solutions the big guys are looking for.
 The little guys may rather be inventors than entrepreneurs. If you fit this
bill, get yourself listed on a Web site that helps link businesses like yours
to the corporate world. (See the sidebar “Connect and develop.”)
 An alliance with a larger company can provide a little guy — who, almost
by definition, has limited resources — with the technology support and
access to markets needed to take its brainchild to a whole new level.
Suppose the little guy can improve the texture of chocolate to rival any
chocolate in the world. Where is her invention worth more? In a kitchen
in Hackensack, New Jersey, or with a world-class chocolatier like Nestlé
or Hershey?
 A big guy can expand its resources by acquiring or partnering with a
smaller company that has the technology, product, or market presence
the big guy needs. Suppose the big guy who manufactures equipment for
the movie industry needs to fill a gap in its product line. What makes
more sense — to buy it from the guy in the garage who happens to have
invented it several years ago, or to go through the hassles of product
design and development more or less from scratch? And how much
better if the little guy actually has credibility in that fairly niche market?
310
Part IV: New Challenges in Product Development 
Connect and develop
Proctor and Gamble (P&G), a multinational man-
ufacturer, has coined the phrase “connect and
develop” for its practice of locating inventors
who can solve the company’s technology prob-
lems. Have you eaten a potato chip with a trivia
question printed on it? P&G acquired that tech-
nology after one of its engineers tried to use her
ink-jet printer on a piece of potato. Needless to
say, neither the printer nor the potato came
through the experience very well. But using an
innovation broker, the company found someone
who — this is true! — had figured out how to
accomplish this amazing feat.
Take a look at the Harvard Business Review
article “Connect and Develop: Inside Proctor &
Gamble’s New Model for Innovation” by Huston
and Sakkab (March 2006). You’ll find more
examples of how companies are using broker-

Building strength by joining forces: Little + little
Are you a little guy who isn’t ready to trust your fortunes to a big partner? Be
on the lookout for another small company, possibly a start-up like you, whose
capabilities are a good match for yours. The path you choose depends on
your business situation:
 If you have a super technology but not a great way to get it to market,
look for a company with good distribution and the need for an influx of
new products to feed the market. If there is such a company, you proba-
bly are already aware of it. It’s not exactly hiding its light under a bushel.
 If you have good products already in the market, but you aren’t strong in
innovation, look for a partner who can revitalize your product lines.
When giants dance: Big + big
Partnerships among the giants usually are focused on particular technologies
or markets. When a large company wants to explore a new business, it can
get up to speed very quickly by finding a partner who could use what the
company has — and whose capabilities could get the company from 0 to 60
in a fraction of the time. For example, when TV manufacturers wanted to pro-
duce a high-quality, low-cost TV screen, they didn’t develop the technology
on their own. They partnered with glass manufacturer Corning, Inc., which
had also partnered with GE in the early days to manufacture a high-quality,
low-cost glass envelope for Edison’s invention.
The old saw about corporate alliances, mergers, and partnerships is that A + B
always equals less than the sum of A and B, or what the companies had when
they were independent. This has been so true, and the phenomenon of part-
nership has become so prevalent, that we think the dancers are learning some
lessons. So take care if you’re in a large company that’s thinking of partnering,
but realize also that the kinds of experiences you can read about here are
revising the chances for success upwards.
Keeping an eye out for more 
potential partners
The first time you enter into an alliance, it will probably be because a likely
partner appeared on your doorstep or was introduced to you by a customer
who thought you’d have something in common. Or you attended a confer-
ence and found out about a company that seemed to have exactly what you
needed.

Chapter 16: Choose Your Partner! Partners in Product Development

That’s a fine way to start. But we hope that your approach to partnering is
getting more sophisticated. If you run Strategic Gap Analysis sessions (see
the earlier section “Deciding Whom to Partner With”) with some regularity,
you’ll identify issues on which you’d like to partner and partners who might
fill the gap. If the company takes a position with respect to partnering — for
instance, if the company has declared in an annual report that it will grow its
reach at least in part through judicious partnering — employees will be on
the lookout for partnering opportunities.
We recommend that your company identify a specific person who is responsi-
ble for scouting out potential alliances and partnerships. The more potential
partners you have in view, the more choice you have when it comes time to
get serious. Here are a few tips:
 Refresh the list of gaps often. Use a process like the Strategic Gap
Analysis we describe earlier in this chapter.
 Assign people to scout for likely partners. Let them know what the
company is looking for — the gaps and the strategic opportunities —
and encourage them to keep their eyes and ears open at conferences, 
in Web searches, and in the many ways that employees relate to the
“outside world.”
 Keep a list of possible partners, along with the gaps they might fill
and the strategies they might contribute to. Update and refresh the list
as employees bring in new ideas.
With a nice long list of potential partners, linked to the potential contribution
they could make to the company, you’ll be able to work with the businesses
to identify the ones that should be courted now.
Who does the courting? It depends on the size of the project and the serious-
ness of the relationship contemplated. In Japan, CEOs often engage in what
they call “golf talk” to set up a partnership, even though others are responsi-
ble for setting up the actual relationship.
When both parties are looking interested, it’s time to talk about contracts.
But first, take a look at the next section to make sure you’re not giving away
the crown jewels. And see the section later on “Writing a contract” to see
what to do when it’s time to dot the i’s and cross the t’s.
A Line in the Sandbox: Deciding What
Assets to Keep and What to Share
You don’t want to give away your company’s most treasured secrets. If you do,
you’ll become an empty shell whose only function is to coordinate the innova-
tion efforts of others. So you have to be cautious about what you partner on.
312
Part IV: New Challenges in Product Development 

The answers to tough partnering questions will become apparent if you have
a good grasp on what your core technologies, products, and processes are.
The following list gives you a pretty simple way of categorizing what you
should partner on and what you should guard:
 If you have the competency and capacity to develop a strategically
important technology, you should keep this asset inside. For example,
Caterpillar has developed the technology to build energy-efficient, clean
off-road vehicles. This is a strategic asset for them, especially as emis-
sions regulations seem to be getting tougher.
 If you have the competency and capacity and the asset isn’t strategi-
cally important, you may want to outsource work — unless you can do
it yourself more cheaply or easily. Caterpillar designs and develops a
lot of the components that make up its vehicles, but it outsources many
of the components that it doesn’t regard as strategic. (See Chapter 15 for
more on outsourcing.)
 If you don’t have the competency or capacity and the necessary asset
isn’t strategically important, you should outsource the work. Over
time, as you outsource work that’s not strategically important, you’ll
stop building those capabilities — so make sure you’ve chosen things
you don’t mind depending on others for. For example, car manufacturers
often outsource many aspects of interior design and don’t have the abil-
ity in-house to do that kind of work.
 If you don’t have the competency or capacity and the asset is strategi-
cally important, you should develop a relationship with a trusted part-
ner or acquire the competency by buying it. You also may consider
developing the competency internally, depending on how long and
expensive the project would be, or merging with a partner who can fill
the gaps (see the earlier section “Deciding Whom to Partner With”).
Even though you can easily create four categories and see what makes sense
in each of them, the devil is always in the details and the borderline cases.
Only through open and frank internal discussion and by using good prac-
tices, such as technology mapping (see Chapter 7) and identifying your new
product strategies and opportunities (see Chapter 3), can you make tough
decisions about what to partner on and what to guard inside.
Unveiling the How-To’s and 
Secrets of Collaboration
You’ve done all the hard work of deciding what to partner on, researched pos-
sible partners, and figured out the right partnership model. You’ve courted and
won a partner. Now comes the equally hard work of making the partnership

Chapter 16: Choose Your Partner! Partners in Product Development

work. In this section, we stress a few things we’ve discovered about what makes
business partnerships work — whether they’re large/small, small/small, or
large/large (see the earlier section “Investigating the different flavors of
alliances and partnerships”). You can also find some tips about how to col-
laborate with global partners in Chapter 15.
Writing a contract
A partnership contract lays out the financial and other agreements that will
structure the relationship. Of course, writing a contract for work with a supplier
will be much easier than writing a contract for a JV. Supplier contracts should
be mainly boilerplate. Contracts for more complex relationships will need to be
created to meet the specific goals and circumstances of the partnership.
Writing a good contract depends on the following:
 Making the partnership goals clear
 Specifying who will be involved
 Including contingencies for managing change
A good partnership is seldom static; you can rarely see all the way to the end
of the partnership road.
In light of all this contract talk, here’s a piece of very good advice: Write the best
contract you can, and then put it aside. The success of your partnership truly
depends on how well you build and maintain the relationship. It depends on
what the folks at pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly call “alliance management.”
If you don’t have a good contract, you’ve created a recipe for disaster. But if
your strategy for managing the partnership is to point to what the contract
says in section 3.a.1, you’ve lost the chance to develop the relationship that a
successful partnership depends on.
Setting the frame for communication
Who does the communicating in a successful partnering relationship? Everyone
who is involved. Imagine that the partnership is two side-by-side tall buildings
and that every floor of each building has windows that open toward a window
in the other building. On each floor there are different people whose work is
affected by the partnership. The CEOs and business leaders are probably on the
top floor; on the other floors, you can find R&D, marketing, sales, and so on.
314
Part IV: New Challenges in Product Development 

As the partnership progresses, the people behind the windows pay more and
more attention to the people behind the windows in the other building. The
business leaders hang out at the window during their coffee break, chatting
with the business leaders from the other side. The engineers have fixed up a
signal system so they can alert their buddies on the other side every time a
new and wonderful idea occurs to them. The marketers, of course, have flag-
poles — when a marketer runs something up her flagpole, the marketer on
the other side comes to his window and the two head out to Starbucks for a
chat. The people behind the windows can also signal people on other floors,
so they can include marketing in the CEO’s strategic chat, or R&D in discus-
sions about target markets or the future of the partnership.
The point of the metaphor is to remind you that communication — the life’s
blood of the partnership — needs to run through all its available veins, and
that good partnerships continually grow new veins through which people 
can communicate. We get a gold star for mixed metaphor with that one, don’t
we? Forgive us, but remember the metaphors and heed the “golden rules” we
list here:
 Overcommunicate. Never assume that a partner understands what
you’re trying to say. Remember: “The biggest danger in communication
is the illusion that it has been achieved.”
 Outline clear goals and objectives for your partnership. This task is
important for people who work alone and for teams, but its importance
goes up exponentially with the number and distance of the partners.
 Set up a clear communication system. Share e-mails and create an Intranet
repository for important documents. This is important for people and
teams within a single company; its importance goes up exponentially
when you’re working between companies.
 Develop a language for communication. Each company comes to the
partnership with its own way of representing information. You should
take the time to create a common language so that the assumptions and
knowledge of each partner are transparent. Note: The initial lack of a
common language can be an asset.
 Make requests, promises, schedules, and deliverables clear. Good pro-
ject management is a critical element of good partnerships — and of
successful new product development in general (see Project Management
For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Stanley Portny [Wiley] for more on this
essential skill). Of course your partnership will have clear goals and
objectives (see the section “Writing a contract,” for example), but the
goals for the partnership don’t include all the work the partners will do.
That’s much more fine-grained. What a bummer when a partnership
flounders because one side says, “I didn’t know you expected me to
come up with that research by today.”
315
Chapter 16: Choose Your Partner! Partners in Product Development

Getting an A+ in alliance management
When pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly decided on a strategy of alliances
and partnerships to grow the organization, a board member challenged the
company by saying “If alliances are so critical to our success, then what are
we doing to improve our alliance management capability?”
In response, Lilly created an Office of Alliance Management (OAM) to build
that capacity even as it managed existing alliances. The folks at Lilly’s OAM
like to say “We don’t make alliances — we make them better.” Selecting the
partner and writing the contract are essential to making good alliances, but
too many companies stop there.
David Vondle and Mike Ransom shared these tips at a recent IAPD workshop:
 Don’t expect alliances to work on their own. Create guidelines for
alliances that provide the stepping stones partners will need.
 Help alliance partners develop a common language. See the earlier
section “Setting the frame for communication” for more on this.
 Build your alliance competency by keeping track of what works and
what doesn’t. In this way you’ll improve your guidelines and create a
core competency for your company.
The OAM at Lilly provides training for teams that work in alliances. Its mem-
bers develop and share processes and tools, and they provide facilitation
when the partners need to resolve issues. The OAM measures the ongoing
health of an alliance with a tool called the VOA, or voice of the alliance. By
identifying parameters that are critical to alliance health, the OAM often can
nip problems in the bud and offer help to alliances that may be headed for
trouble.
Our advice to you: Take partnership seriously, and begin to build your own
knowledge base. Follow Lilly’s lead and collect good practices. Assign person-
nel whose primary job is to monitor and support the health of your alliances.

A
uthors always have bits of information they want 
to tell you about that just don’t seem to fit in their
books. That’s why we have For Dummies Part of Tens lists!
In these two chapters, we give you hints, tips, and some
good old facts about how to improve your products with
the judicious use of testing and how to select metrics to
make sure that all your product development efforts are
paying off.
When you’re developing products, you’re coming up with
something new, so it stands to reason that you need to test
and measure. Product developers — whatever function
they’re from — work a bit like experimental scientists.
“What if we designed the product this way?” “What would
happen if we used this kind of process?” The way to find
the answers is by running experiments, or tests, and mea-
suring the results. The information in this part helps you
design experiments so you can improve the products you
introduce, as well as the practices and processes you use
to develop them.

Ten Ideas on Ways to Test 
Your New Products
In This Chapter
 Utilizing qualitative and quantitative research
 Checking progress with prototypes
 Tracking your products over their lifecycles
P
roduct testing should start before your development team even has a
product concept and continue throughout the product lifecycle. Testing
opens doors to many ideas, allows you to make sure that you have a good
product concept, and helps you improve on the product even after it’s in the
market. In this chapter, we give you an outline of tests that follow the flow of
the product development process. You can read this chapter top to bottom
to get an idea of the sequence of tests product developers use, or you can
just skip through and pick out the tests you need for your current projects.
To achieve success with many of the tests we include in this chapter, you
need the assistance of experts: marketers, engineers, facilitators, and so on.
Some larger companies have a lot of expertise in-house. But if you need to
hire it in, you can find these experts in many different ways:
 You can do an Internet search for the term Product Testing (you get around
91 million results), select a few firms, and talk with people to get ideas
on narrowing down your search for where to find the help you need.
 You can network with a local professional group, like a Product
Development and Management Association (PDMA) chapter, to ask for
references to firms that can address your particular need.
 You can ask your marketing department to recommend firms it has used
in the past.
 You can ask friends in other companies how they found someone to help
them with their product testing.

Testing expertise is available at many cost levels. The size of your testing
program should correlate to the size of the firm you work with, and to the
size of the project. Don’t make the mistake of paying more for the test than
you expect to gain from the test results (yes, we’ve seen people do this!). In
all cases, you should budget your new product development project to cover
the necessary testing.
Conducting New Product Concept Testing
Long before your new product development team has anything you can call a
“product,” you can and should start testing. You have two ways to confirm
that you have a good product concept: qualitative market research and quanti-
tative market research. The difference between these methods is that qualita-
tive research tends to be exploratory — it addresses the question “What
could we do?” — while quantitative research confirms, in fact, that you
should push ahead with a project, modify it, or toss it into the scrap heap.
Qualitative market research
You should conduct qualitative research with customers way before you 
even have a product concept. Early research helps your team understand
customers’ needs so that you can come up with ideas for products that meet
those needs. When you ask “What could we do?” qualitative research (in
effect, the customer) answers the question. Customer visits, interviews 
with customers, and observation of customer environments and work/play
processes reveal what they need and want. (Take a look at Chapter 4 for
details on how to conduct this early research.)
After you do come up with a concept (see Chapter 5), you can use a number
of other qualitative methods to zero in on the customer’s reactions to differ-
ent possible functions and features of proposed products, for example using
con-joint analysis or simple preference statements and surveys.
Qualitative research can guide your product development efforts, but what
you discover in a qualitative study can’t tell you how many people want a
certain feature or how many customers might buy a product at a certain
price. In other words, qualitative research may lead your team to develop a
great product, but you can’t count on it to support your business case. For
that, you need quantitative research.
320
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Quantitative market research
Quantitative research answers the how much and how many questions your
development team needs to answer to develop the business case (see
Chapter 12). In other words, you take something that represents the product
or the product experience to customers you believe would want that prod-
uct, and in so many words, ask “Would you buy this?” “How much would you
pay for it?” And, “When would you like to buy it?” Quantitative research also
helps establish the relative importance of different features. For example,
your team may think that the blue whirly-gig on the top of the product is the
coolest thing since sliced bread, but it may leave most of your target cus-
tomers cold.
Quantitative research helps you come up with statistically significant conclu-
sions about the relative importance of the following:
 The customer needs you identify through qualitative research
 What difference adding or subtracting a feature could make
 The number of people who are likely to buy the product you’re develop-
ing; in other words, how large the total market for a product may be
The usefulness and validity of quantitative research depends on how well
your product development team designs the research. If you ask the wrong
customers whether they want a product or how much a product is worth to
them, you could kill a potentially successful product or go to market with a
product that your target customers don’t really want (in terms of features,
price point, quantity, and so on). Start with qualitative research so you can
identify important questions in your customers’ minds, and follow that work
with quantitative research to establish the significance of what you discover.
Checking Your Progress with Prototypes
When your new product development team moves into the design and devel-
opment phases of the NPD process (see Chapter 9), you’ll encounter a time
when you need to build a prototype — a physical representation of the prod-
uct or product features that has previously existed only in someone’s mind,
or as words on a page or sketches in a software program. People often have
different interpretations of words, but seeing something in physical form greatly
reduces potential confusion over the look, feel, and actions of a product idea
321
Chapter 17: Ten Ideas on Ways to Test Your New Products

or feature. Prototypes differ, depending on the industry and the kind of prod-
uct. They’re hugely important in making sure that the products you design
and build actually perform as your test audiences expect.
In the following sections, you discover the differences between fit, form, and
function prototypes; you see what kind of prototypes work best in different
situations; and you find out how to give rapid prototyping a try.
Going for fit, form, or function
Building a prototype that includes all the parts of the final product (fit), looks
just like you expect the final product to look (form), and does everything you
want the finished product to do (function) takes much longer than creating a
prototype that meets only one or two of these criteria. A prototype should
represent the full fit, form, and function of the product as much as possible,
but we all know that budget constraints sometimes require compromises.
When you have to compromise, remember what information you’re hoping to
get from your prototype test. A service product is more function than any-
thing else, for example. A new paint color is more form (color, texture) and
function (coverage) than it is fit.
When your NPD team is building a prototype, make sure that all your mem-
bers are totally clear about the purpose of the prototype:
 A fit prototype gives the team a chance to see how all the parts go
together. Different members of the team may be working on different
parts of the product. If you don’t track how the parts fit, you may find
the lens occupying the space that belongs to the shutter, or that the
front seat of a car isn’t designed in a way that allows the driver to access
the glove compartment.
 A form prototype makes sure that the beautiful product you designed
will be as beautiful in finished form. A 3-D version of the product may
show flaws that the initial sketches hid. A form prototype also can gen-
erate very interesting discussions with a focus group.
 A function prototype shows how the product will work. In the early
stages, you shouldn’t mind if wires are running all over the place or if
the back of the product is made of cardboard. The point you want to
prove with a function prototype is that when you push the button, the
light really does go on and the bells really do ring.
Deciding which prototype is best for you
Different businesses use different prototypes during the product develop-
ment process. The Product Development and Management Association
322
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Glossary defines prototype as “a physical model of the new product con-
cept.” However, you shouldn’t take the word “physical” too literally. Software
developers make prototypes that consist of code. Service developers make
prototypes that consist of people walking through routines. And financial
developers make prototypes that describe financial transactions in detail.
You have many different kinds of prototypes to choose from, depending on
your business and product lines. We cover the basics in the following list:
 Models of physical products: When you hear the word “prototype,” you
probably think of a physical model of a physical product, such as an air-
plane model in a wind tunnel. A company uses physical prototypes as
early in the design/development process as possible so product devel-
opers can see and feel what they’re working on. Product developers also
show physical prototypes to customers to get feedback. Examples of set-
tings where product developers might use prototypes to get customer
feedback include focus groups and early Alpha Tests.
 Software prototypes: Software is a “virtual product” whose functions can
be represented with a series of screens that represent actual functions.
The software product is all the code that users never see that’s behind the
user interface — that is, the screens the users see or the sounds they hear.
Typically, software designers will develop screens that show what 
would happen if an option on a screen were selected. An example would
be a screen for a new Web site showing multiple options for finding pho-
tographs of whales to test for interest in a Web site that searches for
photographs. The designer would have collected photographs of whales
to show after a selection was made without the necessary code being
written to actually go out to the Internet to find them. Using screens
allows the product team to test for interest in a search concept without
investing in actual product development. Software designers can start
testing their products right away without actually building the product.
They call the tests they use Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Tests, depending
on how “finished” their products are (see the section “Testing Products
in Customers’ Hands” in this chapter).
 Service prototypes: To prototype a service, you really have to create a
“life-size” model and test it with your customers. For example, if a hotel
chain wants to offer a new way to clean rooms for long-term guests, it
has to implement the change in one hotel to see whether it really works
and to gauge guest reactions. You can avoid plenty of costly problems
by testing your services before you send them out to market.
More and more product developers are focusing on “solutions” rather than
products or services alone (see Chapter 5 for more on this topic). If your
organization’s “product” includes a service component, don’t forget to proto-
type and test the service part of it. For example, a new robot lawn mower may
have to include training over the Internet or via CD-ROM to show purchasers
how to set up the robot to work on their lawns. Testing the training module,
323
Chapter 17: Ten Ideas on Ways to Test Your New Products

as well as the lawn mower, ensures that purchasers of the lawn mowing “solu-
tion” actually have a working product.
Giving rapid prototyping a try
Rapid prototypes are models or full-size representations of physical products
built from successive layers of liquid or powdered material that will harden
to become the shapes that represent the product ideas. You use a machine to
build up the representation from a physical or digital drawing or from a set of
instructions from a computer aided design (CAD) system. Not so long ago,
many companies switched to CAD because it’s faster than paper and pencil
and has the ability to generate dimensions and other data that paper models
can’t. CAD also enables teams that work in different places to share their work.
Product developers can look at and feel these rapid prototypes, turn them
over, and share them with customers in idea sessions or focus groups. With
their physical information and feedback, developers can revise, correct, and
add to their original ideas — quickly and painlessly. (In Chapter 14 you can
find out how computer aided design and rapid prototyping connects to the
digital revolution in product development.)
For example, a CAD machine may have been used to develop a drawing of the
Apple iPhone. A rapid prototype machine would use data to produce a physi-
cal model of the phone that developers could use to test how users like the
size and feel of the phone. This provides more valuable testing than a draw-
ing alone could accomplish. The instructions that drive the rapid prototyping
machine also can drive manufacturing robots that produce the case.
As you may have guessed, rapid prototyping can be very expensive and often
isn’t suitable for small start-up companies and the like.
Your organization can use the Internet to give consumers the chance to 
interact with your prototype, or even your product at an advanced stage of
development, and give you feedback. This technique works well for software
products (such as interfaces), financial products (such as new savings accounts
that depend on ATMs or the Internet to capture transactions), and physical
products — if you use graphic design software to show the products and how
they work.
Testing Products in Customers’ Hands
When your NPD team has sailed around a few of the bends in the “river of
development” — when you’ve designed your product, have the ability to 
324
Part V: The Part of Tens 

produce at least a small number, and have brought in customers to react to
how the product looks and functions — the time has come to put some of
your product directly into your customers’ hands to see how they get along.
Whether your team has made a sippy cup for babies or a sophisticated soft-
ware product for bankers, you take a huge chance if you put your product
into the market without seeing how your customers will respond to it. When
your product hits the market, your team can’t tell a baby how to grab the
neat handles you designed, and you can’t tell a banker how to find certain
features. The customers will have to dance without your help, and your prod-
uct has to be the teacher.
Product developers often talk about three stages of product use testing: Alpha,
Beta, and Gamma (this last one is mostly used in software development). They
also use Market Tests. This section discusses each of these tests.
Alpha Tests
The Alpha Test is the first time you put your “real” product into customers’
hands. It isn’t a prototype test. You’ve manufactured or produced your prod-
uct the way you’ll produce subsequent real products. Your finished product
may have bugs, which leads to the point of the Alpha Test: to find out about
the bugs now, not after you’ve manufactured and distributed hundreds or
thousands of products.
Here’s what you need for Alpha Tests:
 A clear understanding, from the product definition (see Chapter 9), of
how the product should perform when in your customers’ hands
 Enough of the product, in its final or near-final form, to run the test
 “Customers” who will use the product
Whenever possible, conduct Alpha Tests with people who work for your
company or with people who are very friendly and won’t spread the word
if your new plastic bags break and they get spaghetti sauce all over them.
 Researchers who will observe and/or interview the customers
 Continuous reporting to assess how the product works for the customers
The more effective your early testing (see the previous sections of this chap-
ter), the smoother your Alpha Tests will be. Put real effort into testing your
concepts and prototypes. Bringing customers in for focus groups or proto-
type tests beforehand can help to avoid Alpha shocks.
325
Chapter 17: Ten Ideas on Ways to Test Your New Products

Beta Tests
Beta Tests are field tests of products. By using a Beta Test, you get to see how
your customers will use your product, allowing you to make modifications if
necessary (although it’s unusual — and upsetting! — to have to make major
changes during Beta Testing). During Beta Tests, you can discover plenty
about how to install your product, how to instruct customers to use it, and
what kinds of questions customers may have. You may even pick up valuable
tips about how to market your product and support it when it hits its market.
Here’s what you need to conduct Beta Tests:
 Products that you’ve “debugged” during Alpha Testing
 Products whose production mirrors the production you intend for your
launch products
 A clear definition of your expectations for the products
 Customers who will use the products and participate in the research
Work with customers who seem friendly, but make sure that their desire
to please you doesn’t prevent them from telling you what’s wrong with
the products.
 Researchers who will observe, test, and report on the progress
 A plan for making the changes to the product suggested by the test
results
You need to be innovative to find enough customers to run your Beta Tests.
One company, for example, tests its packaging by giving away samples at
retirement homes. Its researchers observe whether the residents can open
the packages easily. Some software companies offer customers the chance to
be “Beta-site customers” on the Internet. If you see one of these offers, sign
up to see how the company runs the test.
Gamma Tests
A Gamma Test is the final test phase when a product is in general release. It
assesses how well your product performs, whether it addresses the customer
needs it should address, and how well it satisfies customers. Often, what
characterizes this test phase is the fact that a company will maintain extra
staff to deal with problems that come up after a product’s general release
exposes it to unanticipated user conditions.
326
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Teams in the software industry are more likely to use Gamma Tests. Most
software products are so complex and have to operate in so many different
technical environments that they’re almost never completely bug-free. Often –
we’re sure you know this from your own experience! -- a software firm will
release a product to the open market knowing that while it doesn’t have fatal
bugs, it may have some relatively minor bugs. Finding those bugs, and sup-
porting customers who run into them, is the essence of a Gamma Test. Some
people say software never gets out of Gamma Testing.
Market Tests
Market Testing occurs when the new product and its marketing plan are tested
together. It gives you a chance to find out how well your whole package works.
It also helps you put together a more accurate forecast of how much and how
consistently you can sell so you can update your business plan and prepare
for launch (see Chapter 13). A Market Test should be carried out toward the
end of the product development process.
Here’s what you need to carry out a Market Test:
 Enough product in its final form — complete with packaging, instructional
guides, and any other materials that will allow you to put the product 
in a statistically valid number of users’ hands. The sample size is driven
by the variability of the target market. If users in the target market are
essentially the same, you can get away with a smaller amount of test
product; if the users have many differences, you need enough product
for a large sample.
 Advertising and other promotional materials
 A site, or several sites, where you can carry out the tests
 Researchers who will assess the test results
 A plan for responding to the test results
 Potential customers who represent the conditions in the market you
built the product for. Food companies, for example, have to test every
region of the target market that has different taste preferences. Software
companies have to represent the variety of technical skills and operating
systems found in their defined target market.

Your Innovation Efforts

I
t takes a company, with every division, team, and business group working
together, to be successful at developing new products. At each level of
responsibility, people use benchmarks and metrics to track performance.
Here are the three kinds of output, from three different levels of your com-
pany, that your team’s selection of metrics needs to link:
 Team or project level: The metrics focus on project progress, quality,
and output.
 Management or process level: The metrics focus on process quality,
strategic balance, and output.
 Corporate level: The metrics focus on strategic balance and financial
outcomes.
In this chapter, we describe many ways to measure output in each of these
areas. (Kind of like a few Part of Tens chapters in one — aren’t you lucky!)
Browse through this chapter to pick out three to five metrics that address 
different areas of performance that will help your company’s leaders assess
what’s important to them. (If you choose more than that, you’ll spend too
much time measuring and providing reports that members of management
won’t read.) The goals and the outcomes at each of the three levels of prod-
uct development are fundamentally interrelated. Choose metrics that assess
the impact each of these levels has on the others. You can add more metrics,
or replace unsatisfactory ones, after you give your first choices a fair shake.

Here’s a saying we read on a tea bag: To err is human; to blame the error on
someone else is even more human. Some company leaders use metrics to
determine who they can blame when things go wrong. That rarely — or never,
we suspect — gets at the real causes of the problems. In fact, using metrics
for that purpose is more likely to make the problems worse. Beating people
over the head isn’t a good way to use a yardstick! Instead, you should use
metrics to pinpoint what’s going right so that you can do more of it, and
what’s going wrong so that you can fix it.
Ten (Minus Two) Ways to Keep Track of
Your Teams’ Progress
During the phase/review process of new product development (see Chapters
9 and 12), the NPD team and its team leader commit to meeting certain deliv-
erables, or milestones, in a specific time frame. If the team falls short, it has
either overpromised or underdelivered. Both of these actions send a clear
signal that the team needs to make some changes to get in sync with manage-
ment’s expectations.
The following list presents types of metrics that track team and project
progress. The team is largely responsible for the first four metrics; a failure to
meet any of the second four may signal that the process is broken.
If you’re working on an NPD team that doesn’t receive adequate support, be
the squeaky wheel. The issues that plague you and your colleagues will con-
tinue to undermine your efforts and your company’s ability to thrive. (See
Chapter 11 for more on project resources.)
 Deliverables completed at each phase review: The measure to aim for
is to complete 100 percent of set deliverables. However, in some cases, a
team can allow some deliverables to slide. In such a case, the team
should document the following:
• Specific information about the incomplete deliverables
• Why the incompletions won’t detract from the review
• Plans for completing the deliverables in the next phase
 Business case measures: The business case features a number of 
measures — such as market size or sales forecasts, which impact finan-
cial performance — that the NPD team commits to meeting. The team
should update the business case measures at each review, accounting
for any slippage or overage and reviewing the impact on the project’s
business merit. (See Chapter 12 for more on business cases.)
330
Part V: The Part of Tens 

 Schedule: The target for meeting the proposed schedule should be zero
slip-ups. If that isn’t possible, the team should shoot for quick recover-
ies. One schedule slip tends to lead to another, and the impact on the
project often is cumulative. Arriving late to market, for example, can
blow an entire business case.
If many projects show large numbers of schedule slips, NPD teams may
be facing process issues such as underresourcing or overpromising. 
The managers need to solve these process problems. When teams are
stretched to the limit, they can’t do much more to fix the problems on
their own.
If your NPD team can develop a product quickly and for less money, you
should earn a blue ribbon, right? Not necessarily. One of the most impor-
tant process metrics is predictability. If you can develop a product faster
and cheaper, those forecasts should show up at the beginning of the pro-
ject in your schedule and budget.
 Budget: The budget for a development project is tied to the business
case, so the target for the budget is to never go over. However, the cost
of a project can be much less significant than other measures. You may
be fine with exceeding the budget if, for instance, you can get the prod-
uct to market quicker or lower the cost of the product. You can make
budget decisions at a scheduled review (see Chapter 12), or you can call
a special review if time is pressing. At the meeting, the team resets the
budget, with the agreement of the reviewers, and the adjusted budget
becomes the new target.
 Percent of turnover within the core team: When the core development
team experiences turnover, it’s hard for team members to work together.
The commitment of the remaining team members may flag; valuable
knowledge walks out the door with the departing team member; and
new members need to be brought up to speed. Often, the cause of exces-
sive turnover is systemic, stemming from the team’s lack of resources or
the company’s lack of commitment to the NPD efforts. The problem usu-
ally requires the intervention of top management. (See Chapter 10 for
more on the core team.)
 Changes to product design: These changes are often referred to as engi-
neering change notices, or ECNs. A high number of ECNs can mean that
the process for achieving a stable definition of a product and project is
flawed. Perhaps the teams don’t spend enough time at the early product
definition stage. ECNs also can stem from schedule issues and budget
overruns.
 Feature changes: These changes, often referred to as feature creep, can
happen when a product team gets more excited about its product and
technology than its customers’ needs (see Chapter 4) and the business
case (see Chapter 12). An example is a team adding road-mapping 
331
Chapter 18: Ten (Or More) Ways to Track Your Innovation Efforts

capabilities to a cellular phone designed for the low-end market, just
because the technology is available. Feature changes lead to schedule
and budget overruns. Even worse, they can lead to products that don’t
fit with the team’s strategic objectives or the company’s market realities.
Feature changes should occur only when customer needs change, and
should be documented, prior to product release.
 Reuse of product features, or platformization: We’re looking for a high
score here! Companies can create great leverage by making sure their
products and NPD teams reuse work that other products and teams
have utilized in the past. The more your NPD teams work from technol-
ogy or product platforms, the cheaper their projects will be and the
quicker they’ll get to market. Look at Chapter 3 for a deeper discussion
of platforms.
An excellent example of feature reuse is a small battery-driven motor for
hand-held drills, screwdrivers, and sanders. Product developers using
the same motor and battery design created a family of tools that all work
off the same motor and battery. This technique saves on design and pro-
duction costs and creates a nifty feature that increases customer appeal.
Ten Ways to Measure the Health of Your
Product Development Processes
Your organization needs to measure the health of your product development
processes. Companies that have effective processes get products developed
faster, spend less money doing so, get more products to market, and generate
higher revenues from new products than companies with less-effective NPD
processes. This section lists a number of metrics that can help you gauge the
effectiveness of your processes and target your process improvement efforts
where they’ll do the most good.
Note: The first four metrics in this list provide a yardstick to measure how
well your projects are doing, on average. The second four help you measure
the value your processes are delivering. And the last two identify whether
your projects are linked to strategic objectives.
 Number of teams fully resourced: At each review, your company should
set a schedule of resources the NPD teams need in the future. Ideally, the
teams should have 100 percent of the resources the company commits
to them at each review. Not having all the required resources means pro-
jects won’t get completed on time and will begin to clog up the NPD
pipeline.
332
Part V: The Part of Tens 

 Number of projects that meet schedule and budget targets: The goal
with this metric is predictability. You don’t want projects that exceed or
fall short of their goals; you want to build the project management skills
that allow your teams to estimate, with accuracy, how long the projects
will take and how much they’ll cost. Team members and company lead-
ers must be able to tell the truth about projects in order to do well on
this metric.
 Time spent in phases: Knowing how long similar projects in other com-
panies usually spend in the different phases of the development process
can give you benchmark numbers, which help you assess whether a par-
ticular project is spending too much time in one phase. If it is, you can
take corrective action. For example, you might find a study that says
companies of a size similar to yours take five months to move from
ideation to funding approval. If your team is taking nine months, you
need to look at why you’re exceeding the norm. Benchmark numbers
also can help you set targets in an attempt to reduce overall cycle time.
Cycle time is a dependent variable, which means you can’t reduce it
directly. What you can do is spend enough time upfront to ensure clear
product definition, fully resource your teams, and have clear review cri-
teria and practices in place. Take a look at the recent Product Develop-
ment and Management Association (PDMA) study on its Web site
(www.pdma.org) for more.
 Percentage of products that meet or exceed goals set at the Feasibility
Review: The higher the percentage, the better. This metric indicates
that teams are spending sufficient time and effort to plan well in the
early part of the process, and also that projects are well supported in
the NPD pipeline.
 Value and average value of programs in development: This metric is a
summary of the net present value (NPV) of each project plus the total
value of all projects your team has underway. The total should equal the
growth objectives for the corporation.
 Percentage of product ideas that meet or exceed goals: Can you
believe that many companies don’t go back to check whether their new
products have met the targets they set at the beginning of the projects?
Yikes! How can you get better if you don’t know how you’re doing? This
metric focuses on goals stated in the original business plan, and typi-
cally looks at projects after one year in the market. The percentage
should be high — at least 80 percent— and moving toward the desired
goal of 100 percent. These goals are easily identified and measured. Did
development time and costs come in as projected? Did you sell the
number of units you projected for the first quarter, six months, year? 
Did your gross margin and net margin results come in as projected?
333
Chapter 18: Ten (Or More) Ways to Track Your Innovation Efforts

 Investment per product: You calculate this metric as follows:
Total dollars of manpower + cost of development equipment and sup-
plies + cost of tests + launch and promotion costs invested in new prod-
uct development ÷ the number of products commercialized
The final number should drop over time to show increased efficiency in
the development process.
 Percent of management time devoted to NPD: Most research shows
that when management puts skin in the game, its development processes
improve. Managerial involvement is most important when your processes
are new; it becomes less important when the processes have gone through
many cycles of improvement. The best scenario is for management to
get into the habit early and stay with the effort, even after the processes
start to work well.
This metric isn’t a call for management to get involved with the techni-
cal or project-level activities of the team. It’s a call for management to
support the practices that lead to product development success.
 Number of ideas entering the Idea/Concept Screen: You want to have a
high number of ideas for this metric. If project reviewers have too few
concepts to review, they can’t select a group of projects that meet your
strategic criteria.
The best way to determine how many ideas you should be generating is
to start keeping records of how many ideas you currently feed into the
screening process, how many ideas make it through each phase, how
many of these ideas go to market, and how well you’re achieving your new
product revenue objectives. Benchmarks on number of ideas required to
achieve commercial success are available. The PDMA Foundation has pub-
lished material on this topic and offers benchmarking services for specific
industries. One study of multiple industries indicated that out of 100 ideas
generated, about 70 cleared the idea screening process, around 50 cleared
the business case screen, about 35 completed development, and around
25 reached commercialization. Probably less than ten were financially
successful. (See Chapters 5 and 6 for more advice on how to increase
the number of ideas and for basic info on the Idea Screen.)
 Comparison of products in development to portfolio criteria: Your team
should be able to map the products you have in development against
your portfolio criteria to find out whether the next crop of products to
hit the market will fulfill such targets as risk versus reward, product line
enhancement, “strategic buckets,” and so on. See Chapters 3 and 11 for
more on these terms and targets.
The company’s strategic team should review this comparison frequently.
New opportunities will show up, your company’s strategic focus will shift,
and some projects will under- or overperform. Also, in order to keep the
products in development and the portfolio criteria matched up, the review
judgments of individual projects need to be tied to portfolio criteria.
334
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Ten (Divided by Two) Metrics to Make
Sure Your NPD Efforts Are Paying Off
An organization’s executives want to extract maximum value from their com-
pany’s investment in new product development. They want assurance that
their spending falls in line with business strategy, that the projects in devel-
opment are in sync with business objectives, and that their investments will
help the corporation meet its revenue and growth goals.
Corporate product developers use a balance of financial and strategic met-
rics to assess the health of their new product efforts and to ensure that their
company’s investments are helping them meet growth goals. We outline these
metrics in the list that follows:
 Percent revenue and/or number of new products launched in the past
XX years: Companies in fast-moving industries, such as telecommunica-
tions, may set a target as high as 50 percent of revenue coming from
products introduced in the past, say, three years. Companies in older,
more slow-moving industries, such as specialty chemicals, may set a
target of 15 percent, or even less, introduced in the past five years. Not
meeting these targets is an indication that the NPD process isn’t per-
forming as desired, and an examination of process metrics is in order.
(That is, go back one step to the metrics in the previous section!) Even
doing better than plan is cause for investigation. Exceeding targets
should lead the team to determine why — is it because older products
are delivering lower-than-expected revenues, is there something chang-
ing in your target markets? And if you’re doing something really great,
you want to know so you can make sure you keep doing it.
Not many companies depend on the number of new products they launch
as a target, because the profitability of each product varies greatly. Also,
that target is very open to gaming — for instance when product develop-
ers make minor tweaks and list the projects as “new products.”
 Investment in new products as a percent of sales: By comparing the
investment in NPD to sales, and finding out what percentage of sales it
represents, companies can track how well they’re allocating their inno-
vation dollars. For example, say an ice cream company sees sales rising
at 10 percent a year, but new flavor development costs as a percent of
new sales is rising at 20 percent a year. This would result in a lower over-
all profit margin. Perhaps the cause is too many new flavors going into
the same-sized market, so the same number of people are buying the
same amount of ice cream, just buying more different flavors. In this
case it may make more sense to cut back on flavor development and
invest in a larger distribution network.
This metric also helps management assess its commitment to new prod-
uct development. For example, when the percentage is too small, the
335
Chapter 18: Ten (Or More) Ways to Track Your Innovation Efforts

company knows it isn’t putting its weight behind developing new prod-
ucts. In order to have a healthy new product effort, a company must
reinvest some percent of its sales into future products. A good approach
is to find the average for your industry, and the average for the leaders
in your industry, to be sure that your company isn’t shortchanging its
NPD efforts.
 Investment per product versus sales revenue: The ideal trend is for
your company’s investment per product to decline, which shows that
your sales revenue per product is, on average, increasing. You get the
ratio as follows:
(The investment per product × the number of products) ÷ the total sales
revenue
Take the ice cream company from the earlier bullet and change a few
things. Instead of sales rising at 10 percent, say they’re rising at 20 per-
cent a year, and development costs are rising at 10 percent a year. The
decline in development costs leads to increased profit margin. Maybe it
happened because you reused some research, or you just got more effi-
cient in market testing flavors. Whatever the reason, the improvement
becomes even more valuable on a dollar basis as sales revenue grows —
and your job becomes more secure!
 Shareholder Value Added (SVA): Overall, this metric gets at the point of
developing new products: You use some of your corporation’s resources
to increase shareholder value. Again, using the ice cream vendor, you
might say that as a result of a more efficient NPD process, you see an
improvement of 5 cents a share in annual profits. If the ice cream com-
pany is getting a share price to earnings multiple of 18, you just added
90 cents per share to your company’s market value. If the old stock price
were $9 per share, and now it’s $9.90 per share, you just got a return of
10 percent on whatever shares you own, maybe more if you have stock
options. That new Mercedes is closer than you thought!
By pinpointing how new product development adds to shareholder
value in different parts of your company — different business units, for
example — you can focus your resources to increase value.
Too many companies examine financial metrics only at the company
level. Co-author Robin calls this “across the boardism.” As in the previ-
ous example, we recommend that companies divide their corporations
into chunks and compare metrics to see where they’re using resources
effectively.
 Net Present Value (NPV): This financial metric focuses on the cost of
capital — on what it costs to develop products in these terms.
Executives are more interested in the NPV of the entire portfolio of new
product projects, along with the NPV of the portfolios of different busi-
ness units. A comparison between business units can help members of
management see where the company is making wise investments.
336
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Executives shouldn’t rely too much on financial and strategic metrics without
understanding how they link to process and team metrics. When they do, they
may put in motion interventions that don’t promote good project work or
good processes. For example, executives who must drive to meet quarterly
projections may cut development resources, particularly in the front end.
They think, “That won’t deliver anything for several quarters or more anyway.”
This thinking sends the whole system into a tailspin from which it may never
recover. We give only five metrics in this section to underscore the fact that
you shouldn’t rely too much on financial and strategic information alone.
Seeing Ten (Or Fewer) Measures at a
Glance with Dashboard Metrics
Dashboard metrics refers to the process of collecting a group of performance
metrics and displaying them in a simple, easily grasped set of graphs or visual
representations. Think of the dashboard of a car: You have a speedometer,
maybe a tachometer, an odometer, a gas gauge, an oil light, and so on. With a
dashboard metric, an executive might have on one page a graph that shows
rate of increase for sales (speedometer), a bar graph showing monthly per-
cent of sales spent on NPD (tachometer), a line chart showing total revenue
for the year (odometer), and an overview of corporate resources devoted to
NPD (gas gauge). The oil light (you know, the one they call the “idiot light”)
goes on if too many projects come in late to market. Some cars now have GPS
to help the driver figure out where she is. That may be the portfolio map that
shows what kinds of products are in development. One glance at this page
would give a busy executive a quick idea of how the company is doing.
Product developers came up with these metrics for a few reasons:
 They enable development teams to see the all-important financial met-
rics along with operational, process, and statistical metrics. This takes
some of the focus off the financial output taken by itself, and it provides
clues to why the company may or may not be achieving its targets.
 They push companies to select a few key metrics so they don’t drown in
a sea of them.
 They help teams see, at a glance, the links among the different levels
that need to work together.
To build a dashboard — sometimes called a scorecard — you choose the cate-
gories of metrics you want to track.
Dashboards almost always include financial measures, which let you see how
well your development team is accomplishing the corporation’s objectives.
337
Chapter 18: Ten (Or More) Ways to Track Your Innovation Efforts

You also should include strategic objectives to help you stay balanced.
Companies that don’t put enough emphasis on balance may end up filling
their product development pipelines with quick hits and short-term projects
just to meet quarterly financial goals. Putting different kinds of metrics side
by side on your dashboard encourages your company’s executives to con-
sider different drivers of success (or failure) at the same time.
The dashboard is a tool. Your company can find many consultants who can
help you build a process to track in real time your successes and failures. If
you type Dashboard Metrics into your favorite search engine, you’ll find
plenty of variations. After you construct a dashboard, send it out to be used
and ask people for feedback. A few months later, publish a second version of
the dashboard that responds to people’s suggestions. If you find yourself
obsessing over this, give the project away or use some other approach.

Business Case Outline
E
very new product project must have a business case that states clearly
why the company should invest its scarce resources in the project. The
business case provides the basis for judging the success of a product in the
market. The NPD team, with the help of the functions and departments, pre-
pares the business case for the Feasibility Review (see Chapter 9). During the
entire phase/review process, the team updates the business case and pre-
sents it at each scheduled review (see Chapter 12).
Here’s a template you can use to create a project’s business case:
1. Executive Summary: This summary provides a one- to two-page
overview of the whole business case. Most teams find that it’s best to
write the summary after they’ve completed the business case.
2. Project Overview and Business Strategy: In this section, the team
describes the project, the opportunity that the project represents for
the business, and the investment that the team is requesting. The pro-
ject overview answers the following questions:
a. What is the team planning to develop or create? The answer may
be a product with certain features to serve a certain market or a
platform to replace a given product line, for instance. Be sure to
include information that links product features and functionality to
well-understood customer requirements.
b. How is this aligned with the strategy of the organization? The
answer should include technology, product, market, brand,
growth, and other strategic imperatives. Be sure to describe the
relationship of this intended product to the organization’s current
products, product lines, and product portfolio.
c. What resources will the team require? This answer should
include an estimate of employee resources from different functions,
expressed in person-years, as well as any known or predicted capi-
tal, infrastructure, or other expenses. Use ranges in the beginning
and make estimates more precise as the project unfolds.
d. What is the project timing? Include the expected launch date, plus
any information the team has about the window of opportunity
(for instance, any reasons why the product must be launched in a
particular time frame, including seasonal issues, competitors,
market trends, and so on).

3. Market Analysis and Approach: This section explains the opportunity
in the context of the industry, the competitive environment, and clearly
identified market segments.
4. Technology Approach: Here the team describes the strategy and plans
for using or creating technology to meet the customer needs. Be sure 
to include the relationship of technology development plans to the orga-
nization’s technology strategy and to highlight any unusual risks or
uncertainties.
5. Manufacturing and Operations: In this section, the team provides an
overview of the processes and systems it will need to produce/
manufacture and deliver/distribute the product.
6. Supply Chain and Partnership Strategy: Use this section to clearly out-
line the team’s plans for engaging and managing the supply chain and 
to describe any plans for partnering. Highlight important risks and
uncertainties, and show how plans for this project align with the 
organization’s overall supplier/partner strategy.
7. Safety, Health, and Environmental Impact: In this section, the team
addresses sustainability issues, environmental impact, and worker
safety and health.
8. Legal and Regulatory Requirements: This section addresses govern-
mental approval processes as well as intellectual property reviews.
(Your organization’s legal department should be able to help with this
part of the case.)
9. Implementation Plans: This section describes what has to be done,
when, and by whom. Be sure to include commitments by the functions
to their roles and responsibilities for systems, operational elements,
marketing plans, launch plans, sales programs, training, logistics, and
anything else that’s critical to the success of the program.
10. Financial Profile: In this section, the team should provide a clear finan-
cial analysis and an account of its underlying assumptions. Most busi-
ness cases include estimates of sales units and volume, cost targets,
margins, and market share.
11. Risks: In this section, the team identifies potential risks, including finan-
cial risks, market risks, operational risks, and technology risks.
12. Assumptions and Scenarios: The team should articulate its underlying
assumptions and beliefs about the future state of the market and the
organization, as well as the potential impact of these different future
states. Include assumptions about market size, market share, unit fore-
casts, pricing, organizational support, and so on.
