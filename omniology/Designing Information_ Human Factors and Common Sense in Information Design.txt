As knowledge increases among mankind, and 
transactions multiply, it becomes more and more 
desirable to appreciate and facilitate the modes 
of conveying information from one person to 
another, and from one individual to the many.

Full disclosure. Philadelphia 
has been my home since 1972. 
I love it, and I would not dream 
of living anywhere else (in this 
country). I walk its streets, I 
read its newspaper, and I give 
my students assignments 
that engage them with local 
issues, problems, and people. 
The majority of my clients are 
regional. Philadelphia’s designs 
are the designs I know. I hope 
that any criticism of Philadel­
phian design in this book will 
be taken constructively, in the 
spirit in which it is meant, and 
with the understanding that it 
is to some extent the result of 
geographic happenstance.
I have never had any direct 
client-designer relationship 
with any of the originators of 
the designs that I may appear 
to criticize in the book, nor 
are any of those designs by 
designers with whom I com­
peted for work.
Every effort has been made to 
accurately credit the designers, 
artists, and authors whose 
work I have reproduced and 
discussed. Some of those 
acknowledgments and links 
may be unintentionally inac­
curate. To the extent that 
inaccuracies may have found 
their way into this book, I
 sincerely apologize.

Our job as designers is to 
design with intent, so that the objects 
we design function as they are sup­
posed to for those who need them 
and use them.
Our job as information 
designers is to clarify, to simplify,  
and to make information accessible to 
the people who will need it and use it 
to make important decisions. Informa­
tion needs to be in a form they can 
understand and use meaningfully, and 
to tell the truth of what things mean 
and how they work.
The purpose of this book 
is to provide a description of issues 
that confront designers as we attempt 
to translate data into information so 
that our audience can understand it 
and apply it to answer their questions 
and meet their needs.
Everything is designed.
Most people have little understanding 
of the design process, but we all live 
with its results: a sign on the highway, 
an explanation of a medical procedure 
in an emergency room, a diagram on 
how to build a piece of furniture, a 
chart that shows us our assets, a ballot, 
a data-driven decision.
Not everyone realizes this. 
Many people assume that things just 
emerge in their finished visual form, 
like Athena springing, fully armed, 
from Zeus’s forehead. This may explain 
why design isn’t always as good as it 
needs to be.
Introduction
10

Our challenge today is 
almost the opposite from that 
of centuries, or even decades, past: 
to invent ways of sifting through the 
multitudes of data that bombard us 
daily, often numbing our senses and 
scrambling our brains.
In looking at and thinking 
about the issues of designing 
information rationally and function­
ally, I was informed and humbled by 
the work of preceding generations of 
information designers. As a teacher,  
I have learned as much from my stu­
dents as I hope I have imparted. While 
I have occasionally found students a 
bit weak in cultural and design history, 
I attribute this in large measure to the 
ubiquity of technology, which permits 
some of the young to believe that 
everything happened this morning, or 
no earlier than yesterday. This makes 
technology part of the problem as 
well as potentially part of the solution.
In its structure, this book 
endeavors to examine the many 
aspects of designing information. Its 
title is intentional: it is a book about 
ideas and process more than about 
showcasing designs and products 
that have already been designed to fill 
specific needs.
The velocity of the increase 
in accessible data is unprec­
edented, amazing, and increasing. 
Not very long ago in design his­
tory, cartographers (among the first 
modern information designers) were 
decorating their maps with sea mon­
sters, locations of fictional characters, 
and imaginary islands, less for visual 
elegance than to fill the spaces where 
they had no information. “Terra incog­
nita” had multiple meanings.
The ideas in this book have 
been rattling around in my head for 
decades, in one form or another, and 
its goals and form have changed many 
times. I feel that many of the ideas and 
perceptions that occurred to me then 
have been confirmed.
Information design is a hot 
subject for books and websites and 
blogs these days. I’ve learned a great 
deal from the books I’ve read and the 
sites and blogs I’ve visited. To my great 
pleasure, as I communicated with 
peers and colleagues, I found that 
there is a thoughtful, generous com­
munity of designers who are willing to 
share and assist each other.
It is my sincere hope that this book 
may provide similar assistance and 
ideas to its readers.

The nature of information
Indicium est omne 
divisa in partes tres.
(All information is 
divided into three 
parts.)
Paraphrase of Julius Caesar,
in Commentarii de Bello Gallico, 
ca. 40s BCE.
If the Hippocratic 
oath were written for 
designers, it would 
begin, “First, tell no 
lie.”
Like Caesar’s Gaul, information is divided into three principal 
parts.
Information is what you absolutely must clearly 
communicate.
Uninformation is stuff that isn’t necessarily important and 
that probably isn’t untrue. 
•  Within uninformation is where the designer plays and 
dances. 
•  Within uninformation is noninformation, which is often 
uninformation appearing to be information. 
Misinformation is stuff masquerading as information that 
is likely to distort, confuse, and mislead (and possibly injure, 
maim, kill).
•  Misinformation is not necessarily deliberate but may be the 
result of unintentional incompetence, noncurrent data, or 
failure to correctly interpret source data.
•  At the nadir of misinformation is disinformation (from the 
Russian dezinformatsiya), misinformation deliberately used to 
achieve a financial, political, or military objective.
Read Charles Seife. Proofiness. Seife identifies a host of ways in which num­
bers are used, or misused, to convince people and the media that things that 
are demonstrably not true are, in fact, verifiably true.

This inflatable tank is an 
example of disinformation used 
prior to the Normandy landings 
in 1944. Operation Fortitude, as 
it was called, involved the cre­
ation of fake field armies both 
north and south of the actual 
invasion landing site to divert 
Axis attention away from Nor­
mandy. It was one of the most 
successful military deceptions 
of the war.
Propaganda. Could be true; 
could be false; probably incom­
plete. Politicians just love small 
children, don’t they? This photo­
graph is from a 1940 pro-Hitler 
propaganda booklet.

Self-referential vs. functional
Self-referential design is where (only) the designer 
understands.
Pragmatic design is where the user understands.
Whatever the medium and whatever the content, the 
purpose of information design is to convey information to 
the user. If the user can’t understand it, the design and the 
designer have failed.
The difference is not unlike the difference between school 
and the world. In school, students function largely within 
a relatively homogeneous community of their peers 
and instructors, where they learn to research a problem, 
explore alternatives, and defend their solution in terms 
of their thinking and design process. In the world—in 
life—designers, especially information designers, deal with 
communicating information visually to a user group some­
times very unlike themselves.
Often the designer, in life as well as in school, falls into the 
trap of designing for appearance, and using the data, or 
content, not as the core of a communications process but 
as the foundation for explorations of visual excess and irrel­
evance. Many graphic and information design curricula are 
responding to society’s needs and teaching that form grows 
organically out of the need to communicate content.
This conveys a powerful responsibility upon—and a great 
opportunity for—the designer.
“Intellectual”—non-user-centered—design, and personal 
explanations of self-referential design, lead back only to the 
designer, not forward to the user.
Read Jorge Frascara. Communication Design: Principles, Methods, and Practice.
Like good writing, 
good graphical 
displays of data 
communicate 
ideas with clarity, 
precision, and 
efficiency. 
Michael Friendly
The data, the 
designer, and 
the audience are 
the fundamental 
continuum in 
information design.
If it doesn’t work 
for the user, 
no amount of 
explanation can 
make it any better.
Accessible 
symbolism: the 
168 chairs in the 
Oklahoma City 
bombing memorial. 
Inaccessible 
symbolism: the 
1,776-foot height 
of the Freedom 
Tower.
A seminal quote by Richard 
Grefe, Executive Director of the 
AIGA, on the back of a t-shirt 
worn by information designer 
Paul Kahn. I have said, “the 
designer is the medium between 
the information and the user.” As 
with many quotes in this book, 
the identical idea can usually be 
attributed to many people.

18
When it doesn’t work
It’s not enough to know the base data—in its most literal 
sense—of an information graphic. One has to understand 
what it means, which requires knowing how the particular 
set of information being visualized was selected and, from 
there, the designer’s point of view.
Information, even after it has been distilled from data, and 
even when it is “true,” has intention, interpretation, and often 
an agenda that has governed its selection: political, social, 
religious,  and “pack-everything-in” are examples of possible 
motivations behind an information graphic.
Many data sets and information designs, past and present, 
have been constrained by a lack of data, geographic or 
statistical, the other side of the mirror of many current “info­
graphics” that are overloaded with data just because it exists. 
It could be said that the task of information designers in the 
past—particularly cartographers—was to create “informa­
tion” where no data existed, and that the task of information 
designers today is to refine and reduce an overabundance of 
data into meaningful and usable information.
Information design, when successful—whether in print, on 
the web, or in the environment—represents the functional 
balance of the meaning of the information, the skills and 
inclinations of the designer, and the perceptions, education, 
experience, and needs of the audience. 
Often, these components are out of balance for any one or 
more of a number of reasons.
Data
•  The data are incomplete, skewed, or missing; or too gross in 
grain, oversimplified, or lacking in meaningful detail;
•  The data do not reveal their meaning because of lack of 
definition or misleading relationships within them;
•  The data are too dense, arcane, or technical to be trans­
formed into understandable information.
exhortations destroys what—
in the hands of a capable 
designer—might have been 
much better than terrible.
Chaos out of order. We are 
used to seeing ads like this in 
the automotive section of our 
newspaper (those of us who still 
read newspapers). Interestingly, 
this ad is comparatively well 
organized, but—not content 
to leave what might have been 
well enough alone—over­
crowding and a riot of fonts and

Indifference toward 
people and the 
reality in which 
they live is actually 
the one and only 
cardinal sin in 
design.
Dieter Rams
Unsuccessful design 
happens when:
• no one understands;
• no one cares;
• it’s not anyone’s job;
• some or all of the 
above.
Designer
•  The designer is unable to understand the meaning of—and 
therefore unable to distill and visualize—the data;
•  The designer is not adequately sensitive to human factors 
issues and may not be able to model the needs, abilities, and 
limitations of the audience;
•  The designer might be overly concerned with designing a 
visually compelling graphic, resulting in counter-intuitive or, 
worse, misleading or inaccurate design solutions.
Audience
•  The audience may be unable to understand the information 
because of lack of visual literacy or education, unfamiliarity 
with visual conventions of the subject, lack of specialized 
intelligence, lack of interest in the subject, or other factors.

Determining 
the appropriate 
content for the 
communication of 
information requires 
a rigorous process of 
examination: 
Is it true? 
Is it relevant? 
Is it necessary? 
Does its inclusion 
add or detract? 
Is it in a form that 
its audience can 
understand?
Intentional chaos. This “chart” 
of President Obama’s proposed 
health care system was released 
by the Republican side of the 
Joint Economic Committee on 
28 July 2010 (www.freerepublic
.com/focus/f-news/2650278/
posts), purporting to show 
“Obamacare’s bewildering com-
plexity.” It does not compare 
the plan’s complexity either 
with the existing health care 
structure nor to any proposal 
put forward by the Republicans 
in Congress. A good example 
of misinformation. (The legend 
has been deleted.)

Rev. Father F. N. Blanchet 
made first use of this “Catholic 
Ladder” in July 1842 at the 
Cowlitz Mission to teach the 
Indians the main truths of the 
Catholic faith. Many copies of 
the ladder were made and pre­
sented to the Indian chiefs.  
The 40 horizontal bars represent 
the 40 centuries BCE (when the 
world was declared by James 
Ussher to have been created in 
4004 BCE). The 33 dots repre­
sent the years of Christ’s life on 
earth. The 18 bars represent the 
18 centuries CE  and the 42 dots 
represent the 42 succeeding 
years.

both in actual numbers and in 
percentages, could be consis­

Non-wayfinding cartography
Left. The “T-in-O” map (so called 
for the letterforms created by 
the bodies of water and the 
surrounding ocean) is one of 
a large number of maps that 
emphasize theology over geog­
raphy. Based not on geographic 
ignorance, as occasionally 
thought, its intent was to sum­
marize a Christian world view in 
a simple and memorable form 
(not unlike Harry Beck’s iconic 
London Underground map of 
1931, which created a simple 
and memorable image of a 
complex movement network).
Although the map is shown as 
a flat disk for simplicity, it was 
well known that the earth is 
roughly spherical. Its construc­
tion is theologically governed: 
east is at the top, as it was 
believed that Paradise is to the 
east; Jerusalem is at the center; 
the three continents show the 
division of the world by the sons 
of Noah. 
I categorize non-wayfinding maps and diagrams into four 
basic categories:
1  Geographic (not illustrated on this spread): the most familiar 
type of maps, they represent space with geographic accu­
racy and at a constant scale. They are the predominant map 
type in most atlases. Included in this category are simplified 
geographic maps designed to make wayfinding and move­
ment networks more easily understandable.
2  Conceptual: these maps (and diagrams) may take extreme 
liberties with geography, or ignore it almost entirely, to 
describe or promote a concept or point of view. Many of 
these maps, especially in the past, when accurate geographic 
knowledge was incomplete at best, are often based on a 
theological or users’ affinity view of the world.
3	 Experiential (not illustrated on this spread), often diagram­
matic: how place and space are experienced, felt, measured, 
and perceived, often very different from geography. Each of 
us experiences space and time uniquely. Children’s percep­
tions of a place and the geographically distorted units of 
space and time experienced in transit travel with no visible 
geographic references are in this category.
4  Numerical/statistical: maps that adjust geography to reflect 
place-specific statistics. They are used to show change, 
relationships between and/or among places or political 
entities, and other numerical or statistical (non-geographic) 
comparisons.
	 Many maps and diagrams embody a combination of these 
categories.

Described by Edward R. Tufte 
as “the best statistical graphic 
ever drawn,“ Minard’s map has 
long been the subject of discus­
sion, analysis, and attempts to 
improve it. Some of these are 
shown in Section 6 of this book. 
The table below was retrofitted 
from the data in the Minard 
map and other sources. 
Although it is possible to order 
the table by date (as it is), by 
troop numbers, by geography, 
or by temperature (for the 
return), the table remains col­
umns of numbers—code.
A re-creation of the “executive 
summary” of Minard’s diagram.
This [the Minard map above] is 
one of the worst graphs ever made. 
[Tufte’s] very happy because it shows 
five different pieces of information 
on three axes and if you study it for 
fifteen minutes it really is worth a 
thousand words. I don’t think that’s 
what graphs are for. I think they 
try to make a point in two seconds 
for people who are too lazy to read 
the forty words underneath. And 
to make me spend fifteen minutes 
studying it doesn’t make sense….

Learning from Minard
Number

In The Visual Display of Quantitative Information (1983), 
Edward R. Tufte introduced the design community (and 
beyond) to Charles Joseph Minard’s 1869 graphic of Napo­
leon’s disastrous march to Moscow and back in the winter of 
1812–1813.
Minard’s map integrates four types of information design 
(and six categories):
1  Space (often used interchangeably with geography, to which 
it occasionally bears a resemblance). While simplified, Napo­
leon’s route maintains a consistent and accurate scale, with 
adequate geographic references.
2  Time (return only). Minard uses dates keyed to temperature 
to show both the speed at which distance was covered and 
temperature’s relationship to the staggering loss of troops.
3  Numbers—of troops and their relationship to place and tem­
perature. (The Réaumur temperature scale sets the freezing 
point of water at 0° and the boiling point at 80°.)
4	 Events. Troop strength and reinforcements; river crossings 
during the brutal winter, on the return, particularly at the 
River Bérézina. (Since that time, Bérézina has been used by 
the French as a synonym for disaster.)
Minard’s graphic has beome something of a self-perpet­
uating industry and continues to fascinate designers, 
information architects, information scientists, statisticians, 
teachers, and students; it is truly the 800-pound gorilla in the 
information design room.
Everyone needs to do a
“Minard,” it seems. This was
done by the author, who makes 
no claim to its superiority.
To ask for a map is 
to say, “Tell me a 
story.”
Peter Turchi 
The brilliance 
of Minard’s map 
is the ability to 
integrate and 
permit comparison 
of qualitative, 
quantitative, 
and geographic 
information in the 
same graphic.

Simple and complex
We have long been visualizing things that we cannot see, 
either because they are too small, too far away, or have 
working components that are enclosed. With the advent of 
the internet and the attendant proliferation, collection, and 
organization of data, we are now mapping and visualizing 
connections and relationships at an unprecedented rate. 
Many of these visualizations are extremely practical, and 
aid in understanding relationships within a complex site 
or organization. Others deal with unimaginably complex 
relationships among data, and their creation is aided—and 
impossible without—sophisticated computer applications.
Unfortunately, being able to visualize ungraspable relation­
ships does not necessarily make them more graspable. There 
comes a point where the data—whether it is visualized or 
listed—simply run into the limits of the human mind.
While computers expand their capacity at an exponen­
tial rate (Moore’s law—the number of transistors that can 
be placed inexpensively on an integrated circuit doubles 
approximately every two years), human beings do not evolve 
at the same rate. So we find ways of understanding the larger 
picture and its meaning. 
Many designers working with computers have pushed this 
genre of information design out of the realm of communi­
cation and into that of art. The algorithms they write have 
become the notational tools of visual information art, much 
as musical scores are the notational tools of aural art, permit­
ting their forms to be archived, revisited, and re-applied to 
new instruments, data, and ideas.

An example of a parking sign 
after the introduction of new 
regulations. The new regula­
tions required a vertical split 
because there was so much 
“information.” Some elements 
were unnecessary, such as the 
graphic of the contractors’  
placard: the contractors know 
what their placard looks like.
A digital mockup of the stu­
dents’ sign format applied to 
the same location. No vertical 
split and coded color for 
loading zones and payment 
information. Category headline 
treatments are typographically 
uniform, and there is a clear 
hierarchy of importance.
An example of a parking sign 
type in use prior to the introduc­
tion of new regulations. It wins 
no design prizes, with silly pic­
tograms, a lot of unneccessary 
rules, and an ambiguous use of 
figure-ground changes—but at 
least no vertical splits.

Worlds in collision
This is a story of a well-intentioned endeavor undone by 
its own inherent conflicts: on-street parking in downtown 
(“Center City”) Philadelphia.
When parking was relatively inexpensive (i.e., less expensive 
than garages), on-street parking was monopolized by com­
muters who ran out every few hours to feed the meter. Those 
who needed only short-term parking circled the block (pol­
luting the air) or used garages (with extremely high charges 
for the first hour) and got angry, resentful, and started shop­
ping and visiting services outside Center City.
New regulations were developed to mitigate this trend and 
to balance, to the extent possible, the parking needs of 
residents, workers, and visitors, as described in the caption 
at left.
The signs communicating parking regulations—even when 
those regulations were comparatively simple—were never 
examples of typographic excellence and clarity. When the 
new regulations, signs, and kiosks were implemented, the 
conflicts between communicating extremely complex infor­
mation, the context in which it operates, and the audience it 
is addressing became almost impossible—a perfect example 
of no good deed going unpunished.
The students’ solution, notwithstanding the unfortunate 
implementation that followed it, suggests that there are 
some conditions that are so difficult to communicate that 
a wholly satisfying design solution is likely to elude even 
the best designers. This was a revelation to them, as design 
students are often taught (and designers like to believe) that 
there is no design problem that cannot be solved well.
The answer is to collaboratively address the multiple aspects 
of the problem holistically, so that operations are brought 
more closely in line with the designer’s ability to commu­
nicate them in a particular context and the user’s ability to 
understand them.

There’s never 
enough time to do 
it right, but always 
enough time to do 
it over.
Printer’s saying
In 2008 the Philadelphia 
Parking Authority (PPA)
changed and complicated 
the parking game by intro­
ducing a more complex set of 
regulations than had previously 
existed, all in the city’s best 
parking interests:
•  Encourage full-day workers to 
use parking garages by raising 
the cost of street parking, 
thereby reducing traffic conges­
tion aggravated by parkers 
circling the block and polluting 
the air.
•  Increase the number of loading 
spaces and the specificity of 
contractors’ permit regulations.
•  Replace meters with kiosks, to 
accept credit and debit cards as 
well as cash and Authority pre-
paid cards.
•  [Presumably] communicate 
these regulations effectively.
The implementation of these 
objectives led to a multifold 
increase in the complexity 
of regulations needing to be 
communicated by signs, which 
now also had to identify the 
payment kiosks and explain 
their use.
Every silver lining has a cloud. 
Left. The PPA enthusiastically 
received the students’ solu­
tion. Their vendor kept asking 
them (and me) for fonts, 
which we kept sending. They 
never explained what their 
problem was or what they 
needed. So they just ignored 
the design. Like a plague, the 
bastardization of the students’ 
design continues to proliferate 
throughout the city. 
And sometimes there isn’t. 
Designed in a rush, the place­
ment of components and 
instructions appears to have 
been determined by engi­
neering expediency rather than 
by consideration of users’ needs.

This elegant and intriguing 
Venn diagram uses space effi­
ciently by layering, but relative 
quantities are difficult to ascer­
tain, and understanding the 
components requires memo­
rizing or looking back and forth 
at the legend.
This diagram is both simple and 
clear, particularly with regard 
to the volume of the drink and 
the proportions of each ingre­
dient. It follows the principle of 
information expansion, using 
two-dimensional space gener­
ously to avoid confusion and 
visual complexity. Unlike the 
layered graphic of the same 
information below, it does make 
seeing the overlap of ingredi­
ents abd their combination time 
consuming.

Dispersed vs. layered
How is the data 
best viewed? 
Each technique—
horizontal 
expansion or vertical 
expansion—offers 
its own advantages 
and disadvantages.
There is always a range of responses to visualizing given 
quantities and categories of information. Although both 
the page and the screen are two-dimensional planes, 
information can be visually layered by adding the illusion 
of three-dimensional space: in other words, substituting 
the illusion of volume for the “reality” of area—think of a 
sprawling ranch house compared to a triplex apartment 
with the same square footage. Another device is the illusion 
of transparency, which permits multiple notation types to 
be layered on top of each other in acknowledged two-
dimensional space—the fundamental premise of the Venn 
diagram, named for John (Donald A.) Venn (1834–1923).
Imagine a data set with three or four variables combined in 
most of their possible variations. The designer can visualize 
those combinations in two basic ways. One is to visualize 
each combination separately; the other is to create a multi­
variate Venn—provided the data subsets permit—in which 
transparency and pattern are used to layer different compo­
nents in a way that creates a compact but dense graphic. 
The trade-offs are straightforward. In the case of many sepa­
rate data subsets, each subset (combination of variables) is 
immediately understandable, but comparison among them 
can only be done one pair at a time. In the case of a layered 
diagram—a multidimensional Venn, so to speak—it is easy to 
see in which combinations each variable is used, but a sense 
of the whole and components of each data subset are more 
difficult to ascertain and compare. The diagram with sepa­
rated components uses two-dimensional space, repetition, 
and redundancy liberally; the Venn diagram with layering 
and transparency uses two-dimensional space efficiently but 
requires concentrated study.

complained about the semicir­

plug it up. 
Vignelli’s apocryphal response 
was that Americans might try 
emulating the more elegant 
Italian demitasse serving and 
not fill their cups to the brim.
Heller plugged it up anyway. 
Michael Bierut recalls that 
Vignelli described filling in the 
notch was like pulling the wings

The Anatomy Fallacy.
Frank H. Netter (1906–1991) has 
been called “Medicine’s Michelan­
gelo” by The New York Times. In a 
career spanning more than half a 
century he created thousands of 
anatomical and medical illustra­
tions that can be found in every 
medical school library.
Without in any way diminishing 
his accomplishment or dispar­
aging the importance of Netter’s 
work, his illustrations are an 
example of the illusion that if 
you know what something looks 
like you know how it works (and, 
presumably, how to use it and 
how to fix it). 
Anatomy is important to physi­
cians in the same way that 
geography is important to 
infantry in a foreign country. But 
anatomical exactness is not nec­
essarily helpful in explaining how 
the heart works, how it interacts 
with the lungs, and how it feeds 
other major parts of the body.
In the sequence of these dia­
grams, the diagram at the top 
came first: it really is the way the 
heart works— a completely cir­
cular system. This clearer diagram 
of the heart’s function, however, 
was felt by the designer to be too 
unfamiliar for a lay audience.
The final diagram used in the 
book. The yellow circle high­
lights the right pulmonary vein 
as it enters the left atrium. In 
virtually all dimensionalized 
illustrations, this route and its 
connection is hidden by ana­
tomical information physically 
in front of it. 
This is the first concept for a 
functional diagram for a book 
on the heart. It was eventually 
replaced by the diagram below, 
which offered a vocabulary that 
could easily be adapted for mul­
tiple diagrams of heart function 
by turning layers on and off.
This diagram, and the version 
on the cover, are anatomically 
inaccurate, as de-oxygenated 
blood goes out to the lungs and 
oxygenated blood out to the 
body from the top of the heart, 
not the bottom; it is is, however,  
functionally accurate.
The cover illustration is further 
anatomically abstracted in 
homage to Harry Beck’s London 
Underground map.

Anatomy and function
Anatomical illustrations and geographic maps both show the 
physical appearance of things: anatomy of the body and the 
geography of the physical world. But anatomical illustrations 
do not show how the body works, and geographic maps 
do not explain how a place is experienced or a movement 
network used. How bodies and environments work are an 
entirely different matter.
In anatomical illustrations you see veins, arteries, bones, 
muscles, ligaments; in geographic maps, rivers, streams, 
streets and highways, athletic fields, cemeteries. There is a 
great deal of information to be gained from this detail—
especially if you are about to perform open-heart surgery 
or plan a highway or residential development or just a long 
walk. Sometimes, anatomical or geographic fidelity can actu­
ally mask important elements of the subject.
But how do impulses from the brain carried by the nerves 
keep your heart beating? How will the capacity of an urban 
infrastructure need to be increased to accommodate new 
development? What’s going on inside the box in a diagram 
of a rocket ship labeled “engine”? For this information—
about function rather than appearance—you need a way of 
looking at things that reveals how they work.
Our circulatory system is like one big train network, like the 
ones many of us played with as children: our heart is the 
roundhouse and pumping stations, from which the trains—
blood molecules—are dispatched; our lungs are the fueling 
stations; our upper and lower body are the destinations. 
Below. Artist Christine Zelinsky 
used black to indicate the walls of 
the heart (1980s). Below center, 
George Giusti reverses the con­
vention, using the intuitive colors 
of red and blue to differentiate 
between arterial and venous 
blood (1962).
This diagram, typical of 
dimensionalized diagram­
matic illustrations of the heart, 
obscures many of the connec­
tions between the pulmonary 
veins and arteries and the 
heart. The final diagram we 
developed for The Heart is able 
to show all those connections 
and details by creating the 
diagram two dimensionally 
so that nothing is obscured by 
anatomy.

Don’t confuse 
knowing what

Metaphor and simile
Richard Saul Wurman’s deceptively obvious statement reveals 
an understanding of human factors that is as accurate as it is 
simple. I grew up with diagrams in encyclopedias (labeled, for 
example, “engine,” “cockpit”) that taught as much about the 
function of the object diagrammed and its parts as a pho­
tograph of the outside of a car explains the workings of the 
internal combustion engine. The workings of the human body 
are a combination of rail transit maps (when it’s working) and 
Star Wars, the movies as well as the Strategic Defense Initia­
tive (when it’s not). Most of us are actually more familiar with 
battles in space than we are with the functions and processes 
of our own body. But we can use much of the familiarity we 
have to transfer information to things with which we are much 
less familiar.
Metaphor provides the opportunity to perceive the function of 
many disparate things as parallel and related.
Using metaphor and simile to show how different parts of 
our body work without resorting to anatomical drawing is a 
problem I have been assigning my students in design for many 
years, as it encourages them to think about how things work 
and to visualize functions rather than appearances.

Less than meets the eye. This

show where important com­
ponents are located relative to 
each other, but they are labeled 
as “black box” objects and there 
is no information about how 
anything works and virtually 
no information about what 
they look like. I remember being 
frustrated by these so-called 
diagrams when I was in elemen­

understanding.
The relationships among words, images, and numbers are  
complex and protean, as there are ways for each to support 
and enhance, or discredit and contradict, the other. 
Clear and powerful images often need little or no accom­
panying text to make their point. In such cases, a picture is 
worth not just 1,000 words but in fact can soar emotionally 
well beyond them. Symbols, associated with good or evil, 
learned through narrative and history, can communicate 
through experience and memory. 
The best and most communicative images and symbols are 
simple and direct—whether pictorial, symbolic, or numer­
ical—without extraneous elements that reduce their power 
or make them difficult to remember.
Emotional power
The many photographs, docu­
ments, and symbols from the 
Holocaust so overwhelm 
rational processing that their 
casual use is deadening. I 
include it as an example of the 
possibilities of word-free com­
munication and the power of 
icons associated with images of 
the world’s most powerful and 
most unsettling events.
Ohrdruf-Nord. German civilians 
were brought from the town of 
Ohrdruf to exhume the bodies 
from a mass grave at Ohrdruf-
Nord concentration camp 
and rebury them in individual 
graves. General Patton wrote 
that he suggested that the rest 
of the inhabitants of Ohrdruf 
be brought to the camp to view 
the bodies, and that the army 
had “used the same system 
in having the inhabitants of 
Weimar go through the even 
larger slave camp [Buchenwald] 
north of that town.” In this 
photo, General Eisenhower 
can be seen in the center back­
ground, wearing a cap rather 
than a helmet.
French cigarette packages 
graphically and typographi­
cally warn smokers about the 
dangers of smoking. The front 
reads: “Smoking is gravely 
harmful to your health and the 
health of those around you.” 
The back reads: “Smoking can 
lead to a slow and miserable 
death.” And in case that’s not 
clear, there’s a picture….
Whether the U.S. government 
has the right to require photo­
graphs like these on packages 
of cigarettes sold in this country 
is, as of June 2012, making its 
way through the courts.

This envelope was sent to me by

This envelope and false “infor­

This ad—one of a seemingly

it’s impossible to tell whether it 
qualifies as misinformation.

How often has each of us received communications by mail 
and, now, by e-mail, with one or more of the hyperbolic 
phrases at the right? (And that doesn’t include the oppor­
tunity to help a person liberate millions of dollars in an

Advertising and promotions are as American as apple pie; 
but misleading sales promotions, false catch lines, and unin­
tentional ambiguity masquerading as real information are 
something different. The appropriate use of language is one 
of the bastions of civil discourse, and it is always disheart­
ening to see it abused, especially in politics.
Equally troubling is the deliberately imprecise use of lan­
guage in order to imply that the subject, service, or item 
under discussion is particularly successful or worthwhile. 
Often, as in the example shown on the facing page, the 
assertion is not necessarily untrue (although I wonder about 
how the data were gathered and interpreted) but meaning­
less nonetheless.

Branding, brand building, brand awareness, and brand loy­
alty have become increasingly important in selling products, 
services, and corporate cultures. Successful branding and the 
communication of information are not necessarily mutually 
reinforcing, however. And I’m not sure why the “brand aware­
ness” of a transit operator is important: the user needs to 
recognize that there is transit, not necessarily the brand of its 
operating entity. There usually isn’t a lot of choice.
While a reasonably coherent vocabulary of symbols has 
evolved for bathrooms the world over, public transit 
networks are still using a wide range of marks to brand 
themselves and/or to communicate the presence of  transit 
service.
•  Some operating entities—as in Paris and Boston—separate 
their corporate name from a more universal letterform 
symbol that connotes transit (RATP and “M” for “Métro” in 
Paris, and MBTA and “T” for “Transit” in Boston).
•  Some—as in Philadelphia and San Francisco—use a letter­
form mark for their brand (“S” for “SEPTA” and “ba” for “BART,” 
respectively, that have no intrinsic connotation of transit).
•  Some—as in Atlanta—use a logomark that may suggest 
transit, or at least movement—integrated with the operating 
entity’s logotype, or—in the case of San Francisco’s Muni 
network—a logotype only.
As discussed on pages 130–131, marks, logomarks, logo­
types, and pictograms that inherently allude to the service 
being referenced—in this case, transit—will be inherently 
more immediately understandable to a visitor who has no 
reason to know the name or logo of the operating entity.

Qualitative
Issues
Perceptions, conventions, proximity
By understanding how things work, you can start 
to think about improving them.
Maurice Kanbar
By understanding why things don’t work, you can 
figure out how to design them so that they do.

The original engineering 
drawing on which the illustra­
tions below are based. 
This highway map fragment 
triples the number of lines 
necessary to indicate the actual 
roads, and makes it difficult to 
discern what is road and what 
is void.
Clarity is enhanced by making 
the roads white on a neutral 
field, as we tend to equate lighter 
values with openness and path­
ways.
Replacing outlines with paths 
whose thickness approximates 
the relative road widths vastly 
simplifies reading and, with 
the use of shadows, clarifies 
roadway level.
The roads’ direction is clarified 
by separating the roads that run 
in one direction from the roads 
that run in the opposite direc­
tion, notwithstanding the roads’ 
physical—or geographic— 
adjacency.

One line
Three lines: two boundaries and a path
Lines
Make every mark 
count.
Dennis Kuronen 
Notational 
complexity almost 
always results 
in informational 
inefficiency.
The line has three functions:
•  as the definition of an edge or boundary of an area or object 
(a container of space);
•  as a connection or pointer from one object to another (or 
from an object to its label);
•  as a linear element, such as a road or trackage, in maps and 
diagrams, connoting something that we know has width but 
whose function is one dimensional.
In this last context, lines used as the boundary of a linear 
element are to some extent a vestige of the past, when 
shapes, bands, and solids were all defined by bounding lines 
because of the difficulty of reproducing tone. This conven­
tion is no longer necessary and has never been particularly 
effective or elegant.
Almost all engineering drawings of roads, and altogether too 
many maps for the general public, render a road—which is 
a path—with three lines: the two bounding lines and the 
band between them. The result is the creation of three lines 
to represent one. As shown in the example below, this makes 
our eyes and brain do extra work to determine which is the 
figure and which is the ground, and to discern one road or 
path from another.
Lines are not always the enemy.  There are occasions 
where lines serve to differentiate between areas (including 
linear map elements) that are confusingly close in hue, 
value, chroma, or some combination of the three. In these 
instances, boundary lines can be helpful, even necessary, 
provided that they do not assume a life of their own.

Simpler is better. The top three

The use of line in many maps 
of streets, highways, and rail 
lines—while necessary for engi­
neers—are often ported over 
without adjustment to maps 
intended for the rest of us. This

issues potentially leading to 
ambiguity.

Unintended consequences of shape
Intellectually logical 
coding—as in the 
example on the 
facing page—is 
often perceptually 
counterintuitive. 
What may seem 
rational to the 
academician may 
be perceived 
incorrectly or with 
difficulty by the 
user. 
See also Connotations of color; 
Color and monochrome.
The illustration on the facing page represents a classic 
example of what can happen when a perfectly intelligent 
person sets out to visualize data without being able to 
perceive the consequences of his work.
In this example, the vertical measurement of each triangle 
represents distance or depth and the horizontal base repre­
sents a period of time. When you connect the three points 
they make a triangle. That’s different. 
A triangle defines an area, and a comparison of triangles sug­
gests that there is meaning in their proportions and areas: 
a wide, short triangle should intuitively connote something 
different than a narrow, tall triangle. But in this case that 
is untrue: the proportion and size of the triangles mean 
nothing, a clear case of unintentional misrepresentation. 
The meaning of the dimensions in this graphic—the width 
of the base and the height of the “drop”—are confused and 
rendered meaningless by the differences in size and propor­
tion of the triangles.
Academics don’t always have access to designers. They have 
graduate students and Excel. In any particular area of study 
they tend to use similar and familiar (to each other) notation 
(often the result of using the same, very basic, graphic soft­
ware). As a result they understand each other’s visualizations. 
Apart from their colleagues, however, these visualizations are 
often confusing and difficult for everyone else to understand. 
Shapes generate their own interpretive meaning regardless 
of the intentions behind them.
Left. In this graphic, the arche­
ologist’s graduate student fell 
into the trap of connecting 
the three pertinent points of a 
stroke and a point to make a tri­
angle. In reality, the two points 
that define the horizontal stroke 
represent a period of time 
during which the artifact was 
built or made. The height of the 
triangle represents the distance 
above the contemporaneous 
lagoon level that the artifact 
would have been. The connec­
tion of the horizontal timeline 
and the “drop” to presumed 
lagoon level creates a triangle, 
a visually powerful shape that 
has no relationship to the data 
and confuses the reading of the 
graphic. 
Left. This redesign of the 
original, in addition to its 
helpful use of color, avoids the 
problem of misleading shapes. 
The use of a vertical line con­
nects the bar­—which clearly 
shows height above lagoon 
level and timeframe—to the 
target at which the artifact was 
found. Those targets, unlike the 
triangle apexes in the original, 
define a conventional scatter 
point array that shows the rise 
of the lagoon for 2,000 years.

insufficencies and oversufficien­

atric Nephrology Symposium.
The graphs were intended 
to help physicians explain to 
parents the difficulties that 
the kidneys of their new­
borns—especially premature 
newborns—were experiencing. 
Among themselves, the 
nephrologists used a different 
notation that would be difficult  
for parents to understand.

A nutritional food wheel by stu­

everything that has never

The use of a pie chart visually

and does not imply that one 
category of food is superior to 
another;
Subcategories of the five major

could be used when shopping 
and/or posted on the refrig­
erator, is included to help users 
plan a well-balanced weekly 
diet;
Recognizing that portion size 
varies greatly between indi­
viduals of different sizes, habits, 
and metabolism, portion size is 
not emphasized.
Peter Bradford, in a project for 
American Health magazine, set 
out to define a calorie in under­
standable terms, rather than as 
an approximation of the energy 
needed to increase the tem­
perature of 1 kilogram of water 
by 1 °C. Learning that a calorie 
is composed of carbohydrate, 
protein, and fat, but in different 
proportions depending on the 
food, Bradford used this simple 
and clear pie chart to communi­
cate calories in a useful way.

See also The pyramid paradox.
The top of a pyramid has always represented—historically 
and connotationally—both small quantity and great impor­
tance: one king and lots of slaves; one lord and lots of serfs; a 
unique and expensive diamond on a pile of costume jewelry. 
In every food pyramid, or triangle—first developed by the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture in 1992—one of those two 
linked connotations is reversed. The top of the pyramid 
represents the category of foods that you should eat least of 
(only one pharaoh) but also the least healthy rather than the 
most. The 2005 UDSA “My Pyramid” eliminates that conflict 
by making the pyramidal shape completely meaningless.
In June 2011 the USDA unveiled with some fanfare a food 
“plate,” almost as vacuous as its pyramids. It cost $2,000,000 
to develop and provides very little information. As discussed 
elsewhere, circles are not the best shapes for quantitative 
comparisons. Comparing four pie non-wedges without a 
common center, and then comparing those to a full circle, 
is not only imprecise but silly. Allowing for the fact that 
the distribution of these food groups is deliberately gen­
eralized—each individual has unique needs and caloric 
requirements—the plate seems not to offer much guidance 
or room for individualized application. Dairy is outside the 
plate (representing a glass of blue milk seen in plan). Try 
comparing the area of a circle to that of an irregularly pro­
portioned quarter-circle.
The 1995 pyramid, linked to a 
USDA website, with no informa­
tion at this level.
The original 1992 pyramid.
The $2,000,000 food plate, hardly 
an improvement. The descrip­
tion of the five food groups in the 
new plate is also not coherent. 
“Proteins” represents a source of 
calories, such as carbs or sugars. 
Fruits, vegetables, grains, and 
dairy are food categories (and not 
all dairy is drinkable, as the repre­
sentation of a glass implies). So, 
what are the sources of proteins? 
Meat, fish, fowl: food categories.
The nutritional food label 
in the United States lists the 
percentage supplied that is rec­
ommended in one day based on 
a 2,000-calorie daily diet.
A project at the University of 
California, Berkeley, School 
of Journalism, undertook to 
design a better food label. 
These are two examples of the 
winning entry by San Francisco 
designer Renee Walker. The 
label visually shows the propor­
tion of each ingredient in the 
food product. One hopes that 
the labels will be considered by 
the U.S. Food and Drug Admin­
istration, which is expected to 
revise the existing nutrition 
label.

Color can modify—
and possibly even 
contradict—our 
intuitive response 
to value, because of 
its own powerful 
connotations. 
The best one can 
do is to understand 
how we perceive 
line, value, and 
color; to know 
what they connote; 
and to balance 
complementary 
and/or contradictory 
connotations in 
support of user 
needs.
The middle value principle
Value, like color and typeface, has connotation: we respond, 
intuitively, to the lightness and darkness of things, specifically 
in maps. 
Differentiation in value of things that are like or unlike aids in 
our intuitive perception of what they represent.
In any map, there are things we pass through or move along: 
streets and roads; paths; rivers and canals. Within these cat­
egories, we move along some (highways, streets) faster than 
along others (hiking trails).
There are things we cannot pass through (except through 
doors and gates): buildings and walls.
And there are things that are neutral: we can move around 
in them, perhaps, but we may not want to, or they may not 
necessarily be designed for that: background; unassigned 
open space; lawns; woods; bodies of water.
If that neutral background is a middle value in a map, then 
the open movement corridors and the dark impenetrable 
objects are as unlike each other as possible in value, both a 
rational and pragmatic consideration.
See also Lines; Color and monochrome.
With a neutral background, 
light paths and roads intuitively 
connote the possibility of move­
ment; dark shapes suggest 
building masses. In life, as in art, 
the two things most unlike each 
other are as distinct from each 
other as possible.
In this transposition of values, 
it is intuitively difficult to sense 
what shapes represent what.
In this version, the white 
building shapes appear as holes 
in the darker fields.
This campus map correctly indi­
cates buildings as the darkest 
value but misses the boat with 
its use of line and lack of dif­
ferentiation between roads and 
background.

Vignelli corrected the 1972

in Section 5.
The  counterintuitive palette in 
the two hearts at near right and 
center right, discussed on pages 
30–31, demonstrates the pitfalls 
of using color arbitrarily when 
longstanding and universally 
understood and accepted color 
conventions exist. Without labels 
or a legend, there is no way for a 
general audience to understand 
which color represents arterial 
blood and which venous. The 
diagram on the right, notwith­
standing the obvious liberties 
taken with anatomy, will be 
understood, even without labels, 
by many.

Connotations of color 
We all know that grass is green and water is blue. Most of us 
know that arterial, oxygenated blood is described as “red,” 
and that venous blood, lacking oxygen, is described as “blue.” 
Good cowboys wore white hats and outlaws wore black hats.
How do we know? 
In the case of the first example—grass and water—simply 
from observation. Grass is not always green, of course: in 
times of drought, and in winter, it verges on brown.
In the case of the second example­—blood—we learned 
these conventions in middle school biology and have seen 
them in medical illustrations. While we have never actually 
observed “blue,” deoxygenated blood, we recognize it from 
the bluish cast of veins close to the surface of our skin.
The natural world around us and our own bodies are 
examples of color conventions making sense, and where 
distortions of those conventions can be confusing and 
unsettling.
Functional conventions—conventions that have a func­
tional reason for existing—make our lives easier, and bridge, 
through a shared visual vocabulary, communication barriers 
of concept and language.

The iconic Vignelli map of the 
New York subway system of 
1972, far left, aroused a fire­
storm of protest. Harry Beck’s 
equally diagrammatic London 
Underground map had at that 
time been in use for 40 years. 
The intensity of the pushback 
surprised many and caused the 
MTA to withdraw and replace 
the map within three years. The 
map quickly became a cause 
célèbre and is still the subject 
of articles and discussion 40 
years later.
There is an apocryphal story 
that New Yorkers were par­

used beige for the water and 
gray for the parks. Near left is

Right. Look at the two columns 
of color. Close your eyes and 
try to name them all. Chances 
are you will be better able to

of the colors and the colors 
themselves in the left column. 
At a very early age we learned

Bidirectional color consistency: 
in the Paris Métro, each line 
is represented by a(n almost)
unique color and that color 
is never used anywhere 
else (except twice). While it 
contradicts many of the con­
siderations described in the 
text, it deals creatively with the 
problem of needing too many 
colors for easy identification 
and recollection. 
I once was told to take the “dark 
green line,” (the 12) but it was by 
a typically obsessive informa­
tion designer.
Unidirectional color 
consistency. In this plan­
ning study for downtown 
Geneva, Switzerland—Étude 
d’Aménagement—any 
repeating category in the book’s 
48 maps is always represented 
by the same color, even though 
that color may also be used for 
different categories in other 
maps.
A contextually ideal solution, 
the set of billiards balls: two 
groups are distinguished by a 
combination of unidirectional 
and bidirectional color/shape 
coding, which also respects 
humans’ color recognition and 
retention limitations. Only one 
possible improvement: making 
the “8” white on the black field 
with a white outline to distin­
guish it from both sets.

In the technological world that means your monitor can

In the real world that means between little and nothing.

Therefore, in the human world—as opposed to the techno­

Ideally, a color will mean the same thing whenever it is used 
(bidirectional consistency). If the data set requires more 
coded colors than can be easily differentiated, every color 
should be used consistently, although used for different, 
non-redundant things in different color subsets (unidirec­
tional consistency).
A few considerations to make coded color choices as effec­
tive as possible:
•  Use colors that are clearly distinguishable from each other;
•  Use colors with simple, familiar, universally used, and easily 
remembered names and associations;
•  If you use colors of similar value, type color/value can be the 
same on all backgrounds (unlike in the Paris métro);
•  Be aware of the “danger,”  “caution,” and prohibitory connota­
tion of certain colors;
•  Disregard any of the above if using them will compromise 
the effectiveness of the solution for the greatest number of 
people in the greatest number of contexts;
•  Consider the color blind (about 8% of males, 0.5% of females) 
to the extent possible;
•  Context is extremely important: choosing, recognizing, and 
remembering colors do not happen in a vacuum.
Color constraints
The Ishihara Color Test is a 
color perception test for red-
green color deficiencies named 
after its designer, Dr. Shinobu 
Ishihara, a professor at the 
University of Tokyo, who first 
published his tests in 1917. 
The test consists of a number 
of colored plates, each of 
which contains a circle of dots 
appearing randomized in color 
and size. Within the pattern are 
dots which form a number vis­
ible to those with normal color 
vision and invisible, or difficult 
to see, for those with a red-
green color vision defect. 
A grid purporting to represent 
the 16,000,000+ colors rendered 
by a 24-bit color monitor. It’s 
all well and good to say—even 
to prove—that all 16,000,000+ 
colors are there, but why does 
it matter if one can’t tell them 
all apart?

54
Pattern permits layering. 
While opaque colors cover up 
the colors that are beneath 
them and transparent colors 
mix with the colors beneath 
them, pattern permits multiple, 
overlapping designations to be 
perceived simultaneously, as in 
this delightful map of Scandi­
navia, designed for Champion 
Papers Imagination XV Scandi­
navia Paper Showcase in 1971

color to grayscale.
The resources available with black-and-white—grayscale—
are vastly more constrained than with color.
Turning a color image into grayscale tends to work well only 
with photography and not always then: the way we perceive 
the limited palette of grays makes it impossible to preserve 
the differentiation made possible by differences in hue and 
chroma offered by color. A grayscale palette offers us only 
value with which to work.
For examples of pattern and issues of value differentiation in 
practice, see the next page. Pattern, often misused or exces­
sively used, can, used effectively, compensate for many of 
the differentiations afforded by hue and chroma.
Options for differentiation in 
color, grayscale, and black-and-
white.
Color can determine life and 
death, illustrated by the arche­
typal so-called proof of Darwin’s 
concept of natural selection in the 
case of the peppered moth by Ber­
nard Kettlewell in the 1950s.
"A dark variety of the otherwise 
light-colored peppered moth 
appeared in England in the 
mid-nineteenth century and its 
numbers continued to grow in 
the industrial areas of England. 
Kettlewell set out to show experi­
mentally that the dark variety 
of moth prospered because it 
was better camouflaged against 
the soot-darkened, lichen-free 
tree trunks in industrial areas. 
He released light and dark pep­
pered moths onto tree trunks in 
the polluted forests. He not only 
recaptured…proportionately 
more dark moths than light 
moths, but also observed birds 
feeding predominantly on the 
light moths. He obtained exactly 
the opposite results in an unpol­
luted forest with much lighter tree 
trunks. He concluded that natural 
selection via bird predation in 
polluted forests was causing pep­
pered moth populations to evolve 
from the light to the dark variety."
Craig Holdrege, director of The 
Nature Institute (Ghent, NY), real­
ized in the 1980s that peppered 
moths don’t rest on trees. It turns 
out that Kettlewell actually placed 
moths on trees in a vastly higher 
proportion than would normally 
occur, encouraging birds to feed 
on them in the way but not for the 
reason that his results described.

This pair of maps clearly 
demonstrates the danger of 
not adjusting an information 
graphic designed in color when 
converting to grayscale. The 
diagram at the top appeared 
on the newspaper’s website, 
where differentiation among 
colors made the categories 
clear. In the printed newspaper, 
the same graphic appeared in 
grayscale, otherwise unaltered, 
which largely destroyed the dif­
ferentiation between two of the 
three categories of information.
Below. A detail of another map 
on the same subject, which used 
shape and the clearly visible 
differences between black and 
white to show two categories of 
data distinctly.
From color to grayscale
Pattern­—usually a second- or third-tier option in graphics 
where full color is available—becomes a valuable asset when 
working within the constraints of grayscale.
There is a significant difference between originating an 
information graphic in color and then having to adapt it to 
monchrome, and thinking of it in monochrome from the 
very beginning. It is a natural human tendency to translate 
from color to monochrome by doing the equivalent of the
 “desaturate” command in Photoshop; but it often—perhaps
 usually—doesn’t work. There are too many nuances of differ­
entation that are likely to be expressed by variations in hue 
and chroma to translate successfully into a monochrome 
palette without a certain amount of reflection and experi­
mentation (because patterns have connotations, too).
Facing page. The use of color 
enhances distinctions that 
require alternative strategies 
when confined to black-and-
white or grayscale, as shown by 
converting the color diagram to 
grayscale, whether with dark or 
light background.

Generations of labeling
If you have no room 
for first-generation 
labeling, you may 
be trying to fit too 
much information 
in too small a space.
See also The middle value 
principle.
The identification of a visual element is easier to understand 
the closer it is to the object being identified. As obvious as 
this “law of proximity” sounds, it is not always practiced for 
one of any number of reasons: indifference, carelessness, or 
the designer’s idea of visual and typographic elegance. The 
only semi-valid reason for the practice of labeling distant 
from the object it is identifying is the absence of adequate 
real estate. In this case the designer would do well to look at 
the number of elements she is trying to fit into the available 
space. Numbers, letters, and words must all be decoded to 
be understood: the closer the name, designator, or related 
information is to the object being identified the better.
Not unlike genealogical relationships, labeling can be 
thought of in generations:
•  First-generation labeling labels the object on or at the object.
•  Second-generation labeling connects the object to its label, 
which may be some distance away, with, for example, a 
callout rule. The clearer the relationship of the label to the 
object­—and the fewer callout rule crossings—the clearer the 
identification will be.
•  Third-generation labeling uses code—alphanumeric or sym­
bolic—that requires the user to repeatedly look, remember, 
and search to match codes and make the connection 
between label and object. Often, in practice, the legend is far 
away from the subject, sometimes even on another page.
Another example of broken connections occurs in books 
where an image is disconnected from the text is it refer­
enced by, either because of sloppy design or, more often, 
the economic publishing necessity of grouping high-quality, 
full-color images in their own signature, dozens or even 
hundreds of pages away from their textual reference. This, 
of course, is disruptive both to the flow of text and to the 
contextual connection of text and image. One of the great 
potential of books adapted for the screen is the ability to 
transcend the constraints of printing on paper and put 
high-quality illustrations with their references in the text. The 
ideal condition, on screen as well as in print, is for all related 
elements to be in close proximity to each other.

Human beings are social animals. We are connected to each 
other through affection, family, emotion, money, and power. 
Through history, many of those connections have been 
devious, illegal, clandestine, and deadly. Detailing those 
relationships—not unlike decoding the human genome 
on a vastly smaller scale—has been (especially clandestine 
relationships) an exhausting labor of love and law by many 
designers and artists over many centuries. In doing so, they 
have developed notations specific to the complexities and 
nature of the relationships under exploration.

It is impossible 
to know what 
the designer of 
unintentionally 
misleading or 
confusing graphics 
was thinking. It 
may be the result 
of a desire for 
visual elegance, 
uniformity, or 
misplaced notions 
of simplicity and 
visual harmony, 
which unfortunately 
mitigate self-
revealing ease of 
use. It is crucial to 
think about how the 
user will understand 
the design.
Since braille markers for elevator buttons became mandatory 
in 1990 with the passge of the Americans with Disabilities 
Act (ADA), elevator panels had to be retrofitted or rede­
signed to comply with this requirement. In most cases in 
my experience, braille markers have been added adjacent 
to the buttons that actually work. In some cases, these small 
plaques replaced existing floor numbers; in others, they 
appear to have been added adjacent to the actual buttons.
Making connections between objects and their labels, or 
between explanatory text and the objects or parts of objects 
they reference, is serious business, with the consequence for 
doing it badly being a high level of annoyance or worse.
Generally, making appropriate connections in products and 
other objects, such as instrumentation, is taken quite seri­
ously: heavy equipment control panels and airplane cockpits 
are examples. Often, however, where the user is the general 
public, or where the consequences factor is perceived as 
small, common sense seems not to be applied or even 
considered.

Consistent and mnemonic notation
The value of consistent notation is well known for the 
design of groups of statistical graphs, many of which have 
similar data categories. Like unidirectional color consistency 
described on page 52, it helps a user to have data categories 
similarly coded in multiple data sets.
In many publications—where the author cannot afford a 
designer or recognize the need for one—many graphs are 
(non-)designed by Excel or another spreadsheet applica­
tion. These applications arbitrarily assign color, line weight, 
pattern, and other characteristics without regard to meaning, 
context, or offering the user the ability to change them. As 
the number and names of data categories change from 
graph to graph, it is almost guaranteed that the color used 
for a particular data category will also change from graph to 
graph within what is supposed to be a unified set.
As we have discussed, many colors have connotations. In 
graphing an investment portfolio, gold, silver, and green 
come readily to mind. More important is the repetition of 
one color connoting the same thing over and over again. 
Such consistency and appropriateness will make sets of 
color-coded information easier to understand and connect.
In this set of grayscale graphs for an analysis of 100 years of 
census data, we were given data as both tables and as Excel 
graph output. The set of graphs had certain recurring data 
categories, particularly race and gender. 
Consequently, it made both intellectual and intuitive sense 
for white persons to be shown by white lines and black per­
sons to be shown by black lines, and for males and females 
to be shown consistently (our choice of a solid line for males 
and a dashed line for females was arbitrary). In order to 
avoid the need for a legend, in keeping with our ideas about 
generations of identification (pages 58–59), we labeled the 
lines on the lines themselves, adding a white or black male/
female symbol for easier identification, especially where lines 
crossed or were close together.
Using the middle value principle (pages 48–49) permitted 
white and black lines to represent white and black persons, 
respectively, and in other graphs deep gray lines represented 
Latinos and other “brown” ethnic groups.
These are the symbols used 
by Consumer Reports for its 
product ratings. The open red 
circle on the left is their lowest 
rating; the closed black circle on 
the right is their highest rating; 
the open circle in the center is 
neutral.
This symbol set is counterintui­
tive in several ways:
• While red-green is usually clear 
for stop-go and, presumably, 
bad-good (except for the color 
blind), red-black for bad-good 
(without green) may not be uni­
versally clear.
• There is no clear intuitive  pro­
gression from bad to good; the 
empty circle just looks empty, 
and is likely to have a negative 
rather than a “product neutral” 
connotation.
• The “very bad” symbol has 
an open center and the “very 
good” is solid—is that for the 
color-blind? If so, why red-black 
at all?
Below are two proposals for a 
notationally consistent, mne­
monically positive, color-blind 
neutral solution, similar to the 
symbol set used­ but certainly 
not first or uniquely—in 20 
American Cities in 1967. A 
clear and easy-to-remember 
progressive value system clearly 
differentiates empty (bad) 
from full (good) and the steps 
in between. Because it is line 
art and does not require gray 
values or a halftone screen, it 
is color and technology inde­
pendent.

A conventional analog train 
schedule, 2011. 
In the 1880s, Etienne-Jules 
Marey, a French engineer and 
photographer, developed this 
schedule for trains from Paris 
to Lyon. Edward Tufte writes, in 
The Visual Display of Quantita­
tive Information: “Arrivals and 
departures from a station are 
located along the horizontal 
[x-axis]; length of stop at a sta­
tion is indicated by the length of 
the horizontal line. The stations 
are separated in proportion 
to their actual distance apart. 
The slope of the line reflects the 
speed of the train…. The inter­
section of two lines locates the 
time and place that trains going 
in opposite directions pass each 
other.”
Tufte has superimposed on 
Mary’s schedule a line, shown in 
red, describing the time path of 
the TGV (train à grande vitesse) 
that began service in 1981.

and divisions as shall lay the

It’s about time
It is no accident that “family” and “familiar” come from similar 
Latin roots. 
History is full of designs that met resistance, if not outright 
rejection, when they were introduced because they were 
innovative—­unfamiliar­—­in some fundamental way. Many 
of these innovative ways of describing space and time, and 
communicating process or statistical information, are now 
part of the history and conventional vocabulary of informa­
tion design. Some are not.
All new designs, regardless of their “superiority” in terms of 
efficiency, accuracy, or multivariacy (Marey’s schedule visu­
ally describes the speed of each train as a bonus, something 
impossible in a traditional train schedule), are often resisted 
and evaluated poorly until their positive aspects are under­
stood and widely adopted.

Point of view
Point of view is attitudinal as well as physical. The former 
represents a way of looking at things, a way of thinking about 
looking at things, and then finding a way to implement and 
express those thoughts about looking.
Looking at three-dimensional physical things, particularly 
buildings, has evolved into a rational three-dimensional 
system, using plan, elevation, and section to reveal a great 
deal of how it is built or works. The more plans, the more 
elevations, and (especially) the more sections, the more 
complete the two-dimensional reconstruction of a three-
dimensional building or object will be.

and acquire information on the screen via the web; books  
are staying pretty much the way they’ve been for hundreds 
of years. This ongoing revolution in technology has rami- 
fications.
Books are a comparatively mature medium of communica-
tion, and almost everyone knows how to find their way 
around in them; the screen, a fairly recent medium of com-
munication, is undergoing rapid and continual change, in 
some cases at a rate that the human mind finds difficult to 
keep up with.
As websites explore new ways of organizing access to and 
distributing information, they often stumble in their naviga-
tional structure. This might be best described as “I’ve fallen in 
and I can’t get out,” an analogy for not knowing where you 
are and how to move around as you go deeper into a site. 
Oddly enough, some of the characteristics of the web (as a 
source) and the screen (as a medium) are the very qualities 
that can make navigation difficult. On a website, the user 
views one screen at a time (allowing for scrolling). She can 
go backwards; or forwards; or skip around­, but, even with 
a site map, she cannot easily and efficiently flip through 
the site, the way a reader can flip forwards and backwards 
through a book she is reading.
This is certainly not to suggest that the book is a better or 
more efficient medium of communication than the web, 
nor is it to suggest that these comparisons will not change, 
and soon. It is, however, to suggest that the book format is 
well developed considering its physical limitations, and that 
the web needs to confront the characteristics that constrain 
users from getting the information they want and moving 
around the information in a time-efficient and rational way.

Interpretation
Interpretation is information design applied to aid and 
enhance our understanding of non-statistical aspects of 
the past, present, or future. Interpretation, either with type, 
images, or usually both, tells stories about human experience 
that help us understand relationships among people and 
interaction among events. 
While much information design is directed at factual under­
standing, describing and mirroring experience, and ease of 
use, interpretive information design creates a narrative that 
enlarges our understanding of the complexity of life and 
history.
The line between information design and interpretive design 
is a soft one, and—like all history—“is written by the victors,” 
in the words of Winston Churchill (1874–1965). That means 
we need to be as demanding with interpretive work as with 
all information design, that the connections we make and 
the facts we are interpreting are verifiably true.

What do Romans want? Presum­
ably to understand their public 
transit network, just like all of us. 
In Rome, that generally means 
buses and trams and their rela­
tionship to its two subway lines 
(like Philadelphia, Rome has a lot 
of buses; Paris, like New York, has 
an extensive subway network). 
Their current map is an example 
of the “pack everything in” school 
of (non)information design.
Horror vacui is not confined to 
present-day maps of urban areas. 
Maps have long been cluttered 
with decorative cartouches and 
imaginary beings and places; 
phrases such as “terra incognita,”  
“here there be dragons,” or the
location of the kingdom of Pre­
ster John have been around since 
the beginning of mapmaking.
I began the work in progress of 
the same area of Rome at the 
right out of frustration with 
existing Rome bus maps. Like 
any map, diagram, or statistical 
graphic with less than the full 
amount of information available, 
it is literally “incomplete”; but it 
will be usable, I believe, by large 
numbers of people when finished.
If the information sets are 
too dense, the designer must 
establish a hierarchy of needs to 
constrain the breadth of informa­
tion to ensure that the graphic 
communicates what can be 
clearly understood.
Movement is multi-modal: 
pedestrian to car or transit to 
pedestrian. This map is intended 
for an audience of visitors prob­
ably oriented to larger streets 
and higher-profile destinations 
(musuems, palazzi, churches, and 
monuments) than to the finer 
grain of information that can be 
found on a more detailed street 
map. In large, complex cities, the 
visitor just may need two maps.

Information overload
How many angels can dance on the head of a pin? How 
much information can you put on a map? How many num­
bers can you put in a table? A lot, but that doesn’t mean they 
can be usefully understood.
The term “information overload” has been in the design 
lexicon for decades, but it is not always respected in practice. 
Whether a complex table with too many figures and vari­
ables but no connections, or a bus map of a city that shows 
everything possible, the result of information overload is that 
very little of too much will be understood. Possibly the user 
will be overwhelmed and completely paralyzed with fear of 
the anticipated effort and complexity.
This is an issue of usability, not of accuracy: completeness 
is a contextual and situational concept. Not all the informa­
tion that you can physically put on a map, in a diagram, 
or in a table will enhance understanding. It will often com­
promise it.

Facing page below. No one 
city is the only offender. This 
detail of an 11 x 17” handout of 
Philadelphia militates against 
understanding by showing every­
thing—everything. In solving 
a complex information design 
problem, the needs of a very 
small number of potential users 
with very specialized interests 
need to be sacrificed to the prod­
uct’s usability by the many.
In the 11 years between these 
two maps, legibility and issues 
of comprehension have dete­
riorated. While the earlier map, 
on the left, suffered from an 
overload of information, it 
adhered to some sound principles 
of information design, many of 
which are discussed in Section 
2: moderate chroma and light 
value colors that allow the type 
to be read; consistently light 
movement corridors; and transit 
stations along the route of the 
transit lines. 
The current map, on the other 
hand, does the original one better 
(worse, actually): adding hotels 
in bright red; reducing the size of 
the type that was none to large 
to begin with; increasing both 
the value and the chroma of the 
background colors; and inexpli­
cably shifting from white streets 
on coded color fields to gray 
streets on a white field outside 
Center City and showing inter­
state highways in blue. In both 
maps the district background 
colors are coded to a downtown 
pedestrian signing system.
L’Antisèche du Métro can be

Too much information
Clearly there are different types of information overload. 
Discussed on the previous spread are maps that contain so 
much data that they may be between difficult and impos­
sible to use for any purpose, because, presumably, they were 
intended to address every purpose.
Communicating large amounts of information successfully 
requires a certain amount of selection, an analysis of the 
need weighed against the increased difficulty of finding and 
understanding more. Functionality is the objective and the 
principal issue.
The maps on the left of the 
comparisons above are the work 
of David Imus, a one-man car­
tography office near Eugene, OR, 
and the winner of best of show in 
2012’s annual Cartography and 
Geographic Information Society 
competition. The Imus map of 
the United States is adoringly 
described on Slate and com­
pared, in these two selections, 
with the corresponding map by 
National Geographic.
Not wishing to seem negative, I 
nevertheless find the differences 
between the two rather minimal. 
Yes, the Imus map is handsome 
and legible, a bit more so than 
National Geographic’s: none of 
the type is tilted or curved, an 
amazing feat indeed; as a conse­
quence, type hierarchies might be 
more easily perceived. I certainly 
prefer that the interstate highway 
shields do not have a yellow 
background—no one is going to 
use a 4 x 3’ map to drive across 
Left. “Central Park Entire,” by 
Edward Sibley Barnard and Ken 
Chaya, identifies every major tree 
species in the Park and locates 
more than 19,000 trees and a 
great deal of additional informa­
tion as well. It took two years. 
It seems to me that the icon pal­
ette is inadequate to differentiate 
clearly among the 170+ tree 
species.
The alternatives are many, and 
certainly a less literal use of color 
and form are among them, but 
only on the assumption that the 
user will be unable to identify 
individual trees by their leaf 
shape and subtle color differen­
tiation.

Park Entire” tree map, which

the country—but of course that  
makes them harder to follow. 
The rendering of relief is well 
done, but it reduces the contrast 
between the information and the 
background.
All in all, a fine geographic 
map of the United States, and a 
well-written article, but I ques­
tion whether the inclusion of so 
much data, no matter how well 
done, has real value except as an 
exercise. 

10 different numbers. Sports 
lovers often love statistics (some­
times as much as the game) and 
the networks are only too happy 
to oblige. Unfortunately, their 
presentation often sets up a huge 
interference problem, in which 
the very quantity of numbers 
that mean very different things 
and their proximity to each other 
make it very difficult to sort 
through them in the minimal 
time allotted. In this case:
3 numbers deal with time;
2 numbers deal with the play;
2 numbers deal with the score;
1 number identifies a player;
2 numbers deal with that player’s 
performance.
6 time outs left (the yellow shapes 
above each team’s identification

Hey, on what yard line is the ball?
This case is also an example of 
the occasional difficulties of using 
team colors in the score panel. 
Baltimore’s color is violet; New 
England’s colors are blue with 
red. The violet and blue are really 
too close in hue and value to be 
differentiated quickly. If New Eng­
land’s identification panel were 
red instead of blue, it might help 
the viewer distinguish between 
the two teams more easily.

Information overload; Too much

An information graphic can have too many numbers in more 
than one way:
•  There are too many numbers in the data, a familiar informa­
tion overload problem, the solution to which is to make an 
effort either the reduce the quantity of data or to structure it 
in a workable hierarchy so that it can be perceived as staged.
•  The numbers are organized in a way that they interfere with 
each other, not unlike a type-heavy slide on the screen 
during a verbal presentation. Mutual interference (discussed 
on pages 134–135) can be quantitative as well as qualitative.
Too many numbers
Hole in the ozone layer. 
Stephen Hall tells a terrifying 
story about how the hole in the 
ozone layer went undetected for 
so long. It is a cautionary tale 
about the dangers of throwing 
out data that don’t agree with 
preconceptions and the difficul­
ties of gathering a quantity of 
numbers so vast it defies study. 
See page 198.
Perhaps not too unlike the Palm 
Beach County’s need for a presi­

with their not-state-of-the-art 
machines in the 2000 presidential 
election, various branches of our 
government seem committed to 
providing us with a huge amount 
of (admittedly rather important) 
numbers with little regard to how 
they are organized, structured, 
and understood. 
There seem to be two issues in 
these examples:
1)  there are a lot of numbers of 
many different sizes whose loca­
tion, meaning, and relationship 
to each other may not be entirely 
clear; 
2)  all the numbers seem to be 
of a uniformly bold weight, 
contributing to reduced 
differentiation,which suggests 
that they are all equally impor­
tant and might mean the same 
thing.

Dimensional comparison
The more 
dimensions used 
in quantitative 
comparisons, the 
larger are the 
disparities that can 
be accommodated. 
As irony would have 
it, however, the 
ease of comparison 
generally 
diminishes in 
direct proportion 
to the number 
of dimensions 
involved. 
Like generations of identification, visual quantitative com­
parisons depend on a number of factors, among which are:
•  the disparity in the quantities being compared;
•  the number of dimensions in the graphic being used for the 
comparison.
The more dimensions involved in a comparison, the harder 
the brain has to work to sort them out. Like conscious and 
unconscious decoding, graphic comparison solutions rep­
resent a balance between ease of comprehension and the 
need for the efficient use of space.

The pyramid paradox
What’s wrong with the picture at the top of the facing page?
It’s wrong. Demonstrating once again that our eyes (our 
brains, actually) are inclined to fool us when dealing with 
three-dimensional shapes, especially when rendered on a 
plane surface.
In life, we can walk around a cube, a sphere, or a pyramid and 
sense that its volume is very different than a plane rendering 
or an elevation. In the case of a pyramid, the volume of each 
trapezoidal segment increases dramatically as you move 
toward the base, and the volume of the little pyramid at 
the top is much, much smaller than its height alone might 
suggest.
With a pyramid, or a cone or cube or sphere, all that we can’t 
see leads us to misjudge its volume. The pyramid on the 
top is a re-creation of a widely reproduced annual report 
graph. All slices of the pyramid represent significantly dif-
ferent percentages than stated, the greatest distortion being 
1,000%, 10 times. The pyramid below it accurately renders 
the percentages that the first pyramid purports to.
This example raises a fundamental question: do we want 
our representation to be accurate or do we want it to appear 
or feel accurate? In using three-dimensional objects, and 
sometimes even two-dimensional objects, it is difficult to 
achieve both.

The pyramid may

from which to

(not counting solids

is applicable also to cones. 
Although they lack the historical 
symbolism of the pyramid, cones 
have many of the pyramid’s 
characteristics that make judging 
their volume difficult.
An article in The New York Times 
states: “The human brain has 
a surprisingly tough time with 
geometry and often can’t accu-
rately gauge when an object has 
doubled or even tripled in size. It’s 
even trickier when the object is a 
wide-mouth cup, larger on  
the top than the bottom. ‘We  
tend to underestimate the  
increase in the size of any object,’ 
said Professor Chandon [Pierre 
Chandon, director of the Insead 
Social Science Research Center in 
Paris]. ‘When you double the size 
of something, it really looks just 
50 to 70 percent bigger, not twice 
as big.’”

Every silver lining has a cloud. In 
the late 1980s, Katz Wheeler Design  
was engaged by an important 
textbook publisher (see page 5), 
from which we were fired for recom­
mending untraditional typographic 
and cartographic standards.
One of our cartographic contri­
butions before the contract was 
terminated was the idea of showing 
every country other than the United 
States compared to a map of Texas,  
on the assumption, described on 
the facing page, that eighth graders 
(as well as the rest of us) would be 
much more likely to have at least 
a rudimentary sense of the size of 
Texas (especially compared to the 
size of their own state) than of a 
scale of miles and kilometers.
The concept has lived on, even 
though the contract didn’t. (The 
mockups at right are not from the 
book.)

How big?
We all know and are comfortable with certain measures 
of size, length, and distance, regardless of our system of 
measurement. We all know how wide or long an inch, a foot, 
a yard, or a centimeter and a meter are. Hikers and drivers 
are probably good with miles and kilometers, shoppers with 
pounds and kilos, seamen with nautical miles and fathoms. 
Realtors, architects, and landscape architects are comfortable 
with acres, hectares, maybe square miles. But for most of 
us, the size of unfamiliar places larger than our own human 
scale—not a numerical or academic size, but a real sense of 
area or volume—is probably quite difficult to grasp.
Many atlases (and particularly road atlases) have not made 
things any easier, as we can see on pages 158–159. The same 
is also true of many middle-school geography textbooks, 
both U.S. and world geography, which attach a scale to all 
maps, but scales that are largely meaningless due to the 
magnitude of the non-human-scale numbers involved 
(France is more than 400 miles east to west, from Brest to 
Strasbourg, which is nothing like the distance from St. Peters­
burg to Alaska (4,100 miles).
Who among us, particularly an eighth grader, has a mean­
ingful, experiential sense of 400 miles in real distance, not 
in driving or flying time? Comparison can come to a partial 
rescue, at least theoretically: compare the size of France to 
something with which a large number of people are some­
what familiar. How about Texas?
What does Texas offer, other than, coincidentally, being 
about the same size as France? Texas would work for a 
comparison with China, which is much larger, as well as with 
Ireland, which is much smaller. Additionally, many of us are 
more familiar with Texas than with a lot of other states (other 
than the state we live in). It has a lot of history—there’s the 
Texas Revolution and the Battle of the Alamo; four presidents 
were born there, all of whom served after 1950; the football 
Cowboys are from there; John F. Kennedy was assassinated 
there. And so on. It has a distinctive shape (unlike Colorado 
and Wyoming); it isn’t too small (like Massachusetts, which  
has a distinctive shape, too).
The point is that when hundreds of miles and kilometers 
extend beyond our ability to image them in a meaningful 
way, a comparison to something familiar can’t hurt.
Comparison supporting the via­
bility of Texas as a comparison for 
other countries around the world. 
Using Massachusetts would not be 
helpful.

Many concepts and 
relationships are 
difficult to grasp 
because of enormous 
or microscopic 
sizes and distances 
or because of huge 
disparities of scale. 
Representing these 
things with objects 
with which we have 
all had experience 
is a way to start 
working on the 
problem.

As a child, I was always frustrated by the inability of the 
astronomy books I read to communicate a sense of the 
planets’ relative sizes and their (average) orbital distance from 
the sun. It was impossible for one diagram to show both the 
sizes of the planets relative to each other and those sizes 
relative to their orbits: when their orbital relationships were 
correct, the planets were too small; when the planets were 
large enough to compare, even a schoolchild could sense 
that if the planets were that large their orbits were impos­
sibly small. It is not an easily solvable problem.
There have been many efforts to deal with communicating 
these two comparisons, one of size, the other of distance. 
It’s the opposite problem from rail maps, where you want 
to communicate experiential units of measurement with 
efficiency. With the planets, you want to communicate exact 
differences in size and distance.
And the sizes and distances are unimaginably huge: Jupiter 
is 143,000 miles in diameter; Neptune is 2.8 billion miles from 
the sun. How can you imagine numbers like that? Most of us 
know that earth is about 8,000 miles in diameter and about 
25,000 miles in circumference (π times d). Difficult enough. 
How about distance from the sun: about 93 million miles. 
How about its volume: 260 billion cubic miles. 
There are many instances where the number—260 bil­
lion—or the unit—cubic miles—defeat us. But in matters 
of comparison, we can create similes that give us a better 
chance of grasping very large sizes or ungraspable distances.
This ad for Southwest Airlines 
uses an orrery simile.
We may not be able to visualize 
the difference between a 5,000-
mile diameter planet (Mercury)
and a 143,000-mile diameter 
planet (Jupiter), but we can visu­
alize the size difference between 
a blueberry and a honeydew.

Four bars at their true compara­

The same four bars utilizing break

the use of space is inefficient.
The same four bars with a non-

no man has a right 
to be wrong in his 
facts.

Not lying in diagrams is different than telling the truth in life, 
and contains many categories within which are shadings of 
intent. Some people tell the truth; some people misstate the 
truth accidentally; some people lie deliberately. See pages 
14–15.
The architect or engineer who invented break lines had 
a rational objective: to show the beginning and end of 
something—probably quite long—whose middle was of 
no interest or consequence because it was the same as the 
beginning and the end of the object. No meaningful infor­
mation is distorted or lost; efficiency is gained.
Break lines and non-zero-base bar graphs, however, misstate 
information. Bar graphs are used to compare informa­
tion expressed by the length of the bar. If the relationship 
between the length of the bars is distorted, the graphic 
is misleading. By definition, these techniques make the 
relationship of the smallest quantity and the largest quantity 
much greater than it actually is.
A graph with break lines provides at least an acknowledg­
ment that important information is missing. Non-zero-base 
graphs count on our assumption that the base of the graph 
is zero and on the expectation that we will not look too 
closely. Both of these techniques are often used to inflate 
the appearance of financial gains and in political reports. It is 
lying; or, at the very least, visual misinformation. 
It can be argued that both devices use space efficiently, 
which is not untrue, as far as it goes. There are other ways to 
use space efficiently that are less misleading—particularly 
important when the value disparities are large—such as 
scale reduction, two-dimensionality (though harder to com­
pare), and Nigel Holmes’ snake technique. 
Maintaining integrity (and lack thereof) in information design 
has many aspects: be sure the data are complete; be sure the 
data are accurate; be sure the data are pertinent; be sure the 
data all address the same issue in the same way; be sure the 
visual representation of the data meets all these criteria and 
discourages mininterpretation.

This “comparative overview of 
important rivers and mountains” 
(Germany, date unknown) is 
characteristic of a host of similar 
maps in 19th-century atlases 
and textbooks. Interestingly, in 
this print, the rivers have a “zero 
base” but the mountains do not. 
These picturesque and engaging 
presentations surely encouraged 
the study of geography.

Neurath in Vienna in the 1920s, 
the graphic quality of the work 
was enhanced by graphic artist 
Gerd Arntz.

Old maps and diagrams, with 
their elaborate cartouches, 
elegant typography, and carto­
graphic flourishes appeal to us as 
doorways to a different time. We 
often look at early examples of 
information design with a sense 
of nostalgia and an appreciation 
of their history, both of the time 
they were made and the impor­
tance of the information and 
ideas they communicated, often 
for the first time.
Elegance and nostalgia, however, 
do not necessarily contribute 
to clear information design.By 
making the streets white against 
a gray background, the deaths 
pop against the background and 
the streets, and the pump loca­
tions stand out, even in grayscale.
One of these things is not like 
the other. But why is that one—
the page that you’re on—the 
least eye-catching?

Meaningful numbers
Numbers have power. Numbers have meaning. The mean­
ingful visualization of numbers in particular circumstances 
has helped save lives cut short by disease, identified the 
ramifications of social inequalities, and in at least one 
instance masked a major scientific problem for years, the 
hole in the ozone layer.
Snow proved his theory of water-borne cholera contamina­
tion by mapping the location of deaths in London’s Soho 
district. At the time, people got their drinking water from 
public pumps. Snow’s map clearly showed a significant 
majority of deaths centered on a pump on Broad (now 
Broadwick) Street. When the handle of the pump was 
removed (amid loud protests), cholera deaths in the neigh­
borhood declined.
Many maps, especially older ones, that are conceptually intel­
ligent and notationally or historically important are, in many 
cases, not the most visually strong. Much of this, certainly 
in historic maps, is due to conventions of vocabulary and 
notation that existed at the time. As a result, many of them 
are extremely elegant and quite beautiful, in some cases 
masking their information and its power.
Connections are not always or 
necessarily about relationships 
between people. Often, the rela­
tionships revealed by mapping 
connections are a matter of life 
and death.
Take the case of London’s cholera 
epidemic of 1854. At the time, dis­
eases such as cholera and plague 
were attributed to miasma, or 
bad air (in medieval Italian, 
malaria). So prevalent was the 
miasmic theory at the time that 
germ theory awaited the work 
of Louis Pasteur in the 1860s. 
(The cholera bacillus, discovered 
in Italy in 1854, was completely 
ignored at the time and was 
rediscovered 30 years later.)
Dr. John Snow, suspicious of the 
airborne transmission theory, 
mapped cholera deaths and 
public water pumps, clearly 
revealing that the Broad Street 
pump was the source of the con­
tamination. 
In the so-called “Nightingale 
Rose”—”Diagram of the Causes 
of Mortality in the Army in the 
East”—Florence Nightingale  
(1820–1910) unintentionally 
overdramatized the facts. She 
developed this type of diagram—
known as the polar area—in 
1858. (The pie chart was devel­
oped by William Playfair.)
The American Profile Poster, 
first published in 1986, used 
Isotype-like icons to visualize 
demographics in the United 
States. Many subsequent updated 
versions are available.
[Playfair] was the 
first in a series 
of economists, 
statisticians, and 
social reformers 
who wanted to use 
data not only to 
inform but also to 
persuade and even 
campaign—and 
who understood 
that when the eye 
comprehends, the 
heart often follows.

Left. A geographically accurate 
but typically misleading map of 
the 2008 U.S. presidential elec­
tion. Many densely populated 
states are geographically small; 
many sparsely populated states 
are geographically large. As a 
result, President Obama’s vic­
tory is counterindicated by the 
graphic. 
Advantages
Greatest recognizability of each 
state.
Able to compare states with dif­
ferent data.
Disadvantage
The geographic size of the state 
has no correlation to statewide 
quantitative data.
Right center. The same informa­
tion expressed in a cartogram by 
Mark Newman at the University 
of Michigan. This cartogram 
references the familiar shape of 
the states, but the degree of dis­
tortion renders some of that very 
familiarity problematic. It clearly 
shows, however, the extent of 
Obama’s electoral victory.
Advantage
Shows true quantitative data 
maintaining some recognizable 
geographic familiarity.
Disadvantages 
Difficult to compare quantities 
by state;
Some states difficult to recognize 
without labels;
Small changes in data can be 
seen only with difficulty.
The map below appeared after 
the 2002 Pennsylvania Demo­
cratic gubernatorial primary, 
strongly suggesting that it was 
won by (now Senator) Bob Casey 
over former Philadelphia Mayor 
Ed Rendell.
Wrong.
The future governor won only 
ten of the state’s 67 counties but 
easily won the popular vote (an 
example of where the popular 
vote actually counts) with over 
56% of the vote.
Left. A diagram redrawn from the 
original in The New York Times 
for the 2002 presidential election, 
in which the area of each state 
is proportional to its number of 
electoral votes. The compromise 
between geographic shape and a 
more uniform vocabulary tends 
to permit finding particular states 
easily and comparing their rela­
tive electoral strength.
Advantages
Retains shape and relative loca­
tion of individual states;
Quantities can be approximately 
compared.
Disadvantage
Will not adjust to changes in data 
without redrawing the entire 
map, both time-consuming and 
confusing.
Using the dreaded pie chart 
(actually, quite effective with no 
more than two or three wedges) 
on each county, proportioned in 
size to the number of votes cast, 
the picture becomes clear. The 
counties Rendell won were five 
of the state’s 10 largest (in terms 
of votes cast), and he won in 
those counties by extremely large 
majorities, especially in Philadel­
phia, which alone gave Rendell 
more than half the votes Casey 
received in the entire state.

This map of the United States 
by Chris Pullman was made 
with stones found on a beach 
in Maine. All states are shown 
actual size in relation to their 
neighbors.
Geography—both shape and area—contradict our ability to 
compare and contrast what goes on within those irregular 
shapes.
Consider the United States Electoral College, created with 
the Twelfth Amendment and ratified in 1804 (Washington, 
DC, was added with the Twenty-Third Amendment in 1961). 
This amendment, in the election for President and Vice 
President of the United States, gives each state the number 
of electors (electoral votes) that is the sum of that state’s U.S. 
senators and representatives. The minimum number of elec­
toral votes a state can have is, therefore, three. This formula 
was a compromise between election by popular vote and 
election by the states.
Since each state’s number of U.S. representatives is deter­
mined by the most recent decennial census, states with 
greater population have more electoral votes. However, 
states with smaller populations have more electoral votes 
than proportional to their population.
On the facing page are two techniques for showing the 
results of the 2008 presidential election cartographically, with 
a geographic map of the United States for comparison. Note 
that the geographic map suggests that the Republicans won 
the election, when we know that the Democrats won both 
the popular and Electoral College vote. This is due to the fact 
that many geographically large states have small populations 
and many states that are small in area are densely settled and 
have comparatively large populations.
Another example of geographic depiction masquerading 
truth is the 2002 Pennsylvania Democratic gubernatorial 
primary, geographically represented with a map of the state’s 
67 counties without regard to population. Exactly as in the 
skewed geographic representation of the U.S. presidential 
election, geography masks the truth: the Democratic candi­
date won just 10 of Pennsylvania’s 67 counties, but bested 
his opponent 56% to 44%.

Newman’s cartogram based on 
population (bottom) rather than 
on electoral votes (top). Subtle 
changes are generally difficult 
to see and compare. Wyoming 
has become noticeably smaller, 
along with Rhode Island; Texas 
has become larger. The difficulty 
is that irregular shapes are noto­
riusly difficult to compare, even 
when adjacent to each other. 
In this comparison, the overall 
outlines of the continental United 
States are almost indistinguish­
able from each other.
The cartograms below were 
based on a combination of 
coincidence and intention: coin­
cidence in that the United States 
is organized geographically in a 
way that permits groupings that 
divide the country into five gener­
ally north-south regions. To a 
large extent these sections corre­
spond to regions as they are often 
described, with the exception of a 
“southern tier” of states running 
from east to west.
In all these cartograms, the 
overall size of the country 
remains constant. This makes 
it possible to compare different 
data sets if the new cartogram 
is placed below (or above) or to 
the right (or left) of the original or 
earlier data set.	
Advantages
Smaller changes can be seen 
when comparing data sets that 
have changed over time.
It is not difficult to discern change 
among “regions” between two of 
the cartograms placed one over 
the other.
Disadvantage
Without the familiarity of geo­
graphic shape and size, it is likely 
to be initially difficult to recognize 
individual states.
The 2008 presidential election 
(also shown for comparison on 
facing page at top) using the 
author’s cartogrammic format. It 
is possible that this rectangular 
format makes it easiest to sense 
the relationship of Obama’s 
electoral college victory most 
accurately.
This is really qualitative but it 
was hard to resist. We are so tied 
into red for Republicans that 
the designer used three inad­
equately different hues of red 
to distinguish three Republican 
candidates vying for conven­
tion delegates. As is so often 
the case, the geographic size 
of the individual states masks 
the important data of delegate 
votes, which are proportional to 
population.

The addition of two electoral votes (representing each state’s 
two U.S. senators), makes the Electoral College unfair by 
definition, if by “fairness” is meant the one-person, one-vote 
concept of American democracy as it is generally implied 
and understood.
While the obvious solution is to elect our President and 
Vice President by popular vote, that is not likely to happen 
anytime soon, if ever; nor is reform of the Electoral College, 
which favors states with smaller populations. But it helps 
to understand the distortions and inequities created by 
the Electoral College and its dependence on a census that 
takes place only once every 10 years.  Since geographic 
maps reveal nothing more than physical size, we must turn 
to some other cartographic device to communicate that 
information.
When attempting to compare variation within a constant set 
of data, I found reducing distractions (in this example, shape 
and exact geographic location) helpful. This cartographic 
formula was developed to:
•  Eliminate all distractions and misrepresentations created by 
shape, with the (optional) exception of Virginia/West Virginia, 
North Carolina/South Carolina, and Nevada/California, where 
I felt that the addition of diagonals would help orient the 
user);
•  Separate the country into five regions that can be compared, 
as well as comparing variations by individual state;
•  Maintain a constant size, arbitrarily set at 20 units high, that 
can correspond to 538 electoral vote units, making it pos­
sible to see comparisons among different data sets, such as 
population and relative electoral power;
•  Allow for the inclusion of Alaska and Hawaii, at a size 
reflecting their population or number of electoral votes, as 
part of the Pacific region.
The census giveth and the 
census taketh away. This carto­
gram shows which states have 
gained (green) and lost (red)
electoral votes as a result of the 
2010 census.
Above. Approximately the same 
information as at left, here in the 
author’s format. Wyoming—the 
state with the most electoral 
power in 2008—is now a third 
of its electoral size; Texas—the 
state with the least electoral 
power in 2008—is now appro­
priately larger. Electoral power 
is described on the following 
spread. 
An advantage of a cartographic 
device that uses (with just a few 
exceptions) only rectangles is 
that any cartograms being com­
pared can be scaled (together)in 
any way and the comparison will 
remain clear, since familiar and 
irregular geographic shapes have 
been removed.

This electoral power map (esti­
mated for the 2008 election, 
based on the 2000 census) shows 
the relative electoral power of 
each person in every state rela­
tive to each person in every other 
state (including Washington, 
DC, which has 3 electoral votes, 
as if it had representation in 
Congress). 
Several factors result in the huge 
disparity between population-
determined electoral votes 
depicted immediately above and 
real electoral power:
• The electoral vote formula 
that includes each state’s two 
senators added to its number of 
representatives to determine its 
number of electoral votes;
• The rounding necessary to 
provide each state with a small 
population at least one repre­
sentative;
• General rounding to the nearest 
whole number.
The form of an information 
graphic that works, as we have 
continually reiterated, is a 
response to data. 
In this cartogram, states with 
too much electoral power are 
shown in green, states with too 
little electoral power are shown in 
orange. The cartogram is based 
on the electoral votes that each 
state should have based on its 
population (in other words, its 
number of representatives).
Conflicting conventions. While 
red in general denotes the nega­
tive (“stop,” “danger”) and green 
positive (“go”), these two carto­
grams substituted orange for red 
to avoid confusion with another 
connotation of red in politics—
the Republican party. 
This cartogram assigns the results 
of the electoral power cartogram 
immediately above with the cur­
rent electoral vote assignment 
cartogram.
Interestingly, disparities in elec­
toral power—based as they are 
on state population size—appear 
to have discriminated equally 
between Republican-leaning 
states and Democratic-leaning 
states in the 2008 election. Presi­
dent Obama would have won the 
election by whatever calculation 
is used—including, of course, the 
popular vote, the only truly fair 
way to have an election.

Per capita
The cartograms at the left show:
• More states have “too much” 
electoral power than too little 
(since the states with too little 
power are the most populous 
states); more people have “too 
little” electoral power.
• The states with the least electoral 
power are likely to change every 
10 years. From 2001–2010 the 
states whose citizens had the 
least electoral power were Texas 
and Florida; between 2011 and 
2020 they are California and New 
York. In both censuses, the enti­
ties with the most electoral power 
per citizen are Wyoming and 
Washington, DC.
• Between 2000 and 2010 the resi­
dents of Wyoming had more than 
four times the electoral power of 
the residents of Texas. The 2010 
census changed things, but not 
very much: for the next 10 years, 
the residents of Wyoming—the 
least populous state—will have 
more than three-and-a-half 
times the electoral power of those 
of California, the most populous.
• The number of persons with 
too little electoral power is over 
197,000,000—almost 64% of the 
population.
• The number of persons with too 
much electoral power is almost 
95,000,000—over 30% of the 
population.
• The number of persons with 
about the right amount of 
electoral power is fewer than 
18,000,000—less than 6% of the 
U.S. population.
Per capita (from 
the Latin, “for 
each head,” or 
per person) is 
the only way of 
understanding 
numerical 
relationships 
among groups of 
people. 
The number of 
U.S. citizens 
with too little 
electoral power is 
197,000,000—
almost 64% of the 
population.
Like current and constant currencies, and like percentages 
of change, per capita is also a ratio: a number—such as 
electoral votes—divided by the number of persons in the 
equation. Per capita is applicable in many areas that require a 
meaningful understanding of numbers.
Texas has almost three times the number of residents as New 
Jersey, but New Jersey has the greatest number of persons 
per square mile, more than 12 times as many. Per capita per 
square mile (or any other unit of area) is a measure of density. 
The geographic size of Texas compared to that of New Jersey 
is not particularly relevant in this case.
Tennessee receives a hypothetical Federal education grant 
for $30,000,000, while Maine receives one for $10,000,000. 
Tennessee’s grant is three times the amount in dollars as 
Maine’s, but Maine’s represents $7.50 per person, while Ten­
nessee’s only $4.70 per person.
In 1997, 767,000 Hispanic female heads of households lived 
in poverty, 48% of that demographic. At that time, 193,000 
white males aged 55–59 lived in poverty, less than 4%. The 
disparity per capita of the two demographics is 12 times.
Wyoming has three electoral votes in the presidential 
election. California has 55. Each electoral vote in California 
represents 679,000 persons; each electoral vote in Wyo­
ming represents 189,000 persons. Therefore, each person in 
Wyoming has more than three-and-a-half times the electoral 
power as each Californian. Until the 2010 census made Cali­
fornia the state with the least electoral power per person, the 
honor belonged to Texas. During the 2000 decade, Wyoming 
had more than four times the electoral power per person as 
Texas. The state with the least electoral power per capita may 
change, but the state with the most appears to be Wyoming 
for the imaginable future.

Gerrymandering is the prac­
tice of creating an advantage 
for a particular politician or 
political party by manipulating 
district geographic boundaries. 
Gerrymandering was named 
for governor Elbridge Gerry 
(1744–1814) of Massachusetts, 
who signed a bill to redistrict the 
state to benefit his Democratic-
Republican party. One district in 
the Boston area was thought to 
resemble a salamander, and the 
combination name was coined 
by  a person unknown. The elec­
toral college represents a kind of 
numerical gerrymandering.

Cartograms by Mark Newman et 
al., similar to the U.S. electoral car­
tograms on pages 96 and 98. These 
use an earlier version of his algo­
rithm than the cartogram shown 
below and are from the World­
mapper website. My own feeling is 
that, while these clearly suffer from 
the “bloated slug” syndrome, the 
more recent one (this page, bottom 
left), more elegant in its distortion, 
is compromised by the distractions 
of land relief and ocean depth.
The cartogram at the left shows 
forest depletion; at the right, earth­
quakes.
These two data maps are from 
Virginie Raisson’s 2033: Atlas des 
Futurs du Monde. Like the two 
cartograms above, they were 
selected to show how this approach 
to quantitative mapping can vary 
so dramatically depending on the 
data set. At left, the distribution 
of global wealth; at right, lack of 
access to running water.
Choose the compromise you 
prefer. The Newman cartogram 
above benefits from the recognition 
of familiar geographic shapes­—
such as the United States and the 
United Kingdom—but only if they 
are not overly distorted, as is Africa. 
In The State of the World Atlas 
cartogram at right on the identical 
subject—national income per 
capita—the familiarity of countries’ 
geographic form is compromised 
but the quantitative comparisons 
are much easier to make.

Mapping data 
is inevitably 
an exercise in 
compromise. 
Let the data 
determine the form, 
not the other way 
around.
Data and form
Would a little humor hurt? This 
chart by Nigel Holmes, which 
appeared in Time magazine 
(originally in two colors) in 1982, 
was savaged by Edward Tufte in 
Envisioning Information (1990):
“Consider this unsavory exhibit…
chockablock with cliché and 
stereotype, coarse humor, and a 
content-empty third dimension. 
It is the product of a visual sensi­
tivity in which a thigh-graph with 
a fishnet stocking grid counts as 
a Creative Concept.”
Since then, many have come to 
the defense of Holmes’ ability 
to make data inviting as well as 
clear. One of these, a paper by 
five authors from the Depart­
ment of Computer Science at 
the University of Saskatchewan, 
states: “The added visual imagery 
in a Holmes style chart could 
draw the reader’s eye, could 
help convey a specific message, 
or could make the chart more 
memorable.”  I agree.
While quantitative data is usually geographically specific, 
geography is not inclined to be cooperative, so the designer 
must select compromises that are least damaging to the 
presentation and understanding of the data. 
In a comparison of the top two maps and the one at the 
bottom left on the facing page, the difference between them 
represents a question less of compromise than of choice: on 
the one hand, the cartographer developed a more pleasing 
and effective algorithm between the top and bottom; on the 
other hand, the addition of land relief and ocean depth just 
complicates areas that do not pertain to the data and make 
the map busier. Both, in which country shapes are grossly 
distorted, nevertheless dramatically reveral by that distortion 
comparative characteristics of both countries and continents. 
The degree of distortion, of course, makes exact data impos­
sible to calculate without the accompanying tables.
In the center pair of maps, while the area of circles in general 
may not be as easy to perceive as squares or rectangles, 
these diagrams work well, and the individual countries can 
be surmised by their location. The greater the number of 
diagrams in the series, the easier it is to have a sense of the 
countries being mapped.
The cartogram in the lower right uses a rectangular vocabu­
lary to reference country shapes. While not completely 
successful, it appeals to me because of the relative ease of 
comparing quantities.

maps below, in an article 
in The New York Times—
”Understanding the European

promises and difficulties inherent 
in using geographic forms to 
make quantitative comparisons:
• Out of their normal context and 
position relative to each other—
required by the distortions of 
size—not all of the countries may 
be easily recognizable.
• The irregular geographic shapes 
make comparing the shapes to 
each other and the change in 
data from one data map to the 
next difficult. They also make 
extracting the quantitative data 
extremely difficult.

Cities: Comparisons in Form and 
Scale is a 1974 reissue in book 
form of the original portfolio of 
50 cities modeled at the same 
scale by 61 architecture students 
at North Carolina State University 
at Raleigh in 1963. In addition 
to the often surprising informa­
tion about the size of different 
cities, the photography of the 
models, accompanied by many 
of the students’ drawings, is quite 
beautiful.
In Urban Atlas: 20 American 
Cities, Joseph R. Passonneau and 
Richard Saul Wurman clearly 
demonstrated the advantage—
actually, the necessity—of 
using the same scale to make 
meaningful comparisons among 
different geographical locations. 
In general, finding a broad range 
of maps at the same scale world­
wide is not an easy task.

In 1967, The MIT Press published Joseph R. Passoneau and 
Richard Saul Wurman’s Urban Atlas: 20 American Cities, A 
Communication Study Notating Selected Urban Data, a large 
atlas with a long title that, as its name implies, compares 
geography, land use, income, and population density for 
20 American cities at the same scale. Unlike traditional road 
atlases (see pages 158–159), where the scale of any given 
state was whatever would fill the page (either horizontally or 
vertically), Urban Atlas: 20 American Cities shows the cities (or 
their central portions) at a constant scale and with a uniform 
data grid. This makes it possible to compare the many 
aspects of these cities both overall (by sensing the density of 
the colors or patterns) and by a particular location.
Uniformity of data and wayshowing scale have been a 
characteristic of Wurman’s work for more than 45 years, and 
one to which he has often introduced his occasional archi­
tecture students. In 1963, at North Carolina State University 
in Raleigh, his students built models of fifty cities, many of 
historical importance, at a constant scale (1”=600’), which, 
like Urban Atlas: 20 American Cities, permitted previously dif­
ficult or impossible comparisons to be easily made.
Van Susteren and Grooten’s Metropolitan World Atlas, below, 
carries this to the ultimate extreme, with the result that the 
book’s consistency becomes a bit deadening. The book is 
further compromised by the weakness of the pale ochre 
holding circle.

Relative and absolute: ratios of change
Current dollars 
(or any currency): 
contemporaneous 
dollars not adjusted 
for inflation, the 
currency’s evolving 
value, or its worth 
at the present time.
Constant dollars: 
dollars adjusted 
to their real worth 
in the present or 
the specific period 
under discussion.
Inflation—the eroding value of a particular unit of cur­
rency—is an example of a ratio: the value of something 
today is a certain percentage of what it was last year or a 
century ago. (Rarely, it is worth more—deflation—which is 
another issue with different consequences.) For the purposes 
of comparison, if a dollar was worth 100 cents in 1992 and 80 
cents in 2012, that represents a decline in value of 20%; and, 
conversely, the value of a dollar was 25% more 20 years ago.
Very often, we miss the mathematical basis by which we 
understand what percentages really mean and how to com­
pare the changes that percentages express, because the data 
may seem counterintuitive or because we are emphasizing 
incomplete data. Some examples, visualized on the facing 
page, might help:
In a hypothetical district or county are two ethnic groups. In 
2002, with a total population of 10,000, there were 1,000 per­
sons in group A and 9,000 persons in group B. Ten years later, 
in 2012,  there were 8,000 persons in groups A and 12,000 
persons in group B.
In those 10 years, group B retained its majority, but group A 
grew at a markedly different rate. While group B grew from 
8,000 to 12,000 persons—that’s 33.33% in 10 years, or 3.33% 
on average per year, group A grew from 1,000 persons to 
8,000 persons, 800%, or an average of 80% a year.
So, as we look at numbers, whether widgets or currency or 
people, it is important to keep in mind that the meaning of 
those numbers is almost always in relationship to some other 
number­—1912 dollars (or any currency) to 2012 dollars; dol­
lars to numbers of people, or numbers of people to dollars; 
percentage of change over time between one data set and 
another.

When is a dollar not a dollar? 
When is a dollar really a dollar? 
What’s a dollar, anyway?
Easy enough questions when 
you’re talking about comparing 
a dollar with another dollar 
today, maybe yesterday, or 
tomorrow. But next year? That’s 
a different story. Why? Inflation. 
Today’s dollar is worth less than 
last year’s dollar: prices go up. If 
income goes up, everything’s fine 
(well, maybe not fine; but at least 
not worse). The only reliable mea­
sure of a dollar (or any currency) 
is what you can buy with it.
It’s important to know, then, 
when comparing the cost of 
things over time what the 
comparison—what the units of 
currency—really means. A dollar 
in 1965 (the year I started college) 
was worth $6.00 in 2004, the year 
our son started college. Quite a 
change.
A current dollar (also called 
nominal, or arbitrary) makes 
no adjustment for its value: 
the $5,000 tuition in 1965 is 
compared to the $35,000 tuition 
today, interesting but essentially 
meaningless; the cost of tuition 
did not really go up 700% in 
real terms. A constant dollar 
reflects its value, most often cal­
culated by using the Consumer 
Price Index, or CPI. (Tuition and 
ancillary education costs have 
increased at a rate greater than 
the rate of inflation.)

A longstanding practice in graphing has been the use of 
more than the standard two axes, or the modification of the 
usual two axes; in some cases, the z-axis, adding dimension, 
and in other cases the use of more than one y-axis. Using 
more than one y-axis can work in different ways.
For example, having two y-axes that are categorically dif­
ferent shows the relationship between two sets of quantities. 
This has the effect of eliminating time, often the function of 
the x-axis, and showing the relationship between the two 
y-axes at a single point in time. Another approach is to have 
two (or more) y-axes that are also categorically different—for 
example, with their plots shown in different colors, thereby 
showing the relationship, over time, between the categories. 
In both cases, it is necessary to choose the values assigned 
to the y-axes so that comparisons are meaningful—either 
by plotting them so that the graphs of both categories have 
the same visual starting point or by using parallel increments 
that are meaningful and truthful. The graph at the right is a 
successful example.

the bottom with poverty by race. 
In the top graphic, the y-axis 
deals with the percentage of pov­
erty in the age group and states 
its relationship to the national 
average; the z-axis is determined 
by the number of Americans in 
poverty in each age group. The 
bottom graph is similar but based 
on race rather than age.
This graph (data are from 2007) 
with a double y-axis reveals the

spending, average number of 
doctor visits per person per year, 
and average life expectancy. 
The United States, with by far 
the highest health care costs 
per person, is extremely low in 
doctor visits and below average 
in life expectancy; it is one of two 
countries in the survey without 
universal health coverage (the 
other is Mexico).

If one is used to measuring in 
10ths, it is easy to think in halves 
and 5ths, less easy to think in 3rds 
and 4ths, the consequence of 
nothing more than the intuitive 
desire to work in whole num­
bers; conversely, if one is used 
to thinking in 12ths, it is easy to 
think in 3rds, 4ths, and 6ths (the 
pica) and less easy to think in 
5ths and 10ths.

To measure it is to 
think about it.
Bruno Martin
There are two main kinds of measuring: literal­—math­
ematical—and experiential. The latter has only fairly recently 
come into general use (although John Ogilby’s Britannia of 
1675 utilized it, although not dramatically).
Measurement systems inevitably influence the way 
designers use proportion in their work.
Almost all the world uses an intellectually determined, 
rational, constructed system of measurement: the metric 
system, first adopted by France in 1791. Using the earth as 
its “yardstick,” the meter was defined as one ten-millionth of 
the distance from the Equator to the North Pole. Measure­
ments for area, weight, and volume were similarly rational. 
Most important, it is a decimal system, in which every unit of 
measurement is related to every other by a multiple of 10.
The United States is one of only four countries in the world 
to use the English system of measurement (Liberia, Myanmar, 
and sometimes the United Kingdom are the others). The 
English system has a much longer history and is irrational 
in the sense that larger units of measure do not bear a fixed 
relationship to smaller units of measure. It is also irrational in 
the other sense of the word: in some ways, it is experiential, 
with units of measure based on human anatomy, experi­
ence, and familiar containers. The digit, palm, and cubit, for 
example, all date from the Old Kingdom in Egypt (3rd millen­
nium BCE). 
These two very different systems of measurement inevi­
tably affect their users’ sense of proportion. If one is used to 
thinking in tenths, it is difficult to think in thirds and fourths; 
if one is used to thinking in twelfths, it is difficult to think in 
fifths.

The grid
Appropriate line 
length is a function 
of type size: I was 
taught that two 
alphabets (52 
characters) is the 
maximum line 
length for legibility. 
(That, of course, 
suggests a narrower 
maximum measure 
for Garamond than 
for Helvetica of the 
same nominal point 
size.)
Every designer knows about grids. Not every designer knows 
how to use them.
Grids are useful in information design because they provide 
an armature for the structure and organization of informa­
tion. Rectangular grids are of two principal types, which—in 
terms of their vertical organization—I’ll call skeletal and 
interval.
A skeletal grid is a fixed structure that you may liken to a 
building of (usually) uniformly spaced floors, studs, and joists. 
An interval grid permits floors of any measurement, sepa­
rated by a space, or joist, of fixed measurement. Not unlike 
the uniform space between paragraphs (if you put space 
between paragraphs), it is totally content- and typography-
governed, with few fixed horizontal hanglines.
The number of vertical columns in any grid permits a variety 
of typographic and visual organizations. Up to the point of 
compromises in legibility because of line lengths that are too 
narrow or too wide, more columns can offer more flexibility 
and the possibility of interesting asymmetry.

In classical book design, many

to b, represented by the Greek 
letter phi (φ). The Golden Ratio 
has wide application in math­

Forms are 
frameworks for 
communication, 
comprised of text 
and graphics, and 
including fixed and 
variable pieces of 
information.
Borries Schwesinger,
The Form Book
We are all familiar—perhaps too familiar—with filling out 
forms: at the doctor’s office, job and school applications, 
paying for a purchase online, and—everybody’s favorite—
filling out our tax return.
The form is at once impersonal and intimate, brusque and 
exploratory, indifferent and empathetic. Which it is depends 
on the form’s intent and—parallel but separate—its design.
The IRS really doesn’t care about you very much, if at all, and 
seeks a purely numerical relationship. You tell them how 
much you earned, claim your deductions, and they will tell 
you how much money to send them. It is a transaction but 
not a relationship. The same is pretty much true of credit 
card applications and buying online. 
Virtually all school and some job applications are at the other 
extreme. They want to know enough about you so that they 
can ascertain whether you meet their criteria and, more 
important, whether you have the personal and intellectual 
qualities to be part of a class, a team, a workforce. Are you 
interested and interesting? Do you have anger manage­
ment issues? Can you do the job, whether stacking shelves, 
waitering, or completing a program of study?
Most forms are somewhere in-between, a combination of 
writing and check-offs, and many of these risk failure by their 
very effort to be easy to fill out and efficient. Medical history 
forms often provide too little opportunity for qualitative 
aspects of historical medical problems, and hospital dis­
charge forms often lack the structure and hierarchy helpful, 
even essential, to self-manage care after a minor or major 
physician, emergency room, or hospital experience.

Online Use. If you like forms, this is the only book you’ll ever need.

In addition to flush left–flush 
right there is also top-to-
bottom alignment.
In a quick scan of the menu 
below left, we want to read the 
English translations with the 
Italian descriptions to which 
they are closest. Fortunately, 
it doesn’t take a knowledge of 
Italian to know that “tomatoes” 
and “olive” are not the same. 
It appears at first glance at 
the menu below right that the 
prices are (sensibly) immedi­
ately to the left of the menu 
item, until a scan of the overall 
menu and the misalignment of 
the prices with the menu items 
to their immediate right give 
the game away.
Far left. A recreated (with 
dummy text) table of contents 
from a well-known book on 
design. The page numbers are 
very far from the titles to which 
they refer.
Center left. Compounding visual 
ambiguity with the annoying 
technique of connecting the 
titles to their page numbers 
with leader dots.
Left. The use of flush right folios 
and flush left titles makes the 
table of contents easier to use 
and uses space economically.

We tend to group 
like with like; 
careful spacing, 
both horizontal 
and vertical, and 
the careful use of 
rules can aid in 
communicating 
how the compo-
nents of information 
sets are grouped.
(Dis)organization and proximity
Justified typesetting has been a longstanding convention 
since the invention of moveable type (and, in calligraphy, 
even earlier) for no better reasons than it being easier to lock 
up a justified form in letterpress and the opinion (not mine) 
that it looks better. Esthetics notwithstanding, the preference 
for rivers of white space in the body of a column rather than 
a ragged right edge (in Western languages) is in most cases 
not an important issue, regardless of the high level of pas-
sion attached to it.
However, in tables of contents (print or screen), lists, menus, 
stock quotes, sports scores, and—in the past—telephone 
directories, flush left–flush right has real implications.
In any arrangement of text or groups of text, there is figure 
and ground, positive and negative, information and empty 
space. How that information and that empty space is con-
figured makes it easier or more difficult to see relationships 
and to understand the information. White space often has 
the unintended consequence of separating text items that 
should be read together and grouping items together that 
belong in different categories or relate to text in different 
columns.  
The long tradition of flush left–flush right is often the cause 
of ambiguity and confusion, in the horizontal displays of 
sports scores—where there is often very little time to relate 
the numerical score to the team to which it belongs—and 
in tables of contents with multiple columns. Illogical vertical 
spacing can impede the correct association of elements with 
each other, in menus with multiple languages, for example.
Leader rules—those annoying strings of dots often seen 
in tables of contents—recognize the inherent problem of 
certain flush left–flush right situations without solving it: they 
make each connection marginally clearer but do nothing to 
enhance the overall sense of order and logic of the page and 
reduce reading time.
Read Jan Tschichold. Asymmetric Typography.
See also Too many numbers.
Sports score displays on tele-
vision are among the worst 
offenders in the confusing and 
counterintuitive use of flush 
left–flush right alignments. In 
the original at left, I first see “3 
Indians”; it is only with some 
effort that I unscramble the true 
score: “Orioles 3, Indians 8.”
The revision below it respects 
our intuitive tendency to group 
by proximity to see two groups 
of two items each.
The Museum of Modern Art has 
recently placed labels for art 
on the walls a bit away from 
the art itself, presumably to 
reduce distraction. At the same 
time, the label for free-standing 
sculpture is immediately adja-
cent to the painting’s label. One 
may assume that the two labels 
both refer to the painting on 
the wall.
Maybe not perfect, but close 
enough, the “football” scores 
on BBC-World. While it does not 
conform to everyone’s way of 
describing a score, the centered 
panel gives an immediate 
overview of the match—almost 
without regard to the partici-
pants, who are second in the 
hierarchy—in an efficient, intui-
tive way: “Novara 2–1 Lazio.” 
I would like to see the winner 
always on the left, unless this 
arrangement is a clue to home 
and away teams.

Rational hierarchies
We can be 
overwhelmed by  
the typographic 
options available 
to us when we 
can control them. 
Designing in the 
real world, where 
font choice (and cut) 
are often extremely 
constrained, 
requires discipline, 
commitment, and 
imagination.
When you fill a prescription at a pharmacy, accompanying 
the drug will be a medical leaflet that carries the usual 
prescription information that’s on the bottle (your name, 
prescribing doctor’s name, name of drug, strength of drug, 
quantity, number of times per day, and—if the drug is a sop­
orific—a small label not to operate heavy machinery), as well 
as up to several pages of detailed information, not particu­
larly well organized, really repetitive, boring, and with only 
the most rudimentary sense of a hierarchy of importance. 
Inasmuch as these leaflets (also called patient information 
leaflets) are required so that the patient uses the drug cor­
rectly and understands dosages, side effects, and what to do 
in case of a negative drug reaction, it would stand to reason 
that they be designed to be clear, legible and easily readable, 
and with a clear sense of a hierarchy of importance.
Redesigning these brochures is not as easy as it may seem, if 
one is designing to the world’s reality rather than a typog­
rapher’s esthetic. Although these leaflets are written by the 
pharmaceutical manufacturer using what seems to be a 
somewhat unsophisticated template, their design and pro­
duction are extremely constrained. The students discovered 
at least three variants of size, form, output device, and font, 
and they designed to those three, without any confidence 
that there aren’t additional templates and output devices 
waiting to be addressed.
Information design is the application of form appropriate 
to content and user. So the students acted as copy editors 
as well as designers (if there’s really a difference), rewriting 
the words, creating a textual as well as visual hierarchy, and 
staging the information so that it would have the greatest 
usefulness. They designed three specific formats for three 
pharmaceuticals of varying complexity and potential risk.

needs; Staging information.

What is COUMADIN
COUMADIN (Warfarin)
WARNING:
Warfarin sodium can cause major or fatal bleeding.
Bleeding is more likely to occur during the starting period and with a higher does ( resulting in a higher INR). 
Risk factors for bleeding include high intensity of the anticoagulation (INR> 4.0),  Age ≥65, highly variable 
INRs, history of gastrointestinal bleeding, hyperstension, cerebrovascular disease, serious heart disease, anemia, 
malignancy, trauma renal insufﬁ ciency, concomitant drugs, and long duration of warfarin theraphy.
When you 
must not 
take it:
This leaﬂ et answers some common questions asked about COUMADIN. It does not contain all the available 
information about COUMADIN. Keep this leaﬂ et with the medicine. You may want to read it again later.
COUMADIN contains an active ingredi-
ent called “warfarin”. It helps to prevent 
blood from excessive clotting or form-
ing harmful clots. This type of medica-
tion is called an anticoagulant. Some 
people refer to anticoagulant medicines 
as “blood thinners”. 
Excessive clotting sometimes occurs 
when physical mobility is low. If exces-
sive clotting s not treated, it can lead 
to serious health problems such as 
strokes or heart attacks.
There are two brands of warfarin. They 
are called COUMADIN and MAREVAN. 
Do not swap from one brand to the 
other. You should not combine these 
brands.
COUMADIN tablets contain 1 mg, 2 mg 
or 5 mg of warfarin sodium as the ac-
tive ingredient. The other ingredients in 
COUMADIN are:
Lactose Anhydrous
Starch - Tapioca
Stearic Acid
Magnesium Stearate (470)
Amaranth (123) 
Indigo Carmine (132)
Brilliant Blue FCF (133)
Quinoline Yellow (104)
COUMADIN contains NO sucrose, 
gluten or tartrazine.

Ingredients:
Treatment:
During pregnancy. Taking COUMADIN 
during pregnancy may harm the devel-
oping baby.
If you are considering becoming preg-
nant or it is possible for you to become 
pregnant while taking COUMADIN, tell 
your doctor who can help you weigh 
the beneﬁ ts of taking COUMADIN 
against the possible risks. 
If you have had an allergic reaction to: 
Warfari, Any of the other ingredients in 
COUMADIN listed in the beginning of 
this leaﬂ et, MAREVAN (another brand 
of warfarin). Some of the symptoms of 
an allergic reaction may include: itchy 
skin rash; difﬁ culty breathing; swelling 
of the face and tongue. 
If you have bleeding tendencies or ab-
normal blood cells. COUMADIN may 
make bleeding tendencies worse.
If you have moderate to severe high 
blood pressure. The risk of bleeding 
in this situation may be increased by 
taking COUMADIN.
After the expiry date. (EXP) printed on 
the bottle. It may have no effect at all, 
or worse, an entirely unexpected effect 
if you take it after the expiry date.
If the packaging is torn or shows signs 
of tampering.

An intelligible ballot
It’s not the voting 
that’s democracy, 
it’s the counting.
Tom Stoppard
Jumpers
When integrating 
instructions and 
a grid of choices, it 
is helpful to break 
the process into 
simple, discrete, 
sequential steps.
Read Marcia Lausen. Design for 
Democracy: Ballot and Election 
Design.

Rational hierarchies; Under­
standing audience needs.
We all learned what a dysfuctional ballot is in the 2000 
presidential election. That is unlikely to happen again 
anytime soon, but ballot designs in the United States—and 
certainly in Philadelphia—are not likely to win any prizes 
for clarity and intuitiveness. There are a number of reasons, 
and it is hard to assign blame, but—not completely unlike 
Philadelphia’s parking signs, discussed on pages 26–27—one 
suspects a combination of the absence of designer input 
upstream, the impracticality of frequent hardware updates, 
the costs of making changes to off-the-shelf software 
bundled with expensive hardware, and—let’s not forget this 
one—politics.
The existing voting machines in Philadelphia are not new 
and come fully equipped with an extremely constraining 
application utilizing a rigid grid and painful uniformity of 
type fonts and sizes. This prevents both communicative 
typography and the use of effective negative space to com­
municate a hierarchy of information; so, rather than being 
able to create different relationships between rows and 
columns, one is left with a structure of uniform boxes with 
identical horizontal and vertical bounding lines.
Add to this (and this is no one’s fault, unless you count 
human nature) the fact that the importance of a candidate’s 
placement on the ballot is documented. As a result, each 
candidate’s position on the grid is chosen by lot (not unlike 
the drawing for dorm rooms and roommates in college), 
rather than by any sensible or logical order.
In their analysis, which they 
prepared in both digital and print 
form, the students identified and 
addressed the following issues:
•  A difficult-to-understand grid 
because of the visual similarity of 
rows and columns;
•  Inadequate distinction between 
office, party, and candidates’ 
names;
• Redundant information;
• The square indication for the 
button does not look like a 
button, which is usually round;
 • Confusing instructions because 
they are not clearly worded, set in 
too small a font, and containing 
useless noninformation;
•  Ballot questions are aligned 
center, making them difficult to 
read, and there is no typographic 
differentiation between English 
and Spanish;
• The vote button is out of the user’s 
normal field of vision.
The students perceived that 
voting is a three-step process:
• Choose and select your 
candidates;
• Read and select your answers to 
the questions;
• Push the “vote” button to register 
your vote.

Understanding audience needs
Trying to under-
stand the needs of 
the user and the 
context in which 
the design is used 
will foster a deeper 
understanding of 
design function and 
empathy with the 
user.

Life of the Great American School 
System: How Testing and Choice Are 
Undermining Education.

ballot; Staging information.
“Special needs” is one of the euphemistic descriptions for chil­
dren (and adults) who have difficulty functioning in the world 
occupied by—and meeting the expectations of—the majority 
of us. Each child’s particular personality characteristic that leads 
to difficulty and corresponding educational need must be 
communicated to his parent or guardian in an understandable, 
meaningful, and effective way. Often, the parent, too, has diffi­
culty understanding this information for any number of reasons, 
such as concern and anxiety for the child, limited educational 
attainment, language skills, jargon used in the report, and the 
form’s intimidating density and complexity. It is well known that 
students whose teachers request a special needs evaluation are 
disproportionately male and of racial or ethnic minorities.
The current form used by the School District of Philadelphia 
appears to be written for, as well as by, the evaluators who 
gave and analyzed the tests and the teachers who initiated the 
evaluation. 
The design students approached this form by thinking of the 
user and what would help parents understand information 
about their child that at best is complex, terminologically 
arcane, and carries with it highly emotional baggage. Their 
solution, compared to the form currently in use, utilizes rational 
and transparent organization, typographic hierarchy, and the 
visualization of numbers—absent in the current evaluation 
template—especially important in a report where tests are 
scored on the basis of 130 rather than the familiar 100.

innovations by the students 
was to explain in very simple

and student are. A navigational

the reader is in the report by 
section.

extremely important aspect of 
the students’ design is a series of

The final proposed dashboard, 
featuring a rational orga­
nizational structure and an 
absolutely clear visual explana­
tion of performance relative to 
target goals.
The original hospital dashboard 
in use at the time—with simu­
lated data—is characterized 
by inconsistent and counter­
intuitive bar charts and other 
ambiguities.
An alternative solution, using a 
horizontal rather than a vertical 
“0” line. Forcing the type into 
a nearly vertical orientation 
was felt to make reading dif­
ficult and constrain ease of use, 
although the vertical bars were 
a helpful element related to our 
conventions for the y-axis..

of information

It is extremely important for hospitals to maintain and com­
municate a wide range of performance issues on a regular 
and frequent basis, with the least amount of lag between 
the period of analysis and internal posting. A hospital agreed 
to let a team of students tackle its “dashboard,” the internal 
document to which all physicians and staff have access, and 
which is used to gauge continued improvement, progress 
toward goals, and revised performance benchmarks.
The existing dashboard exhibited serious symptoms of 
information overload, and was characterized by ambiguous 
and inconsistent notation and too many numbers. One of 
the most confusing aspects was that good performance and 
bad performance relative to goals was sometimes on the 
left and sometimes on the right of the bar graph, depending 
on whether the target performance was a high number or a 
low number. The first change the students made was to set a 
hypothetical vertical target line (not unlike a “0”) from which 
a negative performance bar (always red) moved to the left 
and a positive performance bar (always green) moved to the 
right. Type was legibly and uniformly structured, with data 
categories and subcategories clearly differentiated.
Recognizing that different user segments needed different 
depths of detail, the students placed the trend graph and 
related numerical data on a category-specific pop-up 
activated by a rollover. This maintained an accessible and 
unthreatening overall appearance to the dashboard while 
providing access to the same amount of detail that existed 
on the original.

Top row. Between 1974 and 
1979, the AIGA, in collaboration 
with the U.S. Department of 
Transportation, produced 50 
standard symbols to be used 
on signs.
From the perspective of 2012, 
the symbols with people appear 
stiff and clunky. In recent years, 
institutions, notably museums, 
have redrawn these pictogram 
sets so that the people are less 
blocky and more animated. 
In the center row is the set of 
pictograms from the Museum 
of Modern Art in New York. 
The person in the wheelchair is 
particularly animated, instead 
of sitting passively and motion­
less. Additionally, MOMA has 
added a family pictogram.
Bottom row. Le Centre Pom­
pidou in Paris uses its own 
family of pictograms, char­
acterized by the upper body 
rendered as negative space. As 
is true for many sets of symbols 
utilizing the human figure, 
interpretation becomes more 
difficult as activities are added 
(later, it appears). The Pom­
pidou pictograms often work, 
and sometimes they work less 
well; sometimes their subjects 
appear to be in bathing suits. 
The pictograms at far left are 
used in the Museo d’Arte Con­
temporanea Donnaregina in 
Naples. Within their restricted 
applications, they are both ele­
gant and appropriate for their 
environment. It would be inter­
esting to see efforts to broaden 
the pictogram set using the 
same vocabulary.

Synechdoche
Bathroom pictograms are an excellent example of synec­
doche, where the entire human figure—specific to gender 
(always), age (sometimes), and disability (always)—is used to 
describe the location of toilets. This custom of synecdoche 
is universal, notwithstanding designer jokes using sexual 
organs or other gender toileting differences. 
Between 1974 and 1979, the AIGA, in collaboration with the 
U.S. Department of Transportation, produced 50 standard 
symbols to be used on signs, among them man, woman, 
baby, and wheelchair. The pictograms were clear, used a 
minimum of geometrically drawn shapes, made a harmo­
nious “alphabet,”­ and appeared to be culturally universal (a 
monumental achievement). They were also of their time, 
a bit static, clunky, and lacking in elegance. Consequently, 
and not surprisingly, subtle rogue and enhanced redesigns 
began to arise, often by museums and cultural institutions, 
perhaps in an effort to individualize their vocabulary of visual 
symbols.
The choice of a visual vocabulary for bathroom pictograms 
carries the risk that it will not be adequately adaptable to an 
expanded symbol set unanticipated when the vocabulary 
was originally developed: there is a significant difference 
between developing a pictographic vocabulary of four 
people who are standing or in a wheelchair and a set of 
symbols of people doing things (holding the escalator rail, 
pushing strollers). The complete breadth of the symbol set 
for the Olympic games is known in advance, as was the 
extent of the Mexico City subway in 1968, so the designer 
can develop a vocabulary that will work in every component 
pictogram.
The Pioneer F spacecraft, des­
tined to be the first man-made 
object to escape from the solar 
system into interstellar space 
and launched in 1972, carries 
a pictorial plaque (a detail is 
shown at left). Suggested by 
Eric Burgess, the graphics were 
devised by Carl Sagan and 
Frank Drake in only three weeks. 
Some opposition was directed 
at the portrayal of a naked man 
and woman, described by one 
critic as “sending smut to the 
stars.”

toileting pictograms that have 
come my way over the years,

The meaning of this pictogram 
in Barcelona is not difficult to 
figure out, given the limited 
number of options. Its drawing, 
however, might suggest some­
thing very different if taken 
out of context. For example, if 
your dog poops, smash your 
fist into it; or, if walking with a 
dog, stop to admire piles of little 
cannonballs.
No walking on water.
The David H. Koch Hall of 
Human Origins in Washington 
includes this 30,000-year-old 
handprint from France.
This pictograph is one of a set 
of medical facility pictograms 
developed by a partnership 
between Hablamos Juntos and 
SEGD. The review committee—
just as the review committee 
for AIGA Symbol Sign some 
35 years earlier—reads like 
a Who’s Who of information 
design. That said, and with 
all due respect, many of them 
don’t work for me, including 
this one, for Outpatient Ser­
vices. Although I’ve never had 
a broken arm, my guess that it  
would be set at the Emergency 
Room.
Olympic pictogram sets are 
a fascinating study in design 
intelligence, design playfulness, 
and every designer’s desire to 
create something new, better, 
and at the very least different 
from what was designed four 
years previously.
Some sets are clearly better 
than others—with a more 
coherent vocabulary, an 
absence of excessive decoration, 
and the sense of movement and 
action characteristic of almost 
all sports. 
Below is a comparison of five 
sports from 11 of the Olympic 
pictogram sets.
Could there be a greater joy 
than designing a set of picto­
grams for an Olympics? It’s a 
win-win:
All the human figures are the 
same;
The audience knows the actions 
being depicted;
The designer knows all the 
variations before beginning 
the set;
The set is complete when the 
designer finishes it;
No surprises. (Well, there are 
always surprises, but not by 
definition in this case.)

Is a picture worth 1,000 words?
The universal 
intelligibility 
of a pictogram 
is inversely 
proportional to 
its complexity 
and potential 
for interpretive 
ambiguity. 
As the complexity of our world 
increases, along with the need to 
communicate more complex ideas, 
regulations, services, objects, and 
processes, the risk of compromised 
intelligibility increases propor­
tionately if not exponentially. A 
pictogram that has to be learned is 
not intuitive enough to transcend 
language barriers; how and where 
will the learning take place?

Synecdoche.
Pictograms have always been used to compensate for an 
absence of text because of illiteracy or language differences 
(or, in the case of cave paintings—the original pictograms—
the absence of written language altogether). The efficacy of 
pictograms can be compromised by multiple factors:
• Ambiguity or misinterpretation due to weak drawing or 
unrecognizable simplification (not looking like what it’s sup­
posed to mean);
• Ambiguity or misinterpretation due to simplification (looking 
like something different in the user’s experience than in the 
designer’s experience);
• Offense or confusion caused by misinterpretation due to 
cultural or religious differences or beliefs.
We have all received e-mails or links that show pictograms 
so absurd that we have no idea whether they are real or not. 
The pictographic movement (if you will) is based on the need 
to communicate across language, literacy, and cultural differ­
ences as the world becomes more international and travel to 
lands with different languages—even different alphabets—is 
continually increasing.
Like many design movements, this one’s reach may exceed 
its grasp. Original pictographic and ideographic writing and 
drawing was developed and used within a homogeneous 
and comparatively small cultural universe, in ancient and 
medieval times made even smaller by literacy limited to 
upper and priestly classes. The concern for the safety and 
comfort of travelers that gave us the USDOT pictograms in 
the 1970s utilized a simple visual vocabulary to communicate 
simple concepts: a wheelchair, a baby, a flight of stairs, an 
escalator, a fork and knife, a cup of coffee. Nothing unfamiliar 
or conceptually challenging there.
Pictographs are now applied to increasingly complex actions 
and movements. Some of these require complete frontal and 
side views of people doing things and interacting with others 
and with objects and equipment that may not be recogniz­
able in other countries and cultures (or even in our own). As 
a result, the pictography movement, particularly in health 
care contexts, may be approaching (or in some cases have 
exceeded) the limits of its communicative abilities. 
5
This pictogram (from Paris) is 
problematic for two reasons: 
the frontal view attempts to 
illustrate walking by making 
one leg appear shorter than the 
other; the holding of hands may 
be ambiguously suggestive of 
an improper relationship. I have 
always described this graphic 
as “Men with one leg shorter 
than the other may not kidnap 
young girls with one leg shorter 
than the other.”
Many more recent signs with 
the same message  show the 
two figures no longer holding 
hands.
This joke pictogram is one of 15 
appearing in Print Magazine 
sometime in the ‘80s, date and 
designer untraceable. This one 
is “Village made entirely from 
soap, 5 kilometers.” The bath­
room pictograms in this set are 
exactly what you would expect.

307.1 General. Protruding objects shall comply with 307.
307.2 Protrusion Limits. Objects with leading edges more than 27 inches (685 mm) 
and not more than 80 inches (2030 mm) above the finish floor or ground shall protrude 
4 inches (100 mm) maximum horizontally into the circulation path.
EXCEPTION: Handrails shall be permitted to protrude 4½ inches (115 mm) 
maximum.
Advisory 307.2 Protrusion Limits. When a cane is used and the element is in the 
detectable range, it gives a person sufficient time to detect the element with the 
cane before there is body contact. Elements located on circulation paths, includ-
ing operable elements, must comply with requirements for protruding objects. For 
example, awnings and their supporting structures cannot reduce the minimum 
required vertical clearance. Similarly, casement windows, when open, cannot en-
croach more than 4 inches (100 mm) into circulation paths above 27 inches (685 
mm).
Figure 307.2 Limits of Protruding Objects 
307.3 Post-Mounted Objects. Free-standing objects mounted on posts or pylons shall 
overhang circulation paths 12 inches (305 mm) maximum when located 27 inches (685 
mm) minimum and 80 inches (2030 mm) maximum above the finish floor or ground. 
Where a sign or other obstruction is mounted between posts or pylons and the clear dis-
tance between the posts or pylons is greater than 12 inches (305 mm), the lowest edge of 
such sign or obstruction shall be 27 inches (685 mm) maximum or 80 inches (2030 mm) 
minimum above the finish floor or ground.
EXCEPTION: The sloping portions of handrails serving stairs and ramps shall not 
be required to comply with 307.3.

than 80 inches (2030 mm) high. The leading edge of such guardrail or barrier shall be 
located 27 inches (685 mm) maximum above the finish floor or ground.
EXCEPTION: Door closers and door stops shall be permitted to be 78 inches (1980

“‘Signage and the 2010 ADA 
Standards for Accessible Design’ 
is a document conceived out of 
the frustration of having to pro­
cess too much complicated text. 
Designers, architects, engineers, 
and other planners tend to be 
visually oriented people. From 
napkin sketches to architectural 
plans and shop drawings, we 
think and speak in a visual 
language as we imagine and 
build visual things—even for 
the use of those with vision 
impairment. The document is 
an experiment in making a text-
heavy code easier to read and 
use by aligning its visual form 
with how designers think and 
work (visually). The intended 
goal is facilitating the design 
process to better facilitate 
answering the needs of people 
with disabilities.”

Bureaucracies are by definition self-perpetuating and, like 
the universe, expanding. Bureaucrats maintain their jobs by 
expanding their areas of oversight, developing standards and 
guidelines, and writing manuals of continually increasing 
length to communicate them.
The public needs to be protected from less than compe­
tent design; really good designers (even moderately good 
designers) need to be able to design for the public good 
with both baseline performance and place specificity that 
contribute so much to the surprise and delight of travel.
How do you design performance guidelines that commu­
nicate the performance without the necessity of designing 
examples that communities (and states) will interpret as 
designs rather than as examples of performance criteria?
Problems arise, I believe, when examples illustrating per­
formance criteria and objectives become confused with 
mandated, or even recommended, designs themselves. At 
this point community vehicular wayfinding signs in Omaha 
will look the same as they do in New Hampshire, which, 
regardless of quality, will get boring quickly. Any designer of 
information needs to seriously consider how to distinguish 
the performance criteria from the design, and so do the 
FHWA and state departments of transportation.
How much do you want the 
government helping you 
design? ADA guidelines and the 
MUTCD (Manual on Uniform 
Traffic Control Devices, pub­
lished by the Federal Highway 
Administration) both offer 
rational guidelines that have 
been exhaustively researched 
and tested. They are valuable 
tools that, respectively, help 
promote the integration of the 
disabled into our society, and 
ensure legibility and consis­
tency in our country’s network 
of interstate highways.

Focus and distraction
Multitasking is an activity that—bombarded by an ever-
increasing amount of stimuli—we seem to be getting better 
at, at the very least as a survival strategy. The inability to mul­
titask used to be described, in a simpler day, as being unable 
to walk and chew gum at the same time. For many of us, 
certain kinds of multitasking is simple—reading with music 
in the background, for example; other kinds of multitasking 
are more difficult.
One of the more challenging examples of multitasking is 
to read text and listen to a lecture at the same time, and to 
absorb and understand both fully. Yet, we continue to create 
and attend presentations with text heavy slides and/or 
complex graphics on the screen while the speaker is reading 
those words (or others) and then expounding on them in 
detail. How do the members of the audience comprehend 
both simultaneously? The answer is, they don’t.
Much has been written about the constraints on Power­
point-like slideshows required for effective communication, 
yet slides with a mind-numbing number of words keep 
being projected while the presenter’s voice drones on.
In a room not so dark that it encourages the audience to 
fall asleep, a subject-only slide, or only a graph needing 
visualization, are reasonable limitations to help the audience 
understand complementary information being presented 
orally and visually simultaneously, reducing the risk of mutual 
interference.

Politeness and fascism. There 
are many ways to express a 
prohibition. “Interdite” and 
“vietato”—forbidden, prohib­
ited—are on the familiarly 
strong side. The pictogram 
is neutral and engaging. The 
British are always polite. My 
favorite, second from the top, 
is in the Place des Vosges in 
Paris—“The grass is resting.”
When typesetters set our type, they were trained to know 
the difference between a foot mark and an apostrophe, 
between an apostrophe and a beginning single quote, and 
between a hyphen and a dash (en or em).
The computer has rendered some of those distinctions 
moot, often depending on the knowledge and education of 
the typist and the sophistication of the application (which 
the typist has to know how to control). Word completion 
software has not made life any easier for those texts on a 
complicated subject with its own specific (and generally 
unfamiliar, at least to the application) vocabulary.

Many think, in 
general, that serif 
fonts work better 
at book size and 
that sans serif fonts 
work better at 
headline, or poster, 
size. This sweeping 
generalization, 
while not entirely 
without merit, 
reveals the crucial 
importance of 
context.
Sans serif
Fonts have many characteristics; some of them contribute to 
legibility and some don’t. In all cases, legibility is determined 
by the font’s use and by its context.
The sans serif fonts shown here, a selection including some 
recent variants of earlier classics, and one font recently devel­
oped for highway use, reveal different relationships:
•  of x-height­—the height of a lowercase x—to nominal size—
the size in points of the font, originally the height of the lead 
slug on which the letter was positioned; 
•  of x-height relative to ascenders and descenders; 
•  of letter width relative to both x-height and nominal size; 
•  of stylistic attributes visible in lowercase a, g (single and 
double story) e, j, l, and t; 
•  the way the font is letterspaced using its normal spacing 
tables; 
•  the way the characters are drawn so that they are not 
confused with each other under less than optimal 
circumstances.
Sans serif fonts are often considered to be more appropriate 
in larger sizes and less appropriate for large quantities of text 
than serif fonts.

Franklin Gothic was designed 
by Morris Fuller Benton in 1902,

are its double-story g and 
the ear of that letter. John­

The uppercase T is usually an 
excellent font identifier. The 
difference between serif fonts is 
often more dramatic than sans 
serif fonts. 
Garamond 3—based on a 
font by Jean Jannon cut in 
1621— was made by Thomas 
Maitland Cleland and Morris 
Fuller Benton for American Type 
Founders in 1919. Minion was 
designed as a digital font for 
Adobe in 1990 by Robert Slim­
bach; it has some of the old face 
characteristics of Garamond 3, 
but it has a larger x-height.
Giambattista Bodoni (1740–
1813) lends his name to a large 
variety of fonts influenced by 
Baskerville’s work—but with 
greater extremes of thick and 
thin—and the fonts of Firmin 
Didot. Many digital fonts with 
this characteristic exhibit 
“dazzle” on-screen at text sizes, 
of which Didot is a perfect 
example. 
Palatino, originally designed 
by Hermann Zapf in 1948, is 
named after the 16th-century 
master of calligraphy Giambat­
tista Palatino. Renaissance in 
inspiration, Palatino is more 
calligraphic in feeling than 
many similar fonts. 
Melior, designed by Hermann 
Zapf in 1952, expresses his ideas 
about the squared-off circle. 
Times Roman was designed in 
1932 by Cameron S. Latham of 
Monotype (England), commis­
sioned by The Times of London 
in response to a critical article 
by Stanley Morison about 
the newspaper’s typography. 
Morison supervised the design, 
based on Plantin, which The 
Times had used for 40 years. 
Times’s ubiquity has made 
it unpopular in typophile 
circles at different times. It 
was used to dramatic effect by 
Dugald Stermer in the ’60s in 
Ramparts and other New Left 
publications.

The Origin of the Serif
Serif fonts­—originating with the Roman alphabet—are 
widely considered to be more legible than sans serif fonts 
for large quantities of text, especially in small sizes and more 
decisively in print than on screen. Better screen technology 
and more careful typesetting are mitigating the arguable dif­
ferences, and it has long been clear that sloppy and careless 
typesetting can damage the legibility of even the most well-
drawn typefaces. Serif fonts offer a broader range of stylistic 
opportunity to the font designer, as the almost inexhaustible 
range of serif treatments reveals.
With their long history, serif fonts are thought to have a 
richer palette of connotations than sans serif fonts.
Note that the font specimens on this page are 18 point and, 
for the most part, are smaller than the sans serif font speci­
mens on the preceding spread, which are 15 point.

Caslon 540 was designed by the 
staff of American Type Founders 
in 1902 based on the work of 
William Caslon (1692–1766), 
much of whose work is based 
on the fonts of Christoffel Van 
Dyck. It exists in many variants 
for metal, phototype, and the 
web. Baskerville represents

attempt to improve on Caslon’s 
work.

Walbaum, originally designed 
in 1800 by Justus Erich Wal­

the Bodoni family, with a large 
x-height, wide letterspacing, 
and quirks in, for example, low­
ercase b, k, and q.  
Complete inscription and detail

are the basis of modern serif

Century Expanded was 
designed by Linn Boyd Benton 
in 1894 for The Century Maga­
zine, which needed a more 
legible typeface. Century has a 
large x-height and slightly con­
densed proportions. Named for 
the Clarendon Press in Oxford, 
Clarendon was created by 
Robert Besley in 1845. Reworked 
in 1935 by Monotype and in 
1953 by Hermann Eidenbenz, it 
was used by the U.S. National 
Park Service on signs until 2008, 
and can be seen in the logos 
of Sony, Wells Fargo, and the 
Spanish newspaper El Pais.

Font width at a given point size. 
Nominal point size has become 
a misnomer. When letters were 
made from brass punches or 
cast in lines from matrices, the 
nominal size of the font—e.g., 
10 point—was the size of the 
length of the metal “slug” from 
top to bottom. Depending 
on the font, the total letter 
height—from the top of the 
ascender to the bottom of the 
descender—may or may not 
have filled the slug. The space 
on the slug that is not used for 
ascender or descender is called 
the “shoulder.”

given line width for the same

Font efficiency
Font efficiency is no 
guarantee of overall 
legibility or general 
suitability for the 
purpose.
Different fonts allow a different number of characters to fit in 
a given amount of space.
Some of the font characteristics that determine a font’s 
efficiency—other things being equal— are:
•  Character width: a narrower character width will accommo­
date more characters in a given measure.
•  X-height: a smaller x-height will accommodate more charac­
ters in a given measure.
•  Type size relative to slug size: a typeface whose total height 
(ascender to descender) is smaller on the slug height 
(nominal font size, e.g., 10 points) will accommodate more 
characters in a given measure.
Read Andrew Robinson. The Story of Writing: Alphabets, Hieroglyphs, & 
Pictograms, Second Edition.
Some observations on particular 
fonts:
•  Helvetica is relatively expanded 
(wide), has a large x-height, and is 
very large on its slug.
•  Meta is relatively condensed.
•  Garamond 3 is relatively 
expanded and has a small 
x-height, with tall ascenders; it is 
very small, ascender to descender, 
on its slug.
•  Times Roman is somewhat 
condensed but has a large 
x-height with short ascenders and 
descenders.

Typographic differentiation
“True” small caps—
drawn as part of the 
font—are different 
in proportion as 
well as in size. They 
are proportionately 
wider than full 
caps scaled down 
uniformly.
Just has colors have characteristics of differentiation—hue, 
value, chroma, pattern—so do typefaces have size, slant, 
weight, width, and caps.
•  Size: The smaller a font is used, the more letterspacing 
(tracking) may be desirable for legibility.
•  Italics: It is important to use true italic rather than computer-
generated italic (skewed roman), as the drawing of the 
characters is significantly different.
•  Weight: In type design (as in life), you can only get so bold 
before the character of the font begins to change. Some 
fonts are more legible in extremely bold and extremely light 
weights than others.
•  Condensed fonts are efficient but often need extra tracking 
for legibility. Extended fonts are not shown in this book 
because, as they are neither efficient nor particularly legible, 
their role in information design is limited.
•  A body of text set in all caps, caps/small caps, or all small caps 
will always be less legible than text set in caps/lowercase. 
Worthy of consideration is whether lining (uppercase) figures 
will be more effective in context than old-style (lowercase) 
figures or the opposite.
The typeface used for these 
comparisons is Thesis, designed 
by Lucas de Groot between 
1994 and 1999. If only its 
lowercase “l” had a curl at the 
bottom, like Meta, it would be 
just about perfect.
Far left. In this typeface, as in 
most others, italics are slightly 
more condensed than roman.

than lowercase, as are upper­

shown here. (Thesis does not 
have an expanded width.)

Legible small, a bit swollen 
large. Named for 16th-century 
punchcutter Claude Garamond, 
Garamond 3 has a long history 
of redrawings, misattributions, 
and revivals. Garamond 3 is 
particularly legible at book 
sizes. As it gets larger, the very 
idiosyncrasies that contribute 
to its elegance at smaller sizes 
make its serifs look chunky 
and soft.
Elegant large, not too legible 
small. Didot was developed by 
Firmin Didot (1764–1836) in the 
late 18th century. It is character­
ized by bold thick strokes and 
hairline thin strokes, not unlike 
some Bodonis. Used large and 
sparingly, Didot is the pinnacle 
of elegance. At book scale, the 
sparkling fineness of the thin 
strokes, especially when they 
are not thickened by the let­
terpress process, makes it less 
legible.
Legible light, only semi-legible 
ultra bold. Gill Sans, designed 
by sculptor, graphic artist, and 
type designer Eric Gill, was 
released in 1928. Inspired by 
Johnston Underground (shown 
on page 138), Gill Sans is more 
eccentric in its inconsistencies 
and between light and ultra 
bold, than most sans serif fonts. 
Gill’s desire was to make an 
extremely legible typeface for 
both text and display, but its 
Ultra Bold is barely legible at 
book sizes.
Legible bold, not very leg­
ible really thin. Now a film 
star in its own right, Helvetica 
was designed in 1957 by Max 
Miedinger with Eduard Hoff­
mann at the Haas type foundry 
in Münchenstein, Switzerland. 
Originally named Neue Haas 
Grotesk, its name was changed 
in 1960 to the word meaning 
“Swiss.” The intent was to 
create a typeface that had 
great clarity and no intrinsic 
formal meaning. Recent weight 
additions, particularly its two 
lightest weights, are difficult to 
read and are “normally” packed 
much too tight.
Full disclosure. None of these 
examples has been tracked or 
kerned.

Size matters (weight, too)
Font legibility is 
the function of 
many factors in 
addition to the way 
the font is designed 
and drawn, among 
which are: size 
at which used, 
letterspacing 
(tracking and 
kerning), leading, 
color, value, and 
especially context.
When type was made from hand-cut brass punches, it was 
by definition redrawn at each size.
Now that type is generated from a digital master, extremely 
subtle compensations for font size are largely non-existent. 
Also gone is the swelling of the thin strokes of type when 
a letterpress form physically struck the surface of pulpy, 
absorbent paper. And in many cases the very characteristics 
of the way a font was or is designed makes it more elegant 
and legible at some sizes than at others. 
Weight also matters in font legibility. Some fonts are too thin 
at their thinnest; some are too eccentric at their boldest. 
This is more often the case with serif fonts. Sans serif fonts, 
with their essentially regular stroke width, more comfortably 
move from light to bold and from small to large with little 
sacrifice in legibility. Gill Sans, at left, is one exception. This 
is not to say that Gill Sans Ultra Bold, Neuland, Kabel, and 
other fonts are not beautiful and interesting in the way they 
resolve their eccentricities as they get bolder, just that those 
eccentricities that compromise legibility only marginally at 
text weights are more difficult to resolve as the typeface 
becomes bolder.

Legibility
Students: Your 
other instructors 
will never tell you 
that the size at 
which type looks its 
most elegant is just 
a little too small to 
read comfortably.
This spread represents an effort to assemble and demon­
strate many of the issues that affect legibility in typesetting. 
While some examples are exaggerated, they represent a 
reasonably fair collection of issues that affect basic use 
of type. In information design, where data may be dense, 
complex, and require careful study, clear, legible typography 
is extremely important.
Read Erik Spiekermann. Stop Stealing Sheep.
Very thin strokes reversed out of 
a dark color tend to fill in and 
appear to sparkle.
Didot
Type reversed out of a dark 
color tends to look bolder. 
The Sans Extra Bold
Old-style (or lowercase) figures 
have ascenders and descenders 
and an x-height. They increase 
legibility compared to lining 
(upper-case) figures for the 
same reason that text in upper 
and lowercase is more legible 
than text in all caps: readers 
identify words and groups of 
numbers by their non-uniform 
profile. Old-style figs (as they 
are called) also call less atten­
tion to themselves in a block of 
text set in caps-lowercase.
It is interesting that to a large 
degree, especially in sans serif 
fonts, the old-style numerals 
3–9 are essentially lining figures 
positioned relative to the base­
line so as to have ascenders and 
descenders. The numerals, 1, 
2, and 0, however, are signifi­
cantly different from their lining 
counterparts and have a height 
equal to the font’s x-height.
Garamond 3, above left, is 
unusual in that its lowercase 1 
looks like a roman numeral, and 
its lowercase 0 (zero) has no 
stroke weight differentiation.
Many fonts do not have old-
style figures.

raphy, has long channeled 
vernacular design.
This 1949 English boxing poster 
represents a genre of vernacular  
design that flourished on both 
sides of the Atlantic for many 
decades. Derived from 19th-
century wood type, it reveals 
an unexpected typographic 
sensibility.

Expressive typography
Tibor Kalman was 
fascinated with 
boring typefaces.
“No, this one is too
clever, this one is 
too interesting,”
he kept saying 
when I showed 
him the fonts I 
was proposing for 
his monograph. 
Anything but a 
boring typeface, he 
felt, got in the way 
of the ideas.
Michael Bierut
During a seminar a few years ago, a student asked me, totally 
out of context, “What font should I use?” 
Apalled, but conscious of being gracious, I answered, “The 
right one for the job,” and took another question. 
Choosing a font can be a difficult decision, and the “right 
font” will combine the characteristics of legibility, context, 
connotation, and appropriateness. Beyond all that, there are 
fonts that are “drawn well” and those that are not. Well-drawn 
fonts—always a matter of opinion—meet those criteria. 
There are always cases, however, where “badly drawn” (in the 
conventional sense), grotesque (not Grotesk), semi-legible 
fonts serve a useful and effective purpose.



The right font will often be a balance of choosing between 
criteria that a particular font meets—for example, boldness, 
connotation, shock value, and the like.

It took far too long for the MLA to recognize, 
after the widespread adoption of the computer, 
that there was no longer any need to double 
space after periods.  The same holds true for 
underlining bibliographic citations, e.g., 
Designing Information.  Both were responses to 
the constraints of the typewriter. By the early 
’90s, even lower-school students were setting 
type with a facility that Gutenberg would have 
respected, and were able to italicize book 
titles, e.g., Designing Information.
Footnotes need to be legible, 
too. In this (excellent) book, the 
footnote notations in text are 
virtually illegible, due to their 
small size and extremely light 
weight.
One of the many entertaining 
fonts that mimic languages that 
use non-Roman characters.
Massimo Vignelli’s answer to 
font choice is to limit himself 
to the six “best” typefaces. 
Michael Bierut, who worked 
with Vignelli, describes the 
point of view: 
“For the first ten years of my 
career, I worked for Massimo 
Vignelli, a designer who is leg­
endary for using a very limited 
number of typefaces…. 
“For me, it became a time-
saving device. Why spend 
hours choosing between 
Bembo, Sabon, and Garamond 
No. 3 every time you needed a 
Venetian Roman?…
“Then, after a decade, I left my 
first job. Suddenly, I could use 
any typeface I wanted, and I 
went nuts. On one of my first 
projects, I used 37 different 
fonts on 16 pages. My wife, 
who had attended Catholic 
school herself, found this 
all too familiar…. She said, 
looking at one of my multiple 
font demolition derbies, ‘You’ve 
become a real slut, haven’t 
you?’”

Mistral), even engraved in wood,

Paris.

You are here—but 
which way are you 
facing?
The circle—the only totally non-
directional geometric shape—is a 
poor choice for “You are here” indi­
cators on non-heads-up maps.
What’s up? Heads up
Originally developed for use in military aircraft during World 
War II, and referring to a pilot’s being able to look forward 
with his head up (rather than down at instruments), “heads 
up” now also connotes a map in which the direction in which 
the viewer is facing is positioned at the top of the map. This 
enables the user to correlate directions on the map to the 
direction in which he is walking and needs to turn. Want to 
go somewhere that’s ahead and to the right on the map? 
Walk straight and to the right.
This is especially important in environmental maps (as 
opposed to printed maps that can stay with the user and be 
consulted frequently), as the retention time for maps in the 
environment is very short.
Heads-up displays (HUDs) were introduced into automo­
biles by General Motors in 1988. Now, of course, essentially 
all  automotive navigation system are heads-up. Many of us 
can remember the frustration of trying to read a paper map 
(north-up, of course) upside down or at a 90° angle, turned 
so that the direction of travel was at the top. And that was 
easy compared to rotating a sign fixed to a wall or pole or 
standing on your head. Even then, if the map isn’t heads up, 
there’s a 75% chance that the type will not be easy to read.
Heads-up pedestrian mapping has been a little longer in 
coming, and the author’s maps for Walk!Philadelphia in 1996 
were a reasonably early example.

These destination are neither

wayfinding designers would use 
arrows pointing up, meaning 
straight ahead, confident that 
the pedestrians looking for 
these destinations would not 
walk into a fence.
No, no, not down, you’re 
already underground. There is 
no further down in this location, 
although there may be stairs 
down to maintenance spaces. 
The down arrows in front of 
the up stair are particularly 
amusing.

Signs and arrows
It is sad but true 
today that most 
of us take our 
surroundings 
for granted…. 
Direction signs and 
street names…are 
as vital as a drop 
of oil in an engine, 
without which the 
moving parts would 
seize up.
Jock Kinneir
Arrows in wayfinding have two intrinsic meanings, the literal 
and the theoretical. 
Literal arrows mean that if you walk or drive in this direction 
you will be on your way to your destination, or at least to the 
next sign. This is practical information.
Theoretical arrows reference that some destination you may 
(or may not) be interested in is in a particular direction. It 
may be very distant, and your ability to get there on your 
own is very likely between difficult and impossible. The 
image at the bottom left of the facing page is an example.
Every culture has its own approach to arrows, which can be 
very confusing in a place that is not your own. For as long 
as I can remember, France and Italy used road signs whose 
arrow was the shape of the sign: directions were either 
to the left or to the right. This required turning the sign at 
much as 45° from your line of sight to indicate that you were 
to continue straight, thereby significantly decreasing the 
functionality  of the information. The U.K. loves roundabouts, 
and there is at least one example of a roundabout with five 
sub-roundabouts.
By definition, the arrow meaning straight ahead has to be 
either up or down. In the U.S., of course, the up-arrow means 
straight ahead; in France, however, it means the opposite. A 
long time ago I got completely lost in the Louvre, looking 
for the Nike of Samothrace, continually searching for down 
stairways (and taking them) instead of just walking straight 
ahead.
Theoretical arrows—not to be used either because of travel 
mode or the distances involved—on signposts these days 
are often intended to be playful, although at one time they 
were functional. Since the advent of ubiquitous air travel, 
they have become something of a nonfunctioning throw­
back: quaint, but in a way contradictory to experience. At any 
airport, all destinations lie in only one direction: the terminal.

Places.

Completed in 1989, Carbone 
Smolen Agency’s wayfinding 
plan for the Louvre used an 
ingenious gridded “neighbor­
hood” concept to accomplish 
the following objectives: 
“Easily locate the ‘greatest hits’; 
make an enormously com­
plicated piece of architecture 
understandable; and accom­
modate the movement of art 
as collections were relocated 
over time.
“To help visitors find the right 
‘neighborhood,’ an architec­
turally based numerical sign 
system keyed to a paper guide. 
The concept expanded to geo­
graphic zones or numbered 
‘arrondissements’ (like Paris 
itself) and included clusters of 
galleries….”
Recently, Ken Carbone wrote:
“This down arrow meaning 
straight confounds me and is 
the only thing I don’t love about 
Paris.”
Unfortunately, CSA’s system 
was replaced, and the Louvre’s 
current wayfinding system is 
confusing and ambiguous, not­
withstanding its delightful and 
entertaining prohibitory signs.

Scale and adjacency
Scales (as opposed 
to “scale”) can be 
helpful, if you’re 
good at visualizing 
the experiential 
nature of distances 
expressed 
numerically, or if 
you have a good 
ruler and calculator 
handy. Large  
numbers, whether 
they are the national 
debt or the length 
of time it takes to 
drive across Russia, 
become increasingly 
abstract in direct 
proportion to their 
size.
Who knew that South Carolina was next to South Dakota, 
and the same size?
Actually, we know better. But as you drive south or west from 
South Carolina, you’re in Georgia; if you drive north, you’re 
in North Carolina. Is the practice of organizing by alpha­
betization a remnant of an era when people drove across 
state lines less often; or of an era when one’s native state 
had more importance than it does now? Forty-eight of the 
United States’  fifty states are contiguous; you drive from one 
to the next regardless of its name. In fact, only seven states 
(Florida-Georgia; Illinois-Indiana-Iowa; Michigan-Minnesota) 
are adjacent to a state that precedes or follows it in alpha­
betical order.
Similarly confusing is that the scale of the South Carolina 
map is almost 50% larger than the map of South Dakota; in 
other words, South Dakota is almost 50% larger relative to 
South Carolina than it appears on these adjacent pages in 
the atlas on the facing page. So just how does one get an 
intuitive idea, without measuring and calculating, how long 
it would take to drive across one of these states?
The matter is complicated further by the fact that, in many 
road atlases, the thickness of the roads and the size of the 
type are the same regardless of the scale of the map. So, in 
the example at the left, if you enlarged South Dakota to the 
scale of South Carolina, the roads would be 50% thicker.

A spread from a recent Rand 
McNally road atlas, which 
exhibits several characteristics 
that could affect drivers not 
staying within a single state:
• The maps are of different scales, 
so it is difficult to get a sense 
of how big a state is—in other 
words, how long it may take to 
drive across it—except by con­
sulting a table or measuring;
• Some pages are oriented verti­
cally, some horizontally, a 
minor inconvenience;
• States are in more or less 
alphabetical order, “more or 
less” because in some cases 
two states appear on the same 
page.
In 1989, Richard Saul Wurman 
published USAtlas, a 101/4” 
square atlas that addresed 
many of the problems with 
conventional road atlases:
It was organized north-to-
south, east-to-west, beginning 
in Washington state (but 
preceded by Alaska, Hawaii,  
and Puerto Rico) in spreads 
250 x 500 miles—states are 
often split into as many as four 
spreads;
Following this were maps 25 
miles square of major urban 
areas, which in turn were 
followed by maps 5 x 5 miles 
focused on 10 of the country’s 
major cities (you had to rotate 
the book for Manhattan, 
something I noticed only 
recently).
Why did USAtlas go out of 
print so quickly? My guess is 
that is was better in theory 
than in practice: there simply 
wasn’t enough information in 
it for drivers to use confidently. 
Used to road atlases with too 
much information to be read 
comfortably, perhaps drivers 
felt they needed to have every­
thing possible available—just 
in case. They may have been 
confused by the absence of 
road shields: route numbers 
are indicated in USAtlas in a 
way that resemble segment 
distances in conventional road 
maps.
That said, imagine a road 
atlas that combined all the 
positive qualities of USAtlas—
uniform scale and rational 
pagination—with a richness of 
information that would make 
users confident that they had 
all the information they could 
possibly need.

Realty is a crutch.
Lily Tomlin
What Lily Tomlin’s quote means to me in the context of infor­
mation design is that certain familiar aspects of reality, such 
as geographic configurations, direction, and distance, do not 
regularly correspond to the varied experiences of walking, 
bicycling, driving, taking public transit, or flying.
It is the challenge and responsibility of the information 
designer to design maps and other navigational aids with 
an understanding of the different ways in which movement 
modes are experienced and perceived. 
Different movement modes are capable of upending our 
understanding and experience of units of measure. The foot 
is an example of a human-scale measure. As we walk further 
and further distances, we begin to think in other units: the 
block, the neighborhood, the district.
As we change modes, units of measure become mode-
specific. When we ride a bus that doesn’t stop in pedes­
trian-scale units, we think of stops. The same is true of 
above-ground rapid transit and trains, on which we also have 
some sense of time. We intuitively know that the distance 
between some stops is longer than between others: our 
sense of time, which we translate into distance, is aided by 
our view of the passing landscape.
All this changes when we go underground, which gets us 
back to Harry Beck and his departure from his spiritual father, 
John Ogilby, whose distance scale was relatively uniform. 
Beck realized that, without reference to the urban landscape, 
the distance between stops is experientially uniform, almost 
abstract. So, it is fair to say that as clues to geographic reality 
disappear, so does the sense of time and distance. Beck’s 
map, therefore, its critics notwithstanding, was an early visu­
alization of a truly modern (that is, beginning in the late 19th 
century) movement experience.

Diagrams have 
the advantage of

the ability to open

In early 2012 there was an energetic online debate, raised 
by the eminent Erik Spiekermann, about whether Mark 
Noad’s redesigned London Underground map is a “map” or 
a “diagram.”  Why does it matter? The difference between a 
map and a diagram, as conventionally used, seems to do 
with intent. “Maps” are generally understood to describe 
geography—where things are. “Diagrams” are generally 
understood to show how things work or to visualize numer­
ical and/or statistic relationships. Both maps and diagrams 
are intended to explain. 
Making information understandable requires an under­
standing of how people process visual correlations of reality, 
the experiential nature of the reality that the designer is 
trying to communicate, and of course the needs of the 
design’s users. Understanding a transit system is less about 
geography and more about how it moves you around. 
What Harry Beck realized—although he was not the first—is 
that simpler diagrams are easier to understand and to retain 
in memory. What he also realized—perhaps more impor­
tant—is that the experiential reality of London’s Tube system 
is a different reality than walking around London, in terms 
of time, space, units of measurement, and user control. You 
need to know where you are starting, where want to go, and 
(in this case) which train to take. Unlike walking, you have 
limited choices and no orienting scenery; unlike flying, you 
can choose, within limits, when to get off.
What Noad did—and he deserves credit for trying to 
enhance some inherent limitations of the Beckian design still 
in use and make a map that corresponds more accurately 
to the city at grade—is to complicate and reduce a very 
memorable “image” of the system by making it more true to 
geography and less to experience. In doing so, he has com­
promised the system’s coherent unit of measure: the stop. 
You never hear subway users ask how many feet (or miles) 
to their destination; they ask how many stops. The aspects 
of Beck’s model that Noad is revising are appropriate to the 
mode: simplicity, clarity of use, and a memorable image are 
just more important than geographic accuracy; when you 
walk back up to grade, you are going to require another map, 
whether your Tube reference was Beck’s or Noad’s. Like the 
New York MTA’s efforts to combine geography and functional 
accuracy, Noad’s is a compromise that unfortunately adds 
little real value.

Occasionally, the designers 
are prone to visual excess, as 
in their map of London (detail

ground of a Union Jack, and 
New York, which is in the shape 
of a heart. Their entertaining 
colors and backgrounds occa­
sionally distract from the focus 
of the information, but are 
inventive and a lot of fun.

Movement networks can be expressed in any number of 
mediums, both static and interactive: print, signage, elec­
trical, video.
Print is, of course, static by definition, but it has the advan­
tage of portability, eliminating retention and memory issues 
characteristic of maps and guides that don’t rotate or travel.
The eccentric PILI (Plans Indicateurs Lumineux d’Itineraires) 
map of the Paris Métro was introduced in 1937; there were 
184 of them in use by 1961. Unlike today’s interactive 
maps and apps, the PILI was limited and cumbersome, but 
charming nonetheless. 
•  The user could only get a route to a destination from the 
station he was in; 
•  There was no choice of routes offered, so if you wanted to 
stop somewhere on the way to your final destination, you 
would have to plan each segment separately and sequen­
tially, from each departing station; 
•  The user had to keep his finger on the button of his destina­
tion station until he was finished looking; if he was making 
notes, he had to do it with one hand or have a friend nearby.
Nevertheless, it is an excellent example of information design 
before information design had a name: intelligent designers 
and engineers, using the best available technology,  col­
laborating to make a complex system self-explanatory, 
comprehensible, usable, and beautiful.
Current technology now provides a dizzying array of options, 
exemplified by the new installation at Franklin D. Roosevelt 
station. Genuinely interactive, it offers an impressive array of 
customization, including mode (RER covering the Île-de-
France area, Métro, and bus), above-ground maps, station 
information, variable display scale, and handicapped access 
information.

The transition from pedestrian to bus or subway rider (and 
the reverse), just as the transition from driver to pedestrian 
(and the reverse), can be confusing and anxiety-provoking if 
the experience and the transitions of the modes and systems 
are unfamiliar.
The are several reasons for this:
•  Changes of mode require the user’s revising his context, units 
of measure, expectations, familiarity, and sense of control;
•  The sequence is different for every modal change;
•  Much of the time, particularly in rail transit, the information 
the user needs is in discrete steps, all of which may not be 
particularly simple.
As we have discussed, our retention of information that we 
are not carrying with us is limited: information needs to be 
released sequentially, in understandable sets of appropriate 
simplicity and at the appropriate point in the sequence.
The idea of information release hierarchy is very much like a 
typical information hierarchy except that it deals with time 
and place rather than with importance. It also corresponds 
to decision point theory, which deals with information being 
released at the point where it is needed for a decision to be 
made—only the information needed and only when it is 
needed.

Isochronics
On previous pages we discussed the importance of uniform 
scale both for comparing data and for understanding the 
scale relationship among maps as parts of a whole; and, in 
road atlases, of contiguity and consistent orientation of maps 
of places adjacent to each other.
None of these valid and worthwhile arguments for con­
sistent, geographic scale addresses the idea of using 
scale—and, by implication, measurement—to reflect the 
experience of movement using modes of movement that 
contradict fixed, geographic scale and measurement.
In thinking about the pedestrian experience, time and small 
units of distance are used almost interchangeably: it’s three 
blocks that way; or, it’s 10 minutes away. As the distances and 
times become greater, requiring driving, we often use dif­
ferent, larger, mode-appropriate units of measurement when 
the number of smaller measuring units becomes too large: 
take a left after five stoplights. Taking buses, we depend on 
the vehicle’s automated announcements, try to read street 
signs, or ask another passenger.
As we transition to movement modes where references 
to the streetscape are lost—underground or in the air—
new units of measurement emerge: the subway stop; the 
departing and arriving terminal. Time slips out of our control: 
in the subway, we can get on and off only at stops.
In our discussions of scale, we have assumed—as we all do, 
almost all the time—that the scale on any pedestrian map is 
consistent, just as it is usually safe to assume that, since Beck, 
the scale on any transit network map is variable. Whether 
the variability is a function of an efficient use of map real 
estate, or of experiential units of measure (in the case of rail 
transit, the stop), or of the designer’s whim (which one hopes 
is responsible) will vary from map to map and context to 
context. 
We do know, in any case, that the experience of the environ­
ment as a pedestrian is an experience of variable scale to the 
extent that movement and distance are related to time. It’s 
no coincidence that subway stations are closer together in 
dense commercial areas and less so in less dense residential 
neighborhoods or suburbs. More people come and go to 
and from dense areas, and there is more of interest to catch 
their eye, attract them, and, consequently, slow them down.

Facing page. An experimental 
site by Tom Carden that shows 
time from any stop to any stop 
on the London Underground. 
It works by the user choosing a 
departure stop, which is then 
placed in the center of a time 
target. The project is not yet 
completed. His website cites 
notable sources of inspiration.
So the stop, as a unit of measure, in a way relates to experi­
ential time: you move faster—distance being equal—when 
there is less to capture your attention.
Other factors are at work, too. When walking, topography 
plays a significant role: we can walk faster on the level than 
we can walking uphill; we can walk faster if our legs are 
longer. Most of us can walk faster when we’re younger, or in 
a hurry. So the 5- or 10-minute walking circles in pedestrian 
maps in many cities are at best an average guesstimate and 
at worst misleading. They don’t show the impact of topog­
raphy, nor can they take into account the interests of the 
walker, or the density of interesting places or shops that will 
slow her down. Even though geographic mapping is appro­
priate for the pedestrian experience, constant geographic 
scale of a map rarely conforms to consistency of rate of 
movement.
Thinking about these issues led me to the world of fine art, 
which exhibits degrees of abstraction that can be seen as 
analogous not only to the movement experience but also 
to the aspects of cartography that reflect them. A matrix of 
these relationships appears on the following spread.
Facing page. Two isochronic 
maps for London’s Under­
ground. Fare zones tend to be 
based on geography. As a result, 
and a bit ironically, Noad’s fare 
zone map, described less flat­
teringly on page 163, has more 
regular fare zone shapes than 
the map based on the current 
iteration of Beck’s map, which 
uses the stop as its unit of 
measure.
Unlike Center City Philadelphia, 
Albany rises steeply northwest 
of the Hudson River. These 
two maps show the impact 
of topography on a standard 
5-minute walking circle. One 
can travel further in five min­
utes walking downhill than 
uphill.

The road is really straight
You can only drive 
in one direction at a 
time.
John Ogilby’s 1675 (the year before his death) road atlas, 
Britannia, cited also on page 160, was notable for several 
innovations as well as its elegance of drawing:
•  The use of a virtually constant scale (1"=1 mile, or 1:63,360);
•  The scroll device; and
•  For me the most important, his heads-up technique, in which 
he drew his roads essentially as straight lines and rotated the 
compass rose as necessary.
This device, as ingenious as it was to accommodate the 
necessary road length in an 18 x 14" format, articulated a 
fundamental observation of the movement experience: the 
road is straight! Imagine a 17th-century traveler in his horse- 
drawn carriage or wagon; unless directed otherwise, the 
horse just follows the road.
We can see how Ogilby’s logic anticipates 20th-century 
transportion and cartographic innovations, from Beck’s 
iconic map to the straight-line interstate maps of the ’70s, to 
virtually every transit system map of the later part of the 20th 
century up to the present.
Of course, Ogilby’s road atlas had one limitation: if you were 
going from London to Buckingham, all your information 
was heads-up; if you were going from Buckingham back to 
London, not so much. So, Ogilby created half of a heads-up 
map, certainly no small achievement.
Just as freestanding signs have two faces, an aspect of 
physics often forgotten, roads can usually be traversed in two 
directions. Many maps notwithstanding, the exits from high-
speed limited access roads often have different exit numbers 
and access different destinations, an argument for maps of a 
scale adequate to recognize and reveal different information 
depending on direction of movement.

Facing page, near left. John 
Ogilby’s “The Road from London 
to Buckingham,” 1675. The 
original, of course, was uncol­
ored; the English tend to color 
old maps the minute they walk 
in the door, and it is difficult to 
find maps that haven’t been 
recently colored for tourists.
I once asked a dealer about 
an Ogilby, “Is the color 
contemporary” (meaning “con­
temporaneous”)? “Yes,” the 
dealer replied. “When?”  I asked. 
“Last week.”

the fact that exit names and 
numbers can be different 
depending on the direction of 
travel.

changing scale based on 
the density of cartographic 
information.

The significant differences between the transit experience 
(particularly underground) and the pedestrian experi­
ence notwithstanding, the transit rider, the driver, and the 
pedestrian unfamiliar with where he is, where he is going, 
and how he is getting there are united by their need for 
maps and the need, very often, to switch from one map to 
another with a minimum of anxiety and confusion.
Most road atlases and pedestrian guides are rigidly 
geographic; most rail transit maps are not. Moving from 
one type of map to another as one changes movement 
modes—­from airplane passenger to subway rider to driver 
to pedestrian—can be difficult. There are, both in theory 
and in practice, ways of dealing with this fundamental 
conflict between a map that works best for a particular 
mode and maps that play nicely with each other.
•  Distort a geographic map to only an insignificant degree 
so that the user either doesn’t notice or doesn’t care that 
its geographic accuracy is somewhat ”adjusted.” Paris 
bus maps do this on a universal (and imaginative) basis 
in order to simplify the map, to have room for the stop 
names, and to fit the map into a limited space on pole-
mounted kiosks on sidewalks.
•  Consider that humans have built sidewalks, roads, sub­
ways, and rail lines, but nature (for the most part) created 
rivers and shorelines. A river or coastline with a recogniz­
able shape and path, even if simplified and modestly 
distorted, may help a user move from diagrammatic to 
geographic maps and back.
•  Highways don’t collide or run into each other, they transi­
tion to and from what Los Angelenos picturesquely call 
“surface” streets. As one drives onto or off an expressway, 
he is transitioning not merely from a larger or a smaller 
road but experientially to a different mode, a difference in 
kind as well as degree. Traditional road maps use weight 
and notation to denote changes in road type, but they 
don’t often reflect the transitional nature of the change.
Facing page, far left. Detail of 
a highway map (shown on the 
previous spread) that uses color 
to denote road type and name  
(blue, violet, and yellow for 
limited access highways, green 
for local roads) and gradation 
to show the transition from 
one highway or road type to 
another.
Facing page, near left. A typical 
and appropriate map for pedes­
trians, geographically accurate.
Having it both ways. A 
map that shows man made 
features (road and rail) in a 
diagrammatic vocabulary and 
natural features and county 
boundaries in a geographic 
vocabulary with variable scale. 
To accommodate all the road 
and rail activity, Philadelphia 
city-county (in gray) is shown 
twice a big as it really is, but the 
geographic vocabulary masks 
this discrepancy and the map is 
geographically convincing.

Service, naming, and addressing
The layout and naming of transit lines or city streets is an 
important part of a city’s personality, how it is perceived, how 
it is used, and how easy or difficult it is to map. Streets and 
routes are a city’s arteries and veins, and understanding and 
identifying them is not unlike visualizing and understanding 
the organs of the human body and their function. As a 
directionally challenged person, I do fine in Philadelphia and 
Manhattan but horribly in Paris and Rome, and maps for me 
are not just an avocation but also a survival strategy.
The more recently a city developed, the more likely it is that 
its layout and nomenclature may have some order and logic. 
Manhattan is a prime example, having an orthogonal grid 
with numbers for the street names on both axes; so is Center 
City Philadelphia to a less pure extent (and slipping), and 
Washington, DC, still less but not without good intentions. 
London, Paris, and Rome are the opposite—chaos, due to 
their accretion over time and the vision of leaders in power, 
in Rome from Pope Sixtus V (served 1585–1590; good) to 
Mussolini (served 1922–1945; less good). The United States 
just hasn’t had that much time. 
London uses names for its underground lines, one of which 
has meaning (the Circle Line); Paris uses numbers with a 
subset of termini; New York uses both numbers and letters—
numbers for the former IRT lines, letters beginning with A 
for the former IND lines, and letters beginning with N for 
the former BMT lines; Boston uses colors, which its unique 
configuration makes possible.
Determining the success of these many transit naming strat­
egies is not Biblical but pragmatic and contextual. For me, 
Boston’s color coding is brilliant—and lucky; Philadelphia’s 
SEPTA briefly had a general manager who tried to rename 
its lines by color, like Boston, without understanding how 
it worked. New York’s naming is neither brilliant nor lucky. 
Perhaps if it had entirely cast out the past tripartite arrange­
ment, which will seem more and more arbitrary as time 
passes, it would enjoy a more successful result. 
London and Paris have a lot of lines, like New York, but I 
don’t find them as confusing, perhaps because for the most 
part they don’t share trackage as much as New York, so they 
image well. 
Service is as important a contributor to clarity as nomencla­
ture and coding. Extensive service variation and trackage 
sharing seems to be largely an American issue; in London 
and Paris, trains for the most part run from early morning to 
late at night essentially the same way, differing in headtimes 
at usage peaks. As a result, London’s Circle Line and Paris’s 1 
line are each one line on one pair of tracks—no 4, 5, and 6 
(New York) or A and B (Philadelphia). So, the Vignelli map, in 
either iteration, was not an excessive design compared to 
London and Paris; like those maps, it reflected the reality of 
the service.
Michael Bierut writes eloquently of this map’s history, 
focusing principally on the issue of geographic distortion, 
using the proportions of Central Park as an example: a square 
on the Vignelli map, in actuality three times as long as wide. 
My own feeling is that anyone trying to use a diagrammatic 
subway map to plan a walk in the park is a fool.
Addresses are the device we use to find our way around 
places, usually cities. In most Western cities one of two sys­
tems are used: numbers ascending up one side of the street
The best address can be a 
picture. These pictographic 
subway stop designators, devel­
oped by Lance Wyman in 1968 
for the Mexico Olympics (and a 
vastly simpler subway system 
than now exists), addressed the 
needs of both non-Spanish-
speaking visitors and residents 
who might be illiterate.

and down the other; or odd numbers ascending up one side 
of the street and even numbers ascending up the other side. 
This does not hold true in Venice (and certain other Italian 
towns), where street or square numbers have been assigned 
chronologically, preceded by the name of one of her six 
districts (sestieri), for example, Dosodoro 3127. 
This, however, is fairly straightforward compared to addresses 
in Japanese cities, such as Kyoto (other Japanese cities do it 
differently). Too complicated to summarize, the address of 
the Kyoto Tower is Karasuma-Shichijō-sagaru, Shimogyō-ku, 
Kyōto-shi, Kyōto-fu, 600-8216, or, in its abbreviated form, 
Karasuma-Shichijō-sagaru, Shimo–, Kyō–, 600-8216.

verse—seems to expand without limit. The result of this is 
an increasing use of addressing buildings by name (owner, 
tenant, or important nearby location) rather than by street 
address. In Philadelphia, there are 11 buildings named
 “[number] Penn Center,” which happens to be between 
Market Street and JFK Boulevard. There is an Aramark 
Building (also on Market Street), and three buildings named 
“[number] Logan Square,” which are not on, nor within a 
block of, Logan Square.
Renaming streets, roads, and highways in honor of local or 
national heroes as well as corporations is also popular. East 
River Drive in Philadelphia is now Kelly Drive (named for 
Grace’s brother, Jack, an Olympic rower) and West River Drive 
is now Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive. The drives were origi­
nally named for the way one-way traffic went during rush 
hours, no longer the case; the former East River Drive is both 
east and north of the Schuylkill River and the former West 
River Drive is both west and south of the river.
Above. House numbers in 
Japan.
How do you find it? A map 
showing buildings named One, 
Two, and Three Logan Square, 
respectively. The web gives the 
“main” address of Two Logan 
Square as 100 North 18th Street 
and its “virtual” addresses as 
1801 Arch Street and 1800 
Cherry Street, any of which 
would be fine with me.

Not newer but better. 
Beginning in 2007, Kickmap 
introduced a map that exceeds 
in logic and usability the MTA 
maps that have preceded 
and followed it, which has 
been expanded to the new 
vade mecum medium, apps 
for smartphones and tablets. 
Anticipating to some extent the 
Vignelli revision in 2008, it is 
nevertheless richer (one might 
say, too much richer) but is way 
out in front of competitors in 
terms of its intuitive informa­
tion hierarchy.
The evolution of MTA maps, 
beginning in 1939. Manhattan 
got consistently fatter up to 
the Vignelli map in 1972, and 
has since slimmed down; the 
Above. Manhattan’s ratio of width (east-west) to height (north-south), expressed as width equal to 1. 
Below. Percentage of width to height, expressed as a decimal.
Stephan Van Dam has a long 
history of designing and pro­
ducing lucid and handsome city 
maps (particularly of New York) 
in handy and interesting for­
mats. This one, while mapping 
trackage rather than routes, 
nevertheless achieves a clarity 
and simplicity that the new MTA 
map lacks.
current map is only margin­
ally slimmer than the Vignelli 
map, but the Vignelli occupies a 
larger area and appears beefier  
because of its vocabulary.
Below. The current MTA map.

(Ir)rational innovation
 Movement network 
maps highlight the 
conflicts between 
functionalism 
(how it works), 
rationalism (how 
it should work), 
experientialism 
(how it feels), and 
geography (how 
it “actually” is).
Vignelli’s innovation in 1972 was to show routes rather than 
tracks. In many rail systems, different routes share the same 
tracks. If all that is shown are tracks, the problem is how to 
show the routes: it is usually both an issue of identification 
(as in alphanumeric designations) and of color (what do you 
do with the color, if anything, when the routes and tracks 
diverge?). The 1972 Vignelli map was a riot of arbitrary colors; 
the 2008 map is a model of both clarity and restraint.
Why is this not a problem in London? Where are the many 
routes that share trackage? The answer is twofold: 1) regu­
larity of service; and 2) unshared trackage. The Underground 
has relatively no service variation: the route you get on runs 
the same way all day every day (allowing for certain holidays 
and rare specialized exceptions). The Circle Line runs the 
same way on the same tracks all the time; so do the District 
Line and the Central Line. When they share trackage, it is 
shown.
But they don’t very often, unlike in New York. It is unlikely 
that this was a decision made for the convenience of the 
public (or Harry Beck and the Underground’s subsequent 
map designers), but it was a gift: the more complex the 
service, the more challenges confront the designer.

Newer but not better. These 
two examples of AAA’s Triptik 
reveal an evolution from simple, 
clear, two-color heads-up strip 
maps to more book propor­
tion, full-color, north-up maps 
that, while significantly larger 
in scale than the maps in road 
atlases, have lost most of the 
clarity and distinctiveness that 
characterized the originals. 
I assume that these are much 
less expensive to produce and 
draw on current mapping 
technology.

Perils of alphabetization
Organizing a 
map legend that 
functions for its 
intended users is 
not as simple as just 
alphabetizing the 
destinations.
The organization of information is familiar to us from middle 
school, when we learned to make outlines for our papers, 
which required establishing a structural organization and a 
hierarchy of our material. Once we structured and organized 
our content, there were no alternatives. The reader—our 
instructor—may not have fully agreed with our structure, 
and he could tell us so, but he had no alternative to reading 
it the way we wrote it.
Alphabetization is one of a number of possible ways of 
organizing a map legend (numerical and spatial being two of 
the others).
Richard Saul Wurman came up with the acronym LATCH 
for the five finite ways of organizing information: Location; 
Alphabet; Time; Category; and Hierarchy. This of course 
applies to all information, not just map legends.
Designing a map to help us find our way around a campus, a 
district, or a city is similar, except that we need to know who 
is going to use it and how. Because there is no organization 
of a map and its legend that will work well for all condi­
tions and users, we need to model the user segments and 
prioritize them. As the examples on the facing page illustrate, 
every map/legend structure offers advantages and disadvan­
tages. The client and designer need to try to understand how 
the majority of users (or the most important users) are most 
likely to use the map.
Go to http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=130881&seqNum=6
See also Service, naming, and addressing.
No alphabetization when 
you need it. The sequence of 
vote totals in this at-large City 
Council vote is inexplicable. It’s 
not alphabetical (either by first 
or last name); it’s not by vote 
totals. A true enigma.
This map in the Borghese 
Gardens in Rome is organized 
numerically geographically: 
numbers are placed rationally 
on the map, so you can find out 
what is near you. However, if 
you are looking for a particular 
destination, say, the Casa del 
Cinema or the Globe Theatre, 
it will be extremely difficult to 
find without reading the entire 
legend.

Two views from Stephan Van 
Dam’s “4Dm” flythrough of 
Manhattan. Van Dam is also the 
inventor of the Unfolds pop-up 
maps that are in the collection 
of the Museum of Modern Art.
Right. The view of the Pom­
pidou on this north-up map  is 
actually of the west-northwest 
facade.
The Anderson “Map of Midtown 
Manhattan,” 1985, took Con­
stantine Anderson 20 years, 
working alone, and reportedly 
shows every single window, 
door, awning, even telephone 
booth and mailbox in Midtown. 
It is in the same genre as the 
Herman Bollman map of 1962 
and the Tadashi Ishahara map 
of 2000.
Anderson’s map has a lightness 
that the others lack because of 
its sparing and restrained use 
of color. Bollman’s and Isha­
hara’s maps, not shown here, 
are weighted down by their 
palettes, which are unappetiz­
ingly confectionery and which 
emphasize the roofs.
Below. A detail of the 21-sheet 
Turgot map of Paris (1739), 
commissioned by Michel-
Étienne Turgot, in isometric 
projection. The widening of the 
streets and changes in scale of 
objects such as boats is subtle 
and convincingly done.

Do the facades of all important buildings in Rome really face 
south? Not the last time I looked. One night in Rome, my wife 
and I agreed to meet at a restaurant on a street about two 
blocks north of the Pantheon. She had a map, and we were 
talking by mobile phone. “Face away from the front of the 
Pantheon, “ I said, “and walk two blocks.” She called back. 
“I did; I followed the map, and I keep walking toward the 
river.” Blessed with a fine sense of direction (unlike her hus­
band), she was undone by using a map like the one on the 
facing page.
These disorienting map-views are an all-too-common 
example of visual misinformation, combining an accurate 
plan map with accurate building facades oriented in the 
wrong direction to completely confuse the user.
The limitation of bird’s-eye maps is that, by definition, they 
show a lot of roof. And, depending on the bird’s perspective, 
it is likely that a building closer to the bird will obscure some 
very important aspect of a building farther away. Choosing 
the location of the bird is also extremely important, as it can 
see at most only half of a building’s facades. 
The same is true of isometric and axonometric projections, 
such as the Anderson and Turgot maps on the facing page, 
which allow much more freedom to widen sidewalks and 
streets and manipulate scale to maximize real estate and the 
visibility of facades.
Confusing tourists. Most of 
the buildings on the map at 
near left on the facing page are 
shown with their most impor­
tant facade facing the user 
(because the map is north-up, 
the implication is that they are 
all south facades). By the law 
of averages, this is likely to be 
right about 25% of the time. 
Two obviously glaring errors 
are the Pantheon and the Vit­
toriano, both of whose principal 
facades face north. The Spanish 
steps are a little off, and it 
seems that the Trevi Fountain 
and the Vatican are correct by 
happenstance; the Colosseum 
is round. Intended particularly 
to help tourists, this map (which 
is online but unsourced), may 
have (and has had) the oppo­
site effect.
Good in one orientation, less 
good in another. The perspec­
tive below, on well-designed 
and well-placed kiosks in the 
Jardin des Plantes in Paris, 
works really well when north is 
at the top, clearly the orienta­
tion in which the view was 
drawn. When rotated 180° (you 
can tell by the street name), 
below right, one gets a slight 
feeling of vertigo, the liability 
of this type of “exploding” 
perspective.
A use for tall buildings. In this 
bird’s-eye view looking east (not 
current), the campus becomes 
congested and unreadable even 
in the near distance. 
In this east-up map, for the MIT 
Campus Plan, below right, the 
one really tall building on the 
Main Campus is used as an ori­
enter, just as it would be in life.

The difference between con­
ventional mapping of enclosed 
public space and Nolli’s is 
readily seen.
Right. A simplified representa­
tion of most maps even up to 
the present day: only streets, 
alleys, and unenclosed open 
spaces, such as squares and 
parks, are shown as open; all 
other spaces are shown as 
“closed.”
Below right. The same sec­
tion of Nolli’s map showing 
all accessible space, including 
courtyards and public and 
church interiors, as open. It is 
easy to see how much more 
space is available to the public 
than is conventionally shown.

Urban open space
A section of Nolli’s “Pianta 
Grande di Roma” with Piazza 
Navona just to the west of 
center and the Pantheon to its 
east. Commissioned by Pope 
Benedict XIV, the map was used 
in government planning for 
the city of Rome until the 1970s 
and served as a base map for all 
Roman mapping and planning 
up to that date. 
Always conscious of image, 
Calvo’s work is an early and 
delightful example of the car­
tographer’s desire to impose 
order on urban chaos, a dream 
doomed to failure that he pur­
sued by making stuff up. At top, 
the four “maps” of Rome are in 
sequence clockwise from upper 
left. Below them is the rione of 
Trastevere, equally symbolic 
and fanciful.
In 1748, Giambattista Nolli published his radical and transfor­
mative map of Rome. Much of Italian urban architecture was 
courtyard-based, with exteriors presenting a uniform street 
presence (sidewalks were, and remain, improbably narrow) 
and an entrance opening on to a public interior (churches) or 
a large interior courtyard (public buildings, palazzi, universi­
ties). Unlike today in many cases, those courtyards were open 
to the public, who entered them to conduct business.
Unlike preceding maps, Nolli represented these enclosed but 
accessible public and religious spaces as open space, which 
was as true to the pedestrian experience of Rome of his time 
as Beck’s London Underground map is true to the experience 
of using the Tube today.
Marco Fabio Calvo, who died in 1527, was a Roman translator 
and cartographer. His Antiquae Urbis Romae cum Regionibus 
Simulacrum purports to represent street maps of each of 
ancient Rome’s rione—­districts—and includes the four maps 
of Rome above right. These maps are fascinating not for their 
accuracy but for their integration of the fanciful, the iconic, 
and the symbolic.

A tri-axial graph makes it possible to 
plot points, each with three different 
characteristics, the percentages of 
which always add up to 100%. While 
any given single piece of data can be 
only 100% of one characteristic, infor­
mation generally is comprised of many 
pieces of data, which may have several 
characteristics.
All information is divided into 
three parts. Original in Paragon, by 
Abraham Ortelius. Antwerp, 1595.
Learning from Minard. An interesting

Bruno Munari (1907–1998) was a 
painter, sculptor, illustrator, xerogra-
phist, filmmaker, industrial designer, 
graphic designer, writer, and poet; 
he researched games, infancy, and 
creativity.
An example of Munari’s intelligence 
and cleverness is his strategy of 
describing his design process using a 
recipe  metaphor (for green rice), a pro-
cess familiar to so many more people 
than that of “design.”
Step 8, “Testing,” is an integral and  
crucial part of every design process.
The same heart anthropomorphized.
The branding fallacy. There are only 
26 letters in the alphabet, but still…. 
Above left. Walgreens. Above right. 
Washington Nationals.
The branding fallacy: newer but  
definitely not better. The beautiful and 
appropriate mark above was designed 
for the Franklin Institute Science 
Museum in Philadelphia by Hans-U. 
Allemann of Allemann Almquist & 
Jones in 1990. Seduced by the notion 
that change is always desirable, 
especially after 17 years, a new mark 
was adopted in 2007, along with a 
name change to “The Franklin,” which 
sounds like a club, a hotel (it is), or a 
condominium. The name change was 
rescinded after a year or two, but the 
ambiguous and visually banal mark 
remains in use.

When I was perhaps 
10 years old, I read 
a mystery story 
called “The Other 
Arrow” (author and 
source unknown) 
that told of a 
detective who read a 
dying woman’s last 
scribble—
“poisoninsu”—as 
“poison insulin” and
later realized she 
had meant “poison 
in sugar.” 
It’s a reminder of 
the need to examine 
one’s assumptions 
whenever any 
change occurs in the 
design process.
As V. I. Lenin 
put it, “One step 
forward, two steps 
back.”

It’s about time. Edward Tufte and 
graphic designer Inge Druckrey 
produced this schedule for the 
Hoboken–New York line, based on 
Marey’s timetables on page 66. It did 
not last long, for reasons that are 
obscure. It may have had something 
to do with the fact that all trains are 
pretty much equally fast, and so one 
of the great advantages of Marey’s 
notation is in this case unnecessary.

Seeing different ways. Nancy 
Putnam, a participant in Yale’s Rome 
program in 2011, produced these 
on-site drawings of the Pantheon and 
its surrounding urban context. Led by 
instructors Alec Purves, Stephen Harby, 
and Victor Agran, the program—Rome: 
Continuity and Change—emphasizes 
the importance of observation through 
drawing and personal experience.  
Seeing different ways. Rudolfo 
Lanciani. Forma Urbis Romae. This 
topographical atlas was published in 
1901. It is a series of 46 detailed plates 
measuring 25 x 36”, with ancient Rome 
outlined in black and the modern city 
plotted in red. (Italians have a different 
definition of the word “modern” than 
Americans.) The original plates were 
drawn at 1:1,000 scale. In 1990, the 
atlas was reprinted by Edizioni Quasar 
at 1:2,000 scale, its numbered sheets 
folded and presented in a slip case.

Stephen S. Hall tells this terrifying story in Map­
ping the New Millennium:
“The very efficiency of satellites introduces a 
mapping problem….[they] generate staggering 
amounts of information. If you do not have the 
means to analyze all that data..., you may well 
miss the message in the data.... That is what 
happened….
“[They] began to notice that the amount of 
ultraviolet radiation reaching their instrument...
had been steadily rising, meaning that ozone 
layers must…be dropping…. The degrada­
tion appeared to be both steep and steady. As 
so often occurs in science…, the immediate 
response…was that something was wrong with 
the equipment.
“What [they] didn’t know [and this is a huge 
compression of the story] is that data analysts at 
NASA…had begun to ‘flag’ ozone measurements 
over the South Pole that were lower than any of 
NASA’s computer models had predicted…. The 
computer in effect had been programmed to 
discount the data.
“Satellites get so much data that you really 
have to do something of the sort,’ Farnam 
acknowledges. ‘You really need to sort out the 
information…. What they did wrong…was that 
they were throwing away so much data that 
it should have told them that something was 
wrong.”

That map and the one adjacent—
flow charts or maps—are known as 
Sankey diagrams, named after Irish 
Captain H. P. R. Sankey, who utilized 
this diagram type in 1898 to show the 
energy efficiency of a steam engine. 
This and the diagram to its right deal 
with immigration, one in the 19th 
century, one in the 21st. “Rough and 
Figurative Map representative of the 
year 1858: The Emigrants of the World. 
The countries from where they depart 
and the ones where they arrive, drawn 
by Mr. Minard, Inspector General 
of Bridges and Roads in retirement, 
principally from the public records in 
‘European Emigration’ by Mr. A. Legoyt 
and the Merchant’s Magazine of New 
York. Paris, 26 September 1862.” From

Integrity (not). In the 2012 Demo­
cratic primary for Pennsylvania state 
representative, the incumbent sent 
out this mailer, backed by not a single 
fact. It was hard to decide whether to 
showcase its typography or its stupidity 
(there’s no section in this book on 
stupidity) so it’s an integrity issue, even 
though the integrity discussed in Sec­
tion 3 is numerical. The incumbent lost, 
amid a firestorm of media criticism for 
this mailing.

The road is really straight. No book 
that touched, however briefly, on 
map history and vocabulary would be 
complete without the “Peutinger Table,” 
a highly diagrammatized map of the 
Roman road network. The original is 
thought to date from the 5th century 
CE. This map was made by a monk in 
the 13th century, in 11 sections. It runs 
from Spain on the left to India, and so 
is east-up. The detail of Italy centered 
on Rome is aligned with the same loca­
tion on the complete map.

Variable scale. The maps on page 162 
show the three different ways of map­
ping the London Underground—the 
Beckian, the geographic, and Mark 
Noad’s hybrid. What they do not show 
is the relative efficiency of the three 
approaches. The comparisons at right, 
showing the entire Underground net­
work at the same width, reveals that 
the most diagrammatic is the most effi­
cient at showing the congested center 
of London at the largest scale and with 
the largest type size.

6  :  D O C U M E N T S
211
Variable vs. geographic scale. The 
map above appeared in Richard Saul 
Wurman’s NYC/ACCESS in 1983 (colors 
have been enhanced for clarity), com­
bining a diagrammatic vocabulary—a 
30/60/90 degree angle grid—at 
geographic scale overall. The success 
of this map, in my opinion, is mixed, 
although Vignelli is quoted in the book, 
offering a wonderful bit of design 
history and a cautionary tale of the 
bureaucratic process: 
“Originally the design of a New York 
subway map was part of a compre­
hensive project…. Three maps were 
designed: one abstract, for the entire 
system; one geographical, which 
showed the actual position of the sta­
tions in the context of the area; and 
one which explained how to get there 
verbally…. Of this original information 
network, only the abstract system map 
was issued for use. That map, like the 
one in use in London since 1931, was 
organized on a 45/90 degree angle 
grid. That configuration has worked 
well in London…but obviously did 
not please all New Yorkers. Although 
praised for its elegance and design, the 
map’s distortions proved to be difficult 
for users to understand.
“After several years of use, the abstract 
map was replaced by a new one 
(although it would have been better 
to correct the faults of one map, rather 
than re-educate readers to another). 
With water in blue and parks in green 
[see pages 50–51], the present map 
may be clearer in some instances but, 
in toto, is a disappointing solution.
“The NYC/ACCESS subway map repre­
sents the kind of solution we would 
have wanted to see as a follow-up to 
our map, rather than the disappointing 
version we are now offered by the MTA.”
The difference between the two maps 
reveals the difficulties of assessing 
success and failure. One can, of course, 
make educated guesses based on one’s 
own experience and an understanding 
of human factors, but user feedback is 
the ultimate determinant.
The sections of the two maps above 
show the same area of the subway 
system in rectangles of virtually iden­
tical area, centered on Central Park. 
Overall, the Wurman map is relatively 
tall and thin while the Vignelli map 
has squarer proportions. The value of 
the comparison is compromised by 
the Wurman map showing trackage 
while the Vignelli map shows routes 
(see pages 180–181), which constrains 
space for larger type (Vignelli likes 
small type, anyway). The Wurman 
map, by being geographically accurate, 
shows true distances as well as the 
geographic relationship of stations 
and, therefore, of the city above, 
including the true proportions of Cen­
tral Park. This might be appreciated by 
many users who would equate those 
relationships to travel and to pedes­
trian time/distance. We discussed on 
pages 161 and 171–173 that we apply 
appropriate units of measurement to 
different modes and different scales 
of the movement experience. For the 
subway, the unit of measure is the stop 
rather than feet or miles. So, while the 
1983 Wurman map may not retain all 
the advantages of the 1972 Vignelli 
map, it does address some of its failings 
as perceived by users, and it represents 
a fertile field for discussion.

Above. A movement network map for 
TCL Lyon.” In 2009, the public transit 
network of Greater Lyon faced two 
major challenges: the redesign of the 
overall bus network layout, including 
the introduction of new bus lines with 
high service levels, and the need to 
anticipate the full compliance with the 
French Public Transport Accessibility 
Act for 2015. The project included 
the design of a specific typeface and 
the definition of all symbols of the 
wayfinding guidelines, as well as 
timetables and maps. In particular, the 
new diagrammatic map reveals and 
emphasizes the multimodal richness of 
the TCL network, which includes metro, 
tramways, trolleys, and buses.” Attoma

upper left between Florence (Firenze) 
and Milan (Milano).
Which button to push? Far left. I’m 
looking for a green one, right?
Near left. Are parking kiosks every­
where difficult to use? See also page 27.
Right. Another winner in the confuse-
a-tourist contest. The Pantheon and 
the Vittoriano are backwards, which 
is what happens when a building’s 
prominent and recognizable facade 
faces north. See also page 185. 
Facing page, top. Two braille maps, 
one on a street in Rome, the other in 
the metro station in Garbatella, a near 
suburb.

Gratitude
Mentors
I have been privileged to have four, all of whom opened my eyes  
to ways of thinking and seeing.
Robert Speier, Hotchkiss 
Herbert Matter and Walker Evans, Yale 
Richard Saul Wurman, Philadelphia
Business partners 
Alina Wheeler, Katz Wheeler Design 
Peter Bressler, Paradigm:Design 
David Schpok, Joel Katz Design Associates
I’m still friends with all of them. They were exemplary partners—
honest, supportive, and collaborative. I was Alina’s coauthor for 
Brand Atlas. http://www.amazon.com/Brand-Atlas-Branding-Intelli 
gence-Visible/dp/0470433426/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=

Staff colleagues
Joel Katz Design Associates—and its preceding firms, beginning 
in 1975—has had staff colleagues, some of whom began just after 
graduation and some of whom came to us as professionals. Many 
of them by now have gone on to practices as members of other 
firms or as partners in their own firms. Since information design has 
become the principal focus of JKDA, two of those designers deserve 
special mention:
Mary Torrieri, who first came to JKDA as an intern and is now a nurse 
as well as a designer, excelling at both; her nickname was “switch-
blade” because of her proofreading abilities, which she applied to 
this book.
Will Bardel, principal of Luminant Design.
Judy Squire, our bookkeeper, has kept everything running since 
1995.
Interns
We have always had at least one intern, believing that the inte-
gration of school and life is of great benefit to a young person’s 
professional and personal growth. Almost all of our interns have 
come from The University of the Arts, one of the institutions at 
which I am privileged to teach. Four of them worked on this project.
Marie Azcueta 
Ari Winkleman 
Charles Wybierala 
Kay Gehshan, our intern 2011–2012, deserves special appreciation.
Clients and students
Love ‘em.
Most of  ‘em.
Most of the time.
You learn so much by seeing how their minds work, even when you 
disagree with them, which usually leads to dialogue.
And no thanks to
Adobe, for killing FreeHand. See http://www.freefreehand.org
Professional colleagues and friends
One of the joys of doing this book, in addition to crystallizing 
thoughts, ideas, and observations that have been running through 
my head for 40 years, has been in making and renewing contact 
with designers whose work I admire and respect. Everyone I 
reached out to was unfailingly responsive, supportive, and gen-
erous, and I feel a greatly enlarged sense of community. 
Wiley
Margaret Cummins, an encouraging and supportive editor, has a 
great sense of humor and was a pleasure to work with. She prefers 
Manhattans (with Knob Creek bourbon) in cold weather and gin 
and tonics (with Hendrick’s gin—great label) in warm weather.
