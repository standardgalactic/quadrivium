Preface to the Second Edition 
The favorable reception of the first edition of Monopulse Principles and Tech-
niques in 1984 confirmed the need for a book of that type. However, much work 
has been done and much has been learned since 1984 and much of the accumu-
lated knowledge has not been available in an organized and readily accessible 
form. When the publisher requested a new edition, the author agreed provided that 
he could be joined by his former colleague David K. Barton.  
The two of us have now pooled our experience and our efforts in the prepara-
tion of this new edition. In short, our aim has been to produce a book that would 
have been very valuable to us when we were learning and working in this field. 
We hope that others will also find it helpful. 
The theoretical treatment from the first edition remains, since the fundamen-
tals of monopulse had been well developed at the time that edition was published. 
Material has been added in Chapter 5 to relate monopulse performance measures 
to the optimum monopulse described in George Kirkpatrick’s pioneering work, 
and to apply those measures to both reflector and array antenna systems. The same 
measures are also invoked in Chapter 6, on optimum feeds for space-fed 
amplitude-comparison monopulse antennas. New material has been added to 
Chapter 7 on monopulse in array antennas. 
The treatment of monopulse angle errors in Chapter 10 retains the analysis of 
first- and second-order effects of noise, and this is now applied further to clutter 
errors. Discussions of the many other sources of monopulse angle errors have 
been added. In Chapter 11, the effects of diffuse components of multipath are con-
sidered, along with the specular component. Chapter 12 on monopulse counter-
measures and countercountermeasures is new, as are Chapters 13 and 14 on appli-
cations of monopulse to tracking and nontracking radars.

Preface to the First Edition 
Monopulse, also known as simultaneous lobe comparison. is a method of deter-
mining the angular location of a source of radiation or of a “target” that radiates 
part of the energy incident upon it. Monopulse is used in certain types of radars, 
and the same or analogous techniques (not limited to pulsed operation or to elec-
tromagnetic radiation) are also applied in fields such as direction-finding, com-
munications, missile guidance, and sonar. The principles presented in this book 
are valid for any use of monopulse but the examples, photographs, and descrip-
tions of equipment are drawn from monopulse radar, which since its conception 
and early development in the 1940s and 1950s has become a highly successful 
type of instrument, widely used for precise angle measurement and tracking. 
The proliferation of new applications and designs has led to a wide diversity 
of forms of monopulse, all based on the fundamental principle of comparison of 
signals received simultaneously by different antenna patterns (or patterns of other 
types of transducers). The basic concept is simple, but there are many theoretical 
and practical considerations that must be understood in order to achieve the full 
capability of monopulse, as well as to recognize the limits of that capability. The 
theory has a fascination of its own which has attracted the efforts of a number of 
investigators. The results of some of their studies have helped to guide the appli-
cation of advanced technology to produce the high level of performance available 
today. Further improvements and new applications can be expected in the future. 
In this book I have tried to present a balanced combination of theory and up-
to-date practice and application. The style is tutorial. The book explains the prin-
ciples of monopulse, categorizes and describes its various forms, and analyzes 
their capabilities and limitations. Although not intended to be a design manual, it 
devotes considerable space to monopulse circuits, components, and design fea-
tures, especially those that distinguish monopulse from other techniques for angle 
measurement and tracking, or one form of monopulse from another. In the ana-

xvi 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques  
lytical portions the emphasis is on the relation of theory to physical concepts and 
applications rather than on theory alone. I have tried to avoid unnecessary compli-
cation in the mathematics without sacrificing rigor. The explanations, proofs, and 
derivations include all the essential steps; but those who wish to bypass the details 
can extract needed facts, formulas, descriptions, and diagrams.  
I have devoted considerable space to definitions and to explanations of termi-
nology and notation because some of the mystery of a specialized subject often 
lies in unfamiliar terms and symbols as well as in the subject matter itself. The 
discussions on these subjects will also aid in “translating”—and I hope standardiz-
ing—the nonuniform, loose, and even erroneous monopulse terminology some-
times encountered. A complete list of symbols I have used is provided.  
My intent is to serve a broad spectrum of users, from senior or graduate stu-
dents to experienced engineers, scientists, analysts, and managers, preferably with 
some basic knowledge of radar, communications, or a related field. Experienced 
designers who are already familiar with monopulse components and circuits can 
benefit from a better understanding of monopulse theory. On the other hand, sys-
tem analysts can improve the relevance and validity of their theoretical models by 
learning about the physical processes and devices that the models are supposed to 
represent. Engineering managers can enlarge their knowledge of monopulse in 
order to communicate with the specialists in their organizations.  
Because monopulse literature is scattered in numerous papers and reports, 
many of which deal only with narrow, specialized topics, and some of which are 
not readily available, I believe this book will fill the need for a unified treatment 
of monopulse. There are excellent books on radar in general, but they devote rela-
tively little space to monopulse. Books devoted exclusively to monopulse are very 
few. Introduction to Monopulse, by Donald R. Rhodes, originally published by 
McGraw-Hill Book Co. in 1959 (reprinted by Artech House), was and still is an 
important contribution to the radar literature, but it covers only a restricted scope, 
mainly from a theoretical viewpoint, and of course it does not reflect develop-
ments since 1959. Another book, Monopulse Radar, compiled and edited by 
David K. Barton and published by Artech House in 1974, is a collection of re-
prints of selected papers by various authors, with supplementary comments by 
Barton on the significance and highlights of the different papers. Some of the pa-
pers are classics in the field of monopulse, including two that had not previously 
appeared in open literature because they were originally classified. The book is 
highly useful as a reference source but it is not intended as a unified treatment of 
the entire subject of monopulse. There is also a Russian book by A. I. Leonov and 
K. L Fomichev which has been translated into English (by edited machine transla-
tion) under the title Monopulse Radar. It is available in photocopy form (identi-
fied by the number AD 742 696) from National Technical Information Service, 
Springfield, Virginia. It contains a large amount of useful information, drawn 
largely from U.S. sources (including descriptions of several U.S. monopulse ra-
dars). The figures and equations are reproduced “as is” from the Russian originals, 

 
Preface to the First Edition 
xvii  
with English translations of figure labels added. Unfortunately, the translation is 
not always clear, and the poor quality of the reproduction makes many of the 
equations difficult to read and some of the figures unrecognizable. Furthermore, 
there is no index.  
In gathering material I have drawn on many sources, but the organization and 
method of presentation are my own. I have added original material and many new 
or revised illustrations and plots. The largest amount of space is devoted to topics 
that I believe will be useful to most readers, or which are not adequately or clearly 
treated (or are not treated at all) elsewhere in the technical literature. For some of 
the specialized or peripheral topics that are covered well in other readily available 
sources, brief summaries are given and readers are referred to those sources for 
more detailed information.  
My interest in monopulse was acquired and nurtured during my many years 
as a manager and staff scientist in the Missile and Surface Radar organization of

Introduction 
Monopulse, also known as simultaneous lobe comparison, is a technique for 
measuring the direction of arrival of radiation. The radiation may emanate from an 
active source such as a distant transmitting antenna, a beacon, a jammer, an astro-
nomical body, or from a passive source—that is, a target or scatterer that reradi-
ates some of the power incident on it. Monopulse has many actual and potential 
applications not limited to electromagnetic radiation, but it has reached a particu-
larly high state of development in certain types of radar. This book therefore deals 
specifically with monopulse as used in radar, but much of the material applies as 
well to other uses, some of which will be pointed out. 
1.1 REVIEW OF RADAR PRINCIPLES  
A very brief summary of radar principles will be given as a framework within 
which to introduce the elementary concepts of monopulse. The treatment of the 
advanced aspects of monopulse in later chapters will presuppose a more extensive 
general knowledge of radar than can be provided here. The reader is presumed to 
have such knowledge already, or to be pursuing it concurrently. It can be obtained 
from any one of a number of books, not to mention a wealth of technical literature 
in journals. Recent books covering radar from a broad viewpoint include those by 
Skolnik [1], Barton [2], Peebles [3], Eaves and Reedy [4], and Richards [5]. The 
handbook edited by Skolnik [6] contains a vast store of information on a wide 
range of radar topics, better suited for reference than for a tutorial exposition. 
These books devote only a small fraction of their total pages specifically to mo-
nopulse.  
The basic functions of radar are to detect the presence of electromagnetic 
scatterers (radar targets) in the antenna beam and to determine their positions. In a

Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
typical radar the transmitter generates pulses of electromagnetic radiation, usually 
at a regular rate called the pulse repetition frequency. The antenna radiates the 
transmitter output into space, typically in a directional pattern that concentrates 
most of the power into a major lobe or beam which is narrow in one angular di-
mension ( fan beam) or in both angular dimensions (pencil beam). The same 
antenna, in most cases, is also used for reception, but not necessarily with the 
same pattern. The received signals are converted from radio frequency (RF) to 
intermediate frequency (IF), amplified and filtered by one or more receivers, and 
then processed for visual display or for automatic (usually digital) detection and 
extraction of information. 
If there is a target in the beam, the radar receives an echo from it following 
each transmitted pulse. The target range or distance is readily determined by mul-
tiplying half the time delay between the transmitted and received pulses by the 
speed of light. 
A crude way of determining angular position of a target is to move the an-
tenna beam past the target direction and note the pointing direction that gives the 
maximum echo amplitude. This method, in effect, is used in many search radars 
where measurement precision on the order of tenths of the beamwidth is accept-
able, but it is not adequate in applications requiring much finer precision. Fur-
thermore, it is not suitable for closed-loop angle tracking because as the beam axis 
deviates from the target, the echo amplitude decreases regardless of the direction 
of deviation; thus, there is no directional or sense information to tell the servo 
which way to drive the antenna to bring it back to the target. Even if sense infor-
mation is provided, the sensitivity is very poor, since the slope of the response 
curve is zero at the maximum. 
The need for continuous, accurate angle and range measurements on a desig-
nated target led to the development of tracking radars, starting with the relatively 
crude tracking radars of World War II and culminating in the sophisticated preci-
sion instruments of today. The most important single improvement in angle 
tracking was the introduction of monopulse, which is now used also for 
nontracking angle measurements. 
1.2 TRACKING RADARS AND THE EVOLUTION OF MONOPULSE  
A tracking radar is a radar that automatically keeps the antenna beam axis aligned 
with a selected target. Such a radar usually has a highly directional antenna pattern 
(i.e., a narrow beam). The beamwidth is typically of the order of 1° in each angu-
lar coordinate, but it varies considerably from one radar to another, and in any one 
radar it need not be the same in both coordinates. 
Any deviation of the target from the beam axis produces a correction signal 
(usually called an “error” signal) for each coordinate, approximately proportional 
to the angular deviation in that coordinate, with a sign or polarity that indicates the 

 
Introduction 
3 
sense of the deviation (up or down, left or right). The correction signal is used to 
drive the axis toward the target. 
A tracking radar also tracks the target in range, by keeping a range (time) gate 
centered on the target. Only signals received during the gate are accepted for 
tracking. The time interval between centers of the transmitted pulse and range gate 
provides the range measurement. Deviation of the target echo pulse from the cen-
ter of the range gate produces a correction signal, which tends to keep the range 
gate centered on the target. In some radars, the Doppler-shifted frequency of the 
target is also tracked by sensing the difference between that frequency and that of 
a tunable narrowband filter, and deriving a Doppler correction signal that tends to 
keep the filter band centered on the target frequency. 
This book discusses angle tracking, or more generally, angle measurement, 
which can be accomplished with an accuracy of a small fraction of a beamwidth. 
The earliest application of tracking radars was to provide range and pointing 
direction for artillery. This background is reflected in some of the terminology of 
tracking radars, such as track, target, boresight, and range (meaning distance to 
the target). Present-day tracking radars are used in many applications besides di-
rect fire-control support. Examples will be given later in this section. 
Early in the history of radar, an angle-tracking technique called lobe switch-
ing came into use. In this technique the radar beam or lobe, instead of pointing 
directly at the target, points slightly to one side and then to the other, alternating 
rapidly. Figure 1.1 illustrates lobe switching in elevation; in traverse1 it would be 
                                                           
1  Traverse angle is measured in the slant plane containing the target. This is to be distinguished from 
azimuth, which is measured in a horizontal plane. See Section 2.8 for a fuller discussion.

similar. If the target is above or below the axis, the echoes are unequal. Suppose 
the target is above the crossover axis, as shown by the dotted line. Then the echo 
from lobe 1 is greater than from lobe 2. The voltage difference v1 – v2 in this case 
is positive, which means that to center the target on the crossover axis, the antenna 
must point higher. The two signals can be displayed visually, side by side, to en-
able an operator to make the necessary correction, or their difference can be used 
in a servo loop to position the antenna automatically. 
The same operation can be interleaved in both angular coordinates. Sequential 
lobing in elevation and traverse can be combined, permitting complete angle 
tracking, requiring four successive beam positions, as shown in Figure 1.2(a). The 
beam can be moved electronically or by mechanically rotating or nutating the feed 
around the axis. If it is done mechanically, then instead of moving the beam in 
four discrete steps, it is preferable to move it continuously in a circular path cen-
tered around the crossover axis, resulting in conical scan. Lobe switching and 
conical scan are both included in one general term—sequential lobing. Although 
the beam motion is continuous in conical scan, the target is illuminated only when 
each transmitted pulse reaches it, as illustrated in Figure 1.2(b). If the scanning 
rate is 30 cycles per second (a typical value), and the pulse repetition rate has an 
illustrative value of 240 pulses per second, there are eight beam positions per 
scan. When the target is anywhere but on the crossover axis, the echo strength, 
modulated approximately sinusoidally at the scanning frequency, is greatest when 
the beam axis is closest to the target direction. Demodulation of the received sig-
nal yields the modulation envelope, which, when normalized and compared to a 
reference sinusoid at the scanning frequency in a pair of phase-sensitive detectors, 
yields correction signals indicating the two orthogonal components of axis devia-
tion from the target. The conical-scan type of tracking radar gave successful ser-
vice long after World War II for applications where the utmost precision was not 
needed.

Introduction 
5 
A principal source of error in sequential lobing is the fluctuation that occurs 
in the echo strength of most targets. This fluctuation often has considerable power 
spectral density in the vicinity of the lobing or scanning frequency, and therefore 
causes erroneous angle indications. In simple language, the radar cannot distin-
guish between pulse-to-pulse variations in echo amplitude due to target displace-
ment from the antenna axis and those due to target fluctuations. 
Another disadvantage of sequential lobing is the limitation on the data rate 
imposed by the necessity of obtaining at least four successive echo pulses for each 
pair of angle estimates. This can be a serious limitation in the tracking of targets 
that have large angular accelerations, whether actual or apparent (i.e., geometri-
cally induced). In the case of conical scan there is the further disadvantage that the 
mechanical vibration makes it hard to maintain accurate boresight alignment. 
The solution that overcomes or alleviates these problems is monopulse, also 
called simultaneous lobing or simultaneous lobe comparison. 
One category of monopulse, called amplitude-comparison monopulse, is 
similar in concept to lobe switching, but instead of comparing the target echoes 
obtained in four sequential beam positions (up-down, left-right), it forms the four 
receiving beams simultaneously and makes the comparisons on each pulse. (If 
monopulse is used in only one angular coordinate, only two simultaneous receiv-
ing beams are needed.) A single transmitting beam suffices, being just wide 
enough to encompass the receiving beams. Another category is phase-comparison 
monopulse. This operates a little differently, but the common feature of all mo-
nopulse is the use of simultaneous receiving beams. Since angle information is 
available from every received pulse instead of requiring a cycle of successive 
beam positions, monopulse can provide a higher data rate than sequential lobing. 
Ideally, monopulse radars are free of errors due to pulse-to-pulse fluctuations 
in target echo strength, because the fluctuations have no effect on the ratios of 
signals received simultaneously from different lobes on each pulse. In practice, 
because of design and cost constraints, these errors are not always entirely elimi-
nated, but they are at least greatly reduced. 
The advantages of monopulse over the other angle tracking techniques are 
obtained at the price of greater equipment complexity and cost. For example, mo-
nopulse requires multiple receivers, while the other techniques need only one. The 
receivers must be carefully designed and matched so that they track one another in 
gain and phase (see Section 1.3). For some applications the simpler systems are 
quite adequate. 
The practical development and use of monopulse radar received great impetus 
after World War II, but the concept originated and the early development occurred 
well before that (although not under that name). Brief historical summaries are 
given by Rhodes [7] and Barton [8], and further details can be found in references 
that they cite. The earliest unclassified paper on monopulse appears to be a brief 
one (actually only an abstract) by Page [9], who was active in its early develop-

6 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
ment. That paper was based on a 1944 U.S. Naval Research Laboratory report by 
Page, classified at the time but later declassified and reprinted in [8]. 
Most tracking radars in use today are of the monopulse type. Throughout the 
world thousands of monopulse radars have been built and installed on land, at sea, 
on aircraft and guided missiles, and in space. They perform a large variety of 
functions, of which some major categories can be listed as: 
1. Tactical control of gunfire and of missile launching and guidance. 
2. Strategic military applications such as tracking of potentially hostile 
aircraft or missiles at long range. 
3. Space applications, including tracking of space vehicles, satellites, 
and other space objects, both U.S. and foreign. 
4. Intelligence applications, including analysis not only of trajectories 
but also of echo variations as the target moves, from which certain 
information about target size, shape, rotation, and other characteris-
tics can be deduced. This would be difficult or impossible with se-
quential lobing because of the modulation that those techniques su-
perimpose. 
5. Support applications for both military and space purposes, including 
monitoring and evaluation of exercises at test ranges, and tracking 
space vehicles during launch to determine what orbit or trajectory 
corrections are needed, if any, or to give the signal for destruction if 
the path is faulty beyond correction. Tracking radars designed for 
such support applications are called instrumentation radars, and 
these are among the most precise radars in existence [10–12]. 
Accuracies in the order of 1/200 of a beamwidth (a “beam-splitting” 
ratio of 200:1) are attainable. 
Although the original and most common mode of operation of monopulse is 
tracking in the strict sense of keeping the beam axis pointed at the target, this is 
not the only mode. In some radars, off-axis measurements are used; the beam axis 
may be as much as a half-beamwidth removed from the target direction. Mo-
nopulse can also be used in one or both coordinates in a search radar or the search 
mode of a multifunction radar. In these cases the open-loop monopulse output 
signal indicates (by way of a calibration function) the target angle in one or both 
coordinates relative to the known direction of the beam axis at each instant, and 
thus the absolute target angles are determined. 
1.3 A “BASELINE” MONOPULSE RADAR  
Before entering into the more detailed aspects of monopulse, an example of mo-
nopulse radar configuration is presented. Although this example represents only 
one of the various forms of monopulse, and is idealized and simplified besides, it

illustrates the basic principles and serves as a “baseline” reference for some of the 
material in later chapters. This particular type of radar belongs to the general cate-
gory known as amplitude-comparison monopulse, which was introduced in Sec-
tion 1.2 and will be examined in more detail later. Another category, known as 
phase-comparison monopulse, will also be examined later. 
The radar that will serve as the model has a paraboloidal-reflector antenna2 
fed by a cluster of four feed horns in the focal plane, symmetrically offset about 
the axis, as shown in Figure 1.3. The two feed horns that are visible in Figure 
1.3(a) are displaced from the axis toward the viewer and the other two are dis-
placed in the opposite direction. When viewed axially from the center of the re-
flector, the horns appear as in Figure 1.3(b). (Although drawn as squares, the 
horns are rectangular in many cases.) The four feed horns produce four squinted 
beams, as shown in Figure 1.4.3 Note that the upper horns produce the lower 
beams. The beams are such that if their outputs were connected to four separate, 
identical receivers, their responses to an incident plane wave (i.e., to the radiation

from a distant source or scatterer) would all be in the same phase but would gen-
erally differ in amplitude in accordance with the beam patterns and the direction 
of arrival of the wave. The common crossover point is on the paraboloid axis. 
Only a target on the axis of symmetry of the antenna assembly gives equal am-
plitudes in the four beams. From the ratios of the amplitudes, the two angular 
components of the source direction relative to the axis can be determined. Three 
beams, yielding two independent ratios, would suffice to determine the two angu-
lar components of a single target. Four beams are generally used because of the 
practical advantages of symmetrical design. 
The four beams are shown in cross section in Figure 1.5. Let A, B, C, and D 
represent the corresponding received voltages. In theory, the outputs of the four 
horns could be connected to four identical receivers, the outputs of which could 
then be compared. In practice, the four receivers, even if adjusted initially for 
equal gain and phase, would vary unequally as a function of time, signal level, 
radio frequency, and environmental conditions. The result, as was learned in some

of the early monopulse development, would be large drifts in the electrical axis 
(boresight direction) and in the measurement of off-axis target angles. 
The usual method, therefore, is to form the sum, an elevation difference, and 
a traverse difference of the horn outputs at RF, prior to the receivers, by means of 
RF combining devices known as hybrid junctions (described in Chapter 4). Being 
electrically and mechanically compact and rigid, these devices have much less 
drift than the active circuits of receivers; therefore the null axis is more stable. The 
sum and the differences are:

10 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
The direction in space in which the traverse and elevation difference patterns 
both have their nulls is called the monopulse axis, the boresight axis, the tracking 
axis, or the electrical axis. Ideally it coincides with the geometric or mechanical 
axis of the reflector, but in practice there is usually some deviation. To determine 
the monopulse axis as the reference for angular readings, it is necessary to bore-
sight or collimate the antenna. This process consists essentially of pointing the 
antenna so as to obtain a null on a test target at a known direction, then adjusting 
the angle readouts to the correct values in that direction. When the word “axis” is 
used alone in a monopulse context, it is understood to mean the electrical rather 
than the mechanical axis. 
The sum pattern is a pencil beam with its peak on the monopulse axis. (In 
practice the directions of the sum peak and the difference null may differ slightly 
because of imperfect symmetry.) Unless otherwise specified, the beamwidth of a 
monopulse antenna is customarily defined as the one-way half-power beamwidth 
of the sum pattern—that is, the angular interval between the points where the sum 
voltage is 1
2 times its peak value. The horizontal scale of Figure 1.6 is normal-
ized to that beamwidth. The half-power width of the sum beam is somewhat 
greater than that of each squinted beam. 
Figure 1.7 is a functional diagram that includes, in simplified form, the 
processing steps described so far and those that follow.

Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
The same channel that forms the sum pattern for reception is also used in the 
reverse direction for transmission. (The duplexer permits two-way operation.) 
Thus, the transmitting pattern is the same as the sum pattern in Figure 1.6. In re-
ception the sum signal is used for detection, ranging, and displays, in addition to 
the monopulse function. 
In the receivers for the sum and difference channels the radio frequency (RF) 
voltages from the microwave combining network are converted to intermediate 
frequency (IF) by mixing with the output of a local oscillator, then amplified and 
filtered at IF. The filter bandwidth is approximately the reciprocal of the radar 
pulse width. 
For each coordinate there is a monopulse processor. This processor can take 
any one of several forms, some of which will be described in Chapter 8. A com-
mon feature of all monopulse processors is that they respond to voltage ratios or 
phase differences or both, not to absolute voltages or phases. 
In our baseline radar the two inputs to each processor are the sum signal and 
the difference signal for one coordinate. The output is the ratio of difference volt-
age amplitude to the sum voltage amplitude, multiplied by the cosine of the rela-
tive phase angle between the two voltages. The relative phase is denoted by δtr in 
traverse and δel in elevation. In our idealized baseline model, the sum signal and 
the difference signals from a single point target always have 0° or 180° relative 
phase, because they are derived from four individual beams whose outputs are 
assumed to have exactly the same phase. Therefore, the cosine is +1 if the target is 
on one side of the axis and −1 if it is on the other side. We will find in later chap-
ters, however, that under practical conditions the cosine is not necessarily con-
fined to ±1. 
The amplitude ratio indicates how far the target is off the axis and the cosine 
factor provides the sense (left or right of the axis, above or below the axis). The 
cosine factor also serves to reject the quadrature-phase component of noise and 
thus it reduces errors caused by noise. 
The output in each coordinate, consisting of the voltage amplitude ratio mul-
tiplied by the cosine of the relative phase is often called the “error” signal in that 
coordinate but we will avoid this name because, as explained in Section 2.5, an 
“error” signal is not necessarily associated with an error in determining target an-
gle. A more descriptive name is the normalized difference signal, or more specifi-
cally, the in-phase component of the normalized difference signal, because it is 
also possible to measure the quadrature-phase component by replacing the cosine 
by the sine. In our baseline radar model, the quadrature component is zero (except 
for noise contributions) in response to a point target, and so nothing would be 
gained by measuring it. In other cases, however, it is nonzero and may contain 
useful information, as we will see in later chapters. 

 
Introduction 
13 
A more general term for the output is simply the monopulse processor output, 
which includes not only the type of output produced by the baseline radar but also 
the outputs of other types of monopulse processors, to be described later. 
The antenna patterns are so designed that the normalized difference signal d/s 
in either coordinate, in response to a single point target, is: (1) nearly proportional 
to the target angle off axis in that coordinate out to about one-half beamwidth on 
either side, as can be seen in Figure 1.6, and (2) nearly independent of the target 
angle in the other coordinate. The normalization makes the output independent of 
echo strength and dependent only on target angle. The echo strength has the effect 
of a common multiplying factor on the sum and difference signals and therefore 
“cancels out.” 
Our baseline model is a mechanically steered tracking radar. The monopulse 
processor outputs, after coordinate transformation, become inputs to the servo-
amplifier channels, and the servos turn the antenna in the proper direction until a 
null in the monopulse processor output is reached. The reason for the coordinate 
transformation is that the mechanical rotation coordinates of the antenna mount 
are usually azimuth and elevation while the difference signals are functions of 
target traverse and elevation relative to the antenna axis. A simple approximate 
transformation usually suffices. This consists of multiplying the traverse mo-
nopulse output by the secant of the antenna elevation angle to drive the azimuth 
servo, and using the elevation monopulse output without transformation to drive 
the elevation servo. 
Ideally the antenna axis would follow the target direction exactly. In practice 
there are deviations. While the servo does the best it can to keep the tracking axis 
on a moving target, it will lag by some amount. The lag may be caused by target 
angular rates or accelerations exceeding the maximum capabilities of the servo, or 
by higher-order derivatives of target angular motion. Wind forces may also cause 
the antenna axis to deviate from the target. In either case—lag or wind forces—
there is a residual voltage at the monopulse processor output that the servo cannot 
null out. The resulting error can be largely removed by an optional feature called 
error correction or electrical correction signal. The residual monopulse output 
that the servo is unable to null out is measured and converted to the corresponding 
off-axis angle by a known calibration function. The off-axis angle, added to the 
pedestal shaft rotation angle either in real time or in postmission analysis, gives a 
corrected value of the target angle. 
1.4 ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF MONOPULSE  
Advantages of monopulse over sequential lobing, some of which have already 
been mentioned, are summarized here. More detailed comparisons, including 
analysis of sequential lobing in greater depth than can be given here, are available 
elsewhere [13–18]. 

14 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
1. Errors due to amplitude fluctuations of target echoes are eliminated 
or greatly reduced in monopulse. 
2. In a monopulse radar, angle information is derivable from each 
pulse rather than requiring a complete cycle of pulses or a complete 
scan. The full capability of single-pulse measurement is not gener-
ally utilized in continuous tracking of a single target, since the sig-
nals are usually integrated (or measurements are smoothed) over 
several pulses. Nevertheless, that capability increases the available 
data rate and permits the use of a higher bandwidth when needed to 
reduce lag error or loss of track on an accelerating target. The sin-
gle-pulse capability is highly important in some surveillance radars 
and in multifunction radars with electronically steered antennas, 
which perform interleaved tracks on several targets by switching the 
beam direction rapidly from one to another. Each dwell on each tar-
get may allow time for only a few pulses or even a single pulse, and 
a measurement on each pulse may be required. 
3. Since the sum beam, both in transmission and reception, is pointed 
at the target rather than to one side or the other, the signal-to-noise 
ratio is higher in monopulse, assuming that the other radar parame-
ters are the same. This results in better detection capability (re-
quired before track can be initiated) and less tracking error (by a 
factor of roughly two) due to thermal noise. 
4. Monopulse radar is free of the mechanical vibration and wear and 
tear of the rotating feed or reflector needed to produce conical scan, 
and therefore has better stability of the boresight axis. 
5. Transmission from a sequential-lobing radar reveals the presence 
and periodicity of the switching or scanning4 and makes the radar 
vulnerable to certain countermeasures that take advantage of that in-
formation. Monopulse transmission is unmodulated. 
6. In certain applications, information about the nature and orientation 
of a target that is being tracked is derived from analysis of pulse-by-
pulse amplitude fluctuations of the echo. This is difficult or impos-
sible in sequential lobing because of the modulation imposed by the 
lobe switching or scanning. In a monopulse radar the received sum 
signal can be used for this purpose, since it is unmodulated. 
7. The tracking range in conical scan is limited by the scan rate. This 
is because the beam direction must not be allowed to move too 
much between transmission and reception. Monopulse is free of this 
restriction; the maximum unambiguous range is limited only by the 
pulse repetition frequency. 
                                                           
4  There are, however, special techniques of using switching or scanning in reception only, leaving the 
transmission unmodulated. 

 
Introduction 
15 
The principal disadvantage of monopulse is that, in order to realize its inher-
ent superior capability, it needs more equipment and more painstaking design and 
adjustment of components. It is therefore more expensive. 
Conventional monopulse requires three receiver channels for two-coordinate 
angle tracking, compared with one receiver channel for sequential lobing; the 
three channels must “track” one another in gain and phase over a wide range of 
conditions. Special monopulse configurations have been devised which use fewer 
than three channels (see Sections 8.14–8.17) but either they cause some sacrifice 
in performance or they pose difficult design problems. 
The RF circuitry is more complex in monopulse, since the sum signal and the 
two difference signals (or signals from the individual feed horns) must be brought 
down from the antenna. The RF channels must be kept balanced to prevent errors. 
There are additional factors which, although not directly attributable to the 
use of monopulse techniques, increase the cost of a monopulse system. For exam-
ple, a pedestal and drive system that is adequate for a conical scan radar (because 
its error contributions and dynamic limitations are masked by those of the conical-
scan process itself) may have to be replaced by a higher-performance, more costly 
pedestal and drive in order not to limit the accuracy and dynamic performance 
achievable with a monopulse radar. 
Ordinary monopulse (such as the baseline system described in the preceding 
section) has smaller advantages over other tracking techniques when the radar 
resolution cell contains multiple targets, multiple reflection points on one target, 
or a target and multipath, since these conditions distort the arriving wave front and 
affect all tracking systems. However, monopulse in a broader sense (meaning the 
use of simultaneous receiving patterns not confined to those in the baseline sys-
tem) makes possible special techniques that can be used in some cases to reduce 
those errors. 
1.5 NONRADAR USES OF MONOPULSE 
Although the emphasis in this book is on monopulse as used in radar, the same or 
analogous techniques are used for other purposes as well. Other radio-frequency 
applications include passive direction-finding [19, 20], communications (for ex-
ample, keeping an Earth-station antenna pointing at a communications satellite) 
[21], radio astronomy [22, 23], and missile guidance [24, 25]. The monopulse 
principle is also used in both active and passive sonar [26, 27] and in some optical 
trackers. 
In applications not involving pulsed transmission the technique is often called 
simultaneous lobing or simultaneous lobe comparison rather than monopulse. In 
radio astronomy a technique known as interferometry derives information about 
the angular distribution of radiating sources by correlating the signals received by 
two or more widely spaced antennas; in a broad sense this can be considered a 

16

form of phase-comparison monopulse, or it might more properly be called “time-
delay-comparison monopulse.”

Chapter 2 
Terminology, Definitions, and Notation 
In the early days of monopulse development and even to the present time, differ-
ent terminology and symbols have been used by various companies, government 
organizations, and individuals, and have often been only loosely defined. The lack 
of standardization has sometimes been a source of confusion. The purpose of this 
chapter is to define the terms and symbols used in this book and to help the reader 
“translate” some of the terminology found elsewhere. Many of the terms have 
been defined in standards of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers 
(IEEE), compiled in [1], and reference will be made to those definitions as appro-
priate. Although the IEEE standards reflect the consensus of panels of experts and 
authors, they are not compulsory standards, and of course they cannot retroac-
tively standardize terminology in older radar literature. Furthermore, they do not 
include all radar terms. As a result, there are differences in terms and definitions 
(not to mention symbols) used by various writers. They may require occasional 
“translation” but need not cause confusion if the reader pays careful attention to 
each writer’s definitions and notation. 
In this book the terminology and definitions are consistent with those in the 
IEEE standards but are expanded for tutorial purposes. The reader is assumed to 
be already familiar with basic general radar terminology. Therefore, emphasis will 
be given to those terms that are peculiar to monopulse or that have special mean-
ings when applied to monopulse. Attention is also given to some terms, which 
although not limited to monopulse or even radar, are subject to more than one 
interpretation and therefore require clarification. Important terms are defined or 
explained wherever they are introduced throughout the book, and a list of symbols 
is provided at the back of the book. 
Some terms, however, are so fundamental to the subject of monopulse 
(including the word “monopulse” itself) that they deserve special attention at the 
outset. Such terms are discussed in this chapter. 

20 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
Monopulse action takes place on reception. However, some of the terms, par-
ticularly those pertaining to antennas and associated components, are transmission 
terms, because some of the concepts are easier to explain in that form. By reci-
procity, the receiving pattern of an antenna is the same as if the antenna (including 
the feed system, combiners, and beamformer) were used for transmission. 
2.1 THE MEANING OF MONOPULSE 
The word monopulse was first introduced by H. T. Budenbaum of the Bell Tele-
phone Laboratories in 1946, according to his later paper [2]. The word is en-
trenched in the technical terminology not only of the English language but of sev-
eral foreign languages as well, with minor variations. It was coined because it 
clearly expressed the ability to collect from each pulse the information needed for 
a pair of two-coordinate angle estimates, whereas the older angle-sensing tech-
niques of sequential lobing required several (at least four) pulses to form a pair of 
angle estimates. 
The term simultaneous lobing, synonymous with monopulse, is a more accu-
rate description of the technique, although it is less commonly used. It is the si-
multaneity rather than the “one pulse” that is essential. As a matter of fact, many 
monopulse radars do not extract angle estimates from each pulse. The usual prac-
tice is to smooth or integrate the raw single-pulse estimates, in order to improve 
the estimates, provide Doppler resolution, or simplify the processing. Further-
more, as already mentioned, monopulse is not confined to pulsed radars. The si-
multaneity of reception prevents errors due to fluctuation in the signal strength. 
Because many monopulse systems use design compromises for economy, these 
errors may not be completely prevented, but they are at least smaller than in se-
quential lobing. 
There are many monopulse radars that do provide complete angle estimates 
from each pulse. Examples include certain precision instrumentation radars whose 
outputs are used for fine-grain, pulse-by-pulse analysis of target trajectories and 
reflection characteristics, and phased array radars that maintain tracks on several 
targets, interleaved with one another and with search, so that the time available for 
a dwell on each target is very short. 
A variety of definitions of monopulse can be found in the technical literature. 
The following definition, taken from an earlier version of the IEEE Standard [1], 
is adopted here with minor changes in order to include nonradar applications: 
A technique in which information concerning the angular location of a source or 
target is obtained by comparison of signals received simultaneously in two or more 
antenna patterns, as distinguished from techniques such as lobe switching or coni-
cal scanning, in which angle information is derived from a series of sequential an-
tenna patterns. In radars using monopulse the simultaneity of the patterns makes it 
possible to obtain a two-dimensional angle estimate from a single pulse (hence the 

 
Terminology, Definitions, and Notation 
21 
name monopulse), although multiple pulses are usually employed to improve the 
accuracy of the estimate, provide Doppler resolution, or simplify the processing. 
The monopulse principle can be used in continuous-wave as well as pulsed radar, 
and also in non-radar applications. 
The wording of this definition expresses several important points: 
1. The words “information concerning” are intended to emphasize that 
what is obtained from the monopulse is an estimate of angular loca-
tion subject to various errors. The word “information” may be in-
terpreted, as in information theory, to mean reduction of uncer-
tainty. 
2. “Angular location” means a single angular coordinate or a pair of 
angular coordinates, such as azimuth and elevation (see Section 
2.8). 
3. Since a “target” reradiates energy back to the radar, it might be con-
sidered to be included under the more general term “source” 
(meaning a source of radiation). However, a source is usually inter-
preted to mean an active radiator such as a transmitting antenna or 
transponder, as distinguished from a target that reradiates passively 
by reflection. Monopulse is used in reception, not transmission—
therefore it works on active sources as well as targets. To avoid 
needless repetition, the word “target” will frequently be used in this 
book to include sources as well, except where a distinction is being 
made. 
4. “Comparison of signals” can take many forms, depending on the 
monopulse classification. In most cases, the comparison is not made 
directly between signals from individual feed horns or antenna ele-
ments, but indirectly—for example, between the sum and the differ-
ences. A comparison must take the form of an amplitude ratio or a 
phase difference or both1 so that the resulting angle indication will 
not depend on absolute signal strength or phase. 
5. The definition mentions “two or more” patterns. For measurement 
of a single angle coordinate, two patterns suffice. For measurement 
of both angular coordinates, at least three patterns are needed. 
6. The word “patterns” is used rather than “beams” because it is more 
general, as will be explained in Section 2.3. 
7. The reference to lobe switching and conical scanning is not essen-
tial to the definition of monopulse but is included to emphasize the 
distinction between simultaneous and sequential receiving patterns 
(see Section 1.2). 
                                                           
1  The comparison can always be expressed in terms of a complex ratio, which includes both an 
amplitude and a phase difference. Thus if two signals are a1exp( jφ1) and a2exp( jφ2) their complex 
ratio is (a1/a2)exp[ j(φ1−φ2)].

Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
2.2 APERTURES AND ILLUMINATION FUNCTIONS  
The word aperture (from the Latin apertus, open) means literally an opening. The 
use of this word in connection with electromagnetic radiation comes from classi-
cal optics, where it means an opening in an opaque screen. When the screen is 
illuminated from behind by a plane wave, the aperture acts as a radiating surface, 
forming a radiation (or diffraction) pattern. By extension, an aperture has come to 
mean any radiating surface, or any bounded surface that can be treated as if it 
were the source of radiation. 
For a given antenna, the aperture is not unique. Any surface surrounding the 
antenna can be chosen arbitrarily as the aperture provided the fields and currents 
over the entire surface are taken into account [3]. The choice is made for analyti-
cal convenience in such a way that the fields and currents are negligible outside of 
a bounded area. In the case of a reflector-type antenna or an array antenna, the 
customary practice is to consider the aperture to be a surface (usually plane) 
bounded by the edge of the reflector or the edges of the array. 
An illumination function (or aperture function), in transmission, describes the 
amplitude and phase of the applicable polarization component of the electromag-
netic field at each point in the aperture as a function of its position. In reception, 
the illumination function describes the amplitude and phase weights applied to the 
contribution of the arriving wave to each element of the aperture in order to form 
the desired pattern. In a reflector-type antenna the illumination function is deter-
mined by the design of the reflector, feed system, and any power dividers, com-
biners, or hybrids that are used. In an array it is determined by amplitude and 
phase control of each element. 
2.3 PATTERNS, LOBES, AND BEAMS  
The terms antenna pattern, lobe, and beam have overlapping but somewhat differ-
ent meanings. 
For transmission, the antenna pattern describes the variation of the applicable 
polarization component of the electromagnetic field as a function of angle from a 
reference axis, as received at an observation point that varies in angle but remains 
at a constant range in the far field of the antenna. For reception, the antenna pat-
tern describes the variation of the signal received by the antenna from a source 
having the applicable polarization and located at a constant range in the far field, 
as a function of the angle of the source from a reference axis. The antenna pattern 
can be calculated from a knowledge of the illumination function, including the 
aperture over which it extends. In the physical-optics method of analysis (ap-
proximate, but adequate for most purposes) the antenna pattern is calculated by 
Fourier transformation of the illumination function, provided the aperture is a 

 
Terminology, Definitions, and Notation 
23 
plane surface and the pattern is expressed in sine space (see Section 2.8 and 
Chapter 7 for an explanation of sine space). 
In many measurements or calculations of antenna patterns, only amplitude (or 
power) is of interest. However, for a full analysis of some of the subtle aspects of 
monopulse, the phase as well as the amplitude of the pattern must be taken into 
account. 
A lobe, in a general sense, is a rounded projection or protuberance. When ap-
plied to an antenna pattern, it means a portion of the pattern between adjacent 
nulls or between adjacent pronounced dips. An interferometer pattern may have 
many lobes of nearly equal amplitude, but the common type of pattern in radar is 
one that has a single major lobe (mainlobe) and a number of much smaller minor 
lobes (sidelobes). The mainlobe in such cases is also called a beam. 
To summarize the distinctions among the three terms: 
1. Pattern is the general term describing the variation of a transmitted 
field or received signal as a function of angle. 
2. A lobe is a portion of a pattern between nulls or minima. 
3. If a pattern has a single principal lobe, much larger than the other 
lobes, the principal lobe is also called a beam. 
Figure 1.6 can serve as an illustration of the use of these terms. All the curves 
except the one marked d/s are antenna patterns. The main portions of the two in-
dividual squinted patterns and of the sum pattern can also be called beams or lobes 
(or mainlobes, when necessary to distinguish them from the sidelobes). The dif-
ference pattern is not usually called a beam, since it does not have a single pre-
dominant lobe. The main part of it is sometimes called a dual lobe or a split lobe. 
The curve d/s, the ratio of the difference to the sum, is not an antenna pattern 
but rather a nonlinear function of two patterns. 
The receiving patterns of a reflector-type antenna (at a specified frequency) 
are not determined uniquely by the shape and size of the reflector(s)2 and by the 
locations of the feed horns. They depend also on the points in the radar at which 
the outputs are taken, and what transformations, if any, have occurred between the 
feed horns and the outputs. 
To illustrate this point, consider the parabolic reflector with four-horn feed 
used as an illustration in Section 1.3. If an output were taken from the waveguide 
connected to one of the horns, it would form a beam squinted in a direction oppo-
site to that of the displacement of the horn from the focus. Four such outputs (i.e., 
four beams) could be formed simultaneously. The antenna patterns in this case 
would be the patterns of the squinted beams. On the other hand, if the waveguides 
are interconnected by RF hybrid junctions to form a sum and two differences, and 
if the outputs are taken after the hybrids, then the antenna patterns are those of the 
sum and differences. 
                                                           
2  The plural applies in Cassegrain antennas and certain other antennas having more than one reflector. 

24 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
It is with these considerations in mind that the general term “patterns” rather 
than the more restricted term “beams” is used in the definition of monopulse given 
in Section 2.1. Thus, the comparisons can be between component beams (e.g., the 
squinted beams in Section 1.3), between the sum and differences, or between the 
members of any set of simultaneous patterns, whether formed directly or obtained 
as combinations of other patterns. 
In this book antenna patterns always represent voltage, not power, unless oth-
erwise specified. The pattern is sometimes measured directly, or it can be calcu-
lated from the illumination function through the Fourier transform. A calculation 
for a rectangular aperture in the azimuth plane takes the form

where f is the voltage gain of the pattern, u = (w/λ)sinθ, θ is the azimuth angle in 
radians, g(x) is the illumination function, and x is the horizontal coordinate, nor-
malized to the aperture width w. The function g(x) is usually normalized so that in 
transmission the total power on the aperture is unity:

When that is done, the voltage f(u) from (2.1) is normalized to the maximum volt-
age available from a uniformly illuminated aperture. 
Forms equivalent to (2.1) for circular or elliptical apertures may be found in 
antenna texts. 
2.4 SUM AND DIFFERENCE PATTERNS 
In the baseline monopulse radar used as an illustration in Section 1.3, it is obvious 
why the sum and difference patterns are so called—they are obtained by addition 
and subtraction of the individual beam patterns produced by the four horns. It 
must be pointed out, however, that the patterns that were added or subtracted are 
not quite the same as those that would be obtained from the individual horns if the 
other horns were missing. They are not even the same as the outputs of the indi-
vidual horns in the four-horn cluster unless all four horns are properly terminated. 
The patterns are affected by mutual coupling; therefore, they should be considered 
as members of a group rather than as patterns standing alone. 
There are cases in which the interpretation of sum and difference patterns is 
not so obvious. For example, there is a type of monopulse design in which a single 
multimode feed horn [4, 5], together with suitable waveguide couplings, produces 

 
Terminology, Definitions, and Notation 
25 
simultaneous patterns similar to the sum and difference patterns of the baseline 
system. Even though these patterns are produced directly, without addition or 
subtraction, it is common practice to call them sum and difference patterns, or to 
use the initial letters of sum and difference as symbols. 
Another example is a five-horn monopulse feed system consisting of a central 
horn surrounded by four other horns. The central horn is used for a reference pat-
tern (and also for a transmitting pattern) and the outputs of the outer horns are 
combined in pairs to obtain two difference signals. The reference pattern is often 
called the sum pattern even though there is no summing, because it serves the 
same purpose as the sum pattern in the baseline system. 
In a corporate-fed array antenna any desired set of patterns can be formed in 
the feed structure, within the physical limitations of the antenna. The “sum” and 
“difference” patterns are usually formed directly rather than by the addition and 
subtraction of outputs of individual beams; in fact, outputs of the individual beams 
may not be available anywhere in the system. In a physical sense the individual 
beams are fictitious, but mathematically it is always possible to decompose the 
“sum” and “difference” patterns into a set of individual beams. 
We will use the term component patterns or component beams to describe a 
set of patterns, whether they exist physically or not, such that their sum and differ-
ences are identical to the given set of “sum” and “differences.” 
The term “sum pattern” could be replaced by the more general “reference 
pattern,” which would include not only patterns actually obtained by summing but 
also directly formed patterns that have similar form and serve the same purpose. 
The term “reference pattern” is in fact sometimes used, as in the case of the five-
horn feed mentioned above, but the term “sum pattern” is quite prevalent. There is 
no corresponding general term to replace “difference pattern.” 
An alternative pair of terms is “even pattern” and “odd pattern.” These terms 
are descriptive and general, and they are especially useful in the mathematical 
analysis of patterns and illumination functions, but they are not as widely used. 
By common usage, therefore, “sum” and “difference” are employed in a gen-
eralized sense. Even when they are not literally correct they can be rationalized by 
conceiving of component beams—actual or fictitious—which if added and sub-
tracted would produce the given sum and difference patterns. 
To illustrate, consider monopulse in one angular coordinate only. Let s and d 
represent the so-called sum and difference voltages and let v1 and v2 represent 
voltages from the (possibly fictitious) component beams. Then

26 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
The summing and differencing are usually done by a microwave device called a 
hybrid junction which accepts v1 and v2 as inputs and produces outputs s and d. 
The reason for the factor 
2  is that, assuming the use of passive lossless devices 
to form the sum and differences, the power out must equal the power in. When the 
sum and differences are formed from four beams, the factor is 2 instead of 
2 . 
Given any s and d, we can define component beam voltages v1 and v2 by in-
verting (2.3) and (2.4), regardless of whether v1 and v2 actually exist physically 
(i.e., are measureable) anywhere in the system:

(2.6) 
In two-coordinate monopulse we can assume that there are four unknown 
component beams. Given the sum and two differences, the three equations (1.1) to 
(1.3) are not sufficient to determine the four component beams uniquely.3 How-
ever, it does not matter whether the solution is unique or not. The individual 
beams will not be used in any quantitative analysis but only as a concept to sup-
port the use of the terms sum and difference. 
2.5 SUM AND DIFFERENCE NOTATION  
In most of the past literature on monopulse, the Greek letters Σ and Δ have been 
used to represent sum and difference voltages. These symbols have been used for 
the most part as voltage magnitudes, whereas in much of the analysis presented in 
this book the complex (phasor) nature of the voltage is essential. In some of the 
more recent monopulse literature, the Latin capital letters S and D have been used 
to designate phasor sum and difference voltages, but they may cause confusion 
because the capital letter S is commonly used to represent signal power. 
Hence we will use small letters s and d to designate sum and difference 
phasor voltage (that is, complex envelopes). However, symbols Σ and Δ will be 
used to identify sum and difference channels or output ports. Thus the conven-
tional practice of symbolizing the output ports of a hybrid junction by Σ and Δ will 
be followed, but the voltages appearing at these ports will be denoted by s and d. 
                                                           
3  In forming the sum and differences, a fourth output (B + C) − (A + D) becomes available as a by-
product. This output, called the quadrupolar signal, the diagonal difference, or the double difference, is 
usually terminated in a dummy load and not used. If this pattern is known in addition to the other three, 
there is enough information to solve uniquely for A, B, C, and D. Alternatively, the symmetry of the 
four component beams can be invoked to make the solution unique.

2.6 ERROR SIGNALS  
The original use of monopulse was in closed-loop, mechanically steered tracking 
radars. The servomechanism that drives the antenna requires as its input an error 
signal (in each coordinate) representing the difference between the target direction 
and the antenna pointing direction. When the two directions coincide, the error 
signal is zero. If read-outs from the mechanical rotation of the pedestal shafts are 
used as the sole indication of target direction, then the error signal really does rep-
resent the error in the angle output of the radar. 
In other situations error signals do not represent errors in the radar’s output 
data, but rather a means of obtaining or refining estimates of target direction. For 
example, some monopulse radars use an error correction technique, as explained 
in Section 1.3. This consists of a closed tracking loop with the shaft positions pro-
viding coarse angle estimates and the residual error signals providing corrections 
to the shaft position errors. There are other radars (or radar operating modes) in 
which the servo loop is not closed at all. Instead the beam axis is pointed in a pre-
programmed or precomputed direction that in general does not coincide with the 
target direction (although the target must be within the beam), and the open-loop 
monopulse error signal is used as a measure of the target direction relative to the 
known axis direction. Thus there can be an error signal without any error in the 
radar’s data output. 
In some cases the error signal can be zero when there is actually a large error 
in the indicated target position. For example, in the case of target glint, unresolved 
targets or multipath, a closed-loop tracker may faithfully follow the apparent tar-
get direction (thus nulling the error signal), but that direction may differ greatly 
from the true direction of the desired target. 
To prevent confusion, the monopulse output that provides an indication of 
target direction relative to the axis direction will be called normalized difference 
signal (where applicable), or more generally the monopulse processor output. The 
word error will be reserved for use in the sense of the difference between the ra-
dar’s indicated angle and the true angle. 
2.7 COMPLEX SIGNAL REPRESENTATION AND COMPLEX  
 
ENVELOPES  
Complex notation for alternating currents, voltages, and electromagnetic field 
quantities is in common use and will be employed extensively in this volume in 
analyzing radar signals and noise. A brief review will be given here. 
The word “complex” is used here in the mathematical sense of having a real 
part and an imaginary part. Thus a complex number z can be written as

In mathematics and physics the symbol i is used to denote imaginary quantities. 
The equivalent symbol j is more common in engineering applications. 
The conventional method of representing a complex quantity graphically is to 
plot the real and imaginary parts as the horizontal and vertical coordinates, re-
spectively, of a point in the complex plane, as illustrated in Figure 2.1. 
There is a well-known mathematical relationship, Euler’s formula:

(2.14) 
It must be kept in mind that setting a real quantity such as an instantaneous volt-
age v(t) equal to a complex expression, as in (2.14), is a kind of shorthand. Only 
the real part of the complex expression actually represents the voltage. 
A complex quantity representing a voltage (or an electric field strength) is 
also called a phasor. It may be represented graphically by a line with length pro-
portional to the amplitude and an angle with respect to a reference line equal to 
the phase angle. It is also sometimes called a vector voltage, but the term phasor is 
preferred (see definition of phasor in [1, p. 819]). 
The advantage of the complex shorthand notation is not apparent from a 
comparison of (2.12) and (2.14)—the first one in fact looks simpler—but in the 
analysis of modulation, frequency translation, or other processing, the mathemati-
cal manipulations are greatly simplified by the complex notation. In particular, 
complex notation makes it possible to express carrier waveforms, modulation, 
frequency translations, and other operations as separable factors. 
An example will illustrate the advantage of complex notation and at the same 
time will help to resolve a point of confusion that sometimes arises as to when the 
imaginary part must be retained and when it is to be discarded or ignored. Let the 
sinusoidal voltage in (2.12) be amplitude-modulated by a time-varying multiplier 
am(t) and simultaneously phase-modulated by a time-varying phase shift φm(t).

(2.18) 
The real part of (2.18) is the same as (2.15). This confirms that the complex 
notation yields the correct result. The big advantage of the complex form, for our 
purpose, is shown by (2.17); the final voltage can be expressed as (the real part of) 
the product of the carrier voltage v(t) expressed in complex form and a complex 
modulation envelope (or simply complex envelope) m(t) that includes both ampli-
tude and phase. 
The information content of a signal (except for its frequency or Doppler shift) 
is in the complex envelope, not in the carrier; because of this fact, we will be able 
to simplify much of the subsequent analysis by dealing only with the complex 
envelope and omitting the carrier (which should be understood but need not be 
written). This convenient means of separating the carrier and the envelope is not 
possible when real notation is used, as in (2.15). 
Whenever complex notation is used for a physical quantity that is inherently 
real, such as an instantaneous voltage, only the real part has physical meaning; the 
imaginary part is to be ignored. “Instantaneous” voltage means the value of the 
voltage at each instant within a cycle, not merely the amplitude of the envelope. In 
(2.14), v(t) is an instantaneous voltage, and so is vr(t) in (2.17) and (2.18). 
However, when a real, instantaneous voltage is written in complex form as 
the product of two or more complex factors, it is not permissible to drop the 
imaginary part of any individual factor. Thus in (2.17) it would not be correct to 
drop the imaginary part of v(t) or the imaginary part of m(t). Only the imaginary 
part of the product, vr(t), is to be dropped. 
In (2.16), m(t) was expressed in terms of its amplitude am(t) and its phase φ(t). 
Alternatively, m(t) can be expressed in terms of its real and imaginary parts I and 
Q respectively, usually called the in-phase and quadrature modulation compo-
nents:

(2.19) 
In speaking of a complex modulation envelope we do not necessarily mean 
that we actually start with a carrier and modulate it, in the same way that voice 
signals modulate a carrier in radio. However, the received signals and noise in 
radar can be represented as if they resulted from a carrier modulated by a complex

31 
signal, of which the amplitude and phase correspond respectively to the amplitude 
and phase modulation of the carrier. 
While the carrier oscillates at RF, the modulation envelope varies much more 
slowly. According to Shannon’s sampling theorem [6], if the signal is limited to a 
bandwidth W, complex samples of the envelope (i.e., samples of I and Q) at inter-
vals 1/W are sufficient to reconstruct the complex envelope—that is, to determine 
its value at every instant. Typically in a radar, 
 
1
W ≈
τ  
(2.20) 
where τ is the pulse width (actual width of a simple pulse or compressed width of 
a coded pulse), and can also be regarded as the time duration of a range cell. A 
useful approximation, therefore, is to regard the real and imaginary parts of the 
modulation envelope (I and Q) as being confined to an effective bandwidth of 
about the reciprocal of the pulse length. The amplitude and phase can have much 
wider bandwidths, since they are nonlinear functions of I and Q. However, they 
can be reconstructed indirectly from amplitude and phase samples at intervals 1/W 
by converting the samples to I and Q, reconstructing I and Q, and then converting 
the reconstructed I and Q back to amplitude and phase. 
The complex envelope remains unchanged upon frequency conversion from 
RF to IF provided the local-oscillator frequency is below the RF. If the local-os-
cillator frequency is above the RF, the phase of the complex envelope is inverted; 
in other words the IF complex envelope in this case is the complex conjugate of 
the RF complex envelope. 
The complex envelope will be encountered repeatedly in this book, usually 
referred to simply as “complex voltage” or “phasor voltage,” with the tacit under-
standing that it is to be regarded as modulating a carrier. This concept is 
meaningful in radar because most radar signals and noise can be considered 
narrowband in the sense that the bandwidth seldom exceeds 10% of the RF center 
frequency (i.e., 5% on each side), and is usually much less. 
A more comprehensive treatment of complex signal representation can be 
found in [7]. 
2.8 ELEVATION, AZIMUTH, AND TRAVERSE  
The basic mathematical relations presented in this section apply to both mechani-
cally and electronically steered antennas, but the discussion and illustrations apply 
primarily to the former. The application to electronically steered arrays requires 
further elaboration, to be presented in Chapter 7 and Section 8.3. 
Target direction from a land-based radar is usually expressed in the angular 
coordinates of azimuth and elevation, and if the radar uses a mechanically steered 

32 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
antenna, those are also the usual coordinates of mechanical rotation; they are not 
the same as the pair of angular coordinates in which the monopulse radar senses 
target direction. 
When a radar is mounted on a ship or other moving surface platform, the 
same relationships hold provided the deck rather than the horizontal surface is 
used as the reference. The conversion from moving deck coordinates to fixed co-
ordinates involves additional geometry but does not affect the basic relationship 
between the monopulse sensing coordinates and the servo drive coordinates. In 
airborne or missile-borne radar, a reference plane that includes the longitudinal 
axis and is horizontal when that axis is at zero elevation is used, and angles from 
this plane are called pitch (corresponding to elevation) and yaw (corresponding to 
azimuth from the nose). 
In order to present the relationships and show how the monopulse sensing co-
ordinates are converted to servo drive coordinates, we will confine our attention to 
land-based radars. In the usual design of a mechanically rotatable antenna mount, 
there are either one or two axes of rotation. (Three-axis mounts have also been 
built for special applications.) If there is one axis, it is usually vertical. The angle 
of rotation about the vertical axis is azimuth. The vertical axis is therefore called 
the azimuth axis.4 
If there are two axes of rotation, the usual design is called an azimuth-eleva-
tion (frequently abbreviated as az-el) mount, and is illustrated in Figure 2.2. The 
lower axis (the azimuth axis) is vertical, and azimuth is defined as in the single-
axis case. The portion of the mount that rotates on that axis carries a horizontal 
axis (the elevation axis), and the angle of rotation about that axis is elevation, 
measured upward from horizontal. The antenna itself (the reflector) is mounted so 
that its axis (the beam axis or the boresight axis) is perpendicular to the elevation 
axis. The drawing is simplified in order to make the azimuth axis, elevation axis, 
and boresight axis visible. The counterpoise is a massive solid piece added so that 
the part of the structure that rotates in elevation will have its center of gravity on 
the elevation axis. Omitted from the drawing are a number of other components 
such as the drive motors, antenna feed assembly, and waveguides. Photographs of 
an actual monopulse antenna and its mount are shown in Chapter 4. 
The following simple analogy aids in visualizing azimuth and elevation: If the 
antenna were placed at the center of the earth with its azimuth axis aligned with 
the earth’s axis of rotation, azimuth and elevation would correspond to longitude 
and latitude respectively. 
The natural coordinate system for a planar aperture, however, is sine space 
(also called cosine space when referring to the complementary angles). Planar

azimuth or train.

apertures can be interpreted to include not only arrays but also the apertures of 
reflector antennas.5

5  The following discussion assumes that the illumination in the aperture plane, for the pattern under 
consideration, has uniform or uniformly tapered phase. This is not quite true in a reflector antenna, but 
it is a close representation.

where α′, β′, and γ′ are the complements of α, β, and γ respectively. The u-v-w 
coordinate system is called either sine space or cosine space, depending on the 
point of view.

The geometric interpretation of these angles is as follows: α′ is the angle between 
the given direction and the x-z plane; β′ is the angle between the given direction 
and the x-z plane; γ is the angle off broadside (of an array) or off axis (of a reflec-
tor antenna). 
In array antennas that can be steered electronically, angles α and β and their 
complements have no standardized names. They are usually identified simply by 
symbols such as those used here, either in angle space or in sine space. In reflector 
antennas, however, α′ is called the traverse angle and β′ is loosely called the ele-
vation angle (relative to the antenna axis elevation). The latter is an approxima-
tion, exact only when the traverse angle is zero. 
In a reflector antenna the traverse and elevation normalized difference signals 
are zero when α′ and β′ are zero and are approximately proportional to α′ and β′ 
respectively when those angles are small. In an array that can be steered electroni-
cally, the normalized difference signals are approximately proportional respec-
tively to the u and v components of the deviation of the given direction from the 
beam pointing direction in sine space. 
Let A be the azimuth of a given direction relative to the antenna pointing di-
rection. Angle A is measured clockwise in the horizontal plane from the projection 
of the axis (the broadside direction or boresight axis) to the projection of the given 
direction. Let E be the elevation of the given direction measured upward from the 
horizontal plane, and let Ea be the elevation of the aperture normal. Ea is called the 
tilt angle in the case of an array or the axis elevation angle in the case of a reflec-
tor antenna. The relations between these quantities and angles α′ and β′ are [8]:

(2.28) 
Note that (2.27) and (2.28) are independent of the elevation of the antenna axis. 
Equation (2.28) is the basis of the “secant correction” in mechanically steered 
tracking radars. The monopulse traverse output is approximately proportional to 
α′ but the servo requires an input approximately proportional to A in order to 
maintain proper loop gain. The conversion is accomplished by generating a multi-
plying factor proportional to the secant of the antenna elevation angle Ea. This is 
not quite the same as the secant of the target elevation E demanded by (2.28), but 
since E − Ea is usually only a fraction of a degree and since the servo input need 
not be exactly proportional to A, the approximation suffices at elevation angles up 
to about 85° (sec 85° = 11.5). The secant correction is done by a secant-wound 
potentiometer in some radars and by computer in others. 
The more exact equation, (2.27), may appear puzzling in one respect. As the 
target approaches the zenith, secE approaches infinity. If α′ is not equal to zero, 
then sinA must also approach infinity, but sinA cannot exceed 1 in magnitude. 
The seeming paradox is resolved by noting that as E → 90°, the possible target 
locations are confined to a decreasing cone that shrinks to a vertical line (which is 
in the y-z plane). Hence as E → 90°, α′ → 0. When E = 90°, A is indeterminate. 
If A = 0, then (2.26) reduces to

(2.29) 
Hence the target elevation equals the antenna elevation plus β′ if the target 
traverse is zero, and for small values of A this is still a good approximation, since 
cosA ≅ 1 when A is small. However, if E is close to 90°, A tends to grow large, 
and the approximation breaks down. The exact equation for E in terms of α′ and 
β′ is obtained by eliminating A from (2.25) and (2.26). The result is

The distinction between azimuth and traverse is sometimes explained (as it 
was in Chapter 1) by saying that they are measured in the horizontal plane and the 
slant plane respectively. Although this statement is imprecise, its simplicity makes 

36 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
it useful in visualizing the relationship, at least in a gross manner. To make the 
statement more precise insofar as traverse is concerned, one must specify that: 
1. The slant plane is the one perpendicular to the vertical boresight 
plane and containing the line of sight to the target, and 
2. The traverse angle is measured from the intersection of that slant 
plane with the vertical boresight plane.6 
Figure 2.3 illustrates the geometrical relations expressed by (2.27). The line 
labeled “beam axis” in the diagram refers to a mechanically steered antenna. A 
more general designation would be “normal to the antenna aperture.” Thus in the 
case of an electronically steered array that line represents the broadside direction. 
Figure 2.4 shows how a square in sine space, centered at the boresight direc-
tion, maps into az-el coordinate space, at various values of the boresight elevation 
Ea. The corners of the square in array coordinates are ±1° in traverse (α′) and ±1° 
in antenna-coordinate elevation (β′), as in Figure 2.4(a). The center of the square 
is the boresight direction. Figure 2.4(b) shows the corresponding areas in az-el 
space for antenna boresight elevations of 0°, 60°, and 75°. The coordinates of the 
corners of these three areas are as shown in Table 2.1.

At 0° boresight elevation the az-el area differs by a negligible amount from a 
square with corners at (±1°, ±1°). As the boresight elevation increases, the area 
becomes elongated in azimuth while the elevation remains equal to β′ at the center 
and only slightly less than β′ at the edges. 
If a target passes close to the zenith, the azimuth rate tends to become ex-
tremely high. No matter how exact the conversion from the natural α′, β′ coordi-
nates of the monopulse outputs to az-el, track may be lost because the servo drive 
is unable to keep up with the target azimuth rate. 
The azimuth and elevation of a target relative to the antenna normal are the 
differences between the azimuths and elevations respectively of the target and 
antenna normal referred to fixed geographical coordinates, usually north and hori-
zontal. If target direction and antenna normal direction are interchanged, their 
relative azimuth and elevation are merely reversed in sign.

Traverse and antenna-coordinate elevations (β′), on the other hand, are de-
fined only in the coordinate system determined by the antenna orientation and 
cannot be transformed to a different coordinate system (e.g., a different antenna 
orientation) by simple addition. If target direction and antenna normal direction 
are interchanged, the new traverse and antenna-coordinate elevation are not ob-
tained by merely reversing the signs, although in many cases a close approxima-
tion may be obtained in that manner.

The Monopulse Output as a Complex  
Ratio 
In this chapter we extend the concepts introduced in Chapters 1 and 2 and formu-
late general principles and equations that will be used later in classifying and 
analyzing various specific types of monopulse.  
3.1 GENERAL PRINCIPLES  
All monopulse processors are intended to produce outputs that depend only on 
ratios, not absolute values, of signal voltages. Any sensitivity that they have to 
absolute values is due to design compromises or equipment imperfections. 
In a general sense, the ratio of two voltages means their complex ratio. The 
phasor voltages (complex envelopes) of a monopulse difference d and sum s can 
be expressed as1

(3.4) 
The phasor relationships are illustrated in Figure 3.1. Thus the complex ratio has a 
magnitude equal to the ratio of the magnitudes of the two voltages and a phase 
equal to their relative phase or phase difference. 
The complex ratio of the difference voltage in each coordinate to the sum 
voltage contains essentially all the information about the target direction that is 
available from the received monopulse signals. Theoretically, additional informa-
tion may be contained in the ratio of the unused diagonal difference voltage to the 
sum voltage. Section 15.2 discusses the diagonal difference voltage and shows 
that the information it contributes is unimportant for most practical purposes. 
The equivalent of d/s could be obtained in other ways. For example, if d and s 
are the difference and sums of voltages v1 and v2 from two individual beams or 
from two pairs of beams, then

Hence, by measuring the complex ratio v2/v1 we could calculate d/s or vice versa. 
The two ratios contain equivalent information, and other relevant ratios can be 
formed from linear combinations of the voltages.

The Monopulse Output as a Complex Ratio 
41 
However, d/s is the most widely used form of monopulse ratio and it is ana-
lytically convenient. It is logical to regard it as the fundamental monopulse ratio. 
When other signal voltage ratios or associated quantities are encountered, we will 
show how they are related to d/s. 
Voltage amplitude ratios and relative phases are not necessarily measured or 
computed directly. Equivalent information can be derived indirectly. For example, 
the equivalent of the amplitude ratio is obtained in some radars by taking the dif-
ference of the outputs of logarithmic amplifiers; the tangent or some other func-
tion of the relative phase angle may be measured instead of the angle itself. Alter-
natively, the I (in-phase) and Q (quadrature-phase) components of the difference 
and sum signals relative to a common reference oscillator can be produced and the 
real and imaginary parts of d/s can be computed from those components. 
3.2 RELATIVE PHASE OF DIFFERENCE AND SUM  
In the description of the baseline radar model used for illustration in Section 1.3, it 
was stated that the relative phase δ of d and s is 0° or 180°. For brevity, “in-phase” 
will be interpreted to include both 0° and 180°. The in-phase condition applies to 
many monopulse radars, but in others the relative phase of d and s is ±90° (quad-
rature phase) depending on the type of antenna, feed system, and microwave com-
biners that form the sum and difference. 
For δ = 0°, 180°, and ±90°, the values of exp( jδ) in (3.3) are 1, −1, and ± j, 
respectively. It might appear, therefore, that d/s is pure real or pure imaginary and 
that there is no need to treat it as a complex quantity. As a matter of fact, the usual 
monopulse processor extracts only the real or imaginary part, depending on the 
type of monopulse. 
However, the in-phase or quadrature-phase relationship of d and s is an ide-
alization. In practice, d and s can have any relative phase because of noise, inter-
ference, multipath, unresolved targets (including a single target with multiple 
scattering points), or nonideal design, construction, and alignment [1, 2]. Thus, 
even when d/s is supposedly real, it can have a significant imaginary part (or vice 
versa) under certain conditions. To analyze the effects of these factors and to 
understand certain techniques that have been proposed to improve performance, 
the ratio d/s must be treated as a complex quantity.  
We will refer to the in-phase or quadrature-phase relationship of d and s 
under ideal conditions as the nominal phase relationship.

Referring to Section 1.3 and Figure 1.1, we see that the baseline radar model 
described there produces only the real part (or in-phase component) of the com-
plex ratio d/s. Circuits that perform this operation will be described in Chapter 8. 
The imaginary part (or quadrature component) could also be extracted, if it were 
needed, by adding another channel to the monopulse processor for each angular 
component. The added channel would work in the same way except that either the 
d or s input voltage would be shifted by 90°. Normally the imaginary part is not 
used because ideally the target contributes only to the real part, while the imagi-
nary part is due to noise or other disturbances. Similarly, in radars that produce d 
and s in nominal quadrature phase, only the imaginary part of d/s is normally 
processed. Because of practical constraints, the actual output of a monopulse 
processor is usually not exactly the real or imaginary part of d/s, but an approxi-
mation. 
The complex ratio d/s can also be expressed in “I and Q” form. The I and Q 
components of the difference signal, denoted by dI and dQ, are the in-phase and 
quadrature components relative to a reference oscillator at the signal frequency 
(usually at IF). From (3.1) and Figure 3.1, we have

In some radars, the I and Q components of d and s are extracted and digitized, 
then Re(d/s) or Im(d/s) is computed by (3.19) or (3.20). 
If the phase of the reference oscillator were changed, all four of the quantities 
dI, dQ, sI, and sQ would change, but in such a way that Re(d/s) and Im(d/s), as 
computed by (3.19) and (3.20), would remain invariant. 
Although all monopulse processors produce a ratio, some of them do so by 
means of a device known as a “product detector,” implying multiplication. In the 
receivers preceding the product detector, the sum voltage is operated upon by 

44 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
AGC, which causes the voltage gain to vary as 1/|s|, so that the sum voltage out of 
the receiver is proportional to s/|s|; in other words, the sum voltage amplitude is 
held constant while phase is preserved. The same AGC voltage that acts on the 
sum channel also controls the gain of the difference channel, so that the difference 
receiver output is proportional to d/|s|. The product detector accepts the voltages 
from the sum and difference receivers and produces an output proportional to the 
product of their amplitudes and the cosine of their relative phase angle. That is, 
after adjustment of the scale factor,

(3.21) 
which is the real part of d/s, as expressed in (3.9). 
In practice, an ordinary AGC circuit will not hold the sum voltage at a con-
stant level on each pulse, as is assumed in (3.21). This means that the product-
detector output, which ideally should be independent of signal voltage, will vary 
to some degree with signal voltage, and the scale factor in the equation will vary 
accordingly. For closed-loop tracking the effect of this variation is minor, since 
the null direction is unchanged and the change in servo loop gain is usually small. 
However, in radars that use the error signal to determine the angular position of 
the target relative to the beam axis, other methods of obtaining the result 
expressed by (3.21), described in Chapter 8, are preferred.

Components Used in Monopulse 
Many types of components are common to radars in general, including monopulse 
radars. Certain components, however, are either unique to monopulse or are de-
signed and used in a special way for monopulse, or with more demanding re-
quirements. Principal components of these types are discussed and illustrated in 
this chapter. Omitted from this chapter, however, are monopulse processors. Be-
cause of their importance and the multiplicity of forms that they can take, they are 
treated separately in Chapter 8. 
4.1 ANTENNA MOUNTS  
Antenna mounts of mechanically steered monopulse radars are basically no differ-
ent from those of other mechanically steered radars, but the requirements in many 
cases are more severe. Antenna mounts are subject to several mechanical sources 
of angular error (see Section 7.4). 
Because monopulse is capable of higher angular accuracy than other methods 
of radar angle measurement and tracking, the units must be designed and built to 
more demanding specifications in order not to limit the attainable accuracy. The 
boresighting and alignment procedures must be more painstaking and provisions 
must be made for adjustments where needed. 
Many different types of mounts have been devised [1], ranging from a single 
axis of rotation to three or even four axes, but in the large majority of radars either 
single-axis or two-axis mounts are used. The single axis is usually azimuth. 
(These terms were defined in Section 2.8.) A single-axis mount obviously does 
not permit closed-loop tracking in both coordinates but monopulse can be used for 
closed-loop tracking in azimuth or open-loop measurements in elevation, or both. 
Open-loop azimuth monopulse can also be used in a search radar scanning me-

46 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
chanically in azimuth. The monopulse provides a fine measure of target angle 
(“beam splitting”) to supplement the relatively coarse angle indication obtained 
from the basic search mode. 
Most land-based tracking radars, including monopulse trackers, have eleva-
tion-over-azimuth two-axis mounts, illustrated in simplified form in Figure 2.2. 
The monopulse outputs provide measures of traverse (α′) and antenna-coordinate 
elevation (β′), which are related to the azimuth and elevation angles by equations 
given in Section 2.8. 
As pointed out in Chapter 1, monopulse is capable of a higher data rate than 
sequential lobing and therefore is better suited to tracking of rapidly moving and 
accelerating targets. High angular rates and accelerations are not necessarily those 
of the target itself; they can occur because of the coordinate conversion from an-
tenna coordinates to azimuth and elevation, as explained in Section 2.8. In order to 
utilize the superior data-rate capability of monopulse, the mounts must have suffi-
ciently powerful drives to follow the target motion. 
To carry signals and power between fixed equipment and a rotating antenna, 
it is necessary to use rotating joints, sliprings, wind-up cables, or similar devices. 
With monopulse this requirement is somewhat more demanding than with sequen-
tial lobing because there are usually three receiving channels in monopulse and 
only one in sequential lobing. The antenna rotation must not disturb the amplitude 
and phase balance of the three channels or introduce distortion. For this reason, 
the monopulse receivers are often mounted on the antenna, so that their RF inputs 
need not be passed through rotating or flexing transmission lines. 
Although elevation is defined only up to 90° (the zenith), in some antenna 
mounts the antenna can be plunged—that is, rotated in elevation through the ze-
nith down to the horizon on the opposite side. Plunging is used as an aid in bore-
sighting and alignment. If the antenna is to track correctly when plunged, the po-
larity of the azimuth drive must be reversed. 
Most mounts also allow the antenna to be rotated below horizontal to small 
negative elevation angles in order to track targets that are lower than the antenna. 
The photographs in Figures 4.1 and 4.2 are two views of the antenna and 
mount of the AN/FPS-16 monopulse tracking radar. The basic structure is the 
same as in the simplified sketch, Figure 2.2, but the actual equipment has a more 
extensive antenna support structure and additional components such as drive mo-
tors, antenna feed assembly, and waveguides. 
4.2 ANTENNAS  
An antenna is the portion of a radar that radiates power from the transmitter into 
space or collects power from an incoming wave, to be transferred to a receiver. It 
can be described as a device that provides coupling or impedance matching be-

tween the transmitter and space or between space and the receiver. A single an-
tenna can be shared by one or more transmitters and one or more receivers. Mo-
nopulse is concerned primarily with reception. Some of the antenna terminology 
had its origin in transmission but by reciprocity it applies to reception as well. 
Three main categories of antennas used in monopulse radar (as well as in 
other radars) are lenses, reflectors, and arrays, and each category can be divided 
into various types. The principal distinction between monopulse antennas and 
similar antennas used for other purposes is the nature of their feeds. Although the 
feeds are really part of the antennas, they will be described separately in the next 
subsection. 
The remainder of this section pertains primarily to mechanically scanned an-
tennas, but components and techniques used in monopulse arrays are also dis-
cussed. Monopulse in array systems is described in Chapter 7. 
4.2.1 
Lens Antennas 
Lens antennas of various types have been built [2, 3]. One type is constructed of 
dielectric material, in which the phase velocity is less than in air. Such lenses are 
 
Figure 4.1   AN/FPS-16 antenna, side view. (Figure courtesy RCA.) 

48 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
similar to optical lenses. Since the usual purpose of a microwave lens in reception 
is to cause a wave from a distant source (essentially a plane wave) to converge at 
the feed in the focal plane, the dielectric lens is a convex figure of revolution, as 
illustrated in cross section in Figure 4.3(a). 
Another type of lens antenna is the metal-plate lens [4], illustrated in cross 
section in Figure 4.3(b), composed of plates parallel to the E-vector, spaced so 
that the phase velocity in the waveguides formed by adjacent pairs of plates is 
considerably greater that in air. To produce convergence, the lens must therefore 
be concave. Although the plates run in only one dimension, the converging effect 
is two-dimensional if the surface is concave in both dimensions. Because the 
phase velocity is a strong function of frequency, the useful bandwidth is small. 
In both parts of Figure 4.3 a single feed horn is shown in order to illustrate the 
action of the lens. A lens used for amplitude-comparison monopulse would have 
 
Figure 4.2   AN/FPS-16 antenna, rear view. (Figure courtesy RCA.) 

 
Components Used in Monopulse

multiple feed horns in the focal plane, displaced from the axis. If lenses were to be 
used for phase-comparison monopulse, there would be multiple lenses side by 
side, each with a single feed horn. 
To reduce the thickness and weight of dielectric or metal-plate lenses, they 
can be “stepped” or “zoned.” Progressing from the thinnest part of the lens, the 
thickness increases within each zone as in the basic lens, but at the zone bounda-
ries the thickness is decreased in successive steps of one wavelength, causing 
phase steps of 360° across the aperture. These steps theoretically have no effect, 
since 360° is equivalent to 0°. However, such lenses are narrowband, since the 
one-wavelength steps must be matched to a particular frequency. Furthermore, the 
steps cause some shadowing and discontinuity, resulting in energy loss and in-
creased sidelobes. 
Still another type of lens antenna is the constrained metal lens [5], which con-
sists of waveguides, or of metal plates perpendicular to the E-vector, connecting 
the inner and outer faces. The phase velocity is approximately the same as in air, 
with little frequency sensitivity, permitting operation over a wider frequency band 
than the metal-plate lens described above. The converging effect is achieved by 
arranging the lengths and orientations of the guides so that the wave in each guide 
follows an indirect path between corresponding points on the two faces, with 
longer length at the center than at the edges.

Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
4.2.2 
Single-Reflector Antennas 
Although lens antennas have some advantages and have been used in monopulse 
systems, reflector antennas are more common in mechanically steered monopulse 
radars. Typically the reflector surface is a paraboloid constructed of aluminum, 
steel, or metal-coated plastic. It is colloquially called a “dish.” If different beam-
widths in the two dimensions are desired, the surface is still a paraboloid but the 
contour of the edges may be an ellipse instead of a circle. The reflecting surface 
may be perforated or constructed of mesh in order to reduce weight and wind 
loading. 
Figure 4.4 shows a cross section of a paraboloidal reflector (any section paral-
lel to the axis is a parabola), and traces the paths of rays arriving parallel to the 
axis. According to geometrical optics, the rays, after reflection, would all con-
verge at the focal point, producing an infinite power density at that point. Geomet-
rical optics, however, is only an approximation. The power is actually distributed 
in a diffraction pattern in the vicinity of the focal point with maximum (but finite) 
density at that point [6]. If the wave arrives at an angle to the axis, the point of 
maximum power density is displaced from the axis in the opposite direction. 
A disadvantage of this type of antenna is that the feed, including its 
waveguides and support structure, is in front. The blockage thus created causes 
some loss in power, an increase in sidelobes, and an error in monopulse angle 
measurement. A lens antenna, in contrast, suffers no blockage by the feed, al-
though it has other disadvantages mentioned in Section 4.2.1. However, progress 
in the science and technology of feed design over the years has resulted in more 
compact feeds for reflector antennas, reducing the blockage problem.

4.2.3 
Cassegrain (Double-Reflector) Antennas 
The Cassegrain antenna is the microwave analog of the optical technique named 
after its inventor and long used in optical telescopes. It is illustrated in Figure 4.5. 
The main reflector is a paraboloid and the subreflector is a hyperboloid. One of 
the two foci of the hyperboloid is coincident with the focus of the paraboloid. The 
feed is placed at the other focus of the hyperboloid, which is at, or slightly in front 
of, the main reflector. According to the approximate ray-tracing method of geo-
metric optics, a plane wave arriving in the axial direction would be concentrated at 
that focal point, but more refined analysis shows that there is a diffraction pattern 
with peak intensity at the focal point. 
The advantages of a Cassegrain antenna over a single-reflector antenna are a 
more compact antenna structure and reduction of length of transmission lines to 
the feed. These features are especially useful in large monopulse antennas, since 
the cluster of feed horns and associated hybrid junctions and waveguides tends to 
be bulky and heavy. If placed in front of the reflector, such feeds are difficult to 
support adequately to prevent excessive deflection due to angular acceleration and 
gravity. In the Cassegrain configuration the only component that needs to be sup-
ported in front of the main reflector is the subreflector, which is lighter than the 
feed assembly and is positioned closer to the main reflector. However, because of 
blockage by the subreflector, the Cassegrain design is ordinarily not advantageous 
in antennas having a beamwidth greater than about 1°.

52 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
4.2.4 
Polarization-Twisting Reflector Systems 
Blockage by the subreflector can be overcome or reduced, and the use of Cas-
segrain antennas can be extended to beamwidths greater than 1°, with a technique 
called polarization twisting. This has been used in some applications, limited to 
antennas designed for a single polarization. One form of this technique [3] will be 
described in terms of transmission; by reciprocity, the same principle holds in 
reception. Supposed vertical polarization is desired. Then the feed horns are de-
signed for horizontal polarization. The subreflector is composed of a grating of 
horizontal wires laid out to form a hyperbolic contour (see Figure 4.6). The grat-
ing is almost as effective as a continuous hyperbolic surface in reflecting the hori-
zontally polarized radiation from the horns back toward the main reflector.  
The main reflector has the usual parabolic shape, but in addition there is a 
grating of wires placed one-quarter wavelength in front of the surface. These 
wires are oriented at 45° from horizontal. The horizontally polarized wave from 
the subreflector can be decomposed into two equal, orthogonally polarized com-
ponents, one parallel to the 45° wires and the other perpendicular to the wires. The 
wires reflect the parallel component but are essentially transparent to the perpen-
dicular component, which is reflected from the main reflector surface with an ad-
ditional half-wavelength two-way path length. Thus a 180° difference in the rela-
tive phase of the two components is introduced, and their resultant is converted 
from horizontal to vertical polarization. The horizontal subreflector wires are

transparent to the vertically polarized wave and therefore cause very little block-
age. There are other versions of this design, one of the objectives being to de-
crease the frequency-dependence in order to permit broadband operation. 
The principle of polarization twisting has also been applied in a class of an-
tennas in which the feed illuminates the concave side of a fixed parabolic reflector 
composed of wires parallel to the feed polarization vector, supported by a low-loss 
dielectric material (Figure 4.7). The paraboloid reflects the wave back to a planar 
twist reflector whose center is near the feed aperture. The planar reflector rotates 
the polarization by 90° and directs the wave back toward the paraboloid, which is 
now transparent because the wires are perpendicular to the polarization vector. 
The beam can be scanned over a wide angle by mechanical rotation of the planar 
reflector while the feed and the parabolic reflector remain fixed. Advantages of 
this design are that the planar reflector has much less rotational inertia than a con-
ventional antenna, and no RF joints are required, since the feed remains station-
ary. Although this type of antenna differs from the classical Cassegrain design, it 
is considered to belong to the Cassegrain family because it uses two reflectors.

4.3 FEEDS 
A feed is that part of an antenna that distributes power from the transmitter to the 
main aperture (a lens, reflector or array) in a desired manner and collects the 
power captured by the aperture with some desired weighting for transfer to a re-
ceiver. Two general classes of feeds are distinguished: 
1. An optical or space feed radiates power to (or receives power from) 
the main aperture, through open space. The desired amplitude and 
phase distribution over the area of the aperture is achieved by the 
combination of the geometry and the radiation pattern of the feed. 
2. A constrained (or corporate) feed distributes power from the 
transmitter to the elements of the aperture, or combines the power 
received by the antenna elements, through waveguides or transmis-
sion lines. The desired amplitude and phase distribution is achieved 
by power dividers or combiners, transmission line lengths, and 
phase shifters. 
Dipoles, waveguide horns, and other types of space feeds are used in lens and 
reflector antennas. In monopulse, horns are most often used. They are essentially 
waveguides with flared ends. 
In particular, a widely used type of feed in amplitude-comparison monopulse 
consists of a cluster of four feed horns, offset symmetrically from the focus, as 
illustrated in Figure 1.3. Figure 1.3(b) is a view looking into the aperture of the 
four feed horns, which are labeled A, B, C, and D to correspond with the squinted 
beams shown in Figure 1.4. The upper horns produce the lower beams. The size of 
the horns is exaggerated for clarity in Figure 1.3. The dimensions of a horn aper-
ture are of the order of a wavelength, while the diameter of a reflector is typically 
tens of wavelengths and may exceed 100 wavelengths. The waveguides leading 
from the horns could be connected to individual receivers but instead they are 
usually connected to a device called a comparator that forms the sum and two 
differences of the voltages of the horns. The sum and the differences then go to 
receivers. 
The square shape of the horns shown in Figure 1.3(b) does not necessarily 
portray the actual construction, but is a customary diagrammatic representation. 
Figure 4.8 is a photograph looking into the aperture of the feed of the AN/FPS-16 
radar. The horns are rectangular rather than square, designed for vertical polariza-
tion. At first glance it appears that there are only two horns but closer inspection 
reveals four. In earlier feed designs the horizontal septum1 and the vertical septum 
came flush to the front surface. However, the vertical septum acted as a short for 
the vertical E-field, causing a null. Thus, the E-field distribution across the feed 
aperture for the sum pattern was approximately as in Figure 4.9(a), whereas the

waveguides.

desired distribution is as shown in Figure 4.9(b). The null at the center reduced the 
sum-pattern efficiency and increased the sidelobes. In the later design the per-
formance was greatly improved by cutting the vertical septum back so that it does 
not extend all the way to the aperture, as can be seen in Figure 4.8. The resulting 
field distribution more nearly resembles that of Figure 4.9(b). 
The circular metal plate surrounding the feed aperture, including the raised 
bosses above and below the horns, is designed to achieve the desired field distri-
bution and impedance matching as well as to provide an integral feed structure. 
The reference point of a feed horn is not the center of its aperture but the 
phase center, which is generally slightly behind the aperture plane. When feeds 
are installed, their positions are adjusted while monitoring the electrical outputs so 
that the phase centers are at the correct locations. 
When the radar is in use, the feed aperture is normally not visible because it is 
covered with a small plastic radome to protect the interior from the environment. 
For the photograph in Figure 4.8 the radome was removed. Figure 4.10 shows 
another view of the feed horn assembly of Figure 4.8, this time from the side and 
rear. The horn apertures seen in Figure 4.9 are at the left, hidden from view in this 
picture, but the waveguide can be seen. The bottom pair of waveguides are curved 
in order to make them longer than the top pair by a quarter wavelength, as re-
quired for the inputs to the hybrids (not included in this part of the equipment) 
which produce the sum and difference signals.

Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
The remainder of the antenna feed assembly, not shown, is joined to the end 
of the piece shown in Figure 4.10. It consists essentially of the comparator, the 
device that accepts the inputs from the horns via the four waveguides and converts 
them to the sum signal and the two difference signals (see Section 4.4). 
The four-horn feed is capable of excellent performance but even with the best 
design it does not approach the theoretically optimum feed characteristics. Be-
cause it cannot optimize the sum and difference patterns independently, it must 
compromise. 
Another type of feed, illustrated in Figure 4.11, has five horns. The center one 
is used for transmission and for reception of a reference signal that serves the

same function as the sum signal in four-horn monopulse.2 One difference signal is 
derived from the left and right outer horns and the other from the top and bottom 
horns. 
Other horn configurations include a 12-horn feed, multimode, multilayer 
feeds, and a single-horn multimode feed. The advantages and limitations of the 
various types of amplitude-comparison monopulse feeds will be discussed in 
Chapter 6. 
Phase-comparison monopulse, which has been mentioned but not yet dis-
cussed in detail, uses a cluster of four side-by-side lenses or reflectors rigidly con-
nected to form a single antenna. Each lens or reflector has a single feed at its 
focus. 
4.4 DEVICES FOR FORMING SUMS AND DIFFERENCES   
In a monopulse radar antenna having multiple feeds, the sum and difference sig-
nals, or rather linear combinations of the feed outputs, are formed using certain 
passive microwave devices. Usually these are four-port devices with two input 
ports and two output ports, each output voltage being a different linear combina-
tion of the two input voltages. The same or similar devices are also used for other 
radar functions, such as power division or combining, but here we will concentrate 
on monopulse functions. 
There are several forms of these devices. The nomenclature is not completely 
standardized [7–16] but two major categories (each having a number of subcate-
gories) are usually recognized: hybrid junctions and directional couplers. These 
categories overlap. 
The principal forms of the various devices will be described and illustrated, 
their electrical characteristics will be explained and compared, and their graphic 
symbols will be shown. The way in which these devices are interconnected to 
form the comparator in two-coordinate monopulse will be illustrated. 
The particular versions of the various devices that will be illustrated are those 
used in waveguide systems. Corresponding versions also exist for coaxial-cable 
and stripline systems. 
4.4.1 
Hybrid Junctions 
In a hybrid junction (often called simply “hybrid”) with properly matched termi-
nations, a signal entering either of the two input ports is divided equally in power 
(but not necessarily in the same phase) between two output ports and does not 
appear at all at the other input port. Furthermore, when two signals having the 
                                                           
2  In subsequent discussions the term “sum pattern” or “sum voltage” will be interpreted as including 
the reference pattern or voltage provided by a separate horn. 

58 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
proper relative phase are applied simultaneously to the respective input ports, the 
two outputs are proportional to their sum and their difference. The required rela-
tive phase of the two inputs depends on the specific type of hybrid junction. It is 
usually either 0° or 90°. Likewise the sum and difference outputs may be in phase 
or in quadrature. 
In microwave terminology, the name “hybrid” was first applied to the magic-
T junction described below because it is a combination of the E-plane and H-plane 
T junctions.3 By extension the same name has also come to be applied to other 
types of junctions that perform the same function. 
Magic-T Junction 
Figure 4.12 illustrates one type of hybrid junction known as a magic-T (or magic-
Tee). A signal input at port 1 divides equally between ports 3 and 4 but does not 
appear at port 2 because waveguide 2 cannot support that propagation mode. A 
signal input at port 2 divides equally between output ports 3 and 4 but will not 
appear at port 1. Hence, if the waveguide sections comprising the hybrid junction 
have the proper lengths and if inputs are applied simultaneously to ports 1 and 2, 
their sum will appear at one of the output ports and their difference at the other. 
By reciprocity, input and output ports can be interchanged. 
In “folded” versions of the magic-T, the shape is modified without changing 
the electrical characteristics. For example, arms 3 and 4 may be folded upward or 
downward to be parallel to arm 2 or they may be folded forward to be parallel to 
arm 1. 
                                                           
3  Another explanation is that the word was carried over from hybrid coils that perform an analogous 
function in telephone circuits.

If the two inputs are in-phase, the sum and difference outputs will also be in 
phase. (“In-phase” includes phase opposition, which can be regarded as the same 
phase with sign reversal of the amplitude.) 
In this device, as in the others that will be discussed, the output phase differs 
from that of the input phase because of the delay in propagation through the de-
vice, but this difference is immaterial in our application. Only the relative phase of 
the two inputs and the relative phases of the two outputs are of interest. 
Theoretically, the behavior of this device is not frequency sensitive; therefore, 
it can work over a wide frequency band. 
If v1 and v2 are the input voltages at ports 1 and 2, the output voltages at ports 
3 and 4 are

The equations for v3 and v4 may have to be interchanged, depending on the polar-
ity convention of the inputs, but in either case one output is proportional to the 
sum and the other to the difference. The reason for the factor 1
2  is that the 
total power out must equal the total power in (ignoring a small loss in the device). 
Squaring both sides of (4.1) and (4.2) and adding, we obtain

If (4.1) and (4.2) are solved for v1 and v2, the resulting equations are the same with 
v3 and v4 replaced by v1 and v2 and vice versa. Inputs and outputs can be inter-
changed. 
Hybrid Ring (“Rat-Race”) Junction 
The hybrid ring junction (also called a circular hybrid or a rat-race) is illustrated 
in Figure 4.13. A signal input at port 1 reaches output port 4 by two separate paths 
(clockwise and counterclockwise), which have the same pathlength, 3λg/4, where 
λg is the wavelength in the guide. The two branch signals therefore reinforce at 
port 4. The same input signal reaches port 3 through paths having lengths λg/4 and 
5λg/4, differing by one wavelength. Therefore, reinforcement also occurs at port 3. 
On the other hand, the two path lengths from 1 to 2 differ by one-half wavelength; 
therefore cancellation occurs and there is no output at port 2. 

60 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
Similarly an input at port 2 will produce equal outputs at 3 and 4 but none at 
port 1. If signals of the same phase are entered simultaneously at 1 and 2, they 
reach output 3 in the same phase and they reach 4 in opposite phases. Therefore, 
the outputs at 3 and 4 are the sum and difference of the two inputs. The sum and 
difference outputs are in phase with each other. By reciprocity, input and output 
ports can be interchanged. 
Since the phase relationships depend on the lengths of the waveguide sec-
tions, they are strictly correct at only one frequency. Therefore, this device can be 
used only over a limited frequency band. 
The input-output relations for this device are the same as for the magic-T, as 
given by (4.1) and (4.2). 
4.4.2 
Directional Couplers 
In general, a coupler is a device that taps off some fraction of the power flowing 
through a primary waveguide or transmission line into a secondary waveguide or 
line. The ratio of the primary input power to the power diverted to the secondary 
output is called the coupling factor, or simply the coupling, usually expressed in 
dB. For example, in a 20-dB coupler, 1/100 of the input power appears at the sec-
ondary output. In some radar applications, such as tapping off a portion of the 
transmitter power for measurement or monitoring or as a reference signal for the 
receiver, only weak coupling is needed. Couplers that are of particular interest in 
monopulse, however, have a coupling factor of 2 and are called 3-dB couplers. In 
3-dB couplers the primary and secondary outputs are equal in power. 
A coupler has three or more ports—two for the primary path and one or more 
for secondary paths. The couplers used in monopulse have four ports. 
A directional coupler is one that produces an output at a given secondary port 
when power flows through the primary port in one direction and not in the other. 
A four-port directional coupler produces an output at one or the other of the two 
secondary ports, depending on the direction of power flow in the primary path. 
 
Figure 4.13  Hybrid ring junction (rat-race). 

 
Components Used in Monopulse 
61 
A typical design of a directional coupler is shown in simplified form in Figure 
4.14. It consists of contiguous primary and secondary waveguides with holes or 
slots in the common wall, causing a portion of the power to pass from one 
waveguide to the other. In the device illustrated, there are two holes spaced a 
quarter wavelength apart. An input at port 1 provides an output at port 3 having 
the power of the input minus the power diverted to the secondary (lower) 
waveguide. Each hole launches a pair of waves in the secondary waveguide, one 
traveling to the right and the other to the left. The waves from the two holes rein-
force toward the right, producing an output at 4, but because of the quarter-
wavelength separation (traversed twice by one of the waves) they cancel toward 
the left, producing zero output at 2. An input in the reverse direction at port 3 pro-
duces outputs at 1 and 2 but not at 4. 
A type of coupler of particular importance in monopulse (and also in other 
radar applications) is the 3-dB directional coupler. Referring again to Figure 4.14, 
an input at port 1 splits equally in power, half appearing at port 3 and half at port 
4, with no output at port 2. By symmetry, primary and secondary waveguides are 
interchangeable, as are the input and output ports. The 3-dB directional coupler 
therefore has the same functional characteristics as a hybrid junction, and is usu-
ally regarded as a subset of the latter. 
A four-port directional coupler of any coupling factor has the following in-
herent phase characteristic when all the ports have matched terminations: If an 
input is applied to one port, the two outputs are in phase quadrature with each 
other. Thus, in a 3-dB directional coupler if input voltage v1 is applied at port 1, 
the outputs at ports 3 and 4 are

 respectively (ignoring a 
propagation phase delay common to both, which does not affect their relative 
phase). The reason for the plus-or-minus sign is that the secondary output may 
either lead or lag the primary output by 90°, depending on the coupler construc-
tion [15, 17]. In a side-wall coupler, the common wall in which the holes are 
placed is the narrow wall of the waveguides; in this type the secondary output lags 
 
Figure 4.14   Two-hole directional coupler. 

62 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
by 90°. In a top-wall coupler the common wall is the broad one; here the secon-
dary output leads by 90°. (The phase lead may be regarded as a combination of a 
90° phase lag and a reversal of the E-field vector on passing through the opening 
between the two guides.) In monopulse, either or both types of coupler may be 
used. The choice is governed largely by which type lends itself better to a compact 
design of the microwave assembly. 
If inputs v1 and v2 are applied simultaneously to ports 1 and 2, the outputs of 
ports 3 and 4 are

The same sign (plus or minus) of the quadrature terms applies to both equations. 
If it is desired to obtain the sum and difference of v1 and v2, the phase of one 
of them must be shifted 90° before the input. Suppose v2 is delayed 90° by a phase 
shifter preceding the input. Then the output to port 2 of the coupler is

These outputs are proportional to the sum and difference but they are in phase 
quadrature. Depending on the further combining or processing that is to be done, 
these outputs may be used as they are or one of them may be phase shifted by 90° 
to bring them into phase alignment. 
Because of this phase characteristic, this device is sometimes called a quadra-
ture phase coupler, 90° coupler, quadrature hybrid, or 90° hybrid. 
As in the other devices described in the preceding sections, there is a phase 
delay due to propagation of the wave through the coupler, over and above the 
phases that appear in (4.7) and (4.8), but since this delay does not affect the rela-
tive phase of the two outputs, it can be ignored for our purpose. 
Because the behavior of this device depends on the size and spacing of the 
holes, it is frequency-sensitive. By using more than two holes, or by using slots 
instead of holes, the frequency-sensitivity can be reduced and the device can be 
designed to work over a useful frequency band.

4.4.3 
Comparators 
Any one of the devices described in the preceding sections, which we will lump 
under the general name of hybrids, can be used to obtain the sum and difference of 
two inputs. In a lens or reflector antenna designed for monopulse in both angular 
coordinates there are at least four feed horns.4 A sum and two differences (one for 
each coordinate) must be obtained, and this cannot be done with a single hybrid. 
Several hybrids in tandem and in parallel are required. The whole assemblage of 
hybrids, phase shifters (if needed), and waveguide sections that convert signals 
from the individual feed horns into a sum and two differences is called a compara-
tor. The comparator does not really compare anything, but it provides means for 
indirect comparison of the signal from the individual feed horns. 
Figure 4.15 is a schematic diagram of an illustrative comparator of a mo-
nopulse tracking radar with a four-horn feed. The horns, labeled A to D, are ar-
ranged as shown at top center. (The lower horns produce the upper beams illus-
trated in Figure 1.3 and the upper horns produce the lower beams.) The four input 
lines labeled A to D at the left are the signals obtained from the corresponding 
horns. Four hybrids are used. The details of the interconnections may differ from 
one radar to another but the general arrangement is usually similar to that shown 
in the figure.  
The ports of each hybrid in Figure 4.15 are labeled 1 to 4 corresponding to 
those in Figure 4.14. The hybrids in this example are 3-dB directional couplers 
(quadrature hybrids), which produce outputs v3 = v1 + jv2 and v4 = jv1 + v2 when 
the inputs are v1 and v2. 
In order to obtain sums and differences from hybrids 1 and 2 it is necessary to 
shift one of the inputs by 90°, as mentioned in the preceding section. The phase 
shifts shown in the lines B and C may be obtained by phase shifters or by differen-
tial line lengths. All electrical lengths of waveguides at corresponding points in 
the various paths are equal except where a quarter-wavelength difference is delib-
erately used to obtain the phase shifts shown in lines B and C. 
The outputs of the comparator are shown at the right. They are the sum, the 
traverse difference, and the elevation difference, and a fourth output proportional 
to [(A − B) − (C − D)], sometimes called the “double difference,” the “second dif-
ference,” or the “quadrupolar signal.” By rearranging the terms in the form [(A + 
D) − (B + C)], this signal can be viewed as the difference between the two diago-
nal sums, and it will therefore be referred to as the “diagonal difference.” This 
output is normally unused and is terminated in a matched dummy load. It will be 
discussed further in Section 15.2. 
                                                           
4  It is possible to get two-coordinate monopulse with only three feed horns, but this is not normally a 
practical design. 

64 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
The outputs shown in Figure 4.15 assume lossless components. Small losses 
are present in the physical devices and should be taken into account in the gain 
and loss budget. If the components were perfectly lossless, the total output power 
would equal the total input power, as can be verified by squaring and adding the 
input voltages and squaring and adding the output voltages. The special case of 
four equal inputs (target on the boresight axis) is easy to check. Call the input 
voltage at each port v. Then

pact assembly. Compactness is important for two reasons: to minimize blockage 
when the feed assembly is in front of the reflector, and to make the waveguide 
lengths short in order to minimize phase differences in the different paths due to 
inability to match the path lengths exactly. In addition, light weight is desirable in 
order to minimize mechanical deflection of the feed assembly due to gravity or 
acceleration. 
4.4.4 
Other Methods of Obtaining Monopulse Sum (or Reference) and  
 
Differences 
The comparator described in the preceding section is for a four-horn feed. Some 
monopulse radars have a five-horn feed, and other feed arrangements have been 
designed with as many as twelve horns. With four horns it is possible, by proper 
design and placement of the horns, to optimize either the sum pattern or the dif-
ference patterns but not both, since they are interdependent. With more horns 
there is greater independence and it is possible to achieve more nearly optimum 
sum and difference patterns simultaneously. Optimum patterns are those that rep-
resent the best compromise (for a particular system) among sum-pattern gain and 
beamwidth, monopulse sensitivity, and sidelobe levels. 
A simplified sketch of a five-horn feed was shown in Figure 4.11. The tra-
verse difference is obtained from the left and right horns, A and B, and the eleva-
tion difference is obtained from the top and bottom horns, C and D. The compara-
tor contains only two hybrid junctions, one for each difference signal. The center 
horn R produces the transmitted beam and also provides the reference signal for 
monopulse reception. The reference pattern has the same general shape as the sum 
pattern in a four-horn monopulse and the reference signal is used in the same way 
as the sum signal. Because of this analogy, a receiver or processor channel carry-
ing the reference signal is often identified by the same symbol Σ that is used for a 
sum channel. 
An experimental twelve-horn feed, designed by MIT Lincoln Laboratory, 
gave a closer approximation of ideal sum and difference patterns but required a 
complicated comparator with numerous hybrids (Chapter 21 of [10]). At the other 
extreme, monopulse patterns can be obtained from a multimode feed with a single 
horn by using symmetrical (even) waveguide modes to produce the “sum” signal  
and antisymmetrical (odd) modes to produce the “difference” signals [18, 19]. The 
sum and differences require no addition or subtraction and therefore no hybrids of 
the types described previously. However, since they are carried by different 
modes in the same waveguide, special microwave circuits are needed to extract 
them as separate inputs to their respective receiver channels. 
In the discussion so far, it has been tacitly assumed that only a single linear 
polarization is used. If dual linear polarization is required, microwave devices 
(e.g., certain forms of the magic-T) are used to separate the two polarizations. The 
comparator for forming the sum and differences is the same as for a single polari-

66 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
zation. If only one polarization at a time is needed, a switch is used to select the 
signals of the desired polarization as inputs to the comparator. If both polariza-
tions are to be used simultaneously, two comparators are needed. However, if the 
two linear polarizations are combined at RF to form right or left circular, but not 
both simultaneously, a single comparator suffices. 
In array antennas different methods are used to obtain the sum and the differ-
ences. In some cases the array is divided into four quadrants, in each of which the 
elements are summed to form a single output from each quadrant. The outputs of 
the four quadrants correspond to the outputs of the four feed horns in a lens or 
reflector phase-comparison antenna. Most arrays, however, are not designed in 
this way; there are no available outputs of component beams corresponding to 
those in a space-feed-type antenna. These issues will be discussed further in Chap-
ter 7. 
4.4.5 
Graphical Symbols 
In Figure 4.15 rectangular boxes labeled Hybrid 1, Hybrid 2, and so forth were 
used to identify the hybrid junctions. It is more customary, however, to use 
graphical symbols for various types of hybrids [20, 21]. Some of the more com-
mon symbols used in monopulse circuit diagrams are shown next. They are sub-
ject to minor variations by different users. Most of the symbols bear some resem-
blance to the devices they represent. In some technical literature the symbols are 
used more or less interchangeably, the choice being based on convenience of 
drawing or simply user preference, on the grounds that all of the devices are func-
tionally equivalent. The preferred practice, however, is to use the appropriate 
symbol if the specific type of hybrid junction is known. If it is not desired to spec-
ify a particular type of hybrid junction, a simple box with an appropriate label, 
such as “3-dB hybrid” or simply “hybrid,” may be used. 
In the symbol drawings given below, the input labels v1 and v2 are not part of 
the symbol but have been added to aid in identifying the input ports and relating 
them to those shown in Figures 4.11 to 4.13. The output ports are usually marked 
Σ for sum and Δ for difference, with appropriate subscripts if needed. In these 
drawings, letters Σ and Δ are used only to identify the output ports or channels, not 
the signal voltages, which are represented by the letters s and d. 
Two versions of the symbol for a magic-T hybrid are shown in Figure 4.16. 
The three-dimensional version has a rough resemblance to the device itself as 
shown in Figure 4.11, with inputs entering the two in-line waveguides (shown 
lying in a horizontal plane), the sum emerging from the horizontal output 
waveguide, and the difference emerging from the vertical waveguide. The actual 
physical connections need not conform to this stylized symbol. The connections 
may be interchanged in various ways, and the magic-T structure may be modified 
so that is has a different shape while continuing to behave in the same way.

The three-dimensional version of the magic-T symbol can aid in visualizing 
interconnections of multiple hybrids. Figure 4.17 represents the same comparator 
 
Figure 4.16   Magic-T symbols: (a) flat version; and (b) three-dimensional version. (Dashed lines

network as in Figure 4.15 with the 90° hybrids replaced by magic-T hybrids.5 The 
90° phase shifts in lines B and C are not needed with the magic-T. 
Figure 4.18 is a symbol for a hybrid ring junction. The symbol may be rotated 
to any orientation and ports may be interchanged in various ways. However, input 
and output ports must alternate, and the Σ port must always be the one midway 
between the two input ports. 
Figure 4.19 shows the usual symbol for a 3-dB directional coupler (quadra-
ture hybrid), sometimes drawn with arrowheads at both ends of the two diagonals. 
When the two input voltages are in quadrature phase, the outputs will be sum and 
difference, also in quadrature phase. The positive or negative sign depends on the 
particular design, as explained previously. 
4.5 RECEIVERS 
In the receivers of the sum and difference channels, the radio frequency (RF) volt-
ages from the microwave combining network are converted to intermediate fre-

quency (IF) by mixing with the output of a local oscillator, then amplified and 
filtered at IF. The filter is matched to the radar pulse. This means that ideally the 
filter transfer function is the complex conjugate of the pulse voltage spectrum. In 
practice this characteristic is approximated, so that the filter bandwidth is roughly 
equal to the reciprocal of the duration of the transmitted pulse (if simple pulses are 
used) or of the compressed pulse (if coded pulses are used). 
Because the sum and differences have been formed by stable passive devices 
preceding the receivers, the boresight direction is more stable than if the sum and 
differences were formed after the receivers. A null difference signal at the input to 
a receiver produces a null output even if the receiver gain or phase drifts. How-
ever, a null is never perfect; because of imperfections in the RF devices the differ-
ence has a residual voltage in quadrature phase with the sum. This residual volt-
age, when combined with phase imbalance between sum and difference receivers, 
causes an angle error. Furthermore, when off-axis angle measurements are made, 
amplitude imbalance in the receiver channels produces an angle error that in-
creases with angle off axis. Hence, although the RF sum-and-difference approach 
is less susceptible to receiver-drift errors than if sum and difference were formed 
after the receivers, it is not totally immune. For precise angle tracking or mea-
surement, it is important that the three receiver channels track one another in gain 
and phase. By tracking, we mean that once the gains and phases have been equal-
ized, they must remain equal (within tolerable limits) with the passage of time 
until the next calibration, and over an adequate range of input levels, tempera-
tures, and frequency within the tuning band of the radar. 
Some monopulse radars use pilot pulses, injected at the front end of the re-
ceivers, to maintain the amplitude and phase matching. Disparities among the 
three receivers are automatically detected and corrected by adjustable attenuators 
and phase shifters or in the computation of the monopulse output if done by com-
puter. 
In some monopulse radars the receivers must maintain their performance over 
a very wide dynamic range of signal levels. This requirement and means for meet-
ing it are discussed in Chapter 8.

Amplitude-Comparison and Phase-
Comparison Classification
In the early days of monopulse radar the terms amplitude comparison and phase 
comparison provided a clear, useful distinction between two basic classes of mo-
nopulse, differing unmistakably in principle of operation and in the physical con-
struction of the antenna. However, with the increased variety and sophistication of 
modern radars, it is not always obvious whether a particular radar should be clas-
sified as amplitude comparison or phase comparison, or even if those terms retain 
significance in describing the radar. With minor exceptions,1 monopulse radars 
designed since 1960 have used microwave comparators to form sum and differ-
ence patterns s and d, and subsequent circuits form a normalized difference signal 
d/s, regardless of the antenna configuration and the relative phase of the d and s 
voltages produced by the antenna. The important characteristics of the antennas 
are the sum-channel gain and beamwidth, the difference-channel slope at the axis, 
and the sidelobe structure of the two patterns. 
This chapter gives the IEEE definitions of amplitude- and phase-comparison 
monopulse, and examples of reflector antennas in which the distinction is obvious. 
It is shown that the two classes are essentially equivalent in theory but differ in 
design and in practical performance. Both types are compared with the optimum 
monopulse antenna characteristics derived in 1952 by Kirkpatrick [1, 2], with re-
spect to sum-channel gain, difference slope, and sidelobe levels. This comparison 
shows why the amplitude-comparison monopulse approach has predominated in 
tracking radar. The discussion here, concentrated on reflector or lens antennas, 
will be extended to array antennas in Chapter 7.

made by direct comparison of signal amplitudes in adjacent beams.

5.1 DEFINITIONS AND EXAMPLES  
5.1.1 
Definitions 
The Authoritative Dictionary of IEEE Standards Terms [3] gives the following 
definitions: 
Amplitude-comparison monopulse. 
A form of monopulse in which the angular deviation of the target from the antenna 
axis is measured as the amplitude ratio of the target as received by two antenna pat-
terns. The patterns may be a pair of beams displaced on opposite sides of the an-
tenna axis or a difference-channel beam having odd symmetry about the axis and a 
sum beam having even symmetry. In the latter case the ratio may have positive and 
negative values (0° or 180° phase shift, or in some cases +90° and −90°). Distin-
guished from phase-comparison monopulse, in which the relative phase of the two 
patterns carries the information on target displacement. 
Phase-comparison monopulse. 
A form of monopulse employing receiving beams with different phase centers, as 
obtained, for example, from side-by-side antennas or separate portions of an array. 
Note: The information on target displacement from the antenna axis appears as a 
relative phase between the signals received at the two phase centers. 
Note that amplitude-comparison monopulse is defined as using either a pair 
of beams squinted to each side of the axis or a pair with even and odd symmetry 
about the axis, while phase-comparison monopulse is defined in terms of separate 
aperture regions with different phase centers. The term “phase center” used in 
differentiating between the two classes of monopulse requires further explanation, 
which will be given in Section 5.2. We can then examine the distinction between 
the two classes more comprehensively. 
5.1.2 
Interpretation 
The names amplitude comparison and phase comparison, although appropriate in 
the early days of monopulse, are no longer truly descriptive, and are not to be in-
terpreted literally. Modern monopulse radars actually do not measure the ampli-
tudes and phases of the radar returns in individual beams (that is, the outputs of 
the individual feed horns) and then compare them. First of all, as already ex-
plained, the individual beam outputs may not be readily accessible for measure-
ment. In fact, some types of antennas, such as reflectors with single, multimode 
feed horns, and many arrays, do not produce voltages associated with the individ-
ual component beams, but form “sum” and “difference” voltages directly. 
Even when the component beam outputs are available, they would have to be 
connected to individual receivers for frequency conversion, filtering, and amplifi-
cation before amplitude or phase measurements could be made. Near the boresight 
axis (usually the region of primary interest) the amplitudes and phases would be 

 
Amplitude-Comparison and Phase-Comparison Classification 
73 
nearly equal and angle information would reside in differences that are small 
compared to the individual measurements. Mismatches or drifts in the gains or 
phase shifts of the individual receiver channels would cause serious errors in the 
boresight and in the angle estimation in general, as was learned in early mo-
nopulse development. 
Therefore, the usual practice in both amplitude- and phase-comparison mo-
nopulse is to do the comparison in an indirect manner, which consists of forming 
differences (one for each angular coordinate) at RF by means of stable passive 
devices known as comparators (Section 4.4), before any active devices have acted 
on the signals. The comparator is generally placed as close as possible to the feed 
horns in a single, compact assembly, in order to minimize variations or distortions 
due to long transmission lines. Thus the use of the difference voltages instead of 
the individual beam voltages produces a null that remains much more stable in 
direction (the boresight direction) than if the differencing were done after the re-
ceivers, because a null input to a receiver produces a null output even if the re-
ceiver drifts. 
In addition to a difference voltage for each of the two angular coordinates, the 
comparator produces a sum voltage (obtained by summing the outputs of the two 
component beams, when these are formed in the antenna). The function of the 
sum voltage (besides detection and range measurement) is to normalize the differ-
ence voltage. Normalization means forming the ratio (Chapter 3) of the difference 
to the sum in order that the monopulse output be a function only of target angle, 
not of the strength of the echo. 
After the sum and difference voltages are amplified by the receivers, they be-
come the inputs to the monopulse processor (Chapter 8), which produces the nor-
malized monopulse output (often called the error signal) that indicates target angle 
from the boresight axis. Although the formation of sum and difference voltages 
before the receivers greatly reduces boresight shift, mismatch or drifts in the re-
ceiver will still cause errors on off-axis angle measurements. Therefore, to main-
tain constant tracking-loop gain or to make accurate off-axis measurements, care 
must be taken in maintaining a good match in both gain and phase of receivers. 
Confusion in describing the type of monopulse can be avoided by adhering to 
the convention that the names amplitude comparison and phase comparison per-
tain only to the nature of the antenna patterns, regardless of whether the process-
ing that follows involves amplitude or phase measurements or both. Even with 
this convention, confusion in terminology can arise because the use of certain RF 
devices makes it possible to transform one class into what appears to be the 
equivalent of the other [4]. As pointed out in Section 2.3, the patterns of an an-
tenna are not unique; they depend on the point in the system at which they are 
measured. However, the two classes can still be defined unambiguously. In array 
antennas with constrained feeds the distinction is not important because any given 
set of sum and difference patterns (within the physical limitations of the antenna) 
can be produced by either class of monopulse, whereas in space-fed antennas 

74 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
there is a significant difference between sum patterns obtainable from the two 
classes. 
The analysis and descriptions that follow apply to single-coordinate mo-
nopulse or to either angular coordinate in two-coordinate monopulse. The off-axis 
angle coordinate is denoted by θ, which is replaced by A for azimuth or E for ele-
vation. The aperture coordinate x and width w, applying to azimuth, are replaced 
by y and height h for elevation. 
5.1.3 
Optimum Monopulse 
In an early analysis of monopulse antenna design and performance, Kirkpatrick 
[1] developed the theory of the optimum monopulse antenna, defined as one that 
would produce the highest possible accuracy in an environment where thermal 
noise was the only factor interfering with target measurement. This theory is 
summarized here to provide a background against which to describe amplitude- 
and phase-comparison monopulse antennas. 
Kirkpatrick described first a number of methods by which an even (sum) and 
an odd (difference) pattern could be obtained and processed for angular measure-
ment of targets. He noted that there was a well established result [5, p. 177] that 
the maximum gain G0 obtainable for a given aperture area results from applying a 
uniform illumination function g0 over that area:

liptical aperture, the product wh of the two axes replaces D2 in (5.2). Kirkpatrick 
noted the absence of a criterion in the literature to evaluate odd patterns. He chose 
to use the voltage slope of the odd far field, on the beam axis, as the figure of 
merit of the direction-finding properties of the antenna. The normalized azimuth 
difference illumination function then takes the form

where the constant in gd0(x) results in unity total illumination power on the aper-
ture. In the elevation plane, h and y replace w and x in (5.3). It should be noted 
that this relationship for the difference illumination does not specify the relative 
phase of g0 and gd0, which can be in-phase or in quadrature. 
The pattern voltage corresponding to uniform illumination g0 can be calcu-
lated using (2.1), rewritten here for the sum azimuth pattern as

texts as

(5.5) 
The optimum difference pattern d(u) is found by replacing g0(x) with gd0(x) in 
(5.4). The optimum sum and difference illumination functions for a rectangular 
aperture are shown in Figure 5.1(a), plotted with respect to an aperture coordinate 
normalized to the width (or height) of the aperture. The corresponding antenna 
patterns are shown in Figure 5.1(b), plotted as a function of a normalized angle 
θ′ = θ/θbw normalized to sum beamwidth θbw. The difference pattern resulting 
from (5.4) is in phase with the sum pattern, assuming that a hybrid comparator 
without phase shift (e.g., a magic-T) is used to form the s and d beams from the 
in-phase individual beams formed from the aperture. 
Kirkpatrick’s choice of difference slope as the performance measure for di-
rection finding was used by Hannan [6], who normalized the slope to the optimum 
sum voltage gain, defining a relative difference slope as

Here the difference (odd) pattern is denoted by d(u). The word relative refers to 
the normalization to ideal sum voltage gain. Skolnik [7], Barton [8], and others 
adopted K as an important measure of monopulse antenna performance.2  
                                                           
2  Kirkpatrick’s slope is defined using a derivative with respect to a normalized angle α = 2π(w/λ)θ = 
2πu, and is not normalized to sum-channel voltage gain. Taking into account the angle u and gain 
normalization, his expressions agree with (5.6). 

76 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
The relative slope K, expressed in normalized volts per (w/λ) × radian, is an 
absolute measure of the monopulse antenna sensitivity to deviations of the target 
from the axis, and its evaluation requires knowledge of the aperture dimensions, 
the wavelength, and the illumination functions or antenna patterns. For the opti-
mum difference illumination function gd0(x) in the horizontal plane, the relative 
difference slope is given by

in expressions for tracking error, as will be found in Chapter 10. 
The sidelobe levels of the optimum monopulse antenna, shown in decibel 
form over an extended angular region in Figure 5.2, have maximum values of 
−13.3 dB for the sum channel and −10.7 dB for the difference channel. The 
sidelobe levels remain above −30 dB even beyond ±10 beamwidths from the axis, 
and are excessive for a practical radar operating in a realistic environment contain-
ing clutter or jamming.

Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
Although unsuitable for practical use, and unfeasible with space-fed antennas, 
the characteristics of the optimum monopulse antenna are useful as a reference in 
evaluating practical antenna designs, which may be compared to the optimum as a 
measure of performance. Kirkpatrick presented plots of the patterns and tables of 
relative slopes K for a number of difference illumination functions. In practice, the 
need to reduce sidelobes and the physical limitations of horn illumination func-
tions for reflector and lens antennas dictate departures from the optimum illumina-
tion functions shown in Figure 5.1(a). This will be shown in the next sections for 
examples of amplitude- and phase-comparison monopulse. 
5.1.4 
Amplitude-Comparison Monopulse Antenna Example 
With Kirkpatrick’s theory as a background, we can now evaluate an example of 
the conventional amplitude-comparison monopulse radar using a horn-fed reflec-
tor. Many radars such as the AN/FPS-16, illustrated in Figures 4.1 and 4.2, have 
antenna patterns similar to those produced by a rectangular aperture with illumina-
tion functions for the azimuth sum and difference channels given by

The constants in these equations result in unity illumination power on the aper-
ture, and the factor −j in gd places the difference voltage pattern d in-phase with s, 
with positive on-axis slope. These functions and the resulting antenna patterns are 
shown in Figure 5.3. The illumination functions represent those of an optimum 
rectangular monopulse antenna to which a cosine taper has been applied in both 
sum and difference channels for sidelobe reduction. The cosine taper is also as-
sumed to be applied to the orthogonal angle coordinate. As with the optimum mo-
nopulse, the difference pattern is the negative of the first derivative of the sum 
pattern, and is in-phase with the sum pattern. 
The application of cosine taper reduces the antenna performance relative to 
that of the optimum antenna (Table 5.1).

The sum beamwidth of a circular reflector or lens, as found in radars such as 
the AN/FPS-16, is, of course, greater than for a rectangular antenna with the same 
width, but the slope values apply to both rectangular and circular apertures. 
The increase in km from the optimum-antenna value of 1.606 results from the 
normalization factors in (5.9), where the increased beamwidth and decreased effi-
ciency cause the ratio 
bw

η  to increase more rapidly than the decrease in K. 
The larger value of km does not indicate better monopulse performance than that of 
the optimum antenna, because when measurement error is calculated from km the 
larger beamwidth and smaller efficiency appear in the error equation as factors 
that increase the error (see Chapter 10). 
The cosine taper reduces the first sidelobes from −13.3 dB to −23.1 dB for the 
sum channel and from −10.7 dB to −18.9 dB for the difference channel. Sidelobe 
levels on a decibel scale are shown in Figure 5.4. Beyond four beamwidths from

terns are typical of those found in many deployed radars that use reflector or lens 
antennas, and the tapered illumination functions shown in Figure 5.3 can be ap-
proximated using feed horns of the types described in Chapter 4.

Phase-Comparison Monopulse Antenna Example 
A phase-comparison reflector antenna consists of a cluster of four reflectors side 
by side in a square or cloverleaf arrangement, joined together at their edges to 
form a rigid assembly. Each reflector has a single feed horn. Figure 5.5 shows an 
artist’s sketch of an early experimental phase-comparison antenna built by the 
General Electric Company. The sum and difference illumination functions and 
beam patterns of such a system are similar to those shown in Figure 5.6. 
A characteristic of phase monopulse antennas that use reflectors or lenses is 
the null in the center of the sum illumination function, caused by the use of sepa-
rate portions of the aperture to create widely spaced phase centers. The result is

shown. The extent of these high sidelobes is shown in Figure 5.7. The sum-
channel sidelobes are above −40 dB within ±10 beamwidths. The difference-
channel sidelobes are relatively small, being comparable to those of the cosine-
tapered amplitude-comparison monopulse antenna (Figure 5.4). Characteristics of 
the modeled phase-comparison monopulse antenna are compared to the optimum 
antenna in Table 5.2. 
In practice, although the experimental system shown in Figure 5.5 was appar-
ently built and tested, there is no indication of application of such an antenna in a 
production radar. A phase-comparison monopulse radar was included in a ballistic 
missile guidance system designed by General Electric, but did not reach produc-
tion status. An experimental combination phase-amplitude-comparison radar, the 
AN/APG-25(XN-2), was discussed in a paper by General Electric authors [9]. It 
apparently satisfied the development requirements of the Navy contract, although 
production did not follow. No other references to deployed phase-comparison

5.2 PHASE FRONTS, PHASE CENTERS, AND RELATED CONCEPTS  
Since the term phase center enters into the definitions of amplitude- and phase-
comparison monopulse, and also will be referred to elsewhere, it will be defined 
here. First, it is necessary to understand the meaning of a phase front. Although 
both of these terms seem easy to grasp intuitively, there are subtleties that some-
times lead to misunderstanding. Phase front and phase center are most easily ex-
plained initially in terms of transmission. The interpretation for reception and for 
radar targets will then be given. 
5.2.1 
Transmitting Antennas 
A phase front of a radiating antenna is any surface along which the phase of the 
radiated field is constant. In physical terms, imagine an instrument capable of 
measuring the phase of the radiation field at any point, without disturbing the 
field. The phase reference could be provided, in concept, by a long flexible cable 
of fixed length connected between the transmitter and the instrument. The abso-

lute phase of this reference is immaterial, as long as it is unaffected by the flexure 
or motion of the cable as the instrument is moved around.  
If the instrument is moved along any path on a phase front, it will register 
constant phase. If amplitude is measured at the same time, it will, in general, be 
found to vary along the phase front. There may be points or curves on the phase 
front on which the amplitude is zero. When a path passes through such a point or 
curve, there is an amplitude null, and usually (but not necessarily, as a later exam-
ple will show) a 180° phase reversal, causing a discontinuity in the phase front.  
The direction of the normal to a phase front at a given point is sometimes re-
ferred to as the direction of propagation of the waves. 
A given antenna may produce two or more simultaneous radiation patterns, 
such as monopulse sum and difference patterns. Each pattern has its own set of 
phase fronts. For a particular pattern, one and only one phase front can be drawn 
through any specified point in the radiation field. 
The phase center is the center of curvature of a phase front. If the radiating 
source were an isotropic point radiator, the phase fronts would be spherical and 
the phase center would be at the radiator. Such a radiator is possible only for sca-
lar (e.g., acoustic) fields, not for the vector fields of electromagnetics, although it 
is sometime useful for reference. 
The existence of a fixed phase center is not limited, however, to an idealized 
point radiator. A physical radiating aperture may or may not have a fixed phase 
center (in the far field), depending on the aperture illumination function. A fixed 
phase center implies that the phase fronts are spherical or that they are composed 
of spherical segments having a common center, separated by jumps of one-half 
wavelength where the pattern passes through nulls and the phase jumps 180°. 
Such a case is illustrated in Figure 5.8. The rays (normals to the phase front) all 
intersect at a common point, the phase center. 
 
Figure 5.8   Illustration of fixed phase center. 

84 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
In many cases the phase fronts are not spherical, but one can define a local 
phase center as the center of curvature at any point on a phase front. This means 
that any small portion of the phase front is approximated by a spherical phase 
front originating at the local phase center. The location of the local phase center 
will vary with the direction of the point of measurement from the source (and also 
with range if not in the far field), and this variation generally will have a compo-
nent perpendicular as well as parallel to the antenna aperture plane. Figure 5.9 
illustrates this situation. The phase front is not quite spherical; therefore the nor-
mals do not intersect at a common point. However, if only a small area of the 
phase font is considered, the points of intersection of rays from that area will lie 
within a small region that shrinks to a point. The point of intersection of the infini-
tesimal bundle of rays is the local phase center. It can also be described as the 
center of the osculating sphere, defined as the sphere that is tangent to the phase 
front and has the same curvature at the point under consideration. 
Thus, over any small area through which the wave radiated by the antenna 
passes, the electromagnetic field is nearly the same as if it came from a point 
source at the local phase center. As the angle of observation changes, the ampli-
tude, phase, and position of the apparent source may change also. 
In many cases there is not even a local phase center, as defined above, be-
cause the phase front has different curvatures in different planes. Even so, it is 
sometimes useful to apply the concept of a phase center in a specified plane, de-
fined as the center of curvature in that plane.

5.2.2 
Receiving Antennas 
To apply the concept of phase fronts and phase centers to a receiving antenna, 
imagine an external radiating source moving along a surface that maintains con-
stant phase of the signal in a receiver connected to the antenna. If that surface is a 
sphere or consists of spherical segments having a common center, then the geo-
metric center is the phase center. If the surface is not a sphere, the center of curva-
ture at any point, in a particular plane, is the local phase center in that plane. 
Two patterns of the same antenna (such as sum and difference) may differ in 
phase (by 90°, for example) and still have the same phase center. In such a case, 
phase fronts of the two patterns drawn through the same point will coincide geo-
metrically but will have different phases. Stated another way, phase fronts of the 
two patterns, for the same specified phase, will be displaced from each other but 
will have a common phase center. The phase difference is accounted for by a dif-
ference in phase of the source (or receiving beamformer), not by a displacement of 
the phase center location. 
5.2.3 
Targets 
The concept of a phase center can be applied also to a radar target. When a target 
reradiates power incident on it from a radar, it produces a radiation pattern in the 
same manner as a transmitting antenna, characterized by phase fronts and a phase 
center. In the case of a target, we are interested in that part of the phase front that 
is intercepted by the receiving antenna. As the target changes its orientation rela-
tive to the line of sight from the radar, its phase front changes and the antenna 
intercepts different portions of it. Except for certain special shapes (of which the 
sphere is a familiar example), the location of the target phase center as seen by the 
radar varies as a function of target aspect angle. 
The phase of the apparent source located at the phase center of a target de-
pends not only on the range of the target but also on its shape and composition. 
Assuming perfect reflectivity and monostatic operation, the phase center of a 
sphere having a radius much larger than a wavelength is very close to the leading 
edge, with essentially zero phase shift contributed by the target. For a flat plate at 
normal incidence, it is at the center, with a 90° phase advance contributed by the 
target. For the tip of a cone at nose-on incidence, long enough to remove the base 
from the range resolution cell containing the tip, the phase center is at the tip, with 
a 90° phase lag contributed by the tip. 
For some purposes such as analysis of angular glint, it is sufficient to know 
the angular location (not the range) of the phase center. This is simply the direc-
tion normal to the phase front.

5.2.4 
An Example: Phase Fronts of a Two-Element Source  
The following simple example will illustrate some of the properties of phase 
fronts and phase centers. It is worded in terms of a transmitting antenna consisting 
of two discrete radiating elements but would apply equally well to a receiving 
antenna of the same configuration, or to the reradiated wave from a target having 
two scattering points, illuminated from a fixed direction relative to the target axis. 
The left half of Figure 5.10 (adapted from [10] but computed and plotted in-
dependently) shows electromagnetic phase fronts emanating from a pair of 
sources having equal amplitudes, 180° relative phase, and a separation of three 
wavelengths. The successive phase fronts differ in phase by 2π radians. Each 
source is assumed to be a dipole having its polarization vector perpendicular to the 
plane of the figure and an isotropic radiation pattern in the plane of the figure. The 
resultant phase fronts were plotted by theory. The outmost phase front (discussed 
in Section 5.2.5) was computed for infinite distance but plotted at a short distance 
in order to be visible in the figure.

Physical verification is provided by the phase fronts in the right half of Figure 
5.10 (taken from [10]) produced by water waves photographed in a ripple tank3 
with corresponding sources. The scales of the electromagnetic and water-wave 
fronts have been normalized to their respective wavelengths. Under the assumed 
conditions the equations for propagation of the electromagnetic waves and water 
waves are essentially the same.

where C is a constant that includes the amplitude of the sources, λ is the wave-
length, and R1 and R2 are the distances from the respective sources to the point 
where the field is being measured. The resultant field is the sum of E1 and E2. 
These equations assume that R1 and R2 are much greater than λ; otherwise the 
equations include higher-order terms. 
Along the horizontal centerline there is complete cancellation because 
R1 = R2; the field strengths contributed by the individual sources are equal in am-
plitude and opposite in phase. The phase fronts have a discontinuity of one-half 
wavelength in crossing that line. At any point where the pathlength difference 
R1 − R2 is a nonzero multiple of a wavelength, the two components are out of 
phase but not exactly equal in amplitude because R1 ≠ R2. Therefore the resultant 
amplitude has a minimum but not a complete null. The phase front at such a point 
has a “kink”―that is, an abrupt change in direction―but not a discontinuity. The 
smooth portions of the curves between the kinks are not exactly circular. 
It has been pointed out [10] that a tracking radar tends to align its axis along 
the normal to the phase front. Thus, if the two sources in Figure 5.10 were radar 
targets and if a tracking radar were located at one of the kinks, the tracking radar 
would point in a direction outside the angular span of the pair of targets, on the 
side of the stronger (i.e., the closer) target. This result is also found by other 
methods of analysis and has been confirmed by experiment. 
5.2.5 
Simplification at Large Distances 
In the usual radar situation we are interested in distances much greater than those 
shown in Figure 5.10. As the distance increases, the kinks become more abrupt,

and in the limit they become discontinuities, as shown in the outermost phase 
front of the figure. The resultant field can then be expressed in a simple analytic 
form. The ratio of the distances from the two sources to a field point approaches 
unity and in the denominators of (5.12) and (5.13) we can set

This equation shows that the condition for constant phase is that R be con-
stant, except at the discontinuities that occur at those values of θ where the ampli-
tude function sin(3π sin θ) passes through zero and changes sign. Figure 5.12 is a 
plot of this function. The discontinuities occur at θ = 0, ±19.5°, ±41.8°, and at the 
supplementary (with respect to 180°) values of θ. At θ = ±90° in the far field there 
is a null but not a change in sign; hence, there is a “hole” in the phase front but not 
a discontinuity. The far-field phase front is composed of circular pieces. The 
phase center is at the midpoint between the two sources. The field is equivalent to 
that of a single source at the phase center, having 90° or −90° phase relative to the 
upper actual source when the sin(3π sin θ) factor in (5.17) is positive or negative 
respectively. At a discontinuity there is no jump in the location of the phase center 
but a 180° jump in the phase of the equivalent source located at the phase center. 
In the general far-field case (not limited to the example used above) the posi-
tion, amplitude, and phase of the equivalent source at the phase center depend on 
direction only, not on the distance of the observation point from the antenna. All 
phase fronts intersecting a particular ray (which is a straight line in the far field) 
have a common center of curvature at the points of intersection.

Phase Centers of Array Antennas 
Consider an electronically steered planar array, symmetrical in each coordinate, 
with constant phase illumination (for a broadside4 beam) or uniformly tapered 
phase illumination (for an off-broadside beam). It will be shown that the sum and 
difference patterns of such an array have a common phase center at the geometric 
center of the aperture. However, the component beams (usually fictitious) into 
which the sum and difference beams can be decomposed may have different phase 
centers. 
The proof that follows presupposes some knowledge of electronically steered 
arrays and familiarity with the sine-space coordinate system described in Section 
2.8. Further information on electronically steered arrays for monopulse will be 
found in Chapter 7. 
Let the plane of the array be the x-y coordinate plane, as in Section 2.8, with 
the x-axis horizontal and the origin at the center. Consider even (symmetrical) 
amplitude illumination in either coordinate, say x, as required for the sum pattern:

The subscript in (5.18) identifies ae as an even function and distinguishes it from 
an odd amplitude function that will be considered later. No subscript is needed to 
indicate whether φ is even or odd, since only odd phase functions will be consid-
ered. However, a distinction is made between the steering phase φst in (5.19) and 
the phase φar of the arriving wave.

The integral is real, and the phase is determined by the exponential factor outside 
the integral. The consideration for constant phase is constant R, and since R is 
measured from the center of the array, the phase center is at the phase center of 
the array and the phase fronts consist of spherical segments interrupted by half-
wavelength jumps at nulls of the integral (i.e., nulls of the pattern). The same re-
sult is obtained in the y-direction. 
Now consider an odd (antisymmetric) illumination function, as required for a 
difference pattern:

The reversal at the center is regarded as a sign reversal of the amplitude rather 
than as a 180° phase jump. The steering phase function is odd as before. If ao is 
substituted for ae in (5.28), only the sine term contributes to the integral. The dif-

(5.31) 
The integral is real. The j factor outside the integral indicates 90° phase, but this is 
constant. The only variation of phase is due to R. Constant R produces constant 
phase. Just as in the case of even illumination, the phase center for odd illumina-
tion is at the center of the array and the phase fronts are portions of spheres. 
The difference illumination for each coordinate is even in one coordinate and 
odd in the other. The phase center is still at the center of the array and the phase 
fronts are portions of spheres, as in the previous cases. 
The integrals in (5.29) and (5.31) can be replaced by summations of the con-
tributions of elements of the array, provided these contributions include the ele-
ment pattern. The results, however, remain the same as far as the phases of s and d 
are concerned. The same analysis can be applied to the orthogonal coordinate by 
replacing x by y and α by β. 
In deriving (5.29) and (5.31) it has been assumed that the beamforming net-
works that combine the element outputs to form s and d introduce no phase shift 
(though in practice they may). On this assumption, s and d are seen to be in-phase. 
The effect of the phase relationship between s and d on the classification of mo-
nopulse as amplitude comparison or phase comparison will be discussed in Sec-
tion 5.3. 
Another assumption that has been made is that the illumination phase is con-
stant or uniformly tapered. This is not generally exactly true, because an array is 
composed of individual elements (e.g., dipoles, slots, horns, or open-ended 
waveguides), which produce small “ripples” in the phase front. As long as the 
elements are all alike, the sum and difference patterns still have a common phase 
center, but that phase center may shift slightly from the geometric center of the 
aperture as a function of steering angle. The shift may have components both par-
allel and normal to the array plane. Even in the broadside direction the phase cen-
ter need not be exactly in the front surface of the array.

The analysis just presented for array antennas actually applies more generally to 
any planar aperture with even or odd amplitude illumination and constant or uni-
formly tapered phase. Therefore, it might appear to apply to the sum and differ-
ence patterns of a reflector antenna if the plane of the rim is regarded as the aper-
ture plane. Since all rays going from the focus to the plane by way of the reflector 
surface have the same length, it follows that by geometric optics a point source or 
infinitesimal dipole source at the focus will produce a plane wave front across the 
aperture plane. However, a physical feed is a distributed source, and geometric 
optics is only an approximation. It has been shown by more refined analysis [11] 
that the phase center of the sum pattern in the axial direction is on the axis of 
symmetry but generally does not lie in the aperture plane; it may be slightly be-
hind the plane or in front of it. The displacement from the aperture plane depends 
on the ratio of the focal length to diameter of the paraboloid and on the feed char-
acteristics. In general, because of polarization, the phase center has different loca-
tions in the two principal planes. Furthermore, the phase center is not fixed but 
varies with the direction of arrival. 
An analysis of the phase center for odd illumination does not appear to have 
been reported in the literature. However, it has been established experimentally 
that in properly adjusted amplitude-comparison monopulse the sum and difference 
voltages maintain a very nearly constant relative phase (namely 0°) over the half-
power beamwidth of the sum pattern. For larger angular deviations from the axis 
the relative phase departs from that value [12]. From these observations one can 
deduce that the sum and difference patterns of a reflector antenna, within the use-
ful width of the sum beam, have very nearly the same phase center, generally not 
exactly in the aperture plane and not exactly on the axis except for the axial direc-
tion of arrival.

COMPARISON MONOPULSE 
5.3.1 
Reflector Antenna Examples 
We now apply the discussion of antenna phase centers to the reflector-type mo-
nopulse antennas discussed in Sections 5.1.4 and 5.1.5. The amplitude-comparison 
example was chosen to represent the four-horn type of feed described for the 
AN/FPS-16 in Chapter 4. The receiving beams mentioned in the definition of am-
plitude-comparison monopulse are defined in Section 5.1.4 as sum and difference 
beams. Hence their phase centers are coincident. We can, however, derive from 
the sum voltage s and the difference voltage d, using (2.3) and (2.4), the individual

component beam patterns v1 and v2 that would produce the sum and difference 
patterns. Repeating those equations here with angle θ′ in beamwidths, we have:

s and d are real, v1 and v2 have the same phases but their amplitude ratio varies 
with target angle, being unity on the monopulse axis. These patterns are shown in 
Figure 5.13. The beams have been normalized to the peak gain of the sum beam, 
and plotted in angle normalized to the sum beamwidth θbw. The half-power width 
of the individual beams is 0.859 θbw and the peak amplitudes are 0.941. The first 
sidelobes are asymmetrical, the larger being −10 dB and the smaller −18.8 dB 
below the peak gain. Such patterns are consistent with those of a reflector illumi-
nated by a closely spaced pair of horns near the focal point. The relationship to the 
actual AN/FPS-16 antenna will be discussed in Chapter 6. 
The phasors v1 and v2 and the corresponding s and d are drawn in Figure 5.14 
for a target to the right of the axis, at an arbitrary phase angle to emphasize that 
only their relative phase (0°), not their absolute phase, is relevant. The phases of 
v1 and v2 will remain equal at all target angles even though that phase may vary 
with target angle. This means that the two patterns must have a common phase 
center or a common local phase center at all angles. The reversal of the difference 
voltage on passing through its null can be treated mathematically as a 180° jump.

Amplitude-Comparison and Phase-Comparison Classification 
95 
The same phase relationship also applies to five-horn amplitude comparison, 
since the reference pattern has the same phase center as the squinted patterns. That 
is, the reference and difference voltages are in quadrature. More generally, the 90° 
phase relationship applies to any antenna with a single main reflector (including a 
Cassegrain antenna) with any number of feed horns clustered about the focus. 
This category is broad enough to include, for example, a twelve-horn feed or a 
single-horn multimode feed. 
Turning now to the phase-comparison example, v1 and v2 have the same am-
plitude at all target angles but their phase difference varies with target angle, being 
zero on the monopulse axis. Equations (5.32) and (5.33) are now modified to re-
place the voltage d with jd, placing it in quadrature with s. The two amplitude 
patterns, shown in Figure 5.15(a), are overlaid on each other, but the phases 
shown in Figure 5.15(b) are exactly opposite each other, varying linearly with the 
sine of off-axis angle. As a result, in Figure 5.16, phasors v1 and v2 have equal 
amplitudes but different phases, diverging by equal amounts, in opposite direc-
tions from the sum phasor s. Since the relative phase of the beams whose outputs 
are v1 and v2 varies with angle, they must have different phase centers. 
In phase-comparison monopulse the phase of s is always the average of 
phases of v1 and v2. In the far field, therefore, the phase center of s is half way 
between the phase centers of v1 and v2. The phase center of d is at that same mid-
point, since d differs from s in phase by 90°. The phase fronts of the d pattern are 
displaced by one-quarter wavelength from those of the s pattern but they have the 
same center of curvature. Since d is in quadrature with s as a result of (5.31) with 
the odd illumination function, the monopulse comparator must maintain the input 
phase relationships at its outputs. 
Thus it would appear that one could distinguish between the two classes of 
monopulse simply by computing or measuring the relative phase of the difference 
and sum at the comparator output: 0° for amplitude comparison and 90° for phase 
comparison.

Amplitude-Comparison and Phase-Comparison Classification 
97 
However, such a distinction requires more specific wording to avoid ambigu-
ity. The preceding explanation, including the phase diagrams, is based on (2.1), 
(2.2), (5.32), and (5.33). Those equations assume that the sum and difference are 
produced by a device such as a magic-T or circular hybrid (Section 4.4.1), which 
has in-phase outputs (s and d) when the inputs (v1 and v2) are in phase. If a direc-
tional coupler is used instead (Section 4.4.2), the situation is reversed, because the 
outputs have 90o relative phase when the inputs are in phase, and vice versa. Fur-
thermore, a 90o relative phase shift may be introduced deliberately for some rea-
son by a phase shifter at a point in the system following the comparator. 
Hence the distinction between the two classes can be expressed in either of 
the following ways: 
1. If an observer did not know the design of the antenna but had access 
to the inputs v1 and v2 to the hybrid and plotted their angular pat-
terns, he could identify phase comparison by the fact that as the an-
gle of a distant source or target varies, v1 and v2 would have equal 
amplitude but variable relative phase. He could identify amplitude 
comparison by the fact that the amplitude ratio of v1 and v2 would 
vary but their relative phase would remain constant at 0° or 90°, de-
pending on the type of hybrid and the relative lengths of transmis-
sion lines. If the antennas had a five-horn feed, the reference-horn 
voltage would also have a constant phase and a variable amplitude 
relative to v1 and v2 but the observer would not need this informa-
tion. 
2. If the observer did not have access to the inputs to the hybrid but 
only to the sum and difference at the output of the hybrid or at some 
later point in the system, he would not be able to distinguish the two 
classes of monopulse unless he knew the characteristics of the hy-
brid and any other intervening components. Knowing these charac-
teristics, he could make the classification by referring the observed 
voltages back to the inputs to the hybrid and noting the distinction 
described above. Or he could determine whether, in the absence of 
any 90° phase shift introduced by the hybrid, the sum and differ-
ence voltages at the hybrid output would have zero or 90° relative 
phase, and thus he would classify the monopulse as amplitude com-
parison or phase comparison, respectively. 
The 0° or 90° phase of s and d in all the preceding discussion is the nominal 
phase, obtained under ideal conditions when the target is off the boresight axis. 
(When the target is on boresight, d is zero and the relative phase is undefined.) 
Under practical conditions the relative phase between s and d deviates from the 
nominal value because of noise, system imperfections, and other sources of dis-
turbance. The deviation is usually small but can become quite large under certain 

98 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
conditions. Unresolved targets or multipath, for example, can cause the relative 
phase of s and d to have any value. 
Whether the nominal relative phase of s and d is 0° or 90° is of no importance 
as far as operation of the radar is concerned. By means of phase shifters the rela-
tive phase can be transformed to the other value if the monopulse processor re-
quires it, or an equivalent transformation can be accomplished in a processor that 
uses digitized I and Q components by interchanging these components. 
5.4 DISTINCTION BASED ON RELATIVE PHASE OF ILLUMINATION 
FUNCTIONS  
It has been proved in Section 5.3.1 that in amplitude-comparison and phase-
comparison monopulse, the relative phases of the sum and difference voltages, as 
they leave the comparator, are 0° and 90° respectively. A fact that sometimes 
causes confusion, however, is that the relative phase of the sum and difference 
aperture illumination functions is just the opposite, namely 90° in amplitude com-
parison and 0° in phase comparison. The proof that follows is for the illumination 
as a function of the x-coordinate in the aperture plane. The same proof would ap-
ply to the y-coordinate. 
In amplitude comparison the two squinted beams correspond to uniform 
phase tapers in opposite directions across the aperture. At a point x in the aperture, 
the illumination phase factor due to a traverse squint angle α′s q is exp(± jkxusq), 
where k = 2π/λ and usq = sinα′sq. (Traverse angle, denoted by the symbol α′, was 
defined in Section 2.8.) The plus sign is for one squinted beam and the minus sign 
is for the other. The illumination amplitude ae(x) is an even function of x. Hence

Equations (5.34) and (5.35) show that the two illumination functions are in phase 
quadrature at each point in the aperture plane. 
To confirm that the resultant sum and difference voltages are in phase, we 
must consider an off-axis target, since the difference voltage is zero on axis. Let 
the traverse angle of arrival (target angle) be α′ar. The contribution of an element 
dx of the aperture to each squinted beam is ae(x) exp[jkx(uar ± usq)]dx. Then

Both (5.39) and (5.40) are real. Therefore the sum and difference voltages are in 
phase. For an array antenna the resultant voltages can be expressed as summations 
rather than integrals, with the same result. 
5.5 DISTINCTION BASED ON SUM AND DIFFERENCE PATTERNS  
A question arises as to whether there is anything in the shape of the sum and dif-
ference patterns (rather than just their relative phase) that distinguishes the two 
classes of monopulse. In theory, as will be illustrated later, if a given pair of sum 
and difference patterns is obtained from an amplitude-comparison antenna, the 
identical pair of sum and difference patterns (except for a 90° change in their rela-
tive phase) can be obtained from a phase-comparison antenna, and vice versa. 
However, because of the physical constraints of reflector and lens antennas, those 
designed for amplitude comparison do not produce quite the same sum and differ-
ence patterns as those designed for phase comparison. For example, the latter class 
usually gives a larger slope of the difference-to-sum ratio versus angle (which is 
desirable) but higher sum pattern sidelobes [13]. The reason for the higher 
sidelobes can be seen qualitatively in Figures 5.3(a) and 5.6(a), which plot the 
sum illumination voltages across the antenna aperture for amplitude comparison 
and phase comparison. In a reflector antenna the illumination amplitude has a 
natural taper, which is maximum at the center of each aperture and falls off at the 
edges, as illustrated. The cusp (slope discontinuity) in phase comparison produces 

100 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
large sidelobes in the sum pattern, since the pattern has a Fourier-transform rela-
tionship with the illumination function. 
5.6 APPARENT CONVERSION OF ONE CLASS TO THE OTHER  
An apparent conversion from amplitude comparison to phase comparison or vice 
versa can be effected [4] by a passive microwave device such as a 3-dB direc-
tional coupler (Section 4.4.2). When used for this purpose, the device is not part of 
the comparator. A 3-dB directional coupler splits the power from each of the two 
input ports equally between the two output ports but shifts the phase of one input 
signal by ±90° at one output port and of the other input signal by ±90° at the other 
output port. The positive or negative sign depends on the particular construction 
of the coupler. If the inputs are v1 and v2, the outputs are

In Figure 5.17 the inputs v1 and v2 shown have the same phases but different am-
plitudes, as in amplitude comparison. The outputs have the same amplitude but 
different phases, as in phase comparison.

Amplitude-Comparison and Phase-Comparison Classification 
101 
Conversely, the same kind of device can effect an apparent conversion from 
phase comparison to amplitude comparison. If the inputs have equal amplitude but 
different phases, the outputs will have equal phases but different amplitudes. To 
prove this statement, let the two inputs have equal amplitude but different phases 
ψ1 and ψ2. Assume the positive sign for the 90° phase shift. As shown in Figure 
5.18(a), v3 is the resultant of v1 and jv2, the latter being represented by the dashed 
phasor equal in amplitude to v2, but advanced 90° in phase. Since v1 and jv2 are 
equal in amplitude, their resultant v3 bisects the angle between them. Therefore the 
phase of v2 is (ψ1 + ψ2 + π/2)/2. In Figure 5.18(b), v4 is the resultant of jv1 and v2, 
and its phase is (ψ1 + π/2 + ψ2)/2. Hence, v3 and v4 have the same phase. It is ob-
vious from the figure that their amplitudes, in general, are unequal. 
Although these examples illustrate how a 3-dB coupler, or an equivalent de-
vice or circuit, appears to convert amplitude comparison to phase comparison or 
vice versa, there need not be any ambiguity in the classification if it is based on 
the “raw” component voltages v1 and v2 before the conversion.

5.7 SUMMARY OF AMPLITUDE-COMPARISON AND PHASE-
COMPARISON CLASSIFICATION 
Confusion in usage of the terms amplitude comparison and phase comparison can 
be avoided by adhering to the convention that these names refer to the receiving 
antenna, not to the monopulse signal processing. In this connection, “antenna” is 
interpreted to include not only the radiating structure but also all of the compo-
nents needed to provide the antenna pattern outputs. The two classes can be dis-
tinguished by any of four equivalent criteria, as summarized in Table 5.3.

* Applies also to space-fed arrays or reflectarrays acting essentially as lenses or reflectors. 
The first distinction (physical construction) is applicable only to space-fed an-
tennas, which include lenses or reflectors and also certain types of arrays that act 
like lenses or reflectors. 
The second distinction (nature of component beams) applies to space-fed an-
tennas and some arrays, in which the component beams exist physically in the 
sense that there are points in the system where voltages corresponding to those 
beams exist, even if they are not readily accessible for measurement. If the com-
ponent beams do not exist physically, they can still be calculated as fictitious 
beams, which would produce the given sum and difference if added and sub-
tracted. 
The third distinction (relative phase of sum and difference voltages) assumes 
that the comparator that produces the sum and difference s and d is of a type that 
does not introduce any relative phase shift between them, or that any phase shift 
that the comparator does introduce is “subtracted out” before making the classifi-
cation. 

 
Amplitude-Comparison and Phase-Comparison Classification 
103 
The fourth distinction (relative phase of sum and difference aperture illumina-
tions) is derived from the third (or vice versa) by a mathematical transformation. It 
is sometimes helpful in determining the classification of a given array radar. 
In the third and fourth distinctions, “reference” can be substituted for “sum” 
in those antennas that generate a reference pattern, for example by means of a 
separate feed horn. 
In a constrained-fed array, any sum and difference patterns that can be pro-
duced by amplitude comparison can also be produced by phase comparison and 
vice versa. In space-fed antennas the sum and difference patterns obtainable from 
the two classes are very similar but differ to some degree in monopulse slope and 
sidelobe levels. 
An apparent conversion from amplitude comparison to phase comparison or 
vice versa can be effected by applying a 90° phase shift to the sum or difference 
voltage (or by interchanging I and Q if the processing is digital), or by passing the 
component beam voltages through a 3-dB directional coupler before the compara-
tor. However, such conversion need not create any ambiguity if the classification 
is based on the voltages before the conversion.

Chapter 6 
Optimum Feeds for Space-Fed Amplitude-
Comparison Monopulse Antennas 
Although the basic principle of amplitude-comparison monopulse is easy to grasp, 
the design of the antenna and feed for optimum performance is a highly special-
ized task. The “optimum” is not absolute; it depends on the system application and 
requirements, and usually is a compromise among various performance objectives 
and practical constraints. This chapter will outline criteria for optimization in rela-
tion to feed configuration and parameters. 
The advantages and disadvantage of three basic space-fed antenna types—
lens, single reflector, and Cassegrain—are discussed in Chapter 4. To these we 
may add the space-fed array, which acts essentially as a lens or reflector. The gen-
eral principles of feed optimization apply to any of these antenna types but for the 
sake of concreteness and numerical examples, a single-reflector antenna will be 
assumed. Where the considerations in optimization of feeds for lenses differ from 
those for reflectors, that will be noted. 
6.1 
NATURE OF OPTIMIZATION  
Consider first an antenna designed to produce only a sum (reference) pattern, us-
ing only a single feed horn. The smaller the feed aperture, the broader its radiation 
pattern toward the reflector, resulting in more power wasted in spillover beyond 
the edges of the aperture, and therefore reduced gain. The larger the feed aperture, 
the more directive the feed radiation pattern. The increased directivity reduces 
spillover but if carried to excess it effectively illuminates only the inner portion of 
the reflector; thus the full aperture of the reflector is not utilized efficiently and 
gain is reduced. Another factor that must be considered is the presence of the feed 
in front of the reflector; the larger the feed, the more blockage and the larger the 
resulting reduction in gain. (This consideration is absent in optimization of a lens 

106 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
antenna.) Taking all these effects into account, the maximum-gain feed size can be 
determined. 
However, maximum gain is accompanied by high sidelobes. The sidelobes 
can be reduced at the expense of some sacrifice in gain by making the feed size 
somewhat larger than that required for maximum gain. This process must not be 
carried beyond the point where the decrease in sidelobes from spillover is offset 
by the increase in sidelobes from blockage. 
Upon balancing these conflicting factors it is found [1, 2] that in most cases 
the optimum feed aperture size is one that tapers the reflector illumination by 
about 10 or 11 dB from the center to the edge, or somewhat more if extremely low 
sidelobes are desired. As will be noted in Section 6.9, the use of multimode or 
corrugated horns better optimizes the illumination function and may permit differ-
ent taper values. 
In a monopulse feed the problem of optimization is more complicated, since 
the sum and two difference patterns have to be considered. For the sum pattern the 
usual objective is maximum on-axis gain1 consistent with sidelobe requirements. 
For each difference pattern the objective is maximum on-axis slope, again consis-
tent with sidelobe requirements. Hannan [3] analyzed this problem and derived the 
optimum aperture sizes for sum and difference feeds if each could be controlled 
independently. Although the exact numbers2 depend somewhat on the desired 
trade-off between gain (or slope) and sidelobes, the difference-feed aperture in the 
coordinate of interest should be about twice as wide as the sum-feed aperture. 
(The aperture in each case refers to the entire cluster of horns that produce the 
sum or difference pattern, not to each horn.) The sum and difference feed aper-
tures should be continuous (without gaps); therefore they must overlap. Hannan 
proposed several feed designs intended to approach optimum performance more 
closely than is possible with the basic four-horn feed. 
The twelve-horn feed, to be discussed in Section 6.9, comes closest to the 
theoretical optimum but is complicated to build. The four-horn feed, which re-
mains the most common, has overlapping sum and difference apertures, since they 
are composed of the same horns, but the apertures have the same width rather than 
the optimum 2:1 width ratio. In the early five-horn feed, on the other hand, the 
difference-feed aperture is nearly three times the width of the sum-feed aperture, 
and furthermore it has a gap in the center, since it cannot overlap the sum feed. By 
multimode operation and other techniques of shaping the feed aperture illumina-
tion, the four-horn and five-horn feeds can be made more efficient than the basic 
configuration would indicate. But although such feeds are capable of excellent 
performance, they cannot achieve simultaneous, independent optimization of sum 
                                                           
1  In some cases the objective is minimum beamwidth, which is not quite equivalent to maximum 
gain. 
2  Hannan’s results are expressed in terms of normalized feed dimensions, which must be multiplied 
by the wavelength and by twice the f/D ratio to obtain the physical dimensions.

and difference patterns. They can, however, be optimized in the sense of achiev-
ing the most effective compromise within their physical constraints. 
Particular attention will be given to the four-horn feed, which is of special in-
terest because of its long and widespread use. The feed optimization will be ex-
plained and illustrated in terms of the squint angle of the component beams, rather 
than in terms of feed sizes, as in Hannan’s analysis. The two methods of analysis 
are essentially equivalent but the squint-angle method permits the use of a simpli-
fied, approximate model, which is easier to handle mathematically and perhaps 
easier to interpret physically. It will be shown that the optimized parameters of 
this model agree closely with those of a widely used precision monopulse radar. 
Other types of feeds will also be discussed. 
6.2 
f/D RATIO 
One of the parameters to be selected is the ratio of focal length to antenna diame-
ter, known as the f/D ratio. The required diameter is determined by the specifica-
tions for gain and angular resolution of the sum pattern, leaving the focal length 
selectable. Since the feed is located at the focus, it is desirable to make the focal 
length short in order to alleviate the problem of rigidly supporting the feed in front 
of the reflector. On the other hand, small f/D poses difficulty in designing a feed 
with a wide enough radiation pattern, uniform phase, and low cross-polarization to 
provide proper illumination of the reflector. A large f/D means a shallow reflector, 
which is less sensitive to cross-polarization; but the disadvantage, in addition to 
the increased difficulty of supporting the feed, is that it requires a narrower width 
of the feed radiation pattern to prevent excessive spillover of the reflector illumi-
nation. This in turn means a larger feed aperture, which increases the blockage 
and also increases the weight of the feed, thereby further aggravating the feed 
support problem. A large f/D also increases the reaction of the reflector on the 
feed, which causes impedance mismatch.3 
In considering blockage and mechanical support, it must be remembered that 
a multihorn feed assembly, including the comparator, is larger and heavier than a 
single-horn nonmonopulse feed used, for example, in a communications antenna. 
Typical compromise values of f/D are in the range of 0.3 to 0.5 for single-
reflector antennas. For example, the AN/FPS-16 instrumentation radar has a single 
paraboloidal reflector with f = 127 cm (50 inches), D = 366 cm (12 feet), and 
f/D = 0.35. In the AN/FPQ-6 radar, which has a Cassegrain antenna, the f/D ratio 
of the main paraboloidal reflector is 0.3 but because of the Cassegrain configura-
tion the effective f/D ratio is 1.6. 
                                                           
3  The opposite would be true if the feed design remained constant while f/D increased. However, in 
order to maintain the same illumination taper across the reflector (usually about −10 dB at the edges), 
the feed directive gain must increase with f/D, and this increases the reaction.

6.3 EFFECT OF SQUINT ANGLE IN A FOUR-HORN FEED 
In the conventional four-horn feed, described and illustrated in Chapters 1 and 4, 
the horns are paired so that for each coordinate they act as two horns. Radars us-
ing four-horn feeds are in wide use and perform very well. However, with this 
horn arrangement it is not possible to optimize the sum pattern and the difference 
patterns independently, so a compromise must be reached. 
Here we will illustrate the limitation of four-horn monopulse by a simple 
model. The variable to be adjusted for optimization is the squint angle, which is a 
function of the spacing of the horn centers. We will assume that each squinted 
beam is formed with cosine illumination (see Section 5.1.4), producing the pat-
terns plotted in Figure 6.1, and that if the squint angle is varied, each squinted 
beam undergoes an angular shift but remains unchanged otherwise. The cosine 
illumination model gives a good fit to patterns produced by simple horn illumina-
tions over angular regions out to the first sidelobes. The assumption that the 
squinted pattern remains unchanged in width, height, and phase may be ques-
tioned, because as the squint angle is varied the coupling between the feed horn 
changes, causing a change in the patterns. However, at squint angles near or 
greater than the optimum, the coupling is weak. The objective here is only to illus-
trate the existence of an optimum compromise and to obtain rough numerical val-
ues. Yet in spite of the crudeness of the model, the calculated results are found to 
be remarkably close to those derived from measured patterns of the AN/FPS-16 
monopulse radar. 
Let v1 and v2 be the voltages from the two pairs of horns which produce the 
squinted beams, and from which the sum and difference in one angular coordinate 
are to be formed. The squinted beams have the patterns assumed in the model:

where θ is the target angle from the boresight axis in one coordinate, θsq is the

cosine illumination.4 In these equations the unit of θ and θsq is the half-power 
beamwidth of the squinted beams rather than of the sum beam, the latter being the 
more usual unit but less convenient for our present purposes. The quantity in 
brackets is in radians. The beamwidth constant is chosen so that v1 and v2 equal 
0.707 when θ − θsq and θ + θsq equal 0.5 (the half-power point).

The factor 1
2  arises from the fact that in a passive hybrid (assumed lossless, 
with all ports terminated in matched impedances) total output power equals total 
input power. 
Figure 6.2 shows plots of the sum and difference for various squint angles. 
The ordinates are normalized to the peaks of the squinted beams. (In the model the 
peak voltage of a squinted beam is assumed to be independent of the squint an-
gle.) 
In all these plots the field strength of the echo wave arriving at the antenna is 
assumed constant in amplitude. Only the squint angle differs from one curve to 
another. The curves for θsq = 0.3 are of doubtful validity because of appreciable 
coupling at such a small squint angle; they are included only to illustrate the trend. 
The unit of target angle on the abscissa scale in Figure 6.2 is the half-power 
beamwidth of each squinted beam, which in the beam model described above is 
assumed to be constant, independent of squint angle. The choice of this unit of 
angle is convenient for our purpose but it must be remembered that it differs from 
                                                           
4  In the exact pattern, the quantities in parentheses in (6.1) and (6.2) are the sine of the target angle 
± the sine of the squint angle. However, for angles not exceeding a few degrees the sines are closely 
approximated by the angles themselves. 

110 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
the conventional definition of the term “beamwidth,” which when used without 
qualification refers to the sum pattern. The sum pattern beamwidth does of course 
vary with squint angle. 
Figure 6.2 shows that the on-axis sum beam voltage decreases with increasing 
squint angle. When θsq = 0.5, the peak of the sum beam equals the peak of each 
squinted beam. For θsq > 0.68, the on-axis voltage changes from a maximum to a 
minimum between two peaks. The plots also show that the sum-pattern beam-
width increases with increasing squint angle. Therefore, to maximize sum-pattern 
gain and resolution the squint angle should be small. 
The difference pattern, on the other hand, has a small slope on axis when the 
squint is small, and this means poor sensitivity. The difference slope increases 
with squint angle until it reaches a maximum when θsq = 0.68 (the same squint 
angle at which the sum changes from a maximum to a minimum). This suggests 
that a large squint angle (i.e., about 0.7) is optimum for good difference pattern, at 
least for targets on or near boresight. 
Hence, it is not possible to optimize both the sum and difference patterns with 
a four-horn feed. One criterion for the optimum compromise is described in the 
Section 6.4.

6.4 OPTIMIZATION OF SQUINT ANGLE 
The criterion for optimization depends on the radar function that is to be opti-
mized. If detection sensitivity is of paramount importance and angular accuracy is 
secondary, then the squint angle should be as small as possible. (If angle mea-
surements were not needed at all, the two horns would coalesce into one and the 
squint angle would be zero.) 
Here we will assume that angular accuracy for targets on or near the axis, 
rather than detection sensitivity, is to be optimized. Consider first the case where 
the sum beam is used for both transmission and reception and the target is passive 
(i.e., one that merely scatters or reradiates the power incident on it) rather than 
active (i.e., a beacon). Although a squint angle of 0.68 maximizes the difference 
slope (Section 6.3), it will be shown that this is not the optimum. Instead, the op-
timum squint angle is the one that maximizes the product of on-axis difference 
slope and on-axis sum voltage. 
In Chapter 10 the following approximate formula is derived for the single-
pulse error due to thermal noise, for a steady target on or near the axis:

σ =
 
(6.5) 
where 
σθ = standard deviation of angle error, in the same units as θ3; 
θbw = sum-pattern 3-dB beamwidth; 
km = normalized monopulse slope (defined more fully below); 
S = sum-signal power; 
Nd = average noise power in difference channel. 
Since the unit of angle for θ and θsq used in the preceding sections is the 
beamwidth of the squinted beams, the same unit will be used here for σθ and θbw. 
The sum beam is wider than the squinted beam; therefore the ratio of θbw to indi-
vidual beamwidth is greater than unity. 
Let so be the on-axis sum voltage and let kd be the on-axis difference slope on 
any of the plots in Figure 6.2, normalized to the peaks of the squinted beams. 
(This form of normalization is not essential but is chosen for consistency with 
Section 6.3.) The normalized monopulse slope km is the ratio of kd to the maxi-
mum on-axis sum voltage so, expressed in terms of the sum half-power beam-
width; that is, 
 
d

Thus the slopes kd and km differ in two ways: they are normalized to the peak of 
the squinted beam and the peak of the sum beam, respectively, and the unit of

Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
angle is the beamwidth of a squinted beam and the beamwidth of the sum beam, 
respectively. 
By convention, the term monopulse slope (sometimes called “error slope”) 
means km unless otherwise indicated. In general it is the slope of the difference 
pattern at angle θ, in volts per sum-pattern beamwidth, divided by the sum voltage 
at angle θ, in volts. The units of km are usually expressed as volts per volt per 
beamwidth. Usually km is not exactly constant as θ varies over ±θbw/2, but varies 
somewhat with θ; here we are concerned with the on-axis value. 
To minimize the angle error σθ in (6.5) we must maximize

Figure 6.3 is a plot of the figure of merit kdso versus squint angle. The maxi-
mum occurs at a squint angle of 0.453 beamwidth of the squinted beams. With 
this squint angle, so = 1.067, kd = 1.32, θbw = 1.263 times the individual beam-
width, and the crossover point is 2.44 dB down from the peak of each squinted 
beam. The squint angle can also be expressed as 0.453/1.263 or 0.358 sum-pattern 
beamwidth. The normalized monopulse slope km is 1.635. 
The illumination functions that result from beams generated with optimum 
squint are shown in Figure 6.4. The difference illumination matches closely that 
for the cosine-tapered optimum monopulse, as shown in Figure 5.3(a). The sum 
illumination closely matches the function

6.5 COMPARISON WITH MEASURED PATTERNS 
It is interesting to compare the numbers derived from this simplified model with 
those derived from pattern measurements of an operational monopulse radar. The 
AN/FPS-16 instrumentation radar will be used as an example. 
The sum and difference patterns are known directly from measurements. Be-
cause the outputs of the individual feed horns are not normally accessible, the 
squinted beam patterns are not measured directly, but they can be inferred from 
the sum and difference patterns. The squinted patterns include the effects of mu-
tual coupling among the horns. They are not quite the same as the patterns that 
would be obtained from each horn or pair of horns if the others were removed, but 
those patterns are of no interest for our purpose, since the coupling is always pres-
ent. 
The following empirical formulas have been found to be close approxima-
tions of the measured sum and difference patterns5 of the AN/FPS-16 over the 
angular region encompassing most of the main lobe of the sum pattern [4]:

In these equations θ is the off-axis angle normalized to the 3-dB beamwidth of the 
sum pattern, and the quantities in parentheses are in radians. The coefficients 1.14 
and 2.28 in these equations differ slightly from the 1.18 and 2.36 in corresponding 
equations given in [5]. The discrepancy is the result of rounding and conversion in 
[5] of the numbers given in [4], which are in degrees. The coefficients used in 
equations (6.8) and (6.9) above are consistent with [4] and give the correct half-
power value

In elevation, for example, v1 is obtained by summing the outputs of the lower pair 
of horns and v2 is obtained in the same way from the upper pair. 
All four of the voltages in the equations above are phasors (i.e., complex) in 
general, but in pure amplitude comparison they have the same phase.6 Since abso-
lute phase is arbitrary, they will be treated as real quantities. In an actual radar the 
phases differ slightly because of the physical separation of the horns [6], but 
within the half-power beamwidth of the sum pattern this effect is negligible. 
Figure 6.5 shows the sum and difference patterns computed by (6.8) and (6.9) 
and squinted patterns computed by (6.10) and (6.11). The negative half of the dif-
ference pattern has been inverted in order to condense the vertical scale. The ab-
scissa scale unit is now the conventional beamwidth of the sum pattern rather than 
the beamwidth of the squinted patterns. The following points are of interest: 
1. The squint angles are ±0.426 beamwidth (of the sum beam). 
2. The peak of each squinted beam is down 0.3 dB from the peak of 
the sum beam. 
3. The crossover point of the squinted beams is 2.7 dB down from 
their peaks. 
4. The normalized monopulse slope km is 1.62. 
5. The half-power width of each squinted beam is 0.88 times the half-
power width of the sum pattern. That is, θ3 = 1/0.88 = 1.14.  
The crossover must always be 3 dB below the peak of the sum beam, because 
at that point v1 = v2 and

Table 6.1 compares the parameters of the AN/FPS-16 model with those of 
two optimized analytical models. The close agreement with the squinted-beam 
model may be partly fortuitous but it does suggest that the AN/FPS-16 feed design 
is close to optimum for a four-horn feed, and that the truncated septum (see Sec-
tion 4.3) may produce performance exceeding that of the optimum simple four-
horn design. In Section 6.8 it will be shown that the optimum squint angle is not 
much less than the squint angle that causes the coupling between the feed horns to 
vanish. This fact tends to justify the use of the simplified analytical model in 
which coupling is ignored.

Thus, the four-horn feed, even when using optimum beam squint, falls below 
the potential performance for a given aperture with illumination taper formed by a 
more complex feed system. 
6.6 BEACON OPERATION 
For tracking of a beacon or transmitting source, the transmission-pattern gain of 
the radar antenna has no effect on accuracy, except that if the beacon is a trans-
ponder, the radar must transmit enough power to interrogate it. On the left side of 
(6.7), therefore, the factor so
2 in the numerator is replaced by so and the right side 
of the equation is simply kd. Hence to minimize angular error the unnormalized 
on-axis slope should be maximized. This condition, according to the model plot-
ted in Figure 6.2, would require a squint angle θsq = 0.68. The radar cannot be 
simultaneously optimized for accurate tracking of skin targets and beacon targets. 
It is usually more important to optimize for skin tracking. 
6.7 COMPARISON OF BEAM SQUINT ANGLE AND FEED OFFSET 
ANGLE 
The squint angle of the beam produced by an offset feed horn is not quite the same 
as the off-axis angle of the line from the vertex of the paraboloid to the center of 
the horn. This fact is demonstrated by the AN/FPS-16 radar used in the previous 
example. The focal length of the AN/FPS-16 antenna (Figure 4.1) is about 127 cm 
(50 inches). The vertical offset of the horn centers from the paraboloid axis is 0.98 
cm (0.386 inch). Thus the feed offset angle in elevation is 0.44°, or when normal-
ized is about 0.37 times the sum beamwidth θbw, which is about 1.2°. This com-
pares with the squint angle 0.418θbw, a factor of 1.13 greater than the horn offset 
angle. According to [7–10] the beam squint angle is a little less (in a ratio of about 
0.85) than the feed offset angle,7 whereas in the present case it is greater. How-
ever, the results in the cited references were derived for a single offset feed. The 
discrepancy in the present case is probably due to mutual coupling among the 
multiple feed horns. 
In traverse the geometric offset angle of the centers of the horns is 0.86° or 
about 0.72 beamwidth. However, by the design of the feed system, including trun-
cation of the vertical septum at a point behind the feed aperture and generation of

ric centers. The result is that the squint angle is about the same in traverse as in 
elevation. 
6.8 EFFECT OF SQUINT ANGLE ON NORMALIZED DIFFERENCE 
PATTERN 
Figure 6.6 shows plots of the normalized difference signal d/s as a function of the 
angle θ from the axis, for three different squint angles θsq. For the special case θsq 
= 0.421 (in squinted beamwidths) the plot is a straight line, assuming that the 
squinted patterns are exactly those produced by cosine illumination. With this 
value of θsq all the off-axis sum and difference nulls coincide. It can be shown that 
with θsq = 0.421 the two squinted beams are orthogonal, which means that their 
coupling is zero. For θsq < 0.421 the plot curves upward. If this plot were extended 
to the right, it would become infinite at the first sum null, which occurs before the 
first off-axis difference null. For θsq > 0.421 the plot curves downward. If ex-
tended to the right, it would pass through zero at the first off-axis difference null, 
which occurs before the first sum null. The particular values of θsq chosen for the 
plots, besides 0.421, are 0.453 (the optimized value derived in Section 6.4 for 
minimum angular error) and an arbitrary value of 0.400. The slopes of the three

curves at the origin are not to be interpreted as a figure of merit in themselves. As 
explained above, slope must be considered in combination with the sum-signal 
voltage gain, unless the radar is operating in a beacon or receive-only mode. 
The usual shape of the normalized difference pattern is concave upward, like 
the bottom curve in Figure 6.4. The actual output of a monopulse radar follows 
such a curve over a moderate range of angles (usually over the sum-pattern 
beamwidth), then starts to saturate because of dynamic range limitations in receiv-
ers or in the processor. 
6.9 OTHER FEED CONFIGURATIONS 
In a five-horn feed such as the one used in the AN/FPQ-6 radar, shown schemati-
cally in Figure 4.12, the central horn R provides a reference signal that serves the 
same function as the sum signal in a four-horn feed; it is used for transmission as 
well as reception. The difference signals in traverse and elevation are obtained 
from the left and right horns A and B and from the lower and upper horns C and D 
respectively. The four outer horns are used only for reception. 
Both four-horn and five-horn feeds have been used successfully. Each has 
certain advantages and disadvantages. 
The five-horn feed has more degrees of freedom than the horn-horn feed but 
still does not permit independent optimization of sum and difference patterns. 
Although the aperture dimensions of the individual horns can be chosen somewhat 
independently, the spacing of the outer horns depends on the dimensions of the 
central horn, since the horns cannot physically overlap. Either the squint angle is 
larger than optimum for the difference pattern (while in the four-horn feed it is 
smaller than optimum) or the reference horn is smaller than optimum for the sum 
pattern. Therefore a compromise is necessary. 
The five-horn feed has an advantage in that the reference pattern is produced 
by a single horn and requires no hybrids. This simplifies the RF hardware, reduces 
losses and troublesome adjustments, and simplifies the transmission of high pow-
ers through the feed. The five-horn feed also has some advantages over the four-
horn feed when dual polarization is required, because of the smaller number of 
hybrids. On the other hand, the feed itself is a more complicated structure (com-
pared to a four-horn feed) and is generally larger in size, causing more blockage 
(in a reflector system). 
An alternate version of a five-horn feed uses a dielectric-loaded center horn. 
This permits a reduction in size of the center horn while maintaining its directiv-
ity, thus bringing the outer horns closer together and improving the difference 
patterns. A disadvantage is that the dielectric has some loss. Care must be taken to 
ensure that this loss, even though small (of the order of a tenth of a dB), does not 
cause excessive heating of the dielectric. The AN/MPS-36 is an example of a ra-
dar that uses this type of feed, with boron nitride as the dielectric. 

 
Optimum Feeds for Space-Fed Monopulse 
119 
A configuration that approaches the theoretical goal of simultaneous optimi-
zation of the sum and difference patterns is the experimental 12-horn feed design 
by Lincoln Laboratory [11] and discussed by Hannan [3]. It is shown schemati-
cally in Figure 6.7. All unused outputs of the hybrids are terminated in matched 
dummy loads, omitted from the diagram. The twelve-horn feed is equivalent in 
effect to a five-horn feed with overlapping horns. To see the equivalence, compare 
Figure 6.7 with the illustration of a five-horn feed in Figure 4.11. The correspon-
dence is as shown in Table 6.2. 
The 12-horn feed was reported to give near-optimum performance, but be-
cause of the complexity of the feed and comparator it has not been adopted for 
general use in U.S. systems.

Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
The foregoing discussions and illustrations of feed systems and comparators 
have assumed the use of a single polarization. If dual linear or circular polariza-
tion is used, the arrangement is similar but somewhat more complicated. The 
horns are usually square or circular for equal reception of both components. RF 
devices are needed to extract the two polarization components and process them 
either simultaneously or by switching.  
The use of multiple modes of waveguide propagation (known as multimode 
operation) has already been mentioned. It is analogous to the use of harmonic fre-
quency components added to a fundamental frequency to shape a waveform by 
Fourier synthesis. The sum signal is composed of even modes; the difference sig-
nal in each coordinate is composed of modes that are odd in that coordinate and 
even in the other. The mode synthesis permits flexibility in the shaping of the feed 
aperture illumination even though the physical dimensions are fixed. Besides its 
use in optimized four-horn feeds, it has been used or proposed in certain special 
feed configurations in which a single feed horn produces both a sum and differ-
ence pattern in one coordinate [12] or a sum and both difference patterns [13–15]. 
The horn aperture has the width needed for the optimum difference pattern but the 
sum-pattern illumination is concentrated near the center so that in effect it occu-
pies only about half the physical dimension. This type of feed is theoretically ca-
pable of closely approaching simultaneous optimization of sum and difference 
patterns, but control of the higher-order modes over a broad frequency band is a 
difficult design problem. 
One of the feed configurations proposed by Hannan [3], and used success-
fully in radars such as the Nike Hercules tracker, combines multimode operation 
in one coordinate with physical aperture control in the other coordinate. It consists 
of four parallel, contiguous, rectangular horns joined by common walls in their 
long dimension (Figure 6.8). For the purpose of description, let the horns be num-
bered sequentially. The difference pattern in the coordinate of polarization (the 
short dimension of each horn) is obtained from (1 + 2) − (3 + 4) and the reference 
is obtained by (2 + 3). This conforms to Hannan’s rule that the feed aperture 
should be about twice as wide for the difference as it is for the reference. In the 
long dimension, multimode shaping of the horn aperture illumination is done in 
such a way that the odd component (for the difference) uses the entire aperture 
while the even component (for the reference) is mostly concentrated in the central 
portion, effectively using one-half of the physical aperture. 
Hannan presented data on the relative performance of four-horn, twelve-horn, 
and the four-horn multimode feed, showing that the last option provided greater 
sum-channel gain, largely the result of lower spillover loss, and significantly 
greater monopulse sensitivity. Measured by the sum-channel aperture efficiency 
ηa and the difference slope ratio Kr (averaged between azimuth and elevation co-
ordinates), the values for the three options were listed in Table 6.3.

Further development based on Hannan’s four-horn multimode feed was per-
formed during the 1970s, leading to the five-horn multimode feed for the Patriot 
fire control radar, shown in Figure 6.9. Three center horns now provide the sum 
and azimuth difference patterns, the former using the central portions of these 
horns. The elevation difference pattern is provided by the central portions of the 
upper and lower pairs. In its original design the Patriot radar was to use two 
transmitters, selected by steering the focal point of the lens array to one of the 
transmitting horns located beside the monopulse receiving horn stack. This so-
called “space duplexing” provision eliminates the loss of a high-power duplexer 
that would otherwise be required, and makes possible a simpler, low-power mo-
nopulse horn stack. 
More detailed information on optimized design of monopulse feeds can be 
found in [3] and in [11–16], several of which are reprinted in [17].

Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
Another modern development in feed horn design is the corrugated horn [18]. 
For a single pencil beam or monopulse reference beam this type of horn gives 
improved efficiency with low sidelobes. It has found use in satellite communica-
tion antennas and other systems where the monopulse performance requirements 
are modest or where monopulse is not needed at all. However, it is difficult to 
adapt for high-performance monopulse operation. 
The ultimate in independent optimization of sum and difference patterns is an 
array antenna with amplitude weighting of each element, independently tailored 
for sum signal and two difference signals. Such optimization is possible with the 
Lopez feed discussed in Chapter 7, and with digital beamforming systems in 
which received signals from each radiating element are converted to digital form. 
6.10 SUMMARY OF FEED OPTIMIZATION 
It has been shown theoretically that for optimization of space-fed amplitude-
comparison monopulse antennas the effective feed dimension in each coordinate 
must be about twice as large for the difference pattern as for the sum (reference) 
pattern. In a feed with four horns in a conventional square (or rectangular) ar-
rangement this requirement cannot be met; either the sum or difference pattern can 
be optimized but not both simultaneously. The simplified analysis that has been 
presented illustrates how optimization of the sum and difference patterns imposes

rate horns, beside the receiving feed, can be selected for transmitting by focusing the array on it.

conflicting requirements, and shows how a compromise is reached. If minimum 
angular error on skin targets is the objective, the best compromise is one that 
maximizes the product of on-axis sum voltage and on-axis difference slope. The 
analysis ignores such factors as impedance matching and feed coupling, besides 
using an inexact model for the squinted beams. Nevertheless the results agree 
closely with the monopulse characteristics of the AN/FPS-16 instrumentation ra-
dar, as inferred from measured patterns. Although not theoretically optimum, the 
conventional four-horn feed has practical advantages and has been used success-
fully in many radars. 
A five-horn feed provides somewhat greater flexibility but still requires a 
compromise, since it is also incapable of simultaneous optimization of reference 
and difference patterns. A 12-horn feed, using the four central horns for the refer-
ence, and the central horns plus four additional horns in each coordinate for the 
two differences, can come close to simultaneous optimization at the expense of 
considerable complexity in the feed and comparator. Separation of the transmit-
ting and receiving horns, using polarization screens or switching the focal point of 
a space-fed lens between separate horns (space duplexing), allows the monopulse 
horn to be designed in more compact form for low-power operation and also 
eliminates the need for a high-power duplexer with its associated loss. 
The use of higher-order waveguide modes in combination with the fundamen-
tal modes makes it possible to shape the illumination to reduce the effective aper-
ture width for the sum pattern while using the full aperture for the difference pat-
tern, and thus approach the optimum more closely. This principle has been used to 
improve the performance of conventional four-horn feeds. A further step toward 
optimization is a feed devised by Hannan consisting of four horns in a stacked 
rather than square arrangement; for the E-plane patterns the inner two horns are 
used for the reference and all four are used for the difference, while the desired H-
plane illumination is obtained by multimode operation within each horn. The addi-
tion of a fifth horn to the stack allows somewhat better performance in the eleva-
tion coordinate. By use of multimode techniques it is even possible to produce 
near-optimum reference and difference patterns with a single feed horn. However, 
broadband control of the various modes is difficult.

Chapter 7 
Monopulse in Array Antennas 
In the preceding chapters most of the specific examples and illustrations of mo-
nopulse have been drawn from systems using reflector or lens antennas in which 
the beam is steered by mechanical rotation. It has been pointed out, however, that 
the principles and techniques of monopulse are not limited to those types of an-
tennas. In particular, monopulse has been implemented in various ways in array 
antennas. Some preliminary comments about monopulse in array antennas were 
presented in Sections 5.2.6 and 5.8. 
The subject of array antennas is very broad and is treated extensively in the 
technical literature (see, for example, [1–6]). Array antennas can be steered either 
mechanically or electronically in either or both coordinates. Combinations of me-
chanical and electronic steering are common. A brief general summary will be 
given in Section 7.1. The remainder of the chapter will treat particular aspects of 
the subject that pertain to monopulse, with emphasis on the differences between 
monopulse in array antennas and in mechanically steered reflector or lens anten-
nas. The space-fed array antenna, which combines many of the features of me-
chanically steered reflector or lens antennas with the ability to scan electronically, 
will be discussed as a special case. 
7.1 
PRINCIPLES OF OPERATION  
A voltage pattern of an antenna is approximately equal to the Fourier transform of 
the aperture illumination function1 from which it was produced (see Sections 2.2, 
2.3, 5.1.3, and 5.2.6). In a space-fed reflector or lens antenna the illumination 
function is determined by the design of the feed, the f/D ratio, and any power 
                                                           
1  Also called the aperture distribution function or simply the aperture function.

Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
dividers, combiners, or hybrids used in forming the pattern. This applies equally 
to mechanically and electronically scanned reflectors and lenses. 
In array antennas using constrained (or corporate) feeds, however, the illumi-
nation function is formed directly in the aperture plane by control of the ampli-
tudes and phases of the excitation coefficients of the individual radiating elements 
of the array. The elements are usually a set of identical radiators such as dipoles, 
open ends of waveguides, slots in waveguides, or horns. For reasons of economy 
or design simplification, with some sacrifice in performance, the elements are 
sometimes grouped into subarrays. The amplitude is then uniform within each 
subarray but differs from one subarray to the next. Phase control is still exercised 
over the individual elements. To avoid needless repetition, the word “element” 
will be used hereafter to include subarrays as well, except where a distinction is 
being made. 
In airborne radars and missile seekers, the antenna often takes the form of a 
lightweight flat-plate array of slotted waveguides that is mounted on a gimbal 
assembly for mechanical steering in pitch and yaw. In this case the illumination 
function is determined by the network that couples the waveguides to the common 
feed point and by the size and orientation of the slots in the waveguide walls. The 
steering of the beam is entirely mechanical. Monopulse is commonly used in such 
airborne arrays. 
In surveillance radars a monopulse antenna may take the form of horizontal 
slotted waveguides or rows of dipoles with constrained feed networks, stacked 
vertically and fed through a vertical power-dividing network that may contain 
phase shifters or a frequency-sensitive network for electronic steering in elevation. 
The monopulse network is usually applied only in the elevation coordinate, me-
chanical scanning being used to cover 360° in azimuth. Examples will be shown 
in Chapter 14. 
Electronic scan in both coordinates requires phase control of each individual 
element. The pattern direction is steered by imposing an appropriate linear phase 
progression from element to element along the aperture in the desired direction. 
The element amplitudes are set at values that will produce the illumination func-
tion for the desired pattern shape. These amplitudes are usually fixed by the feed 
network, and therefore the pattern shape remains approximately invariant in sine 
space (but not in angle space) as the beam direction changes. To control the phase 
function for steering requires the ability to change the phases of the individual 
elements, and an antenna with this capability is commonly called a phased array 
or electronically scanned array (ESA). The term electronic scanning seems to 
imply that the beam motion follows a regular pattern, and electronic steering 
might be more appropriate for the irregular and arbitrary beam motions that are 
actually used in most cases. 
The most recent development in array antennas is the active electronically 
scanned array (AESA), in which each element of the array includes the final 
power amplification stages of a distributed transmitter and the first, low-noise 

 
Monopulse in Array Antennas 
127 
amplifier (LNA) stages of the receiver, as well as the phase shifter. The con-
strained feed networks for transmission and receiving (including monopulse net-
works) can then be implemented more simply, as the network loss appears only in 
the excitation signal input to the modular amplifiers and the outputs of the receiv-
ing LNAs, where it has negligible effect on the system performance. While the 
aperture illumination for transmitting is usually uniform, to take advantage of the 
saturated power output of the element amplifiers, it is also possible to adjust this 
power electronically for individual elements to control the transmit illumination 
function. In other respects, at least with regard to monopulse performance, the 
operation of the AESA is similar to that of the ESA. 
There are three principal methods of electronic steering: 
1. Phase steering by electronically controlled changes in the setting of 
a variable phase shifter in the feed line of each element. 
2. Time-delay steering by electronically controlled changes in the set-
ting of a variable time-delay device in the feed line of each element 
or subarray. 
3. Frequency steering by changes in frequency. In series-fed arrays 
designed for frequency steering, the incremental pathlength that the 
wave travels between successive elements causes a frequency-
dependent phase increment that is sufficient to steer the beam over 
the desired scan sector. 
An array antenna may use different methods of steering in the two angular 
coordinates; for example, frequency steering in one coordinate and phase steering 
in the other. When steering electronically in only one coordinate, a phase shifter 
or other controllable device is used at each row or column, rather than at the indi-
vidual element. When time-delay steering is used, it is often applied to subarrays, 
rather than to individual elements, which then have their own phase shifters. 
Two simultaneous receiving patterns (a sum and a difference) are needed for 
monopulse in a single angular coordinate and three (a sum and two differences) 
are needed in two-coordinate monopulse. The sum and difference patterns (as well 
as the transmitting pattern) are all steered in the same direction and therefore they 
use the same settings of the element phases, but different amplitude weights. 
The methods of distributing power to, and collecting power from, the ele-
ments are divided into two major categories: space feeds (also called optical 
feeds) and constrained feeds (also called corporate feeds). These were defined in 
Section 4.3. Examples of each will be given below. 
The main advantage of array antennas is their ability to change beam direc-
tion rapidly, without inertia. Disadvantages include complexity, cost, and limita-
tion of the electronic scan sector to about ±60° from broadside (normal to the ar-
ray face). 
The choice among the various types of monopulse processors, several of 
which will be described in Chapter 8, is theoretically independent of the type of 

128 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
antenna used, and therefore that chapter applies equally well to array antennas. 
For operational reasons, however, certain combinations are unsatisfactory. For 
example, a multifunction radar that uses an array antenna for short dwells in vari-
ous directions (perhaps only one pulse per dwell) must have a processor that pro-
vides instantaneous normalization rather than a slow-acting processor using AGC. 
7.2 
ARRAY COORDINATES 
The most convenient coordinate system in which to express patterns of a planar 
array is sine space. The coordinate system was defined and explained in Section 
2.8. The sine-space coordinates (u,v) of a specified direction are u = sinα′ and v = 
sin β′ where α and β are the angles measured from normal to the x-axis and the y-
axis, respectively, with the x-axis usually horizontal. Equivalent expressions for u 
and v are u = cosα and v = cos β, where the primes indicate the complementary 
angles (measured from the x-axis and the y-axis, respectively). 
When a pattern of an array is steered away from broadside by a linear phase 
function while the amplitude function remains unchanged, the pattern broadens 
and becomes distorted in angle space. When plotted in sine space, however, with 
the axis shifted to the beam steering direction, the pattern remains nearly invari-
ant, and the same is true of the monopulse calibration function, since it is the ratio 
of nearly invariant difference and sum patterns. The monopulse outputs for the 
two coordinates are functions of Δu = cosα − cosαst and Δv = cosβ − cosβst, 
where the subscript st designates the steering direction. 
The channels that carry the difference signals for the two coordinates are of-
ten denoted by the symbols Δaz and Δel, but it is understood that the respective 
coordinates are not really azimuth and elevation. The first coordinate is more 
properly called traverse; the second will be identified in this chapter as “elevation” 
for lack of a generally recognized correct name. A simple way to avoid the no-
menclature problem is to label the two difference channels dα and dβ (or Δα and 
Δβ), with the understanding that the signals they carry are responsive to the re-
spective components of the sine-space deviations, not angular deviations, of the 
target direction from the beam steering direction. 
7.3 
ARRAYS WITH SPACE FEEDS 
The most common use of space feeds is in mechanically steered reflector and lens 
antennas, as discussed in earlier chapters and illustrated in Figures 4.1–4.3. In an 
analogous way they are used in certain types of array antennas that serve the same 
purpose as reflectors and lenses and in addition have the capability of rapid beam 
steering. 

 
Monopulse in Array Antennas 
129 
A lens-type array, illustrated in Figure 7.1(a), has radiating elements on the 
opposite parallel faces, coupled by electronically controlled phase shifters. A re-
flector-type array (or reflectarray), illustrated in Figure 7.1(b), has radiating ele-
ments on one face; each element is connected to a short-circuit termination 
through a phase shifter. The short circuit reflects the incoming wave back in the 
opposite direction. Since each phase shifter is traversed twice, it is set for half the 
desired phase shift. The phase shifter for the reflectarray must be reciprocal, in 
order to produce the desired phase shift in the round-trip path to and from the 
short circuit. This contrasts with the lens array, where nonreciprocal phase shifters 
can be used with their magnetic field reversed between transmission and reception 
of each pulse. The feed for a space-fed array can be any of the types of monopulse 
feeds described in previous chapters, such as a four-horn feed. 
As in the case of an optical reflector or lens, an array acting as a reflector or 
lens converts the curved phase front from the feed into a plane wave front in

transmission and does the reverse in reception, as shown in Figure 7.1. The con-
version is accomplished by the appropriate phase function introduced by the phase 
shifters. Added to that phase function are the linear phase tapers needed to steer 
the beam to the desired direction in each coordinate. The illumination amplitude 
function is determined by the feed, as in the case of physical lens and reflector 
antennas, and the monopulse is classified as amplitude comparison, as defined in 
Chapter 5. 
Several types of space-fed lens phased arrays have been produced in quanti-
ties. These systems combine mechanical steering of the scan field and electronic 
steering within that field, typically an azimuth sector of 90° to 120° and an eleva-
tion sector from the horizon to near zenith. The radars are used in fire control for 
land-based air and missile defense systems. The lens is a circular or elliptical pla-
nar array of passive phase-shifting elements, fed by a multihorn, multimode mo-
nopulse horn cluster evolved from those used previously in metal-plate lens and 
reflector antennas. The lens has uniform mechanical thickness, and by careful 
matching of the planar array structure and elements to the air on both sides of the 
lens the losses encountered in metal-plate and other lens types can be held to satis-
factorily low levels. Each phase shifter is controlled electronically to provide both 
the focusing and the steering phase components. The monopulse features, compo-
nents and performance are similar to those in mechanically steered systems.  
An example of a space-fed lens array is the Russian system shown in Figure 
7.2, known under its NATO name Tombstone. The array uses circularly polarized 
Faraday rotator phase shifters, in which right-hand circular polarization (RHCP) is

transmitted and left-hand circular polarization (LHCP) is received (or vice versa) 
after reflection from the target with a single bounce. These phase shifters are re-
ciprocal, since the transmitted RHCP is shifted by the same amount as the re-
ceived LHCP traveling in the opposite direction. The feed system, shown in Fig-
ure 7.3, supports this mode of operation with separate, linearly polarized transmit-
ting and receiving feeds and a polarization screen. The transmitting horn in this 
case is horizontally polarized, and is located at the bottom of the sketch, directed 
upwards toward a planar reflecting screen oriented at a 45° angle to the lens axis 
and consisting of horizontal wires. After being reflected from these wires, and 
prior to reaching the array, the emissions pass through a polarizing grid (located 
beneath a plastic radome at the lower left of Figure 7.2) that converts the waves to 
RHCP. The phase shifters are set to convert the RHCP spherical wave from the 
transmitting horn into a plane wave directed to the desired angle in space.  
Single-bounce reflection from the target converts the received wave to LHCP. 
This is focused by the lens and is converted by the polarizing grid to vertical po-
larization, which passes directly through the 45° screen of horizontal wires to the 
vertically polarized receiving feed. The eight-horn monopulse feed forms a sum 
pattern from the two center horns, elevation difference from the center, upper, and 
lower horns, and traverse difference from the center and side horns, using multi-
mode techniques to optimize the sum and both difference patterns. The resulting 
illumination is similar to that of the 12-horn feed shown in Figure 6.7. The system 
needs no high-power duplexer, since the polarizing grid and 45° reflecting screen 
isolate the receiving feed from the transmission. A succession of Russian and 
Chinese fire control radars use this antenna technique, which requires the phase-
shifters to be reset only when a change in beam position is required, rather than 
before and after each transmitted pulse. This is an important property of the array, 
as it permits transmission of high-PRF waveforms without the expenditure of time

essary if they were not reciprocal. 
7.4 
ARRAYS WITH CONSTRAINED FEEDS 
In a constrained feed, power is distributed to, and collected from, the elements by 
waveguides or transmission lines (constrained within the walls or outer conduc-
tors). An advantage of array antennas with constrained feeds is the high degree of 
control that they permit in the design of illumination amplitude functions to obtain 
desired patterns. In addition, they have no spillover and no blockage, although 
they may have significant loss in the feed network. Simultaneous optimization of 
the sum and difference patterns is possible, in contrast to the compromise that is 
usually necessary in reflector or lens antennas (see Chapter 6). This does not mean 
that optimization is necessarily fully achieved in the design of an array antenna; 
for economy and design simplification some compromises are often made, but 
optimization can be approached more closely than in reflector or lens antennas. 
7.4.1 
Constrained-Fed Arrays Divided into Quadrants or Subarrays 
A simple method of obtaining monopulse operation is to split the array into sym-
metrical quadrants. The outputs of the elements in each quadrant are summed to 
produce four signals that are then combined to form a sum and two differences. 
Figure 7.4(a) shows a cosine sum illumination and a difference illumination 
formed in a quadrant-split array. The discontinuity at the center of the difference 
illumination causes high sidelobes in the corresponding difference pattern, shown 
in Figure 7.4(b). These sidelobes extend many beamwidths each side of the axis, 
accepting interference (jamming, clutter, multipath reflections) that can greatly 
increase the tracking error. A plot of the patterns in decibel form, covering ±15 
beamwidths from the axis, is shown in Figure 7.5. The difference sidelobes re-
main above −30 dB throughout this sector, falling away slowly at larger angles. 
The need to compromise between sum and difference channel performance 
can be eased by dividing the aperture into more than two modules in each coordi-
nate, at the expense of additional hybrids and couplers. One approach to reducing 
the center discontinuity is to subdivide each quadrant of the array into subarrays, 
and use a more complicated network to adjust separately the sum and difference 
coupling to these subarrays. The waveguide network behind a flat-plate 
waveguide antenna then appears more like that shown in Figure 7.6. Within each 
subarray, the power-splitting network can be implemented in stripline or printed 
structure not visible in this photograph.

7.4.2 
Constrained-Fed Arrays with Independent Illuminations 
Two monopulse feed arrangements will be shown that permit essentially inde-
pendent shaping of sum and difference patterns so that each can be optimized. The 
first is illustrated in simplified form in Figure 7.7. An example of its use is in the 
AN/SPY-1A radar [7]. Figure 7.7(a) shows one column of the array. Each sym-
metrical pair of elements is connected to a hybrid that yields the sum and differ-
ence of the pair. The sums of all pairs are added with an appropriate set of weights 
in the column sum combiner to produce the column sum, and the differences of 
the pairs are added with a different set of weights in the column difference com-
biner to produce the column difference.  
Figure 7.7(b) shows how the sum and difference signals of the entire array are 
formed. The column sums from all the columns are combined in symmetrical 
pairs, each pair being connected to a hybrid that yields their sum and difference. 
The sums and differences of all the column sum pairs go to the array sum com-
biner and the α (traverse) difference combiner respectively, where they are added 
with independent sets of amplitude weights to obtain the array sum voltage s and 
the traverse difference voltage dα. Likewise, the column differences from all the 
columns are combined in symmetrical pairs, each pair being connected to a hybrid 
that produces their sum and difference. The difference is terminated in a dummy 
load. The sums of all the column difference pairs are added with appropriate 
weights in the “elevation” combiner to obtain the “elevation” difference voltage dβ 
for the entire array.

Because different sets of amplitude weights are used in the different com-
biners shown in Figure 7.7, the aperture amplitude distributions can be tailored 
independently for the sum and the two differences to obtain nearly optimized pat-
terns. In the arrangement shown in that figure the independence is not complete 
because the sum and traverse difference share the same weighting within each 
column. However, this dependence imposes very little penalty on performance, 
since the optimum weighting within each column is nearly the same for the sum 
and traverse difference. Completely independent amplitude distributions for the 
sum and the two differences can be obtained at the price of additional complexity. 
A second method of optimizing both sum and difference illuminations is the 
Lopez feed, described in [8] and shown in Figure 7.8. Each element is coupled to 
both the primary and the secondary line, shown in Figure 7.8(a). The primary feed 
line and couplers are designed to handle the full transmitter power and produce 
 
Figure 7.7   Array with nearly independent sum and difference illuminations: (a) formation of column 
sum and difference; and (b) formation of array sum and differences. 

136 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
the desired sum illumination function shown in Figure 7.8(b). The difference port 
of the hybrid at the center of the primary line would produce the center disconti-
nuity, as in Figure 7.8(c) and in Figure 7.4(a). The coupling to the secondary line 
modifies each element’s coupling to the difference port, canceling the discontinu-
ity in the difference illumination and producing the desired smooth difference 
illumination function shown in Figure 7.8(b). 
The examples discussed here and in Section 7.4.1 are intended only to illus-
trate the variety of ways in which monopulse can be implemented in arrays with 
constrained feeds. Other examples can be found in the cited references. 
7.4.3 
Efficient Illumination Tapers for Phased Arrays 
A corporate feed that permits independent control of illumination functions for 
sum and differences can implement tapers such as those defined by Taylor [9, 10] 
and Bayliss [11], that combine low sidelobes with narrow beamwidth and high 
efficiency. Patterns using the “Taylor n  taper” have the property that the first n  
sidelobe peaks on each side of the main lobe are all equal to a specified level. The

n − on each side fall off with increasing u. For example, 
for SLPR = 1,000 = 30 dB, n  = 3, and the pattern is shown in Figure 7.9(a). One 
method of establishing the difference-channel illumination function gd(x) is to 
weight the sum illumination function g(x) by the linear-odd function, producing 
the function gd(x) = xg(x) and a pattern that is the derivative of the sum pattern 
with respect to angle, as shown in Figure 7.9(b). Note that the first difference-
pattern sidelobes using this method are 10 dB higher than those of the sum pattern 
and fall off steadily with off-axis angle. In order to hold the maximum difference-
pattern sidelobes to the same level as those of the sum pattern, it would be neces-
sary to base the difference illumination function on a sum taper with lower 
sidelobes than those of the actual sum pattern (−40 dB, in this case). 
 
Plots of sum and difference patterns and illumination functions, and ta-
bles listing the beamwidth factors, efficiencies, and difference slopes for several 
sidelobes levels are presented in [12]. For the patterns shown in Figure 7.9, the 
values are as in Table 7.1 (where the aperture efficiency assumes equal tapers in 
the two coordinates). 
Similar results are obtained for the Taylor circular-aperture tapers and the 
Bayliss taper. The latter is a difference-channel taper designed to maximize slope, 
for a given sidelobe level with the circular aperture.

CLASSIFICATION AS AMPLITUDE OR PHASE COMPARISON 
Chapter 5 discussed the classification of monopulse radars as amplitude compari-
son or phase comparison, based on the convention that the distinction resides in 
the antenna (including the feed system and the comparator or beamformer), not in 
the processing that follows.

In a reflector or lens antenna the distinction is obvious from the physical con-
struction. By analogy, the space-fed arrays described in Section 7.3 are all seen to 
belong to the amplitude-comparison class. 
In constrained-fed arrays the distinction is usually not evident from the exter-
nal physical appearance, but requires knowledge of the feed and beamformer. The 
first array described in Section 7.4.1 is divided into four quadrants to produce mo-
nopulse operation. This type of array is equivalent to the four-reflector antenna 
shown in Figure 5.5 and is likewise classified as phase comparison. The classifica-
tion of the first array described in Section 7.4.2 (and illustrated in Figure 7.7) can 
be determined by either of the criteria listed in the last two columns of Table 5.1, 
namely the relative phase of the sum and difference voltages or the relative phase 
of the sum and difference aperture illuminations. The relative phase in each case is 
interpreted on the assumption that the hybrids and combiners are of types that 
introduce no relative phase shift (see Section 4.4). Since the steering phase affects 
the sum and difference equally, it can be ignored, so the analysis is simplified by 
assuming broadside (unsteered) patterns. 
Consider first a single column of the array, as in Figure 7.7(a). When the ar-
ray is receiving a plane wave from a distant target which is off-axis in “elevation,” 
any symmetrically located pair of elements will deliver voltages like those labeled 
e1 and e2 in Figure 7.10. The sum and difference phasors in the figure are reduced 
in length by a factor of 
2,  for the reason explained in Section 2.4. Voltages e1 
and e2 have equal amplitudes but different phases. Their phase difference is pro-
portional to the distance of the pair of elements from the center, but the sum volt-
age of any pair always has the phase that would be obtained from an element lo-
cated at the center of the column. The difference voltage of the pair differs in 
phase by 90° from the sum. Since the sums of all the pairs have equal phase and 
the differences of all pairs have equal phase, the column sum and the column dif-
ference are in phase quadrature. By extending this reasoning to the entire array 
 
Figure 7.10   Phase relationships of a symmetrical pair of elements, their sum, and their difference. 

140 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
with the aid of Figure 7.7(b), it is found that when the target is off-axis in both 
coordinates, the dα and dβ difference voltages are in phase quadrature with the 
sum voltage s. According to the next-to-the-last column in Table 5.3, this type of 
array is therefore classified as phase comparison. 
The same conclusion is reached by examining the relative phase of the sum 
and difference illumination functions. This is most easily visualized by assuming 
transmission and invoking reciprocity for reception. Examination of Figure 7.7 
shows that if the same transmitter were connected in turn to each of the three ports 
s, dα, and dβ, the aperture illumination would have the same phase in all three 
cases (180° phase being regarded as 0° phase with a change in sign of the ampli-
tude). The last column of Table 5.3 again leads to the phase-comparison classifi-
cation. 
There is an interesting difference, however, between this example of phase-
comparison monopulse and that of the four-reflector cluster shown in Figure 5.5. 
In the reflector antenna the illumination for each of the component beams (from 
which the sum and differences are obtained) is limited to one quadrant, with no 
overlap except for a small amount of spillover between the reflectors. In the array 
antenna the component beams do not exist physically; that is, there are no points 
in the system where their voltages are present. However, their illumination func-
tions can be derived mathematically by addition and subtraction of the known sum 
and difference illumination functions and division by 
2,  as with the pattern 
voltages in (2.3) and (2.4). In an example, the sum and difference illuminations 
are assumed to be a cosine function and a full-cycle sine function, respectively. 
The relative scales of the sum and difference illuminations are such that the total 
sum and difference powers are equal. The resulting illumination functions for the 
fictitious component beams are shown in Figure 7.11. They show that the illumi-
nation functions of the component beams overlap, and in fact each one extends

over the entire array aperture. They produce the same amplitude patterns but with 
different phase centers. Actual illumination functions may differ from those as-
sumed in Figure 7.11 but will generally be similar in form. 
Usually the amplitude-comparison or phase-comparison classification of a 
constrained-fed array is a matter of academic rather than practical interest. More 
important descriptors are the method of steering, the angular coverage, the spe-
cific type of feed, the type of elements, and the sum and difference illumination 
functions. The amplitude- or phase-comparison classification can be ambiguous 
unless the users of these terms adhere to a common set of definitions and criteria 
such as those presented in Chapter 5. Thus, the classification is not affected by the 
type of processor or by any operation subsequent to the formation of the sum and 
difference. 
7.6 
SPECIAL TYPES OF ARRAYS 
Although mechanical and electronic steering have been treated separately, they 
are sometimes combined in hybrid arrangements. For some applications rapid 
electronic steering is needed only over a narrow electronic sector at any one time, 
and that sector can be centered in any required direction by slower, less agile me-
chanical steering or mechanical scanning of the entire array. Such a combination 
can be simpler and cheaper than all-electronic steering over a wide angle. Another 
arrangement consists of mechanical rotation of the array in azimuth combined 
with electronic steering or scanning in elevation. (Even when the array is designed 
for electronic steering in only one coordinate, it can have monopulse in both coor-
dinates.) It is also possible to feed a mechanically steered reflector with a small 
array (in lieu of a horn feed) for rapid steering over a small angle from the reflec-
tor axis. In such hybrid arrangements the monopulse techniques are essentially the 
same as in other array antennas. The required coordinate conversions (usually to 
azimuth and elevation) may be either simpler or more complicated than in fixed 
arrays, depending on the configuration. 
Monopulse operation is not limited to planar arrays. It can be implemented, 
for example, in circular or conformal arrays. The coordinate system described in 
Section 7.2 does not apply to nonplanar arrays. The coordinate system and the 
phase function needed to “flatten” the curves phase front must be worked out for 
each configuration.

Chapter 8 
Monopulse Processors 
The monopulse processor is that portion of a monopulse radar that operates on the 
voltages derived from the simultaneous antenna patterns to produce the mo-
nopulse outputs. This chapter deals with the functions, properties, and design 
characteristics of monopulse processors.  
It is difficult to categorize the many types of monopulse processors, since 
endless variations exist or are possible. We will define an exact processor, which 
will serve as a baseline reference, and then describe several practical types of 
processors. The names used to identify them have been chosen somewhat arbitrar-
ily, since the names are not standardized. Examples of specific radars that use or 
have used some of these types of processors will be mentioned where appropriate. 
Most of the practical processors produce outputs essentially identical to those 
of an exact processor when operating on signals from a point target in the clear, 
not too far from the beam axis, at a high signal-to-noise ratio. However, they dif-
fer in their responses to large angular deviations from the axis and in errors caused 
by low signal-to-noise ratio, external interference, and unresolved targets, includ-
ing the special cases of multipath and single-target glint. Therefore, in analyzing 
or simulating monopulse performance under those conditions, the modeling 
should be based on the characteristics of the processor actually used rather than 
assuming an exact processor, as is often done. 
In the diagrams of the various processors only a single angle channel will be 
shown. Unless it is otherwise stated, it is to be understood that if monopulse is 
used in both angular coordinates, a corresponding processor must be added for the 
other coordinate. 
Two-coordinate monopulse normally requires three receiver channels. How-
ever, descriptions will be given of special forms of monopulse reported in the 
technical literature (although not necessarily adopted for practical use) that require 
only two channels or a single channel.

Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
8.1 
FUNCTIONS AND PROPERTIES OF MONOPULSE PROCESSORS 
The voltages on which the monopulse processor operates may be those of the 
component beams (for example, the squinted beams in amplitude-comparison 
monopulse) or the sum and difference voltages, usually the latter. The word “sum” 
is used here in a broad sense to include a reference voltage used in place of a sum. 
In designing a monopulse processor to operate on the sum and difference voltages, 
it makes no difference whether those voltages are obtained from an amplitude-
comparison or phase-comparison antenna, except that it may be necessary to insert 
a 90° relative phase shift (or interchange I and Q components) as explained in 
Chapter 5. It also does not matter whether the antenna uses a lens, a reflector, or 
an array. 
It is not always possible to draw a sharp line separating the monopulse pro-
cessor from other portions of the radar, since some functional components may 
overlap and share common hardware. The monopulse processor usually follows 
the receivers, but sometimes the receivers are part of the processing function. The 
monopulse processor in turn is often considered part of the signal processor. In 
some cases the monopulse processing is done by a computer, which also performs 
other radar functions. The monopulse processor is therefore identified by function 
and not necessarily by separate hardware. 
The monopulse outputs are a pair of voltages or digital numbers related to the 
two angular components of the target direction relative to the beam axis. The rela-
tionship is represented by a calibration function (sometimes called the “discrimi-
nator curve”) by which each monopulse output can be converted into a corre-
sponding angle estimate. 
The monopulse output for each angular coordinate is used in either or both of 
the following ways: (1) as an input to a servo that drives the antenna mechanically 
or steers the pattern electronically toward a null in the monopulse output, or (2) as 
an open loop indication of the off-axis target angle (with the appropriate scale 
factor or calibration function). In (1) the target direction is indicated by the me-
chanical shaft rotation angles obtained from synchro, potentiometer, or digital 
read-outs; or in the case of electronic steering the target direction is taken to be the 
direction of the beam steering orders. In (2) the target direction angle in each co-
ordinate is the sum of the corresponding beam-axis angle, obtained as in (1), and 
the angle of the target from the beam axis. 
One characteristic of a monopulse processor is of fundamental importance: 
the output should depend on the complex ratio (that is, the amplitude ratio or 
phase difference, or both) of the voltages derived from the antenna, not on their 
absolute magnitudes or phases. This characteristic is necessary in order to make 
the output dependent only on the angle of the target, not on its range or radar cross 
section. The process of obtaining a ratio (called normalization) is a nonlinear op-
eration. No processor does it perfectly. One of the main differences among various 
kinds of monopulse processors is the method and accuracy of normalization. Note 

 
Monopulse Processors

that the nonlinear nature of this essential step in obtaining monopulse outputs re-
quires that any Doppler filtering needed to remove clutter from the receiver out-
puts must be performed in the sum and difference channels before normalization. 
Otherwise the nonlinearity of the process will degrade the signal-to-clutter ratio 
relative to what would be obtained with linear Doppler processing. 
There are other properties of monopulse processors that usually are desirable 
and may or may not be essential, depending on the application. Among them are 
the following: 
1. The output for each angular coordinate should be an odd function of 
angular deviation (or sine-space deviation in the case of an elec-
tronically steerable array) from the beam axis. That is, equal target 
deviations to the left and right or above and below the axis should 
produce equal and opposite outputs. Since the property is inherent 
in the difference-to-sum antenna pattern ratio in most cases, the 
processor merely is required to preserve it. Lack of odd symmetry 
would cause difficulty in the closed-loop response characteristics, 
and would make open-loop calibration more complicated. 
2. The monopulse output should be very nearly proportional to off-
axis angle (or sine-space deviation) for small angles. Since this 
property is inherent in the difference-to-sum voltage ratio in most 
cases, the processor merely is required to preserve it. 
3. The processor should maintain its performance over a wide dy-
namic range of input signal strength. This property is important in 
applications where accuracy must be maintained while radar cross 
sections and ranges of targets may vary widely. 
4. The output for each angle coordinate should be as nearly indepen-
dent as possible of the target angle in the other coordinate. In prac-
tice the antenna often produces minor interaction or cross-talk be-
tween the two off-axis components. This may require two-
dimensional calibration. The processor should not contribute addi-
tional cross-talk. 
5. The angular error due to thermal noise should be as small as possi-
ble. Some processors have the smallest possible value of error, 
which is determined by the antenna pattern and the signal-to-noise 
ratio. Others have larger errors. 
6. The angular error due to external interference, multipath, or unde-
sired targets in the same resolution cell as the desired target should 
be as small as possible. Various types of processors differ in their 
errors due to these causes even though they may give identical out-
puts for a single target in a clear environment. 
For closed-loop null tracking, where the antenna axis is usually close to the 
target direction and angle estimates are obtained from the shaft rotation angle 

146 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
read-outs, relatively crude monopulse calibration suffices. This consists only of 
determining the monopulse slope and adjusting the servo loop characteristics ac-
cordingly to obtain proper dynamic response. If electrical correction signals (the 
residual monopulse outputs) are used to refine the angle estimates, the calibration 
must be more accurate but usually it still is within the linear range. In multifunc-
tion array-radar operation, targets may be one-half beamwidth or more off axis 
and the calibration must include the nonlinearity. 
One of the main problems in the design of a practical processor is normaliza-
tion, which means the division (or equivalent process) needed to produce the ratio 
|d|/|s|. Accurate normalization is especially difficult if the division is done by ana-
log processing. 
If normalization is done digitally, any desired accuracy can be achieved in the 
division process itself (except when s approaches zero), depending on the number 
of bits used; the accuracy is then limited by other factors, such as the analog-to-
digital (A/D) converters, amplitude matching of the receiver channels, and so 
forth. The signal strength may vary over tens of dB or even 100 dB or more, and 
maintaining the desired accuracy over such a wide dynamic range is one of the 
problems. Phase tracking of the receiver channels must also be maintained, since 
the cosine of the difference-to-sum relative phase is a factor in the monopulse 
output. Obtaining the desired accuracy of normalization imposes accuracy re-
quirements not only on the processor itself but also on the receivers, A/D convert-
ers, and any other devices that operate on the signals. 
8.2 
RANGE GATING 
In a pulsed radar the echoes from the target whose direction is being tracked or 
measured arrive at a time corresponding to the target range. All other ranges con-
tribute only noise, clutter, or unwanted returns from other targets. To enable the 
monopulse processor to reject extraneous echoes and noise and to operate only on 
echoes received from the desired target, a range tracking loop keeps a range gate 
(time gate) centered on the desired target. A gate whose width is matched to the 
transmitted pulse is used as a matched filter following a wideband receiver. When 
matched filtering for the pulse occurs earlier in the receiver, a short sampling 
strobe is used to create an effective range gate whose width is equal to the width 
of the receiver impulse response, and that width preceding the strobe can be con-
sidered as the “range gate.” Only signals from the receiver output during the gate 
are passed on to the monopulse processor. If there is AGC, it also responds only to 
outputs within the gate. The position of the gate provides measurement of target 
range. The range gating feature is not unique to monopulse but is needed in all 
angle-tracking pulsed radars.  
In radars with doppler processing, a “velocity gate” formed by a filter that 
tracks the target doppler shift provides resolution in that coordinate, replacing or 

 
Monopulse Processors 
147 
supplementing the range gate. The range gate is not needed in continuous-wave 
radar or in a passive (receive-only) monopulse system such as one used for receiv-
ing signals transmitted or relayed from Earth satellites. A radar that normally 
transmits and receives may also have a receive-only mode. For example, it has 
been demonstrated that a radar can track the sun passively in angle (for boresight-
ing) by using the radio-frequency radiation from the Sun [1, 2]. Military radars 
often have a “track-on-jam” mode for angular location of noise jamming sources. 
In such applications the signals are received in all range cells. In the following 
sections, where the term “range gate” is used, it should be understood that the 
discussion also applies to a velocity gate.  
With an electronically steered array it is possible to track several targets on a 
time-shared basis, since the beam direction can be switched almost instantly to 
each target in turn. Each target has its own range gate. With a reflector antenna 
only one target at a time can be tracked in angle, but it is possible to provide addi-
tional range gates, each with appropriate normalization circuits, in which other 
objects within the beam can be observed at the same time. From their monopulse 
outputs their angular positions relative to the beam axis can be measured. 
8.3 
ANGULAR COORDINATES FOR MONOPULSE CALIBRATION 
If the antenna has a planar aperture with constant-phase illumination (approxi-
mately true of the sum and difference in a reflector antenna) or uniformly tapered 
phase illumination (true of the sum and difference in an electronically steered ar-
ray), then the natural angular coordinates (that is, the coordinates in which the 
patterns are expressed most simply) are those denoted by α′ and β′ in Section 2.8. 
More specifically, the pattern equations are functions of Δu and Δv, defined by

In these equations, all angles are measured from “broadside” (the normal to the 
aperture). The subscript st indicates the direction to which the beam axis is steered 
in an electronically steerable array and the letters without subscripts refer to the 

148 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
target direction. In a reflector antenna the beam usually is not steerable relative to 
the aperture normal, so ust = vst = 0. 
In a reflector antenna that has a beamwidth no greater than a few degrees, it 
makes little difference whether the normalized difference signal is expressed as a 
function of the angle coordinates (α′,β′) or sine-space coordinates (u,v), since they 
are nearly equal. Angle α′ for this type of antenna is called traverse (or traverse 
“error”) and is approximately the azimuth deviation of the target from the beam 
axis, multiplied by the cosine of the target elevation angle. Angle β′ usually is 
called elevation “error,” although that name is not exactly correct; it is approxi-
mately equal to the elevation angle of the target from the beam axis when α′ is 
small and is exactly equal to that deviation when α′ = 0. 
In an electronically steered array, angles α′ and β′ have no standardized 
names, although they are sometimes loosely referred to as “azimuth error” and 
“elevation error” for lack of better names. Since the beam axis direction may dif-
fer widely from the aperture normal direction, the exact relations given in (2.25) 
and (2.26) must be used to relate α′-β′ coordinates to azimuth-elevation coordi-
nates. 
If the sum and difference patterns of an electronically steered array were plot-
ted as functions of the angular deviation from the beam steering direction (that is, 
α′ − α′st or β′ − β′st) the patterns would broaden as the steering angle increased; 
therefore, a different monopulse calibration function would be needed for each 
different steering angle. When the patterns are plotted as functions of sine-space 
deviation Δu or Δv, the patterns remain essentially invariant with the steering an-
gle except that both patterns decrease in amplitude as the steering angle increases 
(as a result of the element pattern). Since this applies equally to sum and differ-
ence patterns, the monopulse calibration remains essentially invariant with the 
steering angle. Thus the use of sine-space coordinates for monopulse calibration 
and target tracking provides a great advantage in electronically steered arrays but 
not in reflector antennas. 
8.4 
EXACT MONOPULSE PROCESSOR 
In Chapter 5 it was shown that depending on the type of antenna and comparator, 
the relative phase between the sum and difference signals from an off-axis target 
has a nominal value of either 0° or 90°, so that the ratio d/s is nominally either 
pure real or pure imaginary. The nominal value, however, applies only to a point 
target with no noise, clutter, multipath, or interference, and to a radar with no im-
perfections. It was pointed out in Chapters 3 and 5 (and will be explained further 
in Chapter 9) that in practice the relative phase between s and d is not confined to 
0° or 90° and that therefore the ratio d/s is complex in general. 

 
Monopulse Processors 
149 
To avoid having to deal separately with the cases of 0° and 90° nominal rela-
tive phase, we will assume hereafter that it is 0° (the reversal of the difference 
voltage on crossing the axis being treated as a change in sign of the amplitude 
rather than as a 180° phase jump). For radars in which the nominal relative phase 
is 90° it is only necessary to interchange reals and imaginaries (or sines and co-
sines) in the equations, or to introduce a 90° phase shift in the appropriate circuits. 
As will be shown in Chapter 12, it makes a difference whether such a phase 
change is introduced in the RF or IF portions of the receiver (but that does not 
affect the material in this chapter). 
Since it usually is not possible to predict the specific deviations of the relative 
phase from its nominal value under the variety of conditions of operation, the ra-
dar is designed for the nominal relative phase. 
We arbitrarily define an exact monopulse processor as one that produces the 
real part of the complex ratio perfectly for each angle coordinate. This does not 
mean necessarily that such a processor (if it existed) would be better, for every 
application, than an inexact processor or one designed for a different type of out-
put, but it serves as a reference with which practical processors can be compared. 
All monopulse processors are inexact to some degree because of equipment or 
alignment imperfections, finite dynamic range, and other limitations, or because 
they are designed for a different type of output. For some radars rough approxima-
tions suffice, permitting simplification of equipment and reductions in cost. 
The output of the exact processor is

where δ is the phase of the difference relative to the sum. The output is the magni-
tude ratio of the difference to the sum, multiplied by the cosine of their relative 
phase. In other words, it is the component of the difference that is in phase with 
the sum, divided by the magnitude of the sum. 
If it is desired to obtain the imaginary as well as the real part of d/s (that is, 
the quadrature-phase as well as the in-phase component of the normalized differ-
ence signal), a second monopulse processor can be added, using the same inputs 
but with one of them shifted 90°. If both processors are exact, their outputs form 
the complex ratio of d/s. The imaginary part is

The derivation of (8.7) and (8.8) was given in Chapter 3. 

150 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
The usual practice is to process the real part and ignore the imaginary part. 
The rationale is that the target contributes only to the real part while noise, inter-
ference, and clutter contribute equally to the real and imaginary parts. Hence, by 
using the real part only, the angular accuracy in the vicinity of the null is im-
proved by the equivalent of a 3-dB increase in signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, 
since the cosine factor changes sign on crossing the axis, it provides sense as well 
as magnitude of the angular deviation from the axis. 
The imaginary part, although not normally used, contains information that 
may be useful in certain special applications, particularly to detect the presence of 
unresolved targets or multipath and to reduce the resulting errors. Such possible 
applications will be discussed in Chapter 9. 
The fact that the exact processor, by definition, follows (8.7) exactly does not 
mean that it would yield the exact location of the target. The output is subject to 
errors due to noise, imperfections in other components or in calibration, and ex-
ternal causes. 
8.5 
PROCESSOR USING PHASES AND LINEAR AMPLTIUDES OF     
s AND d 
One obvious approach to monopulse processing, illustrated in Figure 8.1 for one 
angle channel, is to measure the amplitudes of the sum and difference signals at 
the outputs of linear receiver channels, measure their phase difference (or their 
phases individually, and subtract), digitize these measurements, then compute the 
monopulse output by (8.7). The relative phase δ in that equation is the difference-
voltage phase δd minus the sum-voltage phase δs. The imaginary part of d/s, if 
needed, is obtained the same way except that the cosine is replaced by the sine. 
This is a straightforward approach to an exact processor in concept but it may 
impose severe demands on the dynamic range of the receivers, A/D converters, 
 
Figure 8.1   Processor using phase and linear amplitudes of s and d. 

 
Monopulse Processors

and phase detectors in order to perform properly over the required dynamic range 
of signals. Furthermore, the mathematical operations indicated by (8.7), if per-
formed on every pulse, may place a sizable load on the computer, if many pulses 
are exchanged with the target. 
Dynamic range of monopulse receivers, mentioned briefly in Section 4.5, 
needs further explanation. A distinction is made between instantaneous and ex-
panded dynamic range. The instantaneous dynamic range of linear operation of a 
receiver is the range over which the output voltage remains proportional to the 
input voltage on each pulse. This dynamic range is inversely proportional to the 
bandwidth of the receiver and it depends also on the degree of care (and expense) 
devoted to the design. For typical receiver bandwidths of the order of a megahertz, 
a 60-dB linear dynamic range of IF output is well within the state of the art, and 
70 or 80 dB is achievable with very sophistical and painstaking design. However, 
the limiting factor in amplitude measurement is the envelope detector, which typi-
cally has a linear dynamic range of less than 30 dB. For some monopulse applica-
tions an instantaneous dynamic range of 30 dB or less is adequate, but other appli-
cations require linear operation on signal strengths that vary over a much larger 
dynamic range. 
An expanded (or total) dynamic range can be obtained by the use of auto-
matic gain control (AGC) or switchable attenuators, or both, to keep the signal 
level within the “window” of instantaneous dynamic range. Analog AGC is rela-
tively slow-acting and will cause errors in normalization when a target is off axis 
and is fluctuating in amplitude from pulse to pulse. Switchable attenuators are 
usually preferable. The problem is to know when to switch. If the target is being 
tracked continuously or during a dwell of several pulses, the amplitude of each 
pulse in the sum channel indicates whether the signal strength is approaching, or 
has reached, a point where switching is required. The switching is not retroactive 
to the pulse on which the measurement was made, so there is a possibility that the 
pulse preceding the switching will yield bad data. However, this is unlikely except 
perhaps on the first pulse of a dwell. The instantaneous dynamic range (without 
switching the attenuators) is usually adequate to accommodate pulse-to-pulse 
cross-section fluctuations of any one target at constant range.1 The attenuators are 
needed because of the increased dynamic range requirement imposed by the 
changing range of any one target and by different ranges and average cross sec-
tions of various targets. In continuous track on any one target the attenuators are 
unlikely to need frequent switching. 
However, in an electronically steerable multifunction array system that per-
forms interleaved track (and sometimes search) on multiple targets of various 
cross sections and at various ranges, there may be only one pulse or a few pulses 
                                                           
1  There are of course exceptions. For example a large, rapidly rotating cylindrical target can exhibit a 
very brief and very large specular “flash” as it passes through the broadside orientation with respect to 
the radar line of sight. 

152 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
during a dwell on each target, and the interval between dwells on any one target is 
longer than the interpulse interval in a radar that tracks a single target continu-
ously. Such a system cannot afford to risk bad data on the first pulse of a dwell; 
the normalization must be accurate on every pulse. One method of obtaining a 
quasi-instantaneous expanded dynamic range is to pass the sum and difference 
signals through equal delay lines before they enter the monopulse processor. 
Meanwhile the approximate amplitude of the undelayed sum signal is sensed and 
the attenuators are switched if necessary to place the signal within the linear dy-
namic range window. The attenuators in the sum and difference channels must be 
very accurately matched (or pilot pulses must be used to compensate for mis-
match) and the attenuator switching time must be shorter than the delay time. 
The computational load can be reduced in some applications by averaging the 
sum and difference amplitudes and their phase difference over several pulses be-
fore doing the computation indicated by (8.7). If the primary mission of the radar 
is to track the target in order to obtain data for refined postmission analysis, real-
time averaging permits an adequate data rate for tracking. Pulse-by-pulse post-
mission analysis then can be done provided the pulse-by-pulse data are recorded 
during the mission. 
Generally speaking, the phase-and-linear-amplitude approach is not the pre-
ferred method for accurate monopulse measurements over a wide dynamic range, 
especially if the radar must track rapidly fluctuating targets or perform interleaved 
tracks on multiple targets. For such uses other methods of processing, such as I 
and Q (Section 8.6) or phase and logarithmic amplitude (Section 8.7) should be 
considered.

where dI, dQ, sI, and sQ are the in-phase and quadrature components of the differ-
ence and sum signals at baseband. Figure 8.2 is a simplified diagram showing one 
angle channel. The I and Q components are obtained by mixing the difference and 
sum voltages with the output of a reference oscillator (local oscillator) at the sig-
nal frequency and also with a 90° phase-shifted output of the same oscillator. The 
four components are digitized and the calculations indicated by (8.9) are per-
formed by computer. The receivers are linear and the dynamic-range design re-
quirements are similar to those described in Section 8.5. The imaginary part of 
d/s, if needed, is obtained in a similar manner by using (3.20). 

 
Monopulse Processors 
153 
The absolute phase of the local oscillator that provides the common phase 
reference is immaterial. If it were changed, all four of the I and Q components 
would change but there would be no change in the computed real and imaginary 
parts of d/s indicated by (3.20) and (8.9). 
One advantage of I and Q processing is that it uses synchronous (phase-
sensitive) detectors, which are capable of a much wider dynamic range than the 
envelope detectors used in linear amplitude processing (Section 8.5). Another 
advantage that it has over phase-and-linear-amplitude (or log-amplitude) process-
ing is that the spectral content of the I and Q signals is confined to the IF band-
width, while that of amplitude, log amplitude, and phase can extend over a much 
wider frequency band, as explained in Section 2.7. For example, when the com-
plex envelope of the IF signal passes through a null, I and Q vary smoothly while 
the amplitude has a cusp, log amplitude goes to −∞, and phase jumps by 180°. 
Hence, channels that carry those three functions require wider bandwidth than do 
channels carrying I and Q, for comparable fidelity of reproduction. 
8.7 
PROCESSOR USING PHASES AND LOGARITHMIC  
 
AMPLITUDES OF s AND d 
This type of processor is similar to the type that uses phase and linear amplitude, 
except that it uses IF logarithmic amplifier-detectors for the sum and differences. 
An example of its use can be found in the Target Resolution and Discrimination 
Experiments (TRADEX) radar [3]. TRADEX is a reflector-type tracking radar 
used for phenomenology measurements. 
There are various forms of logarithmic amplifiers [4–7], all using some form 
of nonlinear circuit element either in the forward signal path or in a feedback path. 
It is possible to design a true logarithmic amplifier with IF output amplitude pro-
portional to the logarithm of the IF input amplitude [8]. For most radar applica-

154 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
tions, however, a logarithmic IF output is not needed, but rather a logarithmic 
detected (i.e., IF envelope) output. Although this can be obtained by putting a de-
tector after a true IF logarithmic amplifier, there is an easier and more stable de-
sign, which is called more properly a logarithmic amplifier-detector. 
The usual configuration of an IF logarithmic amplifier-detector is illustrated 
in Figure 8.3. It consists of a series of cascaded IF amplifier stages, the detected 
outputs of the individual stages being summed. Each amplifier stage limits at a 
certain level. If the limiting were abrupt, the final output would be a piecewise-
linear approximation to a logarithmic function; actually the limiting is not abrupt, 
and the corners of the linear segments are not sharp but rounded. The more stages 
there are, the more closely a logarithmic characteristic can be approached. It may 
be necessary to insert delay lines (not shown in the diagram) between the detec-
tors and the summing amplifier to compensate for amplifier interstage delays; the 
first stage requires the longest delay and the last stage none. 
Figure 8.4 is a simplified diagram showing how these devices are used in 
monopulse processing. A well-designed logarithmic amplifier-detector can have a 
dynamic range of about 80 dB with less than one decibel departure from a loga-
rithmic characteristic. In addition to increasing the dynamic range of the analog 
portion of the system, this type of processor extends the effective dynamic-range 
capability of the A/D converters, since each incremental bit represents a fixed 
number of dB rather than volts. 
The amplitude ratio of the difference to the sum is obtained, in concept, by 
subtracting the respective logarithmic outputs and taking the antilogarithm. In 
practice, since the devices are not perfectly logarithmic or perfectly stable, their 
input-output responses should be calibrated periodically and the computer should 
use the actual calibration functions rather than take the antilogarithm. In this way 
the error can be reduced to as little as 0.1 dB (about 1% error in amplitude ratio),

depending on the elapsed time since the last calibration. The phases are used in 
the same way as in the processor that uses linear amplitude. 
As a target approaches the null direction, the log of the difference voltage be-
comes an increasingly large negative number, which might appear to pose a se-
vere problem in dynamic range at the low end. However, since the ability to 
measure small signal voltages is limited by noise, the low end of the dynamic 
range need not be much below the average noise level.

Such a multiplying device, with associated filter, is called a product detector, 
a dot-product detector, a synchronous detector, or a phase-sensitive detector.2 The 
name dot-product detector is derived from an analogy with vector algebra. Let A 
and B be two vectors making an angle μ. Their “dot-product” (scalar product) is

which has the same form as (8.14). 
In order to make the output of a product detector, given by (8.14), equivalent 
to that of an exact monopulse processor, (8.7), it must be divided by |s|2. (The fac-
tor of ½ can be ignored, since the scale factor is determined by calibration.) 
Division by |s|2 is often accomplished by automatic gain control (AGC) de-
rived from the sum channel and controlling both the sum and difference channels, 
as illustrated in Figure 8.5. The AGC acts to keep the sum voltage at a constant 
amplitude, which we can call unity; in other words, the sum channel input to the 
dot-product detector is not s but s/|s|, which has unit amplitude and the same vari-
able phase as s. Since the same AGC also controls the gain of the difference chan-
nel, the difference-channel input to the dot-product detector is d/|s|. If now in 
(8.14) we replace d by d/|s| and s by s/|s|, and ignore the factor ½, we obtain as the

Hence a perfect dot-product detector with perfect AGC would be a form of exact

During the time between transmitted pulses both s and d are varying because 
of noise, clutter echoes, and target echoes. The rate of variation is determined by 
                                                           
2  It is sometimes also called a phase detector, but this name is ambiguous, since it can also mean an 
amplitude-insensitive circuit for measuring phase. The same device can be used for either function, but 
the method of use and the associated circuits are different.

the IF bandwidth, which in most cases is approximately the reciprocal of the pulse 
duration (meaning the duration of the compressed pulse if pulse coding is used). 
The circuits are arranged so that the AGC voltage is derived only from the sum 
signal within the range tracking gate after range lock-on has occurred. 
Ideally the AGC should act instantaneously so as to keep every sum pulse at 
exactly the same magnitude. In practice, the AGC usually has a time constant. If 
the target cross section varies during that time, as it often does, the AGC cannot 
follow the variation, and therefore the normalization (the division of |d| by |s|) is 
not perfect. Nevertheless, it is possible to maintain close track because when the 
target is close to the tracking axis, d is close to zero and the imperfect normaliza-
tion has only a second-order effect on the tracking-loop behavior. In other words, 
a modulated null is still a null. If, however, there is a dynamic lag because of in-
ability of the servos to keep up with high angular rates or accelerations, the d is 
nonzero and its modulation due to imperfect AGC and target amplitude scintilla-
tion causes an angular error [9, 10]. 
In deriving the equations in this section an instantaneous multiplier was as-
sumed. A perfect analog multiplier does not exist, but the same effect can be 
achieved or approximated by other nonlinear devices. For example, let s(t) and 
d(t) be added and then operated on by an instantaneous square-law device (not a 
square-law detector). The result is [s(t) + d(t)]2. Similarly, let s(t) and d(t) be sub-
tracted and then operated on by an identical square-law device. The result is 
[s(t) − d(t)]2. Now let the output of the second square-law device be subtracted 
from the output of the first. The result is 4s(t)d(t), which is the same as (8.13) ex-
cept for an unimportant scale factor. After filtering, the desired output is obtained 
as in (8.14).

AN APPROXIMATE DOT-PRODUCT DETECTOR 
The circuit shown in simplified form in Figure 8.6 is used as an “error detector” in 
some monopulse radars. It is not a true dot-product detector, but gives an adequate 
approximation to it under conditions normally encountered in a tracking radar. Its 
attractiveness lies in its simplicity. 
The device consists essentially of a pair of rectifiers arranged in a bridge. The 
inputs are normalized (by AGC) IF sum and difference signals s/|s| and d/|s|, 
which are added in the same phase on one side of the bridge and in opposite phase 
on the other side. The resulting voltages are rectified separately with opposite po-
larity and then added, so that the result is actually subtraction. The output of the 
device, denoted here by x′, is given by

The factor 2 on the left side of the equation (or ½ on the right side) is an arbitrary

Let x be the real part of d/s; this would be the output of an exact processor as 
defined in Section 8.4, meaning a perfect dot-product detection. Let y be the 
imaginary part of d/s. If desired, y could be obtained by another perfect dot-
product detector with one of its inputs shifted by 90°. Then complex d/s is ex-

Consider the idealized case y = 0 (a point target in the clear, with no noise, in-
terference, or clutter, no phase imbalances between channels, etc.). Assuming fur-
thermore that |x| ≤ 1, which means that the target lies between angular limits that 
usually approximate the half-power points of the sum pattern, (8.19) reduces to

in which the sign of the right-hand side is the sign of x. 
Figure 8.7 compares the output of the approximate processor with that of an 
exact processor, x, using as an example the antenna patterns of the AN/FPS-16 
radar modeled empirically by (6.8) and (6.9) and plotted in Figure 6.4. The dashed 
and solid curves are for the exact and approximate processors, respectively. Since 
all curves have odd symmetry about the origin, only the positive halves are 
shown. 
One pair of curves, labeled δ = 0°, is plotted for the ideal case discussed 
above, in which y = 0 and the relative phase between the sum and difference, 
δ = tan−1(y/x) = 0. For this case the two processors produce the same output up to 
the points where x′ = ±1. Beyond those points the output of the exact processor 
continues to increase (theoretically to infinity, but in practice restricted by the 
dynamic range of the equipment3) while the output of the approximate processor 
limits abruptly at x′ = ±1. The limiting effect is inherent in this type of “error de-
tector,” over and above any saturation that may occur in amplifiers or other com-
ponents. The angular region of operation before limiting occurs is approximately 
the sum-pattern beamwidth, which is adequate for most applications; it can be 
extended if desired by reducing the gain of the difference channel. Ordinarily the 
target is not more than one-half beamwidth off axis except perhaps during acquisi-
                                                           
3  Note, here and subsequently, that when the processor is implemented digitally in a computer, a 
division by zero may cause problems other than simple saturation of an analog circuit.

tion. If lock-on in acquisition occurs when the target is in the saturated region 
(less likely because the signal is weaker), the servo drive signal still has the cor-
rect polarity but the loop gain is reduced until the unsaturated region is reached. 
In general, the relative phase δ between the sum and the difference is not zero 
as assumed in the idealized case. For example, postcomparator phase imbalance 
between the sum and difference receiver channels causes a nonzero value of δ, 
which reduces x by the factor cosδ and introduces a y-component proportional to 
sinδ. The other two pairs of curves in Figure 8.7 are for illustrative phase imbal-
ances of 10° and 30°. The dashed curves for these cases were obtained by reduc-
ing the dashed curve for δ = 0° by the factor cosδ. The solid curves were com-
puted by (8.19), x being the ordinate of each of the respective dashed curves at the 
same abscissa and y being calculated by y = x tanδ. A 30° imbalance is larger than 
allowed by most monopulse radar specifications but easily can occur or be ex-
ceeded if a radar is not properly designed and maintained. A more typical speci-
fied value is 10°. When δ ≠ 0°, the exact and approximate processor curves are 
tangent on the axis but deviate elsewhere. The approximate processor output ap-
proaches an asymptotic limit equal to cosδ. For small angles the exact and ap-
proximate processors are essentially equivalent, but the phase imbalance causes 
both of them to have reduced tracking sensitivity (reduced slope) and to incur er-
rors in off-axis angle measurements, especially in the case of the approximate 
processor.

relative phase.

These curves illustrate one of the reasons why specifications usually require 
that the phase unbalance be kept low, even if a near-perfect processor is used. 
Another reason is that post-comparator imbalance in combination with pre-
comparator phase imbalance (manifested by a finite null depth in the difference 
pattern) causes a boresight shift (see Section 10.4.1). 
A nonzero value of y can be due to causes other than circuit phase imbalance. 
As will be shown in Chapters 9 and 11, it can be caused by unresolved targets, 
including the special cases of multipath and single-target glint. Unresolved targets 
not only introduce a quadrature component but also distort the in-phase compo-
nent. Under such conditions the relationships of x and x′ to each other and to the 
target angle are more complicated than in the case of circuit imbalance and cannot 
be represented by a simple family of curves like those shown in Figure 8.7, be-
cause as the antenna pointing direction changes, so do the relative illuminations of 
the targets in the resolution cell. 
However, the relationship between the exact and approximate dot-product 
outputs can be shown parametrically for any values of x and y due to any causes. 
Suppose a second device identical to the one described above were added, operat-
ing on the same inputs, s and d, but with one of them shifted 90°. Then just as the 
first device gives an approximation of the real part of d/s, x′ ≅ x = Re(d/s), the 
second would give an approximation of the imaginary part, y′ ≅ y = Im(d/s). Inter-
changing x and y in (8.19) we obtain

When x and y are both small, they are closely approximated by x′ and y′, but 
the deviation increases with increasing values of x and y. Figure 8.8 illustrates the 
distortion produced by this type of processing as compared with the outputs of 
exact processors, such as those using perfect dot-product detectors. Because of 
symmetry, it suffices to show one quadrant. In this figure y′ is plotted versus x′ as 
various constant values are assigned to x while y is varied (solid curves) and vice 
versa (dashed curves). If there were no distortion, the result would be a square 
grid. Note that x′, y′, and their resultant |x′ + jy′| cannot exceed 1, no matter how 
large x and y become. The distortion is unimportant in many applications, but if 
necessary it can be reduced by reducing the gain of d relative to s, thus reducing 
the values of x and y proportionately.

8.10 NONCOHERENT PROCESSOR USING SUM AND DIFFERENCE 
OF |v1| AND |v2| 
This type of processor, which can be used only in amplitude-comparison mo-
nopulse, forms the sum and difference of the voltages from the component beams 
after they are individually detected rather than at RF. Because it ignores phase, it 
is sometimes called noncoherent monopulse. One application of this form of mo-
nopulse processing is in a search radar transmitting a fan beam which is narrow in 
azimuth and broad in elevation, with two or more simultaneous receiving beams, 
narrow in both coordinates, stacked in elevation (the so-called stacked-beam 3-D 
radar). Each adjacent pair of receiving beams provides the v1 and v2 inputs needed 
for interpolation of target elevation between the beam-axis elevations. 
Consider a par of squinted receiving beams, as illustrated in Figure 5.13, and 
assume that the transmitted beam is wide enough to illuminate targets in both re-
ceiving beams. One could measured the amplitudes of voltages v1 and v2 obtained 
from the two beams after detection, calculate their ratio, and convert this ratio to 
the angle of offset from the axis by means of a known calibration function. But 
this ratio has a value of 1 on the axis; it lacks the desired property of being zero on 
the axis and having odd symmetry off axis. 
In the technique described here, the desired property is obtained by adding 
and subtracting the voltages after amplitude detection, and taking the ratio of their 
 
Figure 8.8   Relation between in-phase and quadrature-phase outputs of exact processors (x and y) and 
approximate dot-product processors (x′ and y′). 

 
Monopulse Processors

difference to their sum. A simplified block diagram is shown in Figure 8.9. The 
function indicated by the divider block in the figure can be accomplished by digi-
tizing the two inputs and using a computer for the division. An alternative method 
is to derive an AGC voltage from |v1| + |v2| and feed it back to control the gains of 
the v1 and v2 channels. In that case no actual division is needed, since the |v1| − |v2| 
voltage is in effect divided by |v1| + |v2| by the AGC, thus providing the desired 
output. 
The behavior of this processor is the same as that of an exact processor when 
the off-axis angle is not too large and v1 and v2 have their nominal relative phase 
of 0°. Let x and x′ be the outputs of the exact and noncoherent processors, respec-
tively. Then

Under the assumed conditions, therefore, the noncoherent processor has the same

When v1 or v2 is zero (a condition that occurs at roughly one-half the sum 
beamwidth off-axis), the processor output is unity. At larger angles, where either

v1 or v2 changes sign after passing through zero (i.e., goes into a sidelobe of a 
squinted beam), the behavior of the noncoherent processor is anomalous. The rela-
tive phase of v1 and v2 is then 180° and

Figure 8.10 compares the output of this processor (solid curve) with that of an 
exact processor (dashed curve), using as an example the antenna patterns of the 
AN/FPS-16 radar plotted in Figure 6.4 and assuming the nominal condition of 0° 
relative phase. The figure is plotted only for positive angles, since the curves have 
odd symmetry. Up to the point where x′ = x = 1, the two processors produce the 
same output. Beyond that point the output of the exact processor continues to in-
crease, theoretically to infinity but in practice limited by the dynamic range of the 
processor; on the other hand, the output of the noncoherent processor decreases. 
Thus, any given output is ambiguous, since it corresponds to more than one angle. 
However, in a null tracking system, in which the antenna axis follows the target 
closely, the ambiguity is not a problem. In the acquisition mode, even if lock-on 
occurs when the target is in the anomalous region, the monopulse output has the 
correct sign to cause the servos to drive the antenna in the direction of the null. 
The servo loop gain is reduced, but it regains its normal value as soon as the tran-
sition point (where d/s = 1) is crossed. Not unless acquisition occurred in the first 
sidelobe would the monopulse output have the wrong sign, which would drive the 
antenna away from the target, but acquisition in that region is unlikely because of 
the weak signal.

phase. 

 
Monopulse Processors

An advantage of this processor is that the receiver channels need not be 
matched in phase. On the other hand, amplitude (gain) imbalance between the 
channels causes a shift in the boresight axis, whereas this is not the case in receiv-
ers that operate on the sum and difference. The shift can be reduced by using pilot 
pulses to monitor the imbalance or by commutating (alternating) the inputs and 
outputs of the receiver channels. At angles well off boresight, this processor is less 
sensitive to amplitude imbalance that is a sum-and-difference processor. For ex-
ample, when either v1 or v2 is zero, one channel carries no signal and its gain does 
not matter; the ratio of the difference to the sum is unity despite the gain imbal-
ance. 
Even though the output of the noncoherent processor is insensitive to phase 
shifts in the receiver channels, it is subject to error due to external factors, such as 
multipath, which distort the amplitude and phase distribution of the arriving wave. 
A phase taper of the arriving wave across the aperture causes unequal amplitudes 
of v1 and v2. These distortions are explained in the Chapter 9. The exact processor 
also gives an erroneous output under these conditions but the errors of the two 
processors are not the same, since one depends on the coherent (phasor) sum and 
difference and the other on the noncoherent sum and difference.

, as shown in (2.3) and (2.4), any 
processing than can be done with v1 and v2, as in the preceding section, can also be 
done with s + d and s − d instead. This means forming s and d by an RF compara-
tor in the usual way, then combining them at RF or IF to obtain s + d and s − d, 
which are then processed. This may seem like a roundabout method compared 
with taking v1 and v2 directly from the feeds, but it is advantageous in some two-
coordinate monopulse systems, such as the one described in Section 8.14. 
Since the sum voltage exists at a point preceding the s + d and s − d hybrids, 
it is available for detection (acquisition). By connecting a duplexer at that point, 
the sum pattern is made available also for transmission. A noncoherent processor 
using |s + d| and |s − d| can be used in both amplitude- and phase-comparison mo-
nopulse, whereas the one using |v1| and |v2| described in the Section 8.10, is limited 
to amplitude comparison. To use this processor in phase-comparison monopulse, 
either d or s must be phase-shifted 90° before adding and subtracting them, since 
they emerge from the comparator in phase quadrature. 
Although a noncoherent processor using |s + d| and |s − d| is insensitive to 
phase imbalance in the receiver channels, it is subject to error due to phase imbal-
ance between the s and d channels arising from components between the compara-
tor output and the point where s and d are combined before entering the receiver. 
That path should therefore be kept as short as possible. Figure 8.11 compares the 

166 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
output x′ of such a processor (solid curves) with the output x of an exact processor 
(dashed curves) as a function of angle, again using as an example the antenna pat-
terns of the AN/FPS-16 as modeled by (6.8) and (6.9) and plotted in Figure 6.4. 
Three pairs of curves are shown, for a phase imbalance δ of 0°, 10°, and 30° be-
tween s and d before they are combined to form s + d and s − d. The pair of curves 
for δ = 0° is identical to the curves in Figure 8.10. All three dashed curves are the 
same as in Figure 8.7 since they represent the output of the exact processor. For 
δ = 10° the solid curve deviates only slightly from the dashed curve. For δ = 30° 
there is considerable deviation, and the slope of both the solid and dashed curves 
at the origin is appreciably reduced from its nominal value. 
8.12 PROCESSOR USING LOG |v1| AND |v2| 
In this type of monopulse processing the component voltages v1 and v2 go to re-
ceivers with logarithmic amplifier-detectors such as the ones described in Section 
8.7. In place of v1 and v2, the equivalent voltages s + d and s − d may be used. The 
logarithmic outputs are subtracted to produce the monopulse output. Figure 8.12 is 
a simplified diagram. The logarithmic amplifier-detectors may be considered part 
of the receivers but are drawn separately in the figure for clarity. 
The output can be written in mathematical form as

The output has the desired characteristic of odd symmetry, with a null on the 
axis. Since phase is not used, this is another example of a noncoherent technique.

Hence, except for the scale factor of 2, which can be included in the coefficient K, 
the output of this processor is approximately the same as that of an exact proces-
sor when d/s is real and small, which is the case for a point target close to the axis 
in a clear environment. 
To illustrate the action of this processor in another way, assume that the 
squinted beams have Gaussian patterns. (At small angles there is little difference 
between a Gaussian beam, a (sinx)/x beam, and a typical squinted beam all with 
the same beamwidth.) The Gaussian voltages are

Hence with the Gaussian squinted beam model and 0° relative phase this type 
of processor would produce a monopulse output, according to (8.36), which is 
exactly proportional to angle off axis. (The output of an exact processor with the 
same beam model would be a nonlinear function of angle, although nearly linear 
at small angles.) A truly Gaussian beam model is not physically realizable, and is 
used here only for illustration. Whatever the actual patterns are, this processor 
behaves essentially like an exact processor at small angles but deviates from it as 
the angle increases or when the relative phase is other than 0°. 
Figure 8.13 compares the output of this processor (solid curve) with that of an 
exact processor (dashed curve), using again the antenna patterns of the AN/FPS-
16 radar as an example and assuming exactly 0° relative phase. The fact that the 
curves differ is not important in itself, since it merely means that the two proces-
sors require different calibration functions for conversion of monopulse output to 
angle. However, when v2 = 0 (i.e., d/s = 1), at an angle a little beyond the half-
power point, the processor output theoretically becomes infinite, although in prac-
tice it is limited by the dynamic range of the circuits. At small angles, however, as 
in null tracking, satisfactory operation can be obtained.

This is to be compared with the output of an exact processor, which is simply x. 
The calculation of x and y under external conditions that disturb the nominal 0° 
relative phase will be discussed in Chapter 9. 
An advantage of this type of processor is that it does not require phase match-
ing of the receiver channels. Another advantage is that it gives instantaneous nor-

malization. A potential disadvantage is its susceptibility to boresight error due to 
gain imbalance between the receiver channels, but this error can be largely elimi-
nated by use of pilot pulses or by commutation of inputs and outputs of the re-
ceiver channels on every other pulse. 
8.13 PROCESSOR USING s ± jd 
In this technique the sum and difference voltages s and d are formed by the com-
parator in the usual way and then combined to form s + jd and s − jd, as shown in 
Figure 8.14. These two voltages are hard-limited to keep their amplitudes constant 
while preserving their phases. Their relative phase, denoted by 2φ0, is then mea-
sured by a phase detector.4 An optional additional step is to take the tangent of 
half their relative phase angle. Either the angle itself or the tangent can be used as 
the monopulse output, since they provide equivalent information with different 
calibration functions. For ease of comparison with an exact processor it will be 
assumed that the tangent function is used. 
The reason for hard-limiting the inputs to the phase detector is that otherwise 
the output would depend not only on the relative phase but on the amplitudes of 
the two inputs. The limiting of s + jd and s − jd makes their amplitudes constant 
while preserving their phases, and thus makes the phase detector output a function 
of their relative phase only. 
In Figure 8.14 it is assumed that s and d are initially in phase, as they are (un-
der ideal conditions) in amplitude-comparison monopulse using magic-Ts or other  
phase-preserving hybrids in the comparator. In the diagram, d is then phase-
shifted 90° to produce jd, and a phase-preserving hybrid such as a magic-T pro-
duces the sum and difference of s and jd. Alternatively, the 90° phase shift can be 
applied to s instead of to d. Still another variation is to use a quadrature hybrid (a 
                                                           
4 A phase detector must be distinguished from a phase-sensitive detector. The former responds to the 
relative phases of two inputs; the latter responds to their dot-product. Certain physical devices can be 
used for either function, but the method of use is different.

3-dB directional coupler, Section 4.4.2) in place of a magic-T and to insert the 90° 
phase shift in one of the outputs rather than in one of the inputs. 
This type of processor provides instantaneous normalization. It is especially 
useful in a radar system that is not dedicated to continuous tracking of a single 
target but must maintain interleaved tracks of several targets of different signal 
strengths. Under these conditions, automatic gain control is too slow to normalize 
the difference signal. Another useful feature of this processor is that it cannot be 
saturated by very strong signals (as some of the other processors can), since it 
amplitude-limits the signals. This type of processor was used in the missile site 
radar of the Sentinel and Safeguard ballistic-missile defense systems, designed 
and deployed in the 1970s. That radar was designed to perform a closed-loop track 
on one target while measuring the relative positions of several other targets within 
the same beam. 
Figure 8.15 illustrates the phasor relationships, assuming that s and d are ini-
tially in phase. The ±j factor rotates the d phasor ±90°. The phase angle 2φ0 be-
tween s + jd and s − jd is related to the normalized difference signal by the equa-

The subscript in the symbol φ0 is a reminder that (8.39) is correct only when d and 
s have 0° relative phase, in which case the processor acts like an exact processor. 
To obtain an angle estimate, d/s can be computed by (8.39) from the measurement 
of 2φ0, and converted to angle offset by a calibration function, or the calibration 
can be expressed directly as a relation between the phase-detector output and the 
angle offset.

Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
If the radar is designed for phase comparison instead of for amplitude com-
parison, or if the comparator uses quadrature hybrids, d and s are already in phase 
quadrature when they emerge from the comparator. In that case the processing is 
the same except that d and s are added and subtracted without the 90° phase shift 
shown in Figure 8.14. 
Instead of using both s + jd and s − jd, either one can be used in combination 
with s alone, since the relative phase between s and either s + jd or s − jd is φ0. 
The phasor diagram for that case is simply the upper or lower half of Figure 8.15. 
However, as has already been pointed out, the relative phase between d and s 
generally will deviate to some extent from the nominal value of 0° because of 
imperfections within the radar and because of external factors such as multipath. 
Let the actual phase of d relative to s be δ. Then in place of Figure 8.15, the 
phasor diagram is as shown in Figure 8.16. Let φ1 be the phase of s + jd relative to 
s and let φ2 be the phase of s relative to s − jd. Then

The output of an exact processor would be |d/s| cosφ or its equivalent, Re(d/s). 
These last two equations show that both tanφ1 and tanφ2 are different from 
the output of an exact processor (except when φ = 0° or 180°), one being larger 
and the other smaller, depending on the sign of sinφ. Therefore some form of av-
eraging generally will produce an output closer to that of an exact processor than 
will tanφ1 or tanφ2 alone. One form of averaging might be to measure φ1 and φ2 
separately and average their tangents. A simpler form of averaging, requiring less 
equipment, is the one already described above and shown in Figure 8.14. It con-
sists of measuring the phase angle between s + jd and s − jd, which is φ1 + φ2, and 
computing the tangent of half of that angle (that is, the tangent of the average of φ1 
and φ2).  
Figure 8.17 compares the output of the processor shown in Figure 8.14, 
namely tan[(φ1 + φ2)/2], and the output of an exact processor, as functions of an-
gle. As in the comparisons presented in earlier sections, the antenna patterns of the 
AN/FPS-16 radar modeled by (6.8) and (6.9) and plotted in Figure 6.4 have been 
used for illustrative purposes in making the computations. When s and d have the 
same phase, the two processors produce the same output, plotted in the curve la-
beled δ = 0°. When δ = 30°, the outputs differ, although not drastically. Curves for 
δ = 10°, plotted in corresponding figures for some of the other processors de-
scribed in this chapter, are omitted from Figure 8.17 because they are barely dis-
tinguishable from the curves for δ = 0°.

Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
In this type of system it is essential that the range gate be restricted to the re-
gion where the received pulse voltage is near its peak value. If there is any exten-
sion of the gate beyond this region, the amplitude-limiting action will cause the 
noise within that extension to be passed to the output at the same level as the sig-
nal plus noise during the pulse. Thus, if the gate is twice as wide as the signal 
pulse, the maximum effective signal-to-noise ratio will be unity even if the signal-
to-noise ratio during the pulse approaches infinity. This comment applies to angle 
measurement, not necessarily to detection and range tracking, which may operate 
on a separate sum channel not subjected to amplitude-limiting. 
8.14 TWO-CHANNEL MONOPULSE USING s + d AND s − d 
One disadvantage of ordinary two-coordinate monopulse is the need for three 
carefully matched receiver channels. Various methods have been proposed to re-
duce the number of receiver channels. Usually a sacrifice in data rate or in some 
other aspect of performance is necessary, but for certain types of use the sacrifice 
may be unimportant. 
A practical two-channel system has been described by Chuff, Huland, and 
Noblit [11], and further details and variations have been given by Noblit [12]. 
Besides reducing the number of receiver channels, this system provides “graceful 
degradation” by operating as a form of conical scan or lobe switching when one of 
the two channels fails. However, the data rate is lower than in three-channel mo-
nopulse at the same pulse repetition rate, and in certain versions of the system the 
S/N ratio is somewhat lower. 
Figure 8.18 is a simplified diagram of the basic version of the technique as 
described in [11]. The sum signal and the traverse and elevation difference signals 
are formed by a comparator in the usual way. The two difference signals are in-
jected in space quadrature (i.e., at orthogonal polarizations) into a microwave re-
solver consisting of a circular waveguide with a motor-driven hook-shaped probe 
at the other end rotating at an angular rate ωs. The resolver output is amplitude 
modulated by the probe rotation. This modulated difference signal, labeled dm in 
the figure, is proportional to the traverse difference signal dtr times the cosine of 
the rotation angle ωst plus the elevation difference signal del times the sine of that 
angle. 
The output of the resolver becomes an input to a hybrid junction, the other in-
put being the sum signal s from the comparator. This hybrid produces outputs 
proportional to s + dm and s − dm. Voltages s + dm and s − dm, still at RF, now go to 
separate receivers, the IF outputs of which are added and then video-detected to 
provide the sum signal for AGC, detection, and ranging. The AGC is applied to 
both receiver channels for normalization. 

 
Monopulse Processors 
175 
The IF outputs of the two receivers are also separately video-detected and 
then subtracted, thus canceling the sum signal and leaving only the normalized 
difference signal. 
The normalized difference signal at this point is a succession of pulses (or 
“boxcarred” pulses) with a sinusoidal envelope. The amplitude of the envelope is 
approximately proportional to the vector angular displacement of the target from 
the boresight axis and the phase of the envelope depends on the ratio of the tra-
verse and elevation components. This signal goes to a pair of demodulators (syn-
chronous detectors). The other input to each of the demodulators is a reference 
voltage from a voltage generator driven by the same motor that drives the rotating 
probe. The reference-voltage input to one of the demodulators is phase-shifted by 
90°. The outputs of the demodulators, after filtering, are the normalized traverse 
and elevation difference signals. Omitted from this diagram are steps such as box-
car generation, amplification, and filtering. The data rate is no greater than twice 
the rotation rate of the resolver. 
Some simplification can be gained by adding s + dm and s − dm at video (after 
detection) rather than at RF to obtain the sum signal for detection, ranging, and 
AGC, but there is a loss due to noncoherent addition. The amount of this loss de-
pends on the signal-to-noise ratio but is typically less than 1 dB.

176 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
In one variation of this technique, the microwave resolver is replaced by a 
switching arrangement that causes dm to cycle through the sequence +dtr, +del, 
−dtr, −del on successive pulses at the pulse repetition frequency. This “modulated” 
(switched) difference signal dm is added to and subtracted from s as in the basic 
method described above, to provide inputs to the two receiver channels. The out-
puts are added and subtracted to obtain the sum signal and the commutated differ-
ence signal. The latter is acted upon by another synchronous switch (the demodu-
lator) to separate the traverse outputs on pulses 1 and 3 from the elevation outputs 
on pulses 2 and 4 and to reverse the sign of the outputs during pulses 3 and 4. 
Thus, the traverse and elevation are obtained from alternate pulses rather than 
simultaneously. This type of system found application in monopulse radar such as 
the AN/MPS-36 and AN/TPQ-27. 
When the switched version of this technique is used in a four-horn monopulse 
system, the successive combinations of s + dm and s − dm are equivalent to form-
ing simultaneous receiving patterns corresponding to the left and right pairs of 
beams on the odd-numbered pulses and the top and bottom pairs on the even-
numbered pulses. Thus, the technique has some similarity to ordinary (non-
monopulse) lobe switching as described in Section 1.2, but with three important 
advantages over the latter: (1) the data rate is twice as high, one-half the pulse 
repetition frequency rather than one-fourth; (2) errors due to target amplitude fluc-
tuation at or near the switching cycle frequency are avoided; and (3) the transmit-
ting path (not shown in the diagram) is through the sum channel and therefore 
does not reveal the rate or even the existence of switching, unless mismatch within 
the comparator-resolver network allows modulation to leak into the sum channel. 
If the switching cycle can be detected by a hostile interceptor, it makes the system 
more vulnerable to jamming. In monopulse antennas using five or more horns the 
patterns of s + dm and s − dm are similar to those in four-horn monopulse, although 
the relationship to the patterns of the individual beams is somewhat more compli-
cated. 
The microwave-resolver version of the technique resembles conical scan, but 
with the same advantages as in the switched version (in this case the data rate is 
twice the scan frequency while in conical scan it equals the scan frequency). 
If one of the two receiver channels fails in either of the two versions, mo-
nopulse operation is no longer possible but the radar continues to operate in a 
lobe-switching or conical-scan mode on reception and to transmit the sum pattern. 
Since ordinary AGC is relatively slow, faster-acting alternatives can be used 
if the application requires accurate normalization on every pulse. One is to use 
AGC only to keep the signals within the dynamic range of the receivers, then digi-
tize the outputs of the two channels and perform the normalization (division) by 
computer. Another is to use logarithmic amplifier-detectors in the s + dm and 
s − dm channels for normalization, as described in Section 8.12, instead of linear 
amplifiers with AGC. 

 
Monopulse Processors 
177 
As explained in Sections 8.10 and 8.11, this system in any of the versions de-
scribed is insensitive to phase imbalance of the receiver channels.5 However, it is 
sensitive to the relative phase of the s and dm, as explained in Section 8.11. Hence, 
the signals s + dm and s − dm should be formed at the earliest possible point and 
the phase imbalance between s and dm preceding that point should be kept low. 
8.15 PHASE-AMPLITUDE MONOPULSE 
This technique [13] provides two-coordinate monopulse with only two feed horns, 
one hybrid junction, and two receiver channels. Two reflectors, positioned side by 
side in a rigid assembly, furnish phase-comparison monopulse in traverse. The 
feeds are placed a little above and below the foci of their respective reflectors, 
producing a pair of squinted beams that furnish amplitude-comparison monopulse 
in elevation. (The two coordinates could, of course, be interchanged by rotating 
the antenna assembly 90°.) 
Figure 8.19 is a simplified block diagram. The hybrid junction produces the 
sum and difference of the two feed-horn outputs. As explained in Section 5.4, the 
amplitude-comparison and the phase-comparison components of the difference 
signal are respectively at 0° and 90° phase relative to the sum signal. Hence, they 
are carried in a single receiver channel, ideally without any coupling between the 
two coordinates. The other receiver channel carries the sum signal. Normalization 
is accomplished by AGC or other means. 
                                                           
5  This statement is not exactly true if s + dm and s − dm are added coherently (after amplification but 
before detection) to obtain the sum signal; in that case a phase imbalance decreases the sum signal 
slightly.

178 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
The combined difference signal and the sum signal out of the receiver chan-
nels are then split equally to become inputs to two phase-sensitive detectors, one 
of the inputs having first undergone a 90° phase shift. The two phase-sensitive 
detectors provide the traverse and elevation monopulse outputs. 
To achieve the simplification offered by this type of system, certain sacrifices 
are necessary. Because of the smaller number of degrees of freedom available in a 
feed having only two horns, the tracking accuracy index (the product of sum volt-
age gain and difference slope; see Section 6.4) cannot equal that obtainable with a 
larger number of horns. 
Another disadvantage is that phase imbalance between the sum and difference 
channels causes traverse-elevation coupling; as a result, when the antenna axis is 
displaced from the target, the servos tend to drive it toward the target in a spiral 
rather than a straight path. Even without phase imbalance in the receiver channels, 
serious coupling can occur in a situation where the difference signal contains an 
appreciable quadrature-phase component due to external factors such as multipath. 
In normal monopulse, multipath reflections from the surface can make elevation 
tracking of a low-angle target erratic or even impossible, but traverse tracking can 
still be maintained with relatively little deterioration. In phase-amplitude mo-
nopulse, the traverse channel would respond to the quadrature-phase component 
of the elevation difference signal due to multipath, causing large errors in both 
angular coordinates. 
 
The description of phase-amplitude monopulse has been included here 
for historical completeness, since there appears to have been no application of this 
antenna and processing technique other than in the initial developments by Gen-
eral Electric Company in the 1960s. These included the experimental airborne 
radar described in [13] and a subsequent radar proposed for guidance of the Atlas 
ballistic missile.  
8.16 MULTIPLEXED MONOPULSE RECEIVERS 
One approach to minimizing receiver complexity and lack of accurate gain and 
phase tracking among the three receiver channels is to combine the sum and dif-
ference signals, either at RF or after conversion to IF, by time-multiplexing. 
Leonov and Fomichev [14, Section 7.6] discuss this approach, among several mul-
tiplexing methods. A simplified diagram of the RF-delay multiplexing system is 
shown in Figure 8.20. A delay is applied to d before summing with s at the input 
to the mixer. After amplification and detection, a compensating delay is applied to 
s before subtraction at the output. Normalization is performed by subtracting the 
two outputs of the logarithmic amplifier-detector, after they have been realigned 
in time. 
The authors note that the RF-delay method has two drawbacks: (1) targets 
separated by less than two pulsewidths cannot be resolved, as they will overlap as 

 
Monopulse Processors 
179 
a result of the time delay in the processor, and (2) the system is vulnerable to 
jamming from a pair of pulses separated by the processor delay. 
A similar process can be used with the first delay at IF, after downconversion. 
Mixers and IF preamplifiers must be duplicated (or triplicated, for a two-
coordinate system), but a single log amplifier-detector provides most of the re-
ceiver gain in a common path.  
Frequency multiplexing is another approach to minimizing receiver hardware 
and errors caused by poor gain and phase tracking. This approach is discussed in 
[14] and its application to homing seekers is described in [15]. In the seeker appli-
cation, where Doppler processing is required, a linear main IF amplifier, con-
trolled by sum-channel AGC, is used. Normalization results from the use of the 
common, gain-controlled main IF amplifier. Each channel must have its mixer and 
a bandpass amplifier-filter, but most of the gain comes from the main IF amplifier, 
whose gain or phase variations are applied identically to all three channels. The 
multiplexed output is separated using bandpass filters before being applied to 
phase-sensitive detectors to extract the two monopulse outputs. 
A similar multiplexing technique called the single-channel monopulse pro-
cessor (SCAMP) is described in [16]. The system actually uses three channels, 
frequency-multiplexed into a main IF amplifier and demultiplexed with bandpass 
filters. A simplified block diagram is shown in Figure 8.21, for a single angular 
coordinate. The sum and difference voltages are formed in the usual way and con-
verted from RF to two closely spaced IFs fs and fd by mixing with separate local 
oscillators, and are then summed and amplified in the wideband main amplifier 
followed by a hard limiter. The sum and difference signals are then separated by 
two bandpass filters tuned to their respective frequencies. 
It is shown in [17], using results of an analysis presented in [4], that when two 
signals at different frequencies are added and hard-limited, the bandpass-filtered 
output at the frequency of the stronger signal (the sum in this case) has a constant 
amplitude proportional to the limit level and independent of the original signal 
strength, and the bandpass-filtered output at the frequency of the weaker signal 
(the difference in this case) has an amplitude proportional to the ratio of the two 
original signal amplitudes. In other words, the limiting serves to normalize the 
difference to the sum. The sum voltage may be given additional amplification

before adding it to the difference voltage in order to ensure that it is always the 
larger of the two, within the usable portion of the beam. 
After the sum and difference signals are separated by filtering, the sum is 
converted to the same frequency as the difference (or vice versa) by mixing with a 
signal of frequency fd − fs derived by mixing of the two local oscillators. After this 
conversion the sum and difference have the same relative phase that they had at 
RF. The two signals are then applied as inputs to a phase-sensitive detector to ob-
tain the monopulse output. 
A cross-modulation problem in the SCAMP processor is discussed by Naval 
Research Laboratory engineers in [18], where it is pointed out that even though 
the spectra of the three input signals may not overlap, cross-modulation between 
these signals can manifest itself as a serious error in the directional information in 
the system. When the sum channel is assigned to the center frequency of the mul-
tiplexed combination, an intolerable level of cross-modulation between azimuth 
and elevation channels occurs in the limiter. The effect can be ameliorated but not 
eliminated when the sum channel is assigned to one of the end positions in the 
combination. Another caution from the NRL authors is that narrowband filters for 
each of the three IF channels (not shown in Figure 8.21) should be used prior to 
limiting, in order to minimize the effect of any broadband noise and interference 
passed through the RF circuits and mixers. This requirement implies that matching 
IF preamplifiers, preceding these filters, should precede the summing of the three 
channels shown in the figure, in order to minimize the effects of loss in the filters. 
Similar problems can be anticipated in other frequency-multiplexing processors, 
unless the main IF amplifier operates in the linear mode.

8.17 CONOPULSE 
Monopulse, in principle, is free of errors due to target amplitude fluctuation, but 
usually requires three receiver channels. Conical scan, on the other hand, needs 
only a one-channel receiver but is subject to errors caused by target amplitude 
fluctuation. 
A hybrid system called conopulse, which uses two receiver channels, has 
been proposed by Peebles and Sakamoto [19–21], who state that the basic concept 
goes back to 1958 or earlier but had received little attention in the prior open lit-
erature. It includes not only a special form of processing but also a unique method 
of two-coordinate angle tracking with only two beams. The authors describe and 
analyze different versions of the system. 
The same technique had been discussed in a 1964 Russian radar text [22, 
p. 537], under the name scan with compensation. It was discussed there as a pos-
sible alternative to “instantaneous amplitude comparison” (monopulse) as a means 
of reducing the error due to target fluctuation, and also providing immunity 
against jamming. 
One implementation suggested by Peebles and Sakamoto is shown in the 
simplified block diagram of Figure 8.22. The antenna produces a pair of squinted 
beams, from which a sum and difference are obtained. The difference signal is 
normalized by instantaneous AGC (IAGC) derived from the sum channel and act-
ing on both the sum and difference, and by a phase-sensitive detector having the 
gain-controlled sum signal as its other input. The pair of squinted beams is rotated 
about the antenna axis (for example, by rotating the feed assembly), causing the 
normalized difference signal to be modulated in accordance with the magnitude 
and direction of the angular displacement of the target from the antenna axis. A 
pair of phase-sensitive detectors extracts the in-phase and quadrature components 
of the modulation relative to a sinusoidal voltage at the scan frequency. These 
components indicate the two orthogonal components of target displacement from 
the antenna axis, and are used as inputs to the angle servos if closed-loop me-

Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
chanical angle tracking is done. The data rate is limited to that of the conical scan. 
This technique is seen to have some similarity to the microwave-resolver tech-
nique described in Section 8.14. 
The normalization made possible by the use of two simultaneous beams 
eliminates the errors of conventional conical scan due to target fluctuation (assum-
ing that the normalization is perfect). The advantages of conopulse over ordinary 
monopulse are the reduction in the number of receiver channels from three to two 
and the reduction of the feed from four horns to two, accompanied by simplifica-
tion of the comparator. On the other hand, the necessity of rotating the beam pair 
(preferably without polarization rotation) poses a difficult design problem. 
8.18 SUMMARY OF MONOPULSE PROCESSORS  
The monopulse processor operates on the voltages derived from the antenna to 
produce the normalized monopulse output. The voltages on which it operates may 
be those of the individual component beams, but usually they are the sum (or ref-
erence) and a difference in each angular coordinate. The sum and difference 
emerge from the comparator at a nominal relative phase of either 0° or 90°, de-
pending on the type of antenna and comparator. To avoid having to treat the two 
cases separately, we adopt the convention that the relative phase is 0°, with the 
understanding that if it is actually 90°, it can be converted to 0° by a phase shift or 
by an equivalent step in the processing. 
As a standard for comparison, an exact processor has been arbitrarily defined 
as one that produces an output described in various equivalent ways: 
• The real part of the complex ratio of the difference to the sum: 
Re(d/s); 
• The difference-to-sum magnitude ratio multiplied by the cosine of 
the difference-to-sum relative phase: |d/s|cosδ; 
• The component of the difference that is in phase with the sum, di-
vided by the magnitude of the sum: (|d|cosδ)/|s|. 
Alternatively, an exact processor can be used to produce the imaginary part of 
the complex ratio d/s (equivalent to |d/s|sinδ) if either the difference or the sum is 
phase-shifted by 90° before processing. Unless otherwise stated, however, the 
output of the exact processor is understood to be the real part. 
Various types of monopulse processors are in use. Some approach the per-
formance of the exact processor, limited only by finite dynamic range, quantiza-
tion (if the processing is digital), and imperfections in equipment performance or 
calibration. Others are designed to act like exact processors only when the imagi-
nary part is zero and the magnitude ratio |d/s| does not exceed unity. Still others 
produce an output that deviates from that of the exact processor under all condi-

 
Monopulse Processors 
183 
tions but approximates it closely enough when the off-axis angle is small and the 
imaginary part is zero. 
The choice among the processors depends on the type of use and the accuracy 
required of the radar. Generally speaking, the more closely a processor is designed 
to approach an exact processor the more expensive it tends to be and the more 
care it requires in design and calibration. In many radars designed for continuous 
closed-loop tracking of one target at a time, close to the axis, a simpler processor 
suffices. 
In analyzing or simulating the performance of a monopulse radar, the charac-
teristics of the processor used in that radar should be taken into account rather 
than assuming an exact processor. The difference can be significant if the target is 
not close to the axis or if there is a nonzero imaginary part of d/s due to unre-
solved targets, multipath, or misalignment within the radar. The responses to noise 
and interference may also differ. 
Table 8.1 compares the various processors described in this chapter with an 
exact processor. In this comparison, each processor is assumed to work perfectly 
in accordance with its basic concept; in other words, errors due to finite dynamic 
range, quantization, and imperfections in equipment, alignment, or calibration are 
ignored, leaving only those deviations from an exact processor that are inherent in 
the method of processing. All the processors that operate on a sum and difference 
can be used either with amplitude-comparison or phase-comparison antennas. The 
processors that operate on the amplitudes of the component beam voltages are 
limited to amplitude comparison. 
The processors listed in the table normally require three receiver channels for 
two-coordinate monopulse. In Sections 8.14 to 8.17 special techniques have been 
described that can reduce the number of channels to two, or even to one. Each of 
these techniques imposes either design difficulties or some sacrifice in perform-
ance, such as reduced data rate or signal-to-noise ratio. Of those techniques, the 
switched version of the one described in Section 8.14 is in practical use in some 
radars, the sacrifice in data rate being an acceptable trade-off for simpler design. 
The frequency multiplexing technique discussed in Section 8.16 has been applied 
to homing seekers, of which several thousand have been produced in the United 
States. The other special techniques do not appear to have found application. 
In selecting a monopulse processor design, compatibility with other signal-
processing functions in the system must be considered. If Doppler filtering is to be 
done, for example, it requires linear processing up to the point where the clutter 
has been filtered out. Therefore it is not directly compatible with monopulse pro-
cessors that include nonlinear operations such as logarithmic amplification or am-
plitude limiting. In order to do Doppler filtering in systems using such monopulse 
processors it is necessary to provide linear channels in parallel.

Chapter 9 
Response to Unresolved Targets 
In the preceding chapters it has been assumed that only a single target, confined to 
one point in angle space (or sine space) is present. Situations occur, however, in 
which the signals acted upon by the monopulse processor come not from a single 
target but from two or more unresolved targets. Even a single target may have 
multiple scattering points, which are equivalent to multiple unresolved targets. 
Multipath can also be treated as a special case of unresolved targets, in which the 
image or images produced by reflection from the ground or sea are equivalent to 
additional targets within the resolution cell. A jammer within the same beam as a 
target has the same effect as an unresolved target. 
When targets are unresolved, the radar produces a single angle indication 
based on the composite sum and difference signals. In general, the angle indicated 
by the radar does not correspond to the angle of any of the unresolved targets or 
scattering points. It wanders as the relative amplitudes and phases of the targets 
change because of amplitude fluctuation, relative motion, or other causes. Some-
times the indicated angle is even outside of the angular span that the targets sub-
tend at the radar. The errors can be large enough to cause loss of track. Similar 
effects occur in measurement of range and Doppler, but here we are concerned 
only with angle. 
Unresolved targets cause a change in the relative phase of the difference volt-
age d and the sum (or reference) voltage s, so that even if all other conditions are 
ideal (no noise, no equipment imperfections, and so forth) the ratio d/s is no 
longer pure real or pure imaginary, but complex. 
In addition to causing errors in angle measurement, unresolved targets affect 
detection, which the radar must accomplish before it can track. The strength of the 
sum signal fluctuates as the relative phases of the targets vary. Averaged over all 
phases, the combined power is the sum of the powers received from the individual 
targets, but part of the time the instantaneous combined power is less than that of 
the desired target alone. Detection probability may be seriously degraded. Since 

188 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
the effect of unresolved targets (particularly multipath) on detection is common to 
all radars and is amply treated in the general radar literature, it will not be pursued 
here. 
This chapter will first review the monopulse response to a point target, then 
analyze the response to two unresolved point targets (after defining “unresolved 
targets” more fully). The two-target problem is not uncommon in real life and 
both the mathematics and the physical concepts are readily manageable. For three 
targets, the mathematics of a deterministic analysis (i.e., one in which the posi-
tions, amplitudes, and phases of the targets are specified) becomes considerably 
more complicated, and for more than three targets it becomes impractical. How-
ever, the physical insight gained from the two-target analysis aids in interpreting 
the multitarget problem. For any number of targets, a statistical analysis with tar-
get amplitudes and phases as random variables can be performed, and this some-
times provides more useful information than a deterministic analysis. 
In the usual situation, the radar is tracking or attempting to track one of the 
targets, and the presence of another target (or source of radiation) in the same 
resolution cell causes errors in measurements of the primary target. A number of 
ideas have been proposed and investigated as ways to reduce these errors and pos-
sibly obtain information about the angular location of both targets. Some of those 
approaches are informative from a theoretical viewpoint but appear to have lim-
ited or questionable practical use. They are discussed in this chapter because they 
may be effective in certain special applications, or if not, it is useful to understand 
the reason. In any case, they provide insight into the fundamental limitation of any 
electromagnetic measuring system in a situation of this kind, namely distortion of 
the electromagnetic wave front arriving at the receiving antenna, as illustrated by 
an example in Chapter 5. An understanding of this topic is needed for error budg-
eting when specifying realistic performance standards for a proposed radar and in 
designing a radar to meet those standards. 
When the ratio d/s is complex, we can regard its real and imaginary parts as if 
they were due to a complex target angle, known as a complex indicated angle. The 
two parts are related to the phase and amplitude gradients, respectively, of the 
arriving wave across the antenna aperture. Certain techniques using both the real 
and imaginary parts have been proposed to detect “contamination” of the mo-
nopulse output due to the presence of unresolved targets, and to deduce further 
information about them. In theory it is possible to use the complex values of d/s to 
determine the locations of two unresolved targets, but there are practical difficul-
ties and limitations. 
The following assumptions are made initially to simplify the analysis. The ef-
fects of removing these assumptions will be examined later. 
1. The sum and difference voltages from a single point target emerge 
from the comparator at 0° (or 180°) relative phase, so that the mo-
nopulse ratio d/s is real. For radars in which the relative phase is 

 
Response to Unresolved Targets 
189 
90°(d/s is pure imaginary), the results are easily modified by inter-
changing reals and imaginaries (in-phase and quadrature-phase 
components) or by a 90° rotation when dealing with plots in the 
complex plane. The assumption that d/s is pure real (or pure imagi-
nary) applies only to a single target, not to unresolved targets. 
2. The monopulse processor is an exact processor as defined in Sec-
tion 8.4. That is, its output is normally the real part of the ratio d/s, 
but another identical processor can be added, with one of its inputs 
shifted by 90°, to measure the imaginary part also, if desired. Be-
cause of the variety of types of “inexact” processors, their responses 
to unresolved targets will not be presented, but the procedure for 
analyzing and computing their responses will be outlined. 
3. The normalized difference signal for a single target is proportional 
to its angle. The property of proportionality to angle is independent 
of the assumption of an exact monopulse processor. A typical re-
sponse of an exact processor as a function of angle can be seen in 
either the d/s curve of Figure 1.6 or the equivalent dashed curve la-
beled δ = 0° in Figure 8.7. Those curves are based on the patterns of 
the AN/FPS-16 radar but most monopulse radars exhibit a d/s curve 
of similar shape. The slope is generally not constant but increases 
somewhat with angle. For directions close to the axis, the on-axis 
tangent straight line gives a close fit. Over a wider angular region, 
say between the half-power points, the curve can be approximated 
by a best-fit straight line of somewhat greater slope, passing 
through the origin. In the operation of a radar for off-axis measure-
ments, the actual curve should be used unless the angles are small. 
However, for purposes of error analysis a straight-line approxima-
tion usually suffices. Should it be found necessary to use the actual 
curve, the results derived for straight-line response can be modified 
by a procedure described later in this chapter. 
4. The response in each angular coordinate is independent of the target 
location in the other coordinate provided that the amplitude ratios 
and relative phases of the returns from the individual targets are 
specified for the actual locations. This assumption is usually justi-
fied in error analysis even though coupling between the coordinates 
may require two-dimensional calibration in the actual operation of 
the radar. 
5. Noise and other sources of error (except the error caused by unre-
solved targets) are ignored.

Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
9.1 REVIEW OF MONOPULSE RESPONSE TO A POINT TARGET   
A point target is one that appears to the radar to be concentrated at a point in an-
gle space (or in sine space). It need not be confined to a single point in range1; 
however, if it has appreciable extent in range, rotation of the body may convert the 
range extent to lateral extent, so that it no longer appears as a point target. 
Most targets of interest have multiple scattering points. These are usually 
points of discontinuity of silhouette area, or its derivatives, as a function of range 
along the target extent. Discontinuities include leading and trailing edges. Gener-
ally the scattering points are not at exactly the same angle from the radar. Each 
scattering point makes its own contribution to the sum and difference signals, and 
the complete target therefore affects the radar in the same way as a cluster of un-
resolved point targets, causing angular wander known as glint (which will be dis-
cussed more fully in Chapter 10). Hence, most targets are not true point targets. 
As a practical matter, however, a target may be considered to be a point target if 
the angle that it subtends at the radar (in each coordinate) is small compared to the 
angular measurement errors of the radar due to other causes. At sufficiently long 
range every target looks to the radar like a point target. Although the amplitude of 
its echo may fluctuate because of interference among the scattering points as their 
relative phases change, the amplitude fluctuation does not affect angle measure-
ments by a monopulse radar. 
In accordance with the assumptions made above, the monopulse output in ei-
ther angular coordinate (traverse or elevation), in the absence of noise or other 
sources of error, is 
 
m
d
k
s =
θ  
(9.1) 
where d/s is the normalized difference signal in the selected coordinate, θ is the 
angle off axis in that coordinate expressed in beamwidths (of the sum beam), and 
km is the slope of the monopulse response curve versus angle in the same coordi-
nate, expressed in volts per volt per beamwidth (see Section 6.4). The choice of 
the beamwidth as the unit of angle is convenient because then km has roughly the 
same value (≈1.6) in many monopulse radars. The values of km in the two coordi-
nates need not be equal, but they are usually close. In making computations for a 
particular radar, absolute angular units (degrees or milliradians) may be substi-
tuted provided angle and slope are in consistent units. 
The radar produces the monopulse ratio d/s and divides it by the known slope 
km to obtain the indicated angle, denoted by θi:

the present context the term refers only to angle.

which means that the radar is designed to yield an indicated angle equal to the 
actual geometric angle of a single target under ideal conditions. 
9.2 THE MEANING OF UNRESOLVED TARGETS 
There is no need in this book for a general definition of resolution, various ver-
sions of which are in existence. Instead we need merely define what is meant here 
by unresolved targets in the specific context of angle measurement: targets are 
unresolved if an angle measurement cannot be made on each target without sig-
nificant error due to the presence of others. “Significant error” can be defined by 
quantitative criteria where needed. To be resolved, the targets must be sufficiently 
separated in at least one coordinate (traverse, elevation, range, or Doppler) to 
make their interference with each other’s measurements negligible. 
Note that in order to be unresolved, targets must be closely spaced in all co-
ordinates, not just angle. As a rule of thumb, targets are often called unresolved if 
they are within the same resolution cell having nominal dimensions of the beam-
width, the pulse length, and the Doppler filer bandwidth (if Doppler is used); but 
they may cause mutual interference and therefore be unresolved in the sense de-
fined here even if their separations are greater, since resolution cells with sharp 
boundaries are fictitious. Even if they are sufficiently separated to be recognized 
and measured by the radar as individual targets, there may be enough overlap to 
cause errors in the angle measurements. In the usual case, however, the radar fails 
to recognize that there is more than one target in the cluster, and reports a detec-
tion and a set of measurements as if there were only one target. 
Resolvability depends of course not only on the targets, but on the character-
istics of the radar, including the type of processing. 
9.3 SUPERPOSITION AS AN APPROXIMATION 
It is commonly assumed that superposition applies to the electromagnetic fields 
scattered by multiple targets, but strictly speaking that is not true; in solving a 
boundary-value problem it is not correct simply to add the electromagnetic fields 
obtained by considering one part of the boundary (that is, one target) at a time, as 
if the others were not present. The incident field at each target is modified by the 
scattered fields from the other targets. A less rigorous but easier way of expressing 
the same idea is in terms of “multiple-bounce” reflections (from one target to an-
other, one or more times, then back to the radar). 

192 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
However, in most practical situations with which we are concerned, the mul-
tiple-bounce contributions are negligible and we can assume that superposition 
applies. The following example will illustrate the fact that the error in this as-
sumption is typically very small, although it can be significant under some un-
usual conditions. 
Consider two isotropic targets (targets that radiate or scatter an incident plane 
wave uniformly in all directions). Let their radar cross sections be σa and σb and 
let their separation be Rab. The transmitted radar power captured and reradiated by 
the first target is proportional to σa. Similarly, the transmitted radar power cap-
tured and reradiated by the second target is proportional to σb; of this power, the 
first target captures and reradiates a fraction σa/(4πRab
2). Hence, the ratio of dou-
ble-bounce power (radar to second target to first target to radar) to single-bounce 
power (radar to first target to radar) that the first target reradiates back to the radar 
is

(9.3) 
For a numerical example, let σb = 1 m2 and Rab = 10m. Then the double-
bounce power is 31 dB below the single-bounce power, making it negligible for 
most applications. 
For a particular instantaneous geometry it is the electromagnetic fields, not 
the powers, that are additive. Thus in this example the ratio of the double-bounce 
field to the single-bounce field, equal to the square-root of the power ratio in (9.3), 
is 0.028, and the relative phase may have any value, depending on the positions of 
the two bodies. The resultant power may therefore be larger or smaller than the 
single-bounce power alone. Averaged over all possible phases, however, the resul-
tant power is the sum of the two individual powers. Hence, the average apparent 
cross section of the first target is increased by the factor 1.0008 by the double-
bounce contribution. 
In a similar manner, we can compute the triple-bounce power contribution 
(radar to first target to second target to first target to radar) as a fraction of the 
double-bounce contribution. This fraction is σa/(4πRab
2), which will usually be an 
insignificant correction to the already negligible double-bounce contribution. 
Since the designations “first target” and “second target” are arbitrary, the 
same type of analysis applies to the other target if σa and σb are interchanged. 
While this method of rough calculation is intended only for an order-of-
magnitude illustration, it gives results that are in reasonable agreement with the 
results of a more rigorous analysis of the radar backscatter from two unresolved 
spheres [1]. If the radar cross section of each of two unresolved targets is much 
smaller than the square of the distance between them (say, by a factor of 100), 
then multiple-bounce effects can be ignored and superposition can be assumed. 
This is the usual situation in two-target problems, and our analysis will therefore 

 
Response to Unresolved Targets 
193 
be based on superposition. This means that the resultant signal voltages received 
from two or more unresolved targets are calculated by phasor addition of the volt-
ages that would have been received from the individual targets if the others were 
not there. 
However, one should be aware that superposition applied to multiple radar 
targets is only an approximation, which should be used with caution if the square 
of the distance between two targets is not much larger than the radar cross section 
of the larger target. 
9.4 THE TWO-TARGET PROBLEM 
In the single-target case the sum and difference voltages s and d are in phase and 
the normalized difference signal d/s is real. In the case of unresolved targets, how-
ever, s and d may have any relative phase and their ratio is therefore complex. 
To demonstrate this fundamental point in a simple way [2, 3], consider two 
unresolved targets at different angles within the beam and confine attention to one 
angular coordinate at a time. In the phase diagram, Figure 9.1, sa and da are the 
monopulse sum and difference signals from the first target, and sb and db the cor-
responding signals from the second target. Though the two targets are in the same 
range resolution cell, in general their ranges are not exactly equal and there will be 
some phase difference between sa and sb. Even if the ranges are equal, there may 
be a phase difference because of different backscatter phase characteristics of the 
two targets. The total sum signal is the resultant s. Suppose, for illustration, that 
the two targets are on opposite sides of the beam axis, the first target being on the 
side that causes da to be in phase with sa; then db is in phase opposition to sb. The 
total difference signal d is the resultant of da and db. 
It is clear from Figure 9.1 that, in general, d has a component in phase quad-
rature with s, shown by the dashed line, as well as an in-phase component. In 
other words, the ratio d/s is complex. It is easy to see also that if sa and sb are 180° 
 
Figure 9.1   Sum and difference phasors for two unresolved targets. 

194 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
out of phase and nearly equal in magnitude, the ratio d/s can become very large. 
The foregoing result is not confined to cases where the two targets lie on opposite 
sides of the beam axis—it is quite general. 
To express the result mathematically, let θa and θb be the angular displace-
ments of the two targets from the axis in the selected coordinate. Then from (9.1)

This equation says that the indicated angle θi is a weighted average of the actual 
angles of the targets, with weighting proportional to their respective sum-signal 
contributions. However, the weighting is complex, since sa and sb have difference 
phases in general, and the end result is not readily apparent without further analy-
sis.

where 
p = gr = amplitude ratio of sum-signal returns from the two targets; 
g = ratio of antenna sum-pattern voltage gains in the directions of the two tar-
gets; 
r = ratio of backscatter voltage coefficients of the two targets (the square root 
of the ratio of their radar cross sections); 
φ = relative phase of the sum-signal returns from the two targets. 
The ratios g and r and the relative phase φ are arbitrarily defined to refer to 
the second target (at angle θb) relative to the first (at angle θa), not vice versa. The 
quantity g means the two-way voltage gain ratio in the usual case of passive radar 
targets. In the case of active sources or beacons, g refers to the one-way voltage

Since (9.8a), (9.8b), and (9.8c) are all equivalent, they will be referred to collec-
tively as (9.8) except when a distinction among the three versions is being made. 
The choice of the particular version to be used is a matter of convenience of 
analysis, computation, or plotting in each case. 
9.5 THE COMPLEX INDICATED ANGLE 
The quantity θi on the left-hand side of (9.8) has been named the complex indi-
cated angle or simply the complex angle [2, 3]. When p = 0 (second target re-
moved), the right-hand side of the equation reduces to θa and the indicated angle 
equals the geometric angle, as expected. When p is infinite (first target removed), 
the indicated angle reduces to θb. When θa = θb (both targets at the same angle in 
the coordinate under consideration), the indicated angle equals the geometric an-
gle regardless of the amplitudes and phases of the two targets. However, in gen-
eral the indicated angle is a complex quantity. 
Since the monopulse processor is normally designed to extract only the real 
part of the indicated angle, the usual method of analysis of the two-target problem 
is to deal only with the real part of (9.8). This is obtained by multiplying numera-
tor and denominator of the fraction in the appropriate version of (9.8) by 1 + pe−jφ 
(remembering that e±jφ = cosφ ± j sinφ), and then collecting the real terms on the 
right-hand side. The results can be expressed in various equivalent forms. Starting

The mathematical expressions are more compact when written in complex 
form. Any one of the three versions of the complex equation (9.8) is equivalent to 
a pair of equations composed of one part of the versions of (9.9) for the real part 
and (9.10) for the imaginary part. Although decomposition into real and imaginary 
parts becomes necessary when numerical computations are needed, the complex 
form often facilitates mathematical operations and plotting. It also facilitates 
analysis of the effects of imperfections such as amplitude and phase imbalances in 
the radar equipment. 
To examine the nature of the complex indicated angle as a function of the tar-
get parameters, define the auxiliary quantity w:

(9.13) 
Both θi and w are complex. If θa and θb are held constant, (9.13) shows that θi 
is composed of a linear function of w divided by another linear function of w. In 
the theory of functions of a complex variable this is known as a bilinear transfor-
mation of w, and it has the property (see any textbook on functions of a complex 
variable) that straight lines and circles in the w-plane are transformed into straight 
lines and circles in the θi-plane. The straight lines occur as special cases, equiva-
lent to circles of infinite radius. 
If the relative phase φ of the two targets is varied while their amplitude ratio p 
and their angles θa and θb are held constant, w traces out a circle of radius p cen-
tered on the origin in the w-plane, and the bilinear transformation transforms this 
into a circle in the θi-plane. Different values of p produce a family of circles in the 
θi-plane. 
The circles for several values of the amplitude ratio p are drawn in solid lines 
in Figure 9.2. The figure has been normalized by putting the origin at the midpoint 
of θa and θb and taking θa − θb as the unit of angle. In other words, the complex 
quantity being plotted is a normalized indicated angle θin, which can be written, 
with the aid of (8.8b), as 
 
Normalized so that origin is at angular midpoint and unit of angle is 
angular separation of the targets. First target at A, second target at B.

The arbitrary choice of the negative sign before Δθ is convenient for plotting. 
These curves are easy to plot, once it is recognized that they must be circles 
and that their centers must lie on the real axis because the substitution of −φ for φ 
reverses the sign of the imaginary part without affecting the real part. The two 
points of intersection of each circle with the real axis are easily calculated by sub-
stituting φ = 0 (left intersection) and φ = π (right intersection). To plot each circle, 
take the midpoint between the two intersections as the center and half the distance 
between them as the radius. The same circles could be obtained (but with much 
more labor) by plotting Im(θi) versus Re(θi) point by point with φ as the implicit 
variable, using (9.9) and (9.10). 
The circles for p < 1 lie on the side closer to the first target (the one desig-
nated by the subscript a). The circles for p > 1 lie on the side closer to the second 
target. Reciprocal values of p produce pairs of circles that are symmetrical with 
respect to the imaginary axis. The circle for p = 1 degenerates into the imaginary 
axis. The circles for p = 0 and ∞ degenerate into points A and B representing the 
first and second target, respectively. If φ varies at a uniform rate, the motion of the 
corresponding point on the θin circle is not uniform; it is slow when φ is near 0° 
and rapid when φ is near 180°. 
If the amplitude ratio p is varied while the relative phase angles are held con-
stant, w traces out a straight line in the w-plane, which transforms into a circle in 
the θi-plane (or θin-plane). Different values of φ produce a family of constant-φ 
circles, orthogonal to the constant-p family. These are drawn as broken circles in 
Figure 9.2. Each broken circle is composed of two arcs, one above the real axis 
and the other below, differing in phase by 180°. For φ = 0° the arc (of infinite ra-
dius) is the part of the real axis between A and B, and for 180° it is the remainder 
of the real axis. 
It must be remembered that Figure 9.2 pertains to a single angle coordinate. If 
that coordinate is traverse, the vertical coordinate in the figure represents the 
imaginary part of the indicated traverse angle, not the indicated elevation angle. 
The same set of normalized curves would apply also to elevation. 
If the amplitude ratio, the relative phase, and the angles of the two targets 
relative to the beam axis are known, Figure 9.2 can be used to read off the com-
plex indicated angle in the following manner. Normalize the scale by letting unit 
distance on the real and imaginary axes represent the angular separation of the two 
targets in the coordinate under consideration. Shift the origin to the left or right 
until the distances from the origin to points A and B representing the first and sec-
ond targets equal their respective normalized angles from the axis. The intersec-
tion of the appropriate p circle and φ circle is the value of the complex indicated 

 
Response to Unresolved Targets

angle in normalized form. To remove the normalization, multiply by the angular 
separation of the two targets. 
If d/s is linear with angle as assumed, a shift in beam pointing angle relative 
to the two targets would mean simply a horizontal shift of the origin by a corre-
sponding amount in Figure 9.2 if p remained constant. The fact is, however, that 
as the beam direction changes, there is a change in the sum-pattern voltage-gain 
ratio g defined under (9.7), causing a change in p. Therefore the correct value of p 
for the actual beam position must be used. 
Figure 9.3 shows plots of Re(θin), the real part of the normalized indicated 
angle, as a function of φ for different values of p, computed by (9.9b) and normal-
ized by (9.14). The form of these curves could have been visualized by examina-
tion of Figure 9.2. Since the curves are symmetrical about 180°, only the left 
halves are shown. 
Equation (9.9b) and Figure 9.3 are the same as equations and curves derived 
or reproduced in various papers and books in the radar literature (see, for example, 
[4, p. 87; 5, p. 169]). It is interesting to note that the families of curves have a 
simpler form (circles) when plotted in the complex plane. The complex plots also 
help to visualize the effect of phase imbalance between the sum and difference 
channels due to imperfections in the radar. The effect is a rotation of Figure 9.2 
about a point representing the axis, by an angle equal to the phase imbalance, 
causing coupling between the real and imaginary parts.

Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
By setting Re(θi) > θa in (9.9c), it is found that the fraction of the time that the 
indicated angle lies outside of the angular span of the two targets is (cos−1p)/π. For 
example, if p = 0.5, the fraction is 1/3. 
It is emphasized that Figures 9.2 and 9.3, and the equations on which they are 
based, represent open-loop monopulse response, obtained when the antenna axis is 
held fixed. In the normal closed-loop tracking mode, the antenna beam moves in 
order to null out the real part of the indicated angle. As it does so, the amplitude 
ratio of the targets changes. Closed-loop response will be discussed in a later sec-
tion. 
9.6 PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION 
It has been stated [6] that any tracking radar, not only monopulse, tends to align 
its axis in the direction of the normal to the phase front. This is a useful rule if 
properly interpreted and qualified. In monopulse terms, it means that the real part 
of the indicated angle in each angular coordinate becomes zero when the antenna 
aperture plane2 is aligned with the arriving phase front. This is true in the case of a 
plane wave, as from a distant point target. However, unresolved targets distort the 
arriving phase front, making it nonplanar, and also cause amplitude variations 
over the phase front. It is not possible to align the aperture plane with a nonplanar 
phase front. The sum and difference signals result from integration of the phasor 
contributions (amplitude and phase) of the arriving wave to each element of area 
of the aperture, weighted by the aperture illumination functions of the sum and 
difference patterns respectively. A tracking radar therefore tends to align its axis 
with the normal to the “weighted-average” phase front, and this is generally not 
the same as the normal to the actual phase front at the center of the aperture. Two 
monopulse tracking radars, one amplitude comparison and the other phase com-
parison, will align their axes with the normals to their respective weighted-average 
phase fronts, but the two directions may differ somewhat because of the difference 
in the aperture illumination functions. 
When the axis points in the direction that nulls the real part of the indicated 
angle, there remains in general an imaginary part. 
When the axis points in other than the null direction, both the real and imagi-
nary parts of the indicated angle depend in a rather complicated way on the ampli-
tude and phase distribution of the arriving wave across the aperture [2, 7]. How-
ever, two special cases of arriving wave are easy to analyze [7] if it is assumed 
that the sum and difference illumination functions have constant phase over the 
aperture: 
                                                           
2  In an electronically steerable array, the aperture plane in this context is interpreted as the “steered 
plane” rather than the plane of the physical array. 

 
Response to Unresolved Targets

1. Uniform amplitude, linear phase taper (tilted plane wave): The in-
dicated angle is pure real and equal to the angle of the normal to the 
phase front. 
2. Constant phase (plane phase front normal to beam axis): linear am-
plitude taper: The indicated angle is imaginary and proportional to 
the amplitude taper normalized to the amplitude at the center. 
In these two special cases, the real part of the indicated angle is due to phase 
taper and the imaginary part is due to amplitude taper. In general, however, the 
two effects are not separable; the real and imaginary parts depend on both the 
phase and amplitude distributions of the arriving wave, and these are functions of 
the off-axis angles, amplitudes, and phases of the unresolved targets. 
Although an exact processor ideally responds only to the real part, phase im-
balance between the radar sum and difference channels causes some of the imagi-
nary part to couple into the real part and thus affect the monopulse output. Imbal-
ance occurs to some degree not only in receivers but also in antenna patterns. In a 
reflector-type amplitude-comparison antenna, for example, the sum and difference 
patterns have slightly different phase centers [8] and their illumination functions 
do not have exactly constant phase over the aperture; although the effect is negli-
gible for targets near the axis, it may cause significant distortion of the relative 
phase when one or the both targets are near or beyond the edge of the beam. 
The imaginary part is also of interest because some types of monopulse proc-
essors, as explained in Chapter 8, do not respond purely to the real part of d/s but 
to a nonlinear combination of real and imaginary parts. Both parts should be taken 
into account when analyzing performance on unresolved targets. 
9.7 MEASUREMENT OF THE IMAGINARY PART (QUADRATURE-
PHASE) COMPONENT 
Since an exact processor, as defined in Section 8.4, responds to the component of 
the difference signal that is in phase with the sum signal and measures the real 
part of the indicated angle, the imaginary part can be measured by another exact 
processor. For example, if the real part is obtained from a dot-product detector as 
described in Section 8.8, the imaginary part can be obtained from another dot-
product detector in parallel with the first, with the same inputs except that one of 
them (sum or difference) is phase-shifted 90°. To measure the real and imaginary 
parts in both angular coordinates, four such processors would be needed. If the 
processor is of a type that uses a computer to obtain Re(d/s) from measurements 
of amplitude and phase of the sum and difference signals (see Section 8.5 or 8.7), 
the imaginary part is obtained without additional hardware by replacing cosines 
by sines in the computations. If the processor computes the real part from I and Q 
measurements by (8.9), it can also compute the imaginary part by (3.20). 

202 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
Although an exact processor is an idealization, some of the practical proces-
sors described in Chapter 8 approach the performance of an exact processor, lim-
ited only by finite dynamic range and by errors due to equipment imperfections, 
quantization, and calibration. 
The theoretical circular plots shown in Figure 9.2 have been verified experi-
mentally. In one experiment a monopulse radar was modified with an extra dot-
product detector to measure the traverse quadrature output in addition to the in-
phase output. The outputs of the two processors were connected to the inputs of an 
X-Y plotter. Two beacon horn antennas were attached to the top of a boresight 
tower, at the same elevation but separated in traverse by a fraction of the radar 
beamwidth. The horns were pointed toward the radar and pulsed by a signal gen-
erator, with pulse synchronization obtained from the radar. A variable phase 
shifter and variable attenuator were inserted in the line to one of the beacon anten-
nas. The radar was allowed to lock onto the beacon pulses in range but the antenna 
was fixed, with the servos disabled, to inhibit tracking in angle. By varying the 
phase while holding the attenuation constant and vice versa, circles like those in 
Figure 9.2 were obtained. 
Some processors are not designed to work as exact processors even if the 
equipment and calibration were perfect. Under limited conditions, however, they 
may produce the same output as an exact processor, or a close approximation to it. 
For example, the approximate dot-product detector described in Section 8.9 has an 
output that is equal to the real part when the imaginary part is 0 and the real part is 
between −1 and 1. Otherwise the output is a nonlinear function of both the real 
and imaginary parts of the indicated angle, in accordance with (8.19). A second 
identical device connected to the same inputs (s and d), with one of the inputs 
phase-shifted 90°, would produce a corresponding output with the real and imagi-
nary parts interchanged, as shown in (8.22). By inverting the pair of simultaneous 
equations, the real and imaginary parts can theoretically be computed from the 
outputs of the two processors. However, because of the saturation effect illustrated 
in Figures 8.7 and 8.8, the solutions may become indeterminate or inaccurate 
when the real or imaginary art is large. 
Similar comments apply to noncoherent processors using the sum and differ-
ence of |v1| and |v2| (see Section 8.10) or |s + d| and |s − d| (see Section 8.11). In 
those cases solutions can be ambiguous because of the reversal of the curves plot-
ted in Figures 8.10 and 8.11. 
The preceding two paragraphs do not imply any deficiency in such “inexact” 
processors. They have advantages of simplicity and moderate cost. They have 
been used extensively in some monopulse radars and have given excellent per-
formance in the application for which they are designed, namely closed-loop 
tracking of single targets close to the axis. However, they are not the preferred 
choice in applications requiring accurate off-axis measurements over the entire 
beam or measurements of the imaginary as well as the real parts when the indi-
cated angle is complex.

9.8 EFFECT OF LOCAL-OSCILLATOR FREQUENCY 
In radar receivers the signals from the antenna at radio frequency (RF) are usually 
converted to an intermediate frequency (IF) by mixing with the voltage from a 
local oscillator (LO). The LO is offset in frequency from the RF so that the differ-
ence frequency equals the desired IF. The LO frequency can be either above or 
below the RF. 
If the LO frequency is below the RF, the sum and difference signals have the 
same relative phase at IF as at RF. If the LO frequency is above the RF, a relative 
phase φ at RF changes to −φ at IF. This change has no effect on the real part, but it 
changes the sign of the imaginary part; thus Figure 9.3 is uncharged but in Figure 
9.2 the phases of the broken circular arcs above and below the real axis are inter-
changed. The effect on multipath response curves is discussed in Section 11.12. 
9.9 DETECTION OF PRESENCE OF UNRESOLVED TARGETS 
Since a single target produces little or no imaginary part of the indicated angle, the 
presence of an imaginary part exceeding a threshold can theoretically be used as 
an indication that more than one target is present [2]. The threshold must be set so 
that the probability of false alarms from noise, clutter, and other interference does 
not exceed some specified value. The information from a threshold crossing may 
be used for target analysis or counting, or to discard a “contaminated” measure-
ment that may do more harm than a missing measurement. 
An analysis of this technique [9] has shown that at moderate signal-to-
interference ratios the single-pulse discrimination between a single target and mul-
tiple targets is poor, but that the reliability of discrimination can be raised to a 
useful level by integrating the imaginary part (quadrature component) from sev-
eral independent pulses. It was also found that the probability of correct discrimi-
nation was higher for steady targets than for fluctuating targets. As an example, 
with two independent Swerling Case 2 targets of equal average cross section,3 
separated by one-quarter beamwidth and producing a combined average signal-to-
interference ratio of 24 dB, the analysis showed that integration of five pulses 
gave a detection probability of 0.9 (probability of recognizing the presence of 
more than one target) with a threshold such that the false-alarm probability was 
0.17 (probability of declaring the presence of more than one target when there was 
actually only one). With steady targets under the same conditions the correspond-
ing probabilities were 0.95 and 0.01. 
Another approach, intended for use in multiple-beam antennas, has been de-
scribed in [10]. Recognizing that the interference from unresolved targets or mul-

distribution in amplitude), fluctuating independently from pulse to pulse.

tipath creates an imaginary part of what otherwise would be a real ratio, it uses a 
generalized likelihood-ratio test to detect the presence of such interference in or-
der to reject contaminated angle measurements. 
9.10 MEAN AND VARIANCE OF INDICATED ANGLE 
Sometimes it is of interest to know the mean of the indicated angle if it is aver-
aged over many measurements while the relative phase φ varies linearly as a func-
tion of time or randomly with uniform distribution. Linear variation of phase with 
time may be the result of a constant range-rate differential between the two targets 
or RF stepping from pulse to pulse, assuming that the reflection phase characteris-
tics of the individual targets remain constant. Random variation of relative phase 
can occur because of random changes in the orientations or the range differential 
of the targets, or because of pseudo-random pulse-to-pulse frequency agility of the 
radar. 
Assume at first that the amplitude ratio and off-axis angles of the two targets 
remain constant during the averaging time. For the real part, the average of the 
fraction (1 − p2)/(1 + 2pcosφ +p2) in (9.9b), obtained by integrating4 it from φ = 0 
to φ = 2π and dividing by 2π, is 1 if p < 1 and −1 if p > 1. Substituting these val-
ues in (8.8b), we obtain the result that the mean of the indicated angle is θa if p < 1 
or θb if p > 1; in other words, the mean equals the angle of the stronger target [11]. 
If p = 1 the mean is the midpoint, but this is an academic case because the prob-
ability of exact equality is zero. 
The mean of the imaginary part is zero, as can be seem by inspection of 
(9.10) or Figure 9.2. 
Although calculation of the mean by taking the definite integral of the real 
part is straightforward under the assumed conditions, it becomes awkward or im-
practical when the amplitude ratio p is not constant or when there are more than 
two targets (this case will be examined later). A more powerful method, better 
suited for those cases, is complex integration. We will apply it first to the simple 
case already treated, with constant amplitude ratio, to illustrate its use and show 
that it yields the expected result. 
For this purpose it is convenient to start with the complex equation (8.8c).

The letter C represents the contour of integration in the complex plane. In the case 
of constant amplitude ratio, the contour is a counterclockwise circle of radius p 
centered at the origin. 
If p < 1, the contour of integration does not enclose or intersect with the point 
w = −1. Therefore the integrand has no singularities within or on the contour, and 
according to the Cauchy-Goursat theorem [12], the integral is zero. This means 
that both the real and imaginary parts are zero. Hence, if p < 1, the mean is equal 
to θa, the angle of the stronger target. 
If p > 1, the contour is a circle that encloses the singular point w = −1. Ac-
cording to the Cauchy integral formula [12], if wo is any point in the complex 
plane, the integral of 
( ) (

 around a contour that encloses wo is 
j2πf (wo). In our case wo = −1, f (w) =1/j, and f (wo) =1/j. Therefore (9.18) reduces

Here again the result agrees with that obtained by real integration. 
The advantage of complex integration, however, is that the contour need not 
be restricted to a circle but may be any closed path. Thus, the amplitude ratio p 
may vary. As long as the contour does not enclose the point w = −1 (a condition 
that allows p > 1 except when φ = 180°), the mean indicated angle is θa. Similarly, 
if p > 1 when φ = 180°, the mean indicated angle is θb. If the amplitude ratio and 
the relative phase vary in such a way that the contour must make n circuits around 
the origin in order to close, the contributions of the individual circuits to the 
Cauchy integral (±1) are summed and the sum divided by n. 
If both the amplitude ratio and the relative phase vary randomly and inde-
pendently, we assume that the contour closes if the averaging time is long enough. 
If two such targets have constant angles relative to the beam axis and if their am-
plitudes vary in such a way that one remains stronger than the other, then the 
mean indicated angle over all relative phases is the angle of the stronger target. If 
one target is not always the stronger, then the mean indicated angle is the 
weighted mean of the individual angles of the two targets, the weighting being the 
fraction of the time each target is stronger that the other. If the targets conform to

the standard analytical models of fluctuating targets such as the Swerling models 
and if their average signal strengths are specified, those fractions can readily be 
calculated. It has been shown, for example, that for two independent targets with 
Rayleigh distributions of amplitude (negative exponential distributions of power) 
and uniform distributions of phase, the average indicated angle is the “power cen-
troid”—that is, the average of the two target angles weighted by their respective 
powers [13]. This type of amplitude distribution characterizes (by definition) 
Swerling Case 1 and Case 2 targets and is a reasonable model for noise jammers. 
Hence, the result applies to two such targets, two jammers, or one of each in the 
same resolution cell. 
The single-target monopulse output is not exactly proportional to angle, as 
has been assumed. Nevertheless the results derived above are still correct provided 
the averaging is done on the measurements of normalized monopulse output be-
fore conversion to angle rather than converting each measurement to angle and 
then averaging. The results still depend, however, on the assumption of an exact 
processor, one that measures Re(d/s). Furthermore, the results apply only to open-
loop measurements or to closed-loop tracking with a long time constant, since it is 
assumed that the beam axis remains fixed relative to the angular positions of the 
targets during the averaging time. 
The variance of the indicated angle (the mean-squared deviation of the indi-
cated angle from its mean) has been analyzed [14]. For a constant amplitude ratio 
the real and imaginary parts have the same variance:

(9.20) 
In this equation p is interpreted as the amplitude ratio of the weaker target to the 
stronger, so p < 1. If one target is much weaker than the other (p << 1), the vari-
ance is approximately p2(Δθ)2/2. If p = 1, the variance according to (9.20) is infi-
nite, but this result is academic because the limited dynamic range of the radar 
circuits keeps the variance finite, and in any case the probability of maintaining 
exactly equal amplitudes during the observation time is zero. 
For variable p, as in the case of fluctuating targets, the result of (9.20) must 
be averaged over p2, the power ratio, in accordance with the appropriate probabil-
ity density. If neither target is always the stronger, the variance must be referenced 
to the mean indicated angle, calculated as above. The variance is computed for 
each target when it is the stronger of the two, multiplied by the fraction of the time 
when it is the stronger, and the two partial results are added. 
In practice, the result of averaging will generally not be exactly equal to the 
mean as derived above, even if the assumptions of constant target angles and line-
arly or randomly varying relative phase are valid and even if noise and other er-

rors are ignored. One reason is that the measurements are sampled (on individual 
pulses or dwells) rather than continuous; the analytical results are changed if the 
integral in (9.15) is replaced by a summation. Another is that the theoretical re-
sults are based on averaging over an integer number of cycles in the case of line-
arly varying relative phase or over an infinite time in the case of either linearly or 
randomly varying phase. Neither of these conditions is fulfilled in practice. 
9.11 WEIGHTED MEAN OF INDICATED ANGLE 
The mean derived in the preceding section was unweighted; that is, all measure-
ments of the indicated angle were given equal weight. In this section we consider 
the effect of weighting each measurement by the ratio of the sum-signal power 
during that measurement to the total of the sum-signal powers during all the 
measurements. 
Consider the real part of the indicated angle, as given by (9.9a). The denomi-
nator is the sum-signal power normalized to the power of the first target alone. 
This could be converted to absolute power by multiplying it by the power of the 
first target. The numerator would then have to be multiplied by the same number, 
leaving the value unchanged. Therefore we can assign a value of unity to the 
power of the first target. 
For purposes of analysis we assume that the measurements are continuous 
rather than sampled and that the target angles relative to the axis are constant dur-
ing the averaging time. Initially, we assume also that the amplitude ratio p is con-
stant. The weighted mean of the real part over the relative phase φ, from (8.9a), is

This is the “power centroid” of the two targets. The result applies to all values of 
p, whether < 1 or > 1. The factor p2 is the ratio of radar cross sections of the tar-
gets multiplied by the ratio of antenna power gains in the two directions (one-way 

208 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
or two-way gain, depending on the mode of operation of the radar). If there is any 
Doppler discrimination, this may also affect the value of p2. The range-dependent 
effect is usually negligible, since the ranges of two unresolved targets are nor-
mally nearly equal. 
The mean of the imaginary part, whether weighted or unweighted, is zero. 
This can be seen by noting that the integral of sinφ in (9.10) is zero when taken 
over a cycle. 
If p2 varies because of target cross-section fluctuations, independently of the 
variation of φ, the power centroid derived in (9.22) can be averaged over p2 with 
the appropriate probability density function.

For example, consider the I and Q processor described in Section 8.6, which 
computes each single-pulse output by (8.9). To compute the power-weighted av-
erage, the division of the numerator by the denominator on each pulse is omitted. 
Instead, the numerators are computed for each pulse and summed over the n 
pulses and the same is done for the denominators. Then the quotient of the two 
summations is computed. 
The comments in the preceding section pointing out why an average obtained 
in a practical situation can be expected to differ from the theoretical apply also to 
weighted averaging.

9.12 POSSIBILITY OF DETERMINING ANGLES OF UNRESOLVED 
TARGETS 
The question arises whether measurement of both the real and imaginary parts of 
the indicated angle would provide enough information to solve for the individual 
angles of two unresolved targets. Having measured Re(θi) and Im(θi), we wish to 
use (9.10) and one of the forms of (9.9) to solve for θa and θb (the angles of the 
first and second targets respectively), keeping in mind that θmid and Δθ are related 
to θa and θb by the definitions under (9.8b). For each angular coordinate we have 
two equations but four unknowns: θa, θb, p (the amplitude ratio of the two targets), 
and φ (their relative phase). Therefore a solution based on a single pulse (or single 
measurement derived from a train of pulses) is impossible if the measurement is 
made in only one angular coordinate.5 
If we make simultaneous measurements in both angular coordinates, we have 
four equations but six unknowns: θa and θb, in traverse and in elevation, a com-
mon value of p, and a common value of φ. Again a solution is impossible. 
The fact that the primary interest is in the target angles rather than their am-
plitude ratio or relative phase does not help, since the solutions are not separable. 
In addition to the sum and two difference signals, monopulse radars that use a 
four-horn feed have an unused by-product of the comparator, the diagonal differ-
ence (see Section 4.4.3), which is terminated in a dummy load. It might appear 
that measurement of the in-phase and quadrature components of this signal, nor-
malized to the sum, could provide the additional equations needed for a solution. 
It will be shown in Section 15.2, however, that this signal is not useful, because it 
has zero or low sensitivity to target direction in the vicinity of the beam axis and 
along the traverse and elevation principal planes. 
Therefore in the general case of two arbitrary targets and with a conventional 
configuration of monopulse antenna patterns, a single-pulse solution is impossi-
ble. This statement still leaves open the possibility of a single-pulse solution in 
special cases of specular multipath where there are known relationships between a 
low-angle target and its image; this case will be discussed in Chapter 11. 
The next question to be examined is whether measurements made on two or 
more successive pulses6 would make a solution possible. It will be shown that in 
theory a solution can be obtained with as few as two pulses. To provide independ-
ent equations either the radar parameters or the target parameters must change 
between pulses in such a way that the additional number of independent measur-
ables exceeds the additional number of unknowns. 
                                                           
5  This statement applies to the usual form of monopulse in which two antenna patterns are available 
in each coordinate—either a sum and difference or a pair of component patterns. It does not necessar-
ily apply to special configurations that provide more than two patterns. 
6  The word “pulse” is to be interpreted here as either a single pulse or a train of pulses from which a 
single set of measurements is made. 

210 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
Various types of changes are possible between pulses—for example, a change 
in beam pointing direction, frequency, or polarization of the radar, or some change 
in the targets. The method described here is based on a change in relative phase φ 
during the interval, due to relative motion of the two targets while their other pa-
rameters remain constant. This method is presented as an illustration of the poten-
tially useful information in the imaginary part of the indicated angle, but because 
of errors and limitations, which will be discussed, the possibility of its practical 
application is limited to certain restricted conditions. 
To illustrate the changes produced by relative target motion, suppose that the 
radar has a wavelength of 10 cm and that during the interval between pulses, say 
0.01s, the range difference of the two targets changes by 1 cm. Then the change in 
φ is 72°, while θa and θb in each angular coordinate can usually be considered 
constant over such a short interval. This is true even if the target directions are 
changing rapidly (but not relative to each other), provided the antenna beam is 
moving with them, since angles are measured with respect to the beam axis. For 
steady or slowly fluctuating targets, the target amplitude ratio p may also be con-
sidered constant. 
If the relative phase is changing at a steady rate, there is a Doppler difference, 
which amounts to 1 m/s in this particular case. It might be argued that there is 
already a known solution for this type of problem, namely resolution of the two 
targets by Doppler filtering. However, the average rate of change of relative phase 
may be too small to permit Doppler resolution of the targets by a particular radar, 
or the radar may not be equipped to do Doppler resolution. Furthermore, the 
pulse-to-pulse change may be random or transient rather than steady, so that Dop-
pler resolution is impossible. For example, two aircraft attempting to maintain a 
constant separation may have zero relative Doppler shift on the average, but ran-
dom perturbations in their positions will produce pulse-to-pulse changes in rela-
tive phase. The method to be described applies to random as well as uniform 
phase changes. 
There are five unknown quantities (for one angular coordinate) that must be 
calculated from the data obtained on the two pulses: the two target angles θa and 
θb, the relative phases φ1 and φ2, and the target amplitude ratio p. To determine 
these unknowns, there are five measured quantities available from the two pulses: 
x1, y1, and x2, y2, the real and imaginary parts of the indicated angles measured on 
the first and second pulses respectively, and the ratio rp of received powers of the 
two pulses. The solution is obtained through the following procedure.  
Let xc represent the x-coordinate of the center of the circle and ρ the radius. 
Then the circle satisfies two equations:

The units of θa and θb are the same as those of x1, y1, and x2, y2. For example, these 
quantities may be in degrees or beamwidths, or they may be left in the form of 
monopulse voltage ratios without conversion to angles. 
There is another value of p that satisfies (9.33), namely the reciprocal of the 
value shown in (9.34). However, when the reciprocal value is substituted in (9.30) 
and (9.31), it merely interchanges θa and θb. Therefore the solution is unique, at 
least in this example. 
Examination of the sensitivity of this procedure to small errors in measure-
ment of the indicated angles shows that a change in any one real or imaginary part 
by 0.01 causes the target off-axis angles to change by ≈0.02, for the situation rep-
resented by the example values, with 71° phase shift between the two pulses. 
Random noise with rms level 0.01 in all five measurements would presumably 
cause rms errors of ≈0.04 in the target angles. This indicates that the two-target 
measurement, even with near-optimum phase change between the two pulses, 
requires about 12 dB more signal-to-noise ratio to preserve the accuracy available 
with only one target. Such an increase is consistent with theory of resolution im-
provement [15], which showed that a 2:1 improvement in resolution is available at 
the expense of about 10 dB in signal-to-noise ratio, but that further increase re-
quires much stronger signals. 
Two points that are closely spaced in the x-coordinate will give a less accu-
rate solution than points that are widely spaced. When the two points have the 
same x-coordinate, however, there are several sources of error: 
1. Thermal noise will generally cause more error for angle estimation 
of two unresolved targets than for one target. 
2. The assumption that the two targets maintain not only the same am-
plitude ratio but also the same absolute amplitude on the two pulses, 
as required by (9.33), is not generally realistic; pulse-to-pulse am-
plitude fluctuations may cause serious errors. However, the assump-
tion is valid if the interpulse interval is short. 
3. Phase and amplitude imbalance in the sum and difference channels, 
as well as imperfect normalization and processing, will cause errors 
in measurement of x1, y1, and x2, y2. There will also be errors in 
measurement of the sum-signal power ratio |s1|2/|s2|2. In order to de-
rive useful results it would be necessary to design and maintain the 
equipment to tighter tolerances than are normally required. 
4. A real-life target is generally not a point target but has multiple 
scattering points whose relative phases vary with motion of the tar-
get. This variation causes not only amplitude fluctuation but also 
angular wander of the apparent location (known as glint) of each 
target, contrary to the assumption that the target angles are constant 
during each interpulse period. Unless the angular extent of each tar-

214 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
get is small compared with the angular separation of the two targets 
or the glint is only slowly varying, there may be appreciable error. 
5. The solution is based on the assumption that no more that two tar-
gets are present. If there is only one, the correct results are still ob-
tained, because then (disregarding noise) x1 = x2, y1 = y2, and 
|s1|2/|s2|2 = 1, which gives the correct angle for the first target and 
zero amplitude for the second. If, however, more than two targets 
are present, the results will be erroneous. 
The method described does not depend, however, on the assumption that the 
monopulse output is linear with angle. The values of x1, y1, and x2, y2 used in the 
solution should be the monopulse ratios in “raw” form, before conversion to an-
gle. The solution will be the monopulse ratios of the individual targets. Conver-
sion to angles of those targets, using the actual calibration function, is the final 
step. 
Results could be improved to some extent by using several pulses rather than 
two, but not if pulse-to-pulse amplitude fluctuations of the targets are the limiting 
source of error. Some advantage might also be gained from the fact that simulta-
neous measurements in both angular coordinates would provide more measurables 
than unknowns and thus overdetermine the solution. The second coordinate has 
two additional unknowns, the angles θa and θb of the two targets in that coordi-
nate, but it gives four additional measurables, x1, y1, and x2, y2. 
Theoretically, therefore, the use of both the real and imaginary parts of the 
indicated angle on two or more pulses offers the possibility of determining the 
individual angles of two arbitrary targets that are unresolved in the usual sense. 
From a practical standpoint, however, any potential applications appear to be lim-
ited to steady or slowly fluctuating targets (not more than two), high signal-to-
noise ratios, and very accurate equipment. 
9.13 INFORMATION DERIVABLE FROM REAL PART 
It has been shown [11] that partial information about two unresolved targets is 
theoretically derivable from monopulse measurements on two pulses, under the 
same conditions as in the preceding section, but without requiring the imaginary 
part of the monopulse ratio. The measurements consist of the real part on each 
pulse and the ratio of the powers of the two pulses. The information that can be 
deduced from the two pulses consists of the angular midpoint of the two targets in 
each coordinate and the slope of the line joining them. 
As in the preceding sections, for each angular coordinate we denote the real 
parts by x1 and x2, the ratio of the sum-signal powers by |s2|2/|s1|2, the angular mid-
point by θmid, and their angular separations by Δθ. From (9.9b),

which is the slope of the line joining the two targets. 
This method is subject to the same kinds of errors as the two-pulse solution 
for the individual target angles (described in the preceding section), but probably 
to a lesser extent, since fewer unknowns and fewer measurements are involved. 
Going a step further, it was shown in Section 9.10 that the result of averaging 
the real part of the indicated angle over many pulses is to indicate the angle of the 
stronger target, provided that during the averaging time, (1) the angles of the two 
targets relative to the radar axis are constant, (2) the relative phase of the two tar-
gets is uniformly distributed from 0 to 2π, and (3) the target amplitudes remain 
constant or vary in such a way that one target is always stronger that the other. 
The angle of the stronger target in combination with the midpoint angle also 
determines the angle of the weaker target. However, the conditions imposed on 
the targets and the errors discussed in Section 9.10 restrict the practical usefulness 
of this method.

9.14 REMOVAL OF INITIAL ASSUMPTIONS 
At the beginning of this chapter four assumptions were made in order to simplify 
the analysis. The effects of removing these assumptions will now be examined 
and it will be shown that the analysis is still basically valid but may require some 
refinements. 
The first assumption was that the sum and difference voltages from a single 
point target have 0° (or 180°) relative phase. In practice there may be a small 
phase difference, due to inherent characteristics of the antenna or to imperfections 
in components or alignment. A 90° relative phase occurring in some radar designs, 
as explained in Chapter 5, is of no concern. Since it is predictable, it can be re-
moved by a phase shifter, or the equivalent transformation can be accomplished in 
the processing. Our concern is with smaller, residual phase deviations. The com-
plex-plane loci of constant amplitude ratio and constant relative phase of the two 
targets are still circles, as in Figure 9.2, but the points representing the two targets 
are displaced from the real axis and the centers of the circles deviate to some ex-
tent from the real and imaginary axes respectively. If the difference-to-sum rela-
tive phase characteristics of the radar are known (the phase will generally vary as 
a function of off-axis angle), they can be taken into account in the analysis with a 
little more labor. Or for the purposes of error analysis, the effect of a specified 
phase deviation can be calculated. 
The second assumption was that the monopulse processor is an exact proces-
sor measuring the real part of d/s, and that if the imaginary part is also desired, it 
is obtained from an additional, identical processor with one of the inputs shifted 
by 90°. As explained in Chapter 8, many processors are not of the “exact” type. 
They may perform in a nearly equivalent manner when tracking a single target 
close to the axis but may differ greatly in their response to unresolved targets or 
even to single targets near or beyond the edge of the beam. In some cases their 
outputs can be converted by computation to the equivalent of the outputs of exact 
processors. For example, a pair of approximate dot-product processors (see Sec-
tion 8.9), with one input to one of them shifted by 90°, can produce a pair of out-
puts from which Re(d/s) and Im(d/s) can be calculated. However, when such 
processors operate in their saturation region, the lost information cannot be recov-
ered. The two-target response of any type of processor can be analyzed by using 
equations such as those derived in Chapter 8, but generally the analysis is more 
complicated and the results cannot be expressed in a simple, normalized, paramet-
ric form as they can for an exact processor. For this reason many published analy-
ses have been based on the implicit assumption of an exact processor; while they 
are useful, they should be used with this limitation in mind. 
The third assumption was that the normalized difference signal from a single 
target is proportional to its angle off axis, so that conversion from normalized dif-
ference signal to angle or vice versa requires only multiplication or division by a 

 
Response to Unresolved Targets 
217 
constant factor. This assumption simplifies physical interpretation, but is not nec-
essary. It can easily be removed in the following way. Wherever the symbols θa 
and θb occur in equations, they are to be interpreted not as the off-axis angles of 
the first and second target respectively, but as their respective normalized differ-
ence signals. Thus, if the angles are given, they should be converted to normalized 
difference signals by means of the known calibration function for the particular 
radar, and then entered in the equation. Conversely, if θa and θb are unknowns for 
which solutions are being sought, the solutions are to be interpreted as normalized 
difference signals, which are then converted to angles. The same rules apply to the 
indicated angle θi, and to any other symbols in the equations that represent angles. 
When the target angles and the indicated angles are small, the assumption of pro-
portionality is usually safe. It should be kept in mind, however, that the indicated 
angle can be larger than either of the target angles. If the purpose of analysis is 
error budgeting, a best-fit linear approximation to the calibration function usually 
suffices.  
The fourth assumption was that the response in each angular coordinate is in-
dependent of the target location in the other coordinate. In practice the cross-
coupling is not always negligible in the actual operation of the radar, but it can 
generally be ignored in analyzing errors due to unresolved targets (as distin-
guished from analyzing single-target errors due directly to the coupling). If neces-
sary, two-coordinate calibration can be used. 
9.15 EXTENSIONS OF MONOPULSE TECHNIQUES AND  
 
FUNDAMENTAL LIMITATIONS 
Various techniques other than conventional monopulse have been investigated for 
the purpose of determining the individual angles of targets that are unresolved in 
the usual sense [16–20]. These techniques differ from conventional monopulse in 
that they require more than two simultaneous antenna receiving patterns in each 
angular coordinate. They can be regarded as extended forms of monopulse, since 
they make use of complex ratios of simultaneously received patterns. The patterns 
may be obtained from multiple feed horns or feed connections in a reflector an-
tenna, or from individual elements or groups of elements (subarrays) in an array. 
The use of simultaneous signals from individual elements or subarrays is known 
generally as aperture sampling. 
With the additional information available from more than two patterns it is 
theoretically possible to obtain a solution from a single pulse, thus avoiding the 
error due to target amplitude fluctuation in the two-pulse method described in 
Section 9.12. However, the other sources of error still apply. The lower bound of 

218 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
single-pulse error due to thermal noise7 has been analyzed and plotted in paramet-
ric form [21]. The results shown that as the angular separation of two targets de-
creases below a beamwidth (while they are unresolved in range and Doppler), 
there is a sharp increase in the signal-to-noise ratio required for individual angle 
estimates of specified accuracy from a single pulse. As a rule of thumb, resolution 
can be considered lost when the standard deviation of error on either target ex-
ceeds the separation between the targets; at typical signal-to-noise ratios this con-
dition occurs when the separation is only a little less than a beamwidth. 
In addition to thermal-noise errors, there are of course other errors, such as 
those due to the equipment. 
Another limitation of single-pulse two-target angle estimation is that it is 
based on the assumption that the number of targets is exactly two. There is an 
error not only when there are more than two targets but also when there is only 
one. In the latter case the estimator, programmed to extract the locations of two 
targets from the measurements (when in fact there is only one), will do so, but 
both estimated angles may be much farther from the true angle than if the estima-
tor were programmed to interpret the measurements as if they were due to a single 
target. 
The preceding comments apply to single-pulse estimation. Improvement may 
be obtained by the use of multiple pulses, either by averaging or smoothing the 
estimates obtained from each pulse or by combining the raw single-pulse meas-
urements in some way before forming an estimate. 
The lower bound of thermal-noise error mentioned above does not apply di-
rectly to the two-pulse method of angle estimation described in Section 9.12. The 
sensitivity of that method to noise was analyzed only approximately, but was 
found to require about 12 dB increase in signal-to-noise ratio to preserve the accu-
racy achievable with a single target. 
9.16 CLOSED-LOOP TRACKING 
The analysis presented in the earlier sections pertains to the open-loop monopulse 
response to unresolved targets. The direction of the antenna beam axis has been 
assumed to remain fixed, so that only the open-loop indicated angle (relative to 
the beam axis) varies as a result of changes in the relative phase, amplitude ratio, 
and/or angular locations of the targets. 
In closed-loop tracking the analysis is more complicated. As the antenna 
beam moves in order to null out the real part of the indicated angle, it changes the 
relative illumination of the two targets. As a result, the values of g, p, and possibly 
                                                           
7  The lower bound is determined by the Cramér-Rao inequality, derived from estimation theory. With 
a given antenna aperture, no form of processing can have a smaller error or necessarily have an error as 
small as the lower bound. 

 
Response to Unresolved Targets 
219 
φ, all defined in (9.7), vary as the beam axis moves, even if the targets remain 
fixed in absolute position and constant in radar cross section and phase. Hence, 
the closed-loop tracking angle is generally not the same as the open-loop indicated 
angle. 
To calculate the tracking equilibrium direction of the beam requires an itera-
tive type of solution using knowledge of the antenna patterns and the monopulse 
processor characteristics. The solution is obtained by searching for the beam axis 
direction that nulls the real part of the indicated angle. Depending on the angular 
separation of the targets and their relative amplitude and phase, there may be only 
one stable equilibrium direction or there may be two, with an unstable equilibrium 
between them.8 At unstable equilibrium the slope of the monopulse response ver-
sus angle has the wrong sign, so that a displacement of the beam axis produces an 
output that drives the beam farther away from that direction rather than back to-
ward it. 
If the antenna is mechanically steerable, the problem is further complicated 
by the fact that the antenna cannot respond instantaneously. In a typical situation 
where the target positions, amplitudes, and/or phase are changing (the phases are 
likely to change most rapidly), the dynamic characteristics of the entire servo loop 
must be taken into account. Because the results depend on so many factors, in-
cluding the time-dependent target behavior, they cannot be presented in any sim-
ple normalized form analogous to the open-loop equations and curves of Sections 
9.4 and 9.5. 
An analysis of this problem, using the characteristics of one specific radar 
(including its antenna patterns, monopulse processor, and servo loop) has been 
published [22]. Results are given for various angular separations, amplitude ratios, 
and relative phases of two unresolved targets. The same kind of analysis can be 
adapted to other radars. For most monopulse tracking radars the results are quali-
tatively similar. Both analysis and experience have demonstrated that under some 
conditions the antenna can oscillate erratically, sometimes causing loss of track. 
9.17 MORE THAN TWO TARGETS 
If the number of unresolved targets exceeds two, a deterministic analysis of mo-
nopulse response (with position, amplitude, and phase of each target specified) 
can still be carried out by straightforward extension of the analysis presented in 
Sections 9.4 and 9.5. However, the mathematics becomes increasingly compli-
cated as the number of targets increases [2, 3]. The usefulness of such an analysis 
is limited, since the positions, amplitudes, and phases of the targets at any instant 
                                                           
8  There may be additional equilibrium directions in the sidelobe region (even when there is only one 
target) but these are usually not a problem. Because they produce a smaller signal strength, the radar is 
unlikely to lock on them. 

220 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
are not likely to be known. Parametric plots of the form of Figures 9.2 and 9.3 
could be made, but they would comprise multiple families of curves because of 
the increased number of parameters. 
The inverse problem of solving for the angles of the individual targets, given 
a set of measurements either from one pulse or from multiple pulses, not only in-
volves laborious mathematics but appears academic in view of the difficulty of 
obtaining useful accuracy for even two targets. Extension of the method described 
in Section 9.12 to three targets, for example, would require measurements of the 
complex indicated angle and of sum-signal amplitude ratios on six pulses, yielding 
17 equations in 17 unknowns [2]. 
A statistical rather than deterministic analysis of the multiple-target problem 
is usually more tractable and more useful. The statistical behavior of the mo-
nopulse response to independent unresolved targets is most conveniently analyzed 
by assuming the targets to be infinite in number. The results are found to give a 
close approximation for as few as five or six roughly equal targets, and they indi-
cate at least the qualitative trends for as few as three. 
The statistical behavior of the monopulse output for a target complex consist-
ing of an infinite number of independent scatterers of equal cross section, uni-
formly spaced along a line perpendicular to the radar line of sight and within the 
radar beam, has been analyzed [2, 23]. The percentage of the time that the indi-
cated angle lies outside the angular span of the target complex was calculated as 
13%. A corresponding analysis for an infinite number of independent scatterers of 
equal strength uniformly spaced over a circular area showed that the direction 
indicated by the radar would lie outside the circle 20% of the time. 
In both of these analytical cases the target model is artificial and the radar 
performance is idealized. Nevertheless the analytical results are in reasonable 
agreement with experimental measurements, which have shown that for complex 
targets such as ships and aircraft the indicated direction can lie outside of the 
physical extent of the target 10% to 20% of the time [24]. Many measurements of 
angular wander (angle noise) have been made on a variety of aircraft [25]. Ex-
pressed in terms of lateral distance at the range of the target, the standard devia-
tion is found to be proportional to the radius of gyration (in the coordinate of in-
terest) of the distribution of radar cross sections of the reflecting areas of the tar-
get. For most aircraft the standard deviation has been found to be between 0.15L 
and 0.25L (L being the projected width of the target in the coordinate of interest), 
depending on the distribution of major scattering areas such as engines, wing 
tanks, and the like. For a small single-engine aircraft, viewed nose-on, the stan-
dard deviation can be as low as 0.1L; for a large aircraft with outboard engines 
and possibly wing tanks, or an aircraft viewed from the side, it can be as much as 
0.3L. A somewhat higher standard deviation is obtained in the worst case, in 
which the target complex consists of a formation of two unresolved aircraft. 
The derivation of the average indicated angle given in Section 9.10 for two 
targets can be extended to any number of targets, distributed in any manner. 

 
Response to Unresolved Targets 
221 
Analysis by contour integration in the complex plane shows that if the amplitude 
of one target is always greater than the sum of the amplitudes of the others, the 
average is the angle of that target. Another interesting finding [13] is that for any 
number, arrangement, and strengths of independent targets and/or jammers all 
having independent Rayleigh-distributed amplitudes and uniformly distributed 
phases (i.e., Swerling Case 1 or Case 2 targets and/or noise jammers), the average 
indicated angle is the “power centroid”— that is, the average of the angles of the 
individual targets or jammers weighted by their respective average powers. That is 
an extension of the corresponding result for two targets stated in Section 9.10. 
9.18 NONINDEPENDENT TARGETS 
In the preceding sections the targets were allowed to be arbitrary and independent. 
However, when the unresolved targets are scattering points on a single rigid body, 
they are not independent. Their positions, motions, and amplitudes are related. 
Their relative phases depend on the configuration of the body and on its orienta-
tion relative to the radar line of sight, and can change only in accordance with 
changes in orientation. Furthermore, if the body is free of external forces except 
gravity (as in the case of a satellite), there are physical constraints on its transla-
tional and rotational motion. 
A satellite or other long-range target subtends such a small angle at the radar 
that it is essentially a point target, and monopulse measurements can reveal little 
or nothing about its configuration. However, if its orientation relative to the radar 
line of sight changes in a regular manner, so do the relative phases of the scatter-
ing points, causing the resultant amplitude and phase of the echo signal to fluctu-
ate. In such cases a great deal of information about the size, shape, and rotation of 
the body can often be deduced from analysis of the time history of the sum-signal 
amplitude, with or without phase, over some period of time (usually on the order 
of seconds or minutes) during which the orientation of the body relative to the line 
of sight is changing in a regular way [26, 27]. Such methods of analysis are called 
by various names, including radar signature analysis, target recognition, and 
space object identification. 
The primary value of monopulse in such an application lies in its ability to 
keep the beam axis pointing very close to the target direction and its freedom from 
radar-imposed modulation (such as the modulation imposed by conical scan). As a 
result, the observed modulation is known to be caused entirely by the target and 
can be analyzed accordingly. 
Another situation in which unresolved targets are not independent is that of 
specular multipath. In that case the reflecting surface produces an image of a 
physical target, so that the target and image act like a pair of unresolved targets, 
which are related in amplitude, phase, and location according to the geometry and 

222

electromagnetic characteristics of the reflecting surface. Multipath is discussed in 
Chapter 11.

Chapter 10 
Monopulse Angle Errors 
Monopulse, along with all other angle-measuring systems, is subject to errors 
from various sources. Certain types of errors are singled out for particular atten-
tion in other chapters of this book: 
• 
Errors due to inexact methods of monopulse processing were 
pointed out and illustrated in portions of Chapter 8. 
• 
Errors due to unresolved targets were treated in Chapter 9. 
• 
Multipath is another special case, in which the target and its re-
flections from the surface are equivalent to unresolved targets; 
this usually becomes the dominant error at low target angles. It is 
treated separately in Chapter 11.  
• 
Intentional interference (ECM) is a significant source of error in 
military radar systems. This is discussed in Chapter 12, along 
with methods of reducing the effects (ECCM). 
The present chapter analyzes types of error not covered in other chapters, and 
presents practical formulas, analytical methods, and other useful information. 
Errors in radar angle measurement of target coordinates can be classified in 
several ways: 
1. Into bias and random errors, or more completely by their spectra 
or correlation functions. 
2. By their causes, into radar-dependent, target-dependent, and 
propagation errors. 
3. By their point of origin in the system, into tracking errors (devia-
tions from the beam axis or measured off-axis angle), and errors 
in translating that angle into the coordinate system of the system 
that uses the data output. 
The spectral properties of error are of critical importance if the target position 
data are to be differentiated into velocity and acceleration components, since a 

226 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
fixed bias has little effect on the derivatives of the data, while time-varying errors 
can appear with multiplying factors that depend on the position error spectrum. 
The angle error sources commonly encountered in radar are listed in Table 
10.1. Those components pertaining specifically to monopulse angle measurement 
are listed in boldface in the table, and discussed here or in Chapters 11 and 12.

ERROR DUE TO NOISE  
Noise is the dominant source of angular error (or loss of track) under conditions of 
low signal-to-noise ratio, usually at long ranges. Thermal noise is internally gen-
erated in all receivers, and other noise can also come from external sources. As 
mentioned in Section 1.4, one of the advantages of monopulse over sequential 
scan is that the monopulse radar has less angular error due to noise, compared to 
other radar types having the same transmitted power and antenna size. 
In this chapter the analytical approach to the calculation of noise errors is de-
scribed and practical formulas are derived. 

 
Monopulse Angle Errors 
227 
10.1.1  
Analytical Model 
We wish to determine the error in an estimate of target angle due to noise. Since 
the fundamental monopulse output in each angular coordinate is the ratio d/s in 
that coordinate, we first determine the error in d/s and then the conversion to angle 
error. 
The analysis begins with the assumption of an exact monopulse processor, 
defined in Section 8.4 as a processor that produces exactly the real part of the 
complex difference-to-sum ratio, and optionally the imaginary part if needed. 
(This definition does not require that the output be a linear function of angle.) The 
effects of other conditions are then considered. The analysis is carried out for a 
single pulse; for a multiple-pulse estimate the single-pulse standard deviation in 
general is divided by the square root of the number of pulses, but in some cases 
correlation from pulse to pulse does not permit such a reduction. 
In analyzing the error due to noise, we assume a point target—that is, a target 
with a single scattering point. The error due to multiple scattering points on a tar-
get, called glint, is treated in Section 10.5.1. 
Let s and d represent the noise-free sum and difference phasor voltages (com-
plex envelopes, as explained in Section 2.7 of Chapter 2), and let ns and nd repre-
sent the additive phasor noise voltages in the respective channels. Then the noise-
corrupted sum and noise voltages are  
 
s
s
s
n
′ =
+
 
(10.1) 
 
d
d
d
n
′ =
+
 
(10.2) 
Under conditions such as multipath, unresolved targets, or a target with glint, 
d and s will generally differ in phase, and their ratio must be treated as a complex 
quantity. For a single point target, as assumed here (and assuming no phase distor-
tions in the radar) the analysis is simplified because d and s have 0° or 180° rela-
tive phase and the noise-free monopulse ratio d/s is real.1 
10.1.2  
Noise Statistics 
The receiver-generated sum noise and difference noise are random variables, sta-
tistically independent of each other since they come from separate receivers. In 
some cases, however, there may be a correlated noise component. This may come

relative phase. It is assumed here that one of them is shifted 90° to bring them into phase alignment. If 
not, the results are the same except that the reals and imaginaries are interchanged.

component may not be equal in the sum and difference channels; it may have dif-
ferent values—positive or negative, even complex—depending on the source and 
on other factors. The correlated noise is statistically independent of the uncorre-
lated noise components. 
The noise voltages are treated as complex quantities. The real and imaginary 
parts of each noise component have independent Gaussian distributions with zero 
mean and equal variance.2 
If nc comes from an external point source such as a single jammer, then the 
coefficient c is real (positive or negative) and equal to d/s for a nonjamming target 
at the same location. If nc comes from the local oscillator, c is presumably also real 
because the local oscillator feeds the same voltage (including noise) to the sum 
and difference channels, assuming that the circuits are properly matched.

root of the variance is the standard deviation. 

 
Monopulse Angle Errors

The quantity εd/s is generally complex. If only the real part is of interest, as is 
usually the case, (10.7) can be separated into its real and imaginary parts and the 
latter can be ignored in the remainder of the analysis. The mathematical expres-
sions for the real part, however, are more complicated than those for the complex 
quantity. Therefore the method chosen here is to work with complex quantities 
until it actually becomes necessary to extract the real part for the final result. This 
also makes it possible to obtain information about the imaginary part, should it be 
needed. 
10.1.3 
Conversion of Voltages to Powers 
The analysis so far has involved sum, difference, and noise voltages. Antenna 
patterns, however, are usually plotted as power versus angle, and formulas used in 
calculating errors due to noise (as well as those used in calculating detection prob-
ability and other performance characteristics) are most conveniently expressed in 
terms of power, particularly signal-to-noise power ratios. The conversion from 
voltage equations to power equations is done in the following manner. 
As noted in the preceding subsection, the real and imaginary parts of each 
noise component have independent Gaussian distributions with zero mean and 
with equal variance. Let Ns, Nsu, Nd, Ndu, and Nc represent the variance of each 
real part and each imaginary part of the respective noise components. The vari-
ance of the sum noise ns, for example, is the sum of the variances of its real and 
imaginary parts, namely 2Ns. Since |ns| is the envelope amplitude (not the rms 
value) of an IF voltage, the average electrical power of the sum noise is half of 
2Ns, or simply Ns. Similarly the average electrical power of each of the other 
noise components is N with the appropriate subscript.3 
The sum-signal power, represented by the symbol S, is the square of the rms 
voltage amplitude, which is one-half of the square of the voltage amplitude. Thus

These relationships will be used in later sections. 
10.1.4 
Conversion from d/s Error to Angular Error 
As explained in Section 2.8, directional coordinates for mechanically steerable 
antennas are expressed in terms of angles. For fixed array antennas, directions are 
expressed in array coordinates (sine space). The following derivations are pre-
                                                 
3  The power is the square of the rms voltage divided by an appropriate load resistance. Assuming that 
the load resistance is the same in both channels, it cancels out when power ratios are taken, and can 
therefore be ignored. 

230 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
sented in angle space, but they can be applied to fixed array antennas by substitut-
ing sine space coordinates for angle space coordinates. 
It is shown in Section 15.1 that it is possible to design sum and difference pat-
terns producing a monopulse ratio proportional to the sine of the off-axis angle 
and thus very nearly proportional to the angle itself out to several degrees. How-
ever, patterns generally are not designed to have this property unless there is a 
specific need for it, because it requires some sacrifice of other desirable character-
istics. 
A typical curve of the monopulse ratio versus off-axis angle, like the one 
plotted in Figure 1.6, has a shape resembling a tangent function. In the main lobe 
it goes from negative infinity at the first sum-pattern null on one side of the axis to 
positive infinity on the other side. The values are repeated in the sidelobes and 
therefore the conversion from monopulse ratio to angle is theoretically ambigu-
ous. In normal practice, however, the indicated angle is interpreted as being within 
the main lobe, and since the target is also presumed to be within the main lobe, the 
angle error cannot exceed the null-to-null width of the main lobe. Furthermore, in 
some systems a measured monopulse ratio greater than a specified limit (corre-
sponding, say, to a little more than one-half beamwidth from the axis) is either 
discarded as being erroneous or is truncated to the limiting value. 
Thus, even if the equipment could produce an infinite monopulse ratio, the 
corresponding angle estimate could not be infinite. Therefore the rms value of the 
angle error is finite and its maximum possible value is of the order of the beam-
width. 
For purposes of error analysis, the nonlinear function d/s versus angle can be 
linearized about the target angle provided the deviation θ of the target direction 
from the boresight direction is small compared to the beamwidth. Then the angle 
error as a fraction of the beamwidth is obtained by dividing the error in the mo-
nopulse ratio by the monopulse slope:

(10.9) 
In these equations εθ  and εd/s are the errors in angle and monopulse ratio respec-
tively, θbw is the one-way 3-dB beamwidth of the sum pattern in the same units as 
εθ, and km is the monopulse slope in volts/volt/beamwidth; that is, the slope of the 
curve of d/s versus angle in beamwidths. Since εd/s is complex in general, εθ is also 
complex. Normally, however, εθ is interpreted to mean only the real part. 
The value of km that should be used is the slope at the target angle. If the tar-
get is off axis, this may differ considerably from the slope at boresight. In the 
AN/FPS-16 radar, for example, the d/s ratio, obtained from (6.8) and (6.9), is

boresight axis (θ = 0) the slope is 1.62 volts/volt/beamwidth. At one-half beam-
width off axis it is 1.42 volts/volt/beamwidth. 
10.1.5 
Bias in Monopulse Ratio 
Although each of the noise variables has a circular normal distribution with zero 
mean value, the mean value of the resulting error is not zero. Correlated noise has 
a “pulling” effect similar to that of an unresolved second target, and uncorrelated 
sum noise also contributes a bias that can be significant at low signal-to-noise 
ratios. 
The bias in the monopulse ratio d/s is the average of εd/s over the distributions 
of the noise variables. The contribution of ndu to the error, from (10.7), is given by 
ndu/(s+ nsu + nc). If this is averaged over the distribution of ndu while the other two 
noise variables are held constant, the result is zero by symmetry, and since this is 
true for all combinations of values of the other variables, we conclude that the 
uncorrelated component of the difference noise does not contribute to the bias: 
 
Bias due to nsu = 0 
(10.12) 
In determining the contributions of nsu and nc to the bias, the analysis is sim-
plified and insight is gained by first treating each one separately as if the other 
were absent. (The presence or absence of the uncorrelated difference noise does 
not matter.) Consider first the correlated component nc. The error it produces, 
again referring to (10.7), with ndu and nsu set equal to zero, is

Comparing this with the analysis in Section 9.10 for the bias due to an unresolved 
second target, we find that if |nc/s| < 1, the average error over uniformly distrib-
uted phase is zero, and if |nc/s| > 1, the average is c − d/s. The latter is the differ-

Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
ence of the monopulse ratios of the jammer (or equivalent noise source) and the 
target, which is approximately proportional to their angular separation. The bias 
due to correlated noise is c − d/s multiplied by the fraction of the time that |nc| 
exceeds |s|. 
Since nc has a circular normal distribution, its magnitude has a Rayleigh dis-
tribution with probability density function given by

where Nc is the average power of the correlated component of sum noise nc. This 
is equivalent to the result obtained in [1, Eq. (40)], for a steady target and an ex-
ternal point source of noise at angles that produce monopulse ratios d/s and c re-
spectively. If the source is at the same angle as the target, it causes no error. Oth-
erwise, there is a “pulling” effect approximately proportional to the angular sepa-
ration and inversely proportional to the exponential of the ratio of signal power to 
average noise power. Note that the bias is less than predicted by the power-
weighted centroid approximation sometimes employed. For example, if the signal 
power and noise power are equal, that approximation gives a bias of half the sepa-
ration, while (10.15) gives a bias of 0.37 times the separation. 
If either c or d/s happens to be complex, the mean of the monopulse ratio is 
complex and the bias is complex. Only the real part is used unless some special 
application requires both the real and imaginary parts. 
Returning now to (10.7), we examine the effect of the uncorrelated sum noise 
nsu, on the assumption that nc is zero (but ndu need not be zero). This is analyzed in 
the same way as nc, the only difference being in the coefficient. The result is

where Nsu is the average power of the uncorrelated component of sum noise nsu. 
In system error analysis the internally generated sum and difference noises 
are usually assumed to be uncorrelated, on the grounds that any correlated com-
ponent that they may have is presumably negligible. In this case the bias is given 
by (10.17). For a target on the axis, d/s is zero and the bias is therefore zero, as 
expected because of symmetry. For a target at an angle where d/s = ±1 (a little 
more than one-half beamwidth from boresight), with a signal-to-noise power ratio 
of 10, the bias according to (10.17) is less than 5 ± 10−5 volt/volt, which is entirely 
negligible. At a signal-to-noise ratio of 4 = 6 dB, the bias is 0.018 volt/volt, or 
about 0.01 beamwidth, which may not be negligible. At a signal-to-noise ratio of 
1 = 0 dB, the bias is 0.37 volt/volt, or about one-sixth of a beamwidth. 
Equations (10.16) and (10.17) are useful in understanding and calculating the 
effects of either nc or nsu alone when the other is absent or negligible, but they are 
not additive when both are present. The exact result for the total bias has been 
worked out by Kanter [2]:

Here Ns is the total sum-channel noise power and ρ is the correlation coefficient

ponent of the difference-channel noise does not affect the bias. 
10.1.6 
Exact Solution for Probability Density Function of d/s 
The desired measure of error is the root-mean-squared (rms) value: the combined 
effect of the mean error (bias) and the standard deviation from the mean. In con-
trast to the simple, exact formula for the bias, given by (10.18), there is no exact 
formula for the standard deviation of the noise-corrupted monopulse ratio; in fact 
the standard deviation does not exist, mathematically speaking. An exact expres-
sion for the probability density function (pdf) of the noise-corrupted monopulse 
ratio was derived by Kanter [2]. His analysis is general enough to cover a steady 
target anywhere in the beam, unequal noise powers in the sum and difference 
channels, any degree of correlation between sum channel and difference channel, 

234 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
and any signal-to-nose ratio. He showed that the distribution has a bias (as shown 
in the preceding subsection), that it is skewed (asymmetric), and that in theory it 
has infinite standard deviation. His results apply not only to single-pulse estimates 
but also to the average of n “looks” or pulses. Even for single-pulse estimates the 
equation by which the pdf is computed is rather complicated.  
The reason for the infinite standard deviation is that for large values of the ra-
tio the pdf falls off as the inverse third power of the ratio. When the pdf is multi-
plied by the square of the ratio and integrated over infinite limits in order to calcu-
late the variance, the integrand falls off only as the reciprocal of the ratio and the 
integral increases as the logarithm of the ratio. 
In lieu of the standard deviation it is possible to define an alternate measure 
of spread such as the standard deviation of a Gaussian distribution that fits the 
actual distribution in some sense. For example, a Gaussian random variable lies 
between the “one-sigma” values (one standard deviation above and below the 
mean) with probability 0.68 and in each tail of the distribution with probability 
0.16. For the actual noise error distribution one can define an “equivalent sigma” 
as half the interval within which the integral of the pdf is 0.68. This definition 
permits the limits to “slide” as long as they bound an area of 0.68 under the pdf 
curve, so an additional constraint must be imposed. Because the distribution is 
skewed, whichever interval is chosen cannot satisfy more than one of the follow-
ing conditions: symmetrical limits above and below the mean; equal area, 0.34, 
between the mean and each limit; or equal area in each tail. The “equivalent 
sigma” will vary with the choice of interval. Furthermore, the result will be differ-
ent if, for example, the “equivalent sigma” is redefined as one-fourth of an inter-
val in which the probability is 0.95, corresponding to the interval between the 
“two-sigma” points in a Gaussian distribution. Kanter chose as a measure of 
spread, for comparison with the standard deviation computed by an approximate 
formula, one-half the interval containing an area of 0.68, placed so as to give an 
area of 0.16 in each tail. 
In actual practice, the standard deviation of the monopulse ratio cannot be in-
finite. The measured values of the monopulse ratio are always finite because of 
the finite dynamic range of the equipment and computations. Even if infinite val-
ues of the monopulse ratio were possible, they would not correspond to infinite 
angles. As explained in Section 10.1.4, the standard deviation of the angle error is 
finite and its maximum possible value is of the order of the beamwidth. 
Although the exact analysis does not yield a practical formula for the standard 
deviation, the measure of spread adopted by Kanter does agree well, at high sig-
nal-to-noise ratios, with the approximate formula for standard deviation, as illus-
trated by a set of comparative curves included in the paper. Thus, the exact solu-
tion serves as a partial check. In addition, it leads to the simple exact formula for 
the bias given in (10.18).

10.1.7 
First-Order Approximation for S/N >> 1 
Experience has shown that fairly simple approximate formulas usually are ade-
quate for performance prediction provided they are properly interpreted and used. 
In their simplest form, based on a first-order approximation, they are in close 
agreement with the exact calculation at high signal-to-noise ratios (above about 
10 dB). By inclusion of second-order terms they can be used also for lower signal-
to-noise ratios approaching 0 dB. 
In (10.7) divide the numerator and denominator by s and let v (with appropri-
ate subscripts) denote the normalized noise variates: vdu = ndu/s, and so forth. Then

The first-order approximation is based on the assumption that the signal-to-
noise ratio in the sum channel is so high that the amplitude of the total sum-
channel noise consisting of its correlated and uncorrelated components, is (almost 
always) much less than the amplitude of the sum signal, and therefore the noise 
terms in the denominator of (10.7) can be neglected, so that

(10.20) 
Conversion of (10.20) to a more usable formula involves a number of rela-
tionships and algebraic steps, the details of which are omitted here but can be out-
lined as follows.  
1.  
Each of the three noise variates has zero mean, and therefore 
εd/s has zero mean. Because of the assumption of high S/N ra-
tio, the bias (Section 10.1.5) does not appear in this approxima-
tion. (It does, however, appear in the higher-order approxima-
tion discussed later.) 
2.  
The symbols s, d, and n (with appropriate subscripts) represent 
voltage amplitudes. To obtain the desired formula each voltage 
amplitude is converted to average power, which is one-half of 
the mean squared voltage amplitude, as shown in Section 
10.1.3. 
3.  
Since each noise variate has a circular normal distribution, the 
entire complex error εd/s has a circular normal distribution, and 
because the three noise components are uncorrelated with one 

236 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
another, the sum of the mean squared values of the terms on the 
right side of (10.20) is the mean squared value of εd/s. 
4.  
Although (10.20) applies even if c and d/s are complex, they 
are real under normal conditions and are treated as such.  
5.  
In the conversion from voltages to powers the quantity in pa-
rentheses, (c – d/s), is squared and expanded. Correlated and 
uncorrelated sum-noise powers Nsu and Nc are added and ex-
pressed as total sum-noise power Ns. Similarly, the difference-
noise power components Ndu and c2Nc are added and expressed 
as Nd. 
Equation (10.20) then becomes:

where σd/s is the rms value of the error in the monopulse ratio. It is seen that the 
error consists of three components: a first-order noise term inversely proportional 
to the ratio S/Nd of signal to difference-channel noise, a term for off-axis mea-
surement inversely proportional to the ratio S/Ns of signal to sum-channel noise, 
and an off-axis correlated noise term inversely proportional to the ratio S/(cNc) of 
signal to correlated noise. 
Taking the square-root of both sides of (10.21) and rearranging, we obtain:

If the correlated noise is from a jammer, it will typically be much larger than 
the signal; in that case, these equations do not apply, since they assume a high S/N 
ratio. The jamming problem is treated in Chapter 12. If the correlated noise is 
from the local oscillator, it is essentially equal in the matched sum and difference 
channels, which means that c = 1; the uncorrelated noise power is also equal in 
both channels. Therefore Ns = Nd = N, and (10.22) is simplified to

In practice, the internally generated correlated noise (from the local oscillator, 
for example) is not normally measured separately but is considered small enough 
to be simply included as part of the receiver noise. Then the last term in (10.23) 
can be omitted. 
A further simplification can be made when the tracking is known to be on or 
near boresight; the entire bracketed quantity can then be considered equal to 1 and 
omitted, leaving only the first-order noise term. 
The final step is to convert the error εd/s to angle error as explained in Section

Equation (10.24), with or without the last term, is a commonly used formula. 
In other literature it has been derived in a simpler manner by adopting the neces-

mits application to nonstandard conditions—for example, if the sum and differ-
ence noises are known to be unequal. In particular, it should be noted that the S/N 
inside the radical is the ratio of sum-signal power to difference-channel noise.

Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
In the absence of an external point source of noise it is usually assumed that 
the correlation is zero, on the grounds that the local oscillator and mixers are pre-
sumably designed to contribute very little noise, and external noise from a distrib-
uted source such as the sky is essentially uncorrelated in the sum and difference 
channels. Furthermore, even if there is some correlation, it adds a term to the 
mean squared error when the target is on one side of the axis and subtracts the 
same term when the target is at the same angle on the other side, so that the over-
all mean squared error is the same as without correlation. 
10.1.8 
Higher-Order Approximation for S/N > 1 
Returning to (10.21) we now assume that the sum-channel signal-to-noise ratio is 
not high enough to justify neglecting the noise terms in the denominator, but high 
enough to allow the assumption that the ratio of sum-noise amplitude to sum-
signal amplitude is (almost) always less than unity:

Each noise variate is decomposed into its real and imaginary parts, and after all 
multiplications are carried out, the real terms are collected. The resulting expres-
sion is then squared and averaged. The mean square value equals the variance 
because the mean of each term before squaring is zero. The procedure is similar to 
that described in the preceding section except that the real part of the error now 
includes higher-order terms containing cross-products and squares of the noise 
variates. The following relations are used in deriving the average:

If the signal-to-noise ratio is 10 dB (N/S = 0.1), the second-order term increases 
the variance by 10% and the standard deviation by about 5%, which is not usually 
significant in an error analysis. However, if the signal-to-noise ratio is only 3 dB, 
the second-order term increases the variance by 50% and the standard deviation 
by 22%. 
If the target is near the edge of the beam, where |d/s| ≈ 1, then instead of

Inclusion of the 1.5N/S term in this case increases the standard deviation by 7% 
and 32% at 10 dB and 3 dB signal-to-noise ratio respectively. 
The low-signal-to-noise correction factor 1 + N/S in (10.38) for the on-axis 
case appears also elsewhere in the radar literature, explained in a somewhat dif-
ferent manner. In [3] it is called an “AGC factor,” referring to the fact that in a 
system where AGC provides the monopulse normalization, the AGC responds to 
signal plus noise in the sum channel rather than to signal alone. 
Although (10.37) is a better approximation than (10.21) because the expan-
sion is carried out to second-degree noise terms, it still rests on the assumption 
that the ratio of sum-noise amplitude to sum-signal amplitude is always less than 
unity. The error due to neglect of the tails of the distribution, where noise ampli-
tude exceeds signal amplitude, increases with decreasing signal-to-noise ratio. At 
5-dB signal-to-noise ratio, noise exceeds signal only 4% of the time; at 3-dB, 14% 
of the time; and at 0 dB, 37% of the time. The validity of the formula at 0 dB or 
below becomes questionable, and should be verified by analysis or simulation 
using the characteristics of the actual system, including the monopulse ratio as a 
function of angle.

Multiple-Pulse Estimates 
The preceding analyses have considered only the single-pulse monopulse esti-
mates of target position. In most monopulse applications, however, the estimates 
are averaged over n pulses:

(10.43) 
where fr is the pulse repetition frequency and to = 1/2βn is the averaging time, βn 
being the (one-sided) noise bandwidth of the tracking loop. 
In the absence of correlated noise components, the variance of the n-pulse av-
erage is simply 1/n times the single-pulse value. This relationship is correct for the 
case in which the noise is generated in components within the separate sum- and 
difference-channel receivers, or in the outside environment by sources that are 
spread over the mainlobes of the sum and difference patterns, giving uncorrelated 
sum and difference components. For this case, the n-pulse error can be expressed 
from (10.24) by setting c = 0 and inclusion of the factor n within the radical in the 
denominator:

Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
Presence of a correlated noise component, however, causes the bias error 
given by (10.18), and additional noise components from (10.24) and (10.37) that 
are not reduced by the n-pulse averaging. Correlated noise can be introduced by 
the common local oscillator or by an external source within a narrow angle in 
space. We will see this effect when considering noise jamming (Chapter 12), and 
also in errors caused by clutter (see Section 10.2). 
For high S/N, the tracking-loop bandwidth βn is held constant at a design 
value βn0 by the monopulse processor, using, for example, AGC and a dot-product 
detector (Section 8.8). The bandwidth is reduced, however, when the single-pulse 
signal-to-noise ratio S/N approaches unity. Two factors reduce the loop gain at 
low S/N: the normalization method in the receiver fails to hold constant the sum 
signal into the processor that forms |d|/s|, and the useful signal in that processor is 
further suppressed by the presence of noise [4, pp. 467–472]. The loop bandwidth 
varies with reduced S/N:

as S/N drops to and below zero. Loss of track occurs not as a result of a large in-
crease in noise error as predicted by (10.44), but rather by failure of the loop to 
follow target dynamics (see Section 10.3). This can be observed in actual opera-
tion of a mechanically steered monopulse radar, where the random antenna motion 
after disappearance of the target is limited to a small fraction of the beamwidth. 
10.1.10 
Fluctuating Targets 
If the target fluctuates, the sum-signal power S (which is proportional to the target 
cross section) is a random variable. For a single-pulse angle estimate the preced-
ing angle-error equations still would be correct if the value of S on that pulse were 
used. However, the value of S on each pulse is unknown; only the average value is 
assumed to be known or specified, and the error formula must be expressed in 
terms of the average of S. It turns out that the standard deviation of the error for a 
fluctuating target generally is larger than for a steady target having the same aver-
age cross section, although if multiple-pulse averaging is performed with proper

weighting the fluctuating target error approaches that of the steady target as the 
number of pulses is increased. 
The effect of fluctuation on any of the errors derived in previous sections can 
be calculated by expressing the error variance as

nator is unity.) Dividing (10.50) by (10.48) gives the ratio of the fluctuating-target 
variance to the steady-target variance, if the average signal power is the same for 
both cases. We can apply this procedure to the most common models [5] for target 
fluctuation.

The results of the integration (10.50) are shown in Figure 10.1. The Case 1 error 
increases steadily as the threshold drops below the average signal power, while for 
Case 3 the error levels off at 
2  times the steady-target error. Basically, the im-
provement in accuracy as average signal increases for the fluctuating target does 
not keep pace with that for a steady target.

 Figure 10.2 also shows values for K = 2 (Case 3) 
and K = 4, which could be obtained if two independent samples of Case 4 or four 
independent samples of Case 2, obtained by time or frequency diversity, were 
averaged in forming the d/s ratio. That amount of averaging reduces the error to 
very near the steady-target value. 
It is only recently that monopulse radars have been deployed that actually 
form measurements on a single pulse, and the possible penalty in tracking Case 1 
targets can be significant. By using frequency diversity to obtain independent tar-
get samples and applying an AGC or other process that normalizes the d/s ratio 
over more than one pulse this penalty can be avoided, providing time is available 
to transmit and receive more than one pulse per beam dwell.

Monopulse Angle Errors 
245 
The “I and Q” type of processor described in Section 8.6 is an example in 
which averaging may be applied. For a single-pulse angle estimate this processor 
performs the arithmetic indicated by (8.9) to obtain the monopulse ratio. The nu-
merator in the fraction in that equation is the “dot-product” of the difference and 
the sum; the denominator is the sum-signal power. For a weighted average the 
weight given to each pulse is equal to the sum-signal power of the pulse divided 
by the summation of the sum-signal powers of all the pulses. Hence, the numera-
tor of the weight cancels the denominator of the monopulse ratio. The multiple-
pulse estimate turns out to be simply the sum of all the numerators divided by the 
sum of all the denominators, which avoids the division process on each pulse. 
This result is then converted to an angle estimate by means of the monopulse cali-
bration function. 
An analog counterpart is the processor described in Section 8.8, consisting of 
a dot-product detector operating on each pulse and a relatively slow AGC, in 
which the time constant is chosen to correspond to the desired length of the multi-
ple-pulse dwell. The AGC should not be slower than the servo response, which in 
turn must be a compromise between noise and lag errors. In effect, the servo filter 
sums (averages) the dot-products and the AGC filter sums (averages) the pulse 
powers, and the AGC action divides the first sum by the second. The result is 
analogous to that described above for the “I and Q” processor. 
As the number of pulses used in the pulse-power-weighted averaging is in-
creased, the standard deviation of error of a fluctuating target with a specified 
average cross section approaches that of a steady target with the same cross sec-

tion, provided the same number of pulses is used in both cases. The same error 
formulas that apply to a steady target, such as (10.24) or (10.42), can then be used 
for fluctuating targets by substituting S for S and inserting the factor n (the num-
ber of pulses) under the square-root sign. 
In practice, the weighting actually achieved is not quite the same as the opti-
mum weighting, because instead of being proportional to signal power it is pro-
portional to signal-plus-noise power. Similarly, if there is a threshold, it acts on 
the signal plus noise rather than on signal alone as the analysis assumes. Hence, 
the results are not exactly as described above. However, if the pulse-to-pulse fluc-
tuation is due mainly to the target cross section variation rather than to noise, as is 
normally true at large or moderate S N ratios this approximation has only slight 
effect. 
To calculate the bias error for single-pulse angle estimates on a fluctuating 
target, start with the steady-target bias formula (10.18) but regard S as a random 
variable rather than a constant. Multiply the right-hand side of (10.18) by the pdf 
of S and integrate. If there is a threshold power level T, the integral is from T to 
infinity, and it must be divided by the integral of the pdf between the same limits. 
As a simple example, consider a Swerling Case 1 or Case 2 target, for which the 
pdf is given by (10.52).This pdf is the same as that of noise except that in the case 
of noise the average signal power S is replaced by the average noise power N. For 
T = 0, the following result is obtained after conversion to angle:

Comparison of (10.54) with (10.18) shows that the fluctuating target has a larger 
bias than a steady target at the same (average) cross section at the same angle. A 
uniformly weighted average estimate from n pulses has the same bias as for a sin-
gle pulse. If averaging could be done over multiple pulses yielding independent 
samples, with ideal weighting proportional to signal power, the bias would be 
reduced; the formula would be

In practice, however, the weighting of each pulse can be made proportional to 
signal-plus-noise power but not to signal power alone. When this fact is taken into 
account in the analysis [7], the bias of the power-weighted average is found to be 
the same as the single-pulse bias given by (10.54).

10.1.11 
“Inexact” Monopulse Processors 
The analysis has assumed that the output of the monopulse processor is exactly 
equal (or proportional) to the real part of the monopulse ratio. Some of the practi-
cal processors described in Chapter 8 follow this behavior very closely; others 
approximate it only at high signal-to-noise ratios, real values of d/s, and target 
angles not too far from the axis. Where these conditions are not met, a more de-
tailed analysis or simulation may be required, using the equations developed in 
Chapter 8 for each processor. 
10.1.12 
Closed-Loop Versus Open-Loop Operation 
The equations developed in this chapter have been based on open-loop operation; 
that is, it has been assumed that the beam pointing direction does not change in 
response to the indicated off-axis angle. The target angle is estimated by convert-
ing the measured monopulse ratio to an angle and adding that angle to the known 
pointing angle of the beam axis. The error is the deviation of the indicated angle 
from the true angle. 
In closed-loop operation a servo uses the monopulse ratio as an error signal 
and attempts to null it by causing the beam axis to point toward the target. The 
error in that case is the deviation of the beam axis from the true target direction. 
As the beam moves relative to the target, the signal power and monopulse slope 
change, so the error in beam pointing direction is not exactly the same as the 
open-loop error. At high signal-to-noise ratios the difference is usually so slight 
that the open-loop formulas can be applied also to closed-loop operation, provided 
the appropriate value of n (number of pulses effectively averaged by the servo 
time constant) is inserted, as discussed in Section 10.1.9. At low signal-to-noise, 
changes occur in the monopulse slope and servo loop characteristics and must be 
taken into account [3, 8]. 
10.2 
ERRORS DUE TO CLUTTER 
Clutter is normally assumed to originate from scatterers that are broadly distrib-
uted in one or both angular coordinates. Surface clutter is distributed in azimuth 
over the entire main-lobe region of the sum and difference patterns; precipitation 
clutter or chaff is distributed over the elevation patterns as well, except for track-
ing near the lower or upper altitude limits of the clutter.

Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
10.2.1 
Random Error from Clutter Distributed Across the Beam 
When the clutter is uniformly distributed over the angular extent of the main dif-
ference lobes, or over two or more sidelobes, the clutter in the sum channel is un-
correlated with that in the difference channel. Denote the rms clutter error on a 
single measurement sample by σθc1, where the subscripts identify angle error from 
clutter on a single pulse. The equation for the rms value of the monopulse ratio d/s 
is the same as for uncorrelated thermal noise error (10.37) with noise powers Ns 
and Nd replaced by the corresponding clutter powers. Including the second-order 
terms that allow for low sum-channel signal-to-clutter ratios S/Cs, we find:

where Cs is clutter power in the sum channel, Cd is clutter power in the difference 
channel, and d/s is the monopulse ratio corresponding to an off-axis target. The 
fraction preceding the large radical in (10.56) represents the first-order clutter er-
ror. The product of that error and the second term in the radical is the second-
order error component. The product of first-order error and the third term in the 
large radical is the off-axis error component, including its first- and second-order 
components. Clutter powers in this expression are evaluated after any Doppler 
processing, which must be applied by linear circuits with identical response in the 
sum and difference channels.  
When tracking a target near the beam axis, the terms in (10.56) that include 
d/s may be neglected to obtain an expression for first- and second-order clutter 
errors:

where the subscript on σ denotes the angle error from clutter for the on-axis, sin-

Unlike thermal noise, clutter echoes are characterized by a correlation time 
that may extend over many successive pulses, so the number of independent clut-
ter samples is reduced from n = frto given by (10.43) to a value ni given in Section 
10.2.2. The clutter error of (10.57) is reduced by a factor
in with averaging over 
the time constant of the tracking loop, resulting in an averaged error, for Cd uncor-
related with Cs, given by

The ratio of clutter power in the difference channel to that in the sum channel 
is normally ≈ 0.63 = −2 dB, which is the ratio of integrals of the product of sum 
and difference power patterns s2(θ)d 2(θ) to the two-way sum power pattern s4(θ). 
An exception is in elevation measurement with precipitation or chaff clutter, 
where Cd at the output of Doppler processor may exceed Cs because of the broader 
clutter spectrum produced by wind shear in the elevation difference pattern. For 
clutter in the sidelobes, the ratio of difference- to sum-channel power is usually 
greater than unity because of higher difference sidelobes. 
In off-axis measurement, the terms that include d/s in (10.56) increase the er-
ror in clutter, as was also the case with thermal noise. The single-pulse off-axis 
clutter error can be considered as the rss sum of σθca1 from (10.57) and an off-axis 
error component given by

Number of Independent Clutter Samples 
The sum-channel output s + cs is used as a reference in phase-sensitive detection 
of the difference-channel clutter cd (after any Doppler processing of both chan-
nels). The clutter correlation time in each channel is

where λ is the wavelength and σv is the rms velocity spread resulting from internal 
motion, beam scanning, and (for precipitation or chaff) wind shear. Hence the 
number of independent clutter samples available for averaging over the time con-
stant of the tracking loop may vary, depending on the relative target-to-clutter 
velocity, between limiting values:

where to = 1/2βn is the time constant of the tracking loop.  
For example, consider an X-band radar tracking a target over land clutter, 
with the following characteristics: 
•

λ = 0.03m; 
• 
PRF  
fr = 300 Hz; 
• 
Servo bandwidth  
βn = 3 Hz; 
• 
No Doppler processing. 
A typical velocity spread for land clutter, σv ≈ 0.5 m/s, gives, from (10.61), a clut-
ter correlation time tc = 12 ms at the radar input. The averaging time for a loop 
bandwidth βn = 3 Hz is to = 0.167s, setting the lower limit of nc at 15. The upper 
limit is frto = 50, resulting in 15 ≤ ni ≤ 50. It should be kept in mind that the corre-
lation time of clutter residue is reduced by Doppler processing, and may fall be-
low the pulse repetition interval 1/fr, in which case the upper limit for ni applies.

10.2.3 
Random Error from Clutter at a Specific Angle in the Beam 
Surface clutter in a given range gate appears at a fixed elevation angle located 
below the tracking axis, either in the mainlobe region or in one of the lower 
sidelobes. In this case Cs and Cd are mutually correlated. The variance of single-
pulse error for correlated sum and difference clutter is found from (10.37) by re-
placing noise terms with clutter and converting to angle error:

(10.66) 
The significance of (10.66) was first appreciated when a monopulse radar us-
ing wideband frequency agility with large ni was found to have a larger than ex-
pected error component in tracking at low elevation angle over land clutter. Con-
sider a tracking radar with the following characteristics:  
• 
Beamwidth  
θbw = 1.7° = 30 mrad; 
• 
PRF 
 fr = 2000 Hz; 
• 
Servo bandwidth  
βn = 3 Hz; 
• 
Error slope  
km = 1.6; 
• 
Pulsewidth  
τ = 1 μs; 
• 
Agile bandwidth 
 Δf = 500 MHz. 
The potential number of independent clutter samples in frequency is Δfτ = 500, 
but from (10.62) the maximum number of samples is nif = 333 for samples uncor-
related from pulse to pulse. Assume a track over land clutter with S/C = S/Cd = 10 
and complete correlation. The single-sample error from (10.57) is σθca1 = 4.4 
mrad. Mistakenly applying (10.58), on the assumption of uncorrelated clutter, 
leads to a reduction factor of 18 from averaging, giving σθcan = 0.24 mrad, essen-
tially all from the first-order term. However, the actual error from (10.66) is 
σθcan = 1.3 mrad, more than five times as large, resulting from the second-order 
term having no reduction from averaging. 

252 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
Correlation between sum- and difference-channel clutter normally occurs in 
elevation measurement over surface clutter in a particular range gate, which is 
concentrated at a single elevation angle below the target. The same expression 
applies to azimuth tracking when there is a dominant discrete scatterer offset in 
azimuth from the target. 
10.2.4 
Bias Error Due to Clutter 
Correlated clutter also causes a bias error εc in the measurement, similar to that 
from noise as given in (10.18):

Using parameters from the preceding example, the error is less than 1 μrad, but

10.3 
DYNAMIC LAG ERROR 
One of the advantages listed in Section 1.4 for monopulse radar is the increased 
data rate provided by angle measurements on each received pulse, as compared to 
sequential scanning methods. The data rate is one of the factors that establish the 
bandwidth of the angle tracking loops of a tracking radar. That bandwidth in turn 
controls the dynamic lag error in following a target with given velocity and accel-
eration. 
10.3.1 
Tracking-Loop Error Coefficients

celeration, and higher derivatives of the measured coordinate. In azimuth A,

Similar expressions apply to the elevation coordinate. The error coefficients Kv, 
Ka, K3, … are determined by the open- and closed-loop frequency response of the 

 
Monopulse Angle Errors 
253 
tracker servo loop in the coordinate under consideration (see, for example, [3, pp. 
295–301]). Figure 10.3 shows the open-loop servo response of a typical antenna 
servo. High gain at low frequencies is necessary to overcome torque disturbances 
and lag in following high-velocity targets. A region with a slope of −20 
dB/decade, extending about two octaves each side of the unity-gain crossover, is 
necessary to provide stability.  
The locations of break points in the open-loop response (at ω1, ω2, ω3) control 
the error coefficients and closed-loop bandwidth. The velocity error coefficient is 
the intersection of the low-frequency −20-dB/decade slope with the 0-dB gain axis 
at ωv = 500 rad/s, giving Kv = 500 s−1. The intersection of the −40-dB/decade slope 
at mid-frequency with the 0-dB gain axis at ωa = 10 rad/s gives Ka = ωa
2 = 100 s−2. 
The second −20-dB/decade slope crosses the 0-dB gain axis at ωc ≈ 2ωa = 20 rad/s 
(or 3.2 Hz), and the noise bandwidth βn of the servo is typically about twice this 
value: ωn = 4ωa = 40 rad/s, giving βn = 40/2π = 6.4 Hz in this case. 
There is no upper limit to the velocity error coefficient Kv, but the practical 
value is limited by the duration of the transient when tracking is initiated. The 
acceleration error constant is limited by the closed-loop servo bandwidth βn:

essary).

Consider a target flying at a ground range R = 30 km with velocity vt = 300 
m/s and acceleration at = 20 m/s2, both in the horizontal plane and normal to the 
line of sight. For βn = 3 Hz, Ka = 22.5, and Kv = 300 and the azimuth lag error is

This error seems very small, but the lag would be a significant contributor to error

10.3.2 
Pass-Course Problem 
The angular rate and acceleration of a target in radar (spherical) coordinates de-
pend on the target dynamics and its range from the radar. The classic pass-course 
problem is illustrated in Figure 10.4. The target travels at a constant velocity vt

For example, a subsonic aircraft flying at a constant velocity vt = 300 m/s along a 
path with crossover range Rc = 10 km will have maximum azimuth rate ωa z = 0.03 
rad/s at crossover, and maximum acceleration of ±0.000585 rad/s2. A radar with 
the same servo response assumed in the earlier example would incur lag error 
components of 0.1 mrad in velocity and 0.026 mrad in acceleration. 
Tracking-loop bandwidths of 3 Hz, as in the examples above, are normally 
available in conical scanning radars as well as in monopulse, so there is no special 
monopulse advantage in these examples. However, in tracking targets with higher 
accelerations, such as antiair missiles that may accelerate at 20g = 196 m/s2, the 
error for βn = 3 Hz would be 0.9 mrad at R = 10 km. A bandwidth of 9 Hz reduces 
this to 0.1 mrad, but such bandwidth is not available with the usual conical-scan 
frequency of 30–60 Hz. 
As noted in Section 10.1.9, the servo loop bandwidth is reduced from its de-
sign value (available at high S/N ratio) as S/N drops below about 6 dB. The band-
width reduction causes the output noise to level off as S/N drops below unity, as 
indicated by (10.47). The dynamic lag component from target velocity, however, 
varies as 1/βn, and that from acceleration as 1/βn
2, or as (1 + N/S)4. The result is 
loss of track on dynamic targets for S/N < 0 dB.

RADAR-DEPENDENT ERRORS  
Table 10.1 listed sources of error that are dependent on the radar design. These are 
described in [4], and those that are specific to monopulse radars will be discussed 
here. Stability of the monopulse boresight axis is a major factor in bias error. 
10.4.1 
Monopulse Network Effects on the Boresight Axis  
Boresight errors caused by faulty implementation of the monopulse networks and 
receivers are discussed in [8, pp. 208–210]. The monopulse comparator, receivers 
and processor are represented by the block diagram shown in Figure 10.5, where 
d1 and d2 are network errors before and after the comparator.  
The precomparator errors, between the input horns (or array elements) and 
the comparator, change that portion of the sum-channel response from unity to:

unity to

Keeping in mind that a2 is the allowable departure from unity of the ratio of the 
two receiver gains and φ2 is their relative phase, this expression defines the allow-
able gain and phase tracking tolerances of the receivers for a given boresight error. 
The tolerance is inversely proportional to the corresponding precomparator error.  
Receiver gain and phase tend to vary as a function of signal level, tempera-
ture of the receiver enclosure, and power supply voltages. Assuming that the re-
sulting errors vary slowly, randomly and independently during a tracking opera-
tion, with rms values σa2 and σφ2, the rms tracking error is

• 
a1 = 0.04; 
• 
φ1 = 0.04 rad; 
• 
Allowable error σθr = 0.002θbw = 0.04 mrad. 

 
Monopulse Angle Errors

Setting equally strict tolerances on receiver gain and phase, we find σa2 = 0.113, 
corresponding to 0.93 dB and σφ2 = 0.113 rad = 6.5°. Any other combination hold-
ing σa2
2 + σφ2
2 ≤ 0.026 would suffice.  
Depending on the operating conditions and the allowable errors, it may be 
necessary to incorporate into the receivers a pilot pulse control loop. This tech-
nique monitors the gain and phase errors by inserting into couplers at the input to 
the two receivers, at a time outside the target tracking range gate, pulses of equal 
phase whose equal amplitudes approximate those of the signal being tracked. Out-
put errors are measured and corrected continuously with controlled gain and 
phase-shift elements. 
10.4.2 
Boresight Axis Shift with Radar Frequency 
If the electrical axis of the radar is stable over long periods of time, the accuracy 
with which it can be collimated (adjusted to match the mechanical axis) is de-
pendent primarily upon the care and patience that are exercised in calibration. 
Comparisons of the electrical axis with boresight telescope observations on visible 
targets can be made over a period of time and over a range of operating conditions 
such that noise components of error are averaged to very low values. This process 
is especially accurate if photographic or TV readings are taken from the telescope 
while a point-source target is being tracked at relatively high elevation angle, 
where multipath and propagation errors are minimized. The residual errors are 
caused by drift components that change between calibrations. These can be the 
result of variation in several operating parameters of the radar and of environ-
mental factors such as uneven heating of the radar components. In a complete 
error analysis, the variation in position of the axis must be determined as a func-
tion of the following: 
1.  
Frequency of operation within the radar band; 
2.  
Tuning of the system (center IF frequency); 
3  
Phase or gain variations in the receiver; 
4.  
Signal strength; 
5.  
Temperature or intensity of solar (thermal) radiation. 
These factors introduce differential gain or phase variations that shift the axis ac-
cording to (10.77) and (10.82). When these effects are known, it is possible to 
devise calibration and collimation procedures, and to estimate the errors remain-
ing in the radar output at various times after calibration.  
Electrical lengths and mismatches in the RF system change as the radar car-
rier frequency is tuned over the operating band, introducing precomparator errors 
as represented by (10.73). For example, consider the experimental curve of Figure 
10.7, which represents the shift in position of the null point in the RF difference 
pattern of the AN/FPS-16 as its operating frequency varies over a 10% band. No 
RF tuning elements are included in the antenna system, so this error can be re-

260 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
duced only by collimation at the frequency to be used, or by applying a calibration 
curve in data processing. Assuming that many different frequencies are used in the 
period between collimations, and that no calibrations are applied to correct for the 
shift, the error can be expressed as the rms value of the curve shown, or about 
0.05 mrad. This presumes that the frequency chosen for collimation gives an error 
near zero.  
When the operating frequency is different from that used in collimation, er-
rors εel in elevation and εaz in traverse angle will appear. These errors vary slowly 
with postcomparator gain and phase errors, so over a track they may be repre-
sented by their rms values σθr, according to (10.82). The azimuth error εaz will be 
equal to the traverse bias εtr, at low elevation angles, but will increase as the target 
rises in elevation:

(10.83) 
Although the azimuth error becomes infinite at zenith, the traverse error is con-
stant.  
The electrical boresight also varies with phase changes between the IF stages 
of sum and difference receivers as the downconverted signal at intermediate fre-
quency shifts from that at which the radar was collimated. These receiver errors 
are represented by (10.74), and illustrated in Figure 10.8, which shows the sensi-
tivity of the AN/FPS-16 radar to IF excursions (tuning error). Assuming that col-
limation is done with the system properly tuned, the shift in the tracking axis may 
be estimated for any operating condition that leads to tuning error by assigning to 
the tuning error a probability distribution and calculating the rms value of the cor-
responding error from this figure. The tuning error may arise from Doppler shift, 
drift in the transmitting frequency of a beacon, or uncorrected drifts in the radar 
oscillators. 
Expressing the curve for boresight error as a function of IF frequency, Δ( fIF), the 
rms error can be found by assuming that the tuning error is normally distributed with a 
standard deviation σIF. The rms boresight error is then

Polarization Effects 
Antennas are designed to respond to input waves having a particular polarization 
(e.g., vertical), and there is always one orthogonal polarization (or cross-
polarization) for the antenna (e.g., horizontal). The antenna patterns for a cross-
polarized input will differ from those for the intended polarization, and targets that 
scatter both polarizations when illuminated by the radar transmission will generate 
spurious responses at the antenna output.  
Cross-polarized responses of a reflector antenna, known as Condon lobes, are 
an inherent result of curvature of the reflector, and increase with decreased f/D 
ratio. Cross-polarized response in a circular array results primarily from interac-
tion of edge currents with elements on the periphery, but it can also be caused in 
any array by imperfect construction or orientation of elements themselves. Figure 
10.9 shows typical s and d voltage patterns for the intended polarization, and sc 
and dc for the cross-polarization.

The cross-polarized target cross section for many targets averages about −6 dB 
relative to the intended polarization. Then, for a cross-polarized difference-pattern

TARGET-DEPENDENT NOISE ERRORS 
10.5.1 
Glint Error  
Glint is defined [10] as 
The inherent component of error in measurement of position and/or Doppler fre-
quency of a complex target due to interference of the reflection from different ele-
ments of the target. Notes: 1. Glint may have peak values beyond the target extent 
in the measured coordinate. 2. Not to be confused with scintillation error. 
Since it is inherent in the target, glint affects all types of angle measurement sys-
tems, including monopulse. It will be discussed here because it bears on the 
choice of normalization method and time constant used in monopulse systems. 
The glint from a two-element source was discussed in Sections 5.2.4 and 
5.2.5. The target consisting of two equal point sources is a special case not often 
encountered in practical radar applications. The more general case of multiple 
fluctuating sources has been analyzed in [11]. Let ε be the glint, normalized to 
one-half the target span L in the plane of measurement. The glint is described by a 
Student distribution with two degrees of freedom

(10.87) 
where μ is a parameter measuring the concentration of target scatterers about the 
centroid. The minimum value μ = 1 applies to the two-point target, where all scat-
tered energy comes from the extremities of the target. Larger values of μ charac-
terize targets with scatterers more narrowly distributed about the centroid, as 
shown by solid curves in Figure 10.10.  

264 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
The variance of the Student distribution is infinite, and observations of actual 
targets show large spikes in the monopulse output corresponding to minima of the 
sum-channel signal amplitude s. The probability that the measured position lies 
beyond the target span can be matched by a normal distribution with a standard 
deviation σg expressed as some fraction of the target span L. Approximations are 
shown as dashed lines in the figure, showing standard deviations between 
σg = 0.25L (for a concentrated target, μ = 2.7), σg = 0.33L (for uniform scatterer 
distribution, μ = 
3 ), and σg = 0.5L (for a two-point target, μ = 1). 
The error expressed in terms of the target span L may be converted to an an-
gle error σθg in radians, for a target at range R, using

where N( f ) is the power density per Hz, σθg is the rms angular glint error, Bn is

at X-band are given as 1 Hz for small aircraft and 2.5 Hz for larger aircraft. Spec-
tra for the two bandwidths are shown in Figure 10.11.  
Averaging the sum signal before normalization, method 2, has been shown to 
reduce thermal noise error on fluctuating targets (see Section 10.1.8), by avoiding 
deep minima in the denominator of the monopulse ratio (

cause spikes to appear in the output. A similar advantage is obtained with regard 
to glint error and high S/N ratio when d s is used in tracking fluctuating targets.  
Considering the 6.4-Hz noise bandwidth of the servo whose open-loop trans-
fer functions were shown in Figure 10.1, little smoothing reduction of glint would 
be available. Reducing that bandwidth to βn = 1 Hz would reduce the glint error 
by a factor of two, at the risk of increased dynamic lag error. 
In [13] it was found that option 4 combined with frequency agility gave the 
lowest error, with σθg varying as 1/n for 1 ≤ n ≤ 4 and with only small reductions 
for additional pulses.

Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
Disadvantages accompany each of the glint-reduction options listed above. 
The nonlinear operation inherent in 1 can cause bias errors, since the positive and 
negative spikes that occur with low s do not necessarily have the same shape and 
duration. Averaging in 2 and 3, or selection of one or a few widely-separated 
pulses in 4 reduces the ability of the monopulse system to maintain a constant 
error slope on fluctuating targets, producing scintillation error when the tracking 
axis lags the position of a fast-moving target (see Section 10.5.2). The selection of 
the best process for controlling glint depends on the radar and target parameters 
and the radar application. 
10.5.2 
Scintillation Error 
The term scintillation is applied in the radar context to the fluctuations of target 
amplitude that cause errors in tracking or measurement. The scintillation error is 
defined [10] as 
Error in radar-derived target position or Doppler frequency caused by interaction of 
the scintillation spectrum with frequencies used in sequential measurement tech-
niques Note: Not to be confused with glint. 
This definition describes the first component of scintillation error discussed in 
[3, pp. 289–290], where scintillation components at frequencies near the lobing 
frequency introduce error in sequential lobing systems. The definition omits a 
second error component that appears in both sequential scan and monopulse track-
ing, as presented in [12, 14]. This second component results from scintillation 
components within the bandwidth of the servo that modulate the off-axis error 
voltage on targets whose dynamics cause the track to lag the target. It is analyzed 
in detail in [3, pp. 290–293]. 
The scintillation power spectrum for a typical aircraft target is [14]: 
 
( )

(10.90) 
where A2( f) is the spectral density in (fractional modulation)2/Hz, B is the half-
power bandwidth, and f is frequency in Hz. Values of B vary from 1.0 Hz to 2.5 
Hz, larger values applying to targets with scatterers widely spread over the target 
span. The fractional modulation, found as the square root of the integral of (10.90) 
over all frequencies, is 0.43 times the mean echo signal voltage. 
The object of the AGC is to suppress the target scintillation spectrum A( f ) 
over the response band of the servo. That suppression is described by the scintilla-
tion error factor Ys( f ), defined as the ratio of signal scintillation voltage spectrum 
after AGC relative to that of the target scintillation at the receiver input. This fac-
tor can be written in terms of the open-loop AGC response Ya and the closed-loop 
servo response Yc:

(10.94) 
Use of a normalization such as AGC with a time constant longer that the 
servo time constant (Ys = 1) allows the full scintillation spectrum to modulate the 
lag error. Thus σs ≈ 0.4Δθ for a servo bandwidth greater than the scintillation 
bandwidth, βn > B. 
As the AGC time constant is reduced to approach the pulse repetition interval 
(fast AGC), the scintillation error factor Ys is reduced, allowing only a fraction of 
the target scintillation to modulate the lag error and thereby reducing the scintilla-
tion error. With instantaneous (single-pulse) normalization and high S/N the out-
put signal s from the receiver is held constant (Ys = 0 over the servo bandwidth) 
and the scintillation error disappears.  
The interaction of AGC response with tracking error is analyzed using the 
transfer functions of the AGC and servo loops, illustrated in Figures 10.12 and 
10.13, for slow and fast AGC systems. In each part of the figures, the input and 
output scintillation spectra are plotted along with the functions Ya, Yc, and Ys as 
defined above. 
The slow and fast AGC systems have noise bandwidths of 2 Hz and 8 Hz re-
spectively. The slow AGC open-loop gain falls through 0 dB at 1.3 Hz, and is 
unable to suppress the scintillation components at the upper end of the servo band-
width, allowing the output to rise slightly above the input spectrum in that region. 
The output scintillation voltage for slow AGC is 0.32 (reduced only slightly from 
the value 0.41 for input scintillation within the servo bandwidth). The fast AGC

open-loop gain falls through 0 dB at 5 Hz, and is more successful, reducing the 
output scintillation voltage to 0.16.

Chapter 11 
Multipath 
Multipath is defined [1, p. 714] as the propagation of a wave from one point to 
another by more than one path. When multipath occurs in radar, it usually consists 
of a direct path and one or more indirect paths by reflection from the surface of 
the Earth (land or sea) or from large man-made structures. At frequencies below 
40 MHz it may also include more than one path through the ionosphere. 
If the reflection surface is flat or smoothly rounded, the multipath is specular 
(mirror-like); if the surface is irregular, the multipath is diffuse. When the mean 
contour of the surface is smooth but the surface is perturbed by small-scale irregu-
larities, both specular and diffuse components (also called the coherent and inco-
herent components respectively) are present. 
If, as is usually the case with low-angle targets over a reflecting surface, there 
is not enough separation in angle, range, or Doppler to resolve the direct and re-
flected wave, then specular multipath is equivalent to a special case of unresolved 
targets, and much of the analysis in Chapter 9 is applicable. In the case of multi-
path, however, the “targets” are not independent but are related according to the 
geometry and electrical characteristics of the reflecting surface. 
Specular multipath causes erratic elevation tracking (which sometimes in-
cludes complete loss of track) at target elevations within a beamwidth of the hori-
zon, and causes significant elevation error even at target elevations a few beam-
widths above the horizon. The theory is well known and has been confirmed by a 
large amount of experimental and operational data. The effects are deterministic in 
the sense that if the pertinent radar characteristics, reflection-surface characteris-
tics, and multipath geometry are specified, the results can be computed. Results 
can also be expressed statistically (e.g., in the form of rms error) if they are to 
apply to a specified range of conditions or if the parameters cannot be specified 
exactly.
Diffuse multipath effects are somewhat noise-like (although they are corre-
lated over many successive pulses) and can be treated only statistically, since they 

272 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
are caused by irregularities over the entire surface, the exact contour of which is 
unknown and can vary unpredictably with time (as in the case of waves on water 
or wind-swept vegetation on land). Since the 1970s much serious attention has 
been devoted to the theoretical analysis of diffuse multipath as it affects radar. The 
major work on this subject by Beckmann and Spizzichino [2] has been extended 
[3, 4] to develop a theoretical model that can be used as a basis for calculating the 
errors. The difficulty of the analysis has necessitated some approximations. Ex-
perimental confirmation is also difficult. The data available appear consistent with 
the models, although not conclusive. It is known, however, that although diffuse 
multipath can be a significant item in the error budget, it is not serious enough to 
disrupt tracking. Its main effect is in elevation but it also causes a slight error in 
azimuth (as well as errors in range and Doppler that are not considered here). Dif-
fuse multipath will be discussed in Section 11.14. 
Multipath effects are not limited to monopulse but are similar in all angle-
measuring and tracking techniques.1 However, the method of analysis, the quanti-
tative results, and possible remedies differ somewhat. The discussion that follows 
applies specifically to monopulse. 
11.1 FLAT-EARTH SPECULAR MODEL  
We will first consider specular reflection from the surface of the Earth and will 
assume initially that the surface is flat and horizontal. The geometry is shown in 
Figure 11.1. The distance to the target is assumed to be so great that the rays from 
the target to the radar and from the target to the point of reflection2 on the surface 
can be considered parallel. The reflected ray reaching the radar is equivalent to a 
ray from the image, which is below the surface at a location symmetrical to that of 
the target. 
Let E and E0 be the elevation angles (measured from horizontal) of the target 
and the beam axis respectively. Because of errors caused by multipath, E and E0 
will generally not be equal. The elevation angle of the image is −E. 
The flat-Earth model gives a reasonable approximation over water or over 
flat, level land surfaces when the reflection point is not too far from the radar. In 
cases where Earth’s curvature must be taken into account, the monopulse aspect 
of the analysis is basically the same but the surface reflection coefficient may be 
reduced by a divergence factor (convex-mirror effect) [5] and the geometry be-
comes somewhat more complicated. Finite target distance (rays not parallel) may 
also have to be taken into account; this complicates the geometry only slightly. 
                                                           
1  Multipath also produces analogous effects in range and Doppler, but here we are concerned only 
with angle. 
2  The reflection is from the entire surface but can be treated by geometric optics as if it were from a 
single point.

Recall from the definitions under (9.7) that p, the amplitude ratio of the re-
flected signal to the direct signal, is the product of g and r, where g is the ratio of 
antenna sum-pattern voltage gain in the direction of the image to that in the direc-
tion of the target, and r is the ratio of voltage coefficients of the image and the

target. The voltage ratio g is a function of E and E0. The image-to-target amplitude 
ratio r is equal to the magnitude of the surface reflection coefficient provided the 
target scatters isotropically; the value of r is between 0 and 1. Most physical tar-
gets are not isotropic scatterers, but they can usually be assumed to be isotropic 
over the small differential angle between the direct ray and the reflected ray leav-
ing the target.3 On this assumption, r is a function of E only. 
The relative phase φ has two components: 
 
s
p
φ = φ + φ  
(11.6) 
where φs is the phase of the surface reflection coefficient and φs is due to the geo-
metric path-length difference between the direct and reflected rays. From Figure 
11.1 it is seen that

where ha is the height of the phase center of the antenna above the surface and λ is 
the wavelength. Both φs and φp are functions of E alone. If the antenna sum pattern 
has an appreciable phase variation as a function of angle, this may also contribute 
to the relative phase φ, but this contribution is usually small and will be ignored. 
The ratio of the reflected field strength to that reaching the surface from the 
target is given by the magnitude ρ0 of the Fresnel reflection coefficient (Figure 
11.2), which is a function of the complex dielectric constant of the surface and the 
wavelength, polarization, and grazing angle of the incident ray [2–5]. At grazing 
angles below 10°, ρ0 is lower for vertical polarization than for horizontal, and 
most tracking radars are vertically polarized to minimize multipath error. At a 
grazing angle known as the pseudo-Brewster angle, between 6° and 25° depend-
ing on the surface material, the magnitude of ρ0 reaches a minimum value that is 
near zero for microwaves. The reflections are small enough, within a small sector 
about this angle, to have minimal effect on tracking. For narrow-beam radars, 
however, the most serious multipath errors occur below this sector. Grazing an-
gles typically used in examples of multipath errors are near 1°, at which angle 
Figure 11.2 shows that ρ0 ≥ 0.75 for all surface types and polarizations. 
The specularly reflected multipath component r is the product of ρ0 and a

3  However, the instantaneous reflected signal can occasionally exceed the direct signal (that is, r > 1) 
because the target (or radiating source) is not perfectly isotropic or because of diffuse reflection com-
ponents adding to the specular.

Here σh is the standard deviation of surface height, ψ is the grazing angle, and λ is 
the electromagnetic wavelength. For the geometric model considered here, namely 
a flat horizontal surface and a target at infinite distance, the grazing angle equals 
the target elevation angle E. When this model is not adequate (for example, when 
Earth’s curvature must be taken into account), the two angles differ. 
Experimental measurements of specular reflection from a rough surface show 
reasonable agreement with (11.8) and (11.9). As the grazing angle approaches 
zero, both ρ0 and ρs approach unity and the phase of the reflection coefficient ap-
proaches 180°, for all polarizations. These values are often used in worst-case 
analyses of specular multipath at very low angles. 
Since the target and the image are at the same azimuth angle and at elevation 
angles of E and −E, respectively, they are also at the same traverse angle, accord-
ing to (2.25). Even when the image elevation is not exactly −E (because of Earth’s 
curvature, for example), the cosines of E and −E are so close to unity at small an-
gles that for practical purposes the traverse angles of the target and image can be 
considered equal. Therefore, in (9.8c), Δθ = 0 and the indicated traverse angle 
equals the target traverse angle, unaffected by multipath. This is not true, how-

ever, if the radar is on a tilted platform such as the deck of a ship or if it is situated 
over a land surface that has a cross-range component of slope. Because of geomet-
ric coupling in that case, multipath will have some effect on traverse as well as 
elevation. Traverse-elevation “cross-talk” in the radar antenna or circuitry may 
also contribute to traverse error due to multipath. Additional causes of traverse 
multipath error are irregularities in the surface and diffraction of reflection from 
trees or from the sides of man-made structures in the vicinity of the radar. 
11.2 
EFFECT ON DETECTION 
In addition to its effect on angle measurement, multipath has a well known effect 
on detection [5]. Figure 11.3 illustrates the effect of multipath on typical mo-
nopulse sum voltage in elevation. Since such a pattern typically has a beamwidth 
of a few degrees at most (less than 1° in some cases), the vertical scale of the fig-
ure has been expanded for clarity. The lobing is due to interference between the 
direct and reflected waves, which are alternately in phase and out of phase as the 
elevation varies. In the horizontal direction there is a null because the target and 
the image have the same elevation, the same amplitude, and 180° relative phase. 
The ratio of the free-space beamwidth to the multipath lobe spacing (that is, the 
number of lobes within the free-space beamwidth) is approximately equal to twice 
the height of the antenna phase center above the reflecting surface divided by the 
diameter (or vertical dimension) of the antenna. In Figure 11.3 there are about five 
lobes within the half-power beamwidth; therefore the antenna phase-center height 
must be about 2.5 times its diameter. 
The difference pattern also has an interference lobing structure due to multi-
path. This affects the elevation angle measurements (which depend on the com-
plex ratio of the difference to the sum) but does not affect detection. 
The effect of multipath on detection is not of primary interest in connection 
with monopulse but it does have indirect relevance. First of all, it is necessary to 
detect a target in order to track it or measure its angular location. Second, when 
the target is in or near a null its sum-channel signal strength is low and this means

a large error in elevation measurement due to thermal noise, although this is likely 
to be overshadowed by the error due to the unresolved-target effect. 
11.3 
EFFECT ON CLOSED-LOOP ELEVATION TRACKING 
A closed-loop tracker attempts to point the beam in a direction that nulls the real 
part of the indicated angle. The effect of multipath on closed-loop tracking is the 
same as that of two unresolved targets, discussed in Section 9.16. Motion of the 
beam from an off-null direction toward the null direction changes the amplitude 
ratio of the target and image. Therefore the null direction is generally not the same 
as the direction indicated by the open-loop monopulse output when the beam is 
pointed off null. 
To calculate the tracking equilibrium direction (i.e., the null direction) for a 
given target elevation angle requires an iterative solution using knowledge of the 
antenna height, the antenna patterns, the monopulse processor characteristics, and 
the amplitude and phase of the surface reflection coefficient. Depending on the 
conditions, there may be one stable equilibrium direction or there may be two (not 
counting possible equilibrium directions in the sidelobes). If there are two stable 
equilibrium directions, there is an unstable equilibrium direction between them. At 
an unstable point the monopulse response curve passes the zero axis with a slope 
of the wrong sign, which drives the beam away from the null rather than toward it. 
Figure 11.4 illustrates the problem of closed-loop elevation tracking in multi-
path. A flat earth was assumed and an analytical model of typical sum and differ-
ence patterns was used in the calculations. An exact monopulse processor (as de-
fined in Section 8.4) was assumed. The reflection coefficient is unity at 0° target 
elevation and decreases with increasing elevation angle. 
Plotted horizontally is the true elevation angle of the target. Plotted vertically 
is the null direction, which is the same as the beam pointing direction if the target 
varied slowly enough to allow the servo loop to reach equilibrium at each point. 
The upper dashed line at 45° is the direction in which the beam would point if the 
image were absent and the lower dashed line is the corresponding direction if the 
image were present without the target. 
In the upper half of the curve (the part above zero elevation) the radar is 
tracking the target, with perturbations caused by the image. The upper peaks occur 
when the target and image signals are in phase opposition. The lower peaks occur 
when they are in phase. The variation in relative phase is due mainly to path-
length difference as a function of elevation angle, and to a lesser extent to varia-
tion of the phase of the reflection coefficient as a function of grazing angle. 
The lower part of the figure, consisting of a series of disjointed closed curves, 
shows the locus of a pair of other null directions. The solid portion of each loop is 
stable and is due to tracking of the image, with perturbations by the target, rather 

278 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
than vice versa. The dotted portion of each curve is unstable; if the antenna were 
pointed in that direction, a slight deflection would cause it to move toward one of 
the stable null directions. In analyzing radar tracking behavior against a target 
flying at a specified constant altitude, it is sometimes useful to plot the null direc-
tions as functions of target range rather than elevation angle [7]. If the target is 
approaching or receding at a specified constant speed, the horizontal scale can 
also be expressed in terms of time, so that the dynamic behavior can be analyzed. 
Consider a radar with a mechanically steered antenna tracking a target that is 
approaching at a constant low altitude. The target elevation angle is near zero at 
long range and it increases as the target approaches. The oscillations in the beam- 
pointing direction sometimes become quite violent, and the inertia of the antenna 
can carry it from the upper stable direction to the lower one, if a lower stable null 
exists at the moment. This phenomenon, known as “nose-diving,” has often been

Multipath

observed in practice. The track may then transfer back to the upper null or it may 
be lost altogether. 
Figure 11.5 illustrates the multipath phenomenon in another way, for the 
same set of conditions used in plotting Figure 11.4. With the target elevation held 
constant, the open-loop monopulse output (real part) is plotted versus beam eleva-
tion angle. Curves are plotted for several values of target elevation angle in the 
vicinity of the second peak in Figure 11.4 to demonstrate the sensitivity to relative 
phase in the vicinity of 180°. If the loop is closed, the downward closings of the 
zero axis are stable tracking directions, and the upward crossings, where they ex-
ist, are instable nulls. The slopes are the opposite of those shown in earlier chap-
ters because the beam axis elevation is varying while target elevation is constant, 
rather than vice versa. Comparison of Figures 11.4 and 11.5 shows why there are 
two stable tracking directions for some target elevations and only one for others. 
The nulls that have a slope of the correct sign are stable in the sense that a 
displacement of the beam axis from the null produces a restoring force toward the 
null. The servo response, however, is generally not the same as it is for a single 
target without multipath. The forward gain is proportional to the slope of the zero 
crossing; this slope can be higher or lower than the normal single-target slope, 
shown by the dashed line in Figure 11.5. The closed-loop tracking performance

elevation angle.

will vary accordingly. Referring to Figure 10.3, the open-loop frequency response 
of the servo is designed to have a region of 6-dB/octave slope extending for at 
least one, and preferably two octaves, each side of the unity-gain point. This pre-
serves stability of the closed-loop operation by providing an adequate margin 
from the prohibited 180° phase shift at unity gain. If the open-loop gain varies by 
more than a factor of two above or below its design value, as a result of varying 
monopulse response slope, the servo approaches instability and tends to oscillate 
at a frequency near that at which the response crosses unity gain. This can lead to 
loss of track on low-angle targets above a reflecting surface. 
The closed-loop tracking behavior shown in Figure 11.4 is intended only for 
illustration, since it is based on a particular set of conditions and some simplifying 
assumptions. The behavior of a specific radar (e.g., the amplitudes and spacing of 
the oscillations) will of course depend on the characteristics and geometry of the 
radar, the reflecting surface, and the target. For a more refined analysis it is usu-
ally necessary to take Earth’s curvature into account unless the reflection point is 
close to the radar. Not only the sum and difference patterns of the antenna but also 
the type of monopulse processor used may have a decided effect. A more subtle 
factor is that the sum and difference signals for a point target in the clear are not 
exactly in phase as assumed, either because of the inherent characteristics of the 
feed [8] or because of imbalance in transmission lines and receivers. Even a small 
phase difference can cause the actual behavior to differ from the theoretical [9], 
because it couples a portion of the imaginary part of the monopulse output (which 
can be quite large) into the real part. 
Although the computations for Figure 11.5 omit these complicating factors, 
and are based on only one particular set of parameters, it has been amply con-
firmed by experiments and actual operation that the oscillatory behavior exhibited 
in the figure is at least qualitatively typical and that it seriously degrades or pre-
vents normal tracking of low-angle targets in multipath. Even at target elevation 
angles up to a few beamwidths above the horizon, multipath constitutes a signifi-
cant item in the system error budget, but only within a beamwidth of the horizon 
does it become severe enough to disrupt tracking. 
11.4 
TYPES OF MULTIPATH REMEDIES 
A number of remedial techniques have been developed or proposed to alleviate 
the low-angle tracking problem, some of which will be described in this chapter. 
Additional discussions of the various techniques are available elsewhere [3, 8, 10, 
11], with summaries of their advantages and limitations and estimates of their 
accuracies and of the lowest angles at which they can operate. 
The various remedies differ in the degree of sophistication, in the types of ap-
plications to which they are suited, and in effectiveness. They are not necessarily 
mutually exclusive; some of them can be used in combination. No technique 

 
Multipath 
281 
yields the same elevation accuracy that is attainable in the absence of multipath, 
but the errors can be reduced and tracking can be extended to a lower angle than 
would be possible otherwise. 
Some of the techniques do not attack the multipath problem directly, but by 
selection of the radar design or operating parameters such as beamwidth, sidelobe 
level, polarization, or servo bandwidth, they attempt to mitigate the effects of mul-
tipath while continuing to operate in a normal mode. Other techniques require 
special modes of operation such as a “low-E mode,” designed to reduce multipath 
errors, but they still base their elevation estimates or tracking on the assumption 
that only one target (without multipath) is present. The most sophisticated tech-
niques do not merely treat multipath as a disturbance but actually take it into ac-
count in their tracking loops or in their open-loop calibration functions; if the mul-
tipath conformed exactly to the model on which each such technique is based (i.e., 
pure specular reflection), there would be no multipath error. 
In the Sections 11.5–11.13, only the effects of specular multipath are consid-
ered quantitatively. In Section 11.14 the characteristics of diffuse multipath and its 
effects on each of the mitigation techniques is discussed. 
11.5 
BEAM PATTERN DESIGN 
Two design features that are of obvious benefit are narrow elevation beamwidth 
and low sidelobes, but the extent to which they can be implemented is limited by 
other system considerations. 
Reduction of the elevation beamwidth permits tracking to a lower angle. 
However, it requires an increase in antenna size or an increase in frequency, either 
or both of which may conflict with other system constraints. Increased antenna 
size also means an increased cost. A radar operating at two frequencies sharing the 
same antenna [11, 12] permits high-angle tracking at a frequency that is optimum 
for that purpose, and low-angle tracking at a second frequency in a higher band 
that produces a narrower beamwidth. Sole reliance on the higher band (e.g., Ka-
band) may be inconsistent with achieving the detection ranges required under un-
favorable atmospheric conditions. 
Low sidelobes do not help when the image is in the mainlobe, as in the left-
hand part of Figure 11.4. However, when the target elevation is high enough to 
put the image in the close-in sidelobes, where the elevation error is still significant 
(although not disruptive), sidelobe control can give substantial reduction of the 
error not only from specular multipath but also from diffuse multipath and clutter, 
besides having other possible system benefits. On the other hand, reduced 
sidelobes are obtained at the price of reduction in gain and widening of the beam, 
increasing the elevation sector within which the more serious disruption of track-
ing can occur.

11.6 
RANGE AND DOPPLER RESOLUTION 
The reflected signal travels a longer path than the direct signal, so it is possible in 
theory to resolve them in range; since the pathlength difference changes as the 
target approaches or receded, it is possible in theory to resolve the signals in Dop-
pler. In practice, however, the differences in range and Doppler are usually too 
small for resolution. 
Unless the radar is operating in a one-way mode (receiving signals from a 
beacon or transponder), multipath affects both the transmitting and receiving 
paths, and therefore a single transmitted pulse will produce three (not two) re-
ceived pulses. Figure 11.6(a) shows the transmitted waveform arriving at the tar-
get. It consists of the direct pulse D and the pulse R reflected from the surface. In 
this example, it is assumed that the two pulses are separated by more than the 
pulse length, so they are resolvable. An illustrative value of 0.75 is used for the 
ratio of the amplitude of the reflected pulse to that of the direct pulse. This ratio 
includes the effects of the reflection coefficient and the antenna elevation pattern. 
Figure 11.6(b) shows the waveform arriving at the receiving antenna. It consists of 
three pulses. The first pulse DD follows the direct path in both directions, and if it 
is resolved in range from the others it yields the correct target angle. The third 
pulse RR follows the reflected path in both directions. Its amplitude is (0.75)2 or 
about 0.56 times the amplitude of the first pulse in this example, and it yields the 
image angle. The middle pulse DR + RD is the sum of the direct-reflected and the 
reflected-direct contributions of equal amplitude and phase; hence, it has 1.5 times 
the amplitude of the first pulse in this example. Since it consists of one component 
arriving from the direction of the target and another of equal amplitude arriving 
from the direction of the image, its indicated angle is midway between target and 
image. (Because the Earth is curved, the target-image midpoint lies above the sur-
face.)

Multipath 
283 
A corresponding set of three pulses is received in the difference channel. 
Their relative amplitudes and phases depend on their angles of arrival as well as 
on the factors that determine the sum-channel amplitudes. 
Hence if range resolution is to be used to separate the image from the target, 
not only must the bandwidth be wide enough, but a methodology must be devel-
oped to recognize the three pulses as belonging to the same target. The first pulse 
is the desired one, but if it has a low signal-to-noise ratio it may not be detected; 
the second pulse, which can have a higher amplitude than the first, might be the 
first pulse detected, giving an erroneous angle indication. The multiplicity of pulse 
returns is compounded by the fact that a typical target is not a point scatterer but 
has several distinct scattering points. Hence the echo from a typical target such as 
an aircraft may have a string of overlapping triplets of pulses. Only the first of 
these scatterers may be resolvable from multipath returns, and if this comes from 
the nose of the aircraft (possibly a radome tip) it is unlikely to be detectable by 
itself. As a result, even the highest available range resolution is unlikely to pro-
vide a measurement free of multipath error.

where ha and ht are the altitudes of the radar antenna phase center and of the target

The range resolution must be sufficient to resolve the one-way pathlength differ-
ence, which is the interval between the first and second pulses and between the 
second and third. In the present example, a bandwidth of about 800 MHz would 
be required in order to resolve the three pulses from a single scattering point illus-
trated in Figure 11.6(b).  
Equation (11.10) shows that increasing the antenna altitude aids range resolu-
tion of multipath, but for surface-based radars it is not usually possible to obtain 
enough height to make range resolution a useful tool against multipath, especially 
when coping with targets that fly lower than the 100-m altitude used in the exam-
ple. However, if the radar is airborne or situated on a mountain or cliff overlook-
ing a flat surface, range resolution can be effective, or can at least reduce the de-
gree of overlap of the direct and reflected pulses and therefore reduce the error. 
The rate of change of the pathlength difference is obtained by differentiating 
(11.10), assuming that the target is approaching or receding at a constant altitude 
over a flat earth:

This is the Doppler difference between DD and DR + RD components. Such a 
small frequency difference is not resolvable in most practical applications. It 
would require a coherent integration time of ≈4s, which could not be used in a 
dynamic situation. Even if Doppler resolution of 0.27 Hz could be accomplished, 
there is another fundamental reason why it would not be effective against complex 
targets such as aircraft. Because of the modulation caused by rotational and vibra-
tional perturbations in flight, such a target does not have a sharply defined Dop-
pler frequency but rather a Doppler spectrum. Typical Doppler spreads of aircraft 
(expressed in m/s so they can be converted to Doppler frequency for any given 
radar frequency) are 0.04–1.8 m/s [13]. According to (11.11), the mean range-rate 
difference in our example is only 0.008 m/s. Hence, the spectra of the target and 
image would almost completely overlap and Doppler resolution would be impos-
sible. 
Although Figure 11.6 shows that a single transmitted pulse produces four 
components of the received signal as a result of multipath (DD, DR, RD, and RR), 
it is only necessary to consider two components in the usual case where path-
length difference is much less than the range resolution of the radar. In such a case 
the pair of pulses illuminating the target, as shown in Figure 11.6(a), coalesce into 
a single pulse that is the resultant of the two contributions. In monopulse recep-
tion, it is then necessary only to consider the one-way direct and reflected contri-

butions to the sum and difference voltages. This conclusion is based on the as-
sumption that the target scatters isotropically over the small angular interval be-
tween the direct and reflected rays. Rare cases can occur in which a target has 
such a strongly directional scattering pattern that this assumption is not valid, and 
in such cases all four contributions should be considered. These cases can be rec-
ognized as occurring when the target scatterers have a spread Δh in height such 
that

(11.13) 
where λ/Δh is the elevation width of each lobe of the directional scattering pattern, 
2ha/R is the elevation angle between the antenna and its image, as viewed from 
the target, and the constant 1/4 ensures that the reflected field from the target will 
illuminate the antenna and its image with essentially the same field strength. 
11.7 
SMOOTHING AND AVERAGING 
Smoothing of the elevation fluctuations (for example, by reducing the loop band-
width) is beneficial if the fluctuations are rapid, as in a case where the radar site is 
high above the reflecting surface and the target is approaching or receding at high 
speed. A similar effect is obtained in open-loop measurements by averaging over 
several pulses. In many cases, however, the fluctuations are too slow to allow any 
benefit from smoothing or averaging. The value Δf = 0.27 Hz derived from 
(11.12) in our earlier example is the frequency at which the multipath error varies, 
and smoothing over some multiple of 1/Δf = 3.75s is not generally permissible in 
radar tracking applications. 
Pulse-to-pulse frequency changing (“frequency agility”) can speed up the 
fluctuations, since the spacing of the error cycles illustrated in Figure 11.4 is in-
versely proportional to the radar’s carrier frequency. However, to produce any 
substantial benefit (e.g., to convert an error maximum to an error minimum in 
Figure 11.4) a very wide frequency band is required, especially in the lowest mul-
tipath lobes. The one-way pathlength difference given by (11.10) is equal to the 
radar wavelength times the number of the null (starting with zero at the horizon). 
To change the first null to a peak would thus require that the frequency be reduced 
to 1/2 or increased to 3/2 of the value that produced the null. The required band is 
comparable to the bandwidth needed to resolve the target from the image in range. 
In our previous example, that range difference, from (11.10) was ΔR = 0.4m (cor-
responding approximately to the 13th null from the horizon), and the bandwidth 
required for resolution is 750 MHz. The use of frequency agility for multipath 
reduction is similar to its application to reduction of target glint [14], where a 
simulation showed that basing the angle estimate on the single pulse having the 

286 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
largest sum-signal amplitude gave less error than that obtained by averaging sev-
eral pulses. 
11.8 
“LOW-E” MODES 
One method that is used to prevent violent oscillations in elevation tracking of 
low-angle targets is to disable the elevation tracking loop and keep the beam at a 
fixed elevation when the indicated angle drops below a specified value (usually 
≈0.75 beamwidth). Thus, as long as the target is within the beam and the signal is 
strong enough, track is maintained in range and traverse. There are several forms 
of this method, known generically as “low-E” modes. 
In the simplest low-E mode the radar provides no information about target 
elevation, the rationale being that it is better to forgo the elevation information, 
which is erroneous anyway, than to risk complete loss of track. In some applica-
tions the range and traverse information is useful in itself. If the target is ap-
proaching the radar at constant altitude, the expectation is that it will eventually 
reach an elevation angle that permits a transition to full track. 
Some applications require prediction of future position of the target. If the tar-
get is known to be of a type that flies at a constant low altitude and if elevation 
information from the radar is either unavailable or of poor quality, it is sometimes 
helpful to insert a “most probable” constant altitude for use in the prediction equa-
tion. The prediction error due to incorrect altitude may be much less than the error 
that would result from fictitious high rate of change of altitude. 
While the radar is operating in a low-E mode, the open-loop elevation mo-
nopulse output can be measured and used for crude estimation of target elevation 
if desired. In any case, it is monitored to determine, either by the operator’s judg-
ment or by a prescribed logic, when the elevation has increased sufficiently to 
permit switching to closed-loop tracking. Similarly, observation of the closed-loop 
tracking behavior determines when to switch to the low-E mode. 
Figure 11.7 is a plot of open-loop indicated elevation in the low-E mode, for 
the same radar and multipath parameters used in Figures 11.4 and 11.5, with a 
constant beam axis elevation E0 = 0.75 beamwidth. The indicated elevation is ob-
tained by converting the open-loop output to an off-axis angle (using the single-
target calibration) and adding that angle to the known elevation of the beam. 
Comparison of Figures 11.4 and 11.7 shows that at target elevation angles below 
0.6 beamwidth the open-loop errors are smaller than the closed-loop errors. The 
reason is that the low-E mode places the image on the steep underside of the sum 
beam and thus reduces the ratio of image amplitude to target amplitude. Besides 
reducing the error, the main advantage is immunity to loss of track caused by an-
tenna oscillations. At target elevation angles a little higher than 0.6 beamwidth the 
low-E mode offers no advantage and at still higher elevation angles it becomes 
inferior to closed-loop tracking. The specific results will vary, of course, with the 

 
Multipath 
287 
parameters of the radar and the reflecting surface and with the geometry of a par-
ticular radar installation, but it is generally true that although the low-E mode is 
not a “cure” for multipath, it reduces errors and prevents loss of track at very low 
target elevation angles. 
If the antenna is an electronically steered array, it is not subject to mechanical 
oscillations, and the beam pointing position can easily be inhibited from going 
below the horizon. Nevertheless a low-E mode can still be useful because it re-
duces elevation errors. 
Omitted from the computations for Figure 11.7 is the error in making open-
loop angle measurements, due to the difficulty of maintaining accurate off-axis 
calibration. As a rough rule of thumb, this error is typically 10% of the indicated 
off-axis angle unless special self-calibration techniques or other stabilizing fea-
tures are incorporated in the radar to reduce it. The open-loop calibration error 
reduces the advantage of the low-E mode, but only to a minor extent. 
The optimum beam elevation angle must be determined by analysis or simu-
lation for each radar. Against very low targets, the error is minimized by a beam 
elevation angle that puts the target and image near the steepest part of the under-
side of the sum beam. Unfortunately, this reduces the signal-to-noise ratio and 
increases the thermal-noise error. In a typical low-angle situation, however, multi-
path is the dominant source of error, and thermal noise is only a secondary con-
sideration.

OFFSET-NULL TRACKING 
Another technique that gives some reduction of multipath errors is closed-loop 
tracking with the patterns modified so that the elevation difference-pattern null is 
offset from the peak of the sum pattern. This can be done by adding a portion of 
the sum voltage to the elevation difference voltage, as described by David and 
Redlein [15, 16]. An equivalent effect can be obtained by inserting a voltage off-
set in the servo, or a numerical offset if the loop includes a computer. To see the 
equivalence, note that the modified difference signal is d + Ks, where d and s are 
the original difference and sum signals and K is a constant. Then the modified 
monopulse ratio is 
 
d
Ks

(11.14) 
which is the original monopulse ratio plus an offset K. Modification of the differ-
ence pattern in the antenna feed system is the preferred approach, because an off-
set voltage in the servo tends to cause rapid loss of track when signal fading opens 
the track loop or reduces its gain significantly. In most radars, a standard mainte-
nance or operating procedure is to adjust for zero bias in the servo input by ob-
serving and setting to zero rate the drift in antenna position when only noise is 
present at the input. 
The offset null puts the direction of the sum-pattern peak above the direction 
of the difference-pattern null. The steep fall-off of the underside of the sum pat-
tern gives increased rejection of the image contribution relative to the target con-
tribution. The offset can be a fixed amount or it can be continuously variable in 
accordance with the indicated elevation to provide a smooth transition rather than 
an abrupt change between normal track and offset-null track. 
Figure 11.8 illustrates the improvement obtained by offset-null tracking at the 
lowest elevation angles, using the same parameters as in Figure 11.4 but with the 
null displaced downward from the sum-pattern peak by 0.5 beamwidth. The spu-
rious nulls in the vicinity of the image direction, shown in the lower half of Figure 
11.4, are omitted from Figure 11.8. They are still present but are further removed 
from the primary null directions; for this reason and because the amplitude of the 
oscillations is reduced, “nose-diving” is unlikely to occur. 
11.10 
ELEVATION PATTERNS HAVING A SYMMETRICAL RATIO 
In contrast to conventional monopulse patterns, in which the ratio of the differ-
ence to the sum is an odd function of angle, a technique devised by White [17] 
uses a pair of elevation patterns whose ratio is an even (symmetrical) function of 
angle, parabolic in shape, with a null on the axis. The axis elevation angle is held

fixed and open-loop elevation measurements are made while normal tracking is 
maintained in range and traverse.

Let p and φ be the amplitude ratio and relative phase of the image to the tar-
get, as before, and let vA and vB be the voltages derived from the two patterns.

which is the same as it would be for the target alone, unaffected by multipath. 
Target elevation is obtained by taking the ratio of the two voltages, vB/vA, and con-
verting it to angle by use of the known free-space calibration function. 
Under ideal conditions this technique gives a true solution; it yields the cor-
rect target elevation on a single pulse (provided the ratio is computed on each 
pulse), with no multipath error. Of course under practical conditions it cannot 
have the same accuracy in multipath that a conventional monopulse radar can 
achieve in free space, but it can give useful information measurements in the low-
angle region, not obtainable from conventional tracking. 
Sources of error include deviation of the reflecting surface from the assumed 
model and imperfect symmetry of the pattern ratio. Because of the shallow slope 
of the pattern ratio at very low angles, the thermal noise error in that region is 
larger than in conventional monopulse in free space. 
Figures 11.9(a) and (b) are examples of two different pairs of A and B pat-
terns having ratios that are parabolic functions of elevation angle [private commu-
nication with W. D. White, 1983]. The symmetry constraint is imposed only on 
the ratio, not the individual patterns, which are deliberately designed to be weaker 
on the negative elevation side in order to minimize errors due to deviation from 
the assumed reflection geometry, as well as from surface clutter and diffuse mul-
tipath. These particular patterns are synthesized by superimposing three compo-
nent beams, each of which has the shape that is characteristic of a uniformly illu-
minated line source, namely [sin(πθY/λ)]/(πθY/λ), where θ is the elevation angle 
measured from the axis of each component beam and Y is the vertical dimension 
of the antenna.4 The quantity λ/Y is known as the standard beamwidth. The choice 
as to which pattern pair is better depends on factors such as target elevation and 
surface roughness. There is considerable flexibility in the design of pattern pairs 
having a symmetrical ratio but different individual characteristics. 
                                                           
4  To be more rigorous, θ should be replaced by its sine, but for small angles there is negligible differ-
ence. 

 
Multipath 
291 
In these two examples the A and B patterns are composed of three adjacent 
beams separated by the standard beamwidth and combined with different weights. 
Table 11.1 lists the elevation angles of the component beams and the weights used 
in superimposing them to form the A and B patterns. The total power in the B 
pattern (sum of the squares of the weights) is the same as in the A pattern. 
Pointing the axis of symmetry horizontally is based on the assumptions of a 
flat Earth and infinite target range, but these assumptions are not necessary. For a 
flat Earth and finite target range the axis can be programmed in accordance with 
the measured range to point at the target-image midpoint, which is a point on the 
surface approximately at the range of the target. Curved-Earth geometry could 
also be taken into account in programming the axis pointing direction. In that 
case, however, at any given range the target-image midpoint varies somewhat 
with target elevation, and as a result there is no axis direction that can maintain the 
desired target-image symmetry exactly.

are given in Table 11.1. 

292 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
Although this technique uses patterns unlike conventional sum and difference 
patterns, it falls under the broad definition of monopulse given in Chapter 2 be-
cause it bases its angle estimate on the ratio of voltages derived from simultaneous 
receiving beams. 
The principle of a symmetrical monopulse ratio has also been applied in a dif-
ferent way by Dax [18, 19]. Instead of a special pair of patterns like those in Fig-
ure 11.9, this techniques uses sum and difference patterns like those of conven-
tional monopulse but with an important modification. Normally a plot of the mo-
nopulse ratio is concave upward, as in the bottom curve of Figure 6.6; if extended 
to the right, it becomes infinite5 at the first sum-pattern null, which occurs before 
the first off-axis difference-pattern null. In the modified patterns the off-axis dif-
ference null occurs before the sum null, and a plot of the ratio is convex upward, 
as in the top curve of Figure 6.6. If extended to the right the curve reaches a peak 
and then decreases, passing through zero. Between the on-axis null and the off-
axis null, the curve has approximate symmetry. 
Figure 11.10 is an illustrative plot of the sum and difference patterns and their 
ratio. The negative angle where the ratio has its peak value is the axis of symme-
try, which is programmed to point in the direction that bisects the angle between 
target and image. The required elevation angle of the axis of symmetry is com-
puted approximately as the negative of the ratio of antenna height to target range. 
Thus, the target and image are at symmetrical angles, and their individual mo-
nopulse ratio is the same as that of the target alone. The target elevation angle is 
estimated by means of the single-target calibration function. 
                                                           
5  In practice it is limited, of course, to a finite value by the nature of the monopulse processor or by 
the finite dynamic range of the components. Furthermore, the nulls are never complete; there is always 
some residual voltage, which prevents the infinite ratio.

DOUBLE-NULL TRACKER 
This is a closed-loop tracking technique devised by White [17, 20]. The difference 
pattern has not only a primary null (which in the case of a reflector antenna is 
along the mechanical axis), but also a second null at a lower elevation angle. A 
single control loop steers the primary null toward the target direction and at the 
same time offsets the second null downward from the first by an angle computed 
by the laws of reflection from a level surface, so that the second null is directed at 
the image. Although this technique differs from conventional monopulse, it falls 
under the broad definition of monopulse given in Section 2.1, since it makes use 
of simultaneous receiving patterns. 
The theory and implementation of this technique are explained in [17]. A 
nonmathematical explanation given in [20] begins with a conceptual description 
of a maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE) designed on the idealized assumption 
of a perfectly smooth and level reflecting surface. Such a surface creates a specu-
lar image at an angle having an exactly known relationship to the target angle. The 
MLE based on this assumption would give equal weights to the target and the 
image contributions. If the ideal conditions actually existed, the estimator would 
be totally immune to the multipath elevation errors that occur in conventional 
tracking systems. However, it would be excessively sensitive to deviations from 
the ideal conditions. The deviations usually encountered are clutter and diffuse

294 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
multipath because the surface is not perfectly smooth, and displacement of the 
specular image because the surface is not perfectly level. 
In order to reduce the errors caused by the nonideal conditions, the actual de-
sign is a “tempered” double-null tracker, similar in concept to the MLE except 
that the patterns are designed to have a smaller response at negative than at posi-
tive elevation angles. This modification retains the theoretical immunity to specu-
lar multipath error under ideal conditions, and under practical conditions it sub-
stantially reduces the errors caused by the nonideal reflecting surface. The price 
paid for this improvement is a reduction in error slope sensitivity compared with 
the MLE, resulting in somewhat higher thermal-noise error. This technique re-
quires some additional complexity in the feed and processing compared with con-
ventional monopulse. 
The closed-loop operation requires a loop settling time. Hence, it is intended 
for continuous track, not for single-pulse or short-dwell operation. The technique 
has been implemented in a reflector antenna, using a feed that provides six pencil 
beams arranged in three horizontal pairs stacked in elevation. The traverse sum 
and difference are obtained by combining the left and right members of the pairs 
in hybrids. The elevation patterns are generated by a weighted combination of the 
outputs of the three pairs. Tests in which a monopulse radar could be operated 
either in its normal tracking mode or in the double-null tracking mode on low an-
gle targets are reported to have shown smooth tracks in the double-null mode, 
with marked reduction in elevation error and complete freedom from the “nose-
diving” (abrupt transition from target track to image track) occasionally encoun-
tered in the normal tracking mode. 
11.12 
USE OF THE COMPLEX INDICATED ANGLE 
The concept of a complex indicated angle was introduced in Section 9.5. It was 
pointed out that although the monopulse ratio due to a single target is nominally 
real, unresolved targets cause the ratio to be complex; the real and imaginary parts 
can be interpreted to correspond to the real and imaginary parts of a complex an-
gle. Normally only the real part is used but the imaginary part, when it exists, also 
contains information. 
Since multipath is a special case of unresolved targets, it produces an indi-
cated angle that is complex in general. For the simple flat-Earth geometry shown 
in Figure 11.1, the real and imaginary parts x and y are given by (11.4) and (11.5). 
In the ordinary low-E mode (Section 11.8), E0 is held fixed and target elevation 
can be estimated from the open-loop measurement of the real part x, together with 
the known elevation angle of the beam axis, producing the type of result illus-
trated in Figure 11.6. 

 
Multipath 
295 
In the complex-indicated-angle version of the low-E mode [21], the beam 
elevation is held constant and both x and y, the real and imaginary parts of the 
open-loop indicated angle, are measured. Measurement of the imaginary part re-
quires some additional processing and computation (Section 9.7) but no change in 
the antenna patterns. If y is plotted against x as the target elevation angle varies, 
the resulting curve is a sort of spiral with a moving center, as illustrated in Figure 
11.11. (In the absence of multipath the plot would simply be that of a point mov-
ing along the x-axis.) In part (a) of the figure the parameters are the same as those 
used in plotting Figures 11.4 and 11.7, including the same ratio of antenna height 
to antenna vertical dimension, namely 4. In part (b) the parameters are also the 
same except that the ratio has been reduced from 4 to 2. The encircled points on 
the spirals and the adjacent numbers indicate increments of 0.1 beamwidth in tar-
get elevation. In plotting these spirals it has been assumed that the local-oscillator 
frequency is below the radar frequency. If it is above the radar frequency, the 
phases are inverted, causing the spirals to be turned upside down. 
The reason the behavior illustrated in the figure can be understood by recall-
ing from Section 9.5 that if the relative phase of two targets is varied while their 
amplitude ratio and their angles remain constant, the locus of the complex indi-
cated angle is a circle like one of the solid circles in Figure 9.2. In the multipath 
case the relative phase of the target and image varies with the target elevation an-
gle, producing the loops seen in Figure 11.11. The loops are not circular for two

height of antenna phase center to antenna vertical dimension: (a) 4 and (b) 2. Numbers at circled 
points on spiral are target elevation angles in beamwidths. 

296 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
reasons: the ratio of image amplitude to target amplitude decreases with increas-
ing target elevation, causing the loops to become progressively smaller (except 
when the image enters the sidelobes), and the increasing target elevation relative 
to the beam axis causes the center of the loops to move in the positive direction. 
Since every point on the spiral corresponds to a particular elevation angle (ig-
noring the ambiguities, which will be discussed later), it should be possible in 
theory, once the spiral has been plotted for a particular radar installation (with an 
X–Y plotter, for example), to use it as a two-dimensional calibration curve or look-
up table to determine the elevation angle of a target from the measurements of x 
and y. The calibration spiral could be computed, but since the reflection character-
istics of the surface are not generally known with sufficient accuracy, it is prefer-
able to obtain the calibration spiral from measurements on a test target whose ele-
vation angle at each instant is determined by some independent means which is 
not subject to multipath error. Although a flat Earth was assumed in order to sim-
plify the computations for Figure 11.11, there is no need for this assumption in 
plotting an actual calibration spiral, whether by theory or measurement. When 
Earth’s curvature is taken into account, the spiral will have the same general form 
as in Figure 11.11 but will differ in detail. The exact shape will also depend, of 
course, on the specific parameters of the radar and the characteristics of the sur-
face. 
In describing this technique, it was stated above that the beam elevation is 
held constant. If constant elevation were referred to the horizontal, the calibration 
spiral would vary somewhat with target range, requiring different spirals for dif-
ferent ranges. To eliminate all but second-order range-dependence, the beam axis 
should be kept instead at a fixed elevation above the effective horizon direction. 
This is defined as the direction from the antenna to the point on the surface di-
rectly below the target unless that point is beyond the horizon, in which case the 
effective horizon direction is the same as the true horizon direction—that is, the 
direction of the ray from the antenna tangent to the Earth’s surface. The effective 
horizon direction is the zero reference because it is the direction where target and 
image merge, and in general it is approximately midway between the target and 
the image directions. Thus, the required beam elevation angle when operating in 
this mode varies with target range but it is easily computed from the known an-
tenna height and the measured range. 
Because of noise, drifts, measurement errors, time-varying diffuse multipath, 
and changes in reflection characteristics of the surface, the measured point will 
generally fall near, but not actually on the spiral. Pulse-to-pulse fluctuations can 
be reduced by smoothing but some deviation from the spiral will remain. The pro-
cedure for making the elevation estimate is illustrated in Figure 11.12, using an 
enlarged portion of the spiral drawn in Figure 11.10(a). Point A represents the true 
elevation and A′ is the measured point after smoothing. The elevation estimate is 
based on A′′, which is the point on the spiral closest to the measured point. The arc 
AA′′ represents the error. 

 
Multipath 
297 
Errors due to noise and to changes in the surface reflection coefficient, using 
the estimation procedure just described, have been investigated by simulation 
[22]. Provided that any ambiguities that occurred were resolved, it was found that 
noise errors were smaller, on the average, than noise errors with normal mo-
nopulse in free space when the comparison was made at the same actual signal-to-
noise ratio. The reason is that the radar and its image below the surface act as an 
interferometer, which has greater angular sensitivity than the radar alone. Another 
form of explanation is that the multipath expands the calibration scale, since the 
length of the spiral curve is greater than the length along the real axis between the 
same end-point angles. 
It was found in the same investigation that changes in the surface reflection 
coefficient by as much as 50% caused only moderate errors. The explanation lies 
in the fact that a change in the reflection coefficient makes the loops of the spiral 
expand or contract, so that each point on the spiral shifts in a direction that is pri-
marily perpendicular to the curve at that point, rather than tangential. The perpen-
dicular component of shift causes no error. 
One problem that is evident is that there are ambiguities where the curve 
crosses itself or where loops lie close together. The ambiguity problem, however, 
is less serious when both x and y are used than when x alone is used. Suppose that 
in the low-E mode using measurements of x only, as in Figure 11.7, a reading is 
obtained that lies anywhere in the range of 0.24 to 0.36 beamwidth. In Figure 
11.7, a line drawn horizontally at any coordinate in that range intersects the curve 
at five points, yielding five possible values for true elevation. The same result can 
be illustrated in Figure 11.11(a), which is based on the same parameters and the 
same mode of operation as Figure 11.7. The x-coordinate of any point on the spi-
ral is the same as the coordinate of the point in Figure 11.7 at the same target ele-
vation. Therefore corresponding to the horizontal line in Figure 11.7, draw a verti-
cal line in Figure 11.11(a) at a horizontal position anywhere between 0.24 and 
 
Figure 11.12   Estimation procedure and ambiguities in calibration-spiral technique. 

298 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
0.36 beamwidth and note that it intersects the spiral at five points, producing a 
five-fold ambiguity if only x is measured. If, however, both x and y are measured, 
each pair of values of x and y unambiguously identifies one point on the spiral, 
except for a two-fold ambiguity at points where the curve crosses itself. Compari-
son of Figure 11.11(a, b) shows that the lower the antenna height, the fewer are 
the ambiguities. 
However, the ambiguity problem is aggravated by noise, changes in reflection 
coefficient, and other perturbations. For example, if a measurement falls at a point 
such as B′ or C′ in Figure 11.12, there is an ambiguity even if the closest point on 
the spiral is not a point where the spiral crosses itself, because the measured point 
may lie closer to the wrong arc than to the right one. As already pointed out and 
illustrated in Figure 9.10, low antenna height alleviates the problem if other sys-
tem requirements permit the choice. 
There are several possible ways of resolving the ambiguities that remain after 
advantage is taken of smoothing and the lowest antenna height permitted by other 
system requirements. The simplest way, if enough time is available, is to observe 
the time history of the target, either continuously or by a series of discrete obser-
vations, as its complex indicated angle moves along part of a spiral, preferably 
through an entire loop. The trace that it makes will identify the correct arc. This 
method imposes an initial delay, but once the correct arc is identified, the target 
can be followed without further delay. 
Other possible methods of resolution of ambiguities include diversity in fre-
quency, antenna boresight angle, or antenna height. Frequency diversity, for ex-
ample, consists of making calibration spirals at two different frequencies, sepa-
rated by 5% to 10%, within the tuning band of the radar. The ambiguous regions 
on the second spiral are displaced from those on the first. Later, when measure-
ments are made on an unknown target, the same two frequencies are used in rapid 
succession and the measurements are compared with the respective calibration 
spirals. Details of such a procedure and of an experimental program have been 
reported [23]. The radar was an AN/FPS-16, a C-band radar with a 3.66-m (12-ft) 
reflector at a height of 9.9m (32.5 ft), the target was a beacon that was raised and 
lowered by an elevator on a boresight tower, and the reflecting surface was as-
phalt. Both frequency diversity and boresight diversity reduced the number of 
ambiguities, and the time history method was able to eliminate ambiguities alto-
gether if enough time was allowed. 
The calibration-spiral technique is not suitable for use over terrain whose con-
tour or reflection characteristics vary with azimuth, because this would require a 
large number of different calibration spirals, of the same order as the number of 
beamwidths in the azimuth coverage sector. Even if coverage is limited to a nar-
row azimuth sector, irregular terrain will cause an irregular spiral, which may 
make calibration impractical and may aggravate the ambiguities. 
The most promising type of application of the complex-angle calibration-
spiral technique is with a land-based antenna overlooking water (so that the mean 

 
Multipath 
299 
surface contour is regular and independent of azimuth), with a low height-to-
diameter ratio (to minimize ambiguities), and at a low frequency (to reduce dif-
fuse relative to specular multipath). A brief series of tests was conducted on the 
TRADEX radar at Kwajalein, overlooking the Pacific Ocean and operating at 
1.32 GHz with an elevation beamwidth of 11.4 mrad [24]. The diameter of the 
parabolic antenna is 25.6m (84 ft) and the height of the phase center above mean 
sea level is 26.2m (86 ft). The in-phase component of the normalized difference 
signal, used for normal tracking, is obtained in the manner shown in Figure 7.4. 
To obtain the quadrature component it is only necessary to compute an additional 
output, without hardware modification, using the sine instead of the cosine of the 
relative phase.6 
Figure 11.13 shows the results of one of the tests. The dashed curve is a cali-
bration spiral obtained from measurements on a metal sphere dropped from high 
altitude and observed as it fell through the multipath region into the ocean. The 
solid curve is the spiral obtained from a reentry body about 90 minutes later as it 
fell at approximately the same range and azimuth. The “true” elevations of both 
the sphere and the other body were obtained from another source whose errors 
were small compared with the uncorrected multipath errors of TRADEX. Before 
plotting, the measurements were smoothed by means of a sliding average to re-
duce the effects of noise and diffuse multipath. Since the reentry body descended 
more rapidly than the sphere, the smoothing necessary to reduce its noise fluctua-

convention that the nominal phase between the sum and difference signals is 0°. In TRADEX it is 
actually 90° because of the type of comparator used, and therefore sines and cosines are interchanged.

tions to an acceptable level also “shrank” the spiral, but by simply enlarging the 
resulting spiral by an appropriate scale factor a good fit to the calibration spiral 
was obtained, as seen in the figure. It may be possible to avoid the shrinkage and 
the need for compensatory enlargement by using a more sophisticated smoothing 
algorithm. 
Although the elevation calibration is essentially continuous, only a few points 
are marked on the calibration spiral, to illustrate the trend. They are indicated by 
the tick marks on the calibration spiral, labeled with the elevation in mrad. To 
determine the agreement between the two spirals, these tick marks are extended to 
the closest points on the reentry-body spiral, and those points are labeled with the 
corresponding elevations obtained from the independent source. The agreement is 
quite close down to about 1 mrad. Part of the error, especially at low angles, is 
contributed by the independent calibration source. 
Thus, it appears that the complex-angle calibration-spiral technique is capable 
of accurate elevation estimates down to very low elevations, but the conditions 
under which it can be used practically are rather restricted, and the necessity of 
generating calibration spirals and of resolving possible ambiguities imposes an 
additional operating burden. The radar must have accurate normalization so that 
the monopulse output will be independent of signal strength, and its open-loop 
calibration must also be stable. TRADEX meets these requirements but many mo-
nopulse radars do not, especially those designed only for closed-loop tracking of 
targets near the axis. 
The calibration-spiral technique is not the only method that has been pro-
posed for the use of complex-angle monopulse to combat multipath. One method 
[25] requires two or more pulses and is similar in some respects to the two-target 
solution described in Section 9.12, but differs in two ways: rather than wait for the 
relative phase between target and image to change as a result of target motion, the 
frequency is varied from pulse to pulse by an amount sufficient to change the rela-
tive phase but not the target-image amplitude ratio; and instead of measuring the 
ratio of resultant amplitudes of successive pulses to obtain enough measurements 
to equal or exceed the number of unknowns, the number of unknowns is reduced 
by using the known or assumed geometric relation between target and image. 
Still another approach is based on the principle that if the image-to-target 
relative phase is held constant while their amplitude ratio varies, the locus in the 
complex plane is a circle like one of the dotted circles in Figure 9.2. These circles 
all intersect the real axis at points corresponding to the target and image angles. 
The image-to-target amplitude ratio depends on the surface reflection coefficient 
and the beam elevation angle. Hence the approach is to vary the beam elevation 
angle from pulse to pulse in order to obtain enough points to define the arc of a 
circle, which is then extrapolated to the real-axis intersection corresponding to the 
target angle. Although this approach has a sound theoretical basis, it requires that 
the sum and difference patterns have constant phase, which is generally not true in 
practice. The phase variation with angle is typically very small near the center of

the beam, but it can become appreciable as the target or image approaches the 
edge of the beam, especially in a reflector-type antenna. The error in the extrapo-
lation can be quite large. 
11.13 
INDEPENDENT-TARGET METHODS 
Of the techniques described so far, some base their target elevation estimates on 
the same calibration functions of tracking loops that are used for a target in free 
space—by ignoring the presence of the image they incur errors when multipath is 
present. Others take the image into account in determining target elevation but 
they do so on the assumption that the image angle is related to the target angle by 
the geometry of reflection from a flat horizontal surface or from a spherical sur-
face. Therefore they are subject to error if, for example, the reflecting surface has 
an unknown slope. The only technique discussed so far that takes multipath into 
account without assuming a specific reflection geometry is the complex indicated 
angle, provided the calibration spiral is generated by means of a test target rather 
than by theoretical calculation. It can therefore be used over a sloping or an ir-
regular surface. It is, however, subject to assumption that once the calibration spi-
ral has been generated, the geometry and reflection characteristics of the surface 
remain reasonably stable. 
In an effort to remove the limitations imposed by these assumptions, some in-
vestigators have attacked the multipath problem in a different way by treating the 
target and the image as two independent unresolved targets, with no assumption as 
to their relationship in amplitude, phase, or angle (except that they are separated 
by no more than a beamwidth or so). 
When regarded in this way, the multipath problem is essentially the same as 
the general problem of two unresolved targets treated in Chapter 9 (particularly 
Section 9.15), except that the solution is needed only in the elevation coordinate. 
The discussion and references given in that chapter are therefore pertinent. 
It was shown in Section 9.12 that with two patterns, producing one voltage ra-
tio, a single-pulse solution for the locations of two independent targets is impossi-
ble even if both real and imaginary parts of the ratio are used, and that multiple-
pulse solutions, although theoretically possible, have only a limited practical po-
tential. The fact that the desired information is only the target angle, not the image 
angle, does not alleviate the problem, since the solution is not separable. All of the 
techniques discussed in the previous sections use just one pair of elevation pat-
terns, which may be conventional sum and difference patterns, modified sum and 
difference patterns, or asymmetrical “A” and “B” patterns having a symmetrical 
ratio. Hence they are unable to obtained single-pulse solutions for two indepen-
dent targets. 
Therefore techniques have been proposed that use three or more simultaneous 
elevation patterns (the multiple-beam method), or three or more voltages derived 

302 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
from individual elements or subarrays of an array antenna (the aperture-sampling 
method), to obtain sufficient information for a solution. Three beams or aperture 
samples (yielding two complex ratios) are necessary. A larger number can be used 
for overdetermination to improve accuracy. In addition to the general reference 
cited in Chapter 9, specific applications of these principles to multipath have been 
reported, including design approaches, analysis or simulation, and some testing 
[26–31]. 
The advantage of such methods is that they are immune to error resulting 
from surface slope that is unknown or that varies with time, season, or azimuth. 
They are also immune to changes in image angle due to variation in antenna 
height above sea surface as a result of tide or of platform motion, as on a ship. 
(The methods described in preceding sections can be compensated for tide, but 
knowledge of the tidal height is usually only approximate.) 
However, the independent-target methods still rely on the assumption of a 
point target and a point image.7 Because they do not make use of a priori knowl-
edge or assumptions about the geometric relations between target and image, as 
do the techniques described earlier, they depend more heavily on small differences 
among the sampled voltages or beam outputs. As a result, they have larger errors 
due to noise, diffuse multipath, imperfect knowledge of beam patterns (or element 
gains), and drifts in equipment calibration. They also require more complicated 
feeds or combining networks and more signal channels. 
11.14 
DIFFUSE MULTIPATH EFFECTS ON MONOPULSE 
There have been numerous references in the preceding sections to diffuse multi-
path, and its potential for causing errors in tracking and in the various methods of 
alleviating the problems caused by specular multipath. In discussion of these 
methods, the word image is used frequently. It is appropriate to examine each 
such use, and to evaluate how the measurement would be affected if, instead of a 
well defined point reflection, the multipath arrived at the radar antenna from a 
region spread across an area of the surface with varying angles, amplitudes, and 
phases. In this section we will review the theory of diffuse multipath, obtain some 
quantitative measure of its power and distribution in space and frequency, and 
apply those data to determine its effect on radar measurement of low-altitude tar-
get angles. 
                                                           
7  In theory, a “straightforward extension” would make it possible to handle more than one image, 
resulting from multiple specular reflections from irregular terrain. However, each additional image 
adds three unknowns: angle, amplitude, and phase. In view of the difficulty of even a single-target-
single-image solution with useful accuracy, such an extension appears remote.

11.14.1 Power of Specular and Diffuse Multipath Reflections 
In Section 11.1 the Fresnel reflection coefficient ρ0 of the surface was introduced 
to describe the amplitude of specular reflection relative to the direct signal from 
the target. Considering narrow-beam microwave systems, the region of interest is 
near 1° grazing angle where 0.75 < ρ0 < 0.98, the highest values applying to dry 
land surfaces or horizontal polarization on any surface. 
The specular scattering factor ρs that modifies the reflection amplitude for 
other than smooth surfaces was defined in (11.9), showing its dependence on sur-
face height deviation σh, wavelength λ, and grazing angle ψ. The surface area 
from which multipath reflections originate is known as the glistening surface, 
following the usage of Beckmann and Spizzichino [2]. We can describe the com-
ponents of power on that surface, relative to the power reaching the radar directly 
from the target, as follows: 
1. A fraction given by

 remains to be apportioned between “diffuse” 
(or “quasi-specular”) reflection and a wide-angle scattered compo-
nent that includes backscattered and bistatic clutter. 
The Rayleigh criterion for a “rough” surface is that the ratio (σhsinψ)/λ is 
greater than 1/8, which from (11.9) gives ρs < 0.3. When (σhsinψ)/λ = 1/15, nor-
mally considered a relatively smooth surface, the specular and diffuse components 
have equal powers =

. For a typical grazing angle ψ = 1°, this situation cor-
responds to an rms height deviation σh = 3.8λ, or 0.11m at X-band. Thus, even at 
low grazing angles, the presence of significant diffuse scattering is almost univer-
sal at X-band, and very common at S-band as well. 
Integration of the backscatter and other wide-angle scattered power, using 
currently accepted models, shows those components to represent a very small 
fraction (typically 2−3%) of the nonspecular reflected power. Since this is less 
than the uncertainty in the value of ρ0
2, it can be neglected and the reflected power 
that is not in the specular ray can be assigned to the diffuse component

from small, tilted facets of the surface and is confined to a narrow forward scatter 
sector surrounding the specular ray. The surface is described as having a normal

mean surface, and the angular spread of diffuse scattering from any small area can 

304 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
be described as a Gaussian beam with elliptical shape, having an elevation width 
(at the power level 1/e relative to its peak) given by ±2β0 and an azimuth width 
±2β0sin(ψ). Viewed from the radar antenna, the diffuse components arrive from 
the elliptical area on the surface, as shown in azimuth-elevation space in Figure 
11.14(a).  
Typical values of the slope parameter β0 for both land and sea surfaces are in 
the order of 0.05 rad = 3°. For grazing angles below 2β0, the upper elevation limit 
of the glistening surface reaches the horizon, and an intensified region is formed 
just below the horizon. Modifications to the Beckmann and Spizzichino rough-
surface scattering theory that adjust the diffuse power reaching the radar antenna 
for such low-angle situations are described in [4] and in [31, pp. 430–439].  
Over land surfaces, a vegetation absorption factor ρv multiplies the Fresnel 
coefficient, reducing both multipath components. A model in [31, p. 287] provides 
an estimate of this effect, which will not be considered further here. It should be 
kept in mind, however, that results from tests run over vegetated terrain may not 
show the multipath effects that are encountered over barren terrain or the sea.

11.14.2 Distribution of Multipath in Elevation Angle 
The effect on a null-tracking monopulse radar is analyzed using the distribution of 
multipath shown in Figure 11.15. The target appears as an impulse function with 
power S (normalized to unity as a reference for the multipath power) at elevation 
θt, and its specular image as a smaller impulse of power ρs0
2 at −θ0 ≈ −θt. The dif-
fuse components have a continuous density extending downward from the hori-
zon. The density has a peak between the horizon and the specular component, and 
decreases with depression angle. The integral of this density is equal to the total 
diffuse power

ρ ρ . In the case shown, the target elevation angle is ≈0.7 beam-
width, and the lower difference-channel lobe peaks just below the horizon, with its 
null near the specular image but with substantial response in the region of maxi-
mum diffuse intensity. The specular component of multipath error corresponds to 
the low value shown in Figure 11.4 for this target elevation. 
11.14.3 Multipath Error for Closed-Loop Tracking  
The multipath error for a monopulse radar is calculated separately for specular and 
diffuse components. The target power S in the sum channel is the product of the 
sum power gain Σ2 and the normalized target power on the axis at θt. The specular 
multipath interference I in the sum channel is the product of ρs
2 and the value of Σ2 
at the specular angle θ0. The difference-channel interference Id is the product of ρs
2 
and the value of Δ2 at the specular angle. The interference terms replace the corre-

Unless a strong specular component enters the main difference lobe, the sum-
channel interference-to-signal ratio I from multipath is small, and the final term in 
(11.19) can be neglected. Once a strong specular component enters the main dif-
ference lobe, the nose-diving phenomenon begins, and error increases rapidly be-
yond the value given in (11.19). 
The diffuse multipath density, weighted by the sum and difference pattern 
power gains, is integrated over elevation to find interference power components I 
and Id for use in calculation of the diffuse multipath error, again using (11.19). 
The specular and diffuse errors are combined in rss fashion to find total multipath 
error. 
A typical plot of error for an X-band monopulse radar in closed-loop tracking 
with a beamwidth θbw = 26 mrad = 1.5°, operating over a calm sea (state 2) with 
roughness σh = 0.11m, has been calculated using the multipath prediction proce-
dure of [31], and is shown in Figure 11.16. At target elevation angles above 1.5θe 
the specular component is negligible, and the diffuse component is below 0.01θbw. 
As the target descends below 1.5θe the diffuse component increases toward 
0.04θbw and the specular component in the first sidelobe rises to 0.02θbw. When 
the target elevation is 0.5θbw the “nose-diving” phenomenon appears, and the error 
abruptly increases to an indeterminate value, reflecting the instability and prob-
able loss of track. This corresponds to the appearance of the first severe dip in 
tracking angle and the presence of a stable image track curve in Figure 11.4.

11.14.4 Effect of Range or Doppler Resolution and Smoothing 
In Section 11.6 the use of range or Doppler resolution to reduce multipath error 
was discussed, and it was concluded that neither offered a practical solution, at 
least for surface-based radars, because of the small displacement of the specular 
component in these coordinates. The same limitation applies to diffuse multipath. 
This is illustrated in Figure 11.17 for a radar antenna at ha = 20m and a target at 
R = 20 km, ht = 100m, flying inbound at 300 m/s. The specular reflection accom-
panies the peak in diffuse reflection at 0.2-m range delay (relative to the direct 
ray), and is at the frequency fs = 0.12 Hz in Doppler. 
The ineffectiveness of smoothing, discussed in Section 11.7, also applies to 
the diffuse multipath, which in our example appears primarily at frequencies be-
tween 0.085 Hz and 0.14 Hz. Smoothing times in excess of 10 seconds would be 
required to reduced the diffuse multipath, and such times are inconsistent with 
target dynamics.

Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
11.14.5 Low-E Mode 
Section 11.8 discussed the use of a mode in which the antenna elevation is limited 
to an angle of ≈0.75 beamwidth when the indicated monopulse angle falls below 
that value. The multipath error for this mode is shown in Figure 11.18, for the 
same conditions as used in calculating Figure 11.16. The diffuse error remains 
essentially the same as for closed-loop tracking, but the specular error is limited, 
rising gradually at target elevations below 0.5θbw to reach σθ = 0.4θbw when the 
target is at 0.15θbw. The error is large enough that the elevation data becomes use-
less at target elevations below ≈0.3θbw. These results are consistent with the addi-
tion of a diffuse component to the errors illustrated in Figure 11.7. 
11.14.6 Offset-Null Tracking 
The offset-null technique described in Section 11.9 avoids nose-diving and re-
duces the specular error component. Because the difference pattern continues to 
track the target in this method, the diffuse multipath will be received with essen-
tially the same strength as in the conventional closed-loop tracker, as shown in 
Figure 11.16. The over-all effect closely matches the data shown in Figure 11.18 
for the low-E mode. 
11.14.7 Diffuse Multipath in Patterns Having a Symmetrical Ratio 
The special antenna elevation patterns shown in Figure 11.9 are designed to pro-
duce the same monopulse output ratios for sources above and below the horizon, 
eliminating error caused by the specular image. The pattern pair of Figure 11.9(a)

has substantial response in both the A and B patterns to diffuse reflections in the 
region from the horizon to −1.5θA, where θA is the beamwidth of the A pattern. 
This response is reduced in the pattern pair of Figure 11.9(b), at the expense of 
lower sensitivity to the target signal. 
By integration of the diffuse multipath density over these patterns, the error in 
the symmetrical-ratio system can be found, as shown in Figure 11.19. The pattern 
pair of Figure 11.9(b) reduces this diffuse multipath error substantially at target 
elevation angles above ≈0.7θA. However, in the presence of diffuse multipath the 
technique does not reduce the error below the level seen in Figure 11.18 for the 
low-E mode using conventional monopulse patterns and is somewhat less accurate 
below 0.7θA. Given the additional complexity of creating the patterns and merging 
the symmetrical-ratio method with normal tracking at higher elevation angles, 
there seems to be little reason to adopt this technique. 
The same problem appears in the double-null tracking technique described in 
Section 11.11. The high-density diffuse reflection occurs just below the peak 
value of the ratio plotted in Figure 9.10, and its random phase relative to the direct 
and image response causes a large elevation error to appear at the output. 
11.14.8 Complex Indicated Angle with Diffuse Multipath 
The use of complex indicated angles from a monopulse radar whose antenna has 
been fixed near 0.75θbw was described in Section 11.12, and shown to have been 
effective in reducing multipath error from the sea surface, when applied to the 
TRADEX L-band radar at Kwajalein Island (see Figure 9.13). The conditions for 
that test can be approximated for the grazing angle of the first loop in the spiral 
plotted in that figure: ψ ≈ 4.5 mrad, assuming a wavelength λ = 0.23m and a sea

state 2 (σh = 0.1m). The resulting specular scattering factor is ρs = 0.9983, corre-
sponding to a small diffuse component ρd = 0.059. Little difficulty from diffuse 
multipath would be expected. 
Another experiment [32] used a Ku-band radar with an elevation beamwidth 
θe = 1.4° = 24 mrad, operating from an antenna height of 4.7m over a calm sea 
(state 1, σh = 0.03m) at ranges from 1 to 9 km, with the target elevation angle 
varying from 25 mrad to 3 mr. Frequency diversity over a 2-GHz band was used 
to obtain samples that varied in relative phase more rapidly than would have been 
the case at a fixed frequency. The signal processor used these samples with time 
averaging to calculate the derivative of the multipath phase with respect to range, 
and from that found the target altitude, given the known antenna height and wave-
length, and the measured range. The method proved effective over the calm sea, 
but would obviously have encountered difficulty for sea states 2 and above. 
A different situation arose when testing the same technique on a C-band 
AN/FPS-16 radar over desert terrain characterized by “boondocks” with an sur-
face roughness σn ≈ 0.5m. The elevation beamwidth is θbw = 1.2° = 21 mrad, and 
the radar installation at White Sands gives an antenna height ha = 12m. When the 
target elevation is 0.5θbw = 10.5 mrad, the specular scattering factor is ρs = 0.487 
and the corresponding maximum diffuse factor is 0.873. The result, taken from the 
final report on the contract that supported the experiment, is presented in [33] and 
appears in Figure 11.20. As the target flew out to ranges near 50 km, the grazing 
angle was reduced toward zero, and a larger specular component would be ex-
pected, reducing the diffuse component. One loop of the spiral can be discerned 
where the real part of the monopulse output is negative. There is little information 
to be obtained from the imaginary part of the complex angle over the remainder of 
the plot, although the real part shows the expected increase corresponding to 
higher elevation at short range. Although attributed in the report to a problem with 
the beacon being tracked, the data show the random variations expected in a dif-
fuse multipath environment.

These results confirm the judgment expressed in Section 11.12 that the com-
plex-angle method is useful when applied to a low-sited, low-frequency antenna 
looking over water, in which case diffuse multipath is minimized. 
11.14.9 Diffuse Multipath Effect on Independent-Target Methods 
Multiple-beam and aperture-sampling solutions to the multiple-source (and multi-
path) problem were discussed briefly in Section 11.13, and several references 
were given. It was stressed that three or more beams or samples are required to 
solve for two targets (e.g., a point target and its specular image), and one addi-
tional beam or sample for each additional source. The sensitivity of these proce-
dures to noise increases steeply as the angular separation of the sources decreases 
below one beamwidth.  
As an example, in [34] a C-band aperture-sampled array and processing sys-
tem was described that minimized both specular and diffuse multipath errors. The 
aperture-sampled sum and difference beam-forming network is preceded by a 
spatial filter with response shown in Figure 11.21, designed to minimize all re-
sponse below the horizon. The thinned array of eight dipole elements had a total 
height h = 28λ, giving a standard beamwidth θ0 = 1/28 = 0.036 rad = 2.0°. This 
limited the slope of the high-pass spatial filter in the cutoff region near the hori-
zon, but its inclusion minimized all the multipath components. Simulations 
showed significant reduction in the specular multipath error, accompanied by deg-
radation in sum-channel signal-to-noise ratio up to 15 dB at target elevation of 0.1 
beamwidth (target-image separation of 0.2 beamwidth). 
Less successful was a four-element sampled-aperture array attached to a con-
ventional shipboard X-band monopulse reflector radar, the AN/SPG-53A, and 
described in a conference paper [28]. The radar beamwidth is θbw = 20 mrad. 
Simulations presented in the paper showed that the normal monopulse tracking

Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
error was σθ = 0.7θbw − 0.9θbw at target elevations between 0.125θbw and 0.376θbw. 
With the array the rms errors were reduced to σθ < 0.1θbw on a single-pulse mea-
surement and σθ ≈ 0.01θbw after averaging of 100 pulses. The paper indicated that 
results of sea trials from Pacific Ocean operations would be presented at the con-
ference. Those results turned out to show that the normal monopulse error in 
tracking below one beamwidth over the sea was σθ ≈ 2 mr, and that the errors us-
ing the aperture-sampling array were σθ ≈ 2.5 mr. It was concluded that the Pa-
cific Ocean failed to conform to the smooth-surface model for specular multipath 
that was the basis of design.  
The type of result found for the system of [28] characterizes most multiple-
beam and aperture-sampling systems designed for multiple-target estimation, be-
cause the number of multipath sources in the actual operational environment can-
not be known in advance, and exceeds the values for which practical systems can 
be designed. 
11.14.10 Summary of Multipath Mitigation Methods 
It is seen in this section that the several approaches to multipath mitigation yield 
consistent results:  
1. Many methods provide protection against the nose-diving phe-
nomenon that afflicts the closed-loop tracker over smooth surfaces.  
2. None of the methods provide accuracy in the diffuse multipath en-
vironment that is significantly better than the fixed-beam low-E 
mode of a conventional monopulse radar, and some are subject to 
larger errors or total failure for other than pure specular multipath.

3. Use of a narrow elevation beam with vertical polarization is the 
fundamental approach to obtaining accurate elevation data. 
The requirement for “pure specular” reflection can be interpreted using Figure 
11.22, which shows the ratio ρd/ρs of diffuse to specular scattering factors. The 
diffuse component may generally be neglected if it is less that 1% of the specular, 
a ratio that is available only for very smooth surfaces at very low grazing angles 
(e.g., σh/λ < 0.5 at ψ < 2 mrad). It must be considered a serious source of error if 
it is greater that 10% (e.g., σh/λ < 1.0 at ψ < 10 mrad, or σh/λ < 2 at ψ < 4 mrad). 
For X-band radar (λ = 0.03m), these values correspond to σh < 1.5 cm, 3 cm, and 
6 cm, respectively, or to sea states 0, 1, and ≈1.5. Test data confirm that the only 
method providing satisfactory reduction in multipath error is the complex-angle 
method, as applied to the low-sited L-band TRADEX radar over the Pacific Ocean 
[24] and the low-sited Ku-band radar over smooth water [32].

Monopulse Countermeasures and  
Countercountermeasures 
Deployment of monopulse radars for military use was accompanied by develop-
ment and deployment of electronic countermeasures (ECM1) equipment for use 
against them. A monopulse radar acquiring its target is subject to the same ECM 
techniques used against any type of radar, such as masking of the target by ran-
dom pulses, noise jamming, or chaff. These common techniques are discussed 
here only briefly, except when monopulse offers a solution not available in other 
types of radar. Another class of ECM techniques developed to disturb the tracking 
of sequential lobing radars has little effect on monopulse tracking. Such tech-
niques include self-protection jammers that rely on amplitude modulation to in-
duce large errors in radars that use sequential lobing. They provide a strong, point-
source signal that may actually improve monopulse tracking accuracy.  
ECM techniques used specifically against monopulse radars are designed to 
break the lock of the angle tracking loop, or at least to induce large errors, either 
by increasing errors that are naturally present in monopulse radars or by exploiting 
faulty radar design, construction, or adjustment. The first type is known as generic 
monopulse ECM. The sources of angle error in monopulse radars are listed in Ta-
ble 12.1, along with the corresponding ECM techniques. Sections of this book in 
which the errors have been discussed are listed. The present chapter discusses 
monopulse ECM techniques and their effects on tracking, as applicable to surface-
based and airborne radars and homing seekers. Limitations of ECM techniques 
and radar counters (ECCM) to them are also discussed.  
                                                           
1  Rather than the terms electronic attack (EA) and electronic protection (EP), recently coined by the 
electronic warfare community, we use here the traditional ECM and ECCM because they more clearly 
define the measures and counters applicable to monopulse, and are less likely to be replaced by yet 
another new set of terms needed to cover the diversity of military electronics. 

318 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
The first section briefly discusses the use of jamming that masks the target 
echo, either to deprive the radar of range or Doppler data or to generate erroneous 
data in those coordinates. This is followed by a discussion of generic monopulse 
ECM techniques, listed in bold type in Table 12.1. A final section deals with ECM 
that is designed to exploit weaknesses in design or manufacture of the monopulse 
radar. 
Much of the discussion in unclassified form is made possible by the published 
work of Leonov and Fomichev [1]. That book contained an entire chapter on “In-
terference Tolerance of Monopulse Radars,” in which both ECM and ECCM were 
discussed in detail, with copious references to both Russian and Western litera-
ture. We have made use of those discussions in the material that follows. 
12.1 
RANGE AND DOPPER DENIAL AND DECEPTION 
12.1.1 
Range and Doppler Denial  
Noise jamming is a robust ECM that can mask the target echo, preventing the ra-
dar from measuring range and Doppler shift of the target. When emitted from a 
jammer on the target (self-protection jamming) the jamming may provide a source 
of more accurate angle tracking in the track-on-jam or home-on-jam mode. 
12.1.1.1 
Track-on-Jam  
The monopulse angle sensing system must produce outputs that accurately indi-
cate the angle of arrival of the noise jamming, regardless of its bandwidth, spectral 
distribution, average power, amplitude distribution, and possible modulation. The 
spectral distributions of noise jammers vary widely, and may be generated by 
rapid sweeping of a narrowband signal over the band used by one or more radars.

Monopulse Countermeasures and Countercountermeasures 
319 
Jammer noise amplitude distributions, often considered to be Gaussian, exhibit 
clipping of peaks or even hard limiting, introduced to increase the average power 
of the jammer transmitter. A monopulse radar that is intended to obtain angle data 
on jammers must preserve its angle sensing capability on “signals” that differ in 
many respects from the echoes of its own transmissions. This capability in a hom-
ing seeker is known as home-on-jam, and designers of homing seekers place a 
high premium on successful performance in this mode. 
The jamming bandwidth may be wide enough to enter the monopulse receiv-
ing channels both at the frequency to which they are tuned for the target echo and 
at the image frequency (displaced by the IF from the local oscillator frequency, 
but on the opposite side from the echo). Many radar designs lack tunable RF pre-
selectors that exclude inputs at the image frequency. Unless the phase shifts of the 
sum and difference receiver channels are matched in both the RF and IF stages, 
the image-frequency contribution to the d/s output of the monopulse processor 
may fail to assist in tracking, and in case of a 90° RF phase shift that is removed 
by a −90° IF phase shift, the contributions cancel, preventing measurement or 
tracking on the jammer. This problem was corrected in the design of the AN/FPS-
16, not to provide track-on-jam but rather to permit passive tracking on the Sun 
[2]. Another solution is to use an IF that is high enough to place the image outside 
the band within which the radar can be tuned, allowing use of the more practical 
fixed-tuned RF preselector filters. 
12.1.1.2 
Weapon System Design  
The purpose of most military monopulse radars (and all homing seekers) is to 
guide a weapon to the selected target. If the target has denied range and Doppler 
measurement, a fire-control solution must be used that directs the weapon on the 
basis of angle data alone. In the case of a homing missile, proportional navigation 
(or its modern Kalman-filter equivalent) can achieve adequate performance with-
out range data (although approximate range-to-go information provides better 
end-game performance). Command guided missiles and gunfire control are more 
severely impacted by lack of range data. Triangulation from a separated radar is 
one method of obtaining approximate range on a jamming target. 
12.1.2 
Range and Doppler Deception 
Deceptive repeater jammers are designed to capture the range or Doppler tracking 
loop and the AGC system of the radar. A deception pulse is superimposed on the 
target echo in the tracking gate. Its amplitude is increased to the point where the 
echo is suppressed, and the deceptive pulse (or spectrum, for a CW or pulsed Dop-
pler radar) is then programmed to move away from the target position in range or 
Doppler. This is called range-gate pull-off (RGPO) or velocity-gate pull-off 
(VGPO). Both may be used simultaneously against pulsed Doppler radars. When 

320 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
pull-off has been accomplished (as estimated by the jammer based on anticipated 
time constants of the AGC and range or Doppler tracking loops), the deceptive 
emission is discontinued, forcing the radar to reacquire the target. Rapid reacquisi-
tion by the radar tracker is possible when the radar beam still illuminates the tar-
get, so this jamming is usually combined with an angle deception technique to 
introduce an angular rate away from the target just before the deceptive emission 
is discontinued. If that rate is large enough, the radar may be forced to reacquire in 
angle as well as in range or Doppler, and during the required angle scan no track-
ing data are provided to the weapon. Angle deception is more effective when there 
is no target echo in the range or Doppler gate that selects inputs to the angle track-
ing loops. 
Radar design to prevent effective RGPO/VGPO operation must provide either 
recognition that deception is occurring, permitting the established track to coast 
through the deception period, or rapid reacquisition after the deception cycle. Co-
ordinated range and Doppler tracking and variation of AGC time constants makes 
deception more difficult. Avoiding angle deception as discussed in Sections 12.2 
and 12.3, is a critical requirement, as is the ability to recognize the occurrence of 
angle deception. The use of monopulse information to detect the presence of unre-
solved targets (see Section 9.9) contributes to this ability if implemented in the 
radar. 
12.1.3 
Chaff Deception 
Most modern monopulse radars have Doppler-based circuits (e.g., moving target 
indication or pulsed Doppler) to reject chaff and other clutter. Rejection is based 
on the difference between the target’s radial velocity and that of the air mass in 
which airborne clutter is embedded. An aircraft self-protection technique, when 
under track by a weapon-control radar, is to release one or more chaff bursts while 
executing a turn that brings the aircraft radial velocity to zero (relative to the air 
mass). If the radar cross section of the chaff exceeds that of the target, the chaff 
echo may capture the radar track, allowing the target to move, unseen, out of the 
beam. The weapon system must recognize this event and reacquire the target to 
restore the needed guidance data.  
The counter to chaff deception is to recognize the chaff deployment and to 
coast the range and angle tracks for a period long enough that the target becomes 
resolvable in at least one coordinate. This must be done even if the target performs 
further maneuvers to deviate from the coasting track. Since chaff comes to rest in 
the air mass almost instantly, linear track coasting is often sufficient, and addition 
of a quadratic term can extend the period in which the beam illuminates the target 
and can reacquire track.  
As with active deception, the ability to recognize the occurrence of chaff de-
ception is a critical requirement, along with use of monopulse information to de-
tect the presence of unresolved targets (Section 9.9). 

 
Monopulse Countermeasures and Countercountermeasures 
321 
12.2 
GENERIC MONOPULSE ECM 
A monopulse jammer is generally carried by the target vehicle (self-protection 
ECM) or by the target vehicle in cooperation with others nearby. The equipment 
uses one or more deceptive jamming techniques, as distinguished from target 
masking. This class of ECM, known as generic monopulse ECM, exploits funda-
mental limitations of the angle sensing method that are inherent, to some extent, in 
all monopulse radars. Schleher notes in [3, p. 262]: 
Some monopulse angular jamming techniques, such as skirt and image jamming 
and cross-polarized jamming, are designed to exploit weaknesses in the implemen-
tation of the monopulse radar. Other jamming techniques, such as cross-eye, terrain 
or ground bounce, and blinking or formation jamming, are designed to attack 
weaknesses fundamental to all monopulse tracking systems. In general, it is better 
to attack fundamental weaknesses than to rely on design weaknesses. 
Designers of the generic monopulse ECM techniques seek to reproduce ef-
fects of natural sources of angle error, using emissions that increase the errors to 
the point where they may break lock of the angle tracking loops. The techniques 
may also attack the range tracking loop in order to suppress the target echo and 
achieve greater angle error than would be possible while competing with the echo. 
12.2.1 
Formation Jamming 
It was established in Section 9.10 that the average tracking point of a monopulse 
radar, in the presence of two unresolved sources, lies on the stronger of the two 
sources. If both sources fluctuate in amplitude such that the stronger source shifts 
from one to the other, the tracking point shifts accordingly if the tracking loop 
response is fast enough to follow. If the shift occurs too rapidly for the loop to 
follow, the average tracking point lies at the power centroid of the sources, and 
this applies also to more than two rapidly fluctuating sources. Formation jamming 
exploits this relationship in any of three ways. 
12.2.1.1 
Multiple Continuous Noise Jammers  
Noise jamming is a robust technique, in that it does not depend on detailed knowl-
edge of the radar waveform and processing, and can be used simultaneously 
against more than one type of threat in the operating band. In the multiple-jammer 
approach, noise jammers, each delivering power to the radar that exceeds the tar-
get echo, are carried on two or more vehicles in formation within the width of the 
main difference lobes (approximately the width of the full sum mainlobe) and at 
approximately the same range. The radar tracking point in each angle coordinate 
then lies near the power centroid of the formation. Gunfire or a missile controlled 
by the radar track is directed toward the centroid rather than to any single target. 
Targets are protected if their linear separation, corresponding to the product of 

322 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
range and the width across the lobes, exceeds the lethal diameter of the gunfire or 
missile warhead aimed at the centroid.  
One limitation in this technique is that the linear extent of the formation must 
be scaled to the range from the radar, which may not be known to the attacking 
force, and cannot easily be measured with conventional on-board equipment such 
as radar warning receivers (RWRs). As the range decreases, the separation may 
become so narrow that it fails to provide protection. The proliferation of antiair 
missiles using homing guidance, and including home-on-jam (HOJ) provisions, 
also discourages the use of continuous noise jamming. As the missile closes on the 
target formation, individual targets become resolvable and the missile homes ac-
curately on a single jammer in the formation. 
12.2.1.2 
Multiple Blinking Noise Jammers  
Use of a coordinated blinking strategy can overcome the limitations of the con-
tinuous-jamming technique. The jammers are turned on and off according to a 
pseudo-random schedule that abruptly shifts the tracking point from one to an-
other target. By holding the tracking time on any single target to less than the time 
required to establish a track and compute new gun orders or a new missile aim 
point, accurate fire control is denied. In the case of a missile, the rapid changes in 
apparent target position may cause excessive acceleration commands that saturate 
the guidance loop and cause instability or even failure of missile structure. The 
induced errors are larger than for continuous jamming because the tracking point 
shifts from one side of the formation to the other, with possible overshoot in both 
directions depending on the loop characteristics. Loss of lock is possible and reac-
quisition is made difficult. The required spacing of jamming vehicles is similar to 
that in the continuous jamming technique. 
12.2.1.3 
Decoy Jammers  
Towed decoys create false targets within the resolution cell occupied by the in-
tended target of the monopulse radar. The decoy jammer can be either self-
contained in the decoy capsule or it can amplify and emit signals generated on the 
protected aircraft and carried to the decoy over the tether. In either case the emis-
sion must be strong enough to capture the radar track and redirect the weapon 
(usually a missile) along a path that spares the aircraft. This imposes limits on the 
flight path of the aircraft relative to the radar and its associated weapon, on air-
craft maneuvers, and on the length of the tether. The weapon must be redirected 
from the path to the target to one that avoids passing within fuzing range of the 
target. This generally requires that the tether length times the sine of the angle 
between the tether and the weapon trajectory exceed the fuzing range. Physical 
limitations on tether length usually guarantee that the decoy is unresolvable in 
angle from the target, and the jamming waveform is designed to prevent range 
resolution. 

 
Monopulse Countermeasures and Countercountermeasures 
323 
There is no specific monopulse counter to the towed decoy, but the weapon 
system can be designed to reduce its effectiveness by such measures as shaped 
trajectories and large warheads. 
12.2.2 
ECCM Against Formation Jamming 
Monopulse radar counters to formation jamming include use of narrow beamwidth 
and adaptive nulling in array antennas. Narrow beamwidth is the primary mo-
nopulse ECCM against formation jamming. The narrow beam imposes a tight 
requirement on station-keeping in the jamming formation, and failure to meet the 
requirement may permit the radar to establish and maintain lock on a single target. 
At long ranges, where the station-keeping requirements are not difficult for the 
jammers to meet, the multiple-target tracking techniques discussed in Sections 
9.12–9.17 may be used to impose more difficulty on the attacking formation. 
Adaptive nulling can be applied to array antennas, which can be designed to form 
one or more nulls, even within the mainlobes of the patterns. The null locations 
adapt to the angles of jammers that use high duty cycle emissions, as is the case 
with formation jamming. The literature describing adaptive nulling is extensive 
[4–6]. Most approaches to adaptive nulling require that multiple subarrays, if not 
individual elements of the array, pass their outputs through separate receivers into 
a beamforming processor, which calculates complex weights that are applied to 
the outputs before they are summed to produce the beam. In the case of mo-
nopulse radars, the sum and both difference patterns must be formed with adaptive 
weights, and constraints are imposed on the process to preserve monopulse angle 
estimation properties on the selected target. 
12.2.3 
Cross-Eye Jamming 
The cross-eye jammer enhances the glint error already present in an extended tar-
get (see Section 10.5.1). Extreme errors can be generated if signals from two equal 
target sources arrive at the radar antenna in phase opposition (Figure 9.3). The 
tracking angle error εθ relative to the midpoint between the two sources is, from 
(9.8b) and (9.9b):

where Δθ = L/R is the angle subtended by the two sources separated by a distance 
L at range R from the radar, p is the amplitude ratio of the two sources, and φ is 
their phase difference. 
The cross-eye jammer attempts to create this situation from a single platform 
by radiating coherently related repeater signals from two separated antennas (e.g., 

324 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
on the wing-tips of an aircraft). If the null of the interferometer pattern created by 
these signals can be made to lie within the radar antenna, the sum signal s fades 
and the difference signal d is enhanced, generating a large error. The problem in 
implementing this jammer is that the interferometer null of the antenna pair must 
be positioned on the radar antenna for maximum effectiveness, and this requires 
that the two transmitted signals arrive at the radar with phase difference φ ≈180°, 
as well as near-equality in amplitude (p ≈ 1). 
The magnitude of the error, and the tolerance in amplitude and phase to pro-
duce a given error, may be estimated from (12.1). For perfect antiphase sources 
(φ = π rad) the cross-range error εx = Rεθ for a target span L at target range R is

where the approximation assumes p ≈ 1.  
Assume as an example that an antiair missile warhead has a nominal lethal 
radius of 15m, and that a miss distance of at least 60m from the center of the tar-
get aircraft is required to ensure its survival. For an aircraft with wingspan 
L = 15m, assuming that the error is dominated by a cross-eye jammer, the cross-
eye gain and phase tolerances can be specified as follows: 
• If the phase between the two repeater outputs is exactly π rad, their 
amplitudes must be equal within ±2.2 dB (0.778 < p < 1.286). The 
cross-eye null is pointed exactly at the center of the radar antenna 
and for p = 0.778 or 1.286 has a depth 12.2 dB below the sum of the 
two sources. 
• If the amplitudes differ by 1.0 dB (p = 0.891 or 1.122), the phase 
difference φ must be within π ± 0.125 rad (180° ± 7.16°). It turns 
out that an amplitude ratio of 1.0 dB is near the optimum value, 
since for ratios nearer unity the error spike becomes narrower and 
the allowable phase error decreases. The null depth is 18.8 dB be-
low the coherently added sum of the two sources. The spacing of 
wingtip antennas on the aircraft corresponds to Δφ = 2πL/λ radians 
of phase, or 1,000π radians at X-band. The tolerance in pointing the 
null is (π − φ)/Δφ = ±40 μrad relative to the center of the radar an-
tenna. If these tolerances can be held, and if the resulting cross-eye 
input to the sum channel exceeds the echo signal by a sufficient 
margin, the radar is subject to the error, and may lose lock as the er-
ror varies with variations in phase and amplitude.  
More detailed analysis of the cross-eye jammer can be found in [7]. 
The cross-eye errors given by (12.1) and (12.2) are based on the assumption 
that the target echo signal is absent or very small relative to the cross-eye jamming 

 
Monopulse Countermeasures and Countercountermeasures

in the sum channel. This allows the denominator of (12.1) to approach zero 
(±0.125) to produce a cross-range error εx = 4L. According to [1, p. 259], effective 
cross-eye jamming must be 20 dB above the target echo. This can be reduced to 6 
dB if range or Doppler deception is used to pull the tracking gate off the target 
echo. 
Implementation of the cross-eye jammer is difficult, and practical methods 
are subject to both proprietary and classification restrictions. The basic method is 
shown in Figure 12.1. Each of the two antennas is connected through waveguide 
and a circulator to the input of one repeater amplifier and to the output of the 
other, so that signals received by each antenna are amplified and retransmitted 
through the other. If the paths between the two antennas were exactly equal, the 
retransmitted signals would add coherently at the radar, but a phase shift of 180° 
is placed in one path to place them in antiphase. Variation in the attitude of the 
aircraft does not disturb this 180° phase relationship, so all that is necessary is to 
maintain adequate antenna gain in the direction of the radar, approximate ampli-
tude balance between the two retransmitted signals, and adequate gain to make the 
signals dominate the echo at the radar.  
The cross-eye antenna outputs must be isolated from each other by a factor 
greater than the gain of the repeater amplifiers to avoid forming a self-excited 
oscillator. The total repeater gain Grep can be defined as the ratio of its effective 
radiated power PjGj in the direction of the radar to the input signal Srj from the 
radar. Schleher [8] derived an expression for the effective radar cross section σe of 
a repeater:

oscillation, the product of electronic gain and coupling between antennas (and 
between isolated terminals of the circulator) must be less than unity, which in this 
case imposes difficult requirements on both the circulators and the antennas (in-
cluding coupling through the aircraft structure). The problem may be solved by a 
combination of careful design and high-rate commutation (gating) that allows only 
one of the amplifiers to operate at a given instant. 
12.2.4 
Surface-Bounce Jamming 
The problem of monopulse tracking in the presence of multipath at low elevation 
angles was discussed in Chapter 11. The low-angle target can increase the track-
ing error and potentially break the tracking loop by emitting jamming that is di-
rected toward the surface, increasing the ratio p of reflected to direct signals in 
(11.3) and (11.4). When that ratio exceeds unity, the tracking point shifts from the 
target to its image. The geometry of surface-bounce jamming is shown in Figure 
12.2. 
Major problems in surface-bounce jamming are: to ensure that the signal 
emitted by the jammer sidelobe along the direct jammer-to-radar path, shown 

 
Monopulse Countermeasures and Countercountermeasures 
327 
dashed in the figure, is a small fraction of that in the mainlobe directed to and re-
flected from the surface; and to redirect the radar mainlobe, which may be track-
ing the target before jamming begins, to the reflected image. The ratio p of re-
flected to direct signal voltage is 
 
mlj
slj
p
G
G
= ρ
 
(12.6) 
Here Gmlj and Gslj are the jammer antenna mainlobe and sidelobe power gains and 
ρ = ρ0ρv is the product of the Fresnel reflection coefficient of the surface (Figure 
11.2) and a vegetation coefficient ρv < 1 applicable to most land surfaces. When 
the target elevation angle is less than ≈0.7θbw, the reflected jamming will lie 
within the radar antenna’s mainlobe, and for p > 1 the track will then rapidly jump 
to the image angle (or to the angle of peak intensity of the glistening surface, if the 
reflection is predominantly diffuse). When the target elevation exceeds 0.7θbw the 
radar can maintain angular resolution on the target, requiring a much larger re-
flected signal to cause transfer to the image.  
The transfer to the image for targets above 0.7θbw is made easier if strong dif-
fuse reflection is present. As shown in Figure 11.15, diffuse reflections typically 
extend upwards from the image to the horizon, and a fraction of the diffuse power 
can enter the lower mainlobe of the difference pattern when the target is tracked at 
elevations as high as about 1.4θbw. In this case a ratio Gmlj/Gslj somewhat greater 
than would be required for a target below 0.7θbw is necessary to transfer of the 
track from target to the underlying surface. 
Monopulse radar counters to surface-bounce jamming include reduction in 
surface reflection coefficients from presence of vegetation and use of vertical po-
larization. Tracking over the sea, and over barren or snow-covered land, precludes 
reliance on absorption by vegetation. Exploitation of the drop in reflection coeffi-
cient for vertical polarization near the pseudo-Brewster angle (see Figure 11.2) 
has been a standard practice for minimizing multipath errors in tracking radars, 
and makes surface-bounce jamming more difficult, especially at elevation angles

Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
above 1°. Some of the multipath remediation techniques described in Chapter 11 
can reduce the effectiveness of surface-bounce jamming as well. They may pre-
vent transfer of the track to the image, but as with natural multipath they can only 
reduce, not eliminate the error.  
Surface-bounce jamming can be either noise jamming (with sufficient power 
to exceed the echo) or a repeater signal. The use of noise ensures that the radar 
cannot exploit the sum of repeater delay and reflection delay to perform a leading-
edge track on the direct-path signal. 
12.2.5 
Bistatic Jamming 
Surface-bounce is one form of bistatic jamming, but is limited to low-elevation 
targets. At high altitudes, reflection of jamming from chaff can be used to create 
angle errors in monopulse (as well as other) radars. The requirements for effective 
bistatic jamming from a chaff burst are discussed in [9, p. 502]. A chaff burst is 
illuminated by the mainlobe of the jammer on the protected target, while the jam-
mer illuminates the radar directly only through sidelobes. For chaff with bistatic 
radar cross section σb at range R1 from the radar and R2 from the protected target, 
where the target is at range R ≈ R1 from the radar, the ratio of bistatic to direct 
jamming received by the radar is

(12.7) 
where Gmlj and Gslj are the jammer antenna mainlobe and sidelobe power gains. 
The requirement is that Jb/Jd > 1 at a range R2 such that a weapon directed at the 
chaff reflection will spare the protected target. 
As an example, assume the following parameters: 
• 
σb = 100 m2; 
• 
R2 = 500m; 
• 
Jb/Jd = 2. 
The required jammer mainlobe-to-sidelobe ratio is Gmlj/Gslj = 6.3 × 104 = 48 dB. 
The bistatic jamming power must be strong enough to obscure the echo from the 
aircraft. For the parameters shown, the bistatic jamming power delivered to the 
radar is a factor σb/(4πR2
2) = 3 × 10−5 times what would be delivered by the same 
jammer in a self-screening mode, using its mainlobe to illuminate the radar. Thus 
bistatic jamming requires about 45 dB more power than would be required for 
self-screening at the same range.  
The advantage of the bistatic jamming mode, of course, is that it prevents tar-
get angle measurement by the track-on-jam technique. The disadvantage is that it 
requires dense chaff with large bistatic cross section within the jammer mainlobe 

 
Monopulse Countermeasures and Countercountermeasures 
329 
at a range not exceeding 500m. If the jammer mainlobe gain is 30 dB (assuming 
sidelobes at −18 dB), the corresponding beamwidth is 5°, and chaff of adequate 
cross section must lie within the 40m × 40m cross-range width of the beam at 
500m range from the aircraft. Assuming a roughly spherical chaff burst, the re-
quired density is ≈0.0024 m2/m3, much higher density than would be expected in 
an extended corridor of chaff. Hence, a succession of chaff packages would have 
to be launched from the aircraft to sustain the bistatic jamming. For this reason, 
bistatic jamming via chaff appears to be an unlikely threat to monopulse radars.  
It has been suggested that corner reflectors or similar retroreflecting shapes, 
located on platforms launched from the protected aircraft, would overcome the 
limitations of chaff as sources of bistatic reflection. A problem with this approach 
is that the retroreflector concentrates its power in the direction of the source, 
rather than scattering it over a broad angular sector in which the victim radar 
might be located. In the case of an aircraft approaching a radar, a retroreflector 
towed behind the aircraft would be effective as long as the aircraft maintained its 
approach toward the radar. A triangular corner reflector with sides of length 
a = 0.25m has a cross section σ = 18 m2 at X-band. The width of the reflected lobe 
is 4°, so the reflector-to-aircraft line would have to be maintained within ±2° of 
the aircraft-to-radar line to use it for bistatic jamming. For reasonable tether 
lengths this would violate the requirement that the weapon aimed at the reflector 
avoid passing the target within fuzing range. 
 
12.3 
EXPLOITATION OF RADAR FAULTS 
Although the requirements for near-ideal monopulse operation are well known 
and technically achievable, most actual monopulse radars are forced to compro-
mise on cost, weight, complexity, maintainability, and producibility of their com-
ponent and subsystems. The result is to create opportunities for clever jamming 
techniques to degrade or deny the angle data needed in the military system, with-
out investing in equipment that is successful against monopulse radars in general. 
The designers of this nongeneric ECM equipment have the burden of showing that 
the probability of successful jamming is high enough to justify investment in pro-
ducing and installing the equipment in aircraft and other vehicles that are the tar-
gets of monopulse radars. This showing requires detailed information on the de-
sign features, production tolerances, and actual operation of the victim radars, 
obtained through intelligence or exploitation of actual equipment. The ability to 
program flexible emissions from digitally controlled ECM equipment and observe 
their effects on radar operation is an important factor in success. The ability of the 
radar designers to program flexible waveform generation, receiving, and process-
ing equipment is similarly important in countering the ECM. 

330 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
12.3.1 
Cross-Polarized Jamming 
The use of cross-polarized jamming (usually referred to as cross-pol) is sometimes 
considered a generic monopulse ECM technique, but since many modern mo-
nopulse radars have insignificant response to such jamming it is listed here as an 
exploitation of faulty design. The principle of angle deception by emitting a strong 
signal with polarization orthogonal to that used by the radar is well known and has 
been discussed in [1, pp. 238–253]. 
The effect of antenna response to a cross-polarized echo component was dis-
cussed in Section 10.4.3. A target component that is reflected to the radar aperture 
with polarization orthogonal to that for which the radar is designed is accepted 
with a small response by most antennas. The cross-polarized sum pattern for an 
antenna with symmetry about its center has a null on the axis with positive and 
negative lobes beside the null, similar to the usual difference pattern. The cross-
polarized difference pattern has a lobe on the axis (Figure 10.9). The normalized 
monopulse output d′/s′ in the presence of an input that includes a cross-polarized 
component ecp is

where e and ecp are the field strengths in the intended- and cross-polarizations, d,

larizations, εcp is the error term, and the approximation assumes ecpscp << es. The 
error in angle is then

(12.9) 
The polarized response ratio dcp/s for typical monopulse antennas is −30 to −40 
dB, near the antenna axis, so with ecp/e < 1 the error is normally small. 
The cross-pol jammer exploits the cross-polarized response of the monopulse 
antenna by transmitting to the radar a signal with polarization orthogonal to that 
for which the antenna is designed: ecp >> e. If this ratio overcomes the 30 to 40 dB 
cross-pol rejection of the antenna, the error from (12.9) reaches or exceeds half 
the beamwidth, and the track becomes unstable and may be lost. 
When the cross-pol input is large, the term ecpscp in the denominator of (12.8) 
cannot be neglected. When it becomes large enough to dominate the input to both 
the sum and difference channels, the monopulse output d′/s′ has a sharp peak that 
switches from positive to negative on the axis, establishing two null points near 
the half-power beamwidth. Depending on the relative phase of the d′ and s′ lobes, 

 
Monopulse Countermeasures and Countercountermeasures 
331 
these nulls may be stable track points or unstable points tending to force the an-
tenna further off target. 
Figure 12.3 shows the basic method of repeating a radar signal with orthogo-
nal polarization. In the diagram, antennas accepting 45° and 135° linear polariza-
tions are connected through circulators to a pair of RF amplifiers such that the 45° 
component is retransmitted at 135° and vice versa. Whatever the radar polariza-
tion, the repeated pulse is orthogonal to it. The problem of avoiding self-
oscillation is similar to that of the cross-eye jammer, described in Section 12.2.3. 
The presence of a target echo with the intended polarization tends to overcome the 
jamming effect, so in this case also it is desirable to combine range or Doppler 
deception to pull the tracking gate off the target and leave pure cross-pol jamming 
as the input. The small response of the sum channel antenna to the cross-pol signal 
requires the range or Doppler deception process to use considerably higher power 
than would be required without cross-pol, but in a repeater that power level can be 
obtained without undue difficulty. 
The basic monopulse radar counter to cross-pol jamming is minimization of 
the antenna cross-polarized response. In a parabolic reflector antenna, this re-
sponse (the so-called Condon lobes) is caused by the curvature of the surface, and 
is reduced with higher f /D ratios. Cassegrain antennas using the polarization-twist 
technique (see Figure 4.6) are relatively immune to cross-pol jamming, because 
the polarization-sensitive subreflector fails to reflect the cross-pol component to 
the feed. A dual-polarization antenna option offers the ability to provide accurate 
tracking outputs on either polarization, but the complexity and cost of this ap-
proach has prevented its wide application. 
Many monopulse airborne radar and seeker antennas use flat-plate antennas 
composed of slotted waveguides. Such an antenna would have reasonably pure 
polarization except for slot elements near the periphery, where there is interaction 
with the (usually circular) edge of the structure. Especially in seeker antennas that 
are relatively small, this creates significant cross-polarized response. The radome

Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
is also a source of cross-polarized response, especially in high-velocity missiles 
where a thick, elongated radome is necessary. 
Surface-based phased-array antennas can be designed for low cross-polarized 
response, especially if they are large enough that only a small fraction of the ele-
ments are affected by proximity to the edges. The design described in Section 7.3, 
using circular polarized (CP) Faraday-rotator phase shifters with polarization du-
plexing has excellent immunity to cross-pol jamming. The array focuses incoming 
signals on the feed only if they have the correct sense of CP. In addition, signals 
of the wrong sense that do reach the duplexing grid are diverted into the path to 
the transmitter, rather than the receiver. 
12.3.2 
Exploiting Phase and Gain Imbalance 
The effect of imbalance between sum- and difference-channel receivers has been 
discussed in Chapter 8 and Section 10.4.1. A phase imbalance causes the mo-
nopulse calibration curve for most types of processor to change, introducing errors 
in off-axis measurement. It also combines with comparator errors to introduce a 
bias error. These effects are normally small, but if the phase shift between chan-
nels approaches or exceed about 45° the effect on servo loop gain can cause insta-
bility. In the limit, if the shift reaches 90°, the monopulse output drops to zero, 
and beyond that angle the sense of the error is reversed, introducing an unstable 
null on the axis. The target is then tracked on one of the opposite-slope nulls in the 
d/s curve, near the edge of the mainlobe. 
A countermeasure technique that can introduce a 90° phase difference is skirt-
frequency jamming, in which a repeater or other jamming source responds to illu-
mination from the radar with a strong signal that is offset from the center fre-
quency of the radar signal by an amount estimated to place the jamming at the 
edge of the receiver bandpass. Receiver gain and phase characteristics over the IF 
band are shown, for a typical response formed by multiple, stagger-tuned filters, 
in Figure 12.4. While the filters in the two channels are designed for identical 
phase and gain characteristics over most of the response, these may not be con-
trolled carefully enough to retain their match in the skirt region, where phase 
changes rapidly with frequency. A jamming signal in that region may pass the 
sum and difference channels with relative phase that reaches 90°. The receiver 
response characteristics must be known for the jammer to exploit this problem, 
but it is possible for the jammer to probe the radar with different offset frequen-
cies until a track disturbance is sensed, and then to use that frequency is subse-
quent jamming. 
The basic radar counter to this technique is to design and fabricate the receiv-
ing filters to avoid approaching 90° phase difference anywhere in the response 
band of the filter. If this cannot be done, it is possible to place in each channel a 
narrow, single-tuned filter, centered within the bandwidth of the multiple filters, 

 
Monopulse Countermeasures and Countercountermeasures 
333 
whose phase varies only over ±90° over the band of significant response. Filters of 
this type maintain phase match between channels that is a small fraction of 90°. 
Modern radars using pulse compression are designed with complex filters that can 
retain their channel-to-channel match more accurately than the stagger-tuned fil-
ters used in earlier radars. 
12.3.3 
Exploiting AGC Response 
A common normalization procedure in monopulse radar is to develop and AGC 
control voltage from the sum-channel output and use this to control the gains of all 
three receivers. While instantaneous AGC action is possible (using a time constant 
that is a fraction of the pulsewidth), it has been shown in Section 10.1.10 that such 
a response leads to increased tracking error on fluctuating targets, so an AGC that 
averages at least several pulses is often used instead. Such an AGC becomes vul-
nerable to a form of amplitude-modulated jamming sometimes called intermittent 
jamming (see Figure 12.5). 
The diagram shows a jammer operating with about 40% duty cycle, the on-
times selected to match the AGC response time. The voltages shown represent the 
envelopes of signal, noise, and jamming pulse trains. When the high-amplitude 
repeater jamming appears in the range gate of the receiver, whose gain has been 
set to place the target echo in the useful response range of the receiver, the re-
ceiver is driven into saturation. After one or two AGC time constants, the gain has 
been reduced so that useful track data are available on the jamming signal. At this 
time the jammer turns off, dropping the receiver output below the usable range. 
After another one or two time constants, the AGC has increased the gain to place 
 
Figure 12.4   Skirt-frequency jamming. 

334 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
the target echo in the useful range, at which point the jammer turns on again to 
force saturation. If the jammer on and off times are correctly chosen relative to the 
AGC attack and recovery time constants, the periods of trackable outputs are re-
duced to the point where the angle tracking loops cannot function. 
The radar counters to this type of jamming are to extend the dynamic range 
over which trackable outputs can be obtained, to use instantaneous AGC or loga-
rithmic normalization and accept the resulting fluctuation errors, or to have avail-
able alternative time constants that can be selected to make the jamming less ef-
fective. The jammer designers or operators must have some knowledge of the 
AGC time constants in order to select the on and off time sequence of the jam-
ming, and the effectiveness of AGC jamming is uncertain if this information is 
denied. When the radar uses a Doppler process (e.g., MTI) for clutter rejection, 
the receiver gains must normally remain fixed during the coherent processing in-
terval of the Doppler circuits. Clutter rejection is compromised if gain variation is 
introduced during this interval, so a combination of active and passive jamming 
makes countercountermeasures more difficult. 
12.3.4 
Exploiting Image Response 
The image-frequency jammer transmits a signal that is offset by the IF from the 
radar receiver’s local oscillator, but on the opposite side from the radar transmis-
sion. The intent is to reverse the output polarity of the phase-sensitive error detec-
tor, creating an unstable null on the tracking axis. This technique is applicable 
when the sum and difference outputs of the comparator, with 90° relative RF 
phase, have been brought into phase equality with a 90° IF phase shift in either 
 
Figure 12.5   AGC jamming technique. 

 
Monopulse Countermeasures and Countercountermeasures 
335 
receiver channel. A strong jamming input at the image frequency can then over-
come the target error signal and force the tracking point to what is otherwise an 
unstable null near the edge of the mainlobe. Knowledge of the IF is required, but 
if this is unavailable the jammer can probe with a variable offset from the received 
radar frequency until it detects a track disturbance. 
Radar counters to this technique include use of an RF preselector filter that 
excludes the image frequency from the input to the mixer, or placing the 90° 
phase shifter in the RF portion of one receiver, rather than at IF. The image-
frequency output of the receivers then has the same phase as the normal output, 
allowing the radar to track as well on that response as on the target echo. This 
method was used in the AN/FPS-16 radar [9], where the comparator output phases 
were equalized with phase shifters in the RF portion of each difference channel, 
and receiver internal phase shifts with IF phase shifters. It was found that this pro-
cedure permitted passive tracking on wideband radiation from the sun, and the 
same procedure would permit tracking on a wideband noise jammer as well as on 
an image-frequency jammer. 
Use of a fixed-tuned RF preselector restricts the tuning band of the radar sys-
tem to less than twice the IF. A tunable preselector is often impractical, both be-
cause of its loss and the limited tuning rate of mechanically tuned filters. Modern 
radars tend to use double-conversion receivers with a high frequency for the first 
IF to permit electronic tuning over a 10% band while eliminating image response. 
12.3.5 
Two-Frequency Jamming 
In the absence of an RF preselector, the radar receiver is vulnerable to a technique 
known as two-frequency jamming, in which two strong signals, separated by the 
radar IF, are emitted anywhere in the RF bandpass of the radar [1, pp. 253–256]. 
High jamming levels are required to produced a cross-product in the mixers of the 
monopulse receivers that will dominate their outputs, suppressing the downcon-
verted target echo. The relative phase of the outputs fails to follow the input phase 
of the d and s from the radar comparator, and error sensing becomes impossible. 
Radar counters to two-frequency jamming are: (1) inclusion of an RF prese-
lector with a bandwidth narrower than the IF, or (2) use of direct amplitude-
comparison between the pairs of component beams that are used to form the sum 
and difference patterns of the antenna. Option (1) is best implemented with dou-
ble-conversion receivers and a high first IF, to preserve electronic tunability of the 
radar over a broad band. Option (2) is an alternative if ports are available corre-
sponding to the component beams.

Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
12.3.6 
Jamming at the Commutation Frequency 
Two-channel monopulse systems such as conopulse (Section 8.17) combine the 
two difference outputs of the comparator sequentially, to permit processing with 
only two receiver channels instead of three. This opens a vulnerability to jamming 
that is amplitude modulated at the commutation frequency of the difference-
channel combiner. If the two receiver channels are perfectly matched, no error 
should result from such AM jamming. But if there is an imbalance between the 
channels, a fraction of the AM appears at the output and an angle error results. In 
principle, the commutation frequency does not appear in the transmitted output of 
the radar, but in most cases there is some leakage or mismatch that causes a small 
modulation to appear on the transmission, and this can be detected and exploited 
by the jammer. A similar vulnerability applies to three-channel monopulse when 
commutation is used to remove bias errors in the detectors (see Section 8.12). The 
errors that can be produced by AM jamming in this case are small, but they may 
be sufficient to increase the miss distance of command-guided missiles or gunfire.

Chapter 13 
Tracking Radar Applications of  
Monopulse  
The AN/FPS-16, a range instrumentation radar designed during the 1950s, has 
been used several times in previous chapters as an example of a monopulse track-
ing radar. Details of that radar have been widely presented in the literature, and it 
serves to illustrate many of the principles discussed in this book. After over fifty 
years of use, that radar remains in operation at United States and foreign test 
ranges. Similar monopulse radars have been designed in both the United States 
and other countries for instrumentation and military applications. 
In this chapter we will review several examples of monopulse tracking radars 
that depart from the technology represented by the AN/FPS-16. Surface-based 
monopulse radars, including those using phased array techniques, will be covered 
in the first section, and airborne radars in a second section. The final section will 
consider a class of monopulse radar whose production numbers have greatly ex-
ceeded all the surface-based and airborne systems: the homing seeker, used 
against both air and surface targets. 
13.1 
SURFACE-BASED MONOPULSE TRACKING RADARS 
13.1.1 
AN/FPS-49 and TRADEX Radars 
The AN/FPS-49 search/track radar was designed at RCA in the 1950s as an ele-
ment of the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS). It had been con-
ceived as a vastly scaled-up UHF derivative of the AN/FPS-16, its detection range 
increased from that radar’s 200 km to 4,000 km on 1-m2 targets (an increase of 
52 dB in scaled parameters of the radar equation). Of that increase, 25 dB was an 
increase in average power from 1 kW to 300 kW; 17 dB resulted from the antenna

aperture area, scaled from a diameter of 12 ft to 84 ft (3.66m to 25.6m); 7 dB was 
a reduction in noise figure from 10 dB to 3 dB, and the remaining 3 dB resulted 
from longer integration time. The TRADEX radar [1, 2], shown in Figure 13.1, 
was based on the AN/FPS-49 design but included also an L-band channel, multi-
ple polarizations, and pulsed Doppler tracking for measurement of reentry vehicle 
characteristics at the Kwajalein test range. 
TRADEX was the first monopulse radar to use pulsed Doppler tracking, dem-
onstrating that the phase matching required in monopulse receivers could be main-
tained through the Doppler filtering process. The feed used the five-horn configu-
ration of Figure 4.11, where transmission occurs only through the central horn. 
Provision is made to shift from linear polarization at 45° or 135°, to right- or left-
hand circular polarization. Horns for the difference patterns use horizontal polari-
zation in traverse and vertical polarization in elevation, as was the case with the 
AN/FPS-49. Thus, only half the power of the echo signal contributed to the differ-
ence channel in each coordinate, but the feed horns and comparator network are 
simplified. Use of circular polarization is necessary for BMEWS to make target

detection insensitive to the Faraday rotation of the ionosphere. TRADEX, after 
many modifications and upgrades, remains in use today, while the AN/FPS-49 
radars have been replaced by phased array systems. 
13.1.2 
Patriot AN/MPQ-53 Multifunction Radar 
The AN/MPQ-53 radar of the Patriot surface-to-air missile system (Figure 13.2) is 
a true multifunction radar, in that it performs all the search, multitarget tracking, 
and missile guidance functions required in the system. The array is a space-fed 
lens, using the five-layer monopulse feed of Figure 6.9. The feed may be seen 
raised above the roof of the equipment shelter in Figure 13.2. Its design drew 
heavily on the multimode technology [3] originated by Hannan at Wheeler Labo-
ratories. The array uses 5,500 nonreciprocal, latching ferrite phase shifters, radiat-
ing vertical polarization into space in front of the array through dielectrically 
loaded circular waveguide elements. Rear radiation focused on the feed is through 
printed dipoles. Since the phase shifter settings for transmission must be changed 
for reception, it is possible to place the transmitting horn beside the monopulse 
receiving horn assembly, as shown in Figure 6.9, avoiding the need for a circula-
tor or other high-power duplexing device. This technique is known as space du-
plexing, and reduces the losses in both the transmitting and receiving paths, as 
well as allowing more refined monopulse horn designs that avoid the high power 
levels of the transmitting horns. Solid-state receiver protection (to handle power 
reflected from the lens) is still needed at the receiver inputs.

Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
Monopulse tracking is performed on up to 100 targets, of which nine may be 
engaged simultaneously. Since most of the tracking is performed using single-
pulse transmissions, the normalization of the monopulse outputs is performed us-
ing instantaneous AGC in a feed-forward configuration. The large auxiliary an-
tenna shown in Figure 13.2 communicates with the missile seeker in the so-called 
target-via-missile (TVM) mode. In this form of semiactive homing, the echoes of 
the illumination waveform transmitted by the main array are picked up in the 
seeker antenna, amplified, and transmitted to the radar on this TVM link, where 
they receive monopulse processing before being used to compute acceleration 
commands that are returned to the missile. The separate TVM antenna is needed 
because the missile may be outside the beamwidth of the main array that illumi-
nates the target. Five smaller auxiliary antennas provide inputs for sidelobe can-
cellation (SLC) loops to protect the main array channels from jamming. Those 
loops null the interference in all three monopulse channels. 
13.1.3 
Russian Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) Guidance Radars 
The space-fed array, having appeared initially in the Patriot radar, found favor 
with Russian designers of monopulse radars used for SAM guidance. The primary 
examples are the fire control radar of the SA-10 and SA-20 systems, which have 
been given the NATO names Flap Lid and Tombstone (see Figure 7.2). The lens 
array of these systems, roughly the same size as in Patriot, operates at X-band, and 
is composed of 10,000 elements, in which the phase shifters are of the Faraday 
rotator type. The choice of X-band gives a narrower beam, higher effective radi-
ated power, and improved angular accuracy as compared to C- or S-band used in 
comparable U.S. systems. A separate search radar is used to designate targets for 
tracking by the monopulse radar of each system. 
The monopulse feed uses the multilayer, multimode principles originated by 
Hannan, optimizing both the sum and difference illuminations to balance effi-
ciency and difference slope against spillover and taper loss. The polarization du-
plexer system used in these radars (see Figure 7.3) avoids the loss of the ferrite 
circulator used in most high-power radars. The array phase shifters constitute the 
most significant loss in the RF system, as there is no duplexer and only minimal 
loss from short waveguide lengths and from the radomes covering the polarizing 
grid and the front face of the lens. The design also avoids the loss normally en-
countered in solid-state receiver protection devices by using as the low-noise RF 
preamplifier an electrostatic amplifier that withstands any reflected power from 
the lens and recovers instantly to amplify received signals with a low noise figure. 
Total RF losses are in the order of 3 dB lower than in comparable U.S. space-fed 
arrays. 
The same array geometry is used in a series of Russian and Chinese fire con-
trol radars for the SA-21 and HQ-9 SAM systems, the latter operating in C-band 
rather than X-band. 

 
Tracking Radar Applications of Monopulse 
341 
The Russian SA-12 fire control radar, NATO designation Grill Pan, also uses 
a space-fed lens but with in a more conventional feed approach (Figure 13.3). 
There are two alternative feeds: one is located on the axis of the lens when it has 
the tilt shown in the figure, for air-target coverage; a second feed is located to 
support a tilt to higher elevations, for the system’s ballistic-missile defense mode. 
Both feeds generate circular polarizations, with opposite senses for transmitting 
and receiving through the Faraday rotator phase shifters. 
The figure shows the IFF antenna mounted above the radar array, and three 
auxiliary antennas that feed SLC systems. These are gimbaled for mechanical 
steering to bring their gains to bear on the sector surrounding the engaged targets.

342 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
As with the auxiliary SLC arrays on the Patriot antenna, the gain of these antennas 
avoids the need to use large weights in coupling their outputs into the main receiv-
ing channels, adding only small extra noise components to those receivers. 
13.1.4 
Aegis AN/SPY-1 Radar 
In naval fire control, the U.S. Aegis AN/SPY-1 and its successor radars are exam-
ples of multifunction radar design using monopulse in their tracking modes. Fig-
ure 13.4 shows a U.S. Navy cruiser equipped with these radars, of which the aft 
and portside arrays are visible. A similar pair of octagonal arrays covers the for-
ward and starboard sectors. Each pair of arrays is fed by a transmitter consisting 
of 32 crossed-field amplifier modules, one module feeding each transmitting sub-
array of 128 elements. Transmitter outputs are switched sequentially from one to 
the other of the antennas in each pair to cover its 180° azimuth (bearing) sector. 
Additional receiving elements bring the phase-shifter count to 4,480, divided 
among 140 receiving subarrays of 32 elements each.  
The feed design for the AN/SPY-1A system is shown in Figure 13.5. Within 
each of ten array columns, pairs of 32-element subarrays are combined in magic-
Ts. A 0° phase shift (during a transmitter pulse) or 180° phase shift (during the 
listening period) is introduced in the individual elements of one of the subarrays to 
 
Figure 13.4   U.S. Navy Aegis cruiser, showing the aft/portside arrays of the AN/SPY-1 radar.

connect the pair to either a transmitter or receiver port of the magic-T. Two adja-
cent pairs are combined (128 elements) and fed from one transmitter module, 
while separate receiver outputs (64 elements) are retained for combination in the 
column receiving feed. Each column feed produces a sum and elevation-
difference output. The elevation difference outputs of the ten columns are com-
bined in a horizontal network to provide the array elevation difference signal. The 
elevation sum outputs go to an azimuth network that generates the array azimuth 
and sum outputs. 
In the AN/SPY-1B and subsequent versions of the radar, the receiving subar-
ray structure is refined to avoid the amplitude quantization effects of equal 
weighting within each 64-element receiving subarray. The refined subarray struc-
ture also permits optimization of the monopulse sum and difference illumination 
functions, using networks similar to the Lopez feed shown in Figure 7.8. The 32-
module transmitter design is retained, providing very high total output power from 
the array as well as graceful degradation of performance in the event of failure of 
a high-power crossed-field amplifier.

AIRBORNE MONOPULSE TRACKING RADARS 
13.2.1 
Multimode Fighter Radars 
The multimode fighter radar has evolved over several decades as the dominant 
sensor for use in fighter/attack aircraft worldwide. Virtually all these radars oper-
ate in X-band, and their modes include search, target acquisition, tracking, and 
ground mapping. A typical example from the era preceding the advent of phased 
array systems is the AN/APG-63 (Figure 13.6). The photograph shows the com-
plex waveguide network behind the flat-plat antenna, that provides monopulse 
difference channels as well as the sum channel that is used also for nontracking 
modes. The monopulse implementation in this radar uses two receiver channels, 
the difference channel being shared between azimuth and elevation (pitch and 
yaw) coordinates. 
13.2.2 
Electronically Scanned Fighter Radars 
The current standards for multimode airborne radars require electronic scanning, 
and the active electronically scanned array (AESA) has become the preferred ap-
proach. The United States leads in development of these systems, but details of 
the several current designs remain unpublished. Papers describing the Zhuk-ME, a 
Russian AESA radar, have appeared, and a model of this radar was shown at the 
Moscow Air Show in 2005 (Figure 13.7).

The Zhuk-ME is a monopulse array, apparently using the quadrant-split feed 
design described in Section 7.4.1. The sum and difference patterns presented in 
[6] are shown in Figure 13.8, following closely the theoretical plots for the quad-
rant-split illumination function, as shown in Figure 7.5.

13.3 
MONOPULSE HOMING SEEKERS 
The first generations of surface-to-air guided missiles, the U.S. Nike Ajax and 
Nike Hercules and the Russian SA-2 and SA-3, used command guidance, in which 
separate tracking radars (Nike) or scanning beams (SA-2, SA-3) obtained data on 
the target and the interceptor missile, which was then guided by commands com-
puted at the radar site and transmitted to the missile.  
The Nike fire control radars used the monopulse technique to achieve the ac-
curacy required for this guidance mode. The SA-2 and SA-3 radars each used a 
pair of scanning fan beams, narrow in the scanned coordinate, to track both the 
target ad the missile. The SA-10 system initially used a command-guided missile. 
In each case, the miss distance supported by the radars increased in proportion to 
the engagement range. This and the inevitable multipath errors in elevation mea-
surement limited the lethal range of the system and ruled out low-altitude en-
gagements.  
13.3.1 
Semiactive Homing 
SAM systems using homing guidance were developed to overcome the errors of 
command guidance. These initially used the semiactive mode, in which the sur-
face-based radar tracked the target and provided continuous-wave (CW) illumina-
tion whose echo was received by the seeker. The U.S. Hawk system and Russian 
SA-5 and SA-6 used this approach. In Hawk and SA-5 the radar was a CW system 
whose emission provided both the radar and the seeker with echoes on which to 
track or home. In the SA-6, the radar tracked on echoes from a pulsed transmis-
sion, and the CW illumination, at a different frequency within the same band, was 
injected into the radar antenna but not used by the radar in tracking.  
While the early seeker systems used conical scanning, these were replaced by 
monopulse seekers as soon as advances in the technology permitted. Both Hawk 
and the SA-5 used monopulse seekers. The more advanced U.S. Patriot system 
used a pulse illumination waveform, transmitted in a beam that was slaved to the 
data from the radar’s tracking mode. The seeker in this case forms the monopulse 
sum and difference signals, and these are transmitted to the radar for processing 
and development of the guidance commands. The SA-10 also includes a semiac-
tive seeker mode using illumination that is emitted but not tracked by the radar. A 
monopulse seeker is used. The SA-12 system includes two different illumination 
antennas and transmitters, separate from the radar. 
Air-to-air missiles (AAMs) using semiactive homing followed the same de-
velopment path as the SAMs, starting with conical scanning and evolving to mo-
nopulse. Data on U.S. seekers is sparse, but there have recently been several pub-
lished papers on Russian seekers. Figure 13.9(a) shows an unusual monopulse 
antenna design for a semiactive homing missile. This is, perhaps, the only current

monopulse system example of the phase-comparison antenna devised by General 
Electric Company in the 1950s (see Figure 5.5). 
13.3.2 
Active Homing 
The operational limitations of the semiactive homing technique, especially in air-
to-air applications, led to intense efforts to develop active radar seekers, many of 
which use monopulse. The first produced in quantity was the U.S. AMRAAM 
(designated AIM-120), now in extensive use. It has also migrated to a surface-
based defense system, NASAMS (Norwegian Advanced Surface to Air Missile 
System). The Patriot Advanced Capability (PAC-3) missile includes an active 
seeker and is designed to achieve direct hits on its targets. As with the semiactive 
seekers, data is sparse except for sales material originated in Russia. The two 
active seekers shown in Figure 13.9(b, c) are intended for use on the radar-guided 
version of the AA-10 (NATO name Alamo) and the AA-12 (NATO name Adder).

Monopulse has been applied in development of millimeter-wave (MMW) ac-
tive seekers for air-to-surface missile guidance. Figure 13.10 shows an experimen-
tal MMW antenna design using a 25-cm Teflon dielectric lens [7]. The beamwidth 
is 1°. A separate fan-beam horn antenna is also mounted on the test fixture. The 
block diagram of the seeker is shown in Figure 13.11. The transmitter is an impatt 
diode oscillator with 5W peak power at 100 ns pulsewidth, driven by a ramped 
pulse that generates a 250-MHz linear FM signal. The fourth monopulse channel, 
a diagonal-difference channel identified as ΔΔ in the diagram, is included to per-
mit reconstruction of the four component beams for experimental purposes.

Chapter 14 
Nontracking Radar Applications  
of Monopulse  
The discussions of monopulse throughout this book have concentrated on the ac-
curacy with which tracking radars and homing seekers can measure the angle of 
arrival of echoes from their targets. The advantages of monopulse, however, can 
be exploited in other types of radar. Some of these applications will be reviewed 
briefly in this chapter. 
14.1 
MONOPULSE 3-D SURVEILLANCE RADARS 
A surveillance radar is defined as a radar used to detect, locate, and track targets 
over a large volume of space. The tracking for this type of radar usually takes the 
form of track-while-scan, defined as [1, p. 1195]: 
An automatic target tracking process in which the radar antenna and receiver pro-
vide periodic video data from a search scan, together with interpolation measure-
ments, as inputs to computer channels that follow individual targets. 
The interpolation (or beam splitting) measurements can take the form of signal 
amplitude readings over a succession of pulses, or monopulse measurements on 
one or more pulses. The trend in modern surveillance radars has been toward ex-
ploitation of monopulse, both to improve the angle accuracy and to perform inter-
polation with those radars that use only a single pulse in each beam position. This 
type of radar is characterized as a nontracking application and discussed here be-
cause the radar beam does not respond to the presence of targets but instead fol-
lows a prescribed scan routine. The associated computer recognizes the target 
presence by associating detection reports and their coordinates, and forming track 
files corresponding to the dynamic properties of the desired target types.

Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
14.1.1 
Scanning-Beam 3-D Radars: AN/TPS-59 and AN/FPS-117 Examples 
The AN/TPS-59 3-D surveillance radar is a scanning-beam system implemented 
entirely with solid-state electronic circuits. The radar was designed by General 
Electric Company in the early 1970s to meet a Marine Corps requirement. The 
trailer-mounted antenna (Figure 14.1) is an array of 54 rows, each with 28 dipole 
elements, driven by a transmit/receive (T/R) module that contains a power ampli-
fier generating 900W peak power, along with a low-noise amplifier (LNA) for 
receiving.  
In its normal surveillance mode, the radar scans a pencil beam in elevation, 
covering eight long-range beams that extend from the horizon to 8° elevation, and 
eleven short-range beams covering from the horizon to 19° elevation. Duplicate 
coverage of the low beams is necessary because the very long pulses used for 
long-range detection cause eclipsing of targets out to 150-km range. The antenna

rotates continuously in azimuth to cover 360°, within which the elevation scans 
are separated by 2.3°, approximately 72% of the azimuth beamwidth. The long-
range beams receive a single pulse, divided into subpulses at different frequencies 
whose echoes are integrated noncoherently. Most of the short-range beams also 
receive single pulses, but the three at lowest elevation have three pulses to support 
MTI. Monopulse is applied in both azimuth and elevation, using the feed network 
shown in Figure 14.2. Each row feed network couples elements to a sum and an 
azimuth difference port. The sum port is connected through a circulator to the 
power amplifier and the LNA of the electronics module. Switches connect the 
power amplifier or LNA through the row phase shifter to either the transmitting 
column feed or the sum and elevation difference column feed. The azimuth differ-
ence port connects through a separate LNA to the azimuth column combiner. 
The elevation column combiner generates conventional sum and difference 
beams centered that can be scanned to each elevation beam position, and also a 
pair of displaced sum beams used to minimize multipath errors at low elevation 
angles. Received signals are downconverted to a 75-MHz IF before passing 
through rotary joints to the main receivers. 
The use of monopulse is necessary in scanning-beam 3-D radars such as the 
AN/TPS-59 because most of the discrete beam positions in both elevation and 
azimuth are illuminated with only a single pulse and are spaced almost a beam-
width apart. Interpolation of the angles of the detected targets is necessary to meet

the accuracy specification, which calls for azimuth to be measured to 3 mrad and 
elevation to 1.7 mrad. 
The AN/FPS-117 (Seek Igloo) radar designed for use by the U.S. Air Force, 
uses technology similar to that of the AN/TPS-59, except that the array is broader 
and uses only 44 rows of elements. These two radars are only examples of the 
many 3-D radars using the scanning-beam procedure. 
14.1.2 
Stacked-Beam 3-D Radars: Martello S-723 Example 
In contrast to the scanning-beam 3-D radar, a stacked-beam radar illuminates the 
entire elevation sector through a fan beam on each transmitted pulse. Within this 
sector, multiple receiving pencil beams are formed in parallel. Advantages of this 
procedure are that Doppler-based processing can be applied throughout the eleva-
tion sector, suppressing airborne as well as surface clutter. A disadvantage is the 
cost of multiple receivers and availability of only one-way rejection of surface 
clutter in sidelobes of the upper beams. An example of a modern, solid-state 
stacked-beam radar is the Martello S-723 (Figure 14.3).

Nontracking Radar Applications of Monopulse

The Martello S-723 array has 40 rows of 64 dipoles each, with a solid-state 
T/R module feeding each row. The combined peak power is 132 kW, at a duty 
cycle of 4%. Use of a duty cycle that is relatively low (for solid-state transmitters) 
avoids the requirement for transmitting multiple waveforms in each beam, since 
eclipsing by the transmitted pulse affects only the first 4% of the unambiguous 
range of the waveform (about 2 km in this case). The 40 row receivers, housed in 
the central spine of the antenna structure, feed a beamforming matrix that gener-
ates eight elevation beams. Monopulse processing in elevation is performed by 
comparing the amplitude of logarithmic outputs from adjacent beams on each de-
tected pulse, followed by averaging over the multiple pulses during an azimuth 
beamwidth. Azimuth interpolation within the beamwidth uses the nonmonopulse 
method common to most 2-D radars that receive pulse trains modulated during 
scan by the azimuth beamwidth. 
14.2 
MONOPULSE SECONDARY SURVEILLANCE RADARS 
A secondary surveillance radar (SSR) is one in which the return signals are ob-
tained from a beacon (transponder) carried by the target and triggered by the ra-
dar’s transmitted pulse [3]. The technology evolved from the Identify Friend or 
Foe (IFF) systems of World War II, and SSRs today are the principal source of 
data for air traffic control systems worldwide.  
A major problem in early SSRs was the presence of unwanted returns trig-
gered by and received in sidelobes of the antenna. The frequencies allocated to 
SSR are 1,030 MHz for interrogation and 1,090 MHz for response, and the an-
tenna sizes used for SSR typically generate azimuth beamwidths of several de-
grees at this frequency. The wide beams and sidelobe levels of these antennas 
would tend to trigger a large number of undesired returns, interfering with proper 
operation of the air traffic control system. As a result, modern SSR antennas gen-
erally include a monopulse-type feed networks in the azimuth coordinate. The 
difference pattern of this feed is used to transmit a control pulse that inhibits re-
sponse from transponders in the sidelobe region [4]. The principle of operation is 
similar to the sidelobe blanker used to protect radars from random-pulse interfer-
ence from emitters in the sidelobes. 
The patterns of the SSR monopulse array antenna in its transmitting mode are 
as shown in Figure 14.4. The interrogate beam (sum pattern) has the azimuth 
beamwidth determined by the wavelength and the width of the SSR antenna. The 
control beam is transmitted through the azimuth difference pattern, formed with a 
hybrid junction at the center of the antenna. This produces the type of illumination 
that was shown for a quadrant-split antenna in Figure 7.4 and the patterns shown 
in Figure 7.5. The high difference sidelobes, extending both sides of the central 
null, were an undesirable feature of that design for a tracking radar, but are useful 
in the SSR because they guarantee that the control pulse will exceed interrogation 

356 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
pulses everywhere except near the axis. Hence it may be used to discriminate 
against interrogation other than by the mainlobe of the interrogation beam.  
The transmitted pulse group consists of three pulses, of which the first and 
third (P1 and P3) are transmitted through the narrow interrogation beam. The sec-
ond pulse (P2) is transmitted through the control beam generated by the difference 
channel. The transponder compares the amplitudes of the three pulses, and re-
sponds only if P1 and P3 exceed P2 by a prescribed ratio. The process is called 
“interrogator sidelobe suppression” (ISLS or SLS). Different interrogation modes 
use difference spacing of the P1 and P3 pulses to request different forms of re-
sponse code for identification and altitude reporting. 
The availability of a monopulse difference channel in the SSR antenna per-
mits its use for reducing interference between overlapping response pulse groups 
(known as garble) and for more accurate measurement of their azimuths. The air-
craft response to an interrogation consists of a group of some 14 pulses spread 
over an interval of some 20 μs, that identify the aircraft and its barometric altime-
ter reading. In a dense traffic environment there are frequent instances of overlap-
ping responses that would defeat proper decoding by the SSR processor. The ratio 
of d/s response from aircraft at different azimuth angles provides a means of sort-
ing the response pulses by angle of arrival, and of associating each pulse in the 
 
Figure 14.4   SSR antenna interrogate and control beam patterns [3].

overlapping groups with its source. The decoded group can then be assigned an 
azimuth determined from the average of d/s from the multiple pulses. 
14.3 
OTHER RADAR APPLICATIONS 
Apart from tracking and surveillance, there have been several applications of mo-
nopulse techniques in other radar areas. Some of these are discussed below to in-
dicate the extent to which monopulse has contributed to the broad field of radar. 
14.3.1 
Terrain-Avoidance Radar 
Military aircraft may be forced to conduct low-altitude penetrations of hostile air-
space, flying below the coverage of the surveillance and tracking radars that pro-
vide data to the air defense systems. This raises the risk of flying into elevated 
terrain or obstacles rising above the terrain. The terrain-avoidance radar (usually 
one of many modes of a nose-mounted airborne radar) offers protection against 
such collisions. The radar scans a narrow azimuth sector around the aircraft head-
ing, at an elevation angle that permits mapping of the terrain ahead of the aircraft. 
At each azimuth, the elevation beam illuminates the surface, and monopulse 
measurements of depression angle to the terrain echoes are performed as a func-
tion of range (Figure 14.5). 
Data on the terrain profile in the azimuth sector about the aircraft heading are 
fed to a flight-control computer, which can then determine the risk of collision and 
adjust the pitch and yaw of the aircraft in time to maintain safe flight. This mode 
is interlaced with other radar functions, and repeated at a rate adequate to close the 
flight-control loops. 
An application of this technique to helicopter navigation is described in [4]. 
The antenna in this case was a pair of slotted waveguides mounted one above the

other, feeding two receivers and a phase-sensitive detector. Illumination for the 
experimental radar was provided by a separate antenna transmitting a CW signal.  
14.3.2 
Aircraft Low Approach Radar 
The use of a monopulse data to improve the resolution of targets on a radar dis-
play was discussed by Kirkpatrick in [5]. The same author raised the subject of 
monopulse display improvement (MDI) again [6], proposing use of airborne mo-
nopulse radar as a low-approach aid. Experimental data were gathered showing 
that ground features are useful in navigation toward a runway marked with corner 
reflectors. 
14.3.3 
Target Recognition 
An experiment performed by the Naval Research Laboratory in the 1970s showed 
the potential for improved target classification and recognition, as well as reduced 
glint error, through combined use of high range resolution and monopulse proc-
essing [7]. The range resolution of 0.5m was obtained from a 465-MHz linear FM 
waveform using the stretch processing technique [8], applied to both the sum and 
difference channels. An example is shown in Figure 14.6, where the aircraft out-

line is compared with the conventional range profile (range video) and the mo-
nopulse difference output (angle video).  
14.3.4 
Displaced Phase Center Antenna Applications 
The displaced phase center antenna (DPCA) is used in airborne moving target 
indication (AMTI) radar to remove the spreading of the clutter spectrum that re-
sults from platform motion [9, pp. 3.10–3.20]. The use of monopulse sum and 
azimuth difference patterns for DPCA and also for compensation of the angular 
scan effect is shown to provide a large improvement in clutter cancellation. The 
required antenna designs are more readily implemented than arrays in which indi-
vidual elements are switched in and out of the array to move the phase center. In 
addition, changes in platform velocity can be accommodated with a simple change 
in the weight of the difference channel that is combined with the sum channel for 
DPCA. 
More recently, the more powerful concept of space-time adaptive processing 
(STAP) has been applied to increase the clutter cancellation in airborne MTI and 
pulsed Doppler radars. Monopulse sum and difference channels provide the sig-
nals necessary for implementation of STAP technology [10], with relatively sim-
ple beamforming networks.

15.1  
DIFFERENCE AND SUM PATTERNS HAVING A RATIO  
 
PROPORTIONAL TO ANGLE 
The difference-to-sum monopulse ratio d/s is normally a nonlinear function of 
angle. It is possible, however, to generate sum and difference patterns having a 
linear characteristic—that is, a d/s ratio exactly proportional to the displacement 
of the target from the boresight axis in sine space, and therefore very nearly pro-
portional to the off-boresight angle if that angle does not exceed a few degrees. 
This property of linearity may be useful for certain applications but it requires 
some sacrifice in other desirable characteristics of the patterns. 
15.1.1  
General Properties 
The description and theory will be developed first for amplitude comparison an-
tennas in which the monopulse axis is on (or close to) the normal to the aperture. 
This category includes reflectors, lenses, and arrays that are not electronically 
steerable. Extension to electronically steerable arrays and to phase-comparison 
monopulse is covered in Section 15.1.7. The present chapter analyzes types of 
error not covered in other chapters, and presents practical formulas, analytical 
methods, and other useful information. 
Figure 6.6 in Chapter 6 showed three plots of the normalized difference d/s in 
one angular coordinate versus off-axis angle in that coordinate, for three different 
values of squint angle of (sin x)/x component beams. The usual monopulse charac-

362 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
teristic (for minimum thermal-noise error) is concave upward, like the lowest 
curve in the figure. If the squint angle is increased sufficiently, the curve becomes 
concave downward, like the top curve in the figure. At a certain critical squint 
angle the curve becomes a straight line, shown by the middle curve in the figure. 
That squint angle is the one that causes the peak of each (sinx)/x component pat-
tern to fall at the first null of the other. Strictly speaking, the d/s ratio is propor-
tional to the sine of the angle from the aperture normal rather than to the angle 
itself, but this distinction is unimportant if the monopulse axis lies in the direction 
of the normal and the beam is not more than a few degrees wide. Theoretically the 
proportionality of d/s to the sine of the angle holds true for all angles, including 
the sidelobes. 
Here we will present a simple mathematical derivation of the linear relation-
ship and will calculate the beamwidth, efficiency, sidelobe levels, and monopulse 
slope of the patterns that have this property. We will then show a linear d/s char-
acteristic can also be obtained from component patterns other than (sinx)/x. The 
existence of a class of sum-and-difference pattern pairs having a ratio proportional 
to the sine of the angle was pointed out by Rhodes [1]. He derived equations for 
the required aperture function (illumination function) of each squinted beam. Here 
we relate the results to the patterns and illumination functions of the sun and dif-
ference, which are usually of more direct interest to a designer or system analyst 
than the squinted beams. 
15.1.2  
Applications and Implementation 
A linear characteristic may be useful for certain applications even though sum and 
difference patterns having this property are not generally optimum from the 
standpoint of low sidelobes and minimum thermal-noise error. Patterns having the 
linearity property are generated more easily in an array antenna than in a reflector 
antenna because an array offers greater flexibility in shaping the illumination 
functions. For example, such patterns could be obtained from a Butler matrix [2]. 
Strict linearity is an idealized condition that would require perfect equipment, 
perfectly adjusted. It is doubtful that in practice the equipment tolerance could be 
kept small enough to maintain the linearity out into the sidelobes, especially near 
the nulls, which must be coincident in the sum and difference patterns in order for 
linearity to hold. However, it should not be difficult to obtain linearity throughout 
the main lobe. 
In the analysis and computation of monopulse system performance or errors it 
is often assumed for convenience that d/s is proportional to angle (or to the sine of 
the angle). Even when this is not actually the case, the approximation is some-
times acceptable. By using the method to be described, sum and difference pat-
terns that conform to that assumption can be modeled. Of course such models 
should not be used unless they give a reasonable fit, in the angular region of inter-
est, to the actual patterns that they are supposed to represent.

15.1.3  
Derivation of Equations 
We assume that the aperture illumination is separable in the two coordinates (as 
would be the case in a rectangular array, for example). Then the patterns in each 
coordinate can be analyzed as if they were produced by a line array. A line array 
of length L, with uniform amplitude and phase illumination, produces the follow-
ing pattern:

Note that U is a normalized measure of deviation from the axis. It is the ratio of 
sinθ to half of a “standard beamwidth” in sine space, arbitrarily defined as λ/L. If 
two such beams are formed simultaneously in squinted directions, their sum and 
difference are given by the following two equations, with a common normalizing 
factor π/4 inserted so that the sum pattern is unity when U = 0, as will be seen 
later:

which means, according to the definition of U in (15.2), that the normalized dif-
ference signal is proportional to sinθ. If the angles of interest are not greater than 
a few degrees, the difference between sind and d is negligible, and the normalized 
difference signal is almost exactly proportional to angle off axis.  
15.1.4  
Characteristics of the Patterns and Illumination Functions 
A plot of the monopulse ratio versus sinθ is a straight line, as illustrated in Figure 
15.1. The line is dotted in the vicinity of the nulls (which occur at the same angles 
in the sum and difference patterns) because although the mathematical ratio is still 
given by (15.9), the signal strength is zero or very low. Hence, any attempted 
measurement of a target in the vicinity of one of those angles would be dominated 
by noise. 
The nulls occur at U = ±3, ±5, ±7, .... The peaks of the first and second 
sidelobes of the sum pattern occur at U = 3.8 and U = 5.9, and have values of 
−23.0 dB and −30.7 dB, respectively. The peaks of the first and second sidelobes 
of the difference pattern occur at U = 3.9 and U = 5.9, and have values of −11.3 
dB and −15.3 dB, respectively. A check on these sidelobe levels is obtained by 
noting that since the peak of the first sidelobe occurs at U = 3.85 in both patterns 
and since d/s = U from (15.9), the first difference sidelobe must be higher than the 
first sum sidelobe by 20log3.85 = 11.7 dB, which agrees with the numbers above. 
The high sidelobes of the difference pattern are caused by the discontinuities 
where the illumination changes abruptly from a peak value at the ends of the array 
to zero just beyond the ends.

(15.15) 
which means that the monopulse slope is 
 
2.38 V/V/beamwidth
m
k
=
 
(15.16) 
This is considerably higher than the typical slope of about 1.6 V/V/beamwidth, 
and it might appear that the higher slope would mean higher sensitivity and there-
fore a smaller thermal-noise error. However, if the slope is expressed in absolute 
angular units, such as V/V/degree, the increase over a more typical slope is not so 
great; when expressed in V/V/beamwidth the increase appears greater than it actu-
ally is because the larger squint angle makes the sum beam wider even though 
each squinted beam maintains constant width. Furthermore, it was shown in Chap-
ter 6 that thermal-noise error is inversely proportional to a performance index 
equal to the product of difference slope (in absolute units) and sum voltage gain. 
The sum gain decreases as the squint angle increases. By entering Figure 6.3 
at the two squint angles labeled on the middle and lower curves in Figure 6.6, and 
comparing the ordinates, it is found that the linear monopulse has 4% larger ther-
mal-noise error than the minimum. Hence there is only a minor penalty in noise 
error. The main disadvantage of these particular patterns is their high sidelobes. 
15.1.5  
Computation of Patterns at Indeterminate Points  
If these patterns are used in computer modeling of system performance, the com-
putation of the sum pattern from (15.7) generally is straightforward. However, 
when U = ±1, both the numerator and the denominator are zero and the quotient is 
indeterminate. Application of l’Hospital’s rule (differentiation of numerator and 
denominator) yields the value s = π/4 at those two symmetrical points. In addition 
to the indeterminacy at the exact points U = ±1, an erroneous result may be ob-
tained if U is so close to these points that the numerator and denominator are sup-
pressed or excessively rounded off. This problem can be avoided by a first-degree

The computational procedure, then, is to use (15.21) instead of (15.7) when |U| 
differs from 1 by less than a certain increment. That increment is selected by de-
termining the point at which the particular computer begins to give erroneous re-
sults. The approximation is quite close. If (15.20) were carried out to the second 
power of U, the additional term in the parentheses would be +(ΔU/2)2. Thus if 
|U| − 1 = 0.02, for example, the error in the use of approximation (15.21) is only 
0.01%. 
15.1.6  
Other Pattern Pairs Having a Constant Monopulse Slope 
The particular pair of patterns discussed above is not the only pair having a ratio 
exactly proportional to the sine of the angle. Rhodes [1] derived an equation for a 
whole family of aperture illumination functions of squinted beams whose dif-
ference and sum have this property. That equation (number 6.4 on page 95 in 
Rhodes) is reproduced here with some of the symbols changed:

The exponent Z can have any nonnegative value, not limited to integers. The re-
quired squint angle is independent of Z; its sine equals λ/2L. 
At this point it is convenient to introduce a measure of monopulse slope, kU, 
defined by

For the pair of patterns treated earlier, Z = 0, which means uniform illumina-
tion of each squinted beam. lf Z is increased, the illumination amplitude taper be-
comes stronger, causing reduced sidelobes but also reduced efficiency, angular 
resolution, and monopulse sensitivity. To illustrate this trend, characteristics are 
compared for Z = 0 and Z = 1 in Table 15.1. The numbers were calculated with the 
aid of [3, Table A.2, p. 251]. 
The family of patterns derived by Rhodes can be extended further by super-

Thus the composite patterns also produce a constant monopulse slope.  
While Rhodes’ formulation is useful if one is interested in the illumination 
function of each squinted beam, a different approach to the problem of generating 
constant-slope patterns will now be described. This approach is more general, and 
is expressed in terms of the sum and difference illumination functions, which are 
usually of more direct interest than the illumination functions of the squinted 
beams. This method applies to phase-comparison as well as to amplitude compari-
son monopulse, and is particularly suited to array antennas.  
Let is(xn) and id(xn) be the sum and difference aperture illumination functions 
respectively, as before, and let s(U) and d(U) be the corresponding patterns. Ignor-
ing normalizing coefficients, the patterns are the Fourier transforms of the respec-
tive illumination functions. Let the sum illumination be designed to produce the 
desired sum pattern. By a well-known property of Fourier transforms, the trans-

370 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
form of the derivative of is(xn) with respect to xn is U times the transform for is(xn) 
itself. Therefore, to obtain a difference pattern proportional to U times the sum 
pattern, the difference illumination function must be designed to be proportional 
to the derivative of the sum illumination function. The sum illumination must be 
zero at the edges of the aperture, otherwise the derivative would have an impulse 
at each edge.  
In applying this method to an array antenna it is immaterial whether the mo-
nopulse is classified as amplitude-comparison or phase comparison, as long as the 
appropriate sum and difference illumination functions can be obtained The only 
difference, as explained Chapter 5, is that in amplitude comparison the d and s 
voltages have 0° (or 180°) relative phase and their illumination functions have 90° 
relative phase, while in phase comparison the reverse is true. Hence the only 
modification that may be necessary is to insert the imaginary factor j in the perti-
nent equations when there is a 90° phase relationship. 
15.1.7  
Extension to Electronically Steerable Arrays 
In electronically steerable arrays the d/s ratio can be made proportional to the dis-
placement of the target direction from the monopulse axis in sine space—that is, 
proportional to the difference between the sines of the target angle and beam axis, 
both measured from the normal to the array aperture plane. 
The analysis is the same as that of the nonsteerable patterns except that U is 
replaced everywhere by U − Ust. The quantity Ust is defined by

where θst is the beam steering angle measured from normal to the array, and U is

(15.31) 
since θ has been defined as the target angle measured from the monopulse axis. 
Equation (15.5) no longer applies, but Usq remains equal to 1 as in (15.6). In other 
words the squint is constant in sine space but not in angle space as the beam is 
steered. As before, the relations apply to each angular coordinate separately. 
Equation (15.23) is now modified to

so the ratio is proportional to the displacement of the target direction from the 
monopulse axis in sine space. The ratio can be expressed as a function of angle by 
using (15.30–15.32):

which means that the monopulse ratio is still approximately proportional to the

angle. 
15.2  
THE DIAGONAL DIFFERENCE SIGNAL 
It was shown in Section 4.4.3 and in Figures 4.15 and 4.17 that in addition to the 
sum, the traverse difference, and the elevation difference, a fourth output is avail-
able from the monopulse antenna with a four-horn feed. It is the difference be-
tween the sums of the two diagonal pairs, and is called the diagonal difference. It 
has also been called the double difference, the second difference, or the quadrupo-
lar signal. This output, which is an unused by-product of the comparator, is usu-
ally terminated in a dummy load. The corresponding output from an array antenna 
of the type illustrated in Figure 7.7 could be obtained if the differences of the col-
umn differences were combined instead of being terminated in the dummy loads 
shown in Figure 7.7(b).  
The diagonal difference signal is scarcely mentioned in the technical litera-
ture. One paper [4] suggested that it might contain useful information about the 
angular extent and aspect of a distributed target, but gave no quantitative analysis 
or specific approach. Here we examine the nature of the diagonal difference in 
order to determine whether it might be useful for the following purposes:  
1. To improve the angle estimates of a single target; 
2. To determine the angular location of unresolved targets.  
The results of this examination, although based on qualitative reasoning 
rather than on quantitative analysis, are sufficient to demonstrate that the diagonal 
difference has little or no general practical value for these purposes, although this 
conclusion does not negate the possibility of special applications for which the 
diagonal difference may be found useful. The reasoning follows along the lines of 

372 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
[5] (where it is called the quadrupolar signal). For the four-horn arrangement 
shown in Figures 4.15 and 4.17, the four outputs that can be obtained are

In these equations s is the sum voltage, dtr and del are the traverse and elevation 
difference voltages, q is the diagonal difference voltage, and A, B, C, D are the 
voltages from the four horns. The reason for the factor 1/2 was explained in Chap-
ter 4.  
Figure 15.2 is a simulated three-dimensional view of the typical shape of a 
diagonal difference pattern. One diagonal pair of lobes is positive and the other 
pair is negative. Along the traverse and elevation axes q is zero by symmetry. At 
the origin (the boresight direction) there is a saddle point. If the q signal is to be 
used, it must have its own receiver and must be divided by the sum signal to ob-
tain the ratio q/s, since an angle measurement must be independent of the signal

strength. Figure 15.3 is another way of visualizing the pattern, this time in the 
normalized form q/s. The curved lines are approximate shapes of contours of con-
stant q/s. Also shown for comparison are contours of constant dtr/s and del/s; these 
are idealized by being drawn as a rectangular grid, whereas in actuality they may 
exhibit some “barreling” or “pin-cushioning” because the traverse output is not 
completely independent of elevation and vice versa. 
In the absence of errors, the angular location of a single target is completely 
determined by measurements of dtr/s and del/s, so q/s is redundant. However, since 
there are errors in the measurements, the question is whether an overdetermined 
solution based on all three would reduce the angle error due to noise. To answer 
this, we note that at the origin the partial derivatives of q/s with respect to traverse 
and elevation are zero, since q is a constant (zero) along those axes. It is proved in 
calculus that if the partial derivative of a continuous function of two coordinates is 
zero in two orthogonal directions at a given point, it is zero in all directions at that 
point. This means that q/s has little or no sensitivity to small displacements of the 
target from the boresight direction, and therefore it is not useful for tracking a 
target close to boresight. If the target is off axis in traverse but on axis in eleva-
tion, q/s has zero sensitivity in traverse. The elevation sensitivity (the slope of q/s 
versus elevation) is nonzero in this case, but it is lower than the sensitivity of del/s.

374 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
Therefore combining the two would give negligible improvement and might even 
degrade the estimate by contributing more noise than signal. A corresponding 
argument applies if the target is on axis in traverse and off axis in elevation. Im-
provement in accuracy by overdetermination can be obtained more effectively by 
measurements of dtr/s and del/s from multiple pulses rather than just from one.  
In the case of two unresolved targets q/s is not redundant. There are six un-
knowns: two angular components for each target plus the amplitude ratio and rela-
tive phase of the pair of targets. As explained in Chapter 9, only the angles are 
usually desired, but the solutions are not separable. Measurements of the real and 
imaginary parts of dtr/s, de;/s, and q/s would provide six values related to the six 
unknowns by a known set of six equations. Thus it might appear that solutions 
could be obtained for the angular locations of the two targets. Here again, how-
ever, the poor sensitivity negates the practical usefulness. As an example, consider 
two unresolved targets, both at zero elevation but at different traverse angles. The 
value of q is zero for each target individually and for both together. Therefore the 
measurement of q/s is of no help in determining the target traverse angles in this 
example. Other examples are two targets at zero traverse but at difference eleva-
tion angles, and one target off axis in traverse only and the other in elevation only. 
Although these are special examples, they are sufficient to illustrate the generally 
poor sensitivity of q/s. 
Thus, it does not appear that there would be enough benefit (if any) from the 
use of the diagonal difference signal—at least for the purposes examined here— 
to justify the complexity and cost of providing the additional receiving channel 
and monopulse processor that it would require. 
15.3 
UNITS OF ANGLE AND SINE SPACE 
Several types of angular units and sine-space units are employed in the calibration 
of radar systems and in analysis of the data that they produce. These units are 
generally the same in monopulse and nonmonopulse systems, except that because 
of the angular precision available from monopulse, the finer units are more often 
used. Some units are well known—others are specialized and relatively 
unfamiliar. 
The most universal unit in radar applications, as in other fields, is the degree, 
(1/360 of a circle). However, the minute (1/60 of a degree) and the second (1/60 of 
a minute) are uncommon in radar usage. Instead, fractions of a degree are usually 
expressed in decimal form. This, one-eighth of a degree is written as 0.125° rather 
than 7′30′′. 
The radian is defined as the angle subtended at the center of a circle by an arc 
equal in length to the radius. The radian itself is not used as a practical unit of 
angular measurement in radar (see milliradian below). 

 
Special Topics 
375 
The milliradian, which is 1/1,000 of a radian, is widely used in monopulse 
radar, especially for small angles of the order of fractions of a degree. The number 
of milliradians in a circle is 2,000π or about 6,283. In the International System of 
Units [6, 7] the standard abbreviation for radian is rad; when combined with the 
abbreviation for the prefix milli-, it becomes mrad, which is therefore the pre-
scribed abbreviation for milliradian. The abbreviation mr is often seen, but it is 
nonstandard. The abbreviation mil is also sometimes seen and often heard; besides 
being nonstandard, it could be confused with the artillery mil, defined in the next 
paragraph. Nevertheless, mil is a popular oral abbreviation, because mrad and mr 
are unpronounceable.  
The artillery mil is a convenient “rounded” version of the milliradian, used at 
some U.S. test ranges. By definition, there are exactly 6,400 (rather than approxi-
mately 6,283) artillery mils in a circle. Since the difference is less than 2%, the 
artillery mil and the milliradian may be used interchangeably for approximate 
values of small angles; in general, however, they should be carefully distin-
guished.  
The grad is 1/100 of a right angle or 1/400 of a circle. This unit is not used 
for radar measurements, but may be encountered in some geographic applications 
in European countries. One grad of latitude is a distance of 100 km (to a close 
approximation) on the Earth’s surface.  
A more recently introduced unit is the millisine [8, p. 172]. This is a unit of 
measurement in sine space (see Sections 2.8, 7.2, and 7.3) rather than angle space, 
and is particularly suited to planar array antennas. The number of millisines in an 
angle measured from a specified reference direction is 1,000 times the sine of the 
angle. For example, 30° corresponds to 500 millisines. The number of millisines 
in the angular interval between two lines at angles θ1 and θ2 from a common ref-
erence direction is 1,000(sinθ2 − sinθ1), not 1,000sin(θ2 − θ1). In planar arrays the 
reference direction is usually understood to be broadside (perpendicular to the 
array face). The term millisine is nonstandard and cannot be interpreted as “a 
thousandth of a sine,” as the name would suggest, but it has the merit of conven-
ience in specifying and analyzing performance of an electronically steered array. 
When beamwidth, angular resolution, and angular precision of an array antenna 
are expressed in conventional angular units, they are functions of the beam steer-
ing angle. When expressed in millisines referenced to broadside, these quantities 
are nearly independent of beam steering direction and therefore can be specified 
more compactly. For directions close to the reference direction, the number of 
millisines is approximately equal to the number of milliradians. The equivalent 
term millicosine is also sometimes used, the only difference being in the point of 
view: millicosine refers to the cosines of angles measured from the rectangular 
coordinate axes of the array (angles α and β), while millisine refers to sines of the 
complementary angles measured from the principal planes through the broadside 
direction (angles α′ and β′).

15.4  
COMPARISON WITH RHODES’ TERMINOLOGY AND  
 
CLASSIFICATION 
In the book Introduction to Monopulse [1], published in 1959, D. R. Rhodes pro-
posed a classification scheme for the various types of monopulse, and showed that 
they are related by a unifying set of theoretical principles. Those principles are 
still valid, and they provide valuable insight into the theoretical foundations of 
monopulse. 
However, because of the advancement and diversification of monopulse func-
tions, applications, and designs since 1959, it was felt necessary in the present 
volume to modify and expand Rhodes’ classification system and to emphasize the 
individual practical characteristics of the various types of monopulse in addition 
to pointing out their common theoretical foundations. Some of Rhodes’ mathe-
matical terminology has been replaced by engineering terminology more directly 
identified with the functions and physical components of the monopulse system. A 
number of topics not covered in Rhodes’ small volume, or mentioned there only 
briefly, have been introduced or expanded. Some of the conciseness of Rhodes’ 
mathematics has been sacrificed in the present volume in favor of fuller step-by-
step derivations. 
For the benefit of readers of this book who have studied Rhodes’ book in the 
past or who may refer to it in the future, this section gives a brief comparison of 
the two classification systems and “translations” of some of the terminology. 
Rhodes’ classification of a monopulse radar rests mainly on two criteria: the 
type of “angle sensing” and the type of “angle detection.” Interposed between 
these two principal functions there may be an intermediate one called “ratio con-
version.” 
Angle sensing is of two types: amplitude sensing and phase sensing. These 
depend on the nature of the antenna patterns, and they correspond to the ampli-
tude-comparison and phase-comparison classes defined in Chapter 5 of this book. 
Rhodes’ definitions are worded and illustrated only for reflector or lens antennas, 
but they can be extended to electronically steered array antennas in the same man-
ner as is done in Chapters 5 and 7 of this book. 
Much of Rhodes’ theoretical development is expressed in terms of the pat-
terns and illumination functions of the individual component beams1—that is, the 
squinted beams with a common phase center or the parallel beams with displaced 
phase centers—while in the present book the main emphasis is on the sum (or 
reference) and difference patterns. This is merely a matter of viewpoint, since only 
a simple transformation (mathematical or physical) is needed to convert compo-
nent beams to their sum and difference or vice versa. In practice, however, it is 
usually the sum and difference patterns that are of direct interest to the designer 
                                                 
1  The term “component beams” is not used in Rhodes. It is used here in the sense defined in Section 
2.3. 

 
Special Topics 
377 
and user; they have physical reality in the sense of being measurable and produc-
ing the voltages that are acted upon by the receivers.  
The pair of component beam patterns is characterized by an “angle-sensing 
ratio,” complex in general, which Rhodes denotes by the symbol r(u), where u is 
defined as π(d/s)sinθ and d is the aperture dimension. In the portion of the radar 
containing the passive components the ratio exists only mathematically. It does 
not appear physically until a later stage.  
If the ratio conversion function is present, it converts the pair of voltages 
from the component patterns into a different pair having a different ratio, which 
still exists only mathematically. For example, the output voltages of the pair of 
component beams may be converted to their sum and difference, or amplitude 
sensing may be converted to phase sensing or vice versa. The conversions de-
scribed by Rhodes are accomplished by hybrid junctions or other passive devices. 
In the terminology of the present book, the device that forms the sum and differ-
ence (or the sum and two differences for two coordinate monopulse) is called the 
comparator (Section 4.4.3), and conversion from amplitude sensing (amplitude-
comparison class) to phase sensing (phase-comparison class) or vice versa by 
means of a 3-dB directional coupler is called “apparent” conversion (Section 5.7) 
because the classification is regarded here as an inherent property of the antenna 
patterns, regardless of subsequent conversions. In Rhodes’ terminology, the ratio 
of the two squinted patterns (in amplitude sensing) or of the two parallel patterns 
(in phase sensing) is a “multiplicative” ratio, denoted by rm, and the ratio of the 
difference to the sum is an “additive” ratio, denoted by ra. A multiplicative ratio is 
unity on axis and has reciprocal values at equal positive and negative angles. In 
amplitude sensing, the multiplicative ratio is the ratio of two amplitudes (with 
sign), since the phases are equal. In phase sensing, the amplitudes are equal and 
the ratio is exp(jφ), where φ is the phase difference between the two component 
voltages. An additive ratio is zero on axis and has odd symmetry as a function of 
angle. 
The types of circuits that Rhodes calls angle detectors correspond generally to 
what are called monopulse processors in Chapter 8 of this book. These circuits, 
which contain active components, act on the pair of voltages whose ratio is rm or 
ra (after ratio conversion, if any) and produce an “angle output,” which is a func-
tion of that ratio and can be calibrated with respect to angle. 
Rhodes sets up three classes of angle detectors, designated by Roman numer-
als I, II, and III. Class I is used when the sum and difference voltages are available 
as inputs. The class I circuit example that Rhodes gives in the first part of his Fig-
ure 3.8 and in his Figure 3.9 is the same as the dot-product detector described in 
Sections 8.8 and 8.9 of this book. Other examples in this book that would also fall 
in Rhodes’ class I (although their implementation is different from his example) 
are given in Sections 8.4–8.7. 
Rhodes’ class II angle detector operates on input voltages having the same 
phase but different amplitudes. His example in Figure 3.8 uses logarithmic ampli-

378 
Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
fier-detectors and takes the difference of their outputs as the angle output. This is 
the same as the processor described in Section 8.12 of this book. 
His class III angle detector operates on voltages having the same amplitude 
but different phases. It consists basically of a phase detector. The processor de-
scribed in Section 8.13 of this book can be considered a member of that class. 
Thus Rhodes’ six forms of monopulse are designated as classes IA, IIA, IIIA, 
and IP, IIP, and IIIP, where the letters A and P denote amplitude and phase sens-
ing. For example, class IIIA would mean that the antenna patterns are of the am-
plitude-sensing (amplitude-comparison) type, but the pattern outputs have been 
converted (by a ratio converted such as a 3-dB coupler) to a pair of voltages hav-
ing equal amplitude but different phases; these voltages are then operated on by a 
class II angle detector. Examples that are more typical would be IA or IP, since in 
most cases the beam outputs, whether from an amplitude-comparison or phase-
comparison antenna, are converted to their sum and difference, which are then 
operated on by any of several forms of monopulse processor. 
Not all modern monopulse systems fit neatly into Rhodes’ classes, particu-
larly with regard to the angle detector (monopulse processor). In fact, some of 
them are not true monopulse according to his definition because they do not sat-
isfy all of his theoretical postulates (he calls such systems “pseudomonopulse”2). 
In the present book the definition of monopulse is broadened to include virtually 
any system that uses simultaneous receiving beams to determine angle of arrival. 
Furthermore, Rhodes’ classes are too broad to distinguish among the various tech-
niques of implementing the same function (since that was not his intention). For 
these reasons, in Chapter 8 of this book the monopulse processors have been de-
scribed individually without reference to Rhodes’ classification.

About the Authors 
Samuel M. Sherman received a Ph.D. in engi-
neering physics from the University of Penn-
sylvania. As a captain in the U.S. Army, he 
served as a Radar Design and Development 
Officer in World War II. After the war he was 
a research associate at University of Pennsyl-
vania. He then served as a superintendent of 
the Control Equipment Division at the Naval 
Air Development Center in Warminster, Penn-
sylvania. 
His major contributions in monopulse ra-
dar were at RCA where he was the head of 
systems engineering and a senior staff scien-
tist. During the early years of his work at 
RCA, he was a colleague of David K. Barton.  
After retirement from RCA, he was the 
author of the first edition of Monopulse Prin-
ciples and Techniques in 1984. He was a radar consultant and a lecturer in The 
George Washington University Continuing Engineering Education Program. He 
published many journal articles and was awarded several patents.  
 
Dr. Sherman worked during the second half of 2010 on this second edition of 
his book, continuing to provide revised material and review new material through 
February 2011. He marked his last corrections on February 25, 2011, from the 
hospital where he passed away on February 28, 2011, at age 96. This book thus 
represents the last of his many contributions to the art and science of radar.

Monopulse Principles and Techniques 
 
David K. Barton is a radar system consultant, 
with a home and office in Hanover, New 
Hampshire. He attended Harvard College 
from 1944 to 1949, with a two-year interrup-
tion for service in the U.S. Army at White 
Sands Proving Grounds. He returned to White 
Sands as a civilian engineer after receiving his 
A.B. in physics in 1949. In 1953 Mr. Barton 
transferred to the Signal Corps Laboratories at 
Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, to initiate de-
velopment of the AN/FPS-16, the first mo-
nopulse instrumentation radar. In 1955 he 
joined the staff at RCA, where the radar de-
velopment was carried out, and participated in 
the test and evaluation of the system. For this 
work RCA awarded him in 1958 the first 
David W. Sarnoff Medal for Outstanding Achievement in Engineering. Mr. Bar-
ton also scaled up that radar to create in 1960 the AN/FPS-49 radars for the Bal-
listic Missile Early Warning System, only recently replaced after 40 years of op-
eration in Alaska and Great Britain. 
From 1963 to 1984 he was a consulting scientist with Raytheon Company in 
Wayland and Bedford, Massachusetts, where he originated the radar concepts for 
the AN/TPS-19 radar-controlled landing system for the U.S. Air Force, and con-
tributed to a number of other radar and guided missile studies and projects. He 
joined ANRO Engineering in 1984, engaging in radar and missile system studies 
until his retirement in 2004.  
Mr. Barton was elected a Fellow of the IEEE in 1972 and to the National 
Academy of Engineering in 1997. In 2002 he received the IEEE Dennis J. Picard 
Medal for Radar Technologies and Applications. He has served on the scientific 
advisory boards of the U.S. Air Force, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and the 
Army Research Laboratories. Since 1975 he has been the editor of the Artech 
House Radar Series, of which this book is approximately the 160th volume.
