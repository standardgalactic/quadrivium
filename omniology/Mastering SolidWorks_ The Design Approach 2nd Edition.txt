 Features of  Mastering SolidWorks®: 
The Design Approach 
Tutorial 4–6:  Create Features 
 This tutorial covers the creation of these features: chamfer, fillet, slot, shell, draft, and 
rib. All dimensions are inches. Here are useful observations: 
  
1.  Make sure to pay attention to the visual clues shown in the left pane while creating 
these features.  
  2.  For example, the box symbol under  Chamfer parameters indicates that you can 
chamfer a face, an edge, or a vertex (corner point). As expected, chamfering a face 
chamfers all its edges. Chamfering a corner chamfers the three edges that meet 
there.  
  3.  A rib requires a profile sketch (e.g., a line or stepwise line) and a thickness.

  Preface 
 The target audience for this book is college students in 
courses that use SolidWorks to learn and master CAD/
CAM for design, visualization, prototyping, and manu-
facturing. The book’s primary market is four-year col-
leges and two-year community colleges. Freshman 
Engineering Design courses should find this book use-
ful, refreshing, and interesting. Other important mar-
kets include high schools, professionals, and training 
courses. We have written the book with the target au-
dience in mind. Page iii highlights some of the book’s 
features. 
 The book includes just the right amount of math in 
 Chapter   8 (Curves),  Chapter   9 (Surfaces), and  Chapter 
 13 (Analysis Tools). The math is concentrated in one 
or two sections in each of these three chapters. We 
include the math for two reasons. First, it shows stu-
dents who are curious how CAD/CAM systems work 
“under the hood.” Second, it broadens the book’s 
appeal to many students, professors, and readers. This 
math may be ignored without affecting the continuity 
of the coverage of the material in any of these three 
chapters. 
 The philosophy behind the book is original, 
unique, and effective. We cover and present Solid-
Works as a design system rather than a software pro-
gram. Thus, instead of focusing on describing 
SolidWorks menus and syntax, we describe design 
approaches, methodologies, and techniques to help 
CAD designers/engineers and draftspersons achieve 
their engineering tasks in the fastest, easiest, and most 
effective way. 
 Based on this philosophy, the book approach uses 
design, modeling, and drafting concepts as the build-
ing blocks, instead of menus and commands. Thus, we 
present command sequences to achieve CAD and 
 modeling tasks. Of course, we provide SolidWorks 
syntax and details, but do so in keeping with the pro-
posed philosophy of the book. We start with a CAD 
task to accomplish (what to do) and then go about 
accomplishing it (showing how to use SolidWorks to 
do it). This philosophy is more motivating to student 
learning than simply going through layers of menus 
and commands. 
 The book approach is designed to bring the real 
power of SolidWorks as a powerful modeling and 
design system instead of only a software program. We 
include challenging modeling and design examples 
and problems in the book. As part of the book’s unique 
approach, we cover the theoretical concepts behind the 
various functions of SolidWorks. This should provide 
information to curious minds about why things work 
the way they do, as well as explain their limitations and 
use. 
 The book provides plenty of illustrations, step-by-
step instructions, and rich and challenging end-of-
chapter problems. The book is suitable for use at 
various levels, from freshman to senior to graduate 
courses. Instructors can choose the chapters and topics 
that suit their teaching needs and courses. They can 
also choose the level of depth. The book includes both 
examples and tutorials. An example covers one con-
cept whereas a tutorial is more comprehensive by cov-
ering a full design task. Each example and tutorial has 
a hands-on exercise at the end that serves two pur-
poses. First, it ensures that the student has gone 
through the example or tutorial, because it builds on it. 
Second, it both challenges the student’s understanding 
and extends it. 
 The book is organized into parts and chapters. 
Instructors may cover the chapters in any order and 

v
Preface
select as they see fit their course and student needs. 
However, we recommend covering  Chapters   1  and   2 
first to build a sound background in 3D CAD/CAM 
modeling concepts.  Chapter   1 is designed to provide a 
quick grasp of basic functionalities: create parts, create 
assemblies, and create drawings. These three function-
alities correspond to the three modes of SolidWorks: 
part, assembly, and drawing. The idea here is that stu-
dents can start designing basic and simple products 
after using only one chapter of the book; they do not 
have to wait until later chapters to learn how to design 
and document simple parts and assemblies. Then they 
can dig deeper in the later chapters to learn more. 
Thus,  Chapter   1  provides breadth and the remainder 
of the book provides depth. As for why we need  Chap-
ter   2 , it covers all the essential concepts required for a 
sound understanding of the 3D modeling concepts and 
efficient use of today’s parametric features-based solid 
modeling CAD/CAM systems such as SolidWorks. 
 I would like to thank many people who contrib-
uted to this book including my students, the book 
reviewers, the Prentice Hall team, the editorial team, 
and my family. Many of my students have shaped how 
I should present and teach concepts to help them 
understand better. They have also contributed directly 
and indirectly to the book. This book is the outcome of 
their influence. 
 I would also like to thank Boston Gear for granting 
permission to download and use some of their gears in 
the book tutorials. I thank Jake Hustad for providing 
the Universal Joint assembly. I also thank Ivette Rod-
riguez of ASME for granting permission to use ASME 
Y14.5M-1994 (R2004) material.

for its technical support throughout the writing proc-
ess and using SolidWorks. My sincere thanks go to my 
friends Marie Planchard, Christian Blanc, and Chris-
tine Morse.

 Computer Aided 
Design (CAD) Basics  
 The primary goal of  Part   I  is to learn how to use SolidWorks fairly quickly to create 
parts, assemble them, document them, and visualize them. The core use of SolidWorks 
in industry is to create CAD parts (SolidWorks Part mode), assemble the parts to create 
products (SolidWorks Assembly mode), and create drawings of the parts and assemblies 
for production and manufacturing (SolidWorks Drawing mode).  
 Chapter   1 (Getting Started) is an overview of SolidWorks, its philosophy, how to 
configure it, and how to administer it.  Chapter   2  (Modeling Management) is about 
learning the 3D CAD modeling concepts to enable the completion of design tasks in the 
shortest time possible.  Chapter   3  (Design Intent) covers both how to embed design 
intelligence into CAD design and how the way you create a CAD part influences its 
future edits and manufacturing.  
 Now that we are ready to start, note that this book advocates an active learning style. 
This means you learn as you use SolidWorks to do the book tutorials. Each chapter in 
the book covers the basic concepts of the chapter subject independent of the Solid-
Works syntax (subject semantics), followed by tutorials that show detailed instructions 
of SolidWorks syntax (subject syntax) to use the concepts to accomplish design tasks. 
This approach should maximize the value of learning, as the reader can relate syntax to 
semantics.

 Getting Started  
 1.1  Introduction 
 As the preface indicates, this book is written with a focus on achieving CAD design and 
modeling, and CAM modeling and manufacturing tasks instead of on SolidWorks, its 
menu/tree structure, and syntax. Of course, we do explain SolidWorks in detail and 
show how to use it to accomplish these tasks. In other words, we cover SolidWorks as a 
powerful design and manufacturing system, rather than a software program. This 
approach makes the reader engaged and eager to learn SolidWorks.  
 This book does not require  prior knowledge of SolidWorks or the CAD and CAM 
subject matters  .  Contrary to its name, the book takes a student with no background in 
CAD and CAM modeling and gradually and systematically builds their background to 
an advanced and mastery level, thus the name of the book.  If you do have prior knowledge 
of CAD and CAM, you will still benefit from the unique presentation of the material and 
solidify your prior knowledge. 
 Another benefit of using this book, in addition to learning and mastering CAD and 
CAM from scratch, is the ability to pass the SolidWorks CSWA (Certified SolidWorks 
Associate) and CSWP (Certified SolidWorks Professional) certification exams and 
become a SolidWorks certified CAD designer. As a matter of fact, the book prepares you 
far beyond what the CSWA and CSWP exams require. Refer to  Appendix   B  for more 
details on SolidWorks exams. 
 This book is written with one goal in mind: to help you become a better CAD 
designer by (1) understanding the intricacy of three-dimensional (3D) modeling and (2) 
learning SolidWorks. By understanding 3D modeling concepts, you become more effi-
cient, perform CAD tasks quicker, and eliminate the time-consuming and frustrating 
trial-and-error approach. By learning SolidWorks, you gain the skills required by com-
mercial CAD/CAM systems. These skills are transferable from one CAD/CAM system to 
another because all the systems are built on the same theory and concepts. Even though 
the syntax (user interface) of these systems is different, their semantics (concepts) are 
the same.  
 The book uses  the tutorial approach for learning, supported by explaining the con-
cepts behind the tutorials. We cover the concepts  of each chapter  independent of Solid-
Works and use the majority of the chapter to cover tutorials related to the concepts. We 
follow a meaningful numbering system for the tutorials and examples. Tutorials are 
numbered  as Tutorial x–y  , where x is the  chapter number and y is the  tutorial number 
within the chapter  .  For example,  Tutorials  1–2 and  Tutorial   1–3  are, respectively, Tuto-
rial 2 and Tutorial 3 in  Chapter   1 . 
 In addition to using tutorials, the  book uses examples also, numbered in the same 
way as the tutorials. Unlike a tutorial, which uses multiple concepts to achieve a design

 1.2  Engineering Design Process 
 Unlike science, in which the goal is to understand physical phenomena, engineering is 
all about making products that work even though it involves doing elaborate, complex 
theoretical investigations. There are good reasons for that. Engineered products and 
systems are too complex to fit closed-form solutions. Thus, engineers and designers 
resort to computational methods and techniques, and design tools (such as CAD) to 
achieve their part and product design. Designers typically begin with a rough part design 
of the problem to solve and then continue to refine and test it until the part design meets 
all the design requirements. 
 The well-known  engineering design process (EDP) reflects this very nature of engi-
neering design.  Figure   1.1  shows the steps of the EDP. The input to EDP is an idea or a 
problem to solve. The output is a design to implement the idea or solve the problem.

 1.3  CAD Process 
 The CAD process is a subprocess of the EDP. We use it to implement Steps 5 through 8 
of the EDP shown in  Figure   1.1  . The CAD process is carried out on a CAD/CAM system. 
In a general sense, use the CAD software to create 3D models of the part design, conduct 
analysis on the models, redesign the part, if needed, and document the final design. 
 Figure  1.2 shows the CAD process.   
task, an example focuses on only one concept and is always used in its respective section 
that introduces that concept.

Chapter 1: Getting Started
 1.4  Manufacturing Process 
 With the design complete, we manufacture it to produce the part or product (a product 
is an assembly of individual parts or components). The input to the manufacturing proc-
ess is a design, and the output is the actual part or product that the design represents. 
 Figure   1.3  shows the manufacturing process. It picks up where the design process left off:

engineering drawings. A manufacturing engineer (known as a  process planner ) inspects 
the engineering drawings (Step 1 in  Figure   1.3 ) for manufacturing purposes to ensure 
that all dimensions make sense, are not contradictory, and that all specified tolerances 
are producible in a cost-effective way. In Step 2, the manufacturing engineer creates the 
process plan to produce the part. This plan includes and coordinates all the details of 
production that the factory (shop floor) supervisors, foremen, and workers need to make 
the parts and the products. The output from the process plan includes lists of NC pro-
grams, production machines, tools, materials, routing sheets (that specify manufacturing 
sequences), cost estimate sheets, time estimates, and production floor schedule.   The 
other manufacturing steps in  Figure   1.3  are self-explanatory, and we all can relate to 
them.   
 1.5  CAM Process 
 The  computer aided manufacturing  (CAM) process is a subprocess of the manufactur-
ing process. Like the CAD process, the CAM process is carried out on a CAD/CAM 
system. In a general sense, use the CAM software to create process plans, NC pro-
grams, and part inspection. Other manufacturing software exists, but it may not be 
part of the CAM software of a typical CAD/CAM system.  Figure   1.4  shows the CAM 
process.

 1.6  SolidWorks Installation and Resources 
 While the  book  is written for SolidWorks 2014, it should work with other versions 
(e.g., 2012, 2013, or 2015). SolidWorks version affects, if at all, only the tutorials, not 
the concepts. Unless you are running a 32-bit version of the Windows operating system 
(OS), you should install the 64-bit version of SolidWorks. Click the following sequence 
to find the Windows version you are running: Right click  My Computer or  Computer 
(varies depending on the system) >  Properties. If you do not see “x64 Edition” or “64-bit 
Operating System” under the  System section, you are running the 32-bit version. If 

Chapter 1: Getting Started
7
you install SolidWorks on your personal computer, you should make sure that the 
computer has enough memory (RAM), enough hard disk space, and the proper graph-
ics (video) card for display. Check the SolidWorks website ( www.solidworks.com/sw/
support/SystemRequirements.html ) for these requirements. Starting with SolidWorks 
2015, SolidWorks will not install on a 32-bit operating system anymore. When you 
install SolidWorks, it creates shortcuts on your desktop. The ones we are interested in 
are SolidWorks (starts the program) and eDrawings (starts eDrawings). 
 SolidWorks is a native Windows application, meaning it does not run under other 
OSs such as Macintosh. If you need to run SolidWorks on a Mac, you must run Win-
dows OS on the Mac computer. You have two options: Use BootCamp to partition your 
computer (for dual boot) to install Windows OS on one partition, or run virtualization 
software (e.g., Parallels or VMWare) that allows you to run a virtual machine (VM) copy 
of Windows from within the Mac OS. The latter option is not good because of the speed 
reduction of running SolidWorks, but it allows you to run Mac OS at the same time. 
BootCamp does not allow running both OSs at the same time. 
 SolidWorks comes with many resources to help you get started, troubleshoot, and 
learn. The  Help * menu of SolidWorks is excellent and provides a wealth of information. 
To access this menu, click  Help  on the menu bar after you start SolidWorks. Other 
resources are available on SolidWorks website,  www.solidworks.com . Visit the website 
frequently to find the latest news. Also, visit  https://forum.solidworks.com  to find 
answers to your questions. If you are interested in SolidWorks certifications, visit  www.
solidworks.com/cswa .  
 SolidWorks has useful software that is free. The two products of interest to us are 
eDrawings and SolidWorks Viewer. The eDrawings is an e-mail tool that allows you to 
communicate SolidWorks designs to anyone without them having to install SolidWorks 
software. It also allows you to mark up drawings you have been sent and then send 
them back. The SolidWorks Viewer allows you to view part and assembly files without 
having to install SolidWorks. It also allows you to pan (move), zoom in/out, and rotate 
the parts and assembly models for better visualization. Download both eDrawings and 
SolidWorks Viewer software from  www.solidworks.com/sw/support/downloads.htm  
(once there, click FREE CAD TOOLS tab). Other useful SolidWorks resources for edu-
cators and students are listed here. 
 * Names of SolidWorks menus, menu items, tabs, toolbars, windows, and keyboard keys are shown in bold 
with first letter in cap. Sketch names, features names, and file names are shown in italic.

first to add the focus there. The main window has three panes (areas), as shown in  Fig-
ure   1.5  . Familiarize yourself with the window and the panes. Although most of the 
information in  Figure   1.5  is self-explanatory, the status bar at the bottom of the window 
displays messages related to your current activity. Make a habit of watching this bar.  
 SolidWorks offers multiple modes, depending on what you would like to do. The 
three basic modes are Part (create parts or components), Assembly (create assem-
blies), and Drawing (create drawings). Other modes include Simulation, Animation, 
Analysis, and Machining. SolidWorks displays the commands for each mode when 
you activate it. 
 One important goal of using a CAD system is to be efficient and quick in achiev-
ing design tasks. We offer the following general tips for the basic repetitive 
SolidWorks tasks:     
 Task 
 Instructions or Command sequence to click to achieve task 
 Creation steps 
 We use the verbose approach to describe a SolidWorks procedure or skill the first time we use 
it. After that we use a shorter version. 
 Using examples and tutorials 
 We encourage you to use  the book  with SolidWorks software open at the same time, so you 
can follow the sequence of commands and also explore more on your own. 
 Mouse buttons 
 Use the left button for selections as you always do. Use the right button to open a context 
(selection) menu. 
 Click means click the left mouse button. If we need a mouse right click, we will write so 
explicitly. We use  select  and  click  interchangeably. 
 Mouse wheel 
 Rotate the wheel to zoom in and out of part. 
 Press and hold it and drag (move) the mouse to rotate the part on screen. 
 Multiple entity selection 
 Click the left mouse button to select the first entity, then press and hold the  Ctrl key on 
keyboard to select other entities, or select by window. Press and hold the mouse left button 
and drag (move) the mouse to define window. Any entities fully enclosed by the window are

 Features tree 
 SolidWorks calls it  FeatureManager Design Tree . We call it features tree for simplicity. It is 
shown in the left pane of SolidWorks window as shown in  Figure   1.5 . This tree is also known as 
the part history tree. It stores a sequential record of the part creation steps. It has nodes; each 
node represents a feature. Read the nodes from the top down. If you expand a node (click its 
“+” sign), you see the sketches and operations needed to create the feature. 
 Also, you can drag the bottom blue line of the tree (called rollback bar) upward to roll it back 
to hide features displayed temporarily in the graphics/display window. This is useful to trace 
back (reverse engineer), investigate, and debug part creation.

 Deleting a feature 
 To delete a feature, right click its node in the features tree >  Delete . Deleting a feature does 
not delete its sketch. Conversely, you cannot delete a sketch before deleting its feature. 
SolidWorks would not allow it. 
 Deleting sketch entities 
 To delete one entity (e.g., a line), select it with the left mouse button and hit the  Delete key on 
the keyboard. To delete multiple entities, select them by pressing the left mouse button and 
dragging the mouse to highlight the entities, then hit the  Delete key. If entities are scattered, 
press the  Ctrl key on the keyboard and select the entities, one by one, using the left mouse 
button, then hit the  Delete key. 
 Handle multiple open windows of 
SolidWorks 
 If any of these open windows does not stay up when you hover over it, it means that an edit 
feature operation is open in one of the windows. Locate that window and close the edit 
operation. 
 Display sketch entities 
 Sometimes a sketch becomes hidden after deleting a feature. If this happens click  View >  Hide 
All Types . This is a toggle (on/off). Or, click sketch node in features tree > Show (eyeglasses 
symbol) from context toolbar that pops up. 
 Control font size of dimensions in 
a drawing 
 If font size for dimensions in drawing views is too small or too big: 
 Tools >  Options >  Document Properties tab >  Dimensions (click it; do not expand) > 
 Font >  Points > Select size >  OK >  OK 
 Geometric relation symbols 
 While sketching entities in a sketch, the mouse cursor may show a symbol to indicate one of 
the relations shown in  Figure   1.6 . 
 Rendering and viewing parts 
 You have different options to render the part as shown in  Figure   1.7 A. Hover over any 
rendering icon to read it. 
 You can also view the part in different views while modeling.  Figure   1.7 B shows SolidWorks 
Heads-up View toolbar. Hover over any view icon to read it. Also, click the  Zoom to Area 
icon, select an area of the part by pressing and dragging the mouse left button to enlarge it to 
inspect overlapping entities, and check other modeling details. This is useful in debugging 
modeling errors. Once finished, click the  Zoom to Fit icon to fit the entire part back to the 
graphics/display screen. 
 You can also split the modeling screen to view different views of the part as shown in

 1.8  Customize SolidWorks 
 SolidWorks can be customized in many ways, but the basic customization needs are 
available when you click  Tools > Options to  access a window with two tabs : Sys-
tem Options  and  Document Properties . Customizing at the system level (using 
 System Options) affects current and future documents (i.e., global effect). Cus-
tomizing at the document level (using  Document Properties ) affects the current 
document only (i.e., local effect). Familiarize yourself with the choices available for 
each option. 
 Another, but related, customization way is to open a new blank part. Then, use 
the  Document Properties  tab to customize annotations, dimensions, part units, and 
so on. After you are done, save the part file as  master.sldprt for future use. When you 
want to create a new part (CAD model), open  master.sldprt , create a new design and 
save it under a new name. Repeat for future parts. 
 A third way to customize is to change the part, assembly, and drawing file tem-
plates of SolidWorks itself, instead of using the  master.sldprt idea. SolidWorks comes 
with template files with the names  Part.prtdot ,  Assembly.asmdot , and  Drawing.drwdot . 
If you open any of these files and customize them using the  System Options or 
Document Properties  tab and save them, the changes apply to future usages. For 
example, if you change the units from IPS to MMGS in the  Part.prtdot file, each time 
you open a new part, it uses these units. To edit any template click this sequence: 
 File  >  Open >  Template (*.prtdot, *.asmdot, *.drw.dot) under  Quick Filter  > 
Select the file template you like to edit >  Open >  Tools >  Options > Use the  System 
Options or  Document Properties tab to customize as needed >  OK >  File >  Save .

 1.9  Modeling Plan 
 Quite often, CAD users (designers) tend to rush to create CAD models (parts) without 
some critical thinking and strategizing about the best modeling plan to create the mod-
els. (We use the terms  model and  part interchangeably in  the book  ; the two words are 
synonymous.) We measure “best” by multiple factors: 
  
1.  Fastest time to create the part  
  
2.  Most efficient way to edit the part after creation  
  
3.  How the part will be manufactured  
 Generally speaking, the two common modeling approaches are the cross-section or 
the features approach. The cross-section approach is generally faster than the features 
approach, but may be inefficient in editing parts later on. Within each approach, some 
modeling plans are more efficient than others. To help grasp the importance of a modeling 
approach and a modeling plan within the approach, think of traveling from point A to 
point B and ask yourself: What is the best and fastest way to get from point A to point B? 
 Consider the chamfered block with a hole shown in  Figure   1.9  to discuss these con-
cepts further.  Figure  1.9  A shows the cross-section modeling plan to create this part. It 
is easy, consisting of two steps: Create the cross section sketch, and extrude it to create 
the part.  Figure   1.9  B shows the features modeling plan. It has three steps, creating a 
feature in each step: Create the block, create the chamfer, and create the hole. The order 
of creating the chamfer or the hole is irrelevant.    
 FIGURE 1.9 
 Modeling plan of a chamfered block 
 •  Part and its modeling plan (shown by 
features tree)

 Block from its default name ( Boss-
Extrude1 ) for ease of tree read. 
 •  The  Block node is shown in its 
expanded form. Click the “-” to 
collapse it. 
 
 Step 1:  Create  Sketch1 of  Block cross section.  
 
 Step 2: Create  Block feature: Extrude  Sketch1  
2.0 inches.  
 (A) Cross-section modeling plan

Chapter 1: Getting Started
 Which is a more efficient plan to create this part? That is the heart of the debate. 
Considering the part creation only, the cross-section plan is generally faster. The fea-
tures plan is always more modular and mimics the manufacturing steps in the machine 
shop. The machinist starts with block stock, mills out the chamfer, and drills the hole. 
 This debate is always settled based on heuristics in practice and personal prefer-
ences. Some CAD designers, especially those who have manufacturing background, 
prefer the features modeling approach. In general the cross-section approach is faster 
than the features approach. We use both approaches  in this book  depending on the 
modeling task at hand. In this chapter, though, we use only the features approach for 
learning purposes by creating features repetitively.  
 1.10  Part Creation 
 After deciding on a modeling plan of a part, you execute the plan on a CAD/CAM system 
to create the CAD part. A CAD part is made up of features that are combined in the order 
of creating them. A CAD/CAM system stores this order in a features tree that it creates. 
 
 
 
 
 •  Part modeling plan is shown in the features tree. 
 •  Create three features in the order shown. 
 •  We renamed the features nodes in tree as shown.  
 Step 1: Create  Sketch1 and  Block 
feature: Sketch the 3 in. × 3.5 in. 
rectangle on  Front Plane sketch plane 
and extrude 2 in.  
 Step 3: Create  Sketch3 
and  Hole feature: Sketch 
circle with diameter = 1.0 
in. on  Block front face and 
extrude cut 2 in.  
 Step 2: Create  Sketch2 and  Chamfer 
feature: Use  Chamfer feature on  Fea-
tures tab. Use 1.5 in. for chamfer 
distance.

Each time you create a new feature, the system adds or subtracts it from the features that 
are already created. Therefore, at any one time you have only one combinatory feature 
representing the CAD part.  Figure   1.9  B shows three features that make up the part. The 
tree shows that the user created the  Block (originally named  Boss-Extrude1  by Solid-
Works), followed by creating the  Chamfer ( Cut-Extrude1 ), followed by creating the  Hole 
feature ( Cut-Extrude2 ). 
 A  feature is a 3-dimensional (3D) CAD part such as a block, cylinder, hole, and so 
on. The two basic features are extrusion and revolve. An  extrusion is a prismatic feature 
that has a constant cross section and a uniform thickness perpendicular to the cross sec-
tion plane. The  Block shown in  Figure  1.9  B is an extrusion. A  revolve is an axisymmetric 
feature that also has a constant cross section and an axis of revolution to revolve the 
cross section around. 
 The creation of a feature begins with a 2D sketch to draw its cross section. You draw 
the geometry of the cross section (sketch) on a sketch plane. A  sketch plane is a prede-
fined plane that you select or a plane that you create . Each of the three steps of  Figure 
 1.9 B shows the sketch of each feature. After creating the sketch, you use it to create the 
feature. SolidWorks provides a  Sketch tab and a  Features tab as shown to the far left of 
 Figure   1.5 . You can start creating a feature using either tab. If you start with the  Sketch 
tab, you would need to select a feature from the  Features tab after finishing and exiting 
the sketch because SolidWorks would not know which feature you want to create using 
the sketch. If you start with the  Features tab, you select the feature you want to create. 
SolidWorks automatically activates the  Sketch tab because the next logical step is to 
create the feature sketch. After you are done with the sketch, SolidWorks goes back to 
the features mode and lets us finish the feature creation. Either way to create a feature is 
fine. We prefer the  Features tab, as we feel it is more efficient.  Thus, we start with the 
 Features tab in this book.  
 1.11  Examples 
 This chapter covers examples and tutorials of the basic tasks of SolidWorks: creating 
parts, assemblies, and drawings in a quick fashion for those readers who prefer to do it 
all quickly.  More in-depth coverage of these design activities is provided throughout the 
book. The examples cover creating basic simple parts, assemblies, and drawings. The 
tutorials cover more involved parts.

 Example 1.4   Create engineering drawings (see  Figure  1.13 ) of the parts created in  Examples  1.1 – 1.3 . 
 Solution     We create three engineering drawings of the three parts. We insert the three typical views (front, 
top, and right) into each drawing and dimension each view. We also insert an isometric view in each drawing. In 
practice, some companies use the ISO view; others do not. 
 There is a two-way associativity between parts and their drawings. Changing a part is reflected in its drawing 
views automatically, and, vice versa, changing the part (model) items in a drawing is reflected automatically in 
the part. 
 Open SolidWorks in the Drawing mode to create a drawing: Click  Open >  New >  Drawing >  OK >  OK (accept 
the default  Standard sheet size ). SolidWorks drawings use the concept of sheets. You can create multiple sheets 
within a drawing. We use only one sheet per drawing. Once the drawing is open, SolidWorks offers three methods 
to dimension a drawing: individual, auto, and model items. The first two methods are available under the  Smart 
Dimension icon in the  Annotation tab. When you click the  Smart Dimension  icon, two tabs show in the left pane 
on the screen:  DimExpert and  Autodimension . Use  DimExpert to insert individual dimensions, and use  Autodi-
mension to dimension an entire view at once. 
 The model items method is available as the  Model Items icon in the  Annotation tab. We prefer using this 
method because it preserves the model-drawing associativity concept. SoildWorks displays the layout of the sketch 
dimensions in a drawing view. For example, if you have created the sketch in the  Front Plane , the sketch becomes 
the front view and will be dimensioned the same way you dimensioned the sketch.

 Step 1:  Create the drawing and views:  File >  New > 
 Drawing >  OK >  OK (accept the default  Standard 
sheet size )  > Browse ( locate and select the  Pin part) > 
click the mouse near the bottom left corner of the 
drawing sheet to insert the front view > move the 
mouse up and click to place the top view > move the 
mouse near the bottom right corner and click to place 
the right view > move the mouse near the top right 
corner and click to place the ISO view > click the

 (A) Plate drawing  
 Note: Each view has a bounding box (hover near the 
view until you see it). You can drag any edge of the 
box to adjust the view placement in the drawing sheet. 
SolidWorks maintains the orthogonality between the 
three views (front, top, and right). If you move one of 
them, the other follows accordingly. 
 Note: Click this sequence to change angle of projec-
tion if you get the wrong views: Right click anywhere 
on the drawing sheet >  Properties >  Third angle from 
window that pops up >  OK 
 SolidWorks requires an active part to feed into the drawing you are creating. You may open the part be-
fore or after you open a new drawing. With this quick overview of drawings, we create three drawings for the 
three parts as shown in Figure 1.13.

Chapter 1: Getting Started
 Step 2:  Create dimensions, notes and save drawing: 
To insert dimensions click  Annotation tab shown to 
the right  > Model Items > ✔. To insert a note like the 
one shown in  Figure  1.13 A, click  Annotation tab > 
 Note > click in drawing sheet to place note > type note 
text >  Esc >  Esc 
Save the drawing as  pinDrawing:  File > Save As > 
 pinDrawing >  Save 
 Note: Repeat Steps 1 and 2 to create drawings of 
other parts. 
 Note: SolidWorks opens the  Model Items pane to 
the left of the screen when you click  Model Items 
icon. Investigate its offerings to learn more. 
 Note: If needed, drag dimensions or notes to reposi-
tion them relative to views.   
 Example 1.5   Create the assembly model (see  Figure  1.14 ) of the parts created in  Examples   1.1 – 1.3 . Also, 
create an assembly drawing, an animated exploded view, and a rendered view of the assembly. 
 Solution     You create an assembly by inserting the individual parts (components) of the assembly into the as-
sembly model. (We use the terms  part and  component interchangeably.) The first part you insert is considered the 
base part onto which other parts are assembled. To open SolidWorks in the Assembly mode, click  File > New > 
Assembly > OK . When you insert a part into the assembly model, SolidWorks actually makes a copy of the part 
and inserts it. This copy is known as an  instance . Thus, you can insert as many instances of a part as the assembly 
needs. 
 After you insert the parts, you assemble them to create the assembly. Assembling a part in an assembly entails 
applying mating conditions (mates) to constrain it in the assembly. A mate positions and orients two components 
relative to one another. Conceptually, the mates resemble assembling parts of a product in real life. A mate ap-
plies to two entities of the parts being mated, be it a face, edge, point, axis, origin, sketch plane, or plane. For 
example, a mate may require two faces to be coincident, two cylindrical faces to be concentric, or two planes to 
be parallel. 
 The outcome of mating two parts is to prevent them from moving relative to each other in space, thus mimick-
ing real life. An assembled part must be fixed (anchored) in space unless it is free to move for functional require-
ments; for example, a motor shaft must rotate. In general, a component needs three mates to lock it in 3D space. 
There is a total of six degrees of freedom (DOF) in the assembly modeling space: three translations along the three 
axes ( X ,  Y , and  Z ) and three rotations around these axes. Three mates are what it takes to constrain the six DOF 
because locking one locks another. 
 There is a two-way associativity between parts and their assemblies. Changing a part model is reflected in all 
its instances automatically, and vice versa, changing the instance in an assembly is reflected automatically in the 
part model.

are sufficient to create the assembly. The pin still has 
the rotational degree of freedom free. Drag the pin 
with the mouse left button to spin it (although you 
cannot visually see the pin rotates). Try to drag any of 
the other two parts to move or spin them; you cannot. 
They are fully constrained in space. 
 Step 3:  Create exploded view: We start with the 
assembly collapsed state ( Figure  1.14 A) and create the 
exploded view state ( Figure  1.14 B). Click  Exploded 
 
 
These axes show when you se-
lect  pin . As shown to the right, 
drag  pin up and away.

animate it. The animation opens  Animation control-
ler window. Close it to stop animation.  
 
  
 Step 4:  Create assembly drawing: Follow steps of 
 Example  1.4  . Show only the overall dimensions in 
assembly drawings as shown in  Figure   1.14  C. 
 Step 5:  Render the assembly model: We assign 
material to each part, then render: Right click  pin > 
 Material >  Edit Material >  Aluminium Alloys > 
 6061 Alloy >  Apply >  Close. Repeat and assign  plate 
and  basePlate same material. 
 Render the assembly:  Office Products tab >  Pho-
toView 360 (to open  Render Tools tab) >  Render 
Tools tab >  Integrated Render 
 Note: Unlike  Integrated Render ,  Final Render icon 
on Render Tools tab opens its own window.

1.  Reverse engineering is a good first step to learn good design methodologies. 
Similarly, reverse CAD modeling is a good first step to learn good CAD modeling 
techniques. Search 3DcontentCentral ( www.3dcontentcentral.com ) or  grabcad.com , 
find a CAD model of one simple part of interest to you, download its SolidWorks 
files, open them in SolidWorks, and study its features tree (roll back the tree to follow 
model creation). After understanding how the model is created, analyze the modeling 
steps and evaluate how effective is the modeling plan. Can you find other modeling 
plans that are quite different? If yes, do you think they are more or less efficient?  
  
2.  Same as Problem 1, but for a more complex part.  
  
3.  Same as Problem 1, but for a simple assembly model. For this problem, reverse 
engineer the mates of the assembly and analyze them.  
  
4.  Same as Problem 3, but for a complex assembly.  
  
5.  SolidWorks allows you to reorder the nodes of a features tree by dragging a node 
up or down the tree and dropping it before or after another node. SolidWorks 
allows you to shuffle the tree nodes as long as you do not violate the model 
topology (i.e., you cannot create an extruded cut if you do not have an extruded 
boss/base, or material, to cut from). Follow  Tutorial   1.1  and create the flap part. 
Try to reorder the features tree nodes by moving them around. Which nodes can 
you move around and which can you not? Explain why or why not.  
  
6.  Same as Problem 5 above, but for  Tutorial   1.3  , pillow block part.  
  
7.  The flap part of  Tutorial   1.1  is symmetric with respect to the right sketch plane, 
passing through its midsection. Re-create the CAD model by constructing half of 
the flap, then mirror it with respect to the right plane. Hint: Study how we used 
the mirror feature in  Tutorial   1.3  , pillow block part.  
  
8.  Editing existing CAD models offers a quick, powerful way of changing a design 
during the conceptual design phase (Step 3 of EDP shown in  Figure   1.1  ) to 
explore different design ideas. Create the CAD model of the plate part of  Example 
 1.1 . Then edit it and make it round (i.e., convert the square plate into a cylindrical 
part of diameter 3.0 inches). You must edit the tree node of the part to convert the 
part by editing its sketch.  Figure   1.24  shows the modified part.

 Modeling Management   
 2.1  Overview 
 We covered part modeling planning and creation in  Sections  1.9 and   1.10  respec-
tively in  Chapter   1 . We extend these concepts in  Chapter   2 and cover them in more 
depth.  CAD modeling requires forward thinking and planning ahead. The way the 
CAD model (part) is created affects its downstream activities such as using  Model 
Items in dimensioning the views of a drawing. The goal of this chapter is to cover 
the many concepts necessary to understand and control 3D CAD part modeling 
and creation.  
 2.2  Types of CAD Models 
 CAD models can be classified into four types from a creation point of view: 
 ■  Extrusion:     This is a part with a constant cross section along a given axis, with a 
uniform thickness along this axis.  
 ■  Revolve:    This is an axisymmetric part with a constant cross section through an 
angle of revolution about a given axis of revolution.  
 ■  Composite:     This is a part that combines both extrusions and/or revolves. One or 
more of its subparts may be extrusions or revolves. 
 ■  Free form:    This is a part that does not exhibit any uniform shape. An auto body or 
a computer mouse is an example. Modeling of this class of parts requires surfaces 
and other techniques  as we discuss later in the book . 
 Figure   2.1 shows the different types of CAD models. The extrusions and revolves 
require one sketch in one sketching plane to sketch the cross section. For example, 
 Figure   2.1A  extrusion requires the top sketch plane to sketch the cross section, fol-
lowed by extruding it up or down in the perpendicular direction. For the  Figure 
 2.1B extrusion, we create the cross section in the front sketch plane. For the revolve 
of  Figure   2.1C , we create the glass cross section and the axis of revolution in the 
front sketch plane. The phone model shown in  Figure   2.1D  is a composite part. It 
consists of two extrusions (the base and the receiver holder). The two cylinders can 
be created as additional extrusions. Finally, we can add the phone buttons as a pat-
tern. The two models shown in  Figures  2.1E  and   2.1F are free-form, requiring more 
than one sketch in different sketch planes. We use advanced operations such as lofts 
to create them.

 TABLE 2.1    Planning Part Creation on a CAD/CAM System 
 Part Clue 
 How to Use in Part Creation in a CAD System 
 Part type 
 • Extrusion: create a sketch and extrude it. 
 • Revolve: create a sketch and revolve it. 
 • Composite: use a combination of extrusions and/or revolves. 
 • Free form: use lofts, sweeps, surfaces, etc. 
 Part symmetry 
 • Split the part into two halves at the symmetry plane. 
 • Construct one half and mirror it about the symmetry plane to finish the creation of the CAD model. 
 Part patterns 
 If they exist (e.g., holes in a flange or phone buttons), use CAD patterns to create them. 
 Designated points 
 Make use of end-, mid-, and/or intersection points of entities during creation to avoid unnecessary calcu-
lations. SolidWorks snaps to these points when you move the mouse close to them; or hover the mouse 
over them during construction. 
 Sketch relations 
 They include horizontal, vertical, and perpendicular. You must be in an active sketch to view them. You 
must also activate them:  View  (menu) >  Sketch Relations . This sequence is a toggle. Do it once to 
show relation symbols on sketch; do it again to turn them off. 
 Equations 
 An example is  D 1 = 2 D 2 .

 Always build features off center (i.e., use mid planes). When you extrude a sketch, extrude it on both 
sides of the sketch plane. This strategy is good for mirror; use the sketch plane to mirror. 
 Miscellaneous 
 • If you do not have dimensions, sketch freely. 
 • Trim entities to clean up creation and avoid calculations. 
 • Use transformations (move, rotate, copy, scale, offset) to speed up creation.

 2.3  Planning Part Creation 
 Planning the creation of a part usually comes with experience; the more you know about 
what a CAD/CAM system can do, the faster and more efficiently you can create models. 
When it comes to planning part creation on a CAD system, the best approach is to exam-
ine the part for geometric clues that may lead you to the easiest and fastest steps to create 
the CAD model.  Table   2.1  shows some of these clues.  
 Example 2.1   What is the best modeling plan to use to create the CAD model shown in  Figure  2.2 ? Why? 
 Solution     The key modeling concept here is how to create the four holes in the block so that they are always 
equally placed from the four corners of the front face of the block, as shown in  Figure   2.2 ; that is, the holes are al-
ways equally placed diagonally from the center of the front face. Such placement should hold even after you change 
the size of the block (dimensions 1.25 and 1.00) or the spacing (dimensions 0.80 and 0.40) between the holes. 
 We have two modeling plans to choose from: cross section or features. We use the cross section here.  Figure 
 2.2 shows the modeling plan, which has two steps: create the block cross section, and then create the block feature.

 2.4  Part Topology 
 The CAD models (parts) we create using CAD/CAM systems are solid models. A  solid 
model is a geometric model of a part and represents the most complete definition of the 
part.  Figure   2.3 shows the solid model of a block. A solid model is also known as a body 
(B). Topologically, a solid model consists of faces (F), edges (E), vertices (V), loops (L), 
and genus (G). A  face is a surface and may be planar or nonplanar. An  edge is a curve 
that may be a line. A  vertex is a point (corner). Faces meet (intersect) at edges and edges 
meet (intersect) at vertices. A  loop is a set of contiguous edges in a face. A loop is viewed 
as a hole in a face. For example, the front face shown in  Figure   2.3  has four loops. A 
 genus is a through hole in a solid. A genus is viewed as a 3D hole. For example, the solid 
model shown in  Figure   2.3  has four genus.

 FIGURE 2.3 
 Topology of a block  
 The above model description is known as the model topology. The topology of a 
valid (correct) solid model must satisfy the Euler equation given by: 
 
F  E  V  L  2(B  G) 
(2.1)  
 The solid model shown in  Figure   2.3  has the following topology:  F  6,  E  12, 
 V  8,  L  8,  B  1, and  G  4. This topology satisfies  Eq.   (2.1)  . Therefore the model 
is a valid model. Obviously, CAD/CAM systems create only valid solid models.  
 2.5  Parametric Modeling 
 CAD modeling is based on the concept of parametric modeling (parametrics). CAD/
CAM systems use parameters to define the model, instead of specific explicit dimen-
sions. When we assign values to the parameters of a model, these values define the 
specific size of the model and become the model dimensions that a CAD system uses to 
generate the model drawings. You may change the values of the parameters later, and 
the CAD system will update the model to reflect the modifications. 
 The great virtue of parametric modeling is ease of editing.  Figure   2.4  shows the dif-
ference between parameters and dimensions for a simple rectangle sketch. A  parameter 
is a variable that can assume any value. A  dimension is a specific numerical value for a 
parameter. Parametric modeling offers three benefits. First, you sketch freely in a sketch 

Chapter 2: Modeling Management
45
plane. As you sketch, the CAD system creates parameters and assigns them values 
(dimensions). When done sketching, you may edit the dimensions as needed. You can 
display the names of the parameters and edit their names. The CAD system stores and 
manages the parameters and their values. Second, as  Figure   2.4  shows, parametric mod-
eling provides the ability to create a family of parts in which all the parts have identical 
shapes (topology) with different dimensions. Third, you can create relations between 
parameters to control the geometry of the sketch. These relations add design intent or 
intelligence to the model design. 
 The concept of parametric modeling is liberating during conceptual design; it gives 
you, the designer, incredible flexibility and power. All you need to do is sketch the 
model without worrying about dimensions. After you are done sketching, you assign 
dimensions to the sketch entities. If you do not like the way the sketch looks, you 
change the dimensions. Thus, we can start sketching and modeling without a need for 
dimensions, or with just minimal dimensions up front. You can actually use the sketch 
to define the appropriate values for the missing dimensions.   
 Example 2.2   Use parametric modeling.  Figure  2.5 shows a sketch. 
  1.  Create the sketch in SolidWorks.  
  2.  Modify the dimensions of the sketch. 
  3.  Change the dimension names.  
 Solution     This example illustrates showing and editing dimension names.  Figure   2.5  shows the default and the 
edited dimension names.

 2.6  Customizing SolidWorks 
 SolidWorks allows you to customize just about anything in its main window. Click 
 Tools > Customize  to open the SolidWorks  Customize window shown in  Figure   2.6  . 
We encourage you to explore the many options and tabs of the window. In addition, the 
 FIGURE 2.6 
 Customize window (click  Tools >  Customize to open)

last menu item on each menu is  Customize Menu . When you click this item, the items 
of the menu you are in appear again, this time with the ability to turn them on/off. Now, 
turn on/off any menu items. When done, click anywhere on the screen to exit. Now, 
click on the menu again to see the results of the changes you just made.   
 2.7  Productivity Tools 
 We define a productivity tool as an operation or function that speeds accomplishing 
your design and other tasks in SolidWorks. These tools are diverse and include custom-
izing SolidWorks, hotkeys, programmable mouse, templates, layers, visualization, mac-
ros, family of parts, and libraries. The  hotkeys are the key strokes that correspond to 
commands. For example, like Word,  Ctrl+S saves the document and  Ctrl+P prints the 
document. You see these hotkeys next to the commands of any menu. As you learn the 
commands, you learn the hotkeys. A  programmable mouse  is a mouse with multiple 
buttons where a CAD designer may program each button to do a CAD task. A button 
may perform one command or a sequence of commands. Clicking a mouse button may 
be faster for some people than using the hotkeys on a keyboard, or clicking items from 
menus or icons on toolbars.  
 2.8  Coordinate Systems 
 CAD/CAM systems use two coordinate systems to make part modeling easy and conven-
ient for CAD designers. The first system is the model coordinate system (MCS). The 
 MCS is the reference system that the CAD/CAM system uses to store the model geom-
etry in the part file. The MCS is defined by the CAD/CAM system, and its location and 
orientation in space cannot be changed by the user. A CAD/CAM system uses its MCS 
to define its default (predefined) sketch planes (top, front, and right) and its default 
(predefined) views (top, front, right, and others). The MCS is an orthogonal coordinate 
system defined by three orthogonal planes that intersect at the system axes:  X ,  Y , and  Z . 
An MCS assumes one of two orientations in a CAD/CAM system. In one, the XY plane 
of the MCS defines the horizontal plane (top sketch plane) and the top view; in the 
other, the XY plane defines the vertical plane (front sketch plane) and the front view. 
SolidWorks uses the latter orientation for its MCS, as shown in  Figure   2.7A  . 
 The second system is the working coordinate system (WCS). The  WCS is a coordi-
nate system that facilitates model creation. It is a user-defined system. The user may 
define a WCS anytime during modeling. However, only one WCS is active at any one 
time. The sketch plane is the XY plane of the current WCS. As the user sketches on the 
sketch plane, the CAD/CAM system keeps track of the transformation back and forth 
between the WCS and MCS coordinates. It converts the WCS coordinates into MCS 
coordinates and stores them in the part file. The WCS is related to the MCS via the loca-
tion of its origin and its orientation, as shown in  Figure   2.7A  . Note that the origins of the 
MCS and WCS shown in  Figure   2.7A  are actually coincident and are located at the ori-
gin of the WCS. We use the shown MCS for illustrative purposes only. The CAD/CAM 
system displays the  X - and  Y -axes of the WCS only. The  Z -axis is perpendicular to the 
XY plane with a positive direction defined by the right-hand rule. In terms of the day-
to-day jargon of CAD/CAM systems, we hardly use the word  WCS . We always use sketch 
planes instead. The default WCS of a CAD/CAM system has the same orientation and 
location as its MCS. In the case of SolidWorks, the default WCS is the one that uses the 
front sketch plane shown in  Figure   2.7B  .

Chapter 2: Modeling Management
 2.9  Sketch Planes 
 Sketch planes control the part creation in the CAD/CAM 3D modeling space. You always 
begin by selecting a sketch plane to create the cross section (sketch) of the feature you 
wish to create. The sketch is the basis of 3D modeling. If you need multiple sketch

planes to create a 3D model, you select one at a time, create the sketch, and finish the 
feature before selecting another sketch plane to create another feature. The three default 
sketch planes are  Front Plane, Top Plane , and  Right Plane  (see  Figure   2.7B ). If you 
need a sketch plane in a different orientation, you must create it. You can also select any 
face of any feature as a sketch plane. Simply click the face and open it as a sketch to 
begin sketching. 
 When you sketch, you want the sketch plane to be perpendicular to the line of sight; 
that is, the sketch plane aligns with the screen of your computer monitor to enable you 
to see the sketch entities you create. This would require you to align the view with the 
sketch plane. For example, if you want to sketch on the front sketch plane, select  Front 
Plane from the features tree > click the  Normal To icon (hover until you read it) from 
the context toolbar that pops up, shown in  Figure  2.8A  . Alternatively, you can select the 
front view from the Heads-up View toolbar as shown in  Figure   2.8B  .  
 (B) Select view from the screen.  
 FIGURE 2.8 
 Orient sketch plane with model viewing 
 (A) Select  Normal To from the context menu.  
 A sketch plane could be an imaginary plane, like the ones SolidWorks provides 
(Front, Top, or Right), or it could be an actual face of a feature. In either case, select and 
orient it to begin sketching on it. If a feature’s face is not directly accessible to select it, 
change the view orientation or rotate the model until you can select the face. 
 The very first sketch plane that you use to create a feature determines the model 
orientation in the 3D modeling space. This, in turn, affects the views of the model that 
you create in engineering drawings. You need to align the orientation, in the 3D mode-
ling space, of the 3D model of a part with the physical or perceived orientation of the 
actual part. You simply use the corresponding sketch plane to create the cross section of 
the part; that is, you use the front sketch plane to create the part front cross section, the 
top sketch plane to create the top cross section, and so on. If you use the front sketch 
plane to create the top cross section, you effectively have rotated the model 90 degrees 
in the 3D modeling space. Thus, the top view of the physical part becomes the front 
view of the model.  Figure   2.9  shows an example.   
 There are ways to get around misorientation of the model in the 3D modeling space 
due to starting with the incorrect sketch plane. One (inefficient) way is to delete the 
model and re-create it using the correct sketch plane. A better way is to reorient the 

50

model in the space as follows and shown in  Figure   2.10  . Click the sketch in the features 
tree ( Figure   2.10A  ) > select  Edit Sketch Plane  from the context menu that pops up ( Fig-
ure   2.10A ) > expand the features tree (click the “+” symbol shown in  Figure   2.10B  ) > 
select the plane you want such as  Top Plane ( Figure   2.10C  ) > ✔. The model view on the 
screen confirms the sketch plane reorientation. Drawing views also confirm the results.

 2.10  Sketch Status 
 A  sketch status  is defined as the geometric state of a sketch. After you create a 
sketch, you may add dimensions to its parameters before you create the feature that 
uses the sketch. The sketch status assumes one of three states. A  fully defined sketch 
means the sketch is dimensioned and constrained correctly. This is the ideal status. 
An  under defined sketch lacks necessary dimensions and/or geometric constraints. 
An  over defined  sketch has more dimensions/constraints than what it needs. Solid-
Works allows you to create a feature using an under or over defined sketch. You 
should not create a feature without a fully defined sketch, although you could. 

Chapter 2: Modeling Management
51
 SolidWorks uses color and text to convey the sketch status to the designer. It also 
displays a symbol in the features tree next to the sketch name if the sketch is under (−) or 
over (+) defined as shown in  Figure   2.11B  and  Figure   2.11C  respectively. For the over 
defined sketch, SolidWorks also displays a yellow triangle ( Figure  2.11C ) next to the (+) 
symbol. If all sketch entities are displayed in black on the screen, the sketch is fully defined 
and no symbol appears next to its name in the features tree as shown in Figure 2.11A. 
Entities that are under defined are displayed in blue. Yellow areas show where the sketch 
is over defined. In the case of  Figure  2.11B , the blue entities (right and top lines of the 
rectangle) are under defined because they are not dimensioned. In the case of  Fig-
ure   2.11C , the bottom and top horizontal lines are displayed in yellow, indicating that one 
of their dimensions must be removed because it is driven by the other (i.e., redundant).

 2.11  Part Features Tree 
 A part features tree (SolidWorks calls it  FeatureManager Design Tree ) is an important 
modeling tool. The tree is an uprooted tree. The top node (root) is the part (CAD model) 
under which the other nodes come. Each node has leaves, which are the sketches. The 
tree shows the steps (history) of creating the part. You can step through the tree to 
reverse engineer the part design by rolling back the tree. 
 If you right-click any tree node, you can perform useful functions. Click any feature 
to display its dimensions. View the parent/child relationships by right-clicking a feature 
>  Parent/Child from the pop-up. You can delete a sketch or feature by right-clicking its 
node in the tree >  Delete from the pop-up. Deleting a feature does not delete its sketch. 
Conversely, you cannot delete a sketch unless you delete its feature first. Investigate the 
many possibilities of using the features tree when you need them. Here are some more 
thoughts on how to use the tree ( Figure   2.12  ): 
  1.  Expand or collapse nodes to have access to or to hide sketches of features. A node 
that is collapsible has a “+” (collapsed state) or “–” (expanded state) symbol, as shown 
in  Figure  2.12 . Click a node symbol to toggle its state.  
  2.  Rename a node (Figure 2.12A) for ease of following the part creation steps.  
  3.  Rearrange nodes (Figure 2.12B): drag a node and move it up or down the tree in 
case you ever want to change the order of the creation steps. You can do that as long as 
you do not violate the part topology.  
  4.  Roll back the tree. Drag the bottom blue line (rollback bar) of the tree up to hide 
features or down to show them again. Place the mouse over the rollback bar (hand 

52
Chapter 2: Modeling Management
shown in  Figure  2.12  A) and drag it up or down. When you roll back the tree, you 
hide the features from the bottom of the tree up to the rollback position. This is 
beneficial because it allows you to insert features at any location in the tree. When 
done with the insertion, drag the rollback bar all the way down the tree.  
  5.  Suppress a node (Figure 2.12C): you can hide (suppress) a feature (node) without 
having to delete it and re-create it. This could be useful in design studies. Unlike 
rolling back a tree, suppressing a node enables you to hide a node selectively without 
having to hide all the tree nodes that follow underneath it. Suppressed nodes are 
displayed gray in the features tree. To suppress a node: click it in the tree >  Suppress 
from the context toolbar (hover over until you read it). To unsuppress it, click it again 
>  Unsuppress from the context toolbar.    
 2.12  Construction Geometry 
 When you create a sketch, you may need auxiliary geometry to assist in creating the 
sketch entities. Such geometry is known as  construction geometry. Any entity you sketch 
can become construction geometry if you check off the  For construction box (option) 
during sketching as shown in  Example   2.1 . Select the option after you create the entity. 
If you check the option again (uncheck the box), the entity reverts back to a sketch entity. 
When you sketch a line, you have the option to create a centerline under the line icon on 
the  Sketch tab; alternatively, you can sketch a line and then check off its box. If required, 
you can edit a sketch and convert any of its entities to  For construction by selecting first. 
 Points and centerlines are always construction entities. Construction geometry uses 
the same line style as centerlines. Examples of using construction geometry include an 
axis of revolution to create a revolve feature, a circular axis to place holes (circular pat-
tern) in a flange, and so on.  Example   2.1  shows a construction rectangle to place the 
four holes of the block.   
 2.13  Reference Geometry 
 Reference geometry, as construction geometry, is part of a feature definition, but not 
part of the feature geometry. Whereas construction geometry belongs to sketch creation, 
reference geometry belongs to feature creation. As such, construction geometry (e.g., 
centerline) is available on the  Sketch tab, whereas reference geometry is available on the 
 Features tab under the  Reference Geometry  drop down shown in  Figure   2.13  . The 
figure shows the reference geometry that you can create and use.  Plane and  Point are 
the most commonly used reference geometry.  We already used a plane in Tutorial 1.3.  
Reference points are useful to use to create a curve.

 Solution     The goal of this example is to show how to create inclined sketch plans and use them in modeling. 
The part has five features: block, cylinder, slot, cylinder fillet, and slot fillet. To create a plane at an angle from a 
given face, you need to identify an edge on the face to measure the angle from. Also, when you click a plane node 
in the features tree, you can use the eyeglasses symbol from the context toolbar that pops up (and shown in Step 
3 below) to hide/show the plane. It is a toggle.

Why? How can you solve the problem? 
 2.14  Sketch Entities 
 The SolidWorks  Sketch  tab provides all the entities you can use to create parts. 
 Figure   2.15  shows the entities. Hover over any entity or click a drop down list to 
investigate further. Most of the entities are self-explanatory. We just offer a few 
remarks. The  Ellipse  menu has a  Parabola  entity that you can use to create 
parabolas. Use the  Spline menu to create any shaped curve. A  spline curve is 
defined as a general-shaped curve that provides freehand sketching ability. To 
create a spline, click the  Spline icon, and then click on the screen at multiple 
locations. When done, hit  Esc on the keyboard. Use the  Text icon (shown as A 
in  Figure   2.15 ) to create text on faces, curves, edges, and sketch entities. This 
text is treated as modeling entities and can be, for example, extruded. It is unlike 
text you create in drawings.   
 FIGURE 2.15 
 Sketch entities  

Chapter 2: Modeling Management
55
 2.15  Sketch Relations 
 A sketch  relation is a geometric constraint (condition) between two sketch entities such 
as lines or arcs. You can add relations while creating the entities or after. If you want to 
add relations after creating entities, you must edit them. These relations include hori-
zontal, vertical, perpendicular, coincident, midpoint (of a line), and so on. As you 
sketch, SolidWorks guides you by showing a symbol for the most logical relation you 
can use (see Figure 1.6). If you hover over a relation symbol after sketching, SolidWorks 
displays its name. You can turn on/off the display of relation symbols in a sketch by 
clicking:  View >  Sketch Relations . It is a toggle. 
 2.16  Equations and Link Values 
 An  equation is a mathematical relationship between sketch entities, feature dimen-
sions, or other model properties. Parameters form the basis for creating equations. 
An equation could relate two or more parameters. For example, we can write an 
equation to relate the two parameters  P1 and  P2 (e.g.,  P1  2 P2 ). For an equation to 
evaluate correctly, the values for all the parameters on the right side of the equation 
must be known ( P2 in this case).  P1 is the evaluated parameter.  P1 is also known as 
the dependent or driven parameter, and  P2 is the independent or driving parameter 
(dimension). Note that you cannot edit driven parameters to change their values 
because they are controlled by their equations. You can only change the values of the 
driving parameters. 
 Link values work in a similar, but simpler way as compared to equations. They 
allow us to link two parameters together to have the same value, effectively creating an 
equality equation (e.g.,  D1   D2 ). Changing the value of one parameter changes the 
other. In link values, we can change either parameter. Unlike equations, there is no 
driver or driven parameter. Note that we cannot link parameters that are defined by 
equations to prevent conflicts. You link parameters by assigning them a shared name 
(e.g., length). Right click any dimension >  Link values  > enter shared name >  OK . To 
unlink a parameter, right click it >  Unlink Value . 
 Example 2.4   Use equations and link values to control modeling. This example builds on  Example   2.2  . 
We create the sketch in a different way by using equations. We need to control the rectangle shape so 
that the value of  D1 is always twice that of  D2 and the hole center is always coincident with the rectangle 
center. Create the equations to implement these relations. Prove that the equations work by changing the 
dimensions. 
 Solution     The coincidence of the hole and the rectangle centers can be forced by dimensioning the hole center 
( x hole ,  y hole ) from the rectangle’s two edges. The equations we need can be written as follows: 
 D1  2D2
xhole  0.5D1
yhole  0.5D2 
  Figure   2.16  shows the equation editor.  x hole and  y hole coordinates of the hole (circle) center are shown as  D4 and 
 D5 respectively in the equation editor and on the sketch. To delete an equation, right click its row >  Delete Equation 
from popup. To edit it, click the column ( Figure   2.16B  ) you want to edit.

 HANDS-ON FOR  EXAMPLE   2.4  .   The sketch of this example has a problem. A user can make the hole 
diameter,  D3 , larger than the rectangle height,  D2 . Add this equation to the sketch to solve this problem: 
 D3  0.5 D2 . 
 2.17  Geometric Modifiers 
 A  geometric modifier  is a qualifier to select designated points, such as end- or mid-
points, on an existing (already created) sketch entity. The benefit of using these modi-
fiers is to speed up entity creation by accessing these points without having to calculate 
their coordinates explicitly by hand. Geometric modifiers are part of what SolidWorks 
calls  quick snaps . Geometric modifiers are  end ,  center , and  intersection . The  end mod-
ifier identifies the endpoints of an entity. If the entity is an open curve, like a line, it has 
two separate endpoints. If the entity is closed, like a circle, it has two coincident end-
points. The  center modifier identifies the center or midpoint of an entity. For a line, it 
is the midpoint, and for a circle it is the point located on its circumference at 180° (not 
its center). The  intersection  modifier identifies where two entities intersect. If more 
than one intersection point exists, the CAD software picks up the one closest to the user 
selection. As you sketch, SolidWorks anticipates your next move and displays the 
expected intent (modifier) if you hover over an existing entity.

Chapter 2: Modeling Management
 2.18  Grids 
 A  grid is an equally spaced set of points in either a rectangular or radial pattern. Rectan-
gular grids are more commonly used. A grid has three parameters: spacing along two 
axes ( X and  Y ), an origin, and an orientation. Grids are used to speed up construction. 
Grids are useful in creating sketches with repetitive shapes. Click this sequence to dis-
play grids:  Tools > Options > Document Properties tab >  Grid/Snap > Check (turn 
on or off)  Display grid  and set the other properties shown in  Figure   2.17A  >  OK .  Figure 
 2.17B shows an example grid. Major grid lines are shown darker than the minor grid 
lines. The “+” symbol indicates a grid point. 
 Displaying a grid does not mean that you can snap to its points during construction. 
To turn on the snap, click  Tools > Options > System Properties tab >  Relations/
Snaps (under  Sketch item) > check (turn on or off)  Grid > OK . Grid lines are visible on 
the screen only when you are in a sketch. You know the snap is on when the mouse 
moves in a snappy unexpected way and a “+” symbol shows up when the mouse moves 
closer to a grid point.

 2.19  Patterns 
 Patterns are also known as  geometric arrays . A  pattern is a uniform layout of a sketch 
entity or a feature in specific directions. Examples include the keys of a phone key-
pad and the holes in a flange. You may pattern an entity along a curve (known as a 
 curve-driven pattern ). Two types of patterns exist: rectangular (Cartesian) and circu-
lar (angular). A rectangular pattern is also known as a  linear pattern . The instances of 
a linear pattern are separated by increments in the X and/or Y directions. The 
instances of a circular pattern are separated by increments in the angular and/or 
radial directions. 
 You may pattern sketch entities or features. You need to be in a sketch to pattern 
sketch entities and out of a sketch to pattern features.

 2.20  Selecting, Editing, and Measuring Entities 
 There are multiple reasons why you would want to select existing entities (e.g., to edit 
them, use them for new construction, delete them). You may select entities in a sketch 
or in a feature. The available selection methods are: 
 ■  Click an entity to select it.  
 ■  To select multiple entities at the same time, press the  Ctrl key on the keyboard 
followed by clicking the entities.  
 ■  To select many entities, define a select window around them by dragging the 
mouse from left to right or right to left to enclose the entities.  
 ■  To select entities in a chain (e.g., a rectangle or polygon), right-click any entity in 
the chain and choose  Select Chain from the menu that pops up. You must have a 
chain; otherwise you will not see the  Select Chain option.  
 ■  To select entities in a loop, follow the same sequence for chains. Loops and chains 
are similar; we use loops when we select from feature faces, and chains when we 
select from sketches.  
 ■  You can select any nodes (features, components, planes, drawing views) from the 
features tree on a part.  
 ■  As you move the mouse over entities to select them, SolidWorks attaches a symbol 
to the mouse indicating the entity type it senses: line for edge, square for face, and 
dot for vertex (corner).  
 ■  If multiple entities overlap where the mouse is, you can right-click any entity and 
choose  Select Other from the menu that pops up to step through all the entities 
under the mouse. 
 Editing an entity includes offsetting, trimming, and transforming. Offsetting an 
entity means copying it in a new location defined by an offset distance. Click  Offset 
Entities on the  Sketch tab to investigate. Trimming an entity entails shortening or 
extending it. Mostly we trim entities to shorten them. Click the  Trim Entities drop-
down on the  Sketch tab >  Trim Entities  and investigate the available different trim-
ming options. One of the very interesting and powerful trimming options is the 
 Power trim . If you select this option and move the mouse over an entity, it gets 
trimmed. 
 Transforming an entity includes translating (moving), copying, rotating, scaling, 
mirroring, or stretching it. You can transform sketch entities or features. To transform 
sketch entities, click the  Move Entities  dropdown on the  Sketch tab and investigate. A 
translation ( Move Entities ) requires a translation vector (i.e., a distance and direction). 
A rotation ( Rotate Entities ) requires a center of rotation and an angle. Copying ( Copy 
Entities ) requires a copying distance. Scaling ( Scale Entities ) requires a scale factor and 
a point to scale about. Stretching ( Stretch Entities ) requires a point to stretch with 
respect to. Mirroring ( Mirror Entities  on the  Sketch tab) requires a mirror axis. It has 
its own icon on the  Sketch tab. 
 Transforming features occurs in 3D space, unlike transforming sketch entities, 
which occurs in 2D (the sketch plane). Thus, a translation vector is defined by three 
components:  x ,  y , and  z ; or it may be defined by an edge (to define direction) and 
a distance. A rotation requires a rotation axis and an angle. You can translate, rotate, 
scale, or mirror features. You can also make a copy of the feature you want to transform 
and keep the original feature in its place. Click this sequence to access translate/rotate 
functions:  Insert (menu)  > Features > Move/Copy.  The pane that opens up to the left 
of the screen allows you to translate or rotate. 

Chapter 2: Modeling Management
63
 To scale a feature, click  Insert (menu)  > Features > Scale . You can perform uni-
form or nonuniform scaling. Uniform scaling preserves the feature aspect ratio (i.e., 
it does not distort its look). Uniform scaling uses the same scale factor for the three 
axes. Nonuniform scaling uses different scale factors. To mirror a feature, click 
 Mirror  on the  Features  tab. To mirror, you need a mirror face or plane and the 
features to mirror. 
 After editing or transforming entities, we may need to measure their geometric 
properties. We can measure sketch entities or features. We can measure coordinates of 
a point or length of an entity if we are in a sketch. For a feature, we can measure the 
coordinates of a vertex, the length of an edge, or the area and the perimeter of a face. 
Click this sequence to measure:  Tools > Measure  > select any entity to measure. Meas-
urements could be useful during design activities.  
 2.21  Boolean Operations 
 Boolean operations are the mathematical functions that SolidWorks uses to combine 
features during model creations. CAD/CAM systems utilize set theory, surface-to-surface 
intersection, curve-to-curve intersection, and curve-to-surface intersection to imple-
ment Boolean operations. A Boolean operation combines two features (we call them 
 bodies ) at a time. The most common Boolean operations are union, intersection, and 
subtraction. The union of two features is their sum. The intersection of two features is 
the overlapping volume between them. The subtraction of two features is the opposite 
of intersection; that is, it is the volume left in a feature after subtracting another feature 
from it. While the order of selecting the two features is not important for both union and 
intersection, it is for subtraction. Let us assume we have two features A and B. if you 
subtract A from B, the result is what is left from B. Conversely, if you subtract B from A, 
the result is what is left from A. The feature you are subtracting from is sometimes called 
the  target . The feature that is used to subtract is called the  tool , analogous to machining 
cutting tools. 
 When you create a feature in SolidWorks, the default is to combine it with the pre-
vious feature ( Merge Result ), thus resulting in only one feature (body) at any time. If 
you check off the  Merge Result  box in the left pane of feature creation, you get multiple 
bodies that you can apply Boolean operations to. To access Boolean operations, click 
 Insert > Features > Combine . While the use of Boolean operations is not obvious, 
there are cases where you may need it. For example, you can use the subtraction opera-
tion to create molding, casting, or forming tools. 
 Example 2.7   Investigate Boolean operations 
 Solution     We create a block and a shaft as separate features. We refer to them as B and S respectively. We 
combine them via Boolean operations.  Figure   2.20  shows B and S and the results. All dimensions are 
in inches.

 Note: The two shaft pieces are one “disjoint” body; 
deleting one piece deletes the other.  
 
 2.22  Templates 
 Templates are also known as  start  or  master parts . You customize the template to 
include your preferred settings in tools, options, and document properties. You may 
also include your favorite base stock (geometry and features), dimensions (preferred 
units, decimals, tolerances), annotations favorites, commonly used reference geome-
try, preset drawing views, drawing notes, layers, or materials. You can create different 
templates: one for parts, one for assemblies, and one for drawings. You create any 
template as you would create any file and save as template, as you do in Word. For 
example, to save a part document (file) as a template, click  File > Save As > select 
 Part Templates (*.prtdot)  from the  Save as type  dropdown > type file name >  Save . 
The document is saved in the SolidWorks  Templates folder and will become available 
when you start a new part. SolidWorks templates are saved in this folder:  C: \Program 
Data\SolidWorks\SolidWorks 2014\template s. Note that the  Program Data folder is 
a hidden file. You need to make hidden files visible on your computer to see it (for 
Windows 7, open  Windows Explorer  >  Organize > Folder and Search Options > 
View tab  > Show hidden files, folders, and drives > OK ). Click this sequence to use 
the template:  File > New  > Advanced > Select the template from the  Templates tab 
>   OK . You can create multiple templates of the same type (part, assembly, drawing) 
for multiple designs or applications.  
 2.23  Viewing 
 You can view a model from different angles during construction. The typical standard 
views are the front, top, right, and isometric views. Other views exist (e.g., back, bot-
tom, left). Viewing and creating a model are two different activities. Viewing is control-
led by the view orientation you select, while construction is controlled by the active 
sketch plane (i.e., the WCS). While we can view the model from any view during crea-
tion, we usually view the model perpendicular to the active sketch plane to get the best 
view of the results of our creation activities.   Figure   1.7  shows the various ways to view 
geometry on the screen.

Chapter 2: Modeling Management
 2.24  Model Communication 
 CAD models are communicated and shared by two distinct groups of people: technical 
and professional. Technical people include CAD designers, design engineers, and manu-
facturing engineers. Professional people include marketing, sales, and other personnel. 
Although engineering drawings are the formal method of documenting and communi-
cating a design among technical people, professional people have other communication 
needs, such as generating screenshots of the model for inclusion in reports, proposals to 
customers, presentations, and e-mail messages. These needs do not require SolidWorks 
software, unlike engineering drawings that do require access to SolidWorks software to 
view them. Also, technical people know how to use SolidWorks, whereas professional 
people do not. 
 Recognizing these needs and the inability or disinterest of professional people in 
learning how to use SolidWorks, SolidWorks offers some effective communication 
tools. Designers use these tools and generate files for use by professional people. 
The designers themselves can use these files also to liberate themselves from need-
ing SolidWorks wherever they go. For example, they can use them to communicate 
with customers (during the design phase), subcontractors, suppliers, and others. To 
generate screenshots of SolidWorks graphics/geometry pane, click:  View >  Screen 
Capture >  Image Capture . SolidWorks stores the screen capture in Windows 
 FIGURE 2.21 
 SolidWorks eDrawings  

Chapter 2: Modeling Management
67
buffer, waiting for you to use it. Simply open the application such as Word or 
PowerPoint and paste the capture (use  Ctrl + v combination on the keyboard). Alter-
natively, when you save a part, assembly, or a drawing, you can save it as an image. 
Click:  File  >  Save As  > select  JPEG (*.jpg) or  Tif (*.tif) from the  Save as type 
dropdown menu. 
 SolidWorks offers two methods to view SolidWorks files (parts, assemblies, 
drawings) without needing SolidWorks software. You can download and install the 
SolidWorks viewer for free. Visit  www.solidworks.com/sw/downloads.htm , then 
click the  FREE CAD TOOLS  tab. Follow the instructions to download and install 
the viewer version you need. The viewer version must be compatible with the Solid-
Works files you intend to open. The viewer, like SolidWorks itself, is backward com-
patible but not forward compatible (i.e., the 2014 version can open 2013 and older 
files, but not 2015 files). We encourage you to use and investigate the viewer menus 
and options. You can use these to transform (translate, rotate, or scale) or add lighting 
to the model. 
 The best of all options is the eDrawings tool. eDrawings is a free application 
from SolidWorks that allows you to view SolidWorks part, drawing, and assembly 
files. You can save any SolidWorks file as an  eDrawings  file. SolidWorks offers 
eDrawings software, a very interesting free tool to open and manipulate eDrawings 
files. After the file is open, you can rotate the CAD model. Click the mouse and 
rotate the model to view. eDrawings is installed automatically with SolidWorks soft-
ware. An interesting feature is stamping a model or a drawing.  Figure   2.21 shows a 
stamped model.   
 2.25  Tutorials 
 
Tutorial 2–1:  Create a Coil Spring 
 Create the coil spring shown in  Figure   2.22  . This tutorial shows how to create a spring 
(for learning purposes) although you can download a SolidWorks CAD model as an 
off-the-shelf component. For example, you can download a spring from McMaster-Carr 
(e.g., part #9271K182) or use SolidWorks Toolbox to find one.  Figure   2.22  shows the 
coil spring modeling plan. All dimensions are in inches.

 Note: We use the features approach here to create the 
six holes in the mount plate, instead of the cross section

and pattern it. This strategy is good because if you edit 
the original hole, the pattern holes update automatically.

assemble it to the already assembled components, and so forth. This latter approach works 
better for large assemblies that may have many components. Also, keep in mind that the 
first component you insert into the assembly becomes fixed in the assembly modeling 
space (graphics window). An ( f ) shows next to its node in the assembly tree. You can al-
ways float the component if needed: right click it >  Float from the popup that opens; or,

 Design Intent  
 3.1  Introduction 
 Design intent is important in CAD design. It influences the way we think about creating 
CAD models. Generally, we define  design intent  as the rationale behind the decision-
making process during design. There is a difference between design intent and design 
functionality. Intent justifies the design whereas functionality describes what the design 
does. The effect of design intent is observed in design and manufacturing tasks, for 
example, editing/modifying the design or manufacturing the part. Design intent is not a 
well-defined topic; it is open for different interpretations and may take various forms. 
Some view design intent as equations, geometric relations, mating conditions in assem-
blies, and/or the sequence of creating a part. Others believe design intent is to create the 
CAD part in the same way it will be manufactured (machined). Some even talk about 
manufacturing intent. 
 Although it is universally acknowledged that knowing and using design intent are 
important, there is a lack of both support for framework for design intent and wide-
spread use in engineering. Yet, interest in design intent systems has grown. We define a 
 design intent system  as a tool for capturing design intent and making it easily accessi-
ble. These systems are important tools because they include not only the reasons behind 
a design decision but also the justification for it, the other alternatives considered, the 
trade-offs evaluated, and the arguments that led to the decision. Design intent systems 
improve dependency management, collaboration, reuse, maintenance, learning, and 
documentation. 
 Because the design and manufacturing processes evolve around the geometric shape 
of the product, the current CAD/CAM systems are based on geometric modeling tech-
niques. Although these techniques are powerful modeling tools, they are deficient in 
recording the embodiment details of the product such as design intent, manufacturing 
specifications, and other constraints. CAD/CAM systems cannot easily answer design-
related questions such as “How is it supposed to work?” “Why is it done this way?” 
“What alternatives were considered?” “What can be changed?” and “What will be 
affected?”  
 CHAPTER

86
Chapter 3: Design Intent
 3.2  Capturing Design Intent 
 In terms of geometric modeling, the part modeling plan is the best expression of design 
intent. We also follow the notion of designing the part “as you would manufacture it.” 
Tutorial 3–1 shows an example. We can capture design intent in various ways during 
geometric modeling: 
  
1.  Modeling plan: A plan involves careful selection of a modeling sequence and evalu-
ating how it affects future editing, modifications, and changes. In general, mod-
eling plans depend on personal preferences and experiences, level of design 
knowledge, level of manufacturing knowledge, and heuristics and rules among 
designers in a company.  
  
2.  Sketch relations: Specify relations among sketch entities to capture the design intent 
among them. For example, two entities may be parallel or perpendicular to each 
other.  
  
3.  Equations: Define equations to capture design intent.  
  
4.  Assembly mating conditions: These conditions specify how components of an assem-
bly are connected to each other.  
 Keep in mind that with good design intent, CAD models can be updated almost 
effortlessly. Changes made to one aspect of a model propagate appropriately through the 
model, assembly, and drawing. With poor design intent, features may update inappro-
priately or fail. When selecting references, creation sequence, or other modeling activi-
ties, always ask yourself how the model might change. Should a hole stay centered on 
the part? Should it remain a fixed distance from some face or edge? Should it move with 
an associated feature, such as a boss? Considering the full range of possible changes, will 
a drastic change in a dimension make a sketch impossible to resolve, for example, turn-
ing it inside out? 
 The CAD designer should carefully consider the consequences of his or her design 
methodology. The following is a list of typical questions that the designer may address 
to facilitate capturing the design intent without violating the design concepts: 
 ■  Which feature to create first, that is, what is the base feature  
 ■  In what order other features should follow (holes, cutouts, chamfer, fillets)  
 ■  What tool to use to create a feature (some geometries such as holes can be created 
using many different tools/commands)  
 ■  What sketch plane to use (a default sketch plane or a feature face )  
 ■  How to dimension the feature sketch (should an arc use a radius or diameter?)  
 ■  What relations to use to lock the sketch shape (horizontal, vertical, parallel, etc.)  
 ■  What equations to use that ensure valid sketch updates (length  2*width) 
 ■  How the feature will be dimensioned in the drawing  
 ■  Can the components be assembled in reality?  
 ■  What is the ease of assembly?  
 ■  What assembly constraints to use (screw in a hole)  
 ■  Do these constraints reflect/mimic reality?  
 ■  What entities to select to apply assembly constraints (shaft in bearing using inner face)  
 ■  Can the feature be machined/produced? If yes, is it cost effective?  
 How much planning and consideration should a designer give to design intent? The 
answer is difficult. We are certain that paying too much attention to design intent pro-
hibits creativity and innovation in design, and slows finishing modeling tasks consider-
ably. Our advice is that design intent and intuition come with experience. Sometimes it 
is hard to foresee all possible cases down the design road. Thus, start with the obvious 
design intent in your part, and discover other design intent during modeling.  

Chapter 3: Design Intent
87
 3.3  Documenting Design Intent 
 Documenting and capturing design intent make your design more reusable and easier to 
modify in the future, by both you and other designers. Documenting design intent facil-
itates communicating and enforces any agreed-upon design principles and rules. The 
key to effective use of design intent is to be sure all members of the design team consist-
ently document it all the time. The design intent can be shared via HTML or Word 
documents, as shown in this chapter. SolidWorks provides multiple methods to docu-
ment design intent: comments, design binder, equations, design tables, configurations, 
dimension names, feature names, and organizing the features tree into folders. These 
methods are discussed in the sections to follow.  
 3.4  Comments 
 A designer may add comments to features. The designer documents the decisions made 
during the design process to enable other design team members to understand the design 
intent of the features design, thus enabling them to modify the design more easily. Click 
this sequence to add a comment to a feature: Right-click a feature from the features tree 
>  Comment (from the window that pops up) >  Add Comment  > type your comments 
in the window that opens up >  Save and Close . This sequence opens the sticky note 
shown in  Figure   3.1  A. We recommend that your note begins with a date/time stamp and 
your name followed by your comment. Your comments should be succinct, short, and 
explain your decisions. When you hover over the feature, your note appears in a balloon, 
as shown in  Figure   3.1 B. The features tree has a folder called  Comments that appears in 
the tree only when you add comments to features. Features that have comments appear 
in the  Comments folder. To edit or delete comments of a feature, right-click it in the 
 Comments folder, and select from the menu that pops up shown in  Figure   3.1  C.    
 (B) View comments  
 (C) Edit/delete comments

88
Chapter 3: Design Intent
 3.5  Design Binder 
 The design binder is an embedded Microsoft Word document that allows you to add 
more elaborate information about your design than the comments you add in sticky 
notes. You can add text, screenshots, or any content just like a typical Word document. 
Follow this sequence to display the  Design Binder  in a features tree:  Tools >  Options 
>  System Options  tab >  FeatureManager (from pane on left) > select  Show (for  Design 
Binder ) from dropdown list >  OK . This sequence shows the Designer Binder node in 
the features tree. Note that it shows in every part features tree you open because it is a 
system-level option. You follow the above sequence to turn the node off by selecting 
 Hide from the dropdown list. When you expand the  Design Binder  in the features tree, 
you see a  Design Journal Word document ( Figure   3.2  A). It is an empty document. 
Double-click it to open it and start documenting ( Figure   3.2  B) or right click it to see a 
menu. The document has three lines; the first one is the part name (see  Figure   3.2  B). 
You can include screenshots of the design in addition to writing. The journal is saved 
automatically; there is no need to save the document upon exiting it. It is saved with the 
part; you would not see it. However, you can save a copy of it if you click Word  File > 
 Save Copy As . Right-click the  DesignJournal.doc item in the features tree to delete it 
( Figure  3.2 A). If you delete it, an empty document replaces it.   
 (B)  Design Journal document 
 FIGURE 3.2 
 Design Binder 
 (A)  Design Journal options 
 Another important observation is that  Design Binder  enables you to load attach-
ments; use this sequence: right click the  Design Binder  node in features tree >  Add 
Attachment > browse to locate and select attachment >  OK . The attachment is added as 
a node under the default  Design Journal.doc  node. Right click it to open or delete it. 
The attachment idea is very useful, as you can upload documents related to the design 
such as special calculations, group brainstorming sessions, and hand-drawn conceptual 
sketches. Effectively, the  Design Binder becomes the central depository for the design.  
 3.6  Equations 
 Section   2.16 in  Chapter   2 covers  how to create and use equations. When you use equa-
tions, make sure you use meaningful names for the dimensions variables used in the 
equation for better readability.  

Chapter 3: Design Intent
89
 3.7  Design Tables and Configurations 
 Design tables are a design tool that allows you to change dimensions and create a new 
instance of the part. These instances form a family of parts (configurations).  We cover 
design tables and configurations later in the book.   
 3.8  Dimension Names 
 Changing the default dimension names to more meaningful names enhances design 
intent.   Chapter   2 shows  how to change dimension names. These names make equations 
or design tables more readable.  
 3.9  Feature Names 
 Changing the default names of features in the features tree to more meaningful names 
makes it much easier to follow the tree and makes the design intent clearer for someone 
who wants to reverse engineer the part creation steps. The default names are usually the 
feature type followed by a number (e.g.,  Extrude1 ,  Extrude2 ,  Revolve1 ,  Cut-
Extrude1 ). To change a feature’s name, click the name twice slowly (do not double-
click) in the features tree and type the new name.  Figure   3.3  shows the same features 
tree with default names and better names. To make naming features easier, you can 
enable the  Name option (check box) by clicking this sequence:  Tools >  System Options 
>  FeatureManager >  Name feature on creation . When you click the green check mark 
to finish the feature creation, SolidWorks highlights the feature name and waits for you 
to input a new name.

Chapter 3: Design Intent
 3.10  Folders 
 You can organize the features tree into folders to help the user follow the design. You 
can create folders in a part or assembly tree. You can rename new folders and drag fea-
tures into them, thus reducing the length of the tree. When you select a folder in the 
features tree, all the parts of the folder are highlighted in the graphics pane on the 
screen. Conversely, when you select a feature in the graphics pane, its corresponding 
folder is highlighted and expanded in the features tree. You can drag and drop features 
into tree folders as long as you do not violate the model topology. SolidWorks stops you. 
 You must have at least one feature (to click it) to create features tree folders. To cre-
ate a new folder, right-click any feature on the tree, and select  Add to New Folder or 
 Create New Folder  from the popup window that opens. To delete a folder, right click 
it and select  Delete from the popup windows that opens. Deleting a folder does not 
delete its content (features inside it). It only removes the folder from the features tree 
and leaves its features in their respective locations in the tree.  
 3.11  Tutorials 
 The theme for the tutorials in this chapter is to get you to practice creating and docu-
menting design intent. 
 
Tutorial 3–1:  Design Intent via Two Modeling Plans 
 This tutorial applies the concept that design intent is to create the CAD part such that it 
will lend itself to quick and painless modification in the future. It also applies the con-
cept that a part should be designed the same way it will be manufactured (machined). 
The part is slider block shown in  Figures   3.4  and   3.5  . It is an extrusion with two holes, 
a slot, and a chamfer. There are two modeling plans to create the part: cross section or 
features.  Figures   3.4  and   3.5  show each plan and its steps. The first plan uses a total of 
two operations, whereas the second plan uses five operations. Both result in the same 
part; however, later you will see why the features plan is better when it comes to editing 
the part later.

 HANDS-ON FOR  TUTORIAL   3–1 .   A revision of the design calls for the horizontal hole in the front face to 
be blind with depth of 1.0. Modify the block of each plan accordingly. Which plan is easier to modify and why? 
 
Tutorial 3–2:  Design Intent via Three Modeling Plans 
 This tutorial applies the concept that design intent is to create the CAD part in the 
same way it will be manufactured (machined).  Figure   3.6  shows a drain plug. We can 
think of at least three modeling plans to create the plug. In the first plan ( Figure   3.6  A), 
called  Additive modeling plan , we continuously add features to previous features. For the 
second plan ( Figure   3.6  B),  Cross-section modeling plan , we revolve the cross section to

create the entire part in one feature. Finally in the third plan ( Figure   3.6  C),  Subtractive 
(manufacturing) modeling plan , we create the part using an extrusion and two revolve 
cuts to mimic how the part would be manufactured on a lathe.

Tutorial 3–4:  Design Intent via Mating Conditions 
 We create the Pin Block assembly shown in  Figure   3.8  . This tutorial applies the concept 
that design intent is to create the CAD part in the same way it will be used in an assem-
bly. The pin shall remain centered on the block regardless of changes. We will create 
the pin and the block about a center plane ( Front Plane ). We will then use this center 
plane to mate the two parts.   
 HANDS-ON FOR  TUTORIAL   3–3 .   We enforce the design intent in our modeling plan by using the fol-
lowing relation:  Coincident relation between the right end of the sweep path and the inner edge of the 
wheel. Remove this relation and modify the wheel radius to 1.00. What happens to the spokes?

 Basic Part Modeling 
 The primary goal of this part is to explore and cover the details of engineering drawings, 
assemblies, and rendering. We have covered these topics briefly in  Part   I . Each topic has 
its own chapter in this  Part   II to understand it in depth.  Part   II also covers the full set of 
features that can be used in CAD modeling. In  Part   I , we purposely have limited our 
models to the basic features of extrusions and revolves.  
 Chapter   4 (Features and Macros) is all about learning when and how to use the full 
set of features available to enable you to design any parts and complex geometry you 
may run into.  Chapter   5 (Drawings) covers the details of drawings including the crea-
tion and control of the title block.  Chapter   6  (Assemblies) covers assembly details 
including the bottom-up and top-down approaches.  Chapter   7 (Rendering and Anima-
tion) closes Part II by showing how to create realistic rendering of parts and assemblies, 
including showing material and texture. CAD visualization is important to convey and 
present designs efficiently.

 Features and Macros  
 4.1  Introduction 
 We have been using a limited set of features thus far in the book. We have used extru-
sions and revolves. In terms of  SolidWorks,  we have used   Extruded Boss/Base and 
 Revolved Boss/Base , and their subtracting counterparts,  Extruded Cut and  Revolved 
Cut . These four features  create one class of parts: the ones with constant cross sections. 
We use extruded boss or cut to create uniform thickness parts. We use the revolved boss 
or cut to create axisymmetric parts. Amazingly, these four features can create about 80% 
or more of the mechanical parts. 
 Other classes of parts exist that these four features cannot create. These are the parts 
whose cross sections are variable, or parts that have nonplanar faces or other geometric 
shapes. The features that allow us to create these types of parts are loft, sweep, the hole 
wizard, rib, draft, shell, and dome as shown in  Figure   4.1  . We cover all these features in 
this chapter. You can also access more features by clicking this sequence:  Insert (menu) 
>  Features .  
 CHAPTER 
4 
 FIGURE 4.1 
 Available features  
 A  feature is defined as a solid that when combined with other features (solids) cre-
ates parts. Conversely, a CAD part consists of a set of features created in a certain sequence 
stored in its features tree. Some features, such as bosses and cuts, originate as sketches 
while others, such as shells and fillets, modify other features. Features are always listed in 
the features tree ( FeatureManager Design Tree as SolidWorks calls it) of the part. 
 Today’s modeling is referred to as feature-based modeling, and the resulting models 
are known as feature-based models. The first feature you create in a part is known as the 
base feature. You use the base feature as the basis to create other features. A base feature 
obviously cannot be negative (i.e., a cut). SolidWorks would not allow you to do that. 
When you begin feature creation,  Extruded Boss/Base  and  Revolved Boss/Base  are the 
only selectable feature types. While you would also expect  Swept Boss/Base  and  Lofted 
Boss/Base to be selectable when you begin feature creation, they are not. The  Lofted Boss/
Base becomes selectable only after you create a sketch (profile), and the  Swept Boss/
Base becomes selectable after you create a cross section and a path (sweep direction).  

102
Chapter 4: Features and Macros
 4.2  Features 
 If we want to master feature-based modeling, we should be able to answer three funda-
mental questions: 
  
1.  What are the available features that a CAD/CAM system offers for modeling parts?  
  
2.  What is the input required to create each feature?  
  
3.  Which feature should we use for a given modeling problem?  
 Section  4.1  and  Figure   4.1  provide the answer to the first question.  Table  4.1  
answers the other two questions. It shows a simple basic example of each feature. Keep 
in mind that the third question may have multiple answers; one of them is always the 
best answer. For example, we may use a loft or a sweep. However, if the part has a con-
stant cross section along a curve, sweep is better to use because it requires fewer steps to 
create the part. If the part has a variable cross section, a loft is better to use. The tutorials 
in this chapter provide some modeling examples.

 When to use in modeling? 
 1 
 Extrusion 
 Cross section and a thickness 
  
 • Use for parts with constant 
cross section (CS) and uniform 
thickness (UT). 
 • If needed, break part into sub-
parts, each with a constant CS 
and UT. 
 2 
 Revolve 
 Cross section, an axis of revolution, 
and an angle of revolution 
 
 • Use for parts that are axisym-
metric. 
 • If needed, break part into sub-
parts, each of which is axisym-
metric. 
 3 
 Sweep 
 Linear sweep: cross section and a 
line as a path 
 
 • Use for parts with constant 
cross section (CS) along a 
linear direction (path) that may 
or may not be perpendicular to 
the cross section. 
 • If the path is perpendicular to 
the cross section, the linear 
sweep becomes an extrusion. 
 
  
 Nonlinear sweep: cross section and 
a curve as a path 
 
 • Use for parts with constant 
cross section (CS) along a 
nonlinear direction that may or 
may not be perpendicular to 
the cross section.

 Loft 
 Linear loft: at least two cross 
sections (profiles) 
 
 • Use for parts with variable 
cross section along a given 
direction. 
 • The cross sections are blended 
linearly from one section to 
the other. 
 
  
 Nonlinear loft: at least two cross 
sections (profiles), and a curve as a 
guide curve 
 
 • Use for parts with variable 
cross section along a given 
direction. 
 • The cross sections are blended 
nonlinearly from one section 
to the other, along the guide 
curve. 
 5 
 Rib 
 Rib profile (e.g., line or stepwise 
line) 
 
 • Use when a stiffener between 
angled walls (faces) of a part is 
required to increase part struc-
tural strength. 
 6 
 Shell 
 Shell face and shell wall thickness 
  
 • Use when you need to remove 
material from an existing part. 
 • The material removal (shelling) 
occurs in a direction perpen-
dicular to the selected shelling 
face. 
 • While you can achieve same 
result using an extrude cut for 
simple shells, a shell operation 
is faster to use. 
 7 
 Draft 
 Direction of pull, parting lines, and 
a draft angle. The direction of pull 
must be perpendicular to the part-
ing lines. 
 
 • Use when you need to draft 
faces at an angle; usually used 
for injection molding to allow 
pulling the molded part from 
the mold cavity.

Chapter 4: Features and Macros
 The other features shown in  Figure   4.1  and not covered in  Table   4.1  are covered in 
the tutorials of the chapter. 
 Example 4.1   Create the free-form torus shown in  Figure  4.2 . 
 Solution     The torus shown in  Figure  4.2 is a variation of the torus (donut shape) feature (No. 2) shown in 
 Table   4.1 . While that feature of  Table  4.1 is a revolve, the free-form torus shown in  Figure   4.2  can only be created 
as a sweep. The key modeling concept here is to use pierce relations to force the torus cross section (small circle) 
to conform to the sweep path (large circle) and the guide curve (closed spline), as we show in  Figure   4.2 . We 
pierce the small circle to the spline and pierce the center of the small circle to the large circle. These two pierce 
conditions force the small circle to become “elastic,” that is, it expands and shrinks, as it must always touch the 
spline and the big circle. Pierce condition is only available to pierce a point to a curve. You cannot pierce two 
curves. SolidWorks enables the pierce condition within the right context.

 4.3  Spur Gears 
 Gears are an important and essential mechanical element in mechanical design. A wide 
range of products and applications uses gears. There are various types of gears: spur, 
helical, bevel, spiral, worm, planetary, and rack and pinion, to name a few. Spur gear is 
the simplest type of gear, which we cover here. Typical mechanical design courses in 
colleges cover the principles and design of gears. In this section, we cover spur gears 
from a CAD point of view (i.e., how we construct a gear once it is designed). While gears 
are standard elements that can be purchased off the shelf (they can also be inserted from 
SolidWorks Toolbox into a part or assembly file), it is important to learn how to create 
a gear feature in a CAD/CAM system.  
 A gear tooth is the intricate part of a gear.  Figure   4.3  shows two meshing gears. 
 Figure   4.4A  shows the conjugate line and pressure angle.  Figure  4.4B  shows the involute

profile. Gearing and gear meshing ensure that two disks (the two gears) in contact roll 
against one another without slipping. Moreover, the gear teeth should not interfere with 
the uniform rotation that one gear would induce in the other, a requirement known as 
the conjugate action. The conjugate action also ensures that the perpendicular line to a 
tooth profile at its point of contact with a tooth from the other gear always passes through 
a fixed point on the centerline connecting the centers of the two meshing gears.  Figure 
 4.4A  shows the conjugate line. The conjugate line is also known as the line of force 
because the driving force from the driving gear (driver) is transmitted in the direction of 
this line to the other gear (driven). The angle between the perpendicular radius to the 
conjugate line and the centerline is always constant for two meshing gears. This angle is 
known as the  pressure angle and is shown as the angle Ø in  Figure   4.4A  . 
 The key to successful functional gears is the conjugate action. While various profiles 
can produce conjugate action, the involute profile is the best because it allows for imper-
fections in gear manufacturing and yet maintains the conjugate action. The imperfection 
may produce a slightly different distance between the two shafts of the gears from the 
designed value.  Figure   4.4B  shows how the shape of the involute profile is generated. An 
 involute is defined as the path of the end point of a cord when it is pulled straight (held 
taut) and unwrapped from a circular disk as shown in  Figure   4.4B  . The involute geom-
etry ensures that a constant rotational speed of the driving gear produces a constant 
rotational speed in the driven gear. For spur gears, the teeth are cut perpendicular to the 
plane of the gear, where the involute profile resides. 
 The creation of a gear CAD model requires two basic concepts: knowledge of the 
gear geometry and the involute equation. The geometry is shown in  Figure   4.3  . The

 base circle  is the circle where the involute profile begins. The  pitch circle  defines the 
contact (pitch) point between the two gears (see  Figure   4.4A  ). The  dedendum circle is 
usually the same as the base circle, as can be concluded from  Figure   4.3  A (dedendum 
 d  r p  – r b  ). The  addendum circle is the circle that defines the top of the tooth as shown 
in  Figure   4.4C (addendum  a   r a  r p  , where  r a  is the addendum circle radius). Typi-
cally, the addendum and the dedendum are equal. In such case, the pitch and base circle 
sizes determine the values for both. The  root circle  is smaller than the base circle to 
allow cutting the tooth during manufacturing. The tooth profile between the base and 
root circles is not an involute. It could be any geometry such as line.  
 The creation of a gear CAD model requires two steps: calculate the tooth angle  
and the tooth involute profile. While many books on mechanical engineering design 
offer extensive in-depth coverage of gear analysis, we offer a simplified, but accurate, 
version to enable us to create a CAD model of the gear. We begin with the definition of 
circular pitch. As shown in  Figure   4.4C  , the  circular pitch ,  p c , is defined as the distance 
along the pitch circle between corresponding points on adjacent teeth. As shown in 
 Figure   4.4C , we use  p c  as the circular pitch of the gear,  r p  as the pitch circle radius, and 
 as the tooth angle. Using these variables, we can write: 
 
pc  dp
N  
(4.1)  
 Where  d p  2r p  is the pitch circle diameter, and  N is the number of gear teeth. From the 
tooth geometry shown in  Figure   4.4C  , we can write: 
 
pc
2   rp 
(4.2)  
 Substituting  p c  from  Eq.  (4.2)  into  Eq.  (4.1)  and reducing gives: 
 
  
N radians or   180
N  degrees  
(4.3)  
 The derivation of the involute equation is more complex and is not covered here. 
We align the involute of one tooth with the XY coordinate system as shown in  Figure 
 4.4D where the lowest point  P b  on the involute lies on the Y axis. This orientation does 
not represent a limitation, but rather simplifies the form of the involute equation, which 
is therefore given by: 
 x  rb(sin    cos )
y  rb(cos    sin )  
0    max 
(4.4)
 
 Where  r b  (the base circle radius) is given by (see  Figure   4.4A  ): 
 
rb  rp cos  
(4.5)  
 and ( x ,  y ) are the coordinates of any point  P on the involute at an angle   as shown in 
 Figure   4.4D . The lowest point  P b  on the involute corresponds to the value of    0 and 
lies on the base circle. Point  P a  lies on the addendum circle and does not necessarily cor-
respond to the value of     max . We can arbitrarily select a large enough value for   max 
so that the involute crosses the addendum circle and then trim it to that circle. There-
fore, we create the involute profile by generating points on it using  Eq.   (4.4)  and con-
necting them with a spline curve, or we input Eq. (4.4) into a CAD/CAM system. 
 The root circle is always less than the base circle. For simplicity, we have the root 
circle radius,  r r  , be 0.98 of the base circle radius (there are other formulas that do not 
give consistent results). Thus, we write: 
 
rr  0.98rb 
(4.6)

Chapter 4: Features and Macros
 The following steps summarize the calculations we need to create a gear CAD model: 
  
1.  The input parameters we need are the pitch circle radius  r p  , the pressure angle  Ø , 
and the gear number of teeth  N. 
  
2.  Calculate  r b  using  Eq.  (4.5)  . 
  
3.  Calculate  r r  using  Eq.  (4.6)  . 
  
4.  Calculate the gear dedendum  d  r p  r b . 
  
5.  Assuming that the addendum and dedendum are equal, calculate the addendum 
circle radius as  r a  r p  a   r p  d (see  Figures   4.4C  and   4.4D  ). 
  
6.  Use  Eq.  (4.3)  to calculate the tooth angle . 
  
7.  Enter the involute parametric equation given by Eq. (4.4) into a CAD/CAM system 
to sketch the involute curve as a spline.  
  
8.  Create one gear tooth and use sketch circular pattern to pattern it to create all gear 
teeth. 
 Example 4.2   Create the CAD model of a spur gear with  r p  60 mm,  Ø  20°, and  N  20. 
 Solution    Using the above calculation steps, we get  r b   56.382 mm,  d  a  3.618 mm,  r a   63.618 mm,  r r  
 55.254 mm, and   9°. There are two methods to create the tooth involute curve. 
 In the first method, we use  Eq.   (4.4)  with     5°. We generate 11 points on the involute, for a   max  50°. 
We generate the points on the involute curve. We then use  Insert >  Curve >  Curve Through XYZ Points . A better 
method is to input  Eq.   (4.4)  to SolidWorks and let it generate the curve. We need to use radians for the angle . We 
use 1 radian for   max . This value is arbitrary to ensure that the involute curve intersects and crosses the addendum 
circle to be able to trim it to the intersection point. Also, SolidWorks uses the parameter  t , requiring us to replace 
  by  t when we input the equation.  Figure   4.5 shows the spur gear. We create half a tooth, mirror it to create a full 
tooth, then circular pattern the full tooth to create all teeth of the gear. Here are the detailed steps.

 4.4  Design Library and Library Features 
 Design reuse and using off-the-shelf standard components are important concepts that 
speed up the design, and thus make it less expensive. The field of mechanical design has 
many standard parts that designers use every day in their designs (e.g., fasteners [nuts 
and bolts], gears, bearings). While these parts are universally standard, a company may 
have some parts that are unique and reusable only in that company’s designs. Solid-
Works provides the concepts of design library and library features to enable designers 
to reuse off-the-shelf components. 
 A  library feature is a part that you create once and save in a library for reuse in the 
future. This library is known as the  design library . You may save a library feature with the 
 .sldprt or  .sldlfp extension. Most of the time library features are inserted into assemblies 
as components or inserted into new empty (blank) parts. Commonly used library fea-
tures include holes, slots, and many others. You can use several library features to con-
struct a single part. Not only does this save time, but it also ensures consistency in your 
CAD models.  
 Using library features is easy; you drag a library feature from the design library and 
drop it onto the open part or assembly. SolidWorks asks you if you want to insert a copy 
or instance ( derived part ) of the part as shown in  Figure   4.6  . If you select  Yes , it inserts 
the copy in the open part. If you answer  No , it opens a blank part and inserts 
it there. 
 You save library features in a design library. You can organize the library 
into folders. SolidWorks comes with a Design Library. The path to this library 
folder is  C:\Program Data\SolidWorks\SolidWorks version\design library . (Make 
sure that hidden files are visible in Windows to see the  Program Data  folder.) 
Click the  Design Library tab in the SolidWorks Task Pane (shown on the 
right of the screen) as shown in  Figure  4.7A  , to open the design library. The 
library is organized into folders as shown in  Figure   4.7B  . You can also add 
 FIGURE 4.6 
 Using a library feature  

Chapter 4: Features and Macros
111
your new custom folders to the library. You should save your library features into the 
SolidWorks  Design Library  to have them accessible as shown in  Figure   4.7B  . If you do 
not, then you would have to navigate to the folder where you saved them. The most 
commonly used SolidWorks library is Toolbox shown in  Figure   4.7B  . Expand the Tool-
box node and investigate its content.   
 4.5  Configurations and Design Tables 
 Family of parts is a natural outcome of the parametrics concept of solid modeling. Defin-
ing a solid (part) in a sketch by parameters (dimensions are values for the parameters) 
enables us to modify the dimensions and create a different-size clone of the part with a 
click of a button. These clones are what we refer to as family of parts. SolidWorks calls 
them  configurations . We can also create clones of assemblies. The clones are created by 
changing the dimensions of some key parameters of the part or assembly. The clones 
have the same topology as the original, but different geometry. For example, consider a 
two-feature part: a base block and a shaft boss. You clone the part into a square 
block and a skinny long boss, or a rectangle block and short fat boss.  
 We use design tables to help create and control configurations in three ways: 
change sizes, change configurations of components, and/or suppress/unsuppress 
features. SolidWorks uses Microsoft Excel sheet as its design table. You can insert a 
design table into an open part or assembly by clicking this sequence:  Insert (menu) 
>  Tables > Design Table.  This opens the  Design Table  pane under the  Property-
Manager tab on the left pane, as shown in  Figure   4.8  . You can specify one of the 
three sources shown to create the design table. When you click the green check 
mark to finish, SolidWorks acts accordingly. For example, if you select the  Auto-
create (default) option, SolidWorks displays a list of the open part dimensions and 
asks you to select some to include in the design table. The table is created with the 
current values of the part dimensions as the default set (configuration). The set 
shows as a row in the table. You can add other rows with different values for 
dimensions. Each row is a configuration. The  Design Table  is saved under the 
 ConfigurationManager tab. 
 Example 4.3   Create design tables. 
 Solution     This example builds on  Example   2.4  . We create a design table where we change the value of param-
eter (demission name)  D2 to create four configurations of the sketch. The steps are as follows.

 4.6  Macros 
 Design automation offers two benefits. First, it enhances productivity. Second, it helps 
with repetitive tasks that are mundane. For example, if we follow the same design proc-
ess over and over, automating it would be the logical thing to do. 
 Macros aid in design automation. Macros are also viewed as a way to customize your 
CAD/CAM system. A  macro  is a short computer program that is used to repeat com-
monly performed operations. That computer program is generated automatically by a 
CAD/CAM system in the background during use of the system, from the time we turn the 
macro on until we turn it off. We can play the macro back after creation over and over, 
with different input values (e.g., new dimensions). After we create a macro, we can use it 

Chapter 4: Features and Macros
113
for recording, edit it, run it, pause it, stop it, and assign it to a shortcut (hot) key or to a 
menu item. When we assign a macro to a shortcut key or to a menu item, we can specify 
which method (function) of the macro to run. Click  Tools >  Macro to access the macro 
menu. SolidWorks saves the macro file in the same part folder and uses  .swp as the file 
extension, with default names of  Macro1.swp ,  Macro2.swp , unless you change them. 
 A higher level of automation than using macros is to use Visual Basic (VB) or another 
programming language to perform full automation and have better control of the automa-
tion. As a matter of fact, VB is the programming engine behind macros. Instead of writing 
the macro VB code, the SolidWorks macro interface enables us to generate the code auto-
matically while we perform the design tasks as usual. It is this VB code that we save in a 
file when we save the macro. We can use the VB editor to edit and tweak the VB code. 
 If you take a closer look at the macro VB code, it uses what we call the SolidWorks 
API (Application Programming Interface). The code makes calls to API functions. Think 
of API as the gateway between the application we want to write and SolidWorks code 
that has been already written. In other words, the API provides access to SolidWorks 
geometric engine. 
 You can learn VB programming by creating multiple macros, study their generated 
VB code, and expand on it. That is what we call the “brute force” approach. Just keep in 
mind that VB is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language that requires knowl-
edge and understanding of the object-oriented design and how objects are defined and 
implemented. 
 The programming approach could be useful to create an entire assembly from a few 
parameters. We can write a program to define some variables, storing them in a row in 
a design table. Each row represents a new version of the assembly. We delete all rows 
from the table and keep the last row, which is the new assembly. 
 Example 4.4   Develop a macro to create an extrusion. 
 Solution     This example illustrates creating and using macros. We create a block extrusion and record the steps 
of creating it in a macro.

how to fix it. Hit the  Debug button shown above to

investigate “what if” design scenarios such as sizes or feature 
locations.

 4.7  Tutorials 
 
Tutorial 4–1:  Create Sweep Features 
 A sweep feature requires, at minimum, a profile (cross section) to sweep and a path 
(curve) to sweep along. We can use a guide curve to control the sweep further. If we do 
not use a guide curve, the sweep cross section stays constant. 
 Sweep operations may fail for different reasons.  Figure   4.10  shows three of them. 
As a general rule, the sweep path and guide must intersect the cross section plane, and 
the cross section must not intersect itself as it traverses the path and/or the guide curve. 
 
 (B) Guide curve does not intersect CS plane.  
 
 (C) CS intersects itself.

Tutorial 4–2:  Create Loft Features 
 Create the wine glass shown in  Figure   4.12  . All dimensions 
are in inches. We introduce the concept of  Convert Entities 
on the  Sketch tab in this tutorial. We copy one circle in one 
sketch to another sketch. This concept enables us to copy 
entities from one sketch to another. While we could have 
easily created a new circle and dimensioned it, the  Convert 
Entities method is faster (no need to sketch a circle and 
dimension it). SolidWorks creates an  On Edge  relation be-
tween the two circles and shows a small green cube on the 
copied entity to indicate the relationship. When you click 
the copied circle while editing the sketch, SolidWorks dis-
plays the  On Edge  relation in the relations pane to the left 
of the screen.  
 HANDS-ON FOR  TUTORIAL   4–1 .   Change the cross sections of both sweeps to a 2 × 2 inch square.

incorrectly as shown to the right. 
 
Tutorial 4–3:  Use the Hole Wizard 
 The hole wizard provides two advantages. First, it helps us create standard hole sizes 
and types, so off-the-shelf bolts will fit perfectly in the holes. Second, it speeds up 
creating these holes greatly. This tutorial shows how to create sample holes: coun-
terbore, countersink, and tapped holes.  Figure   4.13 shows these holes. We create 
an extrusion and add holes to it. We also create  Sketch2 on the top face of the  Block 
feature with a center rectangle (construction rectangle) that we use to place holes at 
its corners.

Tutorial 4–6:  Create Features 
 This tutorial covers the creation of these features: chamfer, fillet, slot, shell, draft, and 
rib. All dimensions are inches. Here are useful observations: 
  
1.  Make sure to pay attention to the visual clues shown in the left pane while creating 
these features.  
  2.  For example, the box symbol under  Chamfer parameters indicates that you can 
chamfer a face, an edge, or a vertex (corner point). As expected, chamfering a face 
chamfers all its edges. Chamfering a corner chamfers the three edges that meet 
there. 
  3.  A rib requires a profile sketch (e.g., a line or stepwise line) and a thickness.

Tutorial 4–7:  Use the Smart Fasteners Wizard 
 We use the Smart Fasteners wizard to insert the correct fastener based on the hole we 
select. It is a form of automation using off-the-shelf components. SolidWorks has its 
own standard library of fasteners. We can only use the wizard at the assembly level. 
We need to activate the wizard in order for the  Smart Fasteners icon on the  Assembly 
tab to work. If we click the icon before activation, we get this error:  Smart Fasteners 
requires SolidWorks Toolbox, which is not present. 
 In this tutorial, we create an assembly of a block and plate. We create a counterbore 
hole in the plate and a blind hole in the block, assemble them, and fasten them together 
with a smart fastener.  Figure   4.16  shows the assembly and its tree. All dimensions are 
in inches.  
 HANDS-ON FOR  TUTORIAL   4–6 .   Create the following features: 
 1.   Distance-distance chamfer  
 2.   Vertex chamfer  
 3.   Variable size fillet  
 4.   Face fillet  
 5.   Full round fillet  
 6.   3-point arc slot

 5.1  Introduction 
 Engineering drawings are important in engineering for two reasons. First, designers use 
them to document their designs. Second, they are the  de facto  standard in design com-
munications among the various groups and departments involved in the product design 
and manufacturing (e.g., manufacturing, tooling, production, inspection, assembly). 
The typical (standard) sizes of engineering drawings are A, B, C, D, and E. 
 Generating engineering drawings requires knowledge of drafting and communica-
tion rules. In general, it is not a good idea to over-dimension or under-dimension views, 
just as it is not a good idea to over-define or under-define sketches. The drawing should 
be fully defined, just like a sketch.  Figure   5.1 shows the three possible scenarios of 
dimensioning a drawing. If you must show a redundant dimension, use the text “REF” 
next to it or include it in parentheses. Consequently, you would display the extra dimen-
sion shown in  Figure  5.1 B as 1.00REF or (1.00).

 Why is dimensioning a drawing so important? The way you display dimensions on 
the views implies how to manufacture the part. Let us limit our discussion to machining 
a part—that is, milling and/or drilling it. Dimensioning drawings requires manufactur-
ing knowledge. The CAD designer needs to know the common manufacturing processes 

138
Chapter 5: Drawings
 The dimensioning scheme shown in  Figure   5.1  A is ideal from a machining point of 
view. The scheme tells the machinist to use the left and bottom faces as references 
(datums) to measure from. The machinist begins with a rectangular block as a stock, 
cuts the left and bottom faces, and squares them, that is, makes them perpendicular to 
each other. Next, the machinist measures and cuts the two horizontal dimensions (2.00 
and 1.00) using the left face. Finally, the machinist measures and cuts the two vertical 
dimensions (4.00 and 2.50), using the bottom face to finish the part machining. Note: 
One problem with the part dimensions as shown here is that the machinist cannot pro-
duce them because they require zero tolerances. We must specify tolerances.  This is the 
topic of  Chapter  12 .  Without tolerances, the machining cost is prohibitively expensive. 
 The dimensioning scheme also conveys which dimensions are most important for 
the part functional requirements. In other words, you are telling the machinist that the 
1.00 and 2.00 horizontal dimensions are more important than any other combination 
(e.g., 1.00 and 1.00) or the other 1.00 and 2.00. Similarly, the 4.00 and 2.50 vertical 
dimensions are more important than the 4.00 and 1.50 or the 2.50 and 1.50 combina-
tions. The horizontal 1.00 and 1.00 combination and the vertical 2.50 and 1.50 combi-
nation are the worst dimensioning scheme because they make the machining cost 
expensive for this part. This scheme forces the machinist to machine the step faces 
(horizontal and vertical) very accurately to make them datums to measure from. 
 The best way to dimension a drawing in SolidWorks is to use the concept of model 
items we covered in Tutorial 1–4 in  Chapter   1 . Review the tutorial as it covers the basic 
important concepts in creating drawings . 
 5.2  Engineering Drafting and Graphics Communication 
 Section   5.1 provides a glimpse of how important dimensioning and tolerancing a part are. 
Some CAD designers, especially beginners or those without manufacturing experience or 
knowledge, do not see the value of dimensioning for manufacturing, but it is crucial. If 
unable to read the design intent embedded in your dimensioning scheme, the machinist will 
use his or her own interpretations to machine the part, resulting in a high rejection (scarp) 
rate during inspection and making the production very inefficient and expensive. You may 
want to consult the following books for more details on dimensioning and tolerancing: 
 ■  Dimensioning and Tolerancing Handbook by Bruce A. Wilson, Genium Publishing 
Corporation (ISBN 0-931690-80-3)  
 ■  Technical Drawing by Frederick E. Giesecke et al., Pearson Publishing Company 
(ISBN 0-13-008183-3)  
 The guidelines to follow for engineering drafting and graphics communication are 
standard. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International 
Organization for Standardization (ISO) committees maintain these standards in coordi-
nation and consultation with companies. There are abbreviation rules for use on draw-
ings and in text, dimensioning rules, and tolerancing rules. The American Society of 
Mechanical Engineers (ASME) publishes two documents on these subjects. ASME Y1.1-
1989, “Abbreviations for Use on Drawings and in Text,” covers the abbreviation rules. 
ASME Y14.5M-1994, “Dimensioning and Tolerancing,” covers the rules on how to dis-
play dimensions and tolerances on a drawing. ASME has published a revision of its well-
known ASME Y14.5M-1994; the new revision is ASME Y14.5-2009.  
and how they work. The designer also must be familiar with the common stock shapes 
available off the shelf. The way you dimension a drawing tells the machinist the way you 
want to produce the part, even if you do not do so intentionally. More importantly, the 
dimensioning scheme you use will influence the machining cost significantly.

 5.3  ASME Abbreviation Rules 
 ASME indicates where and how abbreviations should be used as well as some basic 
rules. ASME publishes the ASME Y1.1-1989 book that lists the abbreviations in alpha-
betical order. Here are some abbreviation rules: 
  
1.  Minimize using abbreviations:    Using abbreviations on drawings should be minimized 
for clarity purposes. ASME’s abbreviation book begins by stating that “the purpose 
is to establish standard abbreviations rather than to promote the use of abbrevia-
tions.” The reason is that abbreviations are language-dependent.  
  
2.  Pay attention to foreign use:    Abbreviations are conventional representations of 
words or names and may differ from one language to another. Thus, companies 
that are multinational should not use abbreviations.  
  
3.  Pay attention to clarity:    Abbreviations should be used only where necessary to save 
space and time. Also, use only the obvious abbreviations that are easy to under-
stand; otherwise, spell out the word(s).  
  
4.  Be aware of duplicates:     Duplicate abbreviations exist for some words because of the 
established practice. Thus, be careful.  
  
5.  Define when extensively used:     Books and large publications that use abbreviations 
should define them in one convenient place for readers to find.  
  
6.  Take advantage of single use:     Single organizations may use abbreviations more freely 
than do others because it is easier to set communication standards within one 
company. 
  
7.  Avoid using nonstandard abbreviations:     Refrain from making up and using your own 
abbreviations. Nobody but you will understand them.  
  
8.  Follow military rules:     Military agencies set and publish their own abbreviations for 
contractors to use. 
  
9.  Use all capital letters:     All abbreviations should be shown in capital letters on 
drawings and in lowercase in text.  
  10.  Avoid using subscripts:    Subscripts should not be used in abbreviations.  
 Figure  5.2 shows sample abbreviations.

 Some of the ASME drafting rules are as follows ( Figure   5.3  shows some of these):

Engineers. All rights reserved.) 
  
1.  Use tolerances:    Each dimension should have a tolerance except those 
dimensions that are labeled as reference, as discussed in  Section   5.1  . 
  
2.  Provide full feature definition:     Each feature should be fully dimen-
sioned so that it is fully understood.  
  
3.  Show only what is needed:    Show necessary dimensions for a complete 
definition of the part. Do not give more dimensions than necessary. 
Minimize the use of reference dimensions.  
  
4.  Follow functional requirements:     Select and arrange dimensions to meet 
the functional and mating requirements of a part. See  Section  5.1  , 
for example, on whether to use a 4.00 and 2.50 or 2.50 and 1.50 
combination. Also, there should be one and only one way to inter-
pret the dimensions.  
  
5.  Do not specify manufacturing methods:     Define the drawing without 
specifying manufacturing methods. For example, show a hole 
diameter on the drawing without indicating whether it is to be 
drilled, milled, punched, or reamed.  
  
6.  Show processing dimensions:     If needed, you may show processing 
dimensions to indicate, for example, finish or shrink allowance. In 
such a case, label the dimension as NON MANDATORY (MFG 
DATA), all in caps as shown here.  
  
7.  Show dimensions clearly:    Arrange dimensions so that they are easy to 
read, provide required information, are shown in true profile, and 
refer to visible outlines.  
  
8.  Use linear dimensions for specific parts:     Use linear dimensions for 
wires, cables, sheets, and rods that are produced according to gage 
or code numbers. These dimensions usually show the diameter or 
the thickness.  
  
9.  You may not specify a 90° angle:     If you have a pattern in which the 
centerlines are shown at right angles on the drawing, there is no 
need to show the angle; a 90° angle applies.  
  10.  Keep temperature in mind:     All dimensions shown on a drawing are 
assumed to be measured at room temperature (20°C or 68°F). If 
measurements are made at other temperatures, provide appropriate 
compensation.  
  11.  Understand geometric tolerances:     When you apply geometric toler-
ances, they apply to the full depth, length, and width of the feature.  
We cover geometric tolerances later in the book.  
 5.5  ASME Dimensioning Rules 
 We need to be familiar with the types of dimensions in order to understand their 
rules. These types are Cartesian, radial, angular, true length, and ordinate or base-
line. Cartesian dimensions are specified along the horizontal and vertical directions 
of the drawing views  as we have done in  Chapter   1  ’s tutorials . Radial dimensions 
specify a circle’s or arc’s radius or diameter. Angular dimensions specify an angle. 
True length dimensions specify a dimension along a line that is not horizontal or 

Chapter 5: Drawings
141
vertical. Ordinate or baseline dimensions specify all dimensions in one direction 
from a reference face or datum. 
 As a general rule for specifying ordinate or baseline dimensions, use fewer datums to 
reduce the machining cost of the part by requiring fewer part surfaces (faces) that must 
be machined with high accuracy to measure other dimensions from.  Figure   5.1 A shows 
the Cartesian and ordinate dimensioning types. The other dimensioning types are more 
obvious. The horizontal and vertical dimensions shown are for both the Cartesian and 
ordinate types. The horizontal dimensions (2.00 and 1.00) use the left face of the part as 
the datum. The vertical dimensions (4.00 and 2.50) use the bottom face of the part as the 
datum. The optimum ordinate dimensioning strategy (scheme) is to use only one datum 
per direction. This strategy guarantees the least machining cost to manufacture the part. 
 Some of the ASME dimensioning rules are as follows: 
  
1.  Be careful when to use a zero before the decimal point:     If the dimension is in millim-
eters and less than 1, use a zero before the decimal point; for example, use 0.5, not .5. If 
the dimension is in inches, do not use a zero; for example, use .5, not 0.5. See  Figure  5.3  . 
  
2.  Do not use a zero or the decimal point for a whole number millimeter dimension:     For 
example, use 35, not 35.0.  
  
3.  Do not add a zero to a decimal millimeter dimension:     For example, use 35.6, not 35.60.  
  
4.  Use the same number of decimal places as its tolerance for an inch dimension:     For exam-
ple, use 4.500, not 4.5 if the dimension tolerance requires three decimal places.  
  
5.  Show decimal points clearly:     The decimal points must be uniform, dense, and large 
enough to be clearly visible.  
  
6.  Use dimension lines correctly:     ASME rules prefer that dimension lines be broken for 
the insertion of the dimension value (number). You may use unbroken dimension 
lines, as shown in  Figure   5.1  . In such a case, the dimension value should be 
shown above the dimension line for horizontal lines.  Figure   5.1  follows this rule 
because the CAD/CAM system uses and enforces ASME rules.  
  
7.  Group dimension lines:     If possible, have all related dimension lines shown next to 
each other in one group to make it easier for users to read the engineering draw-
ing. In  Figure  5.1  , we could move the 4.00 dimension line to the right next to the 
2.50 dimension line to make them as one group.  
  
8.  Space dimension lines:     The space between the first dimension line and the part 
outline should not be less than 10 mm; and the space between succeeding parallel 
dimension lines should not be less than 6 mm.  
  
9.  Do not cross dimension lines:     Avoid crossing dimension lines. When unavoidable, 
the dimension lines are unbroken.  Figures   5.1  and   5.4  follow this rule where all 
dimension lines (lines with arrows) are not crossing.  
  10.  Do not cross extension (projection) lines:     An  extension line is a line that is perpen-
dicular to the part outline to allow placing the dimension line. For example, in 
 Figure  5.1 A, the two vertical lines extending down to place the 2.00 dimension 
line are extension lines. There is always a gap between the extension line and the 
part outline as shown. Extension lines should neither cross each other nor cross 
dimension lines. Where unavoidable, break the extension line.  
  11.  Use leaders (leader lines) if needed:     A  leader is a line used to place a dimension 
(e.g., a circle radius), a note (text on a drawing), or a symbol (special character) on 
a drawing. A leader terminates in an arrowhead if it ends on a part outline. If it 
ends inside the part outline, terminate it with a dot. Also, a leader should be an 
inclined straight line with a short horizontal portion extending to the first or last 
letter of the note, or the first or last digit of the dimension. Also, make adjacent 
leaders parallel to each other for ease of display.  
  12.  Use reference dimensions if needed.     When an overall dimension is specified, one 
intermediate dimension is omitted or identified as a reference dimension.

 Figure  5.4 shows sample dimensioning (we refer to the rule numbers just listed).  
 The drawing illustrating ASME Rule 6 and shown in  Figure   5.4  displays a combina-
tion of baseline and chain dimensioning. This drawing will communicate the impor-
tance (accuracy) of dimensions (a), (b), (c), (d), and (e). Although the dimensions with 
fewer decimal places are less important to the functionality of the part, not enough accu-
racy will create a nonfunctional part; too much accuracy will be complicated and too 
expensive to manufacture. The outer shape of this part is fully defined. However, the 
two hole features have not been identified or located.  
 The drawing shown in  Figure   5.5  is dimensioned in metric units of millimeters. 
Dimension (a) reads as follows: Four times, radius 5 mm. Slots are spaced equally 
around the part. As in ASME dimensioning rule 2, there are no trailing zeros to desig-
nate accuracy or tolerance when dimensioning in metric units.

 Solution     The block shown in  Figure   5.7 is an extrusion. The dimensions shown are designed to illustrate the 
use of baseline and ordinate dimension types in a drawing. The cross section shown in  Figure  5.8 is anchored at the 
origin shown. It also uses three types of relations: horizontal, vertical, and collinear. SolidWorks creates the hori-

zontal and vertical lines implicitly by predicting your intention as you sketch. The dimensioning scheme of the cross 
section is selected to minimize the number of reference faces (datums) and to lend itself to the baseline and ordinate 
dimension schemes we use in the drawing. The baseline dimensions are identical to those shown in  Figure  5.8 .

 HANDS-ON FOR  EXAMPLE   5.1  .   Create two 1-inch diameter through holes in the front face of the 
block. The centers of the two holes are (1.5, 2) and (3.5, 2) from the left bottom corner of the block. Use 
both baseline and ordinate dimensioning schemes to dimension them in a drawing. 
 5.7  Drawing Content and Layout 
 As we covered in  Chapter   1  , you can create a part or an assembly 
drawing.  Figures   1.21  and   1.22 show part drawings, and  Figure   1.23  C 
shows an assembly drawing. As demonstrated in these figures, draw-
ing  content includes the views, dimensions, bill of materials, and a 
title block. Typically, a drawing includes three views: front, top, and 
right. You may include the isometric view as a fourth view. Other 
views, such as sectioned views, may be added if they are needed to 
clarify the drawing.   
 In addition, a drawing may include tolerances, notes, balloons, hole 
callouts, weld symbols, surface finish symbols, surface roughness val-
ues, and a bill of materials (BOM). A BOM is usually used in assembly 
drawings. It typically shows the part number, how many instances of 
the part are used in the assembly, and what its material is. If a BOM is 
used in a part drawing, it shows the same information as the assembly 
BOM except for the number of instances. Companies may create special 
BOMs to fit their needs. 
 SolidWorks groups most of the drawing content under the  Anno-
tation tab or  Annotations menu. While in a drawing, click  Annota-
tion tab to view its icons, or  Insert (menu) >  Annotations to access all 
the possible annotations (see  Figure   5.9  ) you can add to a drawing. 
 Figure   5.9 also shows a note (the text that reads as such) and a balloon 
(the circle that points to the note). Balloons can be added to notes, as 
shown in  Figure   5.9 , or they can be used to label parts of an assembly 
and relate them to item numbers in the assembly BOM.

 5.8  Angle of Projection 
 A CAD/CAM system uses projection to generate 2D views from 3D models. The system 
does this by projecting the model onto a projection plane. SolidWorks offers two angles 
of projections: first angle and third angle. Both angles of projections produce ortho-
graphic views, but they are opposite to each other. First angle produces back, bottom, 
and left views. Third angle produces front, top, and right views. You may ask why there 
are two different sets of views. The United States and Canada use third-angle projection 
whereas Europe and other countries use first-angle projection. 
 To set the angle of projection, right-click anywhere on the drawing sheet >  Proper-
ties > Select  Third angle  (or  First angle ) >  OK . You can tell which angle of projection 
a drawing is using by displaying the hidden lines of the drawing views as shown in 
 Figure   5.10  .

 5.9  Views 
 CAD/CAM systems offer different types of views to convey a model design. SolidWorks 
offers the following types (see  Figure   5.11  ): 
  
1.  Named (orthographic) views:     These are the standard orthographic views: front, top, 
right, back, bottom, and left.  These are the views we have created so far in the 
book. 
  
2.  Section view:    This view type allows you to look at the inside of the model by 
cutting a section in it. The cut could be straight (use one section line) or stepped 
(use stepped section line). The CAD/CAM system requires you to define a direc-
tion (section line) for the sectional view. To create a section view, click  View 
Layout tab >  Section View (or  Insert menu  > Drawing view > Section) > 
Sketch a line > Move (do not drag) the mouse to where to place the section view 
and click there.  
  
3.  Projected view:    You may project an existing view in a given direction. This speeds 
up and standardizes view creation. For example, you may select a front view and 
click to the right or left of it to create a right or left view, respectively. Click  View 
Layout tab >  Projected View (or  Insert menu  > Drawing view > Projected ) > 

148
Chapter 5: Drawings
Select a view > Move the mouse in any direction (left, right, top, bottom) of the 
selected view to insert the new view.  
  
4.  Auxiliary view:     This view is similar to the projected view, but it is unfolded normal 
to a selected edge in an existing view. To create an auxiliary view, select an edge, 
then click  View Layout tab >  Auxiliary View (or  Insert menu  > Drawing view > 
Auxiliary ) > Click in the screen to place the view.  
  
5.  Detail view:     A CAD designer uses this view to zoom in to a portion of a view 
(orthographic, ISO, sectional, assembly, or another detail view) to show more 
details, usually at an enlarged scale. To create a detail view, click  View Layout tab 
>  Detail View (or  Insert menu >  Drawing view > Detail ) > Circle the desired 
portion of the drawing with the mouse > Move (do not drag) the mouse to where 
to place the detail view and click there.  
  
6.  Crop view:     You can crop any drawing view except a detail view. A crop view 
allows you to cut a piece of an existing view. The crop view deletes the view you 
crop. The creation of a crop view is a two-step process. First, you need to define a 
closed crop profile such as a circle. Second, create the crop view by clicking  View 
Layout tab >  Crop View (or  Insert > Drawing view > Crop ). 
  
7.  Broken-out section:    Using a broken-out section, you can carve/remove material 
from a region of an existing view for a given depth to show inner details. A 
closed profile, usually a spline, defines the region (broken-out section). Follow 
this sequence to create a broken-out section:  View Layout tab >  Broken-out 
Section (or  Insert > Drawing view > Broken-out Section ) > Sketch a closed 
spline > Green check mark to finish. The section will be removed from the draw-
ing view.

8.  Broken view:     A broken view makes it possible to display a drawing view in a large 
scale on a smaller size drawing sheet. The view still shows the actual dimension 
values. We usually break the view in areas where view details are not important to 
that view. To create a broken view, click  View Layout tab >  Break (or  Insert > 
Drawing view > Break ) > Select a drawing to break > Select the broken view

 Broken View panel that shows to the left > ✔. 
  
9.  Relative-to-model view:     This view allows you to create a true view of angled 
faces in a model. Consider a block with a chamfered corner that has a hole in 
its center. If you need to create a true view of the chamfer (where the 
observer is looking perpendicular at the chamfer plane), you need to create a 
relative view. The relative view requires two orthogonal faces or planes: the 
chamfer face and the front face of the block. SolidWorks creates a view of the 
chamfer face perpendicular to the front face of the block. Click this sequence: 
 Insert > Drawing view > Relative To Model > Switch to the model that is 
open or right-click in the graphics pane and open the model > Select the 
chamfer face > Select the front face > ✔ > Click to place the view in the 
desired location.   
 5.10  Sheets 
 SolidWorks uses the concept of sheets in a drawing. A drawing may consist of one or 
more sheets. The use of multiple sheets allows you to include more views in a drawing 
than what one sheet can hold, instead of creating a whole new drawing file. For exam-
ple, you may use one sheet to show the three standard orthographic and the ISO views, 
then use another sheet to show a detail view and a section view. In the case of an assem-
bly, you may use one sheet to show the standard views and one sheet to show an 
exploded view. 
 To create a new drawing, click  File > New > Drawing > OK > Select the sheet 
(drawing) size and format from the window that pops up >  OK . This opens what 
is called a  drawing template . The template consists of both the sheet itself and the 
sheet format. At the sheet level of the template, the user will find the views and all 
associated information. After the drawing template is open, the system will prompt 
you to insert views. After you insert the views, you see a node called  Sheet1 in the 
features tree shown in the left pane of the screen. You also see a tab at the bottom 
left of the screen called  Sheet1 . You can rename the sheet. To add another sheet, 
right-click in the graphics pane >  Add Sheet  from the menu that pops up, or right 
click the  Sheet1 tab at the bottom left corner of the screen >  Add Sheet . This adds 
a new sheet and displays it on the screen, ready to add content to it. SolidWorks 
creates tabs, one per sheet at the bottom of the screen. You can toggle the sheets 
by selecting a tab. A very useful feature at the sheet level is to lay out predefined 
views. Predefined views will automatically determine the orientation, display 
style, location, and scale of a view in which a part/assembly reference will be 
added later.  
 Each drawing sheet has a sheet format. Sheet format determines the size of the draw-
ing, the borders and title block, the default sheet scale, the type of view projection ( First 
or  Third Angle ), and the next letter of the alphabet to be used in view datum labels. 
These can be changed by right-clicking anywhere on the sheet in the graphics pane and 
selecting  Properties . The dialog box opens, as shown in  Figure   5.12  .  

150
Chapter 5: Drawings
 5.11  Title Block 
 A drawing has a generic title block that can also be filled and/or customized. Typically the 
title block contains  Notes that are linked to  Custom Properties . Custom Properties can 
be linked from the part/assembly level, the sheet format level, or, in the case of special 
properties, the sheet itself. You can edit the title block and customize it to your needs. To 
edit the title block, right-click a sheet in the features tree >  Edit Sheet Format  > Double 
click any box in title block to edit > When done editing, exit the edit mode by clicking 
the symbol (similar to exit sketch symbol) shown on the top right of the screen to return 
to the content of the sheet. Tutorial 5-3 offers another method to edit the title block.  
 Sheet formats have a file extension of . slddrt and can be saved. Any custom prop-
erties in the title block or changes in the sheet properties will be saved at this level. 
Sheet formats do not save views. Formats are automatically saved to  SolidWorks install 
directory\data , but can be saved anywhere. If the default location is chosen, the new 
format will appear in the  Templates window after the user clicks  File > New ; other-
wise, the user can browse to find a format.

 5.13  Tolerances 
 Tolerancing is an important concept to manufacturing. Without tolerances, modern 
production would not be possible. The ASME tolerancing rules and concepts set the 
standards for engineering practice. CAD/CAM systems use these rules and concepts 
in their tolerancing software modules, and your CAD/CAM system should help you 
follow the ASME dimensions and tolerancing rules.  Although we cover tolerances in 
full detail later in the book, here  are some basics. Tolerances are our way of dealing 
with manufacturing imperfections. We cannot produce what is known as a perfect 
form of a part. For example, we cannot create a box of size 3 × 2 × 4 inches. Manu-
facturing imperfections are due to many reasons, such as the skill level of the machin-
ist, accuracy and age of the machine tool, environmental conditions, and cutting 
conditions. 
 Designers assign tolerances to dimensions based on the functional requirements of 
the part and its assembly. A designer does not need to assign tolerances to all the dimen-
sions in a drawing, but only to the important ones. Typically, the designer may desig-
nate a general tolerance in the drawing (as a note) to indicate the value of the tolerance 
that should be applied to any dimension on the drawing that does not have a tolerance 
associated with it. Conversely, the designer may leave out the general tolerance alto-
gether, and the machinist uses his or her experience.  
 5.14  Bill of Materials 
 The bill of materials (BOM) is typically displayed as a table. This can be imported from 
an Excel file or created at the drawing level by SolidWorks. SolidWorks will automati-
cally create and populate the cells of the table with all of the information relating to a 
specific assembly. The default BOM has four columns— ITEM NO. ,  PART NUMBER , 
DESCRIPTION and  QTY. —that are each linked to properties found in the assembly 
itself. Any changes at the assembly level will affect the BOM. The user can add more col-
umns with other linked properties or replace any of the default columns with different 
information. The order of item numbers reflects the order of appearance in the assembly.  

152
Chapter 5: Drawings
 The BOM behaves much like a sheet in an Excel file. The right-click is a very power-
ful option to find many of the typical table functions such as delete column, insert row, 
and others. Also, there is an option to split the table in order to fit it according to other 
items in the drawing. The BOM created can also be saved as an Excel file and then 
modified using the Excel program.  
 5.15  Model and Drawing Associativity 
 The associativity between a model and its drawing links the changes (edits) between the 
two. If you modify the model (part), its views in a drawing are updated automatically, 
and vice versa; if you change the model item dimensions in a drawing, the part is updated 
automatically. Tutorial 5–5 shows an example. The associativity property works only for 
model item dimensions. 
 SolidWorks allows you to control this associativity. When you right-click a dimen-
sion in a sketch, you can select  Mark For Drawing  to turn on/off this property. This 
property is on by default. If you turn it off for a dimension, the dimension will not show 
as a model item in the drawing.  
 5.16  Design Checker 
 In design and drafting practice, some companies designate a special person to check 
engineering drawings; this person is known as a  design checker . Think of the checker as 
an intermediary between the design/engineering department and the manufacturing 
department. The checker typically has both design and manufacturing experience. The 
checker’s tasks are to (1) ensure that the design as documented in the drawing can be 
produced with the least manufacturing cost, (2) look for inconsistencies in the part 
dimensioning, (3) check the tolerances and make sure that manufacturing processes can 
produce them, (4) check the dimensioning scheme according to the concepts and prin-
ciples covered in this chapter, and (5) ensure that materials are specified. After the 
design checker reviews the drawing, the checker may either send it back to the design 
department for corrections, or sign off on it and send it to the manufacturing depart-
ment for processing. 
 SolidWorks provides an “electronic” design checker for design standards com-
pliance checking. For this to work, you need to capture all the tasks of the “human” 
checker and codify them in an electronic document as rules that SolidWorks can use 
to check; effectively you create a checking template with predefined design checks 
(standards) that SolidWorks uses to assess the drawing. Click  Tools > Design 
Checker >  Check Active Document  to activate it. A  Design Checker tab opens in 
the task pane to the right of the graphics pane on the screen ( View  >  Task Pane  to 
see it). Open it and follow the instructions. Close the tab when done to close 
the checker.

Tutorial 5–3:  Fill Title Block 
 A CAD designer can fill a title block of a drawing once, save the drawing as a master, 
and use it in the future by updating it. A drawing must be open in order to access the 
title block fields and fill them. 
 The title block uses a text file named  properties.txt that resides in this default loca-
tion:  C:\Program Data\SolidWorks\SolidWorks2014\lang\english . If SolidWorks 
points to another location, the dropdown list of the title block shown in Step 2 below 
will be missing. To correct this problem, click as follows:  Tools >  Options >  System 
Options  tab >  File Locations  on left >  Custom Property Files from “ Show folders

Tutorial 5–4:  Create Assembly Drawing with Bill of Materials  
 Assembly drawings, like part drawings, are very important for conveying the informa-
tion necessary to create the assembly. Assembly drawings are different from part draw-
ings in two aspects: 
 ■  When dimensioning an assembly drawing, we show only the overall dimensions of 
the assembly, not detailed dimensions of each part in the assembly. Detailed part 
dimensions can be found in part drawings.  
 ■  An assembly drawing usually has a BOM (bill of materials).

 Note: When you hover over the BOM table, you see 
a handle at top left corner (cross shown below). You 
can drag the table from the handle and position it 
where needed.

 Step 3:  Edit BOM: Double click any field under 
 DESCRIPTION column >  Keep Link > fill as shown 
 HANDS-ON FOR  TUTORIAL   5–4 .   Change the property of the balloon to show the file name of the 
part instead of the item number. 
 
Tutorial 5–5:  Use Model-Drawing Associativity 
 There are two main types of dimensions: Model Items and Reference dimensions. Model 
Items are the dimensions used in the part modeling process to create and define the 
geometry. This type of dimension can modify the geometry at the part level and also at 
the drawing level. Reference dimensions, however, are typically inserted at the drawing 
level and have no power to modify the model geometry in any way. 
 Note: A balloon uses the  ITEM NO. , not the  PART 
NUMBER.

 Assemblies  
 6.1  Introduction 
 Products are made up of components (parts) that are assembled together. We manufac-
ture the parts first, and then we assemble them. Similarly, in CAD, we create the parts 
individually and assemble them to create an assembly model. An  assembly is a collec-
tion of parts positioned and oriented correctly relative to each other. Assemblies can be 
created by assembling parts, subassemblies, or both. For example, a universal joint has 
four parts: center block, yoke, pin, and bushing. A car has many parts (such as tires and 
rims) and subassemblies (such as steering system and engine). 
 Assembly modeling is different from part modeling in multiple ways. The most dis-
tinctive differences are creating mates and the assembly tree. A  mate is a geometric 
condition between faces (or other entities) of two parts that allows you to position or 
orient them correctly in the assembly model. A part features tree lists the features of the 
part. An assembly tree lists the parts (and subassemblies) and the assembly mates. If you 
expand the  Mates node of the tree, you see all the mates you created. 
 When you create an assembly model, you need to have an assembly plan, similar to 
having a modeling plan to create a part model. Think of a CAD assembly plan along the 
lines of a real-life assembly plan. We typically begin creating an assembly model by 
opening an assembly file. From there we have two alternatives to create the assembly 
model. We either insert all the parts first, then mate two at a time; or we insert first two 
parts, assemble them, then insert one part at a time thereafter and assemble it into what 
has been already assembled. As done with manual assembly, the first part we insert is 
usually the base component onto which we assemble other components. For example, 
in a car assembly the base part is the chassis. Note that we use the terms  part and  com-
ponent  interchangeably in this chapter. We also use  assembly file and  assembly model 
interchangeably. 
 Inserting parts into an assembly model uses the concept of instance. An  instance is 
a copy of a part that is linked to the part. This linkage allows the CAD/CAM system to 
maintain the associativity between the instance and its part, much like the associativity 
between a model and its drawing , which we discussed in  Chapter   5 . If you change the 
part, its instance is updated automatically in each assembly that uses it, and vice versa; 
if you edit or modify the instance in an assembly, its part is updated automatically. You 
can use one or more instances of the same part in the same assembly. For example, we 
could use multiple instances of a bolt in a mechanical assembly. Each instance is assem-
bled correctly using the correct mates. 
 An assembly model is always under defined as shown in the window status bar. 
That is acceptable for assemblies because not all the parts of the assembly are fixed. The 
only way to get a fully defined assembly is to fix all the parts of the assembly.  
 CHAPTER

Chapter 6: Assemblies
 6.2  Assembly Mates 
 After you insert a component in the assembly model, you assemble it. Assembling it entails 
applying mates to constrain it in the assembly. The outcome of mating two components is to 
prevent them from moving relative to each other in the assembly space, thus mimicking real 
life. An assembled component must be fixed (anchored) in space unless it is free to move for 
functional requirements (e.g., a motor shaft must rotate). In general, a component needs 
three mates to lock it in space completely. There is a total of six degrees of freedom (DOF) in 
the assembly modeling space (as shown in  Figure   6.1A  ): three translations along the three 
axes ( X ,  Y , and  Z ) and three rotations around these axes. Three mates are what it takes to 
constrain the six DOF because locking one locks another. 
 SolidWorks offers three groups of mates: standard, mechanical, and advanced as 
shown in  Figure  6.1B  – 6.1D  . The important mating concepts are as follows: 
 ■  Why to mate:     We mate components to position and orient them correctly relative 
to each other in their assembly.  
 ■  What to mate:     Because any component (part) is a feature, it consists of faces, 
edges, and vertices. Thus, you mate these elements of the two components you 
want to assemble. In addition, we can mate nonfeature elements such as center-
lines, sketch planes, origins, and planes.  
 ■  How to mate:     Mating is about restricting motions of components relative to each 
other. For example, a concentric mate between a shaft and a hole eliminates two 
translational DOF and two rotational DOF. A coincident mate between two faces 
eliminates one translational DOF and two rotational DOF.  
 (B) Standard mates  
 (C) Mechanical mates  
 (D) Advanced mates 
 FIGURE 6.1 
 Types of mates 
 (A) Degrees of freedom 
 After we assemble components, we need to test them to see whether they are fully con-
strained in the 3D assembly space. Although we could use the  Move Component  menu, 
simply drag a component with the mouse and try to move or rotate it. If there is a permis-
sible DOF, the component moves or rotates. If the component is fully fixed, it will not move.  
 6.3  Bottom-Up Assembly Modeling 
 Two approaches exist to create assemblies: bottom-up or top-down. The bottom-up 
approach is more intuitive and therefore more commonly used. This is the traditional 
approach we used in  Chapter   1 , and we use it in the tutorials in this chapter. We follow 

Chapter 6: Assemblies
161
three steps to create assemblies using the bottom-up approach: (1) create the parts, (2) 
insert them into an assembly model, and (3) use mates to assemble the parts.  
 6.4  Top-Down Assembly Modeling 
 The top-down approach is also known as  in-context approach . It is preferred for concep-
tual design when a design team is trying to conceive a new product and the layout of its 
components relative to each other in the assembly. It is a first step to define the design 
intent of the product (assembly) being designed. The top-down approach is also more 
efficient to use than the bottom-up for large and complicated assemblies because it 
reduces errors within the assembly. The top-down approach uses a layout sketch (also 
known as a  skeleton or  napkin sketch ) to relate the assembly parts together. Some view the 
layout sketch as a way to claim space for the components in the assembly because it 
shows how the components are laid relative to each other. Others view it as a block 
diagram or a reference sketch of the assembly, establishing relationships and parameters 
for the parts of the assembly and their dimensions to facilitate their automatic placement 
in the assembly. 
 The top-down approach begins with a layout sketch where the designer sketches 
the skeleton of the parts. The main point about the layout sketch is that it is just that: 
a sketch that shows both the assembly layout and the main dimensions of the assem-
bly. Use the layout sketch to define the component size, shape, and location within 
the assembly; make sure that each component references the geometry in the layout 
sketch. We cannot create more than one layout sketch in the assembly. The plane of 
the layout sketch is the front plane by default, and we cannot change it. If you select 
another sketch plane (e.g., right plane) while in the layout sketch, SolidWorks will 
not permit you to create parts from the geometry you created on this sketch plane. 
You get the error message shown in  Figure   6.2 . See  Example   6.1 about how to use 
the layout sketch.  
 FIGURE 6.2 
 Error message due to violation of layout sketch plane  
 You can create and modify the assembly before and after you create components. In 
addition, you can use the layout sketch to make changes in the assembly at any time. 
The major advantage of designing an assembly using a layout sketch is that if you change 
the layout sketch (especially changing locations of components), the assembly and its 
parts are automatically updated. You can make changes quickly and in just one place. 
Another advantage to using the layout sketch is that it reduces the parent–child relation-
ships; thus parts are more robust and easier to change and edit. 
 Creating assemblies using the top-down approach requires the use of the concept 
of blocks. After you create the sketch entities in the layout sketch, you group them 
into blocks. Each block defines the sketch entities of a component (part) of the 

162
Chapter 6: Assemblies
assembly. A block behaves as a single entity. The layout sketch must be active in 
order to create and edit blocks. After defining a block, use it to make a part. We can 
save the part either within the assembly file or in its own external file. If we save it 
within the assembly file, it is referred to as a virtual component (part). Later, we can 
save virtual components in external files or delete them. The name of a virtual com-
ponent is the name of its block shown inside square brackets (indicating that it is a 
virtual component). We may edit the component name to rename it. See  Example   6.1  
for details. 
 In the early stages of design when we are still experimenting with it, we recom-
mend using virtual components because of the advantages they offer. We can easily 
rename a virtual component by changing its name in the assembly features tree (no 
need to change the name of the external file). Also, we do not clutter the assembly 
folder with many unused components. Finally, we can make an instance of a virtual 
component in one step. 
 How can we use the top-down assembly approach to manage design teams, so that 
all team members can work concurrently on their parts of the project? We can make 
parts from the blocks of the layout assembly and save these parts externally. Each team 
member works on his or her respective part. When team members open the assembly at 
any time, they see all the latest work. 
 The layout sketch method just described is used to create entire assemblies via the 
top-down approach. Another method is the in-context method. Sometimes, we may cre-
ate new parts/features (known as  in-context features ) in an existing assembly. In this case, 
the part (component) we create is mated to another existing component in the assembly, 
and the geometry for the component we build is based upon the existing component. 
Creating features in context is useful for parts whose geometry depends completely on 
other parts, for example, brackets and fixtures.  Tutorial   6–10  shows how to use this 
method. 
 Example 6.1   Create the three-part assembly shown in  Figure  6.3 using the top-down assembly approach. 
All dimensions are in inches. 
 Solution     We create the assembly in three steps: (1) create a layout sketch, and make blocks from the 
sketch, (2) make parts from the blocks, and (3) create the parts. The details of these steps are shown below. 
The concept of blocks enables us to separate the layout sketch entities into buckets (blocks); each one defines a 
sketch for a part. 
 You need to use the following strategy when you create the layout sketch. Create the cross section of each com-
ponent of the assembly as you would if you were to create it individually as a part. That sketch would be the front 
cross section of the part. If the component has features that require other sketch planes, you would create them in 
the component’s individual external part file. If you attempt to create them while the layout sketch is active, you get 
the error message shown in  Figure  6.2 . 
 There are some important concepts about a layout sketch that you need to know: 
 ■  Sketching in the layout sketch applies the  On Plane relation automatically to each entity. Otherwise, the enti-
ties are displayed in gray color and are not accessible to dimension. Click an entity and observe the  On Plane 
relation under the  Add Relations section in the left pane.  
 ■  The layout sketch symbol is shown at the top of the tree next to the assembly name as shown in  Figure  6.3  A. 
If you close the layout sketch and need to edit it later, right click that symbol >  Layout from the popup 
menu. Also, notice that there is no  Delete in that popup menu. If we have a need to delete layout entities, we 
must open it first (right click it >  Layout ) then delete.  
 ■  There is one and only one layout sketch in any top-down assembly model (file).  
 ■  Select the sketch layout units before beginning sketching:  Tools >  Options >  Document Properties tab > 
 Units > select an option under  Unit system >  OK.

 Note:  Click the  Layout icon to open or close the 
layout sketch.  
 Step 3:  Make a block from entities created in Step 2: 
 Make Block on  Layout tab > select the rectangle 
 
(including its diagonals) and circle created in Step 2 > 
✔. This creates  Block1-1 in assembly tree.  
 
 Notes: 
(1) You must select the two diagonal lines because 
they are part of the center rectangle definition. If 
you do not select them, the layout sketch becomes 
over defined and SolidWorks cannot interpret it. 
 (2) After you make the block, the dimensions disap-
pear from the sketch because they are now part of 
the block definition. To see and/or edit them, you 
must edit the block. 
 (3) When you edit the block (right click it >  Edit 
Block ), you are in the block mode. You must exit 
this mode (as you exit a sketch). To delete the 
block, right click it >  Delete from the popup 
menu. If you delete the block, the block together 
with all its entities are deleted. Use  Explode Block 
to release its entities, but yet delete it. 
 (4) When you make a block, its entities are displayed 
faded in a gray color to help separate them from 
entities that do not belong to a block yet.

 Notes: 
(1)  Block1-1 disappears from the features tree and a 
virtual component appears in the tree. If you 
expand the component node, you see  Block1-1 as a 
child of  Sketch1 of the component as shown here.  
 
 
 (2)  Block1-1 defines the component (part) sketch. 
Note that the part name resembles the block name 
and is shown inside square brackets to indicate 
that it is a virtual part. At this point, you do not 
see any difference in the visual appearance of the 
assembly on the screen. 
 (3) Click the virtual part node in the features tree to 
invoke its context toolbar shown here. Hover over 
each item of the menu and investigate it to learn more. 
The first icon ( Open Part ) of the menu enables you to 
open the part and create it. When you open the part, 
you see a sketch of it that you use to create the part.  
 
 
 (4) Right click the part node in the features tree and 
investigate the items of the popup menu. The  Save 
Part (in External File ) does just that. It converts 
the virtual part into a real part.  

Chapter 6: Assemblies
165
 HANDS-ON FOR  EXAMPLE   6.1  .   Add a 1.0 × 1.0 × 0.5 inch extrusion with 0.5 inch 
hole to the assembly, as shown. 
 Hint:    Can you create the part in the layout sketch? If you cannot, create the part 
separately, and then use the bottom-up approach to assemble it.  
 
 6.5  Assembly Tree 
 Like a part model, an assembly model has an assembly tree. SolidWorks calls it  Features-
Manager Design Tree , the same name as for individual parts. We call it  assembly tree . An 
assembly tree is different from a features tree in two ways.  First , the nodes of an assembly 
tree are parts/subassemblies and mates. There are as many part nodes in the tree as there 
are assembly parts (instances). However, there is only one  Mates node. Each parts node 
shows a symbol to the left of its name indicating whether it is fixed in space (f) or floating 
(-). To change a part’s state in the assembly, right click it and select  Fix or  Float. Typi-
cally, we have one (f) node in the assembly, indicating that the corresponding part is the 
base.  Second , we cannot roll back an assembly tree. We can suppress parts in the assem-
bly if needed. Right click a part >  Suppress from the menu that appears. 
 Step 9:  Make extruded parts from  Block2-1 and 
 Block3-1 : Repeat Step 8. 
 Step 10:  Create big block part: Virtual part  Block1-1 
node from the assembly features tree >  Open Part 
(from context toolbar that pops up) > select  Sketch1 
from part features tree >  Extruded Boss/Base on 
 Features tab > reverse the extrusion direction > enter 
0.75 for distance  D1 > ✔ >  File >  Save >  File >  Close 
>  Yes to update the assembly. 
 
You do not see a file name unless you save it 
externally as discussed in Step 8. 
 (2) When you return to the assembly file (still open), 
you see the newly created big block part. Change 
the view to ISO for a better view (shown here). As 
shown, the other blocks are visible and will be 
used to create the other parts.  
 Step 11:  Create small block and shaft parts: Repeat 
Step 10. Use 0.75 extrusion distance  D1 for small block 
and 2.0 for shaft. Use  Mid Plane extrusion for shaft.  
 
 Notes: 
(1) You have created the big block virtual part. When 
you save it, you save it inside the assembly file. 
 Note: Do not reverse extrusion direct for small block; 
otherwise, big block swallows small block. The final 
three-part assembly is shown here.  

166
Chapter 6: Assemblies
 The top node (root) is the assembly model under which the other nodes come. Each 
part node has leaves, which are the part mates and features. The tree shows the steps 
(history) of inserting parts into the assembly. The tree also shows the steps (history) of 
creating mates in the assembly. 
 If we right-click any assembly tree node, we can perform useful functions. We can 
delete a part or mate by right-clicking its node in the tree >  Delete  from the popup. 
Investigate the many possibilities of using the assembly tree. Here are some more 
thoughts on how to use the tree: 
  1.  Expand or collapse nodes to have access to or hide sketches of features. A node 
that is collapsible has a “+” (collapsed state) or “–” (expanded state) symbol.  
  2.  Rename instance nodes. This is not as useful as in parts trees. SolidWorks appends 
the new name to the part name because it must maintain the relationship between the 
parent part and its instance in the assembly.  
  3.  Rearrange its nodes: drag a node and move it up or down the tree in case you want 
to change the order of inserting parts.  
  4.  Suppress a node: you can hide (suppress) a part (node) without having to delete it 
and re-insert and mate it again. This could be useful in debugging assemblies. Sup-
pressed nodes are displayed gray in the assembly tree. To suppress a node: click it in 
the tree >  Suppress from the context toolbar (hover over until you read it). To unsup-
press it, click it again >  Unsuppress from context toolbar.  
 6.6  Assembly Drawing 
 Assembly drawings are similar to part drawings in content. However, there are some 
differences. Assembly drawings use BOMs and balloons to fully document the assembly. 
When we dimension a drawing, we show the overall dimensions instead of every dimen-
sion (which we can access from a part drawing).  Consult  Chapter   1  on creating an 
assembly drawing. 
 6.7  Assembly Exploded View and Animation 
 An exploded view of an assembly is a view in which the components of the assembly are 
moved along the axes of the assembly modeling space. We usually explode the ISO 
view. SolidWorks creates display states for the assembly. You can show the assembly 
ISO view in a collapsed state where all the components are in assembled positions or in 
an exploded state where components are shown in moved positions. SolidWorks shows 
the exploded view in its  ConfigurationManager tab in the left pane; hover over it to 
display its name. 
 After we create the exploded view, we can animate it  as shown in  Chapter   1 tutorials . 
The animation basically displays the creation steps of the exploded view in a continuous 
(animation) fashion on the screen. SolidWorks provides the  Animation Controller win-
dow to help control the animation while it is running.  Consult  Chapter   1 tutorials.  
 Chapter   1 tutorials cover  the basics of creating an assembly exploded view, and we 
 extend this coverage  here by discussing  more on  assembly configurations. An assembly 
configuration holds an assembly state. For example, we can define different settings 
(such as hide/show, display mode, color, texture, transparency, etc.) for assembly com-
ponents and save them in different display states (configurations). 
 We can create new configurations or edit existing ones. Click this sequence to create 
one:  ConfigurationManager tab > Right-click anywhere in the tab pane and select  Add 

Chapter 6: Assemblies
167
Configuration . To edit an existing configuration of an exploded view, edit its compo-
nents one at a time. Click this sequence to edit a component: Right-click the  Exploded 
Step x (x is the step number) node of the component from the  ConfigurationManager 
tab >  Edit Feature . 
 6.8  Assembly Motion Study 
 Assembly motion study enables us to check the assembly motion. SolidWorks provides 
two types of motion for an assembly: Animation and Basic Motion. Animation is a 
motion driven by key points and constrained by assembly mates. Basic Motion is a more 
realistic simulation using assembly mates, springs, gravity, and motors. We cover the 
Animation method in this chapter. 
 When we open an assembly file, there is a default  Motion Study 1  tab shown in the 
bottom left corner of the screen, as shown in  Figure   6.4  . The tab shows the two types of 
motion. If you need more motion studies, right click  Motion Study 1  tab > Create  New 
Motion Study . We can delete the motion tabs we create (Right click any tab >  Delete 
from the popup menu), but we cannot delete the default Motion Study 1 tab (although 
we can rename it; double click it or right click it).  
 FIGURE 6.4 
 Assembly motion study  
 We create motion study–specific mates to perform a motion study. The motion 
study–specific mates are different from and independent of the assembly model mates 
that we use to assemble components in the assembly. We can easily see that the motion 
study–specific mates are different from the assembly mates by viewing the  Mates node 
in the assembly tree in the assembly model. Using motion study–specific mates allows 
us to create multiple motion studies to analyze the assembly motion with different mates 
without changing the assembly model. 
 The motion study–specific mates allow us to restrict motion between components 
for motion studies. For example, we can create distance and angle mates, and change 
their values in an animation.  
 6.9  Interference and Collision Detection 
 Interference and collision detections help check whether assemblies are created correctly 
and whether the dimensions of their parts are correct relative to each other. Interference 
checks whether the parts overlap each other (static interference), whereas collision checks 

168
Chapter 6: Assemblies
whether parts collide while they move (dynamic interference). Thus, interference ana-
lyzes static (still) parts, whereas collision analyzes dynamic (moving) parts. 
 We use interference detection to find static interference between assembly compo-
nents. This detection option takes a list of components and finds interferences between 
them. It shows graphically the paired components with their interference (overlapping) 
regions shaded in a designated color, usually red. We may also change the display set-
tings of interfering and noninterfering components to see the interference better. We 
may also select to ignore intentional interferences such as press fits and threads. We can 
choose to distinguish between coincidence (from coincidence mate) and true interfer-
ences. Correcting interferences could be achieved by changing the dimensions of the 
interfering components or by filleting or chamfering some of their edges. 
 We use collision detection to check when faces of components clash or collide dur-
ing motion. If they do, we hear an audible sound, and the components stop moving, 
thus preventing parts from penetrating each other. We move the parts with a mouse by 
dragging them. We have the options of stopping the motion upon collision, highlighting 
the colliding faces, and generating a system sound.  
 6.10  Assembly Design Tables 
 Design tables are used in assemblies in a similar fashion to their use in parts. A  design 
table is an Excel spreadsheet that is used to create multiple configurations in a part or 
assembly. We can use design tables to control configurations of parts, mates, as well as 
distance and angle relationships between parts. Follow these steps to deal with design 
tables: create them, modify them, and test them.  
 6.11  Tutorials 
 The theme for the tutorials in this chapter is to practice creating and using assemblies. 
Some tutorials use off-the-shelf components to mimic what CAD designers do in prac-
tice. We use Web resources to download the parts we need for each tutorial. 
 
Tutorial 6–1:  Create Cam and Follower Assembly 
 We create an assembly that uses the Pin Block assembly  from  Tutorial   3–4  in  Chapter   3 
to follow a cam created in this tutorial. Using the Pin Block assembly illustrates the con-
cept of using subassemblies in an assembly, a common practice in industry. The cam 
must be extruded from a fully closed loop consisting of tangent arcs (or splines).  Figure 
 6.5 shows the assembly and the cam. All dimensions are in inches.

tab >  3 Point Arc on 
 Sketch tab > sketch top 
and bottom arcs as shown 
>  Line on  Sketch tab >

 Step 2:  Create assembly: 
 File > New > Assembly >

left pane of screen) > locate 
cam file and double click it 
to insert it > locate Pin Block 
assembly file and double 
click it to insert >  File > 
 Save As >  tutorial6.1 >  Save. 
 Note: Float both components to permit all DOF.  
 Step 3:  Assemble cam:  View > Temporary axes (to 
show cam axes of its two arcs as we need them) > 
 Mate on  Assembly tab >  Coincident mate between 
the cam front plane and the assembly front plane 
(expand assembly tree and select from it) >  Coinci-
dent mate again between the assembly origin and the 
axis of the larger end (arc) of cam (expand assembly 
tree and select from it). 
 Note: Select the cam axis at about its midpoint to place 
assembly origin there.  
 Step 4:  Assemble pin block subassembly: >  Mate on 
 Assembly tab >  Coincident mate between the axis of 
 
 
the hole in the block and the origin of the assembly > 
 Coincident mate between the top plane of the Pin 
Block assembly and the front plane of the cam.  
 Step 5:  Make 
subassembly 
flexible: Click pin 
block node in 
assembly tree > 
 ComponentProp-
erties from context 
toolbar that opens as 
shown > select  Flexible 
as shown >  OK. 
 Note: Making sub-
assembly flexible breaks it up into its individual 
components, allowing us to move the pin independent 
of the block. This makes the pin (follower) follow cam 
profile during cam rotation.  
 Step 6:  Use 
cam mate 
between cam 
and follower: 
 Mate on the 
 Assembly

 Mechanical 
Mates > 
Cam > 
Right-click 
one of cam 
side faces > 
 Select Tangency . This will automatically select all cam 
side faces and fill in the top box as shown > click the  Cam 
follower box > select the bottom of the pin as shown.  
 Step 7:  Test the cam follower motion: Drag the cam 
with the mouse and rotate it. Notice that the follower 
oscillates as the cam rotates.  
 
 
 
 HANDS-ON FOR  TUTORIAL   6–1 .   Create a second configuration of the cam 
that has two lobes that are 180° out of phase from each other as shown. Test the 
cam in the assembly by dragging and rotating it. The follower must follow the cam 
profile. Note: Create an axis (centerline) at the center point of the new cam and 
mate it with the assembly origin to allow the cam to rotate correctly a full 360 
 degrees.

Tutorial 6–2:  Create Working Hinge Assembly 
 Create a working hinge that opens and closes with limits to simulate real life.  Figure   6.6  
shows the assembly. The hinge mate we use in this tutorial is equivalent to using a con-
centric mate and a coincident mate. The advantage, however, of using this mechanical 
mate is that it attaches limits to the travel of the hinge as well as using only one mate as 
opposed to two.

 Step 4:  Set the limits of the hinge mate: Check off 
 Specify angle limits > select the two internal flat faces 
of the two hinge instances as shown > enter 90° for 
angle limit as shown. 
 
 
 Note:  The first value, 45°, is the current opening 
shown. The second value, 90°, is the maximum open-
ing. The third value, 0°, is the minimum opening.  
 Step 5:  Test the hinge motion:   Drag the unfixed plate 
of the hinge with the mouse and rotate it. Observe that 
the hinge obeys the angle limits set in Step 4.  
 HANDS-ON FOR  TUTORIAL   6–2 .   Create and assemble the hinge pin, and change the limits of the hinge 
to allow a range of motion of zero to 270°. 
 
Tutorial 6–3:  Mate Two Gears with Gear Mate 
 The gear mate can be used to mate any circular shapes such that they will rotate relative 
to one another. For this tutorial, a gear is downloaded from the Boston Gear website 
and used in an assembly. However, the gear mate does not require teeth to use it. We 
use a gear mate to relate the rotational ratio of two downloaded gears.  Figure   6.7  shows 
the assembly. The gears must spin in the correct direction and with the correct ratio so 
as to simulate real life. 
 The necessary parts for this tutorial will be downloaded from the Boston Gear 
website (Courtesy of Boston Gear LLC, a subsidiary of Altra Industrial Motion, Inc.). 
The necessary mates will be added to the assembly to create a functional relationship 
between the gears.

Plane > Centerline on  Sketch tab > 
click origin and sketch and dimension 
a horizontal line as shown > exit sketch >  File > Save

 Note: For simplicity, we will place the gears at the 
endpoints of the line, thus avoiding creating shafts to 
mount the gears on.

 Step 3:  Insert the gear instances:  Insert Component 
on Assembly tab >  Browse (button on left pane of 
screen) > locate the gear part file and double click it to 
insert two instances of it.  
 Note:  If you open the downloaded gear, SolidWorks 
asks you if you would like to recognize its features. Ignore 
it (select  No ) unless you plan to edit the gear. In such a 
case, the gear part has only one node named  Imported1 in 
the assembly tree. Expand the nodes of the two gear 
instances in the assembly tree to observe this fact.  
 Step 4:  Assemble the gears:  Mate on  Assembly tab > 
 Coincident > front plane of assembly > front face of 
 
 
one gear 
instance > 
 Concentric > 
hole face of 
one gear 
instance > one 
endpoint of 
centerline > 
repeat to mate other gear instance > ✔. 
 Note:  SolidWorks does not use the teeth to mesh the 
gears. Thus you need to align the teeth manually 
before creating the gear mate to properly visualize the 
gear meshing.  
 Step 5:  Create the gear mate:  Mates on  Assembly tab 
 > Mechanical Mates > Gear > select the faces of the 
holes of the two gear instances > ✔. 
 
 
 Note:  SolidWorks creates the gear ratio automatically 
based on the diameters of the gears.  
 Step 6:  Test the gear motion:   Drag the face of one of 
the gears with the mouse and rotate it. If the rotations 
of the gears are opposite to each other, edit the gear 
mate (expand  Mates node > click  GearMate1 >  Edit 
Feature from context toolbar) and click  Reverse 
checkbox shown.  
 HANDS-ON FOR  TUTORIAL   6–3 .   Change the gear ratio from 0.38:0.38 to 1.00:0.38. Do the teeth 
mesh correctly when you rotate the gears with the mouse? 
 
Tutorial 6–4:  Create Functional Rack and Pinion 
 We use a rack and pinion mate to relate the rotation of a spur gear to the travel on a lin-
ear gear rack.  Figure   6.8  shows the assembly. The rack pinion mate can be used to mate 
any cylindrical face to any linear face such that they move relative to one another. They 

Chapter 6: Assemblies
173
do not need teeth for a mate. The necessary parts for this tutorial are downloaded from 
the Boston Gear website (Courtesy of Boston Gear LLC, a subsidiary of Altra Industrial 
Motion, Inc.). The necessary mates are added to the assembly to create a functional re-
lationship between the rack and pinion. The spur gear (pinion) must spin in the correct 
direction to relate to the travel of the rack gear (rack) so as to simulate real life. 
 The downloaded rack is long and has only two teeth. When we open its file, we 
do not use features recognition, so we import it as one body resulting in one node, 
 Imported1 , in the features tree. We shorten the rack length and create one additional 
tooth, and pattern it to create a functional rack.

tion: Rotate the pinion with 
mouse until it looks like the 
teeth are correctly meshed 
as shown. The teeth of the 
gear have no impact on 
how the parts behave 
relative to each other in the 
assembly. Therefore, we 
manually set the pinion for visual demonstration only.

 HANDS-ON FOR  TUTORIAL   6–4 .   If you observe this rack and pinion system, you will notice that the 
teeth do not mesh correctly while moving the parts with the mouse. Why do they not mesh correctly? Cor-
rect the pinion pitch diameter ( Rack travel/revolution shown in Step 9) such that the teeth mesh correctly. 
 Hint: Visit the website to find the correct pitch diameter value.

Tutorial 6–5:  Create a Functional Ball Screw 
 We use a screw mate to relate a rotating shaft (ball screw) to the transverse travel of a bear-
ing. The screw mate can be used to relate the linear travel of a bearing or a nut to the rotation 
of a ball screw. This tutorial shows how to use the screw mate. First, we create the parts. 
 The wheel has been created in  Tutorial   3-3  . Second, we add the necessary assembly mates to 
create a functional relationship between the ball screw and the nut. The bearing must travel 
away from the handle as it is rotated counterclockwise.  Figure   6.9  shows the assembly.

rotating the hand wheel. 
 
Tutorial 6–6:  Study Universal Joint Motion 
 We create an assembly that will simulate a real-life interaction of a universal joint and 
spline assembly. A universal joint is used to transmit torque between two shafts that 
are not aligned. Here the universal joint is downloaded along with the spline from 3D 
ContentCentral. The universal joint and spline are inserted into an assembly and, using 
the correct mates and reference planes, we demonstrate a working universal joint. Using 
a system of reference planes and mates, the universal joint will rotate along with the 
splines as in real life.  Figure   6.10  shows the universal joint assembly.

ing claw’s front plane > repeat for the other side.  
 
 
 
 Step 12:  Test assembly: Drag either of the splines 
with mouse to make them rotate, and watch the 
behavior of the U-joint as it rotates.  
 HANDS-ON FOR  TUTORIAL   6–6 .   Create a motion study for the U-joint. 
 Hint: Follow the steps from  Tutorial  6–7 . 
 
Tutorial 6–7:  Create Motion Study 
 We use the Cam assembly created in  Tutorial   6–1 to create an animation motion 
study. An animation motion study is a visual demonstration of how an assembly 
moves. We use the mates of the assembly to restrict movements of parts in the as-
sembly. The  Motion Manager  is a timeline interface from which we can use one of 
two types of studies: animation and basic motion.  Figure  6.11 shows the motion 
timeline.  
Hover over the icons
on this bar to learn
more by trying them.

 Step 1:  Open  Tutorial   6–1 
cam assembly and prepare it 
for animation:  File > Open 
> locate the assembly > 
 Open > drag the cam until it 
is orientated vertically as 
shown. 
 
 Step 2:  Open the 
 Motion Study tab: 
Open the  Motion 
Manager by clicking 
on the  Motion 
Study 1 tab at lower 
left of screen as 
shown. 
 Step 3:  Set the 
timeline at the first 
point: With the cam 
vertical, drag the 
timeline to 2 seconds 
as shown. 
 Note: You can 
create multiple 
motion studies. Right 
click the  Motion Study 1 tab >  Create New Motion 
Study from the menu that pops up. You can delete 
any tabs you create but you cannot delete the  Motion 
Study 1 tab.  
 Step 4:  Set cam for 2-second anima-
tion key: Drag the cam in a clockwise 
direction until it is horizontal (90° 
degree position) as shown.  
 Note: The timeline records the motion 
of the cam and follower. SolidWorks 
will insert what is called a  key  (dia-
mond shape) after each motion drag is 
recorded. Right click any key to delete 
it if needed.  
 
 
 Step 5:  Set cam for 4-, 6-, and 8-second animation 
keys: Repeat Steps 3 and 4 for the 4-, 6-, and 8-second 
keys, each time moving the key line by 2 seconds and 
turning the cam 90° from its current position.  
 Step 6:  Calculate cam motion: Click the  Calculate 
icon shown here to play the animation just recorded.  
 
 
 Step 7:  Watch the playback: Click the  Play icon to 
review the animation. If you need to make corrections 
or delete the animation, right click any key and delete 
as discussed in Step 4.  
 
 
 Step 8:  Save the motion study (animation): Click the 
 Save icon > accept default name (camAssem.avi) > 
 Save >  OK. 
 Note: The animation file is an external file that can be 
played back anytime independent of the assembly file 
being open or not. You also need an  avi player ( Win-
dows Media Player ), which the Windows OS pro-
vides. To play the file, simply double click it.

Tutorial 6–8:  Detect Collision and Interference 
 The interference and collision detection tools can be very useful in analyzing an assem-
bly. This tutorial makes use of the hinge created in  Tutorial   6–2  to demonstrate these 
tools.  Figure  6.12 shows the hinge assembly to test.  
 HANDS-ON FOR  TUTORIAL   6–7 .   Create a second motion study that will rotate the cam in the opposite 
direction twice as fast. 
 Hint: Use a time interval of 1 second instead of 2 to span the 90° interval. 
 Step 1: 
 Open 
 Tutorial 
 6–1 hinge 
assembly 
and 
suppress 
hinge mate:  File > Open > locate the assembly >  Open 
> expand  Mates node on assembly > click hinge mate 
>  Suppress from the context toolbar that shows up 
(hover over icons until you read it as shown).  
 Note: The hinge mate has built-in limits of travel. For 
this tutorial the limits of travel will be a collision 
between the parts.  
 Step 2:  Remate the parts:  Mates on the  Assembly tab 
>  Concentric > click cylindrical faces of both hinge 
instances > ✔ >  Coincident > click the flat faces that 
butt each other > ✔. 
 Step 3:  Detect collision:  Move Component on

plate until it 
cannot move 
as shown.  
 Note:  
SolidWorks 
will detect the 
collision of 
the two hinge plates and prevent the parts from moving 
any farther as well as sound a tone and highlight the faces 
in collision.  
 Step 4:  Check interference:  Interference Detection 
on  Evaluate tab  > Calculate button shown > review 
results (no interference is detected).  
 
 

Chapter 6: Assemblies
181
 Step 5:  Rotate hinge parts and recheck for interfer-
ences: Rotate the parts such that they are meshed 
together as shown > repeat Step 4 to recalculate > 
review results (interference is detected) as shown.  
 
 HANDS-ON FOR  TUTORIAL   6–8 .   Create a pin that connects the two hinge plates. Assemble the pin 
into the hinge assembly. Increase the diameter of the pin by 10% purposely above the hinge hole diameter, 
and check the collision and the interference of the assembly. 
 
Tutorial 6–9:  Create Design Table 
 A design table is an Excel sheet. A design table in an assembly can be used to control 
the suppression or configuration of parts, mates, and assembly features and also the nu-
meric distance or angle relationships between parts. We create and set up a design table 
such that the configurations control the location of the pin in the Pin Block assembly  of 
 Tutorial   3–4 in  Chapter   3 . We assign a variable and value to each configuration in the 
design table.  Figure  6.13  shows the three resulting configurations.

Chapter 6: Assemblies
 Step 1:  Open   Tutorial   3–4 Pin Block assembly and 
convert the coincident mate to a distance mate:  File > 
Open > locate the assembly >  Open > convert the 
 Coincident mate between the  Front Plane of the pin 
and the  Front Plane of the assembly to a  Distance 
mate as follows: click the mate in the assembly tree > 
 Edit Feature from  context toolbar that pops up > 
select the  Distance mate as shown > right click each 
top plane shown under  Mate Selections , delete, and 
replace them by the assembly  Front Plane and the pin 
 Front Plane (expand the trees to access them) > leave 
the distance value at 0.0 > ✔. 
 Note: The  ConfigurationManager has been popu-
lated by the configurations named “2” and “3” as 
shown. The default configuration has 0 value for  D1. 
 Step 4:  Create the design table:  Insert > Tables > 
Design Table (use the default  Auto-create ) > ✔. 
 Note:  This automatically populates the Excel work-
sheet with the three configurations. The first column is 
the name of the configurations. The second column is 
the description of each configuration as shown.  
 
 Step 2:  Configure the distance mate: Right click the 
 Distance mate in the assembly tree >  Configure 
feature . This opens up a design table (Excel sheet) 
shown in Step 3. 
 Step 3:  Add configurations: Add  Configuration 2 by 
clicking in the cell that reads  Creates a new  
 configuration > enter 2 for  Configuration Name > 
enter 3.00 for  D1 > > repeat to create  Configuration 3 
with  D1 of 5 >  OK. 
 
 
 
 Step 5:  Edit the design table: While the design table 
is open from Step 4, click assembly tree tab > expand 
 Mates node  > click  Distance1 mate to show dimen-
sion value in graphics pane  > double click the value 
(should be 0.0) to add  D1 and its current value to 
design table as shown > click  D1 cells for other 
configurations and enter 3 and 5 for  D1 as shown > 
click anywhere on graphics pane away from table to 
close and save it.  
 

Chapter 6: Assemblies
183
 Step 6:  Test the design table:  ConfigurationManager 
tab > double click any configuration (Default, 2, or 3) 
shown > observe the position of the pin as shown to 
the left.  
 Note: The active configuration is shown in  Configu-
rationManager pane with ✔. 
 
 HANDS-ON FOR  TUTORIAL   6–9 .   Add a “4” configuration such that the distance mate is suppressed.
 Hint: Right click  Distance1 mate in  Mates node in assembly tree >  Configure Feature  from the menu 
that pops up > add configuration “4” with distance of 7 in. > check off the  Suppress  checkbox >  OK . 
Double click configuration “4”, and drag the pin with the mouse to move it. It will move, therefore not 
obeying the distance of the 7 inch requirement because the mate is suppressed. Try moving the pin in the 
other configurations. Suppressing a mate may be useful in answering “what if” design questions. 
 
Tutorial 6–10:  Create Part in Context of Assembly 
 We create a part in the context of an assembly such that the part’s dimensions reference 
other parts and assembly features.  Figure   6.14  shows the assembly with the part in con-
text (cross bar). Creating a part in the context of an assembly can be useful when the size 
of the part is completely dependent on other parts or assembly features. The part (cross 
bar) created in context must always contact the two blocks to act as a bracket. First, three 
parts are created and then inserted into an assembly. Second, a part is created in the 
context of the assembly that references the sizes and locations of the original three parts.

 Note: The new part exists as a node in the assembly 
tree (look for it). Expand it. The part has no geometry, 
but its sketch planes exist and are automatically 
aligned with the planes of the assembly.  
 Step 7:  Create cross bar sketch and feature: Click the

 Note: 
(1) Do not use  Save As 
 (2) You cannot name the part yourself. Its name 
becomes Partxx^assemblyName 
( Part1^Tutorial6.10 for this tutorial). But you can 
rename the features tree nodes.  
 (3) A context symbol (->) is attached to part tree 
nodes as shown. 
 (4) Assembly tree shows the cross bar part as a new 
node. 
 (5) Saving the cross bar part in context of assembly 
does not create a new file for the part. If you 
wish to do so, follow Step 7 >  File > Save As > 
Yes to break the link between context part and 
assembly.  
 Step 10:  Edit assembly: Click 
part node >  Open Part from

 Note: Observe that the cross bar length increases to 
maintain sketch relations as shown.  
 
 
 HANDS-ON FOR  TUTORIAL   6–10 .   Edit the shaft diameter such that it references the diameter of the 
hole in the  BigBlock part. Also edit the hole in  SmallBlock such that it references the shaft diameter. Then 
change the diameter of the hole in the block to 1.0 in. 
 Note:  You will have to delete the 0.25 in. dimension in the cross section sketch of the shaft.

 Rendering and Animation 
 
 7.1  Introduction 
 Visualization has long been recognized as an effective tool of communication, and more 
so for engineering. CAD/CAM software offers very rich menus for visualization, includ-
ing 3D views, hidden line removal, wireframe, and shaded views. Click the  Display 
Style icon of the Heads-up View toolbar at the top of the graphics pane on the screen 
to experience these styles. Engineering visualization tools include rendering, photo real-
ism, and prototyping. We cover rendering in this chapter  and prototyping later in the 
book . Rendered photos are used both for sales and marketing (sales brochures) and for 
conveying design ideas to teams. 
 Rendering generates realistic images, almost like photographic scenes taken with a 
digital camera. We can render the screen graphics back onto the graphics pane of Solid-
Works, to a printer, or to a file. To increase its rendering speed, CAD/CAM software uses 
the graphics card of the computer to support real-time rendering, so as we rotate or 
move a CAD model on the screen, it is rendered quickly. 
 Creating scenes is a trial-and-error process because you want to evaluate various 
effects on the scene until you find the best rendering. One major issue that is detrimen-
tal to rendering time and image size is the rendering resolution, which is much like 
graphics resolution. The higher the resolution, the more time the image takes to render 
and the larger its size is. The resolution is known as the  anti-aliasing effect . Aliasing is the 
jaggedness (known as  staircase effect ) of the model edges due to the screen pixels. Higher 
anti-aliasing produces high-quality images, but it takes a long time to compute (render) 
the scene. 
 Rendering is a complex topic. We need to understand rendering models, how to 
create a scene, what texture to use, and what types of lights are available and their effect. 
Without such understanding, rendering remains a mystery and the use of rendering 
software becomes inefficient. SolidWorks has  PhotoView 360 as an  Add-Ins . The tuto-
rials cover how to use it effectively. 
 7.2  Scenes and Lighting 
 Digital rendering uses a rendering scene and a rendering model. The rendering scene 
describes the lighting environment including the types of lights in the scene.  Figure  7.1 
shows the elements of a scene, which includes the CAD model to render and the lights. 
SolidWorks uses a room with four walls to define the boundaries of its scene. These are the 
top (ceiling), the bottom (floor), the left wall, and the right wall. The CAD model includes 
its material and texture. We can assign a texture map to a model. The scene may have one 
type or multiple types of lights. The outcome of the rendering process is a rendered model. 
 CHAPTER

Chapter 7: Rendering and Animation
 SolidWorks offers different types of lights. You can turn any or all of the following 
lights on or off for a given scene: 
  
1.  Ambient light:    This illuminates the model evenly from all directions. Ambient light 
has intensity and color that you can modify. You cannot delete or add additional 
ambient lights.  
  
2.  Directional light:   This light is placed at infinity from the scene. Thus, it shines 
parallel rays from a given direction onto the CAD model. You can modify the 
intensity, color, and position of this light. The directional light simulates sunlight.  
  
3.  Point light:    This is a concentrated light that comes from a source located at a 
specific location in the model space. This light source emits light in all directions. 
You can modify the intensity, color, and position of this light.  
  
4.  Spot light:    Think of this as a beamed light source. The light comes from a restricted, 
focused light with a cone-shaped beam that is brightest at its center. You can shoot 
(aim) the spot light at a specific area of the model. You can modify the intensity, 
color, and position of the light source. You can also adjust the angle through 
which the beam spreads.  
  
5.  Fog light:    This simulates scattering of the light by fog. It enables the effect of a fog 
light. You can specify fog lights in point or spot light. You can control the light 
intensity, which controls the brightness of the fog light effect.  
 7.3  Rendering Models 
 Rendering is a digital method to simulate how CAD models respond to different types 
of lighting around them. The response depends on the types of existing lights in the 
model scene (environment) and the type of the model material. The model material 
affects how the model reflects the lights that are shined on its surfaces. The goal of ren-
dering is to display a CAD model on the screen as it would look in real life.

Chapter 7: Rendering and Animation
203
 We use rendering models to render scenes after we create 
them.  Figure   7.2 shows a typical rendering model. The light reflec-
tion occurs with respect to the surface normal vector at the point of 
contact between the surface and the light ray. The angles  i and  r  
are, respectively, the angle of incidence and the angle of reflection. 
A light source in the scene sends light rays to the CAD model sur-
faces (faces). When a light ray hits a surface, it is reflected off it. If 
the light is reflected evenly in one direction ( Figure  7.3 A, i.e.,  i = 
 r ), we have a shiny surface (known as a  specular surface ) like a mir-
ror. If the light is reflected unevenly in many directions ( Figure 
 7.3 B, i.e.,  i Z  r ), we have a dull surface (known as a  diffuse sur-
face ) like wood and paper. The scene camera (viewer’s eye) receives 
the reflected rays from any direction that is not necessarily coinci-
dent with the reflected rays. All these angles, scene lights, and var-
iables are used to calculate the rendered image. These calculations 
are beyond the scope of this  book and are not covered here.

 The computational algorithm that performs these calculations is known as  ray trac-
ing  and is not covered here. The algorithm requires intensive memory and computa-
tions. It is even more expensive if it uses anti-aliasing techniques to increase the quality 
of the rendered scene. 
 Caustic effects are the result of combined reflective and diffuse reflections. These 
effects result from interactions between different objects in the scene or from cascading 
reflections from surfaces of one object in the scene. For example, a light emitted from a 
light source goes through one or more specular and/or diffuse reflections before reach-
ing the viewer’s eye. Consider the sun shining on a swimming pool. By the time sunlight 
reaches the bottom of the pool, it gets reflected more than once going through the water, 
hits the pool floor, and goes through diffuse reflection before reaching the viewer’s eye. 
What the viewer sees are the caustic effects on the pool floor.  
 7.4  Decals 
 A  decal is an image that you would display on a face(s) of a CAD model. You use decals 
for marketing purposes. SolidWorks provides a decal library that you can use or add to. 
You can drag and drop decals from the decal library onto the current CAD model

displayed in the graphics pane and manipulate them. To access 
the library, click the  Appearances, Scenes, and Decals  tab in 
the task pane shown in  Figure   7.4  . The figure also shows the 
 Decals library, which resides in this folder:  C:\Program Files\
SolidWorks Corp\SolidWorks\data\graphics\Decals\Logos . We can 
also access our own locally saved decals in any local folder by 
clicking this sequence:  PhotoView 360  on  Office Products 
tab >  Edit Decal  on the  Render Tools  tab that opens up > 
 Browse button.  
 Decals have an order that controls their visibility. If multi-
ple decals are applied, they are rendered in the order applied. 
If a decal is applied on top of another, it appears on top. You 
can use this fact to display overlapping decals to create fancy 
visual effects.

 7.5  Textures 
 Texture is also known as  surface finish in SolidWorks. You can control the appearance of 
CAD models at three levels: scene lighting, textures, and material. We may assign  material to 
a model, apply texture to it, and/or apply scene around it. The visualization effects of scene 
lights are limited to using different types of light and colors. Scene lighting cannot display the 
material look (e.g., metal, plastic, brick). We can assign a texture map to a model. 
 Texture maps are based on image files; that is, a texture map is an image of the texture, 
stored in an image file. A texture file is shrink-wrapped around a CAD model (similar to a 
decal), just like wallpaper or gift wrap. We need to select the location and orientation of 
the texture relative to the model before applying the texture. This is analogous to wrapping 
something in gift wrap. We locate and orient the gift relative to the wrap. 
 We access texture through  PhotoView 360 :  PhotoView 360  on the  Office Products 
tab  > Render Tools  tab that opens up  > Edit Appearance  to open the  PropertyManager 
tab >  Advanced tab. The  Advanced tab has four tabs that we use in examples and  tutorials. 
When you select appearance, you are able to specify a material such as steel or plastic.  
 7.6  Materials 
 Materials are used in CAD/CAM for multiple purposes: CAD, CAM, and appearance. For 
CAD, we use them to calculate mass properties, perform finite element analysis, do 
dynamic analysis, and accomplish other tasks. For CAM, we use materials to select 
machining parameters such as cutting speed, feed rate, or cutting conditions (coolant 
on/off). For rendering, materials affect the final look of the CAD model. Specifying 
 texture along with material makes the rendered CAD model look almost real. 
 SolidWorks comes with a materials library. We can also create our own new  material 
types or edit existing ones by clicking this sequence: Right-click  Material  < not 
 specified > (node in features tree) >  Edit Material . This sequence opens the  Material 
window shown in  Figure   7.5  . We can assign a material to the part by selecting from the 
 FIGURE 7.5

menu on the left. We can also add our own material by adding a custom material: right 
click any material node >  New Library. 
 HANDS-ON FOR  EXAMPLE   7.2  .   Change the torus material to ABS plastic. Also use the  knurl.jpg texture 
(search for the file). 
   7.7  Appearance and Transparency 
 Using appearance, we can add material look and feel to models without adding the 
 physical properties of materials; that is, we add visual characteristics to the models. We 
can assign appearance to parts, features, faces, or surfaces. As part of appearance, we 
can specify how transparent the model is (available under the  Illumination tab under 
the  Advanced tab). Transparency allows us to see through the model. Zero transpar-
ency means the model is like a brick wall; you cannot see through it. Full or maximum 
transparency (with a setting of 1) means the model is like a glass wall; you can see 
through it.  
 7.8  Background and Scenes 
 We are able to set the background as part of  PhotoView 360 . (We can set the back-
ground color as part of the system options by clicking  Tools > Options > System 
Options > Colors .) We can drag and drop scenes from the scenes library onto the 
 current CAD model displayed in the graphics pane. To access the library, click the 
 Appearances, Scenes, and Decals tab in the task pane shown in  Figure   7.4  . The figure 
 Example 7.2   Add material and texture (surface finish) to the free-form torus shown  in  Figure  4.2 . Use your 
own custom texture map file, Stamped.jpg. 
 Solution     We add material and texture as follows. 
 Step 1:  Open   example4.2 part file :  File > Open > 
locate the part file  > Open. 
 Step 2:  Apply material 
to model: Right click the 
 Material node in

also shows the  Scenes library, which resides in this folder:  C:\Program Files\SolidWorks 
Corp\SolidWorks\data\graphics\Scenes . The left pane of the screen also has the 
 DisplayManager tab (the rightmost tab).  
 7.9  Cameras and Camera Sleds 
 Thus far, we are able to create scenes with different types of lights and backgrounds. 
As shown in  Figure  7.2  , we can add cameras to the scene. We add a camera in a given 
location in the scene. The main objects in the scene are the CAD model and the cam-
era, which can move relative to each other. The camera can rotate (float) around the 
CAD model while it is fixed in the 3D modeling space; or the CAD model can rotate 
(float) around the camera being fixed. Obviously, moving (floating) the camera around 
the CAD model is beneficial because it allows us to view the model from different 
angles in space. 
 The floating camera model requires guiding the camera motion in space by creating 
target points or paths (curves) for the camera’s travel. SolidWorks calls these paths 
 camera sleds.  Think of it as though you mount the camera on the sled and let it ride it. 
As the sled moves, the camera moves with it. Sleds are usually used to create animation.  
 7.10  Animation 
 Animation is a useful visualization concept whereby we observe a continuous motion 
of an object in an attempt to understand its dynamic behavior with time. There are two 
types of animation: real time or playback. In real-time animation, we physically follow 
the motion of the physical object in space as it happens and record its motion. Playback 
animation is what we use. (Hollywood also uses it to create motions of cartoon 
 characters and movies.) In playback animation, we create key frames at key points in 
the time domain. We assemble the key frames and display them in a continuous fash-
ion to create the illusion of motion. We can interpolate between the key frames linearly 
or nonlinearly. 
 The camera sled moves along a defined path (linear or nonlinear) between the 
key frames (target points). As the camera moves, it takes shots of the model from dif-
ferent angles and displays them to the viewer in a continuous fashion. This is done 
by creating a sequence of camera views of the model from different angles (points on 
the sled path) and then displaying them. The camera may also move through the 
model to reveal its inside. A camera sled is a “dummy” component we create in the 
CAD model. We attach the camera to a sketch entity on the camera sled. We can hide 
the sled (the dummy component) from the sketch to view only the camera movement 
during the animation. 
 We refer to this type of animation as  camera-based animation , as opposed to 
 kinematics- or dynamic-based animation. We use the animation in motion studies. For 
example, we may use kinematics to create key frames of the model and then use the 
camera to combine them and show the animation.

Tutorial 7–2:  Apply Background and Scene 
 Three types of scenes are offered under the  Scenes node in the task pane as shown in 
 Figure   7.4 : basic, studio, and presentation. The difference is that some scenes are more 
elaborate than others. When we add scenes, they override existing scenes; they do not 
remove them. We must delete existing scenes before applying new ones if we need to 
investigate effects of different scenes. 
 
Tutorial 7–1:  Apply Colors to Objects 
 Thus far, we have not used colors in the CAD models we create (parts and assemblies). 
This tutorial shows how to apply colors to assemblies, parts, features, and faces. Note: If

around the part to create an animation effect of the model. When using the Camera 
wizard, there are many position, aim, and focal options. When the camera is  created, 
it will be accessed through the view orientations menu (e.g., the front, top, and 
 isometric views) located on the Heads-up View toolbar.

Tutorial 7–6:  Create Motion Study 
 We add a camera to motion study the model. Cameras can be used to view the model 
from different perspectives as opposed to just from the graphics pane. This tutorial 
shows how to view the model from the graphics pane as well as with the camera cre-
ated in the previous tutorial. The camera travels between multiple points over time. All 
dimensions are in mm.

nates of the camera to the following three locations: (0, 0, 60), (60, 60, 0), (60, 60, 60). Then change the 
type of camera to  135mm Telephoto (under  Field of View dropdown). Observe the effect of camera 
location and type on model rendering.

 Advanced Part Modeling
 The primary goal of  Part   III  is to explore and cover in detail the topics of curves,  surfaces, 
sheet metal, weldments, and sustainable design. This part shows the real power of geo-
metric  modeling as well as how to model and design complex parts such as computer 
mice, fan blades, and hair dryers. Two of the important modeling concepts covered 
here are 3D curves and surfaces. Combining these concepts enables us to model any 
complex shape we come across.  
 Chapter   8 (Curves) covers the details of curves, their parametric representation, and 
their types of 2D and 3D representation.  Chapter   9 (Surfaces) extends the curve theory 
and covers the parametric representation of surfaces, the available types of surfaces we can 
use in modeling, and how to use surfaces to create solid models.  Chapter   10 (Sheet Metal 
and Weldments) shows how we can create sheet metal parts and weldments.   Chapter   11  
(Sustainable Design) closes  Part   III  by covering the important topic of  environmentally 
conscious design, sustainability and life cycle assessment (LCA), and analysis.

 Curves    
 8.1  Introduction 
 Curves form the backbone of geometric modeling and creating solid models. A sketch 
consists of multiple curves that are connected to form closed contours (loops). Loops 
may be nested. A sketch that consists of only one contour generates a solid without 
holes, whereas a sketch with multiple contours generates a solid with holes in it.  Figure 
 8.1 shows examples. A one-contour sketch is demonstrated in  Figure   8.1  A. You can cre-
ate a sketch with only one-level nesting; that is, an outside contour with one or more 
disconnected contours inside it, as shown in  Figure   8.1  B. However, if you attempt to use 
more than one-level nesting as shown in  Figure  8.1  C, the solid creation operation fails.  
 CHAPTER 
8 
 Mathematically, two families of curves exist. The first family is the analytic curves. 
These curves have closed-form equations defining them. Examples of analytic curves 
include lines, circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas. This family is also known as 
 conics  because the curves result from intersecting a cone with a plane. For example, 
intersecting a cone with a plane passing through its axis produces a line. Intersecting a 
cone with a plane perpendicular to its axis produces a circle; and, if the plane is not 
perpendicular to the cone, the intersection results in an ellipse, parabola, or hyperbola. 
 The second family of curves is the synthetic curves. A  synthetic curve  is defined by a 
polynomial that uses a set of data points. These data points control the curve shape. Exam-
ples include a cubic curve and a B-spline (or a  spline, as SolidWorks calls it).  Figure   8.2 
shows sample curves with SolidWorks menus. These curves are accessible from the 
 SolidWorks  Sketch tab. The ellipse is defined by two radii (each connecting two opposite 
points, as shown in  Figure   8.2 A), and the spline is defined by points  P 0 ,  P 1 , …,  P n  .  
 Synthetic curves offer more flexibility in modeling than analytic curves. They are effi-
cient to use for creating free-form shapes. All we need to do is to define the curve points 
( Figure   8.2  B) by either clicking in the sketch area or entering ( x ,  y ,  z ) coordinates. After the 
curve is created, we can easily modify its shape by editing its points to change their locations.

 8.2  Curve Representation 
 Curves and surfaces can be described mathematically by nonparametric (explicit) or 
parametric equations. A point on a curve has ( x ,  y ) coordinates for planar (sketch) 
curves, and ( x ,  y ,  z ) coordinates for nonplanar curves. For a planar curve, an  explicit 
equation relates the  y coordinate to the  x coordinate as follows: 
 
y = f(x) xmin … x … xmax 
(8.1) 
 Explicit equations for nonplanar curves are complex and are not supported 
by CAD/CAM systems because they do not lend themselves well to the CAD 
design environment. 
 A  parametric equation  is an equation that uses a parameter (e.g.,  u ) to 
describe the ( x ,  y ) coordinates of a point on a planar curve or the ( x ,  y ,  z ) coor-
dinates of a point on a nonplanar curve.  Figure   8.3  shows the parametric repre-
sentation of a curve. The parameter  u starts with a minimum value,  u min , at one 
end of the curve and finishes with a maximum value,  u max , at the other end of 
the curve. The parameter increases in value from  u min to  u max , thus defining the 
parameterization direction of the curve as indicated by the arrow on the curve. 
Any point  P on the curve is defined by its position vector,  P , that is a function 
of  u , 
 
P = P(u)  umin … u … umax 
(8.2)  
 Alternatively, point  P is defined by its ( x, y, z ) coordinates. Thus, 
 
P = £
x
y
z
§ = £
x(u)
y(u)
z(u)
§  umin … u … umax 
(8.3) 
 The tangent vector   P at any point on the curve ( Figure   8.3  ) is given by: 
 
P = dP
du = £
x
y
z
§  umin … u … umax 
(8.4) 
 The tangent vector is an important concept in CAD/CAM applications such as mass 
property calculations and NC (numerical control) programming. For these two appli-
cations, we use the tangent vector at any point on the curve to calculate the normal 
vector to the curve at the same point. For mass properties, the direction of the normal 
vector is used to determine the inside (where material is) and the outside (where holes 
exist) of the solid. For NC programming, we move the cutting tool along the direction 
of the normal vector until it makes contact with the part surface to be machined. This

minimizes the lateral (shear) forces on the cutting tool, which in turn reduces the 
chance of breaking the tool upon contact with the surface to be machined. 
 SolidWorks supports both explicit and parametric equations for curves. It allows 
the user to enter explicit equations for planar (sketch) curves. It does not support 
explicit equations for nonplanar curves. However, it does  support parametric equa-
tions for both planar and nonplanar curves. It uses the parameter  t instead of  u . This 
chapter shows how to enter and use equations in SolidWorks.  
 8.3  Line Parametric Equation 
 Figure   8.4  shows the parametric representation of a straight line defined by two 
 endpoints,  P 0 and  P 1 . The parameterization direction of the line shown in  Figure   8.4  
goes from  P 0 to  P 1 , indicating that we start sketching the line at  P 0 and finish 
at  P 1 . The parametric equation of this line is given (in vector form) by:  
 
P = P(u) = P0 +  u(P1 - P0) 0 … u … 1  
(8.5)  
 or (in scalar form), 
 
P = P(u) = £

§ = £
x0 + u(x1 - x0)
y0 + u(y1 - y0)
z0 + u(z1 - z0)
§ 0 … u … 1  
(8.6) 
 Using  Eq.  (8.4)  , the tangent vector of the line is given by: 
 
P = £
x
y
z
§ = £
x1 - x0
y1 - y0
z1 - z0
§  
(8.7)  
 Equation   (8.7)  shows that the tangent vector is constant (independent of  u ), as expected. 
We can easily derive the line slope from the tangent vector. For example, the line slope 
in the XY plane is given by: 
 
dy
dx = dy>du
dx>du = y
x 
(8.8)  
 The elegance of the parametric representation is that it is independent of the dimen-
sionality of the modeling space whether it is 2D ( x and  y coordinates only) or 3D ( x ,  y , 
and  z coordinates). In other words, use   z = 0 in the 3D equations and we get 2D mod-
eling. As a matter of fact, when we sketch in a sketch plane, the  z value is set to zero; 
when we are done sketching, SolidWorks transforms the sketch “2D” WCS coordinates 
to “3D” MCS coordinates. 
 Example 8.1   A designer created a line connecting point (−3, 2, 1) to point (0, −4, 2). 
Find the line parametric equation, its midpoint, its endpoints, and its 
tangent vector.

 The endpoints of the line occur at   u = 0 and   u = 1 and are the same as the points 
given in the example. Thus, we can check whether  Eq.   (8.9)  is correct by substituting 
the values   u = 0 and   u = 1. 
 HANDS-ON FOR  EXAMPLE   8.1  .   Find the line equation if the designer  reverses the order of the endpoints 
to sketch the line. 
 8.4  Circle Parametric Equation 
 We consider the case of a circle defined by a center point ( x c , y c  ) and a radius 
 R only to simplify the formulation. When we sketch a circle, we must define a 
sketch plane because a center and a radius define an infinite number of  circles. 
 Figure   8.5  shows this definition of a parametric circle. The parameter  u is 
the angle, measured in counterclockwise direction. The circle equation is 
given by:  
 
P(u) = cx(u)
y(u)d = cxc + R cos u
yc + R sin u d  0 … u …  2p 
(8.11)  
 We can normalize the  u limits in  Eq.   (8.11)  to (0, 1) instead of (0,   2p ). This gives: 
 
  P(u) = cx(u)
y(u)d = cxc + R cos 2pu
yc + R sin 2pu d  0 …  u … 1  
(8.12)  
 Note that the circle, although closed, has two coincident endpoints, one for each  u limit. 
 The tangent vector of the circle is given by: 
 
P(u) = cx(u)
y(u)d = c -R sin u
R cos u d  0 … u … 2p 
(8.13)  
 Or, 
 
P(u) = cx(u)
y(u)d = c -2pR sin 2pu
2pR cos 2pu d  0 … u … 1  
(8.14)  
 Equations   (8.11) through   (8.14)  can also be used to define arcs. The only difference 
is the  u limits, that is,  u1 … u … u2 .  Figure   8.5  shows this arc segment.

 Example 8.2   Find the equation of a circle with a radius of 2.0 in. and a center 
at the origin. Find the midpoint of the circle. What is the tangent 
vector and slope at this point? 
 Solution     Using  Eq.  (8.11)  with the given data, we get: 
 
P(u) = cx(u)
y(u)d = c2 cos u
2 sin u d  0 … u … 2p 
(8.15)  
 The midpoint of the circle occurs in the mid-range of the  u parameter, that is, at 
 u = p.   Equation   (8.15)  gives: 
 
P(p) = cx(p)
y(p)d = c -2
0d  
(8.16)  
 These coordinates agree with the visual inspection of  Figure   8.5  ; the point is the 
 leftmost point on the circle circumference. Note that the midpoint of the circle is not 
its center; the center does not lie on the circle circumference. The tangent vector at the 
 midpoint is obtained by substituting   u = p in Eq.  (8.13) to get: 
 
P(p) = cx(p)
y(p)d = c
0
-2d  
(8.17)  
 The slope at this point is given by   y
x =  as expected because the tangent vector 
is vertical at this point; that is, it makes a 90° angle measured from the horizontal axis 
counterclockwise.  
 8.5  Spline Parametric Equation 
 Different types of splines exist. The most commonly used one by CAD/CAM 
systems is the cubic B-spline curve, or spline for short.  Figure   8.6 shows a 
spline connecting   n + 1 data points. The spline equation takes the follow-
ing form:  
   P(u) = f0(u)P0 + f1(u)P1 + g + fn(u)Pn  umin … u … umax 
(8.18)  
 where the highest degree of any of these  f ( u ) functions is cubic.

(8.19)  
 Find the endpoints and the midpoint of the spline. Also, find the tangent vector and 
the slope at the midpoint. Using your CAD/CAM system, create the spline defined by 
the above equation. 

228
Chapter 8: Curves
 Solution     The endpoints occur at   u = 0 and   u = 1. The midpoint of the spline oc-
curs at  u = 0.5.  Substituting these values in  Eq.  (8.19)  , we get: 
 P(0) = c2
2d, P(0.5) = c2.5
2.75d, and P(1) = c3

 8.6  Two-Dimensional Curves 
 SolidWorks implements the curve parametric theory presented here and provides ver-
satile ways for designers to create curves. Curves may be planar (2D curves) or nonpla-
nar (3D curves). The 2D curves are sketch entities; that is, they lie in the sketch plane 

Chapter 8: Curves
229
regardless of how complex they may look. To create 2D curves from equations, we may 
use this sequence (or the sequence shown in Step 1 of  Example   8.3  ):  Tools >  Sketch 
Entities > Equation Driven Curve . We must be in a sketch to access it.  
 8.7  Three-Dimensional Curves 
 3D curves, unlike 2D curves, do not belong to only one sketch plane. A segment of a 
3D curve may belong to one sketch plane while another segment may belong to 
another sketch plane. 3D curves are valuable to use in some designs, and they simplify 
feature creation significantly as shown in the tutorials in this chapter. The 3D curves 
become more powerful and elegant when we combine them with surfaces , as shown 
later in the book . 
 There are multiple methods to create 3D curves (refer to the tutorials of the chapter 
on how to use each method): 
  
1.  Curve explicit equation:    This method takes a curve explicit equation in the form 
given by  Equation   (8.1)  . 
  
2.  Curve parametric equation:   This method takes a curve parametric equation in the 
form given by  Equation   (8.3)  . 
  
3.  3D points:    This method requires a list of ( x ,  y ,  z ) coordinates of the 3D points. The 
user may input the coordinates while creating the curve or store them in a text file 
and read it into SolidWorks.  
  
4.  3D sketching:   This method allows us to sketch entities in different sketch planes.  
  
5.  Composite curve:    We can create composite curves by combining curves, sketch 
geometry, and model edges into a single curve. The individual curves may belong to 
one sketch or different sketches. If they belong to the same sketch, the resulting 
composite curve is 2D. If they belong to multiple sketches, the resulting curve is 3D.  
  
6.  Project a curve onto a model face:   This method takes a 2D curve created on a sketch 
plane and converts it into a 3D curve by projecting it onto a model face. The 
model face needs to be nonplanar to create a 3D curve; otherwise, the projected 
curve remains 2D.  
  
7.  Projected curve:    This is a very powerful method to create 3D curves. You can create 
a 3D curve from two 2D curves. These 2D curves are two projections of the 3D 
curve onto two intersecting sketch planes. The 3D curve represents the surface/
surface intersection of two extruded surfaces generated by the two 2D curves, as 
shown in  Figure  8.8  . A common practice is to sketch the two best projections of 
the 3D curve on two different sketches (e.g., front and top or front and right) and 
then use the projected curve method to create the 3D curve. If the resulting curve 
needs tweaking, delete it, modify the two sketches, and then re-create it. We 
continue this iterative process until we are satisfied with the resulting 3D curve.

 8.8  Curve Management 
 After we create curves, we can manage and manipulate them in different ways. We can 
modify, edit, trim, split (divide), and/or intersect them. These manipulations are easily 
done as an outcome of the curve parametric formulation presented in this chapter. We 
have already done all these manipulations except breaking a curve. Follow this sequence 
to split a curve: Right click it >  Split Entities  (from the pop-up window) > click the 
curve where you want to split it >  Esc key on the keyboard to finish. To verify the split, 
hover over the entities and observe the curve segments. You may also verify the split by 
right clicking a segment >  Delete from the popup menu.  
 8.9  Tutorials 
 The theme for the tutorials in this chapter is to practice creating and using curves. The 
tutorials show how to use all the methods for creating 3D curves that we have covered. 
 
Tutorial 8–1:  Create a 2D Curve Using Explicit Equation 
 We create a curve defined by the following explicit equation: 
 
y = 0.5x2 0 … x … 3  
(8.20)  
 Equation   (8.20) defines half a parabola that is symmetric with respect to the Y axis. 
We revolve the parabola to create a feature ( Figure   8.9  ) for better visualization.

5u + 1
d  0 … u …  1

Tutorial 8–4:  Create a 3D Curve Using 3D Points 
 We create a set of 3D points in 3D modeling space and connect them with a spline. 
We use the resulting curve to create a sweep ( Figure   8.12  ) for better visualization. All 
dimensions are in mm.

Tutorial 8–5:  Create a 3D Curve Using 3D Sketching 
 We build a bicycle handle bar using a 3D sketch. Enable sketching in 3D space by tog-
gling (changing) sketch planes. We toggle using the  Tab key on keyboard. The available 
sketch planes are XY (front), XZ (top), and YZ (right). The current plane designation is 
attached to the mouse as it moves. The bicycle handle bar requires the XY plane and the 
YZ plane.  Figure  8.13  shows the handlebar. All dimensions are in inches. 
 HANDS-ON FOR  TUTORIAL   8–3 .   Save the points in a text file, add five more points to the file, and 
re-create the curve by reading the file into SolidWorks.

Tutorial 8–8:  Create a 3D Curve Using Projected Curves 
 We create a 3D curve from projected curves (2D sketches). Projecting two 2D curves from 
multiple sketch planes creates a 3D curve. This tutorial shows examples of creating vari-
ous solids using different projected sketches and a sweep profile. Case 1 ( Figure   8.16 ) is 
shown in detail. The remaining cases are illustrated but are not shown in detail; the same 
steps can be followed as in case 1 in order to accomplish the goal. We create 3D curves 
using the following 2D curves:

1.  What is the difference between analytic and synthetic curves? Which family is 
better? Why?  
  
2.  If a parametric curve has  u limits of  u min and  u max , what is the  u value at its midpoint?  
  
3.  Use the tangent vector  Eq.   (8.4)  to find the curve slopes in the XY, XZ, and YZ planes.  
  
4.  Find the parametric equation of the line connecting point (2, 1, 0) to point (−2, 
−5, 0). Find the line midpoint and its tangent vector. Sketch the line, and show 
the endpoints and the parameterization direction on the sketch.  
  
5.  For the line of Problem 4, find the coordinates of the points located at   u = 0.25 
from both ends of the line.  
  
6.  Reverse the parameterization direction of the line of Problem 4, and re-solve the 
problem. 
  
7.  Repeat Problems 4 and 5 but for points (1, 3, 7) and (−2, −4, −6).  
  
8.  Find the line slopes of Problem 7 in the XY, XZ, and YZ planes.  
  
9.  Find the equation of a circle with a diameter of 3.0 in. and a center at (1, −2). Find 
the four quarter points on the circle. Use  Eq.  (8.12)  . What are the tangent vectors 
and slopes at these points?  
  10.  Repeat Problem 9 but for a circle with a radius of 1 in. and a center at the origin.  
  11.  Use both  Eqs.  (8.11)  and   (8.12)  to write the equation of an arc whose diameter is 
1.5 in. and that is located in the third quadrant with a center at the origin.  
  12.  A spline is given by: 
 P(u) = cx(u)
y(u)d = c1 + 4u - u2
2 - u + u2 d  0 … u … 1  
 
 Find the endpoints and the midpoint of the spline. Also, find the tangent vector

 Surfaces  
 9.1  Introduction 
 Even with the modeling power that the features and curves provide, they are still inca-
pable of handling all the modeling problems and scenarios we encounter. Consider, for 
example, modeling an intricate computer mouse, a table spoon, a hair dryer, a shoe, or 
a sports car body. This class of objects, called  free-form parts , is characterized by having 
free-form surfaces of intricate shapes. Surfaces, then, are the best modeling technique to 
use to create the solid models of these parts. 
 Surfaces build on curves, from both the theory and the modeling aspects. Creating 
surfaces requires the creation of curves first, as illustrated in the tutorials of this chapter. 
We view surfaces as extensions of curves. Surface equations, as we cover in this chapter, 
extend the parametric representation of curves. Thus, surfaces are classified in the same 
way as are curves: analytic and synthetic. Examples of analytic surfaces are plane, ruled 
surface, surface of revolution, and sweep. An example of synthetic surfaces is a spline 
surface. 
 Combining 3D curves and surfaces provides the most sophisticated and advanced 
modeling technique, which enables us to create a solid model of any part we may imag-
ine. However, before we get carried away and let our design imagination run wild, we 
must always ask ourselves this basic question: Can the part be manufactured? A “yes” 
answer to this question is not enough. A follow-up question is, at what cost? These two 
questions explain why about 80% of the parts in practice can be modeled using extru-
sions and revolves , which we covered in  Chapter   1 . 
 9.2  Surfaces 
 Figure   9.1 shows all the surfaces we can create in SolidWorks. A  surface is defined as a 
thin planar or nonplanar sheet that does not have a thickness. Creating a surface in itself 
is not useful. Surfaces are viewed as an intermediate step between creating curves and 
solids. We use them to create solids (features) that curves cannot create. Like features, 
surfaces are always listed in the features tree ( FeatureManager Design Tree ). If we were 
to expand a  Surface node in the tree, we would see the sketch that defines the surface.

Chapter 9: Surfaces
 If we would like to master surface creation, we should be able to answer three fun-
damental questions: 
  
1.  What are the available surfaces that a CAD/CAM system offers for modeling parts?  
  
2.  What is the input required to create each surface?  
  
3.  Which surface should we use for a given modeling problem?  
 Figure   9.1 provides the answer to the first question.  Table  9.1  answers the other two 
questions. It shows a simple, basic example of each surface. Keep in mind that the third 
question may have multiple answers; one of them is always the best answer. For exam-
ple, we may use a loft or a sweep. However, if the surface has a constant cross section 
along a curve, a sweep is better to use because it requires fewer steps to create the sur-
face. If the surface has a variable cross section, a loft is better to use.

Chapter 9: Surfaces
 To learn surfaces quickly, keep in mind that the majority of them parallel features, 
with the difference that they do not have thickness. For example, the first four surfaces 
shown in  Figure   9.1 parallel extruded boss, revolved boss, swept boss, and lofted boss, 
respectively. The tutorials in this chapter provide modeling examples. The other sur-
faces, shown in  Figure   9.1  and not covered in  Table   9.1  , are dealt with in the tutorials 
of the chapter. 
 9.3  Using Surfaces in Solid Modeling 
 The goal of creating surfaces is not to create surfaces, but to use them to create complex 
features and solids. How can we do that? There are three methods as shown in  Figure   9.2 .   
 The first method is to thicken a surface to create a solid and is shown as the 
 Thicken icon on the far right of the  Surface tab in  Figure   9.1 . The user specifies a 
thickness. Depending on the surface shape and the thickness value that the user spec-
ifies, the thicken operation may fail and the solid may not be created. Understanding

 A sketch consisting of curves 
defining a closed boundary 
(i.e., the curves are planar) 
 
 • Use when you need to create planar 
surfaces bounded by a certain 
boundary.

 Knit 
 A set of surfaces to knit (here 
we knit a surface fill on the top 
with a loft surface on the sides) 
 
 • Use when you need to combine (knit) 
a set of surface patches into one 
surface. The resulting surface may or 
may not be closed. 
 • Use the knit surface to cut a solid or 
convert the knit surface to a solid.

how the thicken operation works explains its potential failure. When we thicken the 
surface, conceptually the CAD/CAM system creates a copy of the surface and displaces 
it by the thickness amount. The cross sections of the thickened surface (solid) must 
stay perpendicular to the surface profile and nonintersecting, as shown in  Figure   9.3A . 
If the thicken operation results in intersecting cross sections, the operation fails. Inter-
secting cross sections usually happen if the surface has abrupt sharp changes, as 
shown in  Figure  9.3  A.  Figure   9.3 B depicts the SolidWorks error message when the 
thicken operation fails.    
 The second method of using surfaces to create solids is to have a surface cut a solid 
(feature) to carve out the solid we want. If the surface is open (like a sheet), it splits the 
solid into two; we keep the part we want and throw away the other part. In this case, 
make sure that the surface extends beyond the solid faces from all directions. If the sur-
face is closed (like a sphere) and enclosed inside a solid, it carves out part of the solid. 
 The third method is to convert the surface itself into a solid. In this case, the surface 
must be closed; otherwise, the conversion process fails with the error message shown in 
 Figure   9.3 C. Typically, we combine multiple surfaces (called  surface patches ) to create a 
fully closed surface by “knitting” them together using a knit surface, shown at the end of 
 Table  9.1 . 
 9.4  Surface Representation 
 CAD/CAM software uses parametric equations to represent surfaces. A 
surface equation uses two parameters (e.g.,  u and  v ) to describe the ( x ,  y , 
 z ) coordinates of a point. Any point  P on the surface is located (defined) 
by two values of the  u and  v parameters.  Figure   9.4  shows the parametric 
representation of a surface patch. Each of the parameters  u and  v starts 
with a minimum value at one corner of the surface and finishes with a 
maximum value at the opposite corner. The parameter increases in value 
from the minimum value to the maximum one, thus defining the param-
eterization direction of the surface, in both  u and  v directions, as indicated 
by the arrows shown on the surface in  Figure   9.4  . The parameters have 
their lowest values typically at the bottom left corner of the surface patch, 
as shown in  Figure   9.4  .

 Any point  P on the surface is defined by its position vector  P that is a function of  u 
and  v , that is, 
 
P = P(u, v)     umin 6 u 6 umax, vmin 6 v 6 vmax

 A point on a surface has four vectors: two tangent vectors, one in each direction ( P  u  
and  P  v  ), a normal vector  N , and a twist vector  P  uv  . The tangent vector  P  u  in the  u direc-
tion at any point on the surface ( Figure   9.4  ) is given by:

§   umin 6 u 6 umax, vmin 6 v 6 vmax 
(9.4)  
 We explain the twist vector concept as follows. A tangent vector measures how a 
surface changes in the  u or the  v direction, that is, if we follow the surface in one direc-
tion only. For example,  P  u  shows how the surface  v = constant curves change in the  u 
direction. Similarly,  P  v  shows how the surface  u = constant curves change in the  v direc-
tion. The twist vector measures the change of the tangent vector; that is,  P  uv  measures the 
change of  P  u  in the  v direction, and  P  vu  measures the change of  P  v  in the  u direction. 
Mathematically, we express this behavior by this equation: 
 
Puv = Pvu = 02P
0u0v = £
xuv

§   umin 6 u 6 umax, vmin 6 v 6 vmax 
(9.5)  
 The normal vector  N to the surface at a point is perpendicular to the plane formed 
by the two surface tangent vectors at the point. Thus, we can write: 
 
N = Pu * Pv      umin 6 u 6 umax, vmin 6 v 6 vmax 
(9.6)  
 We can also use   N = Pv * Pu. The difference is a minus sign. CAD/CAM software 
uses one form consistently. 
 These four surface vectors provide ample insight into the surface behavior. Other 
surface calculations include the radius of curvature and the curvature, which we do not 
cover here. The relation between the curvature,   x , and the radius of curvature,   r , is 
given by: 
 
x = 1

 9.5  Plane Parametric Equation 
 Figure   9.5 shows the parametric representation of a plane defined by three points,  P 0 , 
 P 1 , and  P 2 . The parameterization directions of the plane are shown in the figure. The 
parametric equation of this plane is given (in vector form) by:

 Equations  (9.10)  and   (9.11)  show that the tangent vectors are constant (independent of 
 u and  v ), as expected. 
 Using  Eq.   (9.5) , the twist vector of the surface is zero because both tangent vectors 
of the plane as given by  Eqs.   (9.10)  and   (9.11)  are independent of  u or v . Thus,

 The determinant shown in  Eq.   (9.13)  is the result of the cross product shown in  Eq. 
 (9.6)  .  Eq.   (9.13)  produces a vector with a constant direction because it is independent 
of  u and  v . 
 The elegance of the parametric representation is that it is independent of the dimen-
sionality of the modeling space whether it is 2D ( x and  y coordinates only) or 3D ( x ,  y , and 
 z coordinates). In other words, use  z = 0 in the 3D equations and we get 2D modeling.

 A ruled surface interpolates two planar curves linearly in the  v direction,

face. The parameterization direction of the two curves should be the same. 
It defines the  u direction of the ruled surface. The  u limits of the two 
curves should be the same. The parametric equation of the ruled surface 
is given by:

 Where  x C  ( u ) , y C  ( u ) , and  z C  ( u ) are the components of the curve  C ( u ) vector equation in 
the X, Y, and Z directions. Similarly,  x D  ( u ) , y D  ( u ) , and  z D  ( u ) are the components of the 
curve  D ( u ) vector equation in the X, Y, and Z directions. The surface vectors can easily 
be determined once  Eq.  (9.19)  has a specific form. 
 SolidWorks has a  Ruled Surface  on its  Surfaces tab as shown in  Figure   9.1 . It is not 
the same as the ruled surface covered here. The ruled surface covered here corresponds 
to  Lofted Surface on the SolidWorks  Surfaces tab.

 Example 9.4   Create a surface-to-surface intersection curve. 
 Solution     Surface-to-surface intersection is a powerful modeling concept to create complex 3D curves. In this 
example we intersect two cylindrical surfaces as shown in  Figure   9.9  and create a sweep along the intersection 
curve for visualization purposes (see the example hands-on). All dimensions are in inches.  
 HANDS-ON FOR  EXAMPLE   9.3  .   Verify the coordinates of the surface midpoint calculated manually in 
 Example  9.2 . Hint: Use the  Measure tool on the  Evaluate tab. Create a line connecting the midpoint of the 
line (hover until you see the midpoint symbol) and spline (hover until you see the point [1.5 and 90°]). Then, 
insert a point at the midpoint of the line just created. Last, use  Measure to display point coordinates.

after creating or deleting surfaces, click:  View > Hide All Types (it is a toggle). 
 9.7  Surface Visualization 
 Surfaces are harder to visualize than curves because of their curvature in space. As such, 
CAD/CAM systems provide surface visualization aids. These aids are as follows: 
  
1.  Surface mesh:    The mesh ( u-v grid) consists of  u = constant and  v = constant 
curves in a grid fashion as depicted in  Figure   9.4 . The higher the mesh size 
( u - v gridlines), the more visual the surface. However, keep in mind that the 
surface mesh size has no implication on surface accuracy because the accuracy 
is controlled by the surface equation. As a matter of fact, a CAD/CAM system 
uses the surface equation to generate the mesh gridlines. SolidWorks does not 
provide an easy way to display surface mesh except during creating a  Boundary 
Surface .  
  
2.  Surface curvature:    Each surface has a radius of curvature and curvature at any of its 
points. Let us assume that the surface has a radius of curvature of   r at any of its 
points. The surface curvature at this point is the inverse of the radius of curvature 
and is given by Eq. (9.7). 
 SolidWorks displays a curvature contour map superimposed on the surface. 
As the user moves the mouse over the surface,   r and curvature are displayed. The 
user must invoke the display mode:  View >  Display >  Curvature (this sequence is 
a toggle; do it again to turn the display mode off). The display of a surface curva-
ture is a topological map shown in color to help demonstrate how the surface 
curves and twists in space.  
  
3.  Curve combs:    This option applies to curves, not surfaces. It displays the curve 
curvature as the teeth of a comb. A tooth length at a curve point is proportional to 
the curvature amount. A circle has a constant curvature; thus, comb teeth lengths 
are equal.  
  
4.  Surface zebra stripes:   These stripes indicate how smooth the tangency between 
adjacent surface patches are; that is, they indicate how smooth the transition is 
between patches across the shared edges. View Zebra stripes as follows:  View > 
 Display >  Zebra Stripes (this sequence is a toggle; do it again to turn the display 
mode off).

Chapter 9: Surfaces
 9.8  Surface Management 
 After we create surfaces, we manage and manipulate them in different ways. We can 
investigate their curvatures and change their appearances by assigning them materials. 
Surfaces are harder than curves to manipulate during modeling.  
 9.9  Tutorials 
 The theme for the tutorials in this chapter is to practice creating and using surfaces. The 
tutorials show how to create surfaces and how to use them to create solids. 
 
Tutorial 9–1:  Create Basic Surfaces: Extrude, Revolve, Loft, Sweep, 
Knit, and Radiate 
 This tutorial covers some basic surface types.  Figure   9.10  shows the resulting surface 
model. We also cover surface trim. All dimensions are in inches.

 Step 7:  Create  Surface-Knit1 :  Knit Surface on  Sur-

 Note: There is no visible difference when the knit 
surface is created. Knit surface in itself has no mod-
eling value for this tutorial other than practicing 
surface creation. Also, notice that the  Try to form 
solid option is shown as inactive because the knot 
surface is not closed.  
 Step 8:  Create  Surface-Radiate1 :  Insert >  Surface > 
Radiate > expand features tree >  Right Plane > four 
edges of  Surface-Sweep1 > enter  1.0 for  D1 > ✔ 
 
 
 Note: The  Radiate surface is not readily available on 
the  Surfaces tab.  
 
 
 
 Step 5:  Create  Surface-Loft1 : Sketch 3 × 3 center

 Note: You must select  Sketch3 first, then  Edge <1> of 
 Surface-Extrude1 ; otherwise, SolidWorks closes both 
ends (caps) of surface loft. 
 Note: The two big solid green circles shown indicate 
the corresponding points that SolidWorks uses to 
interpolate the two rails (curves). If they are not 
matching, the surface you create is twisted.

 HANDS-ON FOR TUTORIAL 9–1.    Suppress the two radiate surfaces. Modify the surface model to close 
the knit surface (create a closed volume) of Step 7 to convert it to a solid. 
 
Tutorial 9–2:  Create Basic Surfaces: Planar, Filled, Boundary, and Offset 
 This tutorial covers other basic surface 
types (shown in  Figure  9.11 ) not covered 
in Tutorial 9.1. Note: The first three sur-
faces (boundary, fill, and plane) of the 
features tree shown in  Figure   9.11  over-
lap—not a good practice. However, they 
illustrate the idea that you can use the 
same boundary curves to create multiple 
types of surfaces.

Tutorial 9–3:  Visualize Surfaces 
 We use the three methods for surface visualization, curvature, combs, and zebra stripes, 
to analyze surface quality.  Figure   9.12  shows a surface curvature map of the air duct 
shown in  Figure   9.10  . Surface curvature maps use the color codes—black, blue, green, 
red—in this order, indicating lowest (no) curvature (value of 0 for flat surfaces) to high-
est curvature (value of 1).  
 HANDS-ON FOR TUTORIAL 9–2.    Delete the above surfaces except the boundary surface (you need it 
to create a ruled surface). Use the edges of the boundary surface to create a SolidWorks  Ruled Surface . 
How many edges does the system allow you to select? Why?

Tutorial 9–4:  Create an Artistic Bowl 
 This tutorial shows a combination of advanced modeling tools used to create an artistic 
bowl shown in  Figure   9.13  . We use 3D curves, surfaces, and features to create the bowl. 
This bowl can only be produced by injection molding. All dimensions are not included 
to simplify model presentation. All dimensions are in inches. 
 The main modeling idea here is to create 3D curves that we use to create two sur-
faces, a sweep and a loft. We then knit the two surfaces and thicken them to create a 
solid. Last, we create two extrude cuts to make the wholes.

Tutorial 9–5:  Use Surface Intersections 
 We use surface intersection to create intricate 3D curves. 
The idea here is to intersect two surfaces to create intri-
cate intersection curves. If one of the intersecting sur-
faces is a helix surface, we generate visually pleasing and 
creative intersection curves, as this tutorial shows. These 
curves may be used to create sweeps of different shapes. 
We may use taper helixes to add to the visual complexity 
of the intersection curve. 
 We create a surface revolve and a surface sweep. The 
surface revolve uses two arcs. The surface sweep uses a 
line as the sweep profile and a helix as the sweep path. 
Intersect the two surfaces to create a 3D curve. Sweep a 
circle (sweep profile) along the intersection curve (sweep 
path) for better visualization. The resulting swept feature 
is shown in  Figure   9.14  . All dimensions are in inches.

Tutorial 9–6:  Create a Tablespoon 
 We use 3D curves and surfaces to create the tablespoon model shown in  Figure   9.15  . 
We create the sketches necessary to form the 3D projected curves to outline the spoon. 
We use a lofted surface to create the spoon surface and then thicken it. All dimensions 
are in mm.  
 HANDS-ON FOR TUTORIAL 9–5.    Change the shape of the 3D curve by modifying either the surface 
revolve or the helix. Generate four cases: (1) change  Sketch1 of Step 1 into an arc, (2) change it to a circle, 
(3) repeat 1 for a taper helix (Step 3), (4) repeat 2 for a taper helix.

 HANDS-ON FOR TUTORIAL 9–6.    The current spoon is shallow. Add two guide curves for the surface 
loft operation between the two 3D curves to deepen the spoon holding area. For the new spoon de-
sign, find the threshold thickness at which the thicken operation fails. Use the three  Thickness options: 
 Thicken Side 1 ,  Thicken Side 2 , or  Thicken Both Sides. Explain why the thicken operation fails. 
 
Tutorial 9–7:  Create a Computer Mouse 
 We create the mouse shown in  Figure   9.16  using two dif-
ferent methods. One method cuts a solid with a surface 
while the other method thickens a surface. We create a 
lofted surface to use in both methods. The lofted surface 
is defined by four curves created in four separate sketches, 
as shown in  Figure   9.16  . All dimensions are in mm.

Tutorial 9–8:  Create a Baseball Hat 
 We use 3D curves and surfaces to create the baseball hat 
shown in  Figure   9.17  . The hardest part of the baseball 
hat to create is the visor because it requires nonplanar 
(3D) curves to define. We use the projected curves mod-
eling technique together with surfaces to create the visor. 
When we sketch the 2D curves to define a 3D curve, we 
sketch freely; that is, no prior coordinates are known. We 
evaluate the shape of the visor after we create it. If we 
do not like it, we go back and tweak the curve data. We 
repeat this process until we are satisfied with the visor 
shape and look. 
 The modeling plan is as follows. The head cover and 
the button are created using simple revolve features. The 
visor is created using 3D curves and surfaces. The groove 
lines are created using swept cuts and circular patterns. 
All dimensions are in mm.

 Sheet Metal and Weldments 
 
 10.1  Introduction 
 The previous chapters have focused heavily on presenting and harnessing  the power of 
features, curves (especially 3D curves), and surfaces to create solids. As a matter of fact, 
there are no parts that cannot be created using these modeling tools. However, this 
chapter covers the basics of one class of parts that, although it can be modeled using 
these tools, is created more efficiently via other specialized modeling techniques. This 
class is sheet metal parts and weldments (welded parts). These parts are used heavily in 
industry, and CAD/CAM systems provide special modeling techniques to create them 
efficiently. For example, a weldment is created as a steel or welded frame or structure 
instead of as an assembly. Even though they are not related, we cover both sheet metal 
and weldments in one chapter because they belong to this special class.  
 10.2  Sheet Metal 
 Sheet metal  is thin, flat pieces of metal that come in different sizes that can be cut and 
bent into a variety of shapes. The thickness of sheet metals can vary significantly, from 
1 mm to 6 mm (0.25 inch). An extremely thin piece of metal is considered a foil or leaf 
(e.g., kitchen aluminum foil), and pieces thicker than 6 mm are considered plates. Sheet 
metal is a fundamental form used in metalworking. Many parts of objects around us are 
made from sheet metal. Examples include airplane wings, car bodies, medical tables, 
roofs for buildings, brackets, chases, enclosures, panels, channels, hinges, razor blades, 
and signage. Industries that use sheet metal include audio-video, electronics, fiber 
optics, medical, security, semiconductors, and telecommunications. 
 Sheet metal processes and equipment include punching (via punch press), rolling, 
embossing, stamping, breaking, notching, shearing, spot welding, insertion, and finish-
ing. Machining tolerance could be as small as 0.0005 in. Commonly used materials 
include aluminum, steel, brass, copper, silver, gold, nickel, platinum, and titanium. NC 
(numerical control) programming may be used to program sheet metal fabrication. 
 Sheet metal comes as flat sheets or coiled strips. The coils are formed by running flat 
sheets through a roll slitter. The thickness of a sheet metal is known as its gauge. Gauges 
range from 30 gauge to 8 gauge. The higher the gauge, the thinner the sheet. 
 If you need a sheet metal part as an enclosure, you can design it in two ways: either 
on its own without any references to the parts it will enclose, or in the context of the 
assembly that contains the enclosed components. 
 One common operation of sheet metal is bending a sheet. Sheet metal bending is 
also known as a brake. The machine that bends sheet metal is known as a bending brake 
 CHAPTER 
10 

296
Chapter 10: Sheet Metal and Weldments
or bending machine. The machine can create simple bends and creases, or create box 
and pan shapes. Bending changes the shape of the metal by plastically deforming it. 
When a sheet metal is bent, the inside surface of the bend is compressed, and the outer 
surface of the bend is stretched. Somewhere within the metal thickness lies its neutral 
axis (NA). An NA is a line or layer in the metal that is free from any forces; that is, it is 
neither compressed nor stretched. Thus, the length of the metal remains the 
same along the NA, before and after bending. 
 The location of the NA is referred to as the K-Factor of the sheet metal; that 
is, the K-Factor is used to calculate the location of the neutral axis. The K- Factor 
is important in determining the flat length of the sheet metal that is required to 
produce certain bends. Consider the example shown in  Figure  10.1 . We want 
a sheet metal workpiece with a bend angle  A and a bend radius  R , in which one 
leg measures  L 1 , and the other measures  L 2 . The NA is located at thickness  t 
from the inner surface, and the metal total thickness is  T . It is obvious from 
 Figure   10.1  that the total length of the flat piece that we should bend is not 
 L 1 +  L 2 , as we might first assume. We need to add the bend part, BA, for the 
bend angle  A . This part is known as the bend allowance (BA), which we must 
add to the leg lengths to get the final bend shape that we want. Thus, the flat 
length,  L , of the sheet metal is given by:  
 
L = L1 + L2 +
  BA 
(10.1)  
 The location of the NA varies depending on the material itself, the bend radius,  R , the 
ambient temperature, the direction of the material grain, and the method used for bend-
ing. The  K-Factor is the ratio of the location of the NA as measured by the thickness,  t , 
shown in  Figure   10.1 with respect to the thickness,  T , of the sheet metal part; that is, 
 
K@Factor = t
T 
(10.2)  
 The K-Factor is usually calculated by trial and error. The K-Factor is typically 
between 0.3 and 0.5. For most types of steel it is between 0.33 and 0.4. 
 The bend allowance, BA, is given by the following arc equation: 
 
BA = ru = (R + t) pA
180 = (R + KT) pA
180 = pA(R + KT)
180
 
(10.3)  
 where A is in degrees. 
 Substituting Eq. (10.3) into Eq. (10.1), we get the sheet metal flat length as: 
 
L = L1 + L2 + pA(R + KT)
180
 
(10.4)  
 Sometimes, we let the lengths of the two legs,  L 1 and  L 2 , meet (intersect), and over-
take the arc length BA. In this case, the total length,  L 1 +  L 2 , exceeds the length of the flat 
sheet by an amount called the  bend deduction (BD); that is, 
 
BD = L1 + L2 - flat length 
(10.5) 
 While it may seem logical that BA and BD are equal, they are not. We will not get 
into any more details. Interested readers should consult the literature. There are BA 
tables that are separate and different from BD tables. CAD/CAM systems provide tables 
for K-Factor, BA, and BD for most commonly used materials. SolidWorks has these 
tables in this folder:  C:\Program Files\SolidWorks Corp\SolidWorks\lang\english\Sheetmetal 
Bend Tables . It also has gauge tables in another folder:  C:\Program Files\SolidWorks\Solid-
Works\lang\english\Sheet Metal Gauge Tables .

 10.3  Sheet Metal Features 
 The best way to understand sheet metal modeling and design is to ask a simple question: 
How different are sheet metal parts from ordinary parts? From the outset one could trivialize 
modeling of sheet metal parts by recognizing them as simple extrusions connected together. 
(This would obviously be the wrong view of modeling and designing sheet metal parts.) We 
now answer the question. The modeling of sheet metal parts has two unique aspects. First, 
the sheet metal parameters covered in  Section   10.2  must be modeled correctly to ensure 
proper manufacturing (the gauge, the K-Factor, and the bend angles.). Second, we need to 
calculate the length of the flat sheet that we must use to create a final shape; we must be able 
to flatten the sheet metal part that we model (final model) using the K-Factor. 
 In addition to these two aspects, sheet metal modeling should provide features that 
are unique to sheet metal such as bends, flanges, corners, and others. These features 
must be easy to create and incorporate the concepts covered in  Section   10.2  . Solid-
Works provides a comprehensive and easy-to-use sheet metal module with ample fea-
tures.  Figure  10.2 shows these features. 
 The main sheet metal feature is a flange. Think of a flange as an extrusion. Three types 
of flanges exist: base, edge, and miter. A  base flange  is the first flange you create in a sheet 
metal part. An  edge flange is one that is built off an existing edge on a base flange. A  miter 
flange is a flange that connects two panels (sides) of a sheet metal cut at a 45° angle. 
 Figure   10.3  shows the types of sheet metal flanges. Other 
sheet metal features include a tab, a bend, a jog, a corner, a 
rip, a hem, and a lofted bend. A  tab is a subflange that you 
can bend. For example, you can use an edge flange to build a 
tab and then bend it. The first time you click the  Base Flange/
Tab icon shown in  Figure   10.2  , you create a base flange. For 
subsequent clicks, you create a tab each time you click it 
because you can have only one base feature in a part.  
 A  bend is used to bend an existing flange about a bend line. 
The bend is labeled  Sketched Bend  in  Figure  10.2  . A  jog is 
used to add two bends to an existing flange about a bend line. 
Another way to think about it is that a part (defined by the bend 
line) of an existing flange is offset (jogged) up or down, thus 
creating two bends. A  corner is used to treat a bend area, that 
is, weld at the bend corner to stiffen the sheet metal or break/
trim the corner. A  rip creates a gap between two edges. A  hem curls an edge on itself. A 
 lofted-bend is a transition from one shape to another. Think of it as a bend between differ-
ent shapes.  Table   10.1 shows all these sheet metal features and how to create them. 
 In addition to the sheet metal features, the interface shown in  Figure   10.2 offers two 
groups. One group has two typical features:  Extruded Cut  and  Simple Hole . They are 
offered for convenience; otherwise, you have to go to the  Features tab ( Figure   10.2  ) to 
access them. Why only these two features? Because they are the most commonly used in 
the context of sheet metal design. The most common tasks you do for sheet metal is cut 
it, bend it, make cuts in it, and/or make holes in it. The other group has functions related 
to manufacturing:  Unfold ,  Fold , and  Flatten . Flattening is particularly useful because 
it allows you to know the exact dimensions of a sheet metal stock that you need to 
manufacture the final product. You need the flattening because of the K-Factor effect.

 10.4  Sheet Metal FeatureManager Design Tree 
 Thus far in the book,  when we create a base feature in a part, only the feature is cre-
ated as we expect and shows as one node in the part features tree. Sheet metal mod-
eling is different. When we create a base flange feature in a sheet metal part, SolidWorks 
creates a total of three features: the base flange and two supporting features, as shown 
in  Figure   10.4 .  Sheet-Metal1 contains the bend parameters including the bend radius, 
bend allowance, and relief type. Right-click it to edit the default values if needed.

 (B) Bend parameters 
 (C)  Base-Flange1: Flatten state  
 FIGURE 10.4 
 Sheet metal supporting features  

Chapter 10: Sheet Metal and Weldments
303
 Base-Flange1 is the base feature that represents the sheet metal part we want. This 
tree node has two subnodes: the feature sketch and the bend radius.  Flat-Pattern1 
enables you to flatten/unflatten the part. The flat state is suppressed by default; Solid-
Works shows the part in its bent state. To flatten the part, click the  Flat-Pattern1 
node and select the  Unsuppress icon from the context toolbar that pops up (hover on 
icons to read them). When you exit the flat state (click the exit icon shown on the top 
right of screen), it puts the part back in its bent state. You can achieve the same result 
by clicking the  Flatten icon shown in  Figure   10.2 , once to flatten and again to bend 
(the icon is a toggle) . Note that when you flatten the part, the new features you create 
are inserted below the  Flat-Pattern1 node in the features tree; otherwise, they are 
inserted above it.       
 10.5  Sheet Metal Methods 
 There are four methods to create sheet metal parts: 
  
1.  Create a sheet metal part using the sheet metal features covered in  Section   10.4  
and shown in  Table   10.1  . Here, you start by creating a base flange and add the 
needed sheet metal features until the part is complete.  
  
2.  Create a sheet metal part by converting a solid body: After we create a solid as 
usual, use  Insert (menu) >  Sheet Metal > Convert To Sheet Metal . This requires 
a fixed face and edges that are planar with the fixed face. These are the bend edges 
that are used to create the sheet metal part.  Figure   10.5  shows an example. We 
select the bottom face as the fixed face and its four edges as the bend edges. When 
you select the face and its edges, SolidWorks selects the four vertical edges as the 
rip edges to create the sheet metal part.   
 (B) Resulting sheet metal part  
 FIGURE 10.5 
 Converting a solid part to a sheet metal part 
 (A) Solid part and input  
  
3.  Convert a shelled solid body to a sheet metal part: This method requires a shelled 
solid. After we have the shelled solid, we use  Insert Bends to create the sheet 
metal part. Following is the sequence of using this method. 

304
Chapter 10: Sheet Metal and Weldments
 Step 3:  Create the sheet metal part:  Insert Bends on 
 Sheet Metal tab > select shown face as a fixed face > 
select shown edge to rip.  
 Step 1:  Create an extrusion: Create the sketch shown 
on  Front Plane and extrude it.  
  
4.  Design a sheet metal part from the flattened state: In this method, you create the 
sheet metal as one sketch and then create bend lines (in another sketch) where you 
want to bend (fold) the flat sheet (sketch) to create the part. The following steps 
show how to use this method. 
 
 
 Step 2:  Shell the extrusion:  Shell on  Features tab > 
select front and back faces of extrusion > enter 4 (mm) 
for shell thickness.

 10.6  Weldments 
 Welding  is a fabrication process that joins metal (steel, aluminum) or thermoplastic 
components together by melting the joints (workpieces) and adding a filler material to 
mix with the joints’ materials. When the joints are cooled down, a strong joint connec-
tion is created. Example products that use welds are metal frames used in building con-
struction, exhaust system and pipes of a car, campfire grill, trailer dolly, rainwater 
system (house gutters), heat exchangers, and condensers. 
 Welding processes include gas welding, arc welding, spot welding, resistance weld-
ing, solid state welding, and others. All these processes have one thing in common: They 
all require an energy source to heat up and melt the weld joints and the filler material. 

306
Chapter 10: Sheet Metal and Weldments
They all differ in the source of generating the energy (e.g., gas, electric arc, resistance). 
For example, gas welding burns gas to generate very hot flames to melt and fuse metal 
joints with the filler material. You probably have seen or used one of those small portable 
cylinders that burns propane and produces a flame torch that you can use for welding. 
 Welding equipment and supplies include welding machines, cylinders, spot weld-
ers, cutters, torches, welding hoods (to contain fumes), grinders, filler metals, air com-
pressors, cutting guides, clamps and holders, and safety equipment. Gas welding uses 
gas cylinders that are filled with gas (propane) under high pressure. These cylinders are 
regulated and follow strict standards and codes. 
 Weld defects can occur, and they include inclusions, segregation, and porosity. 
 Inclusions are impurities of foreign substances that get into the weld puddle (area of 
molten metal) during welding and become embedded in the weld joints after they solid-
ify. These inclusions have the same effect as cracks because they are typically much 
weaker than the weld joint material.  Segregation is a condition in which the weld pud-
dle does not have uniform metal mix. For example, there may not be enough filler mate-
rial flowing uniformly in the puddle.  Porosity is the formation of voids or tiny pinholes 
that result from trapping air bubbles in the puddle. 
 Weld joints can be inspected to assess joint quality. Nondestructive examination 
(NDE) methods are used to inspect weld joints. These methods include visual, liquid 
penetration, magnetic particle, ultrasonic, and X-ray (radiographic). These methods 
allow us to “see through” weld joints to look for inclusions, segregation, and porosity. 
 If welding is all about connecting weld joints together, what kind of weld joints can 
we design and use? There are many types of weld joints, and  Figure   10.6  shows the

common types. The parts that are welded are shown with a number in a circle. The weld 
puddle (area) is shown as hatched. 
 Which joint type is best suited for a particular application? The answer depends on 
many factors. Weld joints are designed primarily to meet strength and safety require-
ments. Other considerations in selecting the type of weld joint design are the joint load 
and the ratio of the joint strength to the base metal strength. The type (tension or com-
pression) and amount of the load that the joint carries determine the joint type. For 
example, if we have a vertical compression load at the joint, a butt joint would be a weak 
joint, whereas a corner or a lap joint would be better and stronger. The strength ratio 
could be used to determine the safer mode of failure of the weld joint. For example, we 
could use a butt joint that shears off first before the welded parts themselves fail.  
 We refer to the welded parts as  weldments . A  weldment is a part we design using 
CAD/CAM systems. Weldments can take various shapes such as structural members and 
blocks. You can use 2D and 3D sketches to define the basic framework of a weldment 
structure. After you define the frame, you create the structural members and add gus-
sets, and end gaps. The following section provides more details.  
 10.7  Weldment Features 
 Welded parts are mostly structures consisting of frames or trusses, that is, skeletons. 
Each frame consists of members that are welded (connected) together. The frames usu-
ally form a 3D sketch. After creating the frame (skeleton), we add cross sections to it to 
create the structural members, followed by creating the weld joints, and closing the 
members’ ends (if needed). Thus, the modeling steps of creating welded parts (weld-
ments) are as follows: 
  
1.  Create the weld frame:    Use a 2D or 3D sketch depending on the frame design at 
hand. 
  
2.  Create the structural members:    Each member uses a cross section. These members 
trace the frame shape. Think of it as adding meat (members) to the bones (frame 
skeleton). 
  
3.  Create the weld joints:    Add the welded joints based on their types ( Figure   10.6  ). 
Also, stiffen the joints (if needed) by adding ribs.  
  
4.  Close the ends of the members if needed:    Use end caps to close the open ends of the 
weld structure. These ends are welded onto the open ends of the structure.  
 As with sheet metal modeling, modeling welded parts requires unique features such 
as weld joints, stiffeners, and end caps. These features must be easy to use. SolidWorks 
provides a comprehensive and easy-to-use  Weldments  module with ample features. 
 Figure   10.7  A shows these features. The features come in three groups: base, weld-
specific, and generic. The base feature is the Weldment feature shown in  Figure   10.7  B. 
It is not a feature in the common sense that we know such as extrusion or revolve. You 
cannot edit the Weldment feature, but you can delete it (right-click it in a features tree 
to see what you can do with it). Think of the Weldment feature as a container that sets 
up the weldment modeling environment in SolidWorks and designates the part as a 
weldment. All the features of a welded part (see  Figure   10.7  C) you create become 
 children of the Weldment (parent) feature in the features tree. If you delete the parent, 
all its children are deleted with it. 
 The second group of Weldment features shown in  Figure   10.7 A is the weld-specific 
features. They are Structural Member, Trim/Extend, End Cap, Gusset, and Weld Bead. A 
 Structural Member sweeps a predefined (by SolidWorks) cross section (profile) along 
user-defined paths created using sketching. The profiles follow industry standards. 

308
Chapter 10: Sheet Metal and Weldments
SolidWorks provides drop-down lists to select from to ensure adherence to these stand-
ards. You would need to select the type of standard (ANSI or ISO), the profile type (C 
channel, pipe, square tube), and the profile size. You can group structural members as you 
create them. When you delete one member of the group, the entire group is deleted.   
 A  Trim/Extend  feature closes the structural members by trimming or extending 
them relative to each other to create a coherent, integrated welded part. An  End Cap 
feature closes the open-end faces of structural members. This is useful if you want to 
prevent any foreign materials (water, debris) from going inside the structural members 
of a welded part. A  Gusset is a rib that you add between two adjoining planar faces to 
stiffen a weld joint. Adding gussets between faces has strict requirements. You cannot 
add gussets between nonplanar faces or faces that do not share edges. We leave the 
details of creating gussets to the tutorials. A  Weld Bead creates a fillet joint between two 
structural members. 
 The third and final group of Weldment features shown in  Figure   10.7  A is the generic 
features. These are features  we  have already used before in modeling any parts. They are 
included as part of the  Weldments tab as a convenience to the designer to circumvent 
going to the  Features  tab to grab them from there. These features are the ones most 
commonly needed in the context of designing welded parts. As shown in  Figure   10.7  A, 
they are  Extruded Boss/Base, Extruded Cut, Hole Wizard, Chamfer , and  Reference 
Geometry . Another important item of the generic group is the  3D Sketch  icon that we 
use to create the frame of a welded part.  Table   10.2  shows the SolidWorks Weldment 
features and how to create them.

 10.8  Weld Symbols 
 The Weld Bead feature in  Table   10.2  shows a weld symbol with the fillet size (3 mm). 
We need to understand these weld symbols because we use them in welding engineer-
ing drawings to specify the weld joint type and parameters. There are ISO and ANSI 
weld symbols.  Table   10.3  shows SolidWorks ISO weld symbols.  Table   10.4  shows 
SolidWorks ANSI weld symbols. Note that all these symbols can also be displayed in an 
upside-down fashion (have identification line on top as shown for the first symbol in 
 Table  10.3 ) to accommodate the other style and preference of displaying.

Tutorial 10–2:  Create Sheet Metal Drawing 
 This tutorial covers the basic sheet metal drawing options. We create the sheet metal 
drawing shown in  Figure   10.9  . A sheet metal drawing is like any typical drawing, but 
with one difference: We can create a flat pattern view in the drawing that has special 
notes that tell how the sheet metal is created from the flat pattern. For example,  Figure 
 10.9 shows three “UP 90° R 0.03” indicating that the corresponding flat pattern is bent 
upward a 90° angle at the three edges shown, with a bend radius of 0.03 inch. Similarly, 
the “DOWN 90° R 0.03” indicates that the side wall is bent down a 90° angle at the edge 
shown, with a bend radius of 0.03 inch.

Tutorial 10–4:  Create Sheet Metal Part from Flattened State 
 This tutorial covers the ability to create a sheet metal part, shown in  Figure   10.11  , by 
sketching a base flange in flat state and bending it. The model is created by sketching 
a base flange on one sketch, sketching bend lines on a separate sketch, and folding the 
flange using the bend lines. All dimensions are in inches. 
 
 Note:  The system decides on rip edges to use to 
break open the solid. Unsuppress the  Flat-Pattern1 
node to view sheet metal as shown.

Tutorial 10–6:  Create Weldment Drawing 
 This tutorial covers the basic weldment drawing operations. We create the drawing 
shown in  Figure   10.13  for the weldment created in Tutorial 10–5. The drawing shows a 
 Relative To Model  view to the right of the ISO view. We need two orientations to fully 
define the new view relative to the existing model. The first face we select in Step 8 de-
fines the front (by default) of the new view. The second face we select in Step 8 defines 
the right (by default) of the new view.

 Sustainable Design  
 11.1  Introduction 
 Not too long ago engineering design would focus on in-service requirements such as 
functional and strength requirements. Today, design must also consider stringent envi-
ronmental requirements and the handling of products after their “death.” The central 
question is, What do you do with products after they reach the end of their useful life? 
Even during their useful life, products must conform to limited natural resources and be 
evaluated especially in terms of energy consumption and pollution. 
 Sustainable design represents a paradigm shift in how we design products. It is a 
direct outcome of strict regulations on the environment, the use of natural resources, 
limited landfills for waste collection, hazardous material, health concerns, and other fac-
tors. Designers must think hard about product use and disposal including health effects 
and environmental impact. A good example is electronics and computer devices. Design-
ers are trying to phase out components that represent health hazards by using new 
materials that are more environmentally friendly. 
 Sustainable design addresses two product design concerns: during life (in serv-
ice) and after life (end of service). During life, a product must meet a host of environ-
mental and energy constraints. For the environment, the product must minimize 
pollution and the greenhouse effect as much as possible. Some of the pollution meas-
ures include carbon dioxide emission, water pollution, and air pollution. Energy 
consumed by products must also be minimized by making products as efficient as 
possible. 
 Designing and producing sustainable products require sustainable design, sustain-
able manufacturing, and sustainable waste. We cover sustainable design in detail in this 
chapter. Sustainable design determines to a large extent sustainable waste (fewer emis-
sions and less pollution of the environment). Sustainable manufacturing is controlled by 
materials used and the manufacturing processes themselves. In practice, the common 
sustainability factor is energy use in manufacturing and transporting products, as well as 
the energy the products use while in service. 
 After life, a product must equally meet a host of disposal constraints. Components 
of discarded products must be easy to disassemble and sort for refurbishing, recycling, 
and disposal. We are all familiar with the many products labeled “recycled” or with the 
recycle symbol. Examples include paper, printer cartridges, and many plastic products. 
Refurbished (also known as  rebuilt ) components are common in the automotive indus-
try where we may buy a refurbished alternator, water pump, or brake calipers for a car. 
As for the disposed components, we try to minimize them in product design as much as 
possible. 
 CHAPTER 
11 

326
Chapter 11: Sustainable Design
 Sustainable engineering has been used as a broader context that includes sustainable 
design. Other terms have been used for sustainable design such as  ecodesign ,  environmen-
tally sustainable design ,  environmentally conscious design , and  green design . The latter two 
terms are borrowed from the manufacturing field where the terms  environmentally con-
scious manufacturing  and  green manufacturing have been used to promote less polluting 
manufacturing methods and products that are easy to disassemble and reuse. 
 Minimizing energy consumption and using renewable energy (such as wind and 
solar energy) are important to sustainable design. The less we depend on nonrenewable 
energy such as fossil fuels (oil and gas), the better we preserve our natural resources. 
The difference between renewable and nonrenewable energy is the time required to 
generate the energy. Fossil fuels take millions of years to form because we must wait for 
the decomposition of buried dead organisms. Fossil fuels contain a high percentage of 
carbon and hydrocarbon, two excellent sources of energy. 
 In order for us to learn and perform sustainable design tasks, we need to be aware 
of and learn the many sustainable aspects including technologies, materials, manufac-
turing methods, and energy resources. Designers can think only in terms of what they 
know. For example, the more materials we know (e.g., metals, plastics, ceramics), the 
better material we can select. 
 Successful and effective sustainable design tools, like many other engineering tools, 
are the ones that quantify the sustainability concepts. Designers would like to have design 
tools that allow them to compare different design alternatives to find the best one. The 
SolidWorks  Sustainability module fits this bill. It is a great start in the right direction. 
 We may ask ourselves this question before we continue: What is sustainable engi-
neering or design? According to the WEPSD (World Engineering Partnership for Sus-
tainable Development),  sustainable engineering is the melting pot (integration) of 
three disciplines (fields): environmental, economical, and social. The use of these three 
fields in design defines  sustainable design , which makes designers environmentally 
conscious about their designs.  Environmental sustainability  is defined as meeting the 
needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet 
their needs. 
 An important source when it comes to sustainability is the Brundtland Report pub-
lished by the Brundtland Commission, formerly known as the World Commission on 
Environment and Development (WCED). The commission, created by the United 
Nations in 1983, began as a response to the growing concern about the deterioration of 
the global environment and the need for immediate action. The Brundtland Report, also 
known as  Our Common Future , was published by Oxford University Press in 1987. The 
commission report addressed both the need for promoting sustainable development and 
the need for the change of policies to achieve sustainable development at the world 
level. For more information, visit  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brundtland_Commission  and 
 www.un-documents.net/a42r187.htm . 
 11.2  Design and Society 
 We always practice engineering (in a broader sense) and design (in a narrower sense) 
within societal contexts. Engineering is inherently tied to society and human needs. 
Engineering design evolves over time and reflects societal needs and concerns. As soci-
ety evolves, so does engineering design. Societal impact, in positive ways, is always the 
main drive behind engineering design. 
 Over time, societal needs and priorities shift and pull design along with them. Let 
us consider a few scenarios. When manufacturing cost became a concern in the 1980s 
and 1990s, there was a push for better ways to make high-quality products that are less 

Chapter 11: Sustainable Design
327
expensive. Thus, concepts such as DFA (design for assembly), DFM (design for manu-
facturing), and concurrent engineering evolved, flourished, and were embraced by the 
engineering profession. Similarly, the concept of six sigma was conceived and adopted 
to improve product quality. 
 When societies across the globe began to push for environmental awareness and 
concerns, the “green” movement made its way to design. We may use the term  DFS 
(design for sustainability) for sustainable design because it extends the broader concept 
behind DFA, DFM, concurrent engineering, and six sigma; that is, to adapt the engineer-
ing design process and its activities to address current societal concerns.  
 11.3  Guidelines and Principles 
 Guidelines for sustainable design have been evolving and developing and will continue to 
do so over time. They are mostly qualitative. The following guidelines are commonly used: 
  A.  Minimize energy consumption:     Design products that require less energy to operate. 
For example, hybrid cars offer high gas mileage. Another example is the prolong-
ing of battery life in many products, and a third example is Energy Star (energy-
efficient) household appliances.  
  B.  Use safe materials:     Use materials that have low impact on the environment during 
processing or after discarding products. For example, use nontoxic, recyclable 
materials that require little energy to process and manufacture. Also, use materials 
coming from recyclable resources as much as possible such as metal, aluminum, 
or paper.  
  C.  Use efficient manufacturing processes:     Use processes that are fast to complete and for 
which the equipment consumes less energy. Also, these processes should have 
minimum pollution and other adverse environmental impacts.  
  D.  Minimize or reduce product carbon footprint to protect outdoor air quality:     A  carbon 
footprint of a product is defined as the total set of greenhouse gas (GHG) emis-
sions caused by the product. It is expressed in terms of the amount of emitted 
carbon dioxide equivalent. The word  equivalent means including methane, carbon 
monoxide, and other greenhouse gases. Carbon footprint can also be defined for a 
company, an organization, or a nation. Strategies to reduce carbon footprint of a 
product include using better process and product management, better energy 
consumption strategies, and alternative renewable energies. The mitigation of 
carbon footprints is often known as carbon offsetting. 
 Carbon footprints exist today for many products. They have been calculated 
by different organizations and countries. For example, the U.S. EPA (Environmen-
tal Protection Agency) has addressed paper, plastic wrappers for candy, glass, cans, 
computers, carpet, and tires. The U.S. Postal Service has addressed mailing letters 
and packages. Australia has addressed lumber and other building materials.  
  E.  Use life cycle assessment (LCA):     LCA is defined as a method to quantitatively assess 
the environmental impact of a product throughout its entire life cycle, from the 
procurement of raw materials to production, distribution, use, disposal, and 
recycling of the product. Design impact measures for LCA for any product use are 
increasingly required and available. LCA includes many product facets including 
energy consumption and environmental impact.  
  F.  Reuse and recycling:    Products, processes, and systems should be designed for 
recycling and reuse, that is, design for reuse and recycle (DFR2). We use many 
products today that are recyclable. Today, recycling is an important part of our 
personal daily routine and habits. Good examples are soda can and printer car-
tridge recycling programs.  

328
Chapter 11: Sustainable Design
  G.  Increase quality and durability:    The less frequently we have to replace and repair 
products, the more energy and resources we save.  
  H.  Share resources:     We should design products for public ownership (sharing) 
instead of private ownership (e.g., carpooling or car rental).  
  
I.  Create healthy buildings:    Although not a mechanical product, buildings and houses 
form an important sustainable design problem. We need to design healthy build-
ings that are harmful neither to their occupants nor to the environment. For 
example, indoor air quality and energy-efficient buildings are important design 
goals.  
 To promote the preceding design guidelines necessary for sustainability, the “Han-
nover Principles” (also known as the “Bill of Rights for the Planet”) were adopted in the 
EXPO 2000 held in Hannover, Germany. We cast these principles in terms of engineer-
ing design as follows: 
  
1.  Humanity and nature must coexist in a healthy, sustainable way.  
  
2.  Engineering design interacts with and depends on the natural world and, as such, 
must consider implications on the environment.  
  
3.  Engineering design (matter and human elements) must respect and coexist with 
nature (spirit). As such, engineers must protect and conserve air and water 
quality.  
  
4.  Engineering design is responsible for the consequences of its decisions on human 
well-being, the viability of natural resources, and their right to coexist.  
  
5.  Engineering design should be held accountable for future damage to the environ-
ment. Engineers should not burden future generations with potential damage and 
danger due to careless creation of products, processes, and standards.  
  
6.  Eliminate waste. Optimize product life cycle as much as possible to eliminate the 
concept of waste.  
  
7.  Use renewable energy sources as much as possible. Rely on natural energy flow 
such as solar and wind energies. Minimize the consumption of nonrenewable fossil 
energy. 
  
8.  Engineering design should respect nature as a superpower. No matter how bril-
liant human design is, it is still limited and does not solve all problems. As such, 
we must treat nature as a role model and mentor, not as an enemy to conquer and 
control.  
  
9.  Promote communication and knowledge sharing. All involved in LCA and product 
development should communicate openly to integrate sustainable considerations 
and integrate natural processes with human design and activity.  
 In addition to this bill of rights for the planet, in 1993 the World Congress of the 
International Union of Architects (UIA) and the American Institute of Architects (AIA) 
signed a “Declaration of Interdependence for a Sustainable Future.” Visit  server.uia-
architectes.org/texte/england/2aaf1.html . The declaration states that today’s society is 
degrading its environment and that the UIA, AIA, and their members are committed to 
the following: 
  
1.  Professionals are responsible for environmental and social sustainability.  
  
2.  Promote sustainable design via developing and improving practices, products, 
services, and standards.  
  
3.  Disseminate the value of sustainable design via educating the general public.  
  
4.  Help support sustainable design practices by working to change policies, regula-
tions, and standards in government and businesses.  
  
5.  Bring the existing built environment and codes to sustainable design standards.

 11.4  Life Cycle Assessment 
 Successful products are developed by integrating LCA directly into the engineering 
design process. LCA is commonly known as “cradle to grave” analysis. Although this 
extent of assessment is desirable to achieve, some products may be assessed based on 
“cradle to gate” or some other variation.  Figure   11.1  shows a typical product life cycle. 
The main stages of the cycle are the procurement of the raw materials through produc-
tion, distribution, use, disposal, and recycling. The details of these stages are described 
as follows: 
  
1.  Raw material extraction:     Different procurement and extraction methods exist, 
depending on the type of material needed. For wood, we plant, grow, and 
harvest (cut) the trees. For metals, we mine raw ore. For plastics, we drill and 
pump oil.  
  
2.  Material processing:     This phase converts raw materials into engineering materials 
ready for use in manufacturing. Wood requires cleaning and slicing the trees into 
wood slabs. Metals require, for example, converting ore to steel and bauxite into 
aluminum. Plastics require converting oil to plastics.  
  
3.  Part manufacturing:     Manufacturing processes materials into finished goods or parts. 
Wood processing makes wooden products such as furniture. Metal processing 
converts metal to steel columns and aluminum to soda cans. Injection molding 
and stamping convert plastics to toys.   
  
4.  Assembly:     Finished parts are assembled to create the final product.

Chapter 11: Sustainable Design
  
5.  Product use:     Intended end consumers use the products for their intended life span. 
This use may involve gasoline, electricity, and other resources.  
  
6.  End of life (EOL):    When a product is discarded (deceased), it should be processed 
(buried) in an environmentally conscious way. Ideally, we should disassemble the 
product and decide which parts (components) of the product should be recycled, 
thrown into landfills for decomposition over time, or incinerated for energy 
recovery to minimize damage to the environment.  
 A product LCA evaluates the effects that a product has on the environment over its 
entire life period, thus increasing resource-use efficiency and decreasing environment 
liabilities. The LCA has an IQ (Identify and Quantify) and an impact (Evaluate and 
Assess). Thus, the LCA key elements are as follows: 
  
1.  Identify:     Find the environmental loads that we need to assess and evaluate. These 
loads could include raw materials, energy, emissions, and generated waste needed 
and consumed by the product throughout its life cycle.  
  
2.  Quantify:     Find and use the appropriate formulas, charts, and other tools to calcu-
late the environmental loads. For example, quantification of carbon footprint for 
many products already exists, as we have covered in  Section   11.3  . 
  
3.  Evaluate:     With quantification numbers at hand, we are able to evaluate the impact 
of the environmental loads.  
  
4.  Assess:     Repeat Steps 1 through 3 for available options, and assess these options to 
reduce the environmental impact.  
 Unlike human IQ, the lower the IQ for LCA, the more sustainable and environmen-
tally friendly the LCA is. 
 11.5  Impact Metric 
 The impact on the environment of making a product comes from three categories: mate-
rials, methods, and systems. We associate materials with product design, methods with 
product manufacturing processes, and systems with product transportation and use 
during its useful life and EOL.  Figure   11.1  clearly shows these three categories. We 
assert here that material selection is a key factor that determines the level of environ-
mental impact of making a product and therefore determines its degree of sustainability. 
This is because material selection affects the product making, transportation, use, and 
EOL fate. For example, material selection (metal or plastic) affects the product manufac-
turing process (machining or injection molding). Material selection also affects the prod-
uct logistics and transportation through its different phases from transporting materials, 
to plants, to shipping product, to end consumers. Some materials may be easier and 
faster to ship to manufacturing, thus reducing the carbon footprint. Finally, material 
selection controls the EOL fate of the product. 
 If the material selection is crucial, how can we then assess the impact of different 
materials on the environment? In other words, how can we measure the sustainability of 
a design based on material selection? We define an impact metric with the following five 
impact factors: 
  
1.  Carbon footprint:     CO 2 and other gases result from burning fossil fuels. These 
carbon gases are trapped in the atmosphere, resulting in air pollution and in 
raising the earth’s average temperature. Carbon footprint is measured in kilograms 
of CO 2 equivalent. Carbon footprint has very serious environmental repercussions 
and is responsible for the global warming effect that causes loss of glaciers, extinc-
tion of species, and extreme weather swings.  

Chapter 11: Sustainable Design
331
  
2.  Energy consumption:    This impact factor is measured by the amount of nonrenew-
able (bad) energy (e.g., petroleum, fossil fuel, coal) that a product consumes 
throughout its life cycle. This consumption is measured in MJ (megajoules). This 
impact factor includes all the energies that a product requires to be manufactured, 
transported, and used during its life cycle. The calculation of the product energy 
consumption takes into account the efficiencies in energy conversion.  
  
3.  Air acidification:     In addition to releasing CO 2 into the air we breathe, burning of 
nonrenewable fuels produces other harmful gases including sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) 
and nitrous oxide (NO X ). These and other acidic emissions to the air result in acid 
rain. Acid rain has serious consequences on the environment including making 
land and water toxic for human and animal uses as well as for aquatic life and 
wildlife. Acid rain also eats into and dissolves building materials such as concrete. 
The unit of measuring the air acidification is kilograms of sulfur dioxide equivalent 
(SO 2 e) for the CML methodology. Other units of measurement exist for other 
impact assessment methodologies. The two most commonly used life cycle impact 
methodologies are CML and TRACI. CML stands for Centrum voor Milieukunde 
Leiden (a Dutch university). For more information about CML, visit  cml.leiden.
edu/software/data-cmlia.html . TRACI stands for Tool for the Reduction and 
Assessment of Chemical and Other Environmental Impacts. For more information 
about TRACI, visit  www.epa.gov/nrmrl/std/traci/traci.html . 
  
4.  Water eutrophication:     This impact factor measures water pollution that is not 
related to acid rain, but to dumping societal waste into the water ecosystem. For 
example, water waste from manufacturing plants and agricultural fertilizers 
contains high levels of nitrogen (N) and phosphate (also known as phosphorus) 
(PO 4 ). Both cause more algae to grow in water, which depletes oxygen from 
water, causing the death of plants and fish. The unit of measuring water eutrophi-
cation is kilograms of phosphate equivalent (PO 4 e) for the CML methodology. 
Other units of measurement exist for other impact assessment methodologies 
such as TRACI.  
  
5.  Water footprint:     Worldwide consumption of water has put pressure on the aquatic 
systems and resulted in dramatic shortage and deterioration of the global water 
supply, just as the nonrenewable fuels have done to the earth and the atmosphere. 
Water consumed by companies to make products is an important factor in both 
company and product sustainability. An analysis of the water footprint of a 
product can be calculated. The unit of measuring water footprint is cubic meters 
per year. You can calculate national, corporate, or individual (personal) water 
footprint.

 11.6  Implementation 
 The implementation of the LCA is guided by ISO: International Organization for Stand-
ardization ( www.iso.org ). ISO has multiple sustainable standards. ISO 14040/44 pro-
vides the LCA principles and framework. ISO 14062 is concerned with greenhouse 
assessment. ISO 14025 deals with Type III eco-label and IPCC national inventories. 

332
Chapter 11: Sustainable Design
 The implementation of LCA provides a systematic approach for identifying, quanti-
fying, and assessing environmental impacts through the life cycle of a product, process, 
or activity. This implementation considers material and energy uses and releases to the 
environment from “cradle to grave.” The goal of LCA use is to identify “hot spots” of 
potential environmental impact, compare one or more aspects of a product or process, 
and establish a baseline for further research and comparisons. 
 LCA is only one of the tools used in environmental decision making. We generally 
use it in conjunction with other tools such as risk assessment. There are also other life 
cycle approaches besides LCA. LCA does not necessarily embody every approach 
called for. 
 The application and use of LCA require substantial efforts. First, we need to under-
stand the principles and the concepts. Next, we need to quantify the LCA impact factors 
as we have discussed. Third, we need to collect lots of data about many materials, proc-
esses, systems, transportations, regulations in different countries, and other issues. 
Then, we need to build the LCI (life cycle inventory) database or library that houses all 
that data. Finally, we write software tools that designers can use during their design 
activities. 
 Although LCA can contribute to improved environmental decision making to pro-
duce better sustainable designs and products, we offer a word of caution. LCA comes 
with its own pitfalls. LCA users need to maximize the potential benefits of LCA. Design-
ers and their companies need to be clear on the objectives of their LCA and the measures 
of success. Designers and their companies need to recognize that LCA provides only one 
component of a more comprehensive decision-making process, and that understanding 
the trade-offs between required resources and the LCA demands is important. After all, 
our goal as engineers and designers is to make products that are both affordable and 
sustainable.  
 11.7  Design Activities 
 Thus far, we have a set of sustainability concepts that are ready for use in our design 
activities. These concepts are as follows: 
  A.  We have identified materials, processes, and systems as key elements that affect 
sustainable design.  
  B.  We have concluded that materials are the decisive and driving element in sustain-
able design because they directly control the choices of processes and systems.  
  C.  We have also identified the impact factors that affect the environment significantly.  
  D.  We have quantified the impact factors, meaning we can compute their environ-
mental impact. 
 We now need to put these concepts in a systematic and logical order to provide 
designers with tools to enable designers to perform LCA, and create and evaluate sus-
tainable designs. The following steps embody this order: 
  
1.  Create part design:    Create a part  as we have covered so far in the book . 
  
2.  Select material:    Assign the part a material.  
  
3.  Select manufacturing processes:    Based on the material selection, decide on the 
appropriate manufacturing processes.  
  
4.  Select system:    This includes the part transportation and the intended region of the 
world where the part is to be used.  
  
5.  Set baseline:   Calculate the impact factors covered in  Section   11.5  . This sets a 
baseline for sustainable design. We use this baseline to compare the selections of 
different materials. 

Chapter 11: Sustainable Design

6.  Repeat Steps 2 through 5:    Calculate the impact factors for the new material selection.  
  
7.  Repeat Step 6 as many times as needed:   Do this until a satisfactory sustainable design 
is achieved. If needed, redesign the part (Step 1).  
 11.8  Sustainable Design Tools 
 Tools for sustainable design are particularly important for both academia and industry. 
These tools are most useful when they are quantitative to enable designers in practice to 
evaluate their sustainable design alternatives and options. These tools are also useful for 
educating students, future engineers, of the importance of sustainability and making 
them aware of the environmental impact of engineering design. 
 Two of these tools are available in the form of software. They are offered by 
SolidWorks and PE International. SolidWorks offers two sustainability modules: 
 SustainabilityXpress and  Sustainability . They both evaluate the environmental 
impact of a design throughout the life cycle of a product. You can compare results 
from different designs to ensure a sustainable solution for the product and the envi-
ronment.  SustainabilityXpress analyzes parts only and is a standard option with 
SolidWorks core software.  Sustainability  provides more comprehensive in-depth 
analysis (more impact factors and expanding reports) and provides designers with 
more control and the ability to analyze both parts and assemblies (including configu-
rations). These two modules are similar to SolidWorks FEM/FEA modules: 
 SimulationXpress and  Simulation . 
 PE International offers comprehensive sustainability solutions. Developed in-house 
over the course of thousands of sustainability consulting projects, PE International’s 
comprehensive sustainability software solutions are designed to support cost-effective 
corporate and product sustainability projects. PE’s GaBi sustainability software offers 
practicing engineers effective tools to aid them in their sustainable design tasks. Inter-
ested readers may visit  www.gabi-software.com/america/solutions/life-cycle-assessment
/?gclid=CPiowIzC4rwCFTIV7Aodsg0Apg  
 11.9  SolidWorks SustainabilityXpress 
 SolidWorks implements the concepts of sustainable design in its  SustainabilityXpress 
module. It uses only the first four impact factors (carbon footprint, energy consumption, 
air acidification, and water eutrophication) of  Section   11.5  . SolidWorks generates a 
report for the impact factors. SolidWorks  SustainabilityXpress measures the environ-
mental impact based on material used, manufacturing process and region, use region, 
and EOL. 
 SolidWorks  SustainabilityXpress has incorporated extensive libraries of mate-
rials, manufacturing processes, and transportations from PE International ( www.
pe-international.com ). Designers select from these libraries to investigate various sus-
tainable scenarios. Moreover, SolidWorks has a library of manufacturing regions to 
select a region from. Different regions have different environmental regulations and 
laws. For example, designers may select a manufacturing region and/or transportation/
use region. 
 SolidWorks  SustainabilityXpress follows the design steps covered in  Section 
 11.7  . In addition, SolidWorks  SustainabilityXpress provides a dashboard to display 
and compare results. It also enables the designer to print reports of the impact factor 
calculations and the sustainable design.  Figure  11.2  shows SolidWorks sustainability 
methodology.

and   11.3B are blank; yet after a designer specifies the three key elements ( Figure   11.3A  ), 
the dashboard areas ( Figure   11.3B  ) populate with the results. Use the  Save As  icon 
shown in  Figure  11.3B  to generate sustainability reports.  
 One interesting aspect of SolidWorks sustainability calculations is that they take 
into consideration the region where the product is made (manufacturing and transpor-
tation) and used (use). Both of these areas are affected by a host of regional issues such 
as cost, environmental regulations, natural resources, type of energy used (fossil, nuclear, 
hydroelectric, etc.), transportation infrastructure, traffic patterns, and cultural habits. 
Sample regions that SolidWorks has implemented are North America, Europe, Asia, 
Japan, South America, Australia, and India. 
 SolidWorks sustainability analysis begins with selecting the key elements and ends 
with the values of the environmental impact factors. The designer may perform para-
metric studies (“what if” scenarios) to find the “best” sustainable design. The steps of this 
sustainability analysis are as follows: 
  
1.  Create the CAD model of the part to be designed.  
  
2.  Select the material class and name. SolidWorks supports a wide variety of material 
classes (e.g., steel, iron, aluminum, copper, titanium, zinc, plastics, fibers, silicon, 
and wood). Within each class are multiple materials. For example, the class of 
plastics includes ABS, PVC, nylon, and many others. Check  SustainabilityXpress 
for a full list of classes and materials.  
  
3.  Select a manufacturing process. For each material class, possible manufacturing 
processes that can manufacture this class are supported by SolidWorks. For 
example, injection molding and extrusion processes exist for plastics. For the 
aluminum class, many processes exist including die casting, extrusion, milling, 
turning, forging, and stamping. Check  SustainabilityXpress for a full list of 
available manufacturing processes.  
  
4.  Select the manufacturing region. The region selection determines the type of 
energy used (how much clean renewable energy and how much nonrenewable 
energy) and the resources consumed by the manufacturing processes.  
  
5.  Select the transportation and use region. A region selection here determines the 
environmental impact associated with transporting the product from its manu-
facturing location to its use location. It also affects the energy resources needed 
by the product while in use and its EOL destiny (landfill, incineration, and/or 
recycling).  
  
6.  Calculate environmental impact. SolidWorks  SustainabilityXpress uses the input 
from Steps 2 through 5 and calculates the four impact factors: carbon footprint, 
energy consumption, air acidification, and water eutrophication.  
  
7.  Set baseline. You need to explicitly identify the results from Step 6 as baseline. 
SolidWorks  SustainabilityXpress uses this baseline as a reference to compare 
multiple sustainable designs. If you want to use different results for baseline, you 
may import them as shown in  Figure   11.3  B. 
  
8.  Redesign. If the environmental results in Step 6 are high, select a new material 
(Step 2) and repeat Steps 3 through 6. Make design changes as necessary.  
  
9.  Evaluate the results. Use the baseline established in Step 7 to evaluate the results 
from Step 8.  
 SolidWorks  SustainabilityXpress provides an online calculator that enables you to 
convert the environmental impact, as measured by the values of the four impact factors, 
into human measurable parameters. For example, convert carbon footprint into miles 
driven by a car. Click the  Online Info  icon shown in  Figure   11.3  B to access the online 
calculator shown in  Figure   11.4  .

 11.10  Tutorials 
 The theme for the tutorials in this chapter is to practice using sustainable design con-
cepts implemented by SolidWorks  SustainabilityXpress . The following tutorial helps 
assess the impact of a design on the environment. 
 
Tutorial 11–1:  Redesign a Steel Washer 
 Figure   11.5 shows the dimensions of a washer (OD, ID, and thickness in 
inches) made out of carbon steel. The washer must be replaced by another 
material such as aluminum or plastic to meet new EOL environmental con-
straints of recycling. Investigate which design is better for the environment. 
The washer is used in North America. Also, currently the steel washer is 
manufactured in Asia. The new washer could be manufactured in Asia, 
Europe, or Japan. Which of these regions is the best to produce the new 
washer? 
 We need to perform sustainable design evaluation on the washer to find 
out which new material is better (aluminum or plastic) and which manu-
facturing region is better. The combination of the two materials and three 
regions produces a total of six design scenarios to consider. We can reduce 
the scenarios by half as follows. First, we decide which material is better while

using the current manufacturing region (Asia). Then, we use this material to compare 
the other two regions (Europe and Japan). 
 We follow Steps 1 through 9 of  Section   11.9  to evaluate the design. We use the steel 
washer to establish the baseline for the sustainability analysis.

 Step 8:  Evaluate the plastic washer: Repeat Steps 2 
and 3, using  Plastics as Class , Epoxy unfilled as 
 Name , and  Injection Molded as  Process . Keep Steps 
4 and 5 the same. Knowing that aluminum is better 
than steel, we set aluminum as baseline and compare 
plastic to it. The environmental impact (not shown 
here) shows that aluminum is better than plastic.  
 Step 9:  Evaluate impact of manufacturing region: 
Now that we have decided on aluminum material, 
change manufacturing region to Japan, then Europe 
and compare. The results (not shown here) indicate 
insignificant difference.

 Part Development 
and Analysis 
 The primary goal of Part IV is to explore and cover the design activities that follow the 
completion of CAD (geometric) models. During these activities, we use various engi-
neering analyses and simulations to ensure that designs are safe and meet strength 
requirements. 
 Chapter   12 (Tolerances) covers the details of tolerances, their types, and their impact 
on manufacturing.  Chapter   13  (Analysis Tools) covers the most widely used analysis 
and simulation tools. This includes mass property calculations, animation and motion 
analysis, flow simulation, and finite element modeling and analysis.  Chapter   13  also 
covers data exchange between CAD/CAM systems.

 Tolerances  
 12.1  Introduction 
 We all have heard the saying “life is never perfect,” and so it is with manufacturing. We 
can never manufacture a perfect form. An example of a perfect form is a block with 
5 * 3 * 4 inch dimensions. Instead, variability is an inherent characteristic of manufac-
turing. Sources of variability are abundant and include the skills of the machine operator 
(machinist), the accuracy and age of the machine, the ambient conditions, and the 
 condition and age of the cutting tool. Therefore, producing parts with perfect  dimensions 
would be impossible and prohibitively expensive. Thus, we attempt to control 
 manufacturing variability rather than entirely eliminate it. 
 In addition to controlling physical attributes of manufacturing such as training 
operators well and maintaining the machines and cutting tools, we also specify and con-
trol the acceptable range of variability of part dimensions. We use the concept of toler-
ances during part design to specify the acceptable variations for part dimensions that 
still allow the part to perform its intended function. A  tolerance is an amount of devia-
tion (variability) in a part dimension from the perfect form. For example, we may spec-
ify a tolerance amount of {0.010 inch on the 5 * 3 * 4 inch dimensions of the block. 
This means that any of the block dimensions is allowed to change within this tolerance. 
For example, the 5 inch dimension may assume any values between 4.090 and 5.010 
inches inclusive. 
 Tolerances play a crucial role in design and manufacturing. Designers use them to 
meet functional requirements; for example, they specify clearance between two moving 
parts. For manufacturing, tolerances control the manufacturing cost of parts. The smaller 
(tighter) the tolerances, the more expensive it is to make the part. Tolerances also have 
an effect on the part surface finish. The tighter the tolerances, the better the surface fin-
ish. This is because tighter tolerances require more precise and better manufacturing 
processes. 
 Tolerances are the key behind the concept of spare (replacement) parts or inter-
changeability. Without tolerances, we would not be sure that a spare part (e.g., a car 
part) would fit perfectly. We may ask the following question: When we replace a part, 
why does the new part sometimes feel a little tighter or looser than the old one? Also, 
different copies of the same new product may feel different; some are tighter than others. 
This is because the tolerance we specify on a part dimension generates a normally dis-
tributed population of the part. The mean of the normal distribution is the perfect form 
(i.e., the dimension without tolerances on it), for example, the 5 inch dimension of the 
block. Thus, depending on where a product copy falls in the distribution population, we 
get tighter or looser products when we assemble the parts. 
 CHAPTER

Chapter 12: Tolerances
 Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T) provide many other benefits in 
addition to what has been mentioned. These benefits are as follows: 
  
1.  Having standardized design language for communication among designers.  
  
2.  Clearly communicating the design intent to designers, customers, suppliers, manu-
facturing, inspection, and the entire product supply chain.  
  
3.  Calculating the worst-case assembly scenario by using tolerance limits.  
  
4.  Making production and inspection repeatable via using datums (covered later in 
the chapter).  
  
5.  Assembling parts to create products is guaranteed because all the parts belong to 
their respective normally distributed populations.  
 12.2  Types 
 Tolerances are divided into two types: conventional and geometric. Conventional toler-
ances are more widely used than geometric tolerances because they are the first to 
develop and they are easier to apply and understand. Conventional tolerances control 
the part size (dimensions). Geometric tolerances (GTOL) control the part form (i.e., its 
shape). Consider a rectangle. Controlling the width and height is achieved via conven-
tional tolerances, whereas controlling the angles of the rectangle and the parallelism of 
its sides is achieved via geometric tolerances. 
 Both types of tolerances are used for part inspection after manufacturing. There exist 
off-the-shelf inspection gauges that are used to check whether the parts meet the toler-
ance requirements, that is, whether their dimensions are within the specified values 
(limits). A commonly used inspection gauge is the Go-NoGo gauge. If the part fails 
inspection, it is rejected by the inspection team and becomes scrap. A high percentage 
of scrap makes the part manufacturing more expensive and calls for changes to better 
control the manufacturing processes. Inspection is an element of the part quality control 
(QC) and quality assurance (QA). Other elements include visual inspection and surface 
finish (roughness) measurements.  
 12.3  Concepts 
 Both conventional and geometric tolerances introduce concepts and definitions that we 
must understand to use tolerances correctly in our designs and to be able to use the 
tolerance tools offered by CAD/CAM systems. The concepts are covered in the ASME 
Y14.5M-1994 publication titled “Dimensioning and Tolerancing”; the new revision is 
ASME Y14.5-2009. We cover the following concepts here: 
  
1.  Size:    A  size refers to a dimension of a feature, for example, length of an edge, or 
radius/diameter of a shaft or a hole. Three types of sizes are used in conjunction 
with tolerances: nominal, basic, and actual. A  nominal size is a size (value) 
without decimals (e.g., 5). A  basic size is a nominal size with decimals to indicate 
its accuracy (e.g., 5.0, 5.00, or 5.000). Note that these three basic sizes are not the 
same although their nominal size (5) is the same. They require dimensional 
accuracy of one, two, and three decimal places, respectively. An  actual size is the 
measured length on the manufactured part of the basic size. The actual size must 
be a value within the specified tolerances of the basic size; otherwise, the part is 
rejected during inspection.  Figure   12.1  shows the nominal and basic sizes.  
  
2.  Shaft and hole:     The tolerance concepts are based on a shaft fitting into a hole. Each 
has a basic size of  d s  for the shaft and  d h  for the hole. Although  d s  =  d h  , each has a 
different tolerance.  Figure   12.2  A shows a shaft and a hole.  

Chapter 12: Tolerances
345
  
3.  Tolerance zone:     The amount of change in  d s  and  d h  is known as the  tolerance zone 
 s and  h , respectively. This amount is related to the specified tolerance on the shaft 
or the hole and can be determined from that tolerance.  Figure   12.2  B shows the 
two tolerance zones. 
  
4.  Hole and shaft systems:     Both the dimensions of a shaft or a hole are subject to 
variability during manufacturing. In order to specify and calculate tolerances, we 
need to fix one relative to the other. We may use either as a reference. If we use 
the hole as a reference, we have a hole-based system for specifying and calculating 
tolerances. A shaft-based system uses the shaft as a reference. The hole-based 
system is more widely used in practice over the shaft-based system because it is 
believed that manufacturing a hole is more difficult than manufacturing a shaft. 
Thus, it is beneficial to fix the hole size and change the shaft size to achieve the 
desired tolerance. An example application that uses the shaft-based system is the 
textile industry.  
  
5.  Limit dimensions:     A  limit dimension is the maximum or minimum value of a basic 
size. For example, the limit dimensions of a basic size of 3.000 and tolerance of 
{0.005 are 3.005 (maximum) and 2.995 (minimum).  
  
6.  Unilateral tolerances:     A dimension may change in one direction from the basic size 
or in both directions. A  unilateral tolerance is a tolerance in which variation is 
permitted in only one direction from the basic size. For example, the limit dimen-
sions of a basic size of 3.000 and a unilateral tolerance of +0.005 are 3.005 
(maximum) and 3.000 (minimum). And, the limit dimensions of a basic size of 
3.000 and a unilateral tolerance of -0.005 are 3.000 (maximum) and 2.995 
(minimum). In both cases, we may think that the other tolerance is 0.000.

Chapter 12: Tolerances
  
7.  Bilateral tolerance:     A  bilateral tolerance is a tolerance in which variation is permit-
ted in both directions from the basic size. For example, the limit dimensions of a 
basic size of 3.000 and a bilateral tolerance of +0.005 and -0.003 are 3.005 
(maximum) and 2.997 (minimum).  
  
8.  Symmetric tolerance:     A  symmetric tolerance is a bilateral tolerance with equal 
variations in both directions from the basic size. For example, a basic size of 3.000 
with a symmetric tolerance of {0.005 has the limits of 3.005 (maximum) and 
2.995 (minimum).  
  
9.  Material condition:     The  material condition is a condition we attach to a geometric 
tolerance to indicate to the inspection department how the part feature should be 
inspected. The material condition is an important concept when designing design 
inspection gauges. The design ensures that a part will not pass inspection unless its 
dimensions meet the specified tolerances under the specified material condition. 
Three types of material conditions exist: maximum, least, and regardless of feature 
size. A maximum material condition (MMC) is designated by the symbol of the 
letter M inside a circle. The MMC ensures that the maximum amount of material 
stays in the part after manufacturing, that is, minimum hole size and maximum 
shaft size. A least material condition (LMC) is the opposite of MMC. It is desig-
nated by the symbol of the letter L inside a circle. The LMC ensures that the least 
amount of material stays in the part after manufacturing, that is, maximum hole 
size and minimum shaft size. A regardless of feature size material condition (RFS) 
is designated by the symbol of the letter S inside a circle. The RFS indicates, to the 
part inspector, that the tolerance applies regardless of the actual produced (manu-
factured) size of the feature. Applicability of MMC, LMC, and RFS is limited to 
features subject to variations in size. The MMC is the one most commonly used in 
practice because it minimizes the amount of manufacturing scrap, thus saving 
material and keeping the manufacturing cost down.  
  10.  Datum:     Datums are used in conjunction with geometric tolerances. A  datum is a 
part feature (plane) that is used as a reference to specify geometric tolerances. The 
part inspector uses the datums during inspection to check whether the manufac-
tured part is within the specified tolerances. The datum concept is required to be 
able to control the form (shape) of a part. For example, we need a datum against 
which we can measure the perpendicularity or parallelism of a part face. A datum is 
usually an actual face of the part. To use a part face as a datum requires that the 
machinist uses a highly accurate machining process to machine the face. In addition 
to controlling form, the datum is also used to measure part linear dimensions from.  
  11.  Datum target:     Datum targets define how we define a target. As a datum is a part 
plane, how do define a plane? We define a datum via three noncollinear points, or 
via a line and a point not lying on it. Datum targets have physical significance during 
inspection. The inspection department uses the targets to design and produce the 
gauge that is used to inspect the part. When the part inspector places the part on the 
inspection gauge, its faces must make contact with the inspection gauge at the target 
points and/or lines to pass inspection; otherwise, it does not pass and becomes scrap.  
 12.4  ASME Tolerance Rules 
 We briefly discussed ASME tolerances in  Chapter   5 .  Here are some ASME tolerance rules: 
  
1.  Express tolerances correctly:    There are four methods to specify tolerance in an 
engineering drawing: 
 A.  Limit dimensioning:    Show the minimum and maximum values of a dimension. 
Use the MMC to show the limits, as shown in  Figure   12.3  A. Show the 

Chapter 12: Tolerances
347
 maximum value above the minimum value for a shaft and vice versa for a hole. 
This minimizes the amount of scrap. Keep in mind that the machinist can only 
remove material, but the material cannot be added once it has been removed. 
Also, keep in mind that the machinist will attempt, naturally, to meet the 
dimension value above the dimension line first.  
 B.  Plus and minus tolerancing:     Show the basic size followed by a { tolerance value, 
as shown in  Figure   12.3  B. A plus and minus tolerance may be bilateral or 
symmetric. This method of tolerancing is practiced most widely because 
machinists prefer it. A machinist typically aims to meet the basic size (dimen-
sion) value during machining.  
 C.  As a note referring to specific dimension:    Include a note in the drawing to specify 
tolerances on specific dimensions, as shown in  Figure   12.3  C. 
 D.  In the title block:    Specify general tolerances in the title block of the engineering 
drawing, as shown in  Figure   12.3  D. 
 (C) Tolerance note 
 (D) Title block  
 FIGURE 12.3

 (B) Plus and minus tolerancing  
 (A) Limit dimensioning  
  
2.  Ensure tolerance accuracy matches the dimension decimal:     The number of decimals in 
the basic size dictates the accuracy of the tolerance specified for that size. For 
example, a basic size of 3.500 should have a tolerance of {0.005. And a basic size 
of 3.50 should have a tolerance of {0.05.  
  
3.  Follow these rules for millimeter (metric) tolerances:     
 A.  For unilateral tolerancing, use a single zero as shown in  Figure   12.4  A. Note 
that SolidWorks demonstrates this rule as shown in  Figure   12.4  A. 
 B.  For bilateral tolerancing, you should use the same number of decimal places, 
using zeros when necessary, as shown in  Figure   12.4  B. 

348
Chapter 12: Tolerances
 C.  Limit dimensions should have the same number of decimal places by adding 
zeros, if necessary, as shown in  Figure   12.4  C. 
 D.  Drop the zeros in a basic size if you do not specify conventional (size) tolerance 
on it, as shown in  Figure   12.4  D. 
 Note that SolidWorks enforces these rules as shown in  Figure  12.4 when using 
the MMGS (millimeter, gram, second) Units system. Also, make sure you select  ISO  
drafting standard; use this sequence:  Tools (SolidWorks menu) >  Options > 
 Document Properties tab >  Drafting Standard >  ISO (from drop-down list) >  OK .   
 (B) Use same number of decimals for both 
 tolerances  
 (C) Use same number of decimals for limits  
 (D) Drop zeros in basic size  
 FIGURE 12.4 
 Rules of millimeter tolerances  
 (A) Use a single zero in zero-tolerance value  
  
4.  Follow these rules for inch (English) tolerances:    
 A.  For unilateral tolerancing, use the same number of zeros for the zero value as 
the nonzero tolerance value with the proper sign, as shown in  Figure  12.5  A. 
 B.  For bilateral tolerancing, you should use the same number of decimal places in 
the tolerance values as used in the basic size, using zeros when necessary, as 
shown in  Figure   12.5  B. 
 C.  Limit dimensions should have the same number of decimal places by adding 
zeros, if necessary, as shown in  Figure   12.5  C. 
 D.  Keep the zeros in a basic size if you do not specify conventional (size) tolerance 
on it as shown in  Figure   12.5  D. 
Note that SolidWorks enforces these rules as shown in  Figure  12.5 when using 
the IPS (inch, pound, second) Units system. Also, make sure you select  ANSI drafting 
standard; use this sequence:  Tools (SolidWorks menu) >  Options >  Document 
Properties tab >  Drafting Standard >  ANSI (from drop-down list) >  OK .  

Chapter 12: Tolerances
349
  
5.  When you use tolerances on an angle dimension, use the same number of decimals in the 
tolerance value as in the basic size, that is, 45.00° { 0.10°, or 45.0° { 0° 30 (which can 
also be written as 45.0° { 0.5°):     Note that a degree has 60 minutes and a minute has 
60 seconds. The symbols of degree, minute, and second are, respectively, °, , and . 
  
6.  Interpret tolerances during inspection:     All limits are absolute regardless of the 
accuracy (number of decimal places) of the specified tolerances; that is, 5.002 
means 5.0020000 … 0. However, the number of decimals informs the inspection 
personnel what to do. They compare the measured value with the specified value, 
and any deviation outside the specified limiting value is ignored.  
  
7.  Use single limit appropriately:     You may use MIN or MAX to specify a tolerance on a 
dimension where other elements of the design clearly determine the other unspeci-
fied limit. That is, the design intent is clear and the unspecified limit can be zero 
or approach infinity and will not result in design problems. Use a single limit for 
features such as the depth of a hole, length of a thread, corner radii, and chamfers. 
SolidWorks uses this format to specify a MIN or MAX: 5.000 MIN or 5.000 MAX.  
 12.5  Tolerancing Tapers 
 There exist two types of tapers: conical and flat, as shown in  Figure   12.6  . An example of 
a conical taper is a conical shaft, and an example of a flat taper is a wedge.  Figure  12.6  
also shows how to specify (dimension) a taper. The dimensioning and tolerancing of a 
taper depend heavily on its functional requirements.  Figure   12.6  A shows the four com-
mon schemes to dimension a conical taper. Scheme 1 implies that the taper cross section 
at distance  L from the left end with a diameter  d is important and should be toleranced. 
 (C) Use same number of decimals for limits  
 (D) Keep zeros in basic size  
 FIGURE 12.5 
 Rules of inch tolerances  
 (B) Use same number of decimals as basic size  
 (A) Use many zeros in zero-tolerance value  

350
Chapter 12: Tolerances
For example, the conical taper may plug a conical hole at the specified location to pre-
vent a leak. Thus, the location and the diameter are crucial to the taper functionality. 
 Scheme 2 implies that the taper end diameters,  D and  d , and its overall length  L are 
important and should be toleranced. For example, the taper may be a floating core of a valve 
that must block the gas or fluid flow from one end of the valve to the other. The dimension-
ing and tolerancing of a flat taper follow similar rules and are shown in  Figure  12.6  B. 
 Scheme 3 shows the use of an angle and scheme 4 shows the use of a slope. Note the 
use of the slope symbol. SolidWorks does not have the slope symbol for the conical 
taper, shown in  Figure   12.6  A4, but it does have the symbol for the flat taper shown in 
 Figure  12.6 B4.

 The taper of the conical taper shown in  Figure  12.6  A4 is defined by the following 
equation: 
 
  Taper = (D - d)>L 
(12.1)  
 And the slope of the flat taper shown in  Figure   12.6  B4 is given by: 
 
  Slope = (H - h)>L 
(12.2)  
 Figures   12.6  A4 and   12.6  B4 show the taper and slope as normalized values of  x :1, 
where  x is the right-hand side of each equation. Observe that the definitions of the taper and 
the slope, given by  Eqs.   (12.1)  and   (12.2)  , are a little different from each other. These defi-
nitions are set by the ASME Y14.5M-1994 standard; the new revision is ASME Y14.5-2009. 
The tutorials of this chapter apply the taper concepts discussed here using SolidWorks.  
 12.6  Limits of Dimensions 
 The two questions we answer in this section are: Why and how do we standardize toler-
ances? And how do we use them to calculate the limits of a dimension? We need to 
standardize tolerances to standardize part manufacturing and inspection. This in turn 
ensures parts’ interchangeability, which guarantees that replacement (spare) parts fit 
well into products as intended. Both ANSI and ISO standards have developed two 
equivalent systems of standard classes of fits that designers can use. Each fit has standard 
tolerances associated with it depending on the basic size that the designer wants to 
assign tolerances to.  Table   12.1  shows the ANSI fits and their ISO equivalents. These fits 
are divided into three classes: clearance, transition, and interference. Clearance fit occurs

Chapter 12: Tolerances
when the shaft moves loosely inside the hole it fits into. Transition fit occurs when the 
shaft is in transition from clearance to interference; that is, the shaft is snug fit into the 
hole. Interference fit occurs when the shaft is pressed into the hole and cannot move 
inside it. There are different grades (levels) within each tolerance class: very loose, mod-
erate, or tight clearance or interference. Think of the fits as a sliding scale from very 
loose clearance to very tight interference, and anything in between. 
 Table   12.1  shows that each ANSI fit designation has two ISO symbols. For example, 
the ANSI fit designation of RC1 is equivalent to the ISO fit designation of H5/g4. H5 and 
g4 designate the hole and shaft, respectively. All holes use the letter H to indicate that we 
use a hole-based system, whereas shafts use different letters. Each letter represents a fit 
class. The number next to each letter is the tolerance grade number or the IT grade. Our 
example of H5/g4 implies that the hole has a class and IT grade of H and 5, respectively, 
and the shaft has g and 4, respectively. The hole IT grade is always 1 higher than the shaft 
IT grade because manufacturing the hole is harder than manufacturing the shaft. There 
exist ANSI tables (not shown here) that relate the tolerance IT grades to the different 
manufacturing processes. Each process is capable of producing a range of IT grades.  
 Having answered the first question, we now show how to use the fits in  Table   12.1 to 
calculate the limits on a dimension. These calculations require the introduction of the 
concept of allowance  a . While the shaft and hole tolerance zones  s and  h shown in  Figure 
 12.2 B control the dimensions of each of the shafts and the holes individually, they do not 
have an effect on how loose or tight the assembly of the two is; that is,  s and  h cannot con-
trol the type of fit between the shaft and the hole. The concept of allowance  a gives us this 
control. We can produce the three classes of fits (clearance, transition, and interference) by 
controlling the allowance  a . There are variations within each class. For example, we have 
loose and tight clearances, tight and shrink-fit interferences. The  allowance  a is an abstract 
algebraic value; it is positive for clearance and negative for interference.  
 The three values of the three parameters  s ,  h , and  a determine the shaft and hole 
limits as well as the type of fit of their assembly. These parameters provide the designer 
with full control over the functional requirements of an assembly. They also ensure that 
manufacturing meets these requirements.  Figure   12.7  shows the three classes of fit in 
terms of the three tolerance zones  s ,  h , and  a . As  Figure   12.7 shows, we use the basic 
size  d of the shaft or the hole as a reference ( X -axis). We place the tolerance zones as 
shown for each fit. The allowance  a is defined as the difference between the maximum 
shaft and the minimum hole dimensions. This definition is consistent with the MMC. 
A transition fit is the changeover fit from clearance to interference, as shown in  Figure 
 12.7  D. Also, notice that the hole tolerance zone  h always butts the basic size reference 
line, thus ensuring that  d h  min is always equal to the basic size  d . This is a result of using 
the hole-based system. Also, notice that a transition fit may be a clearance (represented 
by tolerance zone  s below the basic size line) or interference (represented by tolerance 
zone  s above the basic size line). Finally, notice that the allowance  a may be zero for a 
transition fit or not. 
 We use  Figure   12.7  to calculate the dimension limits for both the hole and the shaft. 
The following equations are easily derived: 
 
 dhmin = d
 
(12.3)  
 
 dhmax = d + h
 
(12.4)  
 
 dsmax = d - a
 
(12.5)  
 
  dsmin = d - a - s = dsmax - s 
(12.6)  
 Equations   (12.3)  –  (12.6)  are applicable to any fit type because the allowance  a is 
algebraic. We use the  tolerance tables  listed in  Appendix   A to calculate the limits for all 
types of fits. Follow these steps to calculate the dimension limits: 

Chapter 12: Tolerances
353
  
1.  Select a fit class from  Table   12.1  based on the desired fit type between the shaft 
and the hole under consideration. This type is determined by the functional 
requirements of the shaft/hole assembly.  
  
2.  Use the ANSI tolerance tables  listed in  Appendix   A to calculate the limits on both 
the shaft and the hole.  
 While Step 1 is straightforward, we elaborate Step 2. The tolerance tables  in  Appen-
dix   A implement the fits shown in  Table   12.1  for different basic sizes. They also imple-
ment  Eqs.   (12.3)  through   (12.6)  . This facilitates the job of the designer to calculate the 
dimension limits. The ANSI tables  in  Appendix   A have three columns for each fit to help 
you calculate the limits that correspond to the fit. Use the  Hole and  Shaft columns of 
the  appendix  Tables  A.1  - A3  to determine the limits. Simply add the values algebrai-
cally to the basic size,  d, as shown in  Eqs.   (12.7)  – (12.10)  . SolidWorks has implemented 
the tables  of  Appendix  A . Keep in mind that all the values listed in the  appendix tables 
must be multiplied by 10 –3 as the table footnote indicates. 
 Here is how to use the  appendix  to calculate the hole and shaft limits for a given 
basic size  d and a given fit: 
 Step 1:  Use the type of fit (clearance, transition, or interference) to select the appro-
priate table (  Table   A.1   for clearance,   Table   A.2   for transition, or  Table  A.3  
for interference).  
 Step 2:  Within the selected table, scan the  Basic Size column (at the far left of the table) using 
the value of the basic size  d to locate the row whose range includes that  d value.  
 Step 3:  Go across using the row to locate the  Hole and  Shaft columns that correspond 
to the given fit.  
 Step 4:  Once there, use the four values that intersect the row and are listed under the 
two columns as follows: 
    dhmin = d + small value in Hole column (always 0 for hole-based system)  (12.7)  
    dhmax = d + large  value in Hole column
  (12.8)  
    dsmax = d + large algebraic value in Shaft column
  (12.9)  
    dsmin = d + small algebraic value in Shaft column

 Substitute the values calculated from  Eqs.   (12.8)  – (12.10)  into  Eqs.   (12.4)  – (12.6) to 
calculate the tolerance zones  h, s , and  a . Keep in mind that  a is an algebraic value—
positive for clearance, negative for interference, and zero for transition ( Figure   12.7  ). 
 Equation  (12.5)  should confirm that observation ( a = d - d smax ).

 12.7  Tolerance Accumulation 
 Tolerance accumulation is the chain effect of a series of tolerances. Tolerance accumu-
lation is controlled by the dimensioning scheme. Tolerance accumulation is also known 
as tolerance stackup. For example, a horizontal or vertical chain of toleranced dimen-
sions results in tolerance accumulations. You should avoid tolerance accumulation as 
much as possible by changing dimensioning schemes.  Figure   12.9  shows a toleranced 
stepped shaft. Our goal is to dimension the shaft in such a way as to minimize tolerance

accumulation between planes A and B to meet part functional requirements. We inves-
tigate the effect of the following three dimensioning schemes on tolerance accumulation: 
  
1.  Chain dimensioning:     Figure   12.9  A shows this dimensioning scheme, which is a 
horizontal dimension chain. This is the worst dimensioning scheme of the three 
schemes shown in  Figure   12.9  because it produces the maximum tolerance 
accumulation. The maximum variation between planes A and B is equal to the sum 
of the tolerances between the two planes (i.e., {0.15).  
  
2.  Baseline dimensioning:    Figure   12.9  B shows this dimensioning scheme. The maxi-
mum variation between the two planes is equal to the sum of the two dimensions 
from the farmost left plane (origin) to the two planes (i.e., {0.10). This results in 
a reduction of the tolerance accumulation from the preceding scheme.  
  
3.  Direct dimensioning:     Figure   12.9  C shows this dimensioning scheme. It is the best 
of the three schemes shown in  Figure   12.9  because it does not produce any 
tolerance accumulation. The maximum variation between planes A and B is equal 
to the tolerance of the dimension between the two planes (i.e., {0.05).  
 12.8  Statistical Tolerancing 
 When we assign tolerances to parts (components), our goal is to control the assembly of 
these parts into a functional assembly. As we discussed in  Section   12.1 , specifying a 
tolerance on a part dimension ( Figure   12.10  A) generates a normally distributed popula-
tion of the part ( Figure   12.10  B). The horizontal axis represents the actual dimension 
produced, and the vertical axis represents the probability of producing a given dimen-
sion. The mean, μ, of the normal distribution is the perfect form (i.e., the basic size  d ). 
The two extremes of the curve are the maximum and minimum sizes,  d max and  d min , 
respectively, as shown in  Figure   12.10  B, and represent the maximum and minimum 
material conditions. The distance between the mean and any of the two extremes is 
known as 3s, where s is the standard deviation. The area under the bell curve that is 
 (C) Direct dimensioning

Chapter 12: Tolerances
357
bounded by {3s includes 99.73% of all the possible parts produced (manufactured) 
with the specified tolerance. 
 All manufacturing processes subject to common cause variation produce parts that 
vary in size around the basic size,  d . If the manufacturing process is “perfectly” capable, 
then very few parts are produced at the extremes of the bell curve ( Figure   12.10 B), that 
is, at maximum or minimum conditions. In other words, the probability of getting parts 
on both tails of the curve is very small as the curve shows, whereas the probability of 
getting parts around the basic size is very high. Thus, we can use this observation to 
relax tolerances on dimensions in a calculated manner. In such a case, we use the con-
cept of statistical tolerancing.  Statistical tolerancing  is a method of tolerancing that is 
based on the fact that it is highly unlikely that we would get mating parts (in an assem-
bly) at both maximum and minimum material conditions. 
 Unlike statistical tolerancing, arithmetic tolerancing assumes all parts are produced 
at the maximum or minimum material conditions. When using arithmetic tolerances is 
restrictive, we may use statistical tolerancing to increase tolerances on a dimension. The 
increased tolerance may reduce manufacturing cost, but should be employed where the 
appropriate process control is used to control the manufacturing process.  
 Specifying statistical tolerances on dimensions is designated as shown in  Figure   12.11 . 
Designers can use SolidWorks to specify statistical tolerances as shown in the figure. To 
access the  <ST> symbol, click the  More button while inserting a dimension to access the 
Symbol library. The designations shown in  Figure   12.11 follow the ASME Y14.5M-1994 
standard.  Figure   12.11 A shows the use of the statistical tolerance symbol. The standard 
mandates that the statement shown be placed on the drawing.  Figure   12.11 B shows an

interesting example where it may be necessary to designate both the statistical and arith-
metic limits when the dimension has the possibility of being produced without statisti-
cal process control (SPC). In such a case, the shown note must be placed on the drawing. 
Note that the arithmetic tolerance is tighter than the statistical tolerance, thus making it 
more expensive to manufacture the part.  
 12.9  True Position 
 The concept of true position is part of geometric tolerancing. True position applies to 
locating and tolerancing a hole in a part. A hole has a size (radius or diameter) and a 
location (center). Tolerancing the hole size is straightforward and uses conventional 
tolerances. Tolerancing the hole center depends on how we locate it. We locate the 
center by ( x, y ) coordinates measured from two planes. Thus, we specify a tolerance on 
each coordinate (dimension), that is, { x and { y , as shown in  Figure   12.12  A. 
Although this logic seems to make sense, it is not good because it “under-tolerances” the 
part; that is, the hole location has more tolerance than we intend. The tolerances pro-
duce a rectangular tolerance zone that is 2 x * 2 y , as shown in  Figure   12.12 A, thus 
allowing more tolerance on the hole location than specified. The length of the diagonal 
of the tolerance area is given by:

 (A) Conventional tolerance zone  
 The hole center can move along the diagonal whose length is larger than the speci-
fied 2 x or 2 y . This allows the part to pass inspection when in reality it should not.  
 The preceding problem can be easily solved by decoupling the tolerance on the hole 
center from its ( x, y ) coordinates. In other words, remove the { x and { y . The con-
cept of true position achieves that, as shown in  Figure   12.12  B.  True position  is defined 
as specifying the hole ( x, y ) coordinates without any tolerances. The true position allows 
us to define a circular tolerance zone on the hole with a diameter of 2 r , as shown in 
 Figure   12.12 B. We customarily display the hole coordinates in boxes, as shown in 
 Figure   12.12 B. How do we specify tolerances on the hole location then? We define a 
position tolerance, as we show when we cover geometric tolerances.  
 12.10  Geometric Tolerances 
 Geometric tolerances complement conventional tolerances. They control the location, 
shape (form), and profile of individual features.  Table   12.3  shows the different geomet-
ric tolerances and their symbols as specified by the ASME Y14.5M-1994 standard. 

Chapter 12: Tolerances

 To master geometric tolerances, we need to know how to assign and interpret them. 
Assigning a geometric tolerance requires the following steps: 
  
1.  Specify needed datums. These datums are used to measure dimensions from.  
  
2.  Decide on the type of geometric tolerance you need to apply to a given feature. 
Select the desired tolerance from  Table   12.3  . 
  
3.  Create the geometric tolerance details.  
 Figure   12.13  shows an example.  Figure   12.13  A indicates the elements of a geometric 
tolerance, which we create one by one in SolidWorks. The symbol comes from  Table 
 12.3  , depending on the tolerance we need to create (position tolerance in our example). 
The tolerance amount (zone) follows the symbol. The diameter symbol is optional and 
used when it makes sense. In this example, we need it because we specify a tolerance 
zone for the center of the hole. The material condition symbol (modifier) is optional. The 
next three letters indicate the datums. The first datum is the primary datum, followed by 
the secondary datum, followed by the tertiary datum. The order shown indicates to the 
part inspector how to inspect the part. There are three planes of the inspection gauge that 
correspond to these datums. The part inspector must first align the part surface A with 
the primary datum (A) of the gauge, followed by the others. If the part surface A does not 
mate with the gauge plane at the datum target points and/or lines, the part fails inspec-
tion. Last, we may optionally specify a material condition on any datum.  
 Figure   12.13 B shows two tolerances on the hole. One is a size tolerance on the hole 
diameter, which is a conventional tolerance. The other is a location tolerance on the hole 
center. It reads as follows: “There is a tolerance zone with a diameter of 0.03 mm on the 
hole center measured with respect to datums A (Primary) and B (Secondary).” In other 
words, the hole center is free to move from its true position within a circle whose diam-
eter is 0.03 mm and which is centered at the true position point. If the hole center is 
located outside this circle, the part is rejected during inspection. Why do we use two 
datums in  Figure   12.13 B? It is because the hole location is determined by the ( x, y ) 
coordinates, each requiring a datum. 
 Using and interpreting a material condition symbol (modifier) is the hardest to do 
and can be well understood only in the context of designing an inspection gauge. For a 
Go-NoGo gauge, the location of the gauge pin or hole is located where the condition is

met, thus forcing the part to meet the specified condition as well. Typically, it takes time 
and experience to use material condition modifiers in geometric tolerances. The required 
depth of coverage needed to fully understand the use and interpretation of material 
conditions is beyond the scope of this  book  . 
 Interpreting geometric tolerances is important to learn because it enhances our 
understanding and therefore enables us to assign geometric tolerances correctly. When 
we interpret geometric tolerance, we always look for the tolerance zone that results from 
the specified tolerance, the part feature (surface) that is affected by it, how it moves 
within the tolerance zone, and how the datum planes influence the interpretation. Let 
us apply these four observations to the hole tolerances shown in  Figure   12.13  B. The 
resulting tolerance zones are shown in  Figure   12.13  C. The true position tolerance on 
the hole location (center) produces circle I. This is a circular tolerance zone with a diam-
eter of 0.03 mm as specified by the geometric tolerance. Any part produced with a hole 
center within this circle is acceptable and meets the design requirements. 
 The size tolerance on the hole indicates that the hole diameter is acceptable anywhere 
between circles II and III shown in  Figure   12.13  C. These two circles represent the maxi-
mum material condition (circle II with a diameter of 24.95 mm) and minimum material 
condition (circle III with diameter of 25.05 mm). The dashed circle shown in  Figure 
 12.13  C represents the basic size of the hole (Ø25 mm). When we combine the effect of

both the size and location tolerances, we can think of infinite combinations for the result-
ing hole. All these holes fall under the bell curve shown in  Figure   12.10  B. Each part with 
a hole is a point under the curve. The correct inspection gauge is capable of checking for 
all these infinite combinations and passing only the ones that fit under the curve.  
 12.11  Datum Target Symbols 
 As discussed at the end of  Section   12.3  , datum targets are designated points, lines, or 
areas of contact on a part to define a datum (feature of reference). These designated tar-
gets are used during inspection. We use datum targets to define datums because an entire 
feature (planar or cylindrical face) cannot be used to establish a datum due to the irregu-
larity of the part face that serves as a datum. A datum is always an actual face of a part. 
 Points, lines, and areas on datum features are designated on a drawing via datum 
target symbols.  Figure   12.14  shows different ways to define datum targets. These targets 
are created in SolidWorks.  Figure   12.14  A shows how to indicate a datum target point. 
In this case, we specify (define) datum A by the point located at 40 mm from the left face 
of the part. When we want to specify a datum (A) by a line, we specify two points, A1 
and A2, on the line, as shown in  Figure   12.14  B.  Figure   12.14  C shows how to specify a 
datum (C) by an area. Datum C is the front plane. The area is indicated by a diameter 
(Ø10).  Figure   12.14 C shows the two options to specify the datum: with or without a 
shaded area. The area indicates that an area of contact is necessary to establish a datum. 
The shape of the target area may be circular or rectangular. Consult the SolidWorks 
menu; click  Insert >  Annotations >  Datum Target .

 12.12  Tolerance Interpretation 
 Interpreting tolerances is important to understanding them. Conventional tolerances are 
usually easier to interpret than geometric tolerances. The underlying principle is that a 
tolerance defines a zone within which the toleranced feature resides. The toleranced 
feature assumes any location and orientation within the tolerance zone.  Table   12.4  
shows sample tolerances with their graphical interpretations. These tolerances (except 
for the size tolerance) correspond to those shown in  Table   12.3  .

 12.13  Tolerance Analysis 
 There are two types of tolerance studies: analysis and synthesis.  Tolerance analysis 
(also known as  tolerance stack-up analysis ) is the study of how tolerances and assembly 
methods affect dimensional stack-up between two features of an assembly. In other 

364
Chapter 12: Tolerances
words, we assign tolerances to individual components and study the effect of these toler-
ances on the assembly of the components. Thus, component tolerances are known and 
we calculate the resulting assembly tolerance. 
 Tolerance synthesis is also known as  tolerance allocations . It is the reverse of toler-
ance analysis. The assembly tolerance is known from design requirements, while com-
ponent tolerances are not known.  Tolerance synthesis  is the method of how we allocate 
(distribute) the assembly tolerance among its individual components in a reasonable 
way. We cover tolerance analysis only in this chapter. 
 The two most commonly used methods for tolerance analysis are worst case and 
statistical. The worst-case method assumes that the dimension of each component in the 
assembly is at its worst, that is, maximum or minimum. This method produces the worst 
possible assembly limits. In the worst-case analysis, the assembly tolerance is given by 
the linear summation of the component tolerances. For one-dimensional assemblies 
with  N components, the assembly tolerance is given by: 
 
  T = a
i=N
i=1
Ti 
(12.12)  
 where  T and  T i  are, respectively, the assembly tolerance and the component tolerance. 
One-dimensional assembly means an assembly in which toleranced dimensions form a 
chain in one direction (horizontal, vertical, or any other direction). 
 For multidimensional assemblies,  Eq.  (12.12)  becomes: 
 
 T = a
i=N
i=1
 ` 0f
0xi
` Ti 
(12.13) 
 where  0# 0  is the absolute value,  x i  is the nominal component dimensions, and  f ( x i  ) is an 
assembly function describing the resulting dimension of the assembly, such as clearance 
or interference. The partial derivatives represent the sensitivity of the assembly tolerance 
to variations in individual component dimensions. 
 Equations   (12.12)  and   (12.13)  assume that the tolerances are symmetric (i.e., the 
negative and the positive limits are equal). If the tolerances are bilateral (i.e., the limits 
are not equal),  Eqs.  (12.12)  and   (12.13)  can be applied to each limit to give: 
 
  Tmin = a
i=N
i=1
 Timin,      Tmax = a
i=N
i=1

` 0f
0xi
` Timin,      Tmax = a
i=N
i=1
` 0f
0xi
` Timax 
(12.15) 
 The statistical method of tolerance analysis is based on the statistical concepts cov-
ered in  Section   12.8 . This method uses the RSS (root sum squared) to evaluate the 
statistical tolerance stack-up. The method assumes a normal (Gaussian) distribution 
for the component variations. In this case, the one-dimensional assembly tolerance is 
given by: 
 
  T = B a
i=N
i=1
 T2
 i 
(12.16)  
 For a multidimensional assembly, the assembly tolerance is given by: 
 
  T = B a
i=N
i=1
 a 0f
0xi
b

T2
 i 
(12.17)  

Chapter 12: Tolerances
365
 For cases of non-normal distributions, the Monte Carlo simulation method is used to 
evaluate the tolerance stack-up. The coverage of this method is beyond the scope of this  book . 
 Equations   (12.16)  and   (12.17)  assume that the tolerances are symmetric (i.e., the 
negative and the positive limits are equal). If the tolerances are bilateral (i.e., the limits 
are not equal),  Eqs.  (12.16)  and   (12.17)  can be applied to each limit to give:

 Example 12.2    An assembly consists of four identical boxes that are stacked on top of each other. We 
need to control the assembly overall height,  h , to be between 3.9 and 4.1 in. The height of 
each box is 1.00 { 0.03 in. Does the tolerance specification on each box height meet the 
assembly tolerance requirement? 
 Solution     The assembly height is 4.00 { 0.10 in. (3.9, 4.1). Thus, the assembly tolerance is {0.10 in. Using 
the worst-case method,  Eq.  (12.12)  gives: 
 T = 0.03 + 0.03 + 0.03 + 0.03 = 0.12 in. 
 The tolerance stack-up (0.12 in.) is more than the assembly allowable tolerance limit of 0.10 in. Thus, the toler-
ance of the box height must be tightened. 
 Using the statistical method,  Eq.  (12.16)  gives: 
 T = 2(0.03)2 + (0.03)2 + (0.03)2 + (0.03)2 = 0.06  
 The resulting statistical assembly tolerance is {0.06, thus meeting the assembly tolerance requirement. The 
tolerance calculated by the worst-case method is double that calculated by the statistical method. The two methods 
of tolerance analysis produce different results and can lead to opposite conclusions. Selecting which method of 
tolerancing to use is important. We would use the statistical method if the manufacturing methods were well con-
trolled, as covered in  Section   12.8 . However, the worst-case method is the safer approach. If the inputs (component 
tolerances) are within their respective tolerances, the output (assembly tolerance) is guaranteed to be within its 
worst-case tolerance. This is especially important for products like heart valves or critical components of airplanes. 
However, this guarantee comes at high cost. As discussed in  Section   12.8  , the worst-case scenario is highly un-
likely, if not impossible, in most cases. In this example, all the four boxes must have a height of either 0.97 or 1.03. 
This could occur only if the manufacturing process producing the boxes had zero variation.  
 12.14  SolidWorks Tolerance Analysis 
 SolidWorks implements the tolerance analysis concepts covered here in its  TolAnalyst 
module that helps us study how tolerances and assembly methods affect dimensional 
stack-up between two features of an assembly. In other words,  TolAnalyst is used to 
perform stack-up analysis of an assembly. It uses both the worst-case and the statistical 
methods covered in  Section   12.13  . The result is a minimum and maximum tolerance 
stack (Eq. 12.14), a minimum and maximum root sum squared (RSS) tolerance stack 
(Eq. 12.18), and a list of contributing features and tolerances. 
 It is advisable to know how to use the SolidWorks  DimXpert dimensioning module 
before using  TolAnalyst .  DimXpert is used with parts. It prepares models for use with 
 TolAnalyst .  DimXpert works by inserting dimensions and tolerances, automatically or

 TolAnalyst performs a tolerance analysis called a  study , which we create using four 
steps: 
  
1.  Measurement:    Establish the measurement, which is a linear distance between two 
features, created using  DimXpert 
  
2.  Assembly sequence:     Select the ordered set of parts to establish a tolerance chain between 
the two measurement features. The selected parts form the “simplified assembly”  
  
3.  Assembly constraints:     Define how each part is placed or constrained into the 
simplified assembly  
  
4.  Analysis results:     Evaluate and review the minimum and maximum tolerance stacks

Tutorial 12–3:  Define Datum Targets 
 We create datum targets to define datums A, B, and C shown in  Figure  12.17 . We define 
datums A and B by two target points each and define datum C by one target point.  Figure 
 12.18 shows these targets. These targets are used to build inspection gauges and are used 
during the part inspection. The inspector slides the part onto the inspection gauge and 
pushes the part against the faces of the gauge and observes the points of contact between 
the two. If the part is in complete contact with the gauge at the locations specified by the 
target points, the part passes inspection; otherwise, it is a reject and becomes scrap.  
 HANDS-ON FOR  TUTORIAL   12–2.    The top face of the block must be parallel to its bottom face and 
perpendicular to its left face within 0.1 for functional requirements. Add two geometric tolerances to the 
top face to specify these two requirements.

Tutorial 12–4:  Tolerance a Taper 
 We use the tolerance techniques discussed in this chapter to tolerance a flat taper and a 
conical taper, as shown in  Figure   12.19  , per the ASME Y14.5M-1994 standard; the new 
revision is ASME Y14.5-2009.

Tutorial 12–5:  Perform Tolerance Stack-up Analysis 
 We use  TolAnalyst to perform tolerance stack-up of the assembly shown in  Figure

amount of 0.02 inch on the block depth when we assemble two instances as shown in 
 Figure  12.20 . TolAnalyst creates a study to store the results of the stack-up analysis.

 Analysis Tools  
 13.1  Introduction 
 The creation of a geometric model is not an end in itself, but rather a means to study 
the part or assembly design to ensure that it meets the functional requirements of the 
design, be it stress analysis, fatigue analysis, thermal analysis, buckling, or any other. 
CAD/CAM systems offer a multitude of analysis tools that the designer can use to verify 
his or her design. 
 The crucial factor in using these analysis tools is understanding how to set up the 
problem correctly, use the right input parameters, and interpret the results. Each tool is 
based on and implements a mathematical model. The effective use of these tools requires 
that the designer be versed in the area of the analysis that the tools implement. For 
example, the designer must possess a sound understanding of the finite element method 
to effectively use the stress analysis tool of a CAD/CAM system. 
 Analysis tools include such applications as mass property calculations, finite ele-
ment method, thermal analysis, fatigue analysis, frequency analysis, mold flow analysis, 
buckling analysis, simulation, and fluid flow analysis. We cover some of these analysis 
tools in this chapter. Although data exchange is not exactly considered an analysis tool, 
we cover it here because we consider it part of model activities after the model creation. 
 CAD/CAM systems offer analysis tools in three ways: built-ins, add-ins, or separate 
packages. Built-in tools come with the CAD/CAM system as part of the CAD/CAM soft-
ware installation (e.g., mass properties is a built-in application). The user simply uses 
them. Add-ins also come with the CAD/CAM system, but the user needs to activate them. 
 Simulation  in SolidWorks is an example. Separate packages require separate installa-
tions and interface with CAD/CAM systems via file share. For example, a specialized 
analysis package may read a CAD/CAM file and perform its analysis on it.  
 13.2  Data Exchange 
 Data exchange is routinely done in practice to transfer CAD/CAM files from one system to 
another; for example, a company that outsources its manufacturing needs to send its CAD 
models to its subcontractors who may not use the same CAD/CAM system. Data exchange 
solves the following problem. How do you transfer CAD/CAM models from one CAD/
CAM system to another? Each CAD/CAM system, like any application, has its own propri-
etary native file format; that is, the system saves the model (part) in its own format. Such 
a file is not transferable to another system; other systems cannot open or read it. 
 The common solution to solving this data exchange problem is to save the files in 
“neutral” formats that are commonly read by all CAD/CAM systems. Some of these  
 CHAPTER 
13 

384
Chapter 13: Analysis Tools
formats are standard whereas others are  de facto  standards. Examples of standard neutral 
file formats are STEP and IGES. Examples of  de facto formats are AutoCAD DXF and 
ACIS. SolidWorks supports all these formats and more. Another group is image and 
Web formats. Image format includes saving a model as a JPEG image. Web format 
includes saving a model as a VRML (virtual reality markup language) model. 
 Data exchange occurs between two CAD/CAM systems. The user exports or imports 
a CAD file from one system to another. Consider a file exchanged from system A to sys-
tem B. We say the user exports the file from system A when the user saves it in system A 
in a neutral file format. Conversely, we say the user imports the file to system B when the 
user reads the neutral file into system B, thus converting it to the native format of system 
B. In summary, we say the user exports the file from system A and imports it to system B. 
 Data exchange comes with potential problems. Each CAD/CAM system has two 
translators: one to export its native format to neutral format, and an opposite one to 
import neutral format to its native format. Translators for standards such as IGES and 
STEP are developed and written by interpreting sets of ISO and ANSI standards. Such 
interpretations open the door for translation errors. Thus, translating model data from 
their native format to neutral format, and vice versa, has the potential of data loss. Thus, 
the exchanged files need to be carefully inspected, including visual inspection, to ensure 
no data loss or no corruption occurred during the exchange process. CAD/CAM systems 
developers utilize multiple tests to check the accuracy of their translators. 
 Figure   13.1 shows all the possible file formats that SolidWorks supports.  Table   13.1  
presents a brief description of some of the formats and when to use them. Click File

ate images of CAD models to include in reports. SolidWorks offers two versions of 
STEP: AP203 and AP214. AP203 is used in any mechanical CAD sector, whereas AP214 
is used specifically in the automotive industry. Other formats may be used on an as-
needed basis; for example, use DXF/DWG formats if you deal with AutoCAD files.

Chapter 13: Analysis Tools
 SolidWorks performs checks when it imports a neutral file. It asks the user a 
series of questions to validate its translation of the file. We can perform the following 
simple test to experience this translation process. Create a box. Save it as STEP AP203 
format. Then read it back into SolidWorks. SolidWorks asks whether to run diagnos-
tics on the part. If we confirm, SolidWorks displays any faulty faces and/or any gaps 
between faces. 
 Finally, it asks whether we need to proceed with feature recognition. If we confirm, 
it maps the features stored in the neutral files to its native format and creates a Solid-
Works native features tree. We refer to this imported solid as a “smart” solid. If we 
decline the feature recognition step, SolidWorks imports what we refer to as a “dumb” 
solid. Such a solid has only one node in the features tree named  Importedx (e.g., 
 Imported1 ,  Imported2 ); thus its features and sketches are not available to edit. 
 The understanding of the CAD file translation process requires knowledge of the 
boundary representation (B-rep) of a CAD model. A  B-rep defines a CAD model by its 
boundary elements, that is, vertices (points), edges (curves), and faces (surfaces). Each 
model feature we create consists of this B-rep. A B-rep also maintains the CAD model 
topology. This understanding of B-rep explains the SolidWorks translation process. 
 The diagnostics test that SolidWorks performs during translation detects faulty faces 
that may have resulted from the translation from other CAD/CAM systems or from the 
importing process. It also detects any gaps between faces. Both of these problems occur 
due to the numerical accuracy used by each system to represent the geometry. They may 
also occur due to the internal representation (equations) used by each CAD/CAM system 
to define the geometry. If SolidWorks does not find any problems, it converts the B-rep 
into features and displays the model and its features tree. The model is now good and in 
native SolidWorks format, and so it is ready to use in design and other activities.  
 13.3  Mass Properties 
 Mass properties calculations are the oldest application offered by CAD/CAM systems. 
The foundation behind this application comes from basic engineering courses (calculus 
and statistics). These calculations include volume, mass, center of mass, first and second 
moments of inertia, and principal moments and axes of inertia. The following equations 
provide these properties:

 The evaluation of the integrals shown in  Eqs.   (13.1)  –  (13.9)  is done numerically 
because they are evaluated over the boundaries of a 3D CAD model. This makes the 
exact integration of these equations impossible. The most efficient and accurate numer-
ical integration method is Gauss quadrature. (Matlab has Gauss quadrature built into it.) 
CAD/CAM systems use this method to calculate the mass properties. Gauss quadrature 
converts an integral equation into a summation that is easily calculated over the integral 
limits. The integral could be single or double. These integrals are functions of  u or ( u ,  v ) 
parameters that we have covered in  Chapters   8 and   9 . These two types of integrals take 
the following general forms: 
 
I =
L

(13.12)  
 
I =
L

 f(u, v)du dv 
(13.13)  
 The single integral given by  Eq.   (13.12)  is used to integrate functions over a curve, 
whereas the double integral given by  Eq.   (13.13)  is used to integrate functions over a 
surface. 
 The calculations of mass properties proceed as follows. We know that CAD/CAM 
systems use parametric equations to represent and store the curves and surfaces that 

388
Chapter 13: Analysis Tools
make up the features of CAD models. Thus, we recast  Eqs.   (13.1)  through 
 (13.9)  in terms of the parameters  u and ( u ,  v ) and convert them to the forms 
given by  Eqs.   (13.12)  and   (13.13)  . This conversion is beyond the scope of 
this  book . After we have  Eqs.   (13.12)  and   (13.13)  , we integrate them numer-
ically using Gauss quadrature to calculate the mass properties. 
 Gauss quadrature is a simple, but accurate, numerical integration 
method. We know from calculus that the area under a bounded curve is the 
integral of the curve function.  Figure   13.2 shows the graphical representa-
tion of  Eq.   (13.12)  . Gauss quadrature samples the function at selected sam-
pling points ( Figure   13.2  shows three sampling points), evaluates  f ( u ) at these points, 
and evaluates the integral. Using this procedure,  Eq.   (13.12)  becomes:

the functions  f i  . The functions  f i  are calculated at the sampling points  u i  given by:

 TABLE 13.2   Gauss Quadrature Data 
 How many sampling points should a CAD/CAM system use in mass property calcu-
lations? Before we answer this question, keep in mind that  f ( u ) is a polynomial in the 
CAD/CAM field because it comes from the parametric representation that uses only 
polynomials. Gauss quadrature produces exact results (equal to the results we could 
obtain from evaluating the integral in exact form, if that were possible) for integrating 
polynomials according to this rule: polynomials degree   … 2n - 1 , where  n is the 
number of sampling points. Thus, three sampling points ( n = 3) should produce exact 
results for a polynomial of degree of 5. This is more than adequate for CAD/CAM because 
the highest order polynomial we use is 3. In engineering and CAD/CAM applications, 3 
sampling points is all we need. 
 The evaluation of the double integral of  Eq.   (13.3)  using Gauss quadrature is the 
same as for the single integral and yields the following equation:

 Example 13.2   Use SolidWorks to calculate the centroid and volume of a 2  2  
2 in. box with a spherical void (hole) at its center. The sphere 
diameter is 1 in. Create the box so that its MCS is at its center. 
 Solution     This part is somewhat odd with a void inside it. But it illustrates the ac-
curacy of the mass properties calculations of SolidWorks. The box sketch is a square 
at the front plane with a center at the origin. Extrude the sketch using the mid plane 
direction, so we can use the front plane to sketch a circle for the sphere ( Revolved 
Cut ) and centerline (axis of revolution). Trim the circle, as shown in  Figure  13.3 , be-
fore revolving it around the centerline; otherwise, SolidWorks produces an error (self-
intersecting) and the revolve cut fails. 
 Example 13.1   Use Gauss quadrature to evaluate this integral: 
 
I =
L
3
1
 (u4 -  u)du 
(13.17)  
 Solution     The polynomial degree is 4. Using the rule of exact integration, we need 
2 n  - 1 = 4, or  n = 2.5 sampling points for Gauss quadrature to yield the exact results. 
Thus, we use  n = 3. Here are the steps to evaluate the integral: 
  1.  Using the integral, we identify the following parameters:  a = 1,  b = 3,  f ( u ) =  u 4  -  u 
  2.  Using  Eq.  (13.14)  for 3 sampling points, we write  Eq.  (13.17)  as: 
 
I = 3 - 1
2
 (W1f1 + W2f2 + W3f3)  
(13.18)  
  3.  Using  Table  13.1 for   n = 3 , calculate  f i  at the three sampling points; we designate 
them by their Gauss data ( C i  ,  W i  ). Let us designate  f 1  ,  f 2  , and  f 3  , respectively, by 
(0.7745967, 0.5555556), (0.0, 0.8888889), and (−0.7745967, 0.5555556). 
Calculating these functions requires calculating the sampling coordinate value  u i  at 
each point using  Eq.  (13.15)  . This gives  u 1 = 2.7745967,  u 2 = 2, and  u 3 = 
1.2254033. Thus, 
 f1 = (2.7745967)4 - 2.7745967 = 56.4905634  
  Similarly,  f 2 = 14, and  f 3 = 1.0294390  
  4.  Substituting into  Eq.  (13.18)  and reducing give  I = 44.40000405  
 The exact integration of the integral gives 44.4. Gauss quadrature yields the exact 
value. The small error (0.00000405) is due to truncation errors. We used only 7 deci-
mal places in this example. If we use the 15 decimal places shown in  Table   13.2 , we will 
get better results. 
 HANDS-ON FOR  EXAMPLE   13.1  .   Use 1 and 2 sampling points. Compare the accuracy of the results 
with the 3 point result. 
 The calculations of  W i  ,  W j  , and  f ij  are the same as for the single integral. Think of 
extending the calculations from 1D to 2D.  f ij  is evaluated at the sampling point located 
at ( u i  ,  v j  ).

 Run SolidWorks mass properties by clicking  Mass Properties  icon on the  Evaluate 
tab. The results in  Figure   13.3  show that the center of mass is located at (0, 0, 0), as we 
would expect, because the model is symmetric with respect to the origin. The volume is 
listed as 7.48 in 3 . That is easily verifiable. The box volume is given by 2 3 = 8 in 3 . The 
sphere volume is (4/3)  R 3  = (4/3) 0.5 3 = 0.52 in 3 . Thus, the net volume = 8 - 0.52 = 
7.48 in 3 . That is identical to the SolidWorks result.  
 HANDS-ON FOR  EXAMPLE   13.2  .   Replace the sphere by an ellipsoid and calculate the mass properties. 
Compare with the exact results.  Note: Ellipsoid volume is (4/3)  abc , where  a ,  b , and  c are the ellipsoid 
radii. When you sketch the ellipse to revolve cut, use  a = 0.75 in. and  b = 0.5 in. Depending on the axis of 
revolution you use,  c could be 0.5 or 0.75. If you revolve around the longer axis ( a = 0.75),  c = 0.5. 
 Note:   We have not assigned a material to the model. SolidWorks assumes a default density.  
 13.4  Animation and Motion Analysis 
 SolidWorks provides animation and motion analysis of an assembly. Motion studies can 
be time based or event based. Time-based motion studies describe the response to time-
based changes in motion elements on the assembly motion. Event-based motion studies 
 FIGURE 13.3 
 SolidWorks mass properties  

Chapter 13: Analysis Tools
391
are defined with a set of motion actions resulting from triggering events. We can obtain 
the time sequence for element changes by calculating an event-based motion study. 
 We use event-based motion analysis to specify motion from some combination of 
sensors, times, or previous events. Event-based motion requires a set of tasks. The tasks 
can be sequential or can overlap in time. Each task is defined by a triggering event and 
its associated task action that controls or defines motion during the task.  
 13.5  Flow Simulation 
 With SolidWorks  Flow Simulation , you are able to analyze the flow of up to 10 fluids 
of different types (liquids, gases/steam, real gases, non-Newtonian liquids, and com-
pressible liquids). SolidWorks contains numerous fluids with predefined properties. In 
addition to preexisting fluids, SolidWorks allows you to define your own fluids. The 
flow analysis includes mutual dissolution of fluids. Mixing fluids must be of the same 
type. A simple example of flow simulation is to study the flow of water inside a hose and 
animate the streamlines to visualize the water movement. 
 SolidWorks requires a closed control volume to perform its flow simulation. The 
flow model it uses requires an inlet and outlet for the flow to enter and exit the control 
volume. The inlet and outlet need to be closed to run the simulation. The flow param-
eters include temperature, pressure, flow velocity, and flow rate. We need to set the 
fluid initial settings (boundary conditions, B.C.) at the inlet and outlet before we start 
the simulation. The B.C. must ensure the creation of a gradient or drop to force a fluid 
flow (e.g., inlet pressure must be greater than outlet pressure to create a pressure drop 
to move the flow in the control volume). Flow parameters depend on each other. For 
example, if we specify a pressure drop, the simulation calculates the flow velocity and 
rate. If we specify a flow rate or velocity, pressure drop is calculated.  Tutorial   13.7  pro-
vides more details. 
 13.6  Finite Element Method 
 The  finite element method is a numerical method that is capable of solving almost any 
problem with any level of complexity. The method consists of finite element modeling 
(FEM) and analysis (FEA), or FEM/FEA. Many engineering design problems are too 
complex to find closed-form solutions for their governing equilibrium equations. The 
elegance of the finite element method is that it converts the equilibrium (differential) 
equation of a continuum into an integral equation. Then, instead of solving the equilib-
rium equation over the entire domain of the continuum, it applies the integral equation 
over many small regions called  elements and, finally, assembles the elements’ equations 
into a set of simultaneous algebraic equations whose solutions generate the domain 
solution. 
 Thus, the method divides a complex shape (domain) into smaller elements. Each 
element has designated points called  nodes . The elements are adjacent to each other, 
with no gaps between their sides, and are connected at the nodes. Each node has a set 
of degrees of freedom (DOF) that depend on the problem at hand. The selection of ele-
ment type, the number of nodes per element, and the DOF at each node are among the 
important decisions to make to create and run an accurate FEA for a problem. 
 The finite element method begins with modeling (FEM) and ends with analysis 
(FEA). The method is complex to use and requires good understanding of the problem 
we need to solve. CAD/CAM systems automate the method to the point that many 
designers use it as a black box. This is both good and bad. It is good to speed up the 

392
Chapter 13: Analysis Tools
FEM/FEA so the designer can get answers quickly to the “what if” design scenarios and 
questions. It is bad because it requires that the designer have good understanding of 
using FEM/FEA to be able to model the problem correctly and interpret/analyze/verify 
the analysis results. 
 FEM sets up the problem for FEA. FEM has the following steps: 
  
1.  Generate the mesh:   This includes breaking down the problem domain (the geomet-
ric model) into nodes and elements (mesh). The general rule is that the more 
elements and the more nodes per element we use (i.e., finer mesh), the better the 
accuracy of the FEA, but the more expensive it is to perform because it requires 
more computational time. Keep in mind that once we create the mesh, the geomet-
ric model is only defined by the nodes of the mesh. No other points that are not 
nodes are recognized by the FEA. Thus, we need to make sure that points of 
importance are made nodes; for example, points where external load are applied. 
While the CAD/CAM FEM/FEA module takes care of all these details, we need to 
be aware of them. 
  
2.  Select the element type and the number of nodes per element:    This selection depends 
on the type of analysis at hand and the desired accuracy of the solution. For 
example, we can use a quadrilateral element with a minimum of four (corner) 
nodes and a maximum of eight nodes (four corner nodes and four mid-side nodes) 
and any number in between; or we can use a triangular element with a minimum 
of three (corner) nodes and a maximum of six nodes (three corner and three 
mid-side nodes). 
  
3.  Assign the DOF at the nodes:    Depending on the element type and the problem to 
solve, assign the DOF at the nodes. For example, there is a maximum of 6 DOF 
per node (three translations and three rotations) for 3D problems. For a 3D stress/
strain problem, we use three DOF: displacements along the three axes ( X ,  Y , and 
 Z ). For a beam bending problem, we use two DOF: lateral displacement and 
rotation/slope. 
  
4.  Assign boundary conditions (B.C.):    We use these conditions to reflect how the model 
(part) is fixed in real life. We need boundary conditions; otherwise, the model will 
float in space and the FEA will give wrong results (usually very large values). 
Example boundary conditions include fixing an end face of a cantilever beam, an 
edge of a face, or a vertex. Boundary conditions apply to nodes by suppressing all 
their DOF. 
  
5.  Apply material:    We need to assign a material to the model. Some materials are 
linear, such as steel and aluminum, while others are nonlinear, such as rubber and 
plastics. Linear materials may use linear (for small deformation problems) or 
nonlinear (for large deformation problems) FEA. Nonlinear materials require 
nonlinear FEA. 
  
6.  Apply external loads:   These loads cause the model to deform and create the FEA 
results. Loads could be forces at nodes, pressures at faces, moments, heat flux, or 
others. When we apply a load, we need to specify its type (force, moment), 
direction (along  X -,  Y -, or  Z -axis), sense (up or down), and value (amount).  
 The FEM/FEA modules of CAD/CAM systems automate the preceding six steps to a 
great extent. The designer does not see Steps 1 through 3. The CAD/CAM system 
 generates the mesh automatically. The most commonly used type of element is  tetrahedral 
element with 10 nodes (4 corner and 6 mid-side). The system would require the designer 
to supply data for Steps 4 through 6. Although all CAD/CAM systems automate the 
mesh generation, setting up the finite element model is very crucial to FEA in order to 
get both the desired and accurate results. Ideally, the designer must have a good 
 theoretical background of FEM/FEA to be efficient in setting up the model and selecting

the type of analysis (linear, nonlinear, static, dynamic, etc.).  Figure   13.4  shows an 
 overview of the preceding six steps as applied to a cantilever beam.  Figure   13.5 shows 
the different types of elements. 2D elements ( Figure   13.5  B) include triangular (3 and 6 
nodes) and quadrilateral (4 and 8 nodes) elements. 3D elements ( Figure   13.5  C) include 
tetrahedral (4 and 10 nodes) and hexahedral (8 and 20 nodes) elements.

Chapter 13: Analysis Tools
 After we complete these six steps of FEM, we are ready to perform FEA. The FEA 
includes running the analysis to solve the finite element equations, display the results as 
curves and/or contours, and analyze the results. Analyzing and making sense of the 
results requires good understanding of the problem we are solving. After analyzing the 
results, the designer has two options: accept the design as is, or iterate it (change the part 
design, regenerate FEM, redo FEA) until satisfactory results are achieved.  
 The most commonly used and simplest type of FEA is static linear analysis. FEA 
could be static or dynamic. Within each type, the analysis could be linear or nonlinear. 
Nonlinearity could be due to large deformation or nonlinear material (such as rubber or 
plastic). In addition, we can perform FEM/FEA at the part or assembly level. The differ-
ence comes in the modeling of the mating between the assembly parts. Parts are not 
rigidly connected in an assembly. Thus, we usually need clever ways to model these 
mating regions. Experience with modeling of mechanical systems would help greatly. 
Typically, we may add springs, dampers, or other mechanical elements that closely 
describe the behavior of the mating region.  
 13.7  Finite Element Analysis 
 Although it is out of the scope of this  book   to provide full coverage of FEA, we offer a 
quick overview of it to help us better understand the FEM steps and activities. Let us 
consider the cantilever beam shown in  Figure   13.4  . The beam bending equation (also 
known as the  Euler-Bernoulli beam equation ) is: 
 
EId4u
dx4 = 0  
(13.19)  
 where  E is the modulus of elasticity of the beam material, and  I is the moment of inertia 
of the beam cross section. The B.C. are that the beam has a fixed end (does not move). 
The external load is the point load (force)  F at its free end. 
 Equation   (13.19)  is the equilibrium equation of the beam deflection under the force 
 F . It is a differential equation. After processing  Eq.  (13.19)  through the theoretical for-
mulation of the finite element method, it becomes the following integral equation: 
 
I = 1
2 L
L
0
 EIa d2u
dx2 b
2
dx - FuL 
(13.20)  
 where  u L  is the beam deflection at its free end where  F is applied. This integral equation 
applies to the entire beam, that is, the continuum. 
 Equation   (13.20)  is difficult to solve (in closed form) because it still applies to the 
entire beam. We need to break the beam into nodes and elements, apply  Eq.   (13.20) to 
each element domain, solve it there, and then assemble the solution over the entire 
beam. This process results in converting the integral  Eq.   (13.20)  into the following 
matrix equation: 
 
3K4 = P 
(13.21) 
 where [ K ],   , and  P are, respectively, the beam stiffness matrix, the beam  displacements 
or deflections (DOF) at the nodes, and the externally applied loads at the beam 
nodes. Both   and  P are vectors. The stiffness matrix [ K ] has in it the material effect, 
that is, the modulus of elasticity,  E . It also has the beam geometry and cross section 
( I ) effects in it. It finally reflects the B.C. of the beam. That is, it does not include 
the fixed nodes at the fixed end because they do not move; they are eliminated from 
the   vector. 

Chapter 13: Analysis Tools
395
 FEA solves  Eq.   (13.21)  . This is a matrix equation. It consists of a set of algebraic 
equations that must be solved simultaneously (using the Gauss elimination method) for 
the   vector. CAD/CAM systems use this vector to display the deflected shape of the 
beam, the stress contours, and the animation of the beam deflection. 
 Other types of FEA follow the same formulation.  Equation   (13.21) is for static linear 
analysis. It is linear because [ K ] is not a function of   and the material is linear (such as steel 
or aluminum). Otherwise, we have nonlinear static analysis. The sources of nonlinearity 
could be large displacement or nonlinear material. Dynamic analysis occurs when the prob-
lem changes with time. If the beam force,  F , changes with time or the beam vibrates, we 
have dynamic FEA.  Equation   (13.21) takes the following general form for dynamic FEA: 
 
3M4 $
D + 3C4 #
D + 3K4D = P 
(13.22) 
 where [ M ], [ C ],   
$
D , and   D
#
 are, respectively, the mass matrix, the damping matrix, the 
acceleration vector, and the velocity vector. If [ C ] and/or [ K ] depend on   or its deriva-
tives, we have nonlinear dynamic analysis; otherwise, we have linear dynamic analysis. 
 Once we solve  Eq.   (13.21)  or (13.22) for the displacement, we can calculate the 
strain using the following equation: 
 
e = 
L  
(13.23)  
 where  L is the element length that went through displacement    . Using the material 
relationship, the stress is: 
 
S = Ee 
(13.24)  
 Let us relate FEM Steps 1 through 6 to this FEA to make sense of these steps so we can 
use them effectively in SolidWorks  Simulation (FEM/FEA). Steps 1 through 5 create the 
matrices [ M ], [ C ], and [ K ]. Step 6 creates the  P vector. This enables FEA to solve  Eq. 
 (13.21)  or  (13.22)  and generate the results.  
 13.8  SolidWorks Simulation 
 SolidWorks implements the FEM/FEA concepts discussed in this chapter. It offers two 
FEM/FEA modules:  SimulationXpress and  Simulation . The former comes with stand-
ard SolidWorks licensing whereas the latter is an Add-In. SolidWorks  SimulationXpress 
is a built-in first-pass design analysis and verification tool for testing part designs quickly 
and easily. It allows us to test a design and investigate different design alternatives 
 without having to manufacture and test the design. SolidWorks  SimulationXpress is 
suitable for linear stress analysis of simple parts. It generates HTML reports and creates 
SolidWorks eDrawings files to document and communicate the results of the analysis. 
 SolidWorks  SimulationXpress provides only part analysis (geometry type); stress 
and displacement (analysis type); uniform pressure and forces (load type); stress, dis-
placement, and factor of safety plots (visualization); and HTML report, eDrawings, and 
AVI animation files (reports). If we need additional functionality or more in-depth FEM/
FEA, we use SolidWorks  Simulation . SolidWorks  Simulation offers all that  Simula-
tionXpress does and more. It provides assembly (including contact and friction) analy-
sis, more external load types (nonuniform pressure, torques, heat loading), assembly 
connectors (springs, elastic foundation, pins, bolts, spot welds), more visualization (ISO 
plots), and more reports (customization and image [bitmap, JPEG, or VRML]). 
 SolidWorks reports the stresses as Von Mises stress. Simply stated, Von Mises stress is 
based on the fact that the material starts to yield when the maximum stress,   max , due to 
externally applied load reaches or exceeds its yield stress,    y  ; that is, when   max  Ú     y  . 

396
Chapter 13: Analysis Tools
If   max   Ú     y  , the material fails (yields) and the part fails, causing the assembly (product) 
to fail and triggering failure consequences. Materials should always operate within their 
elastic zone. Thus, as a designer, your FEM/FEA should ensure that the design is safe 
within a factor of safety ( FS ), defined as: 
 
FS =
sy
smax Ú 1  
(13.25)  
 The factor of safety,  FS , should always be greater than 1, for example, 1.5 or 2. 
Depending on how catastrophic the failure consequences of a part are, the  FS should be 
determined. The worse the consequences of failure, the higher the  FS should be. How-
ever, there is a silver lining here. Although higher  FS seems logical, it makes the design 
more expensive and unnecessarily heavy because we use more material to increase the 
part strength. Thus, experience, heuristics, and field testing play an important role in 
determining a reasonable  FS for a part design.  
 13.9  Von Mises Stress 
 We need to understand the stress-strain curve of a material to understand Von Mises 
stress. Von Mises stress is a criterion for ductile material failure. Ductile material is a 
material that has yield stress,    y  , as shown in  Figure   13.6  . Ductile materials are also 
known as isotropic materials that obey Hook’s law.  Table   13.3  shows the strength values

for some materials. The units shown in the table are gigapascal (GPa) and megapascal 
(MPa). Giga is 1 billion (10 9 ) and mega is 1 million (10 6 ), and a Pascal is 1 Newton per 
square meter (N/m2). Also, 1 N/m 2 is equivalent to 0.0001450377 psi.  
 Steel and aluminum are sample ductile materials. The stress-strain curve is linear up 
to the yield stress,    y  . The slope of the line is the material modulus of elasticity,  E . The 
material is elastic in this linear zone, meaning it fully recovers when the externally applied 
load is removed. After the yield point, the material becomes plastic, meaning that it expe-
riences permanent deformation. Such deformation renders the part dysfunctional in its 
assembly; that is, the part fails its functional requirements and must be replaced. 
 The stress-strain curves shown in  Figure   13.6  are usually derived from what is 
known in the materials field as a  uniaxial stress test , also known as a  simple tensile test . 
Scientists use a tensile test machine, design and produce a tensile specimen (rod with 
circular cross section and square ends, as shown in  Figure   13.6  A), mount the specimen 
in the machine, and apply a progressive load,  P , to the specimen until it necks and 
breaks. While the load value is increasing, the specimen is elongating under the load. 
And while it is elongating, it is necking at its midpoint along its length. Scientists mount 
strain gages on the specimen (at the necking region) to measure its displacements. These 
measurements are used to plot the stress-strain curves shown in  Figure   13.6 B and cal-
culate the yield stress,    y  . There are all sorts of standards and requirements the scientist 
must follow to create the specimen (with the required dimensions and shape) and con-
duct the test. 
 Although the simple tensile test conducted in materials laboratories generates the 
material properties, it seldom represents loading of the material in real life. Such loading 
is almost always multiaxial. Multiaxial loading introduces two safety concerns for design-
ers. First, multiaxial loading is more severe than uniaxial loading and would cause the 
material to fail sooner. Second, the material is loaded along all axes of loading. In such 
a case, which stress, along which axis, should the designer use to determine the design 
factor of safety? 
 The remedy for these two concerns is the Von Mises stress,    v  .  Von Mises stress  is 
defined as an equivalent tensile stress that is used to predict yielding of materials under 
multiaxial loading conditions using results from the simple uniaxial stress test. In other 
words, the Von Mises criterion is a formula for calculating whether the stress combina-
tion at a given point will cause failure. We have at most three directions or axes ( X ,  Y , 
and  Z ) along which we can apply loads. (These axes are also considered to be the prin-
cipal axes of loading.) A simple example of multiaxial loading occurs when we apply a 
force that is not along one of the axes. For example, applying a force  F in the XY plane 
produces two force components:  F x  (along the  X -axis) and  F y  (along the  Y -axis), thus 
producing multiaxial loading. 
 Let us assume that loading a part produces three stresses (at a point) of   S1, S2 , and 
 S3 along the three axes  X ,  Y , and  Z , respectively. Von Mises stress at this point is given by: 
 
Sv = A
(S1 - S2)2 + (S2 - S3)2 + (S1 - S3)2
2
 
(13.26)  
 In this case, yielding occurs when the equivalent stress,   Sv , reaches the yield stress 
of the material in the simple tension test,   Sy . In the case of uniaxial stress, 
 S1   0, S2 = S3 = 0  , and  Eq.   (13.26)  reduces to   Sv = S1 . If   1 reaches    y  , the 
material fails. 
 SolidWorks  Simulation calculates    v  via FEA as follows. It calculates the displace-
ments at the nodes (points) by solving  Eq.   (13.21)  for static loading. These displace-
ments are due to multiaxial loading that is reflected in the load vector  P . It then uses  Eqs. 
 (13.23)  and   (13.24) to calculate the strains and stresses at the nodes, respectively. These 

398
Chapter 13: Analysis Tools
equations provide three strains (  1 ,   2 ,   3 ) and three stresses   (S1, S2, S3)  at each node. 
Finally, SolidWorks substitutes these stresses into  Eq.   (13.26)  to calculate the Von Mises 
stress,   Sv , at the center point of each element. It also uses  Eq.   (3.25)  to calculate the 
factor of safety,  FS. It displays the stress contour and  FS for the designer to evaluate. 
 Example 13.3   Figure  13.7 shows a steel column. The column has a square cross section that is 0.5  0.5 in. 
The column has a height of 2 in. It is subjected to a tensile force of 100 lb at its top face and 
is fixed at its bottom face. Use FEM/FEA to calculate the stresses in the column. Verify the 
FEA results against the exact solution. 
 Solution     The idea behind this example is to verify the accuracy of the finite element method against the exact 
solution of a simple problem. The example simplifies the geometry of a tensile specimen, creates a geometric 
model (part) of the simplified geometry, runs the FEM/FEA, and verifies the results. We use SolidWorks  Simula-
tionXpress instead of  Simulation . 
 (B) Geometric model of specimen  
 FIGURE 13.7 
 Finite element modeling of a tensile test specimen model 
 (A) Specimen standard dimensions  
 A standard tensile specimen has standard dimensions.  Figure   13.7  A shows a sample. Our geometric model of 
the specimen shown in  Figure   13.7 B uses the dimensions of the middle part of the specimen with simplifications. It 
uses a square cross section instead of a circular one. It also uses 0.5 in. instead of 0.505 in. for simplicity. We apply 
a force of value 100 lb at the center of the top face of the geometric model while we fix its bottom face. 
 The general steps to perform FEM/FEA using  SimulationXpress are: 
  1.  Create the column model  
  2.  Start  SimulationXpress and set units 
  3.  Apply B.C  
  4.  Apply external loads 
  5.  Apply material 
  6.  Run FEA  
  7.  Display the results 
  8.  Generate reports 
 Step 7 below shows that the minimum and maximum Von Mises stresses in this part are approximately 215 
and 649 psi, respectively. If we interpolate to the midpoint of the column (at  L = 1.0 in.) by taking the average of 
the two values, we get a stress value of   s = 432 psi. The closed-form solution to this problem is: 
 
S = P
A =
100
0.5 * 0.5 = 400 psi  
(13.27)  
 Thus, we have an error of 8% (32/400).

Tutorial 13–4:  Perform Motion Analysis Using a Motor 
 We create a motion analysis of the assembly of a two-axle steel wheel drum that is 
mounted on two blocks at its ends as shown in  Figures   13.8  and   13.9  . We add a motor 
to drive the wheel drum. We study the motor functionality using SolidWorks  Motion

Chapter 13: Analysis Tools
Analysis and compare to hand (manual) calculations. The motion analysis includes 
calculating speeds, accelerations, forces, and torques. We plot these variables to study 
their behaviors. 
 Let us use the following motion specifications: 
 ■  Wheel drum is made out of Steel AISI 304  
 ■  Motor accelerates from 0 to 100 RPM (revolution per minute) in 5 sec  
 ■  After 5 sec, the motion is steady for another 5 sec (i.e., constant 100 RPM and zero 
acceleration)  
 ■  Ignore bearing friction in motor  
 We need to calculate the motor torque and power to provide this motion. Based on 
well-known kinematics and dynamic analysis, we can write the following equations for 
the angular motion of the motor shaft: 
 
T = Ia
 
(13.28)  
 
P = Tv
 
(13.29)  
 
v2 = v2
0 + 2au 
(13.30)  
 
v = v0 + at
 
(13.31)  
 where  I ,  ,  0 ,  ,  , and  t are respectively the inertia, angular velocity, initial angular 
velocity, angular acceleration, angle of rotation, and time of the wheel drum motion 
(rotation).  T and  P are respectively the motor torque and power. 
 Based on the motion specifications and knowing that one revolution is 360 degrees 
or 2 radians and one minute is 60 sec, we write   0 = 0,   = [100(2)/60] = 10.472 
rad/sec = 600 deg/s, and  t = 5 sec. We use SolidWorks to calculate the mass properties 
of the wheel drum to find its  I zz  as 34116.70 lb.in 2 . We use  I zz  because the wheel drum 
rotates about that axis based on how we created the wheel drum model. This is the 
Z-axis of the model MCS. 
 ■  Substituting these values into  Eq.  (13.31)  , we get   =   / t = 10.472/5 = 2.094 rad/
s 2 = 119.977 deg/s 2 
 ■  Using  Eq.  (13.30)  , we get   =   2 /2  = (10.472) 2 /(2*2.094) = 26.185 radians  
 ■  Using  Eq.  (13.28)  , we get  T = 71440.370 lb_mass.in = 5953.364 lb_mass.ft = 
185.036 lb_force.ft, where 1 lb_force = 1 g lb_mass, where  g is the gravity accel-
eration = 32.174 ft/s 2 
 ■  Using  Eq.  (13.29)  , we get  P = (185.036*10.472) = 1937.700 lb_force.ft/s = 
1937.700 *1.3558 = 2627.134 Watts = 2627.134 /745.700 HP = 3.523 HP  
 Summary of hand calculations to use in SolidWorks motion analysis: 
 ■  Angular velocities:   = 0 at  t = 0, 600 deg/s at  t = 5 s, and 600 deg/s at  
t = 10 s 
 ■  Angular acceleration:   = 119.977 deg/s 2 , constant for 5 sec  
 ■  Mass moment of inertia:  I zz = 34116.70 lb_mass.in 2 
 ■  Torque:  T = 185.036 lb_force.ft  
 ■  Power:  P = 2627.134 Watts  
 Figure   13.9  shows the graphs generated for the study. As shown in the figure, the 
hand calculations match the SolidWorks results except for the power consumption. We 
calculated a power peak of 2627.134 Watts while SolidWorks calculated a power peak 
of 215 Watts.

Tutorial 13–7:  Perform Flow Analysis on a Hose 
 We run a flow analysis on a hose using SolidWorks  FloXpress . The SolidWorks 
 FloXpress tool gives a basic insight into how water or air will flow through a part or an 
assembly. SolidWorks also has a  Flow Simulation Add-Ins  module that is more com-
prehensive than  FloXpress . This tutorial studies the flow of water through a hose using 
 FloXpress .  Figure  13.12  shows the flow simulation. All dimensions are in mm.

 Flow simulation of a hose  
 Flow simulation requires a closed control volume that is mandated by the theo-
retical mathematical formulation it uses. We also need to set up the simulation model 
correctly. We need to provide B.C. (boundary conditions) at the inlet and outlet of the 
control volume. There are three variables available: pressure, flow velocity, and flow 
rate. We specify one and calculate the other two. Our B.C. must create a gradient drop 
from inlet to outlet to generate flow motion. For example, the inlet pressure must be 
higher than the outlet pressure to push the flow in the control volume, just as in real 
life. If the inlet and outlet pressures were equal, water would not flow. Specifying an 
outlet pressure higher than inlet pressure does not make sense and SolidWorks tells 
us so.

 Part Manufacturing 
 The primary goal of  Part   V is to explore and cover part manufacturing. Manufacturing is 
a very large field. We focus our attention here on basic manufacturing including proto-
typing, machining, and injection molding. The goal is to provide the reader with some 
sense of what happens to designs after they leave the design department and how they 
become products. 
 Chapter   14 (Rapid Prototyping) covers the concepts of how to produce prototypes 
to evaluate designs.  Chapter  15 (Numerical Control Machining) covers the concepts of 
machine tools and basic machining processes such as turning, drilling, and milling. 
 Chapter   16 (Injection Molding) describes injection molding as another basic manufac-
turing process that is different from machining. Machining applies to metals whereas 
injection molding applies to plastics.

 Rapid Prototyping  
 14.1  Introduction 
 Design prototyping has long been a common practice in engineering design. Design and 
manufacturing engineers always want to ensure that a product design as perceived and 
visualized on paper (or on a CAD/CAM screen) is what it is. The advantage of verifica-
tion is that it eliminates any hidden mistakes or surprises that may be discovered during 
product manufacture. These surprises are costly. Even if there are no design mistakes, 
holding a prototype in hand may prompt some design changes such as changes in 
dimensions, aspect ratio, or relocation of features for ease of access by the intended users 
and maintenance personnel. 
 Prototyping is not only found in engineering; it is also part of life. Many of us have 
built prototypes of amateur designs such as building a racing car for the car derby race 
in Boy Scouts, or building the tallest structure using balsa wood sticks. Engineering 
students must design and build a prototype of a device as part of their mandatory cap-
stone design course in their senior year. 
 There exist multiple ways to create prototypes in industry, depending on the 
industry and the product. For example, the automotive industry has been using pro-
totyping for years to model concept cars. Designers use clay (plasticine) to build a 
full-size model of a concept design before, during, or after a design is completed. They 
typically build the car body out of clay. Once finalized, they may use the model to 
measure the coordinates of points on the body using a CMM (coordinate measuring 
machine). They feed these coordinates to a CAD/CAM system, and use them to create 
free-form surfaces of the car CAD model. Alternatively, designers may create the 
design in a CAD/CAM system and then build a clay model. Almost all companies still 
produce full-size clay models toward the end of the design process. These models can 
produce surprises that manufacturers want to avoid before a vehicle enters the tooling 
and production phases. 
 Given the value of prototyping and advances in many fields, rapid prototyping (RP) 
has been in existence for some time and is a common practice today ( 3D printing  is a 
common name for RP). Two factors contribute to the popularity of RP. First, CAD mod-
els can easily be converted for prototyping. Second, RP hardware prices have been fall-
ing while RP quality has been rising, thus enabling many companies of all sizes and 
academic institutions to acquire RP machines. The most common machine is a 3D 
printer that is a desktop machine. 
 Although RP started as a method of verifying and prototyping designs, it is now 
used to produce parts that are included in actual products. Also, prototypes can be used 
as master patterns for injection molding core and cavity inserts, thermoforming, blow 
molding, and various metal casting processes. That is due to the advancements in 
 CHAPTER

Chapter 14: Rapid Prototyping
prototyping material strength, the accuracy of the building process, and the ability to 
build prototypes very fast. 
 Considered as a manufacturing process, RP is distinctively different from tradi-
tional manufacturing. RP is a process that is typically referred to as  additive manufactur-
ing  because the process involves adding successive layers of material to build the 
prototype. In contrast, traditional manufacturing processes such as milling, drilling, 
and turning are considered to be  subtractive manufacturing because each process 
involves starting with a blank (stock) and removing or carving out material until we 
obtain the final shape. 
 The primary advantage of additive manufacturing is its ability to create any shape or 
geometric feature. Another advantage is that RP is a WYSIWYG (what you see is what 
you get) process whereby the physical (manufactured) model and the RP virtual model 
are identical, unlike traditional manufacturing where the stock and the final product are 
very different from each other. 
 There are key benefits to RP, including time and cost savings as well as accuracy. A 
prototype can always be produced in several hours to several days, depending on the 
type of RP machine used and the size and complexity of the model. The accuracy of 
building a prototype is comparable to traditional manufacturing. Example tolerances are 
;0.005 and 0.0015 in. Other benefits of RP are as follows: 
  
1.  Objects of any geometric complexity or intricacy can be produced  
  
2.  There is no need for an elaborate machine setup or final assembly  
  
3.  The construction is manageable, straightforward, and relatively fast  
  
4.  It reduces time to market  
  
5.  RP helps you to better understand and communicate product designs  
  
6.  It allows us to make rapid tooling for injection molding and investment casting  
  
7.  RP may be less expensive than traditional manufacturing  
 14.2  Applications 
 By industry sector, the automotive industry is by far the largest user of RP due to the 
complexity of the CAD models common to automotive designs such as engine blocks, 
intake manifolds, or exhaust systems. RP has been utilized in many applications beyond 
its original intended one (prototyping). Here is a list of some common applications: 
  
1.  Prototyping (visualization):    Holding a prototype in hand, turning it around, and 
looking at it from all sides is the best way to visualize it; and, yes, it is better than 
visualizing a 3D CAD model on the screen. No matter how experienced a designer 
is at reading blueprints and CAD images of a complex object, it is still very difficult 
to visualize exactly the actual part. Blind holes, complex interior details, and 
complex free-form surfaces often lead to wrong interpretations. Analogous to the 
“a picture is worth a thousand words” saying, we have “a prototype is worth a 
thousand pictures.”  
  
2.  Verification:    Due to the fast build speed of RP, designers have ample time to modify 
and remodify a design and verify it at a reasonable cost and well within the 
production and release deadlines. More often than not, especially under deadline 
pressures, we tend to forgo minor errors although we catch them and know they 
are there. We tend to fix them in the next revisions. RP helps eliminate this 
attitude and provide timely visual verification of designs, with reasonable cost.  
  
3.  Testing:   A designer may need to produce a prototype to test the design before 
finalizing. An example is testing an airfoil shape by placing it in a wind tunnel. 
The designer may redesign the airfoil based on the test results.  

Chapter 14: Rapid Prototyping
419
  
4.  Optimization:    This can be thought of as an extension of iterating a design. Design 
iteration may produce multiple designs to choose from. Optimization criteria 
could range from size, to weight, to aesthetic appearance.  
  
5.  Fabrication:    This is an important application of RP that was not intended initially. 
The use of prototypes as final parts for use is very beneficial because it allows us to 
speed up production. RP is an essential concept to rapid manufacturing. Sample 
RP parts that are used as end products, or as components in products, include 
knee and hip replacements ( Figure   14.1  ), dentures, and ankle bracelets. A com-
mon theme among these parts is customizations. Typically, a medical imaging of 
the patient part (knee, hip, mouth, or ankle) is generated via imaging software. 
The image is then converted to a CAD model that is used to generate the RP parts. 
Such a process guarantees a perfect fit of the RP body part in its final placement.     
 14.3  Overview 
 RP is known by various other names: 3D printing, solid free-form fabrication, desktop 
manufacturing, and layered manufacturing.  Rapid prototyping  is a process that creates 
physical parts/products from CAD models. The underlying concept of RP is to build a 
prototype in layers (slices) one on top of the other, from the bottom up. The RP software 
slices the model into horizontal slices, and the RP hardware (machine) builds the proto-
type one slice at a time. Stacking the slices up builds the prototype. 
 Figure  14.2 shows a schematic of the RP process. This schematic is used by any RP 
process regardless of its details. The steps of the process are as follows: 
  
1.  Create the CAD model of the part or assembly:    RP is capable of creating one single 
part or an assembly. Any gaps or loose parts in the assembly are built as such. An 
assembly created via RP is a functional one.

2.  Perform pre-processing:    The CAD/CAM software triangulates the CAD model and 
saves the related data in a file in stereolithography (STL) format. This file is 
transferred to the RP software that reads it, slices the CAD triangulated data, and 
saves the slice data in a new “build” file.  
  
3.  Build the prototype:    The RP machine reads the build file and builds the prototype, 
one slice at a time.  
  
4.  Perform post-processing:    The prototype from Step 3 requires cleanup at minimum. 
In some instances, it may need further processing including baking, polishing, and 
finishing.   
 14.4  Concepts 
 An RP process uses a set of concepts regardless of the different commercial implementa-
tions. Even though different RP vendors use different RP techniques and build different 
machines, they all use the same concepts, which are triangulation (tessellation), build 
orientation, layering (slicing) thickness, and support structure. 
  A.  Triangulation (tessellation):    Triangulation represents the first step in the RP process. 
A CAD/CAM software accesses its B-rep of a CAD model and uses it to triangulate 
the model. Triangulating a model means converting its B-rep (all faces) to triangles 
(representing and preserving the model topology), as shown in  Figure   14.3 . The 
designer can control the accuracy of triangulating the model.  Figure   14.3 shows 
three different accuracy (resolution) levels generated using SolidWorks. The 
accuracy directly affects the quality of the resulting physical prototype: the higher 
the triangulation resolution, the better the quality and accuracy of the prototype. 
The designer should use higher resolution if the resulting prototype is used as a 
final product or for experimental testing. Low or medium resolution should suffice 
if the model is used for visualization or verification. 
 Figure  14.3 shows that the resolution affects only the nonplanar faces of a 
CAD model. The top face shown in  Figure   14.3  is triangulated into two faces 
regardless of the resolution we use. The front planar face of the model has many

triangles because it is affected by the triangulation of the cylindrical face. It is this 
face that is affected significantly by the resolution.      
  B.  Build orientation:    The build orientation of a prototype affects its build time and its 
support structure.  Figure   14.4  shows what we mean by build orientation. The 
figure shows a block with a hole in the center and demonstrates two build orienta-
tions: horizontal and vertical. The horizontal orientation shown in  Figure  14.4  A is 
better to use for this part because it needs no support structure, and therefore less 
build time (We have found out that the resolution of the triangulation has an 
insignificant impact, if any at all, on the build time). We can control the triangu-
lated (faceted) model orientation in the RP software regardless of the model 
orientation in the CAD/CAM software. Also, the RP software allows us to manipu-
late (rotate, translate, and/or scale up or down) the triangulated model.   
 (B) Vertical orientation  
 FIGURE 14.4 
 Build orientation of a model 
 (A) Horizontal orientation  
  C.  Layering (slicing):    The layer (slice) thickness affects RP in two ways: model accuracy 
and build time. The user controls the layer thickness in the RP software during the 
slicing step. The larger the number of slices, the smaller the slice thickness, and 
therefore the higher the build time and the more accurate the model.  Figure  14.5  
shows a schematic to illustrate the effect of the slice thickness.      
 (B) Thick layers (slices)  
 (C) Thin layers (slices)  
 FIGURE 14.5 
 Effect of layer thickness 
 (A) Model 
  D.  Support structure:    Support structure is needed to build the prototype slice by slice. 
The structure serves as scaffolding. We need a support structure any time the 
model boundary starts curving into nonmaterial zones. Consider building the 
prototype of the model shown in  Figure   14.4  . Building the prototype in the 
horizontal orientation ( Figure   14.4  A) does not require any support structure 
because each new slice is fully supported by the previously built slice. However, 
building the model in the vertical orientation ( Figure   14.4  B) requires a support 
structure immediately after we reach half the hole. After the half mark, the hole 

422
Chapter 14: Rapid Prototyping
slices start hanging inward into the air, thus requiring support; otherwise, they fall 
to the hole bottom. In anticipation of this need, the RP software begins building 
the support structure from the base up along with building the prototype slices as 
shown in  Figure  14.4  B. 
 Keep in mind that the RP build material is usually in a liquid or semiliquid 
state during build time. Thus, it does not have the strength to hold its own weight. 
Note that the support structure for the hole, shown in  Figure   14.4  B, extends all 
the way down to the bottom of the RP platform to transfer the weight to the 
ground. RP software figures out the needed support structure automatically based 
on the orientation of the sliced model. The only intervention that the user does is 
to orient the model properly to avoid triggering the need for support structure as 
much as possible, as  Figure   14.4  shows. 
 
  
If a support structure cannot be avoided, the user must use the orientation 
that produces the least support structure. Support structures should be avoided 
as much as possible because they increase both the build time and the post-
processing (cleanup) time, as well as consuming more material to build the 
prototype. A support structure is usually built from a separate material that is 
weaker than the build material itself. The support structure is also built as a weak 
structure so that it is easily broken and removed during the post-processing of the 
prototype. Typical shapes of support structures are honeycomb or thin strips. 
 
  
A special type of support structure is the base support structure. Unlike a 
support structure, a base support structure cannot be avoided at all. It is a struc-
ture that the RP machine inserts between its platform and the prototype it builds. 
This structure is needed to facilitate removing the prototype from the machine 
platform.  Figure   14.6  shows an example of a base support structure. After the RP 
process is complete, the prototype is broken (sheared) off the platform by hand or 
with the help of a knife.

 14.5  SolidWorks Triangulation 
 Generating an STL (triangulated) file from a CAD model is a simple one-step activity. 
When we save the CAD model, we save it in STL format, thus generating a file with the 
. stl extension. We transfer the file to a RP machine via any common method (USB, net-
work, e-mail, CD, or DVD). We open the file using the RP software and process it to 
generate the build (slices) file. Thus, we view the STL file as the interface between the 
CAD/CAM system and the RP machine. 
 While a CAD part or assembly is open in SolidWorks, click this sequence:  File 
(menu) >  Save As  > select  STL (*.stl)  from the  Save as type drop-down list >  Save . We 
can save the parts of an assembly into one file by checking off the box shown in  Figure 
 14.7 . In such a case, the assembly is built as one prototype; otherwise, its parts are built 
individually and must be assembled manually. In some assemblies, this is not possible. 
 SolidWorks allows us to control the resolution of the model triangulation (see 
 Figure   14.3 ) before saving the file. Click the  Options button on the  Save As  window 

Chapter 14: Rapid Prototyping

(not shown here) to access the  Export Options  window shown in  Figure   14.7 . As also 
shown, we can generate a binary or ASCII file. We usually use the binary format because 
the size of the resulting file is smaller than the ASCII file.  
 There are three resolutions to select from as shown in  Figure   14.7  :  Coarse ,  Fine , 
and  Custom . In addition, there are two tolerances that affect quality of the triangula-
tion:  Deviation and  Angle . Triangulation replaces the CAD model with a faceted model 
that consists of facets (triangles). A  facet is a small planar (flat) face that is a triangle. 
These facets need to be as close as possible to the model face (surface) they replace. Such 
closeness is a measure of the quality of the model tessellation. It is controlled by specify-
ing the  Deviation and  Angle tolerances shown in  Figure   14.7  and explained in  Figure 
 14.8 . The smaller these tolerances, the more accurate the STL representation of the CAD 
model is. Deviation tolerance controls the maximum distance allowed between the edge 
of a facet and the edge of the corresponding face (surface) of the part, as shown in  Figure 
 14.8 A. Deviation is also known as the  chord distance or the  surface tolerance . Angle toler-
ance controls the change of orientation between two adjacent facets, as measured by the 
angle between their normal vectors as shown in  Figure   14.8  B.

Chapter 14: Rapid Prototyping
 14.6  Steps 
 Section   14.3 provides an overview of the RP steps that start with a CAD model and end 
with a prototype of the model. We elaborate on these steps here. 
  
1.  Create the CAD model of the part or assembly:    This step does not require any 
special attention because of RP. RP is just another application like mass properties 
and FEM/FEA. 
  
2.  Perform pre-processing:    The pre-processing starts in the CAD/CAM software and 
ends in the RP software. Save the CAD part as an STL file. The file contains the 
coordinates of the vertices of the triangles (facets) and the outward normal vectors 
of these triangles. 
 Model orientation used for building the part is important for several reasons. 
First, properties of prototypes vary from one coordinate direction to another. For 
example, prototypes are usually weaker and less accurate in the Z direction than in 
the XY plane. Second, part orientation partially determines the amount of time 
required to build the model. Placing the shortest dimension in the Z direction 
reduces the number of layers or slices, thereby shortening the build time. 
 The RP software uses a layer thickness ranging from 0.01 mm to 0.7 mm, 
depending on the RP technique in use. The program may also generate a support 
(auxiliary) structure to support the model during the build. The sliced model and 
its support structure are stored in a build file.  
  
3.  Build the prototype:    In this step the RP machine actually begins constructing the 
prototype using the build file. The RP machine builds one layer (slice) at a time 
using RP build material such as polymer (resin), paper, or powdered metal. Most 
machines are fairly autonomous, needing little human intervention.  
  
4.  Perform post-processing:    This is the final step. It involves removing the prototype 
from the machine and detaching the support structures that have been built. Some 
photosensitive materials need to be fully cured before use. Prototypes may also 
require minor cleaning and surface treatment. Sanding, sealing, and/or painting the 
model usually improve its appearance and durability, and may be done if needed.  
 14.7  Building Techniques 
 Stereolithography apparatus (SLA) is commonly considered to have been the first RP 
technique (machine). It was developed by 3D Systems. Since then, a number of different 
RP techniques have become available. The following RP techniques are used by com-
mercial RP systems: 
 ■  Stereolithography (SLA) 
 ■  Laminated object manufacturing (LOM)  
 ■  Selective laser sintering (SLS)  
 ■  Fused deposition modeling (FDM)  
 ■  Solid ground curing (SGC)  
 ■  3D printing (3DP) 
 Each RP technique uses a certain build material and a corresponding process to build 
and cure the material. For example, SLA, LOM, SLS, and FDM use, respectively, pho-
topolymer (resin), paper, thermoplastic/metal powder, and thermoplastic/eutectic met-
als or wax. 
 As for the curing process, SLA uses a laser to solidify the resin layers. LOM glues the 
layers together and cuts them to shape with a knife or laser cutter. SLS curing is similar

to SLA. FDM deposits molten material as beads following the layer cross-section bound-
ary. SGC uses a laser to harden resin, similar to SLA. 
 3D printing uses many materials, for example, powdered ceramics, powdered plas-
tics, ABS, thermoplastics, and Ultem. 3D printing uses layering like the other tech-
niques, but it is generally faster, more affordable, and easier to use. 3D printing has the 
ability to use several materials in the same build process, which is useful for prototyping 
an assembly made of numerous materials. 3D printing is used in jewelry, footwear, den-
tal, medical, automotive, aerospace, and other industries.  
 14.8  Bottle Prototype 
 This section provides a complete example from slicing an STL file to building and clean-
ing the prototype. We create a prototype of the bottle shown in  Figure   14.9  . We select 
this bottle because of the interesting challenges it offers. First, what is the best orienta-
tion to build it: horizontal or vertical? Second, what is the effect of its curved bottom on 
the base support structure? Here are the generic steps to create the prototype:     
  
1.  Create the CAD model:    Figures  14.9 A and 14.9B show the bottle model. All dimen-
sions are in inches. It is a revolve.  
  
2.  Generate the STL file:   Use  Fine resolution ( Figure   14.7  ), and export the CAD model 
as an STL file:  File > Save As > STL format >  Options > Fine > enter bottle for 
file name >  Save .  Figure   14.9  C shows the STL model.  
  
3.  Generate the build file:   The RP machine software reads the STL file and displays the 
model. It also provides the designer with functions to manipulate the model: pan, 
rotate, and scale. This model is best built in the vertical orientation shown in 
 Figure  14.9 C. 
 After setting up the model orientation, we select the slicing thickness (layer 
resolution). The RP software allows us to select from a recommended resolution 
list because the slice thickness is determined based on the RP machine build 
accuracy, the build material, and other factors.

Chapter 14: Rapid Prototyping
 We then select the style of the support structure (break-away, sparse, or other 
type). The base support structure fills the curved gap at the bottom of the bottle to 
support the layer build as it goes up in the Z direction. The support structure is 
created inside the bottle and extends from the curved bottom of the bottle all the 
way up to the bottom of its neck ( Figure   14.9  C). 
 RP machines are designed to build more than one prototype in one build to 
alleviate the long build time. If we can fit multiple models on the machine plat-
form, the machine builds them concurrently. 
 The output from the software is a proprietary build file that the RP machine 
reads to build the prototype.  
  
4.  Build the bottle prototype:    Start the machine to build. Make sure there are enough 
build and support materials. The machine builds and does not have to be attended 
during build.  Figure   14.10  shows the build progress, the machine platform on 
which the model is built, and the final model.

5.  Remove and clean up the prototype:    This is the post-processing of the prototype. 
Use a putty knife to separate the prototype from the machine platform. Once 
separated, clean up the bottom of the bottle by scraping it. Removing the support 
structure from inside the bottle prototype requires more careful handling or a 
dissolving solution in which we submerge the model for a period of time.  
 14.9  Tutorials 
 The theme for the tutorials in this chapter is to practice the triangulation concepts of 
SolidWorks faceting. Other important concepts such as investigating orientation, slic-
ing, and support structure are not covered because they are machine dependent.

Tutorial 14–3:  Read Back an STL File 
 We read (open) the STL files we created in  Tutorials   14–1  and   14–2  back in Solid-
Works. Note that SolidWorks converts the STL to a “dumb” solid because it cannot rec-
ognize its features or create a features tree for it. Thus, we cannot edit any of the original 
features of the part or edit the assembly mates of the assembly. Unlike reading IGES of 
STEP files, SolidWorks (or any CAD/CAM system) has no way of knowing part features 
or assembly components from the STL file because the file is only a B-rep; all it has are 
the facets (triangles) defining the model faces.

 Numerical Control Machining  
 15.1  Introduction 
 Manufacturing a part is the culmination of product design.  We discussed the manufacturing 
and CAM processes in  Chapter   1 .  A variety of manufacturing processes exists. The manufac-
turing engineer (process planner) selects a suitable manufacturing process depending on the 
part material and design tolerances. The process planner typically has a strong background 
in and knowledge of manufacturing processes. With this knowledge, the planner may 
request design changes from the design engineers to simplify part manufacturing and, as a 
result, reduce manufacturing cost. For example, machining a flat blind hole is harder and 
more expensive than machining a conical blind hole. The former requires a milling operation 
with a flat end mill, whereas the latter requires a drilling operation with a drill bit. 
 Different types of manufacturing also exist. Mass production is the type of manufac-
turing in which hundreds or thousands of the same part or product are produced on a 
mass scale. Examples include consumer products such as cars, cell phones, and comput-
ers, to name a few. The advantage of mass production is the cost reduction realized from 
setting up a production operation once to produce many units. Another type of manu-
facturing is job shop, which is the other extreme. In job shop, we produce either one-
of-a-kind pieces or a small number (tens) of units. There is also the concept of mass 
customization whereby companies try to combine the benefits of scale (less cost) with 
the benefits of meeting customer requirements. 
 The existing manufacturing processes (methods or operations) can be categorized 
based on the material they can process. The oldest traditional methods are cutting met-
als (steel and aluminum). These processes include turning, drilling, milling, grinding, 
boring (used for large holes), reaming (used for holes up to 1-inch diameter), lapping 
and honing, broaching, casting, forging, and EDM (electrical discharge machining). 
Manufacturing methods for polymers and plastics include injection molding. 
 A machining process directly influences the part accuracy and surface quality 
(roughness). For example, a turning process produces less surface quality than do hon-
ing and lapping. Milling is much better than casting and forging. 
 We cover only four basic machining processes in this chapter: turning, drilling, mill-
ing, and EDM. The goal is to provide a basic understanding of machining so we can 
become better designers and be able to connect design and manufacturing. Thus, we will 
understand the production and cost implications of specifying tighter or looser tolerances. 
 Machining processes can be done manually or programmatically. Although manual 
machining is not used too often, it still serves as a good foundation to learn machining. Pro-
grammed machines are more common. These computer-controlled machines are known as 
 NC (numerical control or numerically controlled)  machines . Machine shops may have both 
manual and NC machines. We cover NC machines here and how to program them.

 15.2  Basics of Machine Tools 
 Machining machines are known as  machine tools . A  machine tool  is a manufacturing 
machine that performs one or more machining operations. For example, we can perform 
milling, drilling, reaming, boring, tapping, and threading using a milling machine. We 
need to understand both how machine tools work and what the basics of NC machining 
are. This section covers the basics of machine tools. Subsequent sections cover the basics 
of NC machining.  Figure   15.1  shows sample machines. (We use the terms  machine tools 
and  machines interchangeably throughout the chapter.)

 Figure   15.2 shows abstractions (schematics) of the machine tools shown in  Figure 
 15.1 . The abstract machine tool helps us understand its basics and its setup and opera-
tions. A machine tool has a solid heavy frame typically made out of cast iron. The bed, 
column (part that holds the head), and head shown in  Figure   15.2  are part of the

machine frame. The machine also has a table that moves in two orthogonal directions 
controlled by two lead screws, one for each direction. Each machine has its own Carte-
sian coordinate system. The table of a milling machine moves in the X and Y directions 
shown in  Figure   15.2 B, whereas the table of a lathe moves in the X and Z directions 
shown in  Figure  15.2 A. The cutting tool always moves in the Z direction as shown. The 
positive Z direction is always pointing away from the workpiece by convention.   
 The workpiece is fixed securely to the machine table via jigs and fixtures that also 
ensure aligning the workpiece relative to the machine table and the cutting tool for

 correct machining. The lathe has a chuck (instead of jigs and fixtures for a milling machine) 
to hold the workpiece. If the machine is numerically controlled, it has an NC controller. 
Manual machines do not have controllers. The machine head is where the power is trans-
ferred from the machine motor to rotate the cutting tool at high cutting speed. 
 We describe the operations of the two machine tools shown in  Figure   15.2  . A turn-
ing machine (lathe) is typically used to machine axisymmetric cylindrical parts such as 
shafts and cylinders. Those are the revolves we create using CAD/CAM software. A mill-
ing machine can perform many operations including drilling holes, tapping holes, and 
milling part surfaces of any shape. Extrusions we create using CAD/CAM software are 
manufactured on milling machines. 
 The machining operation of a part begins by setting up the machine. The setup 
starts by mounting and securely fixing the workpiece (known as  stock ) on the machine 
table by the machine operator (machinist). Next, the machinist establishes the machine 
reference point (known as the  machine zero ) and the workpiece reference point (known 
as the  workpiece zero ). The machinist must align these two zeros to machine the work-
piece correctly. When the machine setup is complete, the machinist turns on the 
machine power and the machine begins cutting (removing material from) the work-
piece. If the machine is manual, the machinist moves the machine table manually. If it 
is an NC machine, the machinist loads the NC program (code) to the machine controller 
and starts the controller to execute the program. 
 The machining operation could be wet or dry. Each machine tool has a coolant sys-
tem that cycles cutting fluid or coolant (oil or water-miscible fluid) (see  Figure   15.1  A). 
The machinist points the coolant nozzle to pour the coolant continuously on the cutting 
tool and the workpiece. The coolant is caught in a tub under the machine bed, gets fil-
tered from the machining chips, and then is recycled again. Dry machining does not use 
coolant. The advantages of wet machining are twofold: it produces better surface finish 
than does dry machining, and it elongates the cutting tool life (does not get dull quickly). 
NC programming provides commands to control the coolant, that is, turn it on or off. 
 The skills of the machinist determine the accuracy and the quality of the finished 
parts. The machinist’s skills are more crucial in manual machining than in NC machin-
ing. After machining is finished, the machinist removes the finished part. Further 
machining or processing on other machines may be required. After all machining is 
complete, the parts move to inspection and then are assembled into their intended prod-
ucts (assemblies).  
 15.3  Basics of Machining 
 Controlling the position and the motion of the cutting tool while it is removing (chip-
ping) material (chips) away from a workpiece is essential and follows well-established 
concepts that include motion axes, cutting parameters, home position, toolpaths, and 
other topics that we cover here. 
  
1.  Motion axes:     Motion axes of a machine tool determine the versatility of the 
machine and what type of surfaces (faces) it can cut. An  axis defines a degree of 
freedom (DOF) along which a cutting tool can move. In 3D space, there is a 
maximum of six DOF: three translations along the  X -,  Y -,  Z -axes and three rota-
tions around these axes. However, a machine tool may have more than six DOF. 
There exist 2-axis, 3-axis, and multi-axis machine tools. A multi-axis machine tool 
has many DOF, sometimes up to 10. 
 A 2-axis machine tool means that its cutting tool can move along two axes 
only and simultaneously. An example is a lathe in which the tool moves along the 
 Z -axis (length of workpiece being turned) and the  X -axis (into the workpiece to 

Chapter 15: Numerical Control Machining
435
remove material), as shown in  Figure   15.2  A. In a 3-axis machine, the tool can 
move along three axes ( X ,  Y ,  Z ) simultaneously. A 3-axis milling machine provides 
an example. Most milling machines are 3-axis because you can machine any 
complex surface by controlling the tool motion along three axes. Additional DOF 
could be added either as rotations about  X -,  Y -,  Z -axes or as translations of other 
parts of the machine (in addition to the tool translation). These additional DOF 
enable machining very complex parts as found typically in the aerospace industry. 
Milling machines with more than three DOF are typically referred to as machining 
centers. For example, a 4-axis machine has  X ,  Y , and  Z , and a fully rotating table 
that can rotate simultaneously while the tool is moving and cutting. 
 Some machine tools (specifically milling machines) are 2 ½ -axis or 3 ½ -axis 
machines. The  ½ axis designation means that the motion along this axis is limited. 
For example, a 2 ½ -axis milling machine means that its cutting tool can mill any 
shape (cross section) in a plane that is not parallel to the XY plane of the machine 
(if the plane is parallel to the table, we have a 2-axis machine tool). A 3 ½ -axis 
machine has  X ,  Y , and  Z as its primary axes of motion, plus an indexing table 
designated as axis  A . The indexing table is used for positioning; it cannot rotate 
simultaneously with the motion of the primary axes.  
  
2.  Cutting tools:     Cutting tools are made of special materials and have special shapes. 
These materials must be harder than any material the tool is intended to cut; 
otherwise, the tool will not be able to cut it. The harder the cutting tool material, 
the more resistant it is to wear and thus the longer its life. Cutting tool materials 
include HSS (high speed steel), cobalt, carbide, titanium, and diamond. HSS is the 
softest material and diamond is the hardest material. The harder the material, the 
more expensive the cutting tool is, the heavier (more weight) it is, and the greater 
speed and feedrate it can run at. 
 Another important characteristic of cutting tools is the number of flutes. A  flute  
is defined as a helical groove in the tool along its length (shank) to remove chips (cut 
material) away from the tool cutting edges (teeth) as the tool rotates. As the tool cuts 
into the material, the chips need a path to get out. A tool has multiple flutes depend-
ing on how many cutting edges it has.  Figure   15.3 shows 2-flute, 3-flute, 4-flute, 
and 6-flute cutting tools. An  n -flute tool has  n cutting teeth; each tooth has its flute. 
 A third important characteristic of cutting tools is what their cutting ends look 
like. For example, a drill always has a conical end; this is why blind holes always 
have conical ends. There exist flat- or ball-end mills. Flat-end mill ( Figure   15.3  D, 
E, and F) performs flat surface milling whereas ball-end mill ( Figure   15.3 C) 
performs pocket milling. Counterbore and countersink tools are shaped as shown 
in  Figure  15.3G and H  . Counterbores and countersinks are used to create grooves 
to hide heads of bolts and screws and make them flush with intended part sur-
faces, usually for esthetic and safety purposes. 
 Many types of cutting tools exist to support the varied cutting processes. For 
example, we have tools for turning, drilling, milling, and threading. Many tools exist 
for each process.  Figure  15.3 shows some tools for some processes. Tools are usually 
designated by various parameters, depending on the tool. For example, drills and 
mills are designated by the tool diameter (not used here), number of flutes, and the 
end type; for example, 2-flute drill, 3-flute flat-end rough mill, or 3-flute ball-end 
mill. A tapping tool is used to make threads in a hole. Think of it as thread male. An 
example of tapping tool designation is 9/16 # 18NF ( Figure  15.3 J), referring to the 
thread outer diameter (9/16 inch); number of teeth per inch, or tpi (18); and the 
thread type (NF). Two thread types exist. One type is unified fine (UNF), which is 
referred to as NF (national fine) in the retail industry. The other type is unified 
coarse (UNC), which is known as NC (national coarse) in retail.

3.  Stock:    A  stock is a large material from which workpieces can be cut. The standard 
stock shapes are shown in  Figure   15.4  . Companies typically buy stocks of different 
materials. When needed, they cut workpieces from stocks and machine them to 
make parts. The terms  stock and  workpiece are usually used interchangeably. Work-
piece dimensions are always larger than the dimensions of the finished part to 
allow for machining down (removing material) the stock. Stock dimensions may 
be 1/8 to  ¼ inch larger than those of a finished part. The rule is that we always 
select a stock shape and dimensions as close as we can to the finished part to 
minimize material waste and avoid longer machining time.

4.  Machining parameters:     These parameters include the spindle (rotation) speed (also 
known as  cutting speed ), feedrate, and depth of cut, as shown in  Figure   15.5 . 
Notice that the workpiece rotates in place and the cutting tool moves in turning. 
The opposite is true for milling: The workpiece moves and the cutting tool rotates 
in place. A turning, drilling, milling, tapping, or other similar cutting tool is 
connected to the machine head via a chuck. The chuck grips the tool and keeps it 
securely in place. A tool rotates as it penetrates the workpiece to cut it. This 
rotation, known as the  spindle speed , is measured in rpm (revolution per minute).

The tool chuck is connected to the machine motor spindle that transmits the 
rotation from the machine motor to the tool.   
 The feedrate is how fast the cutting tool is removing material from the workpiece; 
that is, it is the linear speed of the cutting tool, measured in feet or inches per minute. 
Units are typically feet per minute (fpm). Fast feedrates result in rough surface finish. 
The value of a feedrate depends on the materials of both the workpiece and the 
cutting tool. Excessive feedrate or cutting depth could result in breaking the tool due 
to the extreme force exerted on the tool from the workpiece material. 
 The depth of cut (cutting depth) is the thickness of the material that the 
cutting tool removes from the workpiece as it travels in contact with the work-
piece. This thickness represents one “pass” of the cutting tool over the work-
piece. If we need to remove more material than the depth of the cut allows, we 
need multiple passes. Smaller depths result in a smoother surface finish.  
 Most machining operations are conducted on machine tools that have 
rotating spindles. Thus, we relate the machining parameters to the spindle 
speed. The cutting tool rotates with the rotational speed,  N , of the spindle and 
has a diameter,  D . Thus, any point on the outer surface of the tool has a linear 
speed,  S , known as the  cutting speed .  Figure   15.6  shows the view looking 
down at the cutting tool along its axis. We relate the spindle rotational 
(angular) speed and the tool surface (linear) speed as follows: 
 
 N = 12S
pD 
(15.1) 
 
  where  N is in rpm (revolution per minute),  D is in inches, and  S is in feet per 
minute. Equation (15.1) is based on the simple equation of angular motion,   v = vr . 
Sometimes we write  S as  SFM (surface feet per minute). Thus, Eq. (15.1) becomes: 
 
  N = 12SFM
pD  
(15.2)  
 
  In turning,  D is the diameter of the workpiece being turned; in milling, drilling, 
reaming, and other operations that use a rotating tool,  D is the cutter diameter. 
 The calculation of the feedrate requires knowing the tooth load during cutting 
and the number of teeth (flutes) of the tool. The load is the force that the work-
piece exerts on the tool during cutting. The feedrate is given by the following 
equation: 
 
  F = FtTN = FrevN 
(15.3)  
 
  where  F is the feedrate (inches per minute),  F t  is the tooth load (feed/tooth) in 
inches per tooth,  T is the number of teeth, and  N is the spindle speed (rpm).  F t  is 
also known as the  chip load , which is the size or amount (measured in inches per 
tooth, ipt) of chip that each tooth of the cutter can remove in one revolution.  F is 
the distance that the cutting tool advances per minute.  F rev is the distance that the 
cutting tool advances during one revolution of the spindle measured in in./rev, 
and is given by: 
 
  Frev = FtT 
(15.4)  
 
   F rev is sometimes known as  cutting feed . The time it takes to machine a length  L of a 
workpiece is given by  L/F in minutes. This is the time the tool needs to travel the 
distance  L . 
 Toolmakers publish tables of spindle speed, SFM, and feedrate. Also, machin-
ery handbooks publish similar tables. SFM tables are typically given for a tool

diameter,  D , of 1 inch. The most common number of tool teeth is 2, 3, or 4. Here 
are some example values of machining parameters. Use spindle speed and feedrate 
of 5000 rpm and 1 in./min, respectively, if we are roughing steel workpiece with 
carbide cutting tool, and 2000 rpm and 1 in./min if we are finishing it. If we are 
cutting aluminum with a carbide tool, we use 10,000 to 15,000 rpm for roughing 
and 5000 rpm for finishing, and 2 in./min for feedrate for both. 
 There are so many factors and variables that influence the selection of spindle 
speed and feedrate. These variables include materials and coatings of cutting tools, 
methods of holding the tools, different material properties of materials being cut, 
toolpath software, and cutting technique. Realizing these ever-changing values, NC 
machining software provides its users the ability to populate their cutting libraries 
and databases with new cutting values as they become available. However, NC 
software may provide what is called “out-of-the-box” values for machining param-
eters. These values are usually approximate. Interested readers should consult with 
their toolmakers and machine makers for the latest and most accurate values for 
machining parameters.  
  
5.  Machining quality:     When we remove material away from a workpiece, we keep two 
goals in mind: removal speed and quality of surface finish. We need to cut (chip) 
away material as fast as possible while producing a high-quality surface finish. To 
achieve this compromise, we adopt a simple but effective strategy: roughing 
followed by finishing. In a roughing operation, we cut away large amounts of 
material, leaving a poor surface finish. In a finishing operation, we remove a 
smaller amount of material, leaving a good surface finish. There exist cutting tools 
for roughing and finishing.  Figure   15.3  D and  Figure   15.3  E show two roughing 
end mill cutters.  Figure   15.3  C and  Figure   15.3  F show two finishing mill cutters. 
  
6.  Squaring stock:     A machinist typically cuts a piece of stock to start a machining 
operation, which then becomes the workpiece. Stocks are typically produced by 
low-quality manufacturing processes to keep their cost down. The machinist 
would need to prepare the stock before machining it to make the final part. Stock 
preparation is what we call  squaring . Squaring means just that: machine the stock 
so that its faces are perfectly normal to each other, within the tolerance limits. 
Squaring begins by milling one side and then gripping the stock correctly with a 
vise to square the other sides, typically by placing the milled side on the machine 
bed; that is, making it horizontal in a vertical milling machine. Mill the opposite 
horizontal side of the stock. When done, ungrip the stock, rotate it, and repeat the 
squaring process to square another side. We continue until we finish squaring the 
stock’s six sides, assuming the stock is a block.  
  
7.  Home position:     The machinist needs to establish the machine zero before cutting. 
This is the home position of the cutting tool. The machine tool indexes this 
location and uses it to measure the tool coordinates during its movements. The 
home position could be a point on or near the workpiece. In an NC machine tool, 
the machine controller uses the home position to interpret the coordinates used in 
an NC program. Typically, the machinist sets the home position to align the tool 
axis with an edge of the workpiece.  
  
8.  Toolpath:     A toolpath represents a machining strategy. Once we decide on a 
machining operation and a cutting tool, we need to decide on the best way to 
perform the cutting. By “best,” we mean finding the shortest and fastest path to cut 
the workpiece. For example,  Figure   15.7  shows four strategies and their toolpaths 
to mill the top face of a workpiece. Which toolpath offers the best strategy? Why? 
The selection of a toolpath depends on machining the part correctly to avoid 
damaging it or requiring repair. For our example, the toolpath that creates the 
least burr in the part is the best. A  burr is a raised edge or small piece of material 

440
Chapter 15: Numerical Control Machining
remaining attached to the workpiece after machining. A burr must be removed via 
another machining process called  deburring . Drilling burrs are common and 
happen in all materials. Deburring adds to and therefore increases the part 
machining cost. 
 Let us investigate the four toolpaths shown in  Figure   15.7  . The zigzag toolpath 
is the best and is typically used to mill a face because it produces the least burr. 
Also, the tool ends up at the end of the part all the time. The perimeter toolpath 
creates more burr all around the edges if you cut from the center of the face and out 
to the edges (called  in-out ). If the tool cuts its way in (called  out-in ) to reduce the 
burr, you create another problem because the tool leaves a spot (mark) at the center 
of the part because it has to spin there while not moving to mill the last area. The L 
and L-R-L (L Reverse L) toolpaths are a waste of time because we would waste time 
moving the tool to the beginning of the cut ( Figure   15.7  C), or we would need two 
moves to reverse the tool motion ( Figure   15.7  D). CAM software always defaults to 
the best toolpath to machine a feature. It also provides different types of toolpaths 
and allows the machinist to select a toolpath based on his or her experience.

 Toolpaths come in two types depending on the machining operation: PTP 
(also called  positioning ) or continuous (also called  contouring ). In PTP (point-to-
point) machining, the tool is not in constant contact with the workpiece during its 
motion. Drilling is an example of PTP machining. The cutting tool is in contact 
with the workpiece only momentarily to drill the hole at the desired point (loca-
tion). The tool does not contact the workpiece during its travel from one point to 
another.  Figure  15.8  A shows a PTP toolpath to drill holes. In continuous path 
machining, the tool is in constant contact with the workpiece, as in the case of face 
or side (contour) milling, as shown in  Figure   15.8  B.   
 While the tool is moving without being in contact with the workpiece, how 
high should it “fly” above the workpiece top face to clear it? In practice, machinists 
typically use 0.1 inch (read as 100 thousandths of an inch). Some may use half 
this height (i.e., 50 thousandths of an inch). We need smaller heights to save time 
in moving the tool toward and away from the workpiece. 
 The coordinates of key points on a toolpath are measured with respect to the 
part coordinate system, which is typically the MCS of the part CAD model. CAM 

Chapter 15: Numerical Control Machining
441
software generates the toolpath using the MCS coordinates. The correct machining 
of the part requires the machinist to align the workpiece (part) coordinate system 
with that of the machine. Also, the machinist should align the zero (origin) of the 
workpiece (MCS) with the machine zero. Without the correct alignment between 
the workpiece and machine coordinate systems, the machine controller interprets 
the toolpath incorrectly, rendering the workpiece as scrap.  
 The coordinates of a point on the toolpath may be expressed in 
absolute or relative coordinates. In the absolute system, the coordi-
nates are always measured with respect to the machine zero (origin of 
the MCS). In the relative system, the coordinates are measured with 
respect to the last location of the tool. For example, consider  Figure 
 15.9 . Assuming that the two holes,  A and  B , are centered in the part, 
the absolute coordinates of their centers are (1, 1) and (2, 1), respec-
tively. The relative coordinates of center  B relative to  A are (1, 0), and 
of center  A relative to  B are (−1, 0). In reaching these values, we move 
the XY coordinate system shown and attach it to the reference point. 
We prefer the absolute coordinate system in practice. The major 
drawback of the relative coordinate system is that any toolpath point 
change renders all the coordinates wrong.  
  
9.  Rapid positioning:     We can move the cutting tool at two speeds: rapid and slow. 
When the tool is not in contact with the workpiece while moving, we use rapid 
motion (also known as  rapid positioning ) because we do not have to worry about 
the tool breaking or impacting the workpiece surface finish. For example, we use 
rapid positioning to move a drill from one hole location to another, or to send a 
milling cutter from home position to a workpiece or vice versa.  
 15.4  Turning 
 We provide brief descriptions of some basic machining processes (operations): turn-
ing, drilling, milling, and EDM. We start with turning, which is done on a lathe 
( Figures   15.1A and   15.2A  ). Turning is used for producing axisymmetric (e.g., cylin-
drical or conical) parts, the revolves we create on a CAD/CAM system. The workpiece 
is rotated while the cutting tool moves parallel to the axis of rotation of the work-
piece, as shown in  Figure   15.2 A. Although turning is the machining operation most 
widely done on a lathe, a lathe may also be used for drilling, boring, tapping, facing, 
threading, polishing, grooving, knurling, and trepanning. Each operation uses a dif-
ferent-shaped cutting tool. A workpiece may be held in a 3-, 4-, or 6-jaw chuck, with 
collets, or it may also be held between centers. A single-point tool ( Figure   15.3  A) is 
used for turning.

Chapter 15: Numerical Control Machining
 15.5  Drilling 
 Drilling is a machining operation that creates cylindrical holes in parts. Drilled blind 
holes have a conical end, the same shape as the drill cutter (see  Figure   15.3  B). When we 
drill through (non-blind) holes, we make sure to feed the drill bit (tool) enough so that 
the drill conical end clears the bottom face of the workpiece to ensure the correct size of 
the hole diameter throughout the entire hole length. This would require gripping the 
workpiece appropriately with the jigs and fixtures to ensure that the drill end would not 
hit any of the holding faces. 
 A drilling operation could be done on a turning or milling machine, depending on the 
shape of the workpiece. For example, holes in a flange are drilled on a lathe whereas holes 
in a block are drilled on a milling machine. Sometimes, we may spot a hole before drilling 
it. This means that we use a “spotting drill” bit to make a dent in the workpiece first before 
drilling to locate (establish) the hole center. Other times, we use a “center drill” bit to make 
a conical starting indentation for a larger-sized drill bit used in a lathe drilling operation. 
 In some cases, drilling provides the base operation for other machining operations to 
follow. For example, we may use a reaming operation after drilling if we need a very smooth 
surface finish for the hole.  Figure   15.3 I shows a reamer. Or, we may use a tapping operation 
to create a threaded hole.  Figure   15.3 J shows a tapping cutter. Or, we may add counter-
bores or countersinks to holes.  Figure   15.3 G and  Figure   15.3 H show the corresponding 
cutting tools. Counterbores and countersinks are used to hide a bolt head or a nut. We use 
them either to flush the bolt head or nut with the hole top or bottom face, or to hide them 
a little below the face. This hiding is done for either aesthetic or safety reasons.  
 15.6  Milling 
 Milling is the most common and versatile machining operation. It is done on a milling 
machine or center, and allows us to machine almost any shape imaginable. Milling 
machines may be horizontal or vertical ( Figure   15.1  B and 15.2B); vertical milling 
machines are more popular than horizontal ones. 
 Milling machines are typically 3- or 3 ½ -axis machines. A 3-axis milling machine provides 
3 translations on the cutting tool simultaneously (see  Figure   15.2  B). A 3 ½ -axis provides an 
indexing axis of the machine turret. A  turret is a tool holder (changer) that holds multiple 
tools and changes them automatically between operations. The advantage of a turret is to 
eliminate changing the cutting tool manually between operations, thus saving tool-changing 
time. Milling centers can have more axes, providing rotational DOF and/or auxiliary transla-
tional DOF. Some vertical milling centers have flexible heads. This means that a machine head 
can be tilted from side to side and from front to back to allow for machining flexibility. 
 A variety of milling operations and tools exists. Examples include slot, face, pocket, 
and side (contour) milling. In slot milling, the cutter is a flat-end mill that cuts on its end 
face and periphery (sides). In face milling, the tool cuts with its end face. Milling a 
pocket is similar to milling a slot, but the tool performs multiple passes. In side milling, 
the tool cuts with its periphery and goes around the perimeter of the workpiece.  
 15.7  Electrical Discharge Machining 
 Electrical discharge machining (EDM) is a process that removes material from a work-
piece via an electric spark between two conducting surfaces. (EDM removes material 
via spark erosion.) One surface is an electrode and the other is the workpiece itself. The 
workpiece material must be conductive to electricity. There are two types of EDM: 
sinker (plunge) and wire.  Figure   15.10  shows the two types. What distinguishes the

two types is the shape of the electrode. If the electrode is a block, we have sinker EDM, 
and if it is a wire, we have wire EDM. Sinker EDM is used to make mold (die) cavities 
and stamping dies. Wire EDM is primarily used for through hole machining; that is, to 
make through holes of any shape as shown in  Figure   15.10  D. Depending on the piece 
we want to keep after machining, we can have a hole or the cutout piece as the final 
product.        
 Figure   15.10 B shows a schematic of a sinker EDM machine. The electrode is made 
from copper or graphite and is shaped as the mold or the stamp we need to create. The 
sinker moves up and down as a milling cutting tool. The workpiece is submerged in a 
tank containing dielectric (does not conduct electricity) fluid, usually oil or synthetic 
fluid. The sinker moves up and down only, similar to other cutting tools. The workpiece 
moves along the three axes as shown. When the sinker gets close to the workpiece, an 
electric spark is generated. The spark is strong enough to melt (erode) the workpiece to 
cut it to shape. 
 The dielectric fluid is continuously flowing in the tank. The molten particles from 
the spark drop in the dielectric fluid, which sweeps them away to be filtered out. The 
dielectric fluid is recycled after filtering. In addition to flushing the material away, the 
fluid serves as a coolant to minimize the heat-affected zone, thus preventing potential 
damage to the workpiece. 
 The spark is generated at a controlled frequency. Spark frequency is defined as the 
number of times per second that the electric current is switched on and off. Low fre-
quency is used for roughing the workpiece, and high frequency is used for finishing. 
The material removal is done only during the on time. The longer the on time, the more 
material is removed in each sparking cycle. Roughing operations use extended on time 
for high material removal rates. The resulting craters are broader and deeper. 
 Figure   15.10  D shows a schematic of a wire EDM machine. The operating princi-
ples of a wire EDM are almost the same as those of the sinker EDM. The main differ-
ence is the electrode shape. The wire material could be brass, copper, tungsten, or 
zinc, which all have excellent electric and thermal conductivity. The wire diameter 
ranges from 0.004 to 0.012 in., in increments of 0.002 in. The wire moves over the 
roller like a belt and goes through the workpiece. Unlike the sinker electrode, the 
wire can move in three directions, as shown in  Figure   15.10  D. However, the wire 
motion in the W direction (along its length) is unidirectional. The workpiece also 
moves in three directions. The wire cuts the workpiece and is used only once to 
ensure accuracy and precise cylindrical cuts. Wire EDM machines use deionized 
water as the dielectric fluid. 
 Wire EDM is used primarily for shapes cut through a part or assembly. If a cutout 
needs to be created, an initial hole must be drilled first (using EDM also). Then, the 
wire can be fed through the hole to complete the machining. Keep in mind that the 
wire (negative charge) must never touch the workpiece (positive charge); otherwise, 
we create a short circuit. It is the spark that goes from the wire to the workpiece and 
cuts it. 
 EDM produces parts with high accuracy (tight tolerances of {5 microns; 1 micron = 
1 millionth of a meter) and quality, and it can cut any material that is conductive. EDM 
has many advantages over conventional machining. It is great to use to produce one or 
a few of a complex part (low-volume production) where traditional machining may be 
expensive. Wire EDM produces a burr-free, superior edge finish. It is also useful for 
custom parts such as jewelry or human implants. Wire EDM can cut diamonds or make 
orthopedic implants, aerospace and automotive parts, extrusion dies for rubber and 
plastics, and gears. Cutting with a wire allows us to cut any complex shapes and intricate 
contours. Here the wire is the tool. The wire can take any shape because it is flexible to 
bend and twist along its guides. 

Chapter 15: Numerical Control Machining
445
 EDM can cut through a stack of workpieces (sheet materials), thus cutting several 
parts at the same time. EDM can also be used to create prototypes, similar to rapid pro-
totyping (e.g., trial stamping of parts). EDM can cut parts weighing up to 10,000 pounds.  
 15.8  Manufacturing of Design 
 We now have a good background about manufacturing. We see how our designs are 
manufactured and produced. It is logical to ask this question: How can we make our 
designs better from a manufacturing point of view? This question addresses a broader 
issue. That is, designers should not only concern themselves with functional require-
ments and force analysis, but they should also think broader and consider their design 
implications on the entire product life cycle from design (product birth), to manufactur-
ing, to assembly, to disassembly, to disposal (product death).  We have covered design 
sustainability already in this book.  Many design foci (concepts) exist to address product 
life cycle concerns. These include DFA (design for assembly), DFM (design for manufac-
turing), DFX (design for anything), concurrent engineering, PDM (product data man-
agement), and PLM (product lifecycle management). 
 We cannot explain each of these design foci in depth  in this book , but we offer a 
quick overview here. Interested readers should consult other  books and  resources for 
more in-depth coverage. All these foci try to change product design during the design 
phase where design changes are simply a change on paper or in CAD software. Changes 
at the design phase are not detrimental or costly as are changes during manufacturing 
on the production floor. 
 The focus of DFA is assembly; change the design to make it easy to assemble. For 
example, reduce the number of parts of an assembly as much as possible to make it 
quicker to assemble. Having fewer parts per assembly also reduces its maintenance and 
repair cost. The focus of DFM is manufacturing. DFM tries to address this question: 
How can we change the design to make it easier and less expensive to make? For exam-
ple, do not use blind holes that have flat bottoms. The “X” in DFX extends the concepts 
of DFA and DFM to any design concern we may have and should address. 
 Each of these design philosophies (DFA, DFM, DFX) has a narrow focus. As a matter 
of fact, these philosophies may and often do produce conflicting results. Thus, we use 
more encompassing approaches. Concurrent engineering approach, for example, sug-
gests that all the teams (design, materials, manufacturing, marketing, sales, and others) 
concerned with a new product should meet and work concurrently during the product 
design phase to resolve any disagreements and conflicts so that the final design is accept-
able to all, including customers (users of the product). 
 PDM and PLM are similar to concurrent engineering, but from a management and 
software point of view. PDM and PLM software are extensions of CAD/CAM software. 
PDM concerns itself with managing product design activities only. PLM goes beyond 
design and looks at disassembly and product end of life. SolidWorks offers  DFMXpress 
for DFM and  PDMWorks for PDM.  
 15.9  SolidWorks DFMXpress 
 SolidWorks implements the concept of DFM in  DFMXpress .  DFMXpress  validates the 
manufacturability of SolidWorks parts. It identifies design areas where manufacturing may 
have a problem or production cost may be excessive. SolidWorks uses three DFM categories: 
rule description, configuration rules, and validating parts. Rule description provides rules for 
turning, drilling, milling, sheet metal, and injection molding as well as standard hole sizes. 

446
Chapter 15: Numerical Control Machining
 Turning rules discuss corner radii and reliefs as follows: 
 ■  When designing stepped shafts, have large enough diameters at the changeover 
edges to allow for using a tool with large nose radius.  
 ■  Provide tool relief for the bottoms of blind bored holes.  
 Drilling rules discuss hole diameters, holes with flat bottoms, hole entry and exit 
surfaces, holes intersecting cavities, partial holes, and linear and angular tolerances. 
Here are the drilling rules: 
 ■  Avoid holes with small diameters (< 3 mm) or large length-to-diameter ratio (> 
2.75) because these holes are difficult to machine. For example, deep holes make 
chip removal difficult, especially if the hole is blind.  
 ■  Avoid flat-bottom holes. Use conical bottoms with angles that conform to standard 
drills. Flat-bottom holes have to be milled and/or reamed, two expensive operations.  
 ■  Entry and exit surfaces of holes should be perpendicular to the hole axis to mini-
mize the shear forces on the drill bit causing it to wander or break on impact when 
it meets the surface.  
 ■  If a hole must intersect a cavity, the drill axis should be outside the cavity to mini-
mize the impact of contact.  
 ■  Holes drilled on edges of features should have 75% of the hole area within the fea-
ture material. 
 ■  Tolerances should not be tighter than necessary.  
 Milling rules discuss deep pockets and slots, inaccessible features, sharp internal 
corners, and fillets on outside edges. Here are the milling rules: 
 ■  Avoid narrow slots because they are difficult to machine. Long, slender end mills 
required to machine them cannot meet the tolerance requirements because the 
tools are prone to chatter. Deep slots also make chip removal difficult.  
 ■  Avoid long corners with long radii.  
 ■  Design milled areas so that the end mill length-to-diameter ratio is …3. 
 ■  Avoid inaccessible features because they require special tools and machining 
techniques.  
 ■  Avoid sharp inside corners. For example, a pocket with sharp corners cannot be 
milled. We have to use EDM to cut it. A three-edge inside corner must have one of 
its corners with a radius equal to the radius of the end mill. If a sharp corner can-
not be avoided, first drill a relief hole at the corner and then mill.  
 ■  Always chamfer outside edges instead of filleting them. An outside fillet is expen-
sive to machine because it requires a form-relieved cutter and a precise setup. 
Also, blending fillets into existing surfaces is expensive, even with a ball-end mill.  
 Sheet metal rules discuss hole diameters, hole-to-edge distances, hole spacing, and 
bend radii. Here are the rules: 
 ■  Avoid designing parts with very small holes. Small drill bits can break easily.  
 ■  Have holes far enough from an edge or bend to avoid distorting the edge.  
 ■  Space holes well apart so the material between them does not become weak and 
get distorted. 
 ■  Do not use excessive bend; otherwise, the material might crack. A rule of thumb is 
to have the bend radius larger than the material thickness.  
 The standard hole sizes rule is simple to follow. Hole sizes should be based on the 
sizes of standard drill bits. 
 Injection molding rules is only one rule specifying the minimum and maximum wall 
thickness  as we discuss in  Chapter   16  .

 15.10  Basics of NC Machining 
 The basics of machining we have covered earlier in this chapter apply here. This section 
extends these concepts with additional ones that apply to NC machining, commonly 
known as  NC programming . NC programming applies to NC machine tools. Each one of 
these machines has an NC controller, as shown in  Figure   15.2  . The controller reads an 
NC program, executes it, and uses it to control the motion of both the machine table and 
the cutting tool. NC machining is more accurate and faster than manual machining. 
 Machinists or designers use CAD models and NC software to write NC programs. 
NC software could be a software module in CAD/CAM software or completely separate 
software. For example, Mastercam and CAMWorks are  Add-Ins to SolidWorks. 
 NC programs are written using G-code and M-code. NC controllers read G-code 
and M-code instructions. While G-code and M-code are ANSI/EIA standard language, 

Chapter 15: Numerical Control Machining

some post-processing may be needed to accommodate proprietary features and different 
commercial interpretations of the code. The benefit of standard programming language 
is easy transfer of NC programs from one machine controller to another. 
 An  NC program  is a list of instructions (commands or statements) that orders an 
NC controller to carry out a sequence of operations on the machine tool to achieve a 
given machining process. After an NC program is written, it is downloaded to the 
machine controller. While we can write NC programs directly on NC controllers, this is 
not a common practice. It would be very cumbersome and difficult to program the 
machining of an intricate part this way. Instead, we use CAD/CAM software to generate 
the NC toolpath, verify it, edit it, and finally generate the NC program that can be down-
loaded to the NC controller via a network or a storage device such as a USB.  Toolpath 
verification is a visual simulation of the cutting tool traversing the toolpath. The NC 
programmer may spot errors and correct them before real manufacturing, thus saving 
money and time. 
 We cover G-code and M-code programming. Before we can write NC programs, we 
offer the following NC programming concepts: 
  
1.  Zero-radius programming:     The definition of a toolpath geometry requires the ( x ,  y , 
 z ) coordinates of its key points. Knowing that the cutting tool follows the toolpath, 
should the coordinates somehow reflect the size (diameter) of the tool? No. When 
we write NC programs, we assume the diameter of the tool to be zero. Such an NC 
programming approach is known as  zero-radius programming , or programming the 
part. We specify the diameter of the tool at the beginning of the program, and the 
NC controller compensates for the diameter while executing the NC program. The 
advantage of this approach is that we can use the same NC program with multiple 
tools of different diameters.  
  
2.  Tool offset:     We can use tool offset to cut more than one part using the same 
program in one setup. Setup cost before machining usually increases part manu-
facturing cost. Consider drilling a hole in a part. Why could we not put multiple 
parts in one or two rows on the machine table all at once and set them up? Then 
we apply an  X -,  Y -, or  X - and  Y -offset to the NC program to move the table to the 
right location (under the drill bit) to drill the hole. This increases machining 
productivity and reduces machining cost by reducing the number of setups, which 
in turn reduces the setup cost.  
  
3.  Driving the tool:     During actual machining, the tool does not move (except small 
movements in the vertical, depth of cut, direction); the workpiece does move 
because it is fixed to the machine table that moves in the X, Y, and Z direc-
tions. However, in NC programming, we visualize the tool motion (tool 
moving around the workpiece), not the machine motion. We move the tool 
and hold the workpiece fixed during writing or generating NC programs. It is 
easier this way. The NC controller reverses the motion during executing the 
NC programs.  
  
4.  Interpolations and canned cycles:     NC controllers provide linear and circular interpo-
lations to machine linear and circular profiles. For example, we define a line by 
two endpoints and a circle by a center and radius. From there, the NC controller 
knows how to cut these profiles in small linear increments (movements of the 
machine table). The controller may also have other canned cycles such as tapping 
holes. A  canned cycle is a prewritten function that the NC programmer can call in 
an NC program. 
  
5.  CL data:     The cutter location (CL) data define the data of the tool centerline as 
described by the G-code and M-code. CL data files are G-code and M-code 
files.

Chapter 15: Numerical Control Machining
 15.11  G-Code and M-Code Programming 
 Writing an NC program requires the context of how we perform a machining operation. 
First, we need to define the toolpath, and then move the tool along this path. Accord-
ingly, an NC program defines the toolpath geometry and instructs the tool to move 
along it. Other machining instructions may be needed such as rapid positioning, turning 
coolant on and off, and others. 
 An  NC program  consists of a sequence of instructions (statements), one per line. In 
the G-code and M-code programming, a statement is known as a  block . Each block (line) 
begins with a block (line) number (N) followed by a code word (e.g., G00). Each code 
word begins with a letter followed by numerical digits as shown. Following the code 
word ( code or  word is also used) is the required data. A block may contain more than one 
word. An NC controller executes one block at a time. Here is an example: 
 N01 G00 X1.0 Y0.0 Z0.0  
 N02 M13 
 N03 G01 X1.0 Y0.0 Z-1.0  
 The first block is Number 1 (N01) and uses the G00 code followed by (1, 0, 0) coordi-
nates of a point, say  P 1 . The G00 code is rapid positioning code. It instructs the NC 
controller to move the cutting tool from its current position rapidly to  P 1 in preparation 
for the next instruction (block). The M13 code in the second block (N02) instructs the 
NC controller to turn on the machine spindle rotation in the clockwise direction and 
also turn on the coolant in preparation for drilling. Finally, the last block (N03) per-
forms the drilling operation by moving the drill bit a –1 unit in the Z direction using the 
G01 code. 
 Prior to executing the above NC program, the machinist turns the machine power 
on and prepares for machining. Then, the machinist clamps the workpiece to the 
machine table, and lines up the machine and workpiece zeros with the zero used in the 
NC program. Finally, the machinist loads the drill bit into the NC machine chuck and 
runs (executes) the program. After drilling, the machinist stops the spindle rotation, 
clears the workpiece from the spindle area, and unclamps and removes the workpiece, 
which is the finished part. The part may be inspected later to ensure that it is within the 
specified tolerances. 
 There is a finite set of codes that is available for G-code and M-code programming. 
The codes use all the alphabet letters, from A to Z, as follows. A to E codes define 
angular dimensions. F is the feed code. G is the preparatory (geometry) code. H 
defines tool length offset. L specifies fixed cycle loop count. I, J, and K are used for 
threading. M is the miscellaneous code. N is the sequence (number) code. O is the 
secondary sequence number. P, Q, and R are used for rapid-traverse dimensions. S is 
the spindle speed code. T is the tool code. U, V, and W are the codes for secondary 
axes of motion of the machine table. X, Y, and Z are the codes for the primary axes of 
motion of the machine table. 
 Table   15.1  shows a subset of the available G-codes. Interested readers should 
consult other resources for more codes. Some G-codes not listed here mean different 
things to different NC controllers. This is why we always need to post-process an NC 
program generated on a CAD/CAM to a particular NC controller to ensure its correct 
execution.  
 Table   15.2 shows a subset of the available M-codes. Interested readers should con-
sult other resources for more codes. Some M-codes not listed here mean different things 
to different NC controllers.

 Injection Molding  
 16.1  Introduction 
 Machining can only produce products that have surfaces that are accessible by machine 
tools. These are surfaces that do not have complex shapes and/or do not include geom-
etry that is hard to reach on machine tools. Injection molding is a manufacturing process 
that is capable of producing any shape made of materials such as plastics or polymers. 
Many plastic parts such as bottles, toothbrushes, bottle caps, car parts, and wires are 
injection molded. Injection molding is widely used in various industries including med-
ical, consumer, automotive, health care, and toys. Injection molding is ideal for mass 
production due to the fast production cycles, and as a result the cost per item is very 
inexpensive. 
 Injection molding  is a cyclic process whereby molten plastic is formed into a 
desired shape by forcing the plastic into a cavity under pressure. Sizes of molded parts 
vary from the smallest size components used in medical devices, to entire body panels 
of cars. Injection molding produces excellent dimensional tolerances. It also requires 
minimal or no finishing or assembly operations, making it ideal for fast delivery of fin-
ished products from the time an order is received. 
 Thermoplastic materials are the most commonly used for molded parts. These 
materials (also known as  resins ) include polystyrene, polyamide, polypropylene, poly-
ethylene, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS). Mate-
rial selection depends on the end application and the desired strength/ductility of the 
resin. Another group of materials includes ceramics, metals, and hard metals. They are 
used in powder injection molding to produce large volumes of small, complex parts. 
Powder injection molding combines two manufacturing processes: injection molding 
and sintering. 
 The injection molding process requires three elements: an injection molding 
machine, plastic material, and a mold. The plastic is melted in the machine and injected 
into the mold where it cools and solidifies into the final part. The process is character-
ized by very large forces and very short processing time. Injection pressure that presses 
the molten material into the mold is very high, ranging from 3000 to 40,000 psi, with a 
typical value of 15,000 psi. The clamping force that holds the mold together and the 
ejection force that ejects the part from the mold are usually very high. The processing 
(cycle) time to produce one molded part is very short, typically in the seconds. 
 Injection molding has advantages and disadvantages. Its advantages are (1) reduced 
material handling, as the hopper holds the plastic pellets; (2) creating parts with metal 
inserts easily; (3) producing parts with tight tolerances; and (4) lower cost per part, 
resulting from highly automating the injection molding process. The disadvantages of 
injection molding are (1) warpage of the parts could result if the mold design and the

molding process are not optimized; (2) weak parts at connection lines (known as knit 
lines) where they are likely to break; and (3) parts could become scrap if the mold is not 
designed properly. Mold design is usually an intricate and expensive task.  
 16.2  Basics of Injection Molding Machines 
 Injection molding requires injection molding (IM) machines, just as machining requires 
machine tools. With an appropriately designed mold that can be accommodated in the 
IM machine, it can make a variety of parts similar to a machine tool. We need to under-
stand both how IM machines work and what the basics of IM are. This section covers 
the basics of IM machines. Subsequent sections cover the basics of IM.  Figure   16.1  
shows a sample IM machine. IM machines come in either a horizontal or vertical con-
figuration. Horizontal configurations are common ( Figure   16.1  ). 
 Figure   16.2  shows an abstraction (schematic) of the IM machine shown in  Figure 
 16.1  . The abstract machine helps us understand the machine operations. An IM 
machine has a solid frame that is usually long and skinny, as shown in  Figure   16.1  . The 
machine has a controller to operate it. The machine does not have too many externally 
visible moving parts.  
 An IM machine has three main sections as shown in  Figure   16.2  : injection unit, 
mold assembly, and clamping unit. The injection unit receives the plastic pellets from 
the hopper, heats up the plastic (plastic becomes plasticized, i.e., changes from a solid 
to a semi-viscous state), and delivers it to the mold assembly. The mold assembly section 
contains the mold that makes the part, which has two halves: the cavity and the core. 
The clamping unit holds the mold tightly closed during the injection of the plastic into 
the mold.

 16.3  Basics of Injection Molding 
 The IM process to make one part is called a  cycle . The cycle has four stages in this 
order: clamping, injection, cooling, and ejecting. The cycle begins by the clamping 
unit securing the mold halves in place before plastic injection begins. The injection 
stage begins with the barrel receiving plastic pellets from the hopper (see  Figure   16.2  ).

Chapter 16: Injection Molding
The screw inside the barrel rotates and slides axially via the motor and pushes the pel-
lets forward inside the barrel. When they reach the heaters area, they melt and become 
molten plastic. 
 The screw continues pushing the plastic into the nozzle. The nozzle feeds into the 
mold cavity and fills it with plastic that takes the shape of the mold cavity. The clamping 
unit holds the mold halves tightly and presses the core into the cavity firmly to prevent 
any leak of the molten plastic. As soon as the plastic touches the mold, it cools down 
immediately. Once the cooling down is complete after a preset cooling period, the screw 
retracts, the clamping unit unclamps, and the ejectors eject the final part, releasing it 
from the core. The part is dropped to the bottom of the IM machine into a bucket or 
container.  Figure  16.3  shows the IM cycle.

 Each cycle produces one or more parts and is repeated at a high rate. The screw is 
reciprocating: It pushes the plastic at the beginning of the cycle and retracts at the end 
of the cycle to allow more plastic to flow into the barrel for the next cycle. The cooling 
is typically done with water. The IM machine is connected to water pipes that circulate 
the water. 
 The mold halves are fixed to large plates called  platens . The fixed (front) half of the 
mold has the cavity (also called the  mold cavity  or  A half ) and is mounted to the station-
ary (fixed) platen. The movable (rear) half of the mold has the core (also called the  mold 
core or  B half ) and is mounted to the movable platen. The plunger ( Figure   16.2 ) of the 
clamping unit holds the mold securely closed while the material is injected. As soon as 
the material hits the mold, it cools down. After the required cooling time, the mold is 
opened and the ejection system pushes the solidified (final) part out of the mold. The 
ejection system is usually attached to the movable (rear) half of the mold. 
 The plastic parts come out of the IM machine ready for use. However, some minor 
cleaning (post-processing) may be needed to break off extra plastic pieces. For example, 
if the mold is used to make multiple parts, these parts become connected by runners 
(branches) of plastic that must be broken off the parts (via using a cutter). These runners 
represent the “chips.” They can be recycled by melting and converting them into pellets 
for reuse. The recycling includes placing the chips in plastic grinders and grinding them 
into pellets (known as the  regrind ). Due to the change in material properties after injec-
tion, the regrind is always mixed with raw material in the proper ratio. The new mix is 
then used to make new molded parts (when permissible). 
 Defects are an expected part of manufacturing processes, and IM is no exception. 
Molding defects are caused by the mold itself (due to poor design) or the molding 
 FIGURE 16.3

487
 process. For example, defects may be caused by a nonuniform cooling rate due to mold 
nonuniform wall thickness or temperature. Possible defects are: 
  
1.  Sink marks:    These marks are caused by low injection pressure and/or mold nonuni-
form wall thickness, causing some sections of the mold to solidify quicker than 
others, leading to uneven shrinkage and leaving temporary voids in the mold.  
  
2.  Bubbles:    These are an indication that the injection temperature is too high or there 
is too much moisture in the plastic. These bubbles are visible on the part’s outer 
surfaces.  
  
3.  Short shot (partial filling):    Some sections of the cavity may be unfilled because the 
shot size is insufficient or the plastic flow in the mold is slow, causing it to solidify 
before reaching the far ends of the mold, away from the gates.  
  
4.  Ejector marks:    These are small indentations made in the part where the ejection 
system pushed the part out of the mold. They are an indication of too short a 
cooling time or excessive ejection force.  
  
5.  Warpage:    Some sections of the mold may cool faster than others, resulting in 
warping of the part. Warpage is an indication that the cooling rate is nonuniform 
inside the mold. 
  
6.  Flashing:    The molten plastic may seep out of the mold cavity between the mold 
halves and solidify along the parting line as a thin layer of plastic. This layer is 
visible after ejecting the part. It is an indication that the clamping force is too low 
or the injection pressure is too high.  
  
7.  Burn marks:    These are black or brown burned areas on the part’s surface. They are 
an indication of improper venting of the tool (mold) or that the injection tempera-
ture is too high. 
  
8.  Flow marks:    These are directional “off tone” wavy lines or patterns. They are an 
indication of low injection pressure.  
  
9.  Voids:    These are hollow spots (air pockets) inside the part, indicating a lack of 
holding the injection pressure at the proper level during the entire injection (shot) 
time. 
  10.  Weld lines:    These are discolored lines where two flow fronts meet. They indicate 
low temperatures of the mold and the melt when the two fronts meet, so they do 
not bond well into each other.  
 16.4  Basics of Mold Design 
 Mold designers design molds, and tool (mold) makers make them. Mold designers use 
mold design software to create molds and toolmakers use precision-machining tech-
niques to produce the molds. Mold machining combines several machining techniques 
including turning, milling, grinding, EDM, and polishing. We focus only on mold design 
here. The following concepts enable us to understand mold design and effectively use 
mold design software. 
  
1.  Types of molds:   There exist many types of injection molds. We can classify them in 
multiple ways as follows: 
 A.  Based on the number of cavities, we have a single- or a multi-cavity mold.  
 B.  Based on construction, we have 2-plate, 3-plate, side-action, or stack molds.  
 C.  Based on ejection, we have pin-eject or stripper-eject molds. Pin ejection 
occurs with pins, as shown in  Figure   16.3  . Stripper ejection uses a stripper that 
pushes the part along its perimeter (think of the rim of a cup).  
 D.  Based on the type of runner (feed) system, we have hot runner mold, cold 
runner mold, or hot to cold runner mold.  

488
Chapter 16: Injection Molding
  
2.  Core and cavity:    These are the two halves of the mold. The cavity represents the 
“imprint” of the outside of the part, and the core represents the “imprint” of the 
inside of the part. The cavity half (mold cavity) is always attached to the fixed 
(stationary) platen of the IM machine, and the core (mold core) is attached to 
the movable platen. We use the concept of cavity and core in mold design to be 
able to extract the molded (final) part easily out of the mold. Because the mold 
needs to be pulled apart to remove the part, the mold design should ensure this 
separation. 
 Industry uses jargon to refer to mold halves. The A (also known as  fixed or 
 cavity ) half is the mold half that does not move ( Figure   16.2  ) and the B (also 
known as  movable or  core ) half is the mold half that moves before and after injec-
tion ( Figure  16.2  ). The B half moves before injection to clamp the mold and 
moves after injection to allow the removal (extraction) of the molded part.  
  
3.  Tool splitting:    Tool splitting is synonymous with core and cavity. Tool splitting is 
the process by which we split the mold into two halves: core and cavity. After the 
split, designer typically adds the gates, runner system, ejection pins, and fasteners.  
  
4.  Mold components and assembly:   A mold consists of its core, cavity, and housing. The 
cavity and the core are the two main components. The mold  housing is its base 
that houses all the mold components. These components are alignment compo-
nents, feed system, cooling system, and ejection system. The housing consists of 
plates to affix the mold components to. The mold assembly consists of two sub-
assemblies. The core and cavity subassembly has the core and cavity only. The 
housing (base) subassembly has all the other components of the mold.  
  
5.  Shot:    A shot is defined as the amount of plastic that is injected to make one part. 
Each IM cycle requires one shot.  
  
6.  Shrinkage:   Plastic expands when it is hot and shrinks when it cools down. After a 
shot is delivered to the mold cavity, it cools down immediately. If its size does not 
account for shrinkage, the molded part will be smaller than desired. Thus, the 
mold design should account for shrinkage. Mold analysis can help estimate the 
amount of shrinkage (shrink factor) and calculates the correct shot size accord-
ingly. The shrink factor is based on the type of plastic and the mold conditions.  
  
7.  Cooling time:    This is the correct amount of time needed to solidify plastic inside a 
mold cavity before opening. Inaccurate calculation of cooling time results in 
defective parts. Mold analysis provides equations to calculate this time. Cooling 
channels are usually built into the mold design to allow water to flow through the 
mold walls near the cavity to cool down the molten plastic.  
  
8.  Ejection:    Ejection is the last activity in the IM cycle. We use an ejection system to 
push the part out of the mold core when we open the mold. When the plastic 
cools down and solidifies at the end of the cooling time, it adheres to the mold 
core, in which case a force must be applied to eject the part. An ejection system is 
part of the mold design.  
  
9.  Tooling:    Tooling (or custom tooling) refers to molds. A mold is typically made out 
of steel or aluminum.  
  10.  Parting line, surface, and axis:    A  parting line is the line of demarcation along the part 
outside. It indicates where the mold halves separate. It separates the core from the 
cavity. The parting line can take different shapes ranging from a simple line to a 
piecewise line, to a curve. The parting line is a closed entity regardless of its shape. 
 A  parting surface is the surface where the two mold halves contact each 
other. Parting surfaces may be flat, stepwise planar, angled, or curved (free-form). 
Molds with flat parting surfaces are less expensive to make than others. 
 A  parting axis (direction) is the axis along which the two halves of a mold will 
separate to allow the part to be ejected.  

Chapter 16: Injection Molding
489
  11.  Mold base:    These are the plates that the mold cavity and core are fixed to. The 
cavity and the sprue are attached to the stationary (front) plate. The core and the 
ejection system are attached to the movable (rear) plates, as shown in  Figure  16.2  . 
The ejection system has ejector pins that are actuated to push the part off the core 
when the mold opens up.  
  12.  Gate and runner system:   This is the system that distributes the molten plastic from 
the nozzle shown in  Figure   16.2  to the mold. The gate represents the entry point 
of injection of the plastic into the mold. The runners are the channels that carry 
the plastic from the sprue to the gates of the mold cavity. An important issue is to 
make sure that enough molten plastic can be pushed through the gates of the mold 
to avoid defective parts. Also, if the plastic flow is not fast enough, the leading 
edge (front) of the plastic could solidify, preventing the plastic from reaching the 
entire mold cavity and causing defects as well. The design of the gates (how many, 
best locations, and the sizes of the orifices) and the runners (how many and how 
long) is important to successful injection molding. 
 Figure  16.4 shows a schematic of a gate and runner system. The main channel 
that feeds plastic to the runners from the barrel is known as the  sprue . If we use 
only one gate, there is no need for a runner system. The sprue feeds directly to 
that gate, as shown in  Figure   16.4A  .  Figure   16.4B  shows a runner system where

 (A) One-cavity mold  
the mold has three cavities to make three parts in one injection cycle. In such a 
case, the sprue feeds to the runners and the runners feed to the gates. The sprue 
and the runners are always in perpendicular planes; the sprue is always vertical (in 
the middle of the mold A half) and the runners are always horizontal. In this 
configuration, the runners feed to the cavities from the side (horizontal). Think of 
 Figure  16.4B as a right view of  Figure   16.4A  . The molten plastic inside the sprue 
and the runners solidifies and must be ejected along with the part.  
  13.  Tooling cost:    The tooling cost is the total cost of the two mold halves and the mold 
base. The part size determines the mold size, and the mold size, in turn, deter-
mines the size of the base. The larger the mold base, the more expensive it is. As 

490
Chapter 16: Injection Molding
for the mold itself, its cost depends primarily on the size and shape of its cavity or 
if multiple cavities are needed. The cavity machining depends on the complexity 
of the part’s geometry. Additional machining cost could accrue from machining 
parting surfaces, high tolerances, and high surface finish.  
  14.  Draft:    Draft is a slight taper on selected model faces (walls) that facilitates removal 
(ejection) of the part from the mold without distorting or damaging it. The draft 
angle is specified such that the opening of the mold cavity is wider than its base. 
The draft taper is specified by an angle value, typically 1 to 5 degrees.  
  15.  Undercut:    An  undercut is an optional feature of a molded part to help keep the part 
secured to the core side, that is, the moving half (where the ejection system is).  
  16.  Insert:    Sometimes designing a one-piece core or one-piece cavity is not feasible if 
the mold is too large. Thus, we split the core and cavity into pieces, each called an 
insert. Inserts simplify the mold cost, maintenance, and replacement.  
  17.  Venting:   Venting provides a path for the air to escape from the cavity as the melt 
displaces it. Inadequate venting of the cavity can seriously reduce the melt flow to 
it. Venting affects the quality of injection molded parts. A vent should always be 
located opposite to a gate, as this will be the point of final fill. Venting prevents 
“burn mark” defects. 
 16.5  Basics of Part Design 
 Successful production of injection molded parts has two requirements: good mold 
design and good part design. Without both of them, molded parts may be defective. 
 Section   16.4  covers the basics of mold design. The following guidelines serve as the 
basics for good part design: 
  
1.  Part wall thickness:    Keep it uniform and to a minimum to reduce the part volume 
and shorten the injection time.  
  
2.  Part edges and corners:   Avoid sharp edges and corners. Fillet the edges and round 
the corners. 
  
3.  Drafts:    Apply drafts to the part walls that are parallel to the parting axis (direction) 
to facilitate the part’s removal from the mold.  
  
4.  Ribs:   Add ribs to strengthen the part where needed instead of increasing the part 
wall thickness. Do not violate the first rule listed above. Also, always add ribs so 
that they are perpendicular to the axis about which bending may occur.  
  
5.  Bosses:    Bosses should be supported by ribs that connect to the nearest part wall.  
  
6.  Undercuts:    Minimize the number of undercuts as much as possible. For example, 
relocating the parting line and/or redesigning a part feature may eliminate some 
undercuts. 
  
7.  Threads:    Orient part features with external threads to be perpendicular to the 
parting axis. 
 16.6  Phases of Mold Design 
 According to industry practice, the three major phases of a mold design are in this 
sequence: 
  
1.  Part design:    This is the part design that we are accustomed to and is covered  in this 
book . 
  
2.  Prepare part for mold design:    The designs of parts that are to be produced by 
injection molding must go through thorough evaluation by mold designers before 

Chapter 16: Injection Molding
491
they are approved for mold design. This is because mold designers must ensure 
that the corresponding molds are possible to make and that they would work 
correctly. The evaluation process includes draft analysis, undercut analysis, and 
parting line analysis. The draft analysis ensures that the final part can be ejected 
from the mold. The undercut analysis is needed to ensure that the part can be 
safely ejected. The parting line analysis allows the designer to investigate multiple 
pull directions and select the best one. 
 Another important mold preparation activity is the flow and temperature 
analyses of the plastic inside the mold core and cavity. Commercial software 
tools such as Moldflow exist to aid designers in performing the calculations. 
Flow and temperature analyses inside a mold are a highly nonlinear complex 
problem that is solved using nonlinear FEM/FEA. The designer must have strong 
theoretical background to be able to model the flow problem and understand 
and interpret the analysis results generated by the software. Designers may 
display these results as contours or gradients to analyze them both visually and 
numerically.  
  
3.  Mold design:    After the part design is tested, modified, and approved, a mold 
designer begins the mold design process. Designers follow the design concepts 
covered in  Section   16.4  and use mold design software such as SolidWorks  Mold 
Tools . They begin by scaling the model up using the plastic shrink factor to 
accommodate for the cooling effect of the plastic. Following that, the designer 
creates the parting line, shut-off surfaces, and parting surfaces. Once finished, the 
designer splits the tool (mold) to generate the two halves (core and cavity). The 
details of these activities and their explanation are covered in  Sections   16.7 and 
 16.8 as applied to SolidWorks. 
 Although the core and cavity are important components of a mold, other 
components are just as important or more important. These are the mold plates, 
alignment and clamping components, runner system, gates, ejection system, 
cooling system, and electrical systems.  
 16.7  SolidWorks Mold Design 
 SolidWorks implements the concepts of mold design in its mold design module. In 
addition, it uses the following concepts: 
  
1.  Tooling split:    This technique is used to split a block that encloses the CAD model to 
create the core and cavity. Tooling split uses the parting line, parting surfaces, and 
shut-off surfaces to split the block.  
  
2.  Shut-off surfaces:    These surfaces are needed to close any open surfaces with holes in 
them in order to be able to separate the core and cavity. Surfaces that do not have 
holes do not require shut-off surfaces. For example, a block with a center hole 
requires a shut-off surface.  
 SolidWorks helps designers design and validate molds. SolidWorks supports the 
three phases of mold design covered in  Section   16.6  . However, SolidWorks does not 
provide any mold analysis tools such as Moldflow. Interested readers need to use STEP 
to exchange models between SolidWorks and Moldflow or other mold analysis software. 
SolidWorks offers integrated mold design tools that control the mold creation. 
 Figure   16.5 shows the toolbar, which has four groups: surfaces, preparation, analy-
sis, and tooling. The surfaces group provides different surfaces to help create parting 
surfaces and shut-off surfaces.  We have covered all these surfaces in the book.  The 
preparation group includes all the work needed before using the tooling split. The icons 

492
Chapter 16: Injection Molding
of this group are split line, scale, parting lines, shut-off surfaces, and parting surfaces. 
The analysis group includes the draft, undercut, and parting line analyses. The tooling 
group includes the tooling split and core.  
 The mold design process in SolidWorks begins with the CAD model and ends with 
the mold. This mold design process uses the following concepts: 
  
1.  Enclose and center the CAD model inside a block (tooling block).  
  
2.  Remove (subtract or carve cut) the CAD model from inside the block.  
  
3.  Split the block open into two halves (core and cavity). We split the block at the 
parting surface perpendicular to the parting axis. The parting surface is defined by 
the parting lines and the shut-off surfaces.  
 The steps of this mold process are as follows: 
  
1.  Create the CAD model of the part to be molded  
  
2.  Insert mounting bosses if needed  
  
3.  Apply shrink factor (scaling) 
  
4.  Add draft  
  
5.  Create parting line  
  
6.  Create shut-off surfaces, if needed  
  
7.  Create parting surfaces  
  
8.  Apply tooling split 
  
9.  Separate the core and cavity  
  10.  Create the tooling assembly  
 The draft in Step 3 ensures model ejection from the mold. The requirements of such 
a draft are: 
 ■  All faces must draft away from the parting line, which divides the core from the 
cavity.  
 ■  Design specifications must include a minimum draft angle to test against.  
 ■  Cavity side surfaces must display a positive draft.  
 ■  Core side surfaces must display a negative draft.  
 ■  All surfaces must display a draft angle greater than the minimum specified by the 
design specifications.  
 ■  No straddle faces must exist.  
 Steps 1 through 9 create a multibody part file, which maintains the mold design in one 
location. Changes to the CAD model are automatically reflected in the tooling bodies. 
Now, we need to create an assembly where we can add other supporting mold compo-
nents such as gates, runner system, and ejecting pins. Step 10 creates a mold assembly file.  
 16.8  Tutorials 
 The theme for the tutorials in this chapter is to practice using mold design concepts 
implemented by SolidWorks  Mold Tools . The tutorials show how to design and docu-
ment molds.

Tutorial 16–1:  Create a Block Mold 
 We create the injection mold for the plastic block shown in  Figure   16.6  . All dimensions 
are in inches. 
 There are multiple issues to consider when designing a mold. We consider the fol-
lowing issues for this tutorial: 
 ■  Orientation of mold halves: horizontal or vertical.    We use the vertical orientation here, 
meaning the mold halves move up and down, not left to right, in the CAD model, 
as shown in  Figure   16.6  . In practice, we use a horizontal injection mold machine 
to produce the part.  
 ■  Location of parting line: top or bottom face of the block.  
  We use the bottom face here. The difference comes 
in placing the mold cavity and core in the CAD 
model. It is customary to place the cavity above the 
core in the CAD model, as shown in  Figure   16.6  .   
 ■  The pulling direction (parting axis) is the direction 
along which we pull the core away from the cavity. 
This direction determines the direction of the draft 
of the part faces.  
 ■  We could create core and cavity parts from scratch, 
using the part and assembly modeling concepts. As a 
matter of fact, as parts become complex, mold designers 
in practice design molds using these concepts instead 
of using mold software. To create mold halves, simply 
create two blocks and subtract the part from each using 
an extrude cut operation. The difference between the 
halves comes in what we add to them later. The half 
where we add the gate becomes the cavity and the half 
where we add the ejection system becomes the core.  
 We create the mold in seven steps: 
  1.  Create the block CAD model  
  2.  Apply shrink factor 
  3.  Create parting line  
  4.  Create shut-off surface  
  5.  Create parting surface  
  6.  Apply tooling split to create the mold core and cavity  
  7.  Create the tooling assembly

Tutorial 16–2:  Create a Sandbox Mold 
 We create the injection mold for the plastic sandbox 
shown in  Figure   16.7  . All dimensions are in inches. The 
difference between this tutorial and Tutorial 16–1 is that 
the sandbox is a shell with a wall thickness. Following 
Tutorial 16–1, we use the vertical orientation for the mold 
and we place the parting line at the top face of the shell. If 
we create the mold for the part in its present orientation, 
the core is placed above the cavity, which is against the 
customary convention. Thus, we flip the sandbox upside 
down to force the cavity above the core. We create the 
mold in seven steps:  
  1.  Create the sandbox CAD model and flip it  
  2.  Apply shrink factor and flip the part  
  3.  Create parting line  
  4.  Create shut-off surface  
  5.  Create parting surface  
  6.  Apply tooling split to create the mold core and cavity  
  7.  Create the tooling assembly  
 HANDS-ON FOR  TUTORIAL   16–1.    Add a vertical 1.0 in. diameter through hole in the block. The hole 
is centered in the top face of the block. Create the new mold. 
 Hint:  You need a peg in the mold to create the hole in the block. The core must have the peg, not the 
cavity; otherwise, you cannot eject the part. The shut-off surface you create determines where the peg goes, 
to the core or the cavity. Experiment until you understand it.

 SolidWorks Certification 
 SolidWorks offers certification exams to become a SolidWorks certified designer. Cer-
tification exams are common in the professional world and they exist in various pro-
fessions and trades. In the software field, for example, you may become a Microsoft 
certified Windows programmer or a certified Oracle database programmer. In the CAD/
CAM field, you may become a SolidWorks, Pro/E, or AutoCAD certified designer. 
 The first certification exam of SolidWorks focuses on the CAD/CAM fundamentals 
we have covered in this book. A typical SolidWorks certification exam consists of two or 
more sections. One section asks about the fundamentals. Other sections are related to 
modeling skills. These sections require knowing and mastering SolidWorks software, 
reading a drawing, and visualizing a model. The better SolidWorks user you are, the 
faster you can finish these sections and finish them correctly. Exams usually test basic 
modeling skills as well as advanced skills. 
 The value of a SolidWorks certificate is to increase your competitiveness in the job 
market and help your career plans. Some companies only hire certified SolidWorks 
designers. Different certification levels exist. There is a license for each SolidWorks soft-
ware module that we have covered in this book. Visit  www.solidworks.com/sw/
mcad-certification-programs.htm  for more details. All license exams are online, and you 
can take them in test centers around the world. The website covers the details of the 
online testing process. You must earn a minimum score to pass any exam and become 
certified in the test-related subject. The available SolidWorks exams are listed below. 
 1.  Certified SolidWorks Associate (CSWA) 
 This is the most basic certificate you can earn. The exam is 3 hours long and the mini-
mum passing grade is 70%. It covers the basic modeling concepts. The exam has a writ-
ten part and a modeling part. The following table shows a mapping of the exam topics 
to the book chapters to prepare and study for the certification exam:
