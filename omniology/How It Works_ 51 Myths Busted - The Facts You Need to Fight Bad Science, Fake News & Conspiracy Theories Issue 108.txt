One of the most active 
comment threads on our 
website is beneath a page 
about the curvature of the 
Earth. To our surprise, this 
innocuous article has 
managed to spark an aggressive debate among 
online readers, because – inexplicably – some 
people believe the Earth is ﬂat. 
While this illogical belief is (hopefully) rare and 
very straightforward to debunk, there are plenty 
of other myths and misconceptions in science and 
history that have become ‘general knowledge’. 
Everybody knows that the Sun is yellow, Napoleon 
was short and a coin toss has a 50/50 chance of 
landing heads or tails. Right? Think again…
This month, we aim to separate fact from fallacy 
in our myth busting special, and we hope you 
learn something new. Enjoy the issue!

GL BAL EYE
Showcasing the incredible world we live in
Scientists in northern Chile are 
frantically searching for solutions to 
preserve rare 7,000-year-old mummies 
that have suddenly started turning into black 
goo. More than 100 mummies have succumbed to 
what is thought to be a bacterial infection from 
modern-day contamination, causing the 
opportunistic microbes to begin feasting on the 
ancient remains. It is hypothesised that 
increased humidity and higher temperatures 
have aided the rapid bacterial proliferation, 
which is speeding up the degradation process. 
The mummies were made by the Chinchorro 
people of prehistoric South America, who are 
thought to have ﬁrst started preserving their 
babies and children who died from 
environmental arsenic poisoning. These 
hunter-gatherers started preserving their dead in 
this way approximately 2,000 years before the 
ancient Egyptians began following a similar 
process to preserve the bodies of their pharaohs. 
The Chinchorro specimens are largely intact, 
and range from infants to older adults. Scientists 
working to preserve the mummies are applying 
to have the samples recognised by UNESCO as a 
World Heritage Site in the hopes a larger 
international community will be able to help.

WWW.HOWITWORKSDAILY.COM
 
How Chinchorro mummies were made
The Chinchorro primarily used two methods to 
preserve their dead: black mummification from 
5,000–3,000 BCE and red mummification from 
2,500–2,000 BCE. The black mummy 
technique involved separating the head, arms 
and legs of the deceased person and drying the 
body using heat before the flesh was stripped 
from the bone. The brain was then removed by 
cutting the skull in half at about eye level. The 
skull and body were then packed with material 
such as feathers and then tied back together. 
A red mummy, on the other hand, had 
incisions made in the trunk and shoulders of 
the body to remove the internal organs and dry 
the cavity, and the head was completely 
removed from the body. The body was then 
stuffed with materials before being sewn up, 
with the head reattached after the brain had 
been removed. A human-hair wig would then 
be placed on the head, and everything apart 
from this single item would be painted with red 
ochre, a substance common in south Brazil.

Astronauts no longer have to rely on 
inter-orbital post when they wish to 
identify microbes aboard the ISS, 
because the Genes in Space-3 project has found a 
way to do it right there on site. 
Although a concerted efort is made to sterilise 
everything on board prior to launch, humans 
inevitably bring bacteria into space with them. 
Previously, it has not been possible to ind out 
exactly what microbes astronauts inadvertently 
carry there, as there was no way to perform 
experiments on the station. Until now. 
So far, all of the microbes have been found to 
originate from Earth. This might not sound 
exciting, but this new ability to sequence genes 
in space means that it may be possible to 
diagnose astronauts who fall sick during their 
time on the ISS, or study the efects of micro-
gravity on bacteria, or perhaps even identify 
organisms from extraterrestrial soil samples.
The successful completion of this sample-to-
sequence process is revolutionary for the world of 
microbiology and space exploration.  In 2017, 
The genes of bacteria carried to the International Space Station from Earth have been identified in space
MICROBES SEQUENCED ABOARD 
THE ISS FOR THE FIRST TIME
Peggy Whitson performed the Genes 
in Space-3 investigation on the ISS 
using miniPCR and MinION devices, 
which were developed for previously-
flown investigations
NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson was the irst-ever 
person to conduct this experiment. Whitson 
collected various samples by touching petri 
dishes to surfaces throughout the spacecraft and 
then had to wait for bacteria to grow. After 
transferring the bacteria into a test tube, they 
were collected and isolated. A technique called 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was then used 
to amplify (make many more copies) of the 
amount of DNA in the sample before undergoing 
sequencing and identiication. These results 
were conirmed to be the same on the ground.  
 
The first Genes 
in Space project
Genes in Space-1 was the first project to 
use PCR in space to amplify DNA using a 
miniPCR thermal cycler. This 2016 
groundbreaking experiment was quickly 
followed by another important study using 
the Biomolecule Sequencer, which used 
the MinION device to sequence DNA. 
After results from the Biomolecule 
Sequencer investigation were published in 
scientific journals, the next appropriate 
step was to marry the two projects 
together to create an even more 
impressive experiment – a full microbial 
identification process while in space. This 
is the Genes in Space-3 project.

This is the first indisputable 
evidence that supermassive 
black holes are contributing 
to the star formation process
Supermassive black holes 
influence star formation
One mystery surrounding the effects of black holes has been solved
A young galaxy bursts with bright new stars, 
but as the galaxy ages star formation slows 
dramatically. Until recently the cause has 
been a complete mystery, but a new study published in 
Nature on 1 January 2018 found that the mass of the 
supermassive black holes exert control over star 
formation. Researchers from the University of 
California Santa Cruz showed that higher-mass central 
black holes quench star formation earlier and more 
eficiently than their smaller counterparts (and visa 
versa). It is a theory that has been hypothesised for 
decades, but until now had remained unproven.
A new self-
healing glass has 
been created
Are shattered phone screens soon 
going to be a relic of the past?
A new self-healing polymer has been created by 
researchers at the University of Tokyo. Originally 
on a quest to ind a new adhesive, the new 
substance can heal itself from cracks when it’s pressed 
together for 30 seconds at room temperature. The glass 
relies on polyether-thioureas, and exploits the ability of 
hydrogen to form bonds in such a way that allows the 
chains to freely move and recombine when compressed. 
New giant octopus 
species discovered
This octopus is so good at camouflage that it had  
scientists convinced it was a different species
Scientists have discovered the 
frilled giant Paciic octopus after 
mistaking it for the giant Paciic 
octopus for years. 
Researchers Nathan Hollenbeck and 
David Scheel from Alaska Paciic University 
have found photographic evidence to 
conirm genetic studies of the two difering 
species. The study was performed in 
Alaska and involved searching for the 
octopus in shrimp pods. 
The new evidence shows that the frilled 
giant Paciic octopus can be distinguished 
from other species by the frill of leshy 
bumps on its skin that run the length of its 
body. Additionally, the newly identiied 
species has two white spots on its head, 
while the original octopus has only one.
The new species is 
closely related to 
the giant Pacific 
octopus (pictured)

COOL THINGS 
WE LEARNED 
THIS MONTH
010  |  How It Works
Polyps protect 
coral reefs
Coral polyps, or hydrozoans, are tiny 
marine creatures related to jellyfish and 
anemones that live on the surface of hard 
corals. However, following a study of 
almost 2,500 coral colonies in Maldivian 
and Saudi Arabian reefs, researchers have 
found that polyps do more than just take 
up space. When more than 50 polyps per 
square centimetre reside on a reef, they 
act as a line of defence against predation 
from fish and gastropods, such as snails. 
Polyps release a venomous organelle 
called a nematocyst, similar in function to 
a jellyfish sting. As the polyps are smaller 
than one millimetre they don’t pack much 
of a punch alone, but in masses they can 
help to fend off intruders.
Indonesia is 
rich with cave 
paintings
Previously unexplored by archaeologists, 
the small island of Kisar has revealed 
a wealth of cave paintings. 28 rock art 
sites have been discovered by the team, 
dating back at least 
2,500 years. They depict 
various scenes, including 
boats, dogs, horses and 
humans possibly holding 
shields. Similarities to 
paintings found on the 
neighbouring island 
of Timor suggest a 
relationship between 
the two civilisations.
Bio-ink could print organs
3D printing technology has come a long way in recent 
years, especially in the medical sector. Bioprinting still 
has many hurdles to overcome, such as getting the ink to stick 
together. However, Japanese researchers may finally have found 
a way to achieve this. The new enzyme-driven approach enables 
biological cells to bind together, which could allow complex 
structures to be printed, such as organs.
Exercise slows 
progression  
of Parkinson’s
Researchers at the University 
of Colorado have linked the 
benefits of exercise to decreasing 
symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. 
The neurological condition is 
caused by the death of certain 
neurons, and a hallmark of the 
disease is the accumulation of 
the protein alpha-synuclein in the 
brain. In a study of mice, those 
that ran on a wheel expressed 
a gene that codes for the DJ-1 
protective protein, which prevents 
the ‘clumping’ of alpha-synuclein 
and therefore slows down the 
physical effects of the condition.

Mars isn’t  
that dry
Where did the water go from Mars? 
Scientists at Oxford University have 
proposed that the majority of its water 
never left the planet and is held in basalt 
rocks, which can hold approximately 25 
per cent more water than those on Earth.
Robots can  
think like insects
The RoboBee is an 80-milligram robot 
inspired by the anatomy of insects, 
and now engineers have developed an 
algorithm to allow it to face the elements. 
To avoid environmental factors such as 
wind, engineers at Cornell University are 
developing a neuromorphic chip to mimic 
the neural functions of insects. These 
clever chips will process information by 
spikes of electrical currents, in the same 
way neurons fire in the brain.
Emissions  
could become fuel
Researchers at MIT have developed a 
system in which carbon dioxide can be 
processed at any quantity to produce 
fuels such as liquid hydrocarbons or 
methanol. The system involves passing 
carbon dioxide through a membrane 
that only allows oxygen atoms to pass 
through, leaving behind carbon monoxide. 
The process is driven by solar-generated 
heat and can be combined with hydrogen 
and/or water to produce other fuels.

Easter Island wasn’t 
home to just warriors
It was previously believed that Easter Island was home 
to a culture of warriors. However, a study by Binghamton 
University in the US has revealed it was a much more 
cooperative community. By studying the ‘hats’ of 
the iconic human statues (known as moai) with 3D 
computer models of the volcanic rock, researchers 
discovered previously unseen carved drawings depicting 
a collaborative community.
There is a winking star
Located about 550 lightyears away, the star RZ Piscium experiences 
erratic dimming episodes, as if to give NASA a wink. The episodes 
have been attributed to clouds of gas and dust from the planetary 
debris orbiting the star, blocking the star’s light as it passes by.
Proteins signal for  
cancers to move
Scientists at the University of Hawaii have discovered the 
way in which some cancers move around the body, known as 
metastasis. Mutant proteins called oncogenes are the driving 
forces of metastasis, and the team have found it to activate 
RSK2 proteins, which act as a signalling hub for cancer cells to 
move. The hope is that this development will lead to drugs and 
treatments that will be able to better fight aggressive cancers.

“THE MOON 
LANDINGS 
WERE FAKED”
Nearly 50 years on from what is possibly 
humanity’s greatest achievement, conspiracy 
theorists have pored over the footage of the 
Moon landings from 1969 and they think it’s a 
set up. They believe NASA built a studio on 
Earth, attached actors to wires and simulated 
low gravity with slow-motion ﬁlming, all to 
trump their Soviet rivals in the space race. 
NASA says they put men on the Moon. So, what 
really happened?
The lighting has been a topic of much debate, 
with conspiracy theorists claiming that one of 
the most iconic images of Buzz Aldrin could 
only be taken with an artiﬁcial light source. So 
computer graphics experts simulated real-time 
lighting properties at the Apollo 11 landing site. 
It turns out that Neil Armstrong’s spacesuit 
reﬂected the Sun’s light and was responsible for 
illuminating Aldrin in the iconic 1969 photo. 
Perhaps the best proof of the Moon landings 
is the trail of evidence left by the astronauts. 
The Apollo 11 mission brought Moon rocks back 
to 135 countries for their scientists to examine, 
and they have conﬁrmed their lunar origin. The 
astronauts also planted reﬂective panels on the 
surface of the Moon; when other countries shot 
lasers at them, they pinged back a signal. If the 
Moon landings were a hoax, researchers from 
across the globe would have had to have been 
in on the conspiracy too. 
 
Moon conspiracies 
debunked
“YOU CAN’T SEE 
THE STARS”
The Moon has no 
atmosphere, so 
shouldn’t the stars be 
visible? Like spacesuits, 
Moon rock reflects 
sunlight. It is too bright 
on the surface to see 
the dim light from 
distant stars. 
“THE ROCKS 
ARE PROPS”
This rock appears to 
have the letter ‘C’ on 
it, but it’s only present 
in enlarged images, 
not in the original 
NASA images, so it’s 
more likely to be a 
stray hair on the film.
“THE FLAG IS 
FLAPPING”
There shouldn’t be 
any wind, but the flag 
waves as it’s planted. 
It’s just the astronauts 
twisting it to get it 
into the ground. It 
stays still later on.
“SHADOWS 
ARE DIFFERENT 
LENGTHS”
Some think the 
inconsistent shadows 
reveal many light 
sources, but they can 
be explained by the 
rocky, hilly terrain. The 
landscape of the Moon 
casts shadows at 
different lengths. 
“IT WAS FILMED 
IN SLOW 
MOTION”
Were the astronauts 
held up with wires and 
filmed in slow motion? 
Look at the dust — it 
drops straight down to 
the ground. On Earth it 
would form clouds 
because of the air in 
the atmosphere.

CONSPIRACY MYTHS
014  |  How It Works
WWW.HOWITWORKSDAILY.COM
“VACCINES 
CAUSE AUTISM”
This dangerous myth all started when a 
fraudulent study led by Dr Andrew Wakeield 
was published in the highly respected medical 
journal The Lancet in 1998. He studied children 
diagnosed with autism after receiving the 
combined vaccination for measles, 
mumps and rubella (MMR). He 
claimed that the vaccine 
caused autism and bowel 
disorders. Parents quickly 
stopped vaccinating their 
children. Another theory 
falsely implicates the use 
of thiomersal, a mercury-
based vaccine preservative, 
with autism. 
In the years that followed, 
more rigorous studies found no 
link between the MMR vaccine and 
autism: Wakeield was wrong. Ecological 
studies looked at the numbers of vaccinated 
children versus the number of children with 
autism. In Canada, autism rates increased while 
MMR vaccination rates went down. Sweden and 
Denmark removed thiomersal from vaccinations 
in 1992, but autism rates continued to rise. 
Retrospective cohort studies looked back 
through medical records to ind links. One 
Danish study analysed over 537,000 children but 
found no link between their vaccination date 
and autism diagnosis. Prospective 
cohort studies followed children 
after vaccination to see if they 
went on to develop autism. In 
Finland doctors found 31 
children with symptoms 
described by Wakeield but 
none became autistic. Then 
there was a meta-analysis 
conducted by Taylor et al 
that gathered results from 
more than 1.25 million children. 
They found no link either. 
Measles, mumps and rubella are 
dangerous infections that can cause 
deafness, meningitis, brain swelling and death. 
In 2010, The Lancet retracted Wakeield’s paper, 
with the UK’s General Medical Council striking 
Wakeield of the medical register for serious 
professional misconduct in the same year.
If you look up outside you might notice the blue 
sky strewn with artificial reflective clouds. These 
telltale streaks of white are called contrails, and 
they are produced by aircraft exhaust emissions. 
Contrails form when the hydrocarbon content of 
jet fuel produces water as a by-product of 
combustion. The water mixes with cold, wet air 
and condenses, and it can freeze to form ice 
crystals. However, some believe that there is a 
more malevolent undercurrent to the goings-on in 
the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. 
Most advocates of the so-called ‘chemtrails’ 
conspiracy recall seeing fewer and less lingering 
contrails when they were younger. However, this 
can be explained by the dramatic increase in air 
traffic we’ve seen over the last few decades, as 
well as cooler exhaust emissions thanks to 
increased fuel efficiency. 
Unsurprisingly, the evidence for chemtrails isn’t 
compelling and remains built on pseudo-scientific 
principles. Conspiracy theorists’ claims range 
from the idea that government agencies are 
attempting to turn clouds into spying devices to 
control our minds, to the notion that they are 
spraying chemicals to deliberately make us sick. 
There is one peer-reviewed paper on the topic, 
and it doesn’t support the outlandish secret 
spraying scandal. The researchers asked 77 
atmospheric scientists to review the data for 
evidence of chemtrails. Only one scientist said 
there was a possibility some of it could be 
evidence, but they also articulated that it wouldn’t 
be the only explanation. 
The chemtrail conspiracy theory first emerged 
shortly after a paper entitled Weather as a Force 
Multiplier was published by the US Air Force in 
1996. The article outlined speculations by military 
researchers about whether the ability to control 
the weather could be useful in combat. Though 
the US Air Force have maintained that this was 
purely hypothetical, it is understandably a chilling 
thought. Even so, there’s nothing up in the air with 
this one: the scientific data confirms that contrails 
are completely harmless.

As giant discs carved among crops, the origins of these 
elaborate designs have been debated for decades. 
Some claim that aliens are using ﬁelds as notepads in 
an attempt to communicate with us. Others believe 
that they are made by human time travellers sent back 
to warn the present-day population. Others think it 
could be a strange natural phenomena. 
Large proportions of circles occur in southern 
England, and in recent years patterns have become 
larger and more detailed. Those who favour a more 
extraterrestrial explanation believe they are created 
by spaceships or invisible energy beams  from space. 
Reports of crop stem nodules morphing and elongating 
have been theorised to be the result of exposure to an 
unexplained source of microwave radiation. But, while 
there is physical evidence of crop circles, their 
presence has a scientiﬁc explanation. 
The prevailing theory, which is supported by 
evidence, is that humans carve the circles. Commonly 
named ‘the circle makers’, groups of artists have been 
observed during their sculpting and even interviewed 
about their work. It appears the trick is to leave no trace 
of entering and exiting the ﬁelds, which they do by 
working under the cover of night. Artists have been 
known to use a length of rope and wooden boards to 
ﬂatten the crops and form creative shapes. Though 
aliens aren’t responsible for the circles, some of these 
impressive designs are out of this world.
“CLIMATE 
CHANGE IS 
A HOAX”
It goes without saying that climate 
change is a very hot topic in today’s 
political climate, and while most of us 
accept that it’s a very real challenge, 
there are some who still refuse to 
believe it. From those that think the 
whole idea was invented by some 
countries to reduce the economical 
value of others, to those that believe 
it’s simply fake news, the conspiracies 
about climate change abound. 
Climate change itself isn’t 
something new for Earth. Our planet 
has experienced many fluctuations of 
global warming and cooling that have 
been recorded through ice core 
studies. However, the rapid changes 
we are witnessing today are believed 
to be driven by human behaviour. Well, 
believed by some. President Trump 
regularly airs his scepticism via 
Twitter: “Record low temperatures and 
massive amounts of snow. Where the 
hell is GLOBAL WARMING?”
Some assume there should be a 
direct relationship between global 
warming and their local weather, so by 
that logic the presence of snow or 
abnormally cold weather in their 
hometown must mean that global 
warming is a lie. But the clue is in the 
name: the temperature occurs on a 
global scale rather than just on a snow-
dusted doorstep. Since the late 19th 
century the global temperature has 
risen by 1.1 degrees Celsius, with the 
rise escalating in the last 35 years to 
make 2016 the warmest year on 
record. However, global temperatures 
are just one of many figures used to 
illustrate climate change. 
Sea levels have risen by about 20 
centimetres since the beginning of the 
20th century, and since the Industrial 
Revolution ocean acidity has increased 
by 30 per cent, causing certain species 
to relocate as a result. Global warming 
and climate change might be an 
inconvenient truth, but they are an 
unequivocal truth nonetheless.
 
“CROP 
CIRCLES ARE 
MADE BY 
ALIENS”
Why do people believe 
conspiracies?
Part of it is down to proportionality bias. It is a tendency of the 
human brain to convince us that big events must have a big cause. 
Rather than accept the simple explanation, it’s somehow easier to 
believe an elaborate conspiracy. 
Another factor is projection bias. We think that other people 
think like us, and if we’re suspicious, or behave suspiciously, we 
believe that others will be hiding the truth too. 
Then there’s confirmation bias. We’re much more likely to 
accept evidence that agrees with our existing beliefs than 
evidence that contradicts us. Once someone gets invested in a 
conspiracy, they’ll become more and more convinced that it’s true.
We are more likely to accept evidence if it 
agrees with beliefs we already have

“THE EARTH IS FLAT”
By around 500 BCE most ancient Greeks believed 
our planet was round. For a long time before this 
it was believed to be lat. It was only when we 
started to map the trajectory of the Sun and the 
stars and applied mathematics to speculation 
that we rejected the disc model and accepted the 
spherical model. You can see the evidence of this 
curve yourself. Just sit on a clear day and watch a 
sailing boat as it cruises over the horizon, and 
you will see it slowly disappear as it dips 
beneath the horizon and eventually out of sight. 
This was just one argument made by Aristotle 
(circa 384–322 BCE), who was possibly the irst 
person to propose a spherical Earth based on 
physical evidence in around 350 BCE. 
So what evidence do modern lat Earth 
societies have to continue to believe claims that 
are lat out unsubstantiated? These conspiracy 
theorists reject the irrefutable evidence of 
gravity and instead favour the position that we 
are on a disc that is being pushed upwards 
through space by a mysterious force called dark 
energy. They believe that our planet is a 
disc-shaped world with the Arctic Circle in the 
middle, with a rotating dome of stars over our 
heads. Among other absurdities are theories 
that the Sun is only several hundred kilometres 
away from us, the Moon is transparent and a 
giant magnet under the ocean controls the tide. 
Perhaps the most outlandish aspect of the lat 
Earth conspiracy theory is the belief that our 
planet is surrounded by a huge, 45-metre-high 
ice wall on the coast of Antarctica that holds our 
ocean in and prevents us from falling of the 
planet. Flat Earth conspiracy theorists not only 
reject the shape of the Earth but also deny the 
irrefutable evidence of almost all of the scientiic 
evidence underpinning our understanding of 
physics, mathematics and our origins.

“IT’S BEST TO 
LET BATTERIES 
RUN OUT BEFORE 
RECHARGING”
This battery myth, which supposedly 
helps to extend a device’s lifespan, is a 
notorious example of an incorrect piece of 
information that seems to endure even 
when it becomes outdated. And, if we’re 
able to admit it, most of us have probably 
shared this ‘helpful’ tip with others, 
unaware that our advice will actually 
harm their product’s battery life rather 
than help it.
Most modern batteries, including all 
those used in our precious Apple iPhones 
and MacBooks, make use of lithium-ion 
batteries. Compare these to traditional 
battery technologies and you’ll ind that 
they are claimed to charge faster, last 
longer and, most importantly for 
addressing this myth, charge best in 
short, ‘topping-up’ bursts. Apple 
measures their battery lifespans in cycles, 
with one cycle being equal to 100 per cent 
discharge, but that doesn’t mean that you 
should completely drain your battery 
before plugging in your device. Instead, 
it’s best to split a charge cycle across 
multiple charges.
In fact, most tech advisors suggest never 
letting your phone battery get too low, nor 
too high. Not that a full-charge will be 
overly damaging, but consistently leaving 
your device plugged in until it has stored 
every last drop of energy can reduce its 
lifespan in the long term. Instead, take 
advantage of your device’s inbuilt 
charging design, which will likely be a 
‘quick-charge’ to 80 per cent and ‘trickle-
charge’ from 80 to 100 per cent. This 
design ensures that you can get power 
back quickly but stops your device from 
overcharging. So discard this common 
myth and stop waiting for your bar to 
empty before illing it up. Instead, keep 
your bar in the green, and charge from 40 
per cent to 80 per cent for the most 
eficient battery life.
“VIDEO GAMES 
MAKE PEOPLE
MORE VIOLENT”
The idea that absorbing violent content through media encourages 
our own violent thoughts and actions isn’t new. In fact, it’s been 
around since violent scenes first appeared on the silver screen in 
the 1970s, with parents and conservative groups fearful of the 
negative impact viewing such things could have. The swift 
transformation of video games in the decades that followed, from 
family friendly titles such as Super Mario to the R rated Grand 
Theft Auto series, did nothing to allay their concerns. 
Suddenly young adults, rather than just watch a person harm 
another in gruesome ways on the screen, could take control of an 
avatar and commit such virtual crimes themselves. In Grand Theft 
Auto — a famous example of such a game — players could even 
shoot or simply run down innocent bystanders. While these games 
were designed purely for entertainment, gamers found their 
appetites for on-screen violence ever increasing so scientists 
decided to step in and investigate their potential impact.
Several scientific findings have been published on the topic, and 
at first glance it seems like bad news for gamers. In a laboratory 
setting, numerous studies asserted the same conclusion: exposure 
to violence could invoke such behaviour in the viewer. However, a 
more recent comprehensive survey released in 2014 used crime 
statistics to debunk this view. The researchers compared rates of 
youth violence against consumption of violent video games and 
discovered the two were inversely related. The study had shown 
that youths were becoming less inclined to commit criminal 
violence with the rise of violent video games.

letting a modern battery’s 
charge fall too low is 
damaging for its longevity

‘‘PLANNED 
OBSOLESCENCE 
MAKES YOUR 
PHONE SLOW 
DOWN” 
Conspiracy theories can be fun to 
discuss, but they become so much 
more fascinating when they 
contain a grain of truth. Such is the 
case with ‘planned obsolescence’, a 
manufacturer’s tactic that had been 
in play for decades before the term 
had even been invented. 
In essence, planned 
obsolescence is a deliberate ploy by 
the manufacturer to limit their 
product’s lifespan so the consumer 
is forced to repeatedly pay to 
replace it. And to the chagrin of 
today’s manufacturers, conspiracy 
theorists often point to the 
infamous ‘Phoebus cartel’ of light 
bulb makers, who in the 1920s 
planned to do exactly that. But as 
technology has developed, 
attention has shifted away from 
light bulbs and onto smartphones, 
with recent theories suggesting 
that tech giants, such as Apple, 
restrict the performance of older 
devices in order to encourage 
consumers to purchase newer, 
more expensive models. 
As this idea has inspired such 
widespread belief, software 
company Futuremark decided to 
put iPhones, old and new, to the 
test. They assessed each model’s 
performance every month for 18 
months and found that their 
performance was maintained. The 
slowed-down performance owners 
had been reporting was more likely 
due to installing software updates 
released with the new models, 
which are designed to work 
optimally with the newest units.
However, in December 2017 Apple 
announced that their iOS software 
does in fact slow the performance of 
older iPhone models in order to 
preserve battery life. Old lithium-
ion batteries don’t hold their charge 
as well as new ones, so the 
programmed slow down is a 
compromise to stop the battery 
draining too quickly and to prevent 
random shut downs, which would 
otherwise be frustrating for users.
So is the slowing performance a 
scheme by manufacturers to boost 
proﬁts? Not exactly. 
Does their approach to software 
updates render old models 
obsolete? Eventually. 
“MACS CANNOT 
GET VIRUSES”
Lots of us long for a Mac of our own, with their sleek design, sophisticated 
hardware and intuitive software catapulting them to the top of many wish lists. 
Add to that the common notion that they’re immune to viruses, and they almost 
sound like the perfect machine. Only, as more users are discovering, Macs are 
susceptible to viruses, spyware and other types of malware just like PCs.
However, this myth hasn’t arisen from nowhere. Macs do encounter much less 
malicious software (often abbreviated to malware) than Microsoft PCs, which 
has led to their inflated reputation. A primary reason for this is simply that there 
are more people using PCs therefore making them the obvious target for 
opportunistic hackers. Today, with a growing number of Mac users around, 
hackers have more incentive to design viruses for Macs. However, by their very 
design, Macs are much better equipped to deal with possible threats, with their 
inbuilt security measures capable of restricting unknown applications from 
installing on the system. But, 
there is no computer that is 
completely secure.

“SHUFFLE ON 
MUSIC PLAYERS 
IS COMPLETELY 
RANDOM”
Shufle playlists are great when we’re in 
an indecisive mood. Not sure what music 
to listen to? No problem. Just click ‘shufle’ 
and the device will randomly choose 
songs from a playlist or library for you to 
listen to. Or will it? At least in the case of 
the music streaming service Spotify, the 
answer is no, it’s not quite as random as 
you might expect.
Instead, they’ve designed an algorithm 
to make your shufle playlist seem more 
random than a truly random playlist 
would be. And as bizarre as that sounds, it 
makes sense when we consider that 
humans are very good at making patterns 
— even when there aren’t any. The 
algorithm attempts to circumvent a 
human invention known as ‘gambler’s 
fallacy’, which explains our tendency to 
think that if a coin has landed on heads 
ive times in a row, then it’s likely to land 
on tails on the next toss. But really, every 
time we lip a coin, the chances of it 
landing on heads or tails is equal (well, 
more or less… see page 22).
When we hear an artist on shufle 
appear twice in quick succession, we 
instinctively wonder how the playlist can 
be random if the same artist has cropped 
up twice so soon. So Spotify have 
introduced the algorithm to separate an 
artist’s songs in order to cater to what we 
perceive to be random.
“MORE MEGAPIXELS 
MEANS BETTER 
PHOTOGRAPHS”
Like many tech-related myths, presenting megapixels as the sole 
determinant of image quality is a result of misleading marketing 
campaigns. And unfortunately for consumers, all the big phone- 
and camera-creating manufacturers have hopped onboard with 
this advertising strategy. But more doesn’t necessarily mean 
better, and in some cases, more megapixels can even make your 
photographs worse!
Digital cameras — unlike their predecessors that captured 
images using light-sensitive film — build images through pixels, 
which each process a small fraction of light caught by the camera’s 
sensors. With more pixels comes more units to capture incoming 
light, increasing the camera’s resolution and providing images with 
more detail. This can be helpful when making large prints or 
zooming in on images, but otherwise you’ll notice little difference 
between a seven- and ten-megapixel camera, for example. 
It’s also important to note that there are many more factors at 
play than just megapixels, with the camera lens, sensor, flash and 
software all being important elements. Plus, with more megapixels 
comes the requirement for more light to accurately capture the 
image, so a higher megapixel camera can produce lower-quality 
images than one with less megapixels when the other components 
are not up to scratch.
Shuffle play prevents 
tracks from repeating, 
making it distinct from 
a random play feature
Camera advertisements often 
revolve around megapixels, 
but they are a measure of 
quantity not quality

“MAGNETS 
CAN ERASE 
YOUR DATA”
You may have seen a piece of movie 
sabotage involving the use of a 
magnet to erase the contents of a 
hard drive, or you may have simply 
been told to keep your devices well 
clear of them, but this danger is 
largely mythical. For forms of lash 
memory that use solid state drives, 
magnetism will have no efect 
whatsoever, so your laptop, 
smartphone and USB stick are 
probably perfectly safe.
For hard disc drives, however, 
the danger is partially real. These 
devices create a binary code using 
polar alignments on the magnetic 
parts, so a strong enough magnet 
could alter the polarity and  ruin 
the data. Myth conirmed? Not 
quite, as the magnet would have to 
be as strong as an MRI machine to 
have any impact. So unless your 
devices are going to be exposed to  
a super-magnet, they’ll be safe.
“QWERTY IS THE MOST 
EFFICIENT KEYBOARD 
LAYOUT AVAILABLE”
Keyboards beginning from the top left with the characters Q-W-E-R-T-Y have 
become ubiquitous with modern computers. And as many of us find this 
keyboard style easy to use, it seems appropriate that the alphabet is arranged 
in this way simply because it’s the most efficient. However, the QWERTY layout is 
actually a relic from the typewriter era.
Originally, typewriters were arranged in alphabetical order, but as commonly 
used letters were placed next to each other this caused the machine to jam if 
these letters were struck in close succession, as the bars that pressed against 
the paper would collide. QWERTY was the answer to this issue, so common keys 
were placed further apart from one another.
However, the ‘Dvorak’ and ‘Colemak’ arrangements are arguably more 
efficient, as commonly used characters are placed where they can easily be 
reached. But given you would have to retrain your brain and fingers, most of us 
will probably continue to stick with QWERTY.

“IT TAKES SEVEN 
YEARS TO DIGEST 
CHEWING GUM”
It can take on average between one to three days for food to go all 
the way through your digestive system, but legend has it that gum 
stays in there for seven years! Luckily for any accidental gum 
swallowers, this simply isn’t true. So what exactly does happen to 
chewing gum when we swallow it? 
The chewy part of chewing gum is made of tough stuff — a 
natural or synthetic rubber base that even the digestive system 
can’t break down, able to withstand the stomach’s acid and the 
intestines’ digestive enzymes. But most other components, 
including sweeteners and flavourings, can be broken down. This 
means the body can deal with it, so the gum will eventually move 
towards the exit in a few days. If you swallow something smaller 
than two centimetres in diameter, chances are it’ll be able to 
squeeze out. And gum has the added benefit of being soft.
There have been rare reports of children with gummed-up 
intestines, but they had swallowed vast quantities of the sticky 
stuff. Even so, chewing gum has no nutritional benefit, and can be a 
choking hazard, so you are still advised to spit it out.

“COIN FLIPS 
ARE 50:50”
If there’s one thing that we know for sure, it’s 
that a series of coin tosses will come out half 
heads and half tails. Wrong. Coin flips aren’t 
completely independent. True, the coin doesn’t 
know what side it landed on last time, so if you 
got five heads in a row, you aren’t overdue a 
tails. But the side that faces upwards when you 
make the flip influences the side it’ll land on.
Researchers from Stanford University and 
University of California, Santa Cruz watched 
coin flips with a high-speed camera. They found 
that if you flip a coin head-side up you have a 51 
per cent chance of catching it head-side up. 
And, for some people, the chance can be as high 
as 60 per cent depending on exactly how they 
flip the coin. What’s more, if you spin the coin, 
the lightest side will face up more often than the 
heaviest. This tends to be tails, but it depends 
on the exact coin you use. The advantage is tiny 
but well worth knowing about if you’re betting 
on a coin toss.
“CRACKING 
KNUCKLES WILL 
CAUSE ARTHRITIS”
Knuckle cracking involves pulling apart the joints by stretching 
or bending them, which decreases the pressure in the fluid 
between them. This causes dissolved gases in the fluid to 
form bubbles, which then burst with a characteristic crack. 
Legend has it that this causes osteoarthritis, where the 
cartilage covering the ends of the bones becomes thin and 
roughens. But this legend isn’t true.
In 1998, Dr Donald L Unger wrote a letter to the editor of 
Arthritis and Rheumatology. He had been cracking the 
knuckles of his left hand at least twice a day for 50 years, with 
his right hand acting as the control. He had compared both 
hands for evidence of arthritis and found none, but he did 
confess that his study wasn’t enough to debunk the myth. 
However, a larger study later appeared in the Journal of the 
American Board of Family Medicine. The team quizzed 215 
people aged 50–89 about their knuckle-cracking habits and 
looked at X-rays of their hands. The result? There was no 
difference between those who cracked and those who didn’t.

“YOU ONLY USE 
TEN PER CENT 
OF YOUR BRAIN”
While the human species is already 
pretty smart, could we be even 
smarter? The old saying goes that 
we only use ten per cent of our 
brains. So just imagine what we 
could do if we kicked the other 90 
per cent into gear. Not much more, 
as it turns out. The ten per cent 
ﬁgure is a myth. 
We don’t know exactly where the 
myth came from, but it may have 
started as a misinterpretation of 
early experiments on brains. The 
ﬁrst cause could be the fact that 
during brain scans, not all parts of 
the brain light up, possibly leading 
early experts to assume that the 
darker areas were inactive. On top 
of this, there is the fact that people 
can survive damage to certain 
parts of the brain following a 
trauma such as a stroke.
We each have around 86 billion 
nerve cells, or neurons, in our 
brains. Each one can have up to 
100,000 dendrites, which are 
branches that help neurons to 
make connections to each other. 
Just by reading this page, you’re 
using almost every part of your 
brain. Your brainstem is taking care 
of your heart rate and breathing. 
Your cerebellum is keeping you 
balanced. Your occipital lobe is 
handling the input from your eyes. 
And your temporal, parietal and 
frontal lobes are working together 
to decode the words. All this brain 
activity, needs energy; up to 20 per 
cent of the body’s total in fact. 
That’s a lot for using just ten per 
cent of the brain. 
If this still isn’t enough, around 
half of your brain isn’t made of 
neurons but glial cells. The word is 
Greek for ‘glue’, and these cells sit 
between the neurons, providing 
support and protection. Then there 
are the astroglia, which help 
maintain chemical balance; 
oligodendrocytes, which insulate 
neurons; and the microglia that 
repair damage, ﬁght infection and 
clean up debris. These cells are 
constantly active, blowing the ten 
per cent ﬁgure out of the water.

There’s no need to fear for your life 
the next time you pass through the 
shadow of a skyscraper — pennies 
dropped from the rooftops aren’t 
going to pierce your skull. Intrepid 
investigators have put this myth to 
the test in ingenious ways, and it’s 
been well and truly busted.
University of Virginia physics 
professor Louis Bloomield was so 
conident that the myth was false 
that he sent a penny-loaded helium 
balloon into the sky. The pennies 
dropped like leaves in the air, 
bufeted by the wind. The faster 
they fell, the more air resistance 
they experienced. Pennies are too 
small and lat to be a danger, only 
reaching speeds of around 40.2 
kilometres per hour. At some point 
the downward force of gravity 
balances the upward force of air 
resistance, and the pennies can’t 
fall any faster. 
According to the MythBusters 
team, a penny dropped from the 
top of the Empire State Building 
might collide with the pavement at 
103.6 kilometres per hour. So they 
made a gun that could ire pennies 
at that speed. Although their test 
dummy may have sufered a little 
damage, when they turned on each 
other they were not harmed. 
According to Professor Bloomield, 
if the coins fell in a vacuum they’d 
be much more dangerous, reaching 
a speed of 335.7 kilometres per hour. 
But even then they wouldn’t 
penetrate the skull. 
However, in an interview with 
Life’s Little Mysteries, he warned 
against ballpoint pens. The shape 
of these is more bullet-like, and if 
they come down straight they could 
get close to 335.7 kilometres per 
hour in the air, so the pointy end 
could do a lot more damage.
“SNEEZING WITH YOUR 
EYES OPEN WOULD MAKE 
YOUR EYES POP OUT”
People shut their eyes when they 
sneeze, but it’s not to prevent them 
from bulging out of their heads. We 
sneeze to clear irritants from our 
airways, and closing our eyes stops 
the same irritants from getting 
straight back in. It happens 
automatically, but if you do keep 
your eyes open it’s highly unlikely 
that anything bad will happen. 
In 1882, The New York Times 
reported a burst eyeball following a 
sneeze, and it’s true that straining 
can rupture blood vessels. A 
powerful sneeze or excessive 
coughing can cause a bleed in the 
eye. These injuries normally heal 
without any need for treatment, 
and they can happen whether your 
eyes are open or closed.
The average sneeze travels 
at a speed of 163.9 
kilometres per hour

“WATER 
DRAINS IN 
THE OPPOSITE 
ROTATION IN 
THE SOUTHERN 
HEMISPHERE”
Earth is always spinning. It rotates 
from west to east, completing a full 
turn every 24 hours, and this causes 
something known as the Coriolis 
efect. Earth is a sphere, and it’s 
wider at the equator than it is at the 
poles. Therefore, for the whole 
planet to spin around in the same 
amount of time, the ground at the 
equator has to spin faster than the 
ground at the poles.
If you were able to stand at the 
equator and throw a ball 
northwards towards your friend in 
the UK, it would appear to curve to 
the right because they are moving 
slower and have not caught up, 
while you conserve momentum. 
But if you were in the North Pole 
and threw a ball towards the UK, 
again it would curve to the right, 
but because the UK is moving faster 
than at the pole, your friends are 
now ahead of the ball. 
Back on terra irma, the efect is 
that liquids, including those in the 
air, delect as they move. You can 
watch it happening in the spin of 
hurricanes, which turn in diferent 
directions in the Northern and 
Southern hemispheres. But this 
efect isn’t strong enough to afect 
water draining from our sinks: the 
Earth just isn’t moving fast enough.
“HAIR AND NAILS 
CONTINUE TO GROW 
AFTER YOU DIE”
Medical students and morticians might notice cadavers with fresh 
stubble, but there isn’t a mysterious life force inside the follicles. It 
may look like new cells are growing at the roots, but appearances 
can be deceiving. After death, the body starts to dry out and, as 
skin loses moisture, it shrinks. What looks like new growth is just 
hair and nails that were once hidden underneath being revealed. 
Many of our cells do stay alive longer than us. Studies looking at 
the genes of animals in the four days after they died showed that 
many cells activated automated stress responses after death. Stem 
cells in particular fight to survive as long as possible.

“THE BERMUDA 
TRIANGLE IS 
DANGEROUS”
Legend has it that the subtropical 
Bermuda Triangle region of the 
western North Atlantic is the site of 
hundreds of tragic and unexplained 
disasters. The stories surrounding the 
fateful disappearance of planes and 
ships in the area between Miami, 
Bermuda and Puerto Rico are often 
centred around the supernatural. 
There are fanciful tales describing 
rifts in space-time sucking in 
unsuspecting sea-faring travellers, or 
the area being haunted by the souls of 
African people enslaved by the British. 
Some theories have even suggested 
that aliens might be responsible for the 
eerie events. However, the truth is 
much less paranormal.
The foundations of this myth are 
rooted in the time of Christopher 
Columbus, who reported witnessing a 
great flame of fire (likely a meteor) 
crashing into the ocean as he sailed 
through the triangle during his first 
voyage to the New World. Later, in the 
20th century, the naval cargo ship USS 
Cyclops went missing in the Bermuda 
Triangle, along with the 300 or so 
people onboard. No remains of the ship 
or crew were found, and no distress 
call had been made despite the ship 
having the equipment to do so. 
One of the most mysterious events 
since then involved the small ship 
Witchcraft. In December 1967, 
Witchcraft hit something apparently 
minor within 1.6 kilometres of the 
shore. Calmly, the experienced captain 
onboard, Dan Burack, said they needed 
to be towed but it wasn’t an 
emergency, and he’d fire a flare to 
indicate his position. Assistance 
arrived within less than 20 minutes, 
but he was nowhere to be found and 
neither was his boat or crew. Burack 
was a cautious yachtsman and had 
attached a floatation device to make 
the boat virtually unsinkable, so even if 
the hull had been ruptured and the 
boat flooded, part of it would remain 
above water. Yet no debris was ever 
found, despite searching over 63,000 
square kilometres.
There are countless other stories, 
some steeped in folklore and more 
embellished than others. But 
statistically there have not been more 
wrecks in this area. That doesn’t mean 
that the Bermuda Triangle is the safest 
of waters though. It’s known that 
storms, reefs and the Gulf Stream can 
cause navigational challenges, but 
these mysterious goings-on are mostly 
due to the sheer amount of traffic 
going through, human error and bad 
weather, plus the heightened publicity 
given to accidents within the area.
Considering accidents 
as a percentage of the 
ships that pass through 
the Bermuda Triangle, 
it is no more dangerous 
than anywhere else
The Bermuda Triangle 
is home to many myths 
surrounding stories 
that have become 
distorted over the years
The truth is clouded
Meteorologists now think that 
unusual hexagonal clouds above 
the triangle create ‘air bombs’ 
full of wind that are able to bring 
down a plane or send a ship to 
the bottom of the Atlantic.
An ocean of danger?
The Bermuda Triangle covers 
roughly 1.3 million square 
kilometres of ocean off the 
southeastern tip of Florida.

There’s no doubt that airbags save lives by 
reducing the impact of a crash, but there is still a 
rumbling of urban myths surrounding these 
road safety devices. You might have heard that 
airbags kill more people than they save, but this 
is incorrect. They generally only cause injury if 
they’re used incorrectly. 
The National Highway Trafic Safety 
Administration estimate that between 1987-2015, 
a total of 44,869 lives were saved. While, 
between 1990-2008, more than 290 fatalities had 
occurred. So, unless you ignore safety 
guidelines, it is much riskier to drive a car that’s 
not itted with airbags than one that is.
“PLANES DUMP 
TOILET WASTE 
IN FLIGHT”
Visiting an aircraft toilet is generally an unpleasant 
affair. It’s difficult enough to squeeze into the 
cramped room and navigate onto the seat, without 
the additional concern of what may be about to be 
unceremoniously dumped into the sea. There have 
always been rumours concerning the fate of waste at 
altitude – that it is to be jettisoned from the aircraft, 
but it turns out that this is actually impossible to do. 
This is because airline toilets use either closed 
waste systems (which operate in a similar way to a 
house toilet) or a more modern vacuum waste 
system. Both store the sewage in holding tanks and 
require access to a valve on the outside of the plane 
to be emptied. 
However, there are cases where waste has seeped 
out of an aircraft accidentally because of a leak in 
the tank. The waste becomes immediately frozen, 
along with the blue waste treatment liquid. This 
grisly frozen mixture is known as blue ice. Though 
generally blue ice will collect on the outside of the 
aircraft and remain there until the plane has landed, 
there are occasions where it can come loose. 
Thankfully, most will melt and evaporate before 
hitting the ground, or an unlucky passerby, but 
occasionally the pungent snowball will remain intact. 
There have been verified reports of people and 
property being hit with blue ice, but it has never 
been intentional.

“MOBILE PHONES 
CAN BRING A 
PLANE DOWN”
Have you ever noticed that sometimes, 
usually just before your phone rings, your 
speakers start emitting a static sound? 
That’s cellular interference, and it’s quite 
annoying. It’s even more annoying if it’s 
being blasted through your headset when 
you’re a member of the light crew trying 
to organise irritated passengers while 
simultaneously preparing to launch an 
80-ton plane 12,000 metres into the air. 
Not being allowed to use your phone 
onboard actually has nothing to do with 
potentially causing a crash: it’s more due 
to the risk of this cellular interference 
sound distracting light crew. There is 
almost no risk of causing a plane crash 
because you were using your phone, but 
aviation authorities understandably 
choose to err on the side of caution. 
Modern aircraft have electronics that 
are designed to shield them from 
interference from cellular 
communication. It’s estimated that at 
least half of all phones are not switched 
onto light mode, and there remains no 
known light that was adversely afected 
by this kind of interference. So while you 
could send those last few Snapchat selies 
as your light takes of, for the sake of the 
crew, it’s probably best not to risk it.

“THE TITANIC 
WAS KNOWN AS 
‘UNSINKABLE’”
Submerged nearly four kilometres 
beneath the surface of the icy North 
Atlantic Ocean lies the red-rusted 
remains of the magniicent ocean 
liner the RMS Titanic. This iconic 
passenger vessel is remembered as 
the unsinkable ship, but did 
anyone at the time really believe 
this to be true? Evidence suggests 
that while passengers and crew did 
feel they were aboard an 
exceptionally safe vessel, there had 
been no advertising of the liner as 
being ‘unsinkable’.
This phrasing only came from 
the White Star Line after the Titanic 
had sunk. When reports of the 
sinking ship reached America on 
the morning of the 15 April 1912, 
Philip Franklin (the vice president 
of the company) announced, 
“There is no danger that Titanic 
will sink. The boat is unsinkable 
and nothing but inconvenience 
will be sufered by the passengers.” 
Previous to the sinking of the 
Titanic, the only known record of 
someone saying the ship was 
unsinkable came from a 
crewmember to calm the nerves of 
the passenger Mrs Sylvia Caldwell. 
It’s reported he said to her, “God 
himself could not sink this ship!” 
The belief that the Titanic was ever 
seen as the unsinkable ship is a 
result of latter-day myth making 
and sensationalism.
The ill-fated Titanic had been 
undisturbed until it was 
rediscovered in 1985

“USING YOUR 
PHONE AT 
THE PETROL 
STATION 
COULD 
CAUSE AN 
EXPLOSION”
Mobile phones have been held accountable 
for causing horrific accidents, but much like 
the stories of crashing planes, exploding 
petrol stations are also a myth. There is 
absolutely no scientific evidence to suggest 
that emitted radiation from a mobile phone 
can ignite gasoline vapours, but the rumour 
was propagated with the best of intentions. 
Phone manufacturers started this by 
printing warnings about phone use near 
gasoline in user manuals, and in response to 
this, oil companies reacted with caution, with 
both industries working together to enforce 
something they felt would protect people. 
But, once evidence had come to light to 
disprove the fire theory, petrol stations that 
chose to keep the ‘phones off’ rule did so 
because they’re an unwanted distraction, 
rather than a danger.
“RECIRCULATED 
AIR INSIDE PLANES 
SPREADS DISEASE”
Nothing says uncomfortable like being trapped inside a confined 
space with only questionable airplane food and the thought that 
you’re breathing the same continuously recirculated air for the next 
few hours. You become very aware of the amount of people who 
are coughing, sneezing and spluttering their way through the 
aircraft, convinced you will quickly succumb to the sniffles. 
It might feel like you’re breathing in air saturated with germs, 
but modern aircraft now have exceptionally powerful systems that 
use HEPA filters to catch up to 99.97 per cent of airborne microbes. 
The air is also filtered and recirculated approximately once every 
two to four minutes. In fact, it’s probably cleaner than the air in 
your office, which is usually only refreshed about 12 times an hour. 
The supply of fresh air in a plane isn’t lacking either, with 50 per 
cent of the cabin supply being crisp air from outside. This air is 
drawn into the plane continuously via compressor stages in the 
jet’s engines. So the next time you’re on a flight, while there might 
not be much you can do about the person kicking your seat, at 
least you can breathe easy about the air quality.
It might not seem like a 
nice thought, but the air on 
a plane is actually cleaner 
than the air in your office

We pick apart 
some of the 
most common 
misconceptions 
in the cosmos
“THERE’S ZERO 
GRAVITY IN ORBIT”
Perhaps the most common misconception 
about space concerns what space actually 
is. A lot of people seem to think that when 
you launch a rocket straight upwards, you 
eventually reach a point where you start 
ﬂoating. That’s why the astronauts on the 
International Space Station (ISS) appear 
weightless, right?
Well, we’re afraid that’s just not true. 
The reason astronauts on the ISS appear 
to be ﬂoating is because they’re in 
constant free fall towards Earth. In the 
late 17th century, Isaac Newton ﬁrst 
published his thought experiment to 
demonstrate his concept. He suggested 
that if you ﬁred a cannonball horizontally 
from the surface of Earth — at greater and 
greater speeds — the ball would not hit 
the Earth but instead orbit the planet. 
That’s basically what’s happening on the 
ISS. They’re moving so fast (over 28,000 
kilometres per hour) that they constantly 
fall towards the Earth. As a result, they’re 
in constant free fall and appear to 
experience weightlessness. 
In fact, at an altitude ranging between 
370–460 kilometres above the Earth’s 
surface, the ISS still experiences 90 per 
cent of Earth’s gravity. Everything in orbit 
experiences the pull of our planet, it’s just 
that they move so fast sideways that it 
seems like they are weightless. So, the 
next time you see footage of astronauts 
ﬂoating around, just remember they’re 
not in zero gravity. They’re actually 
constantly falling, but thanks to the 
extremely low friction of the upper 
atmosphere, their spacecraft never slows 
down, so they never fall to Earth.
“THE ASTEROID 
BELT IS FULL OF 
ASTEROIDS”
Blame Star Wars for this one. In The Empire Strikes Back, Han and 
co weave their way through an asteroid belt in the Millennium 
Falcon, dodging flying rocks all over the place, against the odds. It 
was a great scene, sure, but the science was lacking. The problem 
is that asteroids just aren’t that close together. They’re really, really 
far apart, and flying between them would be a breeze. In the 
asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, you’d be 
hard-pressed to even see one asteroid from the surface of another.
Scientists estimate the main asteroid belt contains between 1.1 
and 1.9 million asteroids larger than one kilometre in diameter, and 
millions of smaller ones. Most known asteroids orbit in this main 
region, and on average each sizeable asteroid is at least several 
million kilometres away from another, with the chances of a 
collision being about one in 1 billion. Could we assume that in a 
galaxy far, far away, they’ve found an asteroid belt that’s much 
more tightly packed? Absolutely. But in ours, this scene would have 
been a lot less exciting.
The sensation 
of being in 
space can 
make it feel 
like there’s 
no gravity
Astronauts on the ISS can have a great 
time in the microgravity environment

“BLACK 
HOLES SUCK 
EVERYTHING IN”
Contrary to popular belief, black 
holes are not cosmic vacuum 
cleaners that suck up everything in 
their vicinity. In fact, they behave 
not that diferently from a star at 
irst. It’s when you get close that 
things start to get weird.
First, let’s back up. A black hole 
forms when the centre of a massive 
star goes supernova, leaving 
behind a dense core that collapses 
in on itself. These are known as 
stellar mass black holes and, as 
their name suggests, they’re 
actually quite similar in mass to a 
star. If the Sun was substituted by a 
black hole of equal mass, all the 
planets currently orbiting the Sun 
would continue on their orbits as 
they are now and would not 
instantly be pulled in. But the Sun 
is not massive enough to ever 
evolve into a black hole.
At the heart of our galaxy is a 
supermassive black hole, known as 
Sagittarius A*, and we see these at 
the centre of almost every massive 
galaxy. Again, these black holes 
clearly don’t suck everything in. 
Some, in more distant galaxies, are 
surrounded by a quasar — a 
superheated accretion disc of gas 
and dust — and some can ire jets. 
But there is a point beyond which 
black holes behave quite strangely. 
At the edge of its inner core, which 
can be just a few kilometres across, 
you’ll ind the event horizon. This is 
where the gravitational pull is so 
intense that nothing — not even 
light — can escape. At this point, 
you could probably say that the 
black hole was sucking you in. 
What happens next is anyone’s 
guess, however, because what goes 
in never comes out.
“YOU’D EXPLODE 
WITHOUT A SPACESUIT”
Contrary to what some films might have you believe, taking your suit off in space 
won’t cause you to immediately explode. Yes, your outlook isn’t great, but it 
might not be as dramatic as some think. The first thing that would happen is 
you’d lose consciousness after about 15 seconds due to a lack of oxygen after 
your body has used up the oxygen in your blood. Before this happens, you would 
have needed to breathe out as much air from your lungs as possible, otherwise 
that oxygen will rupture your lung tissue.
Next up you’ve got ebullism, where the drop in pressure (spacesuits are like 
mini spacecraft, remember) causes gas bubbles to form inside your body fluids. 
A test subject accidentally exposed to a vacuum in 1965 reported that he also 
started to feel saliva on his tongue boiling due to the drop in pressure. So after a 
few minutes you’d be in pretty serious trouble, and while you might not explode, 
you probably don’t want to stay outside for too long.

“MERCURY IS THE 
HOTTEST PLANET”
Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, so 
surely it should be the hottest planet, right? 
Well, not quite, and the reason why is rather 
interesting. The hottest planet in the 
Solar System is actually Venus, 
with an average surface 
temperature of 462 degrees 
Celsius. But, Mercury 
reaches highs of ‘only’ 427 
degrees Celsius.
The reason for this 
diference is that Venus, 
unlike Mercury, has a 
thick atmosphere. Instead, 
Mercury possesses a thin 
exosphere made up of atoms 
blasted of its surface by solar 
wind and micrometeoroids. While 
Mercury heats up in direct sunlight, things get 
hotter on Venus, where the mainly carbon 
dioxide atmosphere traps the Sun’s heat in 
a runaway greenhouse efect. 
Scientists think that Venus may 
once have actually had 
shallow-liquid water 
oceans and habitable 
surface temperatures, but 
exposure to sunlight 
caused the ocean to 
evaporate, and with no 
water vapour remaining, 
the planet’s atmosphere 
has thickened and its 
temperatures have risen.
“THE GREAT 
WALL OF CHINA 
IS VISIBLE 
FROM SPACE”
“THE SUN IS 
YELLOW”
More specifically, this myth claims that the Great 
Wall of China is the only human-made object visible 
from space. We’re sorry to burst your bubble but this 
simply isn’t true, although it does depend on what 
you count as space. Even from low-Earth orbit 
(around 160 kilometres up), the wall is not visible to 
the naked eye. It’s just too thin, and the colours don’t 
stand out much from the surrounding landscape. On 
the ISS, it is barely visible using a camera, and even 
then only under perfect conditions, but it is certainly 
not visible from the Moon. 
However, you can see other evidence of humanity 
from the ISS with the naked eye, such as cities in the 
day and night, as well as airports, dams, bridges and 
even the pyramids. The official boundary of space is 
100 kilometres up, but even from here you’d struggle 
to see the five-to-ten-meter-wide Great Wall unaided. 
Think the Sun is yellow? Think again… sort of. The 
Sun emits all wavelengths of visible light, from violet 
to red. This means that it would appear white if you 
could view it with the naked eye in space. However, 
each colour corresponds to a different temperature, 
with yellow-green light of 550 nanometres 
emanating from about 5,700 degrees Celsius. 
From Earth the Sun appears yellow because the 
longer-wavelength yellow light is less easily 
scattered by our atmosphere than shorter-
wavelength colours like blue and violet.

System thanks to its thick atmosphere

It might seem like the Moon has a dark side, but actually the

pervades is because from Earth we can only see one side of the

There is a far side of the Moon that we never see, but in

“Chimps and humans

one another, rather 
than us descending 
from them”
“HUMANS 
EVOLVED FROM 
CHIMPANZEES”
Although there are similarities 
between humans and 
chimpanzees, such as opposable 
thumbs and facial features, but 
chimps didn’t just shed their fur 
and start making ﬁres. We are, 
however, genetically related to 
chimps through our common 
ancestors, along with other great 
apes like gorillas and bonobos. 
The ﬁrst sign of primates on 
Earth dates back to around 55 
million years ago (MYA). Then, from 
a common ancestor, chimps and 
humans split into two distinct 
genetic timelines between 8–6 
MYA, although a more recent study 
suggests that divergence may have 
occurred up to 13 MYA. Our primate 
cousins continued to evolve into 
the apes we see today, whereas 
others evolved into the group 
known as Hominini, of which we 
are the only surviving species. 
Chimpanzees remained in the 
group Hominoidea, which divides 
over 20 species between great apes 
such as orangutans and lesser apes 
such as gibbons. 
It was around 5.8 MYA that one of 
our proposed ancestors — Orrorin 
tugenensis — walked on two legs, 
despite closely resembling a 
chimpanzee. About 4 MYA, our 
prehistoric species developed a 
brain more representative of the 
Homo sapiens we are today  — these 
more advanced ancestors were 
Australopithecus afarensis. Our use 
of tools dates back some 2.6 MYA, 
regularly used by Homo habilis and 
Homo erectus, who around 1.8 MYA, 
was the ﬁrst to stand up straight. 
Though we started our 
evolutionary journey together, 
chimps and humans evolved 
alongside one another rather than 
us descending from them.

“DIAMONDS 
ARE MADE 
FROM COAL”
It is often thought that diamonds form 
from the compression of coal, but these 
beautiful gems originate from a deeper 
geology. The confusion comes from their 
similarly high content of carbon. Both 
diamonds and coal are made of carbon, 
but they form in diferent 
layers within the Earth. 
Diamonds form in 
the Earth’s mantle, 
around 145 
kilometres below 
the surface. At 
temperatures of 
around 1,050 
degrees Celsius, 
diamonds form from 
carbon under the 
immense pressure of the 
Earth’s mantle. Ejected via 
volcanic eruptions, diamonds are pushed 
to the surface, hitching a ride on a magma 
channel rising from the mantle. 
Diamonds have also been known to 
come from the subduction zone, where an 
oceanic plate collides with a continental 
plate, forcing the oceanic plate 
underneath its continental counterpart. 
This process occurs at a lower 
temperature and pressure, so smaller 
diamonds are formed.  
On the other hand, as a 
sedimentary rock, coal is the 
product of the 
decomposition of natural 
materials such as sea life 
and plant material. Coal is 
formed much higher up in 
the mantle, and is rarely 
buried to depths greater 
than 3.2 kilometres. Though it 
would make a great rags to riches 
story, in the case of diamonds, it’s riches 
all the way. 
The word ‘diamond’ is 
derived from the 
Greek word ‘adamas’, 
meaning invincible  
or indestructible
Once cut and polished, diamonds 
present their unique sparkle
Strong bonds
Each carbon atom inside 
a diamond is covalently 
bonded to four other 
carbon atoms.
Under pressure
Created under intense 
pressure and heat, 
diamonds are the 
hardest natural mineral.
“CAMELS’ HUMPS 
ARE FILLED 
WITH WATER”
In order to survive the intense heat of the 
desert climate, one or two giant biological 
water bottles sounds like a great idea. But 
the idea of a camels’ hydrating humps are 
just a myth, but a myth not far from the 
truth. Rather than being filled with water, 
camels’ humps are filled with fat. 
Similar to the lack of water, deserts aren’t 
known for their lush green vegetation. These 
mobile mounds of fat stores offer energy for 
camels to make use of when food is scarce. 
The longer the time between meals, the 
more deflated these humps appear as their 
resources are being used up. This isn’t to say 
that camels don’t consume a lot of water; 
they just don’t store it in their humps. When 
arriving at a watery oasis, the two-humped 
Bactrian camel, for example, can drink over 
100 litres of water in one go. 
But, camels do have biological adaptations 
to optimise water storage. For example, 
camels’ faeces is dry, they have little urine 
output and are able to fluctuate their body 
temperature to reduce levels of sweat. So, 
while their humps aren’t filled with water, 
they have made the changes needed to 
survive in the harsh climate of the desert.

“CLOUDS ARE 
LIGHTWEIGHT”
Like cotton wool, clouds are always used to describe the lighter 
things in life. But while they may glide gracefully around a blue sky, 
clouds are the heavyweight giants of our atmosphere. When you 
consider the amount of water that comes from a massive 
downpour, imagine how heavy the cloud must have been to hold it. 
The water density of an average fluffy cumulus cloud is about 
0.5 grams per cubic metre. If you propose a cloud that is one 
kilometre long, tall and wide, that gives you a total of 1 billion cubic 
metres in volume. That works out at around 500 tons of water — 
the same as around two and half blue whales floating above our 
heads! This method also suggests that larger and denser 
cumulonimbus clouds could weigh around 1 million tons! It’s a huge 
weight, but the surrounding atmosphere is denser than the cloud, 
so it floats. Temperature also plays a part in keeping these clouds 
in the air, as warmer air is less dense than cool. 
As we know, when a cloud gets too full of water, droplets form 
and we get rain, and the weight of the cloud reduces as a result. So 
next time it’s a cloudy day and pouring it down, there could be 
literally tons of water falling over your head.
It’s another ‘is a tomato a fruit or a vegetable?’ debate. Botanically, a fruit is deﬁned as a 
seed-bearing structure that develops from the ﬂowering plants of a woody tree or bush. 
The evolutionary purpose for this structure is to entice animals to eat the juicy sweet or 
sour fruit, helping to spread the seeds in their waste, thereby helping plants reproduce.
The humble banana, however, does not encapsulate its seeds around a ﬂeshy fruit. 
Instead, the small black seeds (the little dots in the middle) are within the banana’s 
ﬂesh, making it more of a berry, which they would be classiﬁed as if their seeds were 
fertile. Since bananas have been commercially grown the seeds do not mature, and the 
‘tree’ a banana grows on doesn’t contain true woody tissue, making them a simple herb.
“GOLDFISH HAVE 
THREE-SECOND 
MEMORIES”
‘You’ve got the memory of a goldfish’ is something often heard 
over your shoulder while you’re hunting for a bundle of misplaced 
keys. This myth began when humans decided to take these orange 
iridescent fish as pets. Some think that the myth originated as a 
justification for keeping fish in small tanks. By the time they had 
done one lap of the bowl it would be a new experience going 
around the second, then the third time, and so on. 
However, studies have shown this to be untrue. Research has 
revealed that goldfish can remember food locations and even the 
people who feed them. Just think, when you go to feed your 
goldfish, do they come up to greet you? One study by The Technion 
– Israel Institute of Technology conducted a fascinating study to 
test out this myth. 
The research team trained captive fish to associate a particular 
sound with that of feeding time. They continued this for a month 
before releasing them into the wild. The fish were left in the wild 
for five months, the sound was then played again and the fish that 
remembered the association between the sound and food came 
back. So the next time you lose your keys, try asking the goldfish.

“LIGHTNING 
NEVER 
STRIKES IN 
THE SAME 
PLACE 
TWICE”
It’s a common myth that if you stand where a lightning bolt 
just struck then you’re safe. It appears that probability is the 
driving force behind this potentially dangerous myth, but 
there is a higher chance to be struck twice than you’d think.  
In order for a lightning bolt to hit the ground, a discharge of 
pent up electrical energy within the cloud travels through 
ionised air. In a matter of milliseconds, the strike 
reverberates, meaning multiple strikes occur during what 
appears to be singular event. As this is a cloud-to-ground 
event, the closer objects on the Earth’s surface are to the 
cloud, the more likely they are to be struck. Take the Empire 
State Building, for example, which gets hit an average of 23 
times a year. Fortunately, it is equipped with lightning rods to 
help ground the charge in order to keep everyone inside safe.    
In the US there are 
around 30 fatalities 
due to lightning 
strikes each year
1. A perfect storm
The movement of water and ice droplets 
within clouds can create charge 
separation. As rising droplets collide with 
falling ice or sleet particles, electrons can 
get knocked off of the rising moisture. 
3. Repulsion
If the charge separation builds to a 
sufficient level, the negative charge 
of the cloud base becomes strong 
enough to repel negative electrons 
in the ground, inducing a positive 
charge on the surface below. 
2. Charge separation
These collisions lead to the 
separation of charge within the 
cloud, with negatively charged 
ions at the base and the positively 
charged rising moisture at the top.
Multiple types 
In order for lightning to be 
generated, positive and negative 
ions must be separated. It can occur 
as cloud-to-gound, cloud-to-cloud, 
cloud-to-air and intra-cloud.
4. Neutralise the charge
The opposing positive and negative 
charges seek to neutralise one 
another. When the difference in 
charge gets too high, the 
surrounding air becomes ionised 
(separated into electrons and 
positive ions), helping electrons to 
move more easily.
5. Lightning strikes
The ionised air creates a path between 
the cloud and the ground which 
electrons can travel through. This leads 
to a rapid discharge of electricity, 
which we see as lightning.

Although they look incredibly heavy, 15th 
century suits of armour weigh in at around 14–23 
kilograms. Despite this, they were not dificult to 
move about in or mount a horse while wearing. 
Knights had to remain as agile as possible in 
order to stay combat efective, or even just 
survive a melee. If armour really had been so 
heavy that a fallen knight could not have stood 
up again on his own, or been able to re-mount 
his horse, the smallest trip in battle would have 
been a death sentence. 
While the metal plates had to be tough 
enough for ample protection, they also had to be 
light enough for prolonged action and a range of 
movement. A suit of plate armour could be 
comprised of around 18 main separate pieces, 
each protecting a diferent limb or vital organ. 
Importantly, each piece had to move lexibly 
with the wearer, and without restricting any 
movement such as a sword swing or even some 
light running. 
One of the origins of the impossibly heavy 
armour is found in the 1944 ilm Henry V, 
produced by Laurence Olivier. This depicts 
knights being hoisted onto their mounts using 
cranes — a bizarre iction with no historical 
evidence. By contrast, there are historical 
accounts of armoured soldiers performing 
almost acrobatic feats, including Bertrand du 
Guesclin, who is recorded leaping to and from 
his horse. 
Modern-day soldiers, by comparison, 
regularly take more than 50 kilograms of 
armour, weaponry and equipment into combat, 
the majority of which is carried in their 
backpacks. With a suit of armour, the weight is 
spread mostly evenly over the wearer’s entire 
body, making it much easier to bear and balance 
while wearing. This means that far from being 
restricted by impossibly heavy armour, knights 
ighting centuries ago were arguably more light 
and agile than their 21st-century counterparts.

“ANNE 
BOLEYN  
HAD AN 
EXTRA 
FINGER”
Famous for being the doomed second wife 
of Henry VIII, Anne Boleyn was charged 
with adultery, incest and high treason. 
She had faced many accusations, but 
having an extra ﬁnger wasn’t one of them. 
In fact, the claim wasn’t even made during 
her lifetime. 
Decades after Boleyn’s death, a Catholic 
propagandist called Nicholas Sander 
wrote that she had “a projecting tooth 
under the upper lip, and on her right 
hand, six ﬁngers”. He added that she had a 
large wart under her chin. In Tudor 
England physical imperfections were 
thought to be a sign of evil, and Sander 
had portrayed Boleyn as a witch who had 
seduced the king. But would such an 
unsightly woman have captured the heart 
of the Tudor tyrant? It seems very 
unlikely, for so determined was Henry to 
marry her that he broke away from the 
Catholic Church and established his own 
– the Church of England.
Nicholas Sander never actually met 
Boleyn in person and was only a boy 
when she was beheaded in 1536. It’s likely 
Anne’s rumoured disﬁgurements were a 
way of discrediting her daughter, Queen 
Elizabeth I. It was her religious policies 
that forced Sander into exile, and he 
wasn’t alone in attacking the Protestant 
monarch’s parentage in a vengeful bid to 
sully her name. 
What’s more, Anne’s ﬁrst biographer, 
George Wyatt, had spoken to those who 
knew her and admitted that while she did 
have several moles and an extra nail on 
her little ﬁnger, there was no sixth digit. 
And when a body believed to have been 
Boleyn was exhumed at the Tower of 
London in the 19th century, there was no 
evidence to support Sander’s slander.
“VOMITORIUMS 
WERE USED FOR 
THROWING UP IN”
The Romans were fond of a feast. They would gorge on delicacies 
like wild boar, pheasant, lobsters and songbirds until they couldn’t 
eat any more. That’s when they would take a trip to the vomitorium 
– a room where the diner could expel their previous courses and 
return to eat some more. Or so pop culture would have us believe.
In ancient Rome, vomitoriums were actually the entrance and 
exit passages of amphitheatres. The 5th-century writer Macrobius 
chose this charming Latin word because of the way people ‘spewed 
forth’ into their seats at these open-air venues.
It seems people may have got confused over time, which isn’t 
surprising given the infamous gluttony of Rome’s emperors. 
Claudius was said to always finish a meal bloated and confined to 
bed, while Vitellius allegedly ate the sacrificial meat from an altar! 
But even emperors didn’t have a special chunder chamber.
When the wife of King Louis XVI was told her French subjects had 
no bread to eat, she retorted, “Let them eat cake.” Or did she? It 
was 1789, crop failures had left the starving population deeply 
resentful of the monarchy, and the Austrian-born queen became 
their target. However, the phrase ‘let them eat cake’ had been used 
for years. More than a century earlier, Marie-Thérèse – the Spanish 
bride of King Louis XIV – supposedly said the French people should 
eat “the crust of the pâté”. 
The infamous remark stuck though, and Marie Antoinette’s 
reputation for decadence was blamed for causing the country’s 
economic downturn. While it’s true that she embraced life at 
Versailles, her love of palace parties, fashion and gambling wasn’t 
the cause of the French Revolution. Nevertheless, the 
misunderstood monarch was sentenced to death along with the 
rest of the royal family, but the myth survived her.

“300 SPARTANS ALONE 
FOUGHT THE PERSIAN 
ARMY AT THERMOPYLAE”
In 480 BCE King Leonidas made a 
brave last stand against a horde of 
enemies at the head of only 300 of his 
ferocious hoplite warriors. It is one of 
the most compelling stories of ancient 
Greece, but is it entirely true? 
In reality, between 6,000–7,000 
fellow Greeks joined the Spartans at 
the Battle of Thermopylae, travelling 
from across Greece to defend against 
the Persian invasion led by King 
Xerxes I. Among those ighting with 
the 300 Spartans, Herodotus lists 700 
Thespians, 400 Thebans, 1,120 
Arcadians, 1,000 Phocians, and more. 
Nonetheless, the Greeks were still 
greatly outnumbered against up to 
100,000 Persian soldiers. 
The Greek army was deployed in a 
narrow coastal pass, nicknamed the 
Hot Gate, where the overwhelming 
numbers of attacking Persians could 
not be efected. According to 
Herodotus, the crucial turning point 
in the battle came when the Persian 
army was led to a secret mountain 
pass, enabling them to overcome the 
Phocian guards. 
In the 2006 ilm 300, it is at this 
point that the Spartans’ allies 
abandon them out of fear, while 
Leonidas declares he and his men 
will stay and ight to the death. 
However, even this scene is 
inaccurate, as several of the 
Greek allies remained ighting 
to the bitter end, including 
those forces from Thespiae 
and Thebes. 
While the Thespians 
reportedly stayed 
willingly with Leonidas, 
Herodotus writes that 
the king kept the 
Theban troops against 
their will. Regardless, 
the Persian army 
eventually crushed 
their Greek 
opponents, who had 
fought their way 
into legend.
“NAPOLEON 
WAS SHORT”
Despite conquering much of Europe 
single-handedly, Napoleon Bonaparte 
is almost as well known for his short 
stature. But, in reality the emperor of 
France was around five foot, 6.5 
inches (1.69 metres) tall, making him 
above average height for men in both 
France and England at that time. 
When he died in 1821, Napoleon was 
measured to be five foot, 2 inches 
(1.57 metres) tall. Unfortunately for 
the deceased, this was taken in French 
feet and inches, which were slightly 
larger than English measurements. In 
the early 19th century the metric 
system was not yet used universally, 
meaning there was no standarised 
measurement. When interpreted as 
English feet, Napoleon’s height was 
therefore mistakenly recorded as 
being over four inches shorter. 
However, even before his death the 
emperor had been mocked for his 
supposed tiny size. Another source of 
this myth is found in the British press 
of the period. Newspaper columns 
roundly criticised Napoleon, printing 
caricatures depicting him as a tiny 
child throwing temper tantrums. This 
impression was aided by his nickname 
‘Le Petit Caporal’ (the little corporal) 
among his troops, and the fact his 
personal bodyguard, the Old Guard, 
had a minimum height requirement of 
six feet (1.8 metres), towering above 
him by comparison. 
This myth has proven so persuasive 
that a theoretical condition was 
named after the emperor’s supposedly 
short stature. The ‘Napoleon complex’ 
suggests that shorter-than-average 
men become more aggressive, seek 
more attention in social gatherings 
and possess greater ambition than 
average-height or tall men. Experts 
still question the accuracy of this, but 
what’s certain is that Napoleon was by 
no means vertically challenged.

“VIKINGS WORE 
HORNED HELMETS”
Vikings were seafaring Scandinavians that 
raided, traded and garnered a bloodthirsty 
reputation between the 8th to 11th centuries. 
The famous beastly horned helmets seem to ﬁt 
the stereotype, but there’s actually no evidence 
to suggest they ever wore them. 
This myth was popularised after writers and 
artists used the headgear in their portrayals of 
Vikings. In the 1870s, German costume designer 
Carl Emil Doepler, created horned helmets for 
Wagner’s Norse-inspired opera, and is often 
credited with cementing this stereotype. 
Perhaps these creators were inspired by 
19th-century archaeological discoveries of 
horned helmets — but these were later found to 
predate the Vikings.
The only shred of evidence that can be called 
‘Viking’ was discovered at a Gjermundbu burial 
mound, but this 10th-century artifact does not 
have any horns. It’s possible such helmets were 
used for ceremonial purposes, but it’s very 
unlikely they were worn aboard warships — the 
space would have been too limited — and they 
wouldn’t be practical in battle either. Instead, 
it’s thought that Norsemen wore leather 
skullcaps or domed metal helmets with brow 
ridges, fragments of which have been 
discovered. It could also be possible that some 
Vikings didn’t wear any headgear at all, which 
would explain why only a small number of 
helmets have been found.
That’s not the only myth surrounding the 
Vikings though. Portrayed as beardy, illiterate 
savages, we’ve since discovered they groomed 
themselves with combs and razors; they 
developed a complex alphabet of runes; and 
while some spilled a lot of blood in their bid to 
conquer foreign lands, others earned a peaceful 
living through farming and trading.

HEROES OF…
TECHNOLOGY
B
orn in June 1955 in London, Sir Timothy 
Berners-Lee’s pioneering work has 
transformed every aspect of our lives; he 
is the creator of one of the greatest inventions of 
the 20th century. Berners-Lee was not the ﬁrst in 
his family to master mathematics; his parents 
Conway Berners-Lee and Mary Lee Woods also 
dedicated their lives to the subject. His passion 
for science led him to attend Oxford University, 
where in 1976 he graduated with a ﬁrst-class 
degree in physics. 
After completing his degree, Berners-Lee 
moved on to become a scientist at CERN, the 
European Organization for Nuclear Research, in 
1989. That same year, Berners-Lee published a 
paper titled Information Management: A 
Proposal, in which he suggested the combination 
of hypertext and the internet for an information 
management system. 
In this initial proposal for the World Wide 
Web, Berners-Lee described the shortcomings of 
the then-current system at CERN in allowing 
scientists access to their information and 
documentation. Though the internet had been 
around for a decade, the information had limited 
accessibility. Berners-Lee set out to connect both 
the internet and a web-structured platform to 
revolutionise data sharing. To achieve this he 
created the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), 
Uniform Resource Identiﬁer (URI) and Hypertext 
Makeup Language (HTML), the building blocks 
for internet browsing that remain in use today. 
Created to better serve CERN scientists and 
assist those across the globe with their research, 
Berners-Lee launched the ﬁrst website, http://
info.cern.ch, in 1990. This new way to obtain 
information was something Berners-Lee wanted 
the entire world to have access to. He decided to 
make the World Wide Web an open and royalty-
free software, allowing it to grow beyond 
academia. By 1994 there were around 3,000 
websites in existence: today there are over 1 
billion. After such a roaring success, Berners-Lee 
created W3C (World Wide Web Consortium), a 
web standards organisation that also develops 
web speciﬁcations, guidelines, software and

tools. With the continued success of the iconic 
‘www.’, Berners-Lee founded the World Wide 
Web Foundation in 2009, an organisation 
working to deliver digital equality to the world.
Berners-Lee has been honoured with 
multiple awards over the years, including the 
prestigious ACM AM Turing Award (referred to as 
the ‘Nobel Prize of computing’). In 1997, he was 
appointed an Oficer of the Order of the British 
Empire (OBE), then in 2004 he was promoted to 
Knight Commander (KBE) “for services to the 
global development of the internet”. 
Following decades of scientiic and economic 
success, Berners-Lee has now returned to his 
Oxford University roots. Joining the staf as a 
Professor of Computer Science, Berners-Lee is

The concept of the World Wide Web is relatively 
simple: it works to provide the user with information 
from a variety of sources in a non-linear fashion, hence 
a ‘web’. The construction, however, is not so simple. Sir 
Tim Berners-Lee used something called hypertext to 
achieve this. By allowing text to hold more text and 
other information within it, users can jump from one 
place to another. It works in a similar way to how a 
hyperlink would work on a text document but in a 
continuous fashion. Combined with the global capacity 
of the internet, hypertext is placed within browser 
platforms and held on different servers to enable 
global connectivity.
With the use of servers and the internet, hypertext  
documents can be accessed from across the globe

omputer screens produce images made 
up of millions of pixels — tiny dots that 
can each be programmed to display one 
of millions of possible colours. In order to know 
which colour each pixel is supposed to present at 
any given time, a graphics card is needed to 
efectively translate the computer’s binary data 
into instructions for all of the screen’s pixels.
To achieve this, graphics cards comprise four 
main components: a motherboard, a processor, 
memory and a connection to the screen. The 
motherboard allows the components on the 
card to communicate with each other, as well as 
enabling them to receive power from the 
device’s battery or mains connection. The 
processor, also called a graphics processing unit 
(GPU), is responsible for deciding what each 
pixel on the screen should be doing. The GPU 
performs lots of complex calculations in order to 
do this to ensure graphics are rendered 
accurately and smoothly. The memory 
temporarily holds the information generated by 
the processor before it is transmitted to the 
monitor to produce the image you see on screen.
How do these computer components turn 
binary data into pixel pictures?

nternet Protocol (IP) addresses are unique codes 
used to identify devices on a network. Similar to 
the way we would use phone numbers to contact 
speciic people, IP addresses are used to send data 
between internet-connected machines. There are 
two types of IP address used online: every device 
connected to the internet uses IP version 4 (IPv4), 
and some also use the newer IP version 6 (IPv6).
IPv4 addresses are expressed as four numbers 
separated by dots. For example: 123.45.67.89. This 
igure is a decimal representation of an eight-digit 
binary number. Decimal is our standard (base-10) 
numerical system, whereas binary is the base-2 
numerical system that computers use. There are 
around 4.3 billion possible unique IPv4 addresses, 
so as the number of internet-connected devices 
grew, IPv6 was introduced to accommodate increased demand.
IPv6 addresses are expressed as eight groups of hexadecimal numbers 
separated by colons, as shown in the example igure below. In this system, 
there are a possible 340 trillion trillion trillion unique addresses, providing 
plenty more room for internet growth in the foreseeable future.

ou might notice them being built around an old building on your street 
almost overnight, but scafolding can also used to support structures such as 
half-pipes, ski ramps and concert stages. Scafolding is even used to maintain 
large boats and iconic landmarks such as London’s Elizabeth Tower. 
The teams of scafolders need a strong head for heights and impeccable balance. 
It’s no easy task to lift, move and place thousands of steel tubes, weighing 
approximately 4.5 kilograms per metre, and there is a lot at stake if things go 
wrong. Though it can look a little precarious to see construction workers on 
top of dizzyingly tall skyscrapers, feel assured that scafolding is 
assembled to a very high standard and is regulated by authorities. 
However, this isn’t a new technology we’ve developed in recent years. 
The paleolithic cave paintings at Lascaux in southwest France are 
accompanied with markings that suggest a scafold system was 
built to paint the ceiling around 17,000 years ago. 
Today, a scafolding structure primarily consists of tubes, 
couplers and boards. Tubes are generally made from steel or 
aluminium, with a standardised diameter of 48.3 millimetres and 
are available in diferent lengths. The couplers are used to hold 
the tubes together in their familiar grid pattern, of which there 
are three basic varieties. Finally, the boards allow construction 
workers to move around on the scafolding and tend to 
be made from seasoned wood. 
These everyday structures are 
vital in the ield of construction
How does 
scaffolding work?
 
Bamboo scaffolding
Hong Kong’s iconic skyline is dotted with skyscrapers, 
and surrounding many of them is a traditional scaffold 
structure crafted with bamboo. Instead of steel or 
aluminium, parts of Asia have utilised this flexible, 
strong and lightweight wood for centuries. The plant 
grows in abundance, taking approximately four years to 
grow to the correct height before being chopped down, 
dried for two months, and cut into seven-metre tubes 
to use in construction. It might look precarious to see 
the wood lashed together with nylon strips, but the 
design of a grid pattern formed by 75-centimetre 
squares offers so much stability that skyscrapers up to 
70 stories tall can be built using this ancient craft.
Bamboo scaffolding is so lightweight that it can be constructed 
much faster than metal structures

he US’s gold reserves are held in several 
institutions across the country, but 
arguably none are more famous than the 
Fort Knox Bullion Depository near Louisville, 
Kentucky. Considered to be one of the world’s 
most secure vaults, Fort Knox hosts a signiicant 
proportion of the nation’s gold in the form of bars 
and coins (known as bullion).
Construction of the facility began in 1935 and 
was completed one year – plus over 450 cubic 
metres of granite, 3,200 cubic metres of concrete, 
750 tons of reinforced steel and 670 tons of 
structural steel – later. Upon its completion, the 
Depository was placed under the jurisdiction of 
the US Mint, and the irst shipments of gold 
arrived in 1937. This precious metal cargo had to 
be shipped by rail through the US Postal Service 
as it was too heavy to ly, and the Postal Service 
were the only couriers able to accept liability if 
any of the gold went missing.
Since then, the vault’s gold reserves have 
grown considerably, so protecting the facility is 
paramount. The Fort Knox Depository is 
reportedly equipped with an array of advanced 
security systems, some of which are outlined 
below. Understandably, many of the site’s 
security systems and protocols are classiied. In 
the words of the US Mint, “perhaps the most 
advanced security system the Depository has to 
ofer is its secrecy”.

ost of us are familiar with the 
unpleasant sensation of a nosebleed. 
They are common because there are so 
many blood vessels in your nose, and it doesn’t 
take a lot of trauma for them to burst. They can 
start from one of two places – inside your nostrils 
(anterior) or at the back of your nose (posterior). 
Anterior nosebleeds can be caused by a minor 
injury to the nose, high altitude or allergies. 
However, posterior nosebleeds start from 
ruptured arteries supplying blood to the space 
between the roof of your mouth and your brain. 
These more serious bleeds are less common and 
are caused by head injuries or a broken nose, 
among others.
How are the delicate blood 
vessels in your nose

ctivated carbon, also known as activated 
charcoal, is a form of carbon that has 
been processed to create an extremely 
porous structure. It is made by heating carbon-
rich materials to an extremely high temperature 
until pure carbon is formed and is then generally 
activated in a steam atmosphere to incorporate 
air bubbles within it to increase its surface area. 
This versatile, ine black powder gets its 
amazing abilities from the tiny holes within it 
that can trap chemicals, making it useful in a 
wide range of diferent industries.
Activated carbon can be utilised in a variety of 
iltration and distillation methods due to its 
adsorption properties, including water and air 
puriication and sewage treatment. One of the 
most vital industries that use this type of 
charcoal is emergency medicine, where it’s used 
to treat poisoning and overdoses, by binding 
with toxins to prevent them from being 
absorbed into the body. Recently, there has been 
a trend of using charcoal to whiten teeth, but 
there is no scientiic evidence to prove that this 
method actually works.

he average adult human body is around 1.6–1.8 metres in height and packed with 
some 30 trillion cells. But if you were to take some of your body’s individual tissues 
and cells and place them in a straight line, they would stretch much further. When 
you consider the dimensions of DNA, these values become truly astronomical.
Most cells in the body contain 23 chromosomes, each of which consists of tightly wound 
coils of DNA. If you were able to unwind all the DNA in a cell, it would stretch to a 
cumulative length of about two metres. With an estimated 37.2 trillion cells in the average 
human body, all this DNA stacked end to end would create a strand 74.7 billion kilometres 
long, enough to reach from Earth to the Sun and back almost 250 times!
Find out why the dimensions of your body’s 
cellular components are truly out of this world
Myelinated neurons
With billions of neurons in the brain alone, it’s difficult to 
estimate the total length of nerve fibres in the human 
body. A Danish study in 2003 investigated the brain’s 
white matter (consisting of myelinated nerve fibres) and 
found the average 20-year-old has between 149,000 and 
176,000 kilometres worth. This number inevitably rises if 
the entire brain and the rest of the body are considered.
Blood vessels
Your body contains a vast network of arteries, veins and 
capillaries to transport blood around the body. The 
longest vessel is the great saphenous vein, which runs 
from the thigh to the top of the foot, while the smallest 
vessels are tiny capillaries. Some capillaries are less than 
five micrometres (0.005 millimetres) long — less than 
one-third the width of a human hair.
Red blood cells
It is estimated that there are around 20–30 trillion red 
blood cells in the average adult, more than all the other 
cells of the body combined. These cells are among the 
smallest in the body, approximately six to eight 
micrometres (0.006-0.008 millimetres). Their tiny size 
and biconcave disc shape increase their surface-to-
volume ratio, enabling them to carry more oxygen.
DNA
If unravelled, the DNA in 
the average human body 
would stretch for a 
cumulative distance of 
over 74 billion kilometres.
Your DNA 
could stretch 
to the Sun and 
back nearly 
250 times!
Rapid replacement
Red blood cells are continually 
replaced and have a lifespan 
of between 100–120 days on 
average. Each second, 
approximately 2 million of 
them die and are replaced 
with new cells generated from 
the bone marrow.
Kidney filter tubes
Your blood is filtered through 
your kidneys around 40 
times each day to help rid 
the body of waste and toxins. 
In each kidney, around 1 
million tiny tubes called 
nephrons work as filters to 
help keep the blood clean.

Each double helix 
strand is wrapped around 
proteins called histones 
to form structures called 
nucleosomes, which 
under the microscope 
have the appearance of 
beads on a string. These 
nucleosomes coil up, 
further compressing the 
DNA molecule into 
compact fibres. The 
fibres are then tightly 
folded to produce the 
250-nanometre-wide 
fibres that make up 
chromosomes.
This arrangement is 
adjustable, so portions of 
DNA strands can 
effectively be opened up 
when the molecule needs 
to be ‘read’ during 
transcription or 
replication. Since these 
structural changes are 
reversible, the DNA 
reverts to its compact 
form when these 
processes are complete.

o mesmerised audiences below, tightrope 
walkers seem capable of performing 
impossible stunts. Even on the ground, 
without the distraction of being at a dizzying 
height, attempting to balance upon — let alone 
move across — such a thin rope seems 
incredibly dificult, but in fact it’s all just a 
matter of understanding the forces involved in 
balance and rotation. 
The body’s posture afects its centre of gravity: 
the point at which its mass is balanced in every 
direction. A lower centre of gravity improves 
stability; think of how a short, wide glass is 
harder to knock over than a tall, thin one. One 
way to lower this centre is to lean forward, but 
tilting the head interferes with the body’s 
vestibular system, the part of the inner ear 
responsible for balance. Instead, the best tactic 
is to keep the back and head as straight as 
possible while keeping the knees bent to lower 
the hips slightly.
Another factor walkers must consider is the 
rope’s tendency to rotate underfoot in response 
to their own movements. By holding out their 
arms, or holding a long balance pole, they can 
spread out the horizontal component of their 
mass. This increases their rotational inertia, 
which helps to resist the motion of the twisting 
rope and thereby improves stability.
Understanding the physics and using these 
principles to your advantage is one thing, but 
performing them at height is another thing 
entirely! Developing the conidence — and a 
head for heights — to perform wire walks 
between skyscrapers or across waterfalls takes 
many years of intensive training.
Why these death-defying feats rely on a keen 
understanding of physics and physiology

TENSION

WEIGHT
Centre of gravity
The point where the mass of a 
walker’s body balances out is usually 
near their waist. Bending the knees 
helps to lower this slightly.
Friction
Tightrope walkers’ footwear is 
typically leather or suede to 
increase friction between the 
shoes and the rope, improving 
grip. Flexible, thin-soled shoes 
also help walkers bend their feet 
around the rope.
Rotational inertia
Long balance poles increase the 
walker’s rotational inertia — a measure 
of how difficult it is to change an 
object’s rotational velocity around an 
axis. This enables the walker to resist 
the turning of the rope more easily.
Tension
How tense the rope is will affect 
how the walker can move across 
it. The more slack the rope, the 
more it will move with each step.
Vestibular system
Keeping good posture, with 
the head up and looking 
straight ahead, is important 
for the walker’s balance.
Safety line
A safety harness — loose enough 
to avoid impairing movement — 
can be used to fasten the walker 
and their pole to the wire in case 
of disaster. Some daredevil 
tightrope walkers don’t use any 
safety equipment at all!
Head for heights
Beyond the laws of physics, 
psychologically it takes focus, 
determination and years of practice 
for high-wire walkers to overcome 
the natural fear of great heights.

rohn’s is an inﬂammatory bowel disease 
that causes tissue destruction along the 
gastrointestinal tract, anywhere from 
the mouth to the anus.  This leads to a variety of 
nasty symptoms, such as abdominal pain, 
fatigue and unexplained weight loss. 
It’s referred to as an immune-related disorder, 
though it’s not strictly autoimmune because it 
isn’t the bodies’ own cells triggering a war 
against itself. Instead, it is thought that a 
combination of genetics, environmental factors 
and bacteria in the gut cause the abnormal 
immune response that attacks healthy cells of 
the gastrointestinal tract. Currently there is no 
cure for this disease, though diet and 
medication can help reduce ﬂare-ups.
How does this condition damage the digestive system?
Crohn’s disease
W
e all know that no two ﬁngerprints 
are identical, but new research is 
suggesting that your breath may 
be as unique as the patterns on the tips of 
your ﬁngers. 
When you breathe out, it’s not just CO2 
you’re releasing into the atmosphere; there 
are also leftover metabolites from all the 
processes that are required to keeping your 
body alive. Renato Zenobi at the Swiss 
Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich and 
his colleagues discovered breathprints by 
analysing the exhalations of 11 healthy 
individuals and found they remained stable 
over each day and over the course of the 
investigation (nine days). This means that 
although we already use breathalysers to 
test alcohol content, we could also 
potentially use them to detect a lot more. 
Your individual breathprint has a speciﬁc 
chemical pattern which is unique to you, so 
changes in it could indicate disease. Using a 
mass spectrometer (a device that separates 
molecules by mass) it is possible to map a 
patient’s unique breathprint, track changes 
and detect patterns that suggest there may 
be an underlying condition. 
The next stages of research will attempt to 
determine aspects of breathprints that are 
indicative of disease. This faster, cheaper 
and less invasive diagnostic method could 
replace blood tests, providing the molecules 
of interest are volatile and small enough to 
be passed from the blood into the alveoli of 
our lungs.
Could your breath be as 
unique as your ﬁngerprint?
Breath- 
prints
Although scientists don’t know exactly what causes Crohn’s, there is a growing 
body of research suggesting it might be caused by one of three mechanisms
The leading theories about Crohn’s
Your breath contains metabolites that 
could be used to diagnose disease
Autoimmune theory
This hypothesis proposes that a 
specific infectious agent does 
not exist, but impairment of the 
intestinal lining and the influence 
of gut bacteria can trigger an 
autoimmune response.
Immunodeficiency theory
This idea suggests that a defective 
process within the body’s innate 
immunity leads to compensatory 
responses, and that therapies 
should aim to boost immunity 
rather than suppress it.
Mycobacterial theory
This theory suggests that 
Mycobacterium avium 
paratuberculosis is a cause of 
Crohn’s. This pathogenic 
bacteria interferes with the 
immune signalling pathways 
as part of a survival strategy.
Inflammation
The areas most commonly affected by 
Crohn’s are the large intestine or the end 
of the small intestine.
Chronic condition
After its onset, Crohn’s is a life-long 
disease. Sufferers typically experience 
symptoms in phases, with flare-ups 
interspersed with periods of remission.
Pathogens
An impaired immune system makes it 
easier for pathogenic bacteria to colonise 
the intestinal walls and cause harm.

tucking the wheel underneath, while others 
turn the handlebars on their head. 
The trick is in the hinges and extending stems 
that support the frame. Diferent bikes use 
diferent hinge technology. For example, 
manufacturer DAHON employs an easy-to-use 
ViseGrip hinge, and a LockJaw hinge cuts the 
main frame in two as it swings at the centre. 
The Rolls-Royce of folding bikes, the 
Brompton, can fold down in under 20 seconds, 
making it a perfect city bike. Brompton models 
have been paving the way since 1975. Folding to 
just 58.5 centimetres tall, 56.5 centimetres long 
and 27 centimetres wide, the Brompton retains 
its structural integrity in a compact package. In 
order to avoid getting caught up with the folding 
frame, chains and gears remain in the centre of 
the bike. Folding both horizontally and 
vertically in four steps, the Brompton appears to 
completely collapse under its creative and 
innovative design.

FURLONG
This is an old English unit created to measure 
a standard length of ploughed furrow that 
could be cultivated by an ox without rest. The 
furlong is still used today to measure the 
distances run by racehorses.
1 FURLONG = 201.168 METRES
LEAGUE
The league has been used in many regions of 
the world, including ancient Rome, France 
and Spain. Introduced to England by the 
Normans, it was suggested to be the distance 
that could be walked in one hour. 
1 LEAGUE = APPROX 4.82KM
ROD
Also known as a ‘perch’ or ‘pole’, the rod 
derives from the old English word ‘rodd’. 
Originally used for measuring out agricultural 
distances, it is still used today in horticulture, 
particularly to measure the size of allotments.
1 ROD = 5.029 METRES
NAUTICAL MILE
This measurement is used by seafarers. 
Imagine if the Earth was cut in half at the 
equator, revealing a 360-degree circle. Each 
degree can be split into 60 ‘minutes’, or arcs. 
Travelling on water for one minute of latitude 
covers a distance of one nautical mile.
1 NAUTICAL MILE = 1,852 METRES
KLICK
A klick isn’t actually an unusual 
measurement – it’s just military slang for 
kilometre. It is said that the term derives from 
a form of measurement conducted during 
military treks, in which designated soldiers 
would count the paces of the troops, moving 
the gas regulator on their riles back by one 
mark every 100 metres. After ten marks they 
would reset the regulator – indicating 1,000 
metres – which would make a ‘click’ sound.

T
he Ford Mustang could be the most iconic 
sports car in the world. The history of this 
all-American classic vehicle started with 
the characteristic prototype – the 1962 Ford 
Mustang I. This original two-seater, with its 
sleek design and mid-sized engine, while 
sharing few design similarities with its 
descendents, would give rise to not only the irst 
generation of Mustangs but eventually an entire 
new class of car known as the ‘pony car’ –
distinctive, sporty coupes with long hoods and 
short rear decks. 
On the irst day of the Ford Mustang II’s release 
in 1964 around 22,000 Mustangs were sold, and 
over 1 million were on the road within the irst 18 
months of their production. From these humble 
beginnings came a further ive generations of 
the cars, the latest of which was unveiled in 
December 2013.
This year Ford announcement that this  
historic car will be seeing yet another facelift – 
one that will make it leaner and meaner than 
ever with the interior being inspired by an 
airplane cockpit; designed to ensure an 
exhilarating ride. Featuring a reproiled bonnet 
and tweaks to the engine and suspension, the 
latest Ford Mustang will be available in two 
models: one with a 2.3-litre Ecoboost engine and 
the other with a powerful V8 engine (additional 
to the EcoBoost engine). Additionally, two style 
options are ofered: a fastback or convertible, 
with four engine and transmission choices. 
 2018 will see the introduction of this new 
iconic car, a vehicle brimming with the 
characteristic charm of its predecessors.
Leaner and meaner, the new Ford Mustang marks another milestone in  
its track history of more than 50 years of continuous production

Mustang movie stars
The character and charm of the Ford Mustang quickly 
saw the cars make their way onto the big screen. The 
Mustang made its debut in Goldfinger, the Bond 
movie that quickly accelerated the car to star status. 
Since this first appearance, the classic car has been 
featured in films and TV shows more than 3,000 
times, from Transformers to Fast and Furious, and 
driven by stars including Will Smith and Steve 
McQueen. The vehicle has been so influential in the 
film industry that Ford honoured the legendary movie 
Bullitt by releasing the Mustang Bullitt on the 40th 
anniversary of its release.

arrow cobbled streets, vibrant colourful 
houses and rustic red roof tiles: Venice is 
known for its character and charm. Built 
on an archipelago in the Adriatic Sea, the 
romantic ambiance of the city is steeped in 
history and tradition from the marble palaces, 
ornate bridges and Venice’s iconic waterway 
transport: gondolas. These lat-bottomed boats, 
with a high point at each end, are operated with 
a rowing oar in a sculling motion. The gondolier 
stands facing the bow and rows with a forward 
stroke before executing a compensating 
backward stroke. 
The boats’ origins are lost to history, with the 
irst reference to them gliding the canals of 
Venice appearing in 1094. They didn’t resemble 
the iconic water vessel we know today and have 
undergone several changes to truly perfect the 
art of navigating low-hanging bridges and 
mud-lats. The 13th-century gondola had 12 oars, 
and by the 15th century the vessel had shrunk in 
size and gained a cabin (felze). 
Gondolas quickly became a status symbol, 
with owners adorning their boats in lavish silks 
and precious metals. In 1562, authorities 
introduced legislation that required all gondolas 
to be painted black. Such displays of grandeur 
were frowned upon by the religious community, 
so this measure was introduced to prevent 
unnecessary ostentatious displays of wealth. 
Gondola artisans were restricted to only 
including speciic decorations, a design tradition 
that still continues to this day. It is estimated 
approximately 10,000 gondolas graced the 
waterways during the 1600s. These were also 
accompanied by batellas, caorlinas, galleys and 
other boats. Today, there are only around 400 
licensed to work on the canals, and traditionally  
gondolier licenses and crafting methods were  
passed down from father to son. To date, there is 
only one oficial female gondolier.

Gondola construction
The gondolas of today adhere to strict construction 
requirements. They must be 35.6 feet long and 4.6 
feet wide (10.85 by 1.4 metres) and weigh 
approximately 700 kilograms, each custom built to 
the stature of its new owner. The traditional craft 
involves the manipulation of 280 handmade pieces. 
There are eight types of wood: lime, larch, oak, fir, 
mahogany, walnut, elm and cherry. The boat is built 
around a wooden template, starting with the bow 
and stern, before building up the flat bottom and ribs 
to support the frame. It’s a refined process, passed 
down from generations, taking a total of 
approximately 500 hours.
Gondoliers are obliged to 
wear strictly regulated 
clothing, of either a white 
sailor’s shirt or a striped shirt 
in red or navy, and a straw 
boater. In winter, they are 
permitted to wear a navy 
woollen reefer jacket
Remo
The rowing oar propels the boat 
in a sculling manner and acts as 
the rudder. The gondolier 
counteracts the spin of the boat 
by ending each stroke in the 
push in the shape of ‘J’ or ‘C’.

The gondolier rows and 
steers from the starboard 
side of the stern.

This oarlock is a piece of cured 
walnut wood attached to the 
stern of the boat that has been

various notches in which to 
place the oar depending on the 
type of rowing.

n October 2017, astronomers observed a bizarre 
body sweeping through our Solar System. Thought 
to be at least 400 metres long, asteroid 1I/2017 U1, 
otherwise known as ‘Oumuamua (Hawaiian for ‘a 
messenger from afar’) is the ﬁrst conﬁrmed object to 
have travelled to our star system from another. Before 
its chance encounter with our Sun’s gravitational pull, 
it is thought to have been travelling through 
interstellar space for millions of years.
While this was not a complete surprise to 
scientists – who had been anticipating the 
discovery of an interstellar object for decades 
– they had been expecting a comet rather than an 
asteroid. Given that most objects ejected from our 
Solar System are comets, it had been assumed that a 
higher ratio of comets to asteroids applied to other 
systems too, but perhaps this is not the case.
The most obvious oddity of this visitor is its shape. 
While ‘Oumuamua is the length of more than three 
football pitches, observations suggest it is just 40 
metres wide. Such elongation (a ratio of ten-to-one) has 
never been seen in objects within the Solar System; at 
most, objects are no more than three-times longer 
than they are wide. 
Structurally, however, the interstellar interloper is 
more familiar. It seems to be dense – possibly rocky or 
metallic – and lacks signiﬁcant amounts of water or ice, 
just like many asteroids found in our Solar System. As a 
result of exposure to cosmic rays for millions of years, 
its surface is slightly red from this irradiation.
Scientists do not currently understand how 
‘Oumuamua could have formed or how it has managed 
to maintain its unusual cigar-like shape. Figuring this 
out could reveal more about the distant solar system 
this interstellar traveller came from.

strometry is a branch of astronomy 
concerned with mapping the sky. 
Records show that it is one of the ﬁrst 
sciences and was practised by several early 
civilisations. Monitoring the movements of stars 
and planets served a practical purpose for 
ancient cultures, from tracking time to aiding 
navigation and timing rituals .
The ﬁrst astronomers could track visible 
celestial bodies and record their periodic 
motions, but it wasn’t until the third century 
BCE that attempts were made to estimate their 
distances using geometry.
The invention of the telescope in the 17th 
century led to an astronomy revolution. With an 
enhanced view of the universe, astronomers 
could collect more evidence to support the 
heliocentric model — the idea that the Sun, not 
the Earth, was at the centre of our Solar System. 
The telescope enabled much more detailed 
cataloguing of stars’ positions and distances.
The 19th and 20th centuries saw the 
development of more advanced telescopes, as 
well as photography, which improved the 
accuracy and detail of star charts. But Earth’s 
atmosphere interferes with measurements from 
the ground as it makes stars appear to ﬂicker. 
Since the advent of the space age in the 1950s, we 
have been able to launch telescopes into orbit, 
overcoming atmospheric interference to see 
further into the cosmos than ever before. 
ESA’s latest mission to chart the skies will rely 
on the space telescope Gaia, which is currently 
mapping the position, parallax and annual 
proper motion of about 1 billion stars. This will 
provide us with a three-dimensional map of our 
galaxy in unprecedented detail, as well as a 
new, deﬁnitive stellar catalogue, due to be 
published in the early 2020s.

Astrometry through the ages
How the accuracy of our star maps has improved over centuries of study
Greek astronomer Hipparchus 
compiled the oldest known stellar 
catalogue on record. He was able 
to map the positions of around 
850 stars to an accuracy of one 
degree using naked-eye 
observations and astronomical 
instruments such as astrolabes, 
gnomons and armillary spheres.
In 1838, Friedrich Bessel published 
the first reliable measurement of 
parallax: the changes in a star’s 
apparent location due to Earth’s 
changing position in its orbit 
through the year. In the late 1830s 
Wilhelm Struve and Thomas 
Henderson also achieved this, 
joining Bessel in successfully 
measuring the distances to stars.
Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe’s 
catalogue was completed in 1598 
and published in 1627. It contained 
the positions of around 1,000 
stars with an impressive precision 
of about one arcminute (1/60th of 
a degree) using large quadrants 
and sextants. 
American astronomer Frank 
Schlesinger used photographic 
plates to help measure the 
parallaxes of nearly 2,000 stars, 
publishing his catalogue in 1924. 
Louise Freeland Jenkins extended 
Schlesinger’s catalogue to around 
6,000 stars in 1952, and William 
van Altena brought the total to 
over 8,000 in 1995.
Timurid ruler and astronomer 
Ulugh Beg built a 36-metre-radius 
sextant in Samarkand (a city in 
modern-day Uzbekistan) to help 
measure angles in the sky. He 
created a catalogue of 994 stars, 
achieving slightly better accuracy 
than Hipparchus.
Dutch astronomer Jacobus 
Kapteyn was able to measure the 
parallax of several hundred stars 
thanks to the development of 
photography. Since the 1850s, 
the use of photographic 
astronomical observations has 
transformed astrometry and the 
way we study the skies. 
English astronomer John 
Flamsteed was the first 
astronomer to publish a stellar 
catalogue that was compiled with 
telescope observations. He 
charted almost 3,000 stars to 
within an accuracy of ten to 20 
arcseconds (one arcsecond = 
1/3600th of a degree).
The Hipparcos mission between 
1989 and 1993 collected data on 
the positions, parallax and proper 
motion of 117,955 stars to an 
accuracy of 0.001 arcseconds, 
probing star distances out to over 
300 lightyears. The data was 
published in the Hipparcos 
Catalogue in 1997.
French astronomer and writer 
Jérôme Lalande, who was director 
of the Paris Observatory, 
published a huge catalogue of 
around 50,000 stars. His 
measurements were precise to 
around three arcseconds.
Building on the legacy of 
Hipparcos, Gaia is currently 
mapping 1 billion stars, which is 
approximately one per cent of 
those in our galaxy. It will collect 
observations on each of its 1 
billion targets 70 time. For the 
brightest stars, Gaia will be able 
to measure down to an accuracy 
of 0.00001 arcseconds.

uch of the Red Planet remains a 
mystery to scientists. Around half the 
size of Earth, Mars shows signs of some 
similarities to our own planet. Both have an 
atmosphere, experience seasonal change and 
even have comparable polar ice caps. The 
biggest diference is the presence of life; well, as 
far as we understand so far.  
Several explorations by NASA’s rover 
technology have examined the possibility of life 
on Mars. Reaching its ive-year mark in August 
2017, Curiosity has spent over half a decade 
taking snapshots of the Red Planet’s surface, but 
now it’s time for a new rover to uncover the 
history of Mars.
Mars 2020 is a rover designed to do just that, as 
it will be equipped with an advanced set of 
‘eyes’. A total of 23 cameras make up the visual 
capability of the rover, which is due to launch in 
summer 2020. Divided into engineering, science 
and entry, descent and landing cameras, Mars 
2020 will be able to record as yet unseen sights. 
The goal of the mission is to seek signs of 
preserved life, or biosignatures, in Martian 
rocks; previous missions have conirmed Mars’ 
habitable conditions. Cameras aptly named 
SHERLOC and WATSON will use spectrometry to 
analyse the rock and reveal the story of Mars’ 
geology, as well as look for signs of previous life. 
This detective duo are just two of the many 
cameras on Mars 2020. Another of the rover’s 
impressive instruments is the SuperCam, which 
can ire its laser at a target beyond the reach of 
the rover’s mechanical arm to analyse its 
elemental composition. Mars 2020 will also be 
the irst rover designed to collect samples for 
retrieval, which would be brought back to Earth 
by a potential future mission.

ew Horizons scientists are preparing for 
the most distant lyby in the history of 
space exploration. On 17 July 2017, 
ground-based telescopes in a remote part of 
Argentina detected the momentary shadows of 
the Kuiper Belt object (KBO) 2014 MU69 passing 
in front of a distant star. MU69’s orbit is some 1.6 
billion kilometres beyond that of Pluto. This 
detection has provided vital information about 
the next destination of the New Horizons 
spacecraft and gives us a further understanding 
of the size, shape, orbit and environment 
surrounding MU69. 
These new observations have suggested that 
the target may not be a lone spherical object 
as originally thought, but more of a 
rugby ball shape. Or it could be two 
objects orbiting very close together 
or even touching. Marc Buie, the 
New Horizons co-investigator, is 
enthusiastic and curious about 
the new indings. “These exciting 
and puzzling results have already 
been key for our mission planning 
but also add to the mysteries 
surrounding this target leading into 
the New Horizons encounter with 
MU69, now less than [12] months away.”

enus is a hostile planet with a sufocating 
and crushing atmosphere, clouds of 
sulphuric acid and surface temperatures 
high enough to melt lead. Yet it is thought that 
the inferno planet may have been habitable for 
at least 2 billion years in its early history. And, 
though it’s not a very friendly place to live 
anymore, ancient Venus may have had water 
oceans among its volcanic formations.  
Entire oceans have disappeared without a 
trace, which had left scientists bafled until 
Venus’ electric winds were discovered by ESA’s 
Venus Express mission. These powerful winds 
are thought to be responsible for ‘pushing’ 
oxygen from the atmosphere out into space.  
Every planet has a gravitational ield, but it is 
now hypothesised that each planet with an 
atmosphere also has an electric ield. Venus has 
a substantial electric ield, but this was the irst 
time one had been measured at any planet. 
While gravity holds the atmosphere on the 
planet, the electric force pushes the upper layers 
of the atmosphere back towards space. 
This electric wind may also play an important 
role on Mars. NASA’s MAVEN mission is orbiting 
the Red Planet to solve the 4-billion-year-old 
mystery of where Mars’ atmosphere and oceans 
went. Understanding the role of electric wind 
may also help improve estimates of the size and 
location of habitable areas around other stars.

onger than a London bus and weighing 
more than four African elephants, 
humpback whales are true giants of the 
ocean. In the harsh conditions of the sea, 
humpbacks are anatomically adapted to life 
under the waves. As one of over ten baleen 
whale species, humpbacks have an interesting 
way of feeding. Within the whale’s mouth are 
around 600 baleen plates made from keratin, the 
same protein that forms our hair and nails. 
These plates, together with hairs, act like a sieve 
through which they ﬁlter their daily 
consumption of around one ton of plankton, 
ﬂushed in by the surrounding water. 
As one of the largest mammals on Earth, these 
whales ﬁll their lungs with air from a dual

and pressures of the deep ocean, in order to 
prevent damage to an air-ﬁlled lung, their 
ribcages can ﬂex. The same logic is applied to 
their eyesight. In order to see underwater, it’s 
thought that the whites of the whale’s eyes are 
thick and spongy to cope with ﬂuctuating 
pressures below the surface.
Beneath their blubber, which can be more 
than 40 centimetres thick after feeding all 
summer, lies a skeleton displaying unique signs 
of this whales’ land-based ancestors. Whales 
walked on land around 45 million years ago, and 
vestigial bones remain within their bodies, such 
as the pelvis. Its prehistoric role allowed for the 
movement of legs long gone in modern-day 
whales. Other telltale evolutionary remnants in 
humpback’s bodies are the ﬁnger bones within 
their pectoral ﬁns, which resemble hands.

Baleen
Humpbacks have hundreds 
of baleen plates in their 
upper jaws, enabling them 
to filter out tiny fish and 
plankton from the seawater.
Breach for the skies
Humpbacks can leap out the 
water as high as their own body 
length. These whales have been 
observed to be very acrobatic 
compared to other baleen 
species, performing various 
leaps, slaps and charges.
Blowholes
Baleen whales have two 
blowholes, while toothed whales 
have one. Blowholes are 
equivalent to our nostrils and 
are protected by a muscular flap 
that forms a watertight seal.
Expandable throat
The grooves around baleen 
whales’ throats are folds of 
skin that can expand to 
increase the volume of water 
gathered while filter feeding.
Humpbacks are well known for their  
love of cetacean surfacing  
behaviour, or breaching

Super strength
Powerful muscles 
enable humpbacks to 
accelerate to their top 
speed in just three or 
four pumps of their 
flukes (tail lobes).
Blubber
A thick layer of fat called 
blubber stores energy, 
increases buoyancy and 
helps keep the whale’s 
body warm. Unlike the 
fat on other mammals, 
blubber is vascularised, 
meaning blood can 
circulate through it.

A humpback’s elongated 
pectoral fins are the 
longest of any whale 
relative to body size. 
They can be up to 
one-third as long as its

amed after the Norwegian Antarctic 
explorer Carl Anton Larsen, Larsen C was 
previously the fourth largest ice shelf in 
the Antarctic Peninsula. But since 2014 
researchers had been monitoring this icy land 
mass after they noticed a crack appear and 
spread in the shelf. Then sometime between 
10-12 July 2017, the crack split the shelf. Named 
A68, this newly-formed iceberg weighs the same 
as a quarter of Wales, and its departure has 
reduced the size of Larsen C by about 10 per cent, 
dramatically reshaping the Antarctic Peninsula. 
This separation event has been described as a 
natural event that occurs on ice sheets, though 
some have suggested that climate change could 
be a contributing factor. As a natural process it is 
caused by normal temperature ﬂuctuations from 
the air and sea, warming the ice and allowing it 
to break away. A calving of this scale, however, is 
unusual and could be a sign of things to come for 
the entire shelf. Just as Larsen A and B did in 1995 
and 2002 respectively, C could be on its way to a 
complete melt down. 
Sea level rises have been a particular concern 
due to the sheer size of the break away iceberg. 
Even so, as the iceberg was already ﬂoating on 
the water before being calved, it doesn’t pose an 
immediate threat. However, glaciologists are 
continuing to monitor the falling ice from both 
Larsen and the iceberg.

ne of the simplest reasons a tree may 
shed its bark is because it grows from 
the inside out. Bark consists of several 
layers. The living inner tissue (the phloem) plays 
an important role in transporting organic 
molecules around the tree. The dead outer layers 
(known collectively as the periderm) help in 
reducing water loss and protect the wood from 
injury and disease, similar to the role of skin in 
humans. This dead layer is unable to expand, 
therefore as the inner wood grows, the outer 
layer of bark expands and cracks to make room 
for the new bark underneath. 
This process provides the tree with a number 
of ecological advantages; as old bark is lost, 
atmospheric 
pollutants, 
parasites and 
fungi are also 
removed, helping 
to keep the tree 
healthy. Similarly, 
climbing plants 
such as vines are not 
able to grow as high up 
the tree. 
Trees that shed their bark 
seem to do so more after hot weather, 
as the outer bark dries and shrinks, allowing it 
to peel away more easily.

eep in the rainforests of Central and 
South America live a unique group of 
amphibians. From above, these members 
of the Centrolenidae family look like many other 
species of frog that mostly reside high up in the 
canopy. However, view these curious animals 
from underneath and you will see what makes 
these small frogs so special. 
Glass frogs are so called because of the 
translucent skin that covers their stomach. The 
skin is so clear in some individuals that you can 
see the liver and intestines, and even the heart 
beating in their chest. The reason for this 
incredible feature still remains a mystery to 
scientists. One theory suggests it’s a type of 
camouﬂage; their silhouette, when illuminated 
from above, is less prominent to predators 
lurking below while sitting on a leaf. 
Unfortunately, glass frogs’ semi-
permeable skin makes them particularly 
vulnerable to environmental changes. 
Small rises in pollutants or toxins in  
their habitat can result in some areas in 
the rainforest being completely 
devoid of glass frogs. Thus, their 
presence in an area can be 
used as an indicator of a 
healthy ecosystem.

osses must be one of the most 
overlooked types of plant, but these 
tiny, non-ﬂowering organisms are one 
of the oldest land plants known to Earth. They 
are thought to have ﬁrst appeared in the 
Carboniferous period (around 358.9–298.9 
million years ago) of the Paleozoic era, long 
before the dinosaurs, and they have remained 
virtually unchanged. Their spectacular survival 
skills have allowed this primitive plant to 
prosper on the planet, with their characteristic 
endurance reminiscent of their aquatic ancestry. 
On Earth today there are approximately 12,000 
species of moss, typically seen thriving as green 
carpet-like mats across forest ﬂoors or sprawling 
around tree trunks. Instead of seeds, mosses 
have evolved tough spores to give rise to new 
plants. They also lack the normal structures 
associated with liquid transport (the xylem and 
phloem) and so cannot take substances up 
through their roots and have no way to move 
liquid around the plant. 
Instead, mosses rely on obtaining their water 
and nutrients directly by absorbing the 
resources into their leaves while using thread-
like rhizoids instead of roots to anchor 
themselves into the ground. This means that in 
order to thrive they need to be almost 
completely saturated in water. 
Mosses have a special trick up their sleeve 
when they ﬁnd themselves in unfavourable, hot 
conditions: they are able to almost completely 
halt their metabolism when stressed. By 
slowing their biological processes, they are able 
to wait patiently until water is available again 
and they can burst back into life.
How these ancient plants have thrived for millenia
Mighty moss
 
The many uses of moss
Mosses unique insulating and absorbing 
characteristics have meant we’ve relied on it in 
many parts of the world and throughout human 
history. Moss has been used for drinking water, 
decoration, food and shelter over the years. 
Otzi (the famous over 5,000-year-old 
preserved mummy found on the Austrian-Italian 
border) was found with large quantities of moss 
stuffed in this clothes, likely for insulation, but it 
could also be used as food packaging and even 
toilet roll. During World War I, Sphagnum mosses 
were used to dress wounds and stem bleeding 
from injuries and, if you’re severely dehydrated, 
you theoretically could wring them out and drink 
the water from it. Today, we continue to harvest 
moss for fuel and as a soil additive, and they 
continue to play a large role in smoking malt to 
produce Scotch whisky.

these plants is nothing 
short of a botanical marvel

2. Protonema 
development
The spore usually lands further 
away from the parent plants. 
When it rains the spore will 
burst into life and form a 
protonema that branches out 
like a network. 
5. Zygote formation
The embryo starts to form a 
long stalk that grows upwards, 
splitting the venter chamber 
and carrying half of it up into 
the air.
6. Sporophyte 
development
This results in a small diploid 
(containing two sets of 
chromosomes) plant called a 
sporophyte that is attached to 
the top of the female stem.

one end starts to grow into the 
parent plant’s stem to access 
nutrients and water.

HISTORY
I
n the Purbeck District of Dorset sits the 
remains of a castle built for royalty. Over 1,000 
years ago, a wooden skeleton of the future 
stone castle stood at the top of the hill next to the 
village of Corfe. Built by the Saxons, it is believed 
this earlier version of the castle was the location 
of the sinister murder of the boy-king Edward 
the Martyr by orders of his stepmother in 978 CE. 
It wasn’t until the 11th century that the castle 
would get a rock make over, rebuilt by William 
the Conquerer. King Henry I commissioned the 
construction of the castle’s inner bailey and 
keep, which took between eight and nine years 
to complete. Made from grey Purbeck limestone, 
it is one of the earliest examples of an enclosed 
castle, with the majority of examples 
constructed during the 13th and 14th centuries. 
The keep was surrounded by defence walls, 
which separated the inner and outer bailey by 
the 13th century during the reign of King Edward 
I. Royalty occupied this fortiﬁed base for around 
500 years before it was sold by Queen Elizabeth I 
to Sir Christopher Hatton, her Lord Chancellor, in 
1572. After passing hands again to the Lord Chief 
Justice, Sir John Bankes in 1635, the castle faced 
its ﬁnal siege. 
During the English Civil War, Oliver Cromwell 
ordered Parliamentarians to take control of the 
castle from a deﬁant Lady Bankes, who 
withstood a 48 day siege in 1645. Once in control, 
Cromwell’s soldiers dug holes packed with 
gunpowder, bringing the castle to its knees in an 
act of organised demolition.
Now in ruins, the castle once stood as a symbol of medieval might

Towers along the walls of the 
castle offered defensive 
support, housing murder

constructions usually required 
a human-made motte.

Reconstructing 
the ruins
Visualising a castle long lost in ruins 
can be troublesome, unless of course 
you digitally recreate it. Ciprian 
Selegean, a master’s graduate in 
computer animation from the 
University of Portsmouth, completed 
such a reconstruction. Selegean spent 
months researching the castle’s 
history and drawings to construct an 
animated alternative. Using several 
software programmes, 3D modelling 
and texturing, Selegean was able to 
produce CGI models of the castle as it 
would have looked 400 years ago.
Gatehouse
As the main entrance for 
the castle, gates were 
heavily guarded and 
doors dropped vertically 
for further protection. 
Bailey
These were courtyards separated 
from the surrounding land and 
village of Corfe. These spaces 
housed different buildings, 
including a Great Hall and chapel.
Ciprian Selegean created these 
digital reconstructions as a 
project for his masters degree 
in computer animation
Selegean began by creating a digital outline of the castle 
as it would have looked around four centuries ago
Colour and other geographical details were then added 
to bring the castle’s surroundings to life
Selegean then focused on specific sections of the castle, 
transforming them into these detailed recreations
The ruins are now in the hands of the 
National Trust, after being donated 
by the Bankes family in 1982

T
he London Tube map is iconic, but the 
original design was rejected for being too 
radical. Its designer, Harry Beck, was 
working as an electrical draughtsman for the 
Underground when he conceived this strikingly 
simple diagram. 
Before then, Tube lines had been laid out 
geographically over a road map of the city. The 
stations were a confusing cluster in the city 
centre and their routes twisted and turned. 
Beck’s design was much easier to read and  
could ﬁt on a pocket-sized pamphlet. He 
believed commuters didn’t care about the true 
distance between stations — they just wanted to 
know how to get from A to B. He was right. 
So, he new Tube map was given its ﬁrst full 
print run in 1933. Beck continued to update the 
diagram as new railway lines were added, and 
his ﬁnal version was published in 1960. While 
the creator is relatively unknown, his map has 
inspired similar designs in other major cities 
around the world.

ubbed ‘Portugal’s Stonehenge’, the 
Almendres Cromlech is estimated to be 
at least 2,000 years older than Britain’s 
ancient attraction. The site consists of more than 
90 stones arranged in two concentric circles, 
built in stages between 6000 and 4000 BCE. 
No one is certain of its original purpose, but 
many believe the megalithic monument was 
used to observe the night sky. That’s because the 
stones’ ﬁnal positions align with the spring and 
autumn equinox – when the days and nights are 
equal lengths. From the Almendres 
Cromlech, the Sun and Moon can be 
seen rising from the same point on 
the horizon, which suggests the 
site was used by primitive astronomers. 
Another theory is that the stones served 
religious purposes. Some of them bear carvings 
– serpents, crescent moons and even faces 
– leading some to believe they could be 
sculptures of ancient gods or deities. Whatever 
the reason or ritual, this is one of Europe’s oldest 
megalithic complexes and an ancient spectacle.

Over 12,000 Roman coins have been found in the Baths’ Sacred Spring
DID YOU KNOW? 
T
he city of Bath takes its name from an 
ancient Roman spa complex, which dates 
back around 2,000 years. Soon after 
invading Britain in 43 CE, the Romans 
discovered a natural hot spring near the River 
Avon in southwest England. Delighted to ind 
some warmth away from their Mediterranean 
climate, they attributed the spring to the work of 
Sulis, a local Celtic deity, which they identiied 
with their own goddess Minerva. They even 
later named the town Aquae Sulis, or ‘waters of 
Sulis’, in honour of the deity. 
The bathhouse was an important feature of 
any Roman settlement, providing a means to 
wash, relax and even socialise or conduct 
business. In Aquae Sulis, the Romans 
channelled the natural hot spring through a 
series of lead pipes. This provided warmth for 
visitors, who would navigate a series of rooms to 
receive diferent restorative treatments. 
A temple dedicated to Sulis Minerva was also 
constructed at the site, with an adjoined Sacred 
Spring into which more devout visitors would 
throw oferings. This fed water into the Great 
Bath, a large pool lined with 45 sheets of 
lead. Here, bathers would relax in the water at a 
comfortable 46 degrees Celsius. 
Over the centuries the original Roman 
structure fell into ruin, before new buildings 
and pools were developed on top of the old, 
which became forgotten. The supposed healthy, 
rejuvenating efect of drinking the water from 
the spring drew visitors from around the world, 
and in the 19th century the old Roman ruins 
were inally re-discovered. The Baths continue 
to attract around 1 million visitors each year.

The Roman Baths make use of over 
1 million litres of water that rises to 
the surface each day. This water 
emerges from deep underground at a 
temperature of around 46°C.

Royal patronage
For centuries royalty visited Bath 
for its supposed restorative waters, 
which were also thought to help with 
fertility. In 1687 Mary of Modena, King 
James II’s wife, was advised to take 
the waters at Bath to help her 
conceive an heir.

The water we see at the Baths 
today fell as rain on the Mendip Hills 
many hundreds or thousands of years 
ago. It travels deep through the Earth, 
before being heated and slowly rising 
again from the spring.

Iron Age origins
By the first centry CE, this part of 
Britain was home to an ancient tribe 
called the Dobunni, which are known 
to have inhabited the area around the 
Bath’s natural hot spring prior to the 
Roman invasion. 
Today the Roman Baths 
are part of a UNESCO 
World Heritage site
The opulent Grand Pump  
Room, an extension to the baths, 
was constructed in the 18th century

IN TIME
The first complex dates 
back to soon after the 
Romans arrived in 
Britain, though natives 
likely already knew 
about the spring.
70–80 CE
The Pump Room is opened, 
providing a comfortable 
place for travellers to relax 
and take the waters. It is 
replaced by the Grand 
Pump Room 80 years later.
1706
The King’s Bath is built 
on top of the old Roman

n  The distinctive smell of rain is a combination of plant 
oils, a compound secreted by soil-dwelling bacteria 
and ozone (O3). Damp air is particularly efective at 
carrying these organic compounds to our noses. Plants 
produce oils, which become airborne when it rains. 
Meanwhile, bacteria in the soil release a chemical 
called geosmin, a compound with an earthy scent. 
Falling raindrops stir up the soil, propelling geosmin 
into the air, which can be detected by the human nose 
at a concentration of  less than ive parts per trillion. 
Finally, lightning bolts can split oxygen and nitrogen 
molecules in the atmosphere, and these often 
rearrange to form nitric oxide (NO) and O3, which has a 
very sharp, chlorine-like tang to it. AFC

Danny Thomas
n  Yawning is thought to be 
the body’s method of cooling 
the brain to optimum 
working temperature. The  
stretching of our jaw 
increases the rate of blood 
ﬂow to the brain and 
inhaling air reduces the 
temperature of that blood 
ﬂow. The act of yawning can 
be contagious in social 
animals such as humans, 
primates and even dogs, and 
the reason for this is most 
likely related to empathy — 
our ability to understand 
and feel emotions. JS
Why is yawning 
sometimes contagious?
Which flowers are bees most 
attracted to? Tim Rowley
Although you might expect bees to prefer the 
brightest flowers in a garden, research shows 
that their favourites are actually aromatic 
plants, including oregano and certain types of 
lavender. These plants are a good source of 
pollen and nectar, of which the bees collect by 
perching on petals and inserting their 
proboscis into the flowers. KS
Why are dental records used 
to identify bodies? Harry Kinson
Teeth are tough and last much longer than soft 
tissues after people die. And, like fingerprints, 
everyone’s mouths are different. The shape of 
the teeth and jaw can tell us about a person’s 
age and sex, and unique characteristics like 
fillings, can help to identify them. LM
How do astronomers keep 
track of near-Earth objects? 
Florence Sole
They use something called a ‘charged couple 
device’, which takes pixelated images of the 
same patch of sky every few minutes. Then 
they compare the images to spot objects that 
have moved. LM
What does LCD stand for? 
Steve Moss
Electronic displays use liquid crystal molecules, 
which are able to adjust the amount of light to 
form the images we see displayed. So LCD 
stands for Liquid Crystal Display. TL
Yawning is more likely 
to be contagious for 
those with lots of 
empathy for others

n  Some species of bacteria are known as 
‘good’ because they help to keep us 
healthy. The human gut is actually home 
to a vast population of bacteria and other 
microorganisms, known as the ‘gut 
microbiota’. The bacteria help to break 
down food in the gut and ﬁght disease, so 
they are vital to our health. Your gut 
microbiota is inﬂuenced by your diet, 
lifestyle, environment and the use of 
antibiotics. Recent discoveries have  
suggested that a wide range of illnesses 
can be linked to disruptions to the gut 
microbiota, including allergies, diabetes 
and even cancer. KS

n  Breathability is a measure of how easily water vapour can 
move through a fabric. We cool down by sweating, and 
breathable fabrics allow evaporated liquid to circulate and 
escape. Whether a fabric is breathable depends on the ibre 
and the weave. Natural ibres, like cotton and linen, draw 
liquid away from the skin, whereas synthetics, like polyester, 
tend to repel water. Open weaves with lots of holes allow air to 
circulate, while tight structures stop the air low. LM

Marc Alonso
n  In the West, much of the superstition about

diferent superstitions about cats, and in 
some cultures black cats are actually seen as 
good luck. TL

Tom Wilson
n  Amateur meteorologists have recorded the weather 
for centuries, but it was only in the mid-1800s that this 
became oficial. In 1854 the British government set up 
the Meteorological Department, which later became 
the Met Ofice. Several other countries set up national 
weather services to record and forecast the weather in 
this time period too. The problem was that they used 
diferent methods, which only gradually became 
standardised, hence the Met Ofice today only has 
reliable weather records from 1914. However, by 
analysing historical records, ice cores, fossils and 
other sources, scientists can estimate the weather 
conditions far further back in time. TL

Thom Hartnett
n  Your stomach and intestines have 
muscles that push food, gas and liquid, 
through your digestive system. The 
rumbling sound occurs as food is 
squeezed by the muscles. When 
you have an almost empty

muscles to push along anything 
that’s left, causing the rumbling 
sound you hear. TL

Bruce Childs
n  First, the book needs to be typeset. 
The publisher chooses a font and 
converts the text into a long column of 
words called a galley. This is then 
proofread by editors before they are 
divided into pages. Then they make a 
high-quality printout called a camera 
copy, or mechanical. Each page is 
photographed and the negatives are 
stuck onto a sheet called a lat, or 
goldenrod. UV light is shone through 
the lats onto photo-sensitive paper to 
make blueprints. If the blueprints are 
ok, the negatives are then burnt into 
aluminium to make plates. These then 
go to the printing press and, inally, 
the pages are printed and bound. LM

Robot Wars: 
Build your

n Release date: Out now
Roboteers, stand by
But if you choose to dive in, there’s plenty of 
information to ensure that no stone is left 
unturned. From fact ﬁles about the show’s house 
robots (and how they work) to the basic parts 
required, assembly guides, safety tips and a 
substantial glossary of terms (considering just 
how much detail is involved, this is especially 
vital), it’s as if Haynes is determined that you 
bring to life your very own robotic Frankenstein.
Also intriguing is some of the information 
disclosed in this book. Ever wondered why more 
contestants didn’t try to take on Sir Killalot at his 
own nefarious game? Turns out that each one of 
his mobile drive pods weighed more than the 
maximum weight allowance for each 
competitor, so it really wouldn’t have been 
worth the risk.
But, even if you don’t get around to building 
your own robot after reading this, you will still 
glean a lot from this book, both in terms of 
acquired knowledge and appreciating the level 
of work that goes into all areas of the show. 
Welcome back, childhood.
H
ands up who is a massive fan of Robot 
Wars, the BBC’s mech mash-up that sees 
homemade metal monsters scrapping it 
out on the arena ﬂoor. Keep your hands up if you 
ever thought, ‘I want to make my own.’ Now, did 
you ever actually follow through? No? That’s 
okay, making a robot takes time and money and 
is unsurprisingly a lot harder than it looks.
Not content with regularly putting together the 
kind of concise, informative and lovingly 
presented handbooks that have become a staple 
of many a birthday or Christmas gift-giving 
session over the years, Haynes has turned its 
attentions to making your childhood dreams 
come true by releasing this very ﬁne guide to 
creating your own metal masterpiece. That’s 
right, you too can ﬁnally duke it out with the 
likes of Sir Killalot, Matilda, Shunt and Dead 
Metal — or see them spread your metal entrails 
across the arena.
Needless to say, nothing worth doing is ever 
easy, and while this book goes to great lengths to 
instruct you on the art of robot craftsmanship, 
this is no beginner’s guide. While it does hold 
your hand, a basic knowledge of what’s required 
is a must, and it’s worth bearing this in mind 
before you buy.

 The House Robots.
Shunt
Weight – 327kg
Weapons – A bulldozer bucket with 350kg 
lifting power, which is enough to launch 
competitors on to their backs to expose their 
vulnerable underbelly. Also a titanium axe that 
fires in less than quarter of a second and can 
penetrate some of the toughest armours around.
Armour – Hardox, a very tough wear-plate steel.
Shunt is the Robot Wars bruiser, who deals 
with competitors by brute force alone. Designed 
to take on the deadliest of spinners, Shunt’s 
bulldozer bucket tips over its victims so that his 
axe can fire at their underbelly. Shunt has caused 
some serious damage throughout the new era of 
Robot Wars, most notably immobilising Draven 
with a single hit through the titanium armour. He 
also caused a blaze by chopping straight through 
the batteries of Chopalot.
Being a robust, mean machine, the new 
incarnation of Shunt required a more industrial 
approach than the other House Robots. Shunt 
has a bulldozer bucket made of from very 
wear-resistant steel necessary to take big hits 
from the latest big spinner robots. The curved 
scoop required a hydraulic press providing an 
incredible 50 tonnes of force.
Dead Metal
Weight – 343kg.
Weapons – A 340kph saw blade mounted in 
Dead Metal’s retracting head. The jaws have 
300kg of gripping force and can engulf multiple 
competitor robots at within her 1.5m jaw width.
Armour – Tubular steel.
Dead Metal is a futuristic alien robot. She’s 
always on the hunt and loves circling next to 
the Fire Pit. Once she’s got hold of her victim 
in those powerful arms, there’s no escape from 
the saw! Dead Metal’s weapon is unique, in 
that it’s designed to melt through armour rather 
than cut. This means even the toughest of 
robots will suffer damage.
Dead Metal is a creature as much as she’s 
a machine. The body is made from various 
size tubes that were hand-crafted to give 
her an organic grown feel that’s not perfectly 
symmetrical. During the finals of Series 9, 
her jaws were damaged by the destructive 
vertical spinner of Aftershock, so for Series 
10 she was given a shiny new set of super-
tough pincers that hardly sustained a scratch 
throughout Series 10.

m With the cordless drills modified and ready 
you can now install them into the chassis. 
Using three jubilee clips per motor, secure 
the motors in place by looping the jubilee 
clips through the slots in the chassis. Ensure 
the drills are parallel before tightening the 
clips.
m Tighten the clip closest to the actuator first, 
again not too tightly to allow the drill a little 
movement.
m Then properly secure the handle of the drill 
and, finally, the jubilee clip closest to the drill 
chuck.
m With the flipper 
plate correctly 
bent to fit the side 
supports, you now 
need to use ten of 
the angle brackets 
and the M4 bolts 
to attach both 
side supports to 
the flipper plate. 
Take care to keep 
the flipper square 
and straight when 
fitting these, as it’s 
possible to add a 
twist to the frame 
if it isn’t done 
correctly.
m You’re now ready to start assembling the 
flipper. The first task is to fold the flipper arm to 
fit the flipper supports. Using the lines on the 
template, carefully bend the flipper plate whilst 
periodically offering it up to the flipper supports 
to check the correct angle is achieved. Take 
care to add the bend in the correct direction 
by ensuring the holes for mounting the plate to 
the hinge are the correct way around. These 
are not symmetrical, so if this isn’t checked the 
flipper won’t fit the robot.
m Now the flipper arm is assembled you can 
attach it to the robot. Firstly use the M6 
bolts to bolt the rear of the flipper arm to the 
hinge.
m Once in position use the second pin 
provided with the actuator mount to attach 
the actuator to the flipper arm. Secure the 
pin with the R clip provided. A tip is to use 
a battery to extend the actuator to make 
attaching the flipper arm to the robot as easy 
as possible.
m The next step is to add the hinge to the rear 
panel of your robot. Using the M6 bolts with 
washers either side and lock nuts, bolt the 
hinge to the inner side of the robot.
m Attach the second actuator bracket to the 
underside of the flipper arm using two M8 
bolts. Be careful with the orientation. The 
hole for the actuator is closest to the corner 
of the flipper.
m Using the template provided add a bend of 
approximately 45° to the flipper tip. This can 
be modified later to suit how close to the 
floor you’d like your flipper to run.

The impact that architectural 
engineers have on our lives is both 
obvious and understated in equal 
measure. Sure, the results of their 
handiwork are clear to see in the 
towering examples that represent 
some of the world’s most 
renowned buildings, but at the 
same time it doesn’t tell the story 
of the level of work that goes into 
them. Luckily, we have Built: The 
Hidden Stories Behind our 
Structures to do that job.
Penned by Roma Agrawal, most 
noted for designing the 
foundations and spire of The 
Shard, we’re presented with a tale 
as old as time; how have buildings 
have evolved from humble mud 
huts to some of the goliaths we see 
today and some of the feats that 
have been achieved to make this 
possible. Agrawal draws on her 
own experiences to great efect, 
with some of her own illustrations 
forming a backdrop to the points 
she makes. 
At one point she describes an 
engineer’s job as “plate-spinning”, 
which proves to be a massive 
understatement when you 
consider the level of responsibility 
and accountability involved, 
especially in light of certain 
disasters she brings up.
By framing this almost as a 
story, Agrawal ensures that the 
narrative is engaging and easy to 
follow and thus brings a high level 
of clarity to a potentially dense 
subject matter.

unnecessary amendments in the

often the stories are so fantastical 
— which is hardly their fault 
considering they don’t exactly hide 
their ictional nature — that they 
can get in the way of any actual 
science lessons, so it can feel like 
you’re not learning that much.

very enjoyable — fans will get a

there isn’t really much more to be 
gained from either watching the

book demonstrates that this is 
deinitely not the case. 
Citizen scientists are highly 
valuable members of the scientiic 
community, and make a huge 
diference to the projects they 
work on by sampling and 
reviewing data that would 
otherwise take scientists a great 
deal of time to get through. From 
astrology to zoology, there are 
millions of people without 
scientiic qualiications who are 
an integral part of our growing 
body of knowledge. 
Cooper brings the world of 
citizen science into view and tells 
the stories of the people who are 
getting involved. The citizen 
science movement is powered by 
the drive of individuals who want 
to discover, and Caren Cooper’s

ALONE

1 
Supercool your water 
 For this ﬁrst step you’ll need access to a freezer and a bottle of puriﬁed or 
ﬁltered water. You’ll have to ensure that the water is pure for this 
experiment, so use either sealed bottled water or tap water that’s been run 
through a home ﬁltering system and place it in a very clean bottle. Once 
you’re conﬁdent that your water is squeaky clean, go ahead and place it in 
the freezer.
3
Forge your tower 
 Once your bottled water has had time to supercool and the puddle 
in your dish has turned to ice, you’re ready to create your tower. Take 
both the ice platform and the bottled water from the freezer and place 
the dish in a large bowl. Now pour your water over the block of ice and 
watch as it crystallises and transforms into a tower! Keep pouring to see 
the tower grow higher.
2 
Prepare the platform 
 Now you need to leave the water to cool for around two and a half hours, 
but you can prepare the base of the tower while you wait. Find a small dish 
big enough to hold a small puddle of water. Ideally this should be made of 
metal — which gets nice and cold in the freezer — but any material that 
readily cools will do. Add some water straight from the tap and place the 
dish in the freezer.
4
Experiment with crystals 
 Amazingly, an ice tower isn’t the only way you can spontaneously 
form ice with supercooled water. For this next step you’re going to need 
some more puriﬁed water (cooled in the freezer), an ice cube and a clean, 
clear glass. Pour your bottled water into the glass and drop the ice cube 
inside. The water will almost instantly begin to freeze and form lots of 
small crystals.

Make a sticky 
note waterfall

How It Works  |  095
1 
Let’s get started 
 To begin this 
experiment, irst 
gather your required 
materials. You’ll need 
at least nine blue 
zigzag sticky pads, a 
reel of tape, a couple of 
mugs and a platform 
between 0.5 and one 
metre in height, such 
as a box or a table. You 
can use glue to stick the 
notes together. For the 
irst layer of your 
waterfall, arrange 
three sticky pads side 
by side, making sure 
all of the zigzags are 
running horizontally, 
and bind them with a 
strip of tape.
2
Bind the pads 
 Now that the irst layer is completed, repeat 
the same pattern with three new pads on top of 
the base layer. Make sure you attach the sticky 
bottom of the pads to the base so that the layers 
are attached, or add glue to strengthen the bond. 
Add another strip of tape across the top three 
pads and repeat the process. When you’ve used 
all of your pads, carefully lip the whole collection 
over and add a strip of tape across the bottom.
5
Test for impurities 
 Finally, try repeating the two experiments 
using less clean materials. To start, supercool one 
bottle of puriied water next to a bottle of water 
taken straight from the tap. What do you notice 
happening when you try supercooling the dirty 
water? Now take the puriied water and pour it 
into a dirty glass. What do you see? You may ind 
that crystals are forming on their own.
3
Enjoy the show 
 You’re now ready to run the waterfall. Move 
the pads to the top of your platform and place the 
two mugs so that they’re hugging its sides. This 
will help keep the waterfall falling in a nice, 
straight line. Now quickly lift the top sheet of 
sticky pads up and over onto the ground, then 
watch as the other sheets stream after them! You 
can repeat this experiment with diferent 
coloured pads, creating a rainbow waterfall!

In summary…
For water to form large shards of ice, the 
cooled molecules need solid pieces of 
debris to stick to. In puriﬁed water these 
tiny pieces are absent, but when we pour 
the water onto an ice cube, the cooled 
water can readily stick to the solid object 
and solidify, forming ice.
In summary…
The sticky note waterfall works mostly through gravity, which is quite similar to a regular 
waterfall. After the top sheet is pulled to the ground, gravity tugs the other sheets down. As 
the sheets are stuck together they are pulled over the edge in a ﬂowing sequence.

Detecting 
gravitons

n Dear HIW,
I have an idea about detecting a graviton. 
My idea is to have an environment where 
we think a graviton may appear equipped 
with particle detectors that can take 
pictures of the particles there. I am pretty 
sure that if a graviton does appear it would 
decay into smaller familiar particles, and if 
it does, I think it would decay into some 
low-energy particles. Now, I know that 
gravitons are extremely weak, so quantum 
computers should be used. How those 
quantum computers will work is that 
electrons will be fired into a box with an 
equal probability of landing anywhere. 
Each place that an electron could land on 
will represent a symbol. Different 
combinations of symbols will mean 
different things. Because there are a lot of 
places an electron could land on, just two 
electrons could have lots of possible 
combinations. But, if we use electrons with 
a superposition of spin up and spin down 
for the quantum computers, then the 
possible combinations of them would be 
just four. The quantum computers I’m 
planning to use to detect a graviton will be 
very powerful, so we might be able to 
detect a graviton.  
Andrei Banciu, aged 10
Thank you very much for such a 
brilliant letter. Now, as you are 
aware, gravitons, if they exist, are 
extremely difficult to detect, and 
our best chance of finding them is 
using an incredibly powerful 
experiment, such as the Large 
Hadron Collider (LHC). It’s thought 
that the graviton could decay in a 
few possible ways: either into two 
photons or two jets, or bursts of 
hadrons. Knowing where gravitons 
appear in order to put your idea to 
work is very tricky. However, given 
our detection of gravitational waves 
(which could be made up of these 
particles), researchers are thinking 
that the universe could actually 
serve as one big detector; bigger 
than the LHC and much more 
powerful than the quantum 
computer you suggested.
It’s thought that we could detect 
gravitons by looking for small 
changes, or fluctuations, in the 
cosmic background radiation, which 
is the radiation left over from the 
birth of the universe. It’s suspected 
that after the Big Bang the cosmos 
quickly underwent an ‘inflation’ 
phase, and it’s here that, if gravitons 
exist, they would be generated as 
‘quantum fluctuations’ during this 
rapid and dramatic growth.
Clearly, this is a new area of 
research, and it could be that there’s 
no chance of detecting the graviton 
this way. When hunting for the 
graviton, particle physicists use 
beams of protons – rather than the 
negatively charged electron – in the 
hopes of creating the region of 
empty space where the momentum 
and energy are out of balance and 
which could give away the presence 
of this elusive, massless particle.

Minty fresh
n Dear HIW, 
I have been a subscriber to How It Works 
for over two years and I have loved every 
issue. I was wondering, why does my mint 
shower gel make me cold? Thanks,
Henry Jalland, aged 16
Thanks for the question Henry! Mint 
contains menthol, which can really 
mess around with how you perceive 
temperature. Your nerves are telling 
your brain it is cold, when it’s not 
really because it triggers a protein 
called TRPM8 in your skin. This 
causes the cold receptors to 
become particularly sensitive and 
over fire. Nobody is sure why this 
happens, but it’s likely that the 
menthol ‘key’ just fits perfectly with 
the cellular ‘lock’. Thanks for the 
question Henry.
Boiling veg  
with bicarb
n Hello HIW, 
In your article on chemistry life hacks in 
October’s issue you mention keeping 
veggies green and you also have three 
bicarbonate of soda hacks. But the best 
way to keep veggies green, even if you boil 
them to death in true British style, is to add 
a bit of bicarb to the water. This keeps the 
pH up and stops the magnesium being 
displaced by hydrogen in the 
chlorophyll. Hey presto! 
Bright green cabbage.
Alice Bexon
That’s a great tip Alice! 
Bicarbonate of soda 
seems to have more 
uses than we realised. 
From baking bread to 
cleaning cutlery, the 
humble bicarb is a life 
hack essential!
