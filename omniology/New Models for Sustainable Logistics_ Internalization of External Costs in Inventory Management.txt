Preface 
Logistics of transport systems is a key driver for the growth of whatever economy. 
Freight transport allows production systems or common citizens to receive or send 
materials or finished goods required by processes as well as by everyday life 
However, the overall transport sector accounts worldwide for more than half of 
global liquid fossil fuels consumptions which, in turn, is responsible for a nearly 
quarter of the world’s energy-related CO2 emissions, more than 80 % of air 
pollution in the cities and about 1.3 million of fatal traffic accidents per year. 
Negative effects represent ‘external costs’ paid by unaware societies and modern 
economies. 
Costs of externalities account worldwide for more than 10 % of the GDP with an 
increasing trend. The European Environment Agency (EEA) and the United 
Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) defined the ‘Avoid-Shift-Improve’ 
(ASI) strategy to tackle the increasing of externalities while EU Commission 
(Directorate General for Mobility and Transport) established in 2011 a roadmap 
that will lead to the internalization of external costs within 2020. Research 
programs and strategic actions on sustainable development of smart cities are 
focusing on smart mobility of goods and citizens due to the relevant 
environmental, social and economic costs of logistics. 
Internalization of cost of externalities gives rise to new logistics cost estimates and 
functions which managers, researchers, lecturers and students should refer in 
facing with logistics issues. Under this purpose the present book has been 
conceived. 
The book focuses on freight transports of industrial production systems. The most 
used keywords are as follows: sustainable logistics, freight transport, 
internalization of external costs, environmental cost, social cost, inventory 
management, Economic Order Quantity—EOQ, logistics cost function, loss factor 
of transport, Sustainable Order Quantity—SOQ, transport means selection, 
stochastic variability of product demand, stochastic variability of supply lead time, 
sensitivity analysis, finished vehicle logistics, inland waterways, automotive 
supply chain, spare parts, repair policy. 
The book has been subdivided into three main parts, organized as introduced 
below. 
 
 
v 
activities. Passenger transport, both public and private, allow people saving time 
for their transfers and ensure high level of mobility. Materials and people journeys 
fulfill economy and society expectations. 

vi    Preface 
Chapter 1 provides a taxonomy of external cost figures as well as data set enabling 
the reader to perform reliable estimates of freight transport external costs. To this 
purpose, a full scale case study is developed. 
Chapter 2 describes a new sustainable inventory management model whose cost 
functions include externalities. The classical ‘Economic Order Quantity’ model is 
re-formulated and the new concept of Sustainable Order Quantity (SOQ) is 
defined. 
Finally, in Chap. 3 the SOQ model is formulated for different inventory 
management applications referred to both deterministic and stochastic production 
environments. Numerical examples are provided. 
We would like to thank our colleagues, both academics and professionals from 
service companies, our students, and the editors at Springer for their valuable and 
helpful support.

1 Internalization of External Costs of Freight 
Transport 
Abstract 
Accidents, global warming, congestion, air pollution and noise are examples of 
negative effects related to the transport activities that generate costs not fully 
borne by the transport users and hence not taken into account when they make a 
transport decision: these are the so called external costs. The internalization of the 
external costs of transport has been an important issue for transport research and 
policy development for many years worldwide. This Chapter, starting from an 
overview of the transport sector statistics and of transport external costs 
internalization in Europe, gives a taxonomy of the main transport external costs; 
moreover, the state of art on the cost estimation methodologies is briefly 
introduced. A case study from the finished vehicle logistics in the automotive 
sector is presented. Results show the potential external costs reduction due to the 
better environmental and social performance assured by the modal shift from 
road toward inland waterways transport. 
 
 
Keywords: Sustainable logistics, Freight transport, Internalization of external 
costs, Environmental cost, Social cost, Finished vehicle logistics, Inland 
waterways 
 
1.1 
Overview on the Transport System and the Legislative 
Context 
The transport sector, including the movement of people and goods by cars, trucks, 
trains, ships, airplanes, and other vehicles, is a key drive for the European Union 
Countries economic growth. It accounts for about the 5 % of the EU28 Gross 
Value Added (GVA) and employs about the 5 % of the total workforce in the 
EU28 [1]. In 2012, freight transport activities amounted to 3768 billion [t·km] 
while passenger transport ones to 6391 billion [p·km]. Figure 1.1 shows the 1995–
2012 data of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), of the freight transport and of the 
passenger transport in EU28 [1] (year 1995 values: 8012 billion [€] for the GDP, 
3.07 billion [t·km] for the freight transport and 5.37 billion [p·km] for the 
passenger transport).

1.1 Overview on the Transport System and the Legislative Context    3 
In this context it can be included the external costs internalization strategy. 
The European Commission focused the attention on the external costs of the 
transport for many years and, in 1995, defined the transport externalities as 
follows [3]: 
“Transport externalities refer to a situation in which a transport user either does 
not pay for the full costs (e.g. including the environmental, congestion or accident 
costs) of his/her transport activity or does not receive the full benefits from it.” 
The aim of the external costs internalization is the integration of these costs in 
the decision making process of the transport users [4]: 
 
directly: through, for example, command and control measures; 
 
indirectly: through market-based instruments providing the right 
incentives to the transport users such as, for example, taxes, charges and 
emission trading; 
 
by combinations of these basic types: for example, existing taxes and 
charges may be differentiated by the EURO emission classes of vehicles. 
The use of market-based instruments is generally regarded as the best strategy 
to limit the negative effects of the transport requiring, however, a detailed and 
reliable estimation of external costs. In order to better define the external costs it is 
important to highlight the difference between: 
 
social costs: reflect all costs occurring due to the provision and use of 
transport infrastructure (i.e. wear and tear costs of infrastructure, capital 
costs, congestion costs, accident costs, environmental costs); 
 
private (or internal costs): directly paid by the transport users (i.e. wear 
and tear and energy cost of vehicle use, own time loss costs, transport 
fares, and transport taxes and charges). 
As aforementioned, the European Commission has pointed out the objective to 
charge the vehicles for the external costs they generate since 1995 [3]. European 
Directive 1999/62/EC [5] (also called Eurovignette-Directive) and its amendment 
[6] are consistent with this goal. European Directive 1999/62/EC did not includ 
all the transport means but was limited to vehicle taxes, tolls and user charges 
imposed on heavy duty vehicles (HDVs) aiming at the harmonization of levy 
systems and at the establishment of a fair mechanism for charging the 
infrastructure costs on vehicles using them. The spatial scope of this directive was 
the Trans-European Transport Networks (TEN-T), a planned set of road, rail, air 
and water transport networks to improve the transport sector performance in the 
European Union. The Directive already recognized, in a general way, the 
possibility to address a certain amount of the toll revenues to environmental 
protection activities but the main destination of the tolls revenues was only the 
recovering of the infrastructure costs (costs of construction, operation and 
maintenance). By adopting only the user pays principle, this Directive failed in 
recognizing also the polluter pays principle: all road users were considered alike 
without considering for example the different congestion or pollution they caused. 

4    1 Internalization of External Costs of Freight Transport 
 
The internalization of the external cost is treated also in the EU White Paper in 
2011 [7]: this document comprises 40 initiatives to be actuated within 2020 in the 
EU. The ‘smart pricing and taxation’ initiative is divided into two phases. The first 
phase, up to 2016, expects to start with a mandatory infrastructure charging for 
HDVs and to proceed with the internalization of the external costs for all modes of 
transport. The second phase, from 2016 until 2020, expects to implement a full 
and mandatory external costs internalization for road and rail transport and to 
examine a mandatory internalization of the external costs on all European inland 
waterways network. The mandatory external costs internalization could also help 
achieving other objectives included in the White Paper such as shifting: (i) 30 % 
of road freight over 300 [km] to other modes such as rail or waterborne transport 
by 2030 and more than 50 % by 2050; (ii) the majority of medium-distance 
passenger transport from road to rail by 2050. 
 
1.2 
A Taxonomy of External Costs 
According to the most recent estimates, the total external costs of transport in the 
EU27 countries (with the exception of Malta and Cyprus but including Norway 
and Switzerland) in 2008 have been estimated at about 500 billion [€], excluding 
congestion, and at about 700 billion [€] including congestion. The GDP in EU27 
in 2008 was about 12.5 quadrillion [€]: the total impact of externalities amounted 
to 5–6 % of GDP. Fig. 1.2a shows that accidents, congestion, climate change and 
air pollution represent 86 % of total costs. Moreover (see Fig. 1.2b), the road 
sector generate 93 % of total external costs, rail accounts for 2 %, the aviation 
passenger sector 4 % (only continental flights), and inland waterways 0.3 % [8]. 
In the following, for each cost category, the type of cost figures considered and the 
methodologies for their estimation are pointed out. 
Furthermore, the spatial limitation to the TEN-T may cause a traffic shift towards 
not charged networks. In 2011, the Council adopted the new Eurovignette-
Directive [6] acting on all Member States’ motorways and not only on the TEN-T. 
Each Member State may define tolls composed of an infrastructure charge that 
considers also the negative effect of traffic congestion, and/or an external-cost 
charge related to traffic-based externalities (e.g.: air and noise pollutions). Only 
suggestions and not obligations are provided regarding the use of the revenue from 
infrastructure and external costs.

6    1 Internalization of External Costs of Freight Transport 
 
The concept of the Willingness To Pay (WTP) for safety is used to evaluate the 
first two cost elements focusing on the Value of a Statistical Life (VSL) [4]. The 
estimates on the VSL generally come from studies where participants to these 
studies quantify own WTP for the reduction of the accident risk. These estimates 
are different across countries, age groups and also differ from the risk analyzed: in 
fact, the expected number of life years lost differs among different risk cases. 
Several approaches could be adopted to quantify the share of the external costs 
in total accident costs taking into account what is already covered by the insurance 
of the person exposed to risk [4]. 
 
Climate Change Costs 
Climate Change (or Global Warming) impacts of transport are mainly related to 
the emissions of the greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane 
(CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). In the case of aviation, at high altitude, also other 
emissions (water vapor, sulfate, soot aerosols and nitrous oxides) have an impact 
on global warming. Several methodologies are available to estimate the climate 
change costs for the different transport modality: the state-of-art approach for 
evaluating this externality is the damage costs approach called Impact Pathway 
Approach (IPA) characterized by the following main steps: 
The damage cost approach and the abatement cost approach are the two main 
methodologies evaluating the cost of the GHG emissions [4]. The first one 
evaluates the total costs supposing that no efforts are taken to reduce the GHG 
emissions; the second one evaluates the costs of achieving a certain amount of 
emissions reduction. Between the two methodologies the abatement cost approach 
is preferred, although the damage cost approach is desirable from a scientific point 
of view; at the same time it is characterized by a high uncertainty mainly because 
it is not possible to identify and to evaluate many risks related to future climate 
change costs. The abatement costs approach mainly reflects the willingness-to 
pay, of a society, for a certain abatement level of the emissions. In the abatement 
costs evaluation, usually two different targets are considered in Europe: 
•
accident cost for the rest of the society (material costs, police and 
medical costs, output costs). 
•
quantification of the GHG emission factors, in [(CO2)eq] for different 
vehicles; 
•
valuation of climate change costs per tonne of [(CO2)eq]; 
•
calculation of the marginal climate change costs for different vehicle and 
fuel types.

to a cut of 20 % of GHG emissions compared to 1990 levels, “low 
scenario”); 
 

1.2 A Taxonomy of External Costs     7 
 
Congestion Costs 
The concept of congestion externalities is easily understandable but difficult to 
quantify. A road network user affects, by his/her decision to use a certain network 
for driving between two different destinations, the utility of all other users who 
want to use the same network. The utility loss, aggregated over all those other 
users, is the negative external effect of the respective user’s decision to move 
between the same destinations. The utility loss is translated into costs considering 
the willingness to pay for avoiding this utility loss. Thus, the external effect is 
measured in terms of a monetary amount per trip. 
The update of the unit values for congestion costs, suggested by the last 
“Handbook on the external costs” commissioned by the European Commission 
[4], is based on the aggregated approach of the FORGE model used in the 
National Transport Model of the United Kingdom [10]. 
 
Air Pollution Costs 
Air pollution costs are mainly due to the emission of air pollutants such as 
particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), 
ozone (O3) and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC). The following effects are 
related to this externality: 
The unit cost estimation of the air pollution for the different transport 
modalities follows the already mentioned Impact Pathway Approach aiming, in 
this case, at the quantification of the impact of the emissions on human health (the 
major effects), environment, economic activity, etc. [4]. The key steps of the IPA 
are the: 
2.
a longer term target for keeping concentration of CO2eq in the atmosphere 
below 450 [ppm] (thus keeping global temperature rise below 2 [°C] 
relative to pre-industrial levels [9], “high scenario”). 
•
health costs. Impacts on human health due to the aspiration of fine 
particles (PM2.5/PM10, other air pollutants). In addition, also Ozone 
(O3) has impacts on human health; 
•
building and material damages. Mainly two effects have the most 
impact: (1) soiling of building surfaces/facades mainly through 
particles and dust; (2) degradation on facades and materials through 
corrosive processes due to acid air pollutants like NOx and SO2; 
•
crop losses in agriculture and impacts on the biosphere. Acid 
deposition, ozone exposition and SO2 damage crops as well as forests 
and other ecosystems; 
•
costs for further damages for the ecosystem. Eutrophication and 
acidification due to the deposition of nitrogen oxides as well as 
contamination with heavy metals (from tire wear and tear) impact on 
soil and groundwater. 

8    1 Internalization of External Costs of Freight Transport 
 
 
determination of the burden of pollutants (e.g. by using vehicle emission 
factors); 
 
modeling of the dispersion of the pollutants around the source; 
 
exposure assessment to evaluate the risk of the population exposed to the 
defined burdens; 
 
evaluation of the impacts caused by the pollutants to the human health 
and to the environment; 
 
monetary quantification of each impact (this step is usually based on the 
willingness to pay for reduced health risks). 
 
Costs of Up and Downstream Processes 
This costs category considers the external costs generated by indirect effects 
(not related to the transport journey itself) such as the production of energy, 
vehicles and transport infrastructure. These costs occur also in other markets, such 
as the energy market, in addition to the transport one so it is important to consider 
the appropriate level of internalization within these markets. The most relevant 
cost categories considered in [4] are: 
 
energy production (well-to-tank emissions—WTT); 
 
vehicle production, maintenance and disposal; 
 
infrastructure construction, maintenance and disposal. 
The methodology adopted to calculate these costs is basically founded on the 
air pollution and climate change external costs estimation. The various studies 
treating this argument differ, among them, from the cost categories covered: for 
example some studies consider only the climate change costs of the up- and 
downstream processes whereas others also considers costs related to the air 
pollution costs. 
 
Noise Costs 
can affect their quality of life and health. The greater urbanization and the increase 
in traffic volumes are increasing the noise emissions. The two major negative 
impacts associated to this externality are: 
 
costs of annoyance: due to social disturbances of persons exposed to 
traffic noise which result in social and economic costs such as discomfort 
and pain suffering; 
 
health costs: noise level above 85 [dB(A)] can cause hearing damage 
while lower level (above 60 [dB(A)] may result in changing of heart beat 
frequency, increasing of blood pressure and hormonal changes. 
Furthermore, noise exposure can increase the risk of cardiovascular 
diseases and decrease the quality of sleep. 
Exposure to noise emissions from traffic causes not only disturbs to people but it 

     9 
The most used methodology to estimate the marginal noise external costs is 
the Impact Pathway Approach. The key steps of the IPA [11] are: 
 
level of noise emissions measured in terms of change in time, location, 
frequency, level and source of noise; 
 
noise dispersion models used to estimate the changes in the exposure to 
noise according geographical locations, and measured in dB(A) and noise 
level indication; 
 
Exposure-Response Functions (ERFs) showing a relationship between 
decibel levels and negative impacts of the noise; 
 
economic valuation techniques of the negative impacts of the noise 
identified; 
 
overall assessment to identify aggregated economic values taking into 
account all the negative impacts identified. 
 
Other External Costs 
The researches on the external costs, generally, focus only on the most 
important cost categories costs (such as air pollution costs, noise costs, climate 
costs or accident) neglecting other external costs categories. The reasons are 
mainly due to the complexity in the impact pattern and uncertainty in the valuation 
approaches. Methodologies for the calculation of these external costs are present 
only in few studies thus, presently, are not as sophisticated as for the most studied 
external costs categories [4]. The other external costs categories estimation 
considered are: costs for nature and landscape, cost to ensure water and soil 
quality, costs to ensure biodiversity losses, cost in urban areas (such as separation 
costs for pedestrian and costs of scarcity for non-motorized traffic).

 
Collection of new passenger cars registration statistics in 2013 for the 
European Countries. These statistics have been found in public 
databases and, for some Countries, contacting privately national 
statistics associations. The statistics are split by passenger cars model. 
 
Quantification of the new passenger cars flows from the assembly 
plants to the selected countries. The passenger cars distribution flows 
have been calculated by crossing the data collected in the previous 
steps. Each model assembled only in one plant (for example the Dacia 
Logan assembled only in the Romanian plant of Colibasi) provided 
quite certain information about the related distribution flows origin. In 
some cases, in 2013, a car model has been assembled in more than one 
plant (for example Audi A4 assembled in the German plants of 
Ingolstadt and Neckarsulm): it has been made the assumption that in 
each European country the 50 % of the Audi A4 flow came from 
Ingolstadt and 50 % from Neckarsulm. More accurate hypotheses 
have been made if available the total number of the cars assembled in 
the plants split by model. For example Opel Astra, in 2013, has been 
assembled in Gliwice (Poland), Rüsselsheim (Germany) and Bochum 
(Germany) plants, respectively 100,886, 58,547 and 16,339 units. The 
flows in this case have been split in proportion to the number of cars 
assembled in these three plants. 
 
1.3.1 Inland Waterway Transport (IWT) 
The European Union is characterized by a network of inland waterways of more 
than 40,000 [km] [1], 29,172 [km] of which have been earmarked by 
Governments as waterways of international importance [17]. The most important 
European waterways are located in the South-East corridor, East-West corridor, 
Rhine corridor and North-South corridor (Fig. 1.5). As aforementioned, inland 
waterway transport accounted in the EU28, in 2012, only for 4 % of freight 
transport based on tonne-kilometres [t⋅km] [1].

12    1 Internalization of External Costs of Freight Transport 
 
 
Fig. 1.5: Overview of European inland Waterways [18] 
Analyses conducted for the “business as usual” outlook for 2040 [19] show that 
the modal share of the Inland Waterway Transport (IWT) in Europe will not 
increase significantly. The high capacity for bulk transport offered by IWT is 
presently mainly exploited by the agricultural, metal and petroleum industry and 
in Western Europe by the hinterland transport of maritime containers. 
Opportunities to raise the modal share of the IWT could be found in the following 
market not widely exploited by this transport modality such as: 
 
paper industry; 
 
automotive industry; 
 
 
waste industry. 
One sector of the automotive industry with a huge potentiality for the IWT is the 
transport of the new passenger cars from the assembly plants to final customers. 
This market is, currently, not widely exploited in Europe where, however, since 
1997, one of the largest European automobile logistics service providers, 
transports new passenger cars on the Danube waterway. New passenger cars of 
Ford and Renault are transported on the Danube from Kelheim to Budapest and on 
the way back Suzuki cars are transported from Budapest to Kelheim. Every year, 
Suzuki transports about 18,000 vehicles on the Danube according to a regular 
schedule with two departures per week by two self-propelled vessels. The 
“Kelheim” and the “Heilbronn” (see Fig. 1.6) can load up 200–260 cars on three 
decks. The loading and unloading of the vehicles are carried out through a ramp 
installed at the bow of the ship, which can be lowered on the Ro-Ro ramp of the 
port [20].

turbines, wind turbines, etc.);

14    1 Internalization of External Costs of Freight Transport 

1.3 A Case Study from Automotive Industry Logistics    15 
1.3.2 Discussion 
A numerical example tried to quantify the potential external costs savings due to 
the IWT to transfer new passenger cars from four selected assembly plants located 
in Romania (2), Hungary (1) and Slovakia (1) to Germany, Netherlands and 
Belgium [23]. It has been assumed to unload: (1) in the Port of Rotterdam all the 
passenger cars directed to Belgium and Netherlands; (2) in the Port of Mainz the 
40 % of the new cars directed to Germany. The Marco Polo Calculator has been 
used for calculating the external costs of the transport. The European Union’s 
Marco Polo Programme [24] aims at shifting or avoiding freight transport off the 
road to other more environmentally friendly transport modes. This Programme, 
running by yearly calls for proposals, selects for financial support the proposals 
received depending on the level of the environmental and social benefits expected 
by them. The Marco Polo Calculator is a tool developed for the applicants of the 
Marco Polo Programme allowing comparing the monetized external cost impact. 
This calculator provides external costs estimates for road, rail, inland waterway 
and short sea shipping transport modes. In Table 1.2 the external costs coefficient 
used for the case study are shown [25].

Vessels propelled by Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) have been chosen to perform 
the case study among the many fuel technologies available for the inland 
waterway vessels. Table 1.3 shows an estimate of the reduction of CO2 and air 
pollutants (PM, SO2 and NOx) emissions comparing low sulphur fuel oil and four 
alternative fuel technologies [25]. 
Table 1.4 shows the flows of the new passenger cars, in 2013, from four selected 
assembly plants to different national markets (Belgium, Netherlands and 
Germany). 
Table 1.5 shows, instead, the external costs reduction of the multimodal transport 
(with road transport or rail transport as main haulage) compared to the direct road 
transport. In order to facilitate the comparison, post haulage has been neglected. 

16    1 Internalization of External Costs of Freight Transport 
Road and rail distances, for a given pre-haulage route, have been assumed to be 
equal and calculated using Google Maps [26] instead Ecotransit calculation tool 
[27] provided the river distances for the main-haulage route. 
Despite the river distance always more than 20 % longer respect to the direct road 
distance for all the selected routes, the multimodal transport with IWT as main 
haulage and rail transport as pre-haulage is the best solutions in terms of total 
external costs resulting in a cut of around the 80 % compared to direct road 
transport.

2 Sustainable Inventory Management 
Abstract 
The Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model, proposed by Harris in 1913, is 
one of the most studied models for the inventory management. The model aims at 
identifying the optimal lot size minimizing the total inventory costs, typically only 
holding and ordering costs. Many researchers extended this model trying to adapt 
it to real-life situation by providing new mathematical models. The increasing 
attention paid to sustainable manufacturing led, in the last years, to include the 
external costs of logistics in the EOQ model. Starting from a literature review on 
the inventory management models, this chapter defines the new Sustainable Order 
Quantity (SOQ) model. In the model, the loss factor parameter quantifies the loss 
in energy per unitary load transported and unitary distance covered, univocally 
identifying the various transport means. The optimal order quantity is derived 
minimizing a logistic cost function that considers both economic and social-
environmental costs. The model allows determining at the same time the reorder 
level, the safety stock as well as the optimal transport means.

Overview of the State of the Art 
The Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model [1] is one of the most investigated 
inventory management model aiming at identifying for a single inventory item its 
optimal lot size under the following hypothesis: 
(i) product demand constant over time; 
(ii) negligible supply lead time; 
(iii) unit production cost independent from the production quantity; 
(iv) zero-defective products; 
(v) fixed transport costs (implicitly considered in the ordering costs). 
Under these assumptions, the optimal order quantity is obtained as a trade-off 
between holding and order costs (Eq. 2.1).

(2.1) 
Starting from the work of Harris, many models have been developed including 
other cost figures in the optimization function. 
A first class of models explicitly considers transport costs in the EOQ model. 
In logistic systems these costs depend on the transport means adopted, as well as 
on the shipment size [2], and could weight upwards of 50 % of the total logistic 
costs. The transport costs are explicitly considered in [3]; these costs are also 
considered in [4] by adopting freight rate functions available in the scientific 
literature. In [2] an optimal solution procedure for solving the EOQ models is 
provided in case of transport costs are explicitly considered and shaped as all-unit-
discount costs. In [5] optimum lot-sizing algorithms in case of quantity and freight 
discounts are proposed: all-units and incremental discounts are considered. 
In a further class of models restrictive hypotheses of [1] are released. In [6] 
product quality problem is investigated, and the replacing of a random quantity of 
defective items is considered under an EOQ model. The effects on the inventory 
management of imperfect quality items are considered in [7]; in the model, the 
percentage of the imperfect items is characterized by a known probability density 
function assuming also that they can be used in another production/inventory 
context, generating less revenue than good quality ones. The model proposed in 
[8] extends this model taking into account the probability of failures in inspection 
activities. In [9, 10] an EOQ model under the hypothesis of exponentially 
decaying inventory and constant product demand is defined. Authors in [11] 
propose a model allowing evaluating the EOQ value in case of deteriorating items 
and permissible supply delay. 
 
2.2 Overview of the State of the Art
  

24    2 Sustainable Inventory Management  
 
The EOQ model proposed in [12] quantifies the increase in the optimal order 
quantity values due to the inflation effects on the prices; the effects of inflation 
uncertainty on inventory decisions are also investigated in [13]. Models including 
simultaneously inflation and deteriorating items effects are proposed in [14] and 
[15]. 
In [16, 17] the assumption of a deterministic demand is released, and the EOQ 
model is extended considering, respectively, the case of a price dependent demand 
and of a demand varying stochastically. Many contributions are available in which 
traditional EOQ model is applied under the hypothesis of stochastic variability of 
product demand; in case of uncertain product demand the safety stock sizing 
problem is integrated in the EOQ model. In [18] a model allowing obtaining 
optimal service level and safety stock level as a function of the ratio Q/x is 
proposed, where x is the standard deviation of the supply lead time. The 
evaluation of the optimal safety stock levels, through the EOQ model, of 
components assembled to obtain a finished product is proposed in [19]. The 
effects of partial backordering on EOQ solution in case of a variable product 
demand is evaluated in [20] by means of a deterministic inventory model: during 
stock out periods a fraction of the demand is backordered and the remaining 
fraction generates shortage costs. In [21] a solution procedure to compute EOQ in 
case of backordering is provided analyzing two different optimization problems, 
providing the optimal value of the maximum inventory level and the optimal value 
of the backorder level, respectively. The analysis of the potential benefits of 
Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI) implementation in EOQ model is proposed in 
[22]. 
Lead time variability is investigated in the model proposed in [23]: lead time is 
assumed as a decision variable obtaining its optimal value by means of 
minimizing crashing costs, defined as extra costs to be charged in order to reduce 
lead time. In [24] optimal lead time value, as well as order quantity and safety 
stock values are obtained in case of crashing lead time costs and price discounts of 
backorders. In [25] an algorithm aiming at solving the single vendor single buyer 
problem in case of stochastic variability of lead time demand and a lead time 
linearly varying is proposed. The EOQ model is applied in [26] considering 
stochastic variability of lead time and deterministic demand rate. In [27] optimal 
order quantity and reorder level values are obtained in case of random lead times 
by assuming that it is possible to obtain expediting orders (orders with a shorter-
than-average lead time at an extra cost). Methods to reduce supply lead time 
variability are analyzed in [28]: order splitting is identified as the optimal solution 
in case of a lot size-dependent supply lead time. The effect of reducing lead time 
variability on safety stock level, in case of a gamma distributed lead time, is 
investigated in [29]. Authors in [30] show how the reduction of lead time 
variability is more effective than the reduction of its expected value in case of a 
deterministic product demand. 
 

2.2 Overview of the State of the Art
  
25 
 
Sustainable inventory management is a quite new research field. The 
increasing attention paid to sustainable manufacturing led to the development of 
logistic models aiming at jointly minimizing internal and external costs of 
logistics. Many models are available in scientific literature mainly focusing on the 
reduction of the carbon footprint of logistic activities. Less frequently the other 
categories of the external costs are considered. Authors in [31] studied the 
environmental impact in the inventory problem considering the carbon emissions 
perishable goods. In [32] authors consider an environmental performance based 
green cost as a linear function of the production/order quantity in the economic 
production quantity (EPQ) model and in the economic order quantity (EOQ) 
model; results of a sensitivity analysis showed that for the two models the optimal 
quantity value is smaller than in the standard case when green costs are accounted. 
In [33] social and environmental costs have been included into the classical EOQ 
model. Authors included social aspects in term of working hours and considered 
five environmental approaches to account the carbon footprint: direct accounting 
(carbon footprint considered as an additional economic cost), carbon tax (applied 
by regulatory agencies), direct cap (imposed by regulatory agencies or 
alternatively by public awareness about green products), cap&trade (rewards for 
company emitting less than an allowed cap and penalization in the other case) and 
carbon offsets (investments made to reduce emissions such as efficient and 
renewable energy resources). Similar considerations are in [34], where authors 
show how the overall emissions across the supply chain can be significantly 
reduced in case of collaborative firms within the same supply chain. In [35] 
authors examined the impact of the emission trading mechanism in the inventory 
management. They considered greenhouse gas emissions due to transport and 
warehousing operations. In [36] authors presented an overview about the 
inventory management aspects causing environmental damages that are not 
analyzed in depth by the traditional inventory analysis such as packaging, waste 
and location of stores and proposed a model that includes into the classical EOQ 
model environmental impacts related to vehicles journeys and waste disposal. In 
[37] a two-level supply chain model is proposed to determine the optimal 
shipment size and the optimal number of shipments taking into account the CO2 
emission costs due to transport operations. The environmental costs are split into 
two terms: fixed (depending on the vehicle type, vehicle age and average speed) 
and variable costs (depending on the actual weight of the shipment). In [38] the 
classical EOQ model is extended in order to solve a multi-objective problem 
where the goal to be achieved is not only the minimization of the logistics costs, 
but also the reaching of environmental and social goals. In [39] authors provided 
actual external costs evaluations based on a wide analysis of international 
researches carried out on this topic; 13 categories of external costs generated by 
the transport means are considered and a sensitivity analysis shows how the 
distribution network configuration could be influenced by a variation of these 
costs. In [40] authors proposed a model aiming at extending the external costs 
analysis of the inventory management; results of a life cycle assessment of the 
due to the energy and fuel consumption in the transport and storage of

2.3 
The Loss Factor of Transport 
It is well known that if we want to move a load, we need to spend a certain 
amount of energy. This energy is partially transferred to the load, and partially lost 
due to the friction: the first amount could be theoretically regained but the latter 
have to be considered a pure loss, since there is no way to recover it. 
Considering the simple case of a load W pulled over a horizontal floor (see Fig. 
2.1a), it is possible to calculate the driving force F needed to move the load as: 
  
,
F
f W


 
(2.2) 
with f the coefficient of friction between the lower surface of the load and the 
floor. In the more general case, the total amount of energy required for transport 
the load W along a route of length L is: 
  
,

(2.3) 
where 
ΔEP and ΔEK are the differences between the initial and the final potential and 
kinetic energy of the load, respectively. In case of these differences are negligible, 
the amount of energy required is equal to F·L. Being F = f·W, it results 
 
.

When the load W is shifted for the distance L using two wheels of negligible 
weight (see Fig. 2.1b) a smaller amount of energy (E′) is required, due to the 
In [41] authors proposed a Sustainable Order Quantity allowing evaluating the 
sustainable order quantity jointly minimizing the logistic and the environmental 
costs, as well as to identify the proper transport means under deterministic demand 
and lead time; the SOQ model jointly solves the two problems by the adoption of 
the “loss factor”, a parameter which measures the loss in energy occurring during 
the shipping of materials by a given means of transport [42]. The global warming, 
the acidification and the tropospheric impacts are considered in the external costs 
function. In [43], authors adopted model in [41] in order to investigate the effects 
of different internalization strategies of external costs of transport on the optimal 
solution of the logistics problem. In [44] the model has been extended by 
considering a stochastic variability of the product demand. A further extension of 
the model in [41] is proposed in [45] by adding the environmental costs due to the 
spare parts repairing and purchasing. In [46] uncertain demand of repairable spare 
parts is considered. In [47] a stochastically variable lead time is considered, and 
the external costs due to the freight transport means as defined in European 
Commission commissioned studies on this issue are evaluate.

(2.5) 
It is not possible to easily apply Eq. (2.3) in real transport system in order to 
compute the exact amount of energy required for the transport, but it is possible to 
measure the amount of energy E required to transport a given load W along a route 
of given length L. 
The amount of energy required E depends on the transport means adopted. The 
ratio E/(W·L), has been defined in [42] as the loss factor of transport (f). The loss 
factor firstly appeared in scientific literature in [42] as a technical energy-related 
performance measure conceived for taxonomy purposes. By adopting available 
data on freight transport systems, the author [42] provides a f taxonomy of both 
continuous and discontinuous transport means (see Fig. 2.2). According to the 
Jonkers taxonomy, a given means of transport is characterized by an f value, 
which is an average measure for a given type of transport means.

A Sustainable Order Quantity (SOQ) Model 
The inventory management model proposed in this work extends the definition of 
the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) and defines a Sustainable Order Quantity 
(SOQ) as the order lot size jointly minimizing a logistics cost function L 
considering both logistics and external costs. By identifying with a proper loss 
factor f each transport means, it follows

2.4.1 Purchase and Ordering Costs 
With G the annual product requirements, in case no quantity discount are 
considered, the purchase costs of the items can be computed as the product of the 
annual amount (G) and the unit purchase cost. In absence of quantity discount, 
however, purchase costs do not affect the solution of the logistics problem. 
With G/Q the average number of ordering cycles in 1 year, the ordering cost is 
evaluated as:

2.4.2 Transport Costs 
Transport cost is the sum of the material handling and of the shipping costs. Many 
models are available in scientific literature allowing shaping the transport cost as a 
function of the transport distance for an assigned class of transport means [4, 50, 
51]. For a given transport means and transport distance, the cost of transport 
depends on both the shipment size [2] and the speed of the transport means [52, 
53]. In the model proposed, each transport means is identify by a proper loss 
factor value, which represents an average value of its specific energy 
consumption. As a consequence, for each means of transport an average 
characteristics speed value is considered. A single-modal transport is considered 
in the model. Multimodal option can be analyzed as an extension of the model 
proposed by considering the overall route length as the sequence of segments each 
operated by a different transport means. Finally, partially loaded transport means 
configurations are not considered. 
Under these assumptions, the unit transport cost (cT [€/t]) can be considered a 
function of the transport means adopted and of the transport distance:

2.4.3 Holding Costs 
The holding costs are evaluated by means of different functions in the three cases 
considered: 
(a) deterministic demand and lead time; 
(b) stochastic demand and constant lead time; 
(c) deterministic demand and stochastic lead time.

Stochastic variability of the product demand leads to stock-out events at a given 
service level (SL) (i.e. probability of no stock out). The adoption of safety stocks 
allows facing with stock-out events. In case of a safety stock is adopted, the 
holding costs are:

In the reference case of LT = E(LT) (see Fig. 2.5, and the thin line in Fig. 2.6), 
the average inventory level and the consumption time are respectively equal to: 
E(I) = 1/2·Q + SS, and CT = Q/D. In cases B and C the average inventory level is 
affected by the lead time variability in the next ordering cycle; in case C, the 
length of the ordering cycle is greater than Q/D. In Table 2.4 the expected 
inventory level, the consumption time, and the corresponding occurrence 
probability values in the three cases considered are illustrated. 
In case of high service level values (SL ≥ 0.90) the following considerations arise: 
 
the term [LT-LT*] assumes small values; 
 
the occurrence probability of case C is very small; 
 
the consumption time in case C can be approximated to Q/D; 
 
 
the expected inventory level E(I) in one ordering cycle is obtained as:

2.4.5 External Costs 
In the logistic cost function of the SOQ model (Eq. 2.7) costs of externalities are 
considered. As discussed in [40], different inventory management activities are 
responsible of environmental and social costs. The main contribution in terms of 
externalities has to be addressed to transport activities. Transports are responsible 
of environmental impacts, as well as of social damages. 
As far as concern environmental impacts of transport, the related external costs 
can be computed by adopting two different approaches. 
In [41, 44–46] the environmental costs (ΦE [€/year]) for a given freight 
transport means are modelled as a function of the loss factor as:

where: 
ES [MJ/tkm] is the energy consumption per functional unit transported; 
ei(f) [kgi,eq/tkm] are the environmental impacts (i = Global Warming, GW, 
Acidification Potential, AP, and Tropospheric Ozone Precursor Potential, TOPP1) 
of the emissions of the transport means adopted, expressed as mass of the 
equivalent i-th pollutant (i = (CO2)eq., (SO2)eq., NMVOCeq.) emitted per functional 
unit [tkm]; 
εi [€/kg] is the unit cost per impact category. 
Environmental impacts are evaluated as:

of transport, and ci,k [kgi,eq/ kgk] is the relative contribution (characterization 
factor) of the k-th burden to the i-th impact category. 
An alternative approach is the one adopted in [43, 47], where estimates of 
external costs of freight transport available in scientific literature [54, 55], and in 
EU official guidelines [56, 57] are assumed.

3 SOQ Model Formulations 
Abstract 
This Chapter, starting from the definition of the logistic cost function defined in 
Chap. 2, presents the Sustainable Order Quantity (SOQ) model formulation 
considering product demand and supply lead time firstly as deterministically 
known and then characterized by stochastic variability. In the stochastic problem, 
solution procedures are suggested for solving the SOQ problem. Five cases 
(numerical experiments and industrial full-scale) are presented to test the model. 
Sensitivity analyses are carried out varying costs, distances, and uncertainty of 
demand and lead time, thus showing the model capabilities and limitations. 
Finally, results are discussed and compared with classical EOQ solutions. 
 
Keywords: Sustainable Order Quantity (SOQ), Stochastic variability of 
product demand, Stochastic variability of supply lead time, Sensitivity analysis, 
Automotive supply chain, Spare parts, Repair policy 
3.1 
Deterministic Demand and Lead Time 
The following assumptions are assumed for the deterministic SOQ model 
formulation: 
 
In case of a deterministic demand and lead time, the total annual logistic cost 
function can be formulated as:

(3.1) 
The optimal values of loss factor (fOPT) and of the sustainable order quantity 
(SOQ) jointly minimizing the logistic and external costs can be obtained by 
solving problem (3.2): 
 
1. the annual demand is known; 
2. the item consumption rate is constant over the year and deterministically 
known (Q = G/H); 
3. transport is carried out by a single means of transport; 
4. the transport cost per order and the transport lead time depend on the transport 
means adopted for a given route; 
5. the supply lead time is calculated as the sum of transport time (TT) and the 
time required for the material handling, order management and quality control 
(TL); TL is assumed to be a fraction (k < 1) of TT; the transport speed is 
calculated from the free flow speed (vact) of different transport means as 
v = vact/(1 + k); the value of the supply lead time is: LT = L/v.

(3.2) 
In case of deterministic demand and supply lead time, stock out events do not 
occur. For this reason, in (3.1) shortage costs are not considered. Under the 
assumptions made, order quantity (Q) can be obtained as: 
 
.

(3.3) 
Parameter p is the ratio between the reorder level (r) and the order quantity (Q); 
it ranges in ]0; 1] interval. For a given value of the average transport speed, the 
corresponding minimum value of Q can be evaluated assuming p = 1 (r = Q). 
This value represents the minimum lot size avoiding the stock out when a means 
of transport (and consequently a given average transport speed) has been selected 
(see Fig. 3.1). 
Fig. 3.1 Lot size (Q) vs. transport speed (v)
By substituting Eq. (3.3) into Eq. (3.1), the annual logistic cost function is:

Starting from Eq. (3.4), a logistics, no-dimensional cost factor, FL, is defined by 
dividing the total annual costs by the constant value G·ch/2; this value represents 
the annual inventory cost occurring in a limited situation where the order quantity 
is equal to the annual requirement (G):

The general logistic optimization problem is finally defined as: 
 
 
(3.6) 
The reorder level is, usually, assumed by the logistics management based on 
the lead time required from the order emission to the inventory replenishment. In 
such circumstances, f is the only optimization variable in the problem (3.6) since p 
values are assigned. 
 
 
3.1.1 Environmental Costs 
 
As discussed in Sect. 2, there are many categories of externalities due to the 
transport. In this Section, the emissions of transport and its related costs are 
considered in the logistics cost function. In case environmental costs of transport 
are considered in Eq. (3.1), the logistic cost function is obtained by substituting 
Eq. (2.32) and ER = ESQmL in Eq. (3.5).

Starting from data in [1, 2] on specific energy consumption (Es), the 
corresponding loss factors values (f) and emission factors (ei) have been evaluated. 
Values obtained are in Table 3.1, where estimates of the transport speed adopted 
are also listed. Data adopted here are expressed in [€2009].

3.1 Deterministic Demand and Lead Time    49 
In case of p = 0.5 and ch = 5000 [€/t year], problem (3.6) has been solved for 
different L values (200–400–1000–2000 [km]). Results are in Fig. 3.3. As it can be 
observed, the optimal loss factor value (the loss factor which minimizes the global 
logistic function) decreases from about 0.6 to less than 0.1 with the increase of the 
route lengths from 200 [km] to over 1000 [km]. It can be concluded that in case of 
long route lengths, slow transport means, characterized by an average speed less 
than 50 [km/h], reveal a sustainable choice. In case of L > 500 [km], different 
transport means (rail: f = 0.035, or ships: f = 0.010) are characterized by 
approximately the same global logistic costs. On the contrary, in case of short 
distances (L < 500 [km]), a proper means of transport (tir < 7.5 [t]: f = 0.475, 
small tir < 3.5 [t]: f = 0.718) allows minimizing problem (3.11). Finally, it can be 
observed how transport by airplane (f = 0.989) does not represent a sustainable 
choice for any distance considered, since FL assumes the highest value for any 
route length. 
Fig. 3.3 FL values for different route lengths and f values 
As discussed above, the solution of problem (3.6) allows identifying the 
optimal loss factor value (fOPT) and hence the optimal transport means for a given 
transport distance L. Each transport means is characterized by a proper average 
transport speed v*(fOPT). 
By introducing v*(fOPT) in Eq. (3.3), the Sustainable Order Quantity, SOQ, 
minimizing the overall logistic cost function (Eq. 3.1), is obtained as:

LT evaluated on the basis of the average speed of the transport means selected 
(LT = L / v). 
As an example, in case of p = 0.5, the limit (allowed) values of the supply lead
time are listed in Table 3.4 for different route lengths (k = 0.5; ch = 5000 
[€/tyear]).

In case of no transport means available satisfies the above constraint, three 
strategies could be adopted. 
(a) Adoption of a different reorder level, that is of a different sub-optimal 
solution; generally, this entails an increase in the logistic costs as per Fig. 3.5a; in 
case of long transport distance (L > 500 [km], see Fig. 3.5b), however, negligible 
differences are observed; as an example, in case of L = 400 [km], the sub-optimal 
solution 4 satisfies the lead time constraint (LTALL < LT) with an increase of less 
than 1 % in the logistic costs, as per data in Table 3.4. 
(c) In the case that there is no faster means of transport available, in order to 
satisfy the time constraint a lower k value is required, that is material handling, 
order management, and the quality control time have to be reduced. Generally, 
low decreases in k are possible. 
 
 
 
(b) In case no sub-optimal solutions are available, a faster available means of 
transport has to be selected with the result of an increase in the logistic costs; as an 
example, in case of L = 300 [km], it is not possible to find a feasible solution (see 
Table 3.5). For p = 0.5, by adopting a means of transport that is faster than the one 
identified by the model (solution 3mod. in Table 3.6) it is possible to satisfy the 
time constraint (LTALL < LT), but this leads to an increase in the total logistic costs 
of about 30 %.

3.1.2 Environmental and Social Costs 
The main goal of the model application proposed in this Section is to evaluate how 
different internalization strategies can promote the shift from the adoption of 
transport means generating high external costs toward transport means 
characterized by better environmental and social performances. 
Starting from Eq. (3.1) and Eq. (3.3) and explicitly considering the order costs, 
the annual logistics cost function can be evaluated as:

Table 3.7 summarizes the unit external costs adopted in this Section: cost data 
for water, rail and road freight transport come from [3], cost data for air freight 
transport comes from [4]. Unit external costs of road transport are provided for 
both LDV (Light Duty Vehicles) category, with a GWR (Gross Weight Rate) less 
than 3.5 [t], and HDV (Heavy Duty Vehicles) category, with a GWR greater than 
3.5 [t]. The LCA category considers the up- and down processes external costs. 
Cost data have been updated to [€2013/t·km] values by means of discounting 
indexes available in [5].

Data in [8] on free flow vehicle speeds observed in UK in 2011 have been 
elaborated in order to obtain an average speed value for each truck category (see 
Table 3.9). The actual speed value (vACT) for each truck category has been 
obtained from observed data by weighing the values observed on the different 
road types (motorways, dual carriageways, single carriageways) with the 
corresponding observations number. The related average value of the transport 
speed has been obtained using a k factor of 0.5. 
Data on ships cruise speeds as in [7] have been adopted. For railroads and 
SOQ Model Formulations
aircraft transport means, a cruise speed of 70 [km/h] and 700 [km/h] have been 
assumed, respectively.

58    3 SOQ Model Formulations 
By relating the loss factor values of different transport means with their 
characteristic average speed in transport (obtained assuming k = 0.5), the data set 
in Table 3.8 has been obtained. Results of a regression analysis carried out on the 
data set showed that the relationship between the speed of transport and the loss 
factor value of the transport means adopted is best shaped by a quadratic function:

with k1 = 557.6; k2 = −150.4; k3 = 52.7 (R2 = 0.935). 
Starting from the data set in Table 3.8, average values of the loss factor for the 
different transport modalities have been evaluated. Values adopted are in Table 
3.10.

A regression analysis carried out on data in Table 3.7 led to evaluate 
parameters values of Eq. (3.14) as:  = −607.17,  = 979.22 (R2 = 0.9718). 
Table 3.11 summarizes the data set adopted for the numerical experiment. 
In order to evaluate the optimal transport means and the optimal lot-size value 
minimizing the logistics function FL, problem (3.6), considering also Eq. (3.3), has 
been solved. For each transport distance considered both the solution obtained in 
case of internalization of the whole external costs (FL,SUST in Table 3.12, SOQSUST 
in Table 3.13 and rSUST in Table 3.14) and the solution obtained in case of no 
internalization of external costs (FL,ECON in Table 3.12, SOQECON in the Table 
3.13and rECON in Table 3.14) are showed. In brackets, the optimal transport means 
is specified (IV = Inland Vessel, ET = Electric Train, SS = Sea Ship). 
The optimal lot size and the reorder level, according to the model defined, 
proved to be independent on the external costs. For each transport means, SOQ 
and r values depend only on the transport distance considered (see Table 3.15 and 
Table 3.16).

Sensitivity Analysis 
In order to evaluate the impact of different internalization strategies on specific 
logistics costs [€/kgkm], the problem (3.6) has been solved for different extra 
costs charged in the logistics costs function. Ten different internalization strategies 
have been considered, with a percentage of charged extra costs ranging between 
0 % and 200 % of the whole external costs (100 %-case values are in Table 3.7). 
The specific logistics cost is defined here as:

Starting from solutions obtained by the model, the increase of the specific logistics 
cost (compared with the base case of zero external costs charged) have been 
computed for each case. Values are in Table 3.17, where in brackets there is the 
optimal transport means identified by the model in each case.

The formulation of the SOQ model proposed in Sect. 3.1 allows identifying the 

3.2 Stochastic SOQ Model    67 
Usually, safety stock is sized searching for the trade-off between holding and 
shortage costs due to stock out events. In this Section, two extension of the SOQ 
model in case of stochastic variability of product demand and of supply lead time 
are discussed. Safety stock and shortage costs are considered in the logistics cost 
functions proposed. Analytical models provide order quantity, transport means 
and safety stock size allowing minimizing logistics and environmental costs in 
case of stochastic variability of product demand or of supply lead time. Results of 
the application of the models to a full scale case study from automotive industry 
are presented and discussed. 
 
3.2.1 Product Demand Uncertainty 
The following assumptions are assumed in defining the SOQ model in case of 
stochastic variability of the product demand: 
 
1. the expected annual demand (G) is known; 
2. the product demands in each time period, Di, are independent stochastic 
variables; 
3. in each i-th period of the lead time (LT), product demand is characterized by 
the same expected value and by the same standard deviation: 
 
E(D1) = E(D2) = … = E(DLT) = E(D) = G/H,

(LT), the same assumptions as in Sect. 3.1.1 are adopted. 
In case of a product demand varying stochastically, and environmental costs of 
transport considered, the logistic cost function (3.19) can be written as:

(3.27) 
In Eqs. (3.23)–(3.25) D* and 
are the maximum demand value of the i-th 
period and the maximum demand value on LT periods not causing a stock-out in 
that period and in LT periods, respectively. From Eq. (3.27) it is obtained: 
LT·D* = 
. 
The optimal values of loss factor (fOPT), order quantity (SOQ), and the 
corresponding values of the reorder level (r(fOPT)), and of the safety stock 
(SS(fOPT)) jointly minimizing the logistics and external costs can be obtained by 
solving problem (3.28) or the equivalent problem (3.29):

Starting from data provided by an Italian logistic company (see Table 3.22) 
transport costs have been modeled here as: 
 
 
(3.34) 
In Eq. (3.33), the transport cost for a single order (T, the terms in square 
bracket in Eq. 3.33) is obtained as the sum of the cost due to the number and the 
particular type of the Cargo Transport Unit (CTU), T,CTU, and the cost related to 
the covered distance and the mass of products transported,T,k: 
 
T = T,CTU + T,k 
(3.35) 
Both contributions have been shaped as a function of the loss factor value (f). 
In case of road transport, the CTU can be identified as the payload of the truck 
type considered. Results of a regression analysis carried out on the data provided 
by an Italian logistic company led to shape both contributions through exponential 
relationships (see Table 3.23):

The general logistic optimization problem (3.29) has been solved for different 
value of SL (90 %–95 %–99 %) and p (0.1 ÷ 0.9) in order to evaluate the effect of 
the demand variability. Different values of the distance L (200–400–1000 [km]) 
have been considered. The upper limit value for the parameter p, due to 
organizational constraints, has been assumed equal to 0.9 instead of 1.0. Results 
obtained are in Table 3.24.

The transport means with the highest capacity (the slowest ones) minimize 
logistical and environmental costs for each distance and service level considered 
even if the environmental costs are significantly lower than transport costs (10 %). 

74    3 SOQ Model Formulations 
For each distance considered L, as expected, the safety stock size (SS) increases 
with the increase of the service level (SL) fulfilled While for each SL value the SS 
size increases with L. 
For each distance considered, the service level (SL) differently influences the 
optimal order quantity. The optimal order quantity values (SOQ) decrease, with 
the increase of the service level, for low distances (L ≤ 400 [km]); in fact, in case 
of high SL, smaller order quantities lead to an increase in shortage costs (see Eq. 
3.22) lower than the corresponding decrease of the holding costs. 
The increase of the service level achieved does not affect the solution of the 
problem in terms of order quantity for high distances (L = 1000 [km]). In this 
case, in fact, holding costs are significantly higher than shortage costs: the 
minimum of the logistic cost function is therefore obtained for the lowest values 
of the order quantity adoptable (when p = 0.9) compliant with lead time 
constraints. 
A sensitivity analysis has been carried out varying the unit shortage cost cS 
(cS =  · ch, with  = 1, 2, 10) in order to evaluate the effect of the shortage costs 
on the solution of problem (3.28). 
The case of a unit shortage cost greater than the unit holding cost refers to low 
value-added products and high unit profit, as in case of mass production of high 
technology product. 
Results obtained in case of a distance equal to 200 [km] are in Table 3.25. 
In case of small transport distance, the solution of the problem is not affected 
by the unit shortage costs in terms of transport means selection since the optimal 
loss factor values does not change and is characteristic of the slowest and high-
capacity means of transport. On the contrary, with the increase of the unit shortage 
costs, higher optimal order quantities are obtained as solution of the logistics 
problem. The increase of the transport distances (L = 400 [km], 1000 [km]) leads 
to the same remarks: the effect of increasing unit shortage cost on the solution of 
(3.29) is similar to the one observed in case of a short transport distances. In this 
case the increase in the optimal order quantity with the increase of unit shortage 
cost is less severe if compared with the short distance case due to the higher 
transport cost.

3.2 Stochastic SOQ Model    77 
As already discussed in Sect. 2, in case of stochastic variability of the supply 
lead time (LT), three different situations may occur: 
(D) LT ≤ E(LT) 
 
(E) E(LT) < LT ≤ LT*  
(F) LT > LT*  
with LT* the maximum value of the supply lead time not causing a stock out 
event at a given service level (SL), and

78    3 SOQ Model Formulations 
Under the assumption of E(I)C = ½·Q (see Sect. 2), the expected inventory 
level E(I) in one ordering cycle can be computed as: 
 
 
(3.43) 
and the corresponding holding cost is: 
 
 
(3.44) 
In Eqs. (3.43) and (3.44), z is the standardized variable of the stochastic 
variable LT, and hence:

As far as concern shortage costs, they occur only in case C:

In the model, quadratic functions are adopted in order to shape the dependency 
of both the transport cost and the external cost of transport on loss factor values:

For an assigned set of (SL, cvLT, L) values, with LT = cvLT ·E(LT ), solving 
problem (3.29) the optimal values of loss factor (fOPT), order quantity (SOQ), 
reorder level (r(fOPT)), and of the safety stock (SS(fOPT)) are obtained.

Case Study 
The model has been applied to the case study discussed in Sect. 3.2.1 [9, 10]. 
Following the procedure above, the logistics problem (3.29) has been solved for 
PX product in site 1 (G = 9224 [unit/year], H = 3520 [h/year], D = 2.62 [unit/h]). 
Cost data in [€2013] have been considered (cH = 18.98 [€2013/unit·year], cS = 12.32 
[€2013/unit]). A unit order cost (cO) of 100 [€/order] has been assumed. The 
corresponding EOQ value is 312 [unit/order]. 
Loss factor and average speed of transport values as in Sect. 3.2.1 and unit 
external cost data of water, rail, road, and air freight transport as in Sect. 3.1.2 
([€2013/t·km]) have been adopted.
Parameter values adopted to evaluate unitary transport cost are in Table 3.27.

EOQ and SOQ Comparison (In Case of Deterministic Supply Lead Time) 
The hypothesis of deterministic supply lead time (cv = 0) allows to perform a 
preliminary comparison between results of the SOQ model proposed with those 
obtained by the traditional EOQ model [15]. 
The results obtained without considering cost of externalities (“econ.”) are 
compared with results obtained considering external costs (“sust.”) (Table 3.28). 
In the sustainable solution, a SOQ value greater than the EOQ value is 
identified as optimal choice for each transport distance considered. When the 
transport distance considered increases, the optimal loss factor values decrease 
both in case of economic and in case of sustainable solutions. As a consequence, 
in case of long transport distance higher reorder levels are required. For the 
sustainable solution, when compared with the economic one, slower transport 
means (and higher reorder levels) are identified as optimal choice. 
Finally, as expected, sustainable solutions are characterized by higher logistics 
cost function (FL) values than the corresponding ones in the economic case.

Evaluating the Effects of the Supply Lead Time Variability 
In case of a variable supply lead time, shortage costs affect solution of (3.29). 
Shortage costs depend on safety stock level (SS), which is a function of the lead
time variability and of the SL (see Eq. 3.52). In order to investigate the magnitude 
of the effects of the supply lead time variability on the solutions of the logistics 
problem (3.29), it has been solved for different values of the lead time variability 
(cv) and of the service level (SL). A negligible influence of the service level values 
on the solution of the logistics problem (fOPT, SOQ, r(fOPT)) has been observed. 
This is due to the small value of the unitary shortage cost (cS) considered. 

3.2 Stochastic SOQ Model    81 
As an example, results obtained in case of SL = 0.95 are in Table 3.29 and 
Table 3.30. Road transport is identified as optimal choice for each level of supply 
lead time variability considered in case of short transport distance (L = 200 [km]). 
Fast road transport means are solution of problem (3.29) when a high variability of 
the lead time is considered. They are solution of (3.29) for higher supply lead time 
variability value in case of long transport distance (L = 500–1000 [km]). 
Transport means characterized by better environmental performances (rail, ship) 
are the optimal choice in the other cases considered (see Table 3.29). Reorder 
level obtained (r(fOPT), see Table 3.30) are consistent with the loss factor values 
identified as optimal by means of (3.29): smaller reorder level can be adopted in 
case of faster transport means. In case of short transport distance and low 
variability of supply lead time, SOQ values higher than EOQ are observed. 
Furthermore, supply lead time variability weakly affects SOQ values observed. 
On the contrary, an increase in the supply lead time variability (and in the 
transport distance) leads to higher SS values (see Table 3.30). The effect of the 
supply lead time variability on total logistic costs (FL(fOPT.), see Table 3.30) 
proved to be dependent on the transport distance considered. In the two limit cases 
considered (cv = 0.00 and cv = 2.00, SL = 0.95) an increase in total annual costs 
of 5.5 %, 18.7 %, and 45.7 % is observed in case of a transport distance of 200 
[km], 500 [km], and 1000 [km], respectively (see Table 3.30).

3.2 Stochastic SOQ Model    83 
As showed in Table 3.31, the internalization of the external costs leads to 
identify as optimal choice slower transport means (3.29). As far as concern SOQ 
values, negligible differences have been observed in the solutions obtained in the 
two cases. 
A sensitive analysis has been carried in order to evaluate the effects of a 
change in the ordering cost on the solutions of (3.29). For this purpose, problem 
(3.29) has been solved considering other two unitary order cost values (10 
[€/order] and 200 [€/order]). Results obtained are in Table 3.32. Solutions 
obtained proved to be slightly affected by order cost values, except for SOQ 
values: with the increase of fixed order cost, higher values of SOQ minimize total 
logistic costs (see Table 3.32 and Table 3.29).

84    3 SOQ Model Formulations 
3.2.3 SOQ of Repairable Spare Parts with Uncertain Demand 
 
In this Section, the SOQ model is formulated in order to solve the single-product 
replenishment problem in case of a reparable spare parts inventory and a 
stochastic variability of the spare parts demand. In the logistic cost function both 
economic and environmental costs relating to repair and replacement of spare 
parts are considered. Environmental costs of the production of new parts and of 
the disposal of used ones are taken into account. The logistic cost function has 
been modified here in order to consider the effects on the logistics costs of the 
repair policy adopted. Repair policies considered differ for the percentage of spare 
parts repaired and not replaced. Results of a case study from the automotive 
components industry are presented and discussed. 
Although the SOQ model adopted here is similar to the one in Sect. 3.2.1, 
further notations (see Table 3.33) and assumptions (listed below) have been 
adopted in this Section.

The following assumptions are assumed in defining the SOQ model in case of 
stochastic variability of spare parts demand: 
  
1. the expected annual demand (G) is known; 
2. the product demands in each time period, Di, are independent stochastic 
variables; 
3. the supply lead time is evaluated as LT = L/v, with v the average speed in 
transport (see Sect. 3.2.1); 
4. in each i-th period of the lead time (LT), product demand is characterized 
by the same expected value and by the same standard deviation: 
E(D1) = E(D2) = … = E(DLT) = E(D) = G/H,

5. recovering processes are performed in house; 
6. the success rate in repairing activities (ψ) is deterministically known; it 
ranges in [0; 1]; 
7. repaired spare parts are stocked in the inventory; 
8. the amount of annual replaced items replaced cannot be null, since items 
cannot be repaired forever, they are subjected to obsolescence, and 
recovering processes are characterized by a success rate (χ) less than 
100 %; χ values in the range [0; χmax], with χmax < 1, have been 
considered.

Numerical Experiments 
Results of the application of the model to a full scale case study from the 
automotive components industry in case of spare parts demand varying 
stochastically [16] are in the following presented and discussed. 
Solutions of problem (3.73) have been obtained for different values of the 
transport distance (L), of the service level (SL), of the coefficient of variation of 
the demand (cv), and of the unit repair cost (cR). 
(3.72) 
Parameter values adopted in the numerical experiments are from [17], [18], and 
[19], are summarized in Table 3.34. 

3.2 Stochastic SOQ Model    89 
In order to evaluate the effect of the environmental costs on the solutions of the 
logistics problem, a preliminary comparison has been carried out with the 
traditional EOQ model [15]. In Table 3.35, solutions obtained from the EOQ 
model of Harris are compared with those obtained from (3.73) for different 
transport distance (L) and demand variability (cv), in case of χ = 0 and SL = 0.9.

In the case of a demand assumed as constant (cv = 0.0), the SOQ values 
obtained are higher than the corresponding EOQ values, since internal and 
external transport costs lead the SOQ model towards solutions characterized by 
higher order quantity values. 
At the same time, the effect of demand variability on the solution provided by 
the SOQ model is of different magnitude depending on the transport distance (L) 
considered. Demand variability does not affect the solution in terms of both 
transport means selection (f value is constant) and optimal order quantity in the 
case of low transport distance. Optimal order quantity values increase with the 

90    3 SOQ Model Formulations 
demand variability in the case of higher transport distances (L ≥ 500 [km]). 
Moreover, the increase of the SOQ is maximum for the longest distance 
considered (L = 1000 [km]). When a higher demand variability (cv) is considered, 
an increase in the SOQ values is observed. This is due to the influence of the 
shortage costs. For an assigned service level (SL), in fact, an increase of the 
demand variability (cv) leads to an increase in the number of stock out events in 
each ordering cycle (see Sect. 4.1). The annual shortage costs depend on the 
overall number of stock out events in the year, which in turn depends by both the 
number of stock out events per cycle and the number of the overall ordering cycles 
in the year. In case of high variability of the spare parts demand, the model 
identifies as optimal high SOQ values, since this leads to a reduction of the overall 
number of ordering cycle. 
The magnitude of the effect of the demand variability on the SOQ values is not 
the same for all the transport distances considered. In case of short transport 
distance (L = 200 [km]), demand variability does not affect SOQ values. This 
could be easily explained by considering the optimal loss factor values identified 
by the model and listed in Table 3.36: in case of short transport distance, fast 
transport means are identified as optimal choice. As a consequence, small lead 
time (LT) values are obtained, and the effect of the demand variability on SOQ 
values becomes negligible. 
The EOQ model does not consider the transport selection problem. For this 
reason, with the purpose to compare annual logistics costs of the solutions 
obtained by both the EOQ and the SOQ model, they have been computed, in case 
of the EOQ model solutions, by adopting the same transport means identified as 
optimal by the SOQ model. Total annual logistics costs of the SOQ model 
solutions are greater than the corresponding costs of the EOQ model solutions in 
all cases considered, because of the external costs considered in the first model. 
The differences observed increase with the increase in the demand variability due 
costs. 
Problem (3.73) has been solved for each SL, cv, cR, and χ values considered. As 
an example, the trends of the logistics cost factor (FL) vs. the loss factor (f) for the 
three transport distance (L) values considered in case of χ = 0.5, ψ = 0.9, 
SL = 0.95, cv = 0.1, cR = cN, and p = 0.5 are depicted in Fig. 3.13. As expected, 
the model identifies slow transport means as optimal choice when a long transport 
distance is considered, due to their good environmental performances. 
Results obtained from numerical experiments showed that the repair success 
rate (ψ) affects solution of (3.39) only in terms of total annual logistics costs in 
case of a deterministic spare parts demand, and that in case of an uncertain 
demand, the repair option is cost-effective only in case of a high repair success 
rate performed. Results obtained in case of a repair success rate (ψ) of 0.9 and a 
unit repair cost equal to the unit purchase cost (cR = cN) for different transport 
distance (L), demand variability level (cv), and service level (SL) are in Tables 
3.36–3.38.
