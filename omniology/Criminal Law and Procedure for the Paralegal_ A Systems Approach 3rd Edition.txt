PREFACE
Engaging students throughout the process of learning career competencies is the goal
of Criminal Law and Procedure for the Paralegal: A Systems Approach, Third Edition. Stu-
dents are challenged to enhance their legal reasoning, critical thinking, and problem-
solving skills by applying them to realistic case scenarios, analysis problems,
electronic and traditional research exercises, and to numerous drafting, interviewing,
discovery, and other typical paralegal tasks. The text also addresses the human ele-
ment in the practice of criminal law, including the accompanying rewards and pit-
falls.  Ethical concerns and relevant performance standards, so often related to the
human element, are generously covered in Chapter 2 and throughout the text.
This Third Edition has been meticulously revised. It is comprehensive and gen-
erously complemented with examples of actual cases that make concepts easy to
grasp and learning more interesting. Its relevancy is based not only on our own re-
search and experience, but also on the advice and experience of a number of parale-
gals working in the field, as well as colleagues in education and criminal law. For
professors, the text provides the opportunity for a variety of teaching approaches.
FEATURES OF THE TEXT
■
Ethical and Performance Standards for Criminal Justice Practice
Unique
among paralegal texts on criminal law is the coverage in Chapter 2 and sub-
sequent chapters on the ABA Standards and Model Rules relevant to the role
of prosecution, defense, judge, and paralegal.
■
State Law Applications
Students’ attention to the law and procedures of
their respective states is emphasized throughout the body of the text and in
specific assignments (the state Columbia). Federal law and procedure are
also highlighted.
■
Case Law
Precedent and illustrative cases are quoted in the text to empha-
size key principles of law and enhance legal reasoning. Numerous other
cases are cited as examples to reinforce key concepts, illustrate variations in
statutes and court interpretations, and stimulate inquiry and problem solv-
ing. Case citations are not included in the text but are compiled in the Table
of Cases in the front of the text.
■
Sample Practice Forms and Checklists
Many practice forms, pleadings,
motions, and other documents are included to provide familiarity with
xxxv

forms and to give a basis from which to work with state forms or to draft
forms. Checklists give step-by-step guidance in specific practice situations
and provide examples for developing additional checklists as needed.
■
Graphs, Diagrams, Tables, and Charts
Visual aids facilitate learning, stim-
ulate interest, and summarize and organize important information. Space is
provided in exhibits for the addition of state-specific information.
■
Sample Jury Instructions
Jury instructions are an excellent resource for le-
gal definitions and elements of crimes. Samples are included throughout the
text to illustrate elements of crimes, for comparisons with your state instruc-
tions, and as a resource in research and drafting assignments.
■
Legal Terminology and Spanish Equivalents
Key legal terms are high-
lighted in bold and defined in the text as well as in the margins for quick ac-
cess. They also are listed at the end of each chapter and in the Glossary at
the end of the text. Appendix A is a glossary of Spanish equivalents for im-
portant legal terms.
■
Notable Quotations
Quotations related to criminal law appear in the text
and in the margins to emphasize ideas and provoke thought and discussion
(and maybe a smile) about the subject matter.
■
Helpful Web sites
Relevant criminal law and related Web sites are in-
cluded at the end of each chapter.
■
Application of Knowledge
Each chapter, according to its focus, contains
a varying balance of exercises for in-class or out-of-class assignments and
discussions.
Analysis problems throughout the chapters present legal issues, social
concerns, or other problems to stimulate critical thinking and analysis.
System folder assignments structure the building of an impressive prac-
tice system of topically arranged forms, legal principles, rules, checklists,
and other material. An outline of the system folder contents is in Appendix
B. Practical time restraints may dictate that some or all of the summaries or
outlines of the law and rules referred to in the system folder assignments be
reduced to short lists of citations to applicable statutes, rules, and cases. Ref-
erences to pertinent pages in the text can be a useful time-saver for students
intending to keep the text.
Application assignments require the application of legal principles to
new fact situations or to practice skills in research and writing.
Internet exercises encourage familiarity with electronic research.
Study and review questions are deliberately comprehensive to provide a
method of learning and reviewing important material for the student. In-
structors can use the study questions as a pre- or posttest, and students can
use them as a study guide for exams.

ABOUT THE AUTHORS
James W. H. McCord earned his law degree at the University of Wisconsin-Madison
and practiced criminal law before becoming the director of paralegal programs at
Eastern Kentucky University. He has served as president of the American Association
for Paralegal Education and as a member of the American Bar Association Commis-
sion on Approval of Legal Assistant Programs. He is the author of The Litigation Para-
legal: A Systems Approach, also published by Thomson Delmar Learning.
Sandra L. McCord earned her M.A. in comparative literature at the University of Wis-
consin-Madison, has taught English composition at Eastern Kentucky University, and

The authors’ experience with criminal law, teaching, and writing combine to make
this a particularly clear and readable textbook. Whereas most criminal law texts are
general in focus, this one was written specifically to prepare paralegals to work in the
field of criminal law.

INTRODUCTION
Criminal law is the branch of law that identifies conduct subject to prosecution and
penalty by the state, and the procedure by which it is carried out. Its purpose, broadly
speaking, is to protect individuals and society from harmful conduct by punishing
those who engage in it. An entire system has been established to implement criminal
law. Paralegals are employed throughout that system, primarily by prosecutors, de-
fense attorneys, judges, juvenile services offices, prisons, investigative services, a va-
riety of police and law enforcement agencies, environmental enforcement, social
services, and other administrative agencies.
II.
OVERVIEW OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM
A.
RULE OF LAW
Criminal law is one component of a larger legal system: the system of the federal gov-
ernment, its territories, and the governments of each of the fifty states and their sub-
divisions (counties, parishes, townships, and municipal corporations). Underlying
the formation of the legal system is the belief that society works best when citizens
are subject to the rule of law, the principle that all people and organizations, both gov-
ernmental and private, in a nation or state must obey the established laws rather than
be above the law or conduct their lives and business any way they choose. This pre-
eminence of law is expressed in the phrase, “a government of laws and not men,”
which includes the idea that those who govern are also bound by laws and may not
rule by whim. Pursuant to this most fundamental of principles of government, the
founders of our nation established the Constitution of the United States.
B.
THE CONSTITUTION
The Constitution and laws of the United States comprise the “supreme Law of the
Land; and the judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any thing in the Consti-
tution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding” [Article VI, clause 2,
United States Constitution]. Clause 3 of Article VI requires all government officials,
state and federal, to be bound “by oath or affirmation” to support the Constitution.
The governmental structure of the United States as set out in the Constitution,
federalism, is the relationship between the national government and each state, and
the relationship among states. In this legal network, the United States Constitution
and federal laws reign supreme. State constitutions and laws and the conduct of state
officials must comply with Article VI of the U.S. Constitution. The federal govern-
ment is limited by the Constitution to certain, significant powers (authority). Those
powers relevant to criminal law include the power to punish counterfeiters, to pun-
ish piracy and crimes on the high seas, to regulate interstate and foreign commerce,
and to make all laws necessary and proper for the federal government to exercise the
powers specified in the Constitution. The last two broad powers, the regulation of in-
terstate commerce and the enactment of laws necessary and proper, impact most im-
portantly on the creation of a body of federal criminal law. Other federal crimes
extend to violations related to civil rights, the military, the mail, and immigration and
naturalization.
All powers not specifically vested in the federal government or prohibited to the
states by the Constitution “are reserved to the States . . . or to the people” by the Tenth
Amendment. Subject to the Constitution, each state is a sovereign entity with its own
constitution, its own governmental bodies, and its own laws. Because the federal gov-
ernment enacts laws pursuant only to the powers specifically enumerated, most crim-
inal law and the execution of it exists at the state level. Should there be a conflict
between a federal and state law, the federal law prevails. If a specific federal law, how-
federalism:
the relationship between the
national government and
each state, and the relation-
ship among states.

ever, is the same as a specific state law, then both laws are in effect and a person can
be prosecuted under each respective law by the enacting governmental entity. A con-
siderable body of law has evolved to define where federal authority ends and states
rights begin.
Federalism also encompasses the relationship among states. Article IV of the Con-
stitution dictates that each state, under the full faith and credit clause, shall recognize
the acts, records, and judicial proceedings of another state. More specifically, a person
accused of a crime in one state and captured in another state shall, on proper request,
be returned to the state where the crime was committed.
In 1868, in the aftermath of the Civil War and slavery, the Fourteenth Amendment
was added to the United States Constitution.
AMENDMENT XIV
Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the
jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they
reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or
immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of
life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its
jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. [Emphasis added]
As a general principle, this amendment ensured that the constitutional rights and lib-
erties of all citizens could not be violated by the states. In the 1960s and 1970s nearly
every right or protection enumerated in the Bill of Rights was “selectively incorpo-
rated” as a “fundamental right” into the Fourteenth Amendment by Supreme Court
decisions. The exceptions include the Fifth Amendment right to prosecution by in-
dictment, which was held not to be a fundamental right; the Sixth Amendment right
to a jury from the state and district where the crime was committed; and the Eighth
Amendment protections against excessive bail and excessive fines, which are thought
to be fundamental rights, but that issue has not been definitively decided by the Court.
C.
SEPARATION OF POWERS
The federal government and each state government is divided into three branches:
the legislative, executive, and judicial. The doctrine of separation of powers delin-
eates and limits these branches so that they can act as checks and balances to each
other. In the criminal law context, the legislative branch enacts laws, the executive
branch administers and executes the law, and the judicial branch decides disputes
about the law and in that process interprets the law. Checks and balances keep one
branch from encroaching on the others or becoming too powerful. Thus, the executive
branch (president, governor, or mayor) has the power to veto laws; the legislature has
the power to allocate money for the operation of the executive and judicial branches
and to appoint some officials in the other two branches; and the judicial branch has
the power to strike down unconstitutional laws and acts of the other two branches.
Since Marbury v. Madison (1803) any law passed by the Congress of the United
States must be fair and not abridge any provision of the Constitution (including the
Bill of Rights). This landmark case established the concept of judicial review, the in-
tention of the drafters of the Constitution that all statutes must fall within constitu-
tional standards, and, if they do not, the courts of the United States have the right and
obligation to declare the law unconstitutional. Thus, all laws, including criminal
statutes, are subject to legal challenges and judicial review.
D.
POLICE POWER
Police power is the government’s authority to enact laws to promote the public
health, safety, morals, and welfare and, pursuant thereto, to establish police depart-
ments and prevent crimes. Police power stems from the purposes stated in the Pre-
amble of the Constitution: “To . . . establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, . . .
police power:
the government’s authority
to enact laws to promote the
public health, safety, morals,
and welfare and, pursuant
thereto, to establish police
departments and prevent
crimes.

ANALYSIS PROBLEM
1–1.
Concern has been voiced over the increased federalization of criminal
law (passage of federal laws that parallel state crimes). Considering federal-
ism and states rights issues, under what circumstances should the federal
government add—or not add—new crime laws?
6
■
CHAPTER 1
promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty. . . .” The Constitu-
tion, as previously mentioned, gives Congress authority to address crime in specifi-
cally enumerated areas.
The states, however, have broad police power preserved by the Tenth Amend-
ment. This power goes beyond establishing well-recognized crimes such as murder,
assault, and theft to encompass criminal penalties for violating health and safety laws
such as those regulating the work place, the environment, and housing codes. Police
power also extends to morals and the protection of privacy.
The police power of the states to regulate conduct is not unlimited. It is subject to
the restraint imposed by the Constitution of the United States, which includes the re-
quirement that there be a compelling need to regulate the conduct, that the law not im-
pinge on specific rights and liberties, and that the prohibited conduct be clearly defined
for the public. One role of the defense team is to examine the criminal statute being ap-
plied to the accused to see that it does not violate any of these limitations. The limits of
police power are discussed in more detail in Chapter 7 defenses to criminal charges.
Since 1970 Congress has expanded the number of federal crimes by forty-five per-
cent, totaling about 3,500 crimes that come under the authority of some thirty federal
agencies.1 This federalization of crimes is criticized as costly and unnecessarily du-
plicative of state crimes and resources.

by government officials that

among citizens, businesses,

the purpose of maintaining

III.
CRIMINAL LAW
A.
PURPOSE OF CRIMINAL LAW
Civilization has given us the benefits of peace, order, safety, and freedom in varying
degrees. One of the cornerstones in securing those benefits is law. Law is a dynamic
force consisting of a set of formal rules enacted by government officials that governs
the relationships among citizens, businesses, government, and nations for the pur-
pose of maintaining society and preventing chaos. We might ask what life would be
like without law. In 1660 Thomas Hobbes answered in the Leviathan.
[Without law] there is no place for industry; because the fruit thereof is uncertain; and
consequently no Culture of the Earth, no Navigation, nor use of the commodities that
may be imported by Sea; no commodious Building; no Instruments of moving, and
removing such things as require much force; no Knowledge of the face of Earth; no
account of Time; no Arts; no Letters; no Society; and which is worst of all, continuall
feare, and danger of violent death; And the life of man, solitary, poore, nasty, brutish,
and short.
The wisest legislators base the laws they write on the culmination of human expe-
rience. When law accomplishes its purpose to keep society in existence, functioning, and
as free of chaos as possible, it gives us security, predictability, and efficiency; it allows us
to use our time to be productive, creative, fulfilled human beings. Our own society has
additional goals—goals that we believe are born of the highest expression of civilized
human progress. These are freedom, equality, and the preservation of human dignity.
The system of law that aids us in our efforts to achieve these societal goals is di-
vided into two main branches, civil law and criminal law. Civil law defines the rights
civil law:
law that defines the rights of
individuals in their relation-
ships with other individuals
and establishes a process
for righting wrongs, mainly
through monetary reim-
bursement.

served significant aspects of
Roman and other law
through the Middle Ages.

traditional law originating in
England, recorded in judicial
opinions rather than legisla-
tive statutes.

of individuals in their relationships with other individuals. It defines our obligations
and duties to each other and establishes a process for righting wrongs, mainly
through monetary reimbursement. The major areas of civil law are contracts, real es-
tate, probate, and personal injury.
Criminal law identifies conduct subject to prosecution and penalty by the state
and the procedure that must be followed. Common crimes include homicide, bur-
glary, rape, battery, theft, treason, and others. Civil and criminal law overlap some-
what. Consider a person who wrongfully takes the property of another. The victim
can sue that person to recover the property or to be paid for its loss. The state can pros-
ecute the same person for theft and, if a conviction is reached, administer punishment
of fines or imprisonment.
Civil law is designed to provide fair compensation for injured persons. Criminal
law is designed to punish bad or immoral acts that carry a more serious social stigma
than civil wrongs. Procedural rules in both areas are similar.
B.
SOURCES OF CRIMINAL LAW
Our criminal law has evolved from the laws of previous civilizations: The Hebrews
codified a strongly moral law based on the Mosaic Code (law of Moses) including the
Ten Commandments; the Greeks used large citizen juries, defined the rights of citi-
zens in a democracy, and were the first to believe laws were made by people and not
by gods; the Romans built on Greek law and expanded it to include a reasonably com-
plete body of criminal law that is the basis for much criminal law today; and the Ro-
man Catholic Middle Ages preserved significant aspects of Roman and other law
through the canon law of the church.
It was the English, however, who contributed the most to our current criminal
law. Influenced by previous civilizations and institutions, the English went on to de-
velop their own common law originating in the customs and traditions of a rural
economy. As it was passed from generation to generation and applied by magistrates
and judges, the common law was eventually recorded in thousands of judicial opin-
ions. Each new generation of judges consulted previous opinions and became bound,
more or less, to follow them. Thus was established the principle of legal precedent—
stare decisis—that governs much of our legal decision-making process and assures
us of a degree of certainty and predictability in our law. Read the decision and dissent
in Payne v. Tennessee (1991) in Chapter 14 for a lively argument on the application of
stare decisis—letting the decision stand.
Some of our important legal rights evolved with the common law of England.
Trial by battle and trial by ordeal succumbed to the use of juries by the thirteenth cen-
tury. The responsibility for the prosecution of crimes was shifted from the victim, in-
cluding the powerless poor, to the state. Thus, crimes are said to be against the state,
and prosecutions pit the United States, the state, or the people against the alleged of-
fender. Most defendants, however, are no match for a powerful government. The
signing of the Magna Carta in 1215 improved the likelihood of justice by establishing
principles of fair procedure and protections for the accused. This important docu-
ment and subsequent developments gave us the writ of habeas corpus that prevents
incarceration without justification; the right to trial by jury; the right against unrea-
sonable searches and seizures; the right against conviction by ex post facto laws that
are passed after the act is committed; the freedom of religion, speech, and press; the
right to representation; the right to confront one’s accusers; the right against self-
incrimination; the presumption of innocence; and the right to proof beyond a reason-
able doubt.
These cornerstones of criminal law literally sailed to the New World in copies of
Blackstone’s Commentaries on the Common Law, a written record and analysis of the
English common law. Despite some aversion to English traditions following the Rev-
olutionary War, common law, and specifically its criminal components, became the
basis of law in the United States.

Model Penal Code and
Commentaries:
a guide by the American
Law Institute to reform and
unify criminal law in the
United States.
“Fred Rodell . . . once com-
pared the law to the Killy-loo
bird, a creature that he said
insisted on flying backward
because it didn’t care where
it was going but was mightily
interested in where it had
been.”
—Fred Rodell, American ed-
ucator; professor, Yale
Law School Paraphrase in
the New York Times, June
27, 1984
The common law is both preserved and rejected in our modern criminal statutes.
Though most states and the federal courts rely entirely on codified criminal law, Florida,
Rhode Island, and a few other states allow the courts to rule according to common law.
Even those states that have abolished common law crimes (called code jurisdic-
tion states) join the other states in employing common law defenses such as self-
defense, incapacity, and insanity. In some states even codified crimes such as murder,
rape, and others may be defined by referring to the common law. In common law
states, some crimes may exist only in the common law: “burning a body in a furnace,
keeping a house of prostitution . . . discharging a gun near a sick person; drunkenness
. . . and eavesdropping.”2
Keep in mind that the federal government, because its power in establishing
crimes is limited, never adopted common law. Where the federal government must
exercise broad police power similar to that of the states (in Washington, D.C., and
United States territories), however, common law is applied.
The sources of criminal law include contributions of ancient societies;
Roman/French law; federal and state constitutions; English common law as adapted
to the states and territories; bodies of criminal statutes called codes, ordinances, ad-
ministrative law, treaties, and international law; and court decisions interpreting the
law and establishing rules and principles.
Our common law heritage is important. When you research the law, pay attention
to whether the jurisdiction in which you are working uses the common law to define
crimes or to interpret statutory crimes. An understanding that our law is based on
centuries of experience and trial and error should instill a proper skepticism of pro-
posed changes in law that fail to take into account this legal heritage and tradition.
C.
MODEL PENAL CODE
The Model Penal Code and Commentaries is another source of modern criminal law.
First published in 1961, the Model Penal Code reduces the many and often conflict-
ing traditional sources of criminal law into a concise statement of criminal law. Not a
law itself, it is a model that serves as a guide to legislators, judges, and students of the
law. Many jurisdictions have clarified their criminal law by enacting substantial por-
tions of the Model Penal Code or adopting portions of it in court opinions. We refer
to this code for comparison and analysis.
D.
ADMINISTRATIVE CRIME
In addition to statutes that set out crimes, some administrative rules and regulations
contain criminal penalties. People may be prosecuted and penalized, for example, for
violating health and safety standards, toxic waste provisions, building codes, securi-
ties regulations, and for a variety of other offenses not found in the criminal statutes.
Legislatures may delegate some of their law-making authority to agencies, but only
through an enabling law that provides clear guidelines for the agency to follow. Leg-
islatures, however, not agencies, must set the extent of the penalties for violation of
administrative crimes.
E.
INTERNATIONAL CRIME
Citizens of a country may be subject to prosecution not only under their own nation’s
criminal law, but also for violations of international criminal law. Most often, these are
matters agreed to in international treaties. Recently individuals in Africa and the
Balkans have been convicted by United Nations tribunals for horrendous acts pro-
hibited by international war crimes laws. A permanent court, the International Crim-
inal Court (ICC) was established by multinational treaty in 1998. Currently, the
United States is not a signatory.
“That man is a creature who
needs order yet yearns for
change is the creative con-
tradiction at the heart of the
laws which structure his
conformity and define his
deviancy.”

ucator, Sisters in Crime,
1975
“[Common law] stands as a
monument slowly raised,
like a coral reef, from the

dividuals of whom each built

which his successors might
work.”

F.
CHANGE IN THE CRIMINAL LAW
Statutory laws change when legislatures pass new laws and repeal others, and when
courts declare laws unconstitutional. Legal precedent evolves as courts interpret
statutes and further define, and occasionally overturn, precedents. Though remain-
ing relatively constant, criminal law is dynamic, changing to meet new demands and
new circumstances. For example, the following laws are no longer on the books.
No female shall appear in a bathing suit on any highway within this state unless she is
escorted by at least two officers or unless she be armed with a club. (Kentucky)
It is illegal to place slot machines or other gambling devices in an outhouse. (Ohio)
It shall be unlawful to put any hypnotized person in a display window. (Oklahoma)3
New laws define identity theft, fetal homicide, and the broader scope of terror-
ism offenses. The criminal law also hangs on to the old. Laws still on the books in
some jurisdictions, though rarely enforced, prohibit hunting on Sunday, buying a do-
mestic animal between sunset and sunrise, fornicating, and using profanity.4
G.
DIVISIONS OF CRIMINAL LAW
Criminal law has two divisions or subfields. Substantive criminal law comprises def-
initions of crimes and principles governing punishment. Procedural criminal law
comprises the rules that the prosecution, the defense, and the courts must follow for
the step by step processing of a person from accusation to sentencing and appeal.
H.
DUE PROCESS
The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution state that a person may
not be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. Both substan-
tive and procedural criminal law are subject to this significant, fundamental princi-
ple. Substantive due process prohibits laws that are too vague, overbroad,
unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious. Procedural due process requires the steps in a
criminal proceeding to be fundamentally fair, assuring to some degree of certitude
that justification exists for arrest, prosecution, and punishment. The right to trial by
jury, to an attorney, against self-incrimination, and other constitutional guarantees are
specific due process requirements. Due process serves as a significant restraint on the
power of government.
Related, if not an integral part of due process, is the principle expressed by the
Latin maxim nullem crimen, nulla poena sine lege, there can be no crime and no punish-
ment without law. That is, the crime must be a previously stated part of the law. This
provides citizens with a fundamental element of due process called notice, meaning
a person cannot be convicted of a crime unless that person was given prior warning
(notice) that the conduct was prohibited. Unless conduct has been written into our
criminal code or established in common law (recorded in judicial opinions), that con-
duct is not criminal and no charges can legally be brought against a person for en-
gaging in it. Federal crimes, therefore, are published in the United States Code and
state crimes in the codes of the respective states. Federal administrative crimes are
published in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), and state administrative crimes
in parallel publications of state administrative rules and regulations.
I.
CLASSIFICATION OF CRIMES
Historically, crimes have been identified as mala in se, inherently evil or obvious
wrongs generally accepted by most societies through time as serious crimes: murder,
rape, robbery, and arson; or mala prohibita, crimes not inherently evil but suffi-
ciently bad to have been prohibited by law, such as speeding, gambling, the sale of
mala prohibita:
crimes not inherently evil but
sufficiently bad to have been
prohibited by law.

CHAPTER 1
felony:
the most serious crime;
requires a minimum of one
year in a state or federal
prison (not a county jail).
capital crime:
a crime for which a person
can receive the death
penalty.
misdemeanor:
lesser crime than a felony;
penalties include fines and
up to one year in a county
jail (as opposed to prison).
petty offense:
a misdemeanor punished by
a maximum of six month’s
jail time or $500 fine, or
both.
violation:
noncriminal offense, such as
traffic violations and public
drunkenness, for which the
city, county, or state may
only fine the offender.
intoxicating beverages, and possession of illegal drugs. Although some judicial opin-
ions still refer to these terms when deciding, for example, whether a specific crime
requires proof of intent or a jury trial, they are of relatively little value in classifying
crimes.
Today crimes are classified primarily by the seriousness of the actual or intended
harm. Therefore, crimes that harm people are separated from crimes that harm prop-
erty, an intentional killing is separated from a negligent one, embezzlement of $20,000
is separated from theft of $20. The more serious the harm, the more serious the pun-
ishment. Felonies are the most serious crimes and require a minimum of one year in
a state or federal prison (not a county jail). A capital crime is a crime for which a per-
son can receive the death penalty. Today capital offenses are normally limited to mur-
der and treason. Misdemeanors are lesser crimes than felonies and have penalties
that include fines and up to one year in a county jail (as opposed to prison). Petty
offenses are misdemeanors punished by a maximum of six month’s jail time or $500
fine, or both. Violations are noncriminal offenses, such as traffic violations and pub-
lic drunkenness, for which the city, county, or state may only fine the offender. Classes
of crimes are discussed in more detail in Chapter 3.
IV.
PUNISHMENT AND CRIMINAL LAW
A.
INTRODUCTION
The purpose of criminal law is to prevent individual harm, but more importantly it is
to protect society, the always-vulnerable state of civilization, from those forces that
most threaten the peace, harmony, security, integrity, and stability of each citizen and
of society as a whole. It is to protect us from a life that is “nasty, brutish, and short.”
You could say that criminal law is social self-defense.
Acts that threaten or harm individuals and, thus, society, are sufficiently serious
that they require punishment. Punishment for the wrongdoer is more than physical
or monetary punishment; it encompasses the formal, moral condemnation of the com-
munity.5 The most commonly voiced objectives of punishment are retribution, deter-
rence, and rehabilitation. Authorities cannot agree, however, on which of these
objectives is most important or whether each one is appropriate. The crimes defined
in the criminal law, the penalties assessed, and the condition of punishment imposed
stem from an application of retribution, deterrence, and rehabilitation in varying com-
binations and degrees.
B.
RETRIBUTION
Retribution is an expressed purpose of punishment reflecting the concept of just
desserts—if a person elects to commit a crime, that person deserves to be punished
and to the degree warranted by the seriousness of the crime. Dating back at least as
far as the Code of Hammurabi (2100 B.C.), retribution also has been expressed as “an
eye for an eye” and the “law of equivalent retaliation.” If one knocked out the eye or
tooth of another, the same was to be done to the assailant; if a son struck his father,
the son’s hand was cut off; and if a physician caused a patient to lose an eye or to die,
the physician’s fingers were cut off.6
More recently, however, the focus has been on the idea of just desserts—wrong-
ful acts deserve punishment. In addition, proponents argue that retribution has the
value of expiation: cleansing the community and offering the offender a chance to re-
join society by atoning for the sin and paying a prescribed debt to society. The
seventeenth-century Salem witchcraft trials were heavily justified on the basis of
cleansing the community of the devil and his helpers by hanging those who held fast
to their innocence and refused to repent.
retribution:
an expressed purpose of
punishment reflecting the
concept of just desserts.

Foundations of Criminal Law
■11
deterrence:
the prevention of crime as a
goal of punishment.
general deterrence:
prevention of crime in soci-
ety as a whole; to bring
about conformity with soci-
ety’s norms by identifying
bad conduct.
individual (specific)
deterrence:
incapacitation or punishment
to prevent criminals from re-
peating as offenders.
Another justification given for retribution is that if the government takes action
against the criminal, then individuals will be less inclined to do so. Thus, the goals of
social order and peace are better preserved.
On that score, I would say only that I cannot agree that retribution is a constitutionally
impermissible ingredient in the imposition of punishment. The instinct for retribution
is part of the nature of man, and channeling that instinct in the administration of
criminal justice serves an important purpose in promoting the stability of a society
governed by law. When people begin to believe that organized society is unwilling or
unable to impose upon criminal offenders the punishment they “deserve,” then there are
sown the seeds of anarchy—of self-help, vigilante justice and lynch law.
—Furman v. Georgia (1972)
Critics of retribution attack its validity on the basis that human civilization has
advanced beyond the idea of equivalent retaliation. Opponents further argue that its
premise, that criminals elect to commit crimes, ignores all of the other factors that may
cause a person to commit crime: ignorance, fear, desperation, mental illness, emo-
tional trauma, and other factors.
C.
DETERRENCE
Deterrence, the prevention of crime, is widely accepted as a goal of punishment. The
premise is that individuals will be dissuaded from committing crimes if the pain of
punishment outweighs the benefits derived from committing the crime. Legal history
is replete with punishments that run the entire scale of human imagination: banish-
ment, dismemberment, crucifixion, branding, hanging, electrocution, imprisonment,
fines, and public dunking.
General deterrence is aimed at most of society—those who have not yet com-
mitted a crime. One of its purposes is to bring about conformity with society’s norms
by identifying bad conduct. The fear of being labeled a criminal—an undesirable, an
unworthy member of society—with all the social and economic stigmas that are at-
tached is enough to keep most people on the straight and narrow. The fear of con-
demnation by family, peers, religious establishments, and the community has long
been an effective deterrent for even the most primitive of societies.
Proponents of deterrence argue that another benefit is that the threat of punish-
ment leads to habitual and subconscious conformity that, over time and from gener-
ation to generation, achieves a high degree of socialization without any eventual
awareness of or fear of punishment. It simply becomes the way things are done.7
Opponents argue that punishment as a deterrent has not been substantiated. Am-
bitious studies on deterrence, especially in the area of capital punishment as a means
of preventing murder, have been largely inconclusive. It is argued that most criminals
do not believe that they will get caught, and few have much conception of what their
punishment is likely to be if they do get caught. Studies show no scientific proof that
criminals fear punishment, citing how French pickpockets fleeced spectators watch-
ing the execution by hanging of their fellow pickpockets. There seems to be evidence
that some criminals hope to get caught and use crime as their only hope to become
“somebody”. Further, opponents contend that punishment has absolutely no effect
on criminals who are insane, psychologically compulsive such as kleptomaniacs,
highly distraught as in some murders or suicide, incapacitated as by retardation or in-
toxication, and those who commit crimes in the heat of passion.
Individual (specific) deterrence focuses on the person who has been convicted
of a crime. The premise here is that if criminals are punished severely enough, they
will not want to experience the same or a similar punishment again and, therefore,
will conform. The degree of recidivism (repeat offenses) that now exists, however,
suggests that this premise is questionable. Sixty-seven percent of inmates released in
1994 had been arrested again within three years, compared with 62 percent in 1983
recidivism:
repeat offenses.

CHAPTER 1
according to a Bureau of Justice Statistics report. Some observers believe that the in-
crease is the result of a relaxation of habitual-criminal sentencing laws, and others at-
tribute it to a shift away from rehabilitation programs.8
Another basis of specific deterrence is incapacitation. This has the appeal of in-
escapable logic: identify those who commit crimes, especially those who are likely to
repeat as offenders, and place them where they will not cause crime, thus ridding so-
ciety of its criminal element. No matter what the arguments are against it, it must
work at least to some degree.
Unfortunately, there are weaknesses in this argument, not in its logic but in its sim-
plicity. One serious problem is predicting who will be a repeat offender. Psychologists
and psychiatrists have largely agreed that such predictions have been unreliable. Only
recently have methods begun to show any potential for improving such predictions.9
Further, can we prevent criminals from being repeat offenders through punish-
ment when our prisons and jails are admittedly “schools for crime”? Recidivists ad-
mit to learning new sophisticated methods to carry out their crimes, making good
criminal contacts, and discovering better means to avoid detection. Sociologists tell
us that people learn to identify with the society or subculture in which they associate.
If that is so, then our prisons may do more to reinforce a criminal subculture than they
do to prevent the repetition of crime.
Opponents of the idea of deterrence through incapacitation (imprisonment) say
that most citizens want longer prison terms assessed. Yet, our prisons are already an-
tiquated and bursting at the seams, and tax-paying citizens are unwilling to pay for
the space needed to accommodate longer prison sentences.
D.
REHABILITATION
Rehabilitation (reformation) is the third factor long argued to be an objective of pun-
ishment. Logically it might be considered as part of deterrence, because part of the
justification for rehabilitation is that the reformed criminal will not be a repeat of-
fender. Rehabilitation aims to treat criminal behavior as a disease by replacing igno-
rance with education, lack of job skills with job training, dependence on alcohol and
drugs with abstinence and discipline, and by treating emotional and psychological
disturbances with therapy. Its design is to take persons who have previously been un-
able to compete in a highly competitive society and give them the ability to become
contributing citizens with appropriate doses of self-esteem.
During the 1960s and 1970s rehabilitation programs directed thousands of of-
fenders from jails and prisons into community health and education programs. Early
release from prison was often based on successful completion of such programs.
Though it was seen as an enlightened approach to penology and greeted with
considerable enthusiasm at first, rehabilitation lost favor by the 1980s for several rea-
sons. Statistics reflected little change in recidivism rates. Society and political offi-
cials wanted quick, verifiable results for their tax dollars. The children of the
post–World War II baby boom came of age for crime (fifteen to twenty-four years
old). The Vietnam War and the drug culture of the 1960s led to a disruption of ac-
cepted behavior and a related expansion of crime even to rural areas to support drug
habits. Exacerbating that scenario was the fact that government revenues were dry-
ing up.
The results of this shift in focus include longer, determinate (certain length), and
mandatory (no probation) prison sentences; fewer rehabilitation programs; increased
penalties for repeat felons; the reestablishment of executions for murder; more atten-
tion on the victim of crime than on the perpetrator; pressure on parole boards to keep
prisoners longer; an expensive war on drugs; and terribly crowded prisons. The
United States continues to have one of the highest imprisonment rates of all modern
nations.10 Another study indicates that prisoner work and training programs produce
rehabilitation:
the objective of criminal law
to reform criminals and give
them the ability to compete
in society.

lower recidivism rates.11 Whether general rehabilitation was ever given a fair shake
as a deserving aim for criminal law remains an issue.
So, the classic debate on rehabilitation continues. Proponents argue that there was
enough success in the 1960s and 1970s to warrant rehabilitation efforts for those of-
fenders most likely to benefit from them, and that punishment still should be indi-
vidualized. Opponents argue that the emphasis must be on swift and stern
deterrence, and that rehabilitation can actually be more cruel and result in longer sen-
tences than those under a determinate system. One interesting justification for this
position is captured by the writer C. S. Lewis:
Of all tyrannies a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the
most oppressive. . . . Those who torment us for our own good will torment us without
end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience. . . . To be “cured” against
one’s will and cured of states which we may not regard as disease is to be put on a level
with . . . the infants, imbeciles, and domestic animals.12
A new concept related to rehabilitation is restorative justice, which gives the per-
petrator of a crime a role in repairing the harm to the victim. This method employs
community resources to de-emphasize retribution and combat recidivism by helping
perpetrators accept responsibility for their wrongful conduct.
In the twenty-first century our society must continue to reexamine to what extent
our criminal justice system will be motivated by retribution, deterrence, and rehabil-
itation. More immediately, paralegals and attorneys need to be aware of their moti-
vations in each charge they bring, each case they try, and each sentence they
recommend. As a citizen of this country, which of these three concepts do you believe
deserves the most attention? Should any be completely excluded? Are there other so-
lutions? Think about that in terms of the mass murderer, the mentally retarded mur-
derer, the facilitator of euthanasia, the uneducated thief, the Wall Street inside trader,
the tax cheat, and others. Does your perspective change if you, your parent, or a sib-
ling is the offender? What if you or someone close to you is the victim?
Look at the decisions and dissents in Gregg v. Georgia (1976) and Payne v. Tennessee
(1991) in Chapter 14 for an idea about the ongoing debate on the proper objectives of
punishment.
V.
CRITICAL REASON AND CRIMINAL LAW
Law is based on reason, which in turn is based on knowledge and human experience.
Persons working with criminal law, or those simply wishing to understand it, will better
succeed if they delve into the reasoning or rationale behind a specific statute or judicial
opinion. Some citizens accept a statute as valid simply because it is a product of a repre-
sentative legislative process and on its face appears beneficial, or at least does not directly
impact on them. Others argue that each statute, each new judicial opinion, should be se-
riously scrutinized, because the law defines crimes and crimes create criminals.
Prisons are built with stones of Law . . . .

Men are not hanged for stealing horses, but that horses may not be stolen.
—George Savile
If the legislature enacts a criminal statute and the ramifications it will have on the
public are thoroughly considered from all important perspectives, there should be no
serious problem. Unfortunately, the same historical experience that tells us what is
good law also tells us that criminal statutes are enacted for other, not so altruistic rea-
sons. Law reflects the values and morals of a society, but it can be argued that too of-
ten the society reflected by law is that of the rich and the powerful, including special
interest groups. As the theory goes, the powerful enact laws to help them make and
protect wealth, and then use the criminal law to coerce others into helping them in
the process. Crimes once prohibiting the organization of unions helped to protect the
powerful owners of industry, laws prohibiting African Americans from sitting in the
front of a bus or eating at certain diners helped preserve the power and social status
of whites, laws requiring young people to serve in the military can be viewed as laws
protecting the wealth and property of the nation’s most powerful, and laws pro-
hibiting vagrancy or sleeping on park benches facilitate the middle class in control-
ling the homeless. Those who believe that crimes are defined by the most influential
see criminal law as a net that allows the rich and powerful to swim free while smaller
fry are ensnared.
Sometimes the power to change criminal law comes from panic or simply a wave
of strong public sentiment that drowns the voices of reason and caution.
Necessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom. It is the argument of
tyrants; it is the creed of slaves.
—William Pitt, House of Commons, Nov. 18, 1783
Thus our society has borne witness to laws that have imprisoned thousands of
Japanese Americans during World War II, laws that prohibited peaceful protest
marches, and, increasingly, laws that inhibit individual freedom in the attempt to con-
tain the spread of illegal drugs or the threat of terrorism.
Another danger in the relationship between power and criminal law is that once
a crime is defined, characteristics of those likely to commit the crime are also defined.
For example, in the seventeenth-century witchcraft trials, witches were defined ac-
cording to what people in power disliked or distrusted. Consequently, those who
were poor, crotchety, alone, old, and female became prototypes of suspected, and
eventually executed, witches. A similar principle of defining crime seems to be used
by city councils when they define vagrants.
Rogues and vagabonds, or dissolute persons who go about begging, common gamblers,
persons who use juggling or unlawful games or plays, common drunkards, common
night walkers, thieves, pilferers or pickpockets, traders in stolen property, lewd, wanton
and lascivious persons, keepers of gambling places, common railers and brawlers,
persons wandering or strolling around from place to place without any lawful purpose
or object, habitual loafers, disorderly persons, persons neglecting all lawful business and
habitually spending their time by frequenting houses of ill fame, gaming houses, or
places where alcoholic beverages are sold or served, persons able to work but habitually
living upon the earnings of their wives or minor children shall be deemed vagrants and,
upon conviction in the Municipal Court shall be punished as provided for Class D
offenses [90 days’ imprisonment, $500 fine, or both].
—Papachristou et al. v. City of Jacksonville (1972)
Imagine the potential abuse if such statutes were allowed to stand. A number of
theories are often at work in criminal law, so it is important that each crime, each def-
inition of crime, and each procedure be critically examined to see that it is fair to all
and truly in the (admittedly elusive) “best interest of society.”
“Hungry people cannot be
good at learning or produc-
ing anything, except per-
haps violence.”

THE DILEMMA OF CRIME IN A FREE SOCIETY
This nation, by its origin and Constitution, strives to foster and preserve individual
liberty and dignity. Freedom of speech, mobility, association, religion, and press,
and freedom from governmental intrusion into our private lives are all corner-
stones of our right to think what we want, go where we want, do what we want to
do in the privacy of our own dwellings—to fully enjoy the right to life, liberty, and
property.
Yet, to fully enjoy these freedoms we turn to government to protect us from those
who abuse their freedoms to carry out terrorism, murder, kidnapping, drug dealing,
toxic dumping, theft, and a host of other crimes. The dilemma is in how much power
to give the government and its law enforcement agencies in trade for our liberty.
Where is the line between protection and freedom in respect to searches of our
homes and vehicles, extraction of a confession, seizure or destruction of the property
of suspected criminals, the privacy of family relationships in investigations of
spouse or child abuse, records kept on each one of us or the monitoring of our move-
ments or phone conversations? How much are we as a free people willing to give up
to have order? This question, always significant, is even more acute in light of an-
titerrorism legislation such as the USA PATRIOT Act, which gives law enforcement
agencies more power to seize, monitor, and search citizens and residents in un-
precedented secrecy.
Ben Franklin said, “They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little tem-
porary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.” What price are we willing to pay in
tolerating crimes so that our liberty will remain inviolate? This issue is played out
constantly on our streets, in our legislatures, and in our courtrooms. Whether you
work in criminal law or become an interested observer, be acutely aware of this
dilemma, because the preservation of individual liberty and, yes, even of this nation
as we know it rests in how we decide, or demand, that this issue be resolved.

CRIME IN THE UNITED STATES
A.
CURRENT STATE OF CRIME
Crime rates in the United States ballooned in the 1980s, spurred by drug market war-
fare, a large population of crime-prone young people, use of drugs and alcohol,
gangs, poverty, mental illness, deterioration of the nuclear family, increasing numbers
of female criminals, and other complex reasons. The search for explanations in the
1990s produced studies, for example, that tied criminal inclination to children whose
mothers smoke13 and for those exposed to excessive quantities of lead.14 Crime rates
peaked, however, in 1993 and have dropped steadily since then. The rate of juvenile
crime fell twice as fast as that for adult crime.15 Rates of violent crimes have fallen
nearly 50 percent since 1993 and are the lowest since the Justice Department started
reporting data in 1973.16 Exhibit 1–1 displays the comparative crime rates for the four
regions of the United States.17

REASONS FOR DROP IN CRIME18
It is difficult to pinpoint any one reason for the drop in crime because several important
factors exist simultaneously that may bear on the decline in crime. Demographically, the
crime-prone age group (fifteen to twenty-nine year olds) was the smallest in decades,
bottoming out in 1994. The drug markets seem to have stabilized, bringing a reduction
in related crimes. Police have instituted new and more aggressive strategies to stop
crime. These include more foot patrols and surveillance cameras, sponsorship and in-
volvement in after-school programs for children, support for neighborhood “take back
the night” programs, aggressive enforcement of petty crimes (which seems to reduce
more serious crimes), interception of the flow of illegal handguns, and the use of tech-
nology to rapidly pinpoint “hot spots” of crime so resources can be deployed to those
areas. More people are in prisons and jails than at any time in our history. Incarceration
rates remained flat from 1925 to 1975, but have quadrupled in the past twenty-five years.
C.
SPECIAL CONCERNS: PRESENT AND FUTURE
Although the drop in the crime rate is encouraging, there are some special areas of
concern. Although teen crime rates have declined, this crime-prone age group will
grow in population considerably until it peaks in about 2020.19 Of greater concern,
however, is the fact that teens are twice as likely to be the victims of violent crimes
than persons in other age groups, according to the National Council on Crime and
Delinquency. Such reports indicate the need for communities to develop strategies to
deal with bullying, incest, and gangs.20 Also, women now represent 23 percent of all
arrests, a 14 percent increase since 1993.21 It is not clear whether this means women
are more involved in crime or that society now responds differently to female crimi-
nals than in previous decades. Workplace shootings continue to alarm the public, and

the availability of cheap handguns and automatic weapons fuels debate. Not only are
guns available on the market, but they are also found in 40 percent of households with
children ages three to seventeen.22 More persons are killed by guns every two years
in the United States than were United States soldiers killed in the entire Vietnam
War.23 Thirty-three states permit the carrying of concealed weapons, largely for self-
defense and in response to the perception that an armed population would deter
crime. Although experts hold varying opinions, a recent study indicates that such
laws do not reduce crime and may actually increase it.24 Our lawmakers continue the
debate over legislation for gun control.
Another area of concern is minorities’ growing lack of faith in the criminal justice
system. Years of discrimination in arrests, sentencing, and the death penalty have re-
cently been aggravated by racial profiling in traffic arrests, some horrendous hate
crimes, and the low number of minorities in criminal justice jobs. One disturbing set
of statistics shows that even though blacks make up 13 percent of our population and
15 percent of drug users, they comprise 35 percent of possession arrests, 55 percent of
convictions, and 74 percent of imprisonments for drug possession.25 Added to this are
reports of overzealous police conduct involving excessive force, the use of false evi-
dence, and the violation of civil liberties.
How our criminal justice system deals with mental illness remains a concern. In
one study, 40 percent of adult death row inmates and 50 percent of juveniles on death
row had chronic psychosis.26 In a 2000 study, some degree of mental impairment was
found in all inmates studied.27
The relationship between crime and the economy is an ongoing problem. The
segments of our population traditionally most involved in crime—juveniles and un-
skilled males—are also the most vulnerable to economic downturns. Therefore, it is
argued that government policies enhancing employability and providing adequate
wages may have a significant impact on reducing crime.28
People crushed by law have no hope but from power. If laws are their enemies, they will
be enemies to the laws; and those, who have much to hope and nothing to lose, will
always be dangerous, more or less.
—Edmund Burke, October 1777
Finally, many of the criminals who were caught up in the get-tough policies of the
1980s and 1990s are finishing their sentences. Because our overcrowded prisons have
not had the resources needed for effective rehabilitation programs and the treatment
of mental illness, new concerns exist over what will happen as these convicts reenter
society in increasing numbers.

PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE
STUDY OF CRIMINAL LAW
A.
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDYING CRIMINAL LAW
Paralegals who choose to work in criminal law not only will see the intrusion of
crime into neighborhoods and lives, but also will realize that the protection of
society and the preservation of the freedom—and occasionally the safety—of real

people depend on the quality of work that they perform. Your study of this text is
an important step toward that work. For those who choose another field, the mate-
rials in this text will help you better understand the scope and importance of crim-
inal law, how the system works, and how it can be a snare for the unwary in nearly
every other field of law. In other words, a good foundation in criminal law will help
you become a more astute citizen and a better paralegal regardless of what field
you will work in.
B.
ABOUT THIS TEXT: APPLYING STATE LAW
This text is divided into two main sections: substantive criminal law and procedural
criminal law. It presents prevailing trends and practices in the law, often in the con-
text of the fictional state of Columbia. For the necessary knowledge about your state
law and practice, use the references to the state of Columbia to stand for your state,
and use every opportunity that time permits to apply the law, cases, and rules of pro-
cedure of your state to the issues, problems, and assignments in this text. In this re-
gard, space is provided in the text’s tables for you to add state-specific information.
C.
THE SYSTEM FOLDER
The list of system folder assignments at the end of each chapter, when completed, will
help you create a paralegal’s system folder for criminal law. Asystem folder is a collec-
tion of forms, documents, checklists, procedural rules, and principles of law, including
case law and statutes and the rationale behind them. Once organized, the system folder
will provide you with a valuable reference for quickly and accurately completing the
most important and commonly repeated tasks performed by the paralegal in the crim-
inal law context. The system folder can be carried from the classroom to the office, it can
be used as a portfolio to demonstrate your acquired skills to a potential employer, and
it easily can be adapted and modified to accommodate different styles and areas of
practice. In short, a criminal law folder, when created with care and diligence, can
greatly assist you in becoming an efficient, accurate, and valuable paralegal.
The assignments in this course program and the outline in Appendix B at the end
of this text will guide you in developing your system. A two-inch, three-ring binder
provides the room and flexibility for your first criminal litigation system.
As you complete each assignment, place the information needed to perform it, in-
cluding pertinent sample documents, into the corresponding section of the system
folder. Because some instructors will assign more of the tasks set out in this text than
others, consider building your system to be as complete as possible by going beyond
what you might be assigned.
If you have had a litigation course or after you read Chapter 13, you will note the
similarity between organizing a system folder and organizing a trial notebook. Whereas
a trial notebook is specific to a particular case in preparation for trial, a system folder is

A.
CASE I
Kate Lamb slung her bookpack over her shoulder and left the lecture hall, letting the
echoes of her professor’s voice give way to the nighttime beauty of Legalville State Col-
lege’s campus. Enormous old trees lined the hushed path and the scent of crab apple
blossoms hung in the air. Still, the late evening class did not give her much time to pre-
pare for tomorrow’s classes, so she hurried on across the high footbridge over Smiley
Creek to the parking lot beyond. Her car was at the back of the now-empty lot, and she
approached it on the path between a dense stand of pines and the marked parking stalls.
Suddenly there was a rush and strong arms around her dragging her toward the
trees. Kate screamed, twisted, struggled. The hands began tearing her clothes, the low
voice grunted that she would get what all pretty little college girls asked for. Kate’s
efforts finally freed one arm and allowed her to face her attacker. With all the strength
of her free arm she swung her heavy bookbag at his head. He fell into the darkness
under the pines. Hesitating, in shock, she heard him scramble to his feet. His footsteps
echoed hers as she tried desperately to run.
Sobbing and shaking, Kate stumbled back to the bridge. She could hear her as-
sailant begin to pursue. When she was halfway across the bridge she saw several dark
forms, men, emerge from the trees on the other side. Kate panicked and felt trapped be-
tween them and the man behind her in the pine trees. Twenty feet below were the rocky
banks and spring-swollen waters of Smiley Creek. Crying frantic words of prayer, she
clambered over the railing and jumped, not landing in the safe water but on the rocks.
Five days later Kate regained consciousness in the intensive care unit of a hospital.
She was able to make a statement to police and described the assailant the best she could.
Shortly thereafter she lapsed into a coma and in August, four months later, she died.
In October, police arrested a suspect, Eldon Spiers.

CASE II
Miguel and Carmen Cordoba celebrated the first anniversary of their marriage with
a candlelight dinner at the romantic restaurant where Miguel had proposed. After the
waiter had taken their order, Miguel gave Carmen her gift, an heirloom ring. The di-
amond ring, recently appraised at $10,000, had been in his family for four generations,
and was always given as a gift of great love. The last to wear it had been Miguel’s
Aunt Rosa, the dear lady who had been like a second mother to him. Now it was to
be worn by Carmen, as a token of his love for her.
The ring had no magic, however, and the Cordoba’s marriage deteriorated
quickly. After a couple of years of stability, they went through five years of ever more
frequent separations and unsuccessful visits to counselors. Finally, Miguel asked Car-
men for a divorce and left their home.
Before the divorce was filed, Miguel returned to the house to get his clothes and
other personal belongings. While there, he went to his wife’s jewelry box and re-
moved the heirloom ring. Soon it was being worn by Estella Anza, his new girlfriend.
Carmen Cordoba asked Miguel to return the ring and, when he did not, swore
out a complaint against him for theft.

Mayor Chen cradled the small cardboard box in his arms all the way home. This lit-
tle jewel would make history in Legalville. Not only that, it would also clinch his re-
election. He had promised to make Legalville a cultural center in spite of other cities
in the state that bragged about their fine concert halls and art galleries. The museum
had been set up in an unused upper floor of the library and was starting to look con-
vincing with the donated artifacts and paintings that he had begged from a few lo-
cal professors and businesspeople who were travelers and collectors. But the object

in the box, this priceless pre-Columbian sun god of hammered gold, would authen-
ticate the whole project. Mayor Chen chuckled to himself as he thought how he had
cajoled a major insurance company into making the donation, how foxy he had been
to have them send it from their headquarters by regular parcel post so as not to draw
attention to it, and how he would shine beside it at the unveiling party tonight at
his home.
Max Legrise sat at a polished teak desk making final assignments. Eddie Corr
would drive the van, Henry Pogue would stand lookout, and Cat Bermuda would
slip into the mayor’s drawing room and remove the idol while it lay unattended as
the mayor received guests in the front hall. He thanked Imp Satterfield for her im-
peccable research into the job and Barney Dobson for weapons procurement, then ad-
journed to the work of the evening.
Lacey Rude smoothed the apron of her maid’s uniform and peeked at the crowd
gathering in the front hall. There was still time before she would be required to
arrange trays of refreshments in the dining room. On quiet rubber soles she was soon
in the empty drawing room. She hid the idol under her apron and was halfway to the
kitchen when a heavy object struck the back of her head.
Pandemonium reigned around the empty pedestal in the drawing room. Mayor
Chen fought to keep from sobbing as he told all he knew to the police.
There was quiet exultation around the teak desk as Cat told of success in spite of
unexpected difficulties.
A year later the Legrise gang was reassembled in the custody of police.

Billy McIntire let out a slow breath. Tomorrow was a day off and he planned to sleep
through it, but not before he unwound a little. The months of overtime at the factory
were getting to him but as the kids grew, so did the bills. He would not be running a
drill press forever, though. If he could stick with these night classes he would get a
better paying job that required a lot less sweat. The classes were taking their toll too.
Studying for this examination had kept him up with his nose in a book, then just up,
pacing, worrying. Now, after twelve hours on the job, an hour of lecture, and two
hours writing the examination, it was up to the professor. Now Billy could relax.
Several people from the class had invited him to join them at The Zero Zone af-
ter the test. Billy was tired but pleased to be included. He drank beer and played pool
with his new friends. Around 2:00 a.m. he headed home.
Flashing lights ahead, police cars. Uh-oh, a DUI roadblock.
Billy was asked to get out of his car and perform coordination tests. It seemed to
him that he had done ok, but the police officers were frowning and mumbling. While
he was out of the car, one officer looked through it, emerging with Billy’s book bag.
When the officer unzipped the pencil pocket, several marijuana cigarettes fell out.
Billy McIntire was taken to the police station.

This was going to be the best Great Groundhog Day bash ever, and Nancy Stroud was
glad to see her friends having a good time. It meant a lot to have this apartment where
they could gather for parties. She had been lucky to find a roommate like Lisa
Munden with her beautician’s income to help with rent. Nancy’s student loan cer-
tainly would not have been enough. Now Nancy’s friends from college and Lisa’s
friends from work and town mingled at the party. Neither Nancy nor Lisa knew all
the guests. Each assumed the unknowns were friends of her roommate.
As Nancy circulated among the guests she thought she saw indications that some
of them were using cocaine there in the apartment. Because she did not use drugs her-
self, she was not sure about her suspicions.

the blue saltbox at the end of Meadow Drive had already inflamed the neighborhood
and was now discussed in alarmed voices. “What is to be done about Mason Trew
and Loren Jackson?” “Property values will surely drop.” “Other gays will be attracted
to Haden Hills Estates.” “The neighborhood children will be in danger.” The twenty
people in the Craigs’ living room grew more passionate in their condemnation of
their new neighbors as concerns were aired. Something must be done, they all agreed.
Another quiet day and evening passed in Haden Hills, then at 1:00 a.m. a faded
grey van pulled up a half block away from the blue saltbox on Meadow Drive. Three
figures wearing sheets and hoods left the van. Soon a large wooden cross was burn-
ing on the front lawn of the Trew and Jackson residence. Signs with slogans “We don’t
want no fags here” and “Get out or die” were stuck in the yard. Gunshots broke win-
dows in the house.
Three days later Richard Craig, John Harvey, and Mike Wescott were arrested.

CHAPTER 2
I.
INTRODUCTION
To implement the objectives of criminal law presented in Chapter 1, a system of agen-
cies and offices, public and private, come together to provide the structure of the crim-
inal justice system. Law enforcement agencies (police), prosecution and defense
attorneys, corrections agencies (prison and parole), and courts each work to move a
case from the commission of the crime itself to its legal resolution. From the adver-
sary system come the responsibilities of prosecutors, defenders, and judges who use
the competitive nature of the courts to resolve cases using a process that is fair.
In each of these components, paralegals work within prescribed limits to fulfill a
broad variety of responsibilities to employers, clients, the paralegal profession, and
the criminal justice system.
II.
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES
Law enforcement agencies are a part of the executive branch of government. They are
the police agencies charged with the responsibility of preventing and investigating
crime. They have the authority within constitutional limits to seize property, detain
suspicious individuals for questioning, and, where the facts and evidence warrant it,
arrest the suspected perpetrators. Nearly 40,000 such agencies operate at the federal,
state, and local levels. The largest law enforcement agency at the federal level is the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). It is an arm of the Department of Justice and is
responsible for preventing terrorism in the United States and enforcing the federal
criminal laws. The bureau’s 56 field offices, 400 satellite offices, 45 foreign liaison
posts, and 11,400 special agents operate under a $4 billion annual budget and have ju-
risdiction over 200 categories of federal crimes.1 It investigates crimes such as mur-
der, rape, and burglary, and also covers internal security involving espionage and
counterespionage activities. The FBI’s centralized records on persons committing
felonies; fingerprint, DNA, and other identification detection banks; highly trained
agents; and some of the most advanced criminal detection technology available in the
world offer a valuable resource for state law enforcement agencies.
A number of other federal agencies also enforce the law. The Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms enforces laws related to sale, possession, manufacture, and
shipping of those items. The Drug Enforcement Administration covers the illegal pro-
duction, sale, and possession of prescription drugs, as well as drugs such as cocaine,
heroin, and methamphetamines. The Bureau of Postal Inspection investigates the vi-
olation of postal regulations, including use of the mails to defraud others and theft of
checks and other property in the mail.
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), established in 2001 to respond to the
threat of terrorism, consists of five major divisions (directorates). One is Border and
Transportation Security (BTS), which includes the Transportation Security Administra-
tion, the former U.S. Customs Service, and the border protection functions of the former
Immigration and Naturalization Service. Homeland Security also oversees the Coast
Guard and Secret Service. The latter investigates offenses covering credit and debit card
fraud, computer fraud, counterfeiting, and forgery of United States checks and bonds,
and prevents and investigates attacks and threats on the lives of government officials.
The Bureau of Indian Affairs is responsible for law enforcement on Native Amer-
ican reservations. Numerous divisions in other federal agencies are responsible for
investigating violations of law concerning labor practices, toxic waste, mining, trans-
portation, communication, and many others.
A variety of agencies enforce the law on the state level, as well. The most notable
is the state police, whose responsibilities range from public education and protection
of public officials to traffic enforcement and the prevention and investigation of all
crimes covered by state law. Police agencies at the county level are most commonly
sheriffs’ departments. A vestige of our common law heritage, the sheriff is an elected

Administration of Criminal Justice and the Role of the Paralegal
■29
official who oversees the law enforcement activities of civil service employees. Within
a county there are usually several city or municipal police departments headed by ap-
pointed or civil service officials. Increasingly common are unified police departments
that are a product of merged city and county governments.
State and local governments normally have divisions of agencies responsible for
the investigation of crimes related to the jurisdiction of that agency. These often en-
force child welfare, agricultural production and transportation, mining and occupa-
tional safety, insurance, banking, consumer fraud, and conservation and wildlife
laws. Because of the broad nature of police responsibilities and limits in government
funding, police exercise considerable discretion, ranging from who to stop for ques-
tioning to broad policy decisions such as what types of crimes will be allotted the
greatest portion of the agency’s resources.
One aspect of the law that is explored later is the need for criminal laws to provide
sufficiently clear guidelines for police to avoid uneven and unfair enforcement of the
law. One of the difficulties in law is balancing the need for flexibility in decision mak-
ing with the need for limits to prevent police abuse of the decision-making process.
Another dilemma for law enforcement agencies is balancing the high-tech capacity to
gather, store, and share unprecedented amounts of personal data, effective in fighting
crime and terrorism, with a person’s right to keep some information private.
Law enforcement is an exceptionally demanding occupation, requiring not only
sensitivity to individual liberty, but also split-second decisions with potentially deadly
consequences. Because of some high-profile cases involving abuse by officers, some de-
partments have instituted citizen boards to review the policies and practices of the de-
partments. Higher standards of training for police and education for law enforcement
officials have resulted in increased professionalism among law enforcement agencies.
III.
PROSECUTORIAL AGENCIES
Attorneys in prosecutorial agencies are responsible for using the information gath-
ered by police agencies to determine what crime was committed and who should be
prosecuted for it. They represent the government (the people) before and at trial and
usually make recommendations on the sentencing of offenders.
Prosecutors exercise considerable discretion. Besides deciding criminal charges
and against whom to file them, they recommend who should be permitted to go into
a community service diversion program rather than receive a felony record, decide
who should be offered plea bargains and the extent of the bargain, recommend
whether a juvenile should be waived to adult court, and decide whether an accused
will face the death penalty.
At the federal level the chief prosecutor is the attorney general of the United
States, appointed by the president and subject to confirmation by the Senate. The at-
torney general serves as head of the Department of Justice and works closely with the
executive branch of government to carry out its policies in federal law enforcement.
The prosecutorial arm of the Department of Justice also includes the United States at-
torneys and assistant U.S. attorneys. The former are appointed by the president and
the latter are civil service positions. Both handle cases in the federal district courts
from local offices. Their primary function is to prosecute individuals and corporations
for violations of federal criminal statutes. Occasionally special prosecutors are ap-
pointed by the Attorney General to direct the prosecution of high government offi-
cials in order to avoid obvious conflicts of interest for the attorney general.
State prosecutorial agencies are similar to those at the federal level. The highest
ranking state prosecutor is the state attorney general, usually an elected official re-
sponsible for running the office of attorney general and supervising assistant attor-
neys general and a large support staff divided into civil, criminal, appellate,
consumer fraud, legal education, and other sections. The attorney general’s office
handles most of the significant criminal appeals on behalf of the people or the state

30
■
CHAPTER 2
and may be responsible for prosecuting certain kinds of crimes. It also serves as a re-
source for other state and local prosecutors. Both the federal attorney general and the
state attorneys general issue Attorney General Opinions, a set of nonbinding advi-
sory opinions on law.
Titles of prosecutors vary by state and include district attorney, county attorney,
prosecuting attorney, commonwealth attorney, and state’s attorney. These officials are
usually elected in judicial districts that normally follow county or multiple county
lines. They are responsible for prosecuting violators of state criminal law. Some of
these offices—particularly those in urban counties—may be divided into a number of
divisions according to felonies, misdemeanors, and juvenile matters. Assistant pros-
ecutors are common.
Local governments elect or hire county and city attorneys to prosecute lesser state
offenses (misdemeanors) and ordinance (noncriminal) violations. Many of these of-
fices also handle civil cases for the local government and advise local officials on an
array of matters.
IV.
DEFENSE BAR
Criminal defense lawyers can work for a public agency or for a private law firm (the
private defense bar). Many members of the private defense bar specialize in criminal
law, others take criminal cases as part of a general practice. Unless appointed to a case
by the court, private defense attorneys are retained and paid by the defendant/client
like any attorney in a civil case.
The defense bar was expanded to include public defender agencies following two
landmark United States Supreme Court decisions. In these decisions, the Court inter-
preted the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution to require the ap-
pointment of defense counsel for indigent defendants in felony cases [Gideon v.
Wainwright (1963)] and in misdemeanors [Argersinger v. Hamlin (1972)].
Public defender agencies normally are headed by a chief public defender ap-
pointed by the governor of the state or hired through state civil service and staffed by
salaried attorneys assigned to represent indigent defendants in appellate, trial, and
prisoners’ rights divisions. On the determination that an accused is indigent, the
judge appoints the public defender office to represent that person. Because public de-
fender offices are often understaffed, a number of cases are still assigned to private
counsel through the public defender agency or directly by the court.
V.
CORRECTIONS AGENCIES
Corrections agencies are responsible for jails and prisons. If a person is convicted of a
misdemeanor, that person may be jailed in the county or municipal jail. Jails are op-
erated under state guidelines but are the responsibility of the county or city govern-
ment. Some jails are operated by the sheriff’s department, others by the police
department, and still others by a staff of jail employees. Jailers are still elected in some
states, but most states use staff appointed by a county board or local police agency or
hired through civil service. Jails, of course, also are used to retain arrested suspects
pending court appearances. Many of our nation’s local jails are seriously over-
crowded and outmoded.
Most states and the federal government have a bureau of prisons or a department
of corrections responsible for operating the prisons within the standards established
by law. Prisons house the nation’s incarcerated felons and range from high-security
prisons for hard core, violent criminals to minimum-security prisons for nonviolent,
minimum risk criminals. Prison officials are usually civil service employees, but some
corrections officials are appointed.

probation:
a judicial sentence that per-
mits a convicted person to
remain free as long as that
person meets the conditions
imposed by the court.
Both the federal and state corrections systems have civil service probation and
parole supervisors to assist and supervise offenders placed on probation or parole.
Probation is a judicial sentence that permits a convicted person to remain free as long
as that person meets the conditions imposed by the court.
Parole may be awarded to prison inmates after they serve some of their prison
sentence. Parole release is usually reviewed and determined by an independent pa-
role board whose members normally are appointed by the executive office. The board
makes its decisions according to established guidelines for release. Parole has been
supplanted by supervised release in some states and in the federal correctional sys-
tem for all crimes committed after November 1, 1987. Supervised release generally
eliminates the use of parole boards.
VI.
CRIMINAL COURT SYSTEM
A.
COURT STRUCTURE
The state and federal court systems most often use the same courts and the same
judges for criminal matters as they do for civil matters, although some jurisdictions
have established a branch or division specializing in criminal cases. Drug courts are
one of the most recent developments in specialized courts. They are designed to help
drug addicts (not dealers) break the cycle of dependency through treatment methods
proven more effective than jail or prison. Drug courts are demonstrating considerable
success both in human terms and in costs to the taxpayer. Like drug courts, other spe-
cialized courts combine the expertise of judges, prosecutors, defense lawyers, police,
social workers, mental health workers, corrections personnel, and others to provide a
community-based approach to offenders, their families, and victims. Specialized
courts in some states include domestic violence, teen, repeat offender, mental health,
inmate reentry, and gun courts. Some states have a specialized appellate court for
criminal cases.
A criminal case enters at the trial court level and, if appealed, goes on to the in-
termediate or final appeals court. If the case is decided by the high court of the state
and if there are questions about federal law, including constitutional issues, it may be
accepted for appeal by the Supreme Court of the United States. Trends in both the fed-
eral and state courts include the electronic filing of case documents, electronic access
to criminal case files, and the equipping of courtrooms with state-of-the-art electronic
presentation, videoconferencing, and translation technology. Exhibit 2–1 presents a
diagram of the federal criminal court system.
B.
JURISDICTION
State courts have jurisdiction over violations of their state criminal law that occur
within the boundaries of the state. These courts are divided by counties, districts, or
parishes and hear cases arising in those respective geographical areas. State courts
also can consider state and federal constitutional questions.
The federal courts hear cases involving violations of federal criminal law and is-
sues arising under the Constitution of the United States. Federal criminal laws cover
crimes committed against federal officials, peace officers, foreign officials, and diplo-
mats; crimes committed on federal property; crimes committed in interstate com-
merce; crimes committed on the high seas (maritime law); customs violations; and
crimes related to federal regulatory laws, such as those involving federal banking reg-
ulations, securities laws, and others.
Military personnel are subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and if they
are accused of a crime, they are tried by military tribunals (courts-martial). Jurisdiction
parole:
release awarded to prison
inmates after they serve
some of their prison sen-
tence.

EXHIBIT 2–1
Federal Criminal
Courts
on Native American reservations is divided among tribal, state, and federal courts ac-
cording to the nature of the offense and the parties involved. When an offense is com-
mitted on federal property and there is no specified federal crime that punishes that
offense (such as a traffic crime), federal courts may apply appropriate state law and
punishment pursuant to the Assimilative Crimes Act, 18 U.S.C. § 13.
The Internet raises issues regarding what government, state or federal, has juris-
diction in particular circumstances. For example, does the federal government have
jurisdiction over an e-mail transmitted from one resident of Utah to another? Because
the transmission had to go from Utah to America OnLine facilities in Virginia and
then back to the victim in Utah, the court ruled that the transmission was in interstate
commerce, and the threat that was transmitted was a violation subject to federal ju-
risdiction [U.S. v. Kammersell (D. Utah 1998)].
C.
CRIMINAL PROCEDURE
In later chapters you will follow the step-by-step procedure of moving a case from
complaint through appellate review. For now, however, an overview of what happens
to cases as they progress through the system is shown in Exhibit 2–2, Tracking a Case
Through the Criminal Justice System.
Many crimes go unreported or undetected and never enter the system. Cases that
enter the system are observed by the police or reported to the police, who investigate
the matter. As the diagram indicates, several things can happen from that point.
On investigation, (1) the police are unable to solve the crime or decide not to ar-
rest the alleged perpetrator, (2) the perpetrator of the crime is a juvenile and enters the
juvenile justice system (a separate arm of the criminal justice system), or (3) the police
make an arrest. An arrest is the physical or implied seizure or taking into custody of
arrest:
the physical or implied
seizure or taking into cus-
tody of a person by police,
significantly restricting the
person’s freedom of move-
ment and subjecting him or
her to the authority of the
officer.

subjecting him or her to the authority of the officer. After arrest and some additional
investigation or interrogation, the suspect may be either booked or released.
If the suspect is booked, basic information, possibly including fingerprints, is
taken and personal property of the accused is inventoried and taken for safekeeping.
Here, exculpatory information may be disclosed that leads to the individual’s release
without further prosecution. It is also at this time that an individual may be released
with some preliminary bail deposit or on his or her own recognizance with a request
to report back to court for an initial appearance.
Whether released or jailed, the defendant appears before a magistrate or a judge
within a reasonable period of time for the initial appearance. The prosecutor’s office
must file charges before the initial appearance. There, the judge informs the accused
of those charges and also of his or her basic rights to an attorney and to remain silent.
The judge sets bail. Bail is the amount of money or property that a defendant must
post to be released while assuring the court that the defendant will return to court
when required to do so. If the defendant fails to appear as required, the bail money is
forfeited. Bail is set according to the seriousness of the crime and the likelihood of the
individual’s return at the next scheduled court appearance. In relatively minor
charges, a summary trial involving brief judicial inquiry of the suspect and the police
officers may be conducted to determine guilt. If guilt is found, the matter moves im-
mediately to sentencing. Some charges may be dropped or dismissed at the initial ap-
pearance after further review by the prosecutor’s office. It is also at the initial
appearance that the court may determine that the individual is indigent and will ap-
point counsel.
If the matter is a misdemeanor, it is scheduled for trial. If the crime is a felony, the
defendant normally has the right to a preliminary hearing to determine whether the
state can show that there is probable cause to believe that the defendant has com-
mitted the crime as charged. If the state fails to meet its burden at this stage, the
charges are dismissed but may be reinstated later based on additional evidence. If the
state meets its burden at the preliminary hearing, then the matter is moved forward
to an arraignment, then to trial, and, if necessary, sentencing.
In other jurisdictions, felony matters are referred to a grand jury as well as, or in
place of, the preliminary hearing. A grand jury is a body of citizens chosen from the
community at large that hears evidence regarding possible criminal activity and de-
cides whether that evidence is sufficient to bring an accused to trial. The grand jury
proceeding serves the same function as the preliminary hearing. At the grand jury
the prosecutor presents witnesses and evidence in support of the allegations. The de-
fendant does not have the right to be present at the grand jury or to testify. If the
grand jury determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the individ-
ual committed the crime, it indicts the accused, and the matter is referred to the next
stage of the process. If the grand jury believes that there is not sufficient evidence to
charge the individual, the matter may be dismissed at this point on a refusal to in-
dict. After the grand jury has heard the case or after the court has held a preliminary
hearing, charges may be amended from a felony to a misdemeanor. If so, the matter
usually is referred back to the misdemeanor division of the criminal court system.
If the judge at the preliminary hearing or the grand jury finds that sufficient
evidence exists to believe that the defendant committed the crime, then the de-
fendant is arraigned. An arraignment is an appearance before the judge where the
charges, as they stand after the preliminary hearing or the grand jury, are read. If
the charges come out of the preliminary hearing process, the charging document
is an information. If they are the product of the grand jury, the charging document
is an indictment. In addition to reading the charges, the judge asks the defendant
to enter a plea to the charge. If the plea is guilty, there is no trial and the matter
immediately moves to sentencing. If the plea is not guilty, the defendant is in-
formed of the right to a trial by jury and can elect whether to exercise that right or
waive the trial by jury and have the matter tried by a judge. At the arraignment

the judge also reconsiders any issue of bail and appoints an attorney for the de-

Prior to trial the case may end as a result of a plea bargain.Aplea bargain is a form
of negotiated settlement where the prosecutor reduces the charge, number of charges,
or the recommended sentence in return for the defendant’s plea of guilty. If the plea
bargain is accepted by the court, a plea is entered and the case goes to sentencing.
If it is necessary to go to trial, the state’s duty is to present witnesses and evidence
to prove that the defendant is guilty of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt
(See Exhibit 2–3). If during the course of the trial it becomes obvious that the state can-
not meet its burden of proof, the charges are dismissed. On completion of the trial, if
the judge or jury finds insufficient evidence to convict, the defendant is acquitted,
found not guilty of the crime. If the jury or the judge finds that the state has met its
burden of proof, the defendant is found guilty and the matter moves to sentencing.
At sentencing the court considers information relevant to the possible penalty
and then assesses the penalty. After sentencing, a judgment of guilt and sentence is
entered by the court. It is from this judgment that the defendant may appeal. On some
issues concerning procedure or other court error, it is possible that either side may
appeal the case, depending on which one is dissatisfied with the judgment. The ap-
peal is processed through the appellate court system.

Following sentencing, individuals enter the corrections phase of the system. They
may be placed on probation, fined, required to perform community service, or incar-
cerated in a county jail or in a penitentiary. If a prisoner feels that the case has been
mishandled or that an injustice has occurred, the prisoner may file for a writ of
habeas corpus. This is a writ that requires law enforcement to present the individual
before a judge to determine whether the person has been fairly convicted and incar-
cerated. The prisoner may be released as a result of this habeas corpus petition. If a
person on probation, parole, or supervised release violates its conditions, the condi-
tional release can be revoked and the person incarcerated. After completing the sen-
tence, the individual is released.

PROFESSIONAL ETHICS IN CRIMINAL LAW
PRACTICE
A.
INTRODUCTION
Surveys show that of the three branches of government, our judicial branch remains
the most arcane and misunderstood. The criminal justice system is no exception to
that unpleasant reality, even though crime receives much attention in our popular
media. The fact is that the members of the media largely misunderstand the system
and, therefore, do a poor job of educating the public. For this reason, most citizens do
not understand why “guilty” criminals deserve to be represented by an attorney, why
an attorney with any morals represents a “guilty” criminal, why judges dismiss cases
against “criminals” simply on “technicalities,” why expensive and time-consuming
juries are necessary, and why we go through so much trouble just to find someone
guilty whom “everyone already knows” is guilty.
Citizens need to be reminded regularly that this society places paramount im-
portance on preserving individual liberty. Any deprivation of that liberty through
punishment must be based on a fair determination of the truth. In the effort to find
that truth, we adopted the adversary system of justice.
B.
ADVERSARY SYSTEM
Both our civil and criminal systems rely heavily on the adversary system, a highly
competitive issue-resolving process in which two opposing sides attempt to provide
the best information they can to convince the neutral tribunal of judge or jury to de-
cide the issue in their favor. The system’s rationale stems from the belief that if two
opposed sides have much at stake in the outcome of the case, that stake will provide
them with motivation to research the law, find witnesses, and present the most per-
suasive information they can to the decision maker. The decision maker (judge or
jury) then has the best possible information submitted by the two opponents on
which to decide the matter. If only one side could present evidence or, even worse, if
a judge were responsible for both investigating and deciding a case, there might be
little motivation to find all the facts. Who is likely to be more motivated to do the
needed work, the person facing five years in prison or the judge who has heard it all
before? Also, the nonadversary judge might become more interested in getting infor-
mation to support conviction than in being impartial.
The adversary system, therefore, pits the prosecution, who represents the people,
against the defense, who represents the accused. In order for the system to work, eth-
ical attorneys for both sides must represent their clients zealously.2 Both sides must be
thoroughly prepared, follow every avenue that leads to information, and present the
best case for the client so that an impartial decision maker can make a fair judgment.
Though the theoretical heart of the adversary system is finding the truth, the sys-
tem is hardly free from criticism. Its extreme competitiveness creates considerable

stress for all participants, it invites unpleasant and sometimes demeaning confronta-
tion, its theoretical balance can be too easily tipped toward one side or the other, and
it may not be best suited for all types of cases. Nevertheless, the adversary system has
established a reasonably good record for fairness and justice.
C.
ROLE OF THE PROSECUTOR
To many, the prosecutor should be the champion of the people and the victim, and
must stop crime by getting every conviction possible. The prosecutor’s role, however,
is more complex than that. Standard 3-1.2(c) of the American Bar Association (ABA)
Standards for Criminal Justice (1993) states:
The duty of the prosecutor is to seek justice, not merely to convict.3
The Commentary to the standard elaborates:
Although the prosecutor operates within the adversary system, it is fundamental that
the prosecutor’s obligation is to protect the innocent as well as to convict the guilty, to
guard the rights of the accused as well as to enforce the rights of the public.4
Therefore, the adversarial duty of the prosecutor to pursue conviction zealously
must be restrained by the superseding duty to preserve fairness and to protect inno-
cence. In addition, the prosecutor is responsible for the prosecutorial arm of govern-
ment and the weighty decisions regarding when charges should be brought and for
what crime, and what degree of punishment should be recommended for the con-
victed. The prosecutor is charged with achieving a “fair, efficient, and effective en-
forcement of criminal law.”5 The duality of the prosecutor’s role is reflected in the
following ethical rules paraphrased from the ABA’s Model Rules of Professional Con-
duct and related ABA Standards for Criminal Justice:6
1.
A prosecutor should not exploit the office to gain personal publicity.
(Standard 3-1.3)
2.
It is unethical intentionally to misrepresent facts or mislead the court.
(Standard 3-2.9, Model Rule 3.3)
3.
The prosecutor must strive to avoid undue influence on the grand jury.
[Standard 3-3.5, Model Rule 3.3(d)]
4.
The prosecutor may pay witness expenses only; expert witnesses may be
paid expenses and fees. (Standard 3-3.2)
5.
If the prosecutor believes a witness’s conduct may be illegal, the witness
should be warned of possible incrimination and the need for an attorney.
(Standard 3-3.2)
6.
The prosecutor should avoid relationships that cast doubt on the
independence and integrity of the office. (Standard 3-2.8)
7.
The prosecutor should not seek to influence opinion of an expert witness.
(Standard 3-3.3)
8.
The prosecutor should not knowingly use or instruct others to use illegal
means to obtain evidence or obstruct communication between a potential
witness and defense counsel. (Standards 3-3.1, Model Rule 4.4)
9.
The prosecutor should recommend to a grand jury that they not indict if
the grand jury believes the evidence does not warrant indictment.
(Standard 3-3.6)
10.
It is unethical to bring charges the prosecutor knows are without sufficient
admissible evidence or to “seek charges greater in number or degree” than
evidence will reasonably support. [Standard 3-3.9, Model Rule 3.8(a)]
11.
The prosecutor shall not seek an unrepresented defendant’s waiver of
rights. [Model Rule 3.8(c)]
12.
It is unethical to avoid investigating leads favorable to the accused.
(Standard 3-3.11)

38
■
CHAPTER 2
13.
The prosecutor cannot obstruct an opponent’s access to evidence. (Model
Rule 3.4)
14.
The prosecutor must reveal to the defense in a timely fashion all evidence
tending to negate guilt or reduce punishment of the accused. [Standard 3-
3.11, Model Rule 3.8(d)]
15.
It is unethical “to knowingly offer false evidence” or not to seek its
withdrawal once discovered. (Standard 3-5.6)
16.
The prosecutor should not use the power of cross-examination to discredit
a witness he or she knows is telling the truth. (Standard 3-5.7)
17.
It is unethical when addressing a jury to express opinions on the “truth or
falsity of evidence or guilt of defendant.” (Standard 3-5.8, Model Rule 3.4)
18.
The prosecutor should not always seek the severest penalty, but should
seek a fair and informed judgment. [Standard 3-6.1, Model Rule 3.8(d)]
The proper role of the prosecutor goes well beyond our society’s need for ag-
gressive prosecution of crime to encompass responsibilities both to the accused
and to a fair system of justice. These responsibilities reflect some of humanity’s
highest aspirations, but in practice they are difficult to balance and are often mis-
understood by the public. Consequently, the prosecutor is at the same time hon-
ored and burdened by the expectation to be all things for all people while
providing a vital service to the community. Prosecutors have recently come under
increased scrutiny because of instances of unethical conduct, such as hiding or de-
stroying evidence.7 Consequently, more courts are holding that prosecutors who
overstep the bounds are subject to civil liability.8 Your awareness of the dual na-
ture of the prosecutor’s job and its strict ethical standards are critical to the suc-
cessful performance of your job.
D.
ROLE OF THE DEFENSE ATTORNEY
In an adversary system that is deliberately weighted to protect the innocent by plac-
ing the obligation on the state to prove that the defendant is guilty, it is the role and
ethical duty of the defense attorney to put the state to the test of its proof. Regardless
of any admission of guilt on the part of the defendant or of how heinous the crime ac-
cused, defense counsel has the obligation to represent the client zealously and coura-
geously and has the right to put the government to its proof. Without such a test for
the benefit of each defendant, all of us would eventually lose our right to be presumed
innocent; all of us would be vulnerable to a failing, one-sided system in which due
process would be a farce.
Even though the prosecutor has a duty to see that justice is done, it is the defense
attorney who is likely to raise issues such as illegal investigation methods, illegal
searches and seizures, unfair lineups, unconstitutional criminal laws, improper judi-
cial decisions and procedures, illegal incarceration, and others. These objections often
address serious invasions of a citizen’s right to privacy, freedom of religion or speech,
the right to a fair trial, the right to freedom from cruel and unusual punishment, the
right to equal protection under the laws, and other rights absolutely essential to the
preservation of individual liberty and dignity. It is the defense counsel who has the
duty to challenge any overreaching of police, prosecutor, judge, and system to pre-
vent the erosion of the rights of all citizens. For this reason the defense lawyer needs
to be ever vigilant and aggressive.
Advocacy is not for the timid, the meek, or the retiring. Our system of justice is
inherently contentious, albeit bounded by the rules of professional ethics and decorum,
and it demands that the lawyer be inclined toward vigorous advocacy.9
Few of us will ever be wrongfully accused of a crime, so it is difficult to take seri-
ously the need for such defense safeguards, but innocent individuals accused of

■39
crimes exist in greater numbers than most people realize, and not just on television or
in novels. One sobering statistic helps make the point. Because of wrongful convic-
tions, more than 100 death row inmates have been freed since 1973.10
The defense lawyer is not subject to every whim or direction of the client. The de-
fense lawyer must exercise firm, independent, professional judgment in order to be
an effective advisor and representative.11
Because the role of the defense counsel, like that of the prosecutor, is so crucial to
a fair system of justice, and because inevitable conflicts arise, the ABA Standards for
Criminal Justice and the Model Rules address the conduct of the defense attorney. A
paraphrase of some of the more significant standards and rules for defense counsel
follows:12
1.
It is unethical to misrepresent matters of fact or law or assist a client in
committing perjury. (Standard 4-1.2, Model Rules 3.3, 3.4, and 4.1)
2.
Defense counsel should avoid unnecessary delay and be punctual in
submitting all briefs, motions, and other papers. [Standard 4-1.3(b), Model
Rule 3.2]
3.
Defense counsel should not accept more cases than can be discharged
giving each client effective representation. [Standard 4-1.3(e), Model Rule
1.16(a)(1)]
4.
It is unethical to make an agreement to have law enforcement or court
personnel or bondsmen refer potential clients to the lawyer or to divide
a fee with a nonlawyer, or to approach people with the purpose of
having them employ the lawyer. [Standard 4-2.3, Model Rules 4-3.3(d),
5.4, and 7.3]
5.
Defense counsel should try to develop a “relationship of trust and
confidence with accused,” explaining that the accused needs to disclose all
facts and that the confidentiality of those facts will be held inviolate.
(Standard 4-3.1, Model Rule 1.6)
6.
It is unethical in criminal cases to loan the fee to a client, charge a fee
contingent on results, or charge a fee that is excessive. [Standard 4-3.3(c)]
7.
It is unethical while representing the client in a particular case to enter into
an agreement for publication rights with respect to the case or to speak to
the media with the intention of materially prejudicing the proceeding.
(Standard 4-3.4, Model Rule 3.6)
8.
Defense counsel must refrain from conflicts of interest or inform the client
of such conflicts and proceed only with the client’s permission and the
lawyer’s belief that conflicts will not affect the lawyer’s loyalty to the
client. [Standard 4-3.5(a), Model Rule 1.7]
9.
Defense counsel should not represent more than one defendant in the
same criminal case unless it is clear that conflicts of interest between the
defendants are unlikely, and each defendant gives permission to the joint
representation. (Standard 4-3.5, Model Rule 1.7)
10.
It is unethical to defend a criminal case in which the lawyer’s partner or
associate is or has been the prosecutor. [Standard 4-3.5(d)]
11.
It is unethical “to counsel a client in or knowingly assist a client to engage
in conduct which the lawyer knows to be illegal or fraudulent.” [Standard
4-3.7(b)]
12.
Defense counsel should keep the client informed of all developments in
the case. (Standard 4-3.8)
13.
It is unethical knowingly to use illegal means to investigate a case or to
hire, instruct, or urge others to do so. (Standard 4-4.2, Model Rule 4.4)
14.
It is not necessary for a defense attorney to inform a witness that counsel
suspects is guilty of criminal activity of that witness’s right against
incrimination or the need for counsel. [Standard 4-4.3(c)]

40
■
CHAPTER 2
15.
It is unethical to obstruct communication between a witness and the
prosecution or not to correct a witness’s misunderstanding of what the
lawyer represents. [Standard 4-4.3(d), Model Rules 3.4 and 4.3]
16.
Defense counsel should comply in good faith with all discovery requests.
(Standard 4-4.5, Model Rule 3.4)
17.
Defense counsel must not recommend that the defendant accept a plea
bargain or otherwise enter a plea of guilty, even if the defendant admits guilt,
without an investigation of the applicable law and facts. (Standard 4-6.1)
18.
It is unethical in plea bargaining to favor one client at the expense of
another. (Standard 4-6.2)
19.
It is not unethical at trial for defense counsel to attempt to undermine the
testimony of a witness that the attorney believes is telling the truth if it is
for the purpose of putting the state to its proof. (Standard 4-7.6, Model
Rule 3.1)
20.
It is unethical for a lawyer to falsify evidence, to counsel or assist a witness
to lie, or to offer an illegal inducement to a witness. [Model Rule 3.4(b)]
21.
It is unethical to advertise services in a manner that is misleading or
“likely to create unjustified expectation.” (Model Rule 7.1)
22.
Defense counsel “should not intentionally misstate the evidence or
mislead a jury” or express a personal opinion on innocence or the truth or
falsity of any evidence. (Standard 4-7.7)
An additional source for standards and materials for defense attorneys is the Na-
tional Legal Aid and Defender Association in Washington, D.C.
E.
ROLE OF THE JUDGE
The judge’s role in criminal matters is essential for the system to work with proper
dignity, fairness, and efficiency. According to the ABA Standards for Criminal Justice
(1980), the judge’s responsibilities include
a.
safeguarding the defendant’s rights;
b.
preserving the interests of the public;
c.
avoiding both the reality and appearance of any conflict of interest or bias;
d.
respecting the role of both prosecution and defense;
e.
preserving constitutional standards when reviewing search and arrest
warrant applications and important proceedings.
Despite such standards, a few judges, like some attorneys, are either unaware of
their ethical obligations or are indifferent to them. Headlines report judicial impro-
prieties ranging from insensitive and abusive conduct to extortion and corruption. Ju-
dicial commissions investigate complaints against judges, apply the relevant state
standards, and recommend sanctions, including removal from the bench.
One of the foundations of judicial ethics is judicial independence, objective, impar-
tial decision-making free of political, personal, and corrupt influences, including those
of special interest groups. Campaign contributions from attorneys, businesses, and reli-
gious and other special interests raise the specter of undue influence. Political affiliations,
cronyism, and stated views on emotionally charged issues such as abortion and the
death penalty cause similar concern regarding judicial appointments. Some states re-
stricted judicial candidates from expressing their views on issues likely to come before
them if elected, but the Supreme Court overturned those restrictions in Republican Party
of Minnesota v. White (2002). Free speech trumped the concern that such statements
would commit a candidate to a position before ruling on the issue as a sitting judge, from
whom the parties are entitled to a fair and impartial review. Canon 3.E(1)(f) of the ABA
Model Code of Judicial Conduct (2004) states that a judge shall disqualify him or herself
where the judge has made a public statement as a judge or judicial candidate that com-
mits or appears to commit the judge to a position on a matter before the court.

14.
Draft posttrial motions.
15.

16.
Serve as resource person for defendant, family, and witnesses.
Paralegals may also perform miscellaneous administrative and related functions,
as follows:
1.
Prepare office and procedural manuals.
2.
Design and prepare office practice systems manuals.
3.
Manage and supervise paralegals and other office personnel.
4.
Perform other duties involving legal administration.
Although these are the most common duties of criminal law paralegals, other of-
fices may require other tasks. In the Attorney General’s office paralegals help inves-
tigate cases, file criminal charges, and do research and drafting in support of the
appellate process. Paralegals are working in child support enforcement programs associ-
ated with many prosecutors’ offices. Their duties include office administration, draft-
ing legal forms, finding parents who are delinquent in child support payments, and
preparing documents necessary to prosecute those delinquent parents.
Paralegals also work as pretrial release officers, interviewing individuals who have
been arrested and jailed to determine whether there are grounds to have them re-
leased on bail prior to their first appearance. On gathering information about the
jailed individual, the pretrial officer makes a recommendation to the court regarding
the amount of bail required for release of this individual.
Some paralegals are employed as mediation officers who take minor criminal mat-
ters and bring both parties together to determine whether there is some fair and rea-
sonable resolution. For example, mediation of a dispute between neighbors leading
to a disorderly conduct charge may be preferable to a full-fledged trial. Adversarial
court battles often make matters worse, particularly for people who must return to
the same neighborhood.
Paralegals working as sentencing specialists may work in defense offices or be called
in to prepare a sentencing recommendation more favorable to the defendant than that
recommended by the prosecution or probation officer. The recommendation is based
on intensive investigation into the defendant’s background and circumstances.
In addition, paralegals are employed in government agencies at all levels of both
the state and federal government. These administrative agencies have rules and regu-
lations that carry criminal or quasi-criminal penalties for violations of such things as
fair labor standards, food and drug administration standards, or civil rights. In such
offices, paralegals primarily perform investigations and prepare documents in sup-
port of any action that might be taken against the offender. Paralegals also perform
supportive functions for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, police agencies at both
the state and federal level, and in the Department of Justice. More recently paralegals
have been hired in juvenile support services and as victim and spouse abuse advocates.

Introduction
Soon you will be working with cases and the people involved in those cases. In deal-
ing with others, be ever mindful of the high standard of professional ethics to which
your actions must conform. Professional ethics as applied to attorneys are the rules
of conduct that govern the practice of law. It is the responsibility of each person work-
ing in the law office to know what is expected and to act accordingly. A breach of eth-
professional ethics:

ical standards will reflect badly on the entire office and also may lead to the disbar-
ment of one or more attorneys. It may cost you your job and subject you to prosecu-
tion for the unauthorized practice of law.

What a Paralegal May Not Do
Except as specifically permitted by law, paralegals may not perform any of the fol-
lowing functions:
1.
Provide legal services directly to the public without the supervision of a
licensed attorney.
2.
Give legal advice or counsel a client. Legal advice is independent
professional judgment based on knowledge of the law and given for the
benefit of a particular client. It may be offered only by an attorney.
3.
Represent a client in court or other tribunal or otherwise act as an advocate
for a client.
4.

Giving legal advice, item 2, is a particularly dangerous pitfall for paralegals. The
question as to which judge would be best to try a case calls for knowledge about how
judges have applied the law in the past, and for judgment about how that impacts on
a particular case. Thus, answering that question would be giving legal advice. If the
case is already assigned to a judge, however, asking which judge has been assigned
to the case calls for factual information that is a matter of public record and requires
no exercise of legal judgment. Thus, this question does not call for legal advice. Can
a paralegal answer a question, for example, as to whether a repeat offender (three
strikes) law exists in a given state? This is less clear. The answer is a matter of public
record (the statutes) and requires no exercise of judgment. Nevertheless, some attor-
neys are uncomfortable with a paralegal answering such a question.
3.
What a Paralegal May Do
Unmet legal needs will be the basis for a continuing debate as to whether paralegals
should be permitted to provide limited legal services directly to the public. Currently
paralegals may perform a wide array of tasks and be confident their work will not cre-
ate a breach of ethics if it meets certain criteria. A paralegal may be designated to ren-
der service under the following conditions:
1.
The task must be delegated by an attorney.
2.
The task must be performed under an attorney’s supervision.
3.
Paralegals must clearly designate their status as a paralegal.
4.
The lawyer must retain a direct relationship with the client (the attorney
must retain control over the relationship).
5.
The task must involve information gathering or be ministerial and cannot
involve the rendering of legal advice or judgment (unless the legal advice
or judgment is provided by the paralegal directly to the attorney).
6.
The work must be given final approval or be examined by the attorney.
7.
The work must not have a separate identity but must merge with the
attorney’s final work product.
In addition, a paralegal may have a business card with the firm’s name on it as
long as the paralegal is designated as such.

4.
Confidentiality, Honesty, and Conflict of Interest
Paralegal ethical standards, for all practical purposes, are the same as those for attor-
neys. Attorneys, not paralegals, are subject to discipline by the bar for ethical
breaches. Paralegals, however, are bound by the nature of their work to uphold each
rule as if they were the attorney.
Attorneys are bound by the ethical standards set by their state’s highest court.
Most states have adopted all or parts of the ABA’s Model Rules of Professional Con-
duct. Some states, however, continue to rely primarily on the ABA’s Model Code of
Professional Responsibility. Because of these differences, obtain a copy of your state’s
version of the ethical standards. The included commentaries are extremely helpful for
analyzing ethics issues.
A paralegal shall hold inviolate the confidences of a client. Except with written
permission by the client, nothing the client tells you or that you learn about the client
may be revealed to anyone outside the office, not even to a spouse or parent. In addi-
tion, to preserve confidentiality, a client’s statement to you or other employees of the
firm should not be made in the presence of outsiders. Careless use of cell phones, fax
machines, and e-mail has resulted in breaches of client confidentiality. In either a pros-
ecutor’s office or a defender’s office, treat each case and its contents as confidential.
Under rule 1.6 of the ABA’s Model Rules of Professional Conduct, an attorney
may breach client confidentiality to prevent “reasonably certain death or bodily
harm.” Eleven states require such disclosure, forty-one states permit or mandate dis-
closure of any crime, and eleven states permit disclosure of a noncriminal fraud.14
A paralegal must maintain the highest standards of professional integrity and
avoid any dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation. This rule applies to all deal-
ings with clients, judges, court employees, opposing attorneys, and the public. A
paralegal was permitted to sue for wrongful discharge for declining to be involved in
fraudulent billing practices [Brown v. Hammond (E.D. Pa. 1993)].
A paralegal must avoid and reveal any conflict of interest. A conflict of interest
arises when there are two significant and opposed matters of duty or allegiance,
where to act favorably on one of the matters will or may appear to be detrimental to
the other. A lawyer and, thus, a paralegal must be loyal to the client and avoid con-
flicts that split or dilute allegiance to the client. At the prosecutor’s office, the public
is the client, and a conflict of interest occurs, for example, if a paralegal on a case is re-
lated to the defendant in that case.
A conflict of interest occurs if a private firm representing Lacey Rude (Case III)
accepts the assignment to defend Cat Bermuda. In this situation, Ms. Bermuda might
get an offer for a reduced sentence if she testified that Rude had stolen the artifact be-
fore Bermuda did. The firm cannot do the best for both clients. Therefore, the second
client must not be accepted.
Another conflict of interest arises if a prosecution paralegal has a financial inter-
est in a local business, and the principal owners are being prosecuted for criminal ac-
tivity. It is obvious that the paralegal may hesitate to do the best job possible when the
outcome of the case may have an adverse effect on the paralegal’s income. In such a
situation, the paralegal must inform the supervising attorney of the conflict and be re-
moved from the case.
Athird type of conflict of interest occurs when a paralegal changes jobs from one law
office to another. If the paralegal worked on behalf of Miguel Cordoba (Case II) at a pri-
vate firm, but now must handle the case against Mr. Cordoba at the prosecutor’s office,
it is likely that confidential information gained from Mr. Cordoba while working for the
first firm will be used against him at the second office. Again, the paralegal must inform
the supervising attorney and be removed from any involvement in any cases against Mr.
Cordoba. Generally, it is only necessary to screen the paralegal from anything having to
do with the new firm’s handling of such a case, rather than to disqualify the entire office
[Model Rules of Professional Conduct 1.10 cmt. 4 (2002); Leibowitz v. Eighth Judicial

giance, where to act favor-
ably on one of the matters

C.
OTHER PROFESSIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
There are some professional ethics that are not found in the codes, but are neverthe-
less quite important. Mutual respect and loyalty between employer and employees is
vital. Public criticism of one’s fellow workers is not consistent with professional loy-
alty. That is also true regarding crime victims as well as defense clients who deserve
the utmost courtesy, respect, and every effort on your part to preserve their dignity.
Professional loyalty to the office extends to the practice of law, which supersedes
loyalty to any specific individual. Attorneys are expected to call attention to the un-
ethical practices of other attorneys, or in some instances, of their own clients. Simi-
larly, a paralegal must be prepared to report unethical behavior to the appropriate
person within the office.
In addition, paralegals must strive to be competent and current in the field. Firms
also appreciate assistance in efforts to provide free legal services to the poor, called
pro bono cases.
Study ethics in more detail as you learn other paralegal tasks. The more you know
about the ethical responsibilities of the attorney and paralegal, the more likely you
will spot and avoid trouble. The standards and ethical rules are covered only in part
in this chapter for the prosecutor, the defense attorney, and the judge. These rules and
the guidelines set out for the paralegal should become a part of your personal aware-
ness of what is expected of both attorney and paralegal. For all practical purposes,
what binds and limits the attorney, binds and limits the paralegal.
D.
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT
Professionals, including paralegals, continually take steps to improve themselves and
their professions. You are encouraged to actively pursue your own professional
development. Be informed on the progress and issues concerning the paralegal pro-
fession; attend continuing education seminars; seek leadership and other service po-
sitions in paralegal associations; support progressive paralegal education of high
quality; and subscribe to literature that is pertinent to and will benefit your career. A

CONCLUSION
As a paralegal working within the criminal justice system, you are likely to have con-
tact with people from several branches of the system: law enforcement, prosecution,
defense, corrections, and courts. Understanding each of these components will help
you master your own part of the system. A grasp of the rationale behind the adver-
sary system gives you a basis for some of the procedural and ethical demands of the
field. The roles of the officers of the court follow from those demands. Finally, it comes
down to where you, the paralegal, fit into the system and into the limits, responsibil-
ities, and expectations of your profession.
As you learn more about criminal law and work on the cases that are assigned to
you, keep in mind that you are an important component in the criminal justice system.
Your understanding of the system and your approach to your work in it can make a dif-
ference in the lives of real people and in the success of the system in achieving justice.

CHAPTER 3
I.
INTRODUCTION
This chapter focuses on the substantive law principles that define criminal liability.
The components of a crime are
1.
Harm or likely harm—an injury or likely injury.
2.
Actus reus—a guilty act.
3.
Mens rea—a guilty mind.
4.
Causation—that the harm or likely harm is a direct result of the guilty act.
An understanding of any specific crime and the paralegal tasks related to it is
based on a grasp of these components. From them are drawn the elements that must
be proven beyond a reasonable doubt by the prosecution in court.
Harm is usually placed after actus reus and mens rea in the consideration of com-
ponents of crimes, but it is placed first here for three reasons. A discussion of harm is
basic to the classification of crimes, harm is often the first component that is apparent
when a crime has been committed, and harm is the reason that specific conduct has
been criminalized.
After the discussion of the four components, we look at the principles of com-
plicity, and vicarious and corporate liability. The concepts presented in this chap-
ter, taken together, provide the basic tools for assessing and assigning criminal
liability.
II.
HARM OR LIKELY HARM: THE CLASSIFICATION
OF CRIMES
Harm is the actual damage, injury, or loss that must occur as a result of an act for that
act to be considered criminal. The one harmed can be as specific as an individual per-
son or piece of property, or as general as society as a whole.
Harm plays a significant role in the orderly classification of crime and the result-
ing assessment of penalties. The harms caused by criminal acts are divided first into
broad general categories according to the direct object of the crime—life, habitation,
property, public order, and public morality—and then ranked in that descending or-
der based on the perception, for example, that the permanent taking of a life is more
serious than the temporary disruption of public order. The respective penalties de-
crease with the seriousness of the harm.
Each of these broad categories is further divided by the nature of the act—
crimes against life are divided into murder, kidnapping, battery, and so on; and
crimes against habitation are divided into burglary and arson. These crimes may
then be subdivided further according to the seriousness of the degree of mens rea.
Thus murder is usually subdivided into first degree (purposeful intent), second
degree (knowing intent), third degree (reckless intent), and fourth degree (negli-
gent intent). Alternatively, the various gradations may be stated as class A, B, C,
or D felonies or A, B, C, or D misdemeanors. These crimes may be subdivided fur-
ther into completed or attempted crimes, with attempted crimes in that class hav-
ing lighter penalties than completed crimes based on the fact that less harm has
occurred.
Attempted crimes and other “incomplete” crimes such as conspiracy or posses-
sion do not require that harm has occurred. In these cases, the potential for harm is
considered serious enough to warrant intervention. Incomplete or inchoate crimes are
covered in Chapter 6.

Components of a Crime

III.
ACTUS REUS
A.
INTRODUCTION
Actus reus means wrongful or guilty act. It has long been a requirement of the law
that a crime must be manifested by some act: striking with a fist or a club, pulling the
trigger of a gun, physically delivering cocaine to another. The rationale behind the re-
quirement of an act has several components. The first is that mere thoughts are hard
to determine and harder yet to prove. As a medieval judge said, “The thought of man
is not triable, for the devil himself knoweth not the thought of man.”1 A physical act
is overt; it can be seen, heard, and felt. It has obvious detectable consequences. It can
be proved.
Second, thoughts do not cause harm and may be simply the product of day-
dreaming or fantasy. Because we have been given minds and imaginations that en-
tertain thoughts both good and bad, a law that punished for thoughts alone would or
could ensnare us all. The act establishes the line of demarcation between mere
thought and the physical steps toward causing actual harm.
Third, and very critical to a democratic society, is the fact that punishment for
thought alone practically guarantees abusive power in the hands of police, law en-
forcement, and other governmental officials. The requirement that there be evidence
beyond a reasonable doubt of some “guilty” act limits their discretion and, thus, their
action and helps preserve the liberty and dignity of innocent people. Think of the
thousands of people who have been executed or tortured for being witches, heretics,
or political dissenters. In some societies thoughts free of actions are still subject to
persecution and prosecution. The requirement of a criminal act prevents the law from
harassing individuals based on their status (who they are), for example, alcoholics,
drug addicts, or people of a specific race, sexual orientation, or religion.
Fourth, the act must be defined as wrongful or criminal in the context of the sur-
rounding circumstances and consequences. For instance, pulling the trigger on a
loaded gun is not criminal in itself, but pulling the trigger of a gun while aiming at a
person strongly suggests the desire to kill that person. Harmful consequences are
most apparent. Therefore, actus reus is determined not only by the physical act or
omission, but also by the circumstances and the consequential harm.
B.
VOLUNTARY AND INVOLUNTARY ACTS
The criminal act must be voluntary, a product of free will, such as pulling a trigger on
a gun or reaching into a cash drawer and grasping money. Where there is a duty to
act, the failure to act also must be voluntary. In other words, the accused could have
refrained from pulling the trigger or could have reported the accident but did not.
If an act is not voluntary, however, criminal liability may not attach. Circumstances
when criminal liability does not attach include coerced action (A holds a pistol to the
head of B and says, “You forge this check or die”), reflex action (while driving a car, A
is attacked by bees and the car goes out of control and causes injury), muscle contrac-
tion or paralysis caused by disease, and unconsciousness or impaired consciousness. A
sleep walker (somnambulist) who kills her daughter with an axe while dreaming a
rapist was attacking her daughter is not liable, because the act occurred in a semicon-
scious (involuntary) state.2 Other conditions such as comas, high fevers, hypoglycemia,
or temporary brain damage (concussion) may result in involuntary but harmful actions
or inactions. Expert witnesses who said a defendant could have killed in his sleep did
not prevent his murder conviction, however, when he stabbed his wife forty-four times
and held her head under the water in their swimming pool, then hid evidence and
actus reus:
wrongful or guilty act.

CHAPTER 3
bandaged his cut finger.3 Hypnosis in theory and in fiction can cause a person to do
things they would not ordinarily do. Medical authorities, however, argue that a person
cannot be hypnotically induced to do things that the person believes are wrong.4
One reason involuntary behavior is not punished is because it bears no relation-
ship to the purposes of criminal law, especially deterrence. Nevertheless, a person
who is semiconscious from voluntarily consuming excessive amounts of intoxicants
is generally not free of criminal liability for acts committed while semiconscious. Sim-
ilarly, a person who voluntarily drives a vehicle knowing he or she is subject to epilep-
tic seizures is criminally responsible for harm created as a result of a seizure while
operating the vehicle.
Some acts are less clearly “acts” than others. Words, for example, can be acts suf-
ficient for criminal penalties to attach. Conspiracy and threats are just two examples
of words as acts.
C.
OMISSIONS
The main purpose of criminal law is to prevent harm. Because most harm is caused
by overt physical action, omission, or the failure to act, is generally not a crime.5
When there is a legal duty to act, however, omission of that act is the actus reus of the
offense. Not paying taxes owed, for example, is as harmful as embezzling the same
amount of money; allowing a child in one’s care to starve is as harmful as beating it.
The duty to act is required by the following factors.
■
By Statute
A duty to act can be imposed by both civil and criminal
statutes. Most states require a person involved in an accident to stay at the
scene of an accident and render aid to the other party. Good Samaritan laws
in some states require people to act if they see someone in distress. Health
and safety laws require employers to maintain safe working conditions. All
states require professionals who work with children to report child abuse
and neglect to authorities. Eighteen states require all citizens to make such
reports. Failure to do so is a crime. 6
■
By Contract
Similarly, the law imposes criminal liability for failure to act
where the duty to act is contracted. A lifeguard is hired and paid to protect
others. Failure to go to the aid of a drowning person under the lifeguard’s
supervision is a crime, often punishable through homicide statutes, the de-
gree depending on the intent of the guard. Another example is the failure of
a ship captain to render necessary emergency assistance to the ship’s passen-
gers. Omission by a nurse or a doctor also may lead to criminal liability.
■
By Special Relationship
If one stands in a special relationship to another,
such as parent to child, spouse to spouse, or guardian to ward, a duty of ren-
dering assistance is imposed by law. Failure to feed, clothe, and otherwise
care properly for a child constitutes the crime of neglect. If the child becomes
ill and dies as a result of the neglect, the parent or guardian is guilty of some
degree of criminal homicide. A mother who sat by while her husband beat
her seven-year-old daughter to death was found guilty of first degree mur-
der in Florida.7
■
By Volunteering
There are times when one can voluntarily assume a duty.
For example, if a person agrees to watch a child and the child drowns, or if
the child needs emergency medical attention and the person fails to render
assistance, that person may be charged with criminal homicide. There does
not need to be a contract or payment involved for liability to attach. Crimi-
nal liability also can attach when a person voluntarily goes to the rescue of
another, then stops at a time that precludes others from rendering assistance.
For example, a swimmer is drowning and a bystander takes the only avail-
able boat to the rescue, then three-quarters of the way stops and it is too late
omission:
failure to act.

ANALYSIS PROBLEM
3–1.
Have we reached the time in our society when people say “I do not
want to get involved” so often that we need to legislate a general duty to res-
cue? What are some difficulties? Does a poor person have the same duty to
rescue a starving beggar as a rich person? Should a poor swimmer have as
great a duty to rescue a drowning person as an excellent swimmer? What
about a mediocre swimmer?
for anyone else to reach the swimmer. If the swimmer drowns, the bystander
may be guilty of criminal homicide. In a similar situation, a woman who
voluntarily cared for a child but isolated the child and seldom fed, bathed,
or cared for it had a duty of care, and incurred criminal liability when the
baby died [Jones v. U.S. (D.C. Cir. 1962)].
■
By Placing the Victim in Peril
Failure to render assistance can be criminal
when a person’s criminal or negligent act places the victim in peril and in
need of assistance, and the perpetrator fails to render assistance. In People v.
Oliver (Cal. App. 1989), the defendant took an intoxicated man from a bar to
her home, facilitated his heroin use there, and, when he collapsed, had him
dragged outside where he was found dead the following morning. Because
the defendant removed the victim from a place where he might have found
aid from others and facilitated his drug use, she was responsible for placing
him in peril. Thus, she created a duty of care, requiring her to seek help for
him after he collapsed. Her conviction for involuntary manslaughter was
affirmed.

The law imposes criminal liability for the minimal act of possession, the acquisition
of something and then the failure to get rid of it. Possession is an exception to the gen-
eral rule that the law punishes for acts that cause harm, as well as the rule that the law
punishes people for what they have done as opposed to what they might do. It is clear
that possession of a concealed weapon is not harmful, and it is equally clear that it is
conjecture that the weapon will be used to cause harm. Yet, most state legislatures
have decided that the gain to society of easier law enforcement and the prevention of
crime justify possession as a basis for criminal liability.
Criminal possession addresses the physical control of two classes of objects, one
unlawful and the other lawful. Unlawful objects include various weapons, illegal
drugs, wiretapping devices, stolen property, obscene materials, and others. Criminal
liability attaches to possession of lawful items such as crowbars and wire cutters
(burglary tools) or drug paraphernalia, only when combined with the intent to com-
mit an unlawful act.8
Actual possession requires that the object be on the person, under direct physi-
cal control, or within reach. Usually the act of actual possession must be coupled with
knowledge. For example, a postal delivery person who unwittingly possesses a mail
bomb in the act of delivering it would not be guilty of criminal possession. Some
statutes, however, do not require any knowledge. Possession alone is well accepted
as a proper basis for criminal prosecution.
Criminal liability is also assessed for constructive possession, knowledge of
where an illegal item is and control of that area. Therefore, a person can be convicted
for possession if illegal drugs are found in a closet in the person’s house or in the glove
compartment of the person’s car.
constructive possession:
knowledge of where an item
is and control of that area.

CHAPTER 3
mens rea:
a wrongful state of mind or
the intent to commit a crime.
Common problems raised in constructive possession occur when there is more
than one person in the room or car. Who then should be charged? The law varies in
these instances. Depending on circumstances, all those present may be charged, but
more than likely the person in charge of the car or room will incur the liability. It gets
more confusing when the room is jointly controlled, such as by spouses, or room-
mates. Possession, and especially constructive possession, creates the very real prob-
lem of potentially convicting innocent persons.
Though convenient for law enforcement, possession laws reach back far earlier in
the alleged criminal preparation process than most other crimes, to where harm has
not yet occurred; thus, there is more potential for innocent conduct to be charged. For
this reason some scholars argue that possession should be a crime only when it in-
volves the most dangerous of items, explosives and weapons, for example, as op-
posed to the more innocuous burglary tools.
E.
STATUS
In the past, some jurisdictions took things a step further by trying to make it unnec-
essary even to show possession. Laws created criminal liability for being an alcoholic,
drug addict, or homosexual. All that was necessary for conviction was one’s reputa-
tion or status. No immediate act of harm was required. This type of thinking has led
to statutes that criminalize loitering, vagrancy, or the inability to identify oneself ad-
equately to police. Fortunately, because such laws tend to encroach on legitimate free-
doms and give the police too much discretion, they have been declared illegal. It is
along this front that law-and-order proponents and civil libertarians have fought for
decades. Battles also have involved the prosecution of drug-addicted women whose
babies die or suffer severe withdrawal shortly after birth.
IV.
MENS REA
A.
INTRODUCTION
An act is not generally criminal unless it is accompanied by the state of mind neces-
sary to separate that act from the realm of innocent conduct. This culpable mentality
is the component of mens rea, a wrongful state of mind or the intent to commit a
crime. The law has long recognized the difference between intentional wrongs and
unavoidable ones. Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., said, “Even a dog distinguishes be-
tween being stumbled over and being kicked.”9
Since the workings of the mind are not obvious, the proof of mens rea depends
on the circumstances surrounding the act. For example, in a trial for molestation of a
juvenile, the defendant’s prurient statement to a young girl, not the victim, was ad-
missible to demonstrate the defendant’s “lustful disposition toward young victims,”
showing intent, preparation, plan, or knowledge of the offense charged [State v. Miller
(La. 1998)]. Although such evidence is being more widely allowed in abuse cases, the
general rule is closer to that expressed by the opinion in Wall v. State (Ga. 1998) that
to be used as evidence, prior acts must show more than just “bad character.” The de-
fendant’s admission of previous cocaine use was relevant to character, but not to
prove intent to distribute the cocaine that was in closed packages she was hired to re-
ceive and forward in U.S. v. Jenkins (6th Cir. 2003). There was no evidence that the de-
fendant knew what was in the packages. Proof of intent also lies in other behavior
before and during the commission of the offense.
Motive, which figures so prominently in classic detective stories, is not the same
as criminal intent, but the reason behind the intent. “Motive is not an element of the
crime, but is instead only a circumstance for consideration by the jury,” according to
the decision in State v. Washington (Mo. App. 1986). Banking records showed the vic-
tim’s wife had access to enough money to hire the defendant to kill her husband.
motive:
the reason behind the intent.

Components of a Crime
■57
hate crime:
a crime motivated by bias
against the victim’s race, re-
ligion, sexual orientation, or
other status.
purposely:
intending to accomplish a
specific result.
knowingly:
to know that a specific type
of conduct will almost cer-
tainly bring about a particu-
lar result, but without
necessarily intending that or
a related result; a state of
awareness that a certain
fact or circumstance exists.
Those records were adequate evidence for the jury to infer his motive for the crime. A
sociopath may act with no motive at all, however, but with intent to do harm. Though
motive is not a component of the crime itself, it may be used in sentencing. Persons
convicted of hate crimes receive enhanced sentences for choosing their victims be-
cause of bias against their race, religion, sexual orientation, or other status. Con-
versely, a good motive may serve as a mitigating circumstance to lower the sentence.
Statutes and jurisdictions vary in their use of mens rea terminology and its inter-
pretation. In the wording of a statute, the phrase “with intent to” is a clear indication
of the mens rea requirement for that crime. Some statutes simply imply intent in the
verb describing the act itself: whoever forcibly assaults, resists, opposes, impedes, in-
timidates, or interferes with any person [(18 U.S.C. § 111 (a)(1)]. Other statutes indi-
cate mens rea requirements through such adverbs as willfully, maliciously, wantonly,
knowingly, recklessly, and negligently. These words have distinct meanings in some
jurisdictions but are used interchangeably in others. Here are judicial interpretations
of some common mens rea terms.
■
Willful and wanton have the same meaning: wrongful doing of an act with-
out justification or excuse; acting purposely and deliberately against the law
[State v. Davis (N.C. App. 1987)].
■
Willful means intentional, knowing, and purposeful. Wanton means with
conscious and intentional indifference to consequences and with knowledge
that damage is likely to be done to persons or property [Lewek v. State (Fla.
App. 1997)].
■
Wanton is more than ordinary negligence and less than willful injury 
[Saunders v. Shaver (Kans. 1963)].
■
Willfully and maliciously interfering with instruments used in the extin-
guishment of fire do not mean that the defendant must harbor ill will toward
the owner of the property, but rather that the defendant acted intentionally
and without justification or excuse [Robinson v. State (Fla. App. 1997)].
B.
MODEL PENAL CODE DEFINITIONS
The Model Penal Code § 2.02 clarifies mens rea classifications by designating four
types of mental culpability: purposely, knowingly, recklessly, and negligently. Com-
pare definitions in your state.
Purposely indicates an intention to accomplish a specific result. For example, if
A purposely kills B, A intended B to die as a result of A’s actions. In this instance the
purpose is directly consistent with the result or intended result. (See Exhibit 3–1.) A
father who quit his job as a pathologist to eliminate his ability to pay child support
was convicted of purposely violating the Child Support Recovery Act [U.S. v.
Williams] (11th Cir. 1997)].
Knowingly means knowing that a specific type of conduct will almost certainly
bring about a particular result, but without necessarily intending that or a related re-
sult. For example, a person might blow up a safe at a bank knowing that bank em-
ployees are present, but not specifically intending that they get killed. Further,
knowingly can be a state of awareness that a certain fact or circumstance exists, as in
the knowing possession of a vicious dog. The owner does not have to intend harm,
but the knowledge that the dog had attacked others before the fatal attack in question
was sufficient mens rea to result in a murder verdict against the dog’s owner in a Cal-
ifornia case.10
Recklessly is knowing that there is a substantial and unjustifiable risk that con-
duct might cause a particular result but not intending the harmful result. Defendants
who BASE jumped (parachuted) in a national park recklessly created a hazardous
condition for themselves and the public. Their disorderly conduct conviction was af-
firmed in [U.S. v. Albers (9th Cir. 2000)]. In being reckless, the perpetrator does not
knowingly or purposefully intend the harm, but purposefully or knowingly creates a
recklessly:
knowing that there is a sub-
stantial and unjustifiable risk
that conduct might cause a
particular result but not
intending the harmful result.

58
■
CHAPTER 3
wantonly:
maliciously or arrogantly dis-
regarding the known risk to
the rights or safety of others.
substantial and unjustifiable risk that the harm may occur. Wantonly describes be-
havior that is the most serious form of recklessness, characterized by malicious or ar-
rogant disregard of the known risk to the rights or safety of others, such as firing a
gun into a crowd.
Negligently means thoughtlessly or carelessly creating a significant unjustifiable
risk of harm without realizing the risk has been created or without the intent to create
the risk, yet the act or failure to act is such that a reasonable person would have known
that it created such a risk. There is no intent to harm or even a thought that the act will
cause harm, but to a reasonable person the risk is apparent and should have been
avoided. The defendant in People v. Oliver (see Omissions) failed to seek aid for a man
who collapsed after she brought him to her house and facilitated his heroin use. Her neg-
ligence caused his death and resulted in her conviction for involuntary manslaughter.
Of the four levels of state of mind, negligence is the most troublesome from a view-
point of moral wrongdoing. Questions arise as to whether accidental or careless behav-
ior should be the subject of criminal penalties. For example, should a parent or babysitter
be guilty of negligent homicide for giving a child sick with the flu regular doses of as-
pirin when scientific evidence shows a link between aspirin and development of the
deadly Reyes syndrome if the child dies? Should a person be punished for lack of intel-
ligence or certain kinds of knowledge? Traditionally our law says no, they should not,
but legislatures are increasingly passing laws that punish negligent conduct. One of the
purposes of criminal law, however, is to deter unwanted conduct. The more likely that
great harm will result from negligence, the more likely it is to be criminalized.
What about persons who are judgment proof, who cannot be touched for all prac-
tical purposes by civil suits for damages, or those (including corporations) who are
sufficiently rich and powerful that a $100,000 lawsuit means little more than a tem-
porary inconvenience? Does possible criminal punishment for negligence seem ap-
propriate here?11 For these reasons, the drafters of the Model Penal Code suggested
that negligent behavior be an exception to traditional definitions of criminal intent,
and that criminal liability for such conduct be imposed only when the legislature has
made it absolutely clear that it should be imposed.12 Criminal negligence by a corpo-
ration is clearly defined in State v. Steenberg Homes, Inc. (Wis. App. 1998) following the
discussion of corporate crime at the end of this chapter.
negligently:
thoughtlessly or carelessly
creating a significant unjusti-
fiable risk of harm without
realizing the risk has been
created or without the intent
to create the risk, yet the act
is such that a reasonable
person would have known
that the act created such a
risk.

Components of a Crime
■59
general intent:
intent to commit the act
itself, but not necessarily to
cause the results.
specific intent:
carrying out an act for the
purpose of achieving the
resulting harm.
transferred intent:
criminal liability for the harm
to a person other than the
intended victim.
concurrence:
in the context of the compo-
nents of a crime, the logical
and consistent connection
that must exist between the
perpetrator’s wrongful intent
and the wrongful act, and
between the wrongful intent
and the resulting harm, for
criminal liability to attach.
C.
GENERAL, SPECIFIC, AND TRANSFERRED INTENT
Some statutes require only general intent, whereas others are more exacting and re-
quire specific intent. Note the distinction when you research the law. General intent
refers only to the act itself and does not require that the results be intended. To be
guilty of arson, a general intent crime, one only need have malicious intent to set the
fire and not necessarily the intent to burn down the house. Specific intent refers to
carrying out the act for the purpose of achieving the resulting harm. A conviction for
premeditated murder requires not only the intent to fire the gun, but also the specific
intent to kill the victim. Someone who causes danger but is unaware of it because of
voluntary intoxication by alcohol or drugs usually can be charged with general intent
offenses, but not with those that require specific intent.
Besides determining the requisite state of mind, mens rea requires the proper fo-
cus of criminal intent. A man shoots at his intended victim and accidentally hits and
kills a bystander. Since he did not intend to harm the bystander, does he have the nec-
essary mens rea to be charged with a crime? The principle of transferred intent al-
lows one to be held criminally liable for the harm to a person other than the intended
victim, so the culpable state of mind toward the intended victim is transferred to the
bystander along with the bullet. The shooter’s conviction for malice murder was af-
firmed in Perry v. State (Ga. 2003).
D.
CONCURRENCE
Concurrence, in the context of the components of a crime, is the logical and consis-
tent connection that must exist between the perpetrator’s wrongful intent and the
wrongful act, and between the wrongful intent and the resulting harm, for criminal
liability to attach.
Mens rea must concur with the actus reus of the offense. In Case V of Chapter 1,
if Nancy Stroud intended to provide cocaine for her party guests but changed her
mind before acquiring the drugs, her intent and the presence of drugs (from some
other source) at the party do not concur, and she is not criminally liable for distribu-
tion of a controlled substance. Even if she still intended to provide drugs but the pack-
age did not arrive, that intent does not concur with the act of a guest who secretly
brings cocaine to the party, or with the harm that might result from its use.
If the intent is formed after the fact, again there is no concurrence. When the ele-
ments of second degree burglary include unlawful entry to an occupied building with
the intent to commit some other crime, such as battery, on the premises, the defendant
must have that other crime in mind at the same time that he or she enters the build-
ing. If the intent to commit battery is formed any time after the illegal entry has taken
place, the charge of burglary is inappropriate [Cooper v. People (Colo. 1999)].
It is important to note that concurrence does not depend on the components oc-
curring at the same time, but rather that mens rea actuates actus reus and the harm
done. In other words, the state of mind is responsible for the occurrence of both the
act itself and its resulting harm.
E.
STRICT LIABILITY
Strict liability laws require a wrongful act only; the state of mind is irrelevant. These
laws are an exception to the rule that every crime must include a guilty state of mind.
Examples of strict liability offenses include traffic offenses, sale of adulterated foods
or drugs, and failure to report child abuse. These offenses have in common a high
standard of care necessary for safety and difficulty in establishing criminal intent.
As the difficulty of proving the intent in such cases became clear, the law
changed, and the need to prove intent was eliminated for certain relatively minor of-
fenses with little social stigma and punished by no more than fines. Now strict liabil-
ity has grown to include some offenses leading to prison sentences.
strict liability:

CHAPTER 3
When a statute itself has no language about mens rea, several factors, taken to-
gether, can provide a general idea of whether mens rea is required or strict liability is
indicated. One factor alone, such as a prison sentence, is not necessarily determina-
tive. In People v. Allen (Cal. App. 1993) the prison sentence for failure to file an income
tax return did not require evidence of intent because of such a crime’s effect on the
public welfare. The following factors are indications of strict liability.
1.
The history of a statute can indicate legislative intent that it create a strict
liability offense [filing a false statement in State v. Dobry (Iowa 1933)].
2.
Some states require strict liability to be clearly or “plainly” stated in the
statute [welfare fraud in State v. Rushing (Haw. 1980)].
3.
The severity of punishment for the offense may indicate whether fault
(mens rea) is required; the more severe the sentence the greater the
likelihood that the offense has a mens rea element [owning a dog that
causes injury in State v. Bash (Wash. 1996)].
4.
The greater harm the offense poses toward the public, the greater is the
likelihood that the offense is strict liability. The possession of illegal drugs in a
school zone is deemed sufficiently dangerous to children that penalties were

causation:
the link between the intent,
the act, and the harm.
V.
CAUSATION
A.
INTRODUCTION
The fourth element of criminal liability, causation, is the link between the intent, the
act, and the harm. In other words, the intended or criminally negligent act must have
been the direct cause of the death or injury. If A points a loaded pistol at B and pulls
the trigger with the intent to kill B and B is killed, there is little doubt that the firing
of the gun was the direct cause of B’s death. The key here is that without that critical
link of direct cause, there is, generally speaking, no crime.
Corpus delicti, literally the “body of the crime,” is the proof that loss or injury oc-
curred as the result of someone’s criminal conduct. The identity of a body plus a med-
ical examiner’s testimony that death was caused by two gunshot wounds established
the corpus delicti in Hammond v. State (Tex. App. 1997).
The inherent problem in causation cases, mainly homicide cases, is what in fact
caused the death. In Case I Chapter 1, is the attack on Kate Lamb the cause of her
death? It is this dilemma that has made it necessary for the courts to define what cir-
cumstances are adequate to show a sufficient link between the wrongful act and the
result. The “but for” test says that there is sufficient causation if the victim would have
been alive “but for” the defendant’s act. Let us say, however, that A threatens B with
a knife, B runs and hides from A in a building that is blown up by a bomb planted by
C. B would be alive “but for” A’s action, but should A be held liable for B’s murder?
Probably not. B’s death was not a probable or foreseeable consequence of A’s action.

enhanced even though the school zone was not the intended location for
distribution in U.S. v. Oritz (1st. Cir. 1998). The defendant kept the drugs in
his parents’ home 150 feet from a school. See also Walker v. State (Ind. 1996).
5.
The difficulty for the defendant to know the facts may indicate that fault is
required. Ignorance is less of an excuse when knowledge is easily obtained
[depositing a dangerous substance on a highway in Krueger v. Noel (Iowa
1982)]. Driving with a suspended license is not a strict liability offense,
however, when the driver has not been notified of the restriction [State v.
McCallum (Md. 1991)].
6.
The difficulty in proving mens rea makes it more likely that it is not a
required burden on the prosecution. In U.S. v. Flum (8th Cir. 1975), the
court emphasized the difficulty of proving mens rea in attempting to board
an aircraft while carrying a weapon, making that a strict liability offense.
7.
The greater number of prosecutions expected increases the likelihood
that the statute is for a strict liability offense [bigamy in People v. Vogel
(Cal. 1956)].
In interpreting statutes where state of mind is not spelled out, some courts come
down between the necessity for the prosecution to prove mens rea and strict liability
that eliminates the use of state of mind as a defense. These courts do not require the
prosecution to prove fault (mens rea), but allow the defense to present evidence of lack
of fault. Strict liability statutes have been criticized for making conviction of innocent
people easier, and praised for making prosecution of dangerous conduct easier.

CHAPTER 3
proximate cause:
the act that is most closely
and directly responsible for
the injury.
“I am by no means sure that
if a man kept a tiger, and
lightning broke his chain,
and he got loose and did
mischief, that the man who
kept him would not be li-
able.”
—Lord William Bramwell,
English jurist Nichols v.
Marsland, L.R. 10 Ex. 260
(1875)
The law goes beyond the “but for” concept and uses the term proximate cause to
define the sufficient link between the intended act and the harm. The proximate cause
of an injury is the act that is most closely and directly responsible for that injury. A de-
fendant shot the victim in the head and then fled, before a friend also shot the victim
and burned the body. The court in State v. Messick (N.C. App. 2003) affirmed the mur-
der conviction of the first shooter, saying his action did not need to be the sole proxi-
mate cause, but a proximate cause that occurred in combination with another cause.
B.
FORESEEABLE CONSEQUENCES
What if A shoots at B and kills C? The law holds A liable for the death. In such cir-
cumstances, hitting someone other than the target is a probable and foreseeable con-
sequence of the act. Also, if A shoots at B and misses, but B immediately drops dead
of heart failure, A is liable. It is foreseeable that the pointing and firing of the gun
would cause such intense anxiety that a person in good health—let alone a person
with a weak heart—might have a heart attack. However, if an act is committed with
no intent to harm, such as when A drives so fast that his anxious passenger, whom A
does not know has a weak heart, dies of a heart attack, then A is not liable for causing
the death. A recklessly drunken driver should have foreseen that some victims would
not be using seat belts, so their contributory negligence was not a defense in State v.
Freeland (Ariz. App. 1993). An arsonist should have foreseen that the fire started in an
uninhabited building would spread to an adjacent inhabited building, upholding a
conviction for second degree arson in People v. Davis (N.Y. 1977).
C.
SUPERVENING OR SUPERSEDING CAUSES
Between the action and the harm, another event may intervene to become the actual
cause of the harm. This event is called a supervening or superseding cause, defined
in State v. Bartlett (Neb. App. 1994) as “a new and independent act of a third person or
another force which breaks the causal connection between the original wrong and the
injury, and is itself a proximate cause, and, indeed, ‘the’ proximate cause of the injury
in question.” Supervening causes are most often involved in criminal homicide cases.
Asupervening cause overturned an involuntary manslaughter conviction in People
v. Hebert (Cal. App. 1964). During an argument the defendant struck the victim, knock-
ing him off a bar stool. Police half lifted, half dragged the victim to a squad car, allegedly
dropping him face down onto the sidewalk in the process. At the station the victim fell
backward, causing his head to bounce twice on the concrete floor. He died later. In its
decision the court noted that, “. . . we think that in ordinary circumstances all the defi-
nitions [of intervening and supervening causes] have had their roots in the doctrine of
foreseeability.” Because the falls of the victim were unforeseeable to the defendant
when he struck the victim, they were eligible as the supervening cause of the death.
Even grossly negligent medical treatment after a stabbing was not enough to break
the chain of causation between the stabbing and the death of the victim in State v.
Shabazz (Conn. 1998), however. Medical treatment could be considered only if it was the
sole cause of the death. In Weidler v. State (Ala. Cr. App. 1993), a manslaughter convic-
tion was upheld for a defendant who beat the victim and left him helpless on the
ground behind the wheels of a car.As occupants of the car attempted to escape a crowd
trying to pull them from the car, the victim was driven over and killed. The harm caused
by the car did not furnish a supervening cause sufficient to break the chain of causation.
A victim’s decision not to receive a blood transfusion because of her religious be-
liefs was not considered a supervening cause of her death [People v. Cook (Pomona Su-
per. Ct. 1998)]. The drunk driver responsible for her injuries was convicted on the
lesser charge of manslaughter rather than murder, however. “At least in jurors’
minds, it is difficult to conceptualize prosecution arguments that the defendant is re-
sponsible for a death that the defendant did not intend but that his victim did.”13
supervening or
superseding cause:
a new and independent act
of a third person or another
force that breaks the causal
connection between the
original wrong and the injury,
and is the proximate cause
of the injury.

principal:
one having participation in
and responsibility for a
crime.
accomplice:
one who aids and abets the
primary actor through en-
couragement or active
involvement in the commis-
sion of a crime.
accessory:
one guilty of complicity
either before or after the
crime.
VI.
COMPLICITY
A.
INTRODUCTION
As we have just seen, mens rea, actus reus, harm, and causation define when a person is
liable for criminal activity. Complicity is a concept that further defines criminal liability
by extending it beyond one person and beyond the most direct criminal act. It is the par-
ticipation, including assistance, in the commission of a crime. It is the concept needed to
determine whether the getaway driver is as guilty as the shooter of the bank teller, and
whether they should be punished equally. In most jurisdictions the answer to both ques-
tions is yes, conditioned on the fact that all elements of the crime are present for both.
B.
PARTIES TO CRIMES
The primary actors in a crime are called the principals, those having direct participa-
tion in and responsibility for the crime and bearing equal culpability. Accomplices,
those who aid and abet or facilitate, give approval and help to the primary actor
through encouragement or active involvement in the commission of the crime.
Accessories are those who are not present at the crime but provide aid either before
or after the crime.
In modern law the common law distinction among principals, accomplices, and
accessories before the fact has generally been dissolved.
Whoever commits an offense against the United States or aids, abets, counsels,
commands, induces, or procures its commission, is punishable as a principal.
—18 U.S.C.A. § 2(a)
An accessory before the fact can usually be convicted without the conviction of
the principal. The liability of an accessory after the fact, however, still depends on the
conviction of a principal.
An accessory after the fact, who gives aid to a known felon after the commission
of the crime, is usually charged with a separate offense rather than being named as a
party to the original crime. The accessory is charged with harboring a felon; aiding in
accessory after the fact:
one who gives aid to a
known felon after the com-
mission of the crime.

escape; providing a weapon, transportation, or disguise; tampering with evidence;
giving false information—usually lumped under obstruction of justice. This is a sep-
arate, less serious crime than the original one. Little v. U.S. (D.C. 1998) defined acces-
sory after the fact as having four components: (1) the completed felony was
committed by another prior to the accessory’s help, (2) the accessory was not the prin-
cipal in the felony, (3) the accessory had knowledge of the felony, and (4) the acces-
sory acted personally to aid or assist the felon to avoid detection or apprehension for
the crimes. Adefendant’s attempt to help his friends avoid arrest for multiple felonies
they committed did not make him an accomplice to those felonies, but only an acces-
sory after the fact. His conviction for the felonies was reversed in James v. State (Ga.
App. 2003).
In most jurisdictions elements of the crime include knowing that the person given
assistance had committed a felony, or was charged or sought in connection with such
a crime. Federal law, however, leaves prosecution open for accessories in misde-
meanors as well [18 U.S.C.A. § 3]. Also, some affirmative aid must be given. This re-
quires the performance of an act by the accessory, or the offering of false statements
to authorities. Simple withholding of information or refusal to cooperate are usually
not sufficient. In addition, some states allow a spouse’s common law duty, as well as
other family ties, to override this offense and exempt culpability for being accessories
after the fact to a spouse or other relative.
Use your state’s statutes as a guide as you consider the following aspects of
complicity.
C.
ACTUS REUS IN COMPLICITY
Even though a principal need not be convicted before an accomplice can be tried, the
state must show that some person other than the defendant is guilty as the principal
[People v. Vaughn (Mich. App. 1990)]. An accomplice could not be convicted of a first
degree murder, however, when the principal had been convicted of the less serious
offense of second degree murder [State v. Ward (Md. 1978)].
The accomplice must have provided some form of affirmative assistance to the
principal actor in the offense. One cannot be charged for merely being present at a
crime scene. Affirmative assistance can be
1.
A physical act that furthers the purpose of the crime. The procurer of
weapons, the lookout, and the hotel owner who rents to prostitutes
provide such aid. It is not necessary to show that “but for” the aid of the
accomplice, the crime would not have been committed, but it is essential
that the aid provided had the possibility of being effective. In Case VI, if a
bystander handed the principal what he thought was a can of gasoline to
help ignite the cross and the contents turned out to be water, the bystander
would not be liable.

Encouragement to the principal in the undertaking of the crime. The one
who says, “That ring really should belong to you; just go take it,” has been
judged culpable.
3.
Failure to act, when action is required by duty. When a mother stands by
as her child is beaten, she is culpable for the breach of duty to protect that
child and is an accomplice to the offense [State v. Walden (N.C. 1982)].
4.
The relationship of the accomplice to the principal. Despite identification
of the hand that actually committed the criminal act, a hierarchy of power
behind the act may be established. The primary actor might be an innocent
instrument of the principal, or might be guilty of a lesser charge.
In Case III, if Cat Bermuda had tricked the maid Lacey Rude into believing that
she should bring the gold idol to the kitchen for safekeeping, Ms. Rude would then
be considered simply an instrument of Ms. Bermuda and would not be charged. If X
in the passion of the moment kills W with a knife handed by calculating Y, then X, the

Components of a Crime
■65
principal, is guilty of manslaughter whereas Y, the aider and abettor, is guilty of mur-
der [Parker v. Commonwealth (Ky. 1918)]. In People v. Oliver (see Omissions), the defen-
dant was found to have aided and abetted illegal drug use by knowingly providing a
spoon and the room where the use took place.
The action of principals and accomplices is seen as the result of teamwork and is
taken as a whole to establish the elements of a crime. The actus reus may be provided by
only one member of the team, but the others share that element through their relation-
ship to that member. The mens rea of each accomplice must be determined individually.
D.
MENS REA IN COMPLICITY
An accomplice must have “the same requisite intent as that required of the principal”
[People v. Tanner (Mich. App. 2003)]. The defendant’s presence during the crime, affil-
iation with the principal after the commission of the crime, and failure to report the
crime all may be used to show the specific intent of the accomplice. There is no shared
intent if the defendant did not know of the principal’s offense; presence at the crime
scene and close association are not enough to stand alone. In U.S. v. Stewart, (5th Cir.
1998), the defendant seemed nervous during a traffic stop. The friend he was accom-
panying was discovered to be carrying crack cocaine and weapons. In the patrol car
the two friends had a partially incriminating conversation, but it did not establish that
the defendant knowingly and purposefully participated in the possession and intent
to distribute the cocaine, so his conviction was reversed.
It seems that the easiest proof of mens rea in aiding and abetting involves show-
ing the provision of aid in some physical form—procuring weapons, drawing maps—
that demonstrates an interest in the crime. Much more problematic, however, is the
aid provided with knowledge but without any purpose in the success of the crime.
What difference is there between the intention to promote an action and the knowing
assistance of that action? How should the criminal justice system deal with the gun
dealer who sells ammunition, knowing it will be used in an assassination? The black-
smith who forges special tools to be used in a burglary? What is Imp Satterfield’s cul-
pability in Case III if she is simply a librarian providing information about the
potential market for pre–Columbian gold?
Except where the aider obtains some profit from the venture and thus has a clear
purpose in the crime, these situations are slippery ones for the courts to consider. Two
landmark cases provide some handles. Backun v. U.S. (4th Cir. 1940) upheld the con-
viction of the seller of stolen silverware to another who resold it in interstate commerce.
To say that the sale of goods is a normally lawful transaction is beside the point. The
seller may not ignore the purpose for which the purchase is made if he is advised of that
purpose, or wash his hands of the aid he has given the perpetrator of a felony by the plea
that he has merely made a sale of merchandise. [Backun, 637.]
In U.S. v. Peoni (2d Cir. 1938) Judge Learned Hand provides a different twist in
overturning the conviction of Peoni who had sold counterfeit bills to Regno who in
turn sold them to Dorsey, the one who finally passed them into circulation. Hand con-
cedes that Peoni’s involvement “was indeed a step in the causal chain which ended in
Dorsey’s possession, but that was all. . . .” The opinion continues in stronger language.
It will be observed that all these definitions [of complicity] have nothing whatever to do
with the probability that the forbidden result would follow upon the accessory’s conduct;
and that they all demand that he in some sort associate himself with the venture, that he
participate in it as in something that he wishes to bring about, that he seek by his action
to make it succeed. All the words used—even the most colorless, “abet”—carry an
implication of purposive attitude towards it. [Peoni, 401.]
Although some jurisdictions favor Backun, the general tendency, including that of
the Model Penal Code § 2.06(3)(a), is to conform more closely with Peoni in requiring
a more substantial stake in the venture on the part of the defendant.

CHAPTER 3
ANALYSIS PROBLEM
3–3.
If a principal breaks a strict liability law without knowing or intending
to do so, is the unknowing accomplice also culpable? Is the undercover nar-
cotics agent who purchases illegal substances to obtain evidence a partici-
pant in crime?
In some jurisdictions, an accomplice is also liable for crimes committed by the
principal that are a foreseeable extension of the crime originally intended. Cat
Bermuda’s battery of Lacey Rude in Case III was not intended by the Legrise gang,
but it could be argued that a violent confrontation was a foreseeable result of the
planned burglary. In such jurisdictions, the rest of the gang would be accomplices to
the attack on Ms. Rude.
The accomplice is “also guilty of any other crime the direct perpetrator actually
commits that is a natural and probable consequence of the target offense” [People v.
Mendoza (Cal. 1998)]. The defendant and friends had been drinking and tried to crash
a party, but they were sent away. The defendant went to get another friend who had
a gun. They returned, and the friend shot the gun into the building where the party
was taking place, killing one person and wounding five others. The shooting was a
natural and probable consequence of the defendant’s action, sufficient to sustain the
defendant’s conviction for the shooting. Because evidence of the defendant’s intoxi-
cation had not been admitted at trial, however, his conviction was reversed and re-
manded (sent back to the lower court for reconsideration). That evidence could have
shown a lack of specific intent to further the principal’s purpose.
Others are legally incompetent to commit certain crimes. For example, a minor,
even though she encourages the act, cannot be convicted of complicity in the statu-
tory rape of herself because the law was written specifically to protect her from that
act. Women, incapable of rape by definition in some jurisdictions, may be accomplices
to a rapist [Bass v. State (Mo. Ct. App. 1997)].
In illegal transactions such as selling liquor without a license or prostitution, the
purchaser is generally not punished as an accessory because the purchaser is involved
with a smaller percentage of the crimes than the seller. Also the purchaser is valuable
as a witness against the seller who is seen as the more culpable party, the more dan-
gerous to society’s standards.
E.
ABANDONMENT
There are two situations in which abandonment of participation in criminal activ-
ity can negate liability for a would-be accomplice. If, after having given assistance
to the primary actor, the accomplice changes course and either (1) withdraws the
aid given or (2) goes to the police in time to halt the crime, the accomplice’s part in
the enterprise is negated. The aid withdrawn needs to be equal to the aid given. If
vocal encouragement was given, it can be balanced by equally emphatic discour-
agement. If a weapon was procured, it must be taken back. If a law enforcement
agency is contacted, it must be in time to facilitate effective countermeasures.
Abandonment was not considered timely by the court in State v. Pratt (Kan. 1994),
when the defendant left the scene before a rape, but after participating in burglary,
kidnapping, battery, and a separate rape. His conviction for those crimes was up-
held. Chapter 6 includes a discussion of abandonment as a defense to attempt
charges.

Components of a Crime

vicarious liability:
culpability of one person for
the criminal act of another.
corporate liability:
culpability of a corporation
for the criminal act of one of
its representatives.
VII.
VICARIOUS AND CORPORATE LIABILITY
A.
INTRODUCTION
Vicarious liability, the assigning of culpability to one person for the criminal act of an-
other, and corporate liability, the assigning of culpability to a corporation for the crim-
inal act of its representatives, are devices for dealing with criminal behavior in our
complex society. In networks of people held together by ties of obligation, sometimes
it seems that everyone has some authority, but no one has complete authority. Vicari-
ous and corporate liability reach into the network to assign responsibility and impose
criminal sanctions for business activities that place the public welfare in danger.
Vicarious liability usually applies in a business setting where the conduct of an
employee acting within the scope of employment is imputed to the employer. Cor-
porate liability is similar, with the corporation standing as the employer. This concept
of respondeat superior, that the employer is responsible for the acts of the employee
carrying out the employer’s business, comes from civil law. Liability does not com-
pletely shift from the employee to the employer, however, so both may be charged
with criminal conduct.
B.
VICARIOUS LIABILITY
Because the liquor business is so heavily regulated, it serves as a good example of
the way vicarious liability works. The defendant in Commonwealth v. Koczwara (Pa.
1959), the operator of a tavern, was convicted of selling beer to minors. On a previ-
ous such violation, the defendant was fined in the range of $100 to $300, but for the
repeat offense the sentence was a $500 fine and three months’ imprisonment. On ap-
peal, the opinion noted that sale of the beer was made by a bartender; in fact, there
was no evidence that the defendant was present or had any personal knowledge of
the sales. However,
[W]e find that the intent of the legislature in enacting this code was not only to
eliminate the common-law requirement of mens rea, but also to place a very high degree
of responsibility upon the holder of a liquor license to make certain that neither he nor
anyone in his employ commit any of the prohibited acts upon the licensed premises. . . .
In spite of this legislated responsibility, the court found the sentence too harsh.
A man’s liberty cannot rest on so frail a reed as whether his employee will commit a
mistake in judgment. . . . We have found no case in any jurisdiction which has
permitted a prison term for a vicarious offense. . . .
The conviction was upheld with the amended sentence allowing only the fine.
Employees acting only on their own behalf and outside the scope of their em-
ployment, however, do not pass on vicarious liability to their employers.
Vicarious liability reaches beyond business regulation violations into parental re-
sponsibility. All states, except Delaware and Vermont, and many cities have laws that
impose sanctions on parents for the actions of their children. Not all of these are crim-
inal sanctions or true vicarious liability offenses because they require some culpable
act or state of mind by the parent, such as knowingly neglecting the child or encour-
aging a child to violate laws. Arkansas’s truancy law, however, is a true vicarious lia-
bility law, imposing civil fines on parents for the child’s actions only.14
Statutes containing wording such as “whoever, by himself or by his agent, . . .” or
“act by an employee shall be deemed the act of the employer as well as the act of the
employee . . .” clearly impose vicarious liability on the employer. Liability is not vi-
carious when the employer’s or parent’s involvement is implied by such words as
knowingly or with intent to. Terms such as allow or permit have been interpreted incon-
sistently by the courts. The indications for strict liability—legislative history, severity
respondeat superior:
the employer is responsible
for the acts of the employee
carrying out the employer’s
business.

CHAPTER 3
ANALYSIS PROBLEM
3–4.
Do you find vicarious liability as in Koczwara “a barbarity”? How
would you deal with the owner of an establishment where regulations are
repeatedly violated?
Parental responsibility laws have been criticized as being too vague or
overbroad, invasive of family privacy, and subject to abuse by children who
intentionally cause trouble for their parents. Do you think parents should be
vicariously responsible for their children’s behavior? If so, under what cir-
cumstances?
of punishment, danger to the public, and so forth—are also good clues as to whether
a statute allows vicarious liability.15
C.
CORPORATE LIABILITY
Compared with the crime of an individual, the harm that can be done by even one
corporate offense may be vast. The estimated $60 billion that Enron cost its investors,
pensioners, and employees is more than three times the annual cost of all individual
theft, burglary, and arson crimes put together.16 According to the law, a corporation is
a person and, therefore, is liable for its criminal activity. The acts of a corporation are
those carried out by its agents or employees within the scope of their employment.
When offenses require specific criminal intent, the corporation must appear to au-
thorize or at least acquiesce in their commission. Arepeated pattern of illegal acts may
tend to show this acquiescence. The intent of the corporation’s officers is assumed to
be the intent of the corporation.
When specific intent is not required, the corporation still may be liable for em-
ployees’ acts, even if they were not authorized, or even if they were forbidden. State
v. Steenberg Homes, Inc. at the end of this section contains a good example of liability
under such circumstances.
Besides ordinary criminal statutes, corporations are subject to many administra-
tive regulations that are enforced with criminal penalties. Acorporation cannot be im-
prisoned, of course, and fines that are fitting for an individual’s crime are negligible
to a large corporation, so huge fines have been used to control corporate behavior that
is dangerous to individuals and to the public as a whole.
In response to the outbreak of business fraud cases such as Arthur Anderson and
Enron, Congress passed the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Pub. L. 107–204, 116 Stat. 745.
Among other provisions, the Act sets out requirements for record keeping and ac-
countability by corporate officers and significantly increases both fines and prison
terms for corporate fraud and corporate white-collar crime, an overlapping area.17
(See Chapter 5 for a separate discussion of white-collar crime.) This Act makes it eas-
ier to prosecute individual decision-makers as well as corporations for corporate
fraud, defined by the Department of Justice to include:
1.
falsification of corporate financial information,
2.
self-dealing by corporate insiders (insider trading, kickbacks, misuse of
corporate property for personal gain, for example), and
3.
obstruction of justice.
The Corporate Fraud Task Force (CFTF) was created to bring together efforts by
the FBI, Postal Inspection Service, Internal Revenue Service–Criminal Investigation,
and other financial regulatory services to enforce the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other
federal corporate fraud laws. In its first year, July 2002 to June 2003, the task force had
charges pending against 354 defendants, and collected well over $2 billion in fines,
“A corporation cannot blush. It
is a body, it is true; has cer-
tainly a head—a new one every
year; arms it has and very long
ones, for it can reach at any-
thing; . . . a throat to swallow
the rights of the community,
and a stomach to digest them!
But who ever yet discovered, in
the anatomy of any corpora-
tion, either bowels or a heart?”

Tralee assizes, c. 1825

forfeitures, and restitutions. Seventy-five percent of its corporate fraud convictions
ended with prison sentences.18
While individuals are prosecuted for their criminal actions within the corporate
structure, corporations themselves are also targets of the task force when the “corpo-
rate culture” is corrupt. Justice Department guidelines for prosecuting corporations
require consideration of the following factors:
1.
the seriousness of the offense, including risk to the public and applicable
policies for the specific crime;
2.
pervasiveness of crime through the corporation, including participation by
management;
3.
a record of similar conduct by the corporation;
4.
the cooperation of the corporation “in the investigation of its agents,
including, if necessary, the waiver of corporate attorney-client and work
product protection”;
5.
an effective corporation compliance program;
6.
effective remedial actions;
7.
impact of prosecution on innocent shareholders, pension holders,
employees, and the public;
8.
adequate prosecution of responsible agents;
9.
adequacy of civil or regulatory actions.19
Critics have pointed out that factor 4 requires the corporation to identify “culpable”
employees and cut them off from normal employment benefits, denying them due
process before they have even been charged.20
The U.S. Sentencing Commission is reviewing the sentencing guidelines on fed-
eral corporate crimes that have been in place since 1991. Those guidelines reduce fines
as much as 95 percent when there have been “steps taken by the organization prior to
the offense to prevent and detect criminal conduct,” as in factor 5 above.21
The case of State v. Steenberg Homes, Inc. (Wis. App. 1998) illustrates both negli-
gence and corporate responsibility in a criminal offense.

J. ROGGENSACK
Steenberg Homes, Inc. (Steenberg) appeals from a convic-
tion of two counts of homicide by negligent operation of a
vehicle pursuant to § 940.10, Stats., and one count of caus-
ing great bodily harm by negligent operation of a vehicle
pursuant to § 346.62(4), Stats. . . .
BACKGROUND
On August 8, 1995, Daniel Oliver, a Steenberg employee,
was driving a Steenberg tractor-trailer when the trailer dis-
engaged from the tractor and struck three bicyclists who
were riding on the shoulder of the road.Two of the bicyclists
were killed, and the third was seriously injured.
Oliver began his employment as a truck driver with
Steenberg on July 31, 1995. During the week of July 31,
1995, Paul Cwikla, a Steenberg employee, trained Oliver.
Cwikla showed Oliver the trailer hookup procedures. After
Oliver completed his training, Cwikla gave a positive evalu-
ation approving Oliver to drive on his own.
On August 8, 1995, the day of the accident, Oliver, Cwikla,
and another employee loaded timbers onto the trailer. Oliver
backed up his tractor to the loaded trailer, and Cwikla at-
tached the coupler to the ball hitch between Oliver’s tractor
and the trailer. Neither Cwikla nor Oliver attached the safety
chains.

70
■
CHAPTER 3
After Oliver left the lot, he operated the truck in a safe
and prudent manner, driving at an appropriate speed.When
he reached a hill overlooking a bridge, he saw three bicy-
clists riding along the roadway. Before he passed them, he
slowed, beeped his horn, and moved to the center of the
road. As he drove past the bicyclists, the trailer disengaged
from the tractor and hit the bicyclists. If either the ball hitch
or the safety chains had been properly attached, the trailer
would not have disengaged and struck the bicyclists.
On May 9 and 10, 1996, the State conducted an inquest
to determine the cause of the accident. At the inquest, evi-
dence was presented which showed that prior to this acci-
dent, no Steenberg tractor-trailer had ever disengaged
causing injury, and there had never been any previous prob-
lem with the utility trailer or its hitch, although it was difficult
to determine when the hitch was locked. However, Steen-
berg had not established a procedure to ensure that the ball
hitch and safety chains were both secure before a tractor-
trailer entered a public roadway.At the conclusion of the pro-
ceeding, the jury concluded that probable cause existed to
charge Steenberg with two counts of second-degree reck-
less homicide, pursuant to § 940.06, STATS.
On October 1, 1997, a trial was conducted before the cir-
cuit court on stipulated facts from the inquest. The court
convicted Steenberg of all three offenses on the grounds
that the Steenberg employees, acting within the scope of
their employment, were negligent for failing to attach the
safety chains; that Steenberg failed to ensure that neces-
sary safety procedures were followed by employees in order
to avoid a substantial risk of death or great bodily harm; and
that the lack of the safety chains was a cause of the acci-
dent. This appeal followed.
DISCUSSION
. . .
3. Scope of employment.
Steenberg contends that it cannot be criminally liable for the
conduct of its employee, Oliver, because Oliver knew that he
was responsible for safely maintaining and coupling the
tractor-trailer. Therefore, Steenberg argues that Oliver was
not acting within the scope of his employment when he neg-
ligently coupled the tractor-trailer because Steenberg em-
ployees are instructed not to act negligently. Steenberg’s
argument is not supported by Wisconsin law.
A corporation can be held liable for the acts of its employ-
ees committed within the scope of employment. Employees
act within the scope of employment when they perform acts
which they have express or implied authority to perform and
their actions benefit or are intended to benefit the employer.
An employer can be held responsible for the acts of an
employee performed within the scope of employment, even
though the conduct of the employee is contrary to the em-
ployer’s instructions or stated policies.
Steenberg gave both Oliver and Cwikla express author-
ity to drive, maintain, and couple tractor-trailers, and these
acts were performed exclusively for the benefit of Steen-
berg. When Cwikla improperly coupled the tractor-trailer
and when Oliver failed to check the hookup and attach the
safety chains, each was acting within the scope of his em-
ployment. That Oliver and Cwikla did not heed Steenberg’s
warnings to use caution and that Oliver did not undertake
responsibility for the safety and maintenance of his tractor-
trailer does not place their negligent actions outside the
scope of employment. Therefore, Steenberg may be liable
for the acts of its employees, Oliver and Cwikla.
Sufficiency of the Evidence.
Homicide by the negligent use of a vehicle has three ele-
ments: (1) the defendant caused a death, (2) by criminal
negligence, (3) in the operation or handling of a vehicle.
Knutson, 196 Wis.2d at 109, 537 N.W.2d at 428. One can-
not be held criminally liable for ordinary negligence under
§ 940.10, STATS. Rather, the negligent act must rise to the
level of criminal negligence.
Criminal negligence differs from ordinary negligence in
two respects. First, the risk is more serious—death or
great bodily harm as opposed to simple harm. Second,
the risk must be more than an unreasonable risk—it
must also be substantial. Criminal negligence involves
the same degree of risk as criminal recklessness—an
unreasonable and substantial risk of death or great
bodily harm. The difference between the two is that
recklessness requires that the actor be subjectively
aware of the risk, while criminal negligence requires
only that the actor should have been aware of the risk—
an objective standard.
[W]e note that both state and federal law require that
safety chains be attached when a trailer is being pulled on
a public highway. The potential for death or great bodily
harm, if a tractor disengages from a trailer while driving on
a public highway was not contested by Steenberg. In addi-
tion, Steenberg had an express policy of requiring its drivers
to attach safety chains and to maintain their vehicles.There-
fore, the circuit court’s finding that Steenberg knew or
should have known that not using safety chains posed a
substantial risk of death or great bodily harm to people us-
ing public highways is well grounded in the record. However,
even though Steenberg knew or should have known of the
danger, it had no procedure which required a safety check,
such as a form checklist the driver was required to complete,
showing he had attached the safety chains, before he could
begin his driving assignment.Steenberg did not use due dili-
gence to ensure that its employees properly coupled the
tractor-trailers and attached the safety chains.Therefore, we
conclude that the evidence, viewed most favorably to the
State and the convictions, supports the circuit court’s find-

ing that Steenberg’s conduct was a cause of the bicyclists’
deaths because had there been a checking procedure, es-
tablished and enforced, the safety chains would have been

CONCLUSION
This chapter presents principles of criminal law that generally apply to any criminal
statutes. Knowing these principles will help you assess culpability in each case with
which you work.
A review of the components of crime—harm or likely harm, actus reus, mens rea,
and causation—will help you understand the statutory elements that define each of-
fense. Be alert to situations where those components drop or shift, as in strict liability,
supervening causes, and vicarious liability.
Another factor bearing on the culpability of the accused is the level of that per-
son’s complicity in the crime. It is important to understand the actus reus and mens
rea that define participation in a criminal act.
The special situations of vicarious and corporate liability allow for a person or
entity to be punished for actions of their agents, even though those actions were not
expressly condoned by that person or entity. Here again we see the law on the thin
line between freedom and restraint, with the greater good of the people as a goal.

INTRODUCTION
A.
ELEMENTS OF CRIMES
Elements of a crime are the specific requirements enumerated in statutes or common
law that define a particular offense. Chapter 3 discussed actus reus, mens rea, and
other general components of offenses; Chapter 4 narrows those components into the
specific elements of individual crimes. For example, a statute specifies that one is
guilty of arson who starts a fire with the purpose of (1) destroying an occupied struc-
ture of another or (2) damaging any property, his own or another’s, to collect insur-
ance. The actus reus element is that a fire is started. The mens rea element is that the
act was done purposely. The harm elements are destroying and damaging, along
with the specific types of structures targeted. The prosecution must carefully match
each of these elements of the charge to the facts of the case so the burden of proof can
be met on each element. The defense also matches elements to facts to see if lesser
charges are appropriate or, when the match is less than perfect, to attack the charg-
ing document or to find defenses to the charge. To do your work accurately, you must
know the difference between larceny and robbery, between arson and attempted ar-
son, between first and second degree murder. In later chapters you will learn how to
apply this knowledge toward procedures necessary to the prosecution or defense of
a case.
These chapters cannot possibly give you all the legal variations of all the acts
criminalized by our society. Their purpose is to lay the foundation of understanding
so that you can do specific research efficiently as the need arises with each case. Chap-
ter 6 covers inchoate, or incomplete, crimes. Chapters 4 and 5 are divided according
to categories of crimes that share a common objective and, therefore, a common ra-
tionale for criminalization. Within these categories, the individual crimes are consid-
ered separately. Examples of pertinent cases, statutes, jury instructions, and Model
Penal Code sections give you reference points for the cases that you will encounter in
the office. Most importantly, though, you must understand the legislative and judi-
cial law in your own jurisdiction.
The discussion of homicide illustrates the complexity of grading crimes. Use
these examples, and check your state’s statutes for the fine points marking the differ-
ences in elements and grading of each crime as you encounter it. For an overview of
crimes, their classification and elements, see the charts at the end of this chapter and
Chapters 5 and 6.
B.
LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSE
A lesser included offense (or necessarily included offense) is one whose elements
are all included among the elements of the more serious crime that is being charged.
For example, misdemeanor theft is a lesser included offense of felony theft when the
act and intent are the same, with simply a lesser degree of harm. A lesser included of-
fense may be joined in the charging document or be stated in instructions to the jury,
who then decide not only whether to convict, but also on which charge to convict. The
Model Penal Code §§ 1.07 (4) and (5) defines a lesser included offense as one that:
1.
Is provable by the same or less than all the facts necessary to prove the
charged offense.
2.
Is the attempt or solicitation to commit the charged offense.
3.
Is the same as the charged offense, except that it involves “less serious
injury or risk of injury” to “the same person, property, or public interest”
as that in the charged offense, or involves a “lesser kind of culpability”
than that in the charged offense.
The court in Malik v. State (Md. App. 2003) vacated a first degree premeditated
murder conviction, because a jury instruction on the lesser included offense of second
lesser included offense 
(or necessarily included
offense):

ments of the more serious
crime that is being charged.

■79
degree murder had not been given. The court’s determination of whether the defen-
dant is entitled to a lesser included offense instruction is based on facts indicating that
1.
the offense qualifies as a lesser included offense, and
2.
there is a rational basis on which the jury could conclude the defendant
was guilty of the lesser but not greater offense.
The court in State v. Sage (Ohio 1987) ruled that when there is a complete defense
to the crime charged, jury instructions on lesser included offenses will not be permit-
ted, because they could lead to an unreasonable compromise by the trier.
At the end of the discussion of assault and battery in this chapter is the text of
Lamb v. State (Md. App. 1992) that contains a consideration of lesser included of-
fenses, as does State v. Tutton (Tenn. Cr. App. 1993) at the end of the sexual battery
section. Read these cases to see the role lesser included charges can play at trial and
appeal.
A few states allow jury instructions for lesser related offenses, offenses that do
not meet the requirements of lesser included offenses, but bear a substantial relation-
ship to the charged offense.1 A defendant found near a restaurant whose window had
just been broken was convicted of second degree burglary, but in People v. Geiger (Cal.
1984) the court ruled that jury instructions should have covered the lesser related of-
fense of vandalism. Vandalism was considered to be sufficiently related to burglary,
and the necessary proof of intent for burglary was defective.

CRIMES AGAINST PERSONS
A.
INTRODUCTION
From Sherlock Holmes mysteries through television docudramas to the headlines of
your local newspaper, the crimes that captivate us with shivers of horror are those
that bring harm to life or limb. Homicide, assault, rape, and kidnapping, ancient
common law crimes the perpetrators of which were punished for depriving the king
of healthy subjects, have advanced into our times with a vengeance. A mere interest
in macabre stories or the king’s loss of the taxpaying ability of the victim seem
quaint beside the physical and psychological toll on the lives of people we know and
the social as well as economic damage to the communities where we live. It is no sur-
prise that these are considered some of the most serious offenses in criminal law.
As these common law offenses became codified, they also gradually became
more and more complex. Both the division of crimes into felony and misdemeanor
levels and then their gradation into degrees of severity correspond to the complexity
of circumstances in which these crimes occur. A simple “off with their heads,” the an-
cient response to these crimes, has given way to an attempt at understanding differ-
ences in intent and damages, and to punish accordingly.
Along with this increased complexity in the grading of basic common law crimes,
the past century has seen the kinds of changes that spawn entirely new crimes of vio-
lence. Vehicular homicide and “carjacking” did not exist a hundred years ago, nor did
AIDS as an aggravating circumstance to rape. Recently, cyberspace has provided an-
other avenue for stalking. Increasing emphasis on the rights of children and women
has expanded rape into many levels of sex offenses, by and against both sexes, and has
helped establish criminal abuse as a separate crime. Advances in medicine have
changed the very definitions of life and death, and homicide laws have been reinter-
preted accordingly. Terrorism is indeed a crime against persons, but since its broadest
impact is against public order and safety it will be discussed in Chapter 5.
As with all the sections in Chapters 4 and 5, the following discussions of specific
crimes against the person present the most usual elements and gradations, along with
some possible variations for your general knowledge. You must accompany this
background material with careful reading of your state’s statutes.

CHAPTER 4
B.
HOMICIDE
1.
Introduction
Common law homicide, the killing of one person by another, was divided into justi-
fiable homicide such as that committed by police in the line of duty, excusable homi-
cide such as that committed by one insane, and criminal homicide. The first two are
discussed in Chapter 7 as defenses.
Historically, criminal homicide was always punishable by death, regardless of
circumstances. By the sixteenth century in England, premeditated murders, “wilful
prepense murders” and “murder upon malice prepensed,” were separated from
those without such malice. These premeditated murders all were subject to capital
punishment under common law, and the lesser “manslaughter” convictions resulted
in less harsh sentences.2 Malice aforethought is still the line between murder and
manslaughter.
The refinement of gradations in homicide statutes evolved, and now the death
penalty may be imposed only when murders are committed under specified aggra-
vating circumstances and with specified mitigating circumstances and procedural
safeguards taken into account. Thirty-eight states use capital punishment.
Federal homicide laws include 18 U.S.C.A. § 351, which covers assassination of
major governmental officers; 18 U.S.C.A. §§ 1111 and 1112, which define first degree
murder, felony murder, and manslaughter; 18 U.S.C.A. § 1114, which gives federal
courts jurisdiction over murders of specified United States officers such as federal
judges, CIA agents, and national park rangers carrying out their duties; 18 U.S.C.A.
§ 1116, which includes the killing of foreign officials; and 18 U.S.C.A. § 2332, which
includes killing United States citizens in international terrorism. The phrase “while
engaged in, or on account of, performance of official duties” has been broadly inter-
preted. Most homicide cases, however, arise under state statute.
2.
Actus Reus in Homicide
Taking the life of another human being is the actus reus of homicide. Hidden in this
definition is the assumption that the victim was alive before the act. That seems sim-
ple enough, but there are many cases where the cause and timing of death are less clear.
Statutes in some states still include the common law rule that death must oc-
cur within a year and a day from the time of the injury for criminal homicide to
be charged. Because of medical advances, some states have extended the limit to
three years and a day, and others have dropped the limitation altogether, either
through judicial or legislative decision [Rogers v. Tennessee (2001), State v. Picotte
(Wis. 2003)].
A man shot in the neck lived for six years, paralyzed and unable to breathe on his
own for more than short periods. When he died, his attacker, already convicted on
armed assault charges, was indicted for first degree murder. The defendant filed a
motion to dismiss murder charges, claiming that Massachusetts’s rejection of the
year-and-a-day rule kept a potential prosecution hanging over his head and that a
trial six years after the shooting would be a “costly and confusing battle of experts”
over the cause of death. The court denied the motion, citing advances in medical sci-
ence that render the year-and-a-day or any other time limitation obsolete [Common-
wealth v. Casanova (Mass. 1999)].
Further complicating this question is the changing definition of “death.” The once
easy line between heartbeat and no heartbeat has given way to machines that sustain
respiration and heartbeat, even if the brain is entirely nonfunctioning. When the brain
stem still maintains heartbeat and breathing but there is no other brain activity, the
patient is left in a deep coma and must be given food and water through tubes. Which
is the actus reus of murder: the act that causes the injury, or the act that ends the
“heroic medical measures”? Although the withdrawal of hydration and nourishment

Crimes Against Persons and Crimes Against Habitation
■81
from a patient in a nonreversible coma remains controversial, some courts permit it
free of criminal liability. More commonly accepted than denying food and water is the
termination of cardiopulmonary support by machines, although there may be resis-
tance if the patient is a minor or incompetent, or if an adult’s wishes in the matter are
unknown. Generally, however, most legislatures and courts accept brain death as fi-
nal. In re Quinlan (N.J. 1976) set a widely publicized precedent for ending life support
that was carried into the criminal realm in Commonwealth v. Golston (Mass. 1977),
where the victim had been brutally clubbed with a baseball bat. Golston’s conviction
for murder was upheld on the basis that the victim was already legally dead (brain
dead) when the plug was pulled.
Also, it is not so simple to determine when “life” begins. Personal morals, reli-
gion, and philosophy join medicine and law in the search for an objective definition
of that point. The contentions range all the way from conception to viability (capable
of living normally outside the womb) to live birth. State laws and judicial opinions on
fetal homicide are in a period of change. Some states define the beginning of life or
status of a fetus as a person and apply homicide laws accordingly, and some have sep-
arate fetal homicide laws. The Unborn Victims of Violence Act was signed into fed-
eral law in 2004, creating two separate crimes for the harm of a mother and her fetus
during the commission of a federal crime.
Missouri declares that life begins at conception, so a seventeen-week-old fetus
killed in a robbery shooting was the victim of a felony murder [State v. Rollen (Mo.
App. 2003)]. California law criminalizes the killing of any fetus beyond the embryonic
stage of seven to eight weeks when the mother’s privacy interests are not at stake, as
in abortion [West’sAnn. Cal. Penal Code § 187(a)]. Viability is not an element, so a mur-
der charge was appropriate when an unviable fetus died after the mother was shot
during a robbery [People v. Davis (Cal. 1994)]. Ohio includes “unlawful termination of
another’s pregnancy” in its murder statute (§ 2903.02). The U.S. Supreme Court let
stand the decision in [McKnight v. State (S.C. 2003)] that affirmed a mother’s convic-
tion of homicide by child abuse of a baby stillborn after the mother’s use of cocaine
during pregnancy. Be sure to note your state’s approach to fetal homicide.
3.
Causation in Homicide
One element of crime is the link of causation between the act of the accused and the
harm to the victim, but that link is seldom at issue except in homicide. It may be dif-
ficult to determine which among several factors was the actual cause of death. When
one act sets in motion other events that eventually result in death, courts are most
likely to trace cause to the originating act. As seen in Golston, it was the act of the beat-
ing that caused death, not the intervening act of removing life support.
A man slashes his girlfriend’s throat. In treatment for her wounds she receives
blood transfusions contaminated with hepatitis. She dies six weeks later of hepatitis.
Who is guilty? The boyfriend’s conviction for first degree murder was upheld in
McKinnon v. U.S. (D.C. App. 1988).
An intoxicated fourteen-year-old boy wrecked a car, killing two passengers. The
man who gave him beer and the car keys was convicted of homicide by vehicle. In up-
holding the conviction, the court in Guzman v. State (Ga. App. 2003) said the defen-
dant could have foreseen that an intoxicated minor might drive recklessly, and that
the boy’s driving did not break the chain of causation.
If an intervening cause of death is not part of a chain linked to the original act but
is instead a separate, coincidental occurrence, it is the “superseding cause” bearing re-
sponsibility for the death. In McKinnon, for example, if the victim was recovering
nicely from her wounds without the aid of transfusions but was discovered to have a
chronic blood disorder requiring them, the slashing would not have been the reason
the transfusions were given and, therefore, not the cause of death. Even if the original
act is not linked to the death by cause, it may be chargeable as attempted homicide.

CHAPTER 4
4.
Mens Rea in Homicide
Because of the seriousness of taking a life, both as a crime and as a punishment, mens
rea is analyzed more finely in homicide than in any other crime. For centuries the term
malice aforethought has separated killings that were intentional and punishable from
those that were accidental and not punished. Qualifications of the state of mind of the
accused were further divided and subdivided until a thinly layered and not entirely
universal nor objective scheme of culpability emerged. Not all of the points of grad-
ing homicide depend on mens rea; some are determined by the degree of harm in
terms of cruelty, and others by circumstances such as accompanying crimes. Mens
rea, however, forms the framework for the system.
The usual descending order of culpability in the breakdown of mens rea into pur-
poseful, knowing, reckless, and negligent states of mind gets scrambled somewhat
when at issue in homicide. Wanton recklessness can be more serious than an inten-
tional killing in the heat of passion. Even the “malice aforethought” that so staunchly
divides murder from lesser forms of killing has such a slippery meaning that it not
only defies the common understanding of both “malice” and “aforethought,” but also
leaves its legal significance open to a wide range of interpretation. Sir James Stephen
characterized the problem in the Digest of the Criminal Law, 1877.
The loose term “malice” was used, and then when a particular state of mind came
under their notice the Judges called it “malice” or not according to their view of the
propriety of hanging particular people. That is, in two words, the history of the
definition of murder.
Although definitions are often subjective and state variations are many, a general
scheme of grading homicides starts at second degree murder as a baseline, with first
degree murder being those killings aggravated by premeditation or other circum-
stances, and manslaughter being those mitigated by the victim’s provocation or other
circumstances. Check your state statutes.
Capital Murder
1.
First degree murders that are aggravated by specified circumstances and
lacking specified mitigating circumstances.
First Degree Murder
1.
Killings that are purposeful, premeditated, deliberate.
2.
Heinous or cruel killings.
3.
Unintentional killings during the commission of a dangerous felony
(felony murder).
4.
Outrageously reckless acts creating a risk of death to a number of people
(second degree in some jurisdictions).
Second Degree Murder
1.
Intended but not premeditated killings evincing a “depraved heart” or
wanton recklessness.
2.
Killings resulting from a period of extreme emotional distress, not heat
of passion.
3.
Unintentional killings during the commission of a felony (less dangerous
felonies than in first degree felony murder).
Voluntary Manslaughter
1.
Killings on adequate provocation (heat of passion).
2.
Killings when self-defense is not a complete excuse.

Crimes Against Persons and Crimes Against Habitation
■83
Involuntary Manslaughter
1.
Reckless or grossly negligent conduct causing death.
2.
Unintentional killing during the commission of a misdemeanor
(misdemeanor manslaughter).
Reckless Homicide
1.
Vehicular homicide (not intentional).
2.
Negligent homicide.
Note the importance of mens rea in the grading of murder and manslaughter.
5.
Murder
a. Introduction
The malice aforethought that separates murder from other killings
is not hate or spite, nor must it necessarily be of a particular duration. It is a level of
intent that is seen as being particularly dangerous to society. It can be observed in ev-
idence of premeditation, inferred from cruelty or a disregard for human safety, or de-
rived from the intent to commit a different felony.
b. Capital Murder
Federal law and statutes in thirty-eight states allow murderers
to be put to death if the commission of their crimes includes certain aggravating fac-
tors such as previous convictions, special cruelty, vulnerability of the victim, and pay-
ment for the murder. These factors are to be weighed against mitigating factors such
as impaired capacity of the defendant, relatively minor participation in the crime, and
no previous history of crime. United States death penalty requirements are covered
in 18 U.S.C.A. §§ 3591 and 3592. They include special aggravating factors for the death
of a high public official or as the result of a continuing criminal enterprise involving
drug sales, as well as factors involving espionage or treason.
c. Premeditation
Premeditation is the red flag of first degree murder. Any passage
of time allows reservations against killing to surface. Then, the theory goes, if there
are no reservations strong enough to prevent the act, the perpetrator is dangerous in-
deed. The Model Penal Code § 210.2 and some states reject the term “premeditation”
and use “purposely,” “knowingly,” “with deliberation,” or simply “with intent.”
In Willey v. State (Md. 1992), deliberation meant that the defendant “thought
about killing” and was “conscious of his intent to kill” in order for the first degree
murder conviction rather than second degree to be affirmed. Even though the defen-
dant testified that he had no intent to kill his former girlfriend when he shot her, he
had threatened her and described exactly how he would kill her two weeks before he
did so. The court in State v. Guthrie (W.Va. 1995) ruled that “any interval between
forming intent and execution of intent allowing the accused to be fully conscious of
the intent is sufficient” to differentiate it from a second degree murder by “sponta-
neous and nonreflective” action.
d. Heinous or Cruel
The perpetrator’s indifference to pain in an atrociously brutal
killing is enough to aggravate charges to first degree murder in some states, even when
premeditation or deliberation are not shown. Golston, where the definition of brain
death was established, is an example of first degree murder based on the brutality of
the attack. Golston’s blow with a baseball bat opened a four-inch cut in his victim’s
skull. The victim fell, struggled to his feet, and fell again. Two days later his brain ceased
functioning; a week after the attack, life support was withdrawn. Causing such suffer-
ing “for kicks,” as the defendant admitted, constituted “extreme atrocity or cruelty.”
e. Felony Murder
Felony murder typically is an unintentional killing during the
commission of a dangerous felony. The mens rea in the felony transfers to the killing

84
■
CHAPTER 4
to constitute first degree murder in most jurisdictions. When such a statute is unre-
stricted, any death related to a dangerous felony could be included.
A few states, including Hawaii and Kentucky, have abandoned the charge of
felony murder. Other states have adopted one or more of the following restrictions:
the underlying felony must be a cause of the murder; the risk of death must be fore-
seeable; death must be caused by the felon or accomplices, including using a victim
as a shield; the felony must be among strictly enumerated crimes. The Model Penal
Code section 210.2(b) and several states presume an indifference to life in the com-
mission of certain dangerous felonies; it is the indifference to life rather than the
felony that gives rise to the first degree culpability.
Read the decision for State v. Houck in Chapter 8 to see the ramifications of charg-
ing the wrong felony in a felony murder prosecution.
Check your state’s statutes to see how the following cases would be decided in
your jurisdiction.
A carjacking followed by a high-speed chase ended with the defendant’s crash-
ing the stolen vehicle into another car, killing its occupant. Since the taking of the car
and the homicide formed one continuous transaction, the court in State v. Doyle (N.C.
App. 2003) affirmed the felony murder conviction.
Mens rea in killings by someone other than the defendant was based on acts in
furtherance of the underlying crime in People v. Hernandez (N.Y. 1993). In this case it
was ruled not simply coincidental that a police officer was shot by another police of-
ficer in a gunfight after the defendant’s attempted robbery. Felony murder was not
sustained against cofelons who were robbing a restaurant through one entrance while
their accomplices at another entrance were being shot by a security guard, however.
The court in State v. Bonner (N.C. 1992) ruled that the killing must result directly from
the act of the defendant or someone acting in concert with him.
Child abuse murder is similar to felony murder in some states. It does not require
a specific intent to kill the child, but is classified as first degree murder [Workman v.
Mullin (Okla. 2003)]. The Oklahoma statute [Okl. St. Ann. § 701.7(c)] lists elements as:
1.
the death of a child
2.
under the age of 18
3.
as a result of willful or malicious use of unreasonable force
4.
by the defendant.
f. Outrageous Recklessness
A wanton disregard for human life, such as a person
shooting into a crowd or randomly poisoning over-the-counter medicines on a store
shelf is equated with intent in homicide. The general intent to perform an act placing
people in risk of death is usually considered second degree murder but is sufficient
to charge first degree murder in many jurisdictions, particularly when more than one
person has been killed or placed at risk. In these cases the level of risk is an issue to
be weighed. Outrageousness is judged either objectively against what a reasonably
prudent person would do, regardless of knowing the risk, or subjectively by whether
the defendant knew the risk and disregarded it.
Voluntary intoxication is not a defense to recklessness. An intoxicated man en-
tered a bar and shot at his intended victim, missing him and wounding another per-
son. He then shot and wounded the first man and proceeded to shoot randomly and
kill a third person. The court in People v. Register (N.Y. 1983), upholding his conviction,
ruled that “the risk of excessive drinking should be added to and not subtracted from
the risks created by the conduct of the drunken defendant.”
g. Second Degree Murder
Second degree murder, rather than being premeditated
or deliberated, arises from the “wanton recklessness,” “depraved heart,” “depraved
indifference,” or “outrageous disregard for life” of the killer. For a street fight hail of
bullets that killed a bystander, the court in Alston v. State (Md. 1995) ruled that “each
participant has exhibited mens rea that qualifies him for depraved heart murder,” as

Crimes Against Persons and Crimes Against Habitation
■85
an aider and abettor of urban warfare. The defendant convicted of second degree
murder had been fighting against the person whose bullet actually did the killing. A
defendant who fired a pistol into a vehicle on an interstate highway, killing the occu-
pant “without excuse of provocation,” was judged to be aware of “great risk of death
and consciously disregarded it” [King v. State (Ala. Crim. App. 1987)].
Second degree murder also is charged when the defendant has suffered extreme
emotional distress that accumulates and builds beyond sudden heat of passion, the
usual mens rea element in manslaughter. A husband who killed his wife with thirty
to forty blows from a sugar cane machete could not claim that the years of his wife’s
infidelity and their marital squabbles were a provocation to manslaughter. His sec-
ond degree murder conviction was upheld in Douglas v. State (Fla. App. 1995).
Second degree murder also is charged in felony murder when the underlying
felony is less dangerous than that for first degree felony murder. When the facts do
not meet the requirements of first degree murder and exceed those of manslaughter,
second degree murder serves as a catch-all charge.
A second degree murder charge was affirmed against a father who shook his
four-month-old child so severely that the baby died from the resulting brain damage
[State v. Hemphill (N.C. App. 1991)].
Second degree murder can be something of a jury pardon used when “the pro-
priety of hanging” is lacking.

Manslaughter
a. Introduction
Manslaughter is a killing under circumstances deemed less dangerous
to society than those required for the charge of murder. It is a separate crime from mur-
der, not simply a different degree. Although some states do not make a distinction,
manslaughter charges are usually divided between voluntary and involuntary offenses.
b. Voluntary Manslaughter
Malice aforethought is not an element of voluntary
manslaughter, but a specific intent to kill is a requirement in most jurisdictions. An-
other dividing line between murder and voluntary manslaughter is the culpability of
the victim. Generally, a murder victim is relatively innocent, but the victim of volun-
tary manslaughter has provoked the killing. In typical manslaughter cases, the de-
fendant either defends self or family against the victim’s threat with unreasonably
deadly force or is provoked by the victim to a “heat of passion,” to “extreme emo-
tional disturbance,” or by “sudden combat.”
Unreasonable self-defense could be found in Case I if Eldon Spiers simply put his
arm around Kate Lamb’s shoulder and whispered an obscene suggestion in her ear,
and she reacted by pulling a gun and shooting him dead.
For true self-defense, the defendant must subjectively believe that he or she is in
danger and that force is necessary for self-protection. If either or both beliefs are ob-
jectively unreasonable, the defense is flawed, and a charge of voluntary manslaugh-
ter is warranted. In a basketball court dispute the defendant thought the victim was
on the verge of drawing a gun, so the defendant drew first and shot him. The court in
Swann v. U.S. (D.C. App. 1994) ruled that a jury instruction on imperfect self-defense,
voluntary manslaughter, should have been given.
Provocation must be adequate to stir a reasonable person to passion. A defendant
intended to secretly take pictures of his wife with her lover, but when he saw them
engaged in sexual intercourse, he was so enraged that he shot the lover. The court in
State v. Thornton (Tenn. 1987) reduced his first degree murder conviction to voluntary
manslaughter. Adequate provocation can include adultery as well as serious mutual
combat, serious battery or assault, trespass, gestures threatening deadly force, and in-
formational words, such as those in State v. Munoz (N.M. App. 1992). In this case vol-
untary manslaughter was ruled the appropriate charge against a man who killed his
wife’s stepfather on receiving information that the stepfather allegedly sexually mo-
lested the defendant’s wife years earlier.

86
■
CHAPTER 4
To amount to adequate provocation, the gestures and words must go beyond in-
sult. In refusing to reduce a second degree murder charge to voluntary manslaughter
in Girouard v. State (Md. 1991), the Maryland Supreme Court ruled that the taunts of
a wife during a domestic dispute did not constitute adequate provocation. “We per-
ceive no reason for holding in favor of those who find the easiest way to end a do-
mestic dispute is by killing the offending spouse.”
As already seen in the case of People v. Register where intoxication did not mitigate
a charge of outrageously reckless murder, diminished capacity such as partial insanity
or intoxication does not usually mitigate murder to manslaughter. Extreme emotional
disturbance or heat of passion must be externally provoked, not exist as an internal
condition of the defendant. The provocation must be adequate to move a reasonable
person, not just to feed on the quirks of an individual personality, in most statutes.And,
finally, the provocation must actually cause emotional disturbance in the defendant,
without a “cooling off period” that allows the defendant to form a deliberate plan to
murder. Awife’s threat to find someone to have sex with was not immediate or certain
enough to constitute provocation, and the time it took her husband to strangle her with
a belt was sufficient for him to form intent, even though he claimed the killing was
reckless and unintentional [Speake v. State (Ala. Cr. App. 1992)].
The traditional term heat of passion is replaced in the Model Penal Code and in-
creasingly in state statutes by extreme emotional disturbance. The suddenness of passion
that gives way to a cooling off period is replaced by an allowance for a time of brood-
ing, of simmering emotion, and a broader interpretation of adequate provocation. To
compensate for the inclusion of these circumstances more closely approaching the el-
ements of murder, sentencing under statutes using “extreme emotional disturbance”
tends to be more severe (twenty-five years in New York and twenty years in Oregon)
than under those using “heat of passion” (ten years in Virginia).3
c. Involuntary Manslaughter
One type of involuntary manslaughter, misdemeanor
manslaughter, involves the same issues that arise in felony murder. It is an uninten-
tional death accompanying an unlawful act (though not the serious felonies included
in felony murder). The Model Penal Code and some jurisdictions reject it altogether,
and it is restricted in some other jurisdictions by requirements of proximate cause or
criminal negligence.
Poking a helpless, homeless victim with a stick, urinating on him, and kicking dirt
andtrashoverhimwasasufficientunlawfulactforaninvoluntarymanslaughtercharge
when the victim died of a fatal heart attack caused by the battery. [Schlossman v. State
(Md. App. 1995)]. An involuntary manslaughter charge was upheld in State v. Wassil
(Conn. 1995) for delivery of illegal narcotics to the victim who injected them, then died.
Other involuntary manslaughter is the result of criminal negligence or reckless-
ness. No intent to harm is required, but a higher level of negligence or recklessness is
required than that necessary in civil cases for wrongful death. That level of reckless-
ness was not met when a witness to the theft of $110 from a church collection plate
died of a heart attack while chasing the defendant [Todd v. State (Fla. App. 1992)], or
when a wife bled to death after falling on a piece of glass from the lamp her husband
had knocked to the floor during an argument [State v. Torres (Iowa 1993)]. In both
cases the danger was not foreseeable, so manslaughter convictions were reversed.
A manslaughter charge is usually applied when gross negligence is proved in the
handling of such things as explosives, vicious animals, medicines, or public trans-
portation. Also, when there is a duty to act, such as to provide nourishment and med-
ical care to children by parents, death caused by a failure to act often results in a
manslaughter charge. A physician who delivered a premature baby at home without
proper examination of the mother, ignoring obvious signs of respiratory distress syn-
drome in the baby even after the mother asked about them, was convicted of negli-
gent homicide in State v. Warden (Utah 1991). When misread Pap smear tests led to the
cervical cancer deaths of two women, the medical laboratory responsible pleaded no
contest to charges of reckless homicide.4

ANALYSIS PROBLEM
4–1.
The aim in homicide cases to weigh the preciousness of human life
and to fathom the human mind has resulted in a complex, uneven network
of standards and statutes. In your task of deciphering the law so you can
work with it in your own jurisdiction, take some time out to consider it from
your own perspective. Do you agree with the predominant grading scheme
for homicide? Would you feel safer living next to the man who helped the
AIDS patient die and was convicted of murder, or the man who shot his
wife’s stepfather and was convicted of manslaughter? Is the parent who
starves her child to death less culpable than the one who drops hers off a
building? Can a truly “reasonable person” be provoked to kill? If so, why do
we punish such a killing?
d. Vehicular Homicide
Because of the reluctance of juries to convict automobile
drivers of murder or manslaughter, some states have separate statutes for vehicular
homicide, those deaths caused by reckless or negligent driving. The standards of
proof and those for sentencing are less stringent than for involuntary manslaughter.
In some states it is a lesser included offense in manslaughter, and in others it is
manslaughter. In some states it is part of the vehicle code rather than the criminal
code, and in others drunken drivers can face murder charges. An Ohio man pleaded
no contest to charges of running a red light and vehicular homicide when an airbag
deployed in an accident and killed his infant son. Though there was no law requiring
the airbag to be switched off, safety stickers in the vehicle and on the baby’s car seat
warned of the danger. The father was sentenced to spend the child’s birthday and the
anniversary of the accident in jail.5 Guzman v. State (Ga. App. 2003) affirmed the ve-
hicular homicide conviction of a man who provided beer and car keys to a fourteen-
year-old, whose subsequent car accident caused the deaths of his two passengers.
7.
Suicide
Under common law, a suicide victim forfeited his or her possessions to the king. Now
suicide laws focus on those who aid another to commit suicide. Adefendant who held
a gun to the victim’s head and pulled the trigger was guilty of second degree murder,
even though the defendant and victim had agreed to a suicide pact [State v. Sexson
(N.M. App. 1994)]. Directly causing the death was murder; providing the means for
the victim to commit suicide would have been assisted suicide, a separate crime in
New Mexico. Similarly, in California a defendant who strangled an AIDS patient in a
suicide plan was convicted of second degree murder. The intentional, overt act of
strangulation precluded manslaughter charges, People v. Cleaves (Cal. App. 1991).
Dr. Jack Kevorkian famously assisted suicides in Michigan, both before and af-
ter Michigan criminalized such actions in 1993, and was convicted of second degree
murder in 1999. Publicity influenced some states to ban or increase penalties for as-
sisted suicide, and some others to consider legalizing it. Only Oregon explicitly al-
lows a form of physician assistance in suicide. In 2001, Attorney General Ashcroft
directed that physicians using a federally controlled substance to assist suicide could
lose their federal registration to prescribe controlled substances, but a permanent in-
junction against enforcement of that directive was ordered by Oregon v. Ashcroft (9th
Cir. 2004).
Extensive discussions of the principles involved with assisted suicide are found
in the decisions of Compassion in Dying v. Washington (9th Cir. 1996), which overturned
Washington’s ban on assisted suicide, and the subsequent Supreme Court decision in
Washington v. Glucksberg (1997), which reinstated the ban.

untary manslaughter, and manslaughter, and how they are applied in this case.
COMBER v. UNITED STATES
HAYWARD v. UNITED STATES
District of Columbia Court of Appeals, 1990
584 A.2d 26 D.C. App. 1990
[Citations omitted]
. . .
STEADMAN, ASSOCIATE JUDGE
In these consolidated appeals, we are faced with the imme-
diate question of what jury instructions for the crime of
manslaughter are appropriate where a person dies as a re-
sult of bare-fisted blows to the face. Like an unraveling
string, this inquiry has led to and necessitated a more gen-
eral examination of the law of manslaughter and particularly
its division in our jurisdiction into “voluntary” and “involun-
tary” components. . . . Both appellants challenge the volun-
tary manslaughter instructions upon which the juries based
their verdicts.They also raise challenges pertaining to invol-
untary manslaughter instructions: appellant Hayward claims
the trial court erred in refusing to give such an instruction,
while appellant Comber claims the involuntary manslaugh-
ter instruction in his case was improper. Because we agree
with these contentions of instructional error, we reverse and
remand for new trials.
I.
THE HOMICIDES
A.
Appellant Comber
Gilbert Comber apparently did not approve of his sister
Mary Comber’s relationship with Joseph Pinkney. . . . A
friend of the Combers mistakenly told appellant that Pinkney
and Ms. Comber had secretly been married. Saying he was
going to get his sister, appellant went out to the alley where
Ms. Comber and Mr. Pinkney had parked their car. Wit-
nesses differed as to what happened next. All agreed, how-
ever, that Comber, who was substantially smaller by weight
than Pinkney, punched Pinkney either once or twice in the
face. Pinkney, who was extremely intoxicated at the time of
death, fell down, and appellant returned to his house.
Though Pinkney was still conscious after being knocked to
the ground, he later lapsed into unconsciousness; by the
time police arrived, he appeared to be dead. The medical
examiner who performed an autopsy on Pinkney’s body tes-
tified that the cause of death was one or more extremely
forceful blows to the face which caused subarachnoid brain
hemorrhaging, or bleeding in the part of the brain which con-
trols the heartbeat and respiration. According to the medical
examiner, there was no evidence that Pinkney’s death re-
sulted from his head striking the pavement when he fell. Ap-
pellant Comber testified that he struck Mr. Pinkney only
once, and in self-defense. He stated that Pinkney took a
swing at him when he tried to get his sister to return to the
house with him, and that he never intended to kill Pinkney.
B.
APPELLANT HAYWARD
In the early morning hours of November 27, 1987, appellant
Hayward struck Geriel Butler in the jaw. Butler fell into the
street, hit his head, and lost consciousness. He soon re-
gained consciousness, stood up, and walked away. Wit-
nesses disagreed about precisely what happened next, but
they all agreed that appellant Hayward and Butler encoun-
tered one another again a short time later near a van from
which a vendor sold clothes. Appellant Hayward again
punched Butler in the jaw. As Butler fell to the ground, the
back of his head struck the concrete. Butler lost conscious-
ness and died later that morning at D.C. General Hospital.
The medical examiner who performed an autopsy on But-
ler’s body testified that the cause of death was swelling and
herniation of the brain, caused by the impact to the back of
Butler’s head when he fell and hit the ground.
Appellant Hayward testified that he struck Butler in self-
defense. He stated that Butler approached him and asked to
purchase drugs. After being rebuffed, Butler hollered at ap-
pellant Hayward and approached him with his fist balled up.
Thinking Butler was about to hit him, appellant Hayward
struck Butler. Hayward stated that he then walked across
the street to the clothes van, where a short time later Butler
again approached, shaking his fist and seeking retribution
for the earlier incident.Thinking that Butler would strike him,
Hayward again hit Butler, who fell, hitting his head on the
concrete.
II.
THE INSTRUCTIONS
A.
Appellant Comber
After extended discussions, the trial court in Comber’s case
decided to instruct the jury on both the lesser-included of-
fenses 
of 
voluntary 
manslaughter 
and 
involuntary
manslaughter. As to each offense, the judge modified the

Crimes Against Persons and Crimes Against Habitation
■89
District’s standard jury instructions. The court gave the fol-
lowing instructions on voluntary manslaughter:
Now, let me read to you the jury instructions on voluntary
manslaughter. Manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a hu-
man being without malice. Manslaughter is committed when
a human being is killed unlawfully in the sudden heat of pas-
sion caused by adequate provocation as the Court has al-
ready defined those terms for you. The elements of this
offense, each of which the Government must prove beyond
a reasonable doubt are as follows:
One: That the defendant inflicted an injury or injuries
upon the deceased from which the deceased died.
Two: That the killing was committed without legal
justification or excuse.
And three: That the defendant intended to commit the
acts which inflicted the injury or injuries.
To establish the first essential element it is necessary
that the defendant have inflicted an injury or injuries
upon the deceased and that the deceased died as a
result of such injury or injuries.
To establish the second essential element of the
offense it is necessary that you find the defendant guilty
beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant did not
act in self-defense.
And to establish the third essential element it is
necessary that you find that the defendant intended to
commit the act which inflicted the injury or injuries upon
the deceased. (Emphasis added)
On the crime of involuntary manslaughter, the trial court
instructed the jury as follows:
[I]nvoluntary manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a
human being without malice. It may be a killing
committed without a specific intent to kill or even
without the specific intent to inflict injury which causes
death. One may be found guilty of involuntary
manslaughter if you find that his conduct was so
reckless that it involved extreme danger of death or
serious bodily harm and was a gross deviation from the
standard of conduct a reasonable person should have
observed under the circumstances.
Now, the elements of this offense, each of which the
Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt,
are as follows:
One: That the defendant inflicted an injury upon the
deceased from which the deceased died.
Two: That the injury was a result of a course of conduct
involving extreme danger of death or serious bodily
injury.
Three: That although the conduct was not intentional it
amounted to recklessness and was a gross deviation
from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person
should have observed.
And four: That the killing was committed without legal
justification or excuse. (Emphasis added)
According to these instructions, the essential difference
between voluntary and involuntary manslaughter lies in
whether or not the defendant intentionally committed the act
that caused death. In effect, the court instructed the jury that
if Comber intentionally punched Pinkney in the face, the jury
should find him guilty of voluntary manslaughter. On the
other hand, if Comber punched Pinkney only accidentally,
and the unintentional punch rose to the requisite level of
recklessness, then the jury should find him guilty of involun-
tary manslaughter.
B.
Appellant Hayward
Hayward requested instructions on both voluntary and in-
voluntary manslaughter. The trial court agreed to instruct
the jury on voluntary manslaughter, and gave the jury the
following charge:
Voluntary manslaughter . . . is the unlawful killing of a
human being without malice. The essential elements of
the offense of voluntary manslaughter, each of which
the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt
are:
One, that the defendant inflicted an injury or injuries
upon the deceased from which the deceased died;
[A]nd, two, that the killing was committed without legal
justification or excuse.
To establish the first essential element of that offense, it
is as I have told you necessary that the defendant . . .
inflicted an injury or injuries. With regard to the second
element of that offense, it is necessary that the killing or
homicide [was] committed without legal justification or
excuse.
Justifiable homicide is the necessary killing of another
person in the performance of a legal duty or where the
person who kills not being himself at fault has the legal
right to kill. Excusable homicide occurs where the
person who kills although himself at fault had the legal
right so to kill or where the killing was the accidental
result of a lawful act done in a lawful manner.
In response to the appellant’s request for an involuntary
manslaughter instruction, however, the trial court declared
that Butler’s killing “wasn’t . . . a result of recklessness.” Ac-
cordingly, the court refused to give such an instruction.
III.
THE CRIME OF MANSLAUGHTER
A.
Historical Background
Although D.C. Code § 22–2405 (1989) establishes the
penalty for manslaughter, “there is no statutory definition of

90
■
CHAPTER 4
manslaughter in the District of Columbia.” “[M]anslaughter is
defined, rather, by reference to the common law.” . . .
[E]arly statutory developments . . .
led to the division of criminal homicides into murder,
which retained its status as a capital crime, and the
lesser offense of manslaughter. The courts defined
murder in terms of the evolving concept of “malice
aforethought” and treated manslaughter as a residual
category for all other criminal homicides.
Thus, manslaughter, “[i]n its classic formulation . . . con-
sisted of homicide without malice aforethought on the one
hand and without justification or excuse on the other.” Model
Penal Code, supra, § 210.3 comment 1, at 44.
This definition has been adopted in the District of Co-
lumbia. . . .
2.
The division of manslaughter into voluntary and in-
voluntary manslaughter
The broad and undifferentiated early definition of
manslaughter created pressure for refinement. In the same
way that the early common law concept of unlawful homi-
cide had evolved into murder and manslaughter, so too did
manslaughter divide into separate categories of voluntary
and involuntary manslaughter, depending on the type of
conduct involved. . . . Recognition of this distinction was
based at least in part on the perception that voluntary
manslaughters ordinarily involve more culpable behavior
than involuntary manslaughters, and that voluntary
manslaughter frequently warrants a more severe sentence
than involuntary manslaughter. . . .
B.
“Malice Aforethought” for Purposes of Second-
Degree Murder
Because of the relationship between voluntary manslaugh-
ter and murder, an understanding of the scope of the of-
fense of voluntary manslaughter requires an examination of
the states of mind which would make an unlawful killing
second-degree murder. At common law, an unjustified or
unexcused homicide rose to the level of murder if it was
committed with malice aforethought.
For purposes of second-degree murder, “malice afore-
thought” has evolved into “a term of art” embodying several
distinct mental states. . . .
First, a killing is malicious where the perpetrator acts with
the specific intent to kill. Second, a killing is malicious where
the perpetrator has the specific intent to inflict serious bod-
ily harm. Third, “an act may involve such a wanton and will-
ful disregard of an unreasonable human risk as to constitute
malice aforethought even if there is not actual intent to kill or
injure.” [W]e referred to this kind of malicious killing as “de-
praved heart” murder. . . .
Historically, a fourth kind of malice existed when a killing
occurred in the course of the intentional commission of a
felony. Under this “felony-murder” rule, “[m]alice, an essen-
tial element of murder, is implied from the intentional com-
mission of the underlying felony even though the actual
killing might be accidental.” . . .
C.
Justification, Excuse, and Mitigation
Even where an individual kills with one of the four states of
mind described above, the killing is not malicious if it is jus-
tified, excused, or committed under recognized circum-
stances of mitigation. . . .
Unlike circumstances of justification or excuse, legally
recognized mitigating factors do not constitute a total de-
fense to a murder charge. Such circumstances may, how-
ever, serve to “reduc[e] the degree of criminality” of a
homicide otherwise committed with an intent to kill, an intent
to injure, or in conscious and wanton disregard of life.Though
such mitigating circumstances most frequently arise “where
the killer has been provoked or is acting in the heat of pas-
sion, with the latter including fear, resentment and terror, as
well as rage and anger,” mitigation may also be found in other
circumstances, such as “when excessive force is used in self-
defense or in defense of another and ‘[a] killing [is] commit-
ted in the mistaken belief that one may be in mortal danger.’ ”
The mitigation principle is predicated on the legal system’s
recognition of the “weaknesses” or “infirmity” of human na-
ture, . . . as well as a belief that those who kill under “extreme
mental or emotional disturbance for which there is reason-
able explanation or excuse” are less “morally blameworth[y]”
than those who kill in the absence of such influences. . . .
D.
Voluntary Manslaughter
In this jurisdiction, a homicide constitutes voluntary
manslaughter where the perpetrator kills with a state of
mind which, but for the presence of legally recognized miti-
gating circumstances, would render the killing murder. . . .
The government agrees. . . . However, the government
contends that voluntary manslaughter also encompasses
another distinct category of killings, namely, homicides re-
sulting when a defendant acts with the intent to cause any
injury to or apply any force against the victim. Since a killing
occurring under mitigating circumstances would rise to the
level of voluntary manslaughter if the perpetrator acted with
specific intent to cause serious bodily injury, the only killings
included in the government’s proposed definition not al-
ready encompassed by the above-discussed definition are
those resulting from an act committed with intent to cause
non-serious injury but which result in death. For several rea-
sons, we must disagree with the government’s assertion. . . .
We think that both common law and authority make a death-
oriented mental state the determinative dividing line be-
tween the two forms of manslaughter, which should reflect
their differing connotations of culpability. . . .
We must conclude, in conformity with the overwhelming
weight of authority on the matter, that voluntary manslaugh-

Crimes Against Persons and Crimes Against Habitation
■91
1.
Malum in se is defined as “[a] wrong in itself. . . . An act is said
to be malum in se when it is inherently and essentially evil, that is,
immoral in its nature and injurious in its consequences, without any
regard to the fact of its being noticed or punished by the law of the
state.” Black’s Law Dictionary 865 (5th ed. 1979). Malum prohibitum
is defined as “[a] wrong prohibited . . .; an act which is not inherently
immoral, but becomes so because its commission is expressly for-
bidden by positive law. . . .” Id.
ter involves only those homicides where the perpetrator’s
state of mind would constitute malice aforethought and the
homicide murder, but for the presence of legally recognized
mitigating circumstances. If the perpetrator’s state of mind is
not one which would constitute malice, the fact that he or
she intends to inflict non-serious injury or otherwise direct
force against the victim does not render a killing voluntary
manslaughter.Thus, to the extent that a death resulting from
conduct accompanied by an intent to cause something less
than serious bodily injury rises to the level of an unlawful
homicide, it is governed by the involuntary manslaughter
doctrines to which we now turn.
E.
Involuntary Manslaughter
As described in the preceding subsection, voluntary
manslaughter is a killing committed with an intent to kill or
do serious bodily injury, or with a conscious disregard of an
extreme risk of death or serious bodily injury, where the
presence of mitigating factors precludes a determination
that the killing was malicious. The absence of malice under
these circumstances thus reduces the offense to one form
of manslaughter. In contrast, where a killing is not commit-
ted with a specific intent to kill or do serious bodily injury, or
in conscious disregard of an extreme risk of death or seri-
ous bodily injury, there is no question that the killing was
without malice. However, even such an unintentional or ac-
cidental killing is unlawful, and thus constitutes involuntary
manslaughter, unless it is justifiable or excusable. Indeed, it
is the absence of circumstances of justification or excuse
which renders a non-malicious killing “unlawful.” Accord-
ingly, one key to distinguishing those unintentional killings
which are unlawful, and hence manslaughter, from those to
which no homicide liability attaches is determining the cir-
cumstances under which a killing will be legally excused.
Generally, at common law, where a person kills another
in doing a “lawful act in a lawful manner,” the homicide is ex-
cusable. As this phrase implies, two categories of uninten-
tional 
killings 
were 
not 
excused 
and 
thus 
were
manslaughter: killings in the course of lawful acts carried out
in an unlawful, i.e., criminally negligent, fashion, and killings
in the course of unlawful, i.e., criminal, acts.
1.
Criminal-negligence involuntary manslaughter
. . .
Under current law in the District of Columbia, one who
unintentionally causes the death of another as the result of
non-criminal conduct is guilty of involuntary manslaughter
only where that conduct both creates “extreme danger to life
or of serious bodily injury,” and amounts to “a gross devia-
tion from a reasonable standard of care.” Thus, provided it
does not fall within the scope of the misdemeanor-
manslaughter doctrine, conduct resulting in death is ex-
cused unless it creates an extreme risk of death or serious
bodily injury.Indeed, in our jurisprudence the only difference
between risk-creating activity sufficient to sustain a “de-
praved heart” murder conviction and an involuntary reckless
manslaughter conviction “lies in the quality of [the actor’s]
awareness of the risk.”“[I]f [the actor] is aware of the risk, the
crime is murder and not involuntary manslaughter. If he is
not aware . . . and he should have been aware, the crime is
involuntary manslaughter”). The gravity of the risk of death
or serious bodily injury required in each case is the same.
2.
Misdemeanor involuntary manslaughter
The second category of unexcused unintentional homi-
cides are those occurring in the course of certain unlawful
acts. Centuries ago, the “unlawful act” category of involun-
tary manslaughter included all killings occurring in the
course of a criminal act not amounting to a felony, i.e., a
misdemeanor.
The doctrine became known as the
“misdemeanor-manslaughter rule,” something of an ana-
logue to the felony-murder rule. As time passed, however,
the misdemeanor-manslaughter rule “came to be consid-
ered too harsh,” and “the courts began to place limitations
upon it.” Thus, in many jurisdictions, a homicide occurring in
the course of a misdemeanor is involuntary manslaughter
only if the offense is malum in se, rather than malum pro-
hibitum.1 Where the misdemeanor manslaughter doctrine
applies, involuntary manslaughter liability attaches even
where the defendant does not act with the degree of reck-
lessness ordinarily required for involuntary manslaughter
predicated on criminally negligent behavior.In effect, the de-
fendant’s intentional commission of a misdemeanor sup-
plies the culpability required to impose homicide liability.
In
the
District
of
Columbia,
the
misdemeanor-
manslaughter doctrine has developed along substantially
similar lines. Although the doctrine is established in the law
in this jurisdiction, we have been mindful of the danger that
the traditional misdemeanor-manslaughter rule, imposing
involuntary manslaughter liability whenever a killing occurs
in the commission of a misdemeanor malum in se, might
cast too wide a net.The risk of an unreasonable application
of involuntary manslaughter liability is especially pro-
nounced in view of the massive increase since the early
common-law era in the number and forms of misde-
meanors. In Bradford v. United States, supra, 344 A.2d at
215, we described as a variety of involuntary manslaughter
a killing occurring “as the result of an unlawful act which is a
misdemeanor involving danger of injury.”...We think that the
category of misdemeanors dangerous in and of themselves

92
■
CHAPTER 4
encompasses misdemeanors which bear an inherent dan-
ger of physical injury, and includes simple assault, D.C.Code
§ 22–504 (1989), the misdemeanor at issue in this case.
This limitation, however, is incomplete. Although some
misdemeanors, at least when viewed in the abstract, pro-
hibit activity which seems inherently dangerous, they may
also reach conduct which might not pose such danger. A
special difficulty arises in the case of simple assault, as pre-
sented here, because that misdemeanor is designed to pro-
tect not only against physical injury, but against all forms of
offensive touching.To hold a defendant liable for involuntary
manslaughter where a death freakishly results from spitting
at another, putting one’s hand on another in a sexually of-
fensive manner, or lightly tapping another on the face, would
create too severe an attenuation of the link between the
criminal sanction imposed and the defendant’s culpability. In
such circumstances, there is no foreseeable risk of bodily
injury of any appreciable sort.
Accordingly, the fact that death results in the commission
of what is classified as an inherently dangerous misde-
meanor, is alone insufficient to establish guilt of misde-
meanor involuntary manslaughter. Rather, the defendant
must commit the misdemeanor in a way which is dangerous
under the particular circumstances of the case. We think a
misdemeanor will be dangerous under the circumstances if
the manner of its commission entails a reasonably foresee-
able risk of appreciable physical injury. If the manner in
which an inherently dangerous misdemeanor is committed
creates such a foreseeable risk of appreciable physical in-
jury, the defendant should bear the consequences of crimi-
nal homicide if the result is not just bodily injury but death
itself. A killing resulting from a misdemeanor which does not
satisfy the standard just described will be excused.
In sum, it can be seen that as a whole, the law of homi-
cide is broadly symmetrical. The four mental states recog-
nized as malicious for purposes of second-degree murder
exist in manslaughter, as well. One who acts with the spe-
cific intent to kill or to inflict serious bodily injury is guilty of
murder. If those two states of mind are accompanied by
recognized circumstances of mitigation, however, the
crime is voluntary manslaughter. (It is conceivable that vol-
untary manslaughter liability might arise where one, acting
under circumstances of mitigation, consciously disregards
an extreme risk of death of serious bodily injury, but such
scenarios seem highly improbable.) The other two mali-
cious mental states also have corollaries in the involuntary
manslaughter category. One who acts in conscious disre-
gard of an extreme risk of death or serious bodily injury is
guilty of murder, but if he or she is only unreasonably un-
aware of such a risk, the crime is involuntary manslaugh-
ter. Finally, one who kills in the course of a felony
enumerated in D.C.Code § 22–2401 is guilty of murder, but
one who kills in the commission of a misdemeanor under
the circumstances described above is guilty of involuntary
manslaughter.
IV.
THE INSTANT APPEALS
Guided by the foregoing discussion of the law of manslaugh-
ter, we turn now to an assessment of the manslaughter in-
structions in appellants’ cases. We conclude that the jury
instructions given in each case were erroneous.
A.
Appellant Comber
Both the voluntary and involuntary manslaughter instruc-
tions given in appellant Comber’s case misstated the law as
above explicated in significant respects. With regard to vol-
untary manslaughter, the trial court’s instruction erro-
neously defined the mental states required for the offense.
The trial court instructed the jury that to prove voluntary
manslaughter, the government had to prove that the defen-
dant committed an unjustified or unexcused killing, and that
the defendant intended to commit the acts which caused
death. The trial court then explained that to prove a killing
was without justification or excuse, the government had to
prove that the defendant did not kill in self-defense. In effect,
then, the trial court instructed the jury that as long as he
was not acting in self-defense, appellant Comber was guilty
of voluntary manslaughter if he intended to commit some
act which in fact caused Joseph Pinkney’s death, no matter
how unexpectedly. As is plain from our discussion above,
however, to be guilty of voluntary manslaughter, a person
must intend to kill, intend to inflict serious bodily injury, or
act in conscious disregard of an extreme risk of death or se-
rious bodily injury. . . . The instruction thus allowed the jury
to convict Comber of voluntary manslaughter where his
mental state and conduct would not constitute that offense.
The involuntary manslaughter instruction given in Comber’s
case was also erroneous.The instruction described the crimi-
nal negligence variety of involuntary manslaughter, not the
misdemeanor-manslaughter variety. . . . However, the addition
that the jury could find appellant guilty of involuntary
manslaughter only if it concluded that appellant Comber’s con-
duct was not intentional was an incorrect statement of law. Al-
though it is true that an involuntary manslaughter conviction is
appropriate only where death is unintentional, the offense is not
limited to killings resulting from death-producing conduct which
is unintentional. In fact, many intentional acts, provided that
they either involve the creation of the requisite risk of death or
constitute inherently dangerous misdemeanors committed in
such a way that appreciable bodily injury is a foreseeable re-
sult, may constitute involuntary manslaughter.The instructions
given in appellant Comber’s case thus precluded the jury from
finding him guilty of involuntary manslaughter under circum-
stances where such a verdict might have been appropriate.
B.
Appellant Hayward
Two types of instructional error similarly occurred at appellant
Hayward’s trial. First, the trial court gave the standard volun-
tary manslaughter instruction, which erroneously defines that

Crimes Against Persons and Crimes Against Habitation
■93
offense. Second, the trial court refused to give an involuntary
manslaughter instruction upon the defendant’s request.
Unlike the voluntary manslaughter instruction given in ap-
pellant Comber’s case, the voluntary manslaughter instruc-
tion in appellant Hayward’s case contained no description of
the mental state required for the offense but included a defi-
nition of justification and excuse....The instruction makes vol-
untary manslaughter of all unexcused homicides, including
involuntary manslaughter of both the criminal negligence and
misdemeanor varieties. . . . Furthermore, under the instruc-
tions given by the trial court, the jury was authorized to find
Hayward guilty of voluntary manslaughter without ever finding
that he acted with the mental state required for that offense....
Appellant Hayward was entitled to an involuntary man-
slaughter instruction which the trial court declined to give.
C.
Disposition
At bottom, the key element of discussion in this case is not
whether 
appellants 
were 
improperly 
convicted 
of
manslaughter, but whether they were convicted of the
proper type of manslaughter. Because the punishment for
both forms of manslaughter is governed by a single statu-
tory provision, at first blush it may seem that a proper dis-
position of these cases might simply be to remand for re-
sentencing 
for 
involuntary, 
rather 
than 
voluntary,
manslaughter. . . .We recognize, moreover, that to the extent
appellants could have been convicted of involuntary, rather
than voluntary, manslaughter, it might well have been on the
basis of a misdemeanor-manslaughter theory. Just as the
jury must decide in a felony-murder case that the defendant
committed the underlying felony, so too should the jury de-
cide in a misdemeanor-manslaughter case that the defen-
dant committed the underlying misdemeanor and in such a
manner that appreciable physical injury was reasonably
foreseeable. Conversely, in both cases, the evidence could
have supported a jury finding that appellants acted with a
state of mind which would have amounted to malice, but that
each appellant killed in the heat of passion so that the killing
was mitigated to voluntary manslaughter. Because the evi-
dence was sufficient to support such a conclusion, the gov-
ernment is entitled to retry both appellants on the charge of
voluntary manslaughter. We conclude under all the circum-
stances that retrial is appropriate for both appellants.
Reversed and remanded.
C.
ASSAULT AND BATTERY
1.
Introduction
Some statutes separate the definitions of “assault,” the threat or attempt to cause in-
jury, and “battery,” actual harmful contact between the perpetrator and victim. Oth-
ers, including federal laws and the Model Penal Code  211.1, include the definition of
battery as one type of assault. Assault or battery can be simple, usually a misde-
meanor, or aggravated by circumstances raising it to the level of a felony. Other
charges, such as reckless or wanton endangerment, menacing, stalking, and terroris-
tic threatening often are included in assault statutes.
Federal assault prosecutions, like federal homicide prosecutions, are rare because
federal laws only establish jurisdiction over “forcible resistance or interference with,
or assault upon” officers of the United States, 18 U.S.C.A. § 111; on foreign officers, 18
U.S.C.A. § 112; and within maritime and territorial areas, 18 U.S.C.A. § 113. The fed-
eral stalking statute, 18 U.S.C.A. § 2261A, however, covers crimes involving the cross-
ing of state lines.
2.
Battery
The actus reus of battery is physical injury or offensive touching of another person. The
amount of harm varies, with some states including intimate fondling or a spit in the face.
Others and the Model Penal Code require actual injury, leaving other offenses to crimi-
nal sexual conduct statutes and civil law. No actual injury or even contact with the vic-
tim was necessary, however, for an aggravated battery conviction in State v. Townsend
(Ida. 1993). The defendant had intentionally struck his wife’s car with his truck.
In all jurisdictions the mens rea element of battery can be intent to injure or offen-
sively touch. In most jurisdictions negligence is sufficient to convict for battery when
harm is caused “with a deadly weapon.” As in felony murder, a few states allow intent
to commit some other unlawful act to serve as the mens rea for battery when injury

94
■
CHAPTER 4
occurs as a result of the commission of that act.6 In some cases, intent can be trans-
ferred. People v. Psichalinos (Ill. App. 1992) upheld the conviction of a defendant who
aimed a swinging fist at another adult, knowing injury would be the result, and acci-
dentally struck a child.
Battery mens rea is negated when there is justification for the intent to make
harmful contact. In Chapter 1, Case I, someone who pushed Kate Lamb back from the
bridge rail to prevent her from jumping off would not be guilty of battery.
Consent is assumed in contact sports where injury might occur in furtherance of
the object of the game. A tackled football player cannot press charges for battery, for
example, but a recreational basketball player who came off the bench and attacked an
opposing player during a break in the game was guilty of battery [State v. Floyd (Iowa
App. 1990)]. Likewise, there is an allowance for the reasonable discipline of a child by
parents or other authorities, but excessive force amounts to battery, or the separate
crime of child abuse. See justification defenses in Chapter 7 for a discussion of the
parental discipline justification.
3.
Assault
Whereas battery may be committed recklessly, assault involves purposeful intent.
One type of assault is attempted battery. Here, the intent is obviously to commit the
battery. This is an inchoate crime, because the battery is not completed and there is no
injury. The victim need not even be aware of the attempt. As in other attempt crimes,
the assailant must take substantial steps toward completing the battery. In some states
the “present ability” to commit the battery must exist; that is, the victim must be
within reach, the gun must be loaded, and so forth.
Where “present ability” was not required, the defendant was convicted of aggra-
vated assault for firing into the victim’s home, not knowing that no one was there [Com-
monwealth v. Lopez (Pa. Super. 1995)]. The battery attempted may be extremely slight,
and an assault (attempted battery) conviction may be affirmed even though the battery
was actually completed. The assault conviction of a defendant who spat in a police of-
ficer’s face during a narcotics arrest was affirmed in Ray v. U.S. (D.C. App. 1990).
Another type of assault is threatened battery, where the intent is to frighten the vic-
tim. Though no physical injury occurs, this is a complete rather than an inchoate crime.
Generally, the victim knows of the threat and does, in fact, fear serious injury as a re-
sult of it. Because the harm done is the creation of an emotional state, the actual ability
to commit battery is not usually necessary, only the perception by the victim that the
assailant is able to carry out the threat. A homeless man in an alley held a paring knife
while demanding of a passerby, “What are you looking at? Get out of here.” The court
in Mihas v. U.S. (D.C. App. 1992) ruled that when an item has a legitimate use, the pur-
pose for which it is carried is the ultimate test for whether it is a deadly or dangerous
weapon. Although the defendant claimed he was using the two-and-a-half-inch blade
to clean his fingernails, his hostile words and approach within four feet of the victim
constituted assault. The dissenting opinion noted that the mens rea of the defendant
should have been taken into account along with the perceptions of the victim.
After a physical altercation with her husband, a woman locked herself in the
bathroom and heard a clicking sound that she thought was her husband’s loaded
shotgun just outside the door. He said he was in the kitchen cleaning the gun. His con-
viction for assault was reversed for lack of proof of intent to cause fear [Commonwealth
v. Spencer (Mass. App. 1996)].
Actual fear was not required as proof of “reasonable apprehension of serious bod-
ily injury” in State v. McMahon (Mont. 2003). The victim looked calm and said he was
not afraid after his estranged wife pulled a gun on him and he wrestled it away from
her. He did say that he hoped the safety was on and thought she would probably
shoot him and maybe someone else.
Words alone do not form assault, particularly if they are conditional or if the
threat is not immediate. Statements such as “I’d kick you if you weren’t a girl” or “I’ll

Crimes Against Persons and Crimes Against Habitation
■95
be back tomorrow with a gun” are not assault. Positioning oneself for the kick or aim-
ing a gun at the victim is assault.
Some states do not have assault statutes, but include these offenses in attempt,
threatening, and menacing statutes. Some states use the term assault in place of bat-
tery to define actual contact causing injury or offensive touching.
4.
Aggravated Assault and Battery, Mayhem
Mutual consent, as in a fight willingly engaged in by both combatants, is a mitigat-
ing circumstance reducing battery to a petty misdemeanor in many jurisdictions. Sev-
eral aggravating circumstances may elevate both assault and battery to the felony
level, however: assault or battery of a police officer on duty or of a child or otherwise
helpless or designated person, with a force likely to cause serious injury, with intent
to commit a violent felony, or with a deadly weapon or dangerous instrument.
In determining what could be classified as a dangerous instrument in aggravated
assault, the court in U.S. v. Johnson (4th Cir. 1963) held that, “Not the object’s latent ca-
pability alone, but that, coupled with the manner of its use, is determinative.” The in-
strument must not only be capable of use as a weapon, but also be used or
intentionally displayed, not just rest in the possession of the assailant. Unconven-
tional “weapons,” including hiking boots in a kicking attack [People v. Deperna
(N.Y.A.D. 3 Dept. 2003)], and thrown fecal matter from an HIV and hepatitis B posi-
tive defendant [Commonwealth v. Brown (Pa. 1992)], have been accepted in aggravated
assault and battery cases. A defendant who slammed his wife’s head against a bath-
tub, sink, and toilet, however, was not “armed” with a dangerous weapon [Edwards v.
U.S. (D.C. App. 1990)], nor was the man who threw a woman overboard five miles
from shore [Commonwealth v. Shea (Mass. App. 1995)], because neither the bathroom
fixtures nor the ocean were under the defendants’ control. Codefendants in People v.
Aguilar (Cal. 1996) were both convicted of aggravated assault for kicking and beating
their victim, one under the “deadly weapon” clause, the other under the “force likely
to produce great bodily injury” clause of the statute. The conviction of the first was re-
versed because only “objects extrinsic to the body” could be considered deadly
weapons. The conviction of the second was affirmed.
Laws against mayhem, the permanent dismembering or disabling of another per-
son, are still on the books in some states. Specific intent or the intent to do bodily in-
jury is an element. Other states include mayhem in aggravated battery statutes.

CHAPTER 4
An injury may be considered permanent for the purposes of a mayhem convic-
tion even though cosmetic surgery is feasible [People v. Hill (Cal. 1994)]. The intoxi-
cated defendant beat the victim after the victim’s car bumped his while parking.
The victim’s injuries required metal plates and wires to hold his facial bones in
place, left his eye sunken with double and triple vision, and impaired sensation in
his upper lip.

and battery.

Court of Special Appeals of Maryland, 1992.

[Citations omitted]
. . .
MOYLAN, JUDGE
The appellant, Todd William Lamb, was convicted by a Som-
erset County jury, presided over by Judge Daniel M. Long,
of (1) breaking and entering, (2) assault, (3) battery, (4) false
imprisonment, and (5) reckless endangerment. He received
a sentence of two years for breaking and entering and that
judgment is of no further concern to us. The conviction for
reckless endangerment was merged into that for assault
and is also of no further concern to us.
The appellant received a consecutive sentence of ten
years for assault, a consecutive sentence of six years for
battery, and a consecutive sentence of six years for false im-
prisonment for a total of twenty-four years. He now argues:
1.
That his conviction for assault should, as a lesser in-
cluded offense, have merged into his conviction for
battery; and
2.
That his conviction for battery, in turn, should also,
as a lesser included offense, have merged into his
conviction for false imprisonment.
With the three convictions thus merged in the fashion the
appellant would have them merged, his total sentence of
twenty-four years would be reduced to a sentence of but
eight years. . . .
THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG ASSAULTS AND
BATTERIES
We turn our attention initially to the arguable merger of as-
sault into battery. It requires us to look at the crime (or
crimes) of assault and the crime (or crimes) of battery gen-
erally and then to look at the particular assault in this case
and the particular battery in this case specifically. Our gen-
eral investigation will be doomed at the outset if we conceive
of it as an exploration of the relationship between assault and
battery. We must conceptualize it, rather, as an exploration
of the multiple relationships among various assaults and var-
ious batteries. The key to avoiding the almost hopeless con-
fusion clogging much of the case law is to think plural.
Ironically, it is sometimes these seemingly simplest of
crimes that are the most difficult to master. . . .The elements
of latter-day statutory crimes, no matter how intricate, have
been hammered out on the legislative anvil with meticulous
precision. The common law standbys, by contrast, have
grown by gradual and random accretion. As with a coral
reef, there is no perceptible change from year to year. Over
centuries, however, there develop forms and shapes that
bear but slight resemblance to the aboriginal prototype.
Once reliable descriptions lose currency. Thus has it been
with assault and battery.
THE VARIOUS FORMS OF ASSAULT
Today, the term of art “assault” may connote any of three dis-
tinct ideas:
1.
A consummated battery or the combination of a con-
summated battery and its antecedent assault;
2.
An attempted battery; and
3.
A placing of a victim in reasonable apprehension of
an imminent battery.
A.
A Battery Itself or a Combined “Assault and
Battery”.
By way of informal (or sometimes even formal) shorthand,
both the case law and the statutory law frequently use the
simple noun “assault” to connote a consummated battery
alone and at other times to connote the combination of the
inchoate attempt to beat or to batter followed immediately by
the consummation of that attempt. . . .
When the word “assault” is used in this comprehensive
way exclusively to connote or inclusively to embrace a bat-
tery, one cannot, of course, speak of a relationship be-

Crimes Against Persons and Crimes Against Habitation
■97
tween assault and battery. The present problem before us,
however, deals with a relationship. This broad meaning of
the word “assault,” therefore, will be used no further in this
opinion and all subsequent discussion will deal only with
those narrower and more precise connotations of “as-
sault” that are distinct from any suggestion of a consum-
mated battery.
B.
An Attempted Battery:
One of the two more precise meanings of the term “assault”
is that of an attempted battery.This was the only meaning of
“assault” at the early criminal law. . . .
As an attempt, it is, of course, a specific intent crime.The
specific object or purpose intended is the commission of a
battery, the inflicting of physical injury upon the victim or
some other offensive touching of the victim. As with all at-
tempts, the assault of the attempted-battery variety is es-
tablished regardless of whether the effort succeeds or fails
to achieve its purpose. . . .
That original, criminal-law meaning of “assault” as an at-
tempted battery has, to be sure, retained its full vitality.
What it has lost is its exclusivity. For those who have not
kept pace with the loss of exclusivity, the resultant narrow
conceptualization of assault simply as an attempted battery,
and nothing more, has given rise to such slippery and
treacherous half-truths (to be more fully discussed here-
inafter) as:
1.
Assault is an inchoate crime;
2.
Assault requires a specific intent to commit a battery;
3.
Every battery includes an assault;
4.
There can be no such crime as an attempted assault.
None of these familiar and oft-quoted “principles” is to-
tally true. None of them, however, is totally false.They are all
half-truths; and therein lurks their insidious capacity to lead
the unwary astray.
C.
A Threatening of an Imminent Battery:
The more recent accretion to the coral reef of criminal as-
sault is the replication in that new environment of the famil-
iar tort of assault. . . .
“This action, which developed very early as a form of
trespass, is the first recognition of a mental, as distinct
from a physical, injury. There is ‘a touching of the mind,
if not of the body.’ ”
For this variety of assault, it is not necessary that the vic-
tim be actually frightened or placed in fear of an imminent
battery at the hands of one with the apparent present abil-
ity to commit such a battery.The critical state of mind on the
part of the victim is to be placed “in reasonable apprehen-
sion” of an impending battery.This distinction preserves the
rights of the intrepid crime victim or intrepid plaintiff. . . .
The Maryland State Bar Association’s Maryland Crimi-
nal Pattern Jury Instructions has handled the plural nature
of common law assault by providing not one recommended
instruction, but three. MPJI-CR 4:01.1 defines for the jury
the necessary elements of assault of the “intent to frighten”
variety. MPJI-CR 4:01.2 provides a different instruction, list-
ing different elements, for assault of the “attempted battery”
variety. MPJI-CR 4:01 provides an omnibus instruction for
the situation where the evidence of assault supports either
variety of the crime. It begins by informing the jury of the plu-
ral nature of the crime:
“The defendant is charged with the crime of assault.
There are two types of assault. The first type is
committed by intentionally making another person fear
immediate [offensive physical contact] [physical harm].
The second type is committed by actually attempting to
cause [offensive physical contact] [physical harm].”
It then takes up each of the two varieties in turn, providing a
separate list of required elements for each. It does not at-
tempt to lump the two together under any sort of composite
definition.
D.
A Comparison of Attempted Battery and
Intentional Frightening:
Leaving aside for the moment any connotation of “assault”
as either (1) a consummated battery or (2) a combination of
assault and battery, the remaining two connotations alone il-
lustrate how dangerous it is to make any generalized state-
ment about the “crime of assault.” A perfectly correct, albeit
incomplete, statement will frequently be made about one
species of assault. The unwary auditor or reader, however,
will unwittingly assume that the given description of one
species of assault applies with equal validity to the entire
genus “assault.” That description may then, in turn, be erro-
neously misapplied to a different species of assault as to
which is totally inappropriate.
Assault of the attempted battery variety, for instance, is
an inchoate crime. It shares with all other attempts the gen-
eral characteristics of that variety of inchoate crime. Assault
of the intentional threatening variety, on the other hand, is
not in any sense inchoate. It is a fully consummated crime
once the victim is placed in reasonable apprehension of an
imminent battery.
It is generally agreed that an assault of either variety re-
quires only an apparent present ability rather than an actual
present ability to consummate the battery. The apparency,
however, is assessed from opposite perspectives. For an
assault of the attempted battery variety, there must be an
apparent present ability from the viewpoint of the would-be
assailant. Unless he thinks he can execute the battery, he
will lack the required specific intent to do so.
For an assault of the intentional frightening variety, on the
other hand, the assailant may be guilty even though he
knows full well that he lacks any ability to follow through on
his threat. That he knows the gun he points is unloaded or
defective or is no gun at all is of no consequence. . . . All that

98
■
CHAPTER 4
is required in terms of perception is an apparent present
ability from the viewpoint of the threatened victim. If, on the
other hand, the would-be victim of the threat is unaware of
the threatening conduct, there can be no assault of this va-
riety. If the would-be victim perceives the threatening con-
duct but knows, for instance, that the gun is defective, there
is no apprehension of an imminent battery and, therefore,
no assault of the threatening variety.
In terms of whose perception matters, that aspect of as-
sault which came originally from the criminal law, concerned
as it is with blameworthiness, is primarily defendant-
oriented.That aspect of criminal assault which appeared ini-
tially in tort law, concerned as it is with harm, is primarily
victim-oriented.
Both varieties of assault are specific intent crimes. The
specific intents, however, are not identical. An assault of the
attempted battery variety requires a specific intent to per-
petrate a battery. No design or purpose to threaten or to
frighten the victim is in any way necessarily implicated, al-
though it certainly is not precluded. An attempted battery
can be perpetrated on a victim who is asleep, is facing in an-
other direction or is otherwise oblivious of any danger. A
truly deadly assailant may, indeed, prefer not to tip his hand
with any antecedent threat.
An assault of the intentional frightening variety, on the
other hand, requires a specific intent to place the victim in
reasonable apprehension of an imminent battery. That the
assailant definitely does not intend to carry through on the
threat is of no consequence. If, however, the threatening as-
sailant does intend to carry through on the threat and at-
tempts to do so, then both varieties of assault have
converged in a single criminal attack. The two forms of as-
sault need not necessarily be in the alternative. They may
combine and they frequently do.
In terms of specific intent, the attempted battery variety
of assault requires that the assailant intend to punch,
whether he intends to signal the punch or not.The threaten-
ing variety of assault, on the other hand, requires that the as-
sailant intend to signal the punch, whether he intends to
punch or not.
THE VARIOUS FORMS OF BATTERY
Today, the term of art “battery” may connote either of two
forms of offensive touching or other application of force:
1.
An intended battery; or
2.
An unintended battery.
A.
An Intended Battery
The definition of the physical component of the common law
misdemeanor of battery is hornbook law.It is any unlawful ap-
plication of force, direct or indirect, to the body of the victim....
The overwhelming majority of the criminal batteries that
are committed are intended and this has led to the mistaken
belief that all criminal batteries are intended. An intended
battery is, by definition, a specific intent crime. It embraces
its inchoate antecedent of assault, attempted-battery vari-
ety, which involves, of course, precisely the same specific
intent to perpetrate the battery. The combination of the at-
tempt and its successful consummation is classic “assault
and battery.” Almost all statements made about the relation-
ship between an assault and a battery take for granted that
the battery was intended.
B.
An Unintended Battery
The field of criminal battery, however, is actually more com-
plicated than many realize because of the less well-known
inclusion in that field of unintended batteries. When the
physical application of force is inflicted on the body of the
victim, the specific intent to harm the victim is not the only
mens rea that may give rise to the crime of battery. There
are two separate forms of unintended battery. . . .
What we have in the case of the unintended batteries are
two nonfatal, junior-varsity analogues to two similarly blame-
worthy states of mind in cases of unintended murders and in-
voluntary manslaughters. When unintended harm results
from the doing of an act malum in se, the resulting crime may
be, if death results, unintended murder under the common law
felony-murder doctrine or involuntary manslaughter under the
analogous common law misdemeanor-manslaughter doc-
trine. If death does not result, there is an unintended battery.
The other set of unintended crimes arises out of criminal
negligence. The unintended harm, if death results, may be
unintended murder if the indifference to the consequences
is sufficiently wanton and reckless to constitute depraved-
heart murder. If the state of mind is less than depraved but
still a case of gross criminal negligence, it is involuntary
manslaughter. At the nonfatal level, it is unintended battery.
An intended battery is, by definition, a specific-intent
crime. An unintended battery, on the other hand, requires
only a general intent to do 1) the criminally negligent act or
2) the unlawful act, with no thought being necessary as to
the consequences of such act.
* * *
These then are the various forms of common law assault
and the various forms of common law battery with which the
case law must contend. One may as well attempt to trisect
an angle or to carry out Pi to the last decimal place as to pro-
vide a single definition for these plural phenomena. At-
tempts to do so have produced numerous misstatements
and half-truths.Those misstatements and half-truths should
be laid to rest.
HALF-TRUTH NO. 1: “ASSAULT IS AN INCHOATE
CRIME”
The half-truth “assault is an inchoate crime” is frequently
heard. . . .

Crimes Against Persons and Crimes Against Habitation
■99
When, as previously discussed, the word “assault” is
used as a synonym for “battery” or as a synonym for the
combination “assault and battery,” it obviously is not an in-
choate crime. It is or it includes a fully consummated battery.
. . . As an attempted battery, it is, of course, inchoate. All
attempts are inchoate. It is, by definition, an inchoate bat-
tery. In its other manifestation, that of placing the victim in
reasonable apprehension of an imminent battery, it is, how-
ever, in no sense inchoate. It is a fully consummated crime
in its own right. . . .
HALF-TRUTH NO. 2: “ASSAULT REQUIRES A
SPECIFIC INTENT TO COMMIT A BATTERY”
...An assault of the attempted-battery variety does indeed in-
volve, by definition, a specific intent to commit the battery. An
assault of the threatening variety, on the other hand, does not
necessarily include any such intent. It is enough that the as-
sailant intends to place the victim in reasonable apprehension
of an imminent battery, even if the assailant possesses the di-
ametric specific intent not to commit the threatened battery.
HALF-TRUTH NO. 3: “EVERY BATTERY INCLUDES
AN ASSAULT”
. . . An intended battery includes, by its very nature, an an-
tecedent attempt, which is a form of assault.
An unintended battery, on the other hand, does not in-
clude such an attempt (or assault) lest it lose its very char-
acter of being unintended. An unintended battery, moreover,
normally will not include an assault of the intended frighten-
ing variety. . . .
HALF-TRUTH NO. 4: “THERE CANNOT BE AN
ATTEMPTED ASSAULT”
The half-truth that “there cannot be an attempted assault” is
deeply entrenched. . . .
Such a misconception obviously results from the misper-
ception of the common law crime of assault as an attempted
battery and nothing else. . . .
May there be an attempted assault? The answer is obvi-
ously both “no” and “yes.” There may not, of course, be an
attempted assault of the attempted-battery variety. That
type of assault is already inchoate and there may not be an
attempted attempt.
Where the assault, on the other hand, is of the intent-to-
frighten variety, there is no reason whatsoever why there
cannot be an attempt to commit it. One attempts to put a vic-
tim in reasonable apprehension of an imminent battery, but,
for some reason, the victim (unconscious, blind, deaf) fails
to apprehend the danger. The assault that was contem-
plated was not of an inchoate crime but of a fully consum-
mated crime. It, therefore, like any other crime may be
attempted as long as the normal prerequisites of attempt
law are satisfied. It would not be an attempted attempt,
which is the only thing that gave rise to the old cliche in the
first place. . . .
* * *
As we turn to the case at hand, it is against the backdrop
that Assault and Battery, Combined, are by no means the
simple ABC’s of criminal law.
THE BATTERY IN ISSUE:
The present case involves one of those paradoxical situa-
tions where the physical battery of the victim not only did not
embrace but was actually far less serious than an assault
upon that victim during the same time frame that did not in-
volve any ultimate application of force.The battery conviction
was under the sixth count. Upon that conviction, the appel-
lant received a sentence of six years.We meticulously distin-
guish that conviction on the sixth count from the separate
conviction on the fifth count, charging assault alone, for which
the appellant received a consecutive sentence of ten years.
The sixth count itself literally charged the classic combi-
nation of “assault and battery” as it alleged that the appellant
“did make an assault upon and did batter Sharon Lynn Herz.”
That is the garden variety assault and battery combination.
The battery was of the ordinary intentional sort, involving a
specifically intended and attempted application of physical
force to the body of the victim. As such, it comprehended the
inchoate attempt (assault) and the immediate consumma-
tion of that attempt (battery) in one intertwined totality. That
assault, obviously of the attempted-battery variety, was, as
a matter of course, subsumed within its complementary and
consequential battery for purposes of pleading, verdict and
sentencing. It is to be carefully distinguished from the sepa-
rate charge of assault drawn under the fifth count.
The gravamen of that assault-and-battery conviction un-
der the sixth count was the physical harm literally inflicted
upon the body of Sharon Lynn Herz. It embraced no other
variety of trauma, for battery never does. To analyze the ex-
tent of that battery, therefore, we must set out the full extent
of all physical touching involved.
The entire criminal episode took place at Sharon Herz’s
apartment in Crisfield on May 13, 1990, between approxi-
mately 8:30 P.M. and 11:50 P.M. Ms. Herz had known the ap-
pellant for almost four years, since the summer of 1986. For
a time, the two of them lived together in Baltimore City. Ms.
Herz bore a daughter, Brittany, to the appellant. In May of
1988, two years before the crimes involved in this case, Ms.
Herz and the appellant separated. Ms. Herz moved in ini-
tially with her sister on Maryland Avenue in Baltimore and
subsequently moved to her apartment in Crisfield. . . .
On May 13, Ms.Herz ...got off from work at approximately
7:30 P.M., picked up Brittany and the two of them returned
home.Ms.Herz gave Brittany her bath and put her to bed.She
then performed a few miscellaneous chores about the apart-
ment and took a shower. As she walked downstairs from her
shower, the time was about 8:30 P.M. As Sharon Herz turned

CHAPTER 4
the corner into her living room, she saw the appellant stand-
ing in front of her.In a subsequent statement to the police, the
appellant stated that he had pried the door open with a knife.
In his testimony, he claimed that he had climbed in through an
open window. In either event, Sharon Herz was then required
to remain in the apartment, under the appellant’s compulsion,
for approximately the next three-and-a-half hours.
Three times during that period—once early, once in the
middle and once late—the appellant perpetrated a literal
battery upon her. Neither the indictment nor the jury in-
structions nor the arguments of counsel nor the verdicts at-
tempted to make any distinction on a time line between
those three discrete applications of physical force. Neither
do we. They occurred in the course of a single, albeit pro-
tracted, criminal episode and may well be treated as a sin-
gle battery.The critical distinction is not on the time line but,
rather, in the nature of the respective harms inflicted.
The first installment of the battery occurred as soon as Ms.
Herz saw the appellant standing in her living room. She im-
mediately screamed. As she went to scream a second time,
he capped his hand over her mouth, pushed her against the
wall, and ordered her “to stop screaming and to be quiet.” Ef-
fectively gagging his victim with a hand over her mouth and
pushing her against a wall was a quintessential battery.What
then followed for the next few hours, to be more fully discussed
hereinafter, constituted criminal conduct other than a battery.
The second installment of the battery occurred an hour
or two later as Sharon Herz’s brother-in-law, Jay Freeman,
stood at the front door of the apartment. The appellant ini-
tially stood behind the door and, pointing a gun at Ms. Herz,
directed her to get rid of her brother-in-law. In the course of
the confrontation, however, the appellant moved into the
open doorway to make his point more forcefully. As he did
so, he pressed the barrel of the gun into the right side of Ms.
Herz’s body as he simultaneously placed his left arm around
the upper part of her body.Jay Freeman then obeyed the ap-
pellant’s direction to leave, asking the appellant, “Well, just
don’t hurt her. Calm down, don’t hurt her.” Putting Ms. Herz
in a wrestler’s hold with his left arm while pressing a gun
barrel in her ribs was also a quintessential battery.
The third and final installment of the battery occurred
near the end of the criminal episode, as the police arrived at
the apartment and faced down the appellant. The appellant
had already ordered Ms. Herz to the top of the stairs, where
he and she sat on the top step facing the police in the door-
way below. In the course of the standoff, the appellant with
his left hand had pressed the barrel of the gun against Ms.
Herz’s temple and locked his right arm around her neck.
That also constituted a classic battery. . . .
THE ASSAULT IN ISSUE:
The assault charged under the fifth count, by contrast, was
no mere attempted or inchoate form of battery. That other
(attempted-battery) variety of assault was alleged in the dis-
tinct sixth count and was properly subsumed in the battery
conviction.The fifth count alleged a far more serious offense
than that involved in the sixth count. It was the deliberate
placing of Sharon Herz in reasonable apprehension of hav-
ing a bullet fired into her head. . . .
As the sentencing reflected, the placing of Sharon Herz
in literal fear of her life was unquestionably the most serious
charge for which the appellant was convicted. The relative
gravity of various charges is something that has to be de-
termined on an ad hoc basis and does not lend itself to res-
olution in the abstract. Compared to the threat to her life, the
breaking and entering by the former live-in boyfriend was
secondary. Being confined for almost three-and-a-half
hours was also, compared to the threat to life, relatively sec-
ondary. Clearly secondary as well was the physical touching
actually suffered.
The evidence overwhelmingly demonstrated that the ap-
pellant deliberately placed Ms. Herz in fear of her life. Imme-
diately after she confronted him in her living room, he pushed
her against the wall and told her to stop screaming. As she
started crying, he told her to sit down on the floor. It was then
that he lifted up his shirt and revealed, stuck in the front of his
pants, a .38 revolver. From that point on, the conversation be-
tween them continuously reverted to the question of what he
was going to do with the gun and whether he was going to
harm her.For most of the time, the appellant took the gun from
his pants and held it in his hand.The first time he took the gun
out, Ms. Herz asked him what he was going to do with it and
“he kept saying he didn’t know and he was holding it then.”. . .
The appellant himself recognized that the trauma he in-
flicted on Sharon Herz was not so much physical as psychic.
In the course of his statement to the police, he observed:
“Sharon came out of the shower. Sharon got dressed
for bed and also came downstairs where I scared the
shit out of her.”
At one point during the confinement, the telephone rang.
Ms. Herz explained that if she didn’t answer it, the caller
would know that something was wrong. The appellant then
let her answer but kept the gun pointed toward her while she
was on the phone. When, shortly thereafter, Ms. Herz’s
brother-in-law showed up at the door, the appellant stood
behind the door with the gun trained on her. A minute or so
into that conversation, he moved into the doorway and held
her with one arm, while pressing the gun barrel against her
with his other hand. The appellant terminated this brief en-
counter with Jay Freeman with the conditional threat, “If you
don’t go to the police, I won’t hurt her.” Freeman assured
him that he was only going to work.The appellant repeated,
“Just don’t go to the police and she won’t get hurt.”
Ms. Herz’s apprehension grew as the appellant locked
the door.“He started getting shaky and he was nervous and
I was starting to cry.” Ms. Herz warned him that this might be
his last chance to leave and he replied, “I’m not leaving,
they’ll get me anyway.” The picture created was of a des-

Crimes Against Persons and Crimes Against Habitation
■101
perate and emotionally-distraught man who thought he had
nothing to lose by killing her.
When the police team arrived at the apartment at 11:50
P.M., a deadly facedown occurred, during every split-second
of which Sharon Herz’s life hung in the balance. When the
first knock at the door occurred, the appellant ordered Ms.
Herz upstairs. When she initially demurred, he cocked the
gun and pointed it at her and reiterated, “Yes, we’re going
upstairs.” At the top of the stairs, the appellant positioned
her between himself and the police, using her as a human
shield. As the police at the foot of the stairs trained their
guns on him, he held his gun at Ms. Herz’s temple.
The threatened and imminent battery that Sharon Herz
feared, but which fortunately never came to pass, was not
the appellant’s shoving of her against a wall or his hand
across her mouth or his arm about her neck and shoulder. It
was the terrifying dread that in the next split-second, a bul-
let could implode into her skull....The threatened killing that
never took place was on a plane far transcending the rela-
tively trivial wrestling that did take place and certainly was
not subsumed within it. . . .
Assault under the fifth count will not merge, as a lesser
included offense, into battery under the sixth count for ei-
ther of two reasons. As an abstract proposition, assault of
the threatening variety is not “the same offense” as the
battery thus threatened, within the contemplation of
Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299, 52 S.Ct. 180,
76 L.Ed. 306 (1932). Assault of the attempted-battery va-
riety, of course, is a lesser included offense within its
greater inclusive offense of intended battery, for it pos-
sesses no legal element of its own. Assault of the threat-
ening variety, on the other hand, possesses a required
element—the reasonable apprehension in the mind of the
victim—not possessed by battery. Battery, for its part, pos-
sesses a required element—the offensive touching—not
possessed by assault. Double jeopardy law according to
Blockburger would never, therefore, mandate a merger of
an assault into a battery when the assault is of the threat-
ening variety.
Quite independently, the assault conviction will not
merge into the battery conviction under the particular facts
of this case because the battery that was threatened under
the assault (fifth) count was not the same as the battery that
was consummated under the sixth count. The threatened
battery never took place and there was nothing, therefore,
into which the antecedent threat might properly merge,
even if merger were otherwise appropriate.
FALSE IMPRISONMENT
The assault conviction and the battery conviction are sepa-
rate and distinct and will not be merged. Our attention now
must turn to the third entrant in this merger/nonmerger
sweepstakes—false imprisonment. The appellant was con-
victed of false imprisonment under the seventh count and
sentenced to a term of six years, to be served consecutively
with all other sentences. . . .
False imprisonment is, thus, an unlawful confinement or
detention brought about by the instrumentality, inter alia, of
either force or threat of force. Although there are other pos-
sible catalytic agents for the unlawful confinement, such as
fraud or a false claim of legal authority, false imprisonment
is most frequently the product of either an assault or a bat-
tery. Like the compound larceny we know as robbery, it may
be accomplished by either of those instrumentalities.
On the issue of required merger, the analogy of false im-
prisonment to robbery is most helpful. Robbery, of course,
is larceny accomplished by (1) force or (2) threat of force.
False imprisonment is confinement accomplished by, inter
alia, (1) force or (2) threat of force. The appellant is, there-
fore, quite correct that the false imprisonment for which he
was convicted under the seventh count is a greater inclusive
offense embracing within it either (1) the battery for which
he was convicted under the sixth count or (2) the assault for
which he was convicted under the fifth count. One of those
two was, under the facts of this case, the necessary instru-
mentality for the false imprisonment. . . .
As we have already exhaustively discussed, using vari-
ous clues and guidelines, it is clear that the assault and the
battery are separate and distinct from each other and do not
merge. Therefore, one of the two will merge into the convic-
tion for false imprisonment but the other will not. It is a ques-
tion of choosing the more likely candidate.
In terms of which of the two will merge, it is a matter of
indifference both to double jeopardy law and to sub-
constitutional merger law. Both of those legal doctrines are
concerned with avoiding multiple punishment. Either pos-
sible merger adequately accomplishes that end. Merger is
essentially a sentencing problem, not a verdict problem.
Every aspect of this trial—the evidence, the jury argu-
ments, the judge’s instructions, the presentence arguments,
the judge’s explanation of the sentences, the sentences
themselves—combine to make it indisputably clear that the
major crime for which the appellant was convicted was his
deliberate placing of Sharon Herz in fear of losing her life.
The jury instructions focused upon and highlighted the as-
sault charge. . . .
The assault received the ten-year sentence, beside
which the breaking and entering, the actual battery and the
false imprisonment all paled into relative insignificance, as
was apparent throughout the trial.The assault under the fifth
count was obviously no mere instrumentality in bringing
about an unlawful confinement. It was rather the case that
the false imprisonment was a mere incident of it.
The battery, on the other hand, was nothing more than
an instrumentality of the confinement. As we have dis-
cussed, the battery consisted of three discrete instances.
Not one of them involved any effort to harm or to punish the
victim as such. It was the necessary force employed to keep
her from leaving the apartment. . . .

CHAPTER 4
We hold that the conviction for battery should, as a lesser
included offense, be merged into the conviction for false im-
prisonment and that the separate six-year sentence for bat-
tery should, therefore, be vacated.

Reckless Endangerment, HIV Exposure
Reckless endangerment requires no actual physical or emotional harm. There is no
specific intent to harm, but rather general intent to commit the act that does, indeed,
cause substantial risk of death or serious injury. A defendant who discussed Russian
roulette with his brother, handed him a loaded shotgun, and dared him to pull the
trigger was guilty of reckless endangerment, even though he did not believe his
brother would pull the trigger [Minor v. State (Md. App. 1991)]. Beach v. State (Ind.
App. 1987) affirmed the conviction for attempted battery and criminal recklessness of
the defendant who twice drove his car at thirty to forty miles per hour on the side-
walk in a residential area, nearly striking people both times.
Reckless and wanton endangerment can include the transmission of disease. A
man who did not believe the report that he was HIV-positive and continued having
unprotected sex pleaded guilty to reckless endangerment in New York.7 Twenty-four
states have statutes specifically for criminal exposure to HIVs. In most of those
statutes, reckless behavior that exposes another person to HIV is sufficient for prose-
cution. California and a few other states require specific intent to infect the victim.
Most HIV statutes include three elements.
1.
The perpetrator must reasonably know that he or she has AIDS,
2.
commit a specific act such as donating blood or having sexual intercourse,
3.
not let the victim know about the virus.
Other states rely on assault and battery laws to cover HIV exposure. The decision in
State v. Gonzalez (Ohio App. 2003) affirmed a conviction for felonious assault by fail-
ure to disclose a known HIV-positive status to a sexual partner. Whether the victim
acquired HIV or suffered stress was not relevant to the case.8
6.
Terroristic Threatening, Menacing
Terroristic threatening is recklessly or intentionally placing a person in fear for their
own or another’s safety, or causing the evacuation or disruption of a public space or
facility. Menacing generally covers immediate threat of harm to individuals rather
than groups or public areas. Threatening words alone can suffice, such as the defen-
dant’s saying “Do you want to live?” in an effort to keep his victim quiet during a
rape [Allen v. State (Del. 1982)]. A man who had discharged a gun and was feared to
be suicidal said that if he chose to shoot himself, he would first shoot the judge, a
“brain-dead son of a bitch,” who had found him in contempt of court for failure to
pay child support. His conviction for threatening a judge was based on both state-
ments and conduct, and was affirmed in State v. Perkins (Wis. App. 2000).
A threat can also be inferred from a physical act or innuendo of language. During
a brawl among two officers and a burglary suspect, plus the suspect’s aunt, a revolver
belonging to one of the officers was pulled from its holster and turned on him by the
defendant. As he tried to retreat, the defendant shot him several times. The second of-
ficer, still on the ground struggling with the defendant’s aunt, turned at the sound of
the shots and saw the defendant 3 to 4 feet away aiming the loaded gun at his chest. The
defendant repeated, “Let her go.” When the officer attempted to get up, the defendant
quickly approached, then gradually backed off and ran. Besides the assault on the first

Crimes Against Persons and Crimes Against Habitation
■103
officer, the defendant was guilty of terroristic threatening of the second officer, based
on his physical acts and the implication of his words [State v. Tillman (Neb. App. 1993)].
Generally, a terroristic threatening charge does not require the defendant to mean
what he or she says, nor to have the immediate ability to carry out the threat, and it
is not necessary to show that the victim was actually afraid. Some statutes allow con-
ditional threats, “you do this or I will harm you,” and others include only uncondi-
tional threats. Threats against the president of the United States are a federal crime
under 18 U.S.C.A. § 871(a), against other federal officers and their families under 18
U.S.C.A. § 115a(1)(B), and any threat to kidnap or injure that is transmitted in inter-
state or foreign commerce falls under 18 U.S.C.A. § 875(c).
Harassment statutes cover insults, taunts, or challenges made with specific intent
and in a manner likely to provoke a violent response in a reasonable person. It has
been called “disorderly conduct aimed at a single person rather than the public” [In
Interest of Doe (Haw. 1994)].
7.
Stalking
One who makes a credible threat to the safety of another person or a member of that
person’s family and willfully, maliciously, and repeatedly follows, places under sur-
veillance, or harasses that person has committed the crime of stalking. Aggravated
stalking occurs when the offender causes bodily harm; confines or restrains the vic-
tim; or violates a restraining order, protective order, or injunction. It is a federal crime
to travel across a state line or within maritime and territorial jurisdiction with the in-
tent to stalk, 18 U.S.C.A. § 2261A, or with intent to violate or in violation of a protec-
tive order, 18 U.S.C.A. § 2262.
A defendant who had threatened his brother by saying, “Maybe I’ll just blow you
and your whole family away,” then parked across the street from his brother’s home
for five minutes and later closely followed his brother home from work at midnight
was guilty of stalking [People v. Bailey (Ill. 1995)]. An attempted stalking conviction
was affirmed in State v. Rooks (Ga. 1996). The defendant, under court order not to have
contact with the victim or her family, called the victim’s office and spoke with her co-
worker, threatening both the victim and the co-worker. The defense argued that be-
cause there is no crime for attempted assault, there also could be no attempted
stalking. The court, however, differentiated the immediate threat of assault from the
less immediate threat of stalking, and pointed out that stalking includes actions such
as following and contact that can be attempted. A concurring opinion added that
“contact” within the meaning of the statute had been accomplished and stalking, not
attempted stalking, was the appropriate charge.
“Computer harassment” and “cyberstalking” through computer communica-
tions are involved in 20 to 40 percent of all stalking cases. Forty-five states specifically
refer to electronic communication in their stalking and harassment statutes.9 A 1998
federal law (18 U.S.C.A. § 2425) criminalizes the use of any form of interstate com-
merce, including telephone and Internet transmissions, to solicit or entice a child into
unlawful sexual activity.
8.
Hate Crimes
Federal law defines hate crime as “a crime in which the defendant intentionally selects
a victim, or in the case of property crime, the property that is the object of the crime,
because of the actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, gen-
der, disability, or sexual orientation of any person” [28 U.S.C.A. § 994]. The Supreme
Court wrote in Wisconsin v. Mitchell (1993) that enhanced sentences for hate crimes are
justified, because “bias-motivated crimes are more likely to provoke retaliatory
crimes, inflict distinct emotional harms on their victims, and incite community un-
rest.” In 2002 12,073 law enforcement agencies participated in collecting data on hate
crimes, reporting 7,462 incidents to the FBI. Of those incidents, 67.5 percent were

104
■
CHAPTER 4
crimes against persons, 32 percent crimes against property, and .6 percent crimes
against society.10 The Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 1999, 18 U.S.C.A. § 245(c), pro-
vides federal penalties for hate crimes. Damaging religious property because of its re-
ligious use or the race, color, or ethnic characteristics of anyone associated with it is
criminalized in 18 U.S.C.A. § 247.
State statutes that criminalize conduct that “produces or is capable of producing
an effect tending to excite” [State v. Ramsey (S.C. 1993)] or “arouses anger, alarm, or
resentment in others on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, or gender” [R.A.V. v.
City of St. Paul (1992)] have been declared unconstitutional as being too broad and en-
croaching on First Amendment freedoms. Wisconsin’s hate crime enhancement law
was unanimously approved by the Supreme Court in Wisconsin v. Mitchell (1993),
however, with all other states filing a joint brief in support of the two-step law.
a.
The law focuses not on free speech protected by the First Amendment, but
on otherwise illegal conduct, such as the aggravated battery in Mitchell,
when a group of young black men and boys beat a white boy until he was
unconscious and was left in a coma for four days.
b.
After the jury convicts the defendant of the basic crime, they then must
decide whether there is evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the crime
was motivated by bias in order for the sentence enhancement to be
applied. The Court in Mitchell upheld a bias finding, because just before
the beating the defendant said to the group he was with, “Do you all feel
hyped up to move on some white people? . . . There goes a white boy; go
get him.”
In Virginia v. Black (2003), the Supreme Court noted that laws against cross-
burning that require intent to intimidate are constitutional. The Virginia law’s provi-
sion allowing the simple act of burning to be prima facie evidence (sufficient in itself)
of that intent, however, was struck down. Some other evidence of intent is required.
In Apprendi v. New Jersey (2000), the Supreme court ruled unconstitutional the
laws allowing a judge to enhance a sentence based on a preponderance of the evi-
dence that the defendant was motivated by bias to commit the crime for which he or
she was convicted. Instead, bias must be considered an element of the crime to be in-
cluded in the charge and decided beyond a reasonable doubt by the jury.
“Investigating Hate Crimes on the Internet,” a technical assistance brief produced
by Partners Against Hate, addresses the difficulties of investigating online hate
crimes.11 A comparison of state hate crime statutes is shown at ww.adl.org.
D.
CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS
Chapter 13 of the federal criminal code criminalizes a range of conduct that hinders
the free exercise of rights and privileges of people living under the Constitution of the
United States. Federal statute 18 U.S.C.A. § 241 criminalizes conspiracy by two or
more persons to threaten or intimidate anyone in the exercise of constitutional rights
or privileges. Section 242 criminalizes deprivation under color of law of those rights,
privileges, or immunities, or subjection to different punishments because of race,
color, or alien status. “Under color of law” refers to the conduct of government offi-
cials in carrying out their duties under the authority of the government.
Section 242 provided grounds for the famous federal trial and conviction of po-
lice officers for beating Rodney King while placing him under arrest for a traffic vio-
lation, depriving him of his right to be free from harm while in custody [U.S. v. Koon
(9th Cir. 1994)]. The same law was used to convict a state judge for sexually assault-
ing female employees and litigants [U.S. v. Lanier (1997)]. U.S. v. Epley (6th Cir. 1995)
affirmed the conviction under §§ 241 and 242 of police officers who had planted co-
caine and an illegal gun in the vehicle of a man they wanted to silence, then arrested
him and gave false testimony against him.

Chapter 13 of the federal code also covers exclusion of jurors on the basis of race
or color, § 243; discrimination against a person wearing the uniform of the armed
forces, § 244; protection of a wide range of activities from election rights to public
school enrollment to interstate businesses during a riot, § 245; deprivation of relief ben-
efits, § 246; damage to religious property or obstruction of the free exercise of religious
beliefs, § 247; and obstruction of access to reproductive health services, § 248. Penalties
are primarily fines, but also include up to life imprisonment and sentence of death for
serious violations and inclusion of kidnapping, sexual abuse, or killing in the crime.

SEXUAL BATTERY
1.
Reform
a. Introduction
Rape, a type of aggravated battery, is so universally abhorrent that it
has held its place as a separate and more serious crime. Unlawful sexual intercourse
againstthevictim’swillbyforceorthreatofimmediateforcecouldbepunishedbydeath
until Coker v. Georgia (1977) declared the death penalty for rape unconstitutional. The in-
timate nature that makes this offense so serious makes it difficult to discuss and evalu-
ate. Rigid perceptions of gender roles also have hindered a willingness to be more open
in discussing sex crimes. Recently, however, reforms in social attitudes have reached the
law, expanding protection against a greater variety of offenses and placing greater em-
phasis on harm to the victim. New statutes increasingly reflect the following changes.
b. Victim Testimony
Sexual offense trials often pit the word of the victim against
the word of the defendant. Traditionally, the victim’s credibility had to be bolstered
by evidence of her previous chastity and corroboration of witnesses. Her believabil-
ity dwindled further with any delay in reporting the crime.
Now rape shield laws prevent evidence of the victim’s prior sexual activity from
being introduced in court, unless it is relevant to consent. Children can testify in some
courts via videotape or with the aid of anatomically correct dolls to make the experi-
ence less traumatic. Statutes of limitations restricting the time period in which prose-
cution must be started have been eliminated for sexual offenses against children in
eleven states, and eliminated without regard to age for the most serious sexual of-
fenses in an additional six states. Many other states have extended time limits.12 Cor-
roboration may be circumstantial.
These changes are not without problems. A defendant’s Sixth Amendment right
to confront the accuser may be diminished by videotaped testimony. Expert opinion
that “rape trauma syndrome” may cause the victim to repress the experience, making
difficult the identification of the offender and reporting of the crime, is not admissi-
ble in some courts as a still questionable and prejudicial theory. Such changes may in-
terfere with the defendant’s right to a speedy trial, as well as with the timely gathering
of evidence.
c. Definitions
The old requirement of utmost resistance from the victim has given way
to “reasonable resistance,” taking into account the risk of death or serious injury against
overwhelming force or threat as well as psychological factors [State v. Studham (Utah
1997)]. The expectation that all sexual offense victims are female and all offenders male
is beginning to change because of the reality of homosexual rape and the involvement
of women as accomplices in rape and aggressors in sexual contact cases. New gender
neutral statutes attempt to cover all participants, and definitions have been expanded to
include oral, anal, and vaginal penetration, as well as other forms of sexual contact.

Mens Rea: Consent and Force
a. Statutory Rape
State of mind is at issue in sexual assault cases primarily in
determining whether the victim consented to the act and whether the defendant
“Rape is a culturally fos-
tered means of suppressing
women. Legally we say we
deplore it, but mythically we
romanticize and perpetuate
it, and privately we excuse
and overlook it. . . .”

reasonably believed the victim consented. When the victim is under the “age of con-
sent,” which varies from state to state, or is mentally or physically incapacitated, a
lack of consent to sexual conduct with older partners is presumed. Statutory rape, un-
forced sexual intercourse with an underage child, is a strict liability offense in some
states. Other states allow a reasonable mistake about the victim’s age as a defense. In
State v. Ealey, (Tenn. Crim. App. 1997), the defendant, charged with rape of a child un-
der thirteen years of age, said he believed the victim’s statement that she was sixteen
years old when she was actually eleven. Because of his belief, a jury instruction on
statutory rape of a child between thirteen and eighteen was allowed, and he was con-
victed on that charge.
Here again, social realities are seeping into the courtroom. In State v. Bartlett (Ariz.
1992), the court recognized that today’s teenagers are frequently sexually active, and
overturned as excessive the forty-year sentence of a twenty-three-year-old man for
the statutory rape of consenting girls just under that state’s age limit of fifteen years.
Some states specify an age gap between offender and victim for statutory rape. In
Florida, impregnation of a minor is a separate offense.
b. Consent and Force
When victims are adults, however, rape cases frequently turn
on the issue of consent; the state of mind of the victim seems to have been of greater
interest to courts in the past than the state of mind of the defendant. The Model Penal
Code § 213 and some modern state laws are now shifting the focus, not even men-
tioning consent but emphasizing the level of threat or force exerted by the defendant.
Consent remains as an implied defense.
Helplessness of the victim as a result of intoxication, use of “date rape” drugs
such as Rohypnol (roofies) and Gamma-hydrobutiric acid (GHB), or other causes is
more frequently being allowed as an alternative to the element of physical force by
the offender.
The overwhelming majority of rapes are committed by acquaintances of the vic-
tims, but juries are more reluctant to convict these offenders than to convict strangers.
Therefore, the Model Penal Code and some states reduce the classification from first to
second degree felony if the victim was a “voluntary social companion” of the accused.
3.
Actus Reus in Sexual Battery
Rather than classifying sexual offenses according to mens rea as in homicide, harm
and threat of harm are the criteria for grading the seriousness of sexual crimes. The
victim’s age and the relationship of the offender to the victim contribute to the eval-
uation of harm. Simple criminal penetration or rape is more serious than simple crim-
inal sexual contact, which is sexual touching that the actor knows is offensive to the
victim. Both are usually aggravated to more serious penalties if the victim sustains se-
rious bodily injury, is a minor with an older assailant, is incompetent or helpless, is
attacked by a stranger or one who has accomplices, is threatened with deadly
weapons, or is assaulted in connection with another crime. Also, an aggravated
charge is likely if the offender is a parent or otherwise in a position of trust or au-
thority. Incest, sexual conduct between specified family members regardless of age, is
an aggravating factor in some statutes and a separate crime in others.

Crimes Against Persons and Crimes Against Habitation
■107
The following cases illustrate some of the problems in sexual crimes. State v. Ohrt-
man (Minn. App. 1991) held that a hug by a pastor during a counseling session was not
“sexual conduct.” Evidence of physical force was not necessary to establish construc-
tive “force” in the rape case of a defendant who falsely identified himself as a police of-
ficer to a female motorist and threatened to lock her up before having sexual intercourse
with her [Commonwealth v. Caracciola (Mass. 1991)]. Transmitting HIV to a minor during
anal intercourse [Zule v. State (Tex. App. 1990)] and intercourse by an HIV-positive man
using a condom regardless of the consent of his female partner [U.S. v. Joseph (NMCMR
1991)] were both sufficient for aggravated sexual assault convictions.
4.
Megan’s Law and Sexually Violent Predator Acts
The 1994 rape and murder of seven-year-old Megan Kanka led to a new law in her
home state of New Jersey. Outrage that the killer’s previous record of sex offenses
against children was unknown in the community shaped the “Megan’s Law” require-
ment that convicted sex offenders who are released from prison must register their ad-
dresses and other identifying information with local law enforcement agencies. The
agencies then release that information to the public in the hope that greater vigilance
from informed neighbors will keep the offender from attacking again. Failure to reg-
ister each new address within ten days of moving is a crime. After ten years without
further offenses, the registrant may request release from the registration requirement.
In 1996 a federal version of Megan’s Law was passed mandating a sex offender
registry in all states, 42 U.S.C.A. § 14071, along with a companion law that provides
for a federal reporting system accessible to the states, 42 U.S.C.A. § 14072. Some state
laws provide for prerelease psychological testing and a hearing to separate those who
have been evaluated as high-risk offenders from those who pose a lower risk. Local
law enforcement agencies, victims, and victims’ advocacy groups are notified of the
release of low-risk offenders. A high-risk offender’s name, photograph, address, and
criminal history are also released to news media.13
The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld sex offender registration. Connecticut Dep’t. of
Public Safety v. Doe (2003) held that convicted offenders may be forced to register without
a separate hearing to determine continuing dangerousness. The decision in Smith v. Doe
(2003) characterized the registration as “[d]issemination of truthful information in fur-
theranceofalegitimategovernmentalobjective,”whichisnotpunitiveand,therefore,can
be applied to cases that predate the registration law. Because Hawaii’s Megan’s Law did
notprovideoffenderswithnoticeortheopportunitytochallengetheirplacementonasex

led to the amendment of the law and vacated the registration requirement of the defen-
dant convicted of misdemeanor sexual assault for grabbing a 17-year-old girl’s buttocks
while he was intoxicated. Some states post their sex offender registries on the Internet.
Megan’s laws have survived constitutional challenges in several states because
they are intended for community awareness, not punishment. Critics argue that neg-
ative public reaction to the registrants is indeed punitive, is based on status rather
than conduct, and that the hearings violate the constitutional protection against be-
ing tried twice for the same crime (double jeopardy). Others believe the laws are in-
effective and exaggerate public anxiety.14
Nineteen states have passed laws requiring sex offenders who have served their
prison sentences to undergo civil trial to determine their further threat to society. If
they are found to be violent sexual predators, offenders may be held at psychiatric
hospitals involuntarily and indefinitely. The decision in Seling v. Young (2001) estab-
lished that confinement of sexual predators after a criminal sentence is served, even
under conditions that are incompatible with treatment, is a civil matter in the interest
of protecting the public from both treatable and untreatable offenders. Only clear and
convincing evidence that the defendant is a sexual predator, rather than the higher
standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, is necessary for determining the status
of a sexually violent offender [Commonwealth v. Maldonado (Pa. 2003)]. In Kansas v.

Do you think the federal approach to Megan’s Law is a good idea? Do
you think psychiatrists and courts can predict criminal behavior? In your
opinion, do the benefits of Megan’s Law and sexually violent predator laws
outweigh the problems? What if their provisions were extended to cover all
violent criminals?
Crane (2002) the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that sexual offenders must be shown to
have a mental illness that causes a serious lack of self-control before they can be in-
voluntarily committed after serving their prison sentences.
Sexual predator commitments deny due process to those identified as sexual
predators, according to critics. “Although community protection may be part of the
justification, without a good faith effort at therapeutic rehabilitation, the entire
scheme of civil commitment of sex offenders who have completed their criminal sen-
tences becomes preventive detention.”15

Sexual Battery and Rape Statutes
Compare the following set of sexual offenses statutes from Tennessee, or statutes from
another state, with your state’s statutes. Note gender neutral language; differences in
elements and how elements are organized among the crimes; the use of nonconsent;
the use of incapacitation, force, and age; and limitations on marital exception (spousal
exclusion). Following the statutes are two cases showing the courts’ interpretations of
the statutes.
Other sexual offenses are covered under prostitution, obscenity, pornography,
and exploitation statutes. These are discussed in Chapter 5.

(2) If the conduct that is a violation of a condition of community supervision also
constitutes a criminal offense that is classified as a misdemeanor, such violation
is a Class A misdemeanor.
(3) If the conduct that is a violation of a condition of community supervision also
constitutes a criminal offense that is classified as a felony, such violation is a
Class E felony.
(4) Each violation of a condition of community supervision constitutes a separate
offense.

STATE v.TUTTON
Court of Criminal Appeals of Tennessee, at Jackson, 1993
875 S.W.2d 295 Tenn. Cr. App.
[Citations omitted]
. . .
OPINION
WADE, JUDGE
The defendant, Reginald D. Tutton, was convicted of aggra-
vated rape and attempted first degree murder. A charge of
kidnapping ended in a mistrial.The trial court sentenced the
defendant as a Class A, multiple offender to consecutive
prison sentences of 25 and 35 years, respectively.
The single issue presented for review relates to the ag-
gravated rape conviction. The defendant contends the trial
court erred by failing to instruct the jury on the lesser in-
cluded offense of rape.
We find the aggravated rape conviction should be modi-
fied to simple rape. We remand to the trial court for a new
sentencing hearing.
The defendant is the boyfriend of the victim’s aunt. At ap-
proximately 11:30 P.M. on June 7, 1991, the victim, Valerie
Walton, left a friend’s home to walk home. The defendant,
driving a brown, four-door car, resembling one owned by the
victim’s aunt, stopped to talk. After confirming the victim’s
identity and learning that she intended to go home, the de-
fendant said, “[N]o, you’re not, you’re going to the park.” The
victim then attempted to flee, but was overcome by the de-
fendant and led back to the car.
The defendant then told her that he was going to the
store to buy beer but indicated that he would take the victim
home. After purchasing the beer, defendant returned to his
vehicle and instead of driving the victim home, he drove the
victim to “the park,” an isolated spot on the northern end of
Mud Island in Memphis.
When the defendant stopped, the victim attempted to flee
but was again subdued by the defendant.After returning her to
the car, the defendant removed her clothes and raped the vic-
tim in the front seat of the car.Immediately afterward, the victim
put her clothes back on and agreed to a walk with the defen-
dant. He warned her to tell no one about the occurrence.
As the two returned to the car, the defendant suddenly
struck the victim from behind several times with an object,
causing her to fall to the ground. He then stabbed her re-
peatedly with some type of file.The defendant fled the scene
and the victim found her way to the nearby Kimberly Clark
guard station from where authorities were contacted.
Dorothy Clark, the guard on duty, testified that the victim
was dazed and covered in blood.Initially, paramedics treated

the victim. She was hospitalized three days for, among other
things, stab wounds to her back, neck, and breast.
While the defendant did not testify, he presented three al-
ibi witnesses. All testified that he was in a different part of
Memphis at the time of the offenses.
Defense counsel requested that the trial court instruct
the jury on rape, sexual battery, and assault, all lesser in-
cluded offenses of aggravated rape.The trial court, however,
charged the jury solely upon the offense of aggravated rape.
Pursuant to Tenn.Code Ann. § 39-13-502(a)(2), the state
must prove that a rape is accompanied by bodily injury to
the victim before the crime may be elevated to that of ag-
gravated rape. In this appeal, the defendant claims an enti-
tlement to a new trial because the trial court had a duty to
instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of rape when
the evidence did not show a temporal relationship between
the rape and the subsequent stabbing. The state concedes
that the record contains no proof that the rape itself was ac-
companied by bodily injury; it agrees that the defendant
stabbed the victim only after the rape had been fully ac-
complished. The state, however, argues that the remedy is
not a new trial; it contends that the defendant’s conviction
should be modified to simple rape. We agree.
We initially observe that the trial judge has the duty to
give a complete charge of the law applicable to the facts of
the case. It is settled law that when “there are any facts that
are susceptible of inferring guilt on any lesser included of-
fense or offenses, then there is a mandatory duty upon the
trial judge to charge on such offense or offenses. Failure to
do so denies a defendant his constitutional right of trial by a
jury.” When there is a trial on a single charge of felony, there
is also a trial on all lesser included offenses, “as the facts
may be.”
The record demonstrates that intervals of both time and
distance separated the two offenses. The crime of rape, ac-
cording to the account of the victim, had been fully accom-
plished well before the assault.That statute requires that the
rape be “accompanied by” bodily injury to the victim. There
was no proof of that here. The trial court’s failure to charge
the jury on the lesser included offense of rape was, there-
fore, error. . . .
This court recognizes that a new trial is generally the ap-
propriate remedy where there is a failure to charge the jury
on lesser included offenses. Under these circumstances,
however, and where the evidence at trial was adequate to
support the lesser included offense of rape, we elect to re-
duce the degree of the offense to simple rape and remand
to the trial court for resentencing.

OPINION
PEAY, JUDGE
The defendant was convicted by a jury of two counts of ag-
gravated sexual battery and one count of aggravated rape.
For these convictions he received twelve years on each of
the aggravated sexual battery convictions and twenty-five
years on the aggravated rape conviction. The trial judge or-
dered all sentences to run consecutively, thereby resulting
in an effective sentence of forty-nine years.
In this appeal as of right, the defendant presents five is-
sues for review. . . .
4.
Whether the trial court erred in admitting evidence of
uncharged conduct and in failing to request an elec-
tion of offenses. . . .
We find issues one, two, three, and five to be without merit.
Therefore, we affirm the trial court on these issues.Regarding
issue four, we reverse in part and affirm in part. On the sexual
battery charges, we affirm the trial court. On the aggravated
rape charge, we reverse and remand this case for a new trial.
The proof offered on behalf of the State established that
on an evening in February of 1992, Wan Rayfield II (here-
inafter, Junior) invited the defendant to Junior’s home. The
defendant and his wife stayed at Junior’s home for three or
four days. This period represents the only time that the de-
fendant had ever been in the Rayfield home. On one of
those evenings during the visit, Junior, Junior’s wife, victim
B, B’s friend victim N, N’s parents, B’s sister, B’s cousin, the
defendant, and Teresa, the defendant’s wife, were present
at the Rayfield home. Late that evening, the defendant en-
tered B’s bedroom after B, age ten, had fallen asleep. After
climbing into B’s bed, the defendant fondled B’s genitals.
When B requested that the defendant stop these acts, the
defendant ceased momentarily and then resumed the acts.
On a subsequent evening, while B and his friend N, also
age ten, were playing Nintendo in his bedroom, the defen-
dant entered and instructed B to accompany him to the

Crimes Against Persons and Crimes Against Habitation
■115
bathroom. There the defendant offered B five dollars to buy
his silence and keep him from reporting the prior sexual act
to his mother and father. Upon returning from the bathroom,
the defendant requested that N accompany him to the bath-
room. In the bathroom, the defendant fondled N’s genitals
and performed oral sex on him. Then, forcibly pinning N
against the sink, the defendant inserted his penis into N’s
anus.According to N, the defendant then started “hunching.”
After the defendant performed these sexual acts, N testified
that the defendant had thrown a knife at him, cutting him on
the leg; had kicked him out the door; and had thrown him
twice. N also stated that he had thrown the knife back at the
defendant and had struck him in the leg. According to B, N
had returned from the bathroom after approximately ten
minutes and had appeared mad and confused. N spoke to
B about the events which had occurred in the bathroom, and
B then alerted family members. In response, a mock trial
was conducted with the defendant’s wife presiding as
“judge.”. . .
For the jury to find the defendant guilty of aggravated
sexual battery, the State must have proven beyond a rea-
sonable doubt that there was unlawful sexual conduct with
a victim by the defendant accompanied by any of the fol-
lowing circumstances:
(1) Force or coercion [was] used to accomplish the act
and the defendant is armed with a weapon.
(2) The defendant [caused] bodily injury to the victim.
(3) The defendant [was] aided or abetted by one or
more persons; and force [was] used to accomplish
the act or the defendant [knew] or [had] reason to
know the defendant [was] mentally defective, inca-
pacitated or helpless.
(4) The victim [was] less than thirteen years of age.
For the jury to have found the defendant guilty of aggra-
vated rape, the State must have proven one of the afore-
mentioned circumstances enumerated in the preceding
paragraph plus the element of unlawful sexual penetration
of the victim by the defendant.
At trial, B testified that the defendant had come to his
bedroom and played with his penis. N testified that the de-
fendant had played with his penis, had “sucked” his penis,
and had put his penis in N’s “bottom.”
The record reveals that the defendant articulated and
signed a statement admitting to the commission of sexual
offenses with both of these victims. Detective Harmon testi-
fied that the defendant had voluntarily waived his rights and
confessed to these acts. The defendant reported details of
the acts which had not been disclosed to him by the inves-
tigating officer and which were consistent with the victims’
testimonies. The victims reported the acts of the defendant
to family members, a medical doctor, an employee at the
Department of Human Services, and a jury.Throughout this
process, their account remained largely consistent and un-
contradicted by any proof. Any minor discrepancies or
lapses in memory may be attributed to the fact that these
victims were nine [sic] years old at the time of the offense.
Additionally, one of the victims suffers from a slight mental
deficiency and experiences difficulty in recalling numbers or
dates. The testimonies of the doctor and social worker
largely corroborate the victims’ testimonies.The jury has ac-
credited the testimonies of the victims, Detective Harmon,
Dr. St. Marie, and the social worker. A rational jury could
conclude that any discrepancy in the victims’ testimonies
was minor and reasonable. In summary, a rational trier of
fact could have convicted the defendant of two counts of ag-
gravated sexual battery and one count of aggravated rape.
In his fourth issue the defendant contends that the trial
court erred in admitting evidence of uncharged conduct and
in failing to request an election of offenses. On this issue we
affirm the trial court in part and reverse the trial court in part....
In the case at bar, the trial court did not err in allowing
admission of the evidence of uncharged conduct had the
State elected as to the particular incident for which a con-
viction was being sought. The defendant was charged with
cognate crimes. The victims were merely testifying about
the circumstance surrounding the crimes which had been
charged.Therefore, in strict accordance with the law in Ten-
nessee, the trial judge properly allowed this evidence of un-
charged, sexual conduct. This issue lacks merit.
As to the issue of election of offenses . . . [t]he law regard-
ing election of offenses is expressed in Burlison v. State, 501
S.W.2d 801 (Tenn.1973). The Burlison rule applies to crimes
of a sexual nature where there have been several separate in-
cidents of sexual assault. Burlison states the following:
We hold that it was the duty of the trial judge to require
the State, at the close of its proof-in-chief, to elect the
particular offense of carnal knowledge upon which it
would rely for conviction, and to properly instruct the
jury so that the verdict of every juror would be united on
the one offense.
Burlison offers the following three fundamental reasons for
the election requirement:
First, to enable the defendant to prepare for and make
his defense to the specific charge; second, to protect
him from double jeopardy by individualization of the
issue, and third, so that the jury’s verdict may not be a
matter of choice between offenses, some jurors
convicting on one offense and others, another.
In the case at bar, the third justification addresses the
gravest concern in that every defendant has “the well-
established right under our state constitution to a unani-
mous jury verdict before a criminal conviction is imposed.”
The defendant has a constitutional right to a unanimous ver-
dict on each offense. The defendant’s “right to a unanimous
jury before conviction requires the trial court to take pre-
cautions to ensure the jury deliberates over the particular
charged offense, instead of creating a ‘patchwork verdict’
based on different offenses in evidence.” Election ensures
that each juror considers the same occurrence.

116
■
CHAPTER 4
In the case at bar, the trial court did not err in failing to re-
quest the State to elect the offense for the first count of sex-
ual battery on B. The defense counsel emphasizes the fact
that B and the State referred to more than one episode of
sexual contact, despite the fact that the defendant was only
charged with one count of sexual battery against B. During
testimony, B and the State, in an attempt to clarify, used
phrases such as “the second time” or “the last time.” In con-
text, however, we do not find that the record indicates more
than one incidence of sexual misconduct.
B testified in detail about one precise sexual incident in
his bed.The State and defense counsel questioned B about
that one precise incident. No details were provided about
any other incident.The minor innuendos about another inci-
dent were harmless. In considering the entire record in this
cause, we are satisfied that the judge did not err in failing to
require that the State elect upon which offense it was seek-
ing a verdict in that only one specific incident was alleged to
have occurred.
We also find that the trial court did not err in failing to re-
quest the State to elect the offense for the second count of
sexual battery on N. N testified to one incident of fondling
which occurred in the bathroom. Questions presented by
the State concerned only the one incident in the bathroom.
No details were provided about any other incident.
We find, however, that the trial court did err in failing to
request an election of offenses in connection with the
charge of aggravated rape of N. The State provided proof
that the defendant performed oral and anal sex on the vic-
tim. These are two separate acts, each constituting pene-
tration under the charge of aggravated rape. Yet, the
defendant was only charged with one count of aggravated
rape. The court presented to the jury the proof and allega-
tions of two acts and asked the jury if the defendant could
be convicted of one count of this act.Therefore, some jurors
could have concluded that the defendant was guilty based
upon the proof of the oral sex and not the anal sex, and
some jurors could have concluded that the defendant was
guilty based upon the proof of the anal sex and not the oral
sex. The defendant may have been convicted by a jury of
less than twelve. Since all twelve members did not have to
find the same facts or draw the same conclusions, we find
that a grave constitutional error was committed in that the
defendant may have been denied a unanimous jury verdict.
We cannot say that this error was harmless beyond a
doubt. Prior to trial, the defendant moved to prevent the
State from introducing proof concerning the oral sex inci-
dent.The State argued and the trial judge agreed that either
the oral sex or the anal penetration constituted aggravated
sexual rape. Further the State, in its summation to the jury,
argued that the defendant had performed oral sex on the
victim and had anally penetrated the victim. The trial judge
expressly charged the jury to rely on the arguments of coun-
sel for each side’s theory of the case. The jury instructions
defined sexual penetration as including fellatio and anal in-
tercourse. Additionally, we note that nowhere in the record
can we determine with certainty if the indictment was read
to the members of the jury and/or was taken with them
when they deliberated. Other than the indictment, we find
nothing in the record to indicate that the jury was aware that
the State was relying on the act of anal intercourse to sup-
port the aggravated rape count.
This case is unfortunate. The acts committed were egre-
gious and disturbing.These acts grow more disturbing when
we consider the victims. Two innocent boys suffered the im-
mediate pain and tragedy of sexual abuse, and now they will
suffer throughout their lives as victims of crimes of nature.
We do not wish to cause these victims more harm. However,
all defendants deserve a fair trial with a unanimous verdict.
The trial court denied this defendant his right to a unani-
mous jury verdict, and we cannot, therefore, under the dic-
tates of Burlison, affirm this conviction. In our legal system,
we do not sacrifice the means by which we reach a conclu-
sion in order to reach palatable ends. Therefore, we order a
new trial on the aggravated rape charge.

CRIMINAL ABUSE
1.
Introduction
Abuse crimes in general cover mistreatment and neglect; physical, sexual, and emotional
damage; injury; exploitation; danger; and cruelty. These offenses are characterized by
commission by a person in a position of trust or authority against someone in that per-
son’s care or influence or within the domestic circle. Besides ordinary criminal sanctions,
abuse statutes also aim to prevent repeated abuse by enforcing protective orders and
providing a cause of action for civil suits against abusers. Abuse of children and spouses
or others in intimate partnerships is commonly covered, and abuse of the elderly in both
private homes and group care facilities is sometimes included in abuse statutes. Illinois
statutes, for example, include provisions against ritual mutilation and giving child ath-
letes drugs for weight control in connection with participation in athletics.

2.
Child Abuse
The number of substantiated victims of child abuse totaled 896,000 in 2002, a decrease
in the rate of abuse since 1990, but the number of cases investigated increased. More
than 60 percent of those children were victims of neglect, 18.6 percent of physical
abuse, 9.9 percent of sexual abuse, over 6 percent of emotional abuse, and 18.9 per-
cent of other types of abuse such as abandonment, threat of harm, and congenital
drug addiction. Many children were victims of more than one type of abuse. An esti-
mated 1,400 of those children died from their injuries. Parents were the abusers in
nearly 84 percent of the cases.16
Abusing or allowing someone else to abuse by causing injury, placing in risk of
injury, confining or punishing cruelly, or torturing a child of a specified age, and
sometimes a physically or mentally helpless person, in one’s care generally consti-
tutes child abuse. Offenses may be graded by degree of mens rea, from intentional as
most serious, to wanton, then reckless as least serious. Another grading system uses
degree of danger or injury and other evaluations of harm as aggravating factors.
A mother’s testimony that her thirteen-month-old daughter was “very bright”
and “able to perceive everything” was not sufficient evidence that the baby was
aware of her father’s lewd conduct in her presence, so his conviction for child abuse
was overturned in Werner v. State (Fla. App. 1991). The decision in Nicholson v. State
(Fla. 1992) declared that “willful torture” in Florida’s child abuse statute includes
willful acts of omission such as the starvation of a child.
Proof of criminal negligence is required in omissions cases, but not when abuse is
based on the direct infliction of injury, according to People v. Sargent (Cal. 1999). Gen-
eral intent was the element of mens rea when the act was shaking an infant until it fell
into a coma. The defendant did not have to have knowledge of the danger of shaking.
The court in Commonwealth v. Chandler (Ky. 1987) ruled that abuse was not a lesser
included offense of assault with a deadly weapon, and that injury from use of a
deadly weapon is assault, regardless of whether the victim is related. Tying up chil-
dren ages seven, six, and two years and forcing them to watch pornographic movies
satisfied the element of cruel confinement in Stokes v. Commonwealth (Ky. 1992).
Investigation in child abuse cases, particularly in interviews of victims, needs to
be conducted with great care. Some sexual abuse cases have turned into witch-hunts,
such as the McMartin Day Care case in Los Angeles, underscoring the difficulties in
dealing with highly emotional situations and suggestible children.
Teachers, physicians, social workers, and others who observe children in the
course of their work are required by state laws and 18 U.S.C.A. § 2258 to report sus-
pected child abuse to law enforcement agencies. Eighteen states require anyone who
suspects child abuse to report it.
Federal laws protecting children from sexual abuse and exploitation are located
in 18 U.S.C.A. §§ 2241 through 2260 and §§ 2423 and 2425. The PROTECT Act (federal
“Amber Alert” law) places limits on the sentencing discretion of federal judges in sex
crimes. Most downward departures from the sentencing guidelines for these offenses
have been prohibited, while punishments have been increased.
The PROTECT Act also criminalizes knowing use of a misleading Internet domain
nametotrickapersonintoviewinganobsceneWebsite,possessionofvirtual(computer-
generated) child pornography, and traveling abroad to engage in illicit sexual conduct
with minors. The statute requires convicted child pornographers to place their names on
the national sex offender registry (42 U.S.C.A. § 14072), allows broader use of wiretaps
and electronic surveillance in the investigation of kidnapping and some sex offenses (18
U.S.C.A. § 2516), and adds attempt to the possible charges in international parental kid-
napping (18 U.S.C.A. § 1204). The law eliminates the statute of limitations and pretrial re-
lease in cases of sexual abuse and kidnapping of a child and amends Federal Rule of
Criminal Procedure 7 to allow indictment for a federal sex crime on the identification of
DNA alone.17 A section on child pornography and exploitation is in Chapter 5.

CHAPTER 4
3.
Intimate Partner Violence
In intimate partner violence (domestic violence and spouse abuse), the offender and
victim have an intimate relationship and share or have shared a residence, or have a
child in common. The trauma and fear of the victim are exacerbated by continuing ac-
cess and control by the offender. Such physical and psychological control, along with
aspects of love, denial, and social and religious conventions, prevents many victims
from reporting spouse abuse or from pressing charges. Although reported cases de-
clined from 1993 to 2001, intimate partner violence still amounted to 20 percent of all
nonfatal violent crimes against women in 2001. In 2000, 1,247 women and 440 men
were killed by an intimate partner.18
Intimate partner violence statutes encompass the standard assault, battery, and
sexual offenses between domestic partners. They also provide criminal sanctions
for violations of protective orders. Reforms bolstering those measures include
emergency protective orders issued by judges to allow quick intervention by po-
lice and added penalties for violations. A Missouri court and several counties in
Georgia allow battered women to e-mail requests for protective orders from their
shelter house directly to the judge to speed approval time and avoid confronting
their abusers.19 Some prosecutors have adopted a “no drop” policy in spouse abuse
cases, ensuring that charges will not be dropped even if the victim fails to cooper-
ate with the prosecution. In jurisdictions without that policy, prosecution teams
must work with law enforcement to build a strong case from the beginning so these
victims do not become re-victimized in a revolving-door situation. See pointers in
Chapter 8. Wisconsin includes dating relationships among those covered by re-
straining orders and considers any communication between domestic abuse vic-
tims and victim advocates and victims’ family members to be privileged.20 An
Illinois law, the first of its kind in the nation, allows a death sentence when a mur-
der victim had obtained a protective order against the murderer.21 Factors that
more commonly raise murder to a capital offense include an elderly person or child
as a victim. Opponents of the law argue that lack of a protective order does not
make a murder less aggravated.22
A criminal conviction for a protective order violation was affirmed in Lee v. State
(Tex. Cr. App. 1990). Alesbian partner’s conviction of domestic violence was affirmed
in State v. Linner (Ohio Mun. 1996). The defendant and victim were living and raising
their children from previous relationships together, so their relationship qualified as
“otherwise cohabiting” under the statute.
The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) of 1994 makes it a federal crime to cross
a state or Indian country line to commit a crime of violence against a spouse or intimate
partner, 18 U.S.C.A. § 2262 (a)(1); or to force a partner to cross such a line and in the
course or as a result of doing so commit a crime of violence, 18 U.S.C.A. § 2262 (a)(2).
VAWA also criminalizes interstate stalking, § 2261A; crossing or causing to cross state
lines in violation of a protective order, § 2262; and accords full faith and credit to pro-
tective orders so they can be enforced in all states and Indian lands, 18 U.S.C.A. § 2265.
A defendant’s conviction under § 2261(a)(2) was upheld in U.S. v. Page (6th Cir.
1999). After severely beating his ex-girlfriend into near-unconsciousness, the defen-
dant carried her to his car and drove for four hours across state lines, threatening her
with more violence to keep her from seeking help while her injuries worsened. Ag-
gravation of preexisting injuries while crossing state lines was held to be sufficient to
prove a criminal violation of VAWA. Ironically, a woman was convicted under VAWA
for driving from New Jersey to New York where she and an accomplice murdered her
estranged husband with axes [U.S. v. Gluzman (2d Cir. 1998)].
Federal firearms restrictions also penalize intimate partner violence offenders.
Those who are subject to a protective order and those who have been convicted of a
misdemeanor crime of domestic violence are subject to further criminal sanctions for
possession of a firearm or ammunition, 18 U.S.C.A. §§ 922 (g)(8) and (9).

Elder Abuse
Abuse of the elderly includes neglect, physical abuse, financial exploitation, emo-
tional abuse, and sexual abuse. Physical and sexual abuse and financial exploitation
are criminalized in all states. Some states also recognize emotional abuse, neglect, and
abandonment. Fifty-five percent of the cases of elder abuse are the result of neglect.
In all but eight states, certain professionals who provide services to the elderly are re-
quired to report suspected abuse. Those reports increased by more than 150 percent
between 1986 and 1996, but it is still estimated that only 16 percent of the cases of
abuse are referred for help.23
G.
KIDNAPPING, FALSE IMPRISONMENT, AND CUSTODIAL
INTERFERENCE
1.
Federal Kidnapping Statutes
Kidnapping was not considered a serious crime in this country until the baby son of
aviator Charles Lindburgh was kidnapped in 1932. The hysteria that followed
spawned harsh new laws, including the death penalty in some jurisdictions. The
death penalty has been dropped, but emotion continues to fuel reaction to any per-
ceived threat of random kidnappings. Community programs to fingerprint, video-
tape, and get DNA samples from children for later identification in case they are
abducted have been promoted, although most abductions are by parents who have
lost custody through divorce proceedings.
The Federal Kidnapping Act, 18 U.S.C.A. § 1201, establishes federal jurisdiction if
the victim is moved across state lines. It is not necessary for the defendant to know that
lines have been crossed, simply that they have, in fact, been crossed. The 1932 law
criminalized only kidnappings “for ransom or reward,” but two years later “or other-
wise” was added, which defined kidnapping as abduction for some benefit to the de-
fendant. Besides financial return, this could include such “benefits” as revenge or
silencing a witness.24 The federal law covers kidnapping by deception, as well as by
force. Receiving, possessing, or disposing of ransom is criminalized in 18 U.S.C.A.
§ 1202, and the taking of hostages by bank robbers in 18 U.S.C.A. § 2113(e). Threats to
kidnap and ransom demands that are sent through interstate communications are pro-
hibited by 18 U.S.C.A. § 875, and those sent through the mail are prohibited by §§ 876
and 877. The statute of limitations does not begin running as long as the victim is held.
Some kidnapping statutes include confinement for purposes of involuntary
servitude, compelled labor against one’s will, regardless of payment. Illegal aliens are
particularly vulnerable victims of this offense, because their complaints would result
in their deportation. The Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 states that
“[a]pproximately 50,000 women and children are trafficked into the United States
each year.” Federal laws against involuntary servitude and transporting slaves are
found in 18 U.S.C.A. §§ 1581–1588.
Kidnapping statutes may also include such offenses as harboring a runaway and
unlawful sale of a public conveyance travel ticket to a minor.25
2.
Elements of Kidnapping
Kidnapping usually includes the seizing, confining, and carrying away (asportation)
of another by force, threat, or deception, and without consent. In some states kidnap-
ping includes the elements of commission during a dangerous felony, for the purpose
of obtaining a ransom, or for political aims; in others, these elements aggravate the
crime to a more serious level. Asportation, the removal of the victim from a place of
security to one of greater danger, is usually a key element, differentiating kidnapping
from the less serious crime of false imprisonment. Risk rather than distance is the cen-
tral issue.
asportation:
the removal of the victim
from a place of security to
one of greater danger in kid-
napping; removal of goods in
theft.

120
■
CHAPTER 4
ANALYSIS PROBLEM
4–4.
Why does a request for ransom influence the seriousness of kidnap-
ping? Why is custodial interference a separate offense from kidnapping?
The decision in People v. Banks (Ill. App. 2003) enumerated considerations in kid-
napping charges:
1.
the duration of the asportation or detention,
2.
whether asportation or detention occurred during the commission of a
separate offense,
3.
whether asportation or detention is inherent in the separate offense,
4.
whether asportation or detention created a significant danger not present
to the victim in the separate offense.
In Banks, a man asked a twelve-year-old boy playing in an alley if he wanted to earn
some money cleaning out a garage at the end of the alley. When the boy started walk-
ing away, the man grabbed and dragged him ten feet toward the garage. A friend of
the boy arrived and helped him escape. The defendant’s conviction of aggravated
kidnapping was affirmed because of the short but forceful asportation, with the vic-
tim digging his heels into the ground, and intention to secretly confine the victim (ag-
gravated because the victim was under 13 years of age). A conviction for unlawful
restraint was vacated because it was based on the same elements as the kidnapping.
The question of the degree of asportation remains a problem, and some states
have dropped the element of asportation altogether, relying on other circumstances
to establish the danger of confinement. A sleeping child who was not moved or even
aware of being confined was still the victim of kidnapping in Creek v. State (Ind. App.
1992). The victim of a robbery who was restrained in a vacant apartment and tortured
after his possessions were taken was also a victim of kidnapping, because the restraint
was not simply incidental to the robbery but unnecessary and cruel in itself [People v.
Taylor (N.Y. App. Div. 1992)].
3.
False Imprisonment
False imprisonment or criminal confinement is the restraining, and sometimes re-
moval, of another without consent, but does not include the danger of injury, ransom,
or other risk factors of kidnapping. Covering a victim’s mouth to prevent her from
screaming and wrapping an arm around her to prevent her from escaping were ruled
criminal confinement [Henley v. State (Ind. 1988)]. Because Indiana law also includes
removal (asportation) as an alternate element of criminal confinement, the same con-
viction was affirmed when victims were taken upstairs in their home while intruders
ransacked the bedrooms, then back downstairs where they were tied with a vacuum
cleaner cord [Arnold v. State (Ind. 1987)].
4.
Custodial Interference
Parents or other relatives who take a child to another state with the intent of assum-
ing or petitioning for custody from the legal guardian fall under child snatching or
custodial interference statutes. States cooperate in the 1968 Uniform Child Custody
Jurisdiction Act to keep jurisdiction of such cases in the home state. The Parental Kid-
napping Prevention Act (PKPA), 28 U.S.C.A. § 1738, enforces “full faith and credit” of
a state’s child custody orders to be honored in all other states, thus removing an in-
centive for parental kidnapping. International parental kidnapping prosecutions fall
under 18 U.S.C.A. § 1204.
People v. McDonald (N.Y. Co. Ct. 1990) and State v. Butt (Me. 1995) give two differ-
ent answers to the same legal question in state custodial interference rulings.

Fulton County Court, 1990
554 N.Y.S.2d 934 Co. Ct. 1990
[Citations omitted]
FINDINGS OF FACT
The defendant and his wife Heather were married on No-
vember 1, 1985. They are the parents of two children, Ian
born November 7, 1985, and Kelly, born September 27,
1987. At the time of the incidents in question they were
domiciled at 9 Orchard Street in the City of Gloversville. For
reasons that are not relevant to this proceeding Heather Mc-
Donald left the marital residence with the two children of the
parties on September 17, 1988.After September 17 Heather
and the two children lived with her parents at 12 Wells Street
in the City of Johnstown.Two days later she filed a petition in
Fulton County Family Court seeking custody of the children.
The Order to Show Cause in the Family Court proceeding
was evidently served on the defendant on September 24,
1988, and the matter was returnable on September 30, 1988.
That Order to Show Cause did not contain a provision grant-
ing Heather McDonald custody pendente lite. On September
27, 1988, the defendant, under the pretense of visiting with
the children, took them from their mother and took them to
Buena Park, California, where his parents reside. On Sep-
tember 30 the Family Court granted Heather McDonald cus-
tody of the two McDonald children on the defendant’s default.
It further appears that a felony complaint was filed
against the defendant in the City of Johnstown and that the
defendant was apprehended in Buena Park, California, on
October 14, 1988. Defendant waived extradition and was re-
turned to this State on November 1, 1988.The children were
returned to their mother.
Defendant was indicted for Custodial Interference in
the First Degree and makes this motion to dismiss the in-
dictment.
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
Custodial Interference in the Second Degree is a necessary
subpart of Custodial Interference in the First Degree. PL
135.-50(1). Custodial Interference in the Second Degree oc-
curs when a person “. . . being a relative of a child less than
sixteen years old, intending to hold such child permanently
or for a protracted period, and knowing that he has no legal
right to do so . . . takes or entices such child from his lawful
custodian. . . .” PL 135.45(1).
I begin my analysis of this statute by defining the actus
reus, which is a taking or asportation. This is an act unitary
in time, and cannot be the subject of a continuing offense.
Did the defendant have the legal right to remove the chil-
dren at the time of the taking? Clearly he did not contravene
any court order at the time of the taking. It is worth noting
that the Order to Show Cause from the Family Court Judge
did not contain an order granting the mother of the children
temporary custody or prohibiting either party from removing
the children from the jurisdiction of the court, until the first
return date of the matter.
Therefore the issue around which this case revolves may
be framed thus: Where there is no court order to the con-
trary may a parent remove the children from the residence
of the other parent to some distant location? . . .
1) Would the meaning of the statute proposed by the
People result in a significant expansion in activity defined as
criminal, so that activity heretofore regarded as other than
criminal would by my decision become criminal activity?
and 2) Does the complainant have an adequate civil remedy
and is her use of the criminal justice system in this instance
inappropriate?
I find that to determine that the taking by a parent of a
child or children from the home of another parent prior to the
entry of any order on the issue of custody or visitation falls
within the meaning of PL 135.45 would result in criminaliz-
ing a set of activities that is not currently regarded as crimi-
nal. For example the definition proposed by the People
would mean that whenever a parent removed himself or her-
self from the marital residence, for whatever reason, and
took the child or children along without the other parent’s
permission that activity would be custodial interference. I
take cognizance of the fact that a large number of divorce
cases and custody disputes start with this physical act. It
may well be that to require one party or the other to obtain a
court order before this step is taken would be in the best in-
terests of all concerned. . . .
Finally it should be noted that in proceedings to deter-
mine custody the courts of this state take cognizance of
the harmful effects on the welfare of children that result
from acts like those alleged to have been committed by
the defendant herein. Because of this I find that an ade-
quate civil remedy exists for the mother of the children in
this case and that use of the criminal justice system is in-
appropriate.
Accordingly the indictment herein is dismissed.

CHAPTER 4
STATE v. BUTT
Supreme Judicial Court of Maine, 1995
656 A.2d 1225 Me 1995
[Citations omitted]
Butt was charged with committing two counts (one count for
each of his two youngest children) of criminal restraint by a
parent in violation of 17–A M.R.S.A. § 303(1)(A) during Sep-
tember 1992.In the same indictment, Merryanne Morningstar
was charged with two counts of aiding Butt in committing crim-
inal restraint by a parent. After the trial court granted Morn-
ingstar’s motion to sever her trial, Butt was tried before a jury
in April 1993, at which the following evidence was revealed:
At the time of trial, Butt had been married to Diane Butt
for twenty-four years and they had four children, the two
youngest being 12 and 7 years of age. Butt worked as a
counselor helping people leave religious cults. He coun-
seled Morningstar, and in May or June 1992, Morningstar
moved in with the Butts. In early July, Butt told his wife that
he and Morningstar had been married by God, that Diane
would have to accept it, and that they all were going to live
under the same roof as one family. Butt subsequently told
Diane that he had heard from God and she had to obey his
decisions. Although Diane initially accepted the arrange-
ment, she became troubled with the situation and ex-
pressed her concern to her husband. Butt told a friend that
unless Diane accepted the situation, he was going to take
the youngest children and not return.The friend warned Butt
that there would be legal repercussions, but Butt “believed
that God would take care of things.”
On September 1, 1992, the situation came to a head.Butt
and Diane had a physical struggle in their kitchen during
which Butt pulled Diane to the floor and attempted to cast
the “Jezebel spirit” out of her. Shortly after the struggle, Butt
and Morningstar took the two youngest children and left.
Diane never consented to Butt and Morningstar taking
the two children. Diane tried to get her children back and
hired a private investigator. She learned that the children
had been taken to Maryland. Diane received a letter from
Butt telling her that she would not find the children and that
he intended to keep the children and live elsewhere. Diane
never spoke with Butt while he was away, but Butt did speak
with his older son several times. Butt told his son that he
would not bring the children back until Diane accepted Morn-
ingstar and that he could stay away without being found.
After an arrest warrant was issued, Butt was arrested in
Waterville and the children were located at a mobile home
in Canaan. In response to questioning by a detective, Butt
said that his intention was to take the children to a place
where Diane could not find them. He told the detective that
he returned to Maine from Maryland because private detec-
tives were looking for the children and he did not want them
to be located.
At the close of the State’s case, Butt moved for a judg-
ment of acquittal. He contended that the State had pre-
sented insufficient evidence because it had not shown that
he had violated a court order and, therefore, there was no
evidence that he lacked the legal right to take the children.
The trial court denied the motion. Butt then testified in his
own defense.
The jury returned guilty verdicts on both counts, and the
trial court accordingly entered judgments of convictions.
Butt appealed.
17–A M.R.S.A.§ 303(1) (1983) provides, in pertinent part:
1.
A person is guilty of criminal restraint by parent if, be-
ing the parent of a child under the age of 16, and
knowing he has no legal right to do so, he:
A.
Takes, retains or entices the child from the cus-
tody of his other parent, guardian or other law-
ful custodian with the intent to remove the child
from the State or to secrete him and hold him in
a place where he is not likely to be found; or
B.
Takes, retains or entices the child from the cus-
tody of his other parent, guardian or other lawful
custodian, whose custodial authority was estab-
lished by a court of this State, in the state in
which the child is residing with his legal custo-
dian with the intent to remove the child from that
state or to secrete him and hold him in a place
where he is not likely to be found.
Whether a violation of a custody decree is a prerequisite
to prove a violation of section 303(1)(A) is a question of
statutory interpretation, and thus a matter for this court. In
interpreting a statute, we first examine the plain meaning of
the statutory language. The fundamental rule in the inter-
pretation of any statute is that the intent of the legislature,
as divined from the statutory language itself, controls.
Section 303(1)(A) does not prohibit a parent from taking
his or her child. Rather, it prohibits the taking of a child from
the custody of the other parent with the purpose of secret-
ing and holding the child in a place where the child is not
likely to be found, with the knowledge that the parent has no
legal right to do so. The plain language of section 303(1)(A)
does not require a violation of a custody decree for there to
be a violation of its provisions. In contrast, section 303(1)(B)
provides explicitly that the custody of a parent or a lawful

In the decisions of McDonald and Butt, what are the factors you think

think these factors were appropriate considerations in these cases?
custodian must be “established by a court of this state” in or-
der for there to be a violation of that section.
The State proved that Butt, as the parent, took his children
from their home where their mother had equal legal custody
and control over them, and that his purpose was to keep them
away from their mother; to secrete them and hold them in a
place where they were not likely to be found. Butt contends,
however, that the State failed to prove that he knew he had
no legal right to take the children and keep them from their
mother. Relying on the legislative history of section 303, he
points to the absence of a court order granting custody to the
mother and contends that such an order is required in order
for there to be a violation of section 303(1)(A). We disagree.
In the absence of a court order awarding custody of chil-
dren, both parents are jointly entitled to their care, custody,
and control. 19 M.R.S.A. § 211 (1981). Although as a parent,
Butt had rights of custody in regard to his children, so too did
his wife Diane, the mother of those children.Butt can point to
no convincing reason or any authority why, absent a contrary
court order, section 303(1)(A) does not prohibit one parent
from depriving the other parent of their legal right to joint cus-
tody.Butt, after all, deprived Diane of any and all contact with
the children.There is no requirement in the plain language of
section 303(1)(A), as there is in section 303(1)(B), that those
custody rights flow from a court order or decree. Moreover,
Butt can point to no court order granting custody of his minor
children to him. Accordingly, the jury was entitled to find that
Butt knew that he had no legal right to take and secrete his
children, and to keep them from their mother. . . .
Neither in the original comment to the statute, nor in its
subsequent changes, has the Legislature ever stated that a
person cannot violate section 303 unless he is in contra-
vention of a court ordered custody decree.
The entry is judgments affirmed. All concurring.
III.
CRIMES AGAINST HABITATION
A.
INTRODUCTION
Offenses against habitation are a special type of property crime. Besides damage and
potential damage to property, these crimes pose a threat to the security and privacy
of people. Focusing on that right of security, common law burglary and arson in-
cluded only offenses against dwellings and other buildings within the curtilage (area
of land, enclosed or otherwise, around a dwelling or other buildings used for do-
mestic purposes). The possible targets for these crimes have been widely expanded
by modern statutes and decisions.
B.
ARSON
1.
Burning
All the actus reus elements of the common law offense have been broadened in at
least some jurisdictions. “Burning” often includes “exploding” and requires that fire
not only be started, but actually cause damage to the structure. Many states, however,
now include “damage caused by fire” or “sets fire to” as part of the definition of ar-
son, allowing for conviction where there is limited damage. There must be at least a
perceptible change in composition or structure. In the case of Lynch v. State (Ind. App.
1977) the defendant’s conviction for arson was upheld even though damage from a
burning object thrown at a house was limited to blistering and discoloration of paint.
Explosion is not technically “burning,” but many states specifically include it in their
arson statutes. Burning crimes also include setting fire to woods, prairies, and crops;
and refusing to aid or obstructing extinguishment of fires.

124
■
CHAPTER 4
2.
Property
Property subject to arson now goes far beyond the “dwelling house” of common law
to include commercial buildings, public buildings, and even bridges. Some statutes
classify arson according to the value or use of property damaged. First degree arson
usually involves occupied buildings, including homes, where fire presents a danger
to life. Second degree arson includes unoccupied buildings and sometimes vehicles.
There may be a third degree that refers to other types of property. Charges may be
aggravated if a firefighter or police officer is injured in the line of duty relating to
the crime.
A defendant convicted of felony murder based on arson had his conviction re-
manded (returned for further action) in People v. Reeves (Mich. 1995). The building he
burned was a dilapidated, abandoned house not considered a dwelling. Because
there was no arson, there also was no felony murder of the firefighter who was killed
in the fire. In Fox v. State (Ind. App. 1979), the burning of a barn converted into a com-
bination garage and recreation room about 100 feet from the house was considered
arson. Its domestic use placed it within the curtilage of the dwelling.
3.
Ownership
The element that the building must belong to another has been adhered to except
where the owner intends to defraud an insurance company or lienholder, or if an-
other person has an interest in the building. This led to an interesting technical prob-
lem in State v. Houck (Kan. 1986). Read the decision in this case in Chapter 8. In
Livingston v. State (Ala. Cr. App. 1979), a defendant and his wife were making pay-
ments toward ownership of a mobile home. The defendant had moved out, and the
home was occupied by his wife, stepdaughter, and her family. When he burned the
home he was guilty of arson, in spite of his co-ownership, because of his wife’s pos-
sessory interest.
4.
Mens Rea
“Malicious” and “willful” are the usual mens rea requirements of arson. Intent is gen-
eral with regard to setting the fire, not specific as to the damage caused by the fire. An
intent to destroy, of course, raises the degree of the offense.
Some statutes require specific intent to burn a structure when that burning is
caused by setting fire to a substance other than the structure, as shown in People v.
Fabris (Cal. 1995). The defendant claimed that a neighbor’s goats had gotten into his
house through a door left ajar and either chewed through wiring or tipped over a gas
can to start the fire that burned the home. Although the bodies of two goats were
found in the house, other evidence showed that the doors had been locked, gasoline
had been used to set fires to draperies in two areas of the house, and the defendant
was desperate for the insurance money, so his conviction for arson was affirmed.
5.
Federal Statutes
Federal arson statutes include 18 U.S.C.A. § 81, which covers arson within maritime
and territorial jurisdiction, and 18 U.S.C.A. § 844, which covers use of explosives or
fire while committing any other federal crime or to threaten persons or destroy prop-
erty used in interstate commerce. A juvenile who burned papers in the principal’s of-
fice of a school on Indian lands and caused more than $400,000 worth of damage was
guilty of arson under § 81 [U.S. v. M.W. (10th Cir. 1989)]. The court found that the de-
fendant had “practically certain” knowledge the papers would ignite the building
and serious damage would result.
Even though a defendant had no knowledge that interstate commerce was in-
volved at a tavern he set on fire, interstate shipments of liquor brought the tavern un-

Crimes Against Persons and Crimes Against Habitation
■125
der the protection of § 844(i) for an arson conviction [U.S. v. Muza (8th Cir. 1986)].
Arson of a home used as a rental property also qualified for a federal charge under
the interstate commerce clause [Russell v. U.S. (1985)]. In Jones v. U.S. (2000), the
Supreme Court ruled that “use” in interstate commerce did not include the passive
use of out-of-state providers of natural gas, a mortgage, and insurance for a private
dwelling, but that the property itself must be actively used in commerce. The burn-
ing of a fire station, however, invoked the Commerce Clause in spite of the building’s
nonprofit status. The court in U.S. v. Laton (6th Cir. 2003) instructs that the first inquiry
is into the function of the building, then whether the function affects interstate com-
merce. Since the firehouse protected businesses involved in interstate commerce,
serviced a stretch of federal highway, and impacted local insurance rates that affected
commerce, the case falls within the jurisdiction of the federal statutes.
C.
VANDALISM
Vandalism or malicious mischief is intentional or wanton damage done to real or per-
sonal property. Unlike arson, there is no limit on the means of causing the damage
nor on the type of property targeted. Penalties usually depend on the amount of
damage done.
D.
BURGLARY
1.
Common Law
In medieval Europe, intrusion into a secure place such as a dwelling, church, or even
a walled town was considered burglary. By the seventeenth century the definition of
a burglar was narrowed, according to English jurist Sir Edward Coke, to “a felon, that
in the night breaketh and entereth into the mansion house of another, with the intent
to kill some reasonable creature, or to commit some other felony within the same,
whether his felonious intent be executed or not.”26 Modern statutes have modified
each of the elements in Sir Coke’s definition, moving toward the broader scope of me-
dieval law.
2.
Breaking
“Breaking” can mean anything from actually breaking down a door to pushing
through an already unlatched door. If something is moved to gain entry, the element
of breaking is satisfied. Constructive breaking goes even further to include tricking or
threatening the owner to open the door. Entry through an unusual opening, such as
a chimney, is also constructive breaking.
People v. Frey (Ill. App. 1984) upheld a burglary conviction for stealing a hammer
from the open back of a pickup. The court maintained that “unlawful entry may be
accomplished by ‘breaking the close’ defined by the four sides, the bottom, and the
imaginary plane extending atop the sides and parallel to the bottom.” Some states
have revised their laws to specify a “closed vehicle,” so there was no burglary where
the defendant reached through an open window to steal a stereo from a truck in State
v. Martinez (Idaho App. 1995).
Under a statute that had been expanded to include “effective consent” for legal
entry, a defendant who walked through an open door with the intent to commit rape
and theft was guilty of burglary, because the building was not open to the public
[Clark v. State (Tex. App. 1984)]. When a defendant took his victim to her home and
made her open the door at gunpoint, the threat of force was enough to qualify as
breaking in Dew v. State (Ind. 1982). A victim’s consent to enter his home was nulli-
fied by the intent of the defendant to sell fraudulent securities [People v. Salemme (Cal.
App. 1992)].

126
■
CHAPTER 4
3.
Entering
“Entry” is the process of going into the private area after access has been gained through
“breaking.” It can be ever so slight, including in one case a severed finger caught under
a window. A defendant who presented a stolen and forged check to a teller at a check
cashing business by placing the check in a chute at the walk-up window had not “en-
tered” the building and so was not guilty of burglary [People v. Davis (Cal. 1998)].
A substitute for entry under some state statutes is surreptitious remaining, en-
tering an area lawfully but staying beyond a lawful time without permission, such as
in a store after closing hours. A defendant who simply entered a store during busi-
ness hours with the intent to rob had committed burglary [Clark v. Commonwealth (Va.
App. 1996)].
4.
Structure
The type of structure that burglary applies to varies and is likely to affect the degree
of the charge, so careful reading of the statute is especially necessary here. An at-
tached garage has been construed as part of a dwelling, People v. Jiminez (Colo. 1982).
Many states include any structure or building and even vehicles, and may allow more
severe penalties for entering a car to steal a jacket from the seat than for stealing the
entire car. Burglary was applied to a nondwelling in a fenced enclosure [McCovens v.
State (Ind. 1989)] and an office cubicle in an unlocked area where a wallet was re-
moved from a purse [People v. Terry (N.Y.A.D. 2003)].
The Model Penal Code § 221.0(1) deals with the problems inherent in these cases
by limiting burglary to occupied structures, that is, “any structure, vehicle or place
adapted for overnight accommodation of persons, or for carrying on business therein,
whether or not a person is actually present.” Some states have adopted this definition.
An abandoned building is not subject to burglary, according to the code.
5.
Ownership
The element requiring the burglarized structure to belong to another comes into dis-
pute when the defendant may share the right to enter the structure. A defendant who
owned a house jointly with his wife committed burglary when he entered it against
an order of protection giving her exclusive possession of it [People v. Williams (Ill. App.
1991)]. When no such protective order had been issued, however, an estranged hus-
band could legally enter his wife’s residence [Kennedy v. State (Ga. App. 1994)]. A ju-
venile who entered his mother’s home after she locked him out without care or other
means for shelter or support was not guilty of burglary, because the parental duty of
care was not met [State v. Howe (Wash. 1991)].
6.
Time of Day
Some jurisdictions eliminate the element of nighttime from burglary. Most retain it as
an aggravating circumstance because darkness favors the stealth of the burglar, mak-
ing identification more difficult and increasing the fear of the victim.
7.
Mens Rea
The mens rea of burglary is the specific intent to commit a crime. Many jurisdictions
require that crime to be a felony or any level of theft, but some allow the intent to com-
mit any crime, no matter how petty, to suffice. Completion of the intended crime is
not an element of burglary. Intent may be inferred from circumstances. In McCovens,
intent could be inferred from the movement of items to the front gate. When the in-
tended crime is a legal impossibility, however, burglary has not taken place. A defen-
dant in custody fled into a nearby apartment with the intent to escape, but because
the escape was already complete, intent was nullified and his burglary conviction was
reversed [Lawhorn v. State (Tex. Cr. App. 1995)].
surreptitious remaining:
entering an area lawfully but
staying beyond a lawful time
without permission, such as
in a store after closing
hours.

Crimes Against Persons and Crimes Against Habitation
■127
Entry for other purposes, such as to take shelter, is not burglary. Defendants who
enter with intent but later change their minds are still guilty of burglary. Those who
enter the premises without intent, such as a houseguest who is shown the host’s coin
collection and later decides to steal it, are not burglars. Some statutes incorporate
mens rea into their grading system, placing a higher degree of severity on intent to
commit a felony or larceny than on intent to commit other misdemeanors.
8.
Breaking and Entering, Trespassing
Breaking and entering without intent to commit a crime is criminal trespass, a mis-
demeanor. Grading is more severe if entry is into a dwelling, involves a weapon, oc-
curs at night, or is in defiance of notice not to trespass, such as posting or fencing.
Severity of the crime usually depends on the probability of injury to persons rather
than on the value of property.
The U.S. Supreme Court in Virginia v. Hicks (2003) upheld a conviction for tres-
passing in a housing development whose streets had been closed to public use and
privatized to control rising crime and drug dealing in the area. Signs were posted at
the entrances to the development giving notice that unauthorized persons would be
subject to arrest. The defendant had been warned and forbidden to return to the prop-
erty, and on a subsequent visit was arrested for trespassing. The Court ruled that the
regulations were not unconstitutionally overbroad.
9.
Burglary as an Inchoate Crime
Burglary, as a preliminary step to another crime, can be seen as an inchoate, or in-
complete, offense. As it disrupts the security of persons in their homes and in regard
to their personal property, however, it is complete as soon as the intrusion is made.
This dual nature is at the heart of a debate about whether the crime of burglary ought
to be abolished, leaving its elements to be covered by attempt or as aggravating cir-
cumstances to other crimes, or retained and the grading schemes reformed to reflect
the seriousness of the individual offense.
In effect piling an inchoate crime onto an inchoate crime, the possession of bur-
glar’s tools with the intent to use them in a burglary is a serious offense, a felony in
some jurisdictions. Gloves that a defendant was trying to shake off as he ran from the
site of a burglary were identified as burglar’s tools in Green v. State (Fla. App. 1991).
A discussion of inchoate crimes is in Chapter 6.

Common Elements of Crimes

CONCLUSION
Chapter 4 covers crimes that result in death, injury, and fear to their victims. Crimes
against persons attack the individual directly, as in murder, assault crimes, abuse
crimes, and kidnapping. Crimes against habitation are indirect, destroying the secu-
rity of the individual within the dwelling, as in arson and burglary.
Whether in common law or statute, each offense has specific elements that must
be satisfied by the facts of the case. The most common elements have been discussed
here, but your state’s statutes and their interpretation in court decisions will form the
bedrock of your work in criminal law. The chart in Exhibit 4–3 summarizes the ele-
ments of the crimes against persons and habitation.
The benefits of studying substantive law go beyond its strictly practical applica-
tions, beyond learning to use it as a tool, to an understanding of the development of
our goals for a better society. What human values can you find in criminal statutes?
Who or what is being protected, and why? Which laws are likely to endure, and
which are ripe for change?

APPLICATION ASSIGNMENTS
1.
Look up and compare People v. Morabito, 580 N.Y.S. 2d 843 (City Ct. 1992)
and State v. Gray, 584 N.E.2d 710 (Ohio 1992) with McKnight v. State, 576
S.E.2d 168 (S.C. 2003). How do you account for the difference in the
decisions?
2.
In Case I, were the actions of Eldon Spiers the legally significant cause of
Kate Lamb’s death? What if she had died more than a year and a day after
the incident, according to your state law? Explain.
3.
Compare the following cases to examples of felony murder in the text.
Could the defendants be convicted of felony murder based on those cases?
How would they be decided based on statutes and cases in your
jurisdiction?
a.
The defendant murdered a man, then raped the victim’s wife. The
felony murder charge was based on the felony of rape [State v.
Williams, 660 N.E.2d 724 (Ohio 1996)].
b.
Accomplices armed with a BB gun, club, and pocket knife broke into a
house to rob the owner. The victim, who had heard them coming and
had his rifle ready, shot and killed one of them. The defendant had
planned the robbery but remained outside in his truck while it was
taking place [State v. Oimen, 516 N.W.2d 399 (Wis. 1994)].

Crimes Against Persons and Crimes Against Habitation

c.
As two felons fled the scene of a drug deal, one was killed by pursuing
police. The remaining defendant was charged with felony
manslaughter [State v. Kalathakis, 563 So.2d 228 (La. 1990)].
d.
The driver of a stolen vehicle leads police on a high-speed chase. Two
pursuing helicopters collide, killing officers riding in them [People v.
Acosta, 284 Cal. Rptr. 117 (Cal. App. 1991)].
4.
A fifteen-year-old boy loaded live and dummy shells into a shotgun,
pointed it at the thirteen-year-old victim and said, “Let’s play Polish
roulette. Who is first?” then pulled the trigger [People v. Roe, 542 N.E.2d 610
(N.Y. 1989)]. What is the mens rea in this killing, and, therefore, what is the
proper charge?
5.
A man strangled his fiancee to death when she admitted to infidelity. What
charge is appropriate [State v. Shane, 590 N.E.2d 272 (Ohio 1992)]?
6.
A police officer heard gunshots and saw people running. At the scene he
and the defendant moved back and forth between cars while the defendant
pointed a gun at the officer, which indicated an intent to frighten. When
the defendant eventually put the gun down, it was found to be loaded. A
“present ability” to carry out a threat was required. The officer was not
actually afraid. Should the defendant be charged with assault on the police
officer [Robinson v. U.S., 506 A.2d 572 (D.C. App. 1986)]?
7.
Consistent with case examples of deadly weapons in assault, would you
consider the teeth used to bite off a piece of a man’s nose to be a deadly
weapon?
8.
What is the appropriate charge in your state against a defendant who
knowingly has the AIDS virus and engages in unprotected, consensual sex?
9.
A father who recklessly threw a hammer into the wall just above his baby
son’s crib was convicted of assault. The conviction was reversed because
there was no intent and the baby was not aware of the danger [Harrod v.
State, 499 A.2d 959 (Md. App. 1985)]. What criminal charge would have
been more appropriate for the father’s conduct?
10.
A father began fondling his older daughter when she was six years old,
then progressed to vaginal manipulation, then vaginal and anal
penetration. This continued beyond the girl’s thirteenth year, with oral sex
being used as a punishment. The same conduct followed with the younger
daughter from the age of five until seven, when the father stood trial for
the offenses. Considering the Tennessee sexual offenses statutes in the text,
for what crimes could the father be charged [State v. Hallock, 875 S.W.2d
285 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1993)]?
11.
When the actus reus of omission is not specifically stated in the statute,
should a woman be charged with child abuse for watching her husband
and another man engage in sexual intercourse with a twelve-year-old girl
temporarily in her custody and replying to the girl that she “really didn’t
care” about it [Degren v. State, 722 A.2d 887 (Md. 1999)]?
12.
If evidence shows that a defendant tied up a victim in his own home
without moving the victim to another location or placing the victim in
additional harm, can that defendant be convicted of kidnapping in your
state? If the victim was moved to the basement before being tied, should the
defendant be charged with kidnapping or false imprisonment in your state?
13.
A defendant who set fire to an apartment building when he had been
turned out by friends he had been staying with claimed that his
intoxication and borderline mental retardation prevented intent for the
crime of arson. Is this an effective defense [State v. Doyon, 416 A.2d 130 (R.I.
1980)]? Why or why not?
14.
In Case III of Chapter 1, if Cat Bermuda had set fire to a pile of dry leaves
to distract the mayor’s guests as she made her entry into his house, and

132
■
CHAPTER 4
the leaves in turn set fire to the house, should she be charged with arson in
your state?
15.
Should burglary be charged in the following cases?
a.
A man knocks on the door, gives the name of the occupant’s brother
when asked who is there, and enters with the intent to commit armed
robbery [Commonwealth v. Labare, 416 N.E.2d 534 (Mass. App. 1981)].
b.
A man walked into a bank and used another person’s automatic teller
card to receive cash [State v. Hysell, 569 So.2d 866 (Fla. App. 1990)].
c.
A man entered his own home in violation of a court order not to do so
[People v. Szpara, 492 N.W.2d 804 (Mich. App. 1992)].
d.
Intending a felony, one man entered an apartment legally, then locked
the occupant in the bathroom and opened the door to his partner. Did
the partner commit burglary? What about another occasion when the
partner gained entry by impersonating a police officer [State v. Lozier,
375 So.2d 1333 (La. 1979)]?
e.
Could requisite intent be inferred from the defendant’s driving his
truck near a home shortly before it was broken into and previously
discussing stealing the victim’s guns with a partner [Hall v. State, 293
S.E.2d 862 (Ga. App. 1982)]?
16.
Should Miguel Cordoba be charged with burglary in Case II? Why or
why not?
17.
One defendant appeared at the door to ask the mother of a former
boyfriend to use her phone, then the two defendants burst into the house,
demanding money. They killed the woman, ransacked the house, taking
jewelry, guns, and a mink coat, then wrapped the body of the victim in a
carpet and loaded it into the trunk of the victim’s car. They drove the car to
a field several miles away and set it on fire. What crimes covered in this
chapter could the defendants be charged with [Caudill v. Commonwealth,
120 S.W.3d 635 (Ky. 2003)]?

INTRODUCTION
Chapter 5 continues the study of elements of crimes, focusing on crimes against prop-
erty (i.e., the ownership of property) and crimes against public rights to a decent, safe,
and orderly society. You will see the marks of evolution in these areas of criminal law.
In crimes against property, element definitions got tangled as larceny broadened
to include embezzlement and fraud. Elements of crimes against persons are carried
into robbery and extortion. And change speeds up as criminal law tries to keep up
with technological advancements.
In crimes against society, the law struggles to respond to the horror of terrorism
and to find a balance between fear and constitutional rights. Public opinion as to the
criminality of gun use, certain sexual acts, and drug use continues to shift, and legis-
lators hurry to keep pace. Even crimes against justice and public administration, such
as obstruction of justice, are the object of renewed scrutiny when corporate leaders
are charged.
This chapter presents an overview of elements of these crimes. Continue to refer
to your state statutes and court opinions for concrete examples of the elements you
need to know for work in your jurisdiction.
II.
CRIMES AGAINST PROPERTY
A.
INTRODUCTION
The variously detailed property crimes in modern statutes all grew out of the com-
mon law crime of larceny, a capital offense that served the needs of a simple, agrar-
ian society. Taking animals or implements amounted to stealing one’s means of
livelihood and was punished severely. Stealing a harvested and stored crop was lar-
ceny, but unharvested crops were still part of the land and were covered by real es-
tate law. Misappropriation by stealth or force was larceny, but cheating was a clever
business angle.
Property accumulated and commerce increased, affording a wider variety of tar-
gets for the thief and means for obtaining them that outgrew the simple concept of
larceny. Tangible property that was valuable in itself, such as a cow or a coin, was
joined in importance by intangible property, or “choses in action,” that was not valu-
able in itself but conveyed value, such as checks, bonds, and promissory notes. Prop-
erty was more frequently handled through intermediaries during the course of
business transactions and banking processes, so trust and not trickery was essential
to the growing commercial economy. In addition, judges were reluctant to expand the
larceny death penalty to new forms of theft. One by one, statutes were written to deal
with new circumstances as they arose. The resulting confusion gives us a picture of
the development of history rather than of a logical body of law.

Introduction
Larceny elements include the wrongful taking and carrying away of another’s prop-
erty with intent to permanently deprive the owner of its possession. The value of the
property taken is the element that usually determines the degree of the crime. The cut-
off between misdemeanor (petit) and felony (grand) larceny can range as low as $20
to as much as $2,000, but usually falls between $100 and $400. Some jurisdictions in-
clude specific kinds of property that are locally significant and often specify value lev-
els for that property. For example, grand larceny in California is the theft of property
with a value of more than $400, or farm crops valued at more than $100. Texas specif-
ically includes oil and natural gas in its larceny statute. It is not necessary that the de-
intangible property:
“choses in action”; property
not valuable in itself but that
conveys value, such as
checks, bonds, and promis-
sory notes.

fendant know the value of the property, or intend to steal only a certain amount; the
grading is based on the actual value of the property. Problems arise in determining
the value of a credit card, for example, or of trade secrets, or of the use of a computer.
The method of taking also can affect grading and even the definition of the crime
committed. Because of potential harm to persons, pickpocketing and stealing from a
dwelling are always felonies. If force is used, the crime is no longer larceny, but robbery.
2.
Actus Reus in Larceny
Taking or appropriating is the element of establishing control over the property, such
as picking a wallet from a pocket or getting into a stranger’s car and starting the en-
gine. Wrongful or trespassory taking is taking from the possession of the owner with-
out consent. The thief, in effect, “trespasses” on the possession of the owner in order
to remove the property from him or her. Possession originally meant in the physical
presence of the owner, but came to include constructive possession of goods not un-
der physical control of the owner, such as goods in the custody of an employee, an
item given over for repair while the owner waits, or a lost item. As you will see in the
discussion of embezzlement, false pretenses, and extortion, consent and possession
are difficult to define and have a great effect on the decision of what crime to charge.
Carrying away is the element of asportation that we saw in kidnapping. In lar-
ceny, however, the amount of movement required is only slight, such as the few
inches it takes to begin to remove a wallet from a pocket. “Carrying” can be the driv-
ing away of a car, or may not involve touching the property at all. Astudent who finds
an instructor’s exam answer key on a table in the library and without touching it sells
it to a second student who carries it off in a bookpack, is responsible for the wrongful
taking and asportation of the key by use of an innocent agent. The transfer of funds
by wire from a federally insured savings and loan bank to an account elsewhere ful-
filled the element of asportation in U.S. v. Morgan (9th Cir. 1986).
Determining sufficient asportation is difficult when goods are taken from the
shelf of a store and carried toward the exit, but the taker is apprehended before leav-
ing the store. Usually some evidence to show intent is necessary, such as concealment
of the goods in a pocket. The defendant in Welch v. Commonwealth (Va. App. 1992) was
confronted by the store manager as he was pushing a shopping cart containing two
television sets through an outdoor gardening department where there were no cash
registers. The defendant fled, warning the pursuing manager, “Don’t make me shoot
you,” which was enough to indicate intent to steal. State v. Richard (Neb. 1984) over-
turned the conviction of a defendant who was stopped as he approached the check-
out, because intent was not sufficiently shown by the circumstances.
The property that is subject to larceny under common law is tangible personal
property that can be physically moved. Although modern codes with consolidated
theft statutes include intangible property and services, codes that rely on common law
larceny do not. Use of a landfill without paying fees was not larceny in Commonwealth
v. Rivers (Mass. App. 1991). A defendant who stole a credit card and made purchases
with it could be convicted only of theft of the value of the card itself. The merchandise
and credit line available through the card were not subject to larceny, so his conviction
was reduced from grand to petit larceny [Owolabi v. Commonwealth (Va. App. 1993)].
It is the owner’s loss, other than sentimental value, rather than the thief’s gain
that determines valuation for grading purposes. Theft of unendorsed checks was
graded according to their face value rather than that they were worthless to the thief
[Gallegos v. State (N.M. 1992)].
As in crimes against habitation, the property must belong to “another.” Com-
mon law held that a husband could not commit larceny against his wife, but most
states passed Married Women’s Property Acts in the mid-1800s, making such
charges possible against partners or spouses, except when the property is held in
common by spouses, such as household goods. In State v. Kuntz (Mont. 1994), the de-
fendant was convicted of felony theft for diverting partnership funds to a personal

140
■
CHAPTER 5
bank account. He “exerted unauthorized control” over property with intent to de-
prive the owner, a consolidated theft crime rather than common law larceny. Fol-
lowing common law, however, State v. Durant (Or. App. 1993) reversed the
conviction of a defendant who had taken property from a business where he had 40
percent ownership. Larceny charges were reinstated against a defendant who took
his own car from a wrecking service where he owed towing and storage charges
[People v. Sheldon (Mich. App. 1995)].
claim of right:
defense to theft; belief by the
taker that the property in the
possession of another actu-
ally belongs to the taker.
3.
Mens Rea in Larceny
Intent must be to permanently deprive the possessor of the property. Temporarily tak-
ing without permission, such as joyriding in another’s car, is a less serious offense in
most jurisdictions. Intent to pay the owner is not a defense, unless the property was
for sale. An intent to return the property can be a defense if there is evidence of the in-
tent along with a present ability to do so. As you can see in State v. Langford (La. 1986)
at the end of the consolidated theft section, the fact that the money has already been
spent and cannot be returned negates an intent to return it. The belief by the taker that
he or she has a claim of right on the property, that is, that the property actually be-
longs to him or her, is a defense. Sally lends Joan her string of pearls for the holidays
and Joan fails to return it. Later, if Sally takes a string of pearls that is lying on a table
in Joan’s house, believing it to be hers, she has a defense to the charge of larceny. A
robber who said he was only recovering the money he loaned to the victim did not
have a claim of right, however, according to the decision in State v. Bull (N.J. 1992).
Under a New Jersey law that limits such claims to specific property, the money would
have had to be the exact same bills that had been loaned to the victim for the claim to
apply. The person leasing a piece of property to another would not have a claim of
right on that property as long as the terms of the lease were in effect.
Larceny requires the concurrence of the taking and carrying away with an intent
to steal. A defendant took an item of clothing from a store rack, hid it on her person,
and left the store without paying for it. When she saw a security officer following her,
she ran back into the store and threw the clothing under a rack. State v. Ellis (La. App.
1993) affirmed her conviction, because her criminal intent was shown by circum-
stances to concur with the taking. Modern statutes, however, extend the definition of
larceny to include criminal intent formed after an innocent taking.
4.
Types of Larceny
Classic larceny is by stealth, where the thief sneaks behind the owner’s back to steal
the goods. Another type of larceny occurs when the defendant has innocent custody
of property of another then decides to keep it, such as a finder taking lost property
without an attempt to return it, a receiver keeping property that has been delivered
by mistake, and a bailee—an employee or agent caring for the property of another—
who converts the owner’s property to the bailee’s own use.
A defendant employed by a nonprofit organization conducted courses in basic
trauma life support at a hospital and several mining companies. He took payment for
the courses from the hospital and mines, deposited it in the organization’s account,
paid expenses from the account, then spent the rest as his own personal income. He
was convicted of larceny by a bailee of the money received from the hospital that was
bailee:
an employee or agent caring
for the property of another.

in excess of expenses. Lahr v. State (Wyo. 1992) reversed his conviction because the
trauma education program was not owned by the hospital, and their payment to the
defendant gave him “ownership” of the money. The court remarked that overbilling
is a civil rather than criminal matter. Read State v. Langford (La. 1986) for an example
of mistaken delivery larceny.
A third type of larceny is larceny by trick. It is the taking of custody but not title
to property, using written or spoken misrepresentation of fact or false promises to
achieve temporary custody (by borrowing or renting, for example) in order to remove
the property from the owner. At this point the owner still has constructive possession
of the property. The crime is completed when the thief takes the property under unau-
thorized control by selling it or keeping it for the thief’s own use.
Larceny by trick was first defined by the English case of The King v. Pear (Cr. Cas.
Res. 1779). The defendant rented a horse to go to one town, intending instead to go to
another town and sell the horse, which he did. The owner gave consent to take the
horse, so the previous element of trespass on the possession of the owner had to be
stretched to include the constructive possession that the owner retained throughout
the rental. The trespassory taking occurred when the horse was sold. A larceny by
trick conviction for obtaining credit cards by using false Social Security numbers was
affirmed in Owolabi v. Commonwealth (Va. App. 1993). Likewise, in the previous ex-
ample of the borrowing of the string of pearls, if Joan intended from the first to per-
manently deprive Sally of the pearls, she was guilty of larceny by trick.
Remember that the following crimes grew out of the common law offense of lar-
ceny, and that they share many of the same elements. We will concentrate on the ways
they differ from larceny.
C.
EMBEZZLEMENT
When a bank teller who stole money deposited by a customer was acquitted of lar-
ceny in The King v. Bazeley (K.B. 1799), it was clear that a new law was needed to cover
theft without the element of trespass. In embezzlement, the offender has been given
legal possession of goods or money by its owner. The larceny element of “taking” is
replaced by “conversion,” or misappropriation, for one’s own use of property in
one’s lawful possession. In some jurisdictions, this person must be an agent, fiduci-
ary, public officer, or attorney. In others, anyone to whom property is entrusted, such
as repairers, cleaners, or parking lot attendants, may be guilty of embezzlement.
Where the latter group is excluded from prosecution for embezzlement, larceny by
trick may be the appropriate charge.
The question is whether the agent has the greater authority of possession of the
property and would be guilty of embezzlement with conversion, or has the lesser au-
thority of custody (while the owner retains constructive possession) and would be
guilty of larceny. Both possession and custody are covered by the terms control and
care of property in some embezzlement statutes.
A contractor was paid in advance to do five remodeling jobs. For three of the jobs
the prepayment was for materials needed to do the work. For the other two jobs, the
prepayment was simply a part of the total cost of the job to the homeowner. In all
cases, the contractor kept the money but did not do the work. He was convicted on
five counts of embezzlement. State v. Joy (Wash. 1993) affirmed the three counts for
money that was intended to purchase materials, because that was still “owned” by the
homeowner. The other two counts were remanded for retrial on theft by deception,
because the contractor had obtained “ownership” of the money when he was paid.
Intent to deprive, usually expressed by the term fraudulently, is the mens rea for
embezzlement. A county sheriff who temporarily deposited in his own account and
collected interest on funds intended for the purchase of food for prisoners was ac-
quitted because neither the county nor the prisoners were deprived [State v. Matthews
(Okla. Cr. 1991)]. A chairman of the board of trustees who issued checks to himself

D.
FALSE PRETENSES OR FRAUD
1.
Transfer of Title
England closed another gap in the larceny law in 1757 by passing a statute criminal-
izing fraud. One who knowingly and intentionally makes a false representation of
material past or present fact to cause the owner to give the offender title to the
owner’s property has committed the crime of obtaining property by false pretenses,
or fraud. The difference from larceny by trick is the transfer not simply of possession
but of the title, actual ownership. The permanence of the transfer is key. In larceny by
trick, money or property is borrowed, leased, or otherwise temporarily in the posses-
sion of the defendant. False pretenses, however, involve a sale or otherwise perma-
nent transfer of title to property or payment of money. Conviction for false pretenses
was affirmed in State v. Jones (Utah 1982) against the representative of a company
claiming to be a developer and marketer of inventions, when its only real function
was to collect thousands of dollars from hopeful inventors. See Exhibit 5–1 for a com-
parison of possession issues.
2.
False Representation of Fact
The representation of fact may be in words or in actions. A defendant’s offering an
ATM card for payment at a supermarket was a representation that the card was valid,
even though it was not [People v. Whight (Cal. App. 1995)]. Hiding facts may be an al-
ternate element in this crime, but mere silence is not sufficient.
Although traditional statutes limit the element of false representation to past or
present fact, modern consolidated theft statutes may include false promises (future
intentions). People who are unable to pay bills as promised lack fraudulent intent
and are not culpable under these laws. Statements of value can constitute false pre-
tenses, particularly when they are made by someone who is knowledgeable, such as
a stockbroker who said certain stock was almost worthless so he could buy it from
the owner for much less than its true value [State v. Nash (Kan. 1922)]. “Puffing” in
advertising (“you won’t find a better car on the market”) is not taken literally by most
shoppers, however.
3.
Reliance
Causation is an important factor in false pretenses. The misrepresentation must be
the cause of the transfer of title to the property or money. If the victim passes title to
the defendant even though the victim knows the defendant is lying, does not believe
the lies, or would have made the transaction regardless of the lies, then the defendant
is not guilty of false pretenses. In these cases, however, the defendant is guilty of at-
tempted false pretenses.1

In People v. Whight, when the defendant presented the invalid ATM card, the
cashier tried to check it through a computer system but received no response. The
cashier’s reliance on the defendant’s representation of the card as valid was the key
element of the crime. If the computer had reported the card as valid and the cashier
had relied on that report, the crime would not have been complete.
A fraudulent credit card transaction involves the reliance of the seller on a mis-
representation by the user of the card. It is the issuer of the card, however, who suf-
fers the loss, so this type of fraud may slip through the cracks of false pretense laws.
Some states have passed specific credit card statutes to fill the gap. The federal credit
card fraud statute is 18 U.S.C.A. § 1029.
4.
Mens Rea
The false pretenses offender knowingly misrepresents fact, or at least “creates the
impression that he believes something to be true when in fact he has no belief on the
subject. . . .”2 An honest and reasonable belief in their claim that the electronic ma-
chine they sold would cure almost any illness was a sufficient defense to reverse the
defendants’ false pretenses conviction in People v. Marsh (Cal. 1962). Besides know-
ingly making a false representation, the offender must also intend to defraud; that is,
intend for the victim to rely on the misrepresentation to pass title to property or
money to which the offender has no right. The defendant’s transfer of funds from an
elderly couple to his own accounts and to third-party borrowers resulted in a fraud
conviction, affirmed in U.S. v. Janusz (10th Cir. 1998). Because the transfers were un-
der the guise of estate planning, the defendant claimed a good faith intent, but his for-
gery of signatures indicated an intent to deceive.
5.
Federal Fraud Crimes
Federal fraud and false statement crimes are enumerated in 18 U.S.C.A. §§ 1001 to
1035. These statutes include fraudulent bank entries and transactions (§ 1005), fraud
in connection with access devices such as credit cards (§ 1029), fraud in connection
with computers (§ 1030), and other fraudulent transactions with federal agencies.
Fraudulent use of credit cards in interstate commerce is covered under 15 U.S.C.A.
§ 1644, and defrauding a bank under 18 U.S.C.A. § 1344.
False impersonation as a citizen or United States officer to claim citizenship, ob-
tain anything of value, or make an arrest or search is prohibited in 18 U.S.C.A. §§ 911
to 917. Fraudulent securities exchanges are prohibited in 15 U.S.C.A. § 78. Federal
statutes also prohibit false claims (18 U.S.C.A. §§ 287 to 289), bankruptcy fraud (18
U.S.C.A. § 152), and tax fraud (26 U.S.C.A. §§ 7201 to 7217). The Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002 broadens the scope and increases penalties for corporate fraud (18 U.S.C.A.
§§ 1348 to 1350).
Mail fraud is covered in 18 U.S.C.A. §§ 1341 to 1347. These statutes prohibit use
of the United States Postal Service; any interstate carrier; or wire, radio, or television
transmission across state lines to send fraudulent communications. Under these laws,
simply sending the communication with the intent to defraud is sufficient; the com-
munication does not need to be relied on, or even to reach its target.
Defendants who used false statements in an application for a state license to op-
erate video poker machines could not be convicted of federal mail fraud, because the
object of mail fraud must be property. The license was not deemed to be such “prop-
erty,” but rather a state regulatory issue, in the Supreme Court decision of Cleveland
v. U.S. (2000). An employee who used a computer to transmit copyrighted files con-
taining confidential source code, however, deprived the owner of the value of intan-
gible intellectual property and deprived the employer of the honest services of an
employee, so the motion to dismiss his indictment on fraudulent communications
charges was denied [U.S. v. Wang (D. Colo. 1995)].

CHAPTER 5
E.
BAD CHECKS
The use of bad checks presents difficulties in establishing the elements of false pre-
tenses, so it has become the subject of separate statutes with lesser penalties. These
statutes vary from state to state. Most do not require that the transaction be completed
with the offender receiving something of value. Some require an intent to defraud,
but most require only the knowledge that there are insufficient funds to cover the
check. Knowledge is shown when the bank refuses payment and the offender fails to
make the check good within ten days of notice. A defendant who wrote twenty-two
checks within seventeen days knowing there were no funds in the account and mak-
ing no effort to make offsetting deposits was convicted on all but one count. One of
the checks was postdated, so his conviction on that count was reversed because it did
not misrepresent a present fact. Postdated checks are not payable until the stated date
[U.S. v. Aguilar (5th Cir. 1992)]. Insufficient funds checks account for by far the great-
est number of bad checks; no-account checks make up a small percentage; and for-
geries are even less prevalent.3
F.
RECEIVING STOLEN PROPERTY
The crime of receiving stolen property consists of knowingly or intentionally receiv-
ing, retaining, or disposing of property of another that has been the subject of theft. A
defendant cannot be convicted of both stealing and receiving the same property. Ade-
fendant convicted of larceny and possession of the same, large amount of stolen cig-
arettes had the possession conviction vacated on appeal [State v. Owens (N.C. App.
2003)]. Penalties for receiving are often as severe as for the larceny itself.
The receiver must assume control of the property from the thief for at least a short
time. Evidence that a defendant placed his hands on a car knowing it was stolen and
knowing the driver, and having intent “to drive around in it,” was not enough to es-
tablish that he had exercised control over the stolen car, so he was allowed to with-
draw his guilty plea [State v. McCoy (N.J. 1989)]. The case was remanded for trial on a
possible attempt charge. The offender need not actually possess the property; buying
and selling without touching is enough. Under some statutes, the receiver must ben-
efit from the theft either financially or by use of the property.
Knowledge that the goods are stolen is often inferred from circumstances such as
the furtiveness of the seller, unusually low price of the goods, or known character of
the seller. A defendant arrested for attempted auto theft physically resisted a search
that revealed a stolen wallet in his boot, enough to show that he knew the wallet was
stolen [Gibson v. State (Ind. 1994)].
Stolen goods statutes are aimed at large-scale fencing operations, so in the case of
likely fences such as pawn shops or secondhand dealers, negligence or recklessness
may be enough to convict. Intent to deprive the owner is also part of the mens rea, so
those who acquire stolen goods with the intent to return them to their rightful owner,
such as police, are not guilty of receiving stolen goods.
G.
FORGERY AND UTTERING A FORGED INSTRUMENT
Forgery and uttering, or issuing, a forged instrument are both felonies, usually re-
gardless of the value, because they damage confidence in commercial and legal doc-
uments. Both the individual property owner and society are harmed. Forgery and
uttering are completely separate crimes, so one who forges a document and then
passes it into circulation is guilty of two separate felonies.
Making a false document or altering an authentic one is the actus reus of for-
gery. It is, essentially, false pretenses with regard to documents. In most jurisdic-
tions, the document must have legal significance. Some statutes list included
documents, and others refer to “any writing having legal efficacy.” The Model Pe-

Crimes Against Property, Public Order and Safety, Public Morals, and Justice and Public Administration
■145
nal Code § 224, concerned with the theft of reputation as well as of property, broad-
ens the definition to “symbols of value, right, privilege, or identification,” which
could include physicians’ prescriptions, tokens, badges, diplomas, and so forth.
Computer records pose another problem. In People v. Avila (Colo. App. 1988), the
forgery conviction of a defendant who had deleted drivers’ records from a state
agency computer disk was upheld.
Changes must be to a material part of a document to constitute forgery. Cases
vary about whether changing the amount on a check is forgery rather than false pre-
tenses. Most often, if only the numbers and not the written amount is altered, the of-
fense is not forgery. Signing the name of another to a check without authorization or
writing a check on a nonexistent account is forgery.
The mens rea of forgery is the specific intent to defraud with the forged in-
strument, that is, acquire property or some other advantage, usually shown by cir-
cumstances. It is not necessary that the forger succeed in this aim; the crime is
complete with the falsification of the document and the presence of intent. A pa-
role officer who married a prison inmate, then forged a removal order with the in-
tent to help him escape prison had her conviction affirmed in People v.
Gaul-Alexander (Cal. App. 1995). The forgery was against the right of the state
rather than for financial gain.
Uttering is passing or attempting to pass false documents on to others with intent
to defraud. The offender may or may not be the one who falsified the document.
Federal obligations or securities such as currency and other financial and owner-
ship documents including electronic fund transfers, stamps, and public records are
protected from counterfeiting, forgery, and uttering under 18 U.S.C.A. §§ 470 to 514.
H.
ROBBERY
Robbery includes all the elements of larceny—taking and carrying away the property
of another with the intent to permanently deprive the other of ownership—with the
addition of two more elements. Property must be taken from the person of the victim
or in the victim’s presence, and force or threat of immediate force must be used in the
taking. These elements add a degree of danger to the victim that other theft crimes
(except extortion, to be discussed next) do not have, so robbery is universally pun-
ished more severely than other kinds of theft. Some states have the intermediate of-
fense of larceny from the person, including the area immediately under the person’s
control or presence, which does not have the element of force.
Because of the physical violence involved in the robbery of different items over
the space of about fifty feet and time of less than a minute, the defendant’s conviction
of two separate offenses was affirmed in Washington v. State (Del. 2003). A gun aimed
at the victim’s head and the directed attack of a pit bull dog were used. The time be-
tween the takings indicated a separately formed intent for each of them.
Instead of grading on the basis of the value of goods stolen as in other theft of-
fenses, robbery is graded on the amount of force used. Most serious is the use of
deadly weapons or what appears to be deadly weapons, or severe injury to a vic-
tim. Presence of accomplices, even slight injury, or simply displaying a weapon
might fall in the middle ground, whereas an unarmed attack or threat is considered
least serious. The vulnerability of the victim may also be considered in the grading
scheme, with robbery against the elderly or persons with disabilities punished more
severely.
Any force greater than the effort used in taking and carrying away the property
qualifies for robbery. The robbery conviction of a purse snatcher who had broken the
strap of the purse without putting the victim in danger was upheld in People v. Middle-
ton (N.Y. Sup. 1991). As in assault, the use of a deadly weapon is an aggravating factor.
The definition of deadly weapon is broad. A plate glass window sufficed when the rob-
ber spun the victim into it in the course of a purse snatching [People v. Coe (N.Y. App.

146
■
CHAPTER 5
Divs. 1990)], and a glass soft drink bottle used in the robbery of a cab driver was con-
sidered capable of causing death or serious injury [Enriquez v. State (Tex. App. 1992)].
The force or threat need not be against the possessor of the property, but can be
against another person present. Although force may be minimal, a threat must be of
severe consequence, death or great bodily harm, and usually has to instill such fear
or apprehension in victims that they actually give up the property. State v. Birch (Iowa
1991) allowed a robbery conviction to stand only on proof of the defendant’s intent to
commit theft with a threat to the victim’s life. The victim was not in fear and, in fact,
had challenged the defendant to produce the gun he claimed to have, which was non-
existent. A defendant shouting, “Stop or I will shoot,” sufficed for an aggravated rob-
bery conviction in Lowe v. State (Ark. App. 1991). There is some difference among
jurisdictions concerning whether the fear produced by the threat should be reason-
able, or the actual fear felt by the victim even though that fear might be exaggerated
by a particular sensitivity.
Statutes and cases are divided as to when the force must occur during the course
of the robbery. Some require it to be before or contemporaneous with the taking,
whereas force after the fact is treated as a separate assault. Others allow force occurring
during immediate flight from the scene of larceny to constitute robbery. A defendant
who stole a coin-filled container from a slot machine player was convicted of robbery
because of his collisions with other casino patrons as he tried to escape [State v. Sewell
(N.J. 1992)]. State v. Lewis (N.M. App. 1993), at the end of this section, clarifies the issue
of the relationship necessary between the force and the theft to become robbery.
The claim of right to property targeted by robbery is increasingly being rejected as
a valid defense. A defendant who tried to collect money he had left with the victim be-
fore the victim was scheduled to leave the country used threats and eventually shot and
killed the victim. In affirming his robbery conviction, the court in State v. Mejia (N.J.
1995) stated that the claim of right is “utterly incompatible with and has no place in any
ordered and orderly society such as ours, which eschews self-help through violence.”
Robbery of federally chartered or insured banks is prohibited under 18 U.S.C.A.
§ 2113. The use of a victim’s credit card in an automated teller machine, however, was
not bank robbery according to the decision in Clay v. Commonwealth (Va. App. 1992).
Can you reason why? By using threat against the victim, who had constructive posses-
sion of the money in the account, the robber took the money from her presence, so she
and not the bank was the victim of robbery. Robbery of United States property, money,
or mail matter is prohibited by 18 U.S.C.A. §§ 2112 and 2114. The HobbsAct, 18 U.S.C.A.
§ 1951, establishes the crime of obstructing interstate commerce by robbery or extortion.
In the early 1990s an outbreak of automobile robberies from motorists on the street
gave rise to the federal Anti-Car Theft Act of 1992, 18 U.S.C.A. § 2119, and correspon-
ding state laws. The crime of carjacking prohibits taking of a motor vehicle from an-
other person by the use of force, violence, or intimidation with intent to cause death or
serious bodily harm. Penalties are much more severe than those for simple auto theft.
The federal statute survived a constitutionality challenge in U.S. v. Cobb (4th Cir. 1998).

867 P.2d 1231 N.M. App. 1993
[Citations omitted]
OPINION
BLACK, JUDGE
Defendant appeals from convictions of armed robbery and
conspiracy to commit armed robbery. . . .
FACTS
The robbery victim testified that he was visiting Albuquerque
to conduct business, visit friends, and see his former girl-
friend. During his visit to the city, the victim met a prostitute
who agreed to have sex with him. The victim and prostitute
arranged to meet in a specific motel room. The victim de-
scribed the motel room as having a front room that was con-
nected to a back bedroom. There was a light on in the front
room, and some of that light came into the back bedroom.
The prostitute instructed the victim to remove his cloth-
ing. The victim did so and laid his clothing on a chair in the
front room and then folded his coat and placed it over his
clothing.The victim testified that he had between $1500 and
$1600 in his coat pocket, and that, when he laid his coat
over his clothing, he did so in a manner such that he would
recognize if anyone had moved it.
The victim and prostitute proceeded to the back bedroom
where they engaged in sexual intercourse. While so en-
gaged, the victim heard noises that the prostitute said were
probably the neighbors. After intercourse, the prostitute
went into the front room and the victim lay in bed for a few
minutes.When he got up and went into the front room to get
dressed, the victim noticed that his coat was not in the same
position as he had left it. With his back to the prostitute, the
victim looked into his wallet and noticed that his money was
missing.When he turned around, the prostitute was pointing
a gun at him.
The victim testified that at that point a man came out from
the back bedroom and the prostitute handed the gun to the
man. The couple then ordered the victim out of the motel
room, but the victim demanded the return of his money.The
three left the room, and, as the couple entered a vehicle, the
victim grabbed hold of the vehicle and continued to demand
the return of his money. The victim held onto the car as the
couple, driving erratically to try to shake the victim loose, left
the scene. The victim finally jumped from the car and even-
tually located a police officer to whom he gave an account
of the incident as well as a description of the man.
ISSUE
Defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his
motion for a directed verdict because the evidence was in-
sufficient to convict him of armed robbery. In analyzing suf-
ficiency of the evidence issues, the inquiry is whether
substantial evidence exists to support a verdict of guilty be-
yond a reasonable doubt with respect to each essential el-
ement of a crime charged. Specifically, defendant argues
that the evidence revealed that the money was taken from
the victim by stealth when the victim was not present, and
that the only alleged use of force was during the escape.De-
fendant argues robbery can be committed only when force
or intimidation is used as the method of requiring the victim
to relinquish his property.
A review of the facts of this case reveals that the victim’s
property was removed from his clothing either during the time
when he was engaging in sex or immediately thereafter when
he was lying in bed. Therefore, the money already had been
taken when the victim noticed it was missing.When the victim
turned to confront the prostitute about the missing money, she
was pointing a gun at him and only then did Defendant enter
the room. These facts present the Court with the question of
whether Defendant’s forceful and intimidating actions with the
gun, after the victim’s money had already been taken through
the use of stealth, are sufficient to sustain a robbery convic-
tion.In other words, the question we are faced with is whether
the use, or threatened use, of force must necessarily be con-
current with the taking of the property from the victim.
DISCUSSION
The use of force, violence, or intimidation is an essential el-
ement of robbery. Historically, the difference between lar-
ceny and robbery has turned on whether and when force
was used. Blackstone said, “if one privately steals sixpence
from the person of another, and afterwards keeps it by put-
ting him in fear, this is no robbery, for the fear is subsequent
. . .” 4 William Blackstone, Commentaries 242.
In New Mexico, “[r]obbery consists of the theft of anything
of value from the person of another or from the immediate
control of another, by use or threatened use of force or vio-
lence.” NMSA 1978, § 30-16-2 (Repl. Pamp. 1984). New
Mexico case law makes it clear that, in order to convict for
such an offense, the use or threatened use of force must be

148
■
CHAPTER 5
the factor by which the property is removed from the victim’s
possession. . . .
Under the facts of the present case, the victim’s money
was removed and separated from his person by stealth. De-
fendant clearly had control over the victim’s money once it
had been taken from his clothing. Defendant’s use of a
weapon only after the money was separated from the victim
was merely an action to hold victim at bay as he escaped
from the motel. For that action, it appears that defendant
could have been charged with aggravated assault.However,
. . . the use of force to retain property or to facilitate escape
does not satisfy the force element necessary for the crime
of robbery. Thus, there was insufficient evidence to support
Defendant’s conviction for armed robbery.
It is true, as the State argues, that other jurisdictions
have interpreted different statutory language to sustain rob-
bery convictions when the force is used after the removal of
the property. The cases diverge based largely on the rele-
vant statutory language defining robbery. Indeed, some of
these jurisdictions have statutes which specifically define
robbery to include the use of force to retain property imme-
diately after it has been taken.The Model Penal Code takes
this approach by defining robbery to include any violence or
fear threatened or inflicted during an attempt or commission
of a theft or in flight after an attempt or commission of theft.
Thus, while it may be true that “modern code” sections
define robbery to allow any use of force during or after a tak-
ing of the property, it is up to the legislature, not the courts,
to revise the statutory definition of robbery. . . .
We do recognize, however, that some jurisdictions have
interpreted robbery statutes similar to our own to encom-
pass situations where force is used to retain property im-
mediately after its nonviolent taking. . . . Regardless of
whether robbery is a continuing offense, New Mexico case
law clearly holds that force must be the lever by which prop-
erty is separated from the victim, and thus the use of force
subsequent to that separation is not sufficient.
CONCLUSION
Based on the above, we hold that the trial court erred in
denying Defendant’s motion for a directed verdict. Accord-
ingly, we reverse.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
I.
EXTORTION
Like robbery, extortion or blackmail is a form of larceny that puts the victim in danger
of harm. There is no present force in extortion, however, and the threat is of future harm
rather than immediate harm.Also, the taking of property need not be from the presence
of the victim. The common law offense dealt only with public officials who used their
influence to force others to pay illegal fees, but the statutory offense includes anyone
who intentionally and wrongfully obtains money or property as a result of the threats.
A county commissioner received payment from an undercover FBI agent posing as a
real estate developer seeking rezoning of a tract of land. Even though the commissioner
had not demanded the payment, his extortion occurred “under color of official right,”
and his conviction was affirmed under the Hobbs Act [Evans v. U.S. (1992)].
The harm threatened may be to someone other than the possessor of the property,
and does not have to be physical injury. Threatened property damage or even expo-
sure to shame or ridicule, even if the information disclosed is the truth, is enough. A
man who had been participating in a criminal investigation against a person who had
been making harassing phone calls to him, called that person and offered to refrain
from pressing criminal charges in return for payment of money. His belief that he was
entitled to the money and that the victim was guilty was no defense, and his convic-
tion for extortion was affirmed in State v. Greenspan (N.C. App. 1989). An attorney
who arranged an international adoption then demanded more money that he claimed
would keep the birth mother from kidnapping the child was convicted of extortion
[U.S. v. Nishnianidze (1st Cir. 2003)].
Some jurisdictions require that money or property actually be obtained by the of-
fender’s threat for extortion to be complete. In others, the crime is complete when the
threat is delivered with intent to carry it out. Some require that the victim actually be
put in fear; others only that the offender have the intent to create fear and issue threats
that would instill fear in a reasonable person, whether or not the victim is really
frightened. The claim of right is recognized in some jurisdictions as a defense to ex-
tortion, but others consider threat an inappropriate way to collect debts.

How does a newspaper article revealing embarrassing facts about a
political candidate differ from extortion?
Sending extortion threats through the mail is a federal offense under 18 U.S.C.A.
§§ 871 to 880. Sections 891 to 896 deal with extortionate credit transactions. The Hobbs

CONSOLIDATED THEFT
Modern statutes often consolidate an assortment of common law theft crimes under
one umbrella statute that avoids the sorting out of custody and possession, types of
property and services subject to the crime, and time lines of intent. Robbery, forgery,
and bad checks are always separate. Some states keep extortion and some false pre-
tenses offenses separate.

CHAPTER 5
Consolidated statutes often use more general language, “obtains” instead of
“takes and carries away,” for example, and accommodations are made for new means
of access, products, and services that emerge from the technology explosion. Where
theft is consolidated, a bill of particulars usually gives notice of specific charges to the
defendant. The Model Penal Code consolidates theft in § 223. The federal compre-
hensive theft statute is 18 U.S.C.A. § 641. Knowledge of federal ownership is not an
element. More than half the states have consolidated theft statutes.

bad check offenses.

CALOGERO, JUSTICE
On March 19, 1984, defendant John A. Langford was con-
victed of theft in excess of $500.00 from the Hibernia Na-
tional Bank of New Orleans. He was sentenced to eight
years’ imprisonment at hard labor. The Court of Appeal af-
firmed. We granted writs to consider whether there was
adequate proof of a non-consensual taking and/or a per-
manent intent to deprive the bank of its funds.
FACTS
On March 11, 1981, defendant met with a vice president
in charge of lending at Hibernia to discuss borrowing
$225,000 to purchase a Metairie restaurant. Two days later
the vice president personally informed defendant that the
loan was refused, primarily because of defendant’s poor
credit record. Within a week, defendant returned to the
same branch of the Hibernia to open an interest-bearing
checking account, known as a NOW account (negotiable or-
ders of withdrawal). . . . Defendant exhibited a Louisiana dri-
ver’s license, listed his place of employment as a company
known as Furniture Distributors and deposited $5,362.21 to
open the account. He neither inquired about nor requested
overdraft privileges; nor was he told that he would be af-
forded any such privilege.
NOW checking accounts were an innovation for Hibernia.
Prior to January, 1981, federal regulations did not permit
banking institutions to pay interest on checking accounts.
With the change in the regulations, Hibernia joined other
area banks in offering interest-bearing checking accounts to
their customers.To accomplish this, it was necessary for the
bank to purchase, install and modify a computer program
within a very short period of time. . . .
[T]he computer program came with a set of Out of Bal-
ance Processing Codes (OBPs), which instructed the com-
puter on routing and check payment information. . . . Code
“01” instructed the computer to honor the check, regardless
of the amount, at no charge to the customer. In other words,
an “01” code gave the customer unlimited overdraft privi-
leges. The coding was an internal matter; individual cus-
tomers would not be aware, by scrutiny of account numbers
or statements, whether their accounts had been assigned to
the “01,” “03” or “05” codes. . . .
A former customer service representative at Hibernia’s
main branch testified that she placed checking account in-
formation into the computer during March of 1981. Unaware
of the significance or meaning of the codes, and pursuant to
instructions received from another employee, she used an
“01” code on all new accounts. As a result, eighty-four main
office checking accounts received the “01” OBP designa-
tion. The error was compounded when the bank’s monitor-
ing controls failed, notably the routing and handling of Daily
and Monthly Overdraft Reports. An “01” coding indicated to
the bookkeeping department that any overdraft had already
been approved by an account officer. Meanwhile, the Over-
draft Reports were not being delivered to the account offi-
cers but, instead, were being discarded. The officers,
however, had not been told to expect the Reports and, in the
absence of inquiries from bookkeeping, had no idea of the
status of “01” accounts assigned to them.
Defendant began using his NOW account. After the ini-
tial deposit of $5,362.21 on March 18, 1981, defendant
made no further deposits. Within two weeks, the account
was overdrawn.
Defendant continued writing checks, however. He also
began receiving overdraft notices from the bank. According

Crimes Against Property, Public Order and Safety, Public Morals, and Justice and Public Administration
■151
to testimony of Hibernia officials, an overdraft notice is a
computer-generated form sent one per check, “whenever
there [is] activity that over[draws] the account....” Such a no-
tice did not mean that an account had been reviewed by a
bank employee. In defendant’s case, these notices were
sent daily. By the end of September, 1981 or within about
195 days, 198 such overdraft notices were sent to the de-
fendant, each of them reflecting the amount of a given hon-
ored but NSF check, and a correspondingly increased
negative, or overdraft, balance. Bank officials conceded the
notices did not contain “specific wording . . .” telling cus-
tomers to come in and make a deposit but, as one witness
put it, “[t]here are some things that are understood.” In ever-
increasing amounts over the six-and-one-half month period,
defendant continued writing checks.The first of his overdraft
notices showed a negative balance of $237.79; the 198th
and last, $848,904.39.
Finally, on the afternoon of September 23, 1981, the
bank received a call from a curious teller at Fidelity Home-
stead. Defendant was attempting to obtain a certificate of
deposit with a large check drawn on his Hibernia NOW ac-
count. In a routine check of his account balance, officials
learned that defendant was overdrawn by $848,904.39. . . .
The following day defendant and his attorney met with
bank officials. Hibernia’s general counsel served written de-
mand for immediate payment of the entire sum. Defendant,
and his lawyer, countered with an offer to repay the balance
over a five year period, at 8% interest, with interest pay-
ments monthly and principal payments annually. Hibernia
declined defendant’s offer and began civil proceedings in
several parishes within the state in an attempt to recover the
funds. . . . The defendant was thereafter charged with theft.
At his trial the facts recited above were proven. . . .
After a bench trial, the judge found the defendant guilty
as charged of theft in excess of $500.00, and sentenced him
to imprisonment for eight years with the Department of Cor-
rections, with credit for time served.
. . .
ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 1
As already noted defendant contends that there was insuffi-
cient evidence to prove that the taking was non-consensual.
The state, of course, had the burden of proving that the tak-
ing of the money was without the consent of Hibernia. First of
all, there was a taking. At the least that taking occurred after
the NSF checks were honored and the money came into de-
fendant’s possession (if that was by virtue of a mistake rather
than consent on the bank’s part), when defendant diverted or
used the funds, instead of returning them.With respect to the
bank’s non-consent the Court of Appeal found that “[t]he evi-
dence absolutely precludes the possibility that the bank con-
sented to defendant’s conduct. The bank was a victim of it’s
own mistakes, one in the erroneous coding of the account
when it was first opened, and the other in the destruction of
the computer printouts before they could be reviewed by a re-
sponsible official. The bank’s intention was to allow no over-
drafts on NOW accounts but this was frustrated by its unfor-
tunate errors. That the bank consented to the defendant’s
taking $848,000 as some sort of loan is not a reasonable hy-
pothesis when its refusal to loan defendant $225,000 one
week before the account was opened is considered.”
With this assessment by the Court of Appeal we agree.
The evidence overwhelmingly supports the fact that no hu-
man person with the bank ever made a conscious decision
to honor defendant’s checks notwithstanding the account’s
overdraft status. Equally supported, and bearing on the as-
pect of the taking, is the conclusion that the defendant had
to have known a mistake was being made.
. . .
Defendant’s argument that the record also supports the
opposite conclusion, i.e., that the repeated honoring of the
checks by the bank could be reasonably interpreted as con-
sent to loan the money to the defendant, is not persuasive....
The facts established by the direct evidence and inferred
from the circumstantial evidence were sufficient for a ra-
tional trier of fact to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt
that defendant was guilty of the essential element of the
crime of theft that the taking was non-consensual.
Defendant’s first assignment is without merit.
ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 2
By his second assignment of error, defendant contends that
the state failed to prove that he intended to deprive the bank
permanently of its money. . . .
The most favorable aspect of this case from defendant’s
perspective, concerning proof of intent to permanently de-
prive, is the manner in which defendant came by the bank’s
money. Because his NSF checks in ever increasing
amounts were routinely being honored, and were simply
prompting increasing negative balance overdraft notices (al-
beit up to $848,000), any reasonable person would assume
that sooner or later the mistake would be discovered and the
bank would call for repayment. . . . Furthermore, the evi-
dence which the prosecution chose to present at trial does
not show any apparent effort on defendant’s part to hide the
greater part of the money.
On the other hand there was significant evidence that de-
fendant intended to deprive the bank permanently of its
money upon receipt, or at least some of it, for in addition to
his not giving any of the money back, he spent at least
$12,000 on items in the nature of support and disbursed
$113,000 in large checks to various payees other than fi-
nancial institutions. The greater part of the money,
$724,000, comprised checks made payable to homesteads
and apparently deposited into accounts, possibly in defen-
dant’s name, in the respective homesteads. The record
does not show what happened to any of the money there-
after. When called upon to repay, defendant was unable, or
unwilling, to do so. Rather on defendant’s behalf the attor-
ney offered defendant’s promissory note.

CHAPTER 5
One who takes another’s property intending only to use
it temporarily before restoring it unconditionally to its owner
(i.e., one who normally is found not to have an intent to
steal) may nevertheless be guilty of larceny if he later
changes his mind and decides not to return the property
after all. . . .
The facts established by the direct evidence and inferred
from the circumstantial evidence was sufficient for a rational
trier of fact to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that de-
fendant was guilty of the essential element of the crime of
theft, that the defendant intended to deprive the bank per-
manently of more than $500.
DECREE
Defendant’s conviction of theft in excess of $500 and his
sentence to eight years imprisonment in the custody of the
Department of Corrections are affirmed.
AFFIRMED.

CYBERCRIMES
1.
The Computer Crime Problem
A 2003 Computer Security Institute survey indicated that computer crime financial
losses were down for the first time since 1999 among the companies, government
agencies, and institutions surveyed, but the numbers of computer-based crimes and
abuses remained high. Fifty-six percent of respondents reported unauthorized use of
their computer systems in the past year, and 82 percent reported virus attacks.4
It is not surprising that criminals have taken to computers as a new avenue of crime.
Access is inexpensive, hard to trace, and, as the numbers demonstrate, very productive.
Cybercrime also presents particular problems for prosecutors. Identification of offend-
ers and the search of computer memory present evidentiary problems, and the world-
wide scope of the Internet presents jurisdiction problems. Where has the crime occurred
if the offender is in one state or country, the victim is in another, and the Internet serv-
ice provider is in yet another? Free speech rights and access restrictions are complicated
by the impossibility of determining whether a computer operator is a child or an adult.
Nevertheless, legislatures are beginning to close the gaps with new statutes. Be-
cause cybercrime is an area of ongoing change, continue to check statutes carefully as
they affect computers as targets, as tools, and as incidental factors in crime.
2.
Computers as Targets
Information stored in computers and the integrity of the computer itself are targets of
some cybercrimes. Federal statute 18 U.S.C.A. § 1030 criminalizes merely accessing
restricted computer information. In 1999 Virginia was the first state to criminalize the
malicious flooding of an e-mail address with unwanted mail (“spamming”). The 2004
federal CAN-SPAM Act (18 U.S.C.A. § 1037) targets multiple, commercial e-mail
transmissions with the intent to deceive or mislead recipients. Penalties are fines up
to $2 million and prison terms up to five years. Check your state’s anti-spam laws.
Vandalizing Web sites and introducing viruses are also computer-damaging crimes.
3.
Computers as Tools
Computers are an efficient tool in the commission of a variety of traditional crimes.
Telemarketing scams, transmission of child pornography, illegal electronic money
transfers, and Internet gambling are just some of the old crimes that have entered the
technological age.
A conviction for computer trespass was affirmed against a defendant who used a
home computer to repeatedly dial a telephone company’s general access number and
enter random six-digit numbers to try to discover customer access codes [State v. Ri-
ley (Wash. 1993)]. Defendants hacked into a telephone switch to ensure that their calls
to a radio station would be in the proper sequence to win promotional giveaways of
two Porsche cars, $30,000, and two trips to Hawaii. Conviction for computer fraud vi-
olation of 18 U.S.C.A. § 1030 was affirmed in U.S. v. Peterson (9th Cir. 1996).

Computers Incidental to Crimes
A drug dealer’s records, a prostitute’s list of customers, an accountant’s calculations,
and other types of information that might be stored in computer memory banks can
be important evidence in criminal investigations. Because access to this information
differs from that on sheets of paper, there are special considerations in search and
seizure. Chapter 9 discusses some of these problems.
5.
No Electronic Theft (NET) Act
The No Electronic Theft Act passed in 1997 tightened United States copyright and
trademark laws to target cybertheft of intellectual property. The NET Act is aimed at
large-scale reproduction and distribution of copyrighted works through electronic as
well as tangible means, because the Internet makes these procedures so easy. Statutes
that were changed by the NET Act include 17 U.S.C.A. §§ 101, 506, and 507 and 18
U.S.C.A. §§ 2319, 2319A, and 2320.
U.S. v. LaMacchia (D. Mass. 1994) exposed the need for laws covering theft of
copyrighted material where no discernible profit resulted from the theft. LaMacchia’s
charge of wire fraud for conspiring to use a computer bulletin board to copy copy-
righted software was dismissed because copyrights were not covered by wire fraud,
and copyright law did not cover crimes lacking a monetary motive. In 1999 the first
conviction of the NET Act demonstrated that the gap had been closed.
In 2002 “Operation Buccaneer” led to a series of felony convictions for the in-
ternational Internet pirating of copyrighted software, movies, and music. The
seized “warez” (pronounced “wears”), illegally distributed material, were valued at

in twenty-seven states and ten countries in a similar search of suspected copyright
pirates.6
6.
Identity Theft
Theft of credit card and Social Security numbers and other personal identification
documents is one of the fastest growing crimes in the country. In the past five years,
12.7 percent or 27 million Americans have been the victims of identity theft.7 Perpe-
trators obtain information from garbage and mailboxes or hack into computer data-
bases, and victims suffer monetary loss, credit damage, and invasion of privacy.
The federal Identity Theft Act of 1998 (18 U.S.C.A. § 1028) criminalizes produc-
ing, transferring, or possessing identity documents knowingly and without lawful
authority. The Federal Trade Commission is a clearinghouse for ID theft complaints,
information, and referrals to consumer reporting and law enforcement agencies. State
identity theft statutes are listed on the FTC Web site.

WHITE-COLLAR CRIME
1.
Introduction
White-collar crime is a catch-all that bundles together the crimes associated with
white-collar workers and businesses, the nonviolent crimes that usually have finan-
cial or regulation avoidance motives. Corporate crimes, embezzlement, extortion,
computer crimes, and fraud are classic white-collar crimes that have already been dis-
cussed. Although violent crime statistics are decreasing, white-collar crime is rapidly
increasing as violations previously handled in civil actions incur criminal sanctions
and new forms of fraudulent crimes grow out of the explosion of business and com-
munication networks, the technology that supports them, and the ensuing regula-
tions. New statutes have been created to cover some new criminal methods, and old
statutes have been stretched to fit others. For example, a conviction for unauthorized
descrambling of satellite television signals was allowed under the federal wiretap
law, 18 U.S.C.A. § 2511(1)(a), in U.S. v. Davis (8th Cir. 1992).
2.
Health Care Fraud
Health care fraud costs the government and private insurers $95 billion a year. In
2002, federal health care fraud prosecutions resulted in 480 convictions, including
the following cases. A pharmaceutical manufacturer pled guilty to conspiracy to vi-
olate the Prescription Drug Marketing Act and paid a fine of $290 million. A Missouri
pharmacist who had diluted cancer drugs pled guilty to multiple counts of con-
sumer product tampering, drug adulteration, and drug misbranding, and was sen-
tenced to thirty years in prison, plus substantial fines and victim restitution. A
business manager of a medical center was sentenced to twenty-one years in prison
and payment of $1.9 million in restitution for billing insurance companies for stan-
dard chemotherapy for cancer patients, when the treatments actually delivered were
not FDA approved.8
Health care fraud involves misrepresentations in billings to Medicare, Medicaid,
and private insurers for medical services; kickbacks for referring patients; services by
untrained personnel; distribution of unapproved drugs or devices; creation of phony
insurance companies; and other means. Besides general false claims statutes, such as
18 U.S.C.A. § 287, more specific laws recently have targeted the problem directly. The
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 strengthens criminal
prosecution of fraud through 18 U.S.C.A. §§ 1035 and 1347, and theft and embezzle-
ment in connection with health care through 18 U.S.C.A. § 669. The Civil Rights of In-
stitutionalized Persons Act also protects residents of nursing homes and mental
health and mental retardation facilities from providers who bill for inadequate care.
Fraud is expected to grow in the relatively new areas of home health and hospice care.

Trademark Infringement
Trademark infringement is a combination of unfair trade practices and counterfeiting.
The Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C.A. § 1051 et seq., extensively regulates trademarks as not
simply a form of business advertising, but a symbol of the integrity and goodwill of
the company. When such a symbol is recognized internationally, its worth to the com-
pany is enormous, so unauthorized use of trademarks can result in severe sanctions.
In 1998 a computer hardware firm that sold its products in counterfeited IBM boxes
was required to pay $1.1 million in restitution of profits from the sales and $2.2 mil-
lion in fines.9
4.
Economic Espionage
Economic espionage is the theft of trade secrets, the formulas, patterns, devices,
processes, or compilations of information that give companies an advantage over their
competitors. A trade secret must have independent economic value that derives from
the fact that it is not generally known in the industry, and the owner must take steps
to keep it secret. There are usually no restrictions on how the secret is stored or trans-
mitted. “Know-how” acquired on the job does not qualify as a trade secret, nor does
information discovered by “reverse engineering,” taking a product apart to see how it
was made. California, protective of its Silicon Valley technology companies, amended
its statute to include theft of trade secrets with only potential economic value.
Computer files containing work in progress toward a design for a freonless wa-
tercooler was not a trade secret in People v. Pribich (Cal. App. 1994), because of un-
controverted testimony by an expert witness that the proposed watercooler would
not be marketable.
Until the 1996 passage of the Economic Espionage Act, 18 U.S.C.A. §§ 1831 to 1839,
there was no federal statute criminalizing theft of trade secrets. Cases were wedged
under general fraud and transporting stolen goods statutes or handled in civil litiga-
tion. One of the first cases under the new law was U.S. v. Hsu (E.D. Pa. 1999) involv-
ing alleged attempted theft of anticancer drug secrets from Bristol-Meyers. Hsu
revealed a problem in the law that may affect future prosecutions. The law contains a
confidentiality section, but in order to prove that the information involved is a true
trade secret, that information must be examined by the defense and then the jury, and,
thus, be released to the public, which is the very thing the law was meant to prevent.
In this case, the secrets were edited from 300 pages down to ten pages for use at trial.10
A former employee of an aircraft parts manufacturer offered to sell computerized
specifications from that company to third parties and was convicted under 18
U.S.C.A. § 1839(3). The conviction was affirmed in U.S. v. Lange (7th Cir. 2002), be-
cause the information met the standards of a trade secret by being kept in a computer-
assisted secure room with limited access.
5.
Money Laundering
One who exchanges monetary instruments, knowing that they are the proceeds of
crime, for other monetary instruments or equivalent property with intent to conceal
the nature, location, source, ownership, or control of the proceeds or to promote crim-
inal conduct commits the crime of money laundering. Federal law 18 U.S.C.A. § 1956
adds the alternate elements of intentionally violating the Internal Revenue Code and
avoiding state or federal transaction reporting requirements. Money laundering laws
give prosecutors another handle in dealing with highly lucrative crimes such as ex-
tortion, gambling, and illegal drug trafficking.
A subcontractor on a $20 million hotel renovation project told the contractor that
he was a member of a crime family and would take care of labor problems on the job
for payment, then threatened the contractor with death if the payments were not con-
tinued. The subcontractor brought back the $400,000 he had received as payments in
$100 bills and demanded that the contractor issue checks in exchange for the cash. He
also used threats to force the contractor to make a $50,000 deposit in an Irish bank in
trade secrets:
formulas, patterns, devices,
processes, or compilations
of information that give com-
panies an advantage over
their competitors.

she never gained control of the funds. The court in People v. Capparelli (N.Y. Sup. 1993)
ruled that the first transaction of extorted funds was money laundering, but that the
second was incomplete and, therefore, attempted money laundering.
6.
Securities Fraud
After the stock market crash of 1929, state and federal laws providing for both civil
and criminal sanctions were passed to promote investor confidence by ensuring hon-
est markets. State “blue sky laws,” so called because they are aimed at speculative
schemes hatched from thin air, and the federal Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C.A. § 77a
et seq., require the registration of securities and criminalize making false statements
in that process. Fraud in stock exchanges and trading are criminalized by the Securi-
ties Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C.A. § 78 et seq., and the Uniform Securities Act
adopted by most states. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act created new felonies for defrauding
investors and failing to certify financial reports (18 U.S.C.A. §§ 1348 to 1350).
The use of confidential knowledge about a corporation in the purchase or sale of
stocks in that corporation is called insider trading, which violates Securities Ex-
change Act § 10(b) against misappropriation using deceptive devices in such transac-
tions. In U.S. v. O’Hagan (1997) the Supreme Court decided whether the defendant
could be convicted of a § 10(b) violation even though he was an “outsider.”

UNITED STATES v. O’HAGAN.
117 S.Ct. 2199 1997
[Citations omitted]
JUSTICE GINSBURG DELIVERED THE OPINION OF
THE COURT. . . .
I
Respondent James Herman O’Hagan was a partner in the
law firm of Dorsey & Whitney in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In
July 1988, Grand Metropolitan PLC (Grand Met), a com-
pany based in London, England, retained Dorsey & Whitney
as local counsel to represent Grand Met regarding a poten-
tial tender offer for the common stock of the Pillsbury Com-
pany, headquartered in Minneapolis. Both Grand Met and
Dorsey & Whitney took precautions to protect the confiden-
tiality of Grand Met’s tender offer plans. O’Hagan did no
work on the Grand Met representation. Dorsey & Whitney
withdrew from representing Grand Met on September 9,
1988. Less than a month later, on October 4, 1988, Grand
Met publicly announced its tender offer for Pillsbury stock.
On August 18, 1988, while Dorsey & Whitney was still
representing Grand Met, O’Hagan began purchasing call op-
tions for Pillsbury stock. Each option gave him the right to
purchase 100 shares of Pillsbury stock by a specified date in
September 1988. Later in August and in September, O’Ha-
gan made additional purchases of Pillsbury call options. By
the end of September, he owned 2,500 unexpired Pillsbury
options, apparently more than any other individual investor.
O’Hagan also purchased, in September 1988, some 5,000
shares of Pillsbury common stock, at a price just under $39
per share. When Grand Met announced its tender offer in
October, the price of Pillsbury stock rose to nearly $60 per
share. O’Hagan then sold his Pillsbury call options and com-
mon stock, making a profit of more than $4.3 million.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC or
Commission) initiated an investigation into O’Hagan’s trans-
actions, culminating in a 57-count indictment. The indict-
ment alleged that O’Hagan defrauded his law firm and its
client, Grand Met, by using for his own trading purposes ma-
terial, nonpublic information regarding Grand Met’s planned
tender offer.1 According to the indictment, O’Hagan used
1.
As evidence that O’Hagan traded on the basis of nonpublic in-
formation misappropriated from his law firm, the Government relied
on a conversation between O’Hagan and the Dorsey & Whitney
partner heading the firm’s Grand Met representation. That conver-
sation allegedly took place shortly before August 26, 1988. . . .
O’Hagan urges that the Government’s evidence does not show he
traded on the basis of nonpublic information. O’Hagan points to
news reports on August 18 and 22, 1988, that Grand Met was in-
terested in acquiring Pillsbury, and to an earlier, August 12, 1988,
news report that Grand Met had put up its hotel chain for auction to
raise funds for an acquisition. . . . O’Hagan’s challenge to the suffi-
ciency of the evidence remains open for consideration on remand.

the profits he gained through this trading to conceal his pre-
vious embezzlement and conversion of unrelated client
trust funds.2 O’Hagan was charged with 20 counts of mail
fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. § 1341; 17 counts of secu-
rities fraud, in violation of § 10(b) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), 48 Stat. 891, 15 U.S.C.A.
§ 78j(b), and SEC Rule 10b–5, 17 CFR § 240.10b–5 (1996);
17 counts of fraudulent trading in connection with a tender
offer, in violation of § 14(e) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C.A.
§ 78n(e), and SEC Rule 14e–3(a), 17 CFR § 240.14e–3(a)
(1996); and 3 counts of violating federal money laundering
statutes, 18 U.S.C.A. §§ 1956(a)(1)(B)(i), 1957. . . . A jury
convicted O’Hagan on all 57 counts, and he was sentenced
to a 41-month term of imprisonment.
A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Cir-
cuit reversed all of O’Hagan’s convictions. Liability under
10(b) and Rule 10b–5, the Eighth Circuit held, may not be
grounded on the “misappropriation theory” of securities
fraud on which the prosecution relied. . . .
II
We address first the Court of Appeals’ reversal of O’Ha-
gan’s convictions under § 10(b) and Rule 10b–5. Following
the Fourth Circuit’s lead, see United States v. Bryan 58 F.3d
933, 943–959 (1995), the Eighth Circuit rejected the mis-
appropriation theory as a basis for § 10(b) liability.We hold,
in accord with several other Courts of Appeals, that criminal
liability under 10(b) may be predicated on the misappropri-
ation theory.
A
In pertinent part, § 10(b) of the Exchange Act . . .
proscribes (1) using any deceptive device (2) in connection
with the purchase or sale of securities, in contravention of
rules prescribed by the Commission. The provision, as writ-
ten, does not confine its coverage to deception of a pur-
chaser or seller of securities; rather, the statute reaches any
deceptive device used “in connection with the purchase or
sale of any security.”
Pursuant to its § 10(b) rulemaking authority, the Com-
mission has adopted Rule 10b–5, which, as relevant here,
provides:
“It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly,
by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate
commerce, or of the mails or of any facility of any national
securities exchange,
“(a) To employ any device, scheme, or artifice to de-
fraud, [or]
. . .
“(c) To engage in any act, practice, or course of business
which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit
upon any person,
“in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.
17 CFR § 240.10b–5 (1996)
Under the “traditional” or “classical theory” of insider trad-
ing liability, § 10(b) and Rule 10b–5 are violated when a cor-
porate insider trades in the securities of his corporation on
the basis of material, nonpublic information.Trading on such
information qualifies as a “deceptive device” under § 10(b),
we have affirmed, because “a relationship of trust and con-
fidence [exists] between the shareholders of a corporation,
and those insiders who have obtained confidential informa-
tion by reason of their position with that corporation.” That
relationship, we recognized, “gives rise to a duty to disclose
[or to abstain from trading] because of the ‘necessity of pre-
venting a corporate insider from ...tak[ing] unfair advantage
of . . . uninformed . . . stockholders.’ ”The classical theory ap-
plies not only to officers, directors, and other permanent in-
siders of a corporation, but also to attorneys, accountants,
consultants, and others who temporarily become fiduciaries
of a corporation.
The “misappropriation theory” holds that a person com-
mits fraud “in connection with” a securities transaction,
and thereby violates § 10(b) and Rule 10b–5, when he
misappropriates confidential information for securities
trading purposes, in breach of a duty owed to the source
of the information. Under this theory, a fiduciary’s undis-
closed, self-serving use of a principal’s information to pur-
chase or sell securities, in breach of a duty of loyalty and
confidentiality, defrauds the principal of the exclusive use
of that information. In lieu of premising liability on a fiduci-
ary relationship between company insider and purchaser
or seller of the company’s stock, the misappropriation the-
ory premises liability on a fiduciary-turned-trader’s decep-
tion of those who entrusted him with access to confidential
information.
The two theories are complementary, each addressing
efforts to capitalize on nonpublic information through the pur-
chase or sale of securities.The classical theory targets a cor-
porate insider’s breach of duty to shareholders with whom
the insider transacts; the misappropriation theory outlaws
trading on the basis of nonpublic information by a corporate
“outsider” in breach of a duty owed not to a trading party, but
to the source of the information.The misappropriation theory
is thus designed to “protec[t] the integrity of the securities
markets against abuses by ‘outsiders’ to a corporation who
have access to confidential information that will affect th[e]
corporation’s security price when revealed, but who owe no
fiduciary or other duty to that corporation’s shareholders.”
In this case, the indictment alleged that O’Hagan, in breach
of a duty of trust and confidence he owed to his law firm,
Dorsey & Whitney, and to its client, Grand Met, traded on the
2.
O’Hagan was convicted of theft in state court, sentenced to 30
months’ imprisonment, and fined. . . . The Supreme Court of Min-
nesota disbarred O’Hagan from the practice of law.

basis of nonpublic information regarding Grand Met’s planned
tender offer for Pillsbury common stock. This conduct, the
Government charged, constituted a fraudulent device in con-
nection with the purchase and sale of securities.5
B
We agree with the Government that misappropriation, as
just defined, satisfies 10(b)’s requirement that chargeable
conduct involve a “deceptive device or contrivance” used “in
connection with” the purchase or sale of securities. We ob-
serve, first, that misappropriators, as the Government de-
scribes them, deal in deception. A fiduciary who “[pretends]
loyalty to the principal while secretly converting the princi-
pal’s information for personal gain,” “dupes” or defrauds the
principal. . . .
A company’s confidential information . . . qualifies as
property to which the company has a right of exclusive use.
The undisclosed misappropriation of such information, in
violation of a fiduciary duty. . . . constitutes fraud akin to em-
bezzlement—“the fraudulent appropriation to one’s own
use of the money or goods entrusted to one’s care by an-
other.” . . .
We turn next to the § 10(b) requirement that the misap-
propriator’s deceptive use of information be “in connection
with the purchase or sale of [a] security.” This element is sat-
isfied because the fiduciary’s fraud is consummated, not
when the fiduciary gains the confidential information, but
when, without disclosure to his principal, he uses the infor-
mation to purchase or sell securities. The securities transac-
tion and the breach of duty thus coincide. This is so even
though the person or entity defrauded is not the other party
to the trade, but is, instead, the source of the nonpublic infor-
mation. A misappropriator who trades on the basis of mate-
rial, nonpublic information, in short, gains his advantageous
market position through deception; he deceives the source of
the information and simultaneously harms members of the in-
vesting public.
The misappropriation theory targets information of a sort
that misappropriators ordinarily capitalize upon to gain no-
risk profits through the purchase or sale of securities.
Should a misappropriator put such information to other use,
the statute’s prohibition would not be implicated. . . .
The Exchange Act was enacted in part “to insure the
maintenance of fair and honest markets,” 15 U.S.C.A. § 78b,
and there is no question that fraudulent uses of confidential
information fall within § 10(b)’s prohibition if the fraud is “in
connection with” a securities transaction. . . .
The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Cir-
cuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further pro-
ceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

CRIMES AGAINST PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY
A.
INTRODUCTION
This section and the two following sections cover crimes against public order and
safety, public morals, and public administration. The goal of statutes and ordi-
nances that govern these crimes is not so much to keep people from hurting each
other, although that can also be a goal, but to build society along certain gener-
ally accepted norms. When public interest takes precedence over individual
rights and freedoms, laws may be passed that criminalize a person’s status—who
one is rather than what one has done—or that use broad or vague language that
does not give clear notice of what specific acts are prohibited and, thus, infringe
on due process. Such laws are often declared unconstitutional. As societal norms
shift, so do the laws, sometimes retrenching, sometimes accommodating the
changes, and often creating confusion as jurisdictions move in opposite direc-
tions toward consensus.

who one is rather than what
one has done.

The Government could not have prosecuted O’Hagan
under the classical theory, for O’Hagan was not an “insider”
of Pillsbury, the corporation in whose stock he traded. Al-
though an “outsider” with respect to Pillsbury, O’Hagan had
an intimate association with, and was found to have traded
on confidential information from, Dorsey & Whitney, counsel
to tender offeror Grand Met. Under the misappropriation the-
ory, O’Hagan’s securities trading does not escape Exchange
Act sanction, as it would under the dissent’s reasoning, sim-
ply because he was associated with, and gained nonpublic
information from, the bidder, rather than the target.

B.
TERRORISM
The bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995
and the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon on September 11, 2001 fo-
cused this nation’s attention on terrorism. The Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death
Penalty Act of 1996 and the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 expanded the definitions of
terrorist activity and broadened the reach of federal investigation in suspected ter-
rorist cases.
Terrorism is criminally violent or dangerous action that appears to be intended
to intimidate a civilian population, influence or coerce governmental policy or con-
duct, or retaliate against governmental conduct. International terrorism occurs out-
side the territorial jurisdiction of the United States or transcends U.S. boundaries in
the reach of intended coercion, the means of accomplishing the act, or the location of
terrorist operations or asylum. Domestic terrorism, which is confined primarily
within the United States, is a new crime created by the USA PATRIOT Act.
Federal terrorism statutes in 18 U.S.C.A. §§ 2331–2339 specify types of weapons,
targets, locales and jurisdictions, and set punishments, including the death penalty if
death results from the offense. These statutes include PATRIOT Act provisions that
prohibit financial transactions with any country designated as supporting interna-
tional terrorism, harboring or concealing terrorists, or knowingly providing material
support to terrorists or to terrorist organizations. New money laundering regulations
require banks and other financial service providers to check new customer identifi-
cation against a watch list of names and aliases of suspected terrorists and to screen
accounts for suspicious transactions.
In U.S. v. Sattar (S.D.N.Y. 2003), charges under 18 U.S.C.A. § 2339B of providing
material support to terrorists in the form of communications equipment were dis-
missed because they referred to ordinary telephone calls, and the statute was declared
unconstitutionally vague as applied.
The USA PATRIOT ACT broadens the limits on electronic surveillance and
other types of searches and seizure of electronic communications records and other
records. See Chapter 9 for a more detailed discussion of these issues. This set of
laws also permits indefinite detainment of those named “enemy combatants,” in-
cluding American citizens, and places their cases under the jurisdiction of secret
military tribunals. See Chapters 9 and 11 for more details. Critics are concerned that
provisions of the PATRIOT Act are being used to prosecute nonterrorist-related
crimes, such as the telemarketing scam that deposited millions of dollars in foreign
banks. Instead of pursuing previously necessary diplomatic channels to recover the
money, officials simply forced those banks to forfeit property they held in the
United States.11

CHAPTER 5
fighting words:
speech likely to provoke vio-
lence, not protected by the
Constitution.
C.
DISORDERLY CONDUCT
Common law offenses of creating a public nuisance, as well as being a common scold
and behaving with unneighborly conduct, evolved into the offense of disorderly con-
duct. Defined by statute in some jurisdictions, but more usually by ordinance, it is of-
ten considered to be a submisdemeanor offense. Elements differ widely, but always
deal with actions and circumstances that are public in character. Prohibited acts, or
words and acts, are specified. Intent may be included, and the lack of provocation also
may be an element. Types of places where disorderly conduct laws are in effect may
be designated, but need not be public if the action sets in motion a chain of events that
ends in violation in a designated place.
Fighting words, not protected by the Constitution, are usually evaluated accord-
ing to their likelihood of provoking actual violence. Courts tend to apply a narrower
standard when the language is directed at police, because their training should make
them less likely to respond violently to provocation. A bystander who yelled, “that’s
f——” at national park rangers wrestling a suspect to the ground had his conviction
for disorderly conduct overturned in U.S. v. Poocha (9th Cir. 2001). He did not intend
to add to the disturbance, but only to offer his opinion protected by the First Amend-
ment. His conviction for intentionally failing to obey a lawful order of a government
employee to leave the area was upheld.
In Clinton Township, Michigan, however, a seventy-year-old woman pleaded
guilty to disorderly conduct for using obscenities when telling children in a nearby
school yard to be quiet. She was sentenced to a fine of $360 and attendance at anger
management classes.12
More carefully worded statutes prohibit such things as fighting or tumultuous
conduct, unreasonable noise, disruption of lawful assembly, and obstruction of traffic.
“[A] municipality may not
empower its licensing offi-
cials to roam essentially at
will, dispensing or withhold-
ing permission to speak, as-
semble, picket, or parade,
according to their own opin-
ions regarding the potential
effect of the activity in ques-
tion on the ‘welfare,’‘de-
cency,’ or ‘morals’ of the
community.”

It is unlawful to willfully and knowingly impede or disrupt the conduct of the
business of the federal government in or near an area where a person protected by the
Secret Service will be visiting, 18 U.S.C.A. § 1752. It is also unlawful to interfere with
anyone obtaining or providing reproductive health services, 18 U.S.C.A. § 248. The
constitutionality of this law was upheld in U.S. v. Wilson (7th Cir. 1995), in agreement
with two other circuit courts.
D.
RIOT
Group disorderly conduct includes unlawful assembly, usually three or more people
gathering for an unlawful purpose or to carry out a lawful purpose in an unlawful man-
ner, and riot, defined in 18 U.S.C.A. § 2102 as “an act or threat of violence by one or more
in an assemblage of three or more presenting clear and present danger of or actual
damage or injury to other persons or property.” An essential element of riot is group
action. It is not necessary that the riot take place in public. Public terror may be an ele-
ment, as may the requirement of a prior order to disperse—a “reading of the riot act.”
The breach of peace conviction of students nonviolently protesting segregation laws
was overturned in Edwards v. South Carolina (1963). In that decision the Supreme Court
stated that “the Fourteenth Amendment does not permit a state to make criminal the
peaceful expression of unpopular views.” The Court’s decision upholding conviction in
a later protest case narrowed the Edwards ruling when “interest in expression, judged
in light of all relevant factors, is ‘miniscule’ compared to a particular public interest in
preventing that expression or conduct at that time and place” [Colten v. Kentucky (1972)].
Inciting to riot need not actually lead to riot, but it is the urging of others in a sit-
uation presenting a clear and present danger to riot. As police arrested two men at a
housing project a crowd gathered. A man in the crowd told the police to leave, using
profanity. When he turned to leave, an officer told him to stop, and when he turned
with a clenched fist, the officer tackled him. The man asked the crowd to help him,
and they moved close enough to touch the officer. The man’s conviction for inciting
to riot was reversed, because conduct creating a clear and present danger of immedi-
ate unlawful action was not shown [Price v. State (Okla. Cr. 1994)].
E.
VAGRANCY AND LOITERING
Laws meant to keep serfs from wandering away from their responsibilities have sur-
vived in modern statutes against idlers, rogues, and vagabonds. Being without em-
ployment was pitiable in the weak, but able-bodied poor deserved no mercy from
medieval justice that punished them without trial. Modern vagrancy statutes also de-
prived defendants of due process by their vagueness and broad discretion allowed to
police. Although most crimes are based on acts, vagrancy is based on the status of the
offender. Being unemployed, homeless, or simply out of step with the expectations of
society is the actus reus of the crime, with the purpose of forcing the offender to con-
form or to move on out of the community. No mens rea is required.
General vagrancy laws were enforced through the 1960s in this country, until the
Supreme Court decision in Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville (1972) set the precedent
to overturn many of them for unconstitutional vagueness. Reread the Jacksonville or-
dinance that appears in Chapter 1. The Court ruled that statute void for vagueness be-
cause “it fails to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his
contemplated conduct is forbidden by the statute,” it permits arbitrary and capricious
arrests, it prohibits much innocent and otherwise constitutionally protected conduct,
and it provides the police with nearly unfettered discretion.
A Chicago loitering ordinance passed in 1992 allowed police to order groups of
two or more persons gathered “with no apparent purpose” in a public place to dis-
perse when there was a reasonable suspicion that at least one person in the group be-
longed to a criminal street gang. If they did not move along, they faced a six-month

CHAPTER 5
jail sentence. In three years, the ordinance was responsible for more than 42,000 ar-
rests. In 1999, the Supreme Court declared the ordinance unconstitutionally vague,
not giving citizens sufficient notice of what conduct was prohibited [Chicago v. Morales
(1999)]. Defenders of the ordinance cited the dramatic decrease in street crime during
the tenure of the ordinance, whereas its detractors say it punished innocent behavior
and targeted racial minorities.
Ateen curfew ordinance in Vernon, Connecticut that punished both teens and their
parents or guardians was struck down as an unconstitutional infringement on the rights
of parents to make their own decisions in raising their children [Ramos v. Town of Vernon
(2nd Cir. 2003)]. An Indianapolis ordinance prohibiting solicitation of cash at night near
public transportation vehicles or facilities, stopped vehicles, sidewalk cafes, or banks,
and aggressive panhandling was upheld in Gresham v. Peterson (7th Cir. 2000).
F.
ENDANGERING PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT
Industrialization, population growth, land development, and medical and techno-
logical advancements have increased the need for and availability of remedies
against health and environmental problems. Regulations have proliferated in the
past few decades that provide for civil actions as well as criminal sanctions for seri-
ous violations of health and environmental standards. Some health and environ-
mental protection laws have mens rea elements, most often knowingly or
negligently, but many create strict liability offenses because of the severe public con-
sequences of violations. Public health is protected by laws governing infectious dis-
ease control; the purity of food, drugs, and cosmetics (Pure Food, Drug, and
Cosmetics Act, 21 U.S.C.A. §§ 301 to 392); safe housing; pollution control; and other
concerns on the state and federal levels.
A physician convicted of willful violation of public health laws for failing to pro-
vide proper treatment had repeatedly used a nursing home patient’s dialysis catheter
as a feeding tube, then, when the error was discovered, waited ten hours before trans-
ferring the patient to a hospital. The court in People v. Einaugler (N.Y. 1994) ruled that
the offense was not mere negligence.
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) works under federal law to enforce
pollution control measures and to delegate responsibility to the states for further con-
trols, setting minimum standards for state compliance in some areas. Federal pollution
control laws include the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 that prohibits the discharge of
refuse into navigable waters (33 U.S.C.A. §§ 401 to 467); the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C.A.
§§ 7401 to 7642); the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C.A. §§ 1251 to 1387);
the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which controls transportation, storage,
and disposal of hazardous waste (42 U.S.C.A. §§ 6901 to 6992); the Toxic Substances
Control Act, which gives the EPA authority to test and ban dangerous chemicals (15
U.S.C.A. §§ 2601 to 2671); and the comprehensive Environmental Response, Compen-
sation, and Liability Act, which provides funds for hazardous substance cleanups and
requires factual reporting (42 U.S.C.A. §§ 9601 to 9675). The Quiet CommunitiesAct (42
U.S.C.A. §§ 4901 to 4918) prohibits acts and products that exceed noise level standards.
As we saw in the corporate crimes section of Chapter 3, corporate officers can be
held individually liable for their companies’ violations of antipollution laws. In State
v. Gastown, Inc. (Ohio 1975) the owner of a service station was convicted for an oil spill
into a creek, even though the station was under the control of an independent con-
tractor and cleanup had begun within hours of notification of the spill. The water pol-
lution regulatory statute did not require either knowledge or intent.
States regulate hunting and fishing, but the federal Endangered Species Act (16
U.S.C.A. §§ 1531 to 1544), the Migratory Bird Act (16 U.S.C.A. §§ 703 to 712), and the Bald
and Golden Eagle Protection Act (16 U.S.C.A. § 668) give further protection to specified
species. Intentional and unintentional harm is covered by the laws. The migratory bird
and eagle protection laws were used in their first nonhunting application against a util-

were known to be a favorite roosting site in a treeless oil field, and inexpensive equip-
ment was available to prevent harm to the birds. The utility company was sentenced to
three years’ probation and $100,000 in fines, and was required to install equipment to
prevent further harm [U.S. v. Moon Lake Electric Association, Inc. (D. Colo. 1999)].
G.
USE AND DISTRIBUTION OF FIREARMS
Criminal law regarding firearms is divided in focus between the guns themselves and
their possession or sale, and the connection of gun use or possession with other
crimes or by those convicted of other crimes.
The United States Gun Control Act, 18 U.S.C.A. §§ 921 to 930, provides for the
following:
1.
Licensure for the manufacture, importation, and sale of firearms, and
record keeping, background checks, and administration of sworn
statements in sales.
2.
Restrictions on manufacture, importation, and sales of armor-piercing
ammunition, large-capacity ammunition feeding devices, destructive
devices, machine guns, short-barreled shotguns or rifles, any firearm
undetectable by airport security machines, and special restrictions on
handguns.
3.
Restrictions on delivery when knowing or having reasonable belief that
the receiver is under eighteen years of age (under twenty-one if the gun is
other than a rifle or shotgun), has been convicted of a crime punishable by
more than one year in prison, is a fugitive from justice, is an unlawful user
of a controlled substance, has been adjudicated or committed as mentally
defective, is an illegal alien, has been dishonorably discharged from the
Armed Forces, has renounced United States citizenship, is subject to a
court order protecting an intimate partner or child, or has been convicted
of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.
4.
Restrictions on the shipping of firearms and ammunition in interstate
commerce.
5.
Restrictions on transportation of stolen firearms and ammunition.
6.
Restriction of possession of a firearm in federal facilities.
Section 924 of the law specifies knowing or willful mens rea for most of these pro-
visions. Bryan v. U.S. (1998) ruled that “willfully” selling guns without a license re-
quires only that the seller know the sale is illegal, not that he or she knows about the
licensing requirement.
A Texan and a New Yorker arranged for the Texan to buy guns in Texas and bring
them to New York where he sold them to the New Yorker. The Texan’s actions con-
stituted trafficking in firearms under 18 U.S.C.A. § 922(1)(3) according to the Second
Circuit ruling in U.S. v. Mitchell (2nd Cir. 2003). Trafficking is not only the process of
bringing firearms into one’s home state, but also conspiring with someone in another
state to take firearms into that state.

164
■
CHAPTER 5
When combined with other crimes, the carrying of firearms, use of firearms,
greater destructive power of the guns, use of a silencer, and repeated firearms offenses
results in increasingly longer prison sentences, § 924(c)(1). Probation and concurrent
sentences are not sentencing options when firearms are involved. In Bailey v. U.S.
(1995), the Supreme Court narrowed the definition of “use” of a gun during the com-
mission of a crime, requiring that active use rather than mere possession must be
shown. A loaded pistol found in a bag in a locked car trunk and another gun locked
in a bedroom closet were not accessible for use in the drug-related crimes for which
the defendants were arrested. The court in U.S. v. Muñoz (2nd Cir. 1998) relied on Bai-
ley in determining that a weapon was sufficiently accessible to be defined as “carried”
under § 924(c)(1) when a loaded magazine clip in the pocket of a jacket the defendant
was wearing fit into a handgun under the driver’s seat of his vehicle. Guns traded for
drugs are not “used” in the drug offense [U.S. v. Stewart (D.C. Cir. 2001)]. Carrying a
machine gun during a violent crime is a separate, aggravated crime to be proved be-
yond a reasonable doubt, not just a factor in sentencing [Castillo v. U.S. (2000)]. Under
Minnesota’s law that includes both actual and constructive possession of a firearm in
connection with a felony, a .22 revolver kept under a mattress was considered in “rea-
sonable proximity” to the crack cocaine found in a boot three feet away [State v. Roys-
ter (Minn. 1999)].
Federal authorities must notify local authorities upon the release of an inmate
convicted of a crime of violence [18 U.S.C.A. § 4042(b)], but the mere possession of a
firearm by a previous felon is not a violent crime and does not require reporting
[Royce v. Hahn (3d Cir. 1998)].
Through Project Exile, federal, state, and local agencies cooperate to use the stiffer
federal law at § 924 rather than the usually weaker state and local laws to prosecute
the use of guns in crime.13 In turn, federal law specifies that gun transfers must com-
ply with state laws.
Some states issue permits to carry concealed weapons, and others ban all concealed
weapons. Some states limit gun purchases to one a month per person to foil third-party
purchases for buyers who would not pass a background check, and at least eighteen
states and some cities have passed Child Access Prevention laws that make gun own-
ers criminally liable for recklessly leaving guns where children can find and use them.14
IV.
CRIMES AGAINST PUBLIC MORALS
A.
INTRODUCTION
Statutes and ordinances that regulate sexual behavior of consenting adults have their
origins in the canon law of the medieval church. Critics believe that moral issues con-
cerning nonviolent sex, gambling, abortion, and drug use still ought to be left to the
guidance of religion, philosophy, and conscience, with the criminal justice system
dealing only with justice and not sin. Proponents argue that civilizations decay from
within, so it is a public responsibility to maintain standards of decency.
B.
NONVIOLENT SEXUAL CONDUCT
1.
Introduction
Current laws in many jurisdictions outlaw prostitution, incest, adultery, fornication,
indecent exposure, and obscenity. Because most sexual behavior is private, these laws
go primarily unenforced, leading to loss of equal protection when violations are pros-
ecuted. State v. McCollum (Wis. App. 1990) ruled that equal protection was denied
when only female dancers were arrested under decency codes, and not the male pa-
trons who fondled them. Unlike sexual conduct of consenting adults, child pornog-
raphy and exploitation are universally criminalized.
“Civilization is the progress
toward a society of privacy.
The savage’s whole exis-
tence is public, ruled by the
laws of his tribe. Civilization
is the process of setting
man free from men.”

head, 1943

Prostitution
Prostitution is allowed only in some counties of Nevada where it is regulated by law.
The Mann Act, 18 U.S.C.A. § 2422, bans the interstate transportation of any person for
the purpose of prostitution or any other illegal sexual activity. Section 2423 penalizes
transportation of minors for sexual activity and travel with intent to engage in sexual
activity with a minor.
Most jurisdictions include as a separate crime the procurement or transportation
of prostitutes or income from prostitution. Some laws prohibit any sexual activity for
hire; others define the specific activity. Some prosecute only females; others, anyone
who buys or sells sexual favors. Promiscuity without the exchange of money and
long-term commercial arrangements with a mistress or gigolo are not covered.
3.
Sodomy
Sodomy, “deviate sexual intercourse with another individual of the same sex,” was
criminalized by statutes in all states in 1960, with some states including in the prohi-
bition any oral or anal intercourse. The Supreme Court upheld Georgia’s sodomy law
in Bowers v. Hardwick (1986), but reversed that decision in 2003. Lawrence v. Texas (2003)
struck down the Texas sodomy law, as well as those in the twelve other states that still
had similar laws, because it “furthers no legitimate state interest which can justify its
intrusion into the personal and private life of the individual.”

Obscenity is difficult to define. The elements of the crime are clear enough, usually
distribution of obscene material knowing that it is obscene but not necessarily know-
ing the precise contents. Setting the standards for obscenity itself is tough, because in-
dividual sensibilities, taste, and experience vary so widely. James Joyce’s novel
Ulysses was banned in this country as obscene from its publication in 1922 to 1933 and
is now regarded as one of the greatest pieces of twentieth-century literature. The rock
musical Hair was variously banned and applauded in the late 1960s.
Roth v. U.S. (1957) established that obscenity was not protected speech and that it
should be judged against “contemporary community standards” as to whether, taken
as a whole, it “appeals to the prurient interest” and is “utterly without redeeming so-
cial importance.” Miller v. California (1973) ruled that local rather than national com-
munity standards could be used and replaced “utterly without redeeming social
importance” with “patently offensive” and “lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or
scientific value.” Pope v. Illinois (1987) limited community standards applications to
prurient interest and patent offensiveness and disallowed community standards in
the determination of “literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.” The court in State
v. Groetken (Iowa 1991) ruled that the contemporary community standard is not an el-
ement of the crime to be proven, but rather a reference for the jury to determine
whether the material in question falls under the statute’s definition of obscenity.
United States obscenity law is contained in 18 U.S.C.A. §§ 1460 to 1470 and cov-
ers the crimes of possession, sale, mailing, transportation, broadcasting, and transfer
to minors of obscene matter. Knowingly is the mens rea element of these crimes. Items
banned from the United States mails include “. . . obscene, lewd, lascivious, indecent,
filthy, or vile . . . matter” as well as articles designed for producing abortion and in-
formation on where an abortion can be obtained (18 U.S.C.A. § 1461).
Because the Internet allows children easy access to information, the Communica-
tions Decency Act of 1996, 47 U.S.C.A. § 223, was passed. Reno v. ACLU (1997) struck
down the provision in the law prohibiting on-line transmission of indecent material
to children, because there was no definition of “indecent” and no requirement of lack
of redeeming value. Because of the nature of the Internet, the law was believed to in-
terfere with the rights of adults, and the transmissions it sought to control tran-
scended geographical and identity control. The law came under further challenge in
“Did you ever hear anyone
say ‘that work had better be
banned because I might
read it and it might be very
damaging to me’?”

CHAPTER 5
ApolloMedia Corp. v. Reno (N.D. Cal. 1998). The ruling, affirmed in 1999 by the
Supreme Court in a summary ruling, upheld the provision criminalizing telecommu-
nication that is “obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent, with intent to annoy,
abuse, threaten, or harass another person.” This provision was interpreted to ban only
obscene material not entitled to constitutional protection.
In Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition (2002), the Supreme Court struck down another
provision of the 1996 law banning sexually explicit images that “appear to be a mi-
nor” or are promoted by material that “conveys the impression” that children are de-
picted (virtual child pornography). The law was deemed overbroad and vague, and
restricted activity that has no victims. Congress responded by including provisions in
the 2003 PROTECT Act that define computer-generated images that are “indistin-
guishable from that of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct” as child
pornography (18 U.S.C.A. § 2256), as well as any obscene, visual depiction of minors
engaged in such conduct, without the requirement that the minor depicted actually
exists (18 U.S.C.A. § 1466A). The law also criminalizes knowing use of a misleading
Internet domain name to trick a person into viewing an obscene Web site (18 U.S.C.A.
§ 2252B) and requires convicted child pornographers to place their names on the na-
tional sex-offender registry (42 U.S.C.A. § 14072).
After Reno v. ACLU, Congress passed the Child Online Protection Act in 1998, 47
U.S.C.A.  231. This act makes criminal the intentional “commercial distribution of ma-
terial that is harmful to minors.” It applies community standards to determine pruri-
ent interest, prohibits depiction of genitals and sexual conduct “patently offensive
with respect to minors,” and requires lack of serious literary, artistic, political, or sci-
entific value.
State laws also are changing and being challenged in response to growing com-
puter communications capabilities. A Vermont statute prohibiting online distribution
of sexually explicit material “harmful to minors” was struck down in American Book-
sellers Foundation v. Dean (2d Cir. 2003). Preventing minors from accessing such mate-
rial on Web sites would require censoring nonobscene expression by adults. Check
both federal and state statutes and decisions for changes in this area of law.
5.
Child Pornography and Exploitation
Statutes punishing the sexual exploitation of children are sometimes found next to
rape and abuse statutes, and sometimes next to obscenity and prostitution statutes.
Using a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing a
visual depiction of that conduct, allowing a minor under one’s control to engage in
such conduct, buying or selling children for such use, and possessing or distributing
such depictions are criminalized in state and federal law (18 U.S.C.A. §§ 2251 to 2260).
Knowing possession and knowing possession with intent to sell are the usual mens
rea elements of child pornography crimes.
The jurisdictional “hook” provided in 18 U.S.C.A. § 2251(a) that allows for fed-
eral prosecution for child pornography in interstate commerce, including Internet
transmission, covers images that:
1.
the creator knows will travel in interstate commerce,
2.
were produced using materials that were transported in interstate
commerce,
3.
have actually traveled in interstate commerce.
U.S. v. Holston (2nd Cir. 2003) affirmed a federal child pornography conviction, be-
cause the defendant made videos using equipment that had been shipped from an-
other state.
Federal statutes against transportation for illegal sexual activity (18 U.S.C.A.
§§ 2421 to 2427) include use of mail, Internet, and other interstate facilities. A defen-
dant used Internet communication to arrange a meeting with an undercover agent
who had posed as a thirteen-year-old girl and was convicted under these laws [U.S.
v. Panfil (11th Cir. 2003)].

Crimes Against Property, Public Order and Safety, Public Morals, and Justice and Public Administration

Speaking with a minor over the phone established “constructive presence”
with the child that qualified the sexual content of the conversation as taking inde-
cent liberties with her. The defendant’s conviction was affirmed in State v. Every
(N.C. App. 2003).
U.S. v. Wolf (10th Cir. 1989) upheld 18 U.S.C.A. § 2251 as further defined by § 2256,
and enumerates factors used in determining whether a photo of a child is porno-
graphic or not.
UNITED STATES v. WOLF
United States Court of Appeals,Tenth Circuit, 1989
890 F.2d 241 10th Cir. 1989
[Citations omitted]
BRORBY, CIRCUIT JUDGE.
On March 8, 1988, William Joseph Wolf (Wolf) was indicted
on thirteen counts of sexual exploitation of a child in violation
of 18 U.S.C.A. § 2251 (Supp. V 1987). Counts one through
twelve were based on photographs he took of a partially
nude, apparently asleep or unconscious five-year-old girl.Af-
ter taking the photographs, Wolf mailed the undeveloped film
from Oklahoma to Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, for processing.In
the trial court Wolf challenged the constitutionality of 18
U.S.C.A. § 2251. After hearing evidence and argument of
counsel, the trial court ruled the statute constitutional as ap-
plied. Pursuant to a plea agreement, Wolf pled guilty to count
one of the indictment, reserving for appeal the issue of the
constitutionality of 18 U.S.C.A. § 2251. On appeal Wolf con-
tends 18 U.S.C.A.§ 2251 is unconstitutional as applied to the
photograph supporting count one. We hold 18 U.S.C.A.
§ 2251 is not unconstitutional as applied to the photograph.
FACTS
On an evening in late December 1987, Wolf went Christmas
shopping with some friends who brought along their five-
year-old daughter. After shopping, the girl, her parents, and
her brother returned with Wolf to his apartment. Wolf asked
the parents of the girl if she could spend the night with him,
and they consented.
In the early morning hours of the next day, Wolf pho-
tographed his five-year-old victim as she lay on his waterbed.
When he mailed the undeveloped thirty-five millimeter film to
an out-of-state company for processing, Wolf sent two five-
dollar bills and hand-printed instructions: “Send to W.J.W.,
2421 North Sterling, Apartment 112-W, Oklahoma City, Ok-
lahoma.” The photo processing company that developed the
film in Maryland recognized that the nude female was a mi-
nor and contacted the FBI. A controlled delivery of the pho-
tos was attempted by a postal inspector in a mailman’s
uniform. He knocked at Wolf’s apartment and asked for
postage due. Believing the postman was a law enforcement
officer, Wolf refused to accept the package. Subsequently,
the FBI obtained and executed a search warrant of Wolf’s
apartment. Wolf admitted to an FBI agent that he had taken
the photographs of the child and mailed them interstate.
“LASCIVIOUS EXHIBITION”
Wolf contends the trial court erred by finding the provisions
of 18 U.S.C.A. § 2251, as further defined by 18 U.S.C.A.
§ 2256(2)(E) (Supp. V 1987), were constitutional as applied
to the photograph charged in count one of the indictment. 18
U.S.C.A. § 2251 reads in pertinent part:
Any person . . . who employs, uses, persuades, induces,
entices, or coerces any minor to engage in . . . any sexu-
ally explicit conduct for the purpose of producing any vi-
sual depiction of such conduct, shall be punished as
provided under subsection (d), if such person knows or
has reason to know that such visual depiction will be
transported in interstate or foreign commerce or mailed,
or if such visual depiction has actually been transported
in interstate or foreign commerce or mailed.
The term “sexually explicit conduct” is further defined in 18
U.S.C.A. § 2256, which provides, in part: ” ‘(2) sexually ex-
plicit conduct’ means actual or simulated . . . (E) lascivious
exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of any person. . . .”
The trial court did not err in finding these provisions consti-
tutional as applied to the photograph charged in count one.
The photograph at issue in this appeal shows the victim
lying on her back. Her head is at the top of the photo, in the
background of the field. Her eyes are closed, and her head
is turned slightly to the right. Her mouth is open. Her left arm
crosses her chest, and her right cheek rests on the back of
her left hand. Her right arm extends away from her body,
right palm up. She is wearing a pink and white sleep-shirt
which is pulled up above her waist, exposing the lower half
of her body, which is totally nude. Her left leg extends into
the foreground and is cut off in the photograph just below
the knee. The victim’s right leg is raised up toward the ceil-
ing, and to the right.The right knee is not bent substantially.
Her right leg is supported by pillows or other bedding. Her

168
■
CHAPTER 5
legs are spread apart, exposing her genital region. The pri-
mary focus of light in the photograph is the victim’s genitals;
the victim’s head and the other background is barely lit.
Wolf argues the photograph is not within the contempla-
tion of the statute because the sleeping child is not exuding
sexual suggestiveness. Therefore, he argues, the photo-
graph is not a “lascivious exhibition of the genitals or the pu-
bic area” under the statute.
. . .
In finding the defendants guilty [U.S. v.Dost, 636 F.Supp. 828
(S.D. Cal. 1986)], the trial court listed what have come to be
known as the Dost factors. These factors were enumerated
“among any others that may be relevant in the particular
case” in determining whether a visual depiction of a minor
constitutes a “lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic
area” under § 2255(2)(E) (now codified at § 2256(2)(E):
1.
whether the focal point of the visual depiction is on
the child’s genitalia or pubic area;
2.
whether the setting of the visual depiction is sexually
suggestive, i.e., in a place or pose generally associ-
ated with sexual activity;
3.
whether the child is depicted in an unnatural pose, or
in inappropriate attire, considering the age of the
child;
4.
whether the child is fully or partially clothed, or nude;
5.
whether the visual depiction suggests sexual coy-
ness or a willingness to engage in sexual activity;4
6.
whether the visual depiction is intended or designed
to elicit a sexual response in the viewer.
. . .
The Wiegand court rejected the notion that the statute
places the onus of lust on the child being photographed
[U.S. v. Wiegand, 812 F.2d 1239 (9th Cir.) cert. denied 108
S.Ct. 164 (1987)].
It was a lascivious exhibition because the photographer
arrayed it to suit his peculiar lust. Each of the pictures
featured the child photographed as a sexual object.
. . .
Thus, the Ninth Circuit clearly stated that to violate 18
U.S.C.A. § 2251 the photographer need not portray the vic-
timized child as a temptress. We agree with the Ninth Cir-
cuit’s interpretation of the statutory language.
Most recently, in United States v.Villard, 885 F.2d 117 (3rd
Cir.1989), the Third Circuit adopted the Dost factors, stating:
We adopt the Dost factors as a means of determining
whether a genital exhibition is “lascivious.” We do so, of
course, not out of any precedential obligation, but instead
because the Dost factors provide specific, sensible mean-
ing to the term “lascivious,” a term which is less than crys-
tal clear. The district court in the instant case instructed
the jury to consider each of the Dost factors, and cau-
tioned the jury that no single factor should be given undue
weight and that a depiction need not involve all the factors
in order to be“lascivious.”We agree with the district court’s
basic application of the Dost factors. All six factors should
be presented to the jury for consideration. Although more
than one factor must be present in order to establish “las-
civiousness,” all six factors need not be present.
Thus, the Third Circuit recognized the merit of the Dost fac-
tors when properly applied. We wholly agree with the Third
Circuit that all six factors need not be present in order to
bring the depiction under the proscription of the statute.6
In the instant case, the trial court measured the photo-
graph against the Dost factors and concluded the photo-
graph constituted a lascivious exhibition of the genitals and
the statute at issue was not unconstitutional as applied. Af-
ter citing Dost and Wiegand, the trial court found five of the
six Dost factors . . .
Although in resolving legal issues we are not called upon
to write closing arguments, we echo the wisdom and the
passion of Judge Noonan, who wrote:
. . .The pornographic photographer subordinates the hu-
manity of his subject to the sexuality of the subject. . . .
But whether the person is male or female, the essential
operation is the same: an assault upon the humanity of
the person pictured, making that person a mere means
of serving the voyeur’s purposes. . . .
Human dignity is offended by the pornographer.
American law does not protect all human dignity; legally,
an adult can consent to its diminishment.When a child is
made the target of the pornographer-photographer, the
statute will not suffer the insult to the human spirit, that
the child should be treated as a thing.
We hold that 18 U.S.C.A. § 2251(a) as further defined by
18 U.S.C.A. § 2256 is constitutional as applied to count
number one in the indictment against Wolf. . . .The trial court
did not err in applying the Dost factors, and we hold that not
all of the Dost factors need be present in order for a sexu-
ally exploitative photograph of a child to come within the
constitutional reach of the statute.
AFFIRMED.
4.
The Ninth Circuit adopted these factors only in part, stating the
factors should not be applied so as to require a showing of sexual
activity or willingness to engage in it. “The standard employed by
the district court was over-generous to the defendant in implying as
to the seventeen-year-old girl that the pictures would not be lasciv-
ious unless they showed sexual activity or willingness to engage in
it.” Wiegand, 812 F.2d at 1244.
6.
We do not hold that more than one Dost factor must be present
to constitute a violation of 18 U.S.C.A. § 2251(a).

GAMBLING
The first federal indictments for Internet gambling were announced in March, 1998.
Jurisdictional problems inherent in Internet prosecutions were overcome by use of
laws prohibiting telephone use in interstate sports betting, 18 U.S.C.A. § 1084. The el-
ements of this law require the defendant to be a professional gambler and the trans-
mission of bets to be via wire communications, usually understood to mean by
telephone, but defined in § 1081 as “all instrumentalities . . . used in the transmission
of writings, signs, pictures, and sounds of all kinds by aid of wire, cable, or other like
connection. . . .” Defendants in this case were charged with conspiracy to violate
§ 1084 by operating offshore sports betting operations using the telephone and Inter-
net, equating the two types of transmission. U.S. v. Blair (10th Cir. 1995) affirms a
§ 1084 conviction for accepting sports bets by telephone from United States residents
to the Dominican Republic.15
Gambling businesses also are prohibited in provisions of federal and state rack-
eteering statutes. The elements of 18 U.S.C.A. § 1955 defines illegal gambling busi-
nesses as those that violate state law, involve five or more persons, and are in
operation continuously for more than thirty days or have a single day gross revenue
of more than $2,000. An operation in Georgia met these elements with opening night
profits of $110,000, qualifying as sufficient “commerce” to uphold the framing of the
law under the commerce clause of the Constitution [U.S. v. Lee (11th Cir. 1999)]. A
sports wagering business accepting bets in the Caribbean and conducting related fi-
nancial transactions in Texas did not violate § 1955 simply by having the opportunity
to accept bets in Texas [U.S. v. Truesdale (5th Cir. 1998)].
States restrict gambling variously to such operations as horse racing tracks and
off-track facilities, bingo and other games for charitable causes, state revenue lotter-
ies, casinos, and riverboats. These operations are licensed and regulated. Small-stakes
poker games among friends are illegal in some states.

DRUG OFFENSES
1.
Introduction
Drug offenses are often classified as crimes against morality, but could as easily be
placed with those against public order and health, because they can cause physical
harm to persons and property, as well as contribute to other crimes and to economic
and social problems. Therefore, unlike efforts to abolish some crimes against
morality, there is no concentrated movement to allow free use of addicting or in-
toxicating drugs; prohibition or strict regulation are the choices. Since the prohibi-
tion of alcohol was repealed in 1933, its sale and use have been restricted to certain
times of day, to adults only, and to certain places, with a few counties or precincts
remaining dry. Public drunkenness statutes still exist, but are beginning to give
way to an emphasis on the endangerment of others while under the influence of al-
cohol, such as disorderly intoxication and driving under the influence of intoxi-
cants charges.
2.
Driving Under the Influence
A DUI (driving under the influence of intoxicants), OUI (operating under the influ-
ence), DWI (driving while intoxicated), or DUBAL (driving with unlawful blood al-
cohol level) prosecution must prove that the defendant was actually driving and
that the defendant’s blood alcohol level was at a certain level. In 2000 that level was
federally mandated at .08 percent, and by February 2004, all states had complied
with that mandate except Colorado, Delaware, and Minnesota. At least thirty-one
states have increased penalties for higher blood alcohol concentration levels rang-
ing from 1.5 to 2.0.16 For the privilege of driving on public roads, motorists have

170
■
CHAPTER 5
given “implied consent” to have blood, breath, or urine tested for alcohol content.
Since the Pennsylvania vehicle code designates “vehicle” rather than “motor vehi-
cle” in its DUI provision, the drunk “driver” of a bicycle who had two previous DUI
convictions could have his license suspended for five years, Kronenbitter v. Com-
monwealth (Pa. 1992).
3.
Controlled Substances
Crimes involving narcotics, hallucinogens, amphetamines, anabolic steroids, and so
forth do not wait until public safety is actually threatened. Interdiction comes earlier
to penalize manufacture, transportation, sale, distribution, and mere possession of
these drugs, or even the paraphernalia needed for their use, because their potential
use is judged to be extremely detrimental to society. Violation levels depend on the
harmfulness of the substance involved and the amount of that substance. The weight
of pills (5.4 grams), rather than the weight of the effective ingredient in them (1.6
grams), was used in charges of possession of oxycodone to reach the required level of
four grams. Because the state statute specifies any mixture containing the drug, the
conviction was upheld in State v. McCracken (N.C.App. 2003). Some states punish pos-
session of small amounts of marijuana as misdemeanors or petty offenses, with fines
of no more than $500.
The federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970, 21 U.S.C.A. § 811 et seq., was ex-
tended in the 1972 Uniform Controlled Substances Act to promote uniformity among
state and federal laws. Now most states conform to the federal drug acts. The contin-
uing criminal enterprise (CCE) statute, also known as the Drug Kingpin Act, 21
U.S.C.A. § 848, targets those who have a managing or organizing role in large illegal
drug organizations. Chapter 6 discusses this statute in more detail. Some drug of-
fenses are strict liability crimes, and others require general intent.
Possession elements usually include knowledge of the presence of contraband
and the ability to exercise control over it. Constructive possession extends to control
over the substance even though it is not in the defendant’s presence, such as in bag-
gage checked on a plane when the defendant has claim tickets for the baggage. Pos-
session was ruled not to include drugs that have already been consumed by the
defendant, because there was a lack of control [State v. Thronsen (Alaska App. 1991)].
When there is possession but no knowledge, there is no offense. Proof of knowledge
is difficult when there is joint occupancy of a vehicle or dwelling.
Under the stiffer statutes, anyone who intentionally participates in bringing
about the drug transaction, even if only as a translator, is a deliverer of the controlled
substance [State v. Ramirez (Wash. App. 1991)]. Trafficking statutes prohibit bringing
controlled substances into the state to be manufactured or delivered. Ownership or
sale of the substance is not an element of the crime. Some statutes target the “narcotic
vagrant,” a person found where drug use is known to occur or where drugs are kept.
The Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act (46 U.S.C.A. § 612) was used to prose-
cute the captain of a Panamanian-registered vessel carrying two tons of cocaine along
with a cargo of sugar that was sailing from Colombia to Canada. Because the U.S.
Coast Guard received permission from Panama to search the vessel and prosecute the
captain, U.S. jurisdiction was proper, and his conviction was affirmed in U.S. v. Perez-
Oviedo (3d Cir. 2002).
Many states have separate statutes for drug offenses that occur within 1,000 yards
of a school. Decisions have differed about whether intent refers to general intent to
deliver the substance or specific intent to deliver it in a school zone. Some states in-
clude colleges and universities as “schools,” and others do not. The building housing
a General Education Equivalency (GED) program was a “school” in State v. Vasquez
(Wash. App. 1995), but not when the GED program was unrecognizable on the third
floor of an office building in State v. Becker (Wash. 1997).

ANALYSIS PROBLEM
5–8.
Which of the crimes against morals would you leave to religion and
conscience, and which should be the province of criminal law? Why? Does
the fact that law enforcement agencies and the judicial system have limited
resources make a difference?
4.
Drug Paraphernalia
Possession of paraphernalia, such as hypodermic needles, used in the consumption
of illegal drugs is a criminal offense. The item must be designed for use with a con-
trolled substance but need not be proven to have actually been used. The nature of the
item, its proximity to drugs, and other situational facts determine the criminality of
possession. Because the provision of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, 21 U.S.C.A. § 857, that
criminalized the sale of drug paraphernalia did not have a mens rea requirement and
covered items that have legitimate uses, the statute was held to be unconstitutionally
vague in U.S. v. Schneiderman (S.D.N.Y. 1991).
5.
Medical and Religious Use of Drugs
Dispensing of drugs for medical purposes is allowed under careful regulation. A
physician dispensing drugs outside the scope of his medical practice, even though he
did not act with malicious or financial motive, was convicted of drug crimes [U.S. v.
Singh (4th Cir. 1995)]. He exchanged drugs for sexual favors, continued to prescribe
narcotics to addicted patients, and prescribed drugs inappropriate for the patients’
conditions.
Statutes in Alaska, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Montana, Nevada, Ore-
gon, Vermont, and Washington have been passed since 1996 to allow patients to
grow, possess, and use marijuana for medical purposes if they have the documented
approval of a physician. Some of those states allow registered caregivers to grow the
plants and distribute, but not use the drug themselves. Amounts are generally re-
stricted to ounces of useable marijuana, number of plants, or the supply for a certain
number of days. The Supreme Court ruled in U.S. v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers Cooper-
ative (2001) that there is no medical necessity exception to the federal ban on mari-
juana, but the ruling in Raich v. Ashcroft (9th Cir. 2003) granted an injunction in
California against federal prosecution for possession and use of marijuana that has
not been sold or transported across state lines and is used for medicinal purposes.
Raich has been appealed to the Supreme Court. Some other states allow medical mar-
ijuana use with a prescription or have downgraded marijuana possession to a less se-
rious crime. Since there are no legal sources for filling such prescriptions and federal
drug schedules supersede state ones, these laws are primarily symbolic.17
The American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978, 92 U.S.C.A. § 469, and Pey-
ote Way Church of God v. Thornburgh (5th Cir. 1991) allow peyote use in bona fide reli-
gious ceremonies of the Native American Church. Manufacturers and distributors of
peyote to that church must be registered (21 U.S.C.A. § 1307.31). Some states allow
limited exceptions to peyote laws for “bona fide religious use” of peyote, some allow
it for any religious use, others restrict it to ceremonies or members of the Native
American Church or to people of “Native American heritage.” Employment Division,
Oregon Department of Human Resources v. Smith (1990), however, gives states the right
to deny even religious use of peyote.

CRIMES AGAINST JUSTICE AND PUBLIC
ADMINISTRATION
A.
INTRODUCTION
If a criminal justice system is made unreliable by corruption, weakness, or ridicule,
the basic criminal statutes become ineffective. To secure honesty, effectiveness, and
dignity in the administration of government and of justice, acts that threaten those
values have been criminalized.
B.
BRIBERY
Bribery is the ancient offense of intending to influence judges, later extended to pub-
lic officials, and now into the commercial arena. A benefit, not necessarily monetary,
is offered to a person in return for a favor that usually must be connected to that per-
son’s public duty. The person may not have the ability to deliver the favor, but the
agreement must be made with the intent to carry it out. A government contract may
be traded for money, a vote for sexual favors, a defeat in a football game for a lucra-
tive job offer. The bribing of jurors, witnesses, and court officers is particularly dam-
aging to the administration of justice. Those who offer and those who accept bribes
are equally guilty. Giving and receiving bribes are not interdependent crimes; the con-
viction for one does not depend on the conviction for the other.
U.S. v. Sun-Diamond Growers (1999) established that 18 U.S.C.A. 201 (c)(1) requires
proof of “a link between a thing of value conferred upon a public official and a spe-
cific ‘official act’ for or because of which it was given.” Such a link was not found in
the gifts given the United States Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy by the agricultural
trade association. The decision in Sabri v. U.S. (2004) upheld 18 U.S.C.A. § 666(a)(2),
“There are not enough jails,
not enough policemen, not
enough courts to enforce a
law not supported by the
people.”

making bribery of a local official a federal crime when the official works for an agency,
organization, or government that receives at least $10,000 in federal funds in a year.
The bribery does not need to involve the funds themselves [Salinas v. U.S. (1997)].
Other federal laws relating to bribery include 21 U.S.C.A. § 622 prohibiting
bribery in connection with meat inspection, and the Anti-Kickback Act, 41 U.S.C.A.
§§ 51-58. U.S. v. Purdy (2nd Cir. 1998) upheld the 41 U.S.C.A. § 53 conviction of the
president of a helicopter parts company for bribing the purchasing agents of an as-
sembly firm selling helicopters to the United States government. Intent was ruled not
to be an element of the crime. The Travel Act, 18 U.S.C.A. § 1952, includes commer-
cial bribery in its prohibition of travel in interstate commerce to commit a bribe in vi-
olation of state law where it occurs. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibits
bribery in foreign trade [U.S. v. Kay (5th Cir. 2004)].
C.
PERJURY
The elements of perjury are the statement of fact, not opinion, that is both false and ma-
terial to the issue at hand; that the statement is under oath; that it is made in a judicial
proceeding; and that it is made with the specific criminal intent to deceive. All states
and federal law, 18 U.S.C.A. § 1621, criminalize perjury. False swearing is the offense
if it takes place in other than a judicial proceeding. AWashington state court ruled that
if the oath was not required or authorized by law, the defendant could not be convicted
of false swearing, State v. Hovrud (Wash. App. 1991). Subornation of perjury is the in-
stigation of another to commit perjury, and it must include not only the inducement,
but also that the perjury was actually committed by the other person. Defense to per-
jury charges includes proof that the testimony was truthful and, in some jurisdictions,
a recantation before the same tribunal before harm is done or the perjury is found out.
Bronston v. U.S. (1973) established that a half-truth offered by a “wily witness” is
not perjury, as long as the testimony is the literal truth. When asked if he had ever had
a Swiss bank account, the defendant replied that his company had had one. He did
not reveal that he also had had a personal Swiss account in the past. Giving a differ-
ent slant to the problem, a witness gave a factually correct answer to a question that

misstated the date of a pertinent event. His perjury conviction under 18 U.S.C.A.
§ 1621 was affirmed in U.S. v. DeZarn (6th Cir. 1998), because the series of questions
was based on a false premise.
Perjury is difficult to prove, so it is less often the subject of criminal charges than
of sentencing enhancements and contempt sanctions.18
D.
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE
Obstruction of justice, covered in federal statute 18 U.S.C.A. §§ 1501 to 1520 and
statutes in all states, prohibits a wide variety of interference with governmental pro-
ceedings and officers, and can include other crimes in this category, such as perjury
and resisting arrest. Impersonating an officer, tampering with a jury or witnesses,
tampering with evidence, obstructing a criminal investigation, and interrupting com-
munication are some examples.
A woman who walked away from her car after police told her to remain in the
driver’s seat while they attempted to arrest her husband in the passenger seat was
convicted of obstruction of justice. Her conviction was overturned in State v. Stone (Vt.
2000), because she was not under arrest and had the right to move freely.
The corporate scandals of 2001 led to convictions of high-profile corporate of-
ficers and entire corporations for destruction of records and making false state-
ments. In response, the Corporate and Criminal Fraud Accountability Act of 2002
(Sarbanes-Oxley Act) strengthened requirements for maintaining corporate audit
and other financial data and increased penalties for destruction, concealment, or
falsification of records with the intent to obstruct investigations (18 U.S.C.A.
§§ 1519 to 1520).
E.
RESISTING ARREST
Resisting arrest under common law was allowed against an illegal arrest. Recently,
however, both statutes and court decisions are beginning to favor conviction for re-
sisting any arrest by anyone appearing to be a police officer. According to the ration-
ale behind this trend, the availability of counsel and courts makes resistance
unnecessary, leading only to escalating violence. The remedy for unlawful arrest is,
therefore, a civil action rather than resistance. Some statutes make resisting arrest a
specific intent crime.
Using reasonable force to defend oneself from excessive force by the arresting of-
ficer is generally not a crime [State v. Wright (Or. 1990)]. Arrest is an ongoing process,
and postcustody behavior, such as a defendant’s resistance to being placed in a cell
after booking and a Breathalyzer test, was found to be resistance to arrest in State v.
Dowd (S.C. 1991).
F.
ESCAPE
Escape or freeing another from lawful custody incurs more serious penalties if force
is used. Lawful custody includes custody of police or institutionalization in jail, de-
tention center, penitentiary, reformatory, or other confinement specified by law.Acon-
vict under in-house arrest in his own home could not be convicted of escape, because
there was no structured or supervised confinement [Gregory v. State (Fla. App. 1991)].
Failure to return from temporary release also amounts to escape, although courts are
divided about whether specific intent is required. If the custody is lawful, even the in-
nocent may not lawfully escape. When prison conditions threaten harm, escape is jus-
tified only if surrender follows as soon as danger passes. Escape to obtain medical care
is not usually justified. Aiding escape, rescue, and knowingly harboring a felon are
also crimes.

ANALYSIS PROBLEM
5–9.
A judge cleared the courtroom because the gallery had gotten unruly.
When people were readmitted, a man entered who had not been there before
and was unaware of the problem. After the judge asked for quiet, the man
popped his gum and was immediately charged and judged in contempt of
court. His punishment was a night in jail.
Considering that the judge is both “victim” and trier in contempt of court
cases, and also is responsible for the decorum of court proceedings, how
would you balance these roles in dealing with this situation and with con-
tempt cases in general?
G.
CONTEMPT OF COURT
Contempt is disobedience to the court by conduct against its authority, justice, and
dignity. Criminal contempt elements are misbehavior in or near the presence of the
court that obstructs the administration of justice and is committed with criminal in-
tent, 18 U.S.C.A. § 401. Criminal contempt is a generally accepted common law of-
fense, and statutory in some states. The defendant is presumed innocent, is allowed
due process, and must be proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
A defendant who made a threatening gesture toward a testifying witness in a
drug conspiracy trial was convicted of contempt because the proceedings had to be
interrupted for an inquiry as to whether the jury saw the gesture and because of the
intent to intimidate the witness [U.S. v. McGainey (D.C. Cir. 1994)].
Direct contempt takes place in the presence of the court, such as a disruption of
proceedings. Because the judge is present at the offense, the defendant is informed of
the charge, asked to give cause to preclude the judgment, and the judgment is entered
summarily. Indirect contempt takes place outside the court’s presence and may in-
clude violations of confidentiality by a juror or violations of a court order or other
court rules. Here, the procedure is more formal, with a written order to the defendant
to show cause why he or she should not be held in contempt. The defendant is allowed
time to prepare a defense, seek counsel, compel witnesses, and is given access to a jury
trial if the sentence is more than six months. Legislative contempt punishes interfer-
ing with legislative activities, with citations coming from the legislature for the courts
to handle.
The distinction between civil and criminal contempt is not always clear-cut. If a
contempt charge is used as punishment and if the act it punishes is also an indictable
crime, it is more likely to be criminal. Contempt that is used to force a remedial action
is more likely to be civil.
VI.
CONCLUSION
This chapter opened with a discussion of crimes against property. These crimes are
differentiated by subtle shifts in the meaning of holding property, from custody to
possession to ownership. They are further differentiated by the means with which
they are accomplished, such as by force or threat, false statement or document, insider
information, or computer. They can target health care funds, industrial secrets, or,
again, computers.
Some crimes against the public interest in order and safety, decency, justice,
and operation of government do not present a clear indication of harm done, or
even require intent to harm by the offender. Vagrancy and obscenity are such

APPLICATIONS ASSIGNMENTS
1.
A defendant purchased stolen nonnegotiable savings bonds for $500. The
face value of the bonds was several thousand dollars and the purchase
price of the bonds was more than $100, but because they could be cashed
only by the owner they were worth no more than the paper they were
printed on to the thief [People v. Dyer, 403 N.W.2d 84 (Mich. App. 1986)].
Should his conviction for receiving stolen goods valued at more than $100
be reduced?
2.
A defendant took aluminum beams from a building site intending to sell
them at a recycling center. When he found that they would not fit into his
truck, he cut them into pieces. Suspecting theft, the recycling center
refused to take the beams and called police. The defendant was charged
with theft of the beams and criminal mischief for damage to the beams
[Coleman v. State, 846 P.2d 141 (Alaska App. 1993)]. The defense argued that
because the defendant intended to permanently deprive the owner, the
damage was irrelevant. Should he be found guilty of two crimes?
3.
A defendant who had left his car to be repaired was not provided with the
required estimate for the costs, which he considered to be excessive. He
took his car without paying for the repairs [State v. Pike, 826 P.2d 152
(Wash. 1992)]. Should he be charged with theft?
4.
A defendant paid for cattle with a postdated check. When the seller tried to
cash it, there were no funds to cover it. Should the defendant be charged
with issuing a bad check?
5.
If the forgery law in the state of Columbia includes only legal documents,
what charges might be brought against the seller of a fake Picasso
painting? If cousin Mort secretly added a paragraph praising his own good
character to Aunt Bessie’s will, is that forgery?
6.
A Canadian national who was stopped for a traffic violation in the United
States displayed a “passport” from “Elohim’s Kingdom of Israel,” for
which he was charged with possessing falsely made documents.
Considering that passports were not necessary for travel between Canada
and the United States, was this traveler guilty of this forgery-related
charge? Why or why not? See U.S. v. Fox, 776 F.Supp. 569 (N.D. Tex. 1991).
7.
The defendant entered the home of an elderly couple he had worked for,
killed them, then took property from their home [Jones v. State, 652 So.2d
346 (Fla. 1995)]. Should he be charged with robbery?
8.
A man who had been on a hunting trip was turned away from purchasing
beer at a store because he was already intoxicated. He went to his vehicle,
returned with his shotgun, and threatened the storekeeper. When the beer
was handed over, he paid for it. Should he be charged with robbery? [See
Jupiter v. State, 616 A.2d 412 (Md. 1992)].
9.
A hitchhiker chats with the driver while secretly removing $80 from the
driver’s purse on the backseat where he is sitting. The driver is unaware of
the theft until after she has dropped off the hitchhiker. Is the crime petit

larceny, larceny from the person, or robbery [State v. Brennan, 775 A.2d 919
(Vt. 2001)]?
10.
In Case III of Chapter 1, what would be the appropriate charges against
Cat Bermuda? Against Lacey Rude? Why?
11.
The defendant beat the victim until she gave him the bill of sale for her car.
The bill of sale was not a valid one, so he did not gain title to the car [State
v. Martinez, 884 P.2d 3 (Wash. App. 1994)]. Is this extortion in your state?
12.
The defendant in U.S. v. Starr, 816 F.2d 94 (2nd Cir. 1987) ran a business
sorting, addressing, and mailing advertising brochures. He hid higher
postage mail inside bulk rate mailing sacks, only paying the lower rate
while customers were billed for the higher rate. He netted $418,000. Whom
did he defraud?
13.
A psychiatrist sent bills through the mail to insurance companies for more
than thirty-five hours of patient care per seven-hour day. Besides health
care fraud, what crime did he commit?
14.
If you were on the defense team in Case V from Chapter 1, how would you
attack possession charges against your clients? If you were with the
prosecution, what would you argue?
15.
The defendant in a civil rights case filed an affidavit falsely claiming not to
have the money to satisfy the judgment against him [U.S. v. Holland, 22
F.2d 1040 (11th Cir. 1994)]. Did he commit a crime? If so, what crime?
16.
A defendant who directed an obscenity toward the judge, shouted, and
made an obscene gesture was given six months in jail for contempt after each
outburst, the three sentences to be served consecutively. Was justice served?

CHAPTER 6
I.
INTRODUCTION
What if Kate Lamb had safely escaped her attacker in Case I? What if Cat Bermuda in
Case III had arrived outside Mayor Chen’s home just in time to see Lacey Rude led
away by police for the theft of the golden artifact? What if the homeowners of Haden
Hills in Case VI had, on a day’s reflection, decided to accept their new neighbors? Has
a crime been committed in any of these situations?
Think back to the reasons behind criminal law. We have seen that society has
adopted the right or duty to punish those who put it in danger, to deter future
threat of crime, to rehabilitate offenders to live within the law. It seems only logi-
cal that those who intend to do harm, but fail, pose a danger to society that also
can be considered criminal. Society does not benefit by freeing them from liabil-
ity because of the stroke of luck that interrupted their criminal purpose, particu-
larly if that fortuity was the intervention of police. It also seems reasonable to
allow law enforcement intervention at an early stage to prevent completion of the
crime. But to criminalize intent alone, to punish evil thoughts, has been thor-
oughly rejected as an undesirable goal, if not an impossible one. Therefore, some
step toward completing the intended crime is necessary for prosecution. Because
that step stops short of causing harm, a contrastingly high degree of intent or pur-
pose is demanded.
Inchoate crimes are incomplete crimes; that is, crimes that are either in the begin-
ning stages of perpetration or fail to achieve the criminal objective. In some cases the
law is used to control dangerous conduct, to allow intervention where behavior is on
the verge of causing harm, as in attempted murder. In other cases the law aims to con-
trol dangerous persons, such as those involved in conspiracy or organized crime.
Here, the criminal intent is assumed to be strong enough to endanger society even
though steps taken to complete a crime may be minimal.
Although some substantive crimes are preparatory in nature, such as burglary
or assault with intent to commit another crime, inchoate crimes generally include
only attempt, conspiracy, and solicitation. Each of these will be considered indi-
vidually, but it may be helpful to consider them now on a scale of proximity to the
completed crime. At the remotest end of the scale, Max Legrise offers Cat
Bermuda a percentage of the take if she will steal the golden idol, and she refuses.
He is guilty of solicitation to commit theft. If Cat Bermuda accepts the deal and
buys the equipment she will need to scale the wall of the mayor’s house, they are
guilty of conspiracy to commit theft. If Cat is apprehended just as she reaches for
the idol on its pedestal, they are guilty of attempted theft, the closest on the scale
to the completed crime. A combination of two inchoate crimes is way off the re-
mote end of the scale. Solicitation to commit conspiracy and attempted attempt,
for example, are so far from the substantive crime that they are not prosecuted.
The court in State v. Sanchez (Ariz. App. 1993) rejected attempted conspiracy to sell
narcotics as a crime.
Because defenses to inchoate crimes are unique, they are discussed in this chap-
ter rather than with the more general defenses presented in Chapter 7, which may
also apply. The Model Penal Code § 5.05(2) provides for dismissal or a lower grade
conviction if the conduct is “so inherently unlikely to result or culminate in the com-
mission of a crime” that there is little public danger.
Model Penal Code § 5.05(1) gives inchoate crimes “the same grade and degree as
the most serious offense which is attempted or solicited or is an object of the conspir-
acy.” The exception is that “[a]n attempt, solicitation or conspiracy to commit a felony
of the first degree is a felony of the second degree.” Not all jurisdictions have adopted
this guideline, however, so be sure to consult your state’s statutes.
The added danger of people working together to accomplish a criminal objective,
such as in conspiracy, is increased within a criminal enterprise that is ongoing and run

like a business. Federal law targets drug kingpins in the Continuing Criminal Enter-
prise (CCE) statute and organized racketeering crimes in the Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act. Some state laws also cover RICO offenses.
Some states and municipalities have laws and ordinances to control criminal gangs.
Most criminal enterprise convictions require one or more offenses in a pattern or on-
going set of connecting circumstances.

ATTEMPT
A.
INTRODUCTION
The famous case of Rex v. Scofield (Cald. 1784) established the crime of attempt in Eng-
land. A servant, intending arson, left a lighted candle in his master’s house, but the
house did not burn. The ensuing decision criminalized a harmless act because of its
harmful intent. The misdemeanor crime of attempt to commit any offense was ac-
cepted doctrine in England by 1830, too late to have been brought to America in the
body of common law. An 1832 United States statute criminalized attempted murder,
and a generic attempt statute followed in 1836.1 Currently, there is no general federal
attempt statute, but attempt is addressed in the context of specific crimes such as
homicide, 18 U.S.C.A. § 1113; bank robbery, 18 U.S.C.A. § 2113; and passport offenses,
18 U.S.C.A. § 1541.
Prior to the Model Penal Code grading of attempt, states used a variety of grad-
ing schemes. Not all modern statutes adhere to the Model Penal Code standard, but
consistency has improved.2 You will need to research the statutes in your own juris-
diction to find the grading levels used there. Also note whether your jurisdiction lim-
its attempt to certain categories of crimes.
The elements of attempt are intent and an overt act beyond preparation toward
accomplishing the intent. If the crime is indeed completed, attempt usually merges
with the substantive crime and is not prosecuted separately. Even if the crime has
been completed, however, prosecution and conviction for attempt rather than the
substantive crime is allowed by statute in many jurisdictions.
B.
MENS REA IN ATTEMPT
The classic case for discussing mens rea in attempt is Thacker v. Commonwealth (Va.
1922). The defendant and his companion were walking past a tent where a woman
and her child were sleeping. Intoxicated, the defendant shot a gun to put out the
lantern shining through the walls of the tent, narrowly missing the woman and
child. He was charged with attempted murder. Because recklessness is sufficient
mens rea for the charge of murder, the death of one of the occupants of the tent
would have constituted murder. There was, however, no such result. Without harm,
there is a correspondingly greater emphasis on intent. It is logically impossible to
intend to be or try to be reckless, so crimes committed recklessly or negligently are
incompatible with attempt. Without harm and without specific intent, there was no
attempted murder.
Two levels of intent are at issue in Thacker. The defendant had the intent to shoot
the gun into the tent, general intent of conduct, but not the intent to commit murder,
specific intent of result. It is the specific intent to effect a criminal result that is usually
required in attempt. When an act is ambiguous, such as driving slowly back and forth
in front of a bank, specific intent is necessary to conclude criminal attempt. Throwing
gasoline on the floor and saying, “Y’all think I’m wrong about burning this house
down,” showed sufficient intent to convict the defendant of attempted arson in Waller
v. State (Ga. App. 2004).

will be.”

CHAPTER 6
More recent cases bolster Thacker by refusing to recognize depraved indifference
and recklessness as sufficient mens rea for attempt. The court in State v. Vigil (Utah
1992) granted a motion to prevent a charge of attempted depraved indifference homi-
cide as an alternative to second degree murder, because one cannot attempt to be de-
praved or indifferent. Similarly, State v. Hemmer (Neb. App. 1995) held that no such
crime as attempted reckless assault of a police officer exists.
As we have seen, completed strict liability crimes do not require proof of intent
or even knowledge. Therefore, attempt convictions for strict liability crimes are
barred because they add an element of intent that the main crime lacks [People v.
Campbell (N.Y. 1988)].

Gentry v. State (Fla. 1983) challenged Thacker by allowing general in-
tent to be sufficient for attempt. In Gentry, the defendant pointed a gun at his
father’s head and pulled the trigger several times. His conviction for at-
tempted murder was upheld even though specific intent was not shown. Do
you think the circumstances are parallel to Thacker? Do you think the court
was justified in not requiring specific intent?
Be careful to note that some aspects of knowledge do not affect completed crimes
and will not exonerate a thief who thinks she is taking a trinket when the object is ac-
tually a priceless pre–Columbian artifact. Here, specific intent applies to the taking of
the object, not to its value. Usually, if the facts are enough to convict the actor of the
completed crime, they also suffice for attempt.
C.
ACTUS REUS IN ATTEMPT
The common law elements of attempt include an act beyond preparation in further-
ance of a criminal intent. Many states reiterate that mere preparation is not enough to
qualify as attempt. What is often lacking is a clear description of “mere preparation,”
not to mention an explanation of what is sufficient. This lack of clarity provides a great
deal of latitude in the interpretation of this element. Possession of burglary tools that
might constitute no more than preparation in one state may be a substantive crime in
another. A careful study of your jurisdiction’s statutes and case law will help you nail
down what is required in your practice. Analyze the law for comparisons to the fol-
lowing tests for proximity.
1.
Dangerous proximity is a test that can be applied to nearness in time,
distance, or necessary steps to complete the crime. Besides “proximity,” the
word “dangerous” is operative in this test. The seriousness of potential
harm, the certainty of suspicion, the momentum of the steps toward
completion are all factors to be evaluated.
New York’s requirement of “very near” or “dangerously near” was
met in People v. Acosta (N.Y. 1993), a case of attempted possession of a
controlled substance. The defendant had ordered drugs from the supplier,
admitted the seller into his home, and checked the substance. Completion
of the sale was within the defendant’s control. A defendant who had
reached an agreement with a cocaine dealer but found that there was not
enough of the substance available or sufficient money to buy it had not
gone far enough to be guilty of attempted possession [People v. Warren
(N.Y. 1985)].
2.
The indispensable step test nullifies attempt in cases where one necessary
step toward the crime is left undone. If a statute prohibiting the
manufacture of methamphetamine includes possession of the chemicals or
equipment [interpreted as all the necessary chemicals or equipment in
Kotila v. Commonwealth (Ky. 2003)] plus intent to complete the process, a
charge of attempted manufacture of methamphetamine would require the
failed attempt to acquire all the chemicals or equipment, not just the
attempt to acquire some of them.
3.
The probable desistance test requires a prediction of whether the
defendant would or would not voluntarily withdraw from the criminal

Do you agree with the difference in the rulings of Prichard and Still us-
ing the substantial step test? What distinguishes one from the other?
enterprise if left alone. To counteract the difficulty in predicting behavior,
the test is objective, asking if an average person would desist rather than
asking if this particular person would desist. The defendant in State v.
Stewart (Wis. 1988) asked the victim for money, reached into his pocket for
a gun, and stopped only when his companion intervened. The court ruled
that he failed the probable desistance test and affirmed his conviction for
attempted robbery.
4.
The Model Penal Code provides that the defendant must have committed
a “substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in his
commission of the crime,” § 5.01(1)(c), and also that the step be “strongly
corroborative of the actor’s criminal purpose,” § 5.01(2). This standard
favors control at an earlier stage than the proximity tests and, therefore,
widens the net to include dangerous persons rather than only dangerous
conduct. It goes beyond mere preparation, however; strong corroboration
of the act with the purpose is required, which narrows the guesswork
regarding intent. Activities that could qualify as that substantial step are
listed in § 5.01(2)(a–g) and include the following:
(a) lying in wait, searching for or following the contemplated victim of the crime;
(b) enticing or seeking to entice the contemplated victim of the crime to go to the
place contemplated for its commission;
(c) reconnoitering the place contemplated for the commission of the crime;
(d) unlawful entry of a structure, vehicle or enclosure in which it is contemplated
that the crime will be committed;
(e) possession of materials to be employed in the commission of the crime, which
are specially designed for such unlawful use or which can serve no lawful
purpose of the actor under the circumstances;
(f) possession, collection or fabrication of materials to be employed in the
commission of the crime, at or near the place contemplated for its commission,
where such possession, collection or fabrication serves no lawful purpose of the
actor under the circumstances;
(g) soliciting an innocent agent to engage in conduct constituting an element of the
crime.
A defendant who spent two weeks observing a bank, sketched the bank, and re-
connoitered the house of the bank manager to be taken hostage had committed the
substantial step required for attempted bank robbery [U.S. v. Prichard (10th Cir. 1986)].
Sitting in a van with the motor running 200 feet from a bank while wearing a blond
wig was not considered a substantial step in U.S. v. Still (9th Cir. 1988).
An attempted rape was the “overt act” required in the attempted second degree
murder conviction for a defendant who knew he carried HIV and neglected to use a
condom [Smallwood v. State (Md. App. 1995)]. Read the decision in Walters v. Maass
(9th Cir. 1995) for a discussion of the overt act as corroboration of the intent in the at-
tempted crime.

WALTERS v. MAASS
United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit 1993
45 F.3d 1355 9th Cir. 1995
[Citations omitted]
POOLE, CIRCUIT JUDGE
Roger Matthew Walters, an Oregon state prisoner, appeals
the district court’s denial of his 28 U.S.C.A. § 2254 habeas
corpus petition challenging his conviction and sentence for
attempted rape, attempted sodomy, and attempted kidnap-
ping of a thirteen-year old girl.We review de novo.We affirm
in part and reverse in part and remand to the district court
with instructions to grant the writ on the ground that insuffi-
cient evidence supports Walters’ convictions for attempted
rape and attempted sodomy.
I
Walters first contends that he was denied a fair trial when
the state court admitted evidence that in 1981, he ap-
proached another thirteen-year old girl with the ploy of
searching for a nonexistent white German shepherd, of-
fered her $20, and then kidnapped her, took her to his trailer,
and forcibly raped and sodomized her. Walters used the
same German shepherd ploy in this case to try to lure the
thirteen-year old victim into his truck. The state court admit-
ted the prior bad acts evidence as proof of intent.
The Oregon court did not err by admitting evidence of Wal-
ters’ 1981 convictions. Walters’ use of the German shepherd
ploy in 1981 was relevant to show his intent in using the same
ploy in 1987. Moreover, the prior act was not too remote in
time. Although seven years elapsed between the two crimes,
Walters spent almost all of that time in jail serving his sen-
tence for the 1981 crime.The trial court reduced the danger of
unfair prejudice by giving a limiting instruction that the evi-
dence could be used only to show “motive, opportunity, intent,
preparation, plan, knowledge, or absence of mistake or acci-
dent”and could not be used to showWalters’bad character....
II
Walters contends that the evidence was insufficient to sup-
port his convictions for attempted first-degree kidnapping,
attempted first-degree rape, and attempted first-degree
sodomy. . . .
Under Oregon law, conviction for attempt requires proof
beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant “intentionally
engage[d] in conduct which constitutes a substantial step
toward commission of the crime.” Or.Rev.Stat. § 161.405(1).
To constitute a substantial step toward the commission of
a crime, the defendant’s conduct must (1) “advance the
criminal purpose charged, and (2) provide some verification
of the existence of that purpose.” Mere preparation is insuf-
ficient to constitute a substantial step.
The difference between making preparations and taking
a substantial step toward the commission of a crime is one
of degree. In evaluating whether conduct constitutes a sub-
stantial step, we have stated that although behavior need
not be incompatible with innocence to be punishable as an
attempt, “ ‘it must be necessary to the consummation of the
crime and be of such a nature that a reasonable observer,
viewing it in context[,] could conclude beyond a reasonable
doubt that it was undertaken in accordance with a design’ ”
to commit the particular crime charged. Moreover, a sub-
stantial step must entail “an ‘overt act adapted to, approxi-
mating, and which in the ordinary and likely course of things
will result in, the commission of the particular crime.’ ”
Walters asserts that the evidence was insufficient to es-
tablish his intent to commit the crimes of first-degree kid-
napping, rape, and sodomy and to establish that he took a
substantial step toward the commission of those crimes.
Certainly Walters’ intent is manifested by (1) evidence re-
garding his use of the German shepherd ruse in 1981 to kid-
nap, rape, and sodomize another thirteen-year old girl, (2) his
persistent attempts to lure the victim into his truck using the
same ruse, (3) his actions in following the victim home, (4) his
strange speech patterns when he talked to the victim’s
mother, and (5) his statements to the police officer.5 In addi-
tion, Walters’attempt to entice the victim into his truck clearly
advances the criminal purpose of first-degree kidnapping
and strongly corroborates the existence of his purpose to
commit that crime.Thus, we agree with the Oregon Supreme
5. In response to the officer’s question as to whether he had “sex-
ual temptations” toward the victim, Walters paused and responded,
“I could have found myself in an uncomfortable position today and
didn’t mean to.” He also told the officer that his prior conviction was
for first-degree rape of an adult, that he did not have prior problems
with juveniles, and that he was not “a tree jumper ...the [kind of] guy
who hides behind bushes and waits for a young girl to walk down the
street and jumps out of the bushes and molests them.” He also told
the officer that the victim was “13 going on 24” and that he thought
she was “a lot older than 13.”

CHAPTER 6
Court that this conduct constitutes a substantial step toward
the commission of the crime of first-degree kidnapping, and
we do not disturb Walters’ conviction for attempted first-de-
gree kidnapping. See Walters, 804 P.2d at 1167–68. . . .
The more troubling question is whetherWalters’attempt to
entice the victim into his truck constitutes a substantial step
toward the commission of the crimes of rape and sodomy
when the only evidence of intent to rape and sodomize isWal-
ters’ 1981 conviction for kidnapping, raping, and sodomizing
another thirteen-year old girl. If in 1981, Walters had commit-
ted other crimes (for example, breaking the victim’s arm and
stealing her wallet), it would be difficult to conclude now that
enticement into the truck constituted a substantial step to-
ward the commission of those crimes. At some point, the link
between the enticement and the charged crimes becomes
too attenuated: we cannot say that the enticement strongly
corroborates any intent to commit those crimes such that a
“reasonable observer, viewing it [the enticement] in context[,]
could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that it was un-
dertaken in accordance with a design” to commit the crimes.
The only step Walters took toward the commission of
the charged crimes was his attempt to entice the victim
into his truck. It may be that this act to some extent cor-
roborates Walters’ intent to commit some sexual assault,
but we cannot agree that it strongly corroborates his intent
to commit those crimes. Moreover, attempting to entice the
victim into a truck does not, in the ordinary and likely
course of events, result in the crimes of rape and
sodomy. . . .
In sum, where the only evidence of Walters’ intent to
commit the crimes of rape and sodomy is the 1981 crimes,
we hold that Walters’ attempt to entice the victim into his
truck is not a substantial step toward the commission of the
crimes of rape and sodomy. Accordingly, we direct that the
writ be granted with regard to Walters’ convictions for at-
tempted rape and attempted sodomy on the ground of con-
stitutional insufficiency of the evidence.
. . .
AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and RE-
MANDED with instructions.

DEFENSES TO ATTEMPT
1.
Introduction
A client of your supervising attorney has been charged with attempt. The attorney
asks you to look for possible defenses to the charge. Where do you start?
The general defenses discussed in Chapter 7 are most likely to be helpful. There
are some defenses special to the area of attempt, however, but they apply only in very
narrow circumstances. These defenses are abandonment and impossibility.
2.
Abandonment
Abandonment, giving up the criminal enterprise before its completion, is not widely
accepted as a defense in attempt cases. Involuntary abandonment is particularly un-
acceptable. If the actor withdraws because the police arrive or the victim turns out to
be especially strong and determined to hold onto her purse, the danger has not been
erased. There certainly is no evidence that the intent to do harm has been abandoned.
Even voluntary abandonment is rejected by many jurisdictions, just as they would
reject a return of the artifact along with an apology from the Case III Legrise gang as a
defense to theft. If a crime is dangerously close to completion, attempt has already been
committed and cannot be withdrawn, according to this rationale. Courts requiring a
nearer proximity to the completion of the crime would be less likely to allow the aban-
donment defense than those following the Model Penal Code guidelines. Abandon-
ment might still be used to show lack of intent, or could be helpful in sentence reduction.
Where the less stringent standard of actus reus, substantial step, is applied, vol-
untary abandonment is more likely to be accepted as a defense to attempt. The Model
Penal Code makes this provision in § 5.01(4):
(4) Renunciation of Criminal Purpose. When the actor’s conduct would otherwise
constitute an attempt under Subsection (1)(b) or (1)(c) of this Section, it is an affirmative
defense that he abandoned his effort to commit the crime or otherwise prevented its
commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary renunciation of
his criminal purpose. The establishment of such defense does not, however, affect the
liability of an accomplice who did not join in such abandonment or prevention.
“It ain’t no sin if you crack a
few laws now and then, just
so long as you don’t break
any.”

ANALYSIS PROBLEM
6–3.
Compare burglary with attempted theft. Why is one a complete crime
and the other inchoate?
The abandonment must be an entirely voluntary reversal of intent, not influenced
by possible failure or detection, and must be complete, not simply a tabling of plans un-
til a better opportunity presents itself.Adefendant, who was in the process of forcing his
victim to disrobe at gunpoint, stopped when another victim who had been tied up broke
free. The court in Smith v. State (Ind. 1994) ruled the abandonment was not voluntary and
affirmed an attempted deviate conduct conviction. The court in Pruitt v. State (Miss.
1988), however, reversed an attempted rape conviction, because the defendant volun-
tarily and without the intervention of a third party told the victim she was free to go.
Check whether your jurisdiction accepts the defense of abandonment or renun-
ciation.
3.
Impossibility
The defense of impossibility, that is, that the crime was impossible to accomplish un-
der the circumstances, has been eliminated in almost every jurisdiction. The Model
Penal Code rejects the defense in § 5.01(1). If the defendant tried to shoot his victim
with an unloaded gun (impossibility of fact), or mistakenly shot a pillow instead of
the intended victim (legal impossibility since shooting pillows is not a crime), he still
has created a dangerous situation. “When a defendant has done all that he believes
necessary to cause a particular result, regardless of what is actually possible under the
existing circumstances . . . he has committed attempt” [State v. Latraverse (R.I. 1982)].
The decision in State v. Curtis (Vt. 1991) references several of the state statutes,
cases, and commentaries that have led to the demise of this defense. In Curtis, the de-
fendant’s conviction for attempting to take a wild deer out of season was affirmed, al-
though the deer that was shot was an artificial decoy.
Check statutes and decisions to see whether impossibility is still allowed in
your state.
Although factual impossibility is almost always rejected as a defense, when the
chances of the defendant’s actions actually causing harm are so remote that there is
no real danger, charges for criminal attempt are not likely. A voodoo doctor’s magic
does not seem to approach the level of dangerous activity that would warrant crimi-
nal prosecution.
III.
CONSPIRACY
A.
INTRODUCTION
Which is a greater danger to society in Case III, Cat Bermuda stealing an artifact on
her own, or the Legrise gang agreeing to work together for that goal? Which is more
likely to succeed? Which is more likely to continue in crime?
About 700 years ago English common law recognized the added danger of collec-
tive action to the longevity and probable success of criminal activity. Crime, like our so-
ciety, has become more complex. From its rather narrow beginnings against conspiracies
to bring false accusations, conspiracy law now reaches out to encompass agreements to
commit any substantive crime, and is especially helpful in combatting organized crime
that hides the motivating brain of the enterprise inside a web where only the outer
strands are responsible for carrying out criminal actions. Federal law, 18 U.S.C.A. § 371,
prohibits conspiracies to commit any federal offense or to defraud the United States.

194
■
CHAPTER 6
The elements of conspiracy always include an agreement between persons and
the intention to commit an unlawful act or a lawful act in an unlawful manner. The
agreement is the actus reus, and the criminal purpose is the mens rea. The general fed-
eral statute and some state statutes add a third element, that an overt act furthering
the purpose of the agreement must have been committed by at least one of the con-
spirators. Only one act needs to be proved, and that act need not be unlawful in itself,
but must have been performed within the time of the conspiracy. Also, this overt act
does not need to come so close to the substantive crime as the “substantial step” re-
quirement for attempt.
Some specific federal conspiracy statutes do not require the overt act: 18 U.S.C.A.
§ 241, conspiracy against rights of citizens; 18 U.S.C.A. § 286, conspiracy to defraud
the government with respect to claims; 18 U.S.C.A. § 1951, interference with com-
merce by threats or violence; 18 U.S.C.A. § 2384, seditious conspiracy; 21 U.S.C.A.
§ 846, conspiracy to manufacture, possess, distribute, or dispense controlled sub-
stances; and 21 U.S.C.A. 963, conspiracy to import or export controlled substances.
Some state statutes also forego the overt act element in conspiracy to commit such
crimes as armed burglary and felony on the person of another.
In order to deal with the special dangers and difficulties of controlling group
crime, conspiracy has taken on aspects of several other categories of crime. It is simi-
lar to complicity laws in holding one person liable for the conduct of another. Unlike
the requirement of actual participation in aiding and abetting, however, conspirators
only need to be involved in the agreement.
Like attempt, conspiracy is an inchoate crime and does not require the completion
of the objective offense. But if the crime is accomplished, conspiracy can stand sepa-
rately as a substantive crime in addition to the objective offense, unlike attempt that
merges with the completed act. Sentencing for two crimes instead of one, murder as well
as conspiracy to commit murder for example, makes these laws particularly effective.
Some state laws prohibit this separate conviction for conspiracy unless the conspiracy
included plans to commit at least one other offense in addition to the one that was com-
pleted. Under these laws, the Case III Legrise gang would have had to plan an addi-
tional hit, say the theft of a Daumier drawing from the art center downtown, on top of
the successful theft of the idol in order to be charged with both conspiracy and theft.
This approach, favored in Model Penal Code § 1.07(1)(b), is a check on possible over-
use of conspiracy charges by prosecutors, as discussed in section F following.
A conspiracy agreement to traffic in drugs that was formed in Texas and an at-
tempt to carry out the objective of the conspiracy in New Mexico resulted in convic-
tions on both conspiracy and attempt charges in New Mexico [State v. Villalobos (N.M.
App. 1995)].
States vary widely in their penalties. Some set conspiracies as misdemeanors re-
gardless of the target crime, others set maximum sentences at a constant level, and
still others vary the level to correspond to different types of substantive crimes.
B.
MENS REA IN CONSPIRACY
The heart of the crime of conspiracy is a meeting of the minds of its participants. It is
a predominantly “mental” crime, so court decisions regarding it tend to be inconsis-
tent. In general, though, a double-pronged intent is required: the defendant must in-
tend to agree and must intend that the substantive crime be committed with the same
mens rea requirements as those for the substantive crime. Although each conspirator
must have knowledge of the unlawful aims of the scheme, this does not necessarily
extend to every detail of the enterprise, or even to the identity of each coconspirator.
Knowledge alone, however, is not enough to establish intent. In the case of People
v. Lauria (Cal. 1967), the defendant whose answering service was used by prostitutes
to solicit customers was acquitted of conspiracy to commit prostitution, even though
he knew of that use. The decision expressed the following rule:
“What man was ever con-
tent with one crime?”
—Juvenal, Satires, c. 120

Inchoate and Organized Crimes
■195
[T]he intent of a supplier who knows of the criminal use to which his supplies are put to
participate in the criminal activity connected with the use of his supplies may be
established by (1) direct evidence that he intends to participate, or (2) through an
inference that he intends to participate based on, (a) his special interest in the activity,
or (b) the aggravated nature of the crime itself.
The decision gives examples of circumstantial evidence of intent based on special
interest (a), as an inflated profit from the enterprise; the sale of goods with no legiti-
mate use, such as crooked dice to gambling casinos; and sales in such volume as to be
grossly disproportionate to any legitimate demand, such as the sale of narcotics to a
physician in much greater amounts than the physician’s legal use [Direct Sales v. U.S.
(1943)]. The Lauria decision also implied that if the substantive crime is a felony, mere
knowledge might suffice in establishing intent (b), but ultimately left the question
open. Conversely, a defendant could not be convicted of conspiracy to sell heroin
when there was no proof that he knew drugs were involved in the transaction [U.S.
v. Idowu (3rd Cir. 1998)].
Judge Learned Hand expressed this problem of knowledge succinctly in U.S. v.
Crimmins (2d Cir. 1941).
While one may, for instance, be guilty of running past a traffic light of whose existence
one is ignorant, one cannot be guilty of conspiring to run past such a light, for one
cannot agree to run past a light unless one supposes that there is a light to run past.
This also puts to rest any possibility of conspiring to commit negligence, although
conspiring to create a risk of harm is possible. Since conspiracy is a specific intent
crime, intent of the conspirators simply to shoot a gun from a van, which happened
to result in a person’s death, was not the specific intent to kill that would be required
for a conviction for conspiracy to commit murder. The conspiracy conviction was re-
versed in People v. Swain (Cal. App. 1996). Some jurisdictions apply the test that if con-
sequences of the conspiracy are the natural and probable results of the agreement,
then all conspirators are guilty of conspiracy to commit those resulting acts. In such
a jurisdiction, Swain’s conviction would probably be affirmed. The Model Penal Code
rejects the natural and probable test, restricting the liability of each conspirator to the
criminal purposes that the conspirator shares or knows.
C.
ACTUS REUS IN CONSPIRACY
1.
Agreement
Agreement is the essence and the actus reus element of conspiracy. Conspiracy laws
do not punish mere thoughts [U.S. v. Shabani (1994)]. Proof of the agreement is often
circumstantial, but it must go beyond simple presence at the scene of the crime. Even
though the defendant in U.S. v. Cox (8th Cir. 1991) was with companions when he
sought to buy cocaine, lack of evidence that the group had agreed on what to do with
the cocaine after the purchase led the court to conclude that a conspiracy had not oc-
curred. If the circumstances are sufficiently compelling, some courts may allow an ap-
parent singleness of purpose to indicate agreement, as in Griffin v. State (Ark. 1970)
where a policeman was assaulted by a large group of people. A shared objective did
not take the place of an agreement, however, when a defendant shot his son’s wife af-
ter his son said he wanted her killed [Rude v. State (Wyo. 1993)].
Circumstantial evidence usually is necessary to show agreement. A conviction for
conspiracy to possess and distribute marijuana was based on evidence that the co-
conspirators drove similar vehicles insured by the same company and registered un-
der the same name with similar compartments in the fuel tanks concealing more than
400 pounds of marijuana [U.S. v. Rangel-Arreola (10th Cir. 1993)]. Details of the agree-
ment, such as price, do not have to be decided for the agreement to be complete [U.S.
v. Sharif (9th Cir. 1987)]. When negotiation of the agreement is still going on, however,

the conspiracy has not yet occurred. In U.S. v. Iennaco (D.C. Cir. 1990), “exploratory
and inconclusive conversations” concerning distribution of controlled substances
were not sufficient to constitute conspiracy.
An often used authority on the scope of agreement is the case of Pinkerton v. U.S.
(1946). The defendant’s conviction for substantive offenses was upheld, even though
he was in prison at the time they were committed and had no knowledge of the spe-
cific crimes.
PINKERTON v. UNITED STATES
Supreme Court of the United States, 1946.

[Citations omitted]
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
Walter and Daniel Pinkerton are brothers who live a short
distance from each other on Daniel’s farm. They were in-
dicted for violations of the Internal Revenue Code. The in-
dictment contained ten substantive counts and one
conspiracy count.The jury found Walter guilty on nine of the
substantive counts and on the conspiracy count. It found
Daniel guilty on six of the substantive counts and on the
conspiracy count. . . .The case is here on a petition for a writ
of certiorari, which we granted because one of the ques-
tions presented involved a conflict between the decision be-
low and United States v. Sall, 116 F.2d 745, decided by the
Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.
A single conspiracy was charged and proved. Some of
the overt acts charged in the conspiracy count were the
same acts charged in the substantive counts. Each of the
substantive offenses found was committed pursuant to
the conspiracy. Petitioners therefore contend that the sub-
stantive counts became merged in the conspiracy count,
and that only a single sentence not exceeding the maximum
two year penalty provided by the conspiracy statute (Crimi-
nal Code § 37, 18 U.S.C.A. § 88) could be imposed. Or to
state the matter differently, they contend that each of the
substantive counts became a separate conspiracy count
but, since only a single conspiracy was charged and proved,
only a single sentence for conspiracy could be imposed.
They rely on Braverman v. United States, 317 U.S. 49.
In the Braverman case the indictment charged no sub-
stantive offense. Each of the several counts charged a con-
spiracy to violate a different statute. But only one conspiracy
was proved. We held that a single conspiracy, charged un-
der the general conspiracy statute, however diverse its ob-
jects may be, violates but a single statute and no penalty
greater than the maximum provided for one conspiracy may
be imposed.That case is not apposite here. For the offenses
charged and proved were not only a conspiracy but sub-
stantive offenses as well.
Nor can we accept the proposition that the substantive
offenses were merged in the conspiracy. There are, of
course, instances where a conspiracy charge may not be
added to the substantive charge. One is where the agree-
ment of two persons is necessary for the completion of the
substantive crime and there is no ingredient in the conspir-
acy which is not present in the completed crime. Another is
where the definition of the substantive offense excludes
from punishment for conspiracy one who voluntarily partici-
pates in another’s crime. But those exceptions are of a lim-
ited character. The common law rule that the substantive
offense, if a felony, was merged in the conspiracy, has little
vitality in this country. It has been long and consistently rec-
ognized by the Court that the commission of the substantive
offense and a conspiracy to commit it are separate and dis-
tinct offenses. The power of Congress to separate the two
and to affix to each a different penalty is well established. . . .
It has ingredients, as well as implications, distinct from the
completion of the unlawful project. As stated in United
States v. Rabinowich, 238 U.S. 78, 88:
“For two or more to confederate and combine together to
commit or cause to be committed a breach of the criminal
laws, is an offense of the gravest character, sometimes
quite outweighing, in injury to the public, the mere com-
mission of the contemplated crime. It involves deliberate
plotting to subvert the laws, educating and preparing the
conspirators for further and habitual criminal practices.
And it is characterized by secrecy, rendering it difficult of
detection, requiring more time for its discovery, and
adding to the importance of punishing it when discovered.”
Moreover, it is not material that overt acts charged in the
conspiracy counts were also charged and proved as sub-
stantive offenses. . . . The agreement to do an unlawful act
is even then distinct from the doing of the act.

Inchoate and Organized Crimes
■197
It is contended that there was insufficient evidence to im-
plicate Daniel in the conspiracy. But we think there was
enough evidence for submission of the issue to the jury.
There is, however, no evidence to show that Daniel par-
ticipated directly in the commission of the substantive of-
fenses on which his conviction has been sustained,
although there was evidence to show that these substantive
offenses were in fact committed by Walter in furtherance of
the unlawful agreement or conspiracy existing between the
brothers.The question was submitted to the jury on the the-
ory that each petitioner could be found guilty of the sub-
stantive offenses, if it was found at the time those offenses
were committed petitioners were parties to an unlawful con-
spiracy and the substantive offenses charged were in fact
committed in furtherance of it.
Daniel relies on United States v. Sall, supra. That case
held that participation in the conspiracy was not itself
enough to sustain a conviction for the substantive offense
even though it was committed in furtherance of the conspir-
acy. The court held that, in addition to evidence that the of-
fense was in fact committed in furtherance of the
conspiracy, evidence of direct participation in the commis-
sion of the substantive offense or other evidence from which
participation might fairly be inferred was necessary.
We take a different view. We have here a continuous
conspiracy.There is here no evidence of the affirmative ac-
tion on the part of Daniel which is necessary to establish his
withdrawal from it. Hyde v. United States, 225 U.S. 347,
369. As stated in that case, “Having joined in an unlawful
scheme, having constituted agents for its performance,
scheme and agency to be continuous until full fruition be
secured, until he does some act to disavow or defeat the
purpose he is in no situation to claim the delay of the law.
As the offense has not been terminated or accomplished he
is still offending. And we think, consciously offending, of-
fending as certainly, as we have said, as at the first moment
of his confederation, and consciously through every mo-
ment of its existence.” Id., p. 369. And so long as the part-
nership in crime continues, the partners act for each other
in carrying it forward. It is settled that “an overt act of one
partner may be the act of all without any new agreement
specifically directed to that act.” United States v. Kissel, 218
U.S. 601, 608. Motive or intent may be proved by the acts
or declarations of some of the conspirators in furtherance
of the common objective. . . . The governing principle is the
same when the substantive offense is committed by one of
the conspirators in furtherance of the unlawful project. The
criminal intent to do the act is established by the formation
of the conspiracy. Each conspirator instigated the commis-
sion of the crime. The unlawful agreement contemplated
precisely what was done. It was formed for the purpose.
The act done was in execution of the enterprise. The rule
which holds responsible one who counsels, procures, or
commands another to commit a crime is founded on the
same principle. That principle is recognized in the law of
conspiracy when the overt act of one partner in crime is at-
tributable to all. An overt act is an essential ingredient of the
crime of conspiracy under § 37 of the Criminal Code, 18
U.S.C.A. § 88. If that can be supplied by the act of one con-
spirator, we fail to see why the same or other acts in fur-
therance of the conspiracy are likewise not attributable to
the others for the purpose of holding them responsible for
the substantive offense.
A different case would arise if the substantive offense
committed by one of the conspirators was not in fact done
in furtherance of the conspiracy, did not fall within the
scope of the unlawful project, or was merely a part of the
ramifications of the plan which could not be reasonably
foreseen as a necessary or natural consequence of the un-
lawful agreement. But as we read this record, that is not
this case.
Affirmed.

Overt Act
As we have seen, an overt act in furtherance of a conspiratorial agreement is a re-
quired part of the actus reus element in the general federal statute, 18 U.S.C.A. § 371,
and some states. One act by one conspirator is sufficient. Most states and specific fed-
eral statutes such as 21 U.S.C.A. § 846 concerning controlled substance conspiracies
[U.S. v. Stassi (7th Cir. 1992) and U.S. v. Shabani (1994)] and 18 U.S.C.A. § 1956(h) con-
cerning conspiracy to launder money [Whitfield v. U.S. (2005)], however, do not re-
quire an overt act. The Model Penal Code recommends the requirement of an overt
act except when the objective crime is a first or second degree felony.
Often the overt act is considered simply a procedural step in proving the exis-
tence of an agreement and the willingness of the culprits to adhere to it. The overt act
does not need to be criminal. It included the lawful purchase of guns and ski masks
in furtherance of a conspiracy to commit burglary in Burk v. State (Wyo. 1993).

CHAPTER 6
Wharton’s Rule:
there is no added danger in
numbers justifying a charge
of conspiracy in crimes-
requiring the participation of
two persons, unless a third
person participates.
3.
Number of Conspirators
Some cases hinge on the question of how many people are necessary to form a con-
spiracy. When the commission of a crime necessarily involves two people, such as
in bribery, a doctrine called Wharton’s Rule maintains that there is no added dan-
ger in numbers justifying a charge of conspiracy, unless a third person participates.
The Wharton Rule was no defense in People v. Laws (Ill. 1993), where five different
combinations of at least eight people conspired to participate in an enterprise of
pimping and keeping a place of prostitution. When conspiracy is defined as an
agreement between two or more persons, there may be a problem in prosecuting a
“conspirator” whose “partner” is an undercover officer with no serious involve-
ment in the agreement. The Model Penal Code solves the problem by defining
agreement as one person agreeing with another (unilateral conspiracy), rather than
an agreement between two or more persons. This allows for the prosecution of the
single culpable conspirator [Commonwealth v. Sego (Ky. 1994)]. Some jurisdictions,
however, require that two persons are involved in the conspiracy, neither of whom
is a government agent or informer [U.S. v. Wright (11th Cir. 1995) and State v. Pacheco
(Wash. 1994)].
4.
Number of Conspiracies
One of the most commonly raised points on appeal is the number of conspiracies in
which defendants are involved. If several substantive crimes stem from one agree-
ment, separate charges for conspiracy will not be allowed for each of the separate
crimes [Braverman v. U.S.(1942)]. This is also discussed in Pinkerton. The continuity of
the conspiratorial agreement is the key.
The number of charges depends primarily on the relationship of the conspirators.
If one person makes separate agreements to help two different parties commit two
separate crimes, there are two separate conspiracies. Conversely, if the two cocon-
spirators, even unknown to each other, both agree to work toward the same criminal
objectives with one central person, only one conspiracy takes place; this is an exam-
ple of a “wheel” conspiracy, with a “hub” person at the center and individuals or
groups forming the spokes. Kotteakos v. U.S. (1946) is the classic example of a wheel
conspiracy, where the spokes did not share objectives. The hub person was convicted
of multiple conspiracies for fraudulent loan applications on behalf of several people,
but neither the transactions nor the people were connected.
A “chain” conspiracy involves a linear transaction, such as from manufacturer to
wholesaler to retailer to consumer. Each of the conspirators may have no knowledge
of who is working two links up or down the chain, but they must have a common, in-
terdependent objective in order to form only one conspiracy. U.S. v. Peoni (2nd Cir.
1938) is a classic case showing a chain conspiracy structure, but reversing conviction
because of a lack of “concert of purpose.” Peoni sold counterfeit bills to Regno, who
sold them to Dorsey, but Peoni had no interest in the matter beyond the transaction
with Regno. A common goal is reiterated as the most important factor in analyzing a
chain conspiracy in U.S. v. Tarantino (D.C. Cir. 1988).
Some courts use the “totality of the circumstances” in determining the number of
conspiracies. Interconnections among overt acts, people involved in the conspiracy,
methods of operation, locations, and objectives, as well as the time period and inter-
dependence necessary for success are considered.3 A police officer conspired on sev-
eral occasions to steal drugs from dealers and resell them on the street. Audiotapes
recorded over a period of forty days showed a series of agreements involving sepa-
rate negotiations with short-term goals, so her conviction on separate conspiracy
charges was affirmed [State v. Childs (Ohio 2000)].
A change in plans as a conspiracy unfolded did not amount to a second conspir-
acy in Tracy v. State (Md. 1990). One conspirator was unable to stab the victim, so they

one person agreeing with
another, rather than an

more persons; allows for the

agreed that the other would shoot the victim so they could steal his car. The court de-
cided there was still only one continuous conspiratorial relationship.
Note that careful accuracy is required in identifying parties and counts in con-
spiracy complaints.
D.
DEFENSES TO CONSPIRACY
Impossibility of achieving the agreed-on goal is not a defense to conspiracy, because
the agreement itself is the crime. The court in State v. Houchin (Mont. 1988) rejected a
factual impossibility defense when the intended victim of the conspiracy to commit
homicide was fictitious. At the same time, it affirmed the defense of legal impossibil-
ity, saying that if a planned act is not an “offense”, one element of conspiracy is miss-
ing. The court in U.S. v. Petit (11th Cir. 1988) rejected both legal and factual
impossibility as conspiracy defenses. A defendant who conspired to receive stolen
goods but actually received borrowed goods in a sting operation, making the sub-
stantive offense an impossibility, could still be convicted of conspiracy, because con-
spiracy depends on intent rather than conduct. See Chapter 7 for further discussion of
impossibility defenses to other crimes. Similarly, many courts reject the defense of
abandonment, because the agreement has already occurred. A defendant who had
conspired to defraud the United States by failing to declare money at the national bor-
der gave a coconspirator last minute instructions to file a proper customs report. His
conviction for conspiracy was affirmed in U.S. v. Herron (5th Cir. 1987), because the
withdrawal came after the conspiracy agreement and overt acts had been completed.
Do you think society would benefit by permitting a defense of abandonment? The
drafters of the Model Penal Code seem to think so. They aver the effectiveness of re-
nunciation in § 5.03(6).
It is an affirmative defense that the actor, after conspiring to commit a crime, thwarted
the success of the conspiracy, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
The conspiracy might be considered abandoned if the defendant alerts the police, in-
forms coconspirators that he or she is out of the agreement, tries to remedy past in-
volvement in the conspiracy, or tries to prevent any further activities of the
conspiracy.4 In any case, withdrawal would prevent prosecution for subsequent sub-
stantive crimes by the remaining coconspirators.
The U.S. Supreme Court overruled Ninth Circuit precedent in U.S. v. Recio (2003)
and held that a conspiracy does not end when police have defeated its object. When
a truck loaded with illegal drugs was stopped, the drivers cooperated with police and
called the defendants to pick up the truck. When they did so, they were arrested and
subsequently convicted for conspiracy. The conviction stands because the agreement
to commit an unlawful act is the heart of the crime of conspiracy, which does not de-
pend on the success of the agreement.
The statute of limitations also can be used as a defense, giving advantage to the
conspirator who abandons the enterprise. If there is agreement but no overt act, the
statute of limitations begins running for all conspirators at the time of the agreement.
If there are overt acts furthering the conspiracy, the running of the statute for the entire
conspiracy is dated from the last act. If a conspirator abandons the enterprise before
that last act, however, the statute of limitations for that conspirator is dated from the
abandonment, and will run out earlier than for those who participated until the end.
Because conspiracy is a group crime, the liability of one participant is related to the
liability of the others. Generally, if all other conspirators have been convicted, or even
if prosecution has been suspended because of death, subsequent insanity, granting
of immunity, nolle prosequi (the choice not to prosecute at that time), or that

CHAPTER 6
ANALYSIS PROBLEM
6–4.
Do you see a relationship between the demise of the last conspirator
defense and the Model Penal Code’s allowance for unilateral conspiracy?
What are the benefits and problems of this trend to broaden conspiracy laws?
coconspirators are unknown to the prosecution, the issue is still alive and the last de-
fendant may be prosecuted. Harris v. State (Md. App. 1990) affirmed a conspiracy con-
viction even though conspiracy charges were not pursued against the coconspirator.
Traditionally, if all alleged coconspirators have been acquitted or had charges
against them dropped as an indication of innocence, the last defendant is also released
from prosecution. One cannot conspire alone, so when all possible conspirators are
eliminated, conspiracy cannot have existed. Some jurisdictions require that such an ac-
quittal of coconspirators form a binding judicial determination of acquittal for the re-
maining conspirator. This last conspirator defense was affirmed in State v. Robinson
(Conn. 1989). The defendant charged with conspiracy to commit murder could not be
convicted after the sole coconspirator had been acquitted in a separate trial. The court
in Ydrysek v. State (Ark. 1987) ruled that although a state statute barred the last con-
spirator defense when there were separate trials, inconsistent convictions in a joint trial
would be set aside. U.S. v. Bucuvalas (1st Cir. 1990) declared the last conspirator defense
no longer viable, because a jury’s decision to acquit one conspirator by mistake, com-
promise, or lenity should have no effect on the conviction of another conspirator. U.S.
v. Zuniga-Salinas (5th Cir. 1992) agreed with the Bucuvalas decision, overruling previ-
ous cases to the contrary.
last conspirator defense:
if all coconspirators have
been acquitted or had
charges dropped, the last
defendant is also released
from prosecution.
E.
HEARSAY EXCEPTION
Rules of evidence bar the use of hearsay testimony at trial or hearing, that is, testi-
mony based on the account of someone other than the witness offering the testimony.
Exceptions to this rule, however, include one specifically used in conspiracy prose-
cutions. Evidence of any act or declaration by one coconspirator committed during
and in furtherance of a conspiracy is admissible against each coconspirator [Federal
Rules of Evidence 801(d)(2)(E)]. The rationale for this rule is contained in the Federal
Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(a)(1)(A), that coconspirators can be considered agents
of each other, so the statements of one may be admissible against another as if it were
his or her own statement. Even statements of uncharged coconspirators are admissi-
ble under the principle of agency [Bigelow v. State (Wyo. 1989)].
Use of hearsay evidence is usually allowed only if (1) the conspiracy has been estab-
lished independently, (2) the declarant and the defendant both are shown to be involved
in the conspiracy, and (3) the statements in question were made during the course of the
conspiracy and in furtherance of it [Jandro v. State (Wyo. 1989)]. In State v. Rivenbark (Md.
1987) hearsay statements were not allowed because they were made during an effort to
conceal the crime six months after the main objective of the conspiracy had been com-
pleted and, therefore, were not during or in furtherance of the conspiracy. If the original
conspiracy had included an agreement on concealment procedures, the statements
would have been in furtherance of that conspiracy and, therefore, admissible.
The time period of the conspiracy is also important in Smith v. State (Wyo. 1995),
which illustrates the use of hearsay evidence in conspiracy cases.

SMITH v. STATE
Supreme Court of Wyoming, 1995.
902 P.2d 1271 Wyo. 1995
[Citations omitted]
THOMAS, Justice.
. . .
Smith was charged with conspiracy to intimidate a wit-
ness, in violation of Wyo. Stat. § 6–5–305(a) and Wyo. Stat.
§ 6–1–303(a), for his role in an assault and battery on Paul
Minick (Minick), who testified at the trial of Smith’s sister,
Rachel Smith. In December of 1992, Minick and his friend,
Mike Webb, were driving north on I-90 about 20 miles south
of Sheridan when they apparently suffered a tire blowout. In
fact, Rachel Smith shot the right rear tire with a rifle, and she
and Tammy Higgins then robbed the two teenage boys at
gunpoint. Pursuant to a subpoena issued by the district
court, Minick returned to Sheridan on July 29, 1993, and tes-
tified against Rachel Smith on July 30, 1993. He was re-
leased from the subpoena on that day, but he stayed until the
jury returned a verdict of guilty at about 4:45 p.m. After the
verdict was returned, Minick spent some time at the home of
a deputy sheriff and, later, two deputies from the sheriff’s of-
fice took Minick to dinner and then, about 8:15 p.m., to the
bus depot in Sheridan to return to his home in Montana.
While Minick was at the bus depot, he was approached by
David Rhoden (Rhoden), who requested assistance in jump
starting his van.Minick declined at first, but then agreed to as-
sist Rhoden. The two went into the parking lot at the bus de-
pot and were approaching a van when Rhoden stopped to tie
his shoe. When Minick turned around, Rhoden hit him in the
face inflicting a bloody nose and a lip laceration that left a scar.
The conspiracy statute, WYO.STAT. § 6–1–303, provides,
in pertinent part:
(a) A person is guilty of conspiracy to commit a crime if
he agrees with one (1) or more persons that they or one
(1) or more of them will commit a crime and one (1) or
more of them does an overt act to effect the objective of
the agreement.
The crime Smith was charged with conspiring to commit, is
defined in WYO.STAT. § 6–5–305(a), which provides:
A person commits a felony punishable by imprisonment
for not more than ten (10) years, a fine of not more than
five thousand dollars ($5,000.00), or both, if, by force or
threats, he attempts to influence, intimidate or impede a
juror, witness or officer in the discharge of his duty.
Smith was tried on May 3, 1994, and Minick testified
about his role as a witness in the Rachel Smith trial and
about the assault and battery at the bus depot. MAG, a wit-
ness to the conspiracy, testified to the occurrence of the
events on the night of July 30, 1993, including statements
made by Rhoden. Following the return of the verdict in
Rachel Smith’s trial, MAG and Rhoden went to a bar near
Rhoden’s apartment to drink. Smith, Smith’s mother, and
another woman arrived in a car about a half hour to an hour
later. Smith got out of a car where he had been sitting with
the two women and approached MAG and Rhoden. The
three of them had been working together for approximately
two months at Carl Weissman & Sons (a supply firm for con-
tractors), and they were friends at that time.
In an inexplicable excursion into fantasy, Smith told the
other two, specifically addressing MAG, “that there was a
guy that had lied in court and got the sister into trouble and
convicted her, whatever, and that he wanted me to beat her
up.” MAG quickly corrected the reference to “her” by stating
“him” in his testimony. Smith offered MAG fifteen dollars and
all the beer he could drink if he would beat Minick. MAG de-
clined the offer stating that he did not want to go to jail.Smith
then asked Rhoden if he would beat Minick. Rhoden did not
respond, and the five people then went to a different bar to
drink and to discuss beating Minick. MAG stated, at some
point, Smith’s mother said, “the person that testified against
the defendant’s sister would be at the bus depot that night.”
Around 8:00 or 8:30 p.m., Smith announced “they [Smith
and Rhoden] were going to go up [to the bus station] and
look things over and see if the guy was there, and he was
going to point the guy out for Dave [Rhoden] and just kind of
case it out and see if there was any cops there.” The two left
the bar and returned approximately forty-five minutes later.
During that period, Rhoden lured Minick outside the bus de-
pot and struck him in the face.When they returned to the bar,
Smith and Rhoden “were all revved up and pumped up that
they just did the job.” When asked what that connoted, MAG
explained, “They were happy. Before they parked the car
then, they came down Main and were going to turn left into
the bar, and they were yelling out the window and stuff, kind
of yahoo and all that.”
At the trial, the prosecutor and MAG then engaged in the
following dialogue, punctuated by an objection:

■
CHAPTER 6
Q: Okay. When they came back, did the defendant and
Mr. Rhoden tell you what had happened?
A:Yes, Dave—Dave did.
Q: Okay.
[Defense Counsel]: I have to object to hearsay on Mr.
Rhoden’s statement.
The Court: Overruled.
Q: (By [Prosecutor]) What—okay. What was explained to
you when they got back? Who was doing the talking?
A: Dave was.
Q: And what happened?
A: Dave said that he kicked the guys [sic] butt. I mean,
they were just revved up when they first got back. And
I said, you know, what happened? We all asked what
happened.
And Dave said that Dusty had pointed him out for
him and whatnot, and then he parked the car a block
away or so he wouldn’t be seen. And then Dave went
in and told the guy—the witness that he had car prob-
lems and asked him if he would come out and hold the
battery cable so he could get his car started. And I
guess he said it took him awhile to get the kid con-
vinced he needed help with it, and then the kid finally
went outside, and then that’s when Dave hit him and
then took off from there and then they came back.
Q: Okay. So—so the defendant—you said he pointed out
Mr. Minick in the bus station?
A: Right.
Q: And he went back to the car and Mr. Rhoden carried
out the plan?
A: Right.
Q: What was the defendant doing during the time that Mr.
Rhoden was—
A: I guess just waiting for Dave to show back up.
Q: Okay. Now, once—when you got back to the bar and
David Rhoden explained what was happening, what
was the defendant doing then? Did he ever—
A: He was happy and revved up about it and just kind of,
you know, going along with David’s story.
Q: Did he ever interject anything into the story or—
A: Not really. He just was—he seemed real happy.
Q: Okay. Now, once you were told this happened, did you
witness the payoff?
A:Yes, I did.
Q: Who paid?
A: Dusty paid, and his mom and this girl that was there
with them, they all whipped it out of their pockets, or
purses, or whatever.
Q: So they didn’t, like, take it out of a bunch of money on
the table, they actually—
A: No, no, they all pulled it out of their pockets.
Q: Did the defendant do that too?
A:Yes, he did.
Q: Took it out of his wallet?
A:Yes.
Q: Did you see actually how much was paid?
A: No, I didn’t. I just saw them all throwing the money on
the table to Dave.
Q: Okay. Was there anything else that was offered in the

A: Just the free beer.
Smith was found guilty by the jury.
. . .
The record demonstrates the agreement between Smith
and Rhoden that Rhoden would assault Minick for the
agreed consideration; the actual assault upon Minick by
Rhoden; and Minick’s status as a witness. The elements of
the charged offense were established.
The third issue posed by Smith relates to the admissibil-
ity of MAG’s testimony about Rhoden’s statements. The fo-
cus is upon those statements made subsequent to the
return of Smith and Rhoden from the bus depot where
Minick was assaulted. Smith first argues some of the state-
ments merely constituted a solicitation, and that does not
connote an agreement for purposes of a conspiracy. He
also contends Rhoden’s statements were mere bragging
and were not made in the course of, or in furtherance of, the
conspiracy which he argues ended with the assault upon
Minick. The State’s position is that Rhoden’s statements
were not hearsay and were admissible as statements of a
co-conspirator during the course of and in furtherance of
the conspiracy pursuant to WYO.R.EVID. 801(d)(2)(E).
We have consistently adhered to the concept articulated
in W. LAFAVE & A. SCOTT CRIMINAL LAW 460–61 (1972):
One might suppose that the agreement necessary for
conspiracy is essentially like the agreement or ‘meet-
ing of the minds’ which is critical to a contract, but this
is not the case. Although there continues to exist
some uncertainty as to the precise meaning of the
word in the context of conspiracy, it is clear that the
definition in this setting is somewhat more lax than
elsewhere. A mere tacit understanding will suffice,
and there need not be any written statement or even
a speaking of words which expressly communicates
agreement. * * *

Inchoate and Organized Crimes
■203
“Because most conspiracies are clandestine in nature,
the prosecution is seldom able to present direct evidence
of the agreement. Courts have been sympathetic to this
problem, and it is thus well established that the prosecu-
tion may ‘rely on inferences drawn from the course of
conduct of the alleged conspirators.’”
Given the evidence at Smith’s trial, we are satisfied there
was ample demonstration of a tacit understanding between
Smith and Rhoden.
Language in . . . cases . . . would seem to suggest the
conspiracy is concluded when the object of the conspiracy,
in this instance the assault upon Minick, has been accom-
plished.The argument of the State, however, is that this con-
spiracy continued until the consideration had been paid to
Rhoden. That view is supported by federal precedent.
United States v. Doyle, 771 F.2d 250 (7th Cir.1985); United
States v. Schwanke, 598 F.2d 575 (10th Cir.1979). Both of
these cases stand for the proposition that statements made
in connection with payments for assistance in furthering the
goals of the conspiracy are made before the last overt act of
the conspiracy has taken place. . . .
We hold MAG’s testimony about Rhoden’s statement
was not hearsay under WYO.R.EVID. 801(d)(2)(E), which is
adopted from the same rule of the Federal Rules of Evi-
dence construed in Schwanke. . . .
This rule, now so recurrent in criminal prosecutions, had
its origin, and finds its justification, in the laws of agency. . . .
In Hitchman Coal & Coke Company v. Mitchell, 245 U.S.
229, 249, 38 S.Ct. 65, [72], 62 L.Ed. 260 (1917), the court
explained:
“* * * The rule of evidence is commonly applied in crimi-
nal cases, but is of general operation; indeed, it origi-
nated in the law of partnership. It depends upon the
principle that when any number of persons associate
themselves together in the prosecution of a common
plan or enterprise, lawful or unlawful, from the very act of
association there arises a kind of partnership, each
member being constituted the agent of all, so that the act
or declaration of one, in furtherance of the common ob-
ject, is the act of all, and is admissible as primary and
original evidence against them.”
Three elements must be demonstrated before a state-
ment
can
be
admitted
as
nonhearsay
under
Rule
801(d)(2)(E), W.R.E. There must be evidence of a conspir-
acy;evidence that the declarant and the defendant both were
involved in the conspiracy; and a showing that the proffered
statements were made during the course of, and in further-
ance of, the conspiracy.The first two requirements insure that
the statements were in fact made by a coconspirator, and the
last introduces a measure of relevance and trustworthiness.
The record in this case demonstrates all three of the el-
ements discussed in Jandro have been satisfied.There was
evidence of the solicitation of MAG by Smith.There was ev-
idence of dialogue between Smith and Rhoden with respect
to beating Minick. There was evidence Smith and Rhoden
left the bar together prior to the assault upon Minick, and
they returned together. The record establishes evidence of
a conspiracy and evidence that Smith and Rhoden were in-
volved.We hold Rhoden’s statements were made during the
course of, and in furtherance of, the conspiracy because it
had not been completed until he had been paid the articu-
lated consideration. There was no error in the admission of
this evidence.
An independent basis is found in the law for the admis-
sion of the testimony about Rhoden’s statements. Courts
have recognized statements made by a coconspirator im-
mediately after, or close in time to, the accomplishment of a
criminal purpose of the conspiracy are admissible in order
to characterize the action of the party as res gestae of the
crime charged. The evidence of Rhoden’s statements was
admissible under this doctrine as well as under the usual
rule that it was made in the course of, and in furtherance of,
the conspiracy. . . .
No error occurred in the admission of the statements of
the co-conspirator, and the Judgment and Sentence must
be affirmed.

PROBLEMS WITH CONSPIRACY
Conspiracy has been called a “prosecutor’s darling,” an offense so amorphous that it
can be stretched to cover a wide range of circumstances, and, therefore, is subject to
abuse. It has been used interchangeably with complicity, as procedural convenience
or desired aggravation of penalties dictates. Political conspiracy is an area particularly
sensitive to abuse. Prosecutors can respond all too willingly to the political extremism
of the day, while overlooking this country’s bedrock principles of political freedom.
The decision in Dennis v. U.S. (1951) emerged from the first years of the Cold War
to uphold the conviction of Communist organizers for conspiracy to incite the violent
overthrow of the government. The “inflammable nature of world conditions” influ-
enced the Supreme Court to soften the requirement that prohibited speech pose a
“clear and present danger” to interests of the United States. In his dissent, Justice
Black wrote that the doctrine behind the decision

204

CHAPTER 6
waters down the First Amendment so that it amounts to little more than an admonition
to Congress. The Amendment as so construed is not likely to protect any but those
“safe” or orthodox views which rarely need its protection. . . .
Public opinion being what it now is, few will protest the conviction of these
Communist petitioners. There is hope, however, that in calmer times, when present
pressures, passions and fears subside, this or some later Court will restore the First
Amendment liberties to the high preferred place where they belong in a free society.
In another period when free speech became the crux of political conflict, Dr.
Benjamin Spock was convicted of conspiracy to aid in the evasion of selective serv-
ice laws after a speech against the military draft. His coconspirators were the hun-
dreds of applauding people shown in a videotape of the speech. This time the

appeals court overruled the conviction [U.S. v. Spock (1st Cir. 1969)], affirming the
possibility of political conspiracy but determining that specific intent was lacking
in this case.
IV.
SOLICITATION
Like attempt, solicitation has relevance only as an inchoate crime. It is the command
or inducement of another to commit a substantive crime. If that person agrees, at-
tempts, or actually commits the crime, solicitation charges against both solicitor and
solicitee usually merge with the appropriate charges of conspiracy, attempt, or sub-
stantive crime. In certain jurisdictions, however, a solicitation is regarded in itself as
attempt, and more generally so when the crime would be complete on the solicitee’s
acceptance. For example, an offer of money to a legislator for a changed vote would
be attempted bribery; an acceptance of that offer would complete the crime of bribery
and make the solicitation irrelevant. In any case, in order for solicitation to stand
alone, the target crime may not be committed nor attempted nor agreed on.
A police officer posing as a twelve-year-old girl received e-mail messages from a
man who discussed meeting her for sex and asked if he could pick her up. The man’s
conviction for use of a communications system for soliciting a minor in a sex crime
was affirmed in Brooker v. Commonwealth (Va. App. 2003).
As one might expect with such a lack of action, the actus reus of solicitation is sim-
ply words. The words must contain an inducement to action, however, rather than
simple approval or advocacy. It is not even necessary for the solicitation to reach its
target. A letter that gets lost in the mail can be incriminating for its writer. Use of an
intermediary party is also immaterial to the charge. In State v. Yee (Wis. App. 1990) the
defendant who asked a second person to get a third person to commit murder was
guilty of solicitation.
Because solicitation centers on the use of speech, the First Amendment can be a
factor. The question comes down to specific intent, the mens rea of solicitation. There
is a difference between Richard Craig in Case VI saying to the Haden Hills Home-
owners, “We really ought to do something about the gays in our neighborhood,” and
his saying, “Go at midnight tonight and shoot out their windows.” The area is still
fuzzy, with the line difficult to distinguish between a sincere call to action and hy-
perbole by a speaker on a roll. Compare this to the Spock conspiracy case.
Because solicitation is so far from the intended substantive crime, with an in-
dependent agent employed between the plotter and the action, it is considered by
some to be the least dangerous inchoate crime. Others consider the control of the
solicitor over the “hired gun” to be an insidious threat that makes the crime of so-
licitation much more dangerous than the crime of attempt. The Model Penal Code
finds it worthy of the same punishment as the target substantive crime, unless that
is a first degree felony. Some states prosecute solicitation of felonies and serious
misdemeanors only; others select only certain categories, such as solicitation to riot
or to commit bribery; and still others prosecute solicitation for all crimes, but allow
less severe penalties than those for the target crime. Federal laws target specific
situations, such as solicitation to commit violent crime, 18 U.S.C.A. § 373; to influ-
ence voting, 18 U.S.C.A. § 597; and to obtain improper political contributions, 18
U.S.C.A. § 602.
Renunciation of solicitation, where the offer is completely retracted from the so-
licitee, and the intended crime is prevented, is allowed as a defense by some state
statutes and federal statute 18 U.S.C.A. § 373(b). Some courts have found, however,
that since the harm is in the incitement to commit a crime, and solicitation is complete
with the asking, renunciation or withdrawal cannot undo it [State v. Boehm (Wis. App.
1985) and Moran v. Schwartz (Nev. 1992)]. Check to see whether renunciation is specif-
ically offered as a defense by your state statutes.

CHAPTER 6
V.
RACKETEERING INFLUENCED AND CORRUPT
ORGANIZATIONS (RICO)
A.
INTRODUCTION
We began the chapter with attempt offenses and the control of dangerous acts and
now arrive at the opposite end of the spectrum with statutes intended to control dan-
gerous people and organizations. A person working in established criminal enter-
prises in concert with other people is believed to present a greater threat to society
than the lone criminal. The growing spread of organized crime into legitimate busi-
nesses and organizations led Congress to pass the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations (RICO) Act in 1970, 18 U.S.C.A. §§ 1961 to 1968, prohibiting racketeer-
ing activity in interstate and foreign commerce. It has since been used broadly to pros-
ecute cases not always fitting the traditional profile of organized crime.
RICO convictions impose heavy penalties. Severe sentences and forfeiture of
property are assessed against RICO violators, and separate prosecution of predicate
RICO acts are allowed. RICO also provides in § 1964 for civil actions by the United
States and individual plaintiffs against defendants.
B.
RICO ELEMENTS
RICO crimes require the existence of (1) an “enterprise,” (2) that is involved in collec-
tion of unlawful debt or a pattern of racketeering or racketeering conspiracy, and
(3) the knowing participation in the enterprise by the defendant [U.S. v. Angiulo (1st
Cir. 1988)]. An enterprise can be “any individual, partnership, corporation, association
or other legal entity, or any union or group of individuals associated in fact although
not a legal entity” [18 U.S.C.A. § 1961(4)]. A pattern of racketeering is established by
the commission of two or more predicate offenses within ten years, excluding any
prison time [18 U.S.C.A. §§ 1961(5 and 6)]. Predicate crimes for RICO include murder,
kidnapping, gambling, arson, robbery, bribery, extortion, and dealing in obscene mat-
ter or controlled substances, which are chargeable under state law, and a long list of
acts indictable under federal law, such as wire and mail fraud, obstruction of justice,
money laundering, exploitation of children, bribery, and trafficking in pirated movies,
music, or computer software [§ 1961(1)]. Most federal racketeering convictions are
based on predicate gambling, drug, and extortion and threat offenses.5
In Scheidler v. National Organization for Women, Inc. (2003) the U.S. Supreme
Court ruled that abortion clinic protests do not constitute extortion under the
Hobbes Act, because no property is obtained. Without predicate acts, there is no
RICO violation.
RICO specifies four criminal violations.
Section 1962(a) makes it a crime to invest the proceeds of a pattern of racketeering
activity or collection of an unlawful debt in an enterprise affecting interstate commerce
[such as investing profits from illegal drug trafficking in a legitimate business]. . . .
Section 1962(b) makes it a crime to acquire or maintain an interest in an enterprise
affecting interstate commerce through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of
unlawful debt [such as an organized crime boss taking over a legitimate business
through extortion]. . . .
predicate offenses:
component crimes that are
the objectives of a collective
crime such as a RICO
offense.

What are the similarities and differences between the Model Penal
Code concept of unilateral conspiracy and solicitation?

Inchoate and Organized Crimes
■207
Section 1962(c) makes it a crime to conduct the affairs of an enterprise affecting
interstate commerce “through” a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of
unlawful debt [such as a car dealer using the facilities of the dealership to operate a
stolen car ring]. . . .
Section 1962(d) expressly makes it a crime to conspire to commit any of the three
substantive RICO offenses.6
C.
EXTENT OF CONTROL
Because the question of the extent of participation in the conduct of the enterprise is a
slippery one, the most frequently litigated RICO provision is 18 U.S.C.A. § 1962(c).7 On
one hand, a RICO violator does not need to occupy the “top rung” of the ladder of con-
trol in the enterprise, but on the other hand he or she must play at least “some part in
directing enterprise affairs” [Reves v. Ernst & Young (1993)]. Operating outside the chain
of command is not enough for a RICO violation, but defendants who collected loans
by extortionate means in a knowing implementation of enterprise goals were guilty of
substantive RICO violations [U.S. v. Oreto (1st Cir. 1994), cert. denied (1995)]. The court
in U.S. v. Diaz (2nd Cir. 1999) ruled that exercising “broad discretion” qualifies for
RICO, whereas simply taking directions does not. The defendants’ convictions were af-
firmed, because they had committed murder to further the narcotics business of their
street gang, then decided on their own also to kill a witness to the murder.
D.
RICO CONSPIRACY
A defendant can be convicted of RICO conspiracy under § 1961(d) even if the defen-
dant did not participate in the operation of the enterprise. Knowledge of the extent
of the conspiracy, however, is necessary for a RICO conviction. A handyman for the
leader of a racketeering enterprise who agreed to sell goods without knowing of the
broader conspiracy was not guilty of either substantive or conspiracy RICO charges.
The court in U.S. v. Viola (2nd Cir. 1994) said the handyman was not on the ladder of
control at all, but “sweeping up the floor beneath it.” RICO conspiracy also does not
require that acts in furtherance of the conspiracy be committed; it is an inchoate
crime. An agreement to facilitate commission of acts that would constitute a sub-
stantive RICO crime if they were completed is sufficient [Salinas v. U.S. (1997)].
E.
STATE ORGANIZED CRIME STATUTES
Most states have RICO statutes, often following the provisions of the federal statutes.
Some states have organized crime statutes requiring specific numbers of participants
or predicate acts. The Texas statute VTCA Penal Code § 71.01(a) requires a group of
three or more people intending to work together in a continuing course of criminal
activities. The court in Nguyen v. State (Tex. Crim. App. 1999) reversed an organized
crime conviction for a defendant who had worked with three others to commit mur-
der, because there was no evidence of a continuing enterprise.
VI.
CONTINUING CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE (CCE)
The federal Continuing Criminal Enterprise (CCE) statute, 21 U.S.C.A. § 848, was
passed in 1984 in an effort to reduce the amount of drugs on the streets. It targets the
“kingpins” who run trafficking operations and provides sentences of not less than
twenty years, heavy fines, and property forfeitures. A study from 1987 to 1990 con-
cluded that CCE offenders make up less than 1 percent of all federal drug offenders,
a well defined set of the most serious drug criminals.8 To be convicted as a CCE of-
fender, the defendant must hold an organizing, supervising, or management position
in a group of at least five other persons that has undertaken a continuing series of

208
■
CHAPTER 6
violations of United States drug control laws, at least one of which is a felony, and
from which the defendant derives substantial income or resources. The number of
participants and reference to income applies to the series of violations, not to each vi-
olation [Richardson v. U.S. (1999)].
The Richardson case involved a long series of predicate acts, and the jury dealt with
them collectively as being sufficient to constitute the required “continuing series of vi-
olations.” The Supreme Court, however, ruled that juries in CCE cases must agree on
several specific violations, because each is a separate element of the crime. The Court
suggested that three violations would suffice. U.S. v. Quintana (D. Utah 1993) required
jury unanimity on the five people involved with the defendant in the enterprise.
No separate, RICO-like entity is required for a CCE offense, but rather a more
loosely defined operation or undertaking. Read U.S. v. Quintana for that definition.
UNITED STATES v. QUINTANA
United States District Court, D. Utah, C.D. 1993
839 F.Supp. 1518 D. Utah 1993
[Citations omitted]
. . .
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
On September 10, 1993, Henry Willie Quintana, Jr., (“Quin-
tana”) was convicted of multiple counts of drug distribution
as well as engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise
(“CCE”). Quintana now urges this court to grant his motion
for judgment of acquittal on the ground that the evidence pre-
sented at trial was insufficient to support a CCE conviction.
The evidence was unrefuted that Quintana was involved
in trafficking large amounts of cocaine. The government
also presented unrefuted evidence that Quintana was sup-
plied cocaine by Juan Castanon and Richard Villanueva,
and that Quintana supplied cocaine for further distribution to
Randy Mondragon, Michael Fresquez and others. Randy
Mondragon, Michael Fresquez and Juan Castanon testified
that Quintana had no control over them, and that they did
not belong to an organization controlled or managed by
Quintana. Other persons involved with Quintana in drug
transactions included his father, Henry Quintana, Sr., Ro-
drigo “Chino” Alanis, Jose “Pepe” Lopez, Johnny Salazar,
Larry Cordova, “Ruben,” “Negro,” an unnamed person who
stored cocaine, and an unnamed person who delivered for
Quintana.
Extensive evidence was presented concerning drug dis-
tribution activities of Quintana. Much of the evidence was to
the effect that Quintana “organized” other persons in a con-
tinuing scheme to facilitate the distribution of cocaine. The
evidence with respect to Henry Quintana, Sr. was that Quin-
tana supplied Henry, gave him instructions concerning the
distribution and price of cocaine, and orchestrated deliver-
ies to him.The transactions with Henry provide sufficient ev-
idence that Quintana directed some unnamed person to de-
liver cocaine to Henry.The transactions with Henry also pro-
vide evidence that Quintana was fronting2 cocaine to two
men, “Pat” and “Larry,” for distribution. Wiretap evidence of
conversations between Quintana and Henry was to the ef-
fect that Jose “Pepe” Lopez delivered for Quintana, and that
Lopez expected instructions from Quintana.
The evidence with respect to Juan Castanon indicated
that he was one of Quintana’s suppliers and that Quintana
directed him concerning deliveries of cocaine. Mondragon
and Fresquez were distributors who were “fronted” by Quin-
tana. He arranged and confirmed deals with Fresquez. Both
Mondragon and Fresquez testified that Quintana was their
supplier. Quintana coordinated a deal between Fresquez
and Mondragon, and directed them how to divide the co-
caine. Quintana provided advice to Salazar about the co-
caine business and arranged deliveries to Salazar through
EvaValdez.Quintana admitted in conversations with Salazar
to paying an unnamed person to store cocaine for him, as
well as paying “Chino” for delivering. Evidence was pre-
sented to the effect that Quintana supplied a person named
“David” and that Richard Villanueva supplied Quintana.
The foregoing examples are typical of evidence pre-
sented by the government to show that Quintana played a
central role in interaction with others relative to the sale and
distribution of drugs.
. . .
2. In the drug business, the term “front” merely means to supply
contraband on consignment, i.e., a supplier provides a distributor
with cocaine on credit and the [distributor] does not pay until he has
resold the drugs, presumably for a profit.

Inchoate and Organized Crimes
■209
ANALYSIS
Quintana contests the sufficiency of the evidence to uphold
his conviction for operating a continuing criminal enterprise.
He contends that the evidence was insufficient to show that
he was an “organizer” or “supervisor” or that he occupied a
“position of management” with respect to five or more per-
sons. At the hearing on November 16, 1993, counsel for the
government conceded that its theory of liability was that
Quintana was an “organizer,” as distinguished from a “su-
pervisor” or a person in a “position of management.” Accord-
ingly, the determinative issue here is whether the evidence
was such that any rational trier of fact could have found Quin-
tana to be an “organizer” within the meaning of the statute.
Counsel for the government and for the defendant dis-
agree as to the meaning of “organizer” for purposes of the
CCE statute. Quintana argues and the government dis-
agrees that the term “organizer” necessarily requires some
type of managerial responsibility or influence. The parties
also disagree as to whether organizational activities must
be carried on through an “enterprise” as an entity, as op-
posed to engaging in prohibited acts apart from a structured
“enterprise.” Finally, there is dispute as to whether prosecu-
torial reference to persons who might have been “organ-
ized” by a defendant constituted prejudicial error.
I.
SCOPE AND MEANING OF THE TERM
“ORGANIZER” UNDER THE CONTINUING
CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE STATUTE
A person is engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise if:
(1)
he violates any provision of this subchapter . . . and
(2)
such violation is a part of a continuing series of vio-
lations . . .
(A)
which are undertaken in concert with five or more
other persons with respect to whom such person occu-
pies a position of organizer, a supervisory position, or
any other position of management, and
(B)
from which such person obtains substantial income
or resources. 21 U.S.C.A. § 848(c) (emphasis added)
A.
The terms “organizer,” “supervisor,” and “position of
management”are phrased in the disjunctive and each
term is ascribed its separate, everyday meaning.
Defendant argues that in the context of the CCE statute
an organizer must have managerial responsibilities in part
because the term “organizer” is modified by the statutory
language “or any other position of management.” Id.
§ 848(c)(2)(A) (emphasis added). Counsel for defendant
submits that under the statute a position of “organizer” is the
equivalent of an “other position of management,” hence, an
organizer must possess managerial responsibilities.
. . .
“Organize”means to “arrange or assemble into an orderly,
structured, functional whole; to manage or arrange system-
atically for united or harmonious action.” Webster’s II New
Riverside University Dictionary, 1984. “Manage” means “to
direct or control.” Id. An organizer, from the ordinary sense of
the word, is not necessarily a manager. On the other hand,
an “organizer” could also be a “manager.” The statute does
not require that a person charged with CCE must be both an
organizer and a manager, however. It is sufficient, under the
disjunctive language employed, simply to be an “organizer.”
B.
An “organizer” need not possess managerial re-
sponsibilities for purposes of the CCE statute.
“Organizer” status under the statute requires that defen-
dant occupy a central role in organizing the prohibited drug
activities. The central role need not include control or man-
agerial responsibility, but it must be more than a mere buyer-
seller relationship.
The Tenth Circuit, in Apodaca, defined organizer as:
a person who puts together a number of people engaged
in separate activities and arranges them in their activities
in one essentially orderly operation or enterprise. . . .The
ordinary meaning of the word “organizer” does not carry
with it the implication that the organizer is necessarily
able to control those whom he or she organizes.
Apodaca, 843 F.2d at 426.
. . .
In the case at bar, there was unrefuted evidence that
Quintana supplied and fronted drugs to Mondragon and
Fresquez, who were both distributors.The government also
presented evidence that Juan Castanon and Richard Vil-
lanueva supplied cocaine to Quintana. There is evidence
that Quintana directed Juan Castanon, “Pepe” Lopez and
one other unnamed person in drug deliveries. Quintana, on
a regular basis, directed Henry Quintana, Sr. as to the de-
livery, distribution and price of cocaine. Chino and at least
one unnamed person were in the direct employment of
Quintana. Evidence presented by the government was suf-
ficient to permit the jury to find that Quintana actually con-
trolled or managed Henry Quintana, Sr., Chino, Castanon,
and an unnamed person who stored drugs for Quintana.
Quintana facilitated and arranged for the supply and deliv-
ery of cocaine to all of the people discussed above and said
that he needed to collect from “everybody”.
The government was not obligated to present evidence
that Quintana actually controlled or managed all of these
people. The evidence was sufficient to convict if a reason-
able jury could find that Quintana played a “sufficiently cen-
tral role” in organizing at least five people in a drug
distribution operation or “enterprise.” The reasonable jury
impanelled in the case at bar could and did so find.
II.
THE CONTINUING CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE
STATUTE DOES NOT REQUIRE THE EXISTENCE
OF A SEPARATE ENTITY OR “ENTERPRISE”
By definition a person engages in a “continuing criminal
enterprise” under the statute if he or she participates in a

210
■
CHAPTER 6
“continuing series of violations” in concert with five or more
persons as to whom the defendant occupies a position of
“organizer, a supervisory position, or any other position of
management.” 21 U.S.C.A. § 848(c). Defendant urges this
court to interpret “enterprise” to require the existence of an
entity, similar to the “enterprise” required for purposes of the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act
(“RICO”). 18 U.S.C.A. § 1961 et seq.
The court rejects defendant’s conception of “enter-
prise.” It would violate the plain meaning of the statute to
define “enterprise” as requiring the existence of a separate
entity. The CCE statute equates “enterprise” with activities
or conduct which constitute a series of violations, not nec-
essarily requiring the existence of a separate or distinct
entity. “Enterprise” generally means an undertaking or a
project. . . .
The Fifth Circuit recognized that to establish a RICO vi-
olation, there must be “proof of the existence of the enter-
prise itself.” However, in contrast to RICO, the court noted
that the CCE statute “does not require proof of a RICO type
enterprise.”
Based upon the foregoing, this court concludes that no
RICO-type “enterprise” or other separate organization or
entity need exist in order for a defendant to be convicted of
engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise.
III.
JURY MUST UNANIMOUSLY AGREE AS TO THE
IDENTITY OF AT LEAST FIVE OTHER PERSONS
WHO ACTED WITH THE DEFENDANT
Quintana argues that the government’s closing argument
was prejudicial because the prosecutor named fifteen per-
sons who could be regarded as having been organized by
the defendant in the alleged continuing criminal enterprise
without clarifying which satisfied the statutory requirement,
and which did not.
The jury was given a unanimity instruction6 which required
the jury unanimously to agree upon the identity of at least five
persons with whom the defendant acted in committing a se-
ries of violations.The court does not believe that the prosecu-
tor’s closing argument rose to the level of prejudicial error. . . .
Based upon the foregoing, the court finds that sufficient
evidence was presented by the government to allow a rea-
sonable jury to have convicted Quintana as an “organizer”
under the continuing criminal enterprise statute. Accord-
ingly, it is hereby
Ordered, that defendant’s Motion for Judgment of Ac-
quittal is denied.
6. Jury Instruction No. 48 was as follows:
If you find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant com-
mitted a narcotics offense and that this narcotics offense was
part of a continuing series of violations of the narcotics laws,
then you must decide whether the defendant committed this se-
ries of violations with five or more persons.
The defendant’s relationships with the other persons need not
have existed at the same time, the five or more persons involved
need not have acted in concert at the same time or with each
other, and the same type of relationship need not have existed
between the defendant and each of the five or more persons.
The defendant need not have had personal contact with each of
the five or more persons involved.You must unanimously agree,
however, on the identity of at least five persons with whom the
defendant acted in committing the series of narcotics violations
alleged by the government.
VII.
CRIMINAL GANGS
Some states and municipalities aiming to control the criminal activities of gangs have
passed statutes and ordinances that are similar to continuing criminal enterprise
laws. Indiana’s law is an example of this approach.
INDIANA CODE
IC 35–45–9
Chapter 9. Criminal Gang Control
IC 35–45–9–1
Section 1. As used in this chapter, “criminal gang” means a group with at least five
members that specifically:
(1)
either:
(A)
promotes, sponsors, or assists in; or
(B)
participates in; or
(2)
requires as a condition of membership or continued membership; the
commission of a felony or an act that would be a felony if committed by an adult
or the offense of battery (IC 35–42–2–1).

Inchoate and Organized Crimes
■211
ANALYSIS PROBLEM
6–6.
Research suggests that dangerous behavior is not predictable. Com-
pare the value that our country places on freedom and presumption of inno-
cence to the value of inchoate and organized crime law in combatting
potential harm to society. Can you reconcile the two sides? Do you value one
side over the other? Consider the issue of freedom of speech.
IC 35–45–9–2
Section 2. As used in this chapter, “threatens” includes a communication made with the
intent to harm a person or the person’s property or any other person or the property of
another person.
IC 35–45–9–3
Section 3. A person who knowingly or intentionally actively participates in a criminal
gang commits criminal gang activity, a Class D felony.
IC 35–45–9–4
Section 4. A person who threatens another person because the other person:
(1)
refuses to join a criminal gang; or
(2)
has withdrawn from a criminal gang; commits criminal gang intimidation, a
Class C felony.
State v. Ochoa (Ariz. App. 1997) affirmed a conviction under Arizona’s criminal
street gang statute (A.R.S. § 13-2308) and upheld an enhanced sentence for felonies
committed with the intent to promote or assist the criminal conduct of a street gang
[A.R.S. §§ 13-105(7) and (8), and 13-604(T)]. At issue were seven criteria indicative of
gang membership, including tattoos and clothing, that the court held not to be un-
constitutionally vague because they are to be identified in conjunction with the crim-
inal activity of the gang.
Loitering and public nuisance measures are also used to keep suspected gang
members from exerting control over specific streets. Chicago’s broad Anti-Gang Loi-
tering ordinance was declared unconstitutionally vague in Chicago v. Morales (1999).
California prosecutors, however, have successfully defended the use of evidence
gathered against suspected gangs to get injunctions prohibiting specific behavior by
their members, such as carrying pagers or blocking sidewalks.9
VIII.
CONCLUSION
Inchoate crime laws allow for preventive law enforcement. Intervention may occur
to prevent suspects from completing the target crime without preventing their
prosecution.
Inchoate crimes approach the completion of the crime in increments, as shown in
the diagram in Exhibit 6–3. The chart gives you a picture of the proximity of the in-
choate crimes to completion of the crime. Solicitation is farthest from completion, re-
quiring only inducement of another person to commit a crime. Conspiracy, an
agreement with the other person, moves the process closer to the completed crime.
Attempt is closest, with statutes varying in their requirements of proximity to the
completed crime from “dangerous proximity” to “substantial step.” The distance of
the actus reus from the completed crime increases the importance, and sometimes dif-
ficulty, of determining mens rea. Success at any step merges into the next step toward
completion. Only conspiracy can be prosecuted as a separate crime if its target is

Special defenses for inchoate crimes often include abandonment or renunciation
before damage is done. Others include legal impossibility and, for conspiracy, the ear-
lier running of the statute of limitations for abandonment and the last conspirator de-
fense. Standard defenses to substantive crimes also may apply.
Group crimes range from conspiracy, requiring an agreement with another per-
son and sometimes an overt act, to RICO and CCE offenses that require an ongoing

APPLICATION ASSIGNMENTS
1.
If you were on the team prosecuting Thacker, who was charged with
attempted murder for shooting through a tent, what charge would you
recommend? Why?
2.
A gun was shot from a moving car several times toward a group of people
on the street. No one was injured. The shooter was charged with attempted
first degree murder by creation of grave risk of death. Is this an
appropriate charge? See State v. Dunbar, 817 P.2d 1360 (Wash. 1991).
3.
A nursing director speaks with two nurses about her concern for an infant
with severe birth defects in their care. She gives one of the nurses a bottle of
a deadly drug. Four days later, the baby dies as a result of the administration
of the drug. Should the nursing director be charged with attempted murder
in your opinion? Under Model Penal Code standards? Under your state’s
standards? [See Arias v. State, 593 So. 2d 260 (Fla. App. 1992)].
4.
A defendant was caught walking through backyards while in possession of
a pry bar, large screwdriver, two flashlights, and gloves. Does this satisfy
the substantial step requirement for attempted burglary? See
Commonwealth v. Melnyczenko, 619 A.2d 719 (Pa. Super. 1992).
5.
Can Lacey Rude in Case I be charged with attempt? Why or why not?
6.
A defendant completed the necessary acts for a conviction of attempted
burglary, but he walked away from the scene without completing the
crime. His departure was by a different route than his arrival, which
allowed him to avoid an approaching police officer. Was his abandonment
sufficiently voluntary to be a defense to the attempt charge? [See Thomas v.
State, 708 S.W.2d 816 (Tex. Crim. App. 1986)].
7.
A man intentionally tricked an undercover officer into paying him money
for cocaine that did not exist. Should this man be charged with conspiracy
to deliver cocaine? What are the issues of the case? [See State v. Long, 800
S.W.2d 507 (Tenn. Cr. App. 1990)].
8.
In People v. Brown, 277 Cal. Rptr. 309 (Cal. App. 1991), a defendant who had
agreed to commit robbery but whose only participation was to receive a
part of the loot had his conviction overturned because the act occurred
after the offense and did not fulfill the necessary “overt act” requirement.
Compare and contrast this decision with the concept of overt act presented
in this section of the text.
9.
Your supervising attorney assigns you the task of determining appropriate
charges in a new case. Facts show that the defendant transported an illegal

Inchoate and Organized Crimes
■215
alien, but the alien was working as a government informant immune to
prosecution. What are the most appropriate charges? [See U.S. v. Medina-
Garcia, 918 F.2d 4 (1st Cir. 1990)].
10.
Three persons conspired to commit kidnapping and murder for ransom.
The designated hit man became a government agent who would not carry
out the objective of the conspiracy. Should the other two be charged with
conspiracy? Why or why not? [See People v. Liu, 54 Cal. Rptr.2d 578 (Cal.
App. 1996)].
11.
The case of U.S. v. Falcone, 311 U.S. 205, 61 S. Ct. 204 (1940), is often used to
illustrate required intent in conspiracy. The defendant sold sugar and yeast
to known moonshiners. What did the Court need to know about the
transaction to establish intent? Without further evidence of involvement by
the defendant, how would you decide the case? On what case could you
base your decision?
12.
How would the Peoni and Backun cases (from the section on complicity in
Chapter 3) be decided if those defendants had been charged with
conspiracy?
13.
A defendant set up a transaction for “China white” heroin. An undercover
officer delivered a look-alike substance. Because the situation made it
impossible for the defendant actually to purchase heroin, did she have a
valid defense to an attempt to possess a controlled substance charge? [See
Grill v. State, 651 A.2d 856 (Md. 1995)].
14.
Over a period of time one person continually buys cocaine from another,
then resells it on the street. They have never made a verbal agreement in
the enterprise. Should they be charged with conspiracy? [See U.S. v. Moran,
984 F.2d 1299 (1st Cir. 1993)].
15.
The owner of a veterinary supply company corresponded by e-mail with
a chemist working for a competing company in another state, asking her
to “absorb as much information . . . as you can,” directed her research into
company information, and called her his “spy.” She sent by mail
computer software and test kits that were not considered actual trade
secrets. For what crimes could he be convicted? See U.S. v. Martin, 228
F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2000).
16.
The defendant tells an undercover officer that he wants to get rid of his
wife. That officer brings a second officer, whom the defendant pays to be
the assassin. Of the three inchoate crimes, which seems to be the most
appropriate charge in this case and why? [See People v. Adami, 111 Cal.
Rptr. 544 (Cal. App. 1973)].
17.
A defendant participated in a cocaine trafficking enterprise, not as the
operator of the enterprise, but by deciding how much cocaine to buy and
what prices and terms to charge to the lower-level distributors. Is this level
of control sufficient for a substantive RICO offense? [See U.S. v. Posada-Rios
158 F.3d 832 (5th Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 119 S.Ct. 1792 (1999)].

INTRODUCTION
A.
TYPES OF DEFENSES
Whether you work for prosecution or defense, it is essential for you to be aware of the
possible defenses that can prevent conviction on any particular charge. The group-
ings of defenses presented in this chapter are not universal, but may help you in con-
sidering defenses and how they work: constitutional and statutory defenses such as
statutes of limitations and protections against double jeopardy, justifications such as
self-defense, excuses such as duress and insanity, proof that an essential element of
the crime is missing such as alibi and intoxication, and various syndromes such as
battered person syndrome and posttraumatic stress disorder.
Other defenses especially connected to inchoate crimes, such as abandonment,
are covered in Chapter 6. Be sure to review those in the context of defenses in general.
B.
EFFECTIVE LEVEL OF DEFENSE
Even though a defense is successful, the defendant may not be free of criminal liabil-
ity. Some defenses are perfect defenses, leading to the dropping of charges or ac-
quittal if successful. The statute of limitations, self-defense, and duress may be among
these. Others are imperfect defenses, tending to allow conviction on a lesser included
charge. Intoxication may be used as an imperfect defense in specific intent crimes.
When an element of the defense is missing, that defense may still provide some pro-
tection to the defendant. A perfect self-defense requires that the defendant responded
to an unprovoked attack. If the defendant provoked the attack, then had to use deadly
force to defend against an unreasonable counterattack, the defense is imperfect but
effective in reducing the severity of the crime.
Mitigating circumstances are not defenses and do not affect conviction but may
influence a lighter sentence. Positive points about the defendant’s character or evi-
dence of a deprived childhood might help the court to decide that harsh punishment
is improper. Motive may be a mitigating circumstance but not a defense nor an ele-
ment of crime. Instead, it is the force behind the intent, the love behind the decision
to end the life of a terminally ill parent, for example. Evidence of motive may be im-
portant in establishing mens rea and, therefore, can affect conviction.
C.
BURDEN OF PROOF
The prosecution always has the burden of proving the elements of the crime beyond a
reasonable doubt. When a defense tactic is to claim that a requisite element is missing,
the burden remains with the prosecution to show that the element is, in fact, present.
In Case V of Chapter 1 the defense for Nancy and Lisa may say that the women had
no knowledge of the cocaine in their apartment, raising doubts about the mens rea el-
ement for the crime.ADUI defense may contend that the defendant was not the driver
of the car, raising doubts about an actus reus element. To prevail, the prosecution must
present sufficient evidence to overcome those doubts. The defense does not have to
prove that an element is missing; the prosecution’s lack of proof is determinative.
Affirmative defenses are matters separate from the elements of the crime that are
raised by the defense to counteract those elements. These could be called “Yes, but
. . .” defenses. Yes, the elements are provable, but there are circumstances that justify
or excuse the conduct of the defendant. Yes, the defendant killed the victim, but did
so in the execution of duties as a police officer. Yes, the defendant intended to kill the
victim, but insanity prevented awareness of the nature of the act. The affirmative de-
fense of accident was not allowed when the defendant did not admit to committing
the DUI offense charged in Stefanell v. State (Ga. App. 2003).
The burden of production, the responsibility to introduce an affirmative defense
and the credible evidence to support it, rests with the defense. See Chapter 12 for the
burden of production:
the responsibility to intro-
duce an affirmative defense
and the credible evidence to
support it.

Defenses
■221
burden of persuasion:
responsibility to convince on
all the elements of the claim.
preponderance of the
evidence:
the greater weight of all the
evidence.
sua sponte:
on its own responsibility, vol-
untarily.
pretrial requirements in raising such defenses as alibi, which is not usually an affir-
mative defense, and insanity, which is. In some jurisdictions, the defense has the fur-
ther burden of persuasion, the burden of proving the affirmative defense by a
preponderance of the evidence, the greater, convincing weight of all the evidence.
This is a lesser level than “beyond a reasonable doubt.” Some jurisdictions require the
defense to provide only “some evidence” in support of the affirmative defense claim.
In other jurisdictions, once the affirmative defense has been produced by the defense,
the burden of persuasion shifts to the prosecution to disprove the defense beyond a
reasonable doubt. This is the same responsibility and level of proof required for the
elements of the crime itself.
Many appeals on defense issues involve questions about jury instructions,
whether the defendant was entitled to a desired instruction on a particular defense
theory, or whether the instruction given was the proper one. Often the resolution of
these questions is based on burden of proof. Did the defense raise the affirmative de-
fense? Did the defense or prosecution meet the burden of persuasion? If the defense
meets its burdens, it is entitled to an instruction on the affirmative defense. It is al-
ways the better practice for the defense to request the desired instruction, but in some
cases, the court will offer the instruction sua sponte, on its own responsibility.
The burden of proof varies by jurisdiction and type of defense. In some cases, ju-
risdictions do not even agree on which defenses are affirmative defenses. In the fol-
lowing sections we consider the burden of proof on particular defenses. Requirements
in your jurisdiction may not be the same as the examples given, so be sure to check
your state’s statutes and case law.
II.
CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY DEFENSES
A.
INTRODUCTION
Constitutional and statutory defenses protect the defendant from infringements on
rights guaranteed to all citizens. These are not “loopholes” to be exploited by wily
criminals and their even wilier attorneys. Many of them come into play only in the
context of criminal prosecution; their purpose is to ensure that the accused—which
could be any of us—are not treated unfairly simply because they have been accused.
Federal and state statutes; the Constitution of the United States, primarily in the
Bill of Rights; and state constitutions all provide various forms of protection for the ac-
cused. Our constitutional freedoms are normally inviolate unless there are compelling
reasons for the government to regulate them, such as safety, health, or public welfare.
Procedural defenses provided by the Constitution are covered in following chap-
ters. This section focuses on the statute of limitations and substantive defenses to
criminal charges found in the First and Fifth Amendments of the Constitution.
AMENDMENT I
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the
free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of
the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of
grievances.
AMENDMENT V
. . . [N]or shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life
or limb; . . . nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law. . . .
B.
FREEDOM OF RELIGION
The First Amendment to the Constitution provides freedom of religion. Criminal
laws, however, aim to prevent harm to persons and property. When the goals of reli-
gion conflict with specific criminal laws, conflicting opinions result. Generally, the
“There is never a deed so
foul that something couldn’t
be said for the guy; that’s
why there are lawyers.”
—Melvin Belli Los Angeles
Times, Dec. 18, 1981

222
■
CHAPTER 7
greater the harm caused by a religious practice, the weaker is the defense of religious
freedom. For example, a prohibition against the handling of poisonous snakes was
upheld against the claim of religious exercise in Lawson v. Commonwealth (Ky. 1942). A
defendant claimed a Native American religious First Amendment right to take golden
eagles in violation of the federal migratory bird act. The court in U.S. v. Sandia (10th
Cir. 1999) found that because he had repeatedly sold parts of the protected birds for
profit without religious purpose, the protection of the migratory birds prevailed; his
conviction was affirmed. In contrast, the prosecution of an Amish driver for failure to
have a slow-moving vehicle sign on a buggy was held a violation of freedom of reli-
gion, and in particular a violation of the Amish belief against the display of emblems
and other symbols [State v. Herschberger (Minn. 1990)].
In the states that allow spiritual treatment of an ill child as an alternative to con-
ventional medicine in an exception to child abuse laws, the treatment must be offered
in good faith and must not jeopardize the child’s health. That line between acceptable
and unacceptable rejection of conventional medicine must be made clear in the
statute, however, to avoid denial of due process, Hermanson v. State (Fla. 1992).
As we saw in Chapter 5, drug laws are also affected by freedom of religion. In or-
der to preserve Native American culture, members of the Native American Church of
North America are exempt in some jurisdictions from statutes prohibiting peyote pos-
session. This exemption does not provide a defense to peyote use by members of other
non–Native American churches who practice peyotist religions, Peyote Way Church of
God, Inc. v. Thornburgh (5th Cir. 1991). Animal sacrifice was successfully defended as
free exercise of religion in Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah (1993).
Ten states have religious liberty laws that may broaden the use of freedom of re-
ligion as a defense, requiring the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling
governmental interest.
C.
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
Because freedom of expression runs to the very core of individual liberty and the
preservation of a free thinking democratic nation, freedom of speech and press are
constitutionally protected in the First Amendment. Any law that appears to abridge
freedom of speech in any form will be subject to the strictest scrutiny. In defining such
laws, the government has the burden of proving that a compelling state interest ex-
ists in regulating or prohibiting the speech.
A political refugee from Romania was convicted for harassment for making
racist, ranting complaint calls to a government official. Because the content of the calls
was primarily political, however, the expression was protected by the First Amend-
ment, and the conviction was vacated in U.S. v. Popa (D.C. Cir. 1999).
There are criminal statutes and cases, however, that do regulate freedom of ex-
pression. Schenck v. U.S. (1919) ruled that shouting “fire” in a crowded theater created
such a high risk of injury that this speech was not protected. Likewise, “fighting
words” likely to provoke a violent action from the listener were not protected in Chap-
linsky v. New Hampshire (1942). Saying “f_ _ _ you” to a police officer, however, was
protected speech in Diehl v. State (Md. 1982; cert. denied 1983). The theft of trade se-
crets or defense secrets by espionage is not protected by the FirstAmendment, because
the speech itself is the vehicle for the crime. Transmitting stolen defense secrets to the
press did not activate a freedom of speech defense in U.S. v. Morison (4th Cir. 1988).
As we saw in Chapter 5, freedom of expression is not a defense for obscenity un-
der Roth v. U.S. (1957) and Miller v. California (1973). In spite of the courts’ attempts to
establish standards for enforcement of obscenity laws, the standards themselves re-
main hard to fix. In 1991, Dennis Barrie, director of the Cincinnati Arts Center, was ac-
quitted on obscenity charges for displaying the photography of Robert
Mapplethorpe, including some child nudity and the depiction of homosexual acts.

scene but twelve jurors from the same community judged it to be art, clearly demon-
strates the problem with these standards and obscenity crimes in general.
Expressions of hatred also have involved free speech protections. Free speech was
the successful defense to cross-burning that overturned the hate crime ordinance in
R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul (1992), but hate speech coupled with further criminal action
was allowed as grounds for an enhanced sentence in Wisconsin v. Mitchell (1993).
D.
FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY
The First Amendment right to peaceful assembly may be a defense against some
crimes against public order. Occasionally, however, the right of a group of persons to
assemble and demonstrate under the First Amendment runs counter to the govern-
ment’s legitimate interest in order and safety. Court decisions permit limitations on
such constitutional gatherings only if there is a clear and present danger, such as ri-
oting or serious traffic congestion. Laws regulating time, place, and manner of as-
sembly are constitutional provided they do not defeat the purpose of the assembly,
but a law denying the right of peaceful protest on the grounds of the Supreme Court
building was declared unconstitutional in U.S. v. Grace (1983). A 1996 Cincinnati or-
dinance prohibited those arrested for or convicted of drug offenses from being in pub-
lic areas of “drug exclusion zones” where drug crimes occurred at a higher rate than
in the rest of the city. In Johnson v. City of Cincinnati (6th Cir. 2002), that ordinance was
declared unconstitutional as a violation of the freedom of association arising from the
Bill of Rights and discussed in Roberts v. United States Jaycees (1984).
E.
DOUBLE JEOPARDY
Double jeopardy is prohibited by the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution and pre-
vents the state from trying a person twice for the same criminal conduct. Absent such
protection, prosecutions could conceivably become the neverending story.
The underlying idea [in double jeopardy] . . . is that the state with all its resources and
power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an
alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and
compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity. . . .
—Green v. U.S. (1957)
Multiple prosecutions also give the state an opportunity to rehearse its presentation of
proof, thus increasing the risk of an erroneous conviction for one or more of the offenses. . . .
Even when a state can bring multiple charges . . . a tremendous additional burden is placed
on that defendant if he must face each of the charges in a separate proceeding.
—Grady v. Corbin (1990)
Double jeopardy is a far more complex consideration than meets the eye. Here is
a summary of key principles to note for more detailed study when the need arises.
1.
Jeopardy, the danger presented by a court proceeding that may result in
punishment, begins when the jury is impaneled or, in the case of a nonjury
trial, when the first witness is sworn in. Jeopardy usually ends when a
formal judgment has been entered. At trial for open murder, with the jury
absent, the defense moved for a directed verdict of acquittal on first degree
murder. The judge granted the motion, saying second degree murder was
a more appropriate charge, but did not formally enter the judgment or
notify the jury. The following day, the prosecution was allowed a
statement on the first degree charge, and the defendant was subsequently
convicted of first degree murder. Without “sufficient indicia of finality,”
jeopardy did not end with the motion for acquittal, so the continued
prosecution was not double jeopardy [Price v. Vincent (2003)]. Similarly, a
jeopardy:
the danger presented by a
court proceeding that may
result in punishment.

224
■
CHAPTER 7
question left open at sentencing does not end jeopardy. A defendant was
convicted of murder and given a life sentence when the jury deadlocked
on whether to give the death penalty. The defendant appealed and won a
second trial where he was again convicted, but this time given the death
sentence. Since there was no finding that the original life sentence was the
result of the prosecution’s failure to show aggravating circumstances
necessary for the death penalty, jeopardy did not end on that question, so
the subsequent sentence was not a violation of double jeopardy [Sattazahn
v. Pennsylvania (2003)].
2.
Double jeopardy applies when a person has been tried and a subsequent
charge covers the same conduct, victim, and elements as the previous
charges [Blockburger v. U.S. (1932)].
3.
Jeopardy applies to lesser included offenses and to attempted offenses that
merge with the completed crime [Brown v. Ohio (1977) and Harris v.
Oklahoma (1977)].
4.
Jeopardy does not apply to civil cases where elements are similar to a
criminal charge, such as civil damages for battery after having been
convicted for criminal battery.
5.
Though juvenile matters are technically civil, jeopardy occurs because of
the possibility of punishment.
6.
Jeopardy does not apply to convictions overturned on appeal or in the case
of mistrials by the defendant’s request. When mistrial is by the
prosecution’s motion and the defense objects, the prosecution must show
the manifest necessity of a new trial, such as purposefully improper
conduct by the defense.
7.
Some states follow the principle that all charges, with a few exceptions,
arising out of a single criminal act, episode, or transaction, must be joined.
8.
Acquittal or conviction on a lesser included offense forecloses trial on the
greater offense except:
a.
on postconviction discovery of new evidence supporting the
additional element of the greater offense, such as a felonious assault
charge on discovery that a victim’s injuries were more severe than first
diagnosed when the defendant entered a no contest plea to
misdemeanor assault;
b.
on defendant’s motion to sever (separate) the like charges; or
c.
where the lower court did not have jurisdiction to try the lesser
charges. Likewise, conviction or acquittal on the greater offense
prevents prosecution on the lesser included charge. A defendant
acquitted as an accessory before the fact in murder by hiring someone
to kill her husband, could not afterwards be tried on conspiracy to
commit murder charges. The process of hiring someone necessarily
includes an agreement, so the elements of the two crimes were the
same [Commonwealth v. D’Amour (Mass. 1999)].
9.
Under the dual sovereignty doctrine accepted in federal and some state
courts, one criminal act may lead to a trial in a Native American tribal
court, a state court, and a federal court without double jeopardy attaching.
The Supreme Court in U.S. v. Lara (2004) allowed the subsequent federal
prosecution of a Native American who had already pleaded guilty in a
tribal court to striking a federal officer. Prosecution in another jurisdiction
bars a second prosecution in some states, however.
The definitive case of Grady v. Corbin (1990) holds that a strict “technical compari-
son of the elements of two offenses as required in Blockburger does not protect defen-
dants sufficiently from the burden of multiple trials.” The crux of the matter is what
conduct, as opposed to what evidence, will be proved at the second trial. If the conduct
to be proven is essentially the same, double jeopardy applies. Grady held that a defen-

Defenses
■225
dant’s plea of guilty to a driving while intoxicated charge and failing to keep right of
the median barred a subsequent prosecution for vehicular homicide and related crimes.
Double jeopardy also provides a defense against multiple punishments when
two statutes have been violated by the same conduct, and when there is no legislative
intent to establish two separately punishable crimes. Sentencing for conspiracy to de-
prive civil rights, 18 U.S.C.A. § 241, and actually depriving civil rights, 18 U.S.C.A.
§ 242, was allowed even though the harm was the same because Congress intended
to establish two distinct and separately punishable offenses [Fonfrias v. U.S. (1st Cir.
1991)]. The conduct must be “unitary” for double jeopardy to occur. Because charges
for intoxication manslaughter and manslaughter arising from the same traffic acci-
dent with the same victim had not been properly joined, the defendant pleaded guilty
to both crimes. His conviction and sentence for one of the crimes was vacated in Ex
Parte Ervin v. State (Tex. Crim. App. 1999).
Conviction on two counts of robbery was not double jeopardy in Washington v.
State (Del. 2003), because the defendant formed separate intents when he took the vic-
tim’s silver chain and then, after commanding his dog to attack the victim, also took
his jacket and car keys.
The Supreme Court limited the use of the double jeopardy defense when a de-
fendant faces criminal prosecution after having paid civil fines for the same offense.
Hudson v. U.S. (1997) overturns a part of U.S. v. Halper (1989) that disallowed criminal
prosecution when fines and other civil penalties were considered grossly dispropor-
tionate or punitive. The Hudson Court, in a case involving violations of banking and
currency laws, ruled that subsequent criminal prosecution was not necessarily dou-
ble jeopardy when civil fines were imposed as a deterrence, and that “only the clear-
est proof” will show that the fine is at the same level as criminal punishment,
triggering a double jeopardy protection.
The doctrine of collateral estoppel prevents a retrial of a significant issue when
it was determined by a previous judgment. Thus, once a defendant was acquitted be-
cause he was not present at a robbery involving one of several victims, he could not
be tried for the robbery of another of the victims [Ashe v. Swenson (1970)].
F.
SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS
Guarantees of due process (fair laws and procedures) were written into the English
Magna Carta (1215 A.D.) to protect nobles from the power of the king. Accordingly,
one could not be imprisoned or harmed “save by the lawful judgment of his peers or
by the law of the land.” The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States
Constitution guarantee both procedural fairness (the focus of our attention in chap-
ters to come) and substantive fairness, also called substantive due process. Substan-
tive due process prohibits laws that are too vague, overbroad, unreasonable, arbitrary,
or capricious. A law is inherently unfair if it is too vague to provide citizens with ad-
equate notice of what conduct is prohibited. In Chicago v. Morales (1999) the Supreme
Court struck down a Chicago ordinance that prohibited loitering “with no apparent
purpose” in the presence of a gang member. Similarly, a law that proscribed the ex-
port of equipment that was of “special design” was “too vague to support criminal li-
ability” [U.S. v. Lachman (D. Mass. 2003)].
A law violates due process if it is so vague that it gives police unfettered discre-
tion to enforce it, which leads to arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. The gang
loitering ordinance in Morales was also struck down because its wording allowed po-
lice great discretion as to who was “loitering” and who was not. Criminal laws are to
be applied evenhandedly among all segments of the population.
Finally, a law violates substantive due process if it is so broad in its actual or likely
application that ligitimate constitutional rights can be violated. A Cincinnati law that
prohibited people from congregating on the street and engaging in conduct that is
collateral estoppel:
doctrine preventing the
retrial of a significant issue
when it was determined by a
previous judgment.

226
■
CHAPTER 7
“annoying” to passersby violated freedom of speech and, thus, was held unconstitu-
tionally overbroad [Coates v. City of Cincinnati (1971)]. The defense that a law violates
substantive due process holds government to a high standard of protecting individ-
ual liberty and is, therefore, an extremely important concept.
The PATRIOT ACT of 2001 (§ 806) suspends the defense of due process in the seiz-
ing of assets without prior notice if defendants are deemed to have engaged in or are
planning an act of domestic terrorism.
In some states, if a state law will be challenged in trial court, prior notice to the
state’s attorney general is required.1
Ex post facto laws, those criminalizing acts already completed, are barred by the
Constitution as a violation of due process, Article 1, sections 9 (federal) and 10 (states).
Justice Chase enumerated the types of these laws in the Supreme Court decision of
Calder v. Bull (1798).
1st. Every law that makes an action done before the passing of the law, and which was
innocent when done, criminal; and punishes such action. 2d. Every law that aggravates
a crime, makes it greater than it was, when committed. 3d. Every law that changes the
punishment, and inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed to the crime,
when committed. 4th. Every law that alters the legal rules of evidence, and receives less,
or different, testimony, than the law required at the time of the commission of the offence,
in order to convict the offender. All these, and similar laws, are manifestly unjust and
oppressive. In my opinion, the true distinction is between ex post facto laws, and
retrospective laws. Every ex post facto law must necessarily be retrospective; but
every retrospective law is not an ex post facto law: The former, only, are prohibited. . . .
There is a great and apparent difference between making an unlawful act lawful; and the
making an innocent action criminal, and punishing it as a crime.
Carmell v. Texas (2000) dealt with the fourth type of ex post facto law. A man was
convicted of fifteen counts of sexual offenses against his stepdaughter, based on her
testimony alone. Between the time of some of the offenses and the time of trial, Texas
had passed a law allowing the victim’s testimony alone to convict if the victim was
under 18 years of age. At the time of some of the offenses, however, the Texas law re-
quired corroborating evidence or the victim’s informing another person within six
months of the occurrence. The Supreme Court ruled that conviction on the counts at
issue violated the ex post facto clause, reversed, and remanded.
G.
RIGHT TO PRIVACY
In two landmark cases the United States Supreme Court confirmed that a right to pri-
vacy for each citizen exists even though such a right is not specifically mentioned in
the Constitution or the Bill of Rights. In Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), a criminal law
prohibiting the distribution of birth control devices or birth control information was
held unconstitutional. In so holding, the Court found that “specific guarantees in the
Bill of Rights have penumbras, formed by emanations from those guarantees that
help give them life and substance. . . .” Included in the penumbras was the right of
privacy that restricted governmental intrusion into its citizens’ bedrooms and birth
control practices. The source of the right, according to some justices, was the Ninth
Amendment and its reserving for the people those rights and powers not specifically
given to the government. Other justices found the law based in the due process con-
cept of personal liberty found in the Fourteenth Amendment.
In Roe v. Wade (1973) Justice Blackmun expressed the majority’s opinion that state
laws prohibiting abortions were an unconstitutional invasion of the right to privacy
and personal liberty anchored in the Fourteenth Amendment. The opinion finds the
state without a sufficiently compelling interest to invade a woman’s right to privacy
and freedom of choice in the first two trimesters of pregnancy. Only when the fetus
becomes viable in the third trimester does the state have a compelling interest in po-
tential life and may regulate abortions accordingly.
ex post facto laws:
laws criminalizing acts al-
ready completed, barred by
the Constitution as a viola-
tion of due process.

7–1.
What is the rationale behind longer time limits for the prosecution of
more serious crimes? Do you agree with that rationale? Is deterioration of
evidence less of a problem in more serious offenses?
The Court refused to dismantle Roe in Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992), although
further restrictions on abortion were allowed.
H.
STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS
State and federal laws protect suspects for most crimes from continuous threat of
prosecution, especially beyond a time when evidence for their defense may become
unavailable. A vehicle may be sold or junked; a letter may be lost; the mother who
could have said, “She was home with me on the night of the crime,” may have died.
Federal statutes place a five-year limit on most noncapital crimes but no limit on cap-
ital offenses (18 U.S.C.A. § 3281 et seq.). Limits vary by state and among felonies, mis-
demeanors, and violations. Check your state statutes for time limitations on
prosecution of specific offenses.
Generally, the time limitation period begins when the offense is committed, not
when it is discovered. As we have already seen in Chapter 6, the statute does not begin
to run on a conspiracy with the commission of the first overt act, but only when the con-
spiracy itself has come to an end or, for a particular defendant, when that defendant
abandons the conspiracy. Similarly, the statute does not begin to run on continuing of-
fenses like receiving stolen goods until the offense ends [State v. Lodermeier (S.D. 1992)].
The running of the statute ends with the issue of an arrest warrant or the filing of
a complaint or other charging document. The time period is interrupted, tolled, while
the suspect is a fugitive or is concealed. The statute of limitations defense is waived if
it is not raised as an affirmative defense before or during trial [Brooks v. State (Md. App.
1991)], or if a defendant pleads guilty to an indictment [Acevedo-Ramos v. U.S. (1st Cir.
1992)]. Note the effect of the tolling of the statute in State v. Houck, Chapter 8.
In some sexual assault cases where a DNA profile of the suspect is available but
that person has not been identified, some states and federal law [18 U.S.C.A. § 3282 (b)]
toll the statute of limitations if a John Doe indictment is issued within the applicable
time limit. Critics of these laws point out that the suspect’s due process rights may be
compromised by not being able to effectively challenge methods of collecting and han-
dling the DNA. Check your state law.
A1993 California law eliminated the statute of limitations on sexual abuse of chil-
dren under certain conditions, including when the prosecution is begun within one
year of a victim’s report to police. A later addition to the law allowing its retroactive
application was declared unconstitutional as a violation of the ex post facto clause in
Stogner v. California (2003).
III.
JUSTIFICATION
A.
INTRODUCTION
In claiming justification, the defendant admits responsibility for a harmful act but asserts
that the act was the right thing to do under the circumstances. Defending the innocent
against attack and carrying out public duties, such as enforcing arrest or waging war, are
justifications. These defenses are used exclusively in assault and homicide cases. Note
the balance that must be struck between the potential danger posed by the original
wrongdoer and the acceptable level of force used by the defender or public officer.

228
■
CHAPTER 7
B.
SELF-DEFENSE
1.
Elements
A successful claim of self-defense against a charge of homicide or assault includes
several elements. First, the attack on the defendant must have been unprovoked. For
a perfect defense, the defendant must not have caused or invited the attack by throw-
ing the first punch, or even by threatening or taunting the attacker. A jury instruction
on self-defense was not allowed in U.S. v. Branch (5th Cir. 1996), because there was
only the “merest scintilla of evidence” that the gunfire from government agents, who
had come to execute search and arrest warrants at the compound of a religious cult,
was unprovoked. The court emphasized that the defense had the burden of produc-
ing enough evidence that a reasonable jury could find in its favor before the instruc-
tion on self-defense, or any other affirmative defense, could be given.
Second, the attack must be imminent, that is, in progress or obviously about to
happen. Some states use the term present rather than imminent danger, allowing the
defensive force to be used before the attack is actually begun. Self-defense is not valid
against future attacks nor past attacks that can be referred to the criminal justice sys-
tem, but only for the present when the protection of the state is not available. Antici-
pation of a future attack cannot justify a preemptive strike in prison [U.S. v. Haynes
(7th Cir. 1998)], gang warfare [State v. Buggs (Ariz. Ct. App. 1990)], or family abuse
[People v. Sherman (Cal. App. 2002)]. Prolonged threats, such as abusive relationships,
can sometimes be used as a defense, however [K.L.T. v. Florida (Fla. Dist. Ct. App.
1990)]. See the section on syndromes at the end of this chapter.
Third, the force used is justifiable as a defense only if it is reasonably necessary to
repel the attack. One may not use a shotgun to defend against a slap in the face. Ho-
mosexual advances by the victims have been held to be insufficient to support self-
defense in murder cases [State v. Flowers (La. App. 1991) and State v. Bell (Wash. App.
1991)]. Deadly force is justifiable only against an attack that appears to threaten life or
serious injury. Most states apply an objective test to this element. Belief in the serious-
ness of the attack must be reasonable, and belief in the necessity of the defensive force
must be reasonable. A few states, however, use a subjective test, allowing an honest al-
though possibly unreasonable belief in the necessity of the defensive force. Where
statutes are not specific, courts must decide the reasonableness question. Factors in de-
ciding reasonableness include relative size, age, and physical abilities of the attacker
and defender, as well as whether the attacker is armed or has a reputation for violence.
If an attacker gives up the attack and withdraws in good faith, not to regroup for
another attack, he or she can then justifiably defend against a subsequent attack by
the original victim. If Kate Lamb from Case I sees her fleeing attacker duck into a
building, waits outside three hours for him to reappear, and then tries to kill him with
a pocket knife she has drawn from her purse and he retaliates with a fatal blow to her
head, he may justifiably claim self-defense.
2.
Imperfect Self-Defense
Self-defense, if all the previously described elements are present, is a perfect defense al-
lowing the defendant to be acquitted. An imperfect self-defense results when one of the
elements of self-defense is deficient. Perhaps the defendant precipitated the attack with
an elbow to the ribs. (A felonious attack by the defendant without withdrawal negates
any form of self-defense.) Perhaps the defendant honestly but unreasonably believes
that deadly force is necessary in a jurisdiction where reasonable belief is required. Such
an imperfect self-defense claim is used only in murder cases, where charges may be re-
duced to voluntary or negligent manslaughter, or in attempted murder [Bryant v. State
(Md. App. 1990)]. Or perhaps the force used was excessive under the circumstances.
3.
Retreat
The Model Penal Code and many states require the victim of an attack to retreat if that
can be done safely, rather than to resort to deadly force for self-protection. Where re-

Defenses
■229
treat is required, the attack must appear likely to cause death or serious injury, re-
quiring self-defense of deadly force, and retreat in complete safety must be possible.
If even minor injuries would result from the retreat, the person being attacked is usu-
ally allowed to stand his or her ground [State v. Anderson (Conn. 1993)]. Under the cas-
tle doctrine, the belief that “a man’s home is his castle,” defenders need not retreat in
their own homes. A defendant convicted of second degree murder won a new trial on
the ruling that he did not have to retreat from an intruder in his own home, particu-
larly because he suffered from disabling arthritis that would have made his retreat
hazardous [State v. Fetzik (R.I. 1992)]. A substantial number of states reject all “retreat
to the wall” requirements, however, with the rationale that innocent people should
not be forced to take a cowardly or humiliating position. In these states, a person who
is attacked may defend with force anywhere.
4.
People v. Goetz
As you read the case of People v. Goetz (N.Y. 1986), note the “triggering conditions”
that allow the justification of self-defense under New York law. Also follow the dis-
cussion of “reasonable” as an objective or subjective requirement. After this decision
was returned, Goetz was tried and acquitted for attempted murder and assault, but
he was convicted and jailed one year on a weapons charge.

Opinion of the Court
[Citations omitted]
CHIEF JUDGE WACHTLER.
A Grand Jury has indicted defendant on attempted murder,
assault, and other charges for having shot and wounded
four youths on a New York City subway train after one or two
of the youths approached him and asked for $5. The lower
courts, concluding that the prosecutor’s charge to the Grand
Jury on the defense of justification was erroneous, have dis-
missed the attempted murder, assault and weapons pos-
session charges.We now reverse and reinstate all counts of
the indictment.
I.
The precise circumstances of the incident giving rise to the
charges against defendant are disputed, and ultimately it
will be for a trial jury to determine what occurred. We feel it
necessary, however, to provide some factual background to
properly frame the legal issues before us. Accordingly, we
have summarized the facts as they appear from the evi-
dence before the Grand Jury. We stress, however, that we
do not purport to reach any conclusions or holding as to ex-
actly what transpired or whether defendant is blameworthy.
The credibility of witnesses and the reasonableness of de-
fendant’s conduct are to be resolved by the trial jury.
On Saturday afternoon, December 22, 1984, Troy Canty,
Darryl Cabey, James Ramseur, and Barry Allen boarded an
IRT express subway train in The Bronx and headed south
toward lower Manhattan. The four youths rode together in
the rear portion of the seventh car of the train. Two of the
four, Ramseur and Cabey, had screwdrivers inside their
coats, which they said were to be used to break into the coin
boxes of video machines.
Defendant Bernhard Goetz boarded this subway train at
14th Street in Manhattan and sat down on a bench towards
the rear section of the same car occupied by the four youths.
Goetz was carrying an unlicensed .38 caliber pistol loaded
with five rounds of ammunition in a waistband holster. The
train left the 14th Street station and headed towards Cham-
bers Street.
It appears from the evidence before the Grand Jury that
Canty approached Goetz, possibly with Allen beside him,
and stated “give me five dollars”. Neither Canty nor any of
the other youths displayed a weapon. Goetz responded by
standing up, pulling out his handgun and firing four shots in
rapid succession. The first shot hit Canty in the chest; the
second struck Allen in the back; the third went through Ram-
seur’s arm and into his left side; the fourth was fired at
Cabey, who apparently was then standing in the corner of

230
■
CHAPTER 7
the car, but missed, deflecting instead off of a wall of the
conductor’s cab. After Goetz briefly surveyed the scene
around him, he fired another shot at Cabey, who then was
sitting on the end bench of the car. The bullet entered the
rear of Cabey’s side and severed his spinal cord.
. . . Ramseur and Canty, initially listed in critical condition,
have fully recovered. Cabey remains paralyzed, and has
suffered some degree of brain damage.
On December 31, 1984, Goetz surrendered to police in
Concord, New Hampshire, identifying himself as the gun-
man being sought for the subway shootings in New York
nine days earlier. Later that day, after receiving Miranda
warnings, he made two lengthy statements, both of which
were tape recorded with his permission. In the statements,
which are substantially similar, Goetz admitted that he had
been illegally carrying a handgun in New York City for three
years. He stated that he had first purchased a gun in 1981
after he had been injured in a mugging. Goetz also revealed
that twice between 1981 and 1984 he had successfully
warded off assailants simply by displaying the pistol.
According to Goetz’s statement, the first contact he had
with the four youths came when Canty, sitting or lying on the
bench across from him, asked “how are you,” to which he
replied “fine”. Shortly thereafter, Canty, followed by one of
the other youths, walked over to the defendant and stood to
his left, while the other two youths remained to his right, in
the corner of the subway car. Canty then said “give me five
dollars”. Goetz stated that he knew from the smile on
Canty’s face that they wanted to “play with me”. Although he
was certain that none of the youths had a gun, he had a fear,
based on prior experiences, of being “maimed”.
Goetz then established “a pattern of fire,” deciding specif-
ically to fire from left to right. His stated intention at that point
was to “murder [the four youths], to hurt them, to make them
suffer as much as possible”. When Canty again requested
money, Goetz stood up, drew his weapon, and began firing,
aiming for the center of the body of each of the four.Goetz re-
called that the first two he shot “tried to run through the crowd
[but] they had nowhere to run”. Goetz then turned to his right
to “go after the other two”. One of these two “tried to run
through the wall of the train, but * * * he had nowhere to go”.
The other youth (Cabey) “tried pretending that he wasn’t with
[the others]” by standing still, holding on to one of the subway
hand straps, and not looking at Goetz. Goetz nonetheless
fired his fourth shot at him. He then ran back to the first two
youths to make sure they had been “taken care of”. Seeing
that they had both been shot, he spun back to check on the
latter two. Goetz noticed that the youth who had been stand-
ing still was now sitting on a bench and seemed unhurt. As
Goetz told the police, “I said ‘[y]ou seem to be all right, here’s
another’ ”, and he then fired the shot which severed Cabey’s
spinal cord.Goetz added that “if I was a little more under self-
control * * * I would have put the barrel against his forehead
and fired.” He also admitted that “if I had had more [bullets], I
would have shot them again, and again, and again.”
II.
. . . On January 25, 1985, the Grand Jury indicted defendant
on one count of criminal possession of a weapon in the third
degree, for possessing the gun used in the subway shoot-
ings, and two counts of criminal possession of a weapon in
the fourth degree, for possessing two other guns in his apart-
ment building. It dismissed, however, the attempted murder
and other charges stemming from the shootings themselves.
Several weeks after the Grand Jury’s action, the People,
asserting that they had newly available evidence, moved for
an order authorizing them to resubmit the dismissed
charges to a second Grand Jury. . . .
On March 27, 1985, the second Grand Jury filed a 10-
count indictment, containing four charges of attempted mur-
der, four charges of assault in the first degree, one charge of
reckless endangerment in the first degree, and one charge of
criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree.Goetz
was arraigned on this indictment on March 28, 1985, and it
was consolidated with the earlier three-count indictment.
On October 14, 1985, Goetz moved to dismiss the
charges contained in the second indictment alleging, among
other things, that the evidence before the second Grand Jury
was not legally sufficient to establish the offenses charged,
and that the prosecutor’s instructions to that Grand Jury on
the defense of justification were erroneous and prejudicial to
the defendant so as to render its proceedings defective. . . .
In an order dated January 21, 1986, Criminal Term
granted Goetz’s motion to the extent that it dismissed all
counts of the second indictment, other than the reckless en-
dangerment charge, with leave to resubmit these charges to
a third Grand Jury. The court, after inspection of the Grand
Jury minutes, first rejected Goetz’s contention that there
was not legally sufficient evidence to support the charges. It
held, however, that the prosecutor, in a supplemental
charge elaborating upon the justification defense, had erro-
neously introduced an objective element into this defense
by instructing the grand jurors to consider whether Goetz’s
conduct was that of a “reasonable man in [Goetz’s] situa-
tion”. The court . . . concluded that the statutory test for
whether the use of deadly force is justified to protect a per-
son should be wholly subjective, focusing entirely on the de-
fendant’s state of mind when he used such force. It
concluded that dismissal was required for this error because
the justification issue was at the heart of the case.2 . . .
2. The court did not dismiss the reckless endangerment charge be-
cause, relying on the Appellate Division decision in People v. Mc-
Manus, 108 A.D.2d 474, 489 N.Y.S.2d 561, it held that justification
was not a defense to a crime containing, as an element, “depraved
indifference to human life.” As our reversal of the Appellate Division
in McManus holds, justification is a defense to such a crime (People
v. McManus, 67 N.Y.2d 541, 505 N.Y.S.2d 43, 496 N.E.2d 202). Ac-
cordingly, had the prosecutor’s instructions on justification actually
rendered the Grand Jury proceedings defective, dismissal of the
reckless endangerment count would have been required as well.

Defenses
■231
On appeal by the People, a divided Appellate Division af-
firmed Criminal Term’s dismissal of the charges. . . .
Justice Asch granted the People leave to appeal to this
court. We agree with the dissenters that neither the prose-
cutor’s charge to the Grand Jury on justification nor the in-
formation which came to light while the motion to dismiss
was pending required dismissal of any of the charges in the
second indictment.
III.
Penal Law article 35 recognizes the defense of justification,
which “permits the use of force under certain circum-
stances.” One such set of circumstances pertains to the use
of force in defense of a person, encompassing both self-
defense and defense of a third person (Penal Law § 35.15).
Penal Law § 35.15(1) sets forth the general principles gov-
erning all such uses of force: “[a] person may * * * use phys-
ical force upon another person when and to the extent he
reasonably believes such to be necessary to defend himself
or a third person from what he reasonably believes to be the
use or imminent use of unlawful physical force by such other
person” (emphasis added).3
Section 35.15(2) sets forth further limitations on these
general principles with respect to the use of “deadly physi-
cal force”:“A person may not use deadly physical force upon
another person under circumstances specified in subdivi-
sion one unless (a) He reasonably believes that such other
person is using or about to use deadly physical force * * *[4]
or (b) He reasonably believes that such other person is com-
mitting or attempting to commit a kidnapping, forcible rape,
forcible sodomy or robbery” (emphasis added).
Thus, consistent with most justification provisions, Penal
Law § 35.15 permits the use of deadly physical force only
where requirements as to triggering conditions and the ne-
cessity of a particular response are met. As to the trigger-
ing
conditions,
the
statute
requires
that
the
actor
“reasonably believes” that another person either is using or
about to use deadly physical force or is committing or at-
tempting to commit one of certain enumerated felonies, in-
cluding robbery. As to the need for the use of deadly
physical force as a response, the statute requires that the
actor “reasonably believes” that such force is necessary to
avert the perceived threat.
Because the evidence before the second Grand Jury in-
cluded statements by Goetz that he acted to protect himself
from being maimed or to avert a robbery, the prosecutor cor-
rectly chose to charge the justification defense in section
35.15 to the Grand Jury. . . .
When the prosecutor had completed his charge, one of
the grand jurors asked for clarification of the term “reason-
ably believes”. The prosecutor responded by instructing the
grand jurors that they were to consider the circumstances of
the incident and determine “whether the defendant’s conduct
was that of a reasonable man in the defendant’s situation”. It
is this response by the prosecutor—and specifically his use
of “a reasonable man”—which is the basis for the dismissal
of the charges by the lower courts. As expressed repeatedly
in the Appellate Division’s plurality opinion, because section
35.15 uses the term “he reasonably believes”, the appropri-
ate test, according to that court, is whether a defendant’s be-
liefs and reactions were “reasonable to him”. Under that
reading of the statute, a jury which believed a defendant’s
testimony that he felt that his own actions were warranted
and were reasonable would have to acquit him, regardless
of what anyone else in defendant’s situation might have con-
cluded. Such an interpretation defies the ordinary meaning
and significance of the term “reasonably” in a statute, and
misconstrues the clear intent of the Legislature, in enacting
section 35.15, to retain an objective element as part of any
provision authorizing the use of deadly physical force. . . .
We cannot lightly impute to the Legislature an intent to
fundamentally alter the principles of justification to allow the
perpetrator of a serious crime to go free simply because that
person believed his actions were reasonable and necessary
to prevent some perceived harm. To completely exonerate
such an individual, no matter how aberrational or bizarre his
thought patterns, would allow citizens to set their own stan-
dards for the permissible use of force. It would also allow a
legally competent defendant suffering from delusions to kill
or perform acts of violence with impunity, contrary to funda-
mental principles of justice and criminal law.
We can only conclude that the Legislature retained a rea-
sonableness requirement to avoid giving a license for such
actions. . . .
Statutes or rules of law requiring a person to act “rea-
sonably” or to have a “reasonable belief” uniformly prescribe
conduct meeting an objective standard measured with ref-
erence to how “a reasonable person” could have acted. . . .
Goetz also argues that the introduction of an objective el-
ement will preclude a jury from considering factors such as
the prior experiences of a given actor and thus, require it to
make a determination of “reasonableness” without regard to
the actual circumstances of a particular incident. This argu-
ment, however, falsely presupposes that an objective stan-
dard
means
that
the
background
and
other
relevant
characteristics of a particular actor must be ignored. To the
contrary, we have frequently noted that a determination of
reasonableness must be based on the “circumstances” facing
a defendant or his “situation.” Such terms encompass more
than the physical movements of the potential assailant. As
just discussed, these terms include any relevant knowledge
3. Subdivision (1) contains certain exceptions to this general au-
thorization to use force, such as where the actor himself was the ini-
tial aggressor.
4. Section 35.15(2)(a) further provides, however, that even under
these circumstances a person ordinarily must retreat “if he knows
that he can with complete safety as to himself and others avoid the
necessity of [using deadly physical force] by retreating.”

CHAPTER 7
ANALYSIS PROBLEM
7–2.
Do you think the “objective” definition of “reasonable” in the Goetz
case in New York would be different from that in a quiet, small town? Do
you think Goetz was entitled to a self-defense claim? Do you think Goetz’s
self-defense was “premeditated?”
the defendant had about that person. They also necessarily
bring in the physical attributes of all persons involved, includ-
ing the defendant. Furthermore, the defendant’s circum-
stances encompass any prior experiences he had which
could provide a reasonable basis for a belief that another per-
son’s intentions were to injure or rob him or that the use of
deadly force was necessary under the circumstances.
Accordingly, a jury should be instructed to consider this
type of evidence in weighing the defendant’s actions. The
jury must first determine whether the defendant had the req-
uisite beliefs under section 35.15, that is, whether he be-
lieved deadly force was necessary to avert the imminent use
of deadly force or the commission of one of the felonies enu-
merated therein. If the People do not prove beyond a rea-
sonable doubt that he did not have such beliefs, then the
jury must also consider whether these beliefs were reason-
able.The jury would have to determine, in light of all the “cir-
cumstances”, as explicated above, if a reasonable person
could have had these beliefs.
The prosecutor’s instruction to the second Grand Jury
that it had to determine whether, under the circumstances,
Goetz’s conduct was that of a reasonable man in his situa-
tion was thus essentially an accurate charge. It is true that
the prosecutor did not elaborate on the meaning of “circum-
stances” or “situation” and inform the grand jurors that they
could consider, for example, the prior experiences Goetz re-
lated in his statement to the police. We have held, however,
that a Grand Jury need not be instructed on the law with the
same degree of precision as the petit jury. This lesser stan-
dard is premised upon the different functions of the Grand
Jury and the petit jury: the former determines whether suffi-
cient evidence exists to accuse a person of a crime and
thereby subject him to criminal prosecution; the latter ulti-
mately determines the guilt or innocence of the accused,
and may convict only where the People have proven his guilt
beyond a reasonable doubt. . . .
Of course, as noted above, where the evidence suggests
that a complete defense such as justification may be pres-
ent, the prosecutor must charge the grand jurors on that de-
fense, providing enough information to enable them to
determine whether the defense, in light of the evidence,
should preclude the criminal prosecution. The prosecutor
more than adequately fulfilled this obligation here. . . . The
Grand Jury has indicted Goetz.It will now be for the petit jury
to decide whether the prosecutor can prove beyond a rea-
sonable doubt that Goetz’s reactions were unreasonable
and therefore excessive.
. . . Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should
be reversed, and the dismissed counts of the indictment re-
instated.
C.
DEFENSE OF THIRD PERSONS
Self-defense logically extends to the defense of third parties. A person generally has
the right to protect others whose circumstances would allow self-defense. Neither
the one who is being attacked nor the defender may have provoked the attack, and
the force used must be reasonable. Some states adhere to the common law rule that
one may defend only members of one’s own household, but most jurisdictions al-
low a defender to “stand in the shoes of the victim” in defending anyone who is un-
der attack.
In Commonwealth v. Johnson (Mass. 1992), the victim took a gun from the defen-
dant’s companion, held it to the defendant’s head, then left. The defendant and com-
panion followed, then the victim attacked the companion, wrestling him to the
ground and smashing his head repeatedly on the pavement. The defendant pried the
gun from the victim’s hand, tried to pull him off his companion, then shot him. His
murder conviction was reversed and remanded for a new trial, because the jury in-
struction did not distinguish between the justification of reasonable self-defense that

Defenses
■233
would relieve the defendant of all liability, and the imperfect self-defense of unrea-
sonable force that would reduce the conviction to manslaughter.
D.
DEFENSE OF PROPERTY
Reasonable force may usually be used to defend property against such crimes as trespass,
theft, or destruction. The wrongdoer’s life is considered more valuable than property,
however, so deadly force is not usually allowed in the protection of property. Habitation,
however, may be defended with deadly force under some circumstances in some states
as another aspect of the castle doctrine. Usually, the defender must reasonably believe
that the intruder into his or her home intends to commit a felony. Bishop v. State (Ga. 1987)
affirmed the murder conviction of a defendant who protected his home with a trap gun
that caused the death of an intruder. The defense of protection of habitation did not suc-
ceed because the defendant could not form a reasonable belief that the intruder was en-
tering to commit a felony, because the defendant was not present at the time of the
shooting. An overnight guest had the equivalent of the householder’s privilege to resist
unlawful police entry to the bedroom he occupied [State v. Brosnan (Conn. 1992)].
E.
RESISTING UNLAWFUL ARREST
Dreadful prison conditions and the unavailability of bail made resisting unlawful ar-
rest an acceptable defense to assault charges in the past. Some states still allow rea-
sonable, nondeadly force to resist unlawful arrest, with restrictions on circumstances
varying by jurisdiction. Movement seems to be in the direction of Model Penal Code
§ 3.04(2)(a)(i), providing no defense for force used against a known police officer. This
rule quells the likely escalation of violence and encourages use of courts for redress.
Because an unlawful arrest is not within the lawful performance of police duties, re-
sistance to it may be charged with simple assault rather than aggravated assault, or a
lesser degree of homicide.
An arrestee is allowed to defend against excessive force or injury by a police offi-
cer if the result would be a permanent injury that could not be rectified through the
courts. An African American defendant was followed and harassed by a police offi-
cer, then stopped for failing to use a turn signal. In the ensuing arrest, the officer used
a racial epithet, threw the defendant on a car, beat him with a flashlight, and put him
in a chokehold so he could not breathe. At this point, the defendant resisted the ar-
rest. Darty v. State (Tx. App. 1999) ruled that the defendant was entitled to a jury in-
struction on the necessity of his resistance.
F.
EXECUTION OF PUBLIC DUTIES
Our society has authorized certain public officers to use force against people in cer-
tain situations, and even to take life. Soldiers, executioners, and police are not pun-
ished for fulfilling their prescribed roles. Restrictions do apply, though, and vary by
jurisdiction. Most require care that innocent bystanders are not put in jeopardy, that
deadly force is not used to apprehend a misdemeanant, and, sometimes, that deadly
force is used only in response to deadly force by the arrestee.
A teenage unarmed suspect fleeing the scene of a nonviolent crime was shot and
killed by police. The resulting decision restricted the use of force by police.
The use of deadly force to prevent the escape of all felony suspects, whatever the
circumstances, is constitutionally unreasonable. It is not better that all felony suspects
die than that they escape. Where the suspect poses no immediate threat to the officer and
no threat to others, the harm resulting from failing to apprehend him does not justify
the use of deadly force to do so.
—Tennessee v. Garner (1985)

234
■
CHAPTER 7
Most states limit the use of deadly force by police to arrests when there is sub-
stantial risk that the person to be arrested will cause death or serious bodily harm, such
as when that person has committed a violent felony or is armed with a deadly weapon.
G.
PARENTAL DISCIPLINE JUSTIFICATION
Parental discipline is a defense to child abuse charges when that discipline is reason-
able. A father who grabbed his nine-year-old son’s shoulder and told him to shut up
when he was talking too much and exaggerating was entitled to the parental disci-
pline justification as a defense to the charge of assault in State v. Wilder (Me. 2000). For
the justification to be denied, the court required:
1.
that the physical harm was greater than transient pain and temporary marks,
2.
that the force was reckless,
3.
that the defendant’s belief that the force was necessary to control and
prevent misconduct was a gross deviation from what a reasonable and
prudent parent would have believed.
The father’s conviction for assault was reversed.
The decision in State v. York (Me. 2001), however, did not allow the justification
because the father threw his nine-year-old daughter across a bed, injuring her head
seriously enough that the bruise was visible days later. Throwing a child results in the
parent’s loss of control of the outcome, making it a reckless act. Several states, in-
cluding Washington, Delaware, and Minnesota specifically eliminate throwing as a
legitimate method of punishment for children.
IV.
EXCUSE
A.
INTRODUCTION
Whereas justifications offer defenses against charges of assault and homicide, excuses
offer defenses to a wide range of crimes. Excuses are affirmative defenses that assert
the defendant was forced by circumstances to commit the unlawful act as the “lesser
of two evils,” or was otherwise not responsible under the circumstances, though all
the elements of the crime are present.
B.
DURESS
Threat of imminent or present great physical harm plus the demand that the defendant
commit the specific offense charged amounts to duress. This defense places liability for
the crime on the one who enforces the threat, not the one who performs the act. When
duress seems to be clear, the actor is seldom prosecuted, but is treated as a victim.
States vary in their requirements for the defense of duress. Duress is never an excuse
for intentionally taking the life of an innocent person; some states allow it to excuse only
minor crimes. Some require a threat of instant death, others include less immediate
threats and threats of serious bodily harm, or even threats to third parties. A threat to
property or reputation is not duress. Duress is generally measured by an objective stan-
dard, that the defendant reasonably believed the seriousness of the threat. A defendant
admitted to helping stab a man to death after his co-defendant threatened to kill him if
he didn’t participate, and was convicted of second degree murder and armed criminal
action. His defense of duress was not allowed for the murder charge, but resulted in re-
versal of the armed criminal action conviction [State v. Juarez (Mo. App. 2000)].
Aduress defense was not allowed a defendant who had imported cocaine into the
United States under threat, because he had opportunities to discard the packages or
to turn them in to customs officials [U.S. v. Arthurs (1st Cir. 1996)].

Defenses
■235
Generally, a defendant who voluntarily enters a situation where coercion is likely,
such as becoming a member of a criminal gang, loses the excuse of duress [Williams
v. State (Md. App. 1994)].
Duress has been rejected as a defense when wrongful acts are committed under
superior orders. The immediacy and great danger of genuine duress are not usually
present. The Nazi war crimes trials at Nuremburg and the Vietnam War trial of Lieu-
tenant William Calley demonstrated that obedience to orders that appear illegal to an
ordinary person violates the rules of war.
C.
NECESSITY
Duress is often confused with necessity, which is a different type of compulsion. The
defendant has not been forced by another person to commit a specific act, as in duress,
but under compelling circumstances has willingly committed an illegal act to prevent
even more serious consequences.
The historic case of Regina v. Dudley & Stephens (1884) denied the defense to two
lifeboat survivors who had killed and eaten their companion to keep from starving.
They claimed that their families needed them, whereas their victim had no family ob-
ligations. The prosecution asserted that one life was not more valuable than another.
The law and compassion were balanced by a death sentence that was commuted to
six months in prison by Queen Victoria.
The elements of a necessity defense are stated in U.S. v. Aguilar (9th Cir. 1989), in the
affirmation of a conviction for immigration law violations. The defendants had partici-
pated in a “sanctuary movement” to bring Central American refugees into the United
States without proper authorization. To claim that their actions were necessary, the de-
fendants needed to show (1) that they faced a choice of two evils and chose the lesser
one, (2) that they acted to prevent imminent harm, (3) that they reasonably anticipated
that their action would cause the harm to be avoided, and (4) that there were no legal al-
ternativestotheirconduct.Thedefendantshadnonecessitydefense,becausetheirclaim
failed to meet these criteria. As in Aguilar, defendants who had obstructed activities of
the Internal Revenue Service in protest against tax funds being used in the United States’
involvement in the civil war of El Salvador failed to show that they had prevented im-
mediate harm or that there was no legal alternative [U.S. v. Schoon (9th Cir. 1992)].
U.S. v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers Cooperative (2001) disallowed any medical neces-
sity exception for the Oakland cooperative to the 1970 Controlled Substances Act ban
on manufacture and distribution of marijuana. The ruling in Raich v. Ashcroft (9th Cir.
2003), however, granted an injunction in California against federal prosecution for
possession and use of marijuana that has not been sold or transported across state
lines and is used for medicinal purposes.
A snowmobiler claimed that operating the machine in a restricted national forest
wilderness area was necessary because of weather conditions that threatened his life.
He was allowed to raise the necessity defense, but because the weather conditions
arose before he rode into the forest, evidence did not support the defense, and he was
convicted [U.S. v. Unser (10th Cir. 1999)].
Anecessity defense is most likely to be successful under the following conditions:
(1) the offense has caused relatively little social harm, (2) scientific and corroborative
evidence supports the claim that there was no legal alternative to the illegal conduct,
and (3) the conduct was not in protest or aimed at undermining the law.2
Aprivilege related to necessity allows a narrow defense to the strict liability charge
of being a felon in possession of a firearm. Based on the decisions in U.S. v. Gant (5th
Cir. 1982) and U.S. v. Newcomb (6th Cir. 1993), the defense requires (1) that the defen-
dant reasonably believed he or she was under an imminent threat of death or serious
bodily injury, (2) the defendant was not recklessly or negligently in a situation in which
it was probable that he or she would be forced to possess a firearm, (3) the defendant
reasonably believed there was no reasonable, legal alternative to possessing a firearm

236
■
CHAPTER 7
to avoid the threatened harm, (4) it could be reasonably anticipated that possession of
the firearm would cause avoidance of the threatened harm, and (5) the defendant did
not possess the firearm for any longer than reasonably necessary.
Adefendant who was a felon was sitting in the living room when police began bat-
tering down the front door in a “no knock” search. The defendant responded by run-
ning into a bedroom to get a gun to defend himself and other occupants. The house had
been robbed one month previously. The court in State v. Coleman (Wis. 1996) ruled that
he was entitled to the privilege defense, reversed his conviction, and ordered a new trial.
A related “innocent possession” defense was allowed when a felon found a gun
near a school and was transporting it to an officer he knew when he was arrested. The
decision in U.S. v. Mason (D.C. Cir. 2000) sets criteria for the defense as follows:
1.
the firearm was attained innocently and held no illicit purpose, and
2.
possession of the firearm was transitory.
Innocent possession is excused as an affirmative effort to support law enforcement
policy.
D.
ENTRAPMENT
In consensual crimes such as drug trafficking, prostitution, and gambling where no
witness or complaining victim is likely, law enforcement officers or their paid in-
formants often feign involvement in a crime to catch the offender. Undercover officers
may let it be known that they want to buy cocaine or get in on the big stakes of a clan-
destine poker game to gain eyewitness knowledge of the crime. When these officers
go from simply providing the opportunity for a crime that would have occurred any-
way to enticing an innocent person into committing a crime he or she would never
have contemplated, that innocent person can claim the defense of entrapment.
Entrapment also may be a defense to some white-collar crimes, such as bribery,
or even street muggings where officers play the role of a vulnerable potential victim.
Entrapment never excuses violent crimes. Also, entrapment is not a defense if the one
enticing the defendant into the crime is a private citizen not working for the govern-
ment [U.S. v. Manzella (7th Cir. 1986)]. This defense is designed not only to protect in-
nocent defendants, but also to restrain overzealous law enforcement.
Jurisdictions vary in their consideration of entrapment. Most use a subjective test
that requires a showing of government inducement (more than simply presenting an
opportunity), then the defendant’s predisposition to commit the crime [State v. Houston
(W. Va. 1996)]. Some jurisdictions refuse to permit reputation or hearsay evidence to es-
tablish predisposition, relying instead on other circumstances. In State v. Goodroad (S.D.
1989) predisposition was shown by a “ready response” to an offer of marijuana for sale,
and an “obvious familiarity with dealing in marijuana.” An attorney arranged an inter-
national adoption, then demanded more money to keep the birth mother from kidnap-
ping the child. The adopting family was coached by FBI agents on how to gather
incriminating information against the attorney, which prompted his claim of entrap-
ment. Since there was no showing of inducement from the agents or lack of predisposi-
tion by the defendant, the defendant was not allowed a jury instruction on the
entrapment defense and was convicted of extortion [U.S. v. Nishnianidze (1st Cir. 2003)].
Adefendant had his conviction overturned in Jacobson v. U.S. (1992), however, be-
cause predisposition could not be shown. He had lawfully purchased a nudist mag-
azine, was subsequently bombarded for more than two years with mailings by postal
inspectors claiming to be organizations dedicated to sexual freedom, and finally pur-
chased a child pornography magazine. The Supreme Court asserted in the decision,
“When the government’s quest for convictions leads to the apprehension of an oth-
erwise law-abiding citizen who, if left to his own devices, likely would never run
afoul of the law, the courts should intervene.”3
Some jurisdictions follow Model Penal Code § 2.13 and use an objective test, al-
lowing the defense to locate intent in the government. In these courts, the emphasis

Defenses
■237
is on government misconduct, and the question to be answered is whether conduct
of the officers involved would have influenced a reasonable person not disposed to
crime to commit the offense. Where this test is used, the defendant’s own predisposi-
tion is irrelevant. A defendant who was only a conduit of cocaine from a police in-
formant to police officers was entrapped by improper police investigation standards,
so his conviction was reversed [Baca v. State (N.M. 1987)]. In U.S. v. Evans (7th Cir.
1991), however, repeated contact by an informant leading to the defendant’s purchase
of marijuana was not entrapment, because profit from the crime was the only in-
ducement, and not the “grave threats, fraud, or extraordinary promises” necessary
for entrapment.
Police involvement may be so extreme as to violate the defendant’s right to due
process, even though the defendant’s willingness to commit the crime bars the use of
an entrapment defense. The court in State v. Hohensee (Mo. App. 1982) declared that
government sponsorship of a burglary was not entrapment, but was so outrageous as
to bar conviction on due process grounds. The defendant had acted as a lookout while
police informants and officers carried out the burglary. Conviction on a conspiracy
charge, however, was affirmed.
The burden of proof in jurisdictions using the subjective test usually requires the
defendant to show government inducement. In some courts the defense has the bur-
den of persuasion by a preponderance of the evidence; and in others, the defense
merely has the burden of production of “some evidence” of inducement [U.S. v. Pratt
Text not available due to copyright restrictions

238
■
CHAPTER 7
(1st Cir. 1990)]. Then the burden shifts to the prosecution to establish predisposition
beyond a reasonable doubt. In objective test jurisdictions, however, the defendant
alone bears the burden of production and proof of impropriety of police conduct by
a preponderance of the evidence [Young v. State (Ark. 1992)].4
A few jurisdictions have combined the two tests for entrapment. First, the judge
decides the question of law concerning whether improper government conduct has oc-
curred. If so, charges are dismissed. If not, the question goes to the jury to decide
whether the defendant was predisposed to commit the crime [Cruz v. State (Fla. 1985)].
E.
INSANITY
1.
Introduction
Because the majority may believe the law reflects their own values, they might view
those who break laws as deviant or abnormal. Justice overlooks individual peculiar-
ities, however, and considers everyone sane unless shown to be otherwise under a
strict definition of the law. The criminal justice system has struggled to develop a def-
inition of insanity that will protect those defendants who truly are not responsible for
their unlawful actions and who, therefore, are not responsive to punishment.
There is a distinct difference between the legal term insanity and the medical term
mentally ill. Psychiatric experts may not testify in court as to whether the defendant is
“insane,” because that is a legal issue, but only as to the mental condition of the defen-
dant [Roundtree v. State (Miss. 1990)]. The fact that a defendant can benefit from psychi-
atric care does not automatically provide him or her with the legal defense of insanity.
Even though enormous attention has been focused on the insanity defense by both
legal scholars and the public, it is used in fewer than 1 percent of all criminal cases and
is successful in only 26 percent of the cases in which it is used.5 It can hardly be called
a “perfect defense,” because defendants found not guilty by reason of insanity are most
often committed to a maximum security psychiatric hospital, subject to the discretion
of a judge or jury or commitment hearings. That may not be as harsh as it appears, be-
cause the defendant is the one who has made the claim of insanity. Once hospitalized,
the burden is usually on the patient to show at periodic reviews the right to be released.
A competent defendant may refuse to raise the insanity defense even though ev-
idence may show that it is appropriate to do so. The court may decide voluntarily (sua
sponte) to instruct the jury on the insanity defense if evidence suggests it is appropri-
ate and when the defendant can make no clear choice about claiming the defense.
A verdict of guilty but mentally ill, allowed in some states, is a criminal convic-
tion “where a defendant’s mental illness does not deprive him of substantial capacity
sufficient to satisfy the insanity test but does warrant treatment in addition to incar-
ceration” [People v. Sorna (Mich. App. 1979)]. When mental illness is not conclusive
enough to affect conviction, it may be a mitigating factor in determining the grading
of the crime or in sentencing.
2.
Burden of Proof of Insanity
Because there is a presumption of sanity, the defense always bears the burden of pro-
duction of its contention of insanity. The level of that burden is usually to produce
enough evidence to raise reasonable doubt as to the defendant’s mental responsibility. A
few jurisdictions require only “some evidence” of insanity [State v. Evans (Conn. 1987)].
Once the burden of production is met, in about ten states the burden reverts to the
prosecution to prove sanity beyond a reasonable doubt. In most states, the burden
stays with the defense to persuade by a preponderance of the evidence. Federal law
(18 U.S.C.A. § 20) and some states require the defense to show clear and convincing
evidence of insanity, less than beyond a reasonable doubt but greater than a prepon-
derance of the evidence. If the defense does not meet its burden, the judge may with-
draw the insanity defense [Leach v. Kolb (7th Cir. 1990)].6

M’Naghten Test
The most enduring test of insanity came as a response to the British M’Naghten case
in 1843. M’Naghten, under a delusion that Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel was con-
spiring to kill him, shot and killed the prime minister’s secretary Edward Drum-
mond, believing him to be Peel. When M’Naghten was found not guilty by reason of
insanity, the House of Lords answered the public outcry and Queen Victoria’s request
for standards with the M’Naghten rule.
First, this rule requires the defendant claiming insanity to suffer a disease or de-
fect of the mind. That covers a broad range of psychoses and even retardation, but
does not include neuroses or psychopathic or sociopathic disorders.
Given the disease or defect of the mind, the M’Naghten rule then splits into two
prongs. One prong states that a person is insane when the mental defect is the cause
of that person’s not knowing that his or her conduct is wrong. The second prong
states that a person is insane when the mental defect is the cause of that person’s not
understanding the nature and consequences of his or her conduct.
Wrongfulness can be legal or moral. Adefendant may commit an act knowing that
it is unlawful but believing that it is morally right. A defendant who claimed that God
told him to stab his wife to sever their marriage bond did not believe that his action was
wrong. Such a psychotic delusion qualified him for an insanity defense, because moral
wrongfulness is determined by objective, “existing societal standards of morality rather
than a purely subjective personal standard of morality” [People v. Serravo (Colo. 1992)].
The decision in Pugh v. State (Okl. Cr. 1989) emphasizes the differences in and the
importance of the two prongs of the M’Naghten rule.
PUGH v. STATE
Court of Criminal Appeals of Oklahoma, 1989.
781 P.2d 843 Okl.Cr. 1989
[Citations omitted]
PARKS, PRESIDING JUDGE
Appellant, Roy Martin Pugh, was tried by jury and convicted
of First Degree Murder. . . . We reverse and remand for a
new trial.
. . . Briefly stated, the facts are as follows: Kimberly Ran-
some, a two-year old child, was beaten severely by seven-
teen (17) year old appellant, who was babysitting the child
while her mother was working. Upon returning home, Angela
Rucker, Kimberly’s mother, noticed bruises on Kimberly’s
face and realized that Kimberly was unconscious.She, along
with appellant, rushed the child to the hospital. Three days
later, Kimberly died as a result of her injuries.Appellant’s sole
defense was that of insanity.He presented expert and lay tes-
timony, which revealed his severely troubled past. Dr. Hamil-
ton, an expert in child psychiatry, testified that appellant had
quite possibly dissociated himself from his actions, thereby
not seeing his conduct as a product of his own thinking.
Appellant urges that the trial court committed reversible
error by refusing to instruct the jury as to the complete defi-
nition of insanity. At trial, defense counsel presented a re-
quested instruction which was identical to Oklahoma Uni-
form Jury Instruction—Criminal, Instruction Number 729:
A person is insane when that person is suffering from
such a disability of reason or disease of the mind that
he/she does not know that his/her acts or omissions are
wrong and is unable to distinguish right from wrong with
respect to his/her acts or omissions. A person is also in-
sane when that person is suffering from such a disability
of reason or disease of the mind that he/she does not un-
derstand the nature and consequences of his/her acts or
omissions. (Emphasis added)
Both parties agreed that an instruction on insanity was re-
quired under Broaddrick v. Oklahoma, 706 P.2d 534, 536
(Okla.Crim.App.1985); however, the prosecution argued
that the second sentence of the requested instruction was
redundant and confusing. The trial court agreed, and re-
fused to give the full and complete instruction to the jury. In-
stead, the trial court, omitting the second sentence,
instructed the jury only that appellant could be found insane

240

CHAPTER 7
if he was suffering from such a disability or disease of the
mind that he was unable to distinguish right from wrong.
Appellant claims that this omission was critical insofar as
it narrowed the definition of insanity. The State agrees that
the trial court could have properly given the instruction re-
quested by appellant, but urges that it was not necessary to
do so. . . .
Thus, the first issue before this Court is whether the sec-
ond prong of M’Naghten has been abandoned by this Court.
Concedely, it has long been held that M’Naghten is the only
test used to determine criminal responsibility in Oklahoma.
Furthermore, in Jones, 648 P.2d at 1254, this Court specif-
ically held a defendant was legally insane if “during the com-
mission of the crime he was suffering from a mental disease
or defect rendering him unable to differentiate between right
and wrong, or unable to understand the nature and conse-
quences of his acts.” This language followed explicitly the
rule set forth in M’Naghten’s Case, 8 Eng.Rep. 718 (1843),
and clearly shows that both prongs of the M’Naghten test
are applied in Oklahoma.Therefore, after full consideration,
we continue to adhere to both prongs of the M’Naghten test.
Having determined that both prongs are applicable, it is
clear that the trial court erred by refusing to give the com-
plete instruction requested by appellant. Our next determi-
nation is whether the trial court’s error necessitates
reversal. We hold that it does.
At trial, the prosecutor argued that the second sentence of
Instruction Number 729 was redundant and confusing. He
claimed that the language referring to the “nature and conse-
quences” of a defendant’s actions merely explained in more
detail the meaning of “right from wrong” as used in the pre-
ceding sentence. Although this Court has never had the op-
portunity to consider this question, several other courts have
confronted the issue. In Price v. Commonwealth, 228 Va. 452,
323 S.E.2d 106, 110 (1984), the Supreme Court of Virginia
held that the two parts of M’Naghten are disjunctive and sep-
arate ways of determining that a defendant is legally insane:
The first portion of M’Naghten relates to an accused who
is psychotic to an extreme degree. It assumes an accused
who, because of mental disease, did not know the nature
and quality of his act; he simply did not know what he was
doing.For example, in crushing the skull of a human being
with an iron bar, he believed that he was smashing a glass
jar. The latter portion of M’Naghten relates to an accused
who knew the nature and quality of his act. He knew what
he was doing; he knew that he was crushing the skull of a
human being with an iron bar. However, because of men-
tal disease, he did not know know that what he was doing
was wrong.He believed, for example, that he was carrying
out a command from God. 2. C. Torcia, Wharton’s Crimi-
nal Law § 100, at 9 (14th ed. 1979) (footnotes omitted).
As explained by the Iowa Supreme Court in State v.
Thomas, 219 N.W.2d 3, 6 (Iowa 1974), a defendant is enti-
tled to an acquittal “if he knew what he was doing [but] he did
not know it was wrong, or vice versa.”Thus, these two prongs
of M’Naghten essentially set forth two separate and distinct
ways that a defendant may be determined legally insane.
By refusing appellant’s requested instruction, the trial
court eliminated from the jury’s consideration one distinct and
separate avenue under which appellant could have been de-
termined to be legally insane. . . . Although the State asserts
such error is harmless, we believe appellant was deprived of
a fair and impartial trial because the jury was not given com-
plete instructions in conformance with the M’Naghten rule.
For the reasons discussed above, this cause is RE-
VERSED and REMANDED for a NEW TRIAL.

Irresistible Impulse
Critics of the M’Naghten rule said provision should be made for those who know what
they are doing and that it is wrong, but simply cannot control their conduct. Where
this volitional test is added to the cognitive test of M’Naghten, if an unlawful act is
committed under an irresistible impulse but not necessarily an utter lack of control,
the insanity defense is still valid. Only Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, and Virginia
have adopted this insanity standard.
5.
Durham or “Product” Test
Another criticism of M’Naghten is that it does not conform to the modern practice of
psychiatry. In New Hampshire, then later in Durham v. U.S. (D.C. Cir. 1954), it was de-
cided that “an accused is not criminally responsible if his unlawful act was the prod-
uct of mental disease or mental defect.” This much broader test considers all aspects
of the mental process and brings the insanity defense closer to a medical viewpoint.
When the goal of determining criminal liability rather than diagnosing mental illness
was reestablished, this test was abandoned.

■241
INSANITY
The defendant claims that he was insane at the time of the events alleged in the in-
dictment. If you conclude that the government has proved beyond a reasonable doubt
that the defendant committed the crime as charged, you must then consider whether
the defendant should be found “not guilty only by reason of insanity.”
The defendant was insane as the law defines that term only if, as a result of a se-
vere mental disease or defect, the defendant was unable to appreciate the nature and
quality or the wrongfulness of his acts. Mental disease or defect does not otherwise
constitute a defense.
On the issue of insanity, it is the defendant who must prove his insanity by clear
and convincing evidence. You should render a verdict of “not guilty only by reason of
insanity” if you are persuaded by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant
was insane when the crime was committed.
Remember, then, that there are three possible verdicts in this case: guilty, not
guilty, and not guilty only by reason of insanity.

Substantial Capacity—The A.L.I. Rule
Reacting to critics of M’Naghten who protested that there is no clear line between san-
ity and insanity, the American Law Institute (A.L.I.) set a broader standard in the
Model Penal Code that was reinforced in U.S. v. Freeman (2d Cir. 1966). It affords the
insanity defense when the defendant “lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate
the criminality [wrongfulness] of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the re-
quirements of law” [Model Penal Code § 4.01(1)]. This test allows a less than absolute
lack of capacity to determine wrongfulness. The word “appreciate” indicates a
deeper awareness of the value of an act. The A.L.I or Freeman rule is more inclusive
than M’Naghten, but not so broad as Durham. It appeared to be a good compromise
and was adopted by all federal appeals courts and more than half the states by 1980.
The trial of John Hinckley for the attempted assassination of President Reagan
brought the substantial capacity test before the public in 1982. Besides the more re-
laxed definition of insanity, the prosecution had the burden of proof to show the de-
fendant not insane beyond a reasonable doubt. The resulting verdict of not guilty by
reason of insanity brought public concern and a rethinking of the insanity defense.
7.
Current Status
In response to Hinckley, the Insanity Defense Reform Act of 1984, 18 U.S.C.A. § 17,
was passed by Congress. It shifted the burden of proof to the defense by clear and
convincing evidence and reverted to the M’Naghten-like requirement to “appreciate
the nature and quality or the wrongfulness of his acts.” Now about half the states use
the M’Naghten test, with a few adding irresistible impulse. About half the states use
the substantial capacity test. Idaho, Montana, New Hampshire, and Utah dropped
the insanity defense altogether to rely on a disproof of mens rea.7 Nevada’s 1995
statute abolishing the insanity defense was overturned by Finger v. State (Nev. 2001)
as a violation of due process; the M’Naghten test is now used.

nal Code standard in Exhibits 7–2 and 7–3.

8.
Automatism
When somnambulism, epilepsy, or other disorders cause momentary loss of control
during which an unlawful act is committed, it is difficult to ascribe responsibility to
that person. At one time these cases were handled the same as insanity cases, but
now automatism is likely to be treated as a separate affirmative defense without the
commitment proceedings that accompany a successful insanity defense. An au-
tomatism defense may be a red flag, however, signaling the need for civil commit-
ment proceedings.
In the trial of a woman charged with murdering her husband, the prosecution
contended that she killed him because he was leaving her for another woman. Evi-
dence showed that the defendant had been physically abused by her husband. She
suffered from mental illness for twenty years, and was subject to narcolepsy, a rare
sleeping disorder. The jury rejected the verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, and
acquitted her of murder on the basis of automatism caused by the disorder.8
9.
Insanity and Mens Rea
Besides allowing insanity as an affirmative defense where the elements of the crime
are admitted, most jurisdictions also accept evidence of insanity to show the defen-
dant lacked the mens rea required for the crime. If the necessary intent is not pres-
ent, of course, there is no crime, and the defense is complete. This defense is
particularly effective against first degree murder charges, where evidence of insan-

ity might not meet the standards for an affirmative defense but shows an inability to
premeditate.
Some courts reject the use of insanity claims to refute elements of mens rea and
require adherence to complete insanity standards for all insanity defenses. This ap-
proach is based on the belief that the insane can form the intent to commit a crime; the
question is whether the defendant is a responsible moral agent. According to some,
“One is a moral agent only if one is a rational agent.”9
10.
Competency to Stand Trial
A defendant deemed sane at the time of trial may have been insane at the time of the
offense and, therefore, be allowed the insanity defense. If the defendant is insane at
the time of the trial but was sane at the time of the offense, however, there is no in-
sanity defense. Regardless of capability at the time of the offense, due process requires
the defendant to be competent to stand trial.
Competence is determined by whether the defendant has “sufficient present abil-
ity to consult with his lawyer and whether he has a rational as well as factual under-
standing of the proceedings against him” [Dusky v. U.S. (1960)]. People v. Medina (Cal.
1990) allows the burden of proof of incompetency to be placed on the defendant. Most
courts require the defendant to raise a bona fide doubt as to competence, then place
the burden of proof on the state. If the defendant is found incompetent, necessity for
institutionalization is then decided at a civil commitment hearing required in Jackson
v. Indiana (1972). To be committed, the defendant must be found to be a danger to self
or others unless he or she agrees to a voluntary commitment.
A judgment on competency has nothing to do with the merits of the charges—it
is not a defense—nor is it a permanent barrier to trial. If and when the defendant re-
gains competency, he or she is subject to trial. Many cases involving insane defen-
dants are resolved by incompetency commitments, however, without necessity of
trial. Except for the more serious offenses, charges are often dropped when the de-
fendant is released from hospitalization, though commitment can be indefinite with
periodic review if the defendant is dangerous [U.S. v. Sahhar (9th Cir. 1990)].
In Riggins v. Nevada (1992) the Supreme Court ruled that it was reversible error to
administer antipsychotic drugs during trial to a murder defendant who claimed in-
sanity. Without findings that there were no less intrusive alternatives, and that the
medication was appropriate and essential for safety, the murder defendant had a
right to demonstrate his true mental state.
The U.S. Supreme Court further refined the criteria for administering anti-
psychotic drugs to defendants to render them competent to stand trial in Sell v. U.S.
(2003). To permit forced medication, the court must conclude that:
1.
Important governmental interests are at stake.
2.
Administering drugs must significantly further those governmental
interests, be substantially likely to render the defendant competent to
stand trial, and not have interfering side effects.
3.
Such medication is necessary, and less intrusive means are unlikely to
achieve the same result.
4.
Administration of the drugs is medically appropriate.
The Court added that compliance with all criteria may be rare, but is required.
In cases involving transfer of juveniles to adult court, competency to stand trial in-
volves concerns about immaturity of thought processes, perspective, and identity; dis-
ability in reading, organizing thoughts, and controlling emotions; and the effects of past
trauma, which can prevent an adolescent from participating in his or her own defense.10
Proceedings to assess whether an individual is a sexually violent predator in-
volve civil commitment, not criminal punishment, so there is no right to competency
at trial [In re Detention of Cubbage (Iowa 2003)].

11.
Handling Cases Involving Mental Health Issues
Procedures in federal cases involving mental disease or defect are set out in 18
U.S.C.A. §§ 4241 to 4247.
Special considerations are necessary when dealing with mental health issues.11 A
defense of insanity or diminished capacity must be built carefully and extend to every
aspect of the case.
First, learn the indications of mental illness. Your client’s rudeness may be a clue
to a mental disorder. Behavior in the law office may have no relationship to behav-
ior at the time of the alleged crime. Check your client’s family history and contacts
in the community for signs of a developing mental illness, understanding that the
stigma of mental illness or abuse is often hidden by normalizing labels such as
“street smart” or masked by alcohol or drug abuse. Have diagnostic testing done by
appropriate experts.
Second, evidence of your client’s mental impairment needs to be “front-loaded”
into the earliest stages of the case. An insanity defense is ineffective if it looks like a
desperate, last-ditch effort. A consistent approach must carry the defense through
early motions and funding requests for expert assistance, voir dire, dealing with prior
convictions, statements to the jury, and in sentencing considerations. Use a combina-
tion of expert witnesses to inform the jury about your client’s condition and lay wit-
nesses to the client’s life story to make the condition understandable and believable.
Third, treat your client with dignity and do what you can to reduce the stress of
proceedings. Seeing that the client takes required medications, conferring frequently
to explain proceedings, and providing a quiet place for breaks may help prevent out-
bursts that would convince the jury your client is dangerous rather than elicit com-
passion toward one suffering from an illness.
V.
MISSING ELEMENTS
A.
INTRODUCTION
The defenses considered so far are raised by the defense when all the elements of the
crime are present and attributable to the defendant. Another tactic of the defense is to
deny that a crime was committed by the defendant, to claim that one of the essential
elements is missing. The prosecution bears the entire burden of proving each of the
elements, so this approach is not an affirmative defense, but rather an opportunity for
the defense to show that an element is lacking. If a reasonable doubt about one of the
elements of the crime can be raised by the defense, the verdict must be not guilty. In
some jurisdictions, however, certain of these defenses, such as alibi and diminished
capacity, are affirmative defenses and are often categorized as excuses. Always check
to see how the defense you are working with is handled in your jurisdiction.
B.
ACTUS REUS AS A MISSING ELEMENT
The most obvious defense, and the most definite, is to show that the alleged crime did
not occur. The body cannot be found or the gems are discovered under a pillow. The
DUI defendant may not have been driving the car. The burglary defendant may have
walked through an open door into a public space.
Another means of casting doubt on the actus reus element is to give evidence of
an alibi. If the defendant was in Chicago speaking to a roomful of stamp collectors
while the burglary was taking place in Hoboken, it is reasonably doubtful that the de-
fendant is the burglar. Of course, if most alibis were so definite, their respective cases
would not be likely to go to court.
In some states alibi is treated as an affirmative defense. The majority of jurisdic-
tions, however, treat it as a missing element, relieving the defense of any burden of

Defenses
■245
proof. Not giving a jury instruction on alibi when it is requested and reasonably sup-
ported by the evidence, however, may allow the jury to assume that the defense
should have proved the alibi. Such a refusal was reversible error in State v. Rodriguez
(Ariz. 1998). In the federal system, the defendant gives notice of an alibi defense; the
prosecution responds with a statement of the time, date, and place of the alleged of-
fense; and both parties furnish information about witnesses (Fed. R. Crim. P. 12.1). Be-
cause a murder defendant had not complied with the Rule 12.1 requirement to file a
notice of alibi and disclose alibi witnesses, the court excluded those witnesses from
testifying. His conviction was affirmed in State v. Looper (Tenn. Crim. App. 2003). See
Chapter 12 for procedural requirements and check your state’s rules.
C.
MENS REA AS A MISSING ELEMENT
1.
Introduction
Though diminished capacity, age, intoxication, and mistake are often seen as defenses
under the heading of “excuses,” they actually serve to refute the element of intent.
There is a difference between intending to commit an unlawful act but not having the
capacity to be responsible for that intention, as in the insanity defense, and the lack of
mens rea. Here the argument is that the defendant did not have the capacity to form
the intent necessary to the crime, or committed the offense by mistake. Without the
requisite mens rea, there is no crime. Instead of excuse, there is innocence.
2.
Diminished Capacity
“Evidence that the defendant suffered from a mental disease or defect is admissible
whenever it is relevant to prove that the defendant did or did not have a state of mind
which is an element of the offense” [Model Penal Code § 4.02(1)]. In courts that use
this rule, evidence of diminished capacity may be used to establish innocence. Lack-
ing mens rea does not mean that the defendant is insane, so institutionalization is not
a routine consequence of this defense.
Some states reject the claim of diminished capacity, because it does not provide
clear standards such as those in the M’Naghten rule. Others restrict it to negating spe-
cific intent only, but not general intent, usually in regard to reductions of first degree
murder charges to second degree or, in some jurisdictions, to manslaughter if the
mental condition was the cause of heat of passion. Because bank robbery is not a spe-
cific intent crime, the defense of diminished capacity was not allowed in U.S. v.

CHAPTER 7
Gonyea (6th Cir. 1998). Diminished capacity can give rise to verdicts of guilty but men-
tally ill and be a mitigating circumstance preventing death penalties in otherwise cap-
ital crimes.
The federal Insanity Defense Reform Act, 18 U.S.C.A. § 17, bars diminished ca-
pacity as an excuse, but demonstration of a mental defect can be used to negate mens
rea. In contracting for the killing of his wife, a defendant did a significant amount of
purposeful planning, contrary to his claim of diminished capacity. The court in U.S.
v. Pohlot (3rd Cir. 1987) considered evidence of intent to be sufficient and affirmed his
conviction.
3.
Age
Common law held that those under the age of seven had no mental capacity to com-
mit crimes, and that their mental capacity increased until age fourteen, when re-
sponsibility was assumed. Now each state has a juvenile court system that effectively
eliminates the defense of age by trying juvenile defendants without juries as delin-
quents rather than as criminals. In most states these courts have exclusive jurisdic-
tion up to a certain age. At the upper age range, often sixteen to eighteen years, the
juvenile court can transfer or certify cases to adult criminal courts if the crime is se-
rious and the juvenile is mature. Reaction to recent, widely publicized, violent
crimes by younger children has led to a lowering of the age for trial as an adult in
some jurisdictions.
In re Gault (1967) enumerated juveniles’ due process rights of proper notice, as-
sistance of counsel, and privilege against self-incrimination. The disposition of youth-
ful offenders in the federal system is covered in 18 U.S.C.A. §§ 5001 to 5042.
4.
Intoxication
States vary in their standards of acceptance of intoxication as a defense. Most regard
voluntary intoxication only as a factor in establishing mens rea, allowing it to negate
specific intent but not general intent, so it is never a perfect defense. Battery on a law
enforcement officer is not a specific intent crime, so voluntary intoxication was no de-
fense in Frey v. State (Fla. 1998). Likewise, voluntary intoxication was not a defense to
felony murder in State v. Campos (N.M. 1996). It should have been allowed in a trial
for depraved mind murder, however, because the defendant’s mental state is an es-
sential element of the crime [State v. Brown (N.M. 1996)].
Some states, however, do not allow this defense even for specific intent. The
Supreme Court upheld Montana’s statute denying voluntary intoxication as a factor
in mens rea in Montana v. Egelhoff (1996). Evidence of the defendant’s intoxication was
admitted to show that he did not have the coordination necessary to carry out the
killings, but the jury was instructed that the evidence could not be considered in de-
ciding intent. Generally, voluntariness in consuming the intoxicant is deemed equal
to voluntariness in committing the crime.
Involuntary intoxication may negate mens rea, but also can be used as an excuse
for criminal behavior, similar to the insanity defense but without its consequences.
This defense is rare, because it requires that the defendant did not know that he or she
was taking drugs or that the defendant took drugs under extreme duress. Involuntary
intoxication also may result from an unexpected physiological reaction to medica-
tions, moderate amounts of alcohol, or exposure to other chemicals (pathological in-
toxication). Once the involuntariness is established, the severity of the intoxication
and its effect on the defendant’s action are subject to the same standards as apply to
insanity: determination of right and wrong, irresistible impulse, substantial capacity,
and so forth. A defendant’s use of anabolic steroids and claim of resulting intoxica-
tion was not sufficient to preclude specific intent for murder when other evidence
showed the defendant was not acting in a wild rage and that he knew what he was

ANALYSIS PROBLEM
7–3.
Intoxication is a factor in many crimes—the Bureau of Justice Statistics
reports that in 1996, 36 percent of convicted offenders committed their
crimes under the influence of alcohol. How do you think this connection af-
fects the nonacceptance of voluntary intoxication as a perfect defense? Why
do you think this is or is not fair?
doing [State v. Knowles (La. App. 1992)]. Intoxication resulting from addiction is not
involuntary [State v. Mash (N.C. 1988)].
The defendant in State v. Lohmeier (Wis. 1996) was allowed an affirmative defense
codified in Wisconsin’s homicide by intoxicated use of a vehicle statute. The statute
allows acquittal if the defense shows by a preponderance of the evidence that, even if
the defendant had not been intoxicated and was exercising due caution, conditions
were such that the victims would have died anyway.
5.
Mistake of Fact
A golfer anxious to get back to the office after an unexcused absence for a quick nine-
hole round grabs one of two identical maroon golf club bags from the rack outside the
pro shop. Another golfer later takes the remaining bag, but notices that the clubs are
not his expensive, custom-made ones. Later he asks that the first golfer be charged
with larceny. Is the first golfer guilty?
A mistake of fact, such as taking the wrong golf bag, that negates mens rea can
eliminate criminal liability for the defendant. The mistake must be honest and rea-
sonable, although an unreasonable mistake, such as taking a green bag when yours is
maroon, may also negate specific but not general intent. Mistake of fact is a mixed de-
fense, usually used as a counterargument to mens rea elements, but also codified as
an affirmative defense in some states.
Mistake is not a defense in strict liability cases when the age of a minor is in ques-
tion [State v. Oar (Id. 1996)]. When a mistake of fact causes an element of a strict lia-
bility crime to be missing, however, the mistake can be a defense. The crime of
concealing the alien status of another person, a strict liability crime, was not complete
when a defendant made false citizenship documents and sold them to undercover of-
ficers, because the officers were not aliens. The case was remanded for resentencing
on the lesser included crime of attempt [People v. Rizo (Cal. App. 1999)].
A defendant claimed that the hat he took from a store had been on the floor with-
out a price tag and was dirty. The store security officer testified that the defendant
took the hat from a rack. Even though the trial judge apparently found the defen-
dant’s claim incredible, the court should have given the jury instruction on the hon-
est belief defense and let them decide the credibility of the testimony, according to the
appellate decision [Binnie v. State (Md. 1991)].
6.
Mistake of Law
It is much more difficult to use as a defense a mistake regarding the law. The old say-
ing, “ignorance of the law is no excuse,” is fairly true [U.S. v. Robinson (1st Cir. 1998)].
Difficulty in distinguishing between mistakes of fact and mistakes of law complicates
matters. The case of West v. State (Neb. 1930) provides a good illustration of the dif-
ference. The defendant took a car, believing the owner had given it to her before he
died, when in fact it belonged to the executor of the estate. The mistake could have
been one of fact, that the defendant thought the owner had said he was giving her the

car when he had actually said something else. Or the mistake could have been one of
law, that the owner said the car would be hers, but did not write that provision into
his will. Thus, her mistake of law was in misunderstanding the legal effect of his state-
ment to her. The court reflected that, either way, the mistake negated the defendant’s
intent to steal the car, so her conviction was reversed. Generally, mistake of law is a
defense only when it negates specific intent.
The mistake of law defense is “extremely limited and the mistake must be objec-
tively reasonable” [U.S. v. Moore (7th Cir. 1980)]. Defendants charged with tax fraud
were not allowed jury instructions concerning a “good faith” defense as to their in-
terpretation of federal tax law [U.S. v. Regan (2d Cir. 1991)].
Although the unconstitutionality of a law may be used in a defense, belief at the
time of the offense that a statute is unconstitutional is not a valid defense for breaking
the law [State v. Thorstad (N.D. 1978)]. Even if an attorney mistakenly advises a client
that an act is not unlawful or that a law is unconstitutional before the offense is com-
mitted, that mistake cannot be used as a defense [State v. Brewer (Tenn. Cr. App. 1996)].
Allegedly mistaken advice on fishing laws given by a state trooper did not give rise to
a mistake of law defense to a strict liability offense, because the advice was not a formal
interpretation of law issued by a chief enforcement official or agency [Haggren v. State
(Alaska App. 1992)]. A defendant who believed that the law allowed possession of
child pornography because it was obtained as research on child abuse was not allowed
a mistake of law defense in People v. Fraser (N.Y. 2001). The defendant would have had
to show that an official statement of law authorized his conduct for the defense to apply.
Entrapment-by-estoppel is an affirmative defense used narrowly when a defen-
dant actually relies on a point of law misrepresented by a government official, and the
reliance is objectively reasonable based on the identity of the official, the point of law,
and the substance of the misrepresentation. A defendant convicted of being a felon in
possession of a firearm was not entitled to the defense, because the advice that his
right to possess a firearm resumed on his release from prison came from a state offi-
cer, whereas the crime in question is a federal crime [U.S. v. Funches (11th Cir. 1998)].
These decisions are based on the principle that the elements of crime are estab-
lished by the state, and that individuals may not alter those definitions, whether
through misunderstanding or ignorance, or by design. In U.S. v. Berrigan (4th Cir.
1969) for the mutilation of selective service records in the belief that the Vietnam War
was illegal, the court ruled, “No civilized nation can endure where a citizen can select
what law he would obey because of his moral or religious belief.” Do you see a simi-
larity to the rejection of the defense of necessity in civil disobedience cases?
D.
CONSENT
Consent of the victim is not a defense except for crimes that specifically include lack
of consent as an element, such as rape. In other words, an individual may not negate
the right of society to control violent behavior by consenting to being beaten. Thus, a
husband whose alcoholic wife consented to receive a beating from him as a punish-
ment for drinking did not have a valid defense against the charge of battery [State v.
Brown (N.J. 1976)]. Where society has approved certain types of violent behavior,
however, such as in football games, boxing matches, or beneficial treatment such as
surgery, the individual’s consent to participate removes criminal liability from the ac-

Defenses
■249
tor. Consent extends not only to conduct within the rules of a sport, but also to rea-
sonably foreseeable hazards of the game. Intentionally punching an opponent in the
nose was ruled not to be among the foreseeable hazards of a basketball game, how-
ever, so consent was not a defense in State v. Shelley (Wash. App. 1997).
When harm is slight, such as from a slap, or when the elements of the crime in-
clude “without consent,” such as kidnapping or rape, the victim’s consent does con-
stitute a defense by rendering the crime incomplete. One who gives consent must do
so voluntarily, be competent to do so, and not be subject to fraud or deceit. Amentally
retarded person does not necessarily lack competence to give consent. State v. Olivio
(N.J. 1991) ruled that consensual activity involving only mildly retarded persons
should not be criminalized. Forgiveness or consent after the crime is not a defense
[State v. Taylor (N.H. 1981)].
VI.
SYNDROMES
Conditions that impair defendants’ judgment and diminish their responsibility for
their actions, or help explain and excuse their actions, are generally not accepted as de-
fenses in themselves. Instead, various syndromes, disorders, and reactions are used to
support such traditional defenses as self-defense, diminished capacity, duress, and ne-
cessity. These conditions range from the now well-accepted battered person (spouse,
woman, wife, child) syndrome, posttraumatic stress disorder, and fetal alcohol syn-
drome,12 to less successful claims of junk food syndrome (sugar intoxication), gay
panic (reaction to a homosexual advance), and television intoxication (reaction to vio-
lent programs). Besides confusion in definitions and standards, medical and psychi-
atric information is not always uniform or well developed on syndromes that are only
recently recognized, much less on those that have been invented as last-ditch defenses.
Battered woman syndrome was allowed to show a woman’s vulnerability to fear
in her defense of duress to drug charges [U.S. v. Johnson (9th Cir. 1992)]. Battered child
syndrome was declared admissible to support a self-defense claim of a sixteen-year-
old who killed his mother with a bow and arrow [State v. Nemeth (Ohio 1998)]. Evi-
dence of posttraumatic stress disorder should have been allowed to support a
Vietnam War veteran’s self-defense claim by showing why he had failed to report the
shooting of two men [Shepard v. State (Alaska App. 1993)]. “Television intoxication”
could not be used, however, to bolster an insanity claim of an adolescent boy for the
first degree murder of an elderly woman [Zamora v. State (Fla. App. 1978)]. Neither
battered person syndrome nor cultural beliefs could be applied in the defense of a
Vietnamese native who shot her husband and stepdaughter [Nguyen v. State (Ga.
1999)]. The defendant claimed that divorce, which her husband sought, would make
her a pariah in her native culture, and that her stepdaughter had threatened and be-
littled her when she packed to leave. The court ruled that battered person syndrome
could include verbal and emotional abuse, but only if it is extreme enough to make
the defendant believe that an attack is imminent. The court also stated that strong cul-
tural beliefs can assist the jury in understanding a defendant’s action.
The battered person syndrome as a defense to the murder of the batterer com-
bines elements of self-defense, necessity, and insanity.13 The battering creates a men-
tal as well as physical subjugation of the person, isolating him or her from help.
Although the possibilities of escape, the motive of revenge, and gaps in time between
the battering and the retaliation cause concern, expert testimony on the syndrome has
been admitted in federal courts [U.S. v. Vega-Penarete (E.D.N.C. 1991)] and in most
states [Bechtel v. State (Okl. Cr. 1992)].
Care must be taken in the use of syndromes in defense. “A superficial knowledge
of stereotypes of battering and its effects will be hazardous to your client.”14 The Na-
tional Clearinghouse for the Defense of Battered Women, 125 S. Ninth Street, Suite
302, Philadelphia, PA19107, provides information and technical assistance to battered
women charged with crimes and their defense teams.

thing to eat and a little love

CONCLUSION
Criminal offenses are committed under a variety of circumstances. Some justify the
defendant’s action, such as self-defense or official duties; others excuse the offense as
the result of duress, necessity, entrapment, or insanity that influenced the act and re-
moved the responsibility of the actor.
In other cases the defense may argue that no crime was actually committed, at
least not by the defendant. Evidence may show that one of the elements of the crime
is missing. Actus reus may be challenged if the defendant has an alibi. The victim’s
consent may negate certain offenses. Conditions of intoxication, diminished capacity,
or mistake may eliminate the intent required for the defendant’s act to be criminal to
a certain degree. Adefendant may exhibit symptoms of a syndrome that could bolster
the defense.
The process of arrest and prosecution must be in accordance with the defendant’s
constitutional and statutory rights, such as statutes of limitations, due process, and
freedom from double jeopardy and self-incrimination. Because the strength of these
rights and rules that exist to protect each of us can be measured only in the context
of a criminal prosecution, it is vital that they are upheld on behalf of each defendant.
Care must be taken to determine the elements of each defense, subjective or ob-
jective tests, and the burden of proof required in your jurisdiction. You will gather ev-
idence to prove or disprove each of these defense elements just as you do for the
elements of the crimes themselves.

APPLICATION ASSIGNMENTS
1.
The Haden Hills homeowners in Case VI claim their attack on their
neighbors was the free expression of their religious convictions, which
condemn homosexuality. Would this defense be effective? Explain.
2.
A defendant convicted of conspiracy to obstruct the IRS claimed that
speech and writing urging others to file fraudulent tax documents was
protected by the First Amendment [U.S. v. Rowlee, 899 F.2d 1275 (2nd Cir.
1990)]. Is this an effective defense?
3.
A homeless man shelters himself in a packing crate under a bridge. One
night as he is resting in the crate, a man runs toward him screaming, “You
vermin should die!” The homeless man believes he sees a knife in the other
man’s hand. He could escape through the back side of the crate to the
other side of the bridge where passing motorists might help him, but
instead he stands and hits his attacker over the head with a metal rod and
kills him. The object in the man’s hand turns out to be a rolled up
newspaper. What self-defense issues are involved in this case? How would
you decide the case based on your state’s laws and judicial decisions?
What if a person were attacked in his or her car?
4.
Under what conditions does Tennessee v. Garner allow deadly force by police?
5.
A third party threatened to kill the defendant and the cashier of a store if
the defendant did not participate in the armed robbery of the store. Is the
defendant entitled to an affirmative defense instruction [People v. Houser,
712 N.E.2d 355 (Ill. App. 1999)]? If so, which defense?
6.
Should the defense of necessity be allowed in the following cases? Explain.
a.
A defendant charged with driving without a license testified that his
wife was in labor and he was driving her to the doctor’s office at the
doctor’s request. She could not drive herself. See Tarvestad v. State, 409
S.E.2d 513 (Ga. 1991).
b.
Defendants charged with kidnapping claimed a “choice of evils”
defense for removing the victim from involvement with a religious
sect for “deprogramming.” No evidence was offered to show
impending injury or that the defendants sought alternative remedies.
See People v. Brandyberry, 812 P.2d 674 (Colo. App. 1990).

254
■
CHAPTER 7
c.
A prisoner charged with unlawful possession of a weapon claimed he
had previously been cut and beaten, and had acquired the knife only
after receiving a threatening note. See People v. Ferree, 581 N.E.2d 699
(Ill. App. 1991).
d.
A woman charged with DUI had been threatened by her boyfriend, so
she left their apartment and drove under the influence of alcohol to get
away from him. See State v. Daoud, 679 A.2d 577 (N.H. 1996).
7.
A felon who had become a government informer in a murder-for-hire
indictment against an alleged drug conspirator had received numerous
death threats, for which he armed himself [U.S. v. Gomez, 81 F.3 846 (9th
Cir. 1996)]. Does he have a defense to the strict liability offense of being a
felon in possession of a firearm?
8.
An investigator contacted a former bootlegger and urged him to go into
illegal liquor production. When the bootlegger responded eagerly, the
investigator supplied equipment and an operator for a still, sold him sugar
at wholesale prices, and was his only customer for two and a half years.
Did the bootlegger have an entrapment defense? What other defense could
he claim [Greene v. U.S., 454 F.2d 783 (9th Cir. 1971)]?
9.
A defendant convicted of murder claimed that he acted during a
disassociative state connected to posttraumatic stress disorder. As a child,
he shot his abusive stepfather as he held a knife to the defendant’s
mother’s throat. Is the defendant entitled to jury instructions on the
defense of unconsciousness (automatism) [State v. Fields, 376 S.E.2d 740
(N.C. 1989)]?
10.
A mother planned her child’s death, obtained a rope, and strangled the
child. Evidence showed that the mother was in an unconscious state during
the act. She claimed that her Chinese cultural background was relevant to
her motives and the emotional crisis that generated the act. As a paralegal
on her defense team, research your state laws on the defenses of insanity,
automatism, and diminished capacity, and how cultural beliefs relate to
them, then write a short memo to your supervising attorney on your
findings and how they might be used in this client’s defense against murder
charges. See People v. Wu, 235 3d 614, 286 Cal.Rptr. 868 (Cal. App. 1991).
11.
A man who had been taking a controversial new drug to treat depression
forced his way into another man’s home and began beating that man with
a flashlight. The victim had been dating the defendant’s ex-wife, who was
present in the home. The defendant was charged with burglary. Would you
expect a defense of involuntary intoxication to be successful, based on this
information? Why or why not?
12.
a.
A man in possession of a divorce decree from his first marriage
remarries, then is charged with bigamy because a legal technicality has
made the divorce invalid. Does he have a mistake of law defense?
b.
A woman convicted of a felony was told by her attorney that it was
only a misdemeanor, which she believes. She is later charged with
possession of a firearm by a felon. Does she have a mistake of law
defense? See People v. Snyder, 186 Cal.Rptr. 485 (Cal. 1982).
13.
Why is self-defense an incomplete defense in most murder trials where a
battered woman is the defendant?
14.
As a paralegal for either the prosecution or the defense team, you will
need to consider defenses that might apply to your cases. What defenses
might be likely for the defendants from the cases in Chapter 1, and what
areas would you need to investigate to determine their applicability? Be
sure to review defenses for group and inchoate crimes.

I.
INTRODUCTION
Now that you have a working knowledge of substantive criminal law (the various
crimes, their respective elements, and possible defenses), you are ready to move to
procedural law and conduct the first set of tasks delegated to the paralegal in the pros-
ecutor’s office. This set of tasks is centered on the process of intake. Intake in the pros-
ecutor’s office is the receipt and initial evaluation of accusations to determine
whether charges are appropriate and whether formal documents should be drafted
and filed. Related tasks include interviewing complainants, assisting and counseling
victims of crime, and drafting the complaint, summons, and warrant for arrest. Intake
is important to the defense, as well, but because it often occurs after charging, it will
be covered later in the text.
II.
INTAKE PROCEDURE
A.
INTRODUCTION
Alleged criminal conduct comes to the attention of the prosecutor’s office in prima-
rily two ways: from the police or from citizens who come to or call the office. Most
charges stem from police reports of crimes. When the police observe criminal conduct
and make an arrest or investigate, they file reports with the prosecutor’s office de-
scribing the crime. All the information needed to file charges should be included in
that report. In jurisdictions where citizens can bring complaints directly to the prose-
cutor’s office, it is your task to interview the complainant, the person swearing out
the complaint, and to determine initially what, if any, charge could be brought against
the accused.

PREPARING FOR INTAKE
1.
Introduction
Properly conducted intake can avoid some significant problems. Among these are
court dockets excessively crowded with unwarranted or unprovable charges, citizens
needlessly arrested and seriously inconvenienced by charges that ultimately are not
sustainable, police upset because charges are not brought against defendants that
they believe are guilty of crime, and citizens angered because charges are not brought
against those who have hurt them. Some of these problems are inevitable, even in the
best managed prosecutors’ offices, but a properly prepared paralegal following in-
take guidelines can do much to minimize their occurrence.
Consider the consequences of improper charges in State v. Houck (Kan. 1986).
Early attention to the necessary elements of the offenses involved could have resulted
in different charges and, therefore, a different outcome of the case.

STATE v. HOUCK
Supreme Court of Kansas, 1986.
240 Kan. 130, 727 P.2d 460.
MILLER, Justice:
This is an appeal by Terrance Houck, following his convic-
tion by jury trial in Montgomery District Court, of two counts
of aggravated arson, K.S.A. 21-3718(1)(a), K.S.A. 21-3719;
two counts of conspiracy to commit aggravated arson,
K.S.A. 21-3302, -3718(1)(a) and -3719; one count of felony
murder, K.S.A. 21-3401; and one count of felony theft,
K.S.A. 21-3701(b). The controlling issue is whether the evi-

Intake and Drafting the Complaint
■261
dence was sufficient to establish the crime of aggravated ar-
son under K.S.A. 21-3718(1)(a) and -3719.
Briefly, these are the facts. Terrance Houck owned two
houses in Independence, Kansas, one located at 1328
West Chestnut, the other at 729 South 16th Street. On
June 25, 1980, the house on Chestnut was damaged by
fire. Albert Hughes was the tenant; he was inside the
house when the fire was discovered. The Marysville Mu-
tual Insurance Company had a policy of insurance cover-
ing the Chestnut Street property. Houck, as owner, was the
named insured. He collected $4,900 from Marysville Mu-
tual for his loss.
On January 29, 1981, fire destroyed the 16th Street
property. Carl Clay was in the house when it burned, and he
was killed. The house was uninsured, but the First National
Bank of Elk City held a mortgage on it.
Arson was not suspected. The fire chief concluded that
both fires were caused by careless smoking. Houck, mean-
while, was charged on August 28, 1980, and was convicted
on March 5, 1981, of aiding and abetting arson and theft by
deception. These charges arose out of yet a third fire. On
December 21, 1981, he was placed on parole, and on June
3, 1982, his parole officer granted Houck’s request and au-
thorized him to move to Arkansas. There he reported to an
Arkansas parole officer upon his arrival in that state, and he
remained under the supervision of that officer.
An arson investigation was initiated in April or May,
1983, when Independence authorities received anony-
mous letters from someone in Arkansas. Two statements
were taken from the defendant.The first, taken in Arkansas
on May 22, 1983, covered the Chestnut Street fire.The sec-
ond, taken in Independence on May 24, 1983, covered the
16th Street fire. In regard to the Chestnut Street fire, de-
fendant told police officers that he was buying several
houses from John Briggs, and the Chestnut Street house
was insured through John’s son, Robert Briggs, an insur-
ance agent. Robert Briggs called him several times and
finally defendant went in to see him. Robert Briggs sug-
gested that the Chestnut Street house was insured and a
fire at that address might get the defendant out of debt.
Houck said that he then talked with Michael Harris, and told
Harris that if the house would accidentally burn the burning
would be worth about $500. The house later burned and
Houck collected on the insurance policy. Robert Briggs held
out of the proceeds the money that Houck owed John
Briggs (about $4,780), and Houck received a check from
Robert Briggs for the balance, $120. In the May 22 state-
ment, Houck denied ever talking to Harris about setting fire
to the 16th Street house.
On the following day, May 23, Houck was returned to
Kansas and on May 24, he gave a statement concerning the
16th Street fire. He stated that Suretta Beach, Carl Clay’s
lady friend, came to him and asked him to burn the 16th
Street house so that Clay would die and she could collect on
an insurance policy which she held on Clay’s life. She in-
sisted the fire occur on January 29, 1981. She promised
Houck that she would pay him after she received the insur-
ance money. She also told him that the windows and rear
door were barred and that the fire should be started on the
front porch so that Clay could not escape. Houck talked to
Michael Harris and paid him $500 to set the fire and prom-
ised to pay him more when the job was finished. When Har-
ris said he had no way to carry gasoline, Houck told him that
there was a five-gallon gasoline can in the back of his truck.
On the morning of January 29, Houck went to a coffee shop
about 6:00 o’clock and then went down to 16th Street to get
Clay out of the house. When Houck arrived, the house was
already on fire. Houck went on to work. After the fire, Suretta
Beach stopped him on his way home and told him she would
pay him as soon as she got the insurance money. She never
paid him anything. Both of these statements were received
in evidence.
At trial, Suretta Beach was called as a witness for the
State. She testified that the windows and back door of the
16th Street house were sealed for weatherization. She de-
nied hiring anyone to burn the house, and testified that she
had no life insurance on Clay. She denied collecting any in-
surance money after he died. Michael Harris was killed in
1982, and John Briggs died in August 1983, before this trial,
and thus neither was available as a witness. Robert Briggs,
called as a witness for the State, testified as to the insurance
coverage, the proof of loss, and the disbursement of the pol-
icy proceeds. He was not asked if he suggested to Houck
that he burn the house.
Two other witnesses, Gary and Michael VanGilder, testi-
fied that Houck approached them about burning a house.
The witnesses, however, were unsure of the location of the
target properties.
The first issue is whether the evidence was sufficient to
sustain the convictions of aggravated arson, as charged in
the second amended information. Both charges allege the
damaging of a building in which another person has an in-
terest, without the consent of such other person. Count 2
charges defendant with the aggravated arson of the 16th
Street property “in which another person has an interest, to-
wit: The First National Bank of Elk City, Kansas, without the
consent of such other person . . . .”
Count No.5 charges defendant with the aggravated arson
of the Chestnut Street property “in which another person has
an interest, to-wit: Marysville Mutual, Marysville, Kansas,
and Albert Hughes without the consent of such other per-
sons. . . .” Arson is defined by K.S.A. 21-3718 as follows:
“21-3718. Arson. (1) Arson is knowingly, by means of fire
or explosive:
“(a) Damaging any building or property in which another
person has any interest without the consent of such other
person; or
“(b) Damaging any building or property with intent to in-
jure or defraud an insurer or lienholder.
“(2) Arson is a class C felony.” (Emphasis added.)

262
■
CHAPTER 8
Aggravated arson is defined by K.S.A. 21-3719 as follows:
“21-3719. Aggravated arson. Aggravated arson is arson,
as defined in section 21-3718, and committed upon a
building or property in which there is some human being.
“Aggravated arson is a class B felony.”
Houck argues that neither the bank nor the insurance
company had any interest in the property that burned. . . .
The information here charged that the First National
Bank had an interest in the 16th Street property. It held a
mortgage and was thus “interested” in the property as secu-
rity for its loan. The issue here is whether the mortgagee
held an interest in the building or property under the specific
language of K.S.A. 21-3718(1)(a). Reading the statute in its
entirety, we note that the following subsection (b) makes it an
offense to knowingly, by means of fire or explosive, damage
any building or property with intent to injure or defraud an in-
surer or lienholder.Obviously, the Bank was a lienholder and
the burning of the house with intent to defraud the mort-
gagee would constitute a violation of subsection (b). If, as
the State argues, subsection (a) prohibits destruction of
mortgaged property, we fail to see why the legislature would
make it a separate crime to destroy mortgaged property with
intent to defraud the mortgagee by enacting subsection (b).
...A mortgagee has a lien, not an ownership interest in the
land. Construing subsection (a) strictly, as we are required to
do in the case of criminal statutes, we hold that a mortgagee
does not have an interest in the property upon which it holds
a mortgage, within the meaning of K.S.A. 21-3718(1)(a).
Similarly, does the “interest” of the insurance carrier,
Marysville Mutual, constitute an “interest” in the Chestnut
Street property within the meaning of K.S.A. 21-3718(1)(a)?
Its “interest,” if any, is specifically protected by subsection
(b). Insurance is a matter of contract. The insurance carrier
has an interest in the contract and in the premiums. It has
no legal interest in the insured property. We hold that an in-
surer does not have an interest in the property it insures,
within the meaning of K.S.A. 21-3718(1)(a).
Appellant, despite the arguments of the State to the con-
trary, is not challenging the information; he is challenging the
sufficiency of the evidence to convict him of the specific
charges of aggravated arson made against him in the infor-
mation—knowingly, by means of fire or explosive, damaging
a building in which another person has an interest, without
the consent of such other person. For the reasons stated
above, we hold that neither the mortgagee nor the insurance
carrier had an interest under K.S.A. 21-3718(1)(a) in the
property destroyed. Whether the State’s evidence would or
would not be sufficient to prove a charge under K.S.A. 21-
3718(1)(b) is an academic question not properly before us.
The State has the responsibility to appropriately charge the
accused with the crime it believes the accused has commit-
ted. If the evidence introduced at trial does not support a
conviction of the offense charged, the accused cannot be
found guilty of some other offense which the State did not
see fit to charge. Here, the State did not prove the charges
it brought against Houck and, therefore, the convictions of
aggravated arson must be reversed.
The defendant next contends that the State’s failure to
charge him for almost three years after the crimes occurred
resulted in a delay which prejudiced him and denied him
due process under the United States Constitution. He first
argues that his absence from the state did not toll the run-
ning of the statute of limitations.The statute of limitations for
the charges at issue is two years. K.S.A. 21-3106(2). That
statute specifically provides, in subsection (3), that the pe-
riod within which a prosecution must be commenced shall
not include any period in which “[t]he accused is absent
from the state.” Thus, if the period during which Houck was
in Arkansas is excluded, this prosecution was timely.
Defendant argues that he was on parole and under the
joint supervision of Kansas and Arkansas parole officers
during all the time that he was in Arkansas. He contends
that he was in the “constructive custody” of the State of
Kansas and the State could have contacted him at any time
or could have returned him to Kansas if it wished. There is
no dispute, however, that Houck voluntarily sought leave to
move to Arkansas. He left the state of his own free will and
remained out of state as a personal choice during the period
in question. He was not ordered to leave the state; he was
granted permission upon his request. . . .
We hold that Houck was voluntarily absent from the state
and thus the two-year statute of limitations was tolled during
his absence. The prosecution was timely commenced.
Houck also argues that due process requires dismissal
because the preindictment delay caused substantial preju-
dice to his rights.We discussed a similar claim and the law ap-
plicable thereto in State v.McCorgary, 224 Kan.677, 681–84,
585 P.2d 1024 (1978).In that opinion we reviewed the leading
federal cases as well as our own on the point. In McCorgary,
there was an eleven-year lapse of time between the murder
and the commencement of the prosecution.Some of the prin-
ciples set forth therein are as follows: (1) To prosecute a de-
fendant following investigative delay does not deprive him of
due process even if his defense might have been somewhat
prejudiced by the lapse of time;(2) a due process inquiry must
consider the reasons for the delay as well as the prejudice of
the accused; and (3) prosecutorial delay solely to gain tacti-
cal advantage over the accused would violate due process.
In this case, as in McCorgary, there is not the slightest in-
dication that the delay by the State was for the purpose of
gaining tactical advantage.To the contrary, the State had no
suspicion of arson until it received anonymous letters some
sixty days or less prior to the time this prosecution was com-
menced. Once the State was alerted, its investigation moved
promptly and charges were filed on May 20, 1983.Defendant
contends that he was prejudiced because two witnesses,
John Briggs and Michael Harris, died before the case was
tried. Michael Harris, the alleged coconspirator, died of gun-
shot wounds approximately one year before the charges
were filed. John Briggs died shortly after the charges were
filed, but prior to trial. John Briggs, a former employer of the

ANALYSIS PROBLEM
8–1.
What should be done to prevent results such as those reached in the
Houck case? In the second paragraph of the Houck opinion, the court men-
tions that Albert Hughes was a tenant and in the house when it was burned.
Is this important to the charges? Why or why not? Why is the court not al-
lowed to convict on a charge not brought before it by the prosecutor?
defendant, was the former owner of one of the properties
and the defendant owed him money at the time the Chestnut
Street property was destroyed. Briggs received a substantial
portion of the insurance proceeds, as we have stated above.
That evidence came in through the testimony of his son,
Robert Briggs. Defendant does not allege that John Briggs
had any information as to the conversations between the de-
fendant and Robert Briggs, or that John Briggs could have
disputed any of the State’s evidence at trial. Michael Harris,
on the other hand, allegedly conspired with the defendant
and set fire to both properties at defendant’s request.He was
an important witness both for the State and for the defense,
depending on his testimony.There is no indication, however,
that the State was in any way responsible for his death or that
the State deliberately delayed prosecution until after his de-
mise. Upon the facts before us, we hold that defendant was
not denied due process by the preindictment delay. . . .
Five of the offenses charged were related to or arose out
of the alleged aggravated arson. All stand or fall upon the
sufficiency of the proof of the aggravated arson charges.
Count I charged conspiracy to commit aggravated arson,
which is defined in the information in pertinent part as
“knowingly by means of fire . . . damaging any building . . . in
which another person has an interest without consent of
such other person . . .” and describing the 16th Street resi-
dence. As we have already held, the evidence did not es-
tablish that another person had an interest in that property.
Count II charged aggravated arson of the 16th Street resi-
dence “in which another person has an interest, to-wit: The
First National Bank of Elk City . . . .” As discussed above, the
evidence was insufficient to establish that offense.
Count III charged first-degree felony murder, the killing of
Carl Clay “while perpetrating the felony crime of aggravated
arson . . . as stated in Count II of this Information which is
hereby incorporated into this Count by reference. . . .” The
felony upon which the charge was founded was not estab-
lished by the evidence.
We are not unmindful of our prior holding that one con-
victed of felony murder need not be charged with and con-
victed of the underlying felony. . . . In the case at hand,
however, there is no evidence that Houck committed, at-
tempted to commit, or conspired to commit the specific
felony upon which the State relied—the burning of a dwelling
house in which some other person had an interest. Absent
proof of this offense, the homicide conviction cannot stand.
Counts IV and V charged conspiracy to commit aggra-
vated arson and the aggravated arson of the Chestnut Street
residence in much the same manner as Counts I and II were
drafted. These counts were based upon the premise that
Marysville Mutual had an interest in the property, which the
evidence fails to establish. Defendant’s conviction of the of-
fenses charged in those counts must likewise be reversed.
Defendant was charged in Count VI and convicted of
theft by deception of the $4,900 he received from the insur-
ance company. We find no direct interrelation between that
conviction and the errors which pervade the others.The ev-
idence was sufficient to sustain this conviction.
For the reasons stated, the convictions of conspiracy to
commit aggravated arson (Counts I and IV), aggravated arson
(Counts II and V), and felony murder (Count III) are reversed.
The conviction of theft by deception (Count VI) is affirmed.

Items Needed for Intake
For intake you need a statute excerpt listing the specific crimes and penalties for your
jurisdiction. This excerpt allows you to pinpoint quickly the pertinent crime and as-
sess whether the complainant has described facts that support each element of that
crime. Most prosecution offices have these statutory excerpts. If the case is serious, it
is better to use an updated, fully annotated set of the criminal code. A review of the
annotations pertinent to each element of the crime being considered may prevent a
mischarging, such as occurred in Houck, or similar problems.
You also need a copy of a good standardized intake form. If your office does not
have one, create your own, similar to the one in Exhibit 8–1 at the end of the chapter.

264
■
CHAPTER 8
Obtain the other standardized forms that you need; these usually include criminal
complaints, summonses, and arrest warrants. Examples of these forms are presented
in Exhibits 8–2 through 8–6.
Have a medical release form ready for the victim to sign for confirmation and ev-
idence of any pertinent injuries. Release forms must comply with the Health Insur-
ance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). See the medical release form at the
end of Chapter 11. Consult Chapter 11, as well, for additional tips on preparing for
and conducting interviews and dealing with difficult people.
3.
Interview Setting
The surroundings for a complainant interview should be as comfortable as possible.
Ideally, you will have your own office where you can conduct the interview one-on-
one. Privacy helps convey a professionalism that instills confidence in the complainant
and reduces the anxiety and intimidation that many people feel in such circumstances.
Divert your phone calls to the receptionist, along with other interruptions, in order to
avoid delays and give the complainant the sense of importance that is needed.
If the complainant has a particularly sensitive crime to report, such as sexual as-
sault, child abuse, or marital rape, it may be best if the intake paralegal is of the same
sex as the victim. If possible, immediate referral to the special sexual assault response
team of the law enforcement agency may be the best procedure for all concerned. Po-
lice will then come back to swear out the complaint. Interviews with young children
require caution and great skill. Numerous child sexual assault cases have been over-
turned because of improper questioning. Interviews with young children should be
conducted by highly experienced individuals and should be videotaped. In most ju-
risdictions, matters concerning alleged criminal conduct by juveniles are referred to
the juvenile authorities.
C.
THE INTERVIEW
The following is an example of what might happen in an intake interview in Case II.
Secretary: Ms. Cordoba, our paralegal will see you now.
Ms. Cordoba: Thank you.
Paralegal: Please come in Ms. Cordoba and be seated. How can I help you?
Ms. Cordoba: I want to know if you can get my ring back for me.
Paralegal: What kind of ring?
Ms. Cordoba: A diamond ring, an old one.
Paralegal: What happened to your ring, Ms. Cordoba?
Ms. Cordoba: Well, it all started back about five years ago when . . .
Paralegal: Excuse me for interrupting, Ms. Cordoba, but what crime do you think is
involved here?
This abrupt interruption may lack tact, but it is practical and cuts to the chase.
Ms. Cordoba: Well, ah . . . stealing? He stole my diamond ring.
Paralegal: Where did this occur?
Ms. Cordoba: At my apartment.
Paralegal: Is that in Legalville?
Ms. Cordoba: Yes.
Paralegal: What is the value of the ring?
Ms. Cordoba: $10,000. We had it appraised about a year ago.
These questions confirm the court’s jurisdiction early in the interview. If the crime
occurred outside the jurisdiction, the person may need to be referred to the prosecu-
tor’s office in the proper jurisdiction. The questions also establish the value of the
item, which determines whether the theft is a felony.

Intake and Drafting the Complaint
■265
Paralegal: Who took your ring?
Ms. Cordoba: Well, my husband, I mean ex-husband . . . actually, we are not divorced
yet, and the way money is tight now I don’t expect that we will get
divorced for some time. We haven’t lived together for about four months.
Paralegal: How did you get the ring?
Ms. Cordoba: From my husband—he gave it to me on our first anniversary.
Paralegal: When was it taken?
Ms. Cordoba: About three weeks ago. He took it from my apartment when I was gone.
Paralegal: Have you tried to get your ring back?
Ms. Cordoba: Yes, I’ve tried everything.
Paralegal: The office’s supervising attorney has authorized me, in such circumstances,
to inform you that the only means by which this office can try to get your
ring back is to charge your husband with theft and bring him to court where
he might get some jail time, a fine, or possibly prison time. It could be quite
serious. Is that what you want to do?
Ms. Cordoba: I told him I was going to go to the police and he just laughed at me. He’s
left me with no choice.
Paralegal: What are the chances you two will get back together?
Ms. Cordoba: No chance. We’ve despised each other for three years. It’s over.
Note that the paralegal has asked enough preliminary questions to determine
whether this matter is appropriate for the criminal courts to pursue. It frequently falls
to a paralegal to suggest alternatives to a criminal action. Criminal charges should be
filed as a last resort and when it appears there is no reasonable alternative. For ex-
ample, is there a mediation service for such disputes? Is there a mutually respected
relative, clergy member, or other third party who could help resolve the conflict?
Might a small-claims court resolve the matter?
Recognizing that this is an unusual case, but also that Ms. Cordoba is not likely
to be able to seek immediate assistance through the civil courts, the paralegal decides
to go ahead. As in all cases, the ultimate decision on whether to file the charge will be
made by the prosecuting attorney.
Paralegal: Okay, Ms. Cordoba, I need to record some information.
At this point the paralegal works through the intake questionnaire, recording the
date of the interview and the complainant’s name, address, phone number, social se-
curity number, and date of birth. The paralegal obtains several addresses and phone
numbers for both the complainant and the defendant because people frequently
move.1 The paralegal records parents’ names, addresses, and phone numbers, an
emergency phone number, and employment phone number for both the com-
plainant and the accused, as well as the date and approximate time of the alleged
crime. Note: As a paralegal, you should develop the habit of referring to such inci-
dents as “alleged,” because doing so raises consciousness levels of the presumption
of innocence.
Next, the paralegal looks up the appropriate statute in the code book, taking special
note of each of the elements of the crime. The Columbia statute for theft is as follows.
COLUMBIA CRIMINAL CODE § 809.00
Any person who unlawfully takes the property of another with intent to deprive that
person of its possession is guilty of theft.
a) If the property is valued at $500 or more the crime is a class D felony punishable by
up to five years in prison and/or a $10,000 fine.
b) If the property is valued at less than $500 the crime is a class A misdemeanor
punishable by up to six months in jail and/or a $500 fine.
The paralegal should inquire further to ensure that there are sufficient facts to
support each element of the crime. A common method of covering the facts is to use

CHAPTER 8
the six Ws; Who? When? What? Why? Where? and How? These questions are gener-
ally incorporated into the intake questionnaire.
Paralegal: Ms. Cordoba, when did this happen?
Ms. Cordoba: Easter Sunday—April 7, _____ . I had gone to visit my parents. Miguel
came to my place and took some of his things—that was okay. But when I
returned, the ring was gone.
Paralegal: How do you know your husband took it?
Ms. Cordoba: I called him and he admitted it. When I told him to give it back he just
laughed and said no. He continued to refuse to give it up and, worse yet,
his bimbo is wearing it!
Ask questions to explore the possibility of other crimes, in this case, burglary.
Paralegal: Did he have your permission to enter your apartment?
Ms. Cordoba: Yes, I told him to get the rest of his tools and some odds and ends and the
rest of his clothes out of my place while I was gone. I’d been wanting him
to do that for some time.
Paralegal: Did he have permission to take the ring, or did you know he was going to
take it?
Ms. Cordoba: Of course not. It was mine.
Paralegal: Did this occur at the address you have given me?
Ms. Cordoba: Yes, it did.
Paralegal: Was your ring given to you as a gift by your husband?
Ms. Cordoba: Yes—it was his aunt’s, a family heirloom. Will that make a difference?
Paralegal: I’m not sure, Ms. Cordoba, and as a paralegal and not an attorney, ethical
constraints prevent me from giving you an opinion. This will be taken under
consideration by the prosecuting attorney and the court.
Anticipatingtheneedofareasonablyprecisedescriptionoftheringforbothasearch
warrant and the complaint, the paralegal will acquire such a description of the ring.
Ms. Cordoba: The ring is a wide gold band with a large diamond in a raised mounting
at the center. Two smaller rubies are on each side, with tiny diamonds and
rubies circling the larger stones. There are two small letters engraved on
the inside of the band, an “A” and an “R.”
Paralegal: How much did you say the ring was worth?
Ms. Cordoba: When I took it to the jeweler about a year ago to have the mountings
checked, she said it was probably worth at least $10,000.
Paralegal: Can we locate the ring at the address you gave me for your husband?
Ms. Cordoba: Yes, but on the right hand of his girlfriend. They’re living together.
Paralegal: And what is her name?
The paralegal should inquire about evidence of the crime. For example, the com-
plainant may have an emergency room treatment sheet to confirm alleged injuries, a
threatening note from the perpetrator, photographs of damage, or something similar.
This not only helps confirm the complainant’s accusations, but also may be helpful in
drafting the complaint.
After all the information has been gathered that is needed to pursue filing a
charge, the paralegal will explain to the complainant what will happen next and af-
firm, in light of that, whether he or she still wants to proceed.
Paralegal: Ms. Cordoba, I’ll draft a complaint. In a few minutes it will be typed and will
need your signature. Before I proceed, however, you should know what to
expect from here. The prosecuting attorney will determine for sure whether
the charge should go forward. If he rejects it, I will contact you in a day or so.
Otherwise, it will be filed. The ring will be found, if possible, and your
husband will be arrested or, at least, notified to appear in court. There will
normally be one or more court hearings at which you will need to state what

you have told me. If the case goes to trial and if your husband is convicted, he
will be sentenced. Subject to any appeal, the ring will be returned to you at
that time. This can take anywhere from three months to a year to resolve.
Considering that your husband could go to jail or prison, are you sure you
want to go ahead?
Ms. Cordoba: Yes . . . I love that ring. It represents to me everything that did work
about our marriage . . . everything that I put into the marriage. My
husband stole it. He must pay the consequences.
Paralegal: I understand. Once the charges are filed, it is not necessarily easy to drop the
charges. If you think there is any chance you will want to drop the charges
later, it would be better not to file them now.
Ms. Cordoba: I want to go ahead.
Paralegal: Let me prepare the complaint for you to read and sign.
Prosecution offices become quite hectic, especially on Mondays with new cases
arising from a weekend of alcohol abuse, partying, domestic problems, and a host of
other possibilities. Therefore, the intake interview must be adequate but brief with as
much compassion for the victim as time and reason allow. Many interviews, such as
the one just given as an example, last less than fifteen minutes. More complex or sen-
sitive cases may take an hour or more. Knowing how much time to take and what to
ask, and determining how serious and delicate a matter is, comes with experience and
preparation.

COUNSELING THE VICTIM
You will soon realize that there is more to your job than Joe Friday’s “just the facts,
ma’am, just the facts.” The people you will be dealing with have suffered varying de-
grees of injury, pain, emotional trauma, fear, and anger. Part of your job is to assess
quickly whether the person before you would benefit from community services. The
person may need a doctor, a social worker, a spouse abuse center, or other services.
Showing you care can help defuse anger and develop a bond to the office that can lead
to greater cooperation on the case in days to come. More importantly, caring and act-
ing on that caring will direct people to professionals who deal with such problems on
a regular basis and who may have the resources to help people put their lives back
together.
Exhibit 8–7 at the end of this chapter is an excerpt from a brochure on surviving
sexual assault.2 It is the kind of resource material that can help you help the victim of
a crime. For working with victims of intimate partner abuse, here are some points to
keep in mind.3
1.
Prepare the case so the prosecution can continue if the victim recants or
becomes uncooperative.
a.
Preserve “excited utterance” evidence. Police and other investigators
must be aware that statements made by the victim at the scene, as well
as photos of the scene, will be extremely important at trial if the victim
does not testify.
b.
Get recorded statements from both victim and defendant. A victim’s
statement can be used later to impeach a recanting victim or to
persuade the victim to testify truthfully. Some law enforcement and
prosecutor’s offices have crime victim witness coordinators meet with
the victim, take the statement, and help the victim make use of
community resources for counseling and safe housing.
2.
Build and maintain a positive relationship with the victim onward from
first contact, usually at the defendant’s initial appearance.
a.
“No contact” provisions of the defendant’s bond prohibiting contact
with the victim must be explained.
“The law is not a series of
calculating machines where
definitions and answers
come tumbling out when the
right levers are pushed.”

Democracy,” 32 Journal of

CHAPTER 8
ANALYSIS PROBLEM
8–2.
A citizen comes in and wishes to press charges against a neighbor for
threatening to kill her dog. Or a divorced woman wants to press kidnapping
charges against her ex-mother-in-law for keeping the woman’s son an extra
day of visitation. Or someone wants to prosecute a neighbor for public
drunkenness. How would you handle these situations once the prosecutor
said “no way”?
b.
Kindness, rather than threats, and repeated visits are necessary to keep
communication open. The victim needs to know that even if this case
does not end in conviction, law enforcement and the prosecution team
will be there to help in the future.
3.
Make legal decisions that are fair to the victim and the defendant.
a.
Evaluate appropriate options for sentencing.
b.
Decide whether it is better to dismiss a weak case than risk putting the
victim through a trial and emboldening the defendant toward future
violence if there is an acquittal.
c.
Consider harsh methods of dealing with uncooperating victims, such
as charging them with false reporting, only as a last resort to avoid re-
victimizing them by the criminal justice system.
As a paralegal, you should take the time to be informed about the variety of services
available in your community. Make a list of these services and a brief description of each.
Includethenamesofcontactpersons.Copythelistasaresourceforthepeopleyouserve.
Further inform the complainant of his or her rights under any victim compensa-
tion and rights program in your jurisdiction. Many states now compensate needy vic-
tims for physical or psychological injuries stemming from state or federal crimes.
Provide the proper filing forms with adequate instructions to the victim. Inform the
victim of the eligibility requirements and, possibly, some common reasons claims are
denied: too high an income, inadequate or inaccurate information, lack of notification
of change of address, failure to cooperate with police in prosecution, property loss
only, or compensation available through other sources, to name a few.4 If office re-
sources permit, provide assistance in completing and filing the form. Exhibit 8–8 is a
copy of a victim impact statement.5 This may be referred to during plea negotiations,
sentencing, and potential parole hearings. Exhibit 8–9 is a sample of a crime victim’s
claim form.6 It is representative of similar forms and defines who is eligible for com-
pensation and under what circumstances. Some states and the federal government
also provide victim and witness protection programs. Paralegals may be assigned to
gather the relevant information and process the necessary forms. A list of Web site re-
sources for assisting victims is included at the end of the chapter. Most state attorney
general offices have victim assistance divisions.
III.
DECISION TO CHARGE
A.
AUTHORITY, LIMITS, AND IMMUNITY FROM CIVIL SUIT
Prosecutors are members of the executive branch of government and derive their au-
thority from that branch’s duty to execute the law. In that capacity, the prosecutor de-
cides if charges should be brought and what those charges should be. Limits exist,
however, on that decision. The prosecutor has the ethical duty to seek justice, protect the
innocent, avoid charging for personal or political reasons, refrain from charging where
evidence is insufficient, forego seeking charges greater in number or degree than evi-
dence will support, and seek a fair penalty (ABA Standards for Criminal Justice and

Intake and Drafting the Complaint
■269
ABAModel Rules of Professional Conduct). When prosecutors neglect or refuse to bring
warranted charges, they may be forced to do so by court order (mandamus) or by the
order of the attorney general. Because prosecutorial discretion regarding charging is so
extensive, however, and because its exercise is based on assessment of the likelihood of
success, quality of evidence, and wise expenditure of tax dollars, such actions are rare.
Further limitations stem from constitutional concerns and center on discrimina-
tory and vindictive prosecution. In cases where the discrimination is based on race,
religion, ethnic origin, sex, age, and other traditional and obvious areas of discrimi-
nation, the courts find such prosecutions devoid of equal protection. Yick Wo v.
Hopkins (1886) struck down the prosecution of persons for having laundry businesses
in wooden as opposed to brick buildings, because only Chinese violators were pros-
ecuted. A defendant claiming violation of equal protection, however, must establish
actual and purposeful discrimination. In Oyler v. Boles (1962) the defendant failed to
prove purposeful discrimination in his being charged as an habitual offender when
five other defendants who could have been so charged were not.
More recently, five African Americans accused the government of selective prose-
cution by singling out the defendants, and African Americans in general, for crack co-
caine violations, which have considerably higher penalties than those for powder
cocaine. In finding for the government, an eight to one Supreme Court decision said
that considerable deference must be given by the courts to the functions of the execu-
tive branch of government and, therefore, defendants claiming selective prosecution
have a demanding burden of proof. The Court said the defendants must demonstrate
that the prosecutorial policy “had a discriminatory effect and was motivated by a dis-
criminatory purpose.” To establish a discriminatory effect, said the Court, “the claimant
must show that similarly situated individuals of a different race were not prosecuted.”
Despite evidence that nearly 95 percent of crack prosecutions were against African
American defendants, the court found that the defendants failed to meet the burden of
proof [U.S. v. Armstrong (1996)]. In U.S. v. Bass (2002), the Court rejected, as definitive
of the issue of selective prosecution, statistics that showed that blacks were charged
more than twice as often with death penalty offenses as whites. It reasoned that general
statistics were insufficient to show discriminatory charging in a particular case.
The burden becomes more difficult when the group in question is not one of those
traditionally discriminated against. The defendant in Wayte v. U.S. (1985) was
charged with failing to register for the draft. The defense claimed that of the many vi-
olators of the law, the only ones charged were those who had protested the draft reg-
istration law by reporting their own failure to comply. The decision rejecting that
claim cited the need for such “passive enforcement” to apply prosecutorial resources
where they would do the most good with the least amount of effort and expense. The
court found no evidence of a discriminatory purpose, and conceded that the prose-
cution’s “broad discretion” as to whom to prosecute rests largely on the recognition
that the decision to prosecute is particularly ill-suited to judicial review. This gives the
defense a heavy burden of proof in nontraditional equal protection claims.
Prosecutors are also prohibited by due process considerations from vindictively
increasing charges or otherwise penalizing defendants for exercising their constitu-
tional and procedural rights. A prosecutor’s attempt to raise a misdemeanor charge
to a felony because a defendant exercised the right to a trial de novo (new trial) was
held to be a violation of due process [Blackledge v. Perry (1974)]. When a court per-
ceives that the state raises its original charge but does so in the context of plea bar-
gaining, it generally will not find a vindictive motive. In Bordenkircher v. Hayes (1978),
the prosecutor offered a five-year sentence if the defendant would plead, but if not,
he would go to the grand jury for an indictment on an added habitual criminal charge.
When the defendant refused the plea bargain and the prosecutor successfully pushed
for a life sentence, the Court said this was not vindictive prosecution.
Problems akin to vindictive prosecution arise in the context of release-dismissal
agreements, in which the prosecutor agrees to dismiss charges in return for the defen-
dant’s agreement not to bring a civil suit against the government (usually against the

270
■
CHAPTER 8
police). Although such agreements have been upheld as within the scope of prosecu-
torial authority [Town of Newton v. Rumery (1987)], it has been held to be beyond pros-
ecutorial authority to try to protect police by adding extra charges after an accused
refused to sign a release-dismissal agreement [MacDonald v. Musick (9th Cir. 1970)].
A recent memorandum of the U.S. Attorney General (September 2003) aims to
take full advantage of prosecutorial discretion while avoiding actions for vindictive
prosecution. The memorandum requires federal prosecutors to pursue the most seri-
ous, provable criminal charges. The purpose of the policy is to secure the toughest
sentence and, possibly, to limit some judicial leniency in sentencing.7
A state statute that made it mandatory for a prosecutor to add an habitual crimi-
nal charge if a defendant had three or more felonies was held to be an unconstitu-
tional violation of prosecutorial (executive) discretion [State v. Pettit (Wash. 1980)].
In U.S. v. Goodwin (1982) a substitute prosecutor was allowed to raise a previously
filed misdemeanor to felony charges when the defendant requested a jury trial. A de-
fendant must show “actual retaliatory motive” when the raising of the charges is
equally as likely to be because of different views of different prosecutors, new evi-
dence, or other legitimate reasons.
Once a prosecutor makes a promise to a defendant, the courts may hold the prom-
ise a binding “pledge of public faith.” Thus, plea agreements are binding [Santabello
v. N.Y. (1971)], and a promise to dismiss a charge if the accused passed a lie detector
test was held binding in People v. Reagan (Mich. 1975). Any attempt by the prosecutor
to renege may result in a reversal of the subsequent conviction.
A delay between the alleged criminal act and the actual filing of the charges may be
an important factor. It can be a violation of due process if the defendant can show that
the state had adequate evidence to commence the prosecution and the delay prejudiced
the defendant’s case. Further, it must be shown that the reasons for delay are so unjus-
tified as to deviate from “fundamental conceptions of justice” [U.S. v. Lovasco (1977)].
Prosecutors could be excellent targets for lawsuits because of the tremendous dis-
cretion they exercise. They are immune, however, from civil suits for malicious pros-
ecution and for deprivation of civil rights as long as they act within the scope of their
office [Imbler v. Pachtman (1976)]. The elements that must be proven in malicious pros-
ecution cases are frequently defined by common law of the pertinent state. The fed-
eral circuit courts are divided on what elements must be proven [Castellano v. Fragozo
(5th Cir. 2003)]. Since Pachtman, a line of Supreme Court cases has focused on whether
the prosecutorial conduct in question is a function “intimately associated with the ju-
dicial phase of the criminal process” [Burns v. Reed (1991)]. If the function is not so as-
sociated, such as investigatory or administrative functions, then only qualified
immunity applies. Therefore, a prosecutor’s participation as a lawyer for the state in
a probable cause hearing for a search warrant was protected by absolute immunity,
but advising police at the preliminary investigatory stage was not [Burns]. A prose-
cutor’s investigation to determine if a footprint was that of the suspect and a false
statement at a public announcement of an indictment were protected only by quali-
fied immunity [Buckley v. Fitzsimmons (1993)]. So, too, qualified immunity applied to
the witness-like function of certifying the facts to support an arrest warrant, but ab-
solute immunity applied to the prosecutor’s conduct when preparing and filing the
charging document [Kalina v. Fletcher (1997)].
In 1997 the Hyde Amendment was passed allowing the U.S. District Courts to
award attorney fees and other litigation expenses for wrongful (vexatious, frivolous,
or in bad faith) prosecution [18 U.S.C.A. § 3006A(1997)].
B.
JOINDER OF OFFENSES AND DEFENDANTS
Your research and eventual experience may assist the prosecutor in deciding whether
to join offenses and defendants in the charging document. Most state rules and the fed-
eral rules permit more than one charge (or count) to be filed per defendant and more
than one defendant to be charged with an offense [Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(a) and (b)]. In such

Intake and Drafting the Complaint
■271
cases the offenses and the defendants may be joined for trial. Offenses may be joined
if they are (1) the same or similar or (2) based on two or more connected acts or con-
stituting parts of a common scheme or plan [Rule 8(a)]. Defendants may be joined “if
. . . alleged to have participated in the same act or transaction or in the same series of
acts or transactions constituting an offense or offenses” [Rule 8(b)]. Ordinarily this
pleases both taxpayers and judges, because all the outstanding matters can be resolved
before one jury and at one time, which is more efficient than holding separate trials.
The decision to join charges or defendants requires caution, however, because of
possible constitutional concerns. Charges may not be joined if they result in prejudice
to the defendant or the government (Fed. R. Crim. P. 14 and similar state rules). Prej-
udice from joinder may result for the following reasons [Drew v. U.S. (D.C. Cir. 1964)].
1.
The defendant may need to present conflicting or inconsistent defenses to
each separate charge or forego a defense on one charge because it is
inconsistent.
2.
Because evidence will be presented on two or more charges, the jury may
think the defendant is a hard core criminal and convict accordingly.
3.
The jury may convict on the basis of the cumulative evidence, and not the
particular evidence that bears on each distinct charge.
Prejudice and confusion are more likely when two or more similar charges are
joined, such as two or three separate robberies. It is easier for most juries to completely
separate the evidence when there is joinder of offenses in one unified sequence of
crime, such as terroristic threatening followed by battery followed by resisting arrest.
Double jeopardy and collateral estoppel trap the prosecution team that fails to
weigh adequately the need to join charges having substantially overlapping elements
and facts. Any participation on your part in drawing up charging documents or fa-
cilitating the exchange of charging information between a misdemeanor prosecutor-
ial division and a felony prosecutorial division needs to be done with caution and
more detailed knowledge of double jeopardy than this text permits. Chapter 7 sum-
marizes some basic principles that will help you recognize danger areas. One of these
pitfalls is illustrated by the Grady v. Corbin (1990) ruling that barred prosecution for
vehicular homicide because the defendant pled guilty to a DUI charge. In such cases
it is absolutely imperative for state prosecutorial teams to coordinate their charging
procedures with the traffic division of local law enforcement agencies.8
A prosecutor may join defendants on a charging document and for trial when it
is alleged that they participated in the same criminal act or transaction or a series of
acts or transactions [Rule 8(b)]. This decision is subject to any Rule 14 concerns about
prejudice. The burden of proving any prejudice rests on the defense, who must file a
motion to sever the trials. Such a motion was granted for the two defendants in the
Oklahoma bombing case, resulting in separate trials. Severance is necessary when the
statement or confession of one defendant has incriminating references to the other
defendant and the first defendant refuses to testify. Without severance, the second de-
fendant is denied the Sixth Amendment right to confrontation, including cross-
examination to test the truth and accuracy of the matter in the statement. A judicial
instruction to the jury not to consider such evidence against the second defendant is
inadequate for removing the likely prejudice [Bruton v. U.S. (1968)]. The prosecution
may join the defendants if it agrees to delete those portions of any of the defendants’
statements that refer to another defendant. This editing process is called redaction.
Other evidentiary linkages in the first defendant’s statement that raise inferences of a
codefendant’s guilt do not have to be deleted and can be addressed by cautionary in-
structions to the jury [Richardson v. Marsh (1987)]. Simply redacting every reference to
the name of the other defendant in a codefendant’s confession, submitting instead
“delete” or “deletion,” was inadequate, even with a cautionary instruction to the jury
[Gray v. Maryland (1998)].
Bruton does not apply to any codefendant’s statement made in the course of and in
furtherance of a conspiracy [Dutton v. Evans (1970)]. Misjoinder will not automatically

bring a reversal of conviction on appeal if prejudice is found to be minimal or harmless
error [U.S. v. Lane (1986)].
IV.
DRAFTING THE COMPLAINT
A.
DRAFTING FROM THE INTAKE FORM
Once the prosecutor has made the decision regarding what charges are to be made and
the number of charges and defendants, you are ready to draft the complaint. Federal
Rule of Criminal Procedure 3 and respective state rules govern the requirements for a
criminal complaint. Annotated versions of the state and federal rules, which include
relevant case law, can be helpful to the drafter. The criminal complaint officially starts
the prosecution, provides a basis for arrest or notifies the accused to come to court, and
informs the accused of the specific crime charged. Drafting the complaint is not diffi-
cult, but it is critical to the prosecution of the case. Careful drafting is essential. The in-
take sheet has been designed to provide necessary information for the complaint: the
court, plaintiff (the people, state, commonwealth, United States, and so on), defendant,
where the crime occurred (jurisdiction), when it occurred, identification of the accuser,
the statute and penalty, and the date the complaint is signed. Stating the grounds for
the complaint is more involved and requires some drafting precision.
Using the standardized complaint form as a guide, add the elements of the crime
and necessary supporting facts. The following is an example of how to draft this por-
tion of the complaint in the Cordoba case.
EXAMPLE I
The affiant, Carmen Cordoba, says that on the 7th day of April, _____ , in Capitol
County, Columbia, the above-named defendant unlawfully took the diamond and
ruby ring belonging to the affiant valued at more than $500 with intent to deprive the
affiant of its possession. This was done against the peace and dignity of the State
of Columbia to wit: Theft in violation of C.R.S. 809.00 (a Class D felony).
Some jurisdictions require the statement of the maximum penalty as follows:
C.R.S. 809.00 (a Class D felony) is punishable by up to five years in prison, a
$10,000 fine, or both.
The federal courts and some state courts require additional facts about the crime
that give the defendant more notice regarding the reason for the charge and that bet-
ter comply with the requirement that the criminal complaint state probable cause to
believe that a crime was committed and that the defendant committed the crime. The
general rule in such jurisdictions is that the restatement of the statutory language is
not sufficient; facts must be alleged to support each element of the crime. Following
the structure of the complaint used in the federal district courts and some states, a
properly drafted complaint appears in Example II.
EXAMPLE II (ADDITIONAL FACTS)
I, the undersigned complainant, being duly sworn, state the following is true
and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief. On or about April 7, _____ ,
in Capitol County, in the state of Columbia, defendant(s) did take the diamond and
ruby ring valued at more than $500 belonging to the complainant with intent to deprive
the complainant of its possession _____________________________ in violation of
C.R.S. (or U.S. Code title) section 809.00.
I further state that this complaint is based on the following facts: that the
defendant gave said ring to complainant on the date of their first anniversary, that on
April 7, _____ , at which time defendant was separated from complainant, defendant
took said ring from complainant’s jewelry box and carried it away. Defendant admitted
taking the ring and has refused to return it. The ring is made of gold, diamonds, and
rubies and is worth more than $500.
complaint:
the document that officially
starts the prosecution, pro-
vides a basis for arrest or
notifies the accused to come
to court, and informs the
accused of the specific
crime charged.

Intake and Drafting the Complaint
■273
The allegation in the complaint, and that in the indictment later, states what must
be proved at trial, so draft the complaint with proof in mind. For example, note that
the allegation in the sample complaints states that the ring is worth more than $500,
the minimum value to comply with the statute. This statement avoids embarrassment
for the prosecutor if it is impossible to prove that the ring is worth $10,000, or amend-
ment of the document to conform with what is proved, which might not be allowed
in some circumstances. Therefore, draft the complaint to describe the offense ade-
quately, but so as not to lock the prosecutor into unprovable details. The rule of thumb
is to allege enough information to support each element of the crime while keeping
the details to a minimum.
In complex cases, take special care to name parties and charges accurately. Over-
lapping conspiracies and shared liabilities are particularly problematic. It is standard
policy to run a records check on a prospective defendant. If the check reveals that the
defendant has previous convictions, you may need to add a paragraph to the com-
plaint including the relevant statute and penalties for the defendant who is a repeat
offender. The check may also reveal aliases or potential danger to police officers serv-
ing a warrant, and it may be helpful at the defendant’s first appearance before the
judge for bail determination. Recent Supreme Court decisions indicate that it is pru-
dent to allege in the complaint any sentencing enhancement factors, with the appro-
priate statute number, that need to be proved for sentencing, such as the use of a gun,
level of cruelty, amount of illegal drugs, and hate crime factors [Apprendi v. New Jer-
sey (2000) and Blakely v. Washington (2004)]. Confer with your supervising attorney on
the desired approach in this regard. Apprendi and Blakely are discussed in Chapter 14.
These drafting guidelines also apply to drafting an indictment or information, to
be discussed later. An example of a completed multiple count criminal complaint is
given in Exhibit 8–10.
When you have completed the draft of the complaint, have the complainant (af-
fiant) read the document for accuracy and sign it. If the prosecutor decides not to file
the complaint, explain the reasons to the complainant. As previously discussed, pros-
ecutors have an obligation to screen out inappropriate or unprovable charges. A citi-
zen complainant may become upset when a complaint is rejected. How well you
explain the reasons for the rejection or suggest alternative methods or resources for
dealing with the matter is often the key to good public relations.
B.
DRAFTING FROM THE POLICE REPORT
Most frequently the complainant is a police officer. The officer should give you a copy
of the written report reflecting the results of the police investigation. You will be able
to draft the complaint based on the information in the report, with some occasional
clarification from the officer. The officer needs to sign the complaint. Police officers
generally simplify intake because they understand the process and criminal law bet-
ter than the average citizen does. Getting to the point is easier. Police officers may be
more resistant to being told that the charge lacks supporting evidence or that the pros-
ecuting attorney has decided not to charge, however.
A standardized crime report is presented in Exhibit 8–11.
Once again, whether the complainant is a victim or a police officer, make sure he
or she signs the complaint. This signature is vital, because the allegation in the com-
plaint is supported on the face of the complaint by the oath of the complainant. Sound
procedure requires that the complainant be sworn by a notary public, usually the para-
legal or a secretary in the office. The process requires the complainant to raise his or
her right hand and swear that the information in the complaint is true and correct
based on information and belief. Some officers become lax in executing this procedure,
making the complaint subject to attack and the prosecutor’s office subject to embar-
rassment and ethical concerns. The correct procedure also impresses on the com-
plainant the seriousness of the situation, which may prevent the filing of false or
unsustainable charges.
“Be brief, be pointed, let
your matter stand Lucid in
order, solid and at hand;
Spend not your words on tri-
fles but condense; Strike
with the mass of thought,
not drops of sense; Press to
the close with vigor, once
begun, And leave—how
hard the task!—leave off
when done.”
—Joseph Story, Advice to a
Young Lawyer, 1835

After you have taken all these charging factors into consideration, and have
drafted the complaint and had it reviewed and signed by the supervising attorney,
then you need to file the complaint with the clerk of the appropriate court. Make

V.
SUMMONS AND WARRANT
A.
SUMMONS
If you or your supervising attorney determine that the offense is relatively minor and the
defendant is likely to appear in court, draft a criminal summons. A criminal summons
is a document that, when signed by the judge (or clerk of court) and served on the de-

Intake and Drafting the Complaint
■275
fendant, requires the defendant to appear before the stated court at the prescribed date
and time. The drafted summons accompanies the signed complaint for approval by the
prosecuting attorney. Once approved, copies are made for the office file. The original
complaint and summons are filed with the clerk of the appropriate court. Copies of the
summons and complaint are sent to the police for personal service on the defendant or,
in some cases, may be mailed. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 4 and parallel state
rules authorize service of a summons in accordance with the respective rule of civil pro-
cedure. Check the appropriate rule and consult your supervising attorney for the ap-
propriate local practice. If the summons is delivered by personal service, the officer
verifies service on the “Return of Service” portion of the summons. See Exhibit 8–4.
B.
ARREST WARRANT
If the defendant was not arrested and the charge is serious, or whenever there is a
likelihood that the defendant might flee, draft a warrant for the defendant’s arrest.
An arrest warrant, when signed by a judge or magistrate, authorizes the police to
seek and place the defendant in custody. Because the warrant is a serious invasion of
individual liberty, use it only when necessary. The document must adequately de-
scribe the defendant. Chapter 9 provides more information on what must be alleged
to produce a constitutionally valid arrest warrant. An example of a completed arrest
warrant, adapted from the federal form [Exhibit 8–5(a)] is shown in Exhibit 8–12.
In some jurisdictions the arrest warrant is sufficient authorization to continue to
hold a previously arrested suspect. In other jurisdictions a commitment form or other
similar form must be drafted, approved by the prosecutor, and signed by the judge or
magistrate.
Whether you are drafting an arrest warrant or a commitment form, check the
practice in your jurisdiction to determine how detailed the language describing the
offense and the defendant needs to be. In some jurisdictions including most federal
jurisdictions, a brief restatement of the offense plus a sound description of the defen-
dant (full name and address, if available) are usually adequate. In other jurisdictions
a detailed probable cause statement, showing that a crime was committed and that it
was this person (the defendant) that committed it, is required. If the latter is true in
your jurisdiction, show facts in support of each element of the crime and give the
court and the police enough information to identify the defendant adequately. To do
less in such jurisdictions may subject the warrant, the arrest, and any evidence seized
during the arrest, to attack.
The warrant should accompany the complaint. Once both are reviewed by the
prosecuting attorney, file the complaint with the appropriate court clerk. Present a
copy of the filed complaint with the arrest warrant to the judge (or clerk in some
states) for signature. The warrant will then be given to the police so they can lawfully
make the arrest. If there is reason to suggest that the defendant may be armed or oth-
erwise dangerous, it is important to attach a note to the warrant to that effect. Rule 4
(Fed. R. Crim. P.) and parallel state rules govern warrant requirements and procedure.
C.
E-FILING AND MONITORING
In recent years federal and state court systems have made remarkable progress to-
ward the electronic filing and management of case documents. The federal judiciary’s
Case Management/Electronic Case Files system (CM/ECF) is being implemented in-
crementally in federal district courts across the country. Court-issued passwords give
access to the well-based system. After logging in and providing information about the
case, the relevant document is attached and sent. Filing is electronically confirmed.
Information on CM/ECF is available at www.uscourts.gov/cmecf.
In 2004, the U.S. Judicial Conference approved the implementation of electronic ac-
cess to U.S. district court criminal case files through Public Access to Electronic Records
arrest warrant:
a document that, when
signed by a judge or magis-
trate, authorizes the police
to seek and place the defen-
dant in custody.

PACER (Public Access to
Electronic Records):
the system for electronic
access to federal court file
documents.
(PACER). Criminal case documents filed via this system must exclude information that
might be used for identity theft, that is, social security numbers, dates of birth, financial
accounts, and other similar information. The responsibility for deleting this type of in-
formation rests with the attorney, but is often done by the paralegal. Information on
PACER is available at 800-676-6856 or www.pacer.uscourts.gov. Be sure to confirm the
availability of electronic filing and document access in the court relevant to your case.

CHECKLIST FOR DRAFTING AND FILING THE
SUMMONS AND WARRANT
Part of your job is to make your work and the work of others in the office efficient and
error free. Standardized procedural checklists can be useful in that regard. Prepara-
tion of checklists can save you considerable time in the future, especially when stored
in the appropriate place in your system folder. Use your experience to build on this
drafting and filing checklist.
docket:
the court schedule for each
day; sets out the name of
the case, the attorneys, the
charge, and the nature of
the appearance.

■
Draft commitment if required by jurisdiction to keep defendant in jail.
■

■
Print copies of all documents, place in office file.
■

■
File signed warrant with clerk for service by police.
■
Record case file number and place in office folder.
VI.
DOCKET TRACKING
One of your assigned tasks may be docket control or tracking. Each court and branch
of court publishes a criminal docket for each day. The docket sheet sets out the name
of the case, the attorneys, the charge, and the nature of the appearance (initial ap-
pearance, motion hearing, trial, and so forth). In some jurisdictions the clerk of court
divides the schedule into several dockets: one for motions; one for nontrial matters
(no-issue dockets) for arraignments, pleas, and other hearings; and one for trials.
Many of today’s dockets are electronically accessible.
Check the docket each day, noting the cases that involve your supervising attorney
or attorneys. Notify each of the attorneys of any scheduled appearances and the nature
of the appearance, and provide the case file for the attorney’s review. Upon return of the
files, check to see if the result of the appearance is noted, for example, “defendant pled
not guilty, trial date June 6, _____ , at 9:00 A.M.” If not, obtain results from either the at-
torney or the clerk of court. See to it that any key dates are calendared on the office mas-

Intake and Drafting the Complaint
■277
ter calendar, the attorney’s calendar, and your calendar. In the case of trials and other
matters requiring preparation time, work back from the due date and record preparation
dates allowing for adequate time to complete the work. This type of “tickler” process
should keep the attorneys and the paralegal aware of what needs to be done and when.
Further, victims of crimes appreciate being informed of the regular progress of the
case. Because prosecution offices are so busy, attorneys rarely have the time to do this.
By assuming the responsibility of keeping victims informed, you can perform a service
that is truly appreciated and is good public relations for the prosecutor’s office as well.
VII.
CONCLUSION
Here it begins. Your painstaking study pays off when your first complainant walks
through the door. You can prepare for the interview with confidence because you are
familiar with the necessary forms and have references to helpful resources at hand.
You know how to focus interview questions to obtain the facts you need.
Because you have code books and a working knowledge of the elements of spe-
cific crimes, you can match facts and statutes for accurate charges. Problems that are
inappropriate for the criminal justice system you channel elsewhere. People coming
to you can count on compassionate, knowledgeable, and truthful assistance.
You will become familiar with local practice and gain expertise with experience in
drafting complaints, summons, and warrants. The process of filing documents may
seem a bit daunting now, but soon will be second nature to you.As you work in the crim-
inal justice system, you will learn the rhythms of docket tracking and deadline control.
From the point of intake on, you are no longer performing an academic exercise,
you are working to deliver justice. When the first complainant walks through your
door, you will not need to be reminded how important your work is to that person.

CHAPTER 8
FROM SURVIVING AND HEALING FROM SEXUAL ASSAULT
This brochure is a start in the direction of gaining knowledge to assist you in the healing.
If you have been raped or sexually assaulted, you have experienced a frightening, life threatening
trauma.
It is important to remember:
You are not to blame—The rapist is solely responsible for his actions.
Rape is a violent crime.
You have probably been threatened with death, mutilation, or violence.
Survival means you have done the right thing.
No one asks or deserves to be raped.
Think of yourself not as a victim, but as a survivor.
Reactions
People who are raped or sexually assaulted may have many of the following reactions. Remember, these are
normal and in most cases will be temporary.
FEARS—possibly panic, anxiety, fear of being alone or in certain places or situations.
ANGER—possibly rage, irritability, alienation from family or friends.
DEPRESSION—may include crying, withdrawal, isolation, wanting to be alone.
PHYSICAL REACTIONS—nausea, headaches, changes in eating, sleeping, or menstrual cycle.
You may feel dirty, ashamed, guilty, humiliated, or responsible.
You may experience mood swings, behavior changes, inability to concentrate or relax.
These reactions may be more difficult to handle on holidays, the anniversary date of the assault, or with
an event that reminds you of the rape.
Remember, you have experienced a loss and will be grieving that loss.
What To Do If You Are Raped or Sexually Assaulted
Remember you don’t have to go through this alone.
Be honest with yourself about your feelings and thoughts.
Recognize your survival and try not to punish yourself with “If only . . .”
Talk to people you trust.
Take care of yourself—get rest, plan comforting activities, avoid excessive use of alcohol or drugs.
Ask for help if necessary from family, friends, police, doctors, counselors.
Be honest with those people to whom you turn.
If the pain becomes too great or you feel you are not adjusting well, you may want to seek professional
help.
Healing takes time.
FROM THE AFTERMATH OF RAPE
Police
It is your decision whether or not to file a police report, even if law enforcement has already been notified of
the crime. There are advantages and disadvantages to filing this report.
Advantages:
You establish the fact that a crime has been committed and you are exercising your rights.
The rapist may be found and prosecuted, preventing further perpetration.
You may be eligible for Crime Victim Compensation funds.
Disadvantages:
It may be difficult for you to retell your story numerous times, especially those details that are necessary
for investigation.
Police have the responsibility to investigate and their style of questioning may not be the most sensitive.
EXHIBIT 8–7
Assault Counseling Brochure

Intake and Drafting the Complaint
■287
If You Do Report:
You must be truthful in each statement that you make. If you don’t remember something, or recall a
different detail later, present it as just that.
You may find it helpful to write down the sequence of events before being interviewed. This may help
with recall.
Remember that the law enforcement agent is a professional who is discussing very delicate information
for the purpose of investigation.
Expect the police officer to treat you with the respect that he/she would offer any victim of a crime.
Get the name, serial or badge number, and business telephone number of any officer with whom you have
contact.
Hospital
You are strongly encouraged to go to an emergency room immediately. Again, this is your choice, but there
are advantages and disadvantages. Even if you decide against the emergency room, medical follow-up to a
rape is always recommended.
Advantages:
You can be assessed for physical trauma or injury and treated for this.
Available evidence will be collected and maintained for prosecution if you decide to go to court.
You will be evaluated and treated for sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy.
You can be referred for appropriate follow-up treatments.
Disadvantages:
You will be required to tell the details of the story, possibly before you feel ready to do this.
You will be examined in a manner that may be reminiscent of the rape and may be uncomfortable.
You will not be handled as a high-risk patient and may be required to wait.
If You Go to the Emergency Room:
Don’t bathe, douche, or use mouth wash. If possible, avoid using bathroom facilities prior to the
examination.
Go prepared to leave your clothing for evidence.
Be as specific as possible in response to the questions asked by the nurses and doctors.
Expect to be treated as a medical patient who is requiring a medical response to trauma.
Courts
If the perpetrator is apprehended, you still have the choice regarding cooperation with prosecution. You
need to be aware that even if you choose to prosecute, the prosecutors, grand jury, or judge may feel the
evidence is not strong enough to proceed.
Advantages:
Unless stopped, perpetrators of sexual assault will continue.
You are exercising your right to due process of the law.
The public record may bring forward other victims of the perpetrator.
Disadvantages:
You will be telling your story numerous times, some of them in public.
The defense attorney will use all strategies available within the law to prove the defendant is innocent
beyond a reasonable doubt.
You may discover some of your support systems choosing the other side.
If You Decide to Prosecute:
Be completely honest in giving information that is requested.
Write down the details of the assault so that you will have a clear memory for the trial.
Prepare yourself to see the perpetrator.
Prepare yourself for delays.

VICTIM IMPACT STATEMENT
This statement is submitted to the probation officer responsible for preparing the presentence investigation
report for inclusion in the report or to the court should such a report be waived by the defendant. The vic-
tim impact statement shall be considered by the court prior to any decision on the sentencing or release, in-
cluding shock probation, of the defendant. (K.R.S. 421.520)

EXHIBIT 8–8
Victim Impact Statement
Prepare yourself to be questioned publicly, dressing and using cosmetics in a manner that will not bias
the jury against you.
Be prepared for the defendant to be found not guilty or guilty of a lesser crime. This does not mean people
don’t believe you were raped. It means that the evidence did not convince the courts beyond a reasonable
doubt.
Remember, you are not the one on trial and you neither asked for nor deserved to be raped.
You have rights: to an interpreter if you are deaf or are not fluent in English, to closed hearings if you are
a minor, to have an attorney present for all court transactions, to be informed of reports and proceedings, to
all records that are public information, to be asked only questions relative to the case, and to information on
the assailant’s parole or release dates if he is convicted and sentenced.
You have a right to sue the suspect in civil court.

VERIFICATION OF APPLICATION: I, hereby certify, subject to penalty, fine or imprisonment, that the information
contained in this application for Crime Victims Compensation is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.
SUBROGATION: In consideration of the payment received from the Crime Victims Compensation Board, I agree to
repay the full amount I received from the fund in the event I recover damages or compensation from the offender
or from any other public or private source as a result of the injuries or death which was the basis of my claim for
compensation from the fund. I understand that compensation from any other public or private source includes, but
is not limited to, receipt of insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, workers compensation, disability pay, etc. I further agree
and understand that no part of recovery due the Crime Victims Compensation Board may be diminished by any col-

notify the Crime Victims Compensation Board by sending copies of any pleadings, settlement proposals and any

Facts to Support Charge:
Suspect attacked Ms. Lamb who was walking toward her car following her night class. Suspect grabbed victim
around the arms from behind, knocked her down, sat on top of her, and began to tear away her jacket and blouse.
Suspect held knife and said in low voice, “Now you’re going to get what all pretty little college girls ask for.” Victim
screamed, knocked suspect off of her, and ran toward her car. Suspect pursued her. At bridge, victim thought male
approaching from the opposite side was with suspect. She screamed and jumped over railing of bridge and landed
on rocks. Suspect fled according to Henry Peel, who was approaching from car lot. Peel phoned police.
Peel said he did not get very good view of suspect but described him as medium build wearing green army jacket
and camouflage trousers. He fled back toward campus and disappeared in the trees. As first officer on scene, I
found victim unconscious. She was transported to hospital. Five days later after waking from a coma, she stated to
Detective Smythe that even though the lighting was poor she identified the suspect as night janitor who works in
the Hunt classroom building. Maintenance informed the police that the janitor on duty that evening was Eldon
Spiers. Detective Smythe went to Spiers’ apartment.The suspect answered the door. When the detective identified
himself, Spiers said, “I thought you might come,” and then refused to answer questions. He was arrested.
Victim is still in serious condition, has lapsed back into a coma and may die, according to her physician.

I.
INTRODUCTION
AMENDMENT IV
The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against
unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue,
but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing
the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.
[T]hese [Fourth Amendment rights], I protest, are not mere second class rights but
belong in the catalog of indispensable freedoms. Among deprivation of rights, none is so
effective in cowing a population, crushing the spirit of the individual and putting terror
in every heart. Uncontrolled search and seizure is one of the first and most effective
weapons in the arsenal of every arbitrary government.
—Justice Jackson, Brinegar v. U.S. (1949)
It is four in the morning in muggy late summer and you are at home with your fam-
ily and all are asleep. You hear a sound, a loud knock at the door followed by a ter-
rible crashing noise, rushing footsteps, shouting! You try in vain to discern what is
being shouted, but you cannot. The sound of the footsteps gets louder, your bed-
room door is thrust open and smashes against the wall. Suddenly bright lights
shine painfully into your sleepy eyes. “Police! This is the police!” You cannot see,
you struggle to move, but sleep-filled limbs and a growing terror leave you para-
lyzed. Strangers are shouting at you, “Stand up. Hands against the wall.” Modesty
causes you to try to cover yourself with the bedsheet, but as you grab for it, it is
ripped from your hand. You hear screaming from familiar voices, more shouting
from distant rooms. You are pushed against the wall and every inch of your body
is searched. Drawers are being opened; your possessions are being thrown around.
You are being pushed here, then there. You fall down. Someone grabs you hard
and yells, “Get up!” You begin to cry and find yourself shaking uncontrollably.
“Where are the drugs? WHERE ARE THE DRUGS?” You cannot believe what is
happening. You close your eyes and say to yourself, “Please, please, let this be a
nightmare.”
Scenes similar to this have occurred regularly throughout history and will be re-
peated. They become graphically real on the multitude of police shows inundating
prime-time television. The fear that government, through the police or military, may
barge in and completely destroy a person’s life and the lives of loved ones has led to
constitutions like our own that restrain the reach and power of government and at-
tempt to preserve human dignity and freedom.
Not only is the constitutional limitation of police procedure one of the most im-
portant areas of criminal law, but it also may be the most interesting. It provides fas-
cinating conflict between the need for aggressive law enforcement and the desire to
define and preserve liberties enumerated in the Constitution.
Understanding this conflict is vital to your work as a paralegal in criminal law.
It comes into play when you assist the prosecutor in providing counsel to law en-
forcement officers, juvenile officers, probation and parole officers, and others on
what is allowed in arrest, search, and seizure; when you work for the defense at-
torney preparing motions to suppress the evidence acquired during search and
seizure; when you assist the prosecutor in responding to those motions; or when as
a judicial clerk you research a judge’s response to memoranda from both sides on a
suppression of evidence issue. Furthermore, you will gain valuable insight into
your own rights.
“It is not only under Nazi
rule that police excesses are
inimical to freedom. It is
easy to make light of insis-
tence on scrupulous regard
for the safeguards of civil lib-
erties when invoked on be-
half of the unworthy. . . .
History bears testimony that
by such disregard are the
rights of liberty extinguished,
heedlessly, at first, then
stealthily, and brazenly in
the end.”
—Felix Frankfurter Davis v.
United States, 328 U.S. 582
(1946)

Search and Seizure
■309
II.
SCOPE OF THE FOURTH AMENDMENT
A.
STATE ACTION
The general rule of the Fourth Amendment is that the police must obtain a warrant from
a magistrate before conducting a search or seizure. The scope of the Fourth Amend-
ment, however, is limited and does not apply in all circumstances. Therefore, efficiency
dictates that warrants not be issued unless they are necessary. The police come to you
and ask for a warrant to search a residence, to look into a vehicle, to place a video cam-
era in the restroom of a business, to fly over a fenced backyard to find marijuana, to use
a dog to sniff luggage on a bus, or to tap into a computer bulletin board. Should you
draft a warrant in anticipation of the prosecuting attorney’s approval or not?
To start, the Fourth Amendment limits the exercise of government power. It is ap-
plicable to the states through the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
[Roaden v. Kentucky (1973)] and, therefore, applies to conduct of federal and state offi-
cers and officials [Lanza v. N.Y. (1962) and Burdeau v. McDowell (1921)]. Such conduct
is called state action. Thus, searches by the following have been held to be state ac-
tion and subject to the restraints of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments: all law
enforcement officers and officials, public school teachers [New Jersey v. T.L.O. (1985)],
state hospital staff [Ferguson v. City of Charleston (2001)], airport security personnel
when acting pursuant to federal law, social workers, conservation officers, a tax ap-
praiser and a board of dental examiners, and merchants and store security when au-
thorized by law to detain and search suspected shoplifters, but not a licensed security
guard or a prison chaplain.1
Generally, private persons are not subject to Fourth Amendment restraints, but
they may be if they act as an agent of the government. Whether a private person’s con-
duct becomes state action is determined by an examination of the totality of the cir-
cumstances [Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives Association (1989) and State v. Buswell
(Minn. 1990) cert. denied (1991)] according to the following criteria: (1) whether gov-
ernment officials knew of or acquiesced in the search or seizure and (2) whether the
private individual performing the intrusive conduct intended to assist the govern-
ment or further that individual’s own ends [U.S. v. Miller (9th Cir. 1982)]. Trash col-
lectors, who had been contacted by police, picked up a defendant’s trash, separated it
from the rest of the trash, did not inspect it, and gave it to police, were held to be act-
ing as state agents [State v. Hauser (N.C. App. 1994), affirmed (N.C. 1995)]. Bounty
hunter/bail bonds officers under contract with the government, however, were held
to be private, not state agents, in Akins v. U.S. (D.C. App. 1996). Further, the Fourth
Amendment does not apply to agents of the United States outside United States bor-
ders and territories, even if the search is of a United States citizen [U.S. v. Verdugo-
Urquidez (1990)].
B.
REASONABLE EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY
Next, courts decided the need for warrants based on whether the police intrusion was
directed at “persons, houses, papers, and effects,” the specific language of the Fourth
Amendment that focuses on location and types of property. In the landmark case of
Katz v. U.S. (1967), however, the United States Supreme Court brought the law into
the age of technology by ruling that tapping the phone line of a public telephone
booth was a search under the Fourth Amendment. In its ruling the Court said that the
Fourth Amendment is intended to “protect people, not places.” This ruling shifted the
focus from whether some type of physical trespass occurred to whether the person
had a justifiable expectation of privacy.
state action:
conduct of a state, its
employees, and agents.

CHAPTER 9
Mr. Justice STEWART delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The petitioner was convicted in the District Court for the
Southern District of California under an eight-count indict-
ment charging him with transmitting wagering information
by telephone from Los Angeles to Miami and Boston, in vio-
lation of a federal statute. At trial the Government was per-
mitted, over the petitioner’s objection, to introduce evidence
of the petitioner’s end of telephone conversations, over-
heard by FBI agents who had attached an electronic listen-
ing and recording device to the outside of the public
telephone booth from which he had placed his calls. In af-
firming his conviction, the Court of Appeals rejected the con-
tention that the recordings had been obtained in violation of
the Fourth Amendment, because “[t]here was no physical
entrance into the area occupied by [the petitioner].” We
granted certiorari in order to consider the constitutional
questions thus presented.
The petitioner has phrased those questions as follows:
“A.Whether a public telephone booth is a constitutionally
protected area so that evidence obtained by attaching an
electronic listening recording device to the top of such a
booth is obtained in violation of the right to privacy of the
user of the booth.
“B.Whether physical penetration of a constitutionally pro-
tected area is necessary before a search and seizure
can be said to be violative of the Fourth Amendment to
the United States Constitution.”
We decline to adopt this formulation of the issues. In the
first place, the correct solution of Fourth Amendment prob-
lems is not necessarily promoted by incantation of the
phrase “constitutionally protected area.” Secondly, the
Fourth Amendment cannot be translated into a general con-
stitutional “right to privacy.” That Amendment protects indi-
vidual privacy against certain kinds of governmental
intrusion, but its protections go further, and often have noth-
ing to do with privacy at all. Other provisions of the Consti-
tution protect personal privacy from other forms of
governmental invasion.But the protection of a person’s gen-
eral right to privacy—his right to be let alone by other peo-
ple—is, like the protection of his property and of his very life,
left largely to the law of the individual States.
Because of the misleading way the issues have been for-
mulated, the parties have attached great significance to the
characterization of the telephone booth from which the pe-
titioner placed his calls. The petitioner has strenuously ar-
gued that the booth was a “constitutionally protected area.”
The Government has maintained with equal vigor that it was
not. But this effort to decide whether or not a given “area,”
viewed in the abstract, is “constitutionally protected” deflects
attention from the problem presented by this case. For the
Fourth Amendment protects people, not places.What a per-
son knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home
or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection.
But what he seeks to preserve as private, even in an area
accessible to the public, may be constitutionally protected.
The Government stresses the fact that the telephone
booth from which the petitioner made his calls was con-
structed partly of glass, so that he was as visible after he en-
tered it as he would have been if he had remained outside.But
what he sought to exclude when he entered the booth was not
the intruding eye—it was the uninvited ear.He did not shed his
right to do so simply because he made his calls from a place
where he might be seen. No less than an individual in a busi-
ness office, in a friend’s apartment, or in a taxicab, a person in
a telephone booth may rely upon the protection of the Fourth
Amendment.One who occupies it, shuts the door behind him,
and pays the toll that permits him to place a call is surely en-
titled to assume that the words he utters into the mouthpiece
will not be broadcast to the world. To read the Constitution
more narrowly is to ignore the vital role that the public tele-
phone has come to play in private communication.
. . .
. . .The Government’s activities in electronically listening to
and recording the petitioner’s words violated the privacy upon
which he justifiably relied while using the telephone booth and
thus constituted a “search and seizure” within the meaning of
the Fourth Amendment. The fact that the electronic device
employed to achieve that end did not happen to penetrate the
wall of the booth can have no constitutional significance.
The question remaining for decision, then, is whether the
search and seizure conducted in this case complied with
constitutional standards. In that regard, the Government’s
position is that its agents acted in an entirely defensible
manner: They did not begin their electronic surveillance un-
til investigation of the petitioner’s activities had established
a strong probability that he was using the telephone in ques-
tion to transmit gambling information to persons in other
States, in violation of federal law. Moreover, the surveillance
was limited, both in scope and in duration, to the specific

purpose of establishing the contents of the petitioner’s un-
lawful telephonic communications. The agents confined
their surveillance to the brief periods during which he used
the telephone booth, and they took great care to overhear
only the conversations of the petitioner himself.
Accepting this account of the Government’s actions as
accurate, it is clear that this surveillance was so narrowly cir-
cumscribed that a duly authorized magistrate, properly no-
tified of the need for such investigation, specifically informed
of the basis on which it was to proceed, and clearly apprised
of the precise intrusion it would entail, could constitutionally
have authorized, with appropriate safeguards, the very lim-
ited search and seizure that the Government asserts in fact
took place. . . .
The Government . . . urges the creation of a new excep-
tion to cover this case. It argues that surveillance of a tele-
phone booth should be exempted from the usual
requirement of advance authorization by a magistrate upon
a showing of probable cause.We cannot agree. Omission of
such authorization
“bypasses the safeguards provided by an objective pre-
determination of probable cause, and substitutes instead
the far less reliable procedure of an after-the-event justi-
fication for the . . . search, too likely to be subtly influ-
enced by the familiar shortcomings of hindsight
judgment.” Beck v. Ohio, 379 U.S. 89, 96.
And bypassing a neutral predetermination of the scope of a
search leaves individuals secure from Fourth Amendment
violations “only in the discretion of the police.”
These considerations do not vanish when the search in
question is transferred from the setting of a home, an office,
or a hotel room to that of a telephone booth.Wherever a man
may be, he is entitled to know that he will remain free from un-
reasonable searches and seizures. The government agents
here ignored “the procedure of antecedent justification . . .
that is central to the Fourth Amendment,” a procedure that we
hold to be a constitutional precondition of the kind of elec-
tronic surveillance involved in this case. Because the surveil-
lance here failed to meet that condition, and because it led to
the petitioner’s conviction, the judgment must be reversed.
It is so ordered.
Mr. Justice HARLAN, concurring.
. . .
As the Court’s opinion states, “the Fourth Amendment
protects people, not places.” The question, however, is what
protection it affords to those people. Generally, as here, the
answer to that question requires reference to a “place.” My
understanding of the rule that has emerged from prior deci-
sions is that there is a twofold requirement, first that a per-
son have exhibited an actual (subjective) expectation of
privacy and, second, that the expectation be one that soci-
ety is prepared to recognize as “reasonable.” . .
. . . The point is not that the booth is “accessible to the
public” at other times, but that it is a temporarily private
place whose momentary occupants’ expectations of free-
dom from intrusion are recognized as reasonable.
. . .
Mr. Justice BLACK, dissenting.
. . .
The Fourth Amendment protects privacy only to the ex-
tent that it prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures of
“persons, houses, papers, and effects.” No general right is
created by the Amendment so as to give this Court the un-
limited power to hold unconstitutional everything which af-
fects privacy. Certainly the Framers, well acquainted as they
were with the excesses of governmental power, did not in-
tend to grant this Court such omnipotent lawmaking author-
ity as that. The history of governments proves that it is
dangerous to freedom to repose such powers in courts.
For these reasons I respectfully dissent.
Note that under Katz one does not have to establish a right of privacy to be pro-
tected, but simply a reasonable expectation of privacy. That expectation of privacy
reaches its highest level in one’s dwelling, including apartments, motel rooms, or
even a camper’s tent, as in Alward v. State (Nev. 1996). Although police can look into
a house from common public areas such as porches, sidewalks, a neighbor’s drive-
way, or the foyer of an apartment building without violating an expectation of pri-
vacy, the uninvited entry of police into the front hallway of a house is a violation and,
therefore, is a Fourth Amendment search.
The availability of increasingly sophisticated technology, however, has blurred
the legal line between outside and inside. Extremely sensitive devices for listening,
sniffing, and viewing (X-ray, telephotography, infrared imaging, and others) pene-
trate areas formerly protected by walls, clothing, and other barriers. Satellite technol-
ogy further expands these capabilities. Does this mean people can no longer have a
reasonable expectation of privacy, even in their homes? Can the courts redefine the
line between inside and outside? Those questions were explored by the U.S. Supreme
Court in Kyllo v. U.S. (2001). Department of Interior agents used a thermal imaging

312
■
CHAPTER 9
device to see if Kyllo might be using grow lights to cultivate marijuana in his unit of
a triplex. The device showed a suspicious amount of heat emanating from his
dwelling. This information helped support a request for a search warrant, which led
to Kyllo’s prosecution. He challenged the use of the thermal device on the grounds
that it violated his reasonable expectation of privacy. The government argued that the
device did not violate the Fourth Amendment, because the agents were outside the
home, and the device only recorded heat outside the home. On appeal of his convic-
tion, the Court of Appeals ruled that the device did not reveal “intimate activities
within the building” and, therefore, did not come within the scope of the Fourth
Amendment [U.S. v. Kyllo (9th Cir. 1999)]. Granting certiorari, the U.S. Supreme Court
used Kyllo to reaffirm Katz and establish a bright dividing line for the current and fu-
ture use of technology by law enforcement in the context of dwellings. The Court said,
In the home, our cases show, all details are intimate details, because the entire area is
held safe from prying government eyes . . . . We have said, that the Fourth Amendment
draws ‘a firm line at the entrance to the house’ . . . . We think that obtaining by sense-
enhancing technology any information regarding the interior of the home that could not
otherwise have been obtained without physical ‘intrusion into a constitutionally
protected area,’ . . . constitutes a search—at least where (as here) the technology in
question is not in general public use. This assures preservation of that degree of privacy
against government that existed when the Fourth Amendment was adopted. On the
basis of this criteria, the information obtained by the thermal imager in this case was the
product of a search.
A reasonable expectation of privacy extends to the curtilage of the dwelling, the
area of land, enclosed or otherwise, around a house or other buildings that is used for
domestic purposes. Curtilage is protected under the Fourth Amendment, except
pathways for entry and exit. In U.S. v. Dunn (1987) the Supreme Court set out four
considerations for defining the limits of curtilage: proximity of land to the house,
whether it is enclosed (by a fence, for example) with the house, the nature of its use,
and the existence of landscaping devices and other steps to shield that land from the
view of passersby. Even if the property is defined as curtilage, however, aerial
searches of that curtilage are not restricted. In Florida v. Riley (1989) curtilage was be-
yond the protection of the Fourth Amendment when searched by helicopter above the
walled-in back yard and greenhouse.
We recognized that the yard was within the curtilage of the house, that a fence shielded
the yard from observation from the street and that the occupant had a subjective
expectation of privacy. We held, however, that such an expectation was not reasonable
and not one “that society is prepared to honor.” . . . “In an age where private and
commercial flight in the public airways is routine, it is unreasonable for respondent to
expect that his marijuana plants were constitutionally protected from being observed
with the naked eye from an altitude of 1,000 feet. The Fourth Amendment simply does
not require the police traveling in the public airways at this altitude to obtain a war-
rant in order to observe what is visible to the naked eye.”
We arrive at the same conclusion in the present case. . . . [quoting from California
v. Ciraolo (1986)]
A shed used for a part-time welding business that was not locked and where the
defendant did not object when another person walked out of the shed, did not hold
the requisite expectation of privacy [U.S. v. Cardoza-Hinojosa (5th Cir. 1998)]. The en-
closed land around commercial property is subject to aerial scrutiny [Dow Chemical v.
U.S. (1986)], but courts differ on whether such fenced property is protected from sur-
face searches. Even buildings beyond the home or office may be protected. The Court
in U.S. v. Dunn (1987) held that a barn located well beyond the owner’s curtilage line
was probably protected by the reasonable expectation of privacy standard, but that
officers had the right to peer into the barn from the noncurtilage or open fields land.
curtilage:
the area of land, enclosed or
otherwise, around a house
or other buildings that is
used for domestic purposes.

Search and Seizure
■313
Open fields are the resident’s lands beyond the curtilage and, therefore, are not
protected by the Fourth Amendment [Hester v. U.S. (1924) and Oliver v. U.S. (1984)].
The lands may be fenced and posted with no trespassing signs, but they are still open
fields [U.S. v. Dunn (1987)].
Some courts have interpreted their state constitutions to be more protective of open
fields than the United States Supreme Court’s interpretation of the federal Constitution.
Barbed wire fencing, no trespassing signs, and other clear indications of an expectation
of privacy brought the fields into the warrant requirement under the states’ equivalent
of the Fourth Amendment [State v. Kirchoff (Vt. 1991) and People v. Scott (N.Y. 1992)].
Offices, stores, industrial plants, and similar buildings have come under the pro-
tection of the Fourth Amendment [See v. City of Seattle (1967)]. The public areas in
these same businesses and stores, however, are more akin to common corridors, side-
walks, and parks and, therefore, there is no expectation of privacy. Areas in which
there is some expectation of privacy, however, such as changing rooms and restrooms,
are protected to varying degrees, depending on the circumstances. For example, use
of a convenience store’s unisex restroom by a couple for prostitution and consump-
tion of illegal drugs exceeded the intended use of the facility, and, therefore, there was
no reasonable expectation of privacy [U.S. v. Hill (8th Cir. 2005)].
If a vehicle is in open view, an officer may examine its exterior and look through
the windows to examine its interior [Cardwell v. Lewis (1974) and New York v. Class
(1986)]. Entering the vehicle is a search, unless it is clear the owner has relinquished
any reasonable expectations of privacy (Class).
A person’s effects are tangible, movable property, normally carried, worn, or
stored. They bear an intimate relation to the person in possession. Articles that may
contain other items, such as a suitcase, clothing, appliances, and the like, may be
searched externally from a legal vantage point. Opening such items normally requires
a warrant. A law enforcement agent who felt a bus passenger’s bag to see if there was
anything suspicious in it violated the passenger’s expectation of privacy [Bond v. U.S.
(2000)]. Use of a trained canine cop is not an unlawful search of luggage [U.S. v. Place
(1983)], nor is the reopening of a package after a postal inspection once the package is
surrendered for delivery [Illinois v. Andreas (1983)]. There is no difference in degree of
Fourth Amendment protection between property seized solely for evidence and that
seized as fruit of a crime [Warden v. Hayden (1967)].
If property is abandoned, no reasonable expectation of privacy exists. An aban-
doned residence is open to search without a warrant, as is the satchel dropped by a
person fleeing police [California v. Hodari D. (1991). Luggage left on a bus after police
questioned passengers was held to be abandoned, and a police search of a suspect’s
garbage left on the curb for pickup was not a Fourth Amendment search [California v.
Greenwood (1988)].
Based on the search cases discussed, do you think a person has a justified expec-
tation of privacy in telephone records, bank transactions, or photo development ser-
vices? A string of cases supports the principle that whenever you share information
such as telephone numbers, deposit amounts, or exposed film with another such as a
bank or the telephone company, that information is not protected by the Fourth
Amendment [Smith v. Maryland (1979) and U.S. v. Miller (1976)].2 Sending a computer
with its stored data to a repair shop was found to eliminate any reasonable expecta-
tion of privacy and, therefore, an FBI warrantless search of the data, which revealed
pornographic images of children, was upheld [U.S. v. Hall (7th Cir. 1998)].
Computer files, including e-mail, have required the courts to explore whether ex-
isting principles of search and seizure law apply. A growing body of decisions, both
civil and criminal, have ruled there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in either
business or personal e-mail [U.S. v. Charbonneau (S.D. Ohio 1997) and U.S. v. Maxwell
(C.M.A. 1996)]. Such an expectation seems reasonable, however, where data is pro-
tected by a personal password. Encrypted data, however, may be treated more like
data in a foreign language; if it is open to view, then it is open to being “translated.”3
Police use of a keystroke logger, installed pursuant to a warrant, to get the defendant’s
open fields:
the resident’s lands beyond
the curtilage and, therefore,
not protected by the Fourth
Amendment.

CHAPTER 9
ANALYSIS PROBLEM
9–1.
You are asked as a judge to decide whether police may enter a bus and
use new X-ray devices to examine both passengers and bags for weapons,
drugs, or other suspicious items and then use the information to arrest and
prosecute violators of the law. What is your decision based on the cases
defining a reasonable expectation of privacy?
password to encrypted computer communications was held legal in U.S. v. Scarfo
(D.N.J. 2001). This area of search and seizure law is discussed further in the section on
electronic surveillance near the end of this chapter.
Medical treatment and corresponding records carry a high expectation of privacy.
Therefore, a hospital staff’s sharing with police the results of nonconsensual cocaine
drug tests from pregnant patients, absent a warrant, constituted an unlawful search
[Ferguson v. City of Charleston (2001)].
New questions and possible definitions of a reasonable expectation of privacy
will likely arise because of the war on terrorism, the use of technology, and the stor-
age of large amounts of personal information in state and national electronic data-
banks. The contexts include increased use of surveillance by planes, satellites, and
X-rays; video cameras in businesses, parking lots, traffic intersections, public hous-
ing, and other public locations; and databanks covering the DNA of all arrestees, fi-
nancial purchases, prescription purchases, credit ratings, and numerous other types
of personal information. Further discussion of expanded government access to per-
sonal information held by third parties when related to foreign intelligence and ter-
rorism investigations is reviewed in this chapter’s section on electronic surveillance.
Who is entitled to challenge a Fourth Amendment search? Anyone who has suffi-
cient interest or an expectation of privacy in the property has the standing to challenge
the search. Normally that is quite clear, but some residences are in a transitional phase
that confuses the issue. For example, does a boyfriend who was thrown out of an
apartment but still keeps most of his belongings there have standing to challenge the
search of the apartment? Does a man who visited his fiancee and established a parental
relationship with her son have standing to challenge a warrantless search of her apart-
ment? New York said yes to both questions [People v. Moss (N.Y. App. 1990) and People
v. Rice (N.Y. 1990)]. Even an overnight guest has sufficient interest to challenge the
search [Minnesota v. Olson (1990)]. But, does a short-term guest have a reasonable ex-
pectation of privacy? This issue was addressed in Minnesota v. Carter (1998).
MINNESOTA v. CARTER
Supreme Court of the United States
525 U.S. 83, 119 S.Ct. 469 (1998)
[Citations omitted]
Chief Justice REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the
Court.
Respondents [Defendants] and the lessee of an apartment
were sitting in one of its rooms, bagging cocaine. While so
engaged they were observed by a police officer, who looked
through a drawn window blind. The Supreme Court of Min-
nesota held that the officer’s viewing was a search which vi-
olated respondents’ Fourth Amendment rights.
. . .
[Defendants] Carter and Johns . . . had come to the
apartment for the sole purpose of packaging the cocaine.

Search and Seizure
■315
Carter and Johns had never been to the apartment before
and were only in the apartment for approximately 2 1/2
hours. In return for the use of the apartment, Carter and
Johns had [paid] . . . one-eighth of an ounce of the cocaine.
Carter and Johns were charged with conspiracy to com-
mit controlled substance crime in the first degree and aiding
and abetting in a controlled substance crime in the first de-
gree, in violation of Minn.Stat. § 152.021, subd. 1(1), subd.
3(a) (1996); § 609.05.They moved to suppress all evidence
obtained from the apartment. . . .
. . . [I]n order to claim the protection of the Fourth Amend-
ment, a defendant must demonstrate that he personally has
an expectation of privacy in the place searched, and that his
expectation is reasonable; i.e., one which has “a source out-
side of the Fourth Amendment, either by reference to con-
cepts of real or personal property law or to understandings
that are recognized and permitted by society.”Id., at 143-144.
The Fourth Amendment . . . protects persons against un-
reasonable searches of“their persons [and] houses”and thus
indicates that the Fourth Amendment is a personal right that
must be invoked by an individual. See Katz v. United States,
389 U.S.347, 351 (1967) (“[T]he Fourth Amendment protects
people, not places”). But the extent to which the Fourth
Amendment protects people may depend upon where those
people are. We have held that “capacity to claim the protec-
tion of the Fourth Amendment depends . . .upon whether the
person who claims the protection of the Amendment has a le-
gitimate expectation of privacy in the invaded place.” Rakas.
The text of the Amendment suggests that its protections
extend only to people in “their” houses. But we have held
that in some circumstances a person may have a legitimate
expectation of privacy in the house of someone else. In Min-
nesota v. Olson, for example, we decided that an overnight
guest in a house had the sort of expectation of privacy that
the Fourth Amendment protects. We said . . .
“From the overnight guest’s perspective, he seeks shelter
in another’s home precisely because it provides him with
privacy, a place where he and his possessions will not be
disturbed by anyone but his host and those his host allows
inside.We are at our most vulnerable when we are asleep
because we cannot monitor our own safety or the secu-
rity of our belongings.It is for this reason that, although we
may spend all day in public places, when we cannot sleep
in our own home we seek out another private place to
sleep, whether it be a hotel room, or the home of a friend.”
In Jones v. United States, 362 U.S. 257 (1960), the de-
fendant seeking to exclude evidence resulting from a search
of an apartment had been given the use of the apartment by
a friend. He had clothing in the apartment, had slept there
“maybe a night,” and at the time was the sole occupant of
the apartment. But while the holding of Jones—that a
search of the apartment violated the defendant’s Fourth
Amendment rights—is still valid, its statement that “anyone
legitimately on the premises where a search occurs may
challenge its legality,” was expressly repudiated in Rakas.
Thus an overnight guest in a home may claim the protection
of the Fourth Amendment, but one who is merely present
with the consent of the householder may not.
Respondents here were obviously not overnight guests,
but were essentially present for a business transaction and
were only in the home a matter of hours. . . . Nor was there
anything similar to the overnight guest relationship in Olson
to suggest a degree of acceptance into the household.While
the apartment was a dwelling place for [the lessee] . . . , it
was for these respondents simply a place to do business. . . .
Property used for commercial purposes is treated differ-
ently for Fourth Amendment purposes than residential
property. . . . and while it was a “home” in which respon-
dents were present, it was not their home. Similarly, the
Court has held that in some circumstances a worker can
claim Fourth Amendment protection over his own work-
place. But there is no indication that respondents in this
case had nearly as significant a connection to [the] . . .
apartment as the worker in O’Connor had to his own private
office. If we regard the overnight guest in Minnesota v. Ol-
son as typifying those who may claim the protection of the
Fourth Amendment in the home of another, and one merely
“legitimately on the premises” as typifying those who may
not do so, the present case is obviously somewhere in be-
tween. But the purely commercial nature of the transaction
engaged in here, the relatively short period of time on the
premises, and the lack of any previous connection between
respondents and the householder, all lead us to conclude
that respondents’ situation is closer to that of one simply
permitted on the premises. We therefore hold that any
search which may have occurred did not violate their Fourth
Amendment rights.
Because we conclude that respondents had no legiti-
mate expectation of privacy in the apartment, we need not
decide whether the police officer’s observation constituted a
“search.” The judgment of the Supreme Court of Minnesota
is accordingly reversed, and the cause is remanded for pro-
ceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
Justice SCALIA, with whom Justice THOMAS joins,
concurring. . . .
. . . I am sure that the answer [here] is not remotely con-
tained in the Constitution, which means that it is left—as
many, indeed most, important questions are left—to the judg-
ment of state and federal legislators.We go beyond our proper
role as judges in a democratic society when we restrict the
people’s power to govern themselves over the full range of
policy choices that the Constitution has left available to them.
Justice KENNEDY, concurring.
I join the Court’s opinion, for its reasoning is consistent
with my view that almost all social guests have a legitimate
expectation of privacy, and hence protection against unrea-
sonable searches, in their host’s home. . . .

CHAPTER 9
ANALYSIS PROBLEM
9–2.
Do you think it would have made any difference to the majority opinion
in Carter if Carter had eaten and taken a short nap at the apartment? Explain.
. . . Officer Thielen . . . stood at a place used by the pub-
lic and from which one could see through the window into
the kitchen. The precautions that the apartment’s dwellers
took to maintain their privacy would have failed in respect to
an ordinary passerby standing in that place. Given this
Court’s well-established case law, I cannot say that the offi-
cer engaged in what the Constitution forbids, namely, an
“unreasonable search.”. . .
Justice GINSBURG, with whom Justice STEVENS and
Justice SOUTER join, dissenting.
The Court’s decision undermines not only the security of
short-term guests, but also the security of the home resident
herself. In my view, when a homeowner . . . invites a guest
into her home to share in a common endeavor, whether it be
for conversation, to engage in leisure activities, or for busi-
ness purposes licit or illicit, that guest should share his host’s
shelter against unreasonable searches and seizures. . . .
My concern centers on an individual’s choice to share
her home and her associations there with persons she se-
lects. Our decisions indicate that people have a reasonable
expectation of privacy in their homes in part because they
have the prerogative to exclude others. The power to ex-
clude implies the power to include. Our Fourth Amendment
decisions should reflect these complementary prerogatives.
A homedweller places her own privacy at risk, the Court’s
approach indicates, when she opens her home to others,
uncertain whether the duration of their stay, their purpose,
and their “acceptance into the household” will earn protec-
tion. It remains textbook law that “[s]earches and seizures
inside a home without a warrant are presumptively unrea-
sonable absent exigent circumstances.” Karo, 468 U.S., at
714-715, 104 S.Ct. 3296. The law in practice is less secure.
Human frailty suggests that today’s decision will tempt po-
lice to pry into private dwellings without warrant, to find evi-
dence incriminating guests who do not rest there through
the night.Rakas tolerates that temptation with respect to au-
tomobile searches.
I see no impelling reason to extend this risk into the
home. . . .
. . .
Our leading decision in Katz is key to my view of this
case. . . . Our obligation to produce coherent results in this
often visited area of the law requires us to inform our cur-
rent expositions by benchmarks already established. As
Justice Harlan explained in his dissent in Poe v. Ullman, 367
U.S. 497:
Each new claim to Constitutional protection must be con-
sidered against a background of Constitutional purposes,
as they have been rationally perceived and historically
developed. Though we exercise limited and sharply re-
strained judgment, yet there is no “mechanical yardstick,”
no “mechanical answer.” The decision of an apparently
novel claim must depend on grounds which follow closely
on well-accepted principles and criteria. The new deci-
sion must take “its place in relation to what went before
and further [cut] a channel for what is to come.”
The Court’s decision in this case veers sharply from the
path marked in Katz. I do not agree that we have a more rea-
sonable expectation of privacy when we place a business
call to a person’s home from a public telephone booth on the
side of the street than when we actually enter that person’s
premises to engage in a common endeavor.
For the reasons stated, I dissent from the Court’s judg-
ment, and would retain judicial surveillance over the war-
rantless searches today’s decision allows.
Aline of cases related to both the expectation of privacy and standing to challenge
a search is based on the idea that there is no legitimate interest in privacy where the
only privacy concern is to protect contraband. In this line of cases, the Supreme Court
has found that the Fourth Amendment does not apply to the search of containers, par-
ticularly when police are virtually “certain” that the search can only lead to contra-
band and will not invade any other legitimate interest in privacy [U.S. v. Place (1983)
(dog sniff of luggage) and U.S. v. Jacobsen (1984) (narcotic drug field test)]. The Court’s
reliance on this somewhat controversial line of cases was renewed in Illinois v. Caballes
(2005). In Caballes, a narcotics detection dog was walked around Caballes’ car during
a routine stop for a minor speeding violation. Because of the dog’s indication of the
presence of contraband in the vehicle’s trunk, the trunk was opened and marijuana
was found. Caballes was convicted and sentenced to 12 years in prison. Caballes chal-

Search and Seizure
■317
lenged the search. Citing Jacobsen and Place, the Court said that a person has no legit-
imate expectation of privacy in contraband, and since the dog detected only contra-
band, no legitimate expectation of privacy was threatened. The dissent argued that
narcotics dogs can make errors that could lead to the disclosure of legitimately pri-
vate interests and, therefore, police should have a reasonable and articulable suspi-
cion of illegal activity apart from a simple traffic violation before a dog can be used.
Justice Ginsberg complained that the decision opened the door to using dogs to ran-
domly sniff parked cars as well as pedestrians. It was also argued by the dissenters
that use of the dog was analogous to use of the thermal device in Kylo.
III.
WARRANT REQUIREMENTS
A.
ISSUANCE: PROBABLE CAUSE, NEUTRALITY,
PARTICULARITY
Once you determine that the Fourth Amendment applies and that a warrant is
needed, certain requirements must be met to issue a legal warrant.
1.
Probable Cause
“[N]o warrant shall issue, but upon probable cause.”
Probable cause is an abstract Fourth Amendment standard defined as the quantum
of reliable facts (evidence) under the particular circumstances that justifies a reason-
able and cautious person to believe that which is stated in the warrant. Probable cause
means “more than a bare suspicion” and “less than evidence that would justify . . .
conviction” [Brinegar v. U.S. (1949)].4 Generally, the amount of evidence required by
probable cause is quite uniform, but it can be greater if the invasion of privacy is
greater, as in the case of justifying a search by surgery [Winston v. Lee (1985)].
In any hearing to determine whether a warrant is invalid for lack of probable
cause, courts should “not invalidate the warrant by interpreting the affidavit [the
facts in support of probable cause] in a hypertechnical, rather than a commonsense,
manner” [U.S. v. Ventresca (1965)]. Police testimony that they had additional evidence
not stated in the supporting affidavit, however, is irrelevant [Whiteley v. Warden
(1971)]. If evidence included in the affidavit was knowingly or recklessly false, the re-
viewing court must test the adequacy of the affidavit without the false information
[Franks v. Delaware (1978)]. Such a hearing is called a Franks Hearing. The fact that the
affiant had given the police some false information did not undermine the credibility
of the affidavit, because it was based on the affiant’s overriding corroboration of key
facts [U.S. v. Burston (11th Cir. 1998)].
Although the level of evidence needed to support a finding that probable cause
exists is generally uniform whether the warrant is for a search or an arrest, the con-
clusions that must be supported by that evidence are quite different. The evidence in
support of a search warrant must lead to the conclusion that probable cause exists to
believe: “(1) that the items sought are connected with criminal activity; and (2) that
the items will be found in the place to be searched,” whereas in the case of arrest it is
probable cause to believe: “(1) that an offense has been committed; and (2) that the
person to be arrested committed it.”5
The type of evidence that can be included in an affidavit to support a finding of
probable cause does not have to meet technical evidentiary standards. It can, for ex-
ample, include hearsay [Draper v. U.S. (1959)] or a prior police record [Brinegar v. U.S.
(1949)]. Information from informants may be used. The degree of reliability of such
information, however, has caused considerable litigation. In Aguilar v. Texas (1964) the
Supreme Court established a two-prong test to guide magistrates in determining
whether probable cause exists when an informant is involved:
probable cause:
the quantum of reliable facts
under the circumstances
that justifies a reasonable
person to believe that which
is stated in a warrant, “more
than a bare suspicion” and
“less than evidence that
would justify . . . conviction.”

CHAPTER 9
1.
Sufficient underlying circumstances must be alleged to permit a neutral
and detached magistrate to determine that the informant is credible
(veracity prong).
2.
Sufficient underlying circumstances must be shown to permit a neutral
and detached magistrate to determine the basis for the informant’s
conclusions (basis of knowledge prong).
With this test in mind, the Aguilar Court struck down a warrant based on an affi-
davit that stated the police received reliable information from a credible informant
that narcotics would be found at a specific location. The Court’s decision emphasizes
that the magistrate should weigh the evidence to determine probable cause, and not
base the decision on police conclusions.
In Spinelli v. U.S. (1969) the Court determined that probable cause could be met
even if the basis of the knowledge prong was not adequately alleged. The Court said
the basis of the knowledge prong could still be met if the tip is “in sufficient detail that
the magistrate may know that he is relying on something more substantial than a ca-
sual rumor . . . or an accusation based merely on an individual’s general reputation.”
The Court used the example of an informant who had previously given reliable in-
formation but did not say how the information had been obtained. Instead, the in-
formant gave a detailed description of the person in question, where the person
would be arriving by train, what he would be wearing, even that he would be walk-
ing fast and that he was peddling narcotics. The detail made up for the lack of knowl-
edge about how the information was arrived at.
The Aguilar-Spinelli tests guided lower courts until 1983 when a more conservative
Supreme Court decided Illinois v. Gates (1983). Gates gave the signal that the Court was
removing the two-prong analysis from center stage and applying a less rigorous analy-
sis of a “totality of the circumstances.” Police received an anonymous letter detailing the
upcoming travel plans of Gates and his wife and stating that the purpose of this activ-
ity was to ferry illegal drugs. Neither the veracity of the informant nor the underlying
basis for his conclusions was provided. Based on the tip, however, the police observed
Gates and his wife conforming in considerable measure with the activity described in
the informant’s letter, activity that the Court said is “as suggestive of a prearranged
drug run, as it is of an ordinary vacation trip.”After the suspects returned home, the po-
lice obtained a warrant for the search of their home and did find illegal drugs. In de-
ciding whether probable cause existed, the Court said that the “veracity” and “basis of
knowledge” prongs were useful to consider but were not tests that needed to be defin-
itively met in a hypertechnical manner in every case; rather, the “totality of circum-
stances” should guide the Court in determining probable cause. It is worth noting that
in relaxing the standard to an as of yet uncertain degree the Court did confirm Aguilar
in that there must be adequate information for the magistrate to determine probable
cause, not a mere ratification of either police or informant conclusions. The Gates stan-
dard is to be given broad interpretation by the states [Massachusetts v. Upton (1984)].
Some state courts in interpreting their respective constitutions have adopted the
Gates standard, others retain the Aguilar-Spinelli tests, and still others have developed
unique hybrid standards more protective than the Gates standard. Be sure to research
applicable search and seizure standards in your state.
The courts have not required a showing of veracity from police or citizens who
are not a part of the seamy world of criminal informants. The cases do, however, re-
quire a showing of the basis of knowledge.6
Whether information in the supporting affidavit is stale also can be a factor in de-
termining probable cause to believe that the items to be seized are at the specified lo-
cation. The general rule is that staleness “must be determined by the circumstances of
each case”[Sgro v. U.S. (1932)]. In Sgro, the search of a hotel pursuant to a warrant was
held invalid because it was based on the affiant’s allegation that he had purchased il-
legal beer there three weeks earlier. If, however, the information pertains to an ongoing
illegal enterprise rather than an isolated offense, its staleness is less likely to invalidate
the warrant [U.S. v. Spikes (6th Cir. 1998)]. The nature of the property to be seized also

can be important. For example, three-month-old information that a bank robbery sus-
pect might have the bank’s money bag at his residence was held to provide probable
cause [U.S. v. Steeves (8th Cir. 1975)]. Sixteen-year-old evidence was found not too stale
for issuance of a warrant in a sexual abuse case. Two men alleging sexual abuse by a
priest said that as children they remembered that pornography was kept by the priest
in a locker used as a coffee table [Behrel v. State (Md. App. 2003)]. The court said it was
the nature of the evidence and not the passage of time that controlled the case.
A growing body of court decisions upholds anticipatory search warrants. These
warrants anticipate probable cause being present on the basis of a predictable event,
such as the expected delivery of illegal drugs or other contraband to a specific location.
Thus, police can be ready but, generally, may not execute the warrant until the event oc-
curs, creating the necessary probable cause [U.S. v. Tagbering (8th Cir. 1993) and U.S. v.
Dornhofer (4th Cir. 1988)]. An anticipatory search warrant issued under the condition
that it could not be executed by police until arrival of the expected contraband did not
need that condition to be written into the warrant when such a requirement was “logi-
cally implicit” and had been stated orally by the judge [U.S. v. Leidner (7th Cir. 1996)].
Because of numerous appeals on the adequacy of probable cause for warrants
and warrantless searches and arrests, the Supreme Court addressed the standards for
appellate courts reviewing the issue. In Ornelus v. U.S. (1996), the Court ruled that ap-
pellate courts should review the case de novo, meaning it should look at both the fac-
tual and legal basis for probable cause in the same manner that the trial court should.
This would ensure more uniformity and certainty in probable cause or reasonable
suspicion determinations.
Police apply for the search warrant by filling out an application for a search war-
rant and attaching an affidavit in support of the application. The affidavit must pro-
vide sufficient underlying evidence to demonstrate that probable cause exists for the
search or arrest. The application and affidavit are normally in writing but may be
made by telephone or electrical recording.
2.
Neutrality
Only a neutral and detached public official, normally a judge or magistrate, can re-
view the application for a warrant, determine from the affidavit if probable cause ex-
ists, and issue the search warrant. Judicial neutrality is essential to check the power
of the police and the government, and to ensure that privacy may be invaded only
when the government conforms to constitutional standards. The role of the judge,
therefore, is to see to it that those constitutional standards are enforced and that the
process does not deteriorate into a rubber stamp formality. For this reason an official
associated with law enforcement, such as an attorney general or one who otherwise
is not neutral and detached, may not issue a search warrant.
3.
Particularity
Avalid search warrant, according to the Fourth Amendment, must describe with par-
ticularity the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized. This rule em-
bodies our founders’ extreme distaste for general warrants that can be readily abused.
By requiring particularity, reasonable limits are placed on what the police can seize
and on how broad the search can be.
In drafting a warrant, provide sufficient detail so the officers can identify the
place to be searched [Steele v. U.S. (1925)]. For urban areas that means a street number
and possibly a specific apartment or other equally discernable criteria; for rural areas
a more general but yet discriminating description is acceptable. If a vehicle is to be
searched, identify one specific vehicle by license number or other clear criteria. A per-
son to be seized must be identified by name, if possible, or a complete physical de-
scription. An arrest warrant describing a defendant only by DNA was issued by a
California court as sufficiently particularized for probable cause [People v. Paul E.
Robinson (Ca. Sup. Ct. 2001)].7 Minor errors in any of these descriptions will generally
not affect the warrant’s validity.

of fact and the questions of
law in an appellate case.

■
CHAPTER 9
Leave nothing to the discretion of the officers in describing “things” to be seized.
In Marron v. U.S. (1927) a warrant listing intoxicating liquors and articles for their
manufacture did not authorize the seizure of financial records at the same location. A
somewhat generic description such as “cases of whiskey” may be adequate particu-
larity for seizure under prohibition or in areas today where sale of such beverages is
illegal [Steele v. U.S. (1925)]; more precision in description is usually needed, however.
When First Amendment issues are involved, such as searches for papers, books, or
films, it is necessary to single out the particular book or books, and all copies or the
only copy should not be seized, especially if that will interfere with public display or
sale [Andresen v. Maryland (1976), Stanford v. Texas (1965), Zurcher v. Stanford Daily
(1978), and Heller v. New York (1973)].
Computer searches involve special problems. Police might be able to specify and
seize a particular item or document in concrete form, but it may be harder to locate
and “seize” a document or data stored in a computer memory bank. Whereas a war-
rant directing seizure of “all records” may be too broad for traditional seizures, a war-
rant directing seizure of a computer and its hard drive (“all data”) may be permissible
because of the nature of computers [U.S. v. Hunter (D. Vt. 1998)]. Searching and Seizing
Computers and Obtaining Electronic Evidence in Criminal Investigations, published by the
Department of Justice, is helpful in computer search questions (www.usdoj.
gov/criminal/cybercrime/searching.html#A).
Exhibit 9–1 is an example of an application and affidavit for a search warrant, and
Exhibit 9–2 is an example of a search warrant and inventory.
B.
EXECUTION OF THE WARRANT
1.
Who and When
Federal and similar state rules and statutes require that warrants be executed by a po-
lice officer. The search can be rendered unreasonable regarding the expectation of pri-
vacy if the police are accompanied by persons who do not have a legitimate reason to
be present to assist them. A police search of a house subject to a warrant was an un-
reasonable invasion of the expectation of privacy when the police were accompanied
by a newspaper reporter and photographer [Wilson v. Layne (1999)].
A search warrant must be executed within the times specified in the warrant or
in the rule or law. The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 41(c)(1) specify ten days.
Federal and most state laws require daytime service, normally 6:00 A.M. to 10:00 P.M.
[Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(c)(1)], and permit nighttime service only in justified circum-
stances. State laws may vary.
Under the reasonableness clause of the FourthAmendment, police executing a war-
rant at a dwelling are to knock on the door, identify themselves, state that they are there
to execute a warrant, and wait a reasonable period of time before breaking in [Wilson v.
Arkansas (1995)]. How long police must wait after announcing their presence is a mat-
ter of what is reasonable under the circumstances.Afifteen- to twenty-second delay fol-
lowing the required knock and announce was reasonable under the circumstances in
U.S. v. Banks (2003). The Court said that it was reasonable for the police to suspect that
the evidence was being destroyed, because there was no response to the knock, the ev-
idence sought was cocaine, and people were likely to be up and around who could
quickly destroy the drugs. Use of subterfuge to enter is not permitted.8
No-knock or unannounced entries are permitted in justified circumstances, for
example, when there is substantial risk that notice (knocking) will lead to destruction
of evidence [Ker v. California (1963)] or resistance, will be likely to permit escape, will
significantly increase the danger to officers, or when it becomes a useless gesture. The
last applies to situations where the subjects of the search or seizure are already aware
of the presence of the police. Police must have a “reasonable suspicion” that one or
more of these circumstances exist before they can enter without knocking. A few ju-
risdictions, including New York, have enacted “no-knock” laws embodying some of
these exceptions. Does your state have such a law?

2.
Detention and Search of Persons
Police may detain persons during the search. Michigan v. Summers (1981) spelled out
three governmental interests or justifications for doing so: (1) prevent flight, (2) re-
duce risk of harm to police, and (3) facilitate orderly completion of the search. In Sum-
mers the police with a search warrant for narcotics ran into Summers, who appeared
to be leaving. The police detained him, which the Court said was justified, especially
because they had a warrant based on probable cause to believe that someone at Sum-
mers’ house had committed a crime. The Court also mentioned that the intrusion on
liberty was minimal, because it occurred in Summers’ home and no public stigma at-
tached. An interesting footnote in the case reserved judgment on the issue of whether
detention is proper when the search is for mere evidence of crime, such as a search in
a newspaper’s file for photos of a riot that might help identify looters. In this search
there is no probable cause to believe that someone at the newspaper had committed
a crime. Would the Summers case be different in outcome if Summers had been a store
owner detained openly before his customers?
Eventually, Summers was arrested because police found narcotics in the house,
then, “incident to the lawful arrest,” they searched Summers and found more drugs
in his jacket pocket. Do police executing a warrant with probable cause to search the
premises have the right to search persons present at the scene? Case law says police
may not search such persons, with three exceptions: (1) the search may be made if
there is separate probable cause to believe the person is in possession of contraband
and there is not a reasonable amount of time for the police to obtain another warrant,
although such a search cannot be based on a mere suspicion of possession [Ybarra v.
Illinois (1979)]; (2) if there is a lawful arrest, a search may be conducted “incident to
the lawful arrest,” as occurred in Summers [Marron v. U.S. (1927)]; and (3) the search
is legal if there is some basis for a belief that the person is armed, but then the search
must be limited to a pat-down search [Terry v. Ohio (1968)].
Also, it was legal for police to detain a person for two hours to procure a search
warrant for the person’s residence when consent for the search had been refused,
probable cause existed to believe marijuana was in the residence, destruction of the
drugs was likely without the detention, law enforcement needs were balanced with
respect for personal privacy, and the restraint was for a limited duration [Illinois v.
McArthur (2001)]. In Muehler v. Mena (2005) the Court relied on Summers to rule the
handcuffing of persons present during a warranted search for firearms was not a vi-
olation of the Fourth Amendment.
3.
Seizure of Items Other Than Those Named in the Warrant
Items beyond those named in the warrant may be seized when the police inadvertently
see contraband or evidence of a crime in “plain view” while executing the warrant
[Coolidge v. New Hampshire (1971)]. Asking the police to wait to get a warrant or to ignore
such evidence is ludicrous. Police have abused the “plain view” exception, however, to
unlawfully broaden a search. Police, for example, may not open a cookie jar when the
warrant calls for the search for a wide-screen television, or they may not pick up an item
and look on the bottom for a serial number even if a reasonable suspicion exists that the
item is contraband or evidence of a crime [Arizona v. Hicks (1987)]. In other words, the dis-
covery must be a plain view discovery, and there must be probable cause to believe the
item is the fruit of a crime, or an instrumentality or evidence of a crime. The concept of
plain view is discussed more thoroughly in the next section of this chapter.

Search and Seizure
■325
4.
Required Inventory
Police are required to report what they seize when executing a search warrant. This
report is normally made on an inventory sheet that is attached to the return of the
search warrant, which is a document or a part of the warrant that indicates that the
warrant was executed, the time and place that it was executed, and any other re-
quested information. Failure to make an inventory or to include everything that was
seized is not a constitutional breach and does not invalidate the search. See Exhibit
9–2 for a sample inventory. Although seized property must be inventoried, police do
not have to provide information on how the property can be recovered by the owner
[City of West Covina v. Perkins (1999)]. Notice to owners of seizure, however, is required
as a matter of due process. The procedure for reacquiring improperly seized items is
set out in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure, Rule 41(g) and parallel state statutes.
Contraband, however, is not returnable, even if illegally seized.
C.
WARRANT SUBSEQUENT TO SEARCH:
INDEPENDENT SOURCE
In Murray v. U.S. (1988) the Court wrestled with whether a search warrant was legal
after police had at an earlier time conducted an illegal search of the same place. The
police had probable cause to believe that marijuana was located in a building. Before
getting a warrant, they forced their way into the building and confirmed their suspi-
cions. Hours later they received a search warrant from a magistrate without men-
tioning anything about the earlier search, and relying solely on the original probable
cause they had prior to the illegal search. The Supreme Court said the warrant ob-
tained after the first search would be legal if it was based on no more than the prob-
able cause that existed for the original search. The warrant could not be based in any
way on evidence gained from the first illegal search. In other words, the subsequent
warrant must have an independent and untainted source of probable cause.
D.
OFFICER LIABILITY AND THE FOURTH AMENDMENT
Prosecutors’ offices frequently keep law enforcement personnel informed about
the legal limits of police authority and the potential for liability if legal limits are
exceeded. Paralegals may play a role in researching these developments. This ad-
visory role has become increasingly important as courts continue to whittle away
at sovereign immunity protections for law enforcement. In a recent decision, the
U.S. Supreme Court held that a federal agent who had executed a faulty warrant
could be sued under 42 U.S.C.A. § 1983 for violating the Fourth Amendment civil
rights of a resident, when the agent was fully aware that a search warrant did not
specify the items to be seized as required and a reasonable officer would have
known that executing the warrant, therefore, was an unreasonable search [Groh v.
Ramirez (2004)].
IV.
EXCEPTIONS TO THE REQUIREMENT
FOR A WARRANT
A.
INTRODUCTION
The heart of the previous section is that warrants are the preferred and constitution-
ally mandated method for the government to conduct searches and seizures where
there is a reasonable expectation of privacy on the part of a person. These warrants
must be based on a proper showing of probable cause determined by a neutral mag-
istrate. Exceptions to the warrant requirement should be rare and based on strong jus-
tification. These exceptions include the following:

B.
ARREST
An arrest is the physical or implied seizure or taking into custody of a person by po-
lice, significantly restricting a person’s freedom of movement and subjecting him or
her to the authority of the officer. The Fourth Amendment applies to all police
seizures of persons including those of short duration. Normally, a warrant for arrest
is required if the police must go into a dwelling to make the arrest [Payton v. New York
(1980)]. Absent a warrant, police must have probable cause plus exigent circum-
stances to enter a dwelling [Kirk v. Louisiana (2002)].
Apart from that and based on common law tradition, the Fourth Amendment
does not require a warrant for the arrest of persons accused of felonies. The police
must have probable cause to believe that the arrestee has committed a crime prior to
making the arrest. For example, if a bank has been robbed and a police officer is in-
formed that a person well known to the officer committed the robbery, it would be
ridiculous to require a warrant to arrest the suspect if they came face to face with each
other at the street corner five minutes after the bank robbery. It would be just as
ridiculous, however, to permit the arrest of every person in the neighborhood if the
only information police had about the robber was that the robber was wearing a light
colored shirt and jeans. Any arrest without probable cause is illegal, results in the re-
lease of the suspect, and may lead to the suppression of any evidence seized as a re-
sult of the arrest. Such evidence would be “fruit of the poisonous tree” (results of an
illegal arrest), the doctrine set out in Wong Sun v. U.S. (1963). Therefore, a determina-
tion of when an arrest has occurred has been a frequent subject of litigation.
The Supreme Court of the United States has attempted to define “arrest” in a se-
ries of cases and, thus, to establish when probable cause is necessary. There is little
question that the taking of a person into a police car or into a police station is an ar-
rest [Davis v. Mississippi (1969) and Dunaway v. New York (1979)]. An arrest can occur,
as well, in a bedroom where police prevent a person from leaving and where the po-
lice consider the person to be “under arrest” [Orozco v. Texas (1969)]. A high-speed
chase or other pursuit by police is not an arrest [County of Sacramento v. Lewis (1998)
and California v. Hodari D. (1991)]. Less intrusive seizures, which are discussed under
the “stop and frisk” exception, are not arrests and, therefore, require the lesser stan-
dard of “reasonable suspicion” that criminal activity is afoot. Stopping a car can be
such a limited seizure or it can be a full arrest, depending on the circumstances. Aper-
son is “seized” for Fourth Amendment purposes when, under the circumstances, a
reasonable person would have believed he or she was not free to leave [Michigan v.
Chesternut (1988) and U.S. v. Mendenhall (1980)]. In Kaupp v. Texas (2003), six police of-
ficers, after failing to get a warrant for lack of probable cause, took a seventeen-year-
old suspect from his bed at 3 A.M. (handcuffed, shoeless, and in his underwear) to the
scene of the crime and then to sheriff’s headquarters. Though he went willingly, he
was not advised that he could refuse to go, and the conduct of the police, including
saying, “We need to go talk,” would have convinced a reasonable person that he was
not free to refuse. Therefore, this was an illegal arrest.

Search and Seizure
■327
If an arrest occurs, it may be challenged for lacking probable cause. In Maryland
v. Pringle (2003), the Court addressed Pringle’s contention that his arrest lacked suffi-
cient individualized suspicion for police to have probable cause to believe that he
committed the crime.
MARYLAND v. PRINGLE
Supreme Court of the United States
540 U.S. 366, 124 S. Ct. 795 (2003)
[citations omitted]
Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the Court.
. . .
At 3:16 a.m. on August 7, 1999, a Baltimore County Po-
lice officer stopped a Nissan Maxima for speeding. There
were three occupants in the car: Donte Partlow, the driver
and owner, respondent Pringle, the front-seat passenger,
and Otis Smith, the back-seat passenger. The officer asked
Partlow for his license and registration. When Partlow
opened the glove compartment to retrieve the vehicle regis-
tration, the officer observed a large amount of rolled-up
money in the glove compartment. . . .
After a second patrol car arrived, the officer asked Part-
low if he had any weapons or narcotics in the vehicle. Part-
low indicated that he did not. Partlow then consented to a
search of the vehicle. The search yielded $763 from the
glove compartment and five plastic glassine baggies con-
taining cocaine from behind the back-seat armrest. . . .
. . .The men offered no information regarding the owner-
ship of the drugs or money. All three were placed under ar-
rest and transported to the police station.
Later that morning, Pringle waived his rights . . . and gave
an oral and written confession in which he acknowledged that
the cocaine belonged to him, that he and his friends were go-
ing to a party, and that he intended to sell the cocaine or“[u]se
it for sex.” Pringle maintained that the other occupants of the
car did not know about the drugs, and they were released.
The trial court denied Pringle’s motion to suppress his
confession as the fruit of an illegal arrest, holding that the of-
ficer had probable cause to arrest Pringle. A jury convicted
Pringle of possession with intent to distribute cocaine and
possession of cocaine. He was sentenced to 10 years’ in-
carceration without the possibility of parole. The Court of
Special Appeals of Maryland affirmed.
The Court of Appeals of Maryland, by divided vote, re-
versed, holding that, absent specific facts tending to show
Pringle’s knowledge and dominion or control over the drugs,
“the mere finding of cocaine in the back armrest when
[Pringle] was a front seat passenger in a car being driven by
its owner is insufficient to establish probable cause for an ar-
rest for possession.” We granted certiorari.
. . .
. . . Maryland law authorizes police officers to execute
warrantless arrests, inter alia, for felonies committed in an
officer’s presence or where an officer has probable cause to
believe that a felony has been committed or is being com-
mitted in the officer’s presence.
. . .
It is uncontested in the present case that the officer,
upon recovering the five plastic glassine baggies contain-
ing suspected cocaine, had probable cause to believe a
felony had been committed. The sole question is whether
the officer had probable cause to believe that Pringle com-
mitted that crime.
. . .
The probable-cause standard is incapable of precise def-
inition or quantification into percentages because it deals
with probabilities and depends on the totality of the circum-
stances. . . . We have stated, however, that “[t]he substance
of all the definitions of probable cause is a reasonable
ground for belief of guilt,” . . . and that the belief of guilt must
be particularized with respect to the person to be searched
or seized, Ybarra v. Illinois, 444 U.S. 85, 91 (1979).
. . .
We think it an entirely reasonable inference from these
facts that any or all three of the occupants had knowledge
of, and exercised dominion and control over, the cocaine.
Thus a reasonable officer could conclude that there was
probable cause to believe Pringle committed the crime of
possession of cocaine, either solely or jointly.
Pringle’s attempt to characterize this case as a guilt-by-
association case is unavailing.
. . .
We hold that the officer had probable cause to believe
that Pringle had committed the crime of possession of a
controlled substance. Pringle’s arrest therefore did not con-
travene the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. Accord-
ingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals of Maryland is
reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings
not inconsistent with this opinion.

■
CHAPTER 9
In Davenpeck v. Alford (2005) the justices ruled that when police base an arrest on
a mistaken belief that a crime was committed but where unrelated grounds exist for
the arrest, the otherwise invalid arrest is validated by the sufficient alternative prob-
able cause. During a traffic stop, officers told Davenpeck that he was being arrested
for tape recording a conversation between him and the officers (which later proved
not to be a crime). They did not tell him their alternative reason, which was that Dav-
enpeck appeared to be impersonating an officer. A lower court ruling that the alter-
native basis was not sufficiently related to the primary grounds for arrest to save the
arrest was overturned.
Although police do not need a warrant to make an arrest for a felony, most states
require a warrant for misdemeanor arrests. A warrant is not necessary if the misde-
meanor is committed in the presence of the officer or, in some states, where the offi-
cer has reasonable grounds to believe a crime has been committed. In Atwater v. Lago
Vista (2001), a civil rights suit for an alleged Fourth Amendment violation, the U.S.
Supreme Court held that a custodial (jail) arrest was permissible, even for a fine-only
seat belt violation. Check the law of your state for essential details concerning the
need for a warrant for arrest.
The Supreme Court in U.S. v. Watson (1976) had the opportunity to change com-
mon law and require a warrant for arrest in all cases except where exigent circum-
stances exist, but it declined to do so. In 1975, however, it did reiterate the principle
that, even though a warrant for arrest may not be necessary, authorities must bring an
individual before a judge or magistrate within a reasonable length of time to deter-
mine if probable cause exists for their detention [Gerstein v. Pugh (1975)]. In 1991 the
Court declared that this period may be as long as forty-eight hours, but anything
longer, even if it is a holiday weekend, is presumptively improper [County of Riverside
v. McLaughlin (1991)].
Even though an arrest based on probable cause may not require a warrant, an ar-
rest can become unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment when the means used
by the officer to secure the arrest are unreasonable. The use of deadly force to secure
the arrest of a felon is unreasonable unless the officer is threatened with a weapon, or
probable cause exists to believe the suspect has threatened or committed serious
physical harm to another [Tennessee v. Garner (1985)]. In Brosseau v. Haugen (2004), the
Court ruled on a case involving the shooting of a suspect, who was trying to escape
in a vehicle. The officer who shot him believed the driver could use the vehicle against
fellow officers who were on foot. The Court held that the officer had qualified im-
munity, because the conduct fell into that “hazy border between excessive and ac-
ceptable” use of force. The United States may even invade the territory of a sovereign
nation to kidnap one of its citizens based on probable cause. The Supreme Court ruled
that such a seizure is a valid arrest in U.S. v. Alvarez-Machain (1992).
In Whren v. U.S. (1996) the court addressed whether an arrest is rendered unrea-
sonable under the Fourth Amendment because officers have a pretext (ulterior mo-
tive) or depart from usual police procedure or regulation.
WHREN v. UNITED STATES
Supreme Court of the United States
517 U.S. 806, 116 S.Ct. 1769 (1996).
JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion
of the Court. . . .
On the evening of June 10, 1993, plainclothes vice-squad
officers of the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police De-
partment were patrolling a “high drug area” of the city in an
unmarked car. Their suspicions were aroused when they
passed a dark Pathfinder truck with temporary license plates
and youthful occupants waiting at a stop sign, the driver look-

ing down into the lap of the passenger at his right. The truck
remained stopped at the intersection for what seemed an un-
usually long time—more than twenty seconds.When the po-
lice car executed a U-turn in order to head back toward the
truck, the Pathfinder turned suddenly to its right, without sig-
nalling, and sped off at an “unreasonable” speed. The po-
licemen followed, and in a short while overtook the
Pathfinder when it stopped behind other traffic at a red light.
They pulled up alongside, and Officer Ephraim Soto stepped
out and approached the driver’s door, identifying himself as
a police officer and directing the driver, petitioner Brown, to
put the vehicle in park. When Soto drew up to the driver’s
window, he immediately observed two large plastic bags of
what appeared to be crack cocaine in petitioner Whren’s
hands. Petitioners were arrested, and quantities of several
types of illegal drugs were retrieved from the vehicle.
Petitioners were charged . . . with violating various fed-
eral drug laws. At a pretrial suppression hearing, they chal-
lenged the legality of the stop and the resulting seizure of
the drugs. They argued that the stop had not been justified
by probable cause to believe, or even reasonable suspicion,
that petitioners were engaged in illegal drug-dealing activ-
ity; and that Officer Soto’s asserted ground for approaching
the vehicle—to give the driver a warning concerning traffic
violations—was pretextual. The District Court denied the
suppression motion. . . .
Petitioners were convicted. . . . The Court of Appeals af-
firmed the convictions, holding with respect to the suppres-
sion issue that, “regardless of whether a police officer
subjectively believes that the occupants of an automobile
may be engaging in some other illegal behavior, a traffic
stop is permissible as long as a reasonable officer in the
same circumstances could have stopped the car for the sus-
pected traffic violation.”
The Fourth Amendment guarantees “[t]he right of the peo-
ple to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects,
against unreasonable searches and seizures.” Temporary
detention of individuals during the stop of an automobile by
the police, even if only for a brief period and for a limited pur-
pose, constitutes a “seizure” of “persons” within the meaning
of this provision. An automobile stop is thus subject to the
constitutional imperative that it not be “unreasonable” under
the circumstances. As a general matter, the decision to stop
an automobile is reasonable where the police have probable
cause to believe that a traffic violation has occurred.
Petitioners . . .contend, the use of automobiles is so heav-
ily and minutely regulated that total compliance with traffic
and safety rules is nearly impossible, a police officer will al-
most invariably be able to catch any given motorist in a tech-
nical violation.This creates the temptation to use traffic stops
as a means of investigating other law violations, as to which
no probable cause or even articulable suspicion exists. Peti-
tioners, who are both black, further contend that police offi-
cers might decide which motorists to stop based on decidedly
impermissible factors, such as the race of the car’s occu-
pants.To avoid this danger, they say, the Fourth Amendment
test for traffic stops should be, not the normal one (applied by
the Court of Appeals) of whether probable cause existed to
justify the stop; but rather, whether a police officer, acting rea-
sonably, would have made the stop for the reason given.
Petitioners contend that the standard they propose is
consistent with our past cases’ disapproval of police at-
tempts to use valid bases of action against citizens as pre-
texts for pursuing other investigatory agendas. . . .
. . . Subjective intentions, [however] play no role in ordi-
nary, probable-cause Fourth Amendment analysis.
Recognizing that we have been unwilling to entertain
Fourth Amendment challenges based on the actual motiva-
tions of individual officers, petitioners disavow any intention
to make the individual officer’s subjective good faith the
touchstone of “reasonableness.” They insist that the stan-
dard they have put forward—whether the officer’s conduct
deviated materially from usual police practices, so that a rea-
sonable officer in the same circumstances would not have
made the stop for the reasons given—is an “objective” one.
But although framed in empirical terms, this approach is
plainly and indisputably driven by subjective considera-
tions. . . . Petitioners’ proposed standard may not use the
word “pretext,” but it is designed to combat nothing other
than the perceived “danger” of the pretextual stop.
. . .
[P]olice enforcement practices, even if they could be
practicably assessed by a judge, vary from place to place
and from time to time.We cannot accept that the search and
seizure protections of the Fourth Amendment are so vari-
able, and can be made to turn upon such trivialities.
. . .
In what would appear to be an elaboration on the “rea-
sonable officer” test, petitioners argue that the balancing in-
herent in any Fourth Amendment inquiry requires us to
weigh the governmental and individual interests implicated
in a traffic stop such as we have here. That balancing, peti-
tioners claim, does not support investigation of minor traffic
infractions by plainclothes police in unmarked vehicles. . . .
. . .
Where probable cause has existed, the only cases in which
we have found it necessary actually to perform the “balancing”
analysis involved searches or seizures conducted in an ex-
traordinary manner, unusually harmful to an individual’s pri-
vacy or even physical interests—such as, for example, seizure
by means of deadly force, see Tennessee v. Garner; unan-
nounced entry into a home, see Wilson v. Arkansas; entry into
a home without a warrant, see Welsh v.Wisconsin; or physical
penetration of the body, see Winston v. Lee. The making of a
traffic stop out-of-uniform does not remotely qualify as such an
extreme practice, and so is governed by the usual rule that
probable cause to believe the law has been broken “outbal-
ances” private interest in avoiding police contact.
. . .
For the run-of-the-mine case, which this surely is, we think
there is no realistic alternative to the traditional common-law
rule that probable cause justifies a search and seizure.

CHAPTER 9
. . .
Here the District Court found that the officers had proba-
ble cause to believe that petitioners had violated the traffic
code. That rendered the stop reasonable under the Fourth
Amendment, the evidence thereby discovered admissible,
and the upholding of the convictions by the Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia Circuit correct.
Judgment affirmed.
stop and frisk
(investigatory detention):
a brief investigatory stop
occurring when a police offi-
cer confronts a suspicious
looking person to ask a few
questions and to “pat down”
their clothing to see if they
are carrying weapons.
The reasoning of the majority opinions in Whren and Atwater was reaffirmed in
Arkansas v. Sullivan (2001). In these cases the Court relied on its interpretation of
eighteenth-century common law to conclude that, as long as the arresting officer
has probable cause to believe that a crime was committed in the officer’s presence,
no further inquiry into the reasonableness of the arrest is required except in the
most extraordinary circumstances, such as in Tennessee v. Garner (1985).
Sullivan is also instructive for its reaffirmation of the principle that a state court
may not put further restrictions on police conduct when considering federal consti-
tutional provisions if the U.S. Supreme Court has refrained from doing so. The
Arkansas Supreme Court had ruled that the pretext portion of Whren was irrelevant
and, therefore, could ignore it. The Arkansas court’s decision finding a pretextual ar-
rest unreasonable was reversed.
C.
STOP AND FRISK (INVESTIGATORY DETENTION)
A stop and frisk (investigatory detention) is a brief investigatory stop occurring
when a police officer confronts a suspicious looking person to ask a few questions and
to “pat down” their clothing to see if they are carrying weapons. The officer does not
need a warrant and, unlike an arrest and full search that requires probable cause, a
stop and frisk requires only that the officer have a reasonable, articulable, and partic-
ularized suspicion that the suspect (1) is involved in wrongdoing and (2) may be car-
rying a weapon [Terry v. Ohio (1968)]. If the pat down reveals the presence of a
weaponlike object, the officer has the right to reach into a pocket to remove the
weapon. If the object turns out to be a weapon or contraband, then the officer may
seize the weapon or criminally tainted object.
The test in stop and frisk is not the warrant and probable cause portions of the
Fourth Amendment, but its requirement of reasonableness. The balancing occurs in
trying to determine how much actual evidence (objective suspicion) is required to jus-
tify the degree of intrusion, either in the form of interfering with a citizen’s liberty or
in the form of a search of clothing, car, or other property. The reasonable suspicion
standard and the limits of Terry were stable law for a number of years. Recently, how-
ever, courts have been reevaluating the reasonableness test to justify expansion of the
Terry stop and frisk. Increasingly intrusive stops and searches over longer periods of
time based on less reliable and less objectively articulable evidence have been al-
lowed. In reading through the following list of decisions on stop and frisk, keep in
mind the major issues: first, what level of suspicion (evidence) is needed to make the
stop reasonable; second, how long the stop can be; and third, to what or whom the
stop and frisk may be applied.
Here is a sampling of cases.
■
A law authorizing police to stop vehicles that had special WZ license plates
(indicating that a driver in the household had a revoked driver’s license) vi-
olated both the Minnesota and U.S. Constitutions, because the plates did not
create the required reasonable suspicion of criminal activity [State v. Henning
(Minn. 2003)].
■
Several factors formed adequate grounds for a Terry vehicle stop in U.S. v.
Arvizu (2002). They included the driver’s use of an unpaved secondary road
near a primary border checkpoint in an area notorious for alien and nar-
cotics smuggling, his “stiff” demeanor in ignoring the passing of the officer
“The layman’s Constitutional
view is that what he likes is
Constitutional and that
which he doesn’t like is un-
constitutional. That about
measures up the Constitu-
tional acumen of the aver-
age person.”
—Hugo L. Black, New York
Times, February 26, 1971

Search and Seizure
■331
followed shortly by apparent “prompted” waving at the officer by the chil-
dren in the vehicle, and the driver choosing to make one more turn that
would avoid the checkpoint.
■
A traveler’s luggage could be seized on a reasonable suspicion, but for no
longer than a person can be reasonably detained (ninety minutes was too
long) [U.S. v. Place (1983)].
■
The moving of an air passenger from a hall to an office for questioning,
when a canine cop could have resolved the matter quietly, escalated a stop
to an arrest without probable cause [U.S. v. Sharpe (1985)].
■
Even if the person was out of a stopped car, a police officer could search the
passenger compartment for weapons if there were grounds to believe the
suspect was dangerous or that such a search was necessary to protect the of-
ficer [Michigan v. Long (1983)].
■
An informant’s somewhat reliable tip authorized the direct search of a sus-
pect’s pocket [Adams v. Williams (1972)].
■
An anonymous tip was reasonable if some details were corroborated by po-
lice before the stop [White v. Alabama (1990)].
■
An anonymous telephone tip to police, however, that one of three young
African American men (the one in plaid) was carrying a gun without addi-
tional corroboration is insufficient reasonable suspicion to stop and frisk a
suspect [Florida v. J.L. (2000)]. The Court went on to say that an anonymous
tip may be enough reasonable suspicion in the context of a school or an air-
port to justify a protective search.
■
Suspicionless confrontations by multiple police officers of individual pas-
sengers in busses at terminals, which led to questioning and consent
searches of bags and persons, were not seizures, because nothing was done
or said by police “that would suggest to a reasonable person that he or she
was barred from leaving the bus or otherwise terminating the encounter”
[U.S. v. Drayton (2002) and Florida v. Bostick (1991)].
■
The fact that two men walked away from each other in an alley in a 
drug trafficking area was inadequate grounds for a stop [Brown v.
Texas (1979)].
■
Police yelling “stop” and chasing the defendant, who ran when police ap-
proached (exercising his refusal to be questioned or searched?), was not a
seizure until the person was actually tackled. The officer’s reasons for
yelling “stop” and pursuing and tackling did not fall short of the Terry stan-
dard, even if the officer only had a hunch that criminal activity was afoot
[California v. Hodari D. (1991)].
■
Running from police and in an area known for heavy narcotics traffic justi-
fied a seizure and frisk, which revealed a gun [Illinois v. Wardlow (2000)].
Compare with Hodari D. and Brown v. Texas (above).
It is generally understood that a person may refuse to provide identification or
other information to police, and such refusal is, by itself, insufficient grounds for an
investigatory detention [Brown v. Texas (1979)]. Where the police already have a rea-
sonable suspicion on which to make a Terry stop, however, a state law requiring per-
sons to give their names or risk arrest and prosecution is a reasonable balance
between the interest of the individual and the interest of law enforcement [Hiibel v.
Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada (2004)].
The use of profiling guidelines by police to stop persons suspected of drug traf-
ficking or other crimes is controversial. Although such profiling may be helpful to law
enforcement, the issue remains whether profiling alone can be a sufficient basis for a
stop and frisk or, for example, the search of a vehicle. The use of a drug courier profile
along with several other factors was upheld in U.S. v. Sololow (1989) as comprising
reasonable suspicion for an investigative stop under the totality of the circumstances.
Some profiling, however, targets race as an important factor, which raises serious

332
■
CHAPTER 9
questions about the reasonableness of searches, due process, and equal protection
under the law. A 1999 study by the American Civil Liberties Union reported that
along one stretch of I-95, African Americans made up 17 percent of the drivers but 73
percent of those stopped and searched. In Illinois, Hispanics made up 8 percent of the
motorists, but 30 percent of those stopped.9
Nearly half the states now prohibit racial and ethnic profiling by police, and fed-
eral guidelines do the same, but with exceptions for investigations involving terror-
ism and national security.
In Minnesota v. Dickerson (1993) the Supreme Court ruled that, in the context of a Terry
stop and frisk, contraband does not have to be in view in order to be seized. Formerly, a
police officer could seize contraband only if the pat down revealed an object that ap-
peared to be a weapon but turned out to be contraband. In Dickerson, however, the Court
ruled that if a pat down for weapons reveals an object that by feel is immediately identi-
fiable as contraband, it may be seized, thus expanding Terry to include a “plain feel” ex-
ception to the warrant requirement. After drawing parallels to plain view seizures
(discussed in Section E following) the Court emphasized the importance of the felt con-
traband being immediately identifiable as such. Because the officer had to squeeze, slide,
and manipulate the lump in the defendant’s pocket to identify it as cocaine, the search
was illegal because it exceeded the “immediately apparent” limits set in Terry.
D.
SEARCH INCIDENT TO LAWFUL ARREST
If police make a lawful arrest by probable cause or by arrest warrant, the area imme-
diately accessible to the defendant may be searched without a warrant as long as the
search is contemporaneous with the arrest. This rule prevents harm to police from
weapons within reasonable reach of an arrestee and prevents the arrestee from de-
stroying contraband or evidence of a crime [Weeks v. U.S. (1914) and Chimel v. Califor-
nia (1969)]. Four questions arise: What type of arrest justifies such a search? How close
in time must the search be to the arrest? To what areas can the search be extended?
What evidence can be seized?
First, what types of arrests allow “incident to arrest” searches? This exception ap-
plies to all lawful arrests and is not limited to those where the police need to protect
themselves, or to arrests involving serious offenses, or where evidence needs to be
protected. Pat-down searches of motorists arrested for a revoked driver’s license and
for not having a license were lawful [U.S. v. Robinson (1973) and Gustafson v. Florida
(1973)]. The pat downs in these cases were justified on the basis that the motorists
were being taken to the station, so a full custodial search was reasonable. What do you
think would be reasonable for a typical highway stop for speeding or a headlight vi-
olation? Should Robinson apply?
The Supreme Court ruled that Robinson does not apply to traffic stops in which a
citation is issued [Knowles v. Iowa (1998)]. Knowles was stopped for speeding and is-
sued a citation. Pursuant to an Iowa statute permitting a full search of driver and ve-
hicle, the officers found marijuana and a pipe for which Knowles was charged. The
need to disarm in citation cases is significantly less than in custodial arrest cases, and
the need to preserve evidence for the citation had been completed. Knowles stands for
the principle that police may not conduct full searches when incident to a citation ar-
rest where no other grounds exist for a search. In Illinois v. Caballes (2005), as we have
seen, the Court permitted the use of a narcotics dog during a routine traffic stop. This
search was permitted, however, because of the perceived reliability of drug dogs and
not because it was incident to the traffic stop.
Second, how close in time must the search be to the arrest? The search must fol-
low the arrest and be contemporaneous with it. In Preston v. U.S. (1964), three men
were arrested in a parked car. Later, the car was moved to a garage and searched. The
Court held the search was not incident to the arrest. Exceptions are made when the
police conduct a search before they make an arrest based on probable cause. Once
the arrest is made, it must stand on the original probable cause, without considera-

Search and Seizure
■333
tion of any evidence from the related search [Rawlings v. Kentucky (1980)]. A search
of a grocery bag, though contemporaneous with arrest, was unlawful because police
lacked probable cause to arrest [Smith v. Ohio (1990)].
Normally, once the property in question is in the control of the police and no dan-
ger exists for the police or to the property, the time has passed for an incident search.
There is no reason then why a warrant cannot be obtained [U.S. v. Chadwick (1977)].
A more recent decision, Florida v. Meyers (1984), suggests, however, that if police
search property well after the arrest but could have searched it lawfully at the time
of the arrest, then the subsequent search is still an incident search. This case involved
the second search of a car at the police station eight hours after the arrest.
Third, what is the allowable extent of a search incident to a lawful arrest? Chimel
v. California (1969) narrowed the range of a search by emphasizing the favored status
given searches with warrants. Under Chimel, searches incident to arrest are limited to
the immediate area of control from which the arrestee can grab a weapon or destroy
evidence. A full search of a house without a warrant is not authorized. If the arrestee
moves, the search may be moved to include the new immediate surrounding area.
Officers may walk through a house (a protective sweep) if they reasonably believe
that others who pose a threat may be present [Maryland v. Buie (1990)].
In some states the range of a search has expanded under the rationale that evi-
dence may be destroyed. Generally, police may not search accomplices or other per-
sons present unless they have probable cause specific to those persons. A Terry stop
and frisk search may apply.
The incident to arrest exception has been applied to expand the range of search
for officers in automobile cases. An officer who detected the odor of marijuana ema-
nating from a car had the occupants get out of the car and arrested them. The officer
searched the passenger area and the pocket of a jacket lying in the car. This search was
upheld in New York v. Belton (1981) on the basis that the arrestees could still reach back
into the car. The fact that an arresting officer first makes contact with a driver outside
of the vehicle, where in Belton the driver was in the vehicle, does not prevent the of-
ficer from searching the vehicle under the incident to arrest doctrine [Thornton v. U.S.
(2004)]. In 1982 the Supreme Court expanded the exception by upholding the search
of a closed container in a car on the basis that the officer had probable cause to believe
the container held contraband [U.S. v. Ross (1982)].
Distance was a factor in two U.S. Court of Appeals cases: 25 and 30 feet between
arrest and vehicle were too far to invoke the reasoning in Belton and Chimel [U.S. v.
Green (5th Cir. 2003) and U.S. v. Strahan (6th Cir. 1993)].
Fourth, what can be seized in searches incident to arrest? The law seems clear that
anything can be seized at the time of a lawful arrest if probable cause exists that the
item to be seized is contraband, fruit of a crime, or evidence of a crime.
Persons arrested and taken to jail are often subjected to strip searches. Although le-
gal in most cases, the practice of custodial strip searches has come under greater
scrutiny. They have been ruled unreasonable by some courts in the context of arrests for
misdemeanors and other minor offenses unless the police have reasonable suspicion
that the person is hiding something. Civil suits for unreasonable police strip searches
have been upheld [Jones v. Edwards (8th Cir. 1985)]. In Evans v. City of Zebulon (11th Cir.
2003), petition for rehearing en banc granted (11th Cir. 2004) plaintiffs were arrested af-
ter speeding, and one refused to take a sobriety test. When they later alleged that they
were subjected to a station strip search, choke holds, and racial slurs, the officers in-
volved had qualified immunity from a civil rights action, because the alleged conduct
did not go “so far beyond the hazy border between reasonable and unreasonable con-
duct that every reasonable officer would have to know that it violated the Constitution.”
E.
PLAIN VIEW
The “plain view” exception to the warrant requirement means that police can seize
items they happen to come across in the course of their duty, but this exception is not

334
■
CHAPTER 9
without limitations. For years the landmark case was Coolidge v. New Hampshire (1971).
Coolidge permitted plain view seizures, because plain view searches arise in the field
where a warrant is impractical, but attached limits. First, the police must be at the scene
lawfully—for example, with a valid warrant, not necessarily for the “plain view” item;
in a home but with the owner’s consent; next to the passenger window of a vehicle
they have stopped for a traffic violation; on a driveway or sidewalk; or other lawful
presence. Second, the item to be seized must be discovered inadvertently (by accident,
with no prior suspicion or probable cause to search for it). Finally, the officer must have
probable cause to believe the item is contraband or evidence of a crime. By implication
there is a further test: the item must be in plain view.
In 1987 the Court in Arizona v. Hicks (1987) strictly enforced the third prerequisite
when it ruled that an officer did not have probable cause to pick up a video recorder
and check the serial number on the bottom. Although the officer was suspicious that
the article was stolen, the serial number was not in plain view, and the suspicion had
not reached the probable cause level.
Since Coolidge, some courts have had to deal with whether the plain view discov-
ery was truly inadvertent. The Supreme Court, however, threw out this second part
of the three-part Coolidge test in Horton v. California (1990). In Horton the police had a
warrant to search for stolen springs, but also expected to find stolen weapons. In seiz-
ing the weapons, the police had clearly violated the “inadvertent” test. In expanding
this exception to the warrant requirement, the Court ruled that only two prerequisites
are needed: that police are legally on the site of the seizure and that the criminal char-
acter of the object is immediately apparent.
What happens if an officer is executing a warrant to search for drugs, the lights
go out, and in groping around she lays a hand on an illegal automatic rifle. Can she
seize the rifle even though it is not in plain sight? Some federal and state courts have
recently ruled that plain view includes the other senses, deciding several cases on the
basis of plain touch.10 As previously discussed, Minnesota v. Dickerson (1993) accepts
the “plain feel” analogy to “plain view.” This exception may eventually encompass
plain smell, plain hearing, and plain taste.
Child pornography found during a lawful search of a computer for evidence of
harassment was “seizable” under the plain view principle [State v. Schroeder (Wis.
App. 2000)].
In leaving this exception, it is important to note that while a search incident to a
lawful arrest is generally limited to the search of the area within the immediate grasp
of the arrestee, under the plain view exception items at a much greater distance from
the arrestee may be seized.
F.
MOTOR VEHICLE SEARCHES
The warrantless search and seizure of motor vehicles has long been permitted be-
cause of their mobility and to some extent their open use on public thoroughfares, re-
ducing the expectation of privacy as compared to that in a home. Such a search must
be based on probable cause to believe the vehicle contains an item of a criminal na-
ture and the likelihood that the vehicle will be unavailable by the time a warrant is ac-
quired due to exigent circumstances [Carroll v. U.S. (1925)]. The Carroll exception has
been expanded to permit a search of the vehicle after its impoundment, as well as a
search of a closed container in the vehicle.
In California v. Carney (1985) the Court decided that Carroll applied to a motor
home, even though there might be a greater expectation of privacy surrounding it
than there would be for a car and there seemed no immediate threat that the vehi-
cle would be removed. The police did have probable cause to believe that Carney
had committed a crime and that evidence of the crime would be found in the ve-
hicle. In one state case a judge ruled that a motor-driven wheelchair was a motor
vehicle.11

ANALYSIS PROBLEM
9–3.
Does this and should this open the way for searches of golf carts, mo-
torized farm implements, lawn mowers, and shopping carts?
Whether the immediate area limitation of Chimel regarding searches incident to a
lawful arrest applied to a vehicle was answered by New York v. Belton (1981). In Belton
the defendant was placed under arrest and moved away from the vehicle. The ar-
resting officer then returned to the vehicle, searched the driver’s compartment, and
eventually unzipped the pocket of Belton’s jacket found on the back seat and re-
trieved a packet of cocaine. Under the rationale that police need a clearer standard
than that expressed by Chimel in the unique situation of a motor vehicle, the Court
ruled that a warrantless search incident to an arrest in the case of a vehicle extends to
the entire passenger area and closed containers in that area on the basis that they may
be reached for use or destruction. Note that there is no need for probable cause to
search the interior or its contents if the search is incident to arrest. In the plain view
exception, probable cause is required.
In U.S. v. Ross (1982) the Supreme Court ruled that if the police have probable
cause to believe that criminal items will be found in an automobile, then the police
may search the entire car including containers in it (in this case a paper bag in the
trunk). Another line of cases says that personal items, such as luggage, carry with
them a high expectation of privacy and, regardless of probable cause, may be
searched only with a properly obtained warrant even if in a car [U.S. v. Chadwick
(1977) and Arkansas v. Sanders (1979)].
In California v. Acevedo (1991) the Court clarified the dichotomy between Ross and
Chadwick and ruled that personal containers locked in a trunk of a car may be
searched without a warrant if the police have probable cause to believe they contain
criminal items. Formerly, the police would have had to seize the bag and the person,
and then get a warrant to search the bag. Probable cause for a specific item in a spe-
cific place (the trunk), however, does not give the police authority to search the entire
vehicle. If the search yields contraband, then any occupants can be arrested, giving
police the authority to search the entire vehicle as incident to the arrest (Belton).
If the police have probable cause to search a vehicle, can they search the personal
belongings of a passenger in the vehicle? This question was raised in Wyoming v.
Houghton (1999).
WYOMING v. HOUGHTON
Supreme Court of the United States
526 U.S. 295, 119 S.Ct. 1297 (1999)
[Citations omitted]
Justice SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case presents the question whether police officers
violate the Fourth Amendment when they search a passen-
ger’s personal belongings inside an automobile that they
have probable cause to believe contains contraband.
I
In the early morning hours of July 23, 1995, a Wyoming High-
way Patrol officer stopped an automobile for speeding and
driving with a faulty brake light.There were three passengers
in the front seat of the car: David Young (the driver), his

336
■
CHAPTER 9
girlfriend, and respondent. While questioning Young, the offi-
cer noticed a hypodermic syringe in Young’s shirt pocket. He
left the occupants under the supervision of two backup offi-
cers as he went to get gloves from his patrol car. Upon his re-
turn, he instructed Young to step out of the car and place the
syringe on the hood.The officer then askedYoung why he had
a syringe; with refreshing candor, Young replied that he used
it to take drugs. At this point, the backup officers ordered the
two female passengers out of the car and asked them for
identification. Respondent falsely identified herself as “San-
dra James”and stated that she did not have any identification.
Meanwhile, in light ofYoung’s admission, the officer searched
the passenger compartment of the car for contraband.On the
back seat, he found a purse, which respondent claimed as
hers. He removed from the purse a wallet containing respon-
dent’s driver’s license, identifying her properly as Sandra K.
Houghton.When the officer asked her why she had lied about
her name, she replied: “In case things went bad.” Continuing
his search of the purse, the officer found a brown pouch and
a black wallet-type container.Respondent denied that the for-
mer was hers, and claimed ignorance of how it came to be
there; it was found to contain drug paraphernalia and a sy-
ringe with 60 ccs of methamphetamine.Respondent admitted
ownership of the black container, which was also found to
contain drug paraphernalia, and a syringe (which respondent
acknowledged was hers) with 10 ccs of methamphetamine—
an amount insufficient to support the felony conviction at is-
sue in this case. The officer also found fresh needle-track
marks on respondent’s arms. He placed her under arrest.
The State of Wyoming charged respondent with felony
possession of methamphetamine in a liquid amount greater
than three-tenths of a gram. See Wyo. Stat. Ann. § 35-7-
1031(c)(iii) (Supp.1996). After a hearing, the trial court de-
nied her motion to suppress all evidence obtained from the
purse as the fruit of a violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth
Amendments. The court held that the officer had probable
cause to search the car for contraband, and, by extension,
any containers therein that could hold such contraband. A
jury convicted respondent as charged.
The Wyoming Supreme Court, by divided vote, reversed
the conviction and announced the following rule:
“Generally, once probable cause is established to search
a vehicle, an officer is entitled to search all containers therein
which may contain the object of the search. However, if the
officer knows or should know that a container is the personal
effect of a passenger who is not suspected of criminal activ-
ity, then the container is outside the scope of the search un-
less someone had the opportunity to conceal the contraband
within the personal effect to avoid detection.” 956 P.2d 363,
372 (1998). The court held that the search of respondent’s
purse violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments be-
cause the officer “knew or should have known that the purse
did not belong to the driver, but to one of the passengers,”
and because “there was no probable cause to search the
passengers’ personal effects and no reason to believe that
contraband had been placed within the purse.” Ibid.
II
The Fourth Amendment protects “[t]he right of the people to
be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects,
against unreasonable searches and seizures.” In determin-
ing whether a particular governmental action violates this
provision, we inquire first whether the action was regarded
as an unlawful search or seizure under the common law
when the Amendment was framed. See Wilson v. Arkansas,
514 U.S. 927 (1995); California v. Hodari D., 499 U.S. 621,
(1991). Where that inquiry yields no answer, we must eval-
uate the search or seizure under traditional standards of
reasonableness by assessing, on the one hand, the degree
to which it intrudes upon an individual’s privacy and, on the
other, the degree to which it is needed for the promotion of
legitimate governmental interests. . . .
It is uncontested in the present case that the police offi-
cers had probable cause to believe there were illegal drugs
in the car. Carroll v.United States, 267 U.S. 132, (1925), sim-
ilarly involved the warrantless search of a car that law en-
forcement officials had probable cause to believe contained
contraband—in that case, bootleg liquor. The Court con-
cluded that the Framers would have regarded such a search
as reasonable in light of legislation enacted by Congress
from 1789 through 1799—as well as subsequent legislation
from the Founding era and beyond—that empowered cus-
toms officials to search any ship or vessel without a warrant
if they had probable cause to believe that it contained goods
subject to a duty. . . . See also United States v. Ross, 456
U.S. 798, (1982). Thus, the Court held that “contraband
goods concealed and illegally transported in an automobile
or other vehicle may be searched for without a warrant”
where probable cause exists. Carroll . . . We have further-
more read the historical evidence to show that the Framers
would have regarded as reasonable (if there was probable
cause) the warrantless search of containers within an auto-
mobile. In Ross, supra, we upheld as reasonable the war-
rantless search of a paper bag and leather pouch found in
the trunk of the defendant’s car by officers who had proba-
ble cause to believe that the trunk contained drugs. . . .
To be sure, there was no passenger in Ross, and it was
not claimed that the package in the trunk belonged to any-
one other than the driver.Even so, if the rule of law that Ross
announced were limited to contents belonging to the driver,
or contents other than those belonging to passengers, one
would have expected that substantial limitation to be ex-
pressed. . . . Finally, . . . Ross concluded from the historical
evidence that the permissible scope of a warrantless car
search “is defined by the object of the search and the places
in which there is probable cause to believe that it may be
found.” . . .The same principle is reflected in an earlier case
involving the constitutionality of a search warrant directed at
premises belonging to one who is not suspected of any
crime: “The critical element in a reasonable search is not
that the owner of the property is suspected of crime but that
there is reasonable cause to believe that the specific ‘things’

Search and Seizure
■337
to be searched for and seized are located on the property to
which entry is sought.”
In sum, neither Ross itself nor the historical evidence it re-
lied upon admits of a distinction among packages or con-
tainers based on ownership. When there is probable cause
to search for contraband in a car, it is reasonable for police
officers—like customs officials in the Founding era—to ex-
amine packages and containers without a showing of individ-
ualized probable cause for each one. A passenger’s personal
belongings, just like the driver’s belongings or containers at-
tached to the car like a glove compartment, are “in” the car,
and the officer has probable cause to search for contraband
in the car.
Even if the historical evidence, as described by Ross,
were thought to be equivocal, we would find that the bal-
ancing of the relative interests weighs decidedly in favor of
allowing searches of a passenger’s belongings.Passengers,
no less than drivers, possess a reduced expectation of pri-
vacy with regard to the property that they transport in cars,
which “travel public thoroughfares,” Cardwell v. Lewis, 417
U.S. 583, 590 (1974), “seldom serve as . . . the repository of
personal effects,” ibid., are subjected to police stop and ex-
amination to enforce “pervasive” governmental controls “as
an everyday occurrence,” South Dakota v. Opperman, 428
U.S. 364 (1976), and, finally, are exposed to traffic accidents
that may render all their contents open to public scrutiny.
In this regard—the degree of intrusiveness upon per-
sonal privacy and indeed even personal dignity—the two
cases the Wyoming Supreme Court found dispositive differ
substantially from the package search at issue here. United
States v. Di Re, 332 U.S. 581, (1948), held that probable
cause to search a car did not justify a body search of a pas-
senger. And Ybarra v. Illinois, 444 U.S. 85 (1979), held that
a search warrant for a tavern and its bartender did not per-
mit body searches of all the bar’s patrons. These cases
turned on the unique, significantly heightened protection af-
forded against searches of one’s person. “Even a limited
search of the outer clothing . . . constitutes a severe, though
brief, intrusion upon cherished personal security, and it must
surely be an annoying, frightening, and perhaps humiliating
experience.” Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, (1968). Such trau-
matic consequences are not to be expected when the police
examine an item of personal property found in a car. . . .
Effective law enforcement would be appreciably impaired
without the ability to search a passenger’s personal belong-
ings when there is reason to believe contraband or evidence
of criminal wrongdoing is hidden in the car. As in all car-
search cases, the “ready mobility” of an automobile creates
a risk that the evidence or contraband will be permanently
lost while a warrant is obtained. . . .
We hold that police officers with probable cause to
search a car may inspect passengers’ belongings found in
the car that are capable of concealing the object of the
search.The judgment of the Wyoming Supreme Court is re-
versed. It is so ordered.
Justice BREYER, concurring.
I join the Court’s opinion with the understanding that his-
tory is meant to inform, but not automatically to determine, the
answer to a Fourth Amendment question. . . . I also agree
with the Court that when a police officer has probable cause
to search a car, say, for drugs, it is reasonable for that officer
also to search containers within the car. If the police must es-
tablish a container’s ownership prior to the search of that con-
tainer (whenever, for example, a passenger says “that’s
mine”), the resulting uncertainty will destroy the workability of
the bright-line rule set forth in United States v.Ross. . .I would
point out certain limitations upon the scope of the bright-line
rule that the Court describes. Obviously, the rule applies only
to automobile searches. Equally obviously, the rule applies
only to containers found within automobiles. And it does not
extend to the search of a person found in that automobile. . . .
In this case, the purse was separate from the person,
and no one has claimed that, under those circumstances,
the type of container makes a difference. For that reason, I
join the Court’s opinion.
Justice STEVENS, with whom Justice SOUTER and
Justice GINSBURG join, dissenting.
. . . In light of our established preference for warrants and
individualized suspicion, I would respect the result reached
by the Wyoming Supreme Court and affirm its judgment.
In all of our prior cases applying the automobile exception
to the Fourth Amendment’s warrant requirement, either the
defendant was the operator of the vehicle and in custody of
the object of the search, or no question was raised as to the
defendant’s ownership or custody. In the only automobile
case confronting the search of a passenger defendant—
United States v. Di Re, 332 U.S. 581, (1948)—the Court held
that the exception to the warrant requirement did not ap-
ply. . . .(addressing searches of the passenger’s pockets and
the space between his shirt and underwear, both of which un-
covered counterfeit fuel rations). In Di Re, as here, the infor-
mation prompting the search directly implicated the driver,
not the passenger. Today, instead of adhering to the settled
distinction between drivers and passengers, the Court fash-
ions a new rule that is based on a distinction between prop-
erty contained in clothing worn by a passenger and property
contained in a passenger’s briefcase or purse. . . . [U]nlike
the Court, I think it quite plain that the search of a passen-
ger’s purse or briefcase involves an intrusion on privacy that
may be just as serious as was the intrusion in Di Re. . . .
Ironically, while we concluded in Ross that “[p]robable
cause to believe that a container placed in the trunk of a taxi
contains contraband or evidence does not justify a search of
the entire cab,”. . . the rule the Court fashions would appar-
ently permit a warrantless search of a passenger’s briefcase
if there is probable cause to believe the taxidriver had a sy-
ringe somewhere in his vehicle. Nor am I persuaded that the
mere spatial association between a passenger and a driver
provides an acceptable basis for presuming that they are
partners in crime or for ignoring privacy interests in a purse.
Whether or not the Fourth Amendment required a warrant
to search Houghton’s purse, . . . at the very least the trooper

338
■
CHAPTER 9
in this case had to have probable cause to believe that her
purse contained contraband. The Wyoming Supreme Court
concluded that he did not. . . .
Finally, in my view, the State’s legitimate interest in effec-
tive law enforcement does not outweigh the privacy concerns
at issue. I am as confident in a police officer’s ability to apply
a rule requiring a warrant or individualized probable cause to
search belongings that are—as in this case—obviously
owned by and in the custody of a passenger as is the Court
in a “passenger-confederate’s” ability to circumvent the rule.
Certainly the ostensible clarity of the Court’s rule is attractive.
But that virtue is insufficient justification for its adoption. . . .
Instead of applying ordinary Fourth Amendment princi-
ples to this case, the majority extends the automobile war-
rant exception to allow searches of passenger belongings
based on the driver’s misconduct. Thankfully, the Court’s
automobile-centered analysis limits the scope of its holding.
But it does not justify the outcome in this case.
I respectfully dissent.
Houghton is important because it increased the authority of police in warrantless
car searches. It stands for the principle that police with probable cause to search a ve-
hicle may search all containers in the vehicle that can conceal the object of the search,
including personal items of the passengers. The case is significant beyond that, how-
ever, because it states that the balancing test that weighs the level of intrusion into
personal privacy against the needs of law enforcement, so long a cornerstone in
Fourth Amendment cases, has become secondary to the Court’s interpretation of the
common law intent of the framers of the Constitution in the context of that histori-
cal period.
Maryland v. Wilson (1997) examined the competing interests of police officers to pro-
tect themselves from hidden weapons and the privacy interest of the driver or passen-
gerstoremaininthecar.Apersonrequiredtoexitavehicleismorelikelytoinvoluntarily
expose contraband or symptoms of intoxication. When Wilson, a passenger, was or-
dered out of the car he dropped some cocaine on the ground. Because the police had no
grounds to believe he was armed, he moved to suppress the drugs on the basis that they
were the product of an unreasonable seizure. The court ruled that the government has a
greater interest in protecting the officers than the occupants have in remaining in the ve-
hicle. Therefore, police have the authority to order occupants to exit a vehicle.
A search of motor vehicles does not require a warrant when the vehicle has been
impounded by the police and is being inventoried. Police are authorized to inventory
the contents of an auto to protect the owner’s property while in the custody of the po-
lice; to protect the government against claims of lost, stolen, or vandalized property;
and to guard the police from danger [South Dakota v. Opperman (1976)]. The inventory
must be done according to standardized procedure, and not as a subterfuge for crim-
inal investigation.
In conducting this inventory, do police have the right to open containers, partic-
ularly personal ones? The Court said yes in Colorado v. Bertine (1987) where it ruled
that an officer’s inventory of a parked van after the owner had been arrested for
drunk driving could include a search of the inside of the owner’s backpack. Opper-
man protects personal items such as checkbooks and letters from intrusion in inven-
tory searches. Some state courts, in interpreting their state constitutions or laws,
require the police to show that it is necessary to impound the car and inventory it
when other less intrusive means can protect the owner, the police, and the property
[State v. Callaway (Wis. 1982), cert. denied (1982)]. For example, if a close family mem-
ber can pick up the car, then this method should be used.
In Florida v. White (1999), the Court expanded the vehicle impoundment excep-
tion to a warrant. Even though the car was seized two months after White was ar-
rested on other charges, and the police did not have probable cause to believe the car
contained illegal drugs, the Court upheld the impoundment search, finding the po-
lice did have probable cause to believe the car had been used to deliver cocaine, that
it was in a public place when seized, and that it was subject to Florida’s forfeiture
statute.
Vehicle roadblock and border cases are discussed in Section I following.

What are the likely issues in a motion to suppress “hot pursuit”
evidence?
G.
HOT PURSUIT
Hot pursuit consists of exigent circumstances typically involving the chasing of a sus-
pect or the following of “hot” leads to the suspect. If probable cause exists to believe
that the person being pursued committed a serious crime and is in the building to be
entered, then police without a warrant may enter even a private residence to find the
suspect. The underlying theory is that once police get close to the arrest of a suspect,
the procurement of a warrant is impractical and likely to result in the imminent es-
cape of the suspect or the imminent loss of contraband or evidence. Once inside the
dwelling, the officers may look anywhere the suspect and weapons are likely to be
found. Any criminal items found in the process may be seized.
Once the suspect is arrested, however, the “search incident to arrest” rules kick in
to limit the scope of the search. The leading case for these principles is Warden v. Hay-
den (1967). The period between the time probable cause arises and the entry takes
place needs to be relatively brief. In Hayden the police arrived within minutes after the
suspect entered the building. Even though more time was involved in U.S. v. Holland
(6th Cir. 1975), the closeness in proximity of each clue to the last in a chain of clues
kept the trail fairly hot (thirty minutes overall). In one federal case, entry of the sus-
pect’s residence four hours after the crime was held to be permissible because it was
late at night and a magistrate was not readily available [Dorman v. U.S. (D.C. Cir.
1970)]. Searches conducted once the exigency evaporates generally require a warrant.
hot pursuit:
the chasing of a suspect or
the following of “hot” leads to
the suspect.
H.
EVANESCENT EVIDENCE
Evanescent evidence is criminal evidence that will change or evaporate in a manner
that will destroy its evidentiary value. For example, alcohol is detectable in the blood-
stream for only a certain period of time. If it is not tested within that time, evidence
of driving while under the influence will be lost. In Schmerber v. California (1966),
Schmerber was arrested for driving while intoxicated. While at the hospital the police
had Schmerber’s blood withdrawn by a medical technician. Schmerber challenged
his conviction on the ground that the search was without a warrant and unreasonable.
The Court emphasized that bodily intrusions bring into consideration one of the high-
est levels of expectation of privacy and personal dignity normally necessitating war-
rants. When evidence is of an evanescent nature, however, a warrant is not necessary.
In the case of a warrantless intrusion of the body, the Court required that there be a
good indication the search will produce the evidence sought and that the search be
conducted in a reasonable manner.
In Winston v. Lee (1985) the Court declared that surgery to remove a bullet embedded
in the defendant’s collarbone could not be compelled, especially because other good ev-
idence was available and the surgery may have involved some notable risks. The ruling
determined reasonableness of the intrusion to the body by the degree to which the
process threatens the health or safety of the person; offends the person’s dignity, personal
privacy, and bodily integrity; and provides needed and accurate evidence of guilt.
The evanescent exception has been applied in contexts other than blood tests or
surgery. In a California case, People v. Bullock (Cal. App. 1990), an officer’s activation
of a defendant’s electronic pager display twenty times while the defendant was being
booked was a search but did not require a warrant, because probable cause existed
and the evidence was likely to become stale or erased.

BORDER, REGULATORY, AND EMERGENCY SEARCHES
Warrantless searches have been approved by the Court in regulatory inspections and
border situations, not on the basis of exigent circumstances, but in an attempt to bal-
ance the need of government to abate and prevent dangerous conditions and the rea-
sonable expectation of privacy. The following principles have been established.
1.
Inspection of dwellings or businesses for code or safety compliance
requires a warrant. The warrant, however, requires less than a showing of
probable cause. A standard that relies more heavily on surrounding
conditions in the area that suggest a danger to the public exists or could
develop rather than a belief that a particular dwelling is in violation is all
that is needed to support the warrant [Camara v. Municipal Court (1967)].
Unannounced warrantless inspections have been approved, however, in
the case of businesses that have a history of significant government
regulation or licensure. A warrantless search of a gun shop and seizure of
unlicensed weapons [U.S. v. Biswell (1972)] and warrantless searches of
junkyards to prevent disassembly of stolen cars [New York v. Burger (1987)]
have been allowed. Another exception occurs where safety is an overriding
factor, such as in coal mines, and the legislative or administrative
regulators’ scheme is reasonable with proper limits on the discretion of
inspectors [Donovan v. Dewey (1981)].
Airport searches to prevent hijacking have been upheld on mixed
theories, including an administrative-type search for safety and a low
expectation of privacy, as long as the searches are neutral and limited in
scope. The courts have not yet faced the issue of the use of new X-ray
technology that reveals images of items, including intimate body parts,
beneath clothing.
2.
Entry to fight a fire (emergency exception) and entry a short time later (five
hours) to determine the cause of the fire do not require a warrant. Reentry,
however, should follow advance notice to the owner [Michigan v. Clifford
(1984)]. If the reentry to search comes considerably later (weeks), a full
probable cause warrant may be necessary [Michigan v. Tyler (1978)].
3.
Searches at national borders or international airports intrude on a low
expectation of privacy, so there is no need to have a reasonable suspicion,
probable cause, or a warrant to search. If the search becomes more
intrusive, then the suspicion needed to conduct the search increases. A strip
search requires “a real suspicion”; a search of body cavities requires “a clear
indication”; and for “reasonable suspicion” a person suspected of ingesting
contraband can be detained for X-rays or for Mother Nature to run her
course, so to speak [U.S. v. Montoya de Hernandez (1985)]. A customs strip
search of an air passenger who had spent a short time in a country from
which drugs had been smuggled in the past was held legal in a civil action
against the United States, even though no drugs were found by the officers
[Kaniff v. U.S. (7th Cir. 2003)]. In light of several civil suits alleging
unreasonable racial and gender discriminatory searches, customs officials
have revised and continue to study their detention and strip search policies.

Search and Seizure
■341
A roving stop of a car near the border to check if aliens are in the vehicle
requires probable cause or a warrant [Almeida-Sanchez v. U.S. (1973)], but
stopping a vehicle for questioning at a checkpoint reasonably close to the
border does not require a warrant, probable cause, or any degree of
suspicion [U.S. v. Martinez-Fuerte (1976)]. If a border guard routinely sticks
his head into a vehicle, the act is unlawful unless it is based on consent or
probable cause [U.S. v. Pierce (5th Cir. 1990)]. Yet, if an officer near the
border reasonably suspects that aliens occupy a vehicle, the vehicle can be
stopped and the occupants questioned. Any further detention, however,
requires probable cause [U.S. v. Brignoni-Ponce (1975)]. Because of “the
longstanding right of the sovereign to protect itself,” border searches are
reasonable per se. Thus, detaining a vehicle at the border to disassemble
and inspect the gas tank for illegal drugs was reasonable, despite the lack
of reasonable suspicion that the vehicle contained drugs, because the
incidence of gas tank smuggling in the area was frequent [U.S. v. Flores-
Montano (2004)].
The war on terrorism has resulted not only in more extensive border
and airport searches, but also more extensive searches of vehicles entering
military bases. The court in U.S. v. Mohrmann (D. Kan. 2004) held that an
extensive search of a civilian’s vehicle and belongings at an entrance to
Fort Leavenworth in Kansas, which turned up marijuana, was a routine
checkpoint search and, therefore, did not require a suspicion of
wrongdoing.
4.
International mail may be searched without probable cause or a warrant if
there is “reasonable cause to suspect” it contains illegally imported goods.
A warrant is needed to read correspondence [U.S. v. Ramsey (1977)].
5.
Prisoners, parolees, and probationers are generally subject to searches
without a warrant and on suspicion less than probable cause [Griffin v.
Wisconsin (1987), search by a probation officer, and U.S. v. Knights (2001),
an investigative search by a police officer].
Of course police are permitted to take photographs and fingerprints of
an arrestee as part of a custodial arrest. The taking of DNA samples from
all felons and, possibly, from all arrestees to create a massive DNA
databank will, no doubt, face constitutional challenges.
6.
Boat inspections parallel border inspections or roadblocks rather than
Carroll car stops and, therefore, do not require a warrant, probable cause,
or any degree of suspicion [U.S. v. Villamonte-Marquez (1983)].
7.
Probable cause is not needed to search the offices of public employees
when the search is for legitimate “work related” reasons, and not
specifically to ferret out criminal conduct. The test is whether the intrusion
is reasonable under the circumstances to achieve the limited purpose of the
administrative search [O’Connor v. Ortega (1987)]. Drug tests may be
required of public employees only when there is a reasonable suspicion of
the employee, or where it can be shown that drug use among the targeted
employees is widespread, or that the employees are in a position where
drug use will present a serious risk to the public.12
Suspicionless drug tests have been upheld for railroad personnel
involved in train accidents [Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives’ Association
(1989)] and, on a random basis, for federal customs officers who are armed
or involved in drug enforcement [National Treasury Employees v. Von Raab
(1989)]. There was, however, no high risk or safety-sensitive justification
for drug testing all candidates for public office (normally under
considerable public scrutiny) under a Georgia law, which, therefore, was
held by the Court to be unconstitutional in Chandler v. Miller (1997). See the
Vernonia School District case in principle 8 on the following page.

342
■
CHAPTER 9
8.
School officials, though subject to the Fourth Amendment, may search the
personal effects of students as long as the intrusion bears a reasonable
relationship in its scope to the circumstances justifying the initial
interference [New Jersey v. T.L.O. (1985)]. Consequently, school officials
need reasonable suspicion, not probable cause in the interest of
maintaining a learning environment.
In Vernonia School District 47 v. Acton (1995) the Court reconfirmed its
opinion that public school environments are unique and that school officials
will be given more latitude under the Fourth Amendment to deal with drug
and other discipline problems. A random suspicionless drug testing
program of middle and high school athletes was held constitutional.
Vernonia was expanded to allow suspicionless drug testing of students
involved in all extracurricular activities because of the “custodial and
tutelary responsibility for children” and because “[a] student’s privacy
interest is limited in a public school environment where the State is
responsible for maintaining discipline, health, and safety” [Board of Education
of Independent School District No. 92 of Pottawatomie County v. Earls (2002)].
The Court did not require evidence of an existing drug abuse problem in the
school as a prerequisite for imposing a drug testing program.
Questions have been raised regarding the costs of school drug testing
programs and the effectiveness of such programs. A recent federally
financed study of 76,000 students nationwide found that there is no
difference in drug use between schools that have drug testing and those
that do not.13 Considering the results of this test, do you think school drug
testing programs would be more effective if, for example, they tested all
students who drive to school?
A few courts have held that strip searches of students will be struck down
unless there is a showing of reasonable suspicion to search a particular
student, rather than a group of students [Kennedy v. Dexter Consolidated
School (N.M. 2000), Konop v. Northwestern School District (D.S.D. 1998), and
Sostarecz v. Misko (E.D. Pa. 1999)]. Further, the use of drug dogs to sniff
students directly, as opposed to their lockers or containers, was held to be a
search requiring reasonable suspicion in B.C. v. Plumas Unified School District
(9th Cir. 1999), but not in Doe v. Renfrow (7th Cir. 1980).
9.
Mobile road blocks and checkpoints have resulted in Fourth Amendment
seizure questions because they lead to a temporary seizure of motorists
and are not based on any degree of suspicion. The following case examines
the issues of legality in sobriety checkpoints. What are the areas of
contention between the majority and the dissent in the case?
MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF STATE POLICE v. SITZ
Supreme Court of the United States, 1990.
496 U.S. 444, 110 S.Ct. 2481.
Chief Justice REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the
Court.
This case poses the question whether a State’s use of high-
way sobriety checkpoints violates the Fourth and Four-
teenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. . . .
Petitioners, the Michigan Department of State Police and
its Director, established a sobriety checkpoint pilot program
in early 1986.The Director appointed a Sobriety Checkpoint
Advisory Committee [that] created guidelines setting forth
procedures governing checkpoint operations, site selection,
and publicity.

Search and Seizure
■343
Under the guidelines, checkpoints would be set up at se-
lected sites along state roads. All vehicles passing through a
checkpoint would be stopped and their drivers briefly exam-
ined for signs of intoxication. In cases where a checkpoint of-
ficer detected signs of intoxication, the motorist would be
directed to a location out of the traffic flow where an officer
would check the motorist’s driver’s license and car registration
and, if warranted, conduct further sobriety tests. Should the
field tests and the officer’s observations suggest that the
driver was intoxicated, an arrest would be made.All other driv-
ers would be permitted to resume their journey immediately.
. . .
During the hour-and-fifteen-minute duration of the check-
point’s operation, 126 vehicles passed through the check-
point.The average delay for each vehicle was approximately
25 seconds.Two drivers were detained for field sobriety test-
ing, and one of the two was arrested for driving under the in-
fluence of alcohol. A third driver who drove through without
stopping was pulled over by an officer in an observation ve-
hicle and arrested for driving under the influence.
On the day before the operation of the Saginaw County
checkpoint, respondents filed a complaint in the Circuit
Court of Wayne County seeking declaratory and injunctive
relief from potential subjection to the checkpoints.
. . .
After the trial, at which the court heard extensive testi-
mony concerning, inter alia, the “effectiveness” of highway
sobriety checkpoint programs, the court ruled that the Michi-
gan program violated the Fourth Amendment and Art. 1,
§ 11, of the Michigan Constitution. On appeal, the Michigan
Court of Appeals affirmed the holding that the program vio-
lated the Fourth Amendment and, for that reason, did not
consider whether the program violated the Michigan Con-
stitution. After the Michigan Supreme Court denied petition-
ers’ application for leave to appeal, we granted certiorari.

[A] Fourth Amendment “seizure” occurs when a vehicle
is stopped at a checkpoint. . . . The question thus becomes
whether such seizures are “reasonable” under the Fourth
Amendment.
. . .
No one can seriously dispute the magnitude of the
drunken driving problem or the States’ interest in eradicating
it. . . . “Drunk drivers cause an annual death toll of over
25,000 and in the same time span cause nearly one mil-
lion personal injuries and more than five billion dollars in
property damage.” 4 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure: A
Treatise on the Fourth Amendment § 10.8(d), p. 71 (2d ed.
1987). . . .
Conversely, the weight bearing on the other scale—the
measure of the intrusion on motorists stopped briefly at so-
briety checkpoints—is slight. We reached a similar conclu-
sion as to the intrusion on motorists subjected to a brief stop
at a highway checkpoint for detecting illegal aliens. See
Martinez-Fuerte.
. . .
We believe the Michigan courts misread our cases con-
cerning the degree of “subjective intrusion” and the poten-
tial for generating fear and surprise. The “fear and surprise”
to be considered are not the natural fear of one who has
been drinking over the prospect of being stopped at a so-
briety checkpoint but, rather, the fear and surprise engen-
dered in law abiding motorists by the nature of the stop.This
was made clear in Martinez-Fuerte. . . .
“ ‘[T]he circumstances surrounding a checkpoint stop
and search are far less intrusive than those attending a
roving-patrol stop. Roving patrols often operate at night
on seldom-traveled roads, and their approach may
frighten motorists. At traffic checkpoints the motorist can
see that other vehicles are being stopped, he can see
visible signs of the officers’ authority, and he is much less
likely to be frightened or annoyed by the intrusion.’ 422
U.S., at 894–895. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S., at 558.”
Here, checkpoints are selected pursuant to the guide-
lines, and uniformed police officers stop every approach-
ing vehicle. The intrusion resulting from the brief stop at
the sobriety checkpoint is for constitutional purposes in-
distinguishable from the checkpoint stops we upheld in
Martinez-Fuerte.
The Court of Appeals went on to consider as part of the
balancing analysis the “effectiveness” of the proposed
checkpoint program. Based on extensive testimony in the
trial record, the court concluded that the checkpoint pro-
gram failed the “effectiveness” part of the test, and that this
failure materially discounted petitioners’ strong interest in
implementing the program. We think the Court of Appeals
was wrong on this point as well.
The actual language from Brown v. Texas, upon which
the Michigan courts based their evaluation of “effective-
ness,” describes the balancing factor as “the degree to
which the seizure advances the public interest.” 443 U.S., at
51.This passage from Brown was not meant to transfer from
politically accountable officials to the courts the decision as
to which among reasonable alternative law enforcement
techniques should be employed to deal with a serious pub-
lic danger. . . . Neither Martinez-Fuerte nor Delaware v.
Prouse, 440 U.S. 648 (1979), however, the two cases cited
by the Court of Appeals as providing the basis for its “effec-
tiveness” review, supports the searching examination of “ef-
fectiveness” undertaken by the Michigan court.
In Delaware v. Prouse, we disapproved random stops
made by Delaware highway patrol officers in an effort to ap-
prehend unlicensed drivers and unsafe vehicles. We ob-
served that no empirical evidence indicated that such stops
would be an effective means of promoting roadway safety. . . .
Unlike Prouse, this case involves neither a complete ab-
sence of empirical data nor a challenge to random highway
stops. During the operation of the Saginaw County check-
point, the detention of each of the 126 vehicles that entered

344
■
CHAPTER 9
the checkpoint resulted in the arrest of two drunken driv-
ers. Stated as a percentage, approximately 1.5 percent of
the drivers passing through the checkpoint were arrested
for alcohol impairment. In addition, an expert witness tes-
tified at the trial that experience in other States demon-
strated that, on the whole, sobriety checkpoints resulted in
drunken driving arrests of around 1 percent of all mo-
torists stopped. By way of comparison, the record from
one of the consolidated cases in Martinez-Fuerte, showed
that in the associated checkpoint, illegal aliens were found
in only 0.12 percent of the vehicles passing through
the checkpoint. . . . We concluded that this “record . . .
provides a rather complete picture of the effectiveness of
the San Clemente checkpoint”, and we sustained its con-
stitutionality. We see no justification for a different conclu-
sion here.
In sum, the balance of the State’s interest in preventing
drunken driving, the extent to which this system can rea-
sonably be said to advance that interest, and the degree of
intrusion upon individual motorists who are briefly stopped,
weighs in favor of the state program. We therefore hold that
it is consistent with the Fourth Amendment.The judgment of
the Michigan Court of Appeals is accordingly reversed, and
the cause is remanded for further proceedings not incon-
sistent with this opinion.
Reversed.
Justice BLACKMUN, concurring in the judgment.
I concur only in the judgment. . . .
Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins,
dissenting.
. . .
The majority opinion creates the impression that the
Court generally engages in a balancing test in order to de-
termine the constitutionality of all seizures, or at least those
“dealing with police stops of motorists on public highways.”
This is not the case.
. . . Once the Court establishes that the seizure is
“slight,” it asserts without explanation that the balance
“weighs in favor of the state program.” The Court ignores
the fact that in this class of minimally intrusive searches,
we have generally required the Government to prove that
it had reasonable suspicion for a minimally intrusive
seizure to be considered reasonable. See, e.g., Delaware
v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648, (1979); United States v. Brignoni-
Ponce, 422 U.S. 873, 882–883, (1975); Terry v. Ohio, 392
U.S. 1, 27 (1968). Some level of individualized suspicion is
a core component of the protection the Fourth Amendment
provides against arbitrary government action. . . . By hold-
ing that no level of suspicion is necessary before the po-
lice may stop a car for the purpose of preventing drunken
driving, the Court potentially subjects the general public to
arbitrary or harassing conduct by the police. I would have
hoped that before taking such a step, the Court would
carefully explain how such a plan fits within our constitu-
tional framework.
. . . I respectfully dissent.
Justice STEVENS, with whom Justice BRENNAN and Jus-
tice MARSHALL join as to Parts I and II, dissenting.
A sobriety checkpoint is usually operated at night at an
unannounced location. Surprise is crucial to its method. . . .
[T]he findings of the trial court, based on an extensive
record and affirmed by the Michigan Court of Appeals, indi-
cate that the net effect of sobriety checkpoints on traffic
safety is infinitesimal and possibly negative.
. . . The Court overvalues the law enforcement interest
in using sobriety checkpoints, undervalues the citizen’s in-
terest in freedom from random, unannounced investiga-
tory seizures, and mistakenly assumes that there is
“virtually no difference” between a routine stop at a per-
manent, fixed checkpoint . . . and a surprise stop at a so-
briety checkpoint.
I.
There is a critical difference between a seizure that is pre-
ceded by fair notice and one that is effected by surprise. . . .
That is one reason why a border search, or indeed any
search at a permanent and fixed checkpoint, is much less
intrusive than a random stop. A motorist with advance notice
of the location of a permanent checkpoint has an opportu-
nity to avoid the search entirely, or at least to prepare for,
and limit, the intrusion on her privacy.
No such opportunity is available in the case of a random
stop or a temporary checkpoint, which both depend for their
effectiveness on the element of surprise. A driver who dis-
covers an unexpected checkpoint on a familiar local road
will be startled and distressed.
. . .
There is also a significant difference between the kind of
discretion that the officer exercises after the stop is made. A
check for a driver’s license, or for identification papers at an
immigration checkpoint, is far more easily standardized than
is a search for evidence of intoxication. A Michigan officer
who questions a motorist at a sobriety checkpoint has virtu-
ally unlimited discretion to detain the driver on the basis of
the slightest suspicion. A ruddy complexion, an unbuttoned
shirt, bloodshot eyes or a speech impediment may suffice to
prolong the detention. Any driver who had just consumed a
glass of beer, or even a sip of wine, would almost certainly
have the burden of demonstrating to the officer that her driv-
ing ability was not impaired.
. . .
For all these reasons, I do not believe that this case is
analogous to Martinez-Fuerte. In my opinion, the sobriety
checkpoints are instead similar to—and in some respects
more intrusive than—the random investigative stops that the
Court held unconstitutional in Brignoni-Ponce and Prouse.
. . .

ANALYSIS PROBLEM
9–6.
Identify the issues and interests in Sitz, and analyze whether the ma-
jority or the dissent has the better opinion. What is the danger if Indianapolis
v. Edmond did not draw the line at drug interdiction roadblocks?
We accordingly held that the State must produce evi-
dence comparing the challenged seizure to other means of
law enforcement, so as to show that the seizure
“is a sufficiently productive mechanism to justify the intru-
sion upon Fourth Amendment interests which such stops
entail. On the record before us, that question must be an-
swered in the negative. Given the alternative mechanisms
available, both those in use and those that might be
adopted, we are unconvinced that the incremental contri-
bution to highway safety of the random spot check justifies
the practice under the Fourth Amendment.” Id., at 659.
. . .
. . . On the degree to which the sobriety checkpoint
seizures advance the public interest, however, the Court’s
position is wholly indefensible.
. . .
[A]lthough the gross number of arrests is more than zero,
there is a complete failure of proof on the question whether
the wholesale seizures have produced any net advance in
the public interest in arresting intoxicated drivers. . . .
. . .
This is a case that is driven by nothing more than sym-
bolic state action—an insufficient justification for an other-
wise
unreasonable
program
of
random
seizures.
Unfortunately, the Court is transfixed by the wrong symbol—
the illusory prospect of punishing countless intoxicated mo-
torists—when it should keep its eyes on the road plainly
marked by the Constitution.
I respectfully dissent.
Since Sitz, the Court struck down a vehicle roadblock that used police dogs to detect
the presence of illegal drugs. The Court drew a distinction between permissible road-
blocks in “special needs” cases like Sitz (traffic safety), Martinez-Fuerte (border con-
trol), and roadblocks where the suspicionless checkpoint is used for any general crime
control purpose, such as locating any illegal drugs, an impermissible purpose [Indi-
anapolis v. Edmond (2000)]. On the other hand, a roadblock that was set up to solicit cit-
izen assistance regarding a week-old hit-and-run death at the same place and time of
day of the crime was reasonable because its purpose was not to determine whether
the occupants were committing a crime (as in Edmond) and it met the three-point
Brown v. Texas standard for reasonability:
1.
the relevant public concern was grave,
2.
the brief seizure significantly advanced the public interest in solving the
crime, and
3.
the stop interfered only minimally with liberty [Illinois v. Lidster (2004)].
J.
CONSENT SEARCHES
One of the more interesting aspects of Fourth Amendment rights is that one’s expec-
tation of privacy may be waived by oneself and others. The issues that arise where
there is a consent to search are who has the authority to grant consent, whether the
consent is voluntary, and what is the scope of the consent.
1. Who has the authority to consent?
When a person’s authority to consent to a search
of person or property is challenged, the burden is on the government to prove by a
preponderance of the evidence that the person had the necessary authority or that the

346
■
CHAPTER 9
police were reasonable in their belief that the consenting person had such authority. In
a footnote in Matlock v. U.S. (1974) the Supreme Court defined the required authority:
The authority which justifies the third-party consent . . . rests . . . on mutual use of the
property by persons generally having joint access or control for most purposes, so that it
is reasonable to recognize that any of the coinhabitants has the right to permit the
inspection in his own right and that the others have assumed the risk that one of their
number might permit the common area to be searched.
In general, third parties have authority to consent when they have mutual use
and authority over the property, as indicated:
■
A spouse (yes);
■
A live-in mate (yes);
■
A roommate (yes, but only to commonly used area—no to a separate bed-
room, for example);
■
Child (yes to enter, no to search);
■
Parents (yes);
■
Landlord (no to tenant’s apartment, yes to common areas);
■
Tenant (no to landlord’s dwelling, yes to landlord’s property kept in tenant’s
dwelling);
■
Hotel manager (no to rented room, yes if the person checked out);
■
Host (yes to areas occupied by a short-term visitor);
■
Employer (yes to work and work storage areas, no to employees’ personal
storage areas at work);
■
Employee (no for search of employer’s business premises; yes if one is a
manager with complete authority); and
■
Bailee—a bailee is one who is given goods from a bailor for safekeeping or
transport (yes for bailor’s property offered to bailee for common use, no to
locked item in bailor’s goods).14
If the police know that a person does not have the proper authority, then the con-
sent is invalid and evidence found as a result is suppressible. If the police reasonably
believe that the consent is authorized and it is not, then the intrusion is valid and the
evidence is not suppressible [Illinois v. Rodriguez (1990)]. In Rodriguez a girlfriend liv-
ing elsewhere who had lived with the defendant told police the defendant’s apart-
ment was “ours” and produced a key to the apartment. It turned out the key had been
taken without the defendant’s permission when the couple had split up a month ear-
lier and the girlfriend had moved out. The Court ruled that the evidence was not sup-
pressible because police reasonably believed that the girlfriend had the proper
authority to grant access to the apartment.
In Norris v. State (Ind. App. 2000), it was not reasonable for a police officer to be-
lieve that the driver’s consent to search his car for drugs included consent to search a
passenger’s backpack.
State drivers’ licensing laws assume the consent of licensees to submit to a breath
or blood test if they are suspected of driving under the influence of alcohol or other
drugs. This legislated consent, which is one of the costs of the privilege to drive on
the state’s highways, is called implied consent. Several state supreme courts have
wrestled with whether the state has the authority to waive a person’s Fourth Amend-
ment protections through implied consent. The Georgia Supreme Court recently
joined several other state courts saying that in circumstances where there is no rea-
sonable suspicion to believe that a person is driving under the influence of an intox-
icant, such implied consent laws are unconstitutional [Cooper v. State (Ga. 2003)].
Cooper consented to a blood test following an injury accident and his hospitalization.
The court ruled that there was no probable cause, that the purpose of the statute was
“I know of no duty of the
Court which it is more im-
portant to observe, and no
powers of the Court which it
is more important to en-
force, than its power of
keeping public bodies within
their rights. The moment
public bodies exceed their
rights they do so to the
injury and oppression of
private individuals. . . .”

to gather evidence of crime, that no “special needs” exception was warranted, and
that Cooper’s consent, seemingly compelled by law, was not voluntary.
2. Is the consent voluntary?
Consent must be voluntarily given to be valid. When
the consent is challenged, the government has the burden of showing by a prepon-
derance of the evidence that the consent was voluntary [Bumper v. North Carolina
(1968)]. To determine if the consent is voluntary the court must look to all of the sur-
rounding circumstances, the “totality of circumstances,” to see that the consent was
not coerced [Schneckloth v. Bustamonte (1973)]. This examination is parallel to the in-
quiry that must be made to see if confessions are made voluntarily (Chapter 10).
The following considerations are relevant to a determination of voluntariness.
■
Does the person know that he or she has the right to refuse consent? (This
knowledge seems to be assumed in most cases, and police are not required
to inform the person of the right.)
■
Is there anything particularly coercive about the circumstances—for exam-
ple, the presence of several officers, drawn guns, or the person being asked
is in custody?
■
Is the person particularly susceptible to coercion or likely to be unaware of
the right to refuse because of intelligence, education, or other personal fac-
tors? (Few if any cases turn on this issue.)
■
Have the police indicated they have a warrant and do not, or have they
stated they can get a warrant but in actuality know they lack probable
cause? If so, any consent is invalid, because the person giving consent be-
lieves there is no right to refuse.
■
Is there an overbearing show of force or authority that would deprive the
person of a feeling that consent can be refused?
With these considerations in mind, an officer’s statement to a suspect’s wife that
police were there to search for violations of revenue laws was found coercive in Amos
v. U.S. (1921). In U.S. v. Mendenhall (1980), a poorly educated young woman was sud-
denly confronted by identified narcotics agents. She consented to further questions
and even a more detailed search of purse and person while stating she needed to catch
a plane. The Court considered the fact that she had been told she could refuse the
searches, and found the statement about catching a plane to be a consent to a brief
search, and not a refusal to any search. Her consent was held voluntary.
The opening and subsequent closing of a motel room door by an occupant on the
realization that the persons knocking were police was not consent to enter and search
the room [Perkins v. State (Md. App. 1990)]. In U.S. v. Drayton (2002), the defendant’s
consent to a search of a bag and a pat-down search of his body was ruled valid. The
Court reasoned that he should have known that he could refuse such requests with-
out repercussion, despite being cornered on a cramped, parked bus by several police
officers who were systematically going through the bus looking for illegal drugs. For
the consent to be voluntary, it was not necessary for police to inform the defendant
that he could refuse to cooperate. See also Florida v. Bostick (1991).
The voluntariness of consent to search is at issue in an increasing number of cir-
cumstances where the police use DNA dragnets to find (or eliminate) suspects in a
particular crime. When communities ask all their black males, for example, to volun-
teer to submit to DNA testing to help solve a rape case, there are strong pressures to
submit to such testing, because not to submit raises suspicions of guilt or, at least, se-
rious questions about a person’s willingness to help the victim. Where such pressures
and stigmas are likely, is consent truly voluntary or is it coerced?
3. What is the scope of the consent?
Normally consent affects an area no greater
than that controlled by the consenting party or the area used by the consenting party

348
■
CHAPTER 9
in common with the other person. If consent is granted to search for stolen rifles, po-
lice do not have consent to start looking in small paper envelopes. The search must
also bear a reasonable proximity in time to when the consent is granted. Follow-up
searches need a warrant or additional consent. Consent may be withdrawn, but any
search up to that point is valid. Consent given to an undercover agent who is mis-
takenly believed to be an insider is valid, but consent is limited to the scope reason-
ably inferred from the circumstances [Gouled v. U.S. (1921)]. In Gouled the defendant
allowed an undercover agent to enter the premises accompanied by the defendant’s
friend. When the defendant left and the agent searched the premises, the agent ex-
ceeded the consent to enter, which did not imply a consent to search.
The permissible scope of a consent has been further defined in several cases. In
Florida v. Jimeno (1991) a motorist consented to a police officer’s request to look for nar-
cotics in the passenger area of a car. This consent was held to cover anything in the pas-
senger area of the car, including a clasped container that would be a likely storage place
for drugs. The permissible range of “you may search me” consent does not normally ex-
tend to the genital area when the search occurs in a public place such as an airport [U.S.
v. Blake (11th Cir. 1989)]. When it was not clear whether genitals were “patted down,”
however, the consent was held to cover the crotch area, even when the search occurred
in a public area [Tognaci v. State (Fla. App. 1990)]. Pat down of the crotch area has been
held not unreasonable when it occurs on a rural highway [State v. Valrie (La.App. 1992)].
Police need not inform motorists that they do not have to consent to a search of
their vehicle [Ohio v. Robinette (1996)]. States may choose to require officers to provide
such information, but the Fourth Amendment does not require it.
K.
INEVITABLE DISCOVERY
The inevitable discovery doctrine allows evidence to be admitted at trial despite an
illegal search or other illegal police activity, if that evidence would have been in-
evitably discovered had the illegal search or other illegal activity not occurred [Nix v.
Williams (1984)]. In Nix, the defendant’s illegally obtained statements led to the dis-
covery of the victim’s body. Although the statements were suppressed, evidence from
the body was used to convict the defendant. The denial of the defendant’s challenge
to the evidence was upheld by the Court on the basis that the body would inevitably
have been discovered by the independently deployed search party in the area where
the body was located.
L.
COMMUNITY CARETAKING FUNCTION
The community caretaking function exception to the warrant requirement was established
in Cady v. Dombrowski (1973). The Court ruled that police could search a disabled vehi-
cle without a warrant when they had probable cause to believe a gun was in the car and
that vandals or other persons might inadvertently discover the dangerous weapon. This
case recognized that police have a legitimate function, beyond criminal investigation, to
protect the safety of the community. State cases have expanded this concept beyond en-
try of vehicles to include entry into dwellings. In People v. Ray (Cal. 1999), the California
Supreme Court upheld a warrantless entry of a house where there was no probable
cause to believe a crime had occurred. An open front door and belongings and paper
scattered over the floor, as well as the neighbor’s concern for a possible burglary and the
residents’ safety, led police to enter the house. The illegal drugs found during the search
were used to convict the resident, and subsequently were held to be legally found by the
police under the community caretaking exception to the warrant requirement.
Exhibit 9–3 provides a capsule comparison of the exceptions to the Fourth
Amendment requirement for a warrant.

ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE
AND THE PATRIOT ACT
Electronic surveillance is the use of sophisticated electronic technology for the purpose
of listening to the conversations and observing the activities of others. Such surveillance
can be extremely intrusive, exposing the most private communications and acts to gov-
ernment observation for potentially long periods of time and encompassing much be-
havior not relevant to the crime being investigated. New laws, especially the U.S.A.
PATRIOTAct, have significantly expanded what is subject to government surveillance.
Broadly speaking, electronic surveillance encompasses wiretaps of both station-
ary and cell phones (and is being expanded to include computer phone calls); “listen-
ing” transmitters placed on premises or persons, called “bugs”; pen register and trap
and trace devices that record phone numbers, e-mails, and Web sites; tracking devices
such as “beepers” and global positioning systems; tapping of third-party databanks
including records from financial institutions, hospitals, Internet service providers, li-
braries, bookstores, and other entities; video cameras; night-vision scopes; thermal
imaging; and X-ray devices. What follows is a brief summary of the laws covering
electronic surveillance, including relevant provisions of the PATRIOT Act.15
Berger v. New York (1967) held that electronic surveillance statutes must comply
with the Fourth Amendment. Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets
Act of 1968 (18 U.S.C.A. §§ 2510 et seq.) authorizes law enforcement in criminal inves-
tigations to use “listening” devices to access the content of relevant communications.
The Act applies to federal and state investigations of specified (predicate) crimes,
which the PATRIOTAct expanded to include terrorism and related offenses. Only spec-
ified officials, such as the U.S. Attorney General, can approve the seeking of an inter-
cept order. A court can issue an order only when the application has sufficient facts for
the judge to find probable cause, and the order must guide agents on the permissible
content, scope, and duration of the intercept. The PATRIOT Act amended this law to
■
require phone, online, and other service providers to assist in facilitating the
surveillance when requested to do so;
■
permit nationwide (roving) intercepts that allow jumping from one listening
device to another as needed without specifying which ones;
■
allow sharing of information among law enforcement and foreign intelli-
gence agencies (formerly restricted to discourage spying on citizens, particu-
larly those involved in protests and other free speech activities);
■
authorize broader access to “stored communications,” such as network
stored e-mails, voice mails, documents, images, and similar communications
[Electronic Communications Privacy Act (18 U.S.C.A. §§ 2701 et seq.)]; and
■
delay required notice to the target of the intercept when to give notice may
threaten safety or the investigation.
Suppressing evidence is the remedy for breech of these provisions. With a few ex-
ceptions, anyone else who engages in wiretapping or similar activity is guilty of a se-
rious crime.
Title III standards, however, do not apply to surveillance conducted for foreign
intelligence purposes related to national security. Foreign intelligence surveillance
has long been considered the purview of the executive and legislative branches, but
not the judicial branch. Following revelations in the 1960s that the U.S. government
was “spying” on citizens and groups involved in both legitimate and illegitimate ac-
tivities in protest against the war in Vietnam, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the
Fourth Amendment required the government to get judicial approval to conduct for-
eign intelligence surveillance [U.S. v. U.S. District Ct. (1972)]. The Court indicated,
however, that Congress might require lesser strictures than those in traditional crim-
inal investigations. Subsequently, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA)
was passed [50 U.S.C.A. §§ 1801 et seq. (1978)]. FISA requires that surveillance orders

352
■
CHAPTER 9
be obtained from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. This court, created by
FISA, has eleven district court judges, operates in chambers (not open to the public),
and its orders are sealed. Its refusal to grant an order can be reviewed by the Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review. Appeal from that court is to the U.S.
Supreme Court. FISA surveillance orders do not require probable cause of wrongdo-
ing; they require probable cause to believe the target is a foreign power or agent, and
each facility or place subject to surveillance is being used or is about to be used by a
foreign power or agent. No U.S. citizen or permanent alien resident or groups sub-
stantially made up of such persons can be surveilled solely on the basis of First
Amendment activities, but evidence obtained by such surveillance has been permit-
ted to be entered in a criminal proceeding if the primary purpose for its gathering was
foreign intelligence. The PATRIOT Act amends FISA to permit wiretaps if a “signifi-
cant” purpose is foreign intelligence gathering (not the only purpose or even the pri-
mary purpose). Thus, FISA wiretaps can be instituted against citizens without any
showing of wrongdoing and when the purpose may be to gather evidence of crimi-
nal wrongdoing, negating Title III. Further, the PATRIOT Act makes it easier to share
any evidence of criminal wrongdoing among agencies and to use that evidence in
criminal prosecutions.
Although indirectly related to electronic surveillance, it is worth noting that the
PATRIOT Act (§ 215) authorizes court orders for the FBI to require the production of
“any tangible things (including books, records, papers, documents, and other items)
sought for an investigation . . . to protect against international terrorism or clandes-
tine intelligence activities” (50 U.S.C.A. § 1861 et seq.). No finding of probable cause is
required, nor is any suspicion of criminal wrongdoing. This provision allows the in-
vestigators to secretly obtain individual and group records from public libraries, reli-
gious organizations, and financial and business institutions. This raises questions
about whether the provision unconstitutionally chills the exercise of free speech, in-
cluding freedom of association.
Title 18 U.S.C.A. §§ 3121 et seq. governs the use of pen registers, which can record
phone numbers of outgoing calls, and trap and trace devices, which can record
phone numbers of incoming calls. Because there is no expectation of privacy in
phone numbers, as opposed to the content of the communication, the Fourth
Amendment does not apply [Smith v. Maryland (1979)]. It does apply, however, to the
installation of such devices when, for example, police need to go into a dwelling to
install a device [Dalia v. U.S. (1979)]. The information gathered through such devices
may point to partners in crime or lead to other evidence. Because such monitoring
can have a chilling effect on legitimate activities, the law requires agents to get a
court order to install the devices. The PATRIOT Act has made some significant
changes to this law:
■
“Processes” (expanded from “phones”) has been added to the law to permit
the use of computerized and other recording and accessing of information;
■
All kinds of data are now accessible with no prerequisite that the information
being accessed is involved in criminal, terroristic, or clandestine activities;
■
Requisites for a court order are minimal and, if met, the court is mandated to
issue the authorizing order; and
■
Orders are sealed and surveillance can be extended beyond 60 days.
Pen and trap provisions have also been expanded by the PATRIOT Act’s
amendments to FISA. Under that law the U.S. Attorney General can authorize, with-
out the necessity for a court order, surveillance of any person who is not a U.S. citi-
zen or a permanent resident or surveillance of any group largely composed of such
persons. Information, even on U.S. citizens, can be gathered if relevant to an inves-
tigation to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activi-
ties, provided the investigation of a U.S. citizen is not conducted solely on First
Amendment activities.

point of view, justify

March 4, 1861
Video surveillance by police is considered particularly invasive, requiring a war-
rant when a reasonable expectation of privacy exists. If the video also records audio,
it comes within the current provisions of Title III. Even though silent video does not
come under the oral communication parameters of Title III, the courts may look to
Title III, in addition to Fourth Amendment case law, for guidance [U.S. v. Herber (9th
Cir. 2000)]. In Herber, defendants participated in a narcotics transaction in a motel
room rented by police and equipped with a warrantless hidden video camera. The
court held that the defendants had no expectation of privacy in the room while the un-
dercover agents were present, but did have the required expectation after the agents
left. Thus, that portion of the surveillance video violated the Fourth Amendment and
the spirit of Title III provisions. The broad search provisions of the PATRIOT Act’s re-
visions of FISA, discussed previously, apply to both silent and audio video surveil-
lance [50 U.S.C.A. § 1801(f)(4)].
Justifications based on the war on terror have taken surveillance into another
sacrosanct area: attorney-client privilege. By executive order, the U.S. Attorney Gen-
eral can approve the interception of communications between a federal prisoner and
counsel, if there is reasonable suspicion that the detainee may use such communica-
tions to advance acts of terrorism.16
Tracking devices (beepers and global positioning units) are specifically excluded
from Title III [18 U.S.C.A. § 2510(12)(c)]. Awarrant may be required depending on the
extent of the invasion of privacy needed for installation or for monitoring when the
device, for example, is carried into the suspect’s dwelling.
Before leaving the topic of electronic surveillance, a general word about the PA-
TRIOT Act is in order. The Act’s provisions are in a state of flux and uncertainty. Con-
stitutional challenges to some of its more sweeping and controversial provisions are
being considered by the courts, and Congress is considering legislation to refine some
of these same provisions. Part of the Act will automatically expire unless renewed.
Therefore, should you find yourself working with this area of law, and search and
seizure in general, monitoring the latest developments will be essential.
VI.
SECRET AGENTS
The use of secret agents, either undercover police or friends of the suspect who carry
hidden microphones hoping to record incriminating statements, does not fall under
the electronic surveillance laws nor the Fourth Amendment right against unreason-
able searches. The theory relied on by most courts to deflect challenges to this type of
surveillance is that the suspect entered into the conversation voluntarily, “consensu-
ally,” and bears the risk that the party to the conversation is disloyal or a police agent
[U.S. v. White (1971)]. Cases in which the agent is not wired seem to fall under the same
principle even though the landmark cases were decided before Katz. A case of interest
is the Jimmy Hoffa case where on police instigation, a Teamster official visited Hoffa
and overheard incriminating statements by Hoffa regarding jury tampering. The sur-
veillance procedure was held to be free of Fourth Amendment constraints [Hoffa v.
U.S. (1966)].
Some state supreme courts, however, have ruled that their state equivalent of the
Fourth Amendment does require a warrant, even though the informant or secret
agent agrees to be wired for the conversation with the suspect [State v. Blow (Vt. 1991),
Commonwealth v. Fini (Mass. 1988), and State v. Glass (Alaska, 1978)]. Language in U.S.
v. Karo (1984) indicates that a homeowner retains the protection of the Fourth Amend-
ment when a guest or friend has been “bugged” without the guest’s knowledge or
consent. A secret recording by police of a defendant’s conversation with his friend in
the back of a squad car, where the two “guests” believed they had been placed for
their safety and comfort was a violation of a reasonable expectation of privacy [Bar-
rett v. State (Fla. App. 1993)].
“The law itself is on trial in
every case as well as the
cause before it.”

Quotations, 1977

CHAPTER 9
VII.
THE EXCLUSIONARY RULE
Reread the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution at the beginning of this chap-
ter. If the new nation believed that the federal and state governments would adhere
to these principles simply because they were stated in the Constitution, the more ex-
perienced nation realized that significant and repeated violation of these rights would
occur unless some means of enforcement were established. Absent any alternative
that seemed to work, the Supreme Court in Weeks v. U.S. (1914) established the
exclusionary rule, holding that any violation of the procedural safeguards of the
Fourth Amendment necessitated the exclusion from the defendant’s trial of all evi-
dence produced by that illegal search or arrest. This rule was extended to the states in
Mapp v. Ohio (1961). Every citizen’s Fourth Amendment right to privacy was pro-
tected from overzealous police and government intrusion.
The exclusionary rule is premised on the belief that the police have a personal in-
terest in the outcome of a case, so they will avoid the illegal searches and seizures that
result in loss of evidence and, consequently, possible loss of the case. Police training
and conduct since Mapp seem to bear out this premise. Wong Sun v. U.S. (1963) reaf-
firmed the exclusionary rule, calling evidence derived from an illegal arrest “fruit of
the poisonous tree” and “tainted.”
Other decisions prevent either the federal government or the states from using ev-
idence illegally seized by the other [Elkins v. U.S. (1960) and Rea v. U.S. (1956)]. Further,
the Supreme Court has limited the scope of the exclusionary rule, holding it does not
apply to illegally obtained evidence used to secure a grand jury indictment [U.S. v. Ca-
landra (1974)] and to illegally obtained evidence in parole revocation hearings [Penn-
sylvania Board of Probation and Parole v. Scott (1998)]. Although the Supreme Court had
whittled at the exclusionary rule, it stayed largely intact until U.S. v. Leon (1984).

UNITED STATES v. LEON
Supreme Court of the United States, 1984.
468 U.S. 897, 104 S.Ct. 3405.
[Citations omitted]
Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case presents the question whether the Fourth
Amendment exclusionary rule should be modified so as
not to bar the use in the prosecution’s case in chief of evi-
dence obtained by officers acting in reasonable reliance
on a search warrant issued by a detached and neutral
magistrate but ultimately found to be unsupported by prob-
able cause. . . .
I.
. . .
A facially valid search warrant was issued in September
1981 by a State Superior Court Judge.The ensuing searches
produced large quantities of drugs. . . .Respondents were in-
dicted by a grand jury in the District Court for the Central Dis-
trict of California and charged with conspiracy to possess and
distribute cocaine and a variety of substantive counts.
The respondents then filed motions to suppress the evi-
dence seized pursuant to the warrant.The District Court . . .
concluded that the affidavit was insufficient to establish
probable cause. . . . [T]he court made clear that Officer
Rombach had acted in good faith. . . .
. . .
Whether the exclusionary sanction is appropriately im-
posed in a particular case, our decisions make clear, is “an
issue separate from the question whether the Fourth
Amendment rights of the party seeking to invoke the rule
were violated by police conduct.” Illinois v. Gates. . . . Only
the former question is currently before us, and it must be re-
solved by weighing the costs and benefits of preventing the
use in the prosecution’s case in chief of inherently trustwor-
thy tangible evidence obtained in reliance on a search war-
rant issued by a detached and neutral magistrate that
ultimately is found to be defective.
. . .

Search and Seizure
■355
We . . . conclude that suppression of evidence obtained
pursuant to a warrant should be ordered only on a case-
by-case basis and only in those unusual cases in which ex-
clusion will further the purposes of the exclusionary rule.
. . . [E]ven assuming that the rule effectively deters some
police misconduct and provides incentives for the law en-
forcement profession as a whole to conduct itself in accord
with the Fourth Amendment, it cannot be expected, and
should not be applied, to deter objectively reasonable law
enforcement activity. . . .
This is particularly true, we believe, when an officer act-
ing with objective good faith has obtained a search warrant
from a judge or magistrate and acted within its scope. In
most such cases, there is no police illegality and thus noth-
ing to deter. . . .
. . . Nevertheless, the officer’s reliance on the magis-
trate’s probable-cause determination and on the technical
sufficiency of the warrant he issues must be objectively rea-
sonable, cf. Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 815–819
(1982), and it is clear that in some circumstances the officer
will have no reasonable grounds for believing that the war-
rant was properly issued.
. . .
In the absence of an allegation that the magistrate aban-
doned his detached and neutral role, suppression is appro-
priate only if the officers were dishonest or reckless in
preparing their affidavit or could not have harbored an objec-
tively reasonable belief in the existence of probable cause.
. . . Officer Rombach’s application for a warrant clearly was
supported by much more than a “bare bones” affidavit. The
affidavit related the results of an extensive investigation. . . .
Under these circumstances, the officers’ reliance on the
magistrate’s determination of probable cause was objec-
tively reasonable, and application of the extreme sanction of
exclusion is inappropriate.
Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is
Reversed.
. . .
Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins,
dissenting.
. . .
At bottom, the Court’s decision turns on the proposition that
the exclusionary rule is merely a “ ‘judicially created remedy
designed to safeguard Fourth Amendment rights generally
through its deterrent effect, rather than a personal constitu-
tional right.’ ”
. . .
[B]y admitting unlawfully seized evidence, the judiciary
becomes a part of what is in fact a single governmental ac-
tion prohibited by the terms of the Amendment. . . . The
Amendment therefore must be read to condemn not only
the initial unconstitutional invasion of privacy—which is
done, after all, for the purpose of securing evidence—but
also the subsequent use of any evidence so obtained. . . .
Such a conception of the rights secured by the Fourth
Amendment was unquestionably the original basis of what has
come to be called the exclusionary rule when it was first for-
mulated in Weeks v. United States, 232 U.S. 383 (1914). . . .
. . .
By remaining within its redoubt of empiricism and by bas-
ing the rule solely on the deterrence rationale, the Court has
robbed the rule of legitimacy. . . . Rather than seeking to
give effect to the liberties secured by the Fourth Amendment
through guesswork about deterrence, the Court should re-
store to its proper place the principle framed 70 years ago
in Weeks that an individual whose privacy has been invaded
in violation of the Fourth Amendment has a right grounded
in that Amendment to prevent the government from subse-
quently making use of any evidence so obtained.
. . .
Even if I were to accept the Court’s general approach to the
exclusionary rule, I could not agree with today’s result. . . .
At the outset, the Court suggests that society has been
asked to pay a high price—in terms either of setting guilty
persons free or of impeding the proper functioning of trials—
as a result of excluding relevant physical evidence in cases
where the police, in conducting searches and seizing evi-
dence, have made only an “objectively reasonable” mistake
concerning the constitutionality of their actions. But what ev-
idence is there to support such a claim?
Significantly, the Court points to none, and, indeed, as
the Court acknowledges, recent studies have demonstrated
that the “costs” of the exclusionary rule—calculated in terms
of dropped prosecutions and lost convictions—are quite
low. Contrary to the claims of the rule’s critics that exclusion
leads to “the release of countless guilty criminals,” Bivens v.
Six Unknown Federal Narcotics Agents, 403 U.S. 388, 416
(1971) (BURGER, C. J., dissenting), these studies have
demonstrated that federal and state prosecutors very rarely
drop cases because of potential search and seizure prob-
lems. For example, a 1979 study prepared at the request of
Congress by the General Accounting Office reported that
only 0.4% of all cases actually declined for prosecution by
federal prosecutors were declined primarily because of ille-
gal search problems. Report of the Comptroller General of
the United States, Impact of the Exclusionary Rule on Fed-
eral Criminal Prosecutions 14 (1979). If the GAO data are
restated as a percentage of all arrests, the study shows that
only 0.2% of all felony arrests are declined for prosecution
because of potential exclusionary rule problems. See
Davies, A Hard Look at What We Know (and Still Need to
Learn) About the “Costs” of the Exclusionary Rule: The NIJ
Study and Other Studies of “Lost” Arrests, 1983 A. B. F. Res.
J. 611, 635. . . .
. . .
When the public, as it quite properly has done in the past as
well as in the present, demands that those in government in-
crease their efforts to combat crime, it is all too easy for
those government officials to seek expedient solutions. In
contrast to such costly and difficult measures as building
more prisons, improving law enforcement methods, or hiring
more prosecutors and judges to relieve the overburdened

CHAPTER 9
ANALYSIS PROBLEM
9–7.
Who do you believe has presented the stronger argument in Leon, the
majority or the dissent? Why? Do you think the exclusionary rule should be
viewed as “a judicially created remedy to safeguard Fourth Amendment
Rights” as argued by the majority, or do you believe it should be viewed as
included in the Fourth Amendment right of privacy through court interpre-
tation as argued by the dissent?
court systems in the country’s metropolitan areas, the re-
laxation of Fourth Amendment standards seems a tempting,
costless means of meeting the public’s demand for better
law enforcement. In the long run, however, we as a society
pay a heavy price for such expediency, because as Justice
Jackson observed, the rights guaranteed in the Fourth
Amendment “are not mere second-class rights but belong in
the catalog of indispensable freedoms.” Brinegar v. United
States, 338 U.S. 160, 180 (1949) (dissenting opinion). Once
lost, such rights are difficult to recover. There is hope, how-
ever, that in time this or some later Court will restore these
precious freedoms to their rightful place as a primary pro-
tection for our citizens against overreaching officialdom.
I dissent.
Justice STEVENS, concurring . . . and dissenting. . . .
. . .
In my opinion an official search and seizure cannot be
both “unreasonable” and “reasonable” at the same time.
The “good faith” exception to the exclusionary rule, which applies only to a
search pursuant to a warrant, is now imposed on all federal criminal courts. Some
state courts follow Leon in the interpretation of their state constitutions. Other state
courts do not, holding that the state constitution contains no “good faith” exception
to the protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. The state supreme court
in Commonwealth v. Edmunds (Pa. 1991) said that the “good faith” exception did not
apply because the state’s constitutional provision was based on a right to privacy
rather than the deterrent to police misconduct relied on by the court in Leon.
In 1995 the Supreme Court addressed the issue of whether evidence should be
suppressed that was obtained by a police officer after an arrest based on a warrant
that had been quashed (voided) seventeen days earlier. In upholding the use of the
illegally obtained evidence, the Court said the exclusionary rule was intended to de-
ter illegal police conduct and not the negligent conduct of the computer clerk who
failed to note that the warrant was quashed. The Court went on to say the evidence
could be used under the good faith exception in Leon [Arizona v. Evans (1995)].
Take special note that most of the law formulated by the courts on search and
seizure, arrest, and confessions arises from the defendant’s attempt to have the court
enforce the exclusionary rule, to have evidence suppressed because of illegal police
conduct.
Illegal searches and seizures are resulting in increasing civil actions against police,
including civil suits under 42 U.S.C.A. § 1983 for violation of civil rights. Clearly inade-
quate warrants, even though issued by a court, do not provide police with the requisite
“good faith” exception for avoiding the exclusionary rule. A federal agent using an ap-
proved warrant was not protected by sovereign immunity, because a reasonable officer
would have realized that the warrant did not properly specify the item to be seized [Groh
v. Ramirez (2004)]. The established procedure for determining whether police have qual-
ified immunity regarding civil rights violations is set out in Saucier v. Katz (2001).
Some statutory remedies, including exclusion of evidence, and some prohibitions
of remedies are provided for violations of the electronic surveillance statutes.

VIII.
CONCLUSION
It is fundamental for paralegals working in criminal law to understand that limits are
imposed on criminal law and police procedures by the Constitution of the United
States and the individual constitutions of each state. One constitutional right that the
founders sought to protect with fervor was the right to be protected against unrea-
sonable searches and seizures. This Fourth Amendment right protects citizens from
excessive governmental action, not from private action. It has been the source of con-
siderable litigation, largely because of the Supreme Court’s exclusionary rule. This lit-
igation, which has been covered extensively in this chapter, has created an
increasingly complex set of principles and exceptions.
A basic knowledge of these principles, researched in more detail when the cir-
cumstances dictate, will give you the substantive knowledge to work effectively with
law enforcement agencies, assist prosecuting attorneys in the review and possible
drafting of search warrants, and assist defense attorneys in drafting motions to sup-
press and motions attacking any unlawful searches and seizures. Also, you will have
gained a better understanding of your own rights.

Is it state action for an off-duty police officer working as a roofer to reach
into an attic space to retrieve illegal drugs? What arguments are there on
both sides of the issue? See U.S. v. Paige, 136 F.3d 1012 (5th Cir. 1998).

3.
Police have consent to enter the defendant’s motel room after the
defendant has checked out. They search the motel room’s trash baskets
and find incriminating evidence. Assuming the motel owners’ consent was
valid, should the police have had a warrant? Does the defendant have a
reasonable expectation of privacy that would exclude the evidence from
trial? See Abel v. U.S., 362 U.S. 217, 80 S.Ct. 683 (1960).

CHAPTER 9
4.
Based on the cases in this section, draw analogies to resolve the following
case. Police become aware that several individuals in town have ordered
fifty gallons of ether from a photographic supply outlet. The police are
informed that the ether will be used to extract cocaine from clothing
imported into the United States. With the permission of the supply outlet,
police place an electronic tracking “beeper” in the drum of ether.
The drum is picked up by three persons and placed in their vehicle.
Police track the vehicle both visually and by the beeper. Eventually the
beeper tells police that the drum has been deposited at K’s residence where
it remains, according to beeper signals, for several days.
Eventually the police get a search warrant and find cocaine and
laboratory equipment. K challenges the use of the cocaine and equipment
as evidence on the basis that they were the fruit of an illegal search (i.e., the
use of the “beeper” to locate the drum).
You are the judge. Write an opinion on the suppressibility of the
evidence. Assume that there was no other evidence or support of the police
search warrant beyond that obtained by the beeper. See U.S. v. Karo, 468
U.S. 705, 104 S.Ct. 3296 (1984).
5.
As a paralegal for the prosecuting attorney, write a memo that your
supervisor can use in deciding on a response to a challenge to the warrant
in this case.
A warrant specifies a search for x contraband in the second floor
dwelling of a yellow and white house located at 315 George St. in a
properly named county and city. When the police arrive, they see that the
second floor of the house has been divided into two apartments instead of
one. The police proceed to search both apartments. Eventually the
defendant challenges the warrant and requests suppression of evidence on
the basis that the description in the warrant was not specific enough (i.e.,
“second floor dwelling” instead of “apartment A” or “B”).
On what would you base your memo? Would it make any difference if
the warrant said “dwelling at 315 George St.,” only for the police to find a
house and a cottage at that address and the police searched them both? See
Maryland v. Garrison, 480 U.S. 79, 107 S.Ct. 1013 (1987).
6.
Using the documents in Exhibits 9–1 and 9–2 as a guide and using forms
for your state, if available, draft a search warrant and supporting
affidavit for judicial approval in the Eldon Spiers case. Use the following
scenario.
Following Eldon Spiers’ arrest, the Legalville police want to search his
apartment for evidence of the crime. Assume that the arrest occurred
yesterday, that Kate Lamb said it was the university janitor who regularly
worked nights at the lecture hall, and that he was medium build, about
5′10″ tall, and was wearing camouflage pants and a green army jacket; that
she described the knife blade as longer than a typical pocket knife but
narrow; and that she may have pulled off one of the jacket buttons. Ms.
Lamb’s statement was two days ago.
7.
Identify the issues and points that may lead to a successful attack on the
“nightmare” search at the beginning of this chapter.
8.
Write a paragraph on a sample case or two from your state’s courts that
shows whether or how far the reasonableness or stop and frisk exception
to the arrest requirement has been expanded in your state.
9.
Compare rationales in the Sitz, Edmond, and Lidster decisions. Assume that
evidence in a case similar to Lidster reveals that the secret, primary reason
for the roadblock was not to gain citizen assistance in the crime as stated to
the public, but to see if such a roadblock could cause the perpetrator to
reveal him or herself in some manner. Write a couple of paragraphs on

Search and Seizure
■359
whether case law and Fourth Amendment principles would require a
different result from that in Lidster.
10.
A driver was pulled over by police for legally having his left turn signal on
but failing to change lanes. Without further evidence to arouse suspicion
and after ninety seconds, police got the driver’s consent to search the car,
which turned up illegal drugs. Is the search a reasonable investigative
detention [U.S. v. Miller, 146 F.3d 274 (5th Cir. 1998)]?
11.
Assume that you are doing an internship in your school’s attorney’s office.
The governing board has noted an increase in incidents involving the
possession and sale of methamphetamine on campus. Police reports
indicate that the meth is being brought to campus by commuters.
Consequently, the board has asked the school attorney to research the
legality of implementing a school policy that requires all students with
commuter parking stickers to take periodic drug tests. The attorney asks
you to use the Internet to find what is used to manufacture meth, the most
current cases on the issue, and whether any other schools, including high
schools, have adopted or are considering such issues. Then write a short
memo listing the usual suspect ingredients and whether the cases and
applicable standards permit such a plan.
12.
Write a brief memo for your supervising attorney on whether the
precedent-setting ruling in Leon should control the following case.
Facts: Police search and seize evidence from the defendant under a state
statute authorizing warrantless administrative searches of licensed
automobile parts stores. Later the statute is ruled unconstitutional. Should
the evidence be suppressed or should the Leon exception apply?
Hint: Is there any difference between a judge authorizing a search and
the legislature authorizing a search? Illinois v. Krull, 480 U.S. 340, 107 S.Ct.
1160 (1987).

CHAPTER 10
I.
INTRODUCTION
“It is my duty to warn you that it will be used against you,” cried the inspector, with
the magnificent fair-play of the British criminal law.
—Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
“The Adventure of the Dancing Men”
The need to balance aggressive law enforcement with the preservation of human dig-
nity and freedom compete daily in our criminal justice system, as if one need were
continually trying to wrest control from the other. We have seen how this struggle is
joined in the area of searches and seizures. Now we will see how the law balances
these societal needs in the context of other police investigatory procedures.
A number of constitutional rights and protections arise in the course of police in-
vestigation. The Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination puts limits on po-
lice interrogation and confession. It is one of the most litigated and, possibly, the most
misunderstood of our constitutional rights. The suspect is also protected by the right
to due process and the right to counsel at the crucial early stages of criminal pro-
ceedings, such as lineups and other identification processes. In both the prosecution
and defense of a case, numerous opportunities exist for you to employ your skills as
a paralegal to either support or challenge police investigation practices.
II.
THE FIFTH AMENDMENT PRIVILEGE AGAINST
SELF-INCRIMINATION
A.
INTRODUCTION
No person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against
himself. . . .
—United States Constitution, Fifth Amendment
The right against self-incrimination goes to the very heart of our criminal justice sys-
tem. It is founded in the belief that the burden must rest on the state to prove that a
person is guilty of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt. The proof of guilt must be
sound, reliable evidence and must rely on extrinsic sources such as witnesses and sci-
entific analysis as much as or more than it does on confessions of the accused. Our ac-
cusatory system of justice depends on the government’s gathering, presenting, and
testing a broad range of evidence against an aggressive defense.
The importance of this accusatory approach becomes clear when contrasted to a
system that relies solely, or nearly so, on the confession, especially a confession that
goes without challenge.
[A] system of criminal law enforcement which comes to depend on the “confession”
will, in the long run, be less reliable and more subject to abuses than a system which
depends on extrinsic evidence, independently secured through skillful investigation.
—Justice Goldberg
Escobedo v. Illinois, 1964
Emphasis on an unchallenged confession to prove guilt places tremendous
power and temptation in the hands of government officials. Why spend all the extra
time getting outside corroborating evidence when all police need is the simple state-
ment, “I did it”? And, to avoid unnecessary time and expense, why not allow the po-
lice to use strong measures, yes, even torture, to assure a quick conviction? This
approach was at one time the basis of the European inquisitional system of justice.
The brutal Spanish Inquisition and English Star Chamber, political show trials like

Confessions and Pretrial Identification Procedures
■365
Stalin’s Moscow trials and Hitler’s Reichstag trial, and, disgracefully, a few of the tri-
als in this country have relied on confessions that have been beaten or otherwise tor-
tured out of people, innocent people. Torture is still a legal means to extract
confessions in some countries.
Therefore, the right against self-incrimination is designed to keep the burden of
proof on the state, to force the government to find a variety of reliable evidence, and
substantially to reduce the temptation to use excessive means to coerce confessions.
Each of these safeguards, of course, stems from the belief that protection against such
abuses is consistent with finding the truth and preserving our dignity and liberty.
In practice, however, constitutional rights are only as strong as the teeth in the law
that enforces their protection. Today, that protection is afforded by the exclusionary
rule, which means that any confession or evidence that is obtained in violation of a de-
fendant’s FifthAmendment rights can be excluded from use by the prosecution at trial.
The right against self-incrimination deals not only with direct confessions, but
also with other kinds of self-incriminating testimony during criminal proceedings. It
extends back in the process to hearings other than the criminal trial, to “any . . . pro-
ceeding, civil or criminal, formal or informal, where the answers might incriminate
[the person] in future criminal proceedings” [Lefkowitz v. Turley (1973)]. The court must
consider two questions in deciding whether to suppress the testimony of a defendant:
(1) Does the testimony incriminate or tend to prove criminal conduct? and (2) Could
the testimony be used in a future criminal proceeding that may lead to punishment?
B.
WHO IS PROTECTED BY THE RIGHT 
AGAINST SELF-INCRIMINATION?
Persons, and not corporations, are protected. Corporate officers may not invoke the
Fifth Amendment to protect the corporation from criminal liability. They can, how-
ever, invoke the right for any personal acts, statements, or papers that may lead to
their own criminal prosecution. Documents in the possession of a third party, such as
tax forms held by an accountant, are subject to prosecutorial subpoena and cannot be
protected except in the case of attorney-client privilege. The privilege protects crimi-
nal defendants and witnesses who, if they were forced to give incriminating testi-
mony, might ultimately face prosecution.
The right not to incriminate oneself, however, does not protect persons who lie
when responding to potentially incriminating questions from police, such as “Is this
your gun?” This “exculpatory no” is a false statement subject to felony prosecution
under 18 U.S.C.A. § 1001 [Brogan v. U.S. (1998)] and parallel state laws. False or per-
jured statements are not protected in a subsequent trial for perjury or obstruction of
justice [U.S. v. Veal (11th Cir. 1998)]. If a witness faces prosecution only in a foreign
country, the privilege against self-incrimination does not apply [U.S. v. Balsys (1998)].
A witness at trial must affirmatively assert the protection of the Fifth Amend-
ment. If that assertion has been made, subsequent incriminating testimony can be
found to be compelled [U.S. v. Monia (1943)]. At trial there is no duty to inform a wit-
ness of the right to invoke the privilege. In an interrogation setting, however, the pro-
tection is greater because the police have an affirmative duty to inform the witness or
suspect of the right to remain silent [Miranda v. Arizona (1966)].
“Ours is an accusatorial and
not an inquisitorial system—
a system in which the state
must establish guilt by evi-
dence independently and
freely secured and may not
by coercion prove its charge
against an accused out of
his own mouth.”
—Felix Frankfurter, majority
opinion that confessions
extracted by police coer-
cion may not be used in
evidence, March 26, 1961
ANALYSIS PROBLEM
10–1.
Can you think of reasons why the courts have required informing a
witness of the right to invoke the privilege against self-incrimination in an
interrogation setting and not at trial?

or fruits from those state-
ments that are incriminating

C.
IN WHAT KINDS OF HEARINGS MAY THE RIGHT
BE EXERCISED?
Criminal trials and questions in proceedings that may lead to criminal trials, juvenile
delinquency procedures [In re Gault (1967)], and death penalty sentencing hearings
[Estelle v. Smith (1981)] are sufficiently linked to the imposition of punishment to be
defined as “criminal” proceedings. Some kinds of procedures have been held to be
“noncriminal” or civil in nature because they do not lead to additional convictions or
penalties beyond the original conviction or sentence, or they are perceived as reha-
bilitative as opposed to penal. Consequently, the privilege has been held inapplicable
to statements for or at psychiatric commitments [French v. Blackburn (M.D.N.C. 1977)],
compensatory civil proceedings, probation revocations [Minnesota v. Murphy (1984)],
and even in sexual offender commitment proceedings [Allen v. Illinois (1986)]. These
decisions are limited to instances where the statements will not lead to or cannot be
used in any new criminal prosecutions. The dissent in the Allen sexual offender com-
mitment decision criticized the majority, however, for ignoring the obvious fact that
such commitments are the result of criminal behavior and may result in extended in-
carceration in prison facilities. The privilege applies at grand jury hearings, but wit-
nesses are not so well protected there as they are when questioned by police, as we
will see in the coming discussion of the Miranda case.
D.
WHAT IS INCRIMINATING TESTIMONY?
Testimony is incriminating when it “furnish[es] a link in the chain of evidence
needed to prosecute” [Hoffman v. U.S. (1951)]. This definition is broad and may in-
clude answers to seemingly innocuous questions, such as what is your name, occu-
pation, place of residence. The context in which the question is posed is critical in
determining incrimination. To avoid being in contempt of court for not responding to
a question, a witness must invoke the Fifth Amendment privilege specifically. The
prosecution may object, but incurs the nearly impossible burden of proving that the
information will not be incriminating (Hoffman).
Prosecutors often secure evidentiary documents through a subpoena duces tecum.
These subpoenas generally withstand Fifth Amendment assertions, except where it is
illegal to possess the document itself or where production of the document will verify
the otherwise doubtful and incriminating existence of the document [U.S. v. Doe (1984)].
Once again, specific facts of the case determine whether the production of the document
is incriminating to the person in possession of the document.
E.
WHEN CAN INCRIMINATING TESTIMONY
BE COMPELLED?
1.
Under Immunity
Situations exist when an answer is incriminating and can be compelled. The first is
when the statute of limitations has run on the crime, preventing the perpetrator’s
prosecution, and the second occurs when the witness is granted immunity from pros-
ecution. Immunity is a prosecutor’s or superior’s binding promise that a person will
not be prosecuted for certain crimes in exchange for helping to convict others with
testimony that, except for the immunity, would incriminate that person of those
crimes. Once immunity is granted, a witness can be compelled to testify under threat
of contempt for refusal to do so.
There are two types of immunity, use and transactional. Use immunity is re-
stricted to any statements or fruits from those statements that are incriminating in re-
gard to the crime at issue. Any incidental statements that incriminate the witness
regarding other crimes are not immunized. Transactional immunity is broader and
does immunize the witness for incriminating statements about other crimes. Because
transactional immunity:
immunizes the witness for
incriminating statements
about the crime at issue as
well as other crimes.

Confessions and Pretrial Identification Procedures
■367
well-advised witnesses tend to protect themselves from prosecution by “confessing”
all their sins while under transactional immunity, the federal government and many
states now restrict immunity to use immunity.
Even if a witness may avoid conviction through immunity or the running of the
statute of limitations, might the testimony be so humiliating, so damaging to the wit-
ness’s reputation that it raises the testimony to the level of incrimination? What do
you think? The courts have rejected such attempts to expand the legal definition of in-
criminating [Ullmann v. U.S. (1956) and Brown v. Walker (1896)].
Once immunity is granted, it is good in other jurisdictions, including the federal
system if granted in a state court and vice versa. Immunized testimony cannot be
used in a later prosecution of the witness on other charges to show the witness’s tes-
timony is inconsistent with his or her protected testimony [New Jersey v. Portash
(1979)]. An exception to this rule applies if the witness is later prosecuted for perjury
while under a grant of immunity. In such cases, the immunized testimony can be en-
tered in evidence to show its falsehood [U.S. v. Apfelbaum (1980)].
In U.S. v. Hubbell (2000), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that documents disclosed
under a grant of immunity in one prosecution could not be used as evidence in a sub-
sequent, unrelated prosecution where the act of producing the documents was the
“first step in a chain of evidence leading to” the second prosecution.
2.
Without Immunity
There are other circumstances when incriminating evidence can be compelled and
are, for all practical purposes, true exceptions to the compulsion prohibition.
Statutes occasionally require the keeping or reporting of information that may be
or is incriminating. Certain kinds of administrative information or the reporting of
unlawful income on an income tax form can be incriminating. Generally, the law
holds that the right must be affirmatively asserted before the records are kept or
before the question is answered. If not, any right against disclosure is viewed as
voluntarily waived. If the reporting statute has criminal penalties for not reporting,
the records may be lawfully compelled if there is an overriding public interest.
That would be the case, for example, on various forms reporting securities trans-
actions, prices under an emergency price control, or industry safety measures
[Shapiro v. U.S. (1948)]. Compulsion is also legal when statutorily authorized, as in
the case of having to stop at a traffic accident and provide one’s name [California v.
Byers (1971)].
In contrast, if the statute compels reporting and is directed at a specific group that
is inherently suspect of criminal activity, and focuses on an area of law permeated
with criminal statutes, then the reporting provision of such a statute is an unconsti-
tutional violation of the right against self-incrimination [Albertson v. Subversive Activ-
ities Control Board (1965)]. Under Albertson and subsequent decisions, statutes or parts
of statutes that compelled a person to register as a communist, declare earnings from
gambling, and report drug possession for purposes of taxation were declared an un-
constitutional violation of the right against self-incrimination. Federal and state gen-
eral income tax reporting statutes are not unconstitutional under those guidelines
[U.S. v. Sullivan (1927)].
Methods and statutes that chill the assertion of self-incrimination protection gen-
erally violate the Fifth Amendment. Police officers suspected of corruption, who were
told that they would be fired if they exercised their Fifth Amendment privilege, had
their convictions reversed on the basis that their incriminating statements were not
voluntarily given [Garrity v. New Jersey (1967)]. When a defendant requests a court to
instruct the jury that they are to draw no “adverse inferences” from a defendant’s de-
cision not to testify, the judge must give that instruction [Carter v. Kentucky (1981)].
Any mention by the prosecution of a defendant’s failure to testify is grounds for im-
mediate mistrial [Griffin v. California (1965)].

CHAPTER 10
ANALYSIS PROBLEM

Do you think the court’s instruction to the jury to draw no “adverse
inferences” from a defendant’s decision not to testify actually hurts the de-
fendant by calling attention to the failure to testify?
ANALYSIS PROBLEM
10–3.
Do you think polygraph (lie detector) tests should be considered a vi-
olation of the right against self-incrimination? Why or why not?
F.
HOW FAR DOES A WAIVER OF THE RIGHT EXTEND?
If a person gives incriminating evidence at a trial or a grand jury hearing on a partic-
ular crime, that person cannot subsequently refuse to answer a question on the details
of that crime unless the answer to the new question will provide a link to other crimes
or a connection to another independent link between the witness and the crime at
hand [Rogers v. U.S. (1951) and Shendal v. U.S. (9th Cir. 1963)].
If a witness waives the right, the waiver does not extend to future hearings. A mi-
nority of federal courts have ruled, however, that a waiver at a grand jury hearing by
a witness extends to the trial of the matter if the witness is not the defendant at trial.1
G.
WHEN IS EVIDENCE TESTIMONIAL?
As a general rule evidence that is testimonial, meaning communicative in nature, is
protected by the privilege. Evidence that is physical, used for identification, or is as
likely to prove innocence as guilt is not protected [Schmerber v. California (1966)]. This
rule and subsequent decisions hold that the following compelled acts are not a viola-
tion of the right against self-incrimination: giving blood and urine samples, appear-
ing in lineups, wearing particular clothing in a lineup, giving fingerprints, giving
writing or voice samples, providing one’s name, stopping at an accident, being pho-
tographed, displaying tattoos or scars, and others. In Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District
(2004), previously discussed in Chapter 9, the Court ruled that Nevada’s law allow-
ing arrest and prosecution for failure to give one’s name to police did not, in Hiibel’s
circumstances, violate the rule against self-incrimination. The Court did say, however,
that if giving one’s name would be incriminating, that is, lead to a chain of incrimi-
nating evidence, then the refusal would be protected under the right to remain silent.
As we have seen, production of documents under subpoena may or may not be testi-
monial, depending on the circumstances.
III.
CONFESSIONS AND INTERROGATION:
MIRANDA
A.
INTRODUCTION
The law on confessions has evolved in the Supreme Court’s attempt to determine a
workable principle of law. The task has been and still is to balance the need of law en-
forcement to ferret out crime while preserving a system that values voluntary as op-
posed to coerced confessions. This balance is a key difference between the accusatory
and inquisitional systems of justice. For a while the Supreme Court relied on the Fifth

Confessions and Pretrial Identification Procedures
■369
Amendment’s due process clause to suppress confessions that were not voluntary.
Then it rested its decisions to suppress on a denial of the right to counsel in Massiah
v. U.S. (1964) and Escobedo v. Illinois (1964). Fears grew, however, that reliance on the
right to counsel argument could jeopardize even “volunteered” statements.2 Thus,
the Court sought still another approach that came with the landmark decision of Mi-
randa v. Arizona (1966).
“The great generalities of
the Constitution have a con-
tent and a significance that
vary from age to age.”
—Benjamin N. Cardozo, The
Nature of the Judicial
Process, 1921
MIRANDA v. ARIZONA
Supreme Court of the United States, 1966.
384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602.
Mr. Chief Justice WARREN delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The cases before us raise questions which go to the roots
of our concepts of American criminal jurisprudence: the re-
straints society must observe consistent with the Federal
Constitution in prosecuting individuals for crime. More
specifically, we deal with the admissibility of statements ob-
tained from an individual who is subjected to custodial po-
lice interrogation and the necessity for procedures which
assure that the individual is accorded his privilege under the
Fifth Amendment to the Constitution not to be compelled to
incriminate himself.
. . .
We start here, as we did in Escobedo, with the premise that
our holding is not an innovation in our jurisprudence, but is an
application of principles long recognized and applied in other
settings. We have undertaken a thorough re-examination of
the Escobedo decision and the principles it announced, and
we reaffirm it.That case was but an explication of basic rights
that are enshrined in our Constitution—that “No person . . .
shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness
against himself,” and that “the accused shall . . . have the
Assistance of Counsel”—rights which were put in jeopardy in
that case through official overbearing. These precious rights
were fixed in our Constitution only after centuries of persecu-
tion and struggle. And in the words of Chief Justice Marshall,
they were secured “for ages to come, and . . . designed to ap-
proach immortality as nearly as human institutions can ap-
proach it,” Cohens v.Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 387 (1821).
. . .
I.
The constitutional issue we decide in each of these cases is
the admissibility of statements obtained from a defendant
questioned while in custody or otherwise deprived of his free-
dom of action in any significant way. In each, the defendant
was questioned by police officers, detectives, or a prosecut-
ing attorney in a room in which he was cut off from the outside
world. In none of these cases was the defendant given a full
and effective warning of his rights at the outset of the interro-
gation process. In all the cases, the questioning elicited oral
admissions, and in three of them, signed statements as well
which were admitted at their trials.They all thus share salient
features—incommunicado interrogation of individuals in a
police-dominated atmosphere, resulting in self-incriminating
statements without full warnings of constitutional rights.
An understanding of the nature and setting of this in-custody
interrogation is essential to our decisions today.The difficulty in
depicting what transpires at such interrogations stems from the
fact that in this country they have largely taken place incom-
municado. From extensive factual studies undertaken in the
early 1930’s, including the famous Wickersham Report to Con-
gress by a Presidential Commission, it is clear that police
violence and the “third degree” flourished at that time.5 In a
series of cases decided by this Court long after these studies,
the police resorted to physical brutality—beating, hanging,
whipping—and to sustained and protracted questioning in-
communicado in order to extort confessions.6 The Commis-
sion on Civil Rights in 1961 found much evidence to indicate
that “some policemen still resort to physical force to obtain
confessions,”1961 Comm’n on Civil Rights Rep., Justice, pt.5,
5. See, for example, IV National Commission on Law Observance
and Enforcement, Report on Lawlessness in Law Enforcement

dicial Examination of the Accused—A Remedy for the Third Degree,

degree treatment of prisoners almost invariably took place during the
period between arrest and preliminary examination. Wickersham

nately, relegated to the past or to any part of the country. Only
recently in Kings County, New York, the police brutally beat,
kicked and placed lighted cigarette butts on the back of a po-
tential witness under interrogation for the purpose of securing
a statement incriminating a third party. People v. Portelli, 15
N.Y.2d 235, 205 N.E.2d 857, 257 N.Y. S. 2d 931 (1965).7
The examples given above are undoubtedly the excep-
tion now, but they are sufficiently widespread to be the ob-
ject of concern. Unless a proper limitation upon custodial
interrogation is achieved—such as these decisions will
advance—there can be no assurance that practices of this
nature will be eradicated in the foreseeable future.The con-
clusion of the Wickersham Commission Report, made over
30 years ago, is still pertinent:
“To the contention that the third degree is necessary to get
the facts, the reporters aptly reply in the language of the
present Lord Chancellor of England (Lord Sankey): ‘It is
not admissible to do a great right by doing a little
wrong. . . . It is not sufficient to do justice by obtaining a
proper result by irregular or improper means.’ Not only
does the use of the third degree involve a flagrant viola-
tion of law by the officers of the law, but it involves also the
dangers of false confessions, and it tends to make police
and prosecutors less zealous in the search for objective
evidence.As the NewYork prosecutor quoted in the report
said, ‘It is a short cut and makes the police lazy and un-
enterprising.’ Or, as another official quoted remarked: ‘If
you use your fists, you are not so likely to use your wits.’
We agree with the conclusion expressed in the report, that
‘The third degree brutalizes the police, hardens the pris-
oner against society, and lowers the esteem in which the
administration of justice is held by the public.’ ” IV National
Commission on Law Observance and Enforcement, Re-
port on Lawlessness in Law Enforcement 5 (1931).
Again we stress that the modern practice of in-custody
interrogation is psychologically rather than physically ori-
ented. As we have stated before, “Since Chambers v.
Florida, 309 U.S. 227, this Court has recognized that coer-
cion can be mental as well as physical, and that the blood
of the accused is not the only hallmark of an unconstitu-
tional inquisition.” Blackburn v. Alabama, 361 U.S. 199, 206
(1960). . . .
[O]fficers are told by the manuals that the “principal psy-
chological factor contributing to a successful interrogation is
privacy—being alone with the person under interrogation.”. . .
To highlight the isolation and unfamiliar surroundings, the
manuals instruct the police to display an air of confidence in
the suspect’s guilt and from outward appearance to maintain
only an interest in confirming certain details.The guilt of the
subject is to be posited as a fact.The interrogator should di-
rect his comments toward the reasons why the subject com-
mitted the act, rather than court failure by asking the subject
whether he did it. Like other men, perhaps the subject has
had a bad family life, had an unhappy childhood, had too
much to drink, had an unrequited desire for women. The of-
ficers are instructed to minimize the moral seriousness of
the offense, to cast blame on the victim or on society.These
tactics are designed to put the subject in a psychological
state where his story is but an elaboration of what the police
purport to know already—that he is guilty. Explanations to
the contrary are dismissed and discouraged.
The texts thus stress that the major qualities an inter-
rogator should possess are patience and perseverance.
One writer describes the efficacy of these characteristics in
this manner:
“In the preceding paragraphs emphasis has been
placed on kindness and strategems. The investigator
will, however, encounter many situations where the
sheer weight of his personality will be the deciding fac-
tor.Where emotional appeals and tricks are employed to
no avail, he must rely on an oppressive atmosphere of
dogged persistence. He must interrogate steadily and
without relent, leaving the subject no prospect of
surcease. He must dominate his subject and overwhelm
him with his inexorable will to obtain the truth. He should
interrogate for a spell of several hours pausing only for
the subject’s necessities in acknowledgment of the need
to avoid a charge of duress that can be technically sub-
stantiated. In a serious case, the interrogation may con-
tinue for days, with the required intervals for food and
sleep, but with no respite from the atmosphere of domi-
nation. It is possible in this way to induce the subject to
talk without resorting to duress or coercion. The method
should be used only when the guilt of the subject ap-
pears highly probable.”14
The manuals suggest that the suspect be offered legal
excuses for his actions in order to obtain an initial admission
of guilt. . . .
When the techniques described above prove unavailing,
the texts recommend they be alternated with a show of
7. In addition, see People v. Wakat, 415 Ill. 610, 114 N.E.2d 706
(1953); Wakat v. Harlib, 253 F.2d 59 (C. A. 7th Cir. 1958) (defendant
suffering from broken bones, multiple bruises and injuries suffi-
ciently serious to require eight months’ medical treatment after be-
ing manhandled by five policemen); Kier v. State, 213 Md. 556, 132
A.2d 494 (1957) (police doctor told accused, who was strapped to a
chair completely nude, that he proposed to take hair and skin scrap-
ings from anything that looked like blood or sperm from various parts
of his body); Bruner v. People, 113 Colo. 194, 156 P.2d 111 (1945)
(defendant held in custody over two months, deprived of food for 15
hours, forced to submit to a lie detector test when he wanted to go
to the toilet); People v. Matlock, 51 Cal. 2d 682, 336 P.2d 505 (1959)
(defendant questioned incessantly over an evening’s time, made to
lie on cold board and to answer questions whenever it appeared he
was getting sleepy). Other cases are documented in American Civil
Liberties Union, Illinois Division, Secret Detention by the Chicago
Police (1959); Potts, The Preliminary Examination and “The Third
Degree,” 2 Baylor L. Rev. 131 (1950); Sterling, Police Interrogation

Confessions and Pretrial Identification Procedures
■371
some hostility. One ploy often used has been termed the
“friendly-unfriendly” . . . act:
The interrogators sometimes are instructed to induce a
confession out of trickery. . . .
“The accused is placed in a line-up, but this time he is
identified by several fictitious witnesses or victims who
associated him with different offenses. It is expected that
the subject will become desperate and confess to the of-
fense under investigation in order to escape from the
false accusations.”
The manuals also contain instructions for police on how
to handle the individual who refuses to discuss the matter
entirely, or who asks for an attorney or relatives. The exam-
iner is to concede him the right to remain silent. “This usu-
ally has a very undermining effect. First of all, he is
disappointed in his expectation of an unfavorable reaction
on the part of the interrogator. Secondly, a concession of
this right to remain silent impresses the subject with the ap-
parent fairness of his interrogator.” After this psychological
conditioning, however, the officer is told to point out the in-
criminating significance of the suspect’s refusal to talk:
“Joe, you have a right to remain silent. That’s your privi-
lege and I’m the last person in the world who’ll try to take
it away from you. If that’s the way you want to leave this,
O. K. But let me ask you this. Suppose you were in my
shoes and I were in yours and you called me in to ask me
about this and I told you, ‘I don’t want to answer any of
your questions.’You’d think I had something to hide, and
you’d probably be right in thinking that. That’s exactly
what I’ll have to think about you, and so will everybody
else. So let’s sit here and talk this whole thing over.”
Few will persist in their initial refusal to talk, it is said, if this
monologue is employed correctly.
In the event that the subject wishes to speak to a relative
or an attorney, the following advice is tendered:
“[T]he interrogator should respond by suggesting that the
subject first tell the truth to the interrogator himself rather
than get anyone else involved in the matter. If the request
is for an attorney, the interrogator may suggest that the
subject save himself or his family the expense of any
such professional service, particularly if he is innocent of
the offense under investigation. The interrogator may
also add, ‘Joe, I’m only looking for the truth, and if you’re
telling the truth, that’s it.You can handle this by yourself.’ ”
From these representative samples of interrogation tech-
niques, the setting prescribed by the manuals and observed
in practice becomes clear. In essence, it is this: To be alone
with the subject is essential to prevent distraction and to de-
prive him of any outside support. The aura of confidence in
his guilt undermines his will to resist.He merely confirms the
preconceived story the police seek to have him describe.
Patience and persistence, at times relentless questioning,
are employed. To obtain a confession, the interrogator must
“patiently maneuver himself or his quarry into a position
from which the desired objective may be attained.” When
normal procedures fail to produce the needed result, the po-
lice may resort to deceptive stratagems such as giving false
legal advice. It is important to keep the subject off balance,
for example, by trading on his insecurity about himself or his
surroundings. The police then persuade, trick, or cajole him
out of exercising his constitutional rights.
. . .
In the cases before us today, given this background, we
concern ourselves primarily with this interrogation atmos-
phere and the evils it can bring. In Miranda v. Arizona, the
police arrested the defendant and took him to a special
interrogation room where they secured a confession. In Vi-
gnera v. New York, the defendant made oral admissions to
the police after interrogation in the afternoon, and then
signed an inculpatory statement upon being questioned by
an assistant district attorney later the same evening. In
Westover v. United States, the defendant was handed over
to the Federal Bureau of Investigation by local authorities af-
ter they had detained and interrogated him for a lengthy pe-
riod, both at night and the following morning. After some two
hours of questioning, the federal officers had obtained
signed statements from the defendant. Lastly, in California
v. Stewart, the local police held the defendant five days in
the station and interrogated him on nine separate occasions
before they secured his inculpatory statement.
. . .
It is obvious that such an interrogation environment is cre-
ated for no purpose other than to subjugate the individual to
the will of his examiner.This atmosphere carries its own badge
of intimidation.To be sure, this is not physical intimidation, but
it is equally destructive of human dignity.The current practice
of incommunicado interrogation is at odds with one of our Na-
tion’s most cherished principles—that the individual may not
be compelled to incriminate himself. Unless adequate protec-
tive devices are employed to dispel the compulsion inherent in
custodial surroundings, no statement obtained from the de-
fendant can truly be the product of his free choice.
. . .
II.
We sometimes forget how long it has taken to establish the
privilege against self-incrimination, the sources from which
it came and the fervor with which it was defended. Its roots
go back into ancient times. Perhaps the critical historical
event shedding light on its origins and evolution was the trial
of one John Lilburn, a vocal anti–Stuart Leveller, who was
made to take the Star Chamber Oath in 1637. The oath
would have bound him to answer to all questions posed to
him on any subject.The Trial of John Lilburn and John Whar-
ton, 3 How. St.Tr. 1315 (1637). He resisted the oath and de-
claimed the proceedings, stating:
“Another fundamental right I then contended for, was,
that no man’s conscience ought to be racked by oaths

CHAPTER 10
imposed, to answer to questions concerning himself in
matters criminal, or pretended to be so.” Haller & Davies,
The Leveller Tracts 1647–1653, p. 454 (1944).
On account of the Lilburn Trial, Parliament abolished
the inquisitorial Court of Star Chamber and went further in
giving him generous reparation. The lofty principles to
which Lilburn had appealed during his trial gained popular
acceptance in England. These sentiments worked their
way over to the Colonies and were implanted after great
struggle into the Bill of Rights.Those who framed our Con-
stitution and the Bill of Rights were ever aware of subtle
encroachments on individual liberty. They knew that “ille-
gitimate and unconstitutional practices get their first foot-
ing . . . by silent approaches and slight deviations from
legal modes of procedure.” Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S.
616, 635 (1886). The privilege was elevated to constitu-
tional status and has always been “as broad as the mis-
chief against which it seeks to guard.” Counselman v.
Hitchcock, 142 U.S. 547, 562 (1892). We cannot depart
from this noble heritage.
Thus we may view the historical development of the privi-
lege as one which groped for the proper scope of governmen-
tal power over the citizen. As a “noble principle often
transcends its origins,” the privilege has come rightfully to be
recognized in part as an individual’s substantive right, a “right
to a private enclave where he may lead a private life.That right
is the hallmark of our democracy.” United States v.Grunewald,
233 F.2d 556, 579, 581–582 (Frank, J., dissenting), rev’d, 353
U.S. 391 (1957). We have recently noted that the privilege
against self-incrimination—the essential mainstay of our ad-
versary system—is founded on a complex of values, Murphy
v.Waterfront Comm’n, 378 U.S. 52, 55–57, n. 5 (1964); Tehan
v.Shott, 382 U.S.406, 414–415, n.12 (1966).All these policies
point to one overriding thought: the constitutional foundation
underlying the privilege is the respect a government—state or
federal—must accord to the dignity and integrity of its citizens.
To maintain a “fair state-individual balance,” to require the gov-
ernment “to shoulder the entire load,” 8 Wigmore, Evidence
317 (McNaughton rev. 1961), to respect the inviolability of the
human personality, our accusatory system of criminal justice
demands that the government seeking to punish an individual
produce the evidence against him by its own independent
labors, rather than by the cruel, simple expedient of compelling
it from his own mouth. Chambers v. Florida, 309 U.S. 227,
235–238 (1940).In sum, the privilege is fulfilled only when the
person is guaranteed the right “to remain silent unless he
chooses to speak in the unfettered exercise of his own will.”
Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1, 8 (1964).
The question in these cases is whether the privilege is
fully applicable during a period of custodial interrogation. In
this Court, the privilege has consistently been accorded a lib-
eral construction. Albertson v. SACB, 382 U.S. 70, 81 (1965);
Hoffman v. United States, 341 U.S. 479, 486 (1951); Arnd-
stein v. McCarthy, 254 U.S. 71, 72–73 (1920); Counselman v.
Hitchcock, 142 U.S. 547, 562 (1892).We are satisfied that all
the principles embodied in the privilege apply to informal
compulsion exerted by law-enforcement officers during in-
custody questioning. An individual swept from familiar sur-
roundings into police custody, surrounded by antagonistic
forces, and subjected to the techniques of persuasion de-
scribed above cannot be otherwise than under compulsion to
speak. As a practical matter, the compulsion to speak in the
isolated setting of the police station may well be greater than
in courts or other official investigations, where there are often
impartial observers to guard against intimidation or trickery.
. . . In addition to the expansive historical development of
the privilege and the sound policies which have nurtured its
evolution, judicial precedent thus clearly establishes its
application to incommunicado interrogation. In fact, the Gov-
ernment concedes this point as well established in Westover
v. United States, stating:“We have no doubt . . . that it is pos-
sible for a suspect’s Fifth Amendment right to be violated dur-
ing in-custody questioning by a law-enforcement officer.”
Because of the adoption by Congress of Rule 5 (a) of the
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and this Court’s effec-
tuation of that Rule in McNabb v.United States, 318 U.S.332
(1943), and Mallory v. United States, 354 U.S. 449 (1957),
we have had little occasion in the past quarter century to
reach the constitutional issues in dealing with federal inter-
rogations. These supervisory rules, requiring production of
an arrested person before a commissioner “without unnec-
essary delay” and excluding evidence obtained in default of
that statutory obligation, were nonetheless responsive to the
same considerations of Fifth Amendment policy that un-
avoidably face us now as to the States.In McNabb, 318 U.S.,
at 343–344, and in Mallory, 354 U.S., at 455–456, we rec-
ognized both the dangers of interrogation and the appropri-
ateness of prophylaxis stemming from the very fact of
interrogation itself.
Our decision in Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1 (1964), ne-
cessitates an examination of the scope of the privilege in
state cases as well. In Malloy, we squarely held the privilege
applicable to the States, and held that the substantive stan-
dards underlying the privilege applied with full force to state
court proceedings.There, as in Murphy v.Waterfront Comm’n,
378 U.S. 52 (1964), and Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609
(1965), we applied the existing Fifth Amendment standards
to the case before us.
. . .
III.
Today, then, there can be no doubt that the Fifth Amendment
privilege is available outside of criminal court proceedings
and serves to protect persons in all settings in which their
freedom of action is curtailed in any significant way from
being compelled to incriminate themselves. We have con-
cluded that without proper safeguards the process of in-
custody interrogation of persons suspected or accused of
crime contains inherently compelling pressures which work
to undermine the individual’s will to resist and to compel him
to speak where he would not otherwise do so freely. In order
to combat these pressures and to permit a full opportunity

Confessions and Pretrial Identification Procedures
■373
to exercise the privilege against self-incrimination, the ac-
cused must be adequately and effectively apprised of his
rights and the exercise of those rights must be fully honored.
. . .
At the outset, if a person in custody is to be subjected to
interrogation, he must first be informed in clear and unequiv-
ocal terms that he has the right to remain silent.For those un-
aware of the privilege, the warning is needed simply to make
them aware of it—the threshold requirement for an intelligent
decision as to its exercise. More important, such a warning is
an absolute prerequisite in overcoming the inherent pres-
sures of the interrogation atmosphere. It is not just the sub-
normal or woefully ignorant who succumb to an interrogator’s
imprecations, whether implied or expressly stated, that the
interrogation will continue until a confession is obtained or
that silence in the face of accusation is itself damning and will
bode ill when presented to a jury. Further, the warning will
show the individual that his interrogators are prepared to
recognize his privilege should he choose to exercise it.
. . .
The warning of the right to remain silent must be accom-
panied by the explanation that anything said can and will be
used against the individual in court. This warning is needed
in order to make him aware not only of the privilege, but also
of the consequences of forgoing it. It is only through an
awareness of these consequences that there can be any
assurance of real understanding and intelligent exercise of
the privilege. Moreover, this warning may serve to make the
individual more acutely aware that he is faced with a phase
of the adversary system—that he is not in the presence of
persons acting solely in his interest.
The circumstances surrounding in-custody interrogation
can operate very quickly to overbear the will of one merely
made aware of his privilege by his interrogators. Therefore,
the right to have counsel present at the interrogation is indis-
pensable to the protection of the Fifth Amendment privilege
under the system we delineate today.Our aim is to assure that
the individual’s right to choose between silence and speech
remains unfettered throughout the interrogation process. A
once-stated warning, delivered by those who will conduct the
interrogation, cannot itself suffice to that end among those
who most require knowledge of their rights. A mere warning
given by the interrogators is not alone sufficient to accomplish
that end. . . . Thus, the need for counsel to protect the Fifth
Amendment privilege comprehends not merely a right to con-
sult with counsel prior to questioning, but also to have coun-
sel present during any questioning if the defendant so desires.
The presence of counsel at the interrogation may serve
several significant subsidiary functions as well.If the accused
decides to talk to his interrogators, the assistance of counsel
can mitigate the dangers of untrustworthiness.With a lawyer
present the likelihood that the police will practice coercion is
reduced, and if coercion is nevertheless exercised the lawyer
can testify to it in court. The presence of a lawyer can also
help to guarantee that the accused gives a fully accurate
statement to the police and that the statement is rightly re-
ported by the prosecution at trial. See Crooker v. California,
357 U.S. 433, 443–448 (1958) (Douglas, J., dissenting).
. . .
Accordingly we hold that an individual held for interroga-
tion must be clearly informed that he has the right to consult
with a lawyer and to have the lawyer with him during interro-
gation under the system for protecting the privilege we delin-
eate today. As with the warnings of the right to remain silent
and that anything stated can be used in evidence against him,
this warning is an absolute prerequisite to interrogation. . . .
If an individual indicates that he wishes the assistance
of counsel before any interrogation occurs, the authorities
cannot rationally ignore or deny his request on the basis
that the individual does not have or cannot afford a re-
tained attorney.The financial ability of the individual has no
relationship to the scope of the rights involved here. The
privilege against self-incrimination secured by the Consti-
tution applies to all individuals. The need for counsel in or-
der to protect the privilege exists for the indigent as well as
the affluent. . . .
In order fully to apprise a person interrogated of the ex-
tent of his rights under this system then, it is necessary to
warn him not only that he has the right to consult with an at-
torney, but also that if he is indigent, a lawyer will be ap-
pointed to represent him. Without this additional warning,
the admonition of the right to consult with counsel would of-
ten be understood as meaning only that he can consult with
a lawyer if he has one or has the funds to obtain one. The
warning of a right to counsel would be hollow if not couched
in terms that would convey to the indigent—the person most
often subjected to interrogation—the knowledge that he too
has a right to have counsel present. As with the warnings of
the right to remain silent and of the general right to counsel,
only by effective and express explanation to the indigent of
this right can there be assurance that he was truly in a posi-
tion to exercise it.
Once warnings have been given, the subsequent proce-
dure is clear. If the individual indicates in any manner, at any
time prior to or during questioning, that he wishes to remain
silent, the interrogation must cease. . . .
. . .
If the interrogation continues without the presence of an
attorney and a statement is taken, a heavy burden rests on
the government to demonstrate that the defendant know-
ingly and intelligently waived his privilege against self-
incrimination and his right to retained or appointed
counsel. Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U.S. 478, 490, n. 14.This
Court has always set high standards of proof for the waiver
of constitutional rights, Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458
(1938), and we re-assert these standards as applied to in-
custody interrogation. Since the State is responsible for
establishing the isolated circumstances under which the
interrogation takes place and has the only means of mak-
ing available corroborated evidence of warnings given dur-
ing incommunicado interrogation, the burden is rightly on
its shoulders.

374
■
CHAPTER 10
An express statement that the individual is willing to
make a statement and does not want an attorney followed
closely by a statement could constitute a waiver. But a valid
waiver will not be presumed simply from the silence of the
accused after warnings are given or simply from the fact that
a confession was in fact eventually obtained. . . .
Whatever the testimony of the authorities as to waiver of
rights by an accused, the fact of lengthy interrogation or in-
communicado incarceration before a statement is made is
strong evidence that the accused did not validly waive his
rights. In these circumstances the fact that the individual
eventually made a statement is consistent with the conclu-
sion that the compelling influence of the interrogation finally
forced him to do so. It is inconsistent with any notion of a vol-
untary relinquishment of the privilege. Moreover, any evi-
dence that the accused was threatened, tricked, or cajoled
into a waiver will, of course, show that the defendant did not
voluntarily waive his privilege. The requirement of warnings
and waiver of rights is a fundamental with respect to the
Fifth Amendment privilege and not simply a preliminary rit-
ual to existing methods of interrogation.
The warnings required and the waiver necessary in ac-
cordance with our opinion today are, in the absence of a
fully effective equivalent, prerequisites to the admissibility of
any statement made by a defendant. . . .
The principles announced today deal with the protec-
tion which must be given to the privilege against self-
incrimination when the individual is first subjected to police
interrogation while in custody at the station or otherwise
deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way. It
is at this point that our adversary system of criminal pro-
ceedings commences. . . .
Our decision is not intended to hamper the traditional
function of police officers in investigating crime. See Es-
cobedo v. Illinois, 378 U.S. 478, 492. When an individual is
in custody on probable cause, the police may, of course,
seek out evidence in the field to be used at trial against him.
Such investigation may include inquiry of persons not under
restraint. General on-the-scene questioning as to facts sur-
rounding a crime or other general questioning of citizens in
the fact-finding process is not affected by our holding. It is
an act of responsible citizenship for individuals to give what-
ever information they may have to aid in law enforcement.
In such situations the compelling atmosphere inherent in
the process of in-custody interrogation is not necessarily
present.
In dealing with statements obtained through interroga-
tion, we do not purport to find all confessions inadmissible.
Confessions remain a proper element in law enforcement.
Any statement given freely and voluntarily without any com-
pelling influences is, of course, admissible in evidence. . . .
Volunteered statements of any kind are not barred by the
Fifth Amendment and their admissibility is not affected by
our holding today.
To summarize, we hold that when an individual is taken
into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom by the au-
thorities in any significant way and is subjected to question-
ing, the privilege against self-incrimination is jeopardized.
Procedural safeguards must be employed to protect the priv-
ilege, and unless other fully effective means are adopted to
notify the person of his right of silence and to assure that the
exercise of the right will be scrupulously honored, the follow-
ing measures are required. He must be warned prior to any
questioning that he has the right to remain silent, that anything
he says can be used against him in a court of law, that he has
the right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he cannot
afford an attorney one will be appointed for him prior to any
questioning if he so desires. Opportunity to exercise these
rights must be afforded to him throughout the interrogation.
After such warnings have been given, and such opportunity
afforded him, the individual may knowingly and intelligently
waive these rights and agree to answer questions or make a
statement.But unless and until such warnings and waiver are
demonstrated by the prosecution at trial, no evidence ob-
tained as a result of interrogation can be used against him.
IV.
. . .
If the individual desires to exercise his privilege, he has
the right to do so.This is not for the authorities to decide. An
attorney may advise his client not to talk to police until he has
had an opportunity to investigate the case, or he may wish to
be present with his client during any police questioning. In
doing so an attorney is merely exercising the good profes-
sional judgment he has been taught. This is not cause for
considering the attorney a menace to law enforcement.He is
merely carrying out what he is sworn to do under his oath—
to protect to the extent of his ability the rights of his client. In
fulfilling this responsibility the attorney plays a vital role in the
administration of criminal justice under our Constitution.
In announcing these principles, we are not unmindful of
the burdens which law enforcement officials must bear, of-
ten under trying circumstances. We also fully recognize the
obligation of all citizens to aid in enforcing the criminal laws.
This Court, while protecting individual rights, has always
given ample latitude to law enforcement agencies in the le-
gitimate exercise of their duties. . . .
V.
Because of the nature of the problem and because of its re-
current significance in numerous cases, we have to this point
discussed the relationship of the Fifth Amendment privilege
to police interrogation without specific concentration on the
facts of the cases before us. We turn now to these facts. . . .
No. 759. Miranda v. Arizona.
On March 13, 1963, petitioner, Ernesto Miranda, was ar-
rested at his home and taken in custody to a Phoenix po-
lice station. He was there identified by the complaining
witness. The police then took him to “Interrogation Room

Confessions and Pretrial Identification Procedures
■375
No. 2” of the detective bureau. There he was questioned by
two police officers. The officers admitted at trial that Mi-
randa was not advised that he had a right to have an attor-
ney present. Two hours later, the officers emerged from the
interrogation room with a written confession signed by Mi-
randa. At the top of the statement was a typed paragraph
stating that the confession was made voluntarily, without
threats or promises of immunity and “with full knowledge of
my legal rights, understanding any statement I make may
be used against me.”
At his trial before a jury, the written confession was ad-
mitted into evidence over the objection of defense counsel,
and the officers testified to the prior oral confession made by
Miranda during the interrogation.Miranda was found guilty of
kidnapping and rape. He was sentenced to 20 to 30 years’
imprisonment on each count, the sentences to run concur-
rently.On appeal, the Supreme Court of Arizona held that Mi-
randa’s constitutional rights were not violated in obtaining the
confession and affirmed the conviction. 98 Ariz. 18, 401 P. 2d
721. In reaching its decision, the court emphasized heavily
the fact that Miranda did not specifically request counsel.
We reverse. From the testimony of the officers and by the
admission of respondent, it is clear that Miranda was not in
any way apprised of his right to consult with an attorney and
to have one present during the interrogation, nor was his
right not to be compelled to incriminate himself effectively
protected in any other manner. Without these warnings the
statements were inadmissible.The mere fact that he signed
a statement which contained a typed-in clause stating that
he had “full knowledge” of his “legal rights” does not ap-
proach the knowing and intelligent waiver required to relin-
quish constitutional rights.
. . .
Therefore, in accordance with the foregoing, the judg-
ments of the Supreme Court of Arizona in No.759, of the New
York Court of Appeals in No.760, and of the Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit in No. 761 are reversed.The judgment of
the Supreme Court of California in No. 584 is affirmed.
It is so ordered.
Mr. Justice CLARK, dissenting. . . .
. . . [I cannot] join in the Court’s criticism of the present
practices of police and investigatory agencies as to custo-
dial interrogation.The materials it refers to as “police manu-
als” are, as I read them, merely writings in this field by
professors and some police officers. Not one is shown by
the record here to be the official manual of any police de-
partment, much less in universal use in crime detection.
Moreover, the examples of police brutality mentioned by the
Court are rare exceptions to the thousands of cases that ap-
pear every year in the law reports. . . .
I.
. . . Since there is at this time a paucity of information and an
almost total lack of empirical knowledge on the practical op-
eration of requirements truly comparable to those an-
nounced by the majority, I would be more restrained lest we
go too far too fast.
II.
. . .
Rather than employing the arbitrary Fifth Amendment
rule which the Court lays down I would follow the more pli-
able dictates of the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and
Fourteenth Amendments which we are accustomed to ad-
ministering and which we know from our cases are effec-
tive
instruments
in
protecting
persons
in
police
custody. . . .
In each of those cases I find from the circumstances no
warrant for reversal. . . .
Mr. Justice HARLAN, whom Mr. Justice STEWART and Mr.
Justice WHITE join, dissenting.
I believe the decision of the Court represents poor con-
stitutional law and entails harmful consequences for the
country at large. . . .
While the fine points of this scheme are far less clear
than the Court admits, the tenor is quite apparent. The new
rules are not designed to guard against police brutality or
other unmistakably banned forms of coercion. Those who
use third-degree tactics and deny them in court are equally
able and destined to lie as skillfully about warnings and
waivers. Rather, the thrust of the new rules is to negate all
pressures, to reinforce the nervous or ignorant suspect, and
ultimately to discourage any confession at all. The aim in
short is toward “voluntariness” in a utopian sense, or to view
it from a different angle, voluntariness with a vengeance.
To incorporate this notion into the Constitution requires a
strained reading of history and precedent and a disregard of
the very pragmatic concerns that alone may on occasion jus-
tify such strains. I believe that reasoned examination will
show that the Due Process Clauses provide an adequate tool
for coping with confessions and that, even if the Fifth Amend-
ment privilege against self-incrimination be invoked, its
precedents taken as a whole do not sustain the present rules.
. . .
What the Court largely ignores is that its rules impair, if
they will not eventually serve wholly to frustrate, an instru-
ment of law enforcement that has long and quite reasonably
been thought worth the price paid for it. There can be little
doubt that the Court’s new code would markedly decrease
the number of confessions.To warn the suspect that he may
remain silent and remind him that his confession may be
used in court are minor obstructions. To require also an ex-
press waiver by the suspect and an end to questioning
whenever he demurs must heavily handicap questioning.
And to suggest or provide counsel for the suspect simply in-
vites the end of the interrogation. . . .
. . .
In closing this necessarily truncated discussion of policy
considerations attending the new confession rules, some
reference must be made to their ironic untimeliness. There

376
■
CHAPTER 10
is now in progress in this country a massive reexamination
of criminal law enforcement procedures on a scale never
before witnessed. . . .
It is no secret that concern has been expressed lest long-
range and lasting reforms be frustrated by this Court’s too
rapid departure from existing constitutional standards. . . .
Of course legislative reform is rarely speedy or unanimous,
though this Court has been more patient in the past. But the
legislative reforms when they come would have the vast ad-
vantage of empirical data and comprehensive study, they
would allow experimentation and use of solutions not open
to the courts, and they would restore the initiative in criminal
law reform to those forums where it truly belongs. . . .
Mr. Justice WHITE, with whom Mr. Justice HARLAN and Mr.
Justice STEWART join, dissenting.
. . .
That the Court’s holding today is neither compelled nor
even strongly suggested by the language of the Fifth
Amendment, is at odds with American and English legal
history, and involves a departure from a long line of
precedent does not prove either that the Court has ex-
ceeded its powers or that the Court is wrong or unwise in
its present reinterpretation of the Fifth Amendment. It
does, however, underscore the obvious—that the Court
has not discovered or found the law in making today’s de-
cision, nor has it derived it from some irrefutable sources;
what it has done is to make new law and new public pol-
icy in much the same way that it has in the course of in-
terpreting other great clauses of the Constitution. This is
what the Court historically has done. Indeed, it is what it
must do and will continue to do until and unless there is
some fundamental change in the constitutional distribu-
tion of governmental powers.
But if the Court is here and now to announce new and
fundamental policy to govern certain aspects of our affairs,
it is wholly legitimate to examine the mode of this or any
other constitutional decision in this Court and to inquire into
the advisability of its end product in terms of the long-range
interest of the country. At the very least the Court’s text and
reasoning should withstand analysis and be a fair exposi-
tion of the constitutional provision which its opinion inter-
prets. Decisions like these cannot rest alone on syllogism,
metaphysics or some ill-defined notions of natural justice,
although each will perhaps play its part. . . .
. . . Insofar as appears from the Court’s opinion, it has not
examined a single transcript of any police interrogation, let
alone the interrogation that took place in any one of these
cases which it decides today. Judged by any of the stan-
dards for empirical investigation utilized in the social sci-
ences the factual basis for the Court’s premise is patently
inadequate.
. . .
Even if one were to postulate that the Court’s concern is
not that all confessions induced by police interrogation are
coerced but rather that some such confessions are coerced
and present judicial procedures are believed to be inade-
quate to identify the confessions that are coerced and those
that are not, it would still not be essential to impose the rule
that the Court has now fashioned. Transcripts or observers
could be required, specific time limits, tailored to fit the
cause, could be imposed, or other devices could be utilized
to reduce the chances that otherwise indiscernible coercion
will produce an inadmissible confession.
. . .
Criticism of the Court’s opinion, however, cannot stop with a
demonstration that the factual and textual bases for the rule
it propounds are, at best, less than compelling. Equally rele-
vant is an assessment of the rule’s consequences measured
against community values. . . . More than the human dignity
of the accused is involved; the human personality of others
in the society must also be preserved. Thus the values re-
flected by the privilege are not the sole desideratum; soci-
ety’s interest in the general security is of equal weight.
. . . For all these reasons, if further restrictions on police
interrogation are desirable at this time, a more flexible ap-
proach makes much more sense than the Court’s constitu-
tional straitjacket which forecloses more discriminating
treatment by legislative or rule-making pronouncements.
Applying the traditional standards to the cases before the
Court, I would hold these confessions voluntary.
B.
MIRANDA
Understanding Miranda is critical because it aggressively protects a citizen’s right
against self-incrimination by focusing on the inherent coerciveness of police interro-
gation practices, and because it has been the law on confessions for forty years. The
decision has survived criticism, some judicial erosion, and threat of reversal, only to
be reaffirmed with some continuing vitality. Cutting to its essentials, Miranda pro-
vides the following rules:
1.
Absent equally effective safeguards, police must inform people of their
continuing right to silence in order to protect the right against self-
incrimination.
2.
The rules apply when persons are interrogated in custody at the station or
otherwise significantly deprived of their freedom of action.

Confessions and Pretrial Identification Procedures
■377
confession:
the defendant’s acknowledg-
ment of guilt.
3.
Prior to such interrogation, persons must be informed clearly (a) of their
right to remain silent, (b) that any statement can be used against them in
court, (c) of their right to an attorney who can be present at questioning, and
(d) if they are indigent, that the court will provide them with an attorney.
4.
Interrogation must cease at any time the suspect elects to remain silent or
requests an attorney.
5.
If a statement is made when there is no attorney present, the statement is
presumed coerced for all practical purposes, and the state has a heavy
burden of proving that any waiver to remain silent or to the presence of a
lawyer was made knowingly and intelligently (voluntarily).
6.
A violation of these rules means a statement will not be admitted into
evidence.
7.
Both confessions and admissions are protected. A confession is the
defendant’s acknowledgment of guilt, for example, “I did it.” An admission
is the defendant’s acknowledgment of a fact that helps prove the crime but
does not reach the level of a confession, for example, “I was there.”
8.
Finally, because the exercise of the privilege is a right, the prosecution may
not, by innuendo or otherwise, call the jury’s attention to the fact that the
defendant has remained silent. Such a comment raises the inference that an
innocent person has nothing to hide and seriously undermines the
purpose of the privilege and drains it of its strength.
Because many people do not understand that the decision reinforces the consti-
tutionalization of the accusatory system of justice, the decision has been heavily crit-
icized for purportedly putting law enforcement in a “straitjacket.” Empirical studies
show, however, that the rate of useable confessions after Miranda is relatively un-
changed from the rate of confessions before Miranda.3 Other studies have shown that
confessions are the key to conviction in relatively few prosecutions and, thus, are
overrated in the scheme of effective law enforcement.4
A federal law (18 U.S.C. § 3501) that attempted to weaken the constitutionally
mandated Miranda warnings was declared unconstitutional in Dickerson v. U.S. (2000).
C.
ISSUES MIRANDA LEFT UNANSWERED
1.
In Custody
Miranda applies when persons are interrogated in custody or otherwise significantly
deprived of their freedom of action. Since Miranda, the Court has tried to define “in
custody.” In Orozco v. Texas (1969), the suspect was confronted in his bedroom at 4:00
A.M. by several police officers who testified that they believed the suspect was under
arrest when he was questioned. The Court ruled that for purposes of Miranda the sus-
pect was “in custody.” Toward the other end of the spectrum, the Court decided that
if a suspect voluntarily responds to a written request to come into the police station
and believes he or she is free to leave the station, the suspect is not “in custody,” even
if the intention of the officer is to arrest the suspect [Oregon v. Mathiason (1977)].
In Berkemer v. McCarty (1984) and subsequently in Thompson v. Keohane (1995), the
Supreme Court articulated an objective standard to guide police and courts in deter-
mining when an interrogation is custodial and requires Miranda warnings. The Court
said in Keohane that a court must: 1. consider the circumstances surrounding the in-
terrogation, and 2. determine whether a reasonable person would have felt at liberty
to leave. In other words, the court should look at the impact on the suspect of the tim-
ing, location, and duration of the interrogation, the number of police present, the pres-
ence of weapons, and other factors to determine how coercive the circumstances were.
In Berkemer, questioning a driver about the use of intoxicants during a routine traf-
fic stop was not an “in custody situation,” even though the officer intended to arrest the
suspect. In Kaupp v. Texas (2003) the Court concluded that a reasonable person would not
have felt free to leave when three officers roused Kaupp from bed at 3 A.M., saying, “We
admission:
the defendant’s acknowledg-
ment of a fact that helps
prove the crime but does not
reach the level of a confes-
sion.

378
■
CHAPTER 10
need to talk,” then took him from home in handcuffs, without shoes, in his underwear,
in January, into a squad car, to the crime scene, and then to the police station. Although
the Court was determining if the Fourth Amendment applied, the application of the “feel
free to leave standard” to the facts of the case is instructive. In Yarborough v. Alvarado
(2004), the Court held that age (17 years old) was not relevant in determining if the in-
terrogation was custodial for Miranda purposes. Alvarado was taken out of school by his
parents who accompanied him to the police station where he was questioned without
his parents present. The Court said this was a close call, but found that a reasonable per-
son would have felt free to leave, so the interrogation was not custodial.
2.
Interrogation
At what point does police conduct or speech become “interrogation” and invoke the
Miranda rules? Walk-in, phoned-in, or even in custody statements, if “volunteered,”
are admissible. Once an incriminating statement is volunteered, then relevant follow-
up questions are permissible. The “functional equivalent” of questioning, that is, po-
lice action that leads one to conclude that the action is intended to elicit an
incriminating response, is “interrogation” [Rhode Island v. Innis (1980)]. Under this rul-
ing, having a defendant look at gory photos of a murder victim or read the confession
of a codefendant would be interrogation.
With this in mind, do you think it is “interrogation” for two police officers, in the
presence of an arrestee, to discuss the fact that until the robbery weapon was found,
it posed a threat to local schoolchildren, to which the defendant responded by show-
ing them the gun’s location? The Supreme Court said such a discussion was not in-
terrogation in Innis. Permitting the wife of a murder suspect to talk with him while a
tape recorder and officer were conspicuously present was not interrogation in Arizona
v. Mauro (1987). Likewise, it was not interrogation for an undercover agent planted in
a suspect’s jail cell to suggest they break out and then ask, “Have you ever killed any-
one before?” [Illinois v. Perkins (1990).] Note that the question came before any Mi-
randa warnings and prior to any exercising of the right to counsel, but the Court ruled
that the jail setting was not a police dominated atmosphere. Several other Supreme
Court decisions address the use of undercover agents placed in cells with defendants.
Though these cases seem to raise a question about interrogation, they have been de-
cided on the issue of whether the defendant was denied the right to counsel. These
cases are mentioned again later in this chapter.
3.
Incomplete or Delayed Warning
The Supreme Court said in California v. Prysock (1981) that minor deviations in word-
ing from the warning stated in Miranda are not significant. Some courts, however, find
that the failure of an officer to advise an indigent defendant that the cost of an ap-
pointed attorney will be paid by the state makes the confession illegal [Thompson v.
State (Fla. 1992)].
Police need to be careful when giving Miranda warnings in a foreign language.
Failure of the state to prove that a foreign language Miranda warning was legally suf-
ficient requires suppression of any incriminating statement [State v. Santiago (Wis.
1996), People v. Mejia-Mendoza (Colo. 2000), and Commonwealth v. Sanchez (Ky. App.
2003)]. Presumably, the results would be the same regarding warnings to deaf persons.
It is still not entirely clear whether Miranda applies to a witness who can be com-
pelled to testify at a grand jury hearing. More state and federal courts have said that
it does not than have said it does. The Supreme Court has not dealt with the issue di-
rectly. In U.S. v. Washington (1977), however, the Court held that when a “witness” is
informed of the right to remain silent, the absence of a warning that any incriminat-
ing statements can lead to indictment does not require the suppression of such state-
ments at a subsequent trial on the charge. Also keep in mind that there is no
constitutional right to counsel at a grand jury hearing, because no criminal (punitive)
proceedings have been started.
“Confess and be hanged.”

Jew of Malta, 1589

Confessions and Pretrial Identification Procedures
■379
A potentially significant exception to Miranda, called the “public safety” excep-
tion, was stated in New York v. Quarles (1984). A suspect was confronted in a super-
market by four police officers with drawn weapons. They searched him, discovered
a shoulder holster, and handcuffed him. When an officer asked him where the gun
was, he indicated, “over there.” He was then formally arrested and given his Miranda
warnings, after which he made further admissions of guilt. The Court ruled that the
question about the gun was clearly “interrogation” and the defendant was clearly “in
custody,” but that the “public safety” concerns of the moment, in this case finding the
gun, overrode any failure to give the Miranda warnings.
What is the effect of failing to give the warnings, getting an admission, then giv-
ing the Miranda warnings and getting further admissions? Are the subsequent ad-
missions tainted because the suspect felt he had already confessed in what was,
unknown to him, an unusable confession? The Court said when the first statement,
though illegally obtained, is not given in a coercive setting, then any subsequent ad-
missions following Miranda warnings are valid. [Oregon v. Elstad (1985)]. If however,
the first interrogation takes place in a coercive setting (the police station) and the post-
warning interrogation follows in close proximity (20 minutes), the intended effect of
the warnings is negated, and the post-warning statement is not admissible [Missouri
v. Seibert, (2004)]. In Seibert the officer used a common strategy of deliberately delay-
ing giving the warnings to improve the chances of getting an initial confession. Once
he had the initial but illegal confession, he took a short break, then administered the
Miranda warnings, and elicited a repeat, presumably legal confession pursuant to El-
stad. The Court said the “question first strategy” did not “adequately and effectively”
advise the defendant of the real choice between talking and not talking. The practical
effect of the strategy was to make a defendant think silence was useless.
Failure to give Miranda warnings in a noncoercive setting (the felon’s home) does
not require the suppression of incriminating physical evidence (a gun), the location
of which was revealed in subsequent questioning [U.S. v. Patane (2004) (see item 5 in
this section)].
4.
Assertion, Waiver, and Subsequent Interrogation
A valid waiver is a prerequisite for an “in custody” statement to be admitted in court
as evidence. Absent counsel,
[i]f the individual indicates in any manner, at any time prior to or during questioning,
that he wishes to remain silent, the interrogation must cease. . . . If the interrogation
continues without the presence of an attorney and a statement is taken, a heavy
burden rests on the government to demonstrate that the defendant knowingly and
intelligently waived his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to . . .
counsel. . . . An express statement could constitute a waiver (emphasis added).
—(Miranda)
Even an express waiver can be invalid, such as one given by a youthful offender
with mental deficiencies who had to stand naked during questioning [U.S. v. Blocker
(D.C.D.C. 1973)]. Miranda states “a valid waiver will not be presumed simply from
the silence of the accused after warnings are given or simply from the fact that a con-
fession was . . . obtained.” Quoting Carnley v. Cochran (1962), the Miranda Court said,
“The record must show that an accused was offered counsel but intelligently and
understandably rejected the offer. Anything less is not a waiver.” Following warn-
ings, a waiver will not be inferred simply because the defendant answered some
questions [Tague v. Louisiana (1980)]. A voluntary waiver, however, may be inferred
if a suspect’s actions or words are clear [North Carolina v. Butler (1979)]. Police over-
reaching is the primary focus [Colorado v. Connelly (1986)] and, thus, waivers may be
invalid if achieved through threats, trickery, or promises. Here is a brief survey of
cases demonstrating how courts have applied these principles in specific factual con-
texts.
“Confession of our faults is
the next thing to innocency.”
—Publilius Syrus, Latin
writer, Sententiae, c. 43 B.C.

■
CHAPTER 10
1.
A confession was not rendered involuntary because police lied, telling the
suspect that his cosuspect had already confessed [Frazier v. Cupp (1969)].
2.
A suspect voluntarily waived his right by making oral statements, even
though he was under the mistaken belief that only written statements
could be used against him [State v. Adams (N.J. 1992)].
3.
An officer’s mention of the death penalty to a juvenile in a murder case
rendered the confession involuntary [Green v. State (Md. App. 1992)].
4.
The promise of leniency given to a suspect if the suspect passed a
polygraph test was improper inducement of a confession [U.S. v. Escamilla
(9th Cir. 1992)].
5.
An “I don’t know if I should have a lawyer” type of statement was not an
adequate waiver in U.S. v. Mendoza-Cecelia (11th Cir. 1992), and, therefore,
police should not have continued their questioning without a clearer
waiver. In Davis v. U.S. (1994), a waiver was followed by the suspect’s
statement, “Maybe I should talk with a lawyer.” The interrogator then
asked, “Are you asking for a lawyer?” The suspect answered, “No.” This
exchange was not so clear an invocation of the right to counsel as to
require the agents to stop their questioning, even though the defendant
later and more clearly exercised his right to counsel. The Davis Court also
refused to set a rule requiring interrogators to ask clarifying questions if
the suspect makes an ambiguous statement regarding the right to counsel.
In Ogle v. State (Ind. 1998), the Indiana Supreme Court ruled that once the defen-
dant has made a waiver, a significant interruption in the interrogation does not re-
quire new warnings.
Once the right to remain silent is invoked, a subsequent, proper waiver of that
right is valid. For example, after police ended the questioning of a suspect when he
invoked his right to silence, it was not a violation of the suspect’s right to silence for
another police officer to question the suspect several hours later about a different
crime, following warnings and a clear waiver [Michigan v. Mosley (1975)]. A guilty
plea and a court’s determination that the plea is voluntary is not a waiver of the priv-
ilege against self-incrimination, because statements by the defendant about what
happened could be used as a basis for a more severe sentence [Mitchell v. U.S. (1999)].
If an attorney tries to get in touch with a suspect who has waived rights, police
have no obligation to suspend questioning or to inform the suspect that an attorney
is waiting in the wings [Moran v. Burbine (1986)]. If the right to an attorney has been
asserted, even ambiguously, however, police may not resume interrogation. An ex-
ception to this rule exists when (1) a defendant initiates a new conversation and
(2) does so in a manner that suggests (note: not unequivocally) a desire to discuss the
matter further [Edwards v. Arizona (1981) and Mississippi v. Minnick (1990)]. Even if a
suspect is represented by a lawyer and even if they have consulted, another Supreme
Court case says police may initiate questioning on a different matter without the
lawyer being present [McNeil v. Wisconsin (1991)].
Although Miranda retains some vitality, it is clear that a more conservative
Supreme Court has substantially limited its far-reaching protections, particularly in
this area of waiver and subsequent interrogation by police.
5.
Miranda’s Scope: Settings, Circumstances, and Other Limitations
Miranda applies to traffic, tax, and any other matter that is or may lead to criminal or
punitive charges. It does not protect persons at competency, prison disciplinary, or
sexual offender hearings. Statements to third-party, nonpolice persons such as school
principals, private investigators, or victims are generally not protected. Statements to
psychiatrists in criminal proceedings, IRS agents, and possibly probation and social
workers may be protected when punitive repercussions are present.5 As mentioned
previously, Miranda does not allow suspects to avoid fingerprinting, writing samples,
lineups, and blood tests.

Confessions and Pretrial Identification Procedures
■381
In an attempt to define the scope of Miranda more clearly, the U.S. Supreme Court
addressed in Chavez v. Martinez (2003) whether failure to give Miranda warnings in a
significantly coercive circumstance is, of itself, a violation of the constitutional right
against self-incrimination.
CHAVEZ v. MARTINEZ
538 U.S. 760, 123 S.Ct. 1994 (2003).
Justice THOMAS. . . .
I.
During an altercation with the police, an officer shot Mar-
tinez five times, causing severe injuries that left him partially
blinded and paralyzed from the waist down. Chavez, a patrol
supervisor who had arrived on the scene a few minutes after
the shooting, accompanied Martinez to the hospital where he
questioned him while he was receiving treatment from medical
personnel.The questioning lasted a total of about 10 minutes
over a 45-minute period, with Chavez leaving the emergency
room from time to time to permit medical personnel to treat
Martinez. At no point during the exchange between Martinez
and Chavez was Martinez given the Miranda warnings.
At first Martinez’s responses to Chavez’s questions about
what had happened between him and the police were simply
“I don’t know,”“I am choking”or “My leg hurts.”Later, however,
Martinez admitted that he had taken a pistol from an officer’s
holster and pointed the weapon at him. On seven different
occasions, Martinez told the officer:“I am dying,”“I am dying,
please,” or “I don’t want to die, I don’t want to die,” but the
questioning continued.At one point, Martinez told the officer:
“I am not telling you anything until they [the doctors] treat me.”
But he continued to answer questions. According to a tape
recording, toward the end of questioning, the following ex-
change between Chavez and Martinez occurred:
Chavez: [Do] you think you are going to die?
Martinez: Aren’t you going to treat me or what?
Chavez: [That’s] all I want to know, if you think you’re go-
ing to die?
Martinez: My belly hurts, please treat me.
Chavez: Sir?
Martinez: If you treat me I tell you everything, if not, no.
Chavez: Sir, I want to know if you think you are going to
die right now?
Martinez: I think so.
Chavez: You think so? Ok, look, the doctors are going to
help you with all they can do, Ok? . . .
Martinez: Get moving, I am dying, can’t you see me?
Come on.
Chavez: Ah, huh, right now they are giving you med-
ication.
Although Martinez was never charged with a crime and
his answers were never used against him in any criminal
prosecution, he brought a § 1983 action, claiming that
Chavez had violated both his Fifth Amendment right not to
be “compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against
himself” and his Fourteenth Amendment due process right
to be free from coercive questioning. The Ninth Circuit
agreed with Martinez. It viewed the Fifth and Fourteenth
Amendment rights asserted by Martinez clearly established
by federal law, explaining that a reasonable police officer
“would have known that persistent interrogation of the sus-
pect despite repeated requests to stop violated the sus-
pect’s Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment right to be free from
coercive interrogation.”
II.
In deciding whether an officer is entitled to qualified im-
munity, we must first determine whether the officer’s alleged
conduct violated a constitutional right. If not, the officer is
entitled to qualified immunity, and we need not consider
whether the asserted right was “clearly established. . . .”
A
The Fifth Amendment made applicable to the States by
the Fourteenth Amendment, requires that “[n]o person . . .
shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness
against himself” (emphases added). We fail to see how,
based on the text of the Fifth Amendment, Martinez can al-
lege a violation of this right, since Martinez was never pros-
ecuted for a crime, let alone compelled to be a witness
against himself in a criminal case.
. . . Statements compelled by police interrogations of
course may not be used against a defendant at trial, but it is
not until their use in a criminal case that a violation of the Self-
Incrimination Clause occurs. [Although] conduct by law en-
forcement officials prior to trial may ultimately impair that
right, a constitutional violation occurs only at trial” (emphases
added);Withrow v.Williams, (describing the Fifth Amendment
as a “ ‘trial right’ ”); id. (O’Connor, J., concurring in part and
dissenting in part) (describing “true Fifth Amendment claims”
as “the extraction and use of compelled testimony” (em-
phases altered)).

382
■
CHAPTER 10
Here, Martinez was never made to be a “witness” against
himself in violation of the Fifth Amendment’s Self-Incrimination
Clause because his statements were never admitted as tes-
timony against him in a criminal case. Nor was he ever
placed under oath and exposed to “ ‘the cruel trilemma of
self-accusation, perjury or contempt.’ ” The text of the Self-
Incrimination Clause simply cannot support the Ninth Cir-
cuit’s view that the mere use of compulsive questioning,
without more, violates the Constitution.
Nor can the Ninth Circuit’s approach be reconciled with
our case law. It is well established that the government may
compel witnesses to testify at trial or before a grand jury, on
pain of contempt, so long as the witness is not the target of
the criminal case in which he testifies. Even for persons who
have a legitimate fear that their statements may subject
them to criminal prosecution, we have long permitted the
compulsion of incriminating testimony so long as those
statements (or evidence derived from those statements)
cannot be used against the speaker in any criminal
case. . . . Our holdings . . . demonstrate that, contrary to the
Ninth Circuit’s view, mere coercion does not violate the text
of the Self-Incrimination Clause absent use of the com-
pelled statements in a criminal case against the witness.
We fail to see how Martinez was any more “compelled in
any criminal case to be a witness against himself” than an
immunized witness forced to testify on pain of contempt.
. . .
In the Fifth Amendment context, we have created pro-
phylactic rules designed to safeguard the core constitutional
right protected by the Self-Incrimination Clause. . . . Be-
cause the failure to assert the privilege will often forfeit the
right to exclude the evidence in a subsequent “criminal
case,” [it] is necessary to allow assertion of the privilege
prior to the commencement of a “criminal case” to safeguard
the core Fifth Amendment trial right. . . .
Rules designed to safeguard a constitutional right, how-
ever, do not extend the scope of the constitutional right it-
self, just as violations of judicially crafted prophylactic rules
do not violate the constitutional rights of any person. . . .We
have likewise established the Miranda exclusionary rule as
a prophylactic measure to prevent violations of the right pro-
tected by the text of the Self-Incrimination Clause—the ad-
mission into evidence in criminal case of confessions
obtained through coercive custodial questioning. [Accord-
ingly,] Chavez’s failure to read Miranda warnings to Martinez
did not violate Martinez’s constitutional rights and cannot be
grounds for a § 1983 action. [The] Ninth Circuit’s view that
mere compulsion violates the Self-Incrimination Clause finds
no support in the text of the Fifth Amendment and is irrecon-
cilable with our case law. Because we find that Chavez’s al-
leged conduct did not violate the Self-Incrimination Clause,
we reverse the Ninth Circuit’s denial of qualified immunity as
to Martinez’s Fifth Amendment claim.
Our views on the proper scope of the Fifth Amendment’s
Self-Incrimination Clause do not mean that police torture or
other abuse that results in a confession is constitutionally
permissible so long as the statements are not used at trial;
it simply means that the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due
Process Clause, rather than the Fifth Amendment’s Self-
Incrimination Clause, would govern the inquiry in those
cases and provide relief in appropriate circumstances.
[Although] Rochin v. California did not establish a civil
remedy for abusive police behavior, we recognized in County
of Sacramento v. Lewis that deprivations of liberty caused by
“the most egregious official conduct” may violate the Due
Process Clause.While we rejected, in Lewis, a § 1983 plain-
tiff’s contention that a police officer’s deliberate indifference
during a high-speed chase that caused the death of a mo-
torcyclist violated due process, we left open the possibility
that unauthorized police behavior in other contexts might
“shock the conscience” and give rise to § 1983 liability.
We are satisfied that Chavez’s questioning did not
violate Martinez’s due process rights. Even assuming,
arguendo, that the persistent questioning of Martinez
somehow deprived him of a liberty interest, we cannot
agree with Martinez’s characterization of Chavez’s behav-
ior as “egregious” or “conscience shocking.” As we noted
in Lewis, the official conduct “most likely to rise to the
conscience-shocking level,” is the “conduct intended to in-
jure in some way unjustifiable by any government interest.”
Here, there is no evidence that Chavez acted with a pur-
pose to harm Martinez by intentionally interfering with his
medical treatment. Medical personnel were able to treat
Martinez throughout the interview and Chavez ceased his
questioning to allow tests and other procedures to be per-
formed. Nor is there evidence that Chavez’s conduct exac-
erbated Martinez’s injuries or prolonged his stay in the
hospital. Moreover, the need to investigate whether there
had been police misconduct constituted a justifiable gov-
ernment interest given the risk that key evidence would
have been lost if Martinez had died without the authorities
ever hearing his side of the story.
. . .[We] therefore must take into account the fact that Mar-
tinez was hospitalized and in severe pain during the interview,
but also that Martinez was a critical nonpolice witness to an
altercation resulting in a shooting by a police officer, and that
the situation was urgent given the perceived risk that Mar-
tinez might die and crucial evidence might be lost. In these
circumstances, we can find no basis in our prior jurispru-
dence [or] in our Nation’s history and traditions to suppose
that freedom from unwanted police questioning is a right so
fundamental that it cannot be abridged absent a “compelling
state interest.” We have never required such a justification for
a police interrogation, and we decline to do so here.The lack
of any “guideposts for responsible decisionmaking” in this
area, and our oft-stated reluctance to expand the doctrine of
substantive due process, further counsel against recognizing
a new “fundamental liberty interest” in this case.
We conclude that Martinez has failed to allege a violation
of the Fourteenth Amendment, and it is therefore unneces-
sary to inquire whether the right asserted by Martinez was
clearly established.

III.
Because Chavez did not violate Martinez’s Fifth and
Fourteenth Amendment rights, he was entitled to qualified
immunity.The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit is therefore reversed and the case is remanded for
further proceedings. . . .
Justice SOUTER, delivered an opinion, Part II of which is
the opinion of the Court, and Part I of which is an opinion
concurring in the judgment. [Justice Breyer joined the opin-
ion in its entirety and Justices Stevens, Kennedy and Gins-
burg joined Part II of the opinion.]
I.
Respondent Martinez’s claim [under] § 1983 for violation
of his privilege against compelled self-incrimination should
be rejected and his case remanded for further proceedings.
I write separately because I believe that our decision re-
quires a degree of discretionary judgment greater than Jus-
tice Thomas acknowledges. . . .
. . . As Justice Harlan explained in his dissent in Miranda
v. Arizona, “extension[s]” of the bare guarantee may be war-
ranted if clearly shown to be desirable means to protect the
basic right against the invasive pressures of contemporary
society. In this light, we can make sense of a variety of Fifth
Amendment holdings [referring to many cases, including
Kastigar and Miranda]. All of this law is outside the Fifth
Amendment’s core, with each case expressing a judgment
that the core guarantee, or the judicial capacity to protect it,
would be placed at some risk in the absence of such com-
plementary protection.
I do not, however, believe that Martinez can make the
“powerful showing,” subject to a realistic assessment of
costs and risks, necessary to expand protection of the priv-
ilege against compelled self-incrimination to the point of
the civil liability he asks us to recognize here. The most ob-
vious drawback inherent in Martinez’s purely Fifth Amend-
ment claim to damages is its risk of global application in
every instance of interrogation producing a statement in-
admissible under Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment princi-
ples, or violating one of the complementary rules we have
accepted in aid of the privilege against evidentiary use. If
obtaining Martinez’s statement is to be treated as a stand-
alone violation of the privilege subject to compensation,
why should the same not be true whenever the police ob-
tain any involuntary self-incriminating statement, or when-
ever the government so much as threatens a penalty in
derogation of the right to immunity, or whenever the police
fail to honor Miranda? Martinez offers no limiting principle
or reason to foresee a stopping place short of liability in all
such cases.
. . .
But if there is no failure of efficacy infecting the existing
body of Fifth Amendment law, any argument for a damages
remedy in this case must depend not on its Fifth Amend-
ment feature but upon the particular charge of outrageous
conduct by the police, extending from their initial encounter
with Martinez through the questioning by Chavez. That
claim, however, if it is to be recognized as a constitutional
one that may be raised in an action under § 1983, must
sound in substantive due process. [Here,] it is enough to say
that Justice Stevens shows that Martinez has a serious ar-
gument in support of such a position.
II.
Whether Martinez may pursue a claim of liability for a
substantive due process violation is thus an issue that
should be addressed on remand, along with the scope and
merits of any such action that may be found open to him.
Justice SCALIA, concurring in part in the judgment.
. . .
Nowhere did respondent’s appellate brief mention the
words “substantive due process”; the only rights it asserted
were the right against self-incrimination and the right to
warnings under Miranda. If, as Justice Souter apparently be-
lieves, the opinion below did not address respondent’s “sub-
stantive due process” claim, that claim has been forfeited.
Justice STEVENS, concurring in part and dissenting in
part.
As a matter of fact, the interrogation of respondent was
the functional equivalent of an attempt to obtain an involun-
tary confession from a prisoner by torturous methods. As a
matter of law, that type of brutal police conduct constitutes
an immediate deprivation of the prisoner’s constitutionally
protected interest in liberty. Because these propositions are
so clear, the [courts below] correctly held that petitioner is
not entitled to qualified immunity.
I.
. . .
The sound recording of this interrogation, which has
been lodged with the Court, vividly demonstrates that re-
spondent was suffering severe pain and mental anguish
throughout petitioner’s persistent questioning.
II.
The Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment pro-
tects individuals against state action that either “ ‘shocks the
conscience,’ Rochin. or interferes with rights ‘implicit in the
concept of ordered liberty,’ Palko. [The Palko Court] refused
to hold that every violation of the Fifth Amendment satisfied
the second standard. In a host of other cases, however, the
Court has held that unusually coercive police interrogation
procedures do violate that standard.
. . .
I respectfully dissent, but for the reasons articulated by
Justice Kennedy, concur in Part II of Justice Souter’s opinion.
Justice KENNEDY, with whom Justice Stevens joins, and
with whom Justice Ginsburg joins as to Parts II and III, con-
curring in part and dissenting in part.

CHAPTER 10
A constitutional right is traduced the moment torture or
its close equivalents are brought to bear. Constitutional pro-
tection for a tortured suspect is not held in abeyance until
some later criminal proceeding takes place. . . .
. . .
The conclusion that the Self-Incrimination Clause is not vi-
olated until the government seeks to use a statement in some
later criminal proceeding strips the Clause of an essential
part of its force and meaning.This is no small matter. . . .
Even if some think the abuses of the Star Chamber can-
not revive, the specter of Sheriff Screws or of the deputies
who beat the confessions out of the defendants in Brown v.
Mississippi is not so easily banished.
III.
In my view the Self-Incrimination Clause is applicable at
the time and place police use compulsion to extract a state-
ment from a suspect.The Clause forbids that conduct.A ma-
jority of the Court has now concluded otherwise, but that
should not end this case. It simply implicates the larger def-
inition of liberty under the Due Process Clause of the Four-
teenth Amendment. [It] seems to me a simple enough
matter to say that use of torture or its equivalent in an at-
tempt to induce a statement violates an individual’s funda-
mental right to liberty of the person. The Constitution does
not countenance the official imposition of severe pain or
pressure for purposes of interrogation. This is true whether
the protection is found in the Self-Incrimination Clause, the
broader guarantees of the Due Process Clause, or both.
. . .
. . . In a case like this one, recovery should be available
under § 1983 if a complainant can demonstrate that an offi-
cer exploited his pain and suffering with the purpose and in-
tent of securing an incriminating statement. That showing
has been made here.
Following Chavez, the Court continued to distinguish between those circum-
stances where protections required by Miranda are so essential to preserving the core
of the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination that they are constitutionally
required and those circumstances that are not constitutionally required because the
application of the Miranda rule exceeds the core of the Fifth Amendment. In U.S. v.
Patane (2004), the Court ruled that physical evidence that was the fruit of an unmi-
randized interrogation, need not be suppressed, because the Fifth Amendment pro-
tected an incriminating statement from use at trial, but not the fruit of that statement.
Patane, a convicted felon, rejected an officer’s attempt to inform him of his rights and,
upon questioning, volunteered the location of an illegally possessed gun.
6.
Subsequent Use of a Suppressed Statement for Impeachment
As we have seen, a statement illegally obtained from the defendant may not be intro-
duced at trial by the prosecution to prove the defendant’s guilt. If the defendant tes-
tifies at trial and this testimony contradicts the suppressed statement, however, the
prosecution may use the suppressed statement to show that the defendant is lying or,
at the least, is giving testimony inconsistent with the earlier statement. This attack on
a witness’s credibility is called impeachment, and the use of a suppressed statement
for this purpose is permitted under Harris v. New York (1971). The Harris Court justi-
fied its decision by reasoning that it was not the intent of Miranda to give a green light
to defendants to testify falsely with impunity. Critics of the decision say that it chills
or deters a defendant’s right to testify on his or her own behalf. If the suppressed
statement is seriously damaging to the defendant, the defendant’s attorney may be
forced to advise the defendant not to testify even on his or her legitimate view of the
facts, knowing that if some inconsistency arises, the defendant will open the door to
the government’s use of the damaging statement.
A defendant’s silence, exercised prior to Miranda warnings being given, or where
Miranda warnings never were given, can be commented on for impeachment pur-
poses [Jenkins v. Anderson (1980) and Fletcher v. Weir (1982)]. This impeachment ex-
ception, however, is restricted to the impeachment of a defendant and does not
include the impeachment of other defense witnesses [James v. Illinois (1990)].
The impeachment exception raises the issue of whether a defendant’s statements
made after exercising the right to an attorney and in response to continued police
impeachment:
attack on a witness’s credi-
bility, showing inconsistent
statements.

Confessions and Pretrial Identification Procedures
■385
questioning after exercising the right can be used for impeachment. The Supreme
Court said the statements can still be used for impeachment in Oregon v. Hass (1975).
In a more recent case, the Supreme Court of California ruled that such illegally ob-
tained statements can be used for impeachment even when the police continue ques-
tioning for the sole purpose of gaining statements for impeachment [People v. Peevy
(Cal. 1998)].
Keep in mind that the law on when statements can be used to impeach has some
subtle complexities. If you are called on to draft a motion or perform any other task
in this area, detailed research is essential. For example, not all illegally obtained state-
ments may be used for impeachment purposes. If a statement is truly coerced, such
as where immunity is granted, thus compelling testimony, any use of the testimony
to impeach is a constitutional violation, and not simply a violation of the Miranda
safeguards [New Jersey v. Portash (1979)].
D.
EFFECT OF DENIAL OF RIGHT TO COUNSEL (MASSIAH)
AND HARMLESS ERROR
Miranda, as we have seen, focuses on conditions that are inherently compelling, threat-
ening a suspect’s Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The conditions of
“in custody” and “interrogation” are essential to its invocation. Massiah v. U.S. (1964)
focuses strictly on whether the defendant’s SixthAmendment right to counsel has been
violated. It applies after a person has been indicted or arraigned, and prohibits the po-
lice from deliberately eliciting incriminating statements from the suspect. The Massiah
doctrine, almost forgotten since Miranda, has been revived in the following line of cases.
In Brewer v. Williams (1977), an arrested and arraigned defendant had been in-
structed by his attorney not to answer any police questions. While being transported
across the state by the police, the defendant, whom police knew to be extremely reli-
gious, revealed the location of the body of the victim in response to a deliberate ap-
peal from the police that the murder victim be provided a “decent Christian burial.”
The Court ruled that the ploy was a deliberate attempt to elicit incriminating evidence
outside the presence of counsel.
The U.S. v. Henry (1980) Court reaffirmed Massiah and Williams, ruling that the
planting of a paid informant to converse with the defendant, even though the inform-
ant was instructed not to question the defendant about the alleged crime, was a delib-
erate attempt to elicit incriminating statements from the defendant during the
conversations. Placing an informant just to overhear a defendant’s statement, and not
to converse with the defendant, is permissible [Kuhlmann v. Wilson (1986)]. It is akin to
placing an electronic eavesdropping device. The clarity of this line is lost, however,
when one considers that the incriminating statements in Kuhlmann were offered after
the informant said to the defendant that his original statement “didn’t sound too good.”
Can a defendant introduce evidence at trial that a prosecution witness exercised
his right to remain silent following the Miranda warnings, thus implying the witness
has something to hide? On the groundbreaking Miranda issue, the court said no [U.S.
v. Zaccaria (1st Cir. 2001)].
In two recent cases the Court reaffirmed the importance of the Sixth Amendment
right to counsel during interrogation and more strongly stated its limitations. In
Fellers v. U.S. (2004), the Court ruled that police violated the defendant’s right to coun-
sel, because the defendant had already been indicted on the pertinent drug-related
charges, that the informal conversation employed by the officers was done to elicit in-
criminating statements on the charges, and the Miranda warnings were administered
afterward, following Fellers’ arrest. In Texas v. Cobb (2001), the defendant was repre-
sented by counsel on a burglary charge that police thought was related to a double
murder. Over one year later, police questioned Cobb alone about the murders, to
which he confessed. The Court held that the confession did not warrant suppression,
because the right to counsel applies to charged offenses, is offense-specific, and there
is no exception for uncharged, factually related crimes.

between his teeth.”

CHAPTER 10
At one time the Court held that if a conviction was obtained at trial with use of
an illegal confession, the conviction had to be overturned. In Arizona v. Fulminante
(1991), however, the Court made it clear that henceforth an illegally used confession
would not bring automatic reversal if there was enough other evidence on which to
base the conviction. In other words, use of the tainted confession could be “harm-
less error.”
A new wrinkle related to rights during interrogation involves the assertion of in-
ternational treaty rights by foreign nationals. In State v. Navarro (Wis. App. 2003),
Navarro requested suppression of some potentially incriminating statements he
made to police after waiving his Miranda rights but before police informed him that
he had the right under the Vienna Convention (1969) to speak with consular officials.
Although the court said that suppression was not an appropriate remedy under such
circumstances, its primary holding was that the signatory nation, and not affected in-
dividuals, must assert violations of treaty rights.
The recommended police procedure under the Vienna Convention on Consular
Relations (VCCR), Article 36, is to:
1.
determine if the arrestee is a foreign national; if so,
2.
determine whether the relevant country requires mandatory notification of
the arrest;
3.
determine, in the case of a person from a nonmandatory notice country, if
the arrestee wants the consulate notified;
4.
notify the consulate if mandatory or requested; and
5.
tell the arrestee that the consulate (or embassy) has been notified.6
It is conceivable that failure to follow these guidelines could lead to a suspect’s claim
that, without such notification of the relevant consulate, she felt coerced to make a
confession.7
E.
CHALLENGING A CONFESSION
In most jurisdictions, the judge decides whether a statement of a defendant will be
suppressed following the defendant’s motion for suppression and a hearing on the
motion. The defendant can testify at this hearing without giving up the right to re-
main silent at trial. These hearings are usually held well before the trial begins. The
admission of a defendant’s statement can also be challenged via an objection at trial
if it has not been ruled on at an earlier date.
Because of the cost and time involved in the process of hearing challenges to con-
fessions, and because a significant number of confessions thought to be valid have
been found to be invalid (27 of the first 111 death penalty DNAexonerations),8 a grow-
ing number of police departments are videotaping interrogations.9 The Minnesota
Supreme Court requires the electronic recording of custodial interrogations where
feasible [State v. Scales (Minn. 1994)]. Also see Stephan v. State (Alaska 1985).
Another factor that figures into interrogations is the belief among many police of-
ficers and others that police experience in questioning has given them the ability to
determine better than others whether a person is lying. A series of studies have con-
cluded that police do not outperform others in this regard.10
F.
THE PARALEGAL’S ROLE
Your job in attacking and responding to attacks on a defendant’s statements to police
is to gather the facts surrounding the defendant’s statement, research the applicable
law, and draft either a motion and memorandum of law attacking the use of the state-
ment or a responsive motion and memorandum of law. When you research the law
on confessions, the same rule applies as in researching search and seizure cases: you
must find precedent cases as closely matched in facts to the new case at hand as pos-

DEFENDANT
The defendant by her attorney respectfully moves this court for an order suppressing evidence of all statements
the defendant made to police on October 2, ____ .
AS GROUNDS FOR THIS MOTION THE DEFENDANT ARGUES THAT HER STATEMENT WAS GIVEN TO PO-
LICE WHILE SHE WAS IN CUSTODY AS DEFINED BY MIRANDA AND SUBSEQUENT CASES, AND THAT SHE
WAS NOT GIVEN THE REQUIRED MIRANDA WARNINGS.
At 4 A.M. on October 2, ____ , two uniformed and armed police officers entered a bus parked at the terminal in
Wayland, Columbia. The police had information that one Sharon Striker had robbed a convenience store in
Legalville, Columbia, and was reported to be on the bus to Wayland and beyond. The police approached the de-
fendant, who was the only person in the bus, and positioned themselves to block any exit from the bus. (See at-
tached police report.) Officer Mader asked and was given permission to search the defendant’s purse, which
revealed a driver’s license in the defendant’s name. Officer Riley said, “She’s the one.” The police moved closer to
the defendant and waited briefly. The defendant began to cry and then said, “I didn’t want to rob the store.”
It is well established law that police must give the Miranda warnings in settings outside the police interrogation
room when a defendant is in custody or otherwise significantly deprived of freedom. [Miranda vs. Arizona, 384 U.S.
463 (1966) and Orozco vs. Texas, 394 U.S. 324 (1969).] In Orozco, the Supreme Court ruled that a person con-
fronted in his own bedroom by two uniformed officers in the early morning hours was “in custody” and the Miranda
warnings were required.
Similarly, the defendant was cornered by two uniformed and armed police officers in the early morning hours,
in the rear of an isolated and empty bus, and had been openly identified as the person the police wanted. Under
these circumstances, it is clear that the defendant was not free to go and that the environment was coercive in na-
ture. Therefore, the police should have given her Miranda warnings before inducing her to speak by stating “she’s
the one,” followed by deliberate silence and their ominous presence.
Because the defendant, for all practical purposes, was in custody and significantly deprived of her freedom, her
statement must be presumed to be involuntary and should be suppressed.
Therefore, the defendant moves this court for an order suppressing evidence of the defendant’s statement, and
further requests that a hearing be scheduled on the motion.

RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT’S
vs.
MOTION TO SUPPRESS
SHARON STRIKER,
STATEMENT
DEFENDANT
The State of Columbia requests the Court to deny the Defendant’s Motion to Suppress Statement.
The defendant argues that she was in custody at the time she was questioned by the police, and was not warned
of her right to an attorney and her right against self-incrimination in violation of Miranda vs. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436
(1966).
Despite the defendant’s reliance on Orozco vs. Texas, 394 U.S. 324 (1969), the most applicable decision of the
Supreme Court is the more recent case of Berkemer vs. McCarty, 468 U.S. 420 (1984). In Berkemer, police ques-
tioning of the driver of a car about the use of intoxicants and absent Miranda warnings, even though the police were
going to arrest the driver, was not a violation of Miranda. In establishing a more objective standard for addressing
the in-custody issue, the Court focused on how “a reasonable [person] in the suspect’s position would have un-
derstood [the] situation.” In other words, are the circumstances such that a reasonable person would feel so iso-
lated and restrained and so under the power of the police as to be in custody?
The facts in Berkemer are similar to the facts in the defendant’s case. Like the suspect in Berkemer, the defen-
dant was not yet under arrest, was only temporarily detained because the bus would be leaving soon, and was in
a place in view and hearing of the public, particularly the bus driver who was just outside. (See the defendant’s at-
tached police report.) Also, the stop and frisk case of Florida vs. Bostick, 111 S. Ct. 2382 (1991), provides guid-
ance; in parallel circumstances the Court ruled that reasonable persons would have realized they did not have to
answer questions and were free to go.
Based on the above-cited authority, the defendant’s motion to suppress is without adequate grounds and should
be denied.

LINEUPS, ONE-ON-ONE SHOW-UPS,
AND PHOTO IDENTIFICATIONS
A.
INTRODUCTION
Eyewitness identification procedures have long been employed by police to solve
crimes. Studies increasingly reveal the uncertainty of such indentifications, how-
ever. In one famous study, only 15 percent of 2,000 eyewitnesses were able to cor-
rectly identify the perpetrator.11 More recently a review of sixty-three DNA
exoneration cases showed that mistaken eyewitness identification occurred in fifty-
three of the cases.12 Other studies indicate that both subtle and not so subtle police
communication with the eyewitness during identification procedures influences the
outcome.13
For this reason the courts have scrutinized pretrial identification procedures and
have ruled that they are subject to two constitutional concerns. First, once criminal
prosecution begins, a defendant has the right to counsel at such procedures, and sec-
ond, the procedures must be reasonably fair to conform with the defendant’s right to
due process.

Confessions and Pretrial Identification Procedures
■389
B.
THE RIGHT TO COUNSEL AT PRETRIAL IDENTIFICATION
The heart of the right to counsel in this context is the Sixth Amendment right to con-
front one’s accuser, especially through cross-examination at trial. In order for a defen-
dant to exercise the right to cross-examination fully, the defense counsel needs to be
present to observe the identification procedures. The attorney’s observation of any
weaknesses in the procedure will give counsel a fair chance to question the person mak-
ing the identification and to reveal facts, circumstances, and biases that might have pro-
duced misidentification. Without counsel at such procedures, the right of confrontation
at trial and its close cousin, the right of cross-examination, are rendered powerless.
In U.S. v. Wade (1967) and Gilbert v. California (1967), the Supreme Court ruled that
a lineup held after indictment (or after criminal prosecution begins) requires the pres-
ence of defense counsel. It declined to require the presence of counsel at routine inves-
tigation lineups prior to indictment, the filing of charges, or a warrant for arrest on
charges in Kirby v. Illinois (1972). In U.S. v. Ash (1973), the Court also declined to extend
the counsel requirement to postindictment photo identification procedures, stating that
there was no confrontation with the accuser as existed in the lineup cases. If a lineup is
conducted after prosecution begins without the defendant’s counsel being notified of its
occurrence, any identification stemming from that lineup is inadmissible at trial. Should
such evidence be mistakenly admitted at trial, the defendant is granted a new trial, un-
less enough other evidence exists to render the violation harmless error (Gilbert).
The right to counsel extends to the actual time the identification is made, even if
that is some time after the lineup (Wade). It also extends to one-on-one confrontation
procedures where police bring the suspect before the witness for identification,
whether this occurs before trial or at trial [Moore v. Illinois (1977)]. The right to have
counsel present at identification procedures may be waived if Miranda-type warnings
are given to the suspect, but waiver of right to counsel for a statement does not ex-
tend to lineups and one-on-one confrontations (Wade).
The right to counsel is not absolute. Exigent circumstances, such as the possible
imminent death of a witness or when the identification occurs shortly after the crime,
and reliable circumstances, such as when witnesses have had a good look at the sus-
pect, outweigh other factors [Stovall v. Denno (1967)]. Once an identification proce-
dure is ruled unconstitutional, any subsequent identification of the defendant by the
same witness is valid only if it can be shown that the original identification has not
precluded an independently based, reliable identification (Wade).
C.
DUE PROCESS AND PRETRIAL IDENTIFICATIONS
Identification procedures may also be found to violate the defendant’s right to due
process under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The court looks at the “totality
of the circumstances,” and if it finds that the police procedure is too suggestive and
subject to “irreparable” mistake, the identification is inadmissible (Stovall). Sugges-
tiveness alone is not enough to invalidate the identification, especially if all the facts
reflect a reliable identification [Neil v. Biggers (1972), station house show-up, and Man-
son v. Brathwaite (1977), photograph]. Some factors to consider include the following:
■

Here is a sampling of relevant due process cases. Due process was violated when
the defendant was placed in a lineup with only two other, considerably shorter per-
sons and where the defendant was the only one to wear a jacket similar to one worn
at the crime. He was subsequently placed in a one-on-one identification, followed by

CHAPTER 10
another lineup in which he was the only person repeated from the first lineup [Foster
v. California (1969)]. In Simmons v. U.S. (1968), where bank employees had a good look
at a robber, the FBI had not influenced the identification procedure, and five bank em-
ployees made separate, positive identification of the defendant from six photographs,
due process was not violated. Finally, in a one-on-one show-up where the black de-
fendant was handcuffed and brought to a dying victim’s hospital bed, identification
was permissible (Stovall). The Court added that one-on-one confrontations are disfa-
vored.
A court may permit the defense to place the defendant among other individuals
in the courtroom to ensure an accurate in-court identification. Some judges use an in-
court lineup. Most courts prohibit the use of decoys, or defendant stand-ins, to induce
the witness or victim to misidentify.
Incorporating the findings from relevant studies, the preferred lineup proce-
dure should:
a.
Include a minimum of six persons with similar physical characteristics (or
eight photos);
b.
Require all participants to speak, gesture, and wear certain clothing if any
one of them is requested to do so;
c.
Inform all persons viewing the lineup that the lineup may not include the
guilty person;
d.
Require persons making the identification to view each person in the
lineup separately and not as a group (to avoid selecting a person in the
group appearing most similar to the suspect);
e.
Require the officer conducting the lineup to have no knowledge of who the
likely suspect is (to avoid intentional or unintentional influence);
f.
Limit viewing of the lineup to one witness at a time; and
g.
Be photographed or videotaped.14

CONCLUSION
The law of confessions focuses on the right against self-incrimination and the related
impact of Miranda v. Arizona. The right against self-incrimination stems from the ac-
cusatory system of justice. It places the burden of proof on the state and deliberately
deemphasizes the reliance on confessions that can so easily result in injustice and
abuse of the individual. If a confession is obtained in violation of this right, it is ex-
cluded from evidence.
Persons, and not corporations, are protected. The right may be exercised in any
criminal or other proceeding if testimony may lead to the punishment of the indi-
vidual. If a statement can link the person to a yet-to-be-prosecuted crime, it is in-
criminating. Such statements can be compelled, however, when the statute of
limitations has run or if immunity is granted to the person making the statement. A
person must assert the right, whether in court or on documents such as tax forms, or
the right is waived. An overriding public interest may require the reporting of cer-
tain kinds of information. Statutes requiring the reporting of such things as income
from illegal gambling activities are unconstitutional. Any methods or statutes that re-
strain the exercising of the right violate the right. Once a person waives the right re-
garding a specific crime, it becomes more difficult to reassert the right later. The right
extends only to testimonial evidence, and does not extend to nontestimonial evi-
dence such as the taking of blood, voice samples, or other evidence for purposes of
physical identification.

Confessions and Pretrial Identification Procedures
■391
Miranda v. Arizona is the most significant decision in the past 40 years that protects
a person’s right against self-incrimination. The decision focuses on the coerciveness
of police custody and interrogation and requires officers to warn suspects who are “in
custody” and under “interrogation” that they have the rights to remain silent and to
an attorney. Any statement made without these warnings is inadmissible; any state-
ment made without the presence of an attorney is presumed coerced. Numerous de-
cisions have gone beyond Miranda to define “in custody,” determine what constitutes
a waiver, and decide when a suppressed confession may be used to impeach a defen-
dant.
A defendant’s right to counsel and to due process offers protection from unduly
suggestive pretrial identification procedures during lineups and photo identifica-
tions. The right to have counsel present during a lineup preserves the defendant’s
right to confrontation and cross-examination at trial; due process requires that the
procedure not create irreparable misidentification. In both cases the rights apply only
after official criminal proceedings have begun.
Paralegals make valuable contributions to the law office at this stage of criminal
proceedings. They research the law and latest cases, draft memoranda, draft motions
to suppress and responses thereto, verify the use of proper police procedures, main-
tain quick-reference practice systems, and perform other related professional tasks.

APPLICATION ASSIGNMENTS
1.
Using the decisions on custody discussed in the text, determine whether
the suspect was “in custody” in these two cases.
In Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U.S. 420, 104 S.Ct. 1136 (1984), questioning
took place at the suspect’s probation officer’s office. The meeting was
arranged by appointment at the suspect’s request and was in surroundings
familiar to the suspect.
In State v. Bridges, 329 A.2d 247 (Me. 2003), police questioned a young
woman three separate times about the death of her boyfriend. The third
session of questioning took place in a small room at a fire station, doors
were closed, the suspect was accused of lying, told evidence existed that
did not, and she was told she could leave. She had no shoes on and no
means of transportation.
2.
Assume that Eldon Spiers in Case I has been subpoenaed before a grand
jury in your state. The jury is investigating Kate Lamb’s death. Your boss,
the prosecutor, wants to know whether the suspect must be given the
Miranda warnings before testifying at the hearing. Research the law in
your state and draft a brief memo of authorities for your supervising
attorney.

392
■
CHAPTER 10
Assume that a neighboring state has jurisdiction over this matter as well.
Research the law of one neighboring state to determine where it stands on
the issue and, then, whether in a subsequent trial in that state, the court
must adhere to a neighboring state’s suppression of the suspect’s grand
jury testimony. Draft a brief memo of authorities.
3.
Based on the principles of law set out in Miranda and more recent decisions,
how would you decide the issue set out in Exhibits 10–1 and 10–2? Support
your answer with cases, principles, and pertinent public policies.
4.
Read the following summary of facts and draft a motion to suppress the
defendant’s statements, using the authorities cited in this section of the
text. Half the class may be assigned to draft a response to the defense
motion. Use the format for a motion given in the examples, or your
standard state format if indicated by your instructor.
At 2 P.M. on October 6, ____ , Eldon Spiers, defendant, was asked to
accompany detectives to their car. Mr. Spiers is a thirty-one-year-old
college janitor with a tenth grade education. He seems unintelligent and
somewhat childlike at times. He was led to an unmarked car by two
plainclothes officers. Prior to getting into the police car the officers gave
their weapons to a third officer. Some onlookers were nearby.
In the car one police officer said, “Eldon, you’re a nice boy; you can still
make this right.” Then he gave Eldon the following warnings: “You have
the right to remain silent; anything you say can be used against you in
court. We can get you an attorney if you want, and you won’t have to pay.
Do you understand?”
The police report says that the defendant nodded slightly and said, “I
think so.”
Police: Are you ready to talk with us?
Spiers: Sure.
Police: Did you know a student named Kate Lamb?
Spiers: Yes (blushing). I used to watch her.
Police: You hurt her, didn’t you?
Spiers: I need to see my mother. She’s going to be real mad.
Police: Did you ever hurt Kate Lamb?
Spiers made no further response to questioning. He was arrested and
taken to the police station, booked, and jailed. The next morning while a
police officer delivered the defendant’s morning meal, Eldon Spiers said,
“Can you talk with me?” The officer said, “Sure, Eldon, I’d like to talk with
you, but it better be good. I’m pretty busy.”
Spiers: I did it.
Police: What did you do?
Spiers: I couldn’t help myself. Uh-oh, Mother is really going to be
angry.
The officer continued to question him, but Spiers retreated to the corner
of his cell and said nothing more.
5.
How would you rule on the admissibility of the pretrial identification
procedure in the following circumstances, and why?
a.
Three of five photos shown to the witness were of the suspect. See
People v. Citrino, 90 Cal. Rptr. 80 (Cal. App. 1970).
b.
Only the suspect’s photo was clearly altered. See State v. Alexander, 503
P.2d 777 (Ariz. 1972).
c.
Only one photo was shown in the identification of a rapist who told
the victim he had been jailed for rape before, and where the victim

Confessions and Pretrial Identification Procedures
■393
had gotten a good look at the rapist. See Chaney v. State, 267 So.2d 65
(Fla. 1972).
d.
Police conducted a lineup without counsel after the counsel left an
order that the defendant not be interrogated without counsel present.
See People v. LaClere, 564 N.E.2d 640 (N.Y. 1990).
e.
A one-on-one confrontation was held months after the crime because
police claimed they could not find other persons with similar physical
characteristics, and where the victim had viewed the defendant for
half an hour at the time of the crime. See Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188, 93
S.Ct. 375, (1972).
f.
In the course of an investigation police asked a suspect to come to the
station house. The defendant was given Miranda warnings, did not
clearly waive counsel, then was put in a lineup. See Kirby v. Illinois, 406
U.S. 682, 92 S.Ct. 1877 (1972).
6.
Review Miranda v. Arizona to determine the reasoning behind the decision.
Then read the following facts and decide whether the reasoning in Miranda
should be expanded to cover the confession in this new situation. Explain.
A package delivery company employee was observed opening a
package. He was taken by company officials to a room with no windows
and led to believe that he would not be prosecuted if he confessed and
returned all stolen items. He was interrogated for fifteen minutes and
confessed to the observed theft. Then he was questioned for another forty
minutes and confessed to other thefts. The state wants to use the
confession at trial and the defense moves to suppress it because it is not
voluntary. See Commonwealth v. Cooper, 889 S.W.2d 75 (Ky. 1995).

CHAPTER 11
I.
INTRODUCTION
Acase enters the pretrial stage with the defendant’s arrest. Initial stages in the process
include the prosecutorial decision to charge and the considerations and limitations on
that decision. Chapter 11 takes a case from the initial appearance through the prelim-
inary hearing to extradition. Your tasks encompass interviewing for developing ar-
guments on bail, learning to deal with difficult clients, and gathering information and
drafting proposed questions for the preliminary hearing.
II.
INITIAL APPEARANCE
A.
INTRODUCTION
Once the defendant is arrested and booked and the charge is drafted and filed (see Chap-
ter 8), the defendant is provided an initial appearance. The initial appearance is the first
time the criminal defendant comes before a judge or magistrate to be informed of the
charge and pertinent rights, and for assessment of the need for bail. In the interest of pre-
serving liberty, an arrestee must be provided a prompt initial appearance. The maximum
allowable time varies among state and federal rules. The Federal Rules of Criminal Pro-
cedure, Rule 5(a), and some state rules require the appearance “without unnecessary de-
lay.” Other states require the appearance within twenty-four hours of arrest, and still
others apply a different time limit. Because of the inconsistencies among jurisdictions,
the Supreme Court decided the constitutional limit in County of Riverside v. McLaughlin
(1991). McLaughlin sets an outside limit of forty-eight hours including weekends and hol-
idays. Any delay beyond forty-eight hours requires the government to prove a “bona
fide emergency or extraordinary circumstances.” Inadvertence, clerical error, mistake, or
delay to gather enough evidence for charging is either no excuse or improper.
A state may set a limit of less than forty-eight hours for the appearance, but not
longer than forty-eight hours. An unlawful delay in the initial appearance may result
in the suppression of evidence, particularly confessions occurring during the time of
violation [U.S. v. Davis (8th Cir. 1999), McNabb v. U.S. (1943), and Mallory v. U.S. (1957)
on violations of Rule 5(a) and 18 U.S.C.A. § 3501(c)].
A judge is required to perform several tasks at the initial appearance. The judge
1.
Reads the charges to provide due process notice of the pending charge to
the defendant.
2.
Informs the defendant of applicable rights.
3.
Determines whether the defendant should be released on bail or
remanded to jail.
B.
NOTICE OF RIGHTS AND DETERMINATION
OF INDIGENCY
The judge informs the defendant of the right to remain silent, the right to an attorney,
and the right to have an attorney appointed if the defendant is indigent. Indigency is
normally a matter of judicial determination and discretion. An indigent person does
not have the financial means to hire a lawyer, which means the person is either un-
employed or underemployed, has no assets of significant value, and shows little po-
tential for having such in the foreseeable future. If a defendant has income or property
but it is needed for bail, a determination of indigency is likely. The Bureau of Justice
Statistics reports that 82 percent of state defendants in large counties and 66 percent
of federal defendants were represented by court-appointed counsel due to indigency.1

means to hire a lawyer.

Pretrial: Initial Appearance to Preliminary Hearing
■401
Once indigency is determined, the court appoints or assigns counsel to the de-
fendant according to local rules and procedures (Fed. R. Crim. P. 44 and parallel state
rules). The U.S. district courts, in varying degrees, all use panel attorneys appointed
on a case-by-case basis from a list of private criminal defense lawyers. The federal
courts also draw attorneys from Federal Defender Organizations (FDOs), some with
full-time federal employees and others that are nonprofit corporations funded by
grants from the Administrative Office of the Courts.2 State courts use tax financed
public defender offices staffed by full-time defense lawyers, panel attorneys, and pri-
vate attorneys who contract independently with the court or the state’s administra-
tive office of the courts.
Chronic underfunding has plagued indigent criminal defense systems for
decades, resulting in overworked and underpaid lawyers and considerable turnover
in the system. Consequently, young and inexperienced attorneys handle much of the
indigent caseload. Low fees paid to private contract and panel attorneys provide lit-
tle incentive for aggressive and thorough representation. These systemic problems
cast a shadow of injustice and have led to costly appeals and the overturning of
countless convictions, most notably for inadequate representation in death penalty
cases. Although improvements have been made in death penalty representation, and
to a much lesser extent in indigent representation in general, the system continues to
have serious problems. It is interesting to note that in the Bureau of Justice Statistics
report, 88 percent of felony defendants with appointed counsel and 77 percent of
those who hired their own attorneys received prison sentences; 75 percent of state
and federal inmates with appointed counsel and 66 percent with hired counsel pled
guilty; and overall conviction rates comparing public and private representation,
however, were about the same.3 State laws that require convicted indigent defendants
to reimburse the government for the cost of appointed counsel are constitutional
[Fuller v. Oregon (1974)].
A defendant, indigent or otherwise, has the right to refuse representation by an
attorney [Faretta v. California (1975)]. In serious matters such self-representation (pro
se or pro per) is said to be akin to performing one’s own brain surgery. A judge may
appoint standby counsel to monitor the case and assist the defendant as needed.
Three tenths of one percent of all federal felony defendants and 38.4 percent of fed-
eral misdemeanants represent themselves.4
The court informs the defendant of the right to a preliminary (probable cause)
hearing in felony cases. After determining bail, some judges simply adjourn any re-
maining portion of the initial appearance to provide the defendant with time to con-
sult counsel (Fed. R. Crim. P. 5).
Minor charges such as traffic ordinance violations and misdemeanors involve a
different procedure. Normally, the defendant is summoned by citation to appear in
court on a specified date. If the penalty for the crime is simply a fine or involves a jail
sentence of less than six months, there is no constitutional right to a jury trial. The
judge asks for a plea and briefly explores the circumstances, then renders a decision.
Some minor cases may be rescheduled for trial before the judge at a later date. Indi-
gent persons do not have the right to an appointed attorney in minor cases unless they
are sentenced to jail [Scott v. Illinois (1979)] or are given a conditional or suspended
sentence [Alabama v. Shelton (2002)]. In practice this means that a judge should appoint
counsel for an indigent defendant even in minor cases when a jail sentence has not
been ruled out or, conceivably, could be imposed for the potential failure to abide by
conditions set by the court. Some states require appointment of counsel in any crim-
inal matter having a possible jail sentence.
Because of efficiency and security reasons, initial appearances are increasingly
conducted by interactive video.

C.
BAIL
1.
Conditions
At the initial appearance the judge determines whether a defendant will be released
from jail and, if so, under what conditions. The Eighth Amendment states, “Excessive
bail shall not be required. . . .” Most authorities presume that this provision is appli-
cable to the states via the Fourteenth Amendment, even though the Supreme Court
has not ruled on the issue [Schilb v. Kuebel (1971)]. The right to reasonable bail is
grounded in the rationale that liberty is dear, that an accused can better assist coun-
sel when free to locate information and witnesses, and that a person can work and
better contribute to family and society when free to do so. The presumption of inno-
cence, however, applies only at trial to delegate the burden of proof and is not appli-
cable to bail considerations.
The two most significant cases on bail are Stack v. Boyle (1951) and U.S. v.
Salerno (1987). Stack held that the only constitutional consideration in bail determi-
nations is what is necessary to ensure the defendant’s presence at court appear-
ances. A judge must base that determination on standards, the most common of
which are the nature and circumstances of the offense, evidence against the defen-
dant, the financial ability of the defendant to post bail, and the history and charac-
teristics of the person [Fed. R. Crim. P. 46, 18 U.S.C.A. § 3142(g); and similar state
statutes].
Salerno holds that preventive detention, denying bail to the accused based on a
determination that the accused is a threat to the community, is also a constitutionally
permissible consideration [see 18 U.S.C.A. § 3142(g)(4)]. Salerno states that a person
may not be held without bail unless there is authorizing legislation and the demon-
stration of a “legitimate and compelling need,” following an adversarial detention
hearing at which the state must show by clear and convincing evidence that the per-
son is a danger to any person or the community. The statute upheld in Salerno (18
U.S.C.A. § 3141 et seq.) requires the judge to make a record of the justification for de-
tention and gives the accused the right to an immediate appeal of the detention deci-
sion. Similar state laws are probably constitutional as well. Despite Salerno, a number
of states continue to limit judicial consideration in bail to that necessary to ensure
presence in court. Even before Salerno, state or federal court denial of pretrial release
in capital (death penalty) cases had been upheld. Denial of pretrial release in capital
cases, however, is normally permitted only when “proof (of guilt) is evident” or the
“presumption (of guilt) is great.”
After considering what is necessary to ensure the defendant’s presence at trial
and determining whether the defendant is dangerous, the court sets the amount and
conditions of bail. Some defendants are released before the initial appearance ac-
cording to a predetermined bail schedule, such as the one in Exhibit 11–1.5
2.
Types of Bail
If the defendant has not been released prior to the initial appearance, the court has the
following options.
1.
Personal recognizance is release on a promise to return to court at the next
scheduled appearance. Most courts require the defendant’s signature on a
bail release form that is executed in the clerk of court’s office.
2.
Unsecured bond, sometimes called personal bond, is release under a
signed obligation to pay the court a specified sum of money in the event
the defendant fails to appear.
3.
Surety or cash bond is release only after surrendering to the clerk of court
a specified sum of money or evidence of ownership of property sufficient
to cover the amount of the bond in case of forfeiture. Typically, a family
member’s property can be used to secure the bond. Forfeiture results in
surety or cash bond:
release after surrendering to
the clerk of court a specified
sum of money or evidence
of ownership of property suf-
ficient to cover the amount
of the bond in case of
forfeiture.

percent bond:
release after posting a spec-
ified percentage, usually 10
percent, of a cash bond.
loss of the property or a sale of the property to generate sufficient cash to
pay the bond.
4.
Percent bond is release only after posting a specified percentage, usually
10 percent, of a cash bond. For example, if the court sets the bond at
$10,000, the defendant must post $1,000. In some jurisdictions either this
amount or a part of it remains with the court to cover administrative costs.
Forfeiture for failure to appear, however, is for the entire $10,000.
5.
Supervised release is release under the supervision of a probation or
pretrial release officer or, in some cases, to the custody of a third party. The
third party may be a relative, a minister, or a community organization, for
example, that agrees to supervise the defendant and report any violation of
conditions under the bond.
Bail bondspersons are still used in some state jurisdictions. These individuals
post bond for a defendant after securing the bond with the defendant’s property or
that of close relatives. The price paid by the defendant for such services, the premium,
is often quite high. This practice took on a sleaze factor akin to loan sharking, leading
to its prohibition and bail reform in many jurisdictions. Private bounty hunters are
employed in some areas by bail bond companies to find bail jumpers.
The court may also impose conditions for release that can include finding a job,
restricting travel, refraining from the use of alcohol or drugs (sometimes enforced
through testing), and staying away from specified persons, such as the alleged victim.
Typically the court must consider the least restrictive alternative likely to ensure the
defendant’s presence. Exhibit 11–2, an Order Setting Conditions of Release for the
federal system, provides an excellent list of the alternatives available for a judge to
consider regarding pretrial release.
Release to a reliable third person who the court knows can provide more super-
vision than a probation or other officer and who will report any violation of condi-
tions can be one of the most valuable conditions suggested by the defense.
3.
Pretrial Release Services
Many states and the federal courts employ pretrial release services that function un-
der the administrative arm of the court system. These services provide the court with
relevant information for bail determination and supervision of persons released on
bail. Some paralegals work as pretrial release officers.
Pretrial release officers interview persons who have been arrested and jailed.
They gather information on the person’s residence, ties to the community, employ-
ment or ongoing schooling, prior criminal record, drug dependency, and so forth. Ex-
hibit 11–3 is a representative pretrial services interview form.6
After confirming this information, the officer evaluates the person’s prospects for
bail, typically by assigning a positive point value to stable community ties or a steady
job, for example, and a negative point value for previous convictions or pending
charges. Whether fair or not, the system favors those defendants appearing to be
middle class. This evaluation is conveyed to the judge for use at the initial appearance,
and it may or may not be accompanied by the officer’s personal recommendation.
The officer may supervise those defendants who are released by locating com-
munity treatment programs and periodically checking on the defendant’s continued
residence, job status, drug tests, and other conditions imposed by the court. The offi-
cer is charged with reporting any violations of conditions and subsequent criminal
conduct, and may be responsible for notifying the defendant of court dates and mak-
ing sure the defendant appears, particularly if the defendant has no attorney.
There is some evidence that as many as 80 percent of all jailed arrestees meet with
pretrial services.7 The federal statutes on pretrial services are 18 U.S.C.A.
§§ 3152–3156. Without a pretrial services evaluation, the court relies heavily on its own
inquiry into the defendant’s background or on information and recommendations

supplied by prosecution and defense counsels. With this information, the court de-
termines the amount of bail. A 2000 study of the nation’s seventy-five most popu-
lous counties reported that 62 percent of felony defendants were released by the
court before the disposition of their cases, 26 percent on their own recognizance and
37 percent on surety bond.8 Some defendants who would otherwise be denied bail
or could not post bail are released with special monitoring devices. The newest such
device uses satellite global positioning technology to track defendants as often as
once per minute, and can be programmed to alert authorities if prohibited bound-
aries are breeched, including those protecting the victim of the crime.9 If a defen-
dant is unable to make bail, some systems require a bail review hearing in
twenty-four hours.

INITIAL APPEARANCE: PARALEGAL’S ROLE
1.
Introduction
The more serious the case, the more important it is to be prepared for the initial ap-
pearance, regardless of which side of the case you are assigned. The prosecutor may
see this as the first opportunity to place some meaningful pressure on the defendant.
An incarcerated defendant is going to be more quickly demoralized, more eager to
plead, and less able to assist defense counsel. Further, failure of the defense counsel to
gain the release of the defendant at the initial appearance may negatively impact on
the defendant’s perception of the ability of the defense attorney. All these considera-
tions, of course, must be balanced against the prosecutor’s duty to fairness and justice.
On the other hand, defense counsel wants to demonstrate capability and pre-
paredness to the client, prosecution, and judge; wants the client to have confidence in
the attorney’s work and judgment; and wants the defendant to be free to work and
support family, demonstrate reliability, and assist counsel in locating information and
preparing the case for trial.
Therefore, both sides need to be well prepared, and how well prepared they are
may depend on your work. The foundation work that is done in preparation for the
initial appearance also may have considerable value at a bail reconsideration hearing,
an arraignment, or even at trial or sentencing. The amount of time and energy spent
preparing for the initial appearance depends on the seriousness of the case, likelihood
the defendant will remain incarcerated, availability of office resources, and other con-
siderations. Use both the prosecution and defense checklists to provide persuasive in-
formation to your supervising attorney and to anticipate your opponent’s likely
position on the bail issue. Two good resources to review in preparation for argument
regarding bail are The ABA Criminal Justice Standards on Pretrial Release (2002) and The
National Association of Pretrial Services Agencies’Performance Standards and Goals for Pre-
trial Release (2nd ed. 1998).
2.
Obtaining the Criminal Record
Whether it is for the initial appearance or later, obtaining the criminal record of the ac-
cused is essential. Often the arresting police agency will obtain the record and pass it on
to the prosecutor. Sometimes this duty falls to the prosecution paralegal. In turn the
prosecution shares the record with the defense on request. To obtain as complete a
record as possible, check several sources. The National Communication Information
Center (NCIC) is an arm of the FBI that keeps criminal records on persons who have
been charged with or convicted of felonies. Information in the system also includes per-
sons on probation, parole, or supervised release; federal prison inmates; convicted sex
offenders; missing and deported persons; fingerprints; scars, tattoos, and signatures;
and stolen guns, vehicles, license plates, stocks, and other articles. Records are accu-
mulated from all states, federal jurisdictions, and law enforcement agencies. Searches
can be done by name and social security number, and fingerprints also can be matched.

Sample Printout of
NCIC Search
NCIC databanks are computerized, facilitating nearly instantaneous searches from po-
lice stations and even squad cars and helping to prevent unwitting release of suspects
who have outstanding warrants. Fingerprints and photos can be automatically
matched in minutes, and mug shots can be sent electronically to improve identification
of the suspect. In addition, the FBI has launched a unified, fifty-state DNA databank
that will not only be able to match DNA samples, but also report whether the same
DNA was found at a previous crime scene in any other state. One must be authorized
and trained to do NCIC searches. Exhibit 11–4 contains a sample printout.10
The following is a brief translation of the printout in Exhibit 11–4. This person
is probably a first offender where a reduced charge and a possible thirty-day jail
sentence was dismissed following a period of time of good conduct. After an arrest
on probable cause (PC) for burglary (BURG) with burglary tool (T), the defendant
was released (REL). A warrant (WAR) was issued and the defendant was probably
summoned to appear. A bench warrant (BW) was issued, normally for failure to ap-
pear. The burglary charge was dismissed (DISM) and reduced to loitering (LOIT),
which must be deduced from the fact that loitering was not charged initially and it
is a logically related but lesser crime. Apparently, the defendant pled guilty to loi-
tering and was sentenced to a thirty-day jail sentence in a local correctional facility
(ACF). Both the sentence and the charge, however, were continued (CONT), held
open, pending good conduct or some other condition, such as attending alcohol
abuse treatment, for a period of time. Once the condition was met, the case was dis-
missed (DISM LOIT). This is a form of diversion. The record comes certified for of-
ficial use in court.
In addition to the NCIC search, most states, counties, and parishes have comput-
erized criminal record indexes for authorized persons or agencies. Most include ar-
rest warrants, and some link to court data, such as pending criminal cases and
scheduled court appearances. Of course traffic records are readily available through
the state’s department of motor vehicles. If thorough searches are required, for ex-
ample, in an attempt to discredit an important opposition witness, it may be best to
employ one of a growing number of commercial agencies. If the defendant comes
from a foreign jurisdiction, contact the police agency in that jurisdiction for assistance.
3.
At the Hearing
If you attend the initial appearance, your task, regardless of which side of the case you
are on, is to summarize the events and outcome for the file. If the defendant is not re-
leased, the defense paralegal needs to facilitate the release by contacting relatives,
asking about property for bail, and performing related tasks. If the defendant is not
able to gain release in the locally specified time, most courts permit a rehearing on the
bail question, sometimes within twenty-four hours, or entertain a motion for reduced
bail. Check local rules.
If a rehearing is denied or the bail is unreasonably high, the defense may appeal the
judge’s decision on bail through an immediate interlocutory appeal. An interlocutory
appeal is an appellate court review of an issue that does not determine guilt or innocence

but is necessary or useful to have decided prior to going to trial. A civil case that has
been extended to the criminal arena, Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp. (1949),
limits these appeals to issues (1) already finally determined by the court, (2) involv-
ing a right that would be lost if it waited for final judgment, and (3) not an ingredient
of the main cause of action. Examples of interlocutory appeals issues include exces-
sive bail and denial of a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds. Most appeals
issues depend on the central action of the trial, however, so they are not handled un-
til after trial.11
INITIAL APPEARANCE CHECKLIST:
PROSECUTION PARALEGAL
❏
1. Acquire a brief background on the defendant from police: nature of charge,
evidence, use of aliases, lack of identification or any false identification, and
other information.
❏
2. Provide prosecutor with an early summary and request guidance on any tac-
tical considerations that may affect the direction and extent of preparation.
❏
3. Assess community sensitivity toward the crime.
❏
4. Obtain criminal record through state and FBI networks: nature of crimes,
penalty, and how satisfied; poor use of jail or prison time; any charges dis-
missed under first offender or other diversion programs; any record of es-
cape, flight, resisting arrest, or failure to appear; any active warrants for
arrest, including from other jurisdictions, or unpaid traffic tickets or violations;
and whether defendant is on probation or parole and any history of violations
(probation office should be able to help).
❏
5. Any history of harassing a victim or tampering with a jury—if the current sce-
nario is one where such is likely.
❏
6. Any information from police, accomplices, friends, or family that indicates de-
fendant is contemplating “skipping.”
❏
7. Residence history: any indication defendant is a transient or otherwise moves
frequently; frequently travels out of jurisdiction or, more importantly, to foreign
countries; is secretive about address to avoid bill collectors, child support, or
other responsibilities; has no phone. If from another jurisdiction, a phone call
to authorities in that jurisdiction might be informative regarding those and
other matters.
❏
8. Family and community ties: any evidence of instability in family relationships or
friendships that would suggest few if any reasons to stay in area; evidence that
acquaintances are gang members, felons, hoods, or other notorious types; or
evidence that there are strong ties elsewhere and the nature of those ties.
❏
9. Employment: any indication that defendant is unemployed; has history of no
or brief employment stints, and reasons for this history (insubordination, in-
competence, alcoholism); lacks employable skills; if migrant worker, may
want to check with previous employers; if defendant is a student, any record
of poor attendance or performance, failure to pay fees, or abusive or dishon-
est behavior toward teachers or fellow students.
❏
10. History of chemical dependency or mental and emotional instability; previous
failure to complete rehabilitation or treatment programs; abuse of medica-
tions or tendency not to take medications essential to rational conduct.

❏
12. Review statutes and rules for any special considerations regarding initial ap-
pearances and bail that give the court authority in special circumstances to
invoke no bail, high bail, or place special conditions on defendant’s release
(see list of conditions in Exhibit 11–2).
❏
13. Record all critical information in the file folder so that any of the office’s pros-
ecutors can pick up the file and be prepared to argue on the bail issue at the
initial appearance (especially important in urban offices).
❏
14. Temper any adversarial recommendations to the prosecutor with legitimate
ethical concerns for fairness and justice.
❏
15. If attending hearing, record results of hearing, name of defense counsel, next
appearance dates, and other information.
❏
16. Obtain a copy of any executed bail instrument from court clerk.
❏
17. Note next appearance date on personal and office calendar system with suf-
ficient lead time dates for adequate preparation.
INITIAL APPEARANCE CHECKLIST: DEFENSE PARALEGAL
❏
1. Determine at outset if any language interpretation will be needed to commu-
nicate adequately with client.
❏
2. Acquire a brief background on defendant through personal interview, from
prosecutor’s office, cooperating police agencies, family, others; nature of al-
leged crime; illegal police search or other factors that may show government’s
case is weak.
❏
3. Provide defense attorney with an early summary and seek guidance regard-
ing special tactical considerations; for example, is it better to leave defendant
in jail for an extra day because judge rotation will give defendant a more fa-
vorable judge, or should immediate pressure be employed for appearance
because today’s judge will be more sympathetic.
❏
4. Assess whether community sensitivity or politics might play a role in judge’s
decision, and if so, brainstorm on how to counter or take advantage of such
considerations.
❏
5. Obtain criminal record initially through client but confirm through prosecutor’s of-
fice, pretrial release officer, or cooperating police agency. Caution: It is best not
to rely exclusively on client’s information; it will frequently be inaccurate. Look for
information on punishment, escape, and so on, but seek an explanation or miti-
gation for unfavorable information. For example, if there is a record of escape, it
may have been induced by homosexual or other abuse by inmates or a concern
over serious family emergency; resisting arrest may have been self-defense in
response to excessive police force or because of a particular arresting officer’s
propensity to provoke resistance in arrestees. Gather information to show client
has appeared when requested to do so, was model prisoner, never fled when re-
leased for work with required return to jail each evening. Note if arrest came as
a result of a voluntary surrender, or if client cooperated with police.
❏
6. Consult with supervising attorney to clear up at the first opportunity any of the
client’s unpaid traffic fines, outstanding warrants, and other matters that will
have a negative impact regarding release.

7. Check residence history: Is there a pattern of stability in residence (owner-
ship of property) or a rational explanation for frequent change in residence or
for being secretive about address; any back-up locations where client can be
found frequently, such as at a relative’s house, a place of employment, or a
cafe; does client have a phone; client’s willingness to avoid out-of-jurisdiction
and out-of-country travel; and willingness to surrender passport.
❏
8. Note family and community ties: Is there any evidence of a stable family, sta-
ble and desirable friendships, religious affiliation and regular attendance, or-
ganizational affiliations, community service projects; local bank accounts and
commercial dealings; reputable persons in community that client believes
might accept custody responsibilities; if from another state, any evidence of
strong ties there that indicate stability and responsibility.
❏
9. Check employment record: Is there any evidence of regular employment
(vouched for by employer), or currently successful educational or vocational
training endeavors; consistency and a pattern of work if a migrant worker; em-
ployable skills; leads for employment and offers of employment; rational rea-
sons for being unemployed, such as disability, medical problems, other
factors; critical and busy time at work—or for family’s sake cannot afford to
miss work. Because an employer’s knowledge of pending criminal charges
could lead to the defendant’s being fired, it is best to get the defendant’s per-
mission to contact the employer.
❏
10. Note any chemical dependency or mental or emotional illness: any evidence
currently seeking treatment, any opportunity to get client into treatment pro-
gram; evidence dependency is a thing of the past or treatment is showing
success; good record of taking medication; strong support groups; and will-
ingness to start or continue treatment, take drug or alcohol tests, stay away
from individuals or locations that tend to encourage dependency.
❏
11. Note any history of possession or misuse of firearms or dangerous weapons.
❏
12. Note any medical condition or handicaps that cannot be adequately ad-
dressed if in jail (a pressing need for medical treatment may cause a judge to
favor release rather than having the county pay for medical treatment).
❏
13. Prepare client for pretrial release officer’s interview and caution client to be
honest but not to discuss the crime with the officer or with anyone except for
attorney or paralegal.
❏
14. Check statutes, rules, and cases for any special circumstances that require
court to favor release, look to least restrictive alternative, or accommodation
of special needs.
❏
15. Contact family, supportive employer, or anyone else who could be helpful at
the initial appearance or bail hearing and arrange for their presence.
❏
16. See that client is afforded the opportunity to appear neat and clean, business
clothes if possible, at the initial appearance.
❏
17. Consider contacting pretrial release officer and see if release recommenda-
tion or evaluation can be tactfully influenced.
❏
18. Note any inability to afford bail beyond a certain amount.
❏
19. Prepare list of special conditions for release that may be a last resort to ob-
tain client’s freedom (see list of conditions in Exhibit 11–2).
❏
20. Determine if client is a foreign national; if so, inform client of the right to con-
tact the respective consulate, and check to see that client has the proper alien
travel and work documents.

III.
PRETRIAL DETENTION
A.
CONDITIONS OF CONFINEMENT
If the defendant is jailed pending trial, issues can arise concerning the conditions of
confinement. Prisoners complain to both prosecution and defense attorneys about
conditions and procedures. Occasionally, it falls to the paralegal to determine if there
is any legal footing for corrective action.
The crux of the matter in these cases is whether the jail conditions or procedures
amount to punishment and, thus, violate due process. A person may not be punished
until convicted. If the condition or procedure is related to a legitimate governmental
purpose, such as security, then it is acceptable under Bell v. Wolfish (1979).
Bell specifically upheld restrictions on literature (except that coming directly
from the publisher), packages, and contact visits. Likewise, random searches of a
cell (Bell), strip and body cavity searches after contact visits (Bell), and the destruc-
tion of legal notebooks and letters in the course of a search [Hudson v. Palmer (1984)]
have been held not to be punishment. Courts have said that juveniles must be sep-
arated from adults, and in most jurisdictions the accused must be separated from the
convicted.
B.
DUTY TO CONFIRM IDENTITY OF DETAINEE
AWashington state case raised the question of whether jailors must identify detainees
who claim they are not the person specified in the warrant that led to their arrest. Rul-
ing in a civil suit for false imprisonment, the Washington Supreme Court held that
there was no duty of a jailor to determine the correct identity of a detainee, merely be-
cause the jailor was put on notice that the person might not be the right person. Once
misidentification has been established, however, the jailor has a duty to act to release
the detainee promptly [Stalter v. State (Wash. 2004)].
C.
TERRORISM AND DETENTION ISSUES
The war on terror has raised detention issues that have forced the U.S. government
and courts to determine whether constitutional protections provided in the tradi-
tional criminal context also apply to U.S. citizens and foreign nationals seized by the
United States in its efforts to combat terrorism. The unifying legal question in this
context is whether the President of the United States, under the war powers granted
in Article II of the Constitution (as a matter of national security and as Commander
in Chief), can retain persons indefinitely and deny them access to U.S. courts.
In holding that the President’s powers do not extend as far as the Bush adminis-
tration had applied them, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that: due process prohibits

410
■
CHAPTER 11
indefinite detention of a U.S. citizen designated by the President as an “enemy com-
batant” and requires a meaningful hearing before a neutral decisionmaker to chal-
lenge the factual basis for that designation [Hamdi v. Rumsfeld (2004)]; U.S. courts have
jurisdiction to hear challenges to the detention of foreign nationals captured abroad
in combat and detained at the Guantanamo Bay military facility in Cuba [Rasul v. Bush
(2004)]; and the Court could not consider, due to a jurisdictional irregularity, whether
a U.S. citizen arrested in the United States can be detained in military custody as an
“enemy combatant” [Rumsfeld v. Padilla (2004)].
D.
ROCKET DOCKETS
Some jurisdictions attempt to limit pretrial detention of defendants in felony cases by
speeding up the resolution of such cases. Rocket docket systems not only shorten jail
time, but can significantly reduce the expense of housing prisoners.
IV.
INTERVIEWING
A.
INTRODUCTION
The next major step in the process is the preliminary hearing. The preliminary hear-
ing requires the state to prove that there is probable cause justifying continued pros-
ecution of the defendant. Both sides must prepare for the hearing.
The prosecution must gather the police reports, talk to the victim, and ensure that
enough witnesses are subpoenaed and enough physical evidence is available to prove
to the satisfaction of the judge that there is probable cause to believe the defendant
committed the alleged crime. The defense also must go into the hearing prepared, and
this preparation begins with the interview of the client.
B.
INTERVIEWING THE DEFENDANT
1.
Preparing the Interview
The initial interview is a critical stage for at least three reasons. First, it will establish the
nature of your relationship with the client and the client’s relationship to your office.
Your goal is to make the client comfortable with the relationship and confident that
matters will be handled competently. Second, the interview starts the investigation
stage, and that leads to the decisions to accept or reject the case and what the nature of
the defense will be. Of course, if the lawyer is a public defender or otherwise appointed,
there is no choice about representation. Third, the fee arrangements are frequently es-
tablished at or as a result of the initial interview. Therefore, careful preparation for this
step is essential. Preparation for the interview should include an examination of appli-
cable ethical considerations, a review of information, and the development of an inter-
view checklist or form and a checklist of items to take to the interview.
Before your first interview, good preparation includes sitting in on several inter-
views with your supervising attorney or another experienced paralegal in the office.
Develop a sense of the difference in time and detail required in the interview for a mi-
nor offense compared to that for a more serious offense.
a. Examine Ethical Considerations
Be conscious of possible ethical and unautho-
rized practice of law pitfalls that apply to an interview situation. Paralegals may in-
terview clients, but only with clear directions from your supervising attorney.
Gathering information rarely, if ever, raises questions about the unauthorized prac-
tice of law. It is in response to the client’s questions or in providing information to the
client that danger arises.

“I get paid for seeing that my
clients have every break the
law allows. I have knowingly
defended a number of guilty
men. But the guilty never es-
cape unscathed. My fees
are sufficient punishment for
anyone.
—F. Lee Bailey, Los Angeles
Times, Jan. 9, 1972
Describing for the client the next court steps (less any evaluation from you as to
the outcome of or strategy to be used at those steps) is no problem. Providing infor-
mation to the client about acceptance of representation, attorney fees, or instructions
on what the client should do, such as advice not to talk to the police about the incident
in question, constitutes legal advice and should be handled by the attorney directly or
through a conduit, such as a preprinted form or information sheet signed by the at-
torney. When such a form is either inappropriate or unavailable, prior authorization
from the attorney to convey specified information provides some protection against
unauthorized practice of law accusations when conveyed in a manner similar to this:
“Ms. Carter has authorized me to convey that you should not speak to the police or
anyone else other than the attorney or me about this incident.” Unanticipated ques-
tions that cannot be handled safely as described here must be referred to the attorney.
b. Review Information on the Case and Relevant Statutes
Newspaper articles and
newscasts often provide preliminary information on the incident and likely charges,
or charges may already have been filed. If you have that information, go to the rele-
vant criminal statutes and note the statutory wording and the elements that must be
proven for each charge. Look up the definitions of key words in the statute and con-
sult case annotations and jury instruction books for judicial interpretation of the
statute. This background helps in asking relevant questions and recognizing critical
information. Also review materials on interviewing, ethics regarding interviewing,
and good listening skills.
c. Locate or Develop a Thorough Interview Form
Most offices have developed a
standardized interview form. Some of these address a brief initial interview; others
go beyond that and attempt to cover as much useful information as possible. Inter-
view forms are valuable guides that promote efficient use of time and provide re-
minders of what to cover. Even the most experienced interviewer will forget to gather
important information without a good form. A thorough, logically developed form
facilitates summarizing the interview and expedites trial preparation. A good form
should cover at least the areas of information addressed in this sample defendant in-
terview checklist. Items requiring attorney authorization are marked with a star.

Introductory Items
❏
*1. Introduce yourself, make your title clear, provide identification, possibly in the
form of a letter from the attorney to the client explaining the paralegal’s role
and the need to be completely open. Find out if the client has any other at-
torney involved or if someone else is contacting an attorney for the client.
❏
2. Ask client for a brief introduction (determine if foreign national).
❏
3. Determine if client has any special needs, medical or otherwise, that need at-
tention, especially if in jail.
❏

d. Develop a Checklist of Items to Take to the Interview
To make sure you have
everything that is needed at the interview site, draft a checklist of necessary items
similar to the one that follows.

414
■
CHAPTER 11
As mentioned in Chapter 8 on prosecution intake, the Health Insurance Portabil-
ity and Accountability Act (HIPAA) imposes strict obligations and procedures on per-
sons seeking and releasing the medical information of another. Therefore, the
authorization for release of medical information mentioned in item 5 of the above
checklist must conform to HIPAAstandards. Exhibit 11-5 is a good example of a release
of information form. It can be adapted to the needs of both prosecution and defense.12
2.
The Interview: Tips and Considerations
Good preparation is important, and the more interviewing you do the less time
preparation will take. As important as preparation is, however, it is critical to see the
client as soon as possible. The client needs to be cautioned about making statements
or having conversations with police, probation and parole officers, cell mates (who of-
ten are or become informants), friends, and even relatives. If applicable, explain that
criminal prosecutions can place considerable strain on the client’s relationships, and
that it is not uncommon for significant others to appear on the prosecution’s witness
list. Stress that no privilege of confidentiality exists between a significant other and
the client, as it does between spouses.
The client needs to know his or her rights. Further, allaying fears makes your
client more comfortable and helps to avoid bizarre and irrational behavior that can
damage the client’s case. If you are not fully prepared, communicate this to the client
in a brief meeting; you can always schedule another interview when you are ade-
quately prepared.
Arrange for an office interview in a confidential and uninterrupted setting. If
the client is in jail, go to the client with all the needed forms and documents that
you have prepared. On entering the jail, be ready to present identification, be
searched (possibly with a metal detector), and sign the register. Also be prepared,
especially on your first visit, for those steel doors to slam shut behind you. It can
be a little unnerving suddenly to realize your liberty is totally dependent on the
jailer. Avoid perceiving the police or jailers as adversaries. They are there to assist
you and, in general, will be courteous and respectful. They deserve the same treat-
ment. Being relaxed yet professional, with appropriate applications of humor, can
work wonders.
In jail, interviews can take place in a small interrogation room, over a phone through
Plexiglas, or some other setting. Regardless, you must insist on a confidential setting. If
one is not made available, consult your supervising attorney before proceeding.
Whether in your office or in jail, it is best if the supervising attorney is present to
start the relationship, make introductions, and explain your role as a paralegal. With
that done, the attorney can move on to other business. Many times it is impractical for
the attorney to be present.
With experience you will develop ideas to add to the checklist of things to keep
in mind during the interview. Review the following checklist on tips for good inter-
viewing techniques.
CHECKLIST ON TIPS FOR BETTER INTERVIEWING
❏
1. Despite your anxiety over doing a good job of interviewing, remind yourself
that the interview is not about your concerns; it is about the client and doing
what you can to help the client.

Pretrial: Initial Appearance to Preliminary Hearing
■415
❏
2. Establish rapport:
Understand client’s apprehensions and feelings: fears of the legal system,
embarrassment, loss of job, prison, and costs; distrusts system, attorney, and
you; feels alone, shamed, and angry.
Empathize, use firm handshake and good eye contact, exude warmth and re-
spect but not submission, be honest, be patient, and avoid being judgmen-
tal, establish a feeling that this is team effort by client and defense.
❏
3. If it is clear the client cannot afford your office’s services or does not agree to
the fee, there is no need to continue unless, of course, you are working for
appointed counsel.
❏
4. Reassure the client that the attorney will be the client’s spokesperson, that
the client should ask questions if something is not clear, and that the client
will be the one to make key decisions and approve important steps during the
representation.
❏
5. Explain the interview process and all the reasons for each part of the interview.
❏
6. Apply your office’s approach to insisting on knowing whether this client actu-
ally committed the crime or not. Some attorneys demand knowing this; oth-
ers do not want clients to tell them if they are guilty or not.Insisting on knowing
guilt or innocence may lock the client into a position that cannot be changed
later, or it may encourage self-deception. Some clients feel that if they imply
they are guilty, the attorney will not be as aggressive in the defense. Explain
that the determination of guilt or innocence is left to the court, but that the in-
formation the client gives you must be accurate. Here is a good example of
what to say:
“In order to prepare the best defense for you, we need to be prepared
for anything that might happen at your trial. . . .
What we want to do is be thoroughly prepared—that means
preparing for the worst. [W]e want everything to be ready. That’s
why I am going to need you to tell me everything you can. If it will
not help your case, we will not use it, but I want to hear it anyway.”13
❏
7. Assessing the client’s goals, especially those of a client with a previous
record, may give you some insight into what can be realistically achieved. As-
sess the client’s eligibility for and interest in drug, gun, or other specialized
court (if available) and related programs.
❏
8. Be positive but realistic; avoid guarantees of success and the raising of false
hopes.
❏
9. Take notes; avoid letting them become too intrusive.
❏
10. Give the client assignments such as getting the names of alibi witnesses and
gathering relevant documents. Insist on regular progress reports.
❏
11. Give a list to the client on what is coming next and when you and the attor-
ney will be contacting the client again. Note this date on office calendar and
be sure to follow up.
❏
12. Handle embarrassing or sensitive topics with empathy but directness.
❏
13. Practice good listening skills:
■Focus on the client’s answer, the manner in which it is given, the inflection and
tone, rather than on what you are going to say or your next question.
■Endure pauses; let the client think.
Continued

CHAPTER 11
■It is okay for you to say “I don’t know” or “Let me think about that” or “I’ll have
to ask the attorney about that.”
■Discriminate between fact and opinion, embellishments and understatement,
and the relevant and irrelevant.
■Discover main ideas, concerns, motivations.
■Probe for sources, credibility, completeness.
■Avoid evaluative feedback and being judgmental; keep an open atmosphere.
■Use “uh-huh” and “hmmm,” nods and smiles to encourage more talking.
■Summarize and restate the client’s points occasionally to ensure clear
communication.
■Be sensitive and understanding; avoid influencing the direction of responses.
■Stay alert; use good eye contact; be attentive.
■Sense and explore feelings.
❏
14. Maximize your effort to get information from your client by probing for selective
perception and expression. People are selective learners who may process in-
formation better through sight, sound, or feeling. If through sight, they will re-
spond best when asked what they saw; if through sound, what they heard; and
if through touch (kinesthetics), what they felt both physically and emotionally in
the experience.14 (Keep these types of learning in mind when your attorney
asks you to help in drafting or evaluating opening and closing statements so
you can suggest approaches for the different types of learners among the jury.)
❏
15. Probe for mental illness or impairment if the client seems out of touch with real-
ity, which may indicate mental illness, emotional problems, retardation, or the ef-
fects of or lack of medication.In such circumstances, ask, “Where are you? What
did you do yesterday? Today? How do you feel? Are you taking medicine?”15
❏
16. Do not tape record or have the client sign a statement. It may be discoverable
by the prosecution.
C.
INTERVIEWING WITNESSES
Many of the tips, techniques, and considerations for defense paralegals apply to pros-
ecution paralegals involved in working with witnesses, whether the police, victims,
or third parties. Prosecution paralegals need to keep in mind that the prosecution of-
fice has many clients. It represents the general public, the victims, the police, and even
victim advocacy groups. The press and its role cannot be ignored either.
In questioning and working with all types of witnesses, you must be sensitive to
their perspectives, while understanding that they rarely have much insight into the
role of the prosecutor, what makes a good case, the rules of evidence, the exclusion-
ary rule, politics, and other factors. None of these people are going to come to you
with an open mind. All want you to adopt their point of view and be a strident, per-
sonal advocate.
You should be sympathetic, but not to the point that you jeopardize your inde-
pendence and objectivity. If necessary, explain this situation to the witness as best you
can. The avenging crusader complex is fraught with problems, as is the defense para-
legal’s pitfall of emotionalizing the defendant’s case. You need to resist these power-
ful seductions in order to ensure the integrity of your work and judgment. Insist on
the truth and probe for all the facts, rather than settling for what the interviewee be-
lieves important. Seek the source and credibility of information. Retain control over
key interviews and be cautious about delegating hearing and trial preparation inter-
“Who lied to me about his
case,
And said we’d have an easy
race,
And did it all with solemn
face?
It was my client.”
—Anonymous

views to other government agencies. For example, unsupervised use of psychologists
and social workers in child molestation cases can result in questionable evidence
built on statements highly influenced and colored by the interviewers and their per-
sonal biases. Innocent lives can be destroyed if this process is not carefully controlled.
D.
ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
You must refrain from the temptation to lead and influence the client or the witness.
To do otherwise ensures altered memories at best and perjury at worst. The other side
almost always questions the witness about such influence. Even if your influence was
not intended to alter the truth, it undermines your case and raises questions about
your integrity. In regard to working with a client or other witness, it is said that pol-
ishing is ethical but sandpapering is not. When one works with the subtleties of com-
munication, the line between polishing and sandpapering is fine.
In an effort to net bigger fish, a prosecution paralegal may be asked to work with
a defendant or participate in the process of determining whether the defendant will
be a good informant and witness against a codefendant. In such circumstances and
when the defendant has a lawyer, this process must be carried on in close consulta-
tion with the defense attorney. Contacting the defendant without the knowledge of
the defense attorney is unethical.
E.
DEALING WITH THE DIFFICULT CLIENT
You will have difficult clients and witnesses. Be ready for the common difficult types.
The abusive person rants, raves, gives orders, demeans, and usually has a volatile
temper. Allowing those persons to vent their anger and express their emotions works
best. When confronted by such a person, realize this is not personal and keep calm.
Let them vent for a brief period of time, suggest that an appointment at another time
would be better to discuss the matter, firmly excuse yourself and vacate the office to
provide a cooling off period, or arrange to have a co-worker telephone you to inter-
rupt the conversation. If the person will not calm down or gets worse, you may have
no choice but to call for assistance of co-workers or the police. Often, a brief phone
call made to a client prior to the initial interview can relieve some of the anxiety that
leads to rude or abusive behavior and may allow you to better anticipate the types of
behavior with which you will have to deal. Ask an irate telephone caller to calm down
or suffer being disconnected.16
Deal with the compulsive drop-in and telephone caller by keeping the person fo-
cused in the first conversation. In subsequent contacts, ascertain whether there is
truly a new problem or whether the goal is simply to pass the time of day by retelling
their story. Identify the immediate problem, what they want to do about it, any rea-
sonable alternatives that they can be responsible for, summarize, and terminate the
conversation.17 Some counselors end these conversations by noting that a preestab-
lished time limit has expired or by getting up and going to the office door to usher the
client out.
Some clients may be the seductive type. They have low self-esteem, appear vul-
nerable, and “cry out” to be cared for or nurtured. This nearly absolute dependency
on the professional person feeds the counselor’s or paralegal’s ego and, if not guarded
against, can lead to emotional and sexual attraction. Occasionally, we read newspaper
reports of the attorney (and maybe the paralegal) who helps a client escape with plans
to join them on Grand Cayman Island or less exotic locations. Some clients read peo-
ple very well and are experienced manipulators. Once the seductive or manipulative
client realizes that you are going to keep an objective and firm professionalism, they
usually are discouraged easily and turn their attentions to the next victim.

CHAPTER 11
ANALYSIS PROBLEM
11–1.
Plan your strategy for dealing with these possible situations with
clients from the cases in Chapter 1.
1.
Eldon Spiers seems very eager to please you. His answers to your ques-
tions vary according to what he seems to think you want to hear, and his
language is childlike. He often reaches over to pat you on the arm or
shoulder.
2.
Carmen Cordoba calls you twice a week to ask about progress in the
prosecution of Miguel Cordoba and to remind you that the ring she
claims he stole is worth $10,000.
3.
Max Legrise never sits down in your office; he paces constantly, occa-
sionally hammering your desk with his fist. With a steely glare, he warns
you not to make mistakes with his case or, “You and your family will re-
gret it.”
4.
Billy McIntire leaves your office after asking you to hide evidence of
drug possession in his home. You find that he has left a small packet of
marijuana on your desk with “thanks” written across the top.
5.
Mason Trew sits sullenly across from you in your office. He “knows”
that the government will not prosecute his case aggressively, “because
the whole community is homophobic,” and refuses to cooperate.
Some clients are sexually aggressive. This may be because of low self-esteem and
the need for positive reenforcement. Any advances need to be met with firm resolve.
Office policy that prohibits dating between professional and client avoids numerous
problems.18
Then there is the client who tempts you with gifts (often contraband), a bribe, or
appealing chemical substances. Most professionals resist these inducements with
ease. Given the right circumstances, such as undue stress, personal financial prob-
lems, or chemical dependency, even a person of previously strong character and con-
siderable experience can succumb to temptation. You must anticipate that such things
will happen and have firm lines drawn in your mind that you will not cross.
Frequently, the line between compassionate, professional advocacy and emo-
tional, personal attachment becomes blurred. When this happens, seek the assistance
of your supervising attorney or other people whose judgment you trust. Do this even
more readily at times of particular personal vulnerability. Keep in mind that the dif-
ficult client is just as much the one who makes you feel omnipotent as the one who
makes you feel inadequate.
Finally, a difficult client, even a difficult co-worker, can become a serious prob-
lem. Every office should have policies and procedures for dealing with such a person.
Some useful resources in this regard include: Coping with Difficult People, Robert N.
Bramson (1988, reissued edition, Dell); Dealing with Difficult People, Rick Brinkman
and Rick Kirschner (2002, second edition, McGraw-Hill); and Risky Business: Manag-
ing Employee Violence in the Workplace, Lynne McClure, Ph.D. (1996, Hayworth Press).
F.
INTERVIEW SUMMARIES
Once key interviews are completed, draft a summary of the information. Place the in-
terview notes and summary into the file and ask if your supervising attorney would
like a copy of the summary. A close rein on such copies is essential, for they have a
way of turning up in the opposition’s case file, which can lead to disaster.

Pretrial: Initial Appearance to Preliminary Hearing
■419
V.
OTHER PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION
AND PREPARATION
A.
DEFENSE
With the approach of the preliminary hearing, the defense team needs to gather
enough information to reveal initial weaknesses in the prosecution’s case and to for-
mulate a possible theory of defense. This information helps you draft questions and
suggests evidence to note at the hearing. Obtain and review the charging document
and any warrants and supporting affidavits. Normally, copies of warrants can be ob-
tained from the court clerk.
The limited time before the hearing often restricts preparation to the client in-
terview, a trip to the scene of the crime, and interviews with one or more key wit-
nesses. Any investigation, however, should be done only with the approval of your
supervisor.
A trip to the scene of the crime as early in the case as feasible is important. It is
best if both you and the attorney can go. Take a digital camera to record various an-
gles of the scene; video cameras are a plus, if available. Tape measures, graph paper
for diagramming, and other materials pertinent to the type of case and location
should be used. If you know the locations of witnesses at the scene, test and photo-
graph the scene from their viewpoints to confirm witness reliability. Try to go to the
scene at the time of day and day of the week the alleged crime occurred. Occasion-
ally lighting, traffic noise, and other factors can affect the credibility of evidence pre-
sented in a case.
Efficiency can be gained by doing some screening of potential witnesses by
phone. It is not necessary to conduct an interview if they do not have useful infor-
mation. When you visit a witness for an interview, ideally, you should take a neutral
party with you to avoid accusations of attempted bribery, threats, or other miscon-
duct. Audiotaping or videotaping an interview can be useful, but should not be done
if the prosecution’s access to such can hurt the defendant. Your objectives should be
clear. Many reluctant witnesses will talk when honestly faced with being subpoenaed
as an alternative. Use the same techniques and cautions outlined in the section on in-
terviewing and working with clients. Interviewing witnesses can be a tricky business.
Entire courses are taught on interviewing and investigation, and these topics are fre-
quently covered at some length in civil litigation courses.
Your supervising attorney may ask you for suggestions on whether the defense
should subpoena any witnesses for the hearing. The defense can use its right under
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 5.1 and similar state rules to present witnesses and
evidence at the preliminary hearing. Because the prosecution will limit its witnesses
to as few as necessary to prove probable cause, there may be other police officers and
witnesses who should be questioned. A subpoena duces tecum may be necessary to
make sure that documents, photos, and other evidence are presented at the hearing, if
they might not be presented otherwise. The defense needs to hear as much of the ev-
idence as possible that is ultimately to be used against the defendant at trial.
B.
PROSECUTION
If you are a prosecution paralegal, it will be your task to organize the proof to be pre-
sented at the preliminary hearing. Police reports need to be reviewed. The victim or
a key witness may need to be interviewed. Any information suggesting the existence
of a defense or that the defendant is not the right suspect should be pursued. After all,
if the case has gaping holes or has been improperly brought against the defendant,
this is the best time to find that out and save everyone a lot of trouble, time, and
money. Note the available physical evidence, such as a weapon, seized contraband,
photos of the scene, a fingerprint match, or other items.

420
■
CHAPTER 11
Screen this information, summarize it, and check with your supervising attorney
to verify what evidence or testimony will be needed at the hearing. Keep in mind that
good prosecution tactics call for producing only enough evidence to show probable
cause, while not revealing any more than is necessary at this stage.
The police need to be informed of the time of the hearing and what evidence they
should bring. You can also remind them to review their reports. The key witnesses
should be subpoenaed. Witnesses friendly to the prosecution and the victim should
also be subpoenaed to reduce the risk of embarrassing no-shows. The subpoenas can
be mentioned in court should the witness or the victim want to appear as neutral in
the case as possible. The appearance of neutrality may be desirable if the witness or
victim is a friend or relative of the defendant.
The victim should be informed about the hearing and what to expect. Some in-
office preparation of the victim may be needed with the attorney if the case is highly
significant and the victim’s testimony will be subject to intense cross-examination at
trial.
C.
PREPARING QUESTIONS FOR THE
PRELIMINARY HEARING
Enlightened supervising attorneys have learned that good paralegals do a thorough
job of proposing and drafting useful questions for both direct questioning and cross-
examination. If your supervising attorney is one of the enlightened, you have an in-
teresting task ahead of you. If not, try to convince your supervisor that you can be of
real assistance here. You might also try your hand at drafting some questions, then
submit them to convince your supervisor of your ability to do the job.
If you are drafting questions for the prosecutor, keep these tips in mind.
1.
The prosecution’s burden of proof is probable cause or reasonable grounds
to believe the crime has been committed and that the defendant committed
the crime, a more stringent burden than that required for an arrest. It is
considerably less of a burden, however, than the proof beyond a
reasonable doubt required for conviction at trial.
2.
Evidentiary standards are more lenient at the preliminary hearing than at
trial. Evidence that might be suppressed later and hearsay evidence may
be admitted.
3.
Questions must elicit evidence in support of each element of the alleged
crime.
4.
Questions to witnesses must be direct (“What did you see?”) and not
leading (“You saw the knife, didn’t you?”). A leading question suggests
the answer.
5.
The question should elicit enough evidence to meet the prosecution
burden of proof, but no more. There is no need to assist the defense at this
stage of the process by showing all of your cards.
If you are drafting questions for the defense, keep the following tips in mind.
1.
Neither federal nor state rules permit the defense to use the preliminary
hearing for unlimited discovery. In other words, the defense may not use
the hearing to go on a fishing expedition by asking every conceivable
question that might reveal information helpful to the defendant. Just how
much the defendant may use the preliminary hearing for finding out about
the prosecution’s case varies. The trend seems to be to confine the hearing
strictly to a determination of the burden of proof. Some state rules
specifically prohibit the use of the hearing for discovery. The federal rules
have been interpreted both ways, but do not specifically rule out such use.

Pretrial: Initial Appearance to Preliminary Hearing
■421
Some discovery related to exploring the prosecution’s case as presented is
probably permissible.
2.
Your questions will be used to cross-examine the government’s witnesses.
The goal is to test for truth and accuracy. Because the prosecution
witnesses are presumed by law to be adverse to the defense, leading
questions are permitted.
3.
Your questions should test the source and basis for each piece of evidence
presented. Attempt to bring out evidence favorable to the client that might
raise judicial doubt about probable cause, or at least reveal areas to be
pursued in discovery or at trial.
4.
The questions should attempt to reveal possible police misconduct, such as
an illegal arrest or search, if the judge will permit such questions.
Sometimes you can draft questions that have a dual purpose—to get at the
source of the evidence while also revealing police misconduct or other
evidence favorable to the client.
5.
The questions should explore possible theories of defense, but not so
blatantly as to tip the hand of the defense.
6.
Questions should be designed to lock the witness into a position that is
favorable to the client and that, if changed, can be used at trial to show
inconsistencies and inaccuracies that throw doubt on the reliability of the
witness’s testimony. An example of such questioning is, “Officer Johnson,
the defendant made no other statements to you or anyone else in your
presence, is that correct? You are unaware of any other statements made by
the defendant?”
When you draft questions for hearings, review the charge and the evidence likely
to be presented on each element. Make sure you thoroughly understand the defini-
tions of each key term in the statute. Then use a tape recorder and a brainstorming
process to generate every conceivable question. Have these questions entered into a
computer and eliminate those you do not want. This method of generating questions
has proven to be effective for most types of hearings, depositions, and trials. A pros-
ecution paralegal must recheck the final list of questions to be sure that enough evi-
dence will be elicited on each element of the crime.
VI.
PRELIMINARY HEARING
The preliminary hearing is an early step in the criminal litigation process that permits
the continuation of the charge against the defendant only if the judge (or federal mag-
istrate judge) finds that the prosecution has presented evidence showing probable
cause to believe that a crime was committed and that the defendant committed the
crime. It is a judicial test to provide assurance that a criminal charge is founded in re-
liable evidence of probable guilt. Although frequently given short shrift by the media
and rarely understood by the general public, the stage is an important one demon-
strating a commitment to the sensitive balance between convicting criminals and pro-
tecting personal liberty.
A preliminary hearing is not constitutionally mandated [Lem Woon v. Oregon
(1913)]. Nearly all jurisdictions, however, require a preliminary hearing in felony
cases. An exception exists in the federal system and some states if the defendant
has already been indicted by a grand jury on the charge. Grand jury procedure is
covered in Chapter 12. The preliminary hearing date is set at the initial appear-
ance. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 5.1(c) and similar state rules require
that the preliminary hearing be held within ten days of the initial appearance if

process.
the defendant is in jail and within twenty days if not. These time limits are ex-
tended only if the defendant agrees to the extension or the state demonstrates an
extraordinary reason for the delay.
The hearing is held in court before a judge or magistrate judge, and it is adver-
sarial in nature. The prosecution presents only the witnesses necessary to meet the
burden of proof. The defendant has the right to an attorney [Coleman v. Alabama
(1970)], the right to cross-examine the prosecution’s witnesses, and the right to testify
and present witnesses. Normally, the defense does not present any evidence or wit-
nesses, but may do so in those rare instances where assertion of key facts such as ev-
idence supporting affirmative defenses is likely to lead to a permanent dismissal of
the charge.
The preliminary hearing is open to the public and the press. Occasionally, a judge
will be asked to close the hearing. In a case where the judge closed a preliminary hear-
ing to assure that the defendant would subsequently get a fair trial, the U.S. Supreme
Court held that the press and the public had the right of access to the hearing under
the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution [Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court
(1984)]. The Court allowed closure only where a higher value than First Amendment
access could be demonstrated and where closure was narrowly tailored to serve that
higher value.
If you are asked to attend the preliminary hearing, you can head off possible mis-
understanding and discontent among those in attendance. If you work for the prose-
cution, explain to the victim the purpose of the hearing, and why the prosecutor will
not be putting in all available evidence and calling all available witnesses. If you work
for the defense, explain to the client and possibly close friends or family in attendance
why the defense attorney may be calling witnesses and eliciting evidence that seems
harmful to the defendant, and why the attorney is not objecting more at the hearing.
Otherwise, your role is to take notes on the evidence presented, whether the court
finds probable cause, and on what charge. The court can modify or lessen the charge.
Afterward, key testimony from the hearing needs to be highlighted and summarized.
You may be asked to draft a request for a copy of the hearing tape or transcript, and
to summarize it for your supervising attorney.
If the court finds that probable cause exists, the case is transferred to a district
judge for trial in the federal system or the designated trial court in the state system.
This process is called binding over when a case is transferred to the next court for the
succeeding stage in the process. In some jurisdictions, a defendant is bound over to
the grand jury. In others, an information is drafted by the prosecution office and pre-
sented to the defendant at the next step, which is the arraignment.
If the evidence is found to be inadequate, the judge can dismiss the case and dis-
charge the defendant. No jeopardy attaches at this stage, so charges may be brought
again if new evidence warrants it. If the government intends to recharge, most juris-
dictions permit the holding of the defendant for a reasonable period of time, in some
cases up to seventy-two hours. If no charges are brought by the time the statutory
limit expires, the defendant is freed. Bail is often reconsidered at the conclusion of the
preliminary hearing and the attorneys on either side need to be prepared for further
argument on that point. Exhibit 11–6 is an example of a motion to reduce bond. It can
be argued at the close of the preliminary hearing or presented to the court at any time
it becomes apparent the defendant is unable to make bond. The standards regarding
bail addressed in the motion are a good focal point for preparing arguments on bail
for the initial appearance or any subsequent motion to reduce bail.

Pretrial: Initial Appearance to Preliminary Hearing
■423
extradition:
the process that provides for
a fugitive from justice from
one state to be arrested in
another state and be
returned to the original state
for trial.
VII.
EXTRADITION
Article Four, Section Two, of the Constitution provides for a fugitive from justice from
one state to be arrested in another state and be returned to the original state for trial.
This process is called extradition and is governed by 18 U.S.C.A. § 3182. Most states
have adopted the Uniform Extradition Law, which defines the procedure. Generally,
the governor of the original state signs a requisition warrant that verifies the pending
charge, identifies the fugitive, and requests that the fugitive be arrested and delivered
to the agents of the original state. The governor of the asylum state provides notice of
the fugitive’s detention. Officers from the original state then must pick up the fugi-
tive within thirty days of the arrest.
The government must prove, and the defendant can challenge, only four issues
in an extradition proceeding: (1) whether the extradition documents have been prop-
erly prepared and executed, (2) whether the defendant has been charged with a crime
in the demanding state, (3) whether the defendant is the person named in the docu-
ments, and (4) whether the defendant is a fugitive from the demanding state [Michi-
gan v. Doran (1978)]. Even if the asylum state’s court finds that the person has been
treated unfairly in the demanding state and will be subject to discrimination, the asy-
lum state court cannot refuse to return the fugitive. The Supreme Court ruled that
these issues cannot be addressed by the asylum state [New Mexico v. Reed (1998)]. The
fugitive must be returned.
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 5(c)(3) addresses what is necessary before a de-
fendant arrested in one federal district can be transferred to the federal district where
the alleged crime was committed. Extradition is usually sought only in serious cases.
Extradition may be the sole reason the defendant has been arrested; however, the issue
of extradition often arises in the context of a prosecution of the defendant on charges in
the asylum state. Provisions are also provided for extradition from territories and for-
eign countries that have signed extradition treaties with the United States. Despite such
treaties, twenty countries that have outlawed the death penalty, including Mexico, re-
fuse to extradite fugitives from the United States who are charged with capital crimes.19
VIII.
CONCLUSION
Although overshadowed at times by popular emphasis on the trial, the pretrial stage
is often where cases are won or lost. Prosecutors have the duty to bring criminal
charges but must be cautious to avoid defense challenges of double jeopardy, im-
proper joinder, and other grounds for dismissal.
Preparation must be made for the initial appearance, including investigation into
the defendant’s background to find reasons why he or she should be jailed or freed
until trial. Forms should be gathered and checklists created to guide you through each
task. Interviewing skills need to be developed, as well as methods for dealing with
difficult clients. At the initial appearance, the judge informs the defendant of the
charge and the right to an attorney, and determines whether the defendant will be re-
leased on bail.
The next stage is the preliminary hearing, where the government must prove
probable cause to retain the defendant. You can play a vital role in preparing ques-
tions for witnesses and evidence for presentation. Fugitives can be brought back for
trial from other states by extradition.

MOTION TO REDUCE BOND
VS. ____________________
DEFENDANT
Defendant, by counsel, moves the Court to reduce bond, currently set at _____ _____, to _____, and as
grounds states:
1. Defendant is charged with _____, has been in jail for _____ _____, and has been unable to post bond as it is
currently set.
2. Columbia Revised Statute § 876.439 sets out the following standards for setting bail: (state relevant statutory or
case standards)
3. Regarding Standard One (e.g., to insure compliance with conditions set by the Court): The amount of the pro-
posed reduced bond will be sufficient to insure defendant’s compliance with the conditions set by the court be-
cause forfeiture of $_____ will be a significant loss to the defendant and his family. Further, the Defendant
understands that failure to comply with the set conditions will result in forfeiture and return to jail.
4. Regarding Standard Two (e.g., bond should not be oppressive): (state relevant constitutional, case law, or rule
of court) state that “bail shall not be excessive” nor shall it be oppressive. The current bond is well beyond De-
fendant’s financial means (as explained below), and is therefore excessive and oppressive.
5. Regarding Standard Three (e.g., bond should be commensurate with gravity of the offense): Because the De-
fendant is not charged with a violent crime, because the state’s Uniform Bail Schedule states a recommended
amount of _____, and because of Defendant’s inability to pay a higher amount, the proposed reduction in bond
adequately reflects the gravity of the offense.
6. Regarding Standard Four (e.g., Criminal Record and Failure to Appear): The Defendant has been convicted of
one disorderly conduct and three DUI’s.Three of these offenses occurred more than four years ago, and the De-
fendant appeared in court when required to do so.
7. (State any other standards and grounds, including financial ability.)

CHAPTER 12
I.
INTRODUCTION
The preliminary hearing has established probable cause to keep the defendant under
prosecution. Now you are ready to assist in preparing the case for the significant steps
that remain before trial. Your team will guide the case through the processes of grand
jury, arraignment, and pretrial conference. Success depends on preparation for these
appearances, as well as research, document preparation, investigation, calendaring
involved in the intervening indictment and information, discovery, pretrial motions,
plea bargaining, and assurance of a speedy trial. At each level, you also strengthen the
case for trial.
As the case takes shape in this pretrial stage, your tasks require precision and effi-
ciency. You have a significant role to play in translating textbooks, law codes, and rules
of procedure into justice for a defendant, for a victim, and for the community at large.
II.
GRAND JURY AND INDICTMENT
A.
INTRODUCTION
The grand jury is a body of citizens that hears evidence regarding possible criminal
activity and decides whether that evidence is sufficient to bring an accused to trial. It
is designed to protect citizens from unfounded and unnecessary government charges.
The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution states:
No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a
presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury. . . .
This right is not imposed on the states [Hurtado v. California (1884)], but many state
constitutions and statutes incorporate grand jury proceedings for felonies (“infamous
crime”). Some states, particularly midwestern ones, rely almost exclusively on the
preliminary hearing as an intermediate step toward trial. Others employ a prelimi-
nary hearing for bind over to a grand jury. The federal system requires either one or
the other, but not both. In federal practice, capital cases must be prosecuted by in-
dictment from a grand jury. Charges with possible sentences of a year or more in
prison or hard labor also must proceed by indictment or, only if the defendant waives
indictment, by an information from a preliminary hearing. Other federal offenses
may be prosecuted by either indictment or information.
Even where states use the preliminary hearing to send cases to the grand jury,
prosecutors have the option of bypassing the preliminary hearing and submitting a
case directly to the grand jury. This is called a direct submission. In some jurisdic-
tions the grand jury is required or used extensively; in others it is used rarely or has
been discontinued.
Thegrandjuryhasthreefunctions:charging,investigating,andsupervising.Charg-
ing is the issuing of an indictment, the grand jury’s equivalent of a criminal complaint,
against a specific person targeted by the prosecutor for a specific crime. Investigating en-
tails inquiring into an entire area of suspicious activity to see if any wrongdoing has oc-
curred and, if so, by whom. The third function involves the grand jury’s authority to
oversee and issue reports on the local jail and other public offices and officials.
B.
COMPOSITION
The grand jury was named for its large number of jurors. Rule 6 of the Federal Rules
of Criminal Procedure requires not less than sixteen nor more than twenty-three ju-
rors, with at least twelve members agreeing to obtain an indictment. The composition
of state grand juries varies in the respective numbers, but at least a majority must
agree to indict. Jurors must be selected from a cross-section of the community, and the
direct submission:
bypassing the preliminary
hearing and submitting a
case directly to the grand
jury.

Pretrial: Grand Jury to Pretrial Conference
■439
unjustified systematic exclusion of any group (by race, sex, occupation, and other fac-
tors) may subject the grand jury process to attack on the grounds of a denial of equal
protection or a violation of the Sixth Amendment guarantee of a “fair cross-section”
of the community [Taylor v. Louisiana (1975), Hobby v. U.S. (1984), and Batson v. Ken-
tucky (1986)]. In Campbell v. Louisiana (1998) the Supreme Court ruled that a white de-
fendant had standing to allege the racially motivated exclusion of African Americans
in selecting grand jury members for the purpose of challenging his indictment. Such
a deficiency can lead to the overturning of any subsequent conviction, as in Castaneda
v. Partida (1977) where the conviction of a Mexican American was overturned because
Mexican Americans were grossly underrepresented on the indicting grand jury. To-
day, most jurors are selected at random from voter and driver’s license lists through
the use of computers and other objective processes. A change in Rule 6 of the Federal
Rules of Criminal Procedure makes it easier for hearing and speaking impaired per-
sons to serve on grand juries through the use of interpreters.
C.
POWERS
The powers of the grand jury make it an effective weapon for investigating crime; it
has also drawn criticism for abuse of those powers. Grand juries can subpoena wit-
nesses, data, and documents without showing probable cause, which neither the
prosecution nor the police may do on their own. This power is restricted by a some-
what vague and inconsistent standard that permits the quashing (voiding) of an un-
reasonable demand. In U.S. v. R. Enterprises, Inc. (1991), the Supreme Court reversed
a lower court’s quashing of a broadly worded subpoena for a variety of corporate
books and records. The grand jury hoped to gain information about the sale of sexu-
ally explicit materials. The Court said that any challenge to a grand jury subpoena
based on relevancy will be denied unless the complaining party can show that there
is “no reasonable possibility” that the requested material will produce information
relevant to the general subject of the investigation.
In contrast, a grand jury subpoena issued to an attorney requesting all documents
relating to fee arrangements and trust accounts of specified clients that included a
provision for in camera, in chambers, screening of the documents for privileged ma-
terial was held to violate the attorney-client privilege and was unduly burdensome
absent a good faith effort by the government to issue a more narrow subpoena [In re
Grand Jury Subpoena Issued to Horn (9th Cir. 1992)]. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure
17 and parallel state rules cover grand jury subpoenas.
Special terminology applies to witnesses subpoenaed by grand juries. A “wit-
ness” is simply a person who is called to provide information but is in no way sus-
pected of wrongdoing. A “subject witness” is one who may be involved in some
wrongdoing but is not the focus of the investigation. The “target witness” is the spe-
cific focus of the investigation and the person most likely to be indicted.
Grand juries can request the court to hold a witness or custodian of evidence in
contempt of court for failure to appear or produce the requested evidence, for being
unresponsive to questions, or for refusing to answer questions altogether. The court
can impose criminal contempt with possible jail time or civil contempt requiring pay-
ment of a fine.
A grand jury witness may exercise the privilege against self-incrimination
[Lefkowitz v. Turley (1973)]. If a witness refuses to testify, the grand jury can request
that the witness be granted immunity (18 U.S.C.A. §§ 6002–6003). This request is
likely only if the witness invokes his or her right against self-incrimination. As ex-
plained in Chapter 10 on interrogation and confessions, the court or the government
in some jurisdictions can grant use or transactional immunity. Once immunity is
granted, a recalcitrant witness is subject to contempt of court.
With these investigative powers, the grand jury can be a potent player in the crim-
inal justice system. Its authority to question people, search for and seize evidence, and
quash:
void an unreasonable
demand.

go on nearly unlimited fishing expeditions raises the concern, however, that the
grand jury may be a serious threat to individual rights.
D.
AUTONOMY AND SECRECY
In order to work effectively as a check on unreasonable or unfounded government
charges, the grand jury is, in theory, an autonomous institution. It is to be indepen-
dent of the prosecutor and other outside influences. Therefore, prosecutors are to
serve only as advisors and facilitators for the grand jury, and not as adversaries for in-
dictment. Congruently, the grand jury’s meetings are closed, and all participants are
instructed to keep the proceedings secret. Membership on the jury is kept secret, thus
insulating the jury from public pressure, intimidation, or reprisals [U.S. v. Proctor &
Gamble Co. (1958)]. Secrecy also protects the reputation of the unindicted and shelters
witnesses from reprisal for what they might say [Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. v. U.S.
(1959)]. Despite these safeguards, information is often leaked to the media. Those
bound to secrecy are listed in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e)(2)(B), and Rule
6(e)(3) sets out the exceptions. The exceptions were recently expanded by the
PATRIOT Act to permit disclosure pertinent to foreign or counterintelligence [Fed. R.
Crim. P. 6(e)(3)(D)]. A case in California where a grand jury proceeding was opened
to the public may lead to other public grand jury proceedings.1
Prosecutors have been known to exercise such great influence over grand juries
that they may become little more than a rubber stamp of the prosecutor’s objectives.
In one study, the average time regularly used by the grand jury to hear evidence and
deliberate was five minutes per case.2 Consequently, some jurisdictions have turned
almost exclusively to the preliminary hearing, whereas others have attempted to pro-
vide some balance by permitting the presence of defense counsel, who traditionally
have been excluded [Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(d)(1)].
E.
PROCEDURE
Once the grand jury is selected, it convenes at the time designated by the court. Jurors
serve until discharged by the court. In the federal system, the maximum length of ser-
vice is eighteen months, unless extended by the court for no more than six months [Fed.
R. Crim. P. 6(g)]. Special grand juries convened to hear particularly complex matters or
to conduct an extensive investigation may be selected for as long as thirty-six months.
The judge instructs the jurors on their duties and the secrecy of the procedure, and pro-
vides for transcription or recording of the hearing.Aforeperson is either selected by the
grand jury or appointed by the court, depending on the jurisdiction. The jury meets with
the prosecutor and, generally, a court reporter. An interpreter can be present as needed.
The prosecutor may present evidence and question the witnesses. The target wit-
ness or accused has no right to appear but may be subpoenaed to do so. Occasionally,
a grand jury may honor the target witness’s request to testify. Traditionally, the accused
or other witness does not have the right to counsel or to confrontation [In re Groban’s
Petition (1957) and U.S. v. Mandujano (1976)]. Most jurisdictions, however, permit tar-
get and other witnesses to suspend proceedings to leave the hearing room to consult
counsel on a particular question. A witness’s counsel may be present under Federal
Rule 6(d) and similar state rules. When the prosecution has finished questioning, the
jurors may ask questions. If the jurors feel they need to hear some particular evidence,
they may request the prosecutor to secure the evidence through subpoena. If a witness
is granted immunity and still refuses to testify, the witness can be incarcerated for con-
tempt. Such incarceration can be based on the aim to coerce the witness’s testimony [In
re Grand Jury Proceedings of the Special April Grand Jury (7th Cir. 2003)].
The normal rules of evidence do not apply to grand jury proceedings. Illegally ob-
tained evidence [U.S. v. Calandra (1974)] and hearsay [Costello v. U.S. (1956)] are nor-
mally admissible. Privileges such as priest-penitent, husband-wife, and others,
“Today, the grand jury is the
total captive of the prosecu-
tor who, if he is candid, will
concede that he can indict
anybody, at any time, for al-
most anything, before any
grand jury.”

however, may not be violated [Branzburg v. Hayes (1972)]. The quantum of evidence
needed for the return of an indictment varies. Traditionally, it is enough evidence to
prove that the defendant is probably guilty of the crime. Other jurisdictions apply a
prima facie standard. This means that enough evidence has been presented on each
element of the crime, absent any evidence of refutation, to conclude that the defen-
dant is guilty. Of the two burdens, the prima facie standard is more stringent, closer
to “beyond a reasonable doubt,” the burden of proof at trial. If instructed properly, a
grand jury votes against indictment unless the required quantum of evidence is pres-
ent, thus eliminating insubstantial or otherwise unwarranted charges. Reread People
v. Goetz in Chapter 7 for a discussion of the differences in the level of instruction be-
tween grand jury and petit jury.
After the presentation of evidence, the jury deliberates in secret, makes a decision,
and communicates that decision to the prosecutor. If the jury votes not to indict, an or-
der of dismissal, sometimes called no bill, is entered. If the vote is to indict, the indict-
ment is drafted by the prosecutor. The indictment must be endorsed as a true bill, be
signed by the foreperson, and may need to include the names of the witnesses who tes-
tified.Oncetheappropriatedocumentispresentedtothejudge,thejurorsaredismissed.

THE PARALEGAL’S ROLE: PROSECUTION3
If you are in a jurisdiction where a felony goes to preliminary hearing before submis-
sion to a grand jury, you probably attended the preliminary hearing as covered in
Chapter 11. Information gleaned at this hearing helps the prosecutor decide which
witnesses to subpoena and what questions to ask at the grand jury hearing of the
same case. A tape or transcript may be obtainable if you cannot attend the prelimi-
nary hearing.
Open a file on the case and enter police reports; media reports; and copies of court
documents including bond papers, the accused’s criminal record, and certified copies
of the judgments of felony convictions (needed for persistent felony counts or later at
sentencing). If requested to do so, prepare a grand jury docket that lists pending cases,
meeting dates and times, and witnesses. Cross-check with the clerk of court and
judge’s calendar. Draft subpoenas and give them to the sheriff or other official re-
sponsible for service on the witnesses. Exhibit 12–1 presents a copy of part of a pre-
pared grand jury docket,4 and Exhibit 12–2 shows a copy of a grand jury subpoena. A
subpoena can order not only the appearance of a witness, but also, through a subpoena
duces tecum, the production of “any books, papers, documents, data, or other objects”
[Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(1)]. The subpoena duces tecum must be reasonably particular in
its description of what is to be produced and the time period covered. For example, a
subpoena for all tax records for the past twenty-five years would be unreasonable.
Carelessly drafted subpoenas may be quashed (voided) by the court in response to the
witness’s motion to quash [Rule 17(c)(2)]. When properly subpoenaed items arrive at
the court, the court may permit the parties to inspect the materials [Rule 17(c)(1)].
Here are some tips regarding subpoena practice:
■
Persons or materials should be subpoenaed only to the court and not to an
attorney’s office, unless it is for a court-ordered deposition.
■
Court subpoenaed materials mistakenly delivered to an attorney’s office
should not be opened or disposed of as an attorney sees fit, but delivered to
the court.
■
A child witness is normally subpoenaed through the custodial parent or
guardian, but check local rules.
■
Whether served by a law enforcement officer or an individual (depending
on jurisdictional practice), it is not necessary to physically place the sub-
poena in the person’s hand.
■
A copy of the delivered subpoena does not have to be filed with the court to
be binding.
“There is nothing more horri-
ble than the murder of a
beautiful theory by a brutal
gang of facts.”

CHAPTER 12
■
A federal subpoena may be served on a witness anywhere in the United
States, and a state subpoena anywhere in that state.
■
Even if it is later decided that the subpoenaed witness is not going to testify,
only the court can discharge the witness.5
Notify the grand jurors of the meeting or see to it that the clerk of court does. Draft
any proposed indictment if requested to do so. The indictment should state each ele-
ment of the crime and not simply quote the statute number. Failure to do so could re-
sult in dismissal [U.S. v. Cabrera-Teran (5th Cir. 1999) and U.S. v. Pickett (D.C. Cir.
2004)]. In Pickett, the indictment was dismissed for omitting some key statutory lan-
guage. Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 7 and 8 and parallel state rules govern the
required contents of an indictment and the joinder of crimes in an indictment. Rule 7
was amended to permit indictment in some circumstances on the basis of an unknown
person’s DNA profile only [Rule 7(c)(1)]. Because of the decision in U.S. v. Booker
(2005) (see Chapter 14), indictments should contain facts that support sentence en-
hancements so they can be considered by the jury. Refer to the section in Chapter 8 on
drafting a criminal complaint for additional drafting suggestions. Exhibit 12–3 is an
indictment form. You may also be asked to assist witnesses, see that any physical ev-
idence is present, draft proposed questions, and record the hearing if it is otherwise
not transcribed. Once the grand jury makes its decision, draft the order of dismissal
or the true bill.
Next, notify victims, defense attorneys, witnesses, and police officers of the re-
turned indictment. Notification may be made by letter or phone. You may also need
to draft warrants for arrest.
G.
THE PARALEGAL’S ROLE: DEFENSE
As previously stated, a client may be subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury for a
variety of reasons. Your supervising attorney may call the prosecutor to determine if
your client is a “nonsuspect” witness. Some prosecutors are willing to send a letter
verifying such that will put the client’s mind at ease.6 If the client has never appeared
before a grand jury, you may assist by providing information to your client about the
grand jury and what to expect. If such information is provided frequently, prepare a
brochure or brief video for your clients’ information.
You may be asked to prepare a subpoena or review one for reasonableness and
research grounds to quash the subpoena (see previous section for grounds to quash).
Draft the motion to quash if requested. If your client has received a subpoena duces
tecum, you may be asked to arrange with the prosecutor’s office and with the court’s
permission to surrender the documents to a designated person and save your client
from having to appear.7
Occasionally, it is in the best interest of a client to testify before a grand jury, even
when the client is not subpoenaed to do so. For example, the defendant may be able
to testify that the government’s key witness has a criminal record and has perjured
himself previously. Such evidence may cause the government to lose its zeal to pros-
ecute. Under this circumstance, you may be asked to draft a Notice of Defendant’s Re-
quest to Present Evidence Before the Grand Jury. This is submitted to the prosecutor
with a copy to the clerk and the judge. It is read to the grand jury, which decides
whether they want the client present.
You may be asked to assist the attorney in preparing a client for testifying. Con-
sider the following topics to cover.
1.
Have the client review copies of documents that have been produced to
the jury.
2.
Review likely areas of questioning.
3.
Instruct the client on the importance of the oath and telling the truth.

Pretrial: Grand Jury to Pretrial Conference
■443
4.
Instruct the client on the right to consult the attorney outside the jury room
and that consultation is accomplished by making a clear request to the
foreperson.
5.
Reinforce the attorney’s instructions on the right against self-incrimination,
including the right to refuse to produce some documents that by their very
production are incriminating [See U.S. v. Doe (1984) and Fisher v. U.S.
(1976)].8
Once your office becomes aware of a grand jury investigation, it is necessary to
monitor the investigation. Monitoring is done by debriefing your client following his
or her testimony. Some attorneys contact other witnesses. If you are asked to make the
contact, always do so through the witness’s attorney. Accusations against you for in-
timidation and obstruction of justice are possible.9 The defense can start a complete,
independent investigation as well.
When the indictment is issued, review it. Each element of the crime should be
stated, not simply statute number. The indictment must put the defendant on notice
of the charges. If it does not, it is subject to attack via the motion to dismiss. Confirm
the eligibility, composition, and selection of the jurors for a possible motion to dismiss
the indictment. Draft the motion consistent with the applicable rules of procedure
[Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(b)(2)]. These same objections can be raised prior to the impaneling
of the jurors [Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(b)(1)]. Exhibit 12–4 is an example of a motion to dis-
miss an indictment.
Because indictments are brief, most jurisdictions provide for a bill of particulars.
A bill of particulars is a document provided by the prosecution on request from the
defense, detailing the when, where, and how of the crime charged in the indictment
[Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(f)]. A bill of particulars may be requested before or within ten days
after the arraignment. It can help the defense determine what to plead; ascertain pos-
sible defenses such as double jeopardy, alibi, and statute of limitations; and otherwise
prepare a defense. If requested to do so, draft a motion for a bill of particulars. An ex-
ample of the motion is provided in Exhibit 12–5. Exhibit 12–6 is an example of the gov-
ernment’s bill of particulars.
A good defense team also does everything possible to obtain a copy of the grand
jury record. To do so lessens the prosecutor’s advantage from being involved in the
hearing and observing all the witnesses and evidence. Further, review of critical tes-
timony may lay the groundwork for impeaching a government witness whose trial
testimony is inconsistent with testimony given at the grand jury. Despite secrecy,
grand jury records have become increasingly available to the defense. Federal Rule
of Criminal Procedure 16(a)(3) and the Jenks Act, 18 U.S.C.A. §§ 3500(b) and
3500(e)(3), require the state to provide the defense with a copy of the grand jury tes-
timony of any witness after direct examination of that witness at trial. Because that
causes delay during the trial while the transcript is reviewed by the defense, some
prosecutors and judges prefer to disclose the information sooner. A petition for dis-
closure can be filed under Rules 6(e)(3)(F) and (G). A defense letter requesting the
record, accompanied by a blank tape or computer disk, is one method to obtain the
record. Go to the custodian of the record and do the copying yourself, if necessary.10
As a matter of fairness, evidence against a target witness should be brought be-
fore a grand jury promptly. Charges against an accused will be dismissed and a con-
viction overturned if the defendant can show that the preindictment delay was a
prosecutorial tactic to gain some advantage over the defendant and the delay caused
actual prejudice to the defense. For example, a prosecutorial delay in bringing a child
rape charge, which resulted in a loss of juvenile jurisdiction over the case, did preju-
dice the defendant in State v. Brandt (Wash. App. 2000). A conviction in an incest case
was not reversed for a six-year preindictment delay in Commonwealth v. Richardson
(Mass. App. 2000), however, because the defendant failed to show evidence of “dila-
tory tactics” or a prejudice to his defense.

CHAPTER 12
III.
THE INFORMATION
In non–grand jury jurisdictions when cases go to arraignment by bind over from the
preliminary hearing, or where the defendant waives indictment, the appropriate
charging document is called the information. The rules of most states parallel Federal
Rule 7, requiring a document with the same essential contents as an indictment. The
prosecution paralegal can draft the information using the same approach as that for
drafting indictments and criminal complaints. Indictments and informations must be
filed with the clerk of the appropriate trial court.
The court may permit an information to be amended at any time before verdict or
finding if no additional or different offense is charged and if substantial rights of the
defendant are not prejudiced.
—Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(e)
IV.
ARRAIGNMENT
A.
INTRODUCTION
Arraignment follows the issuing of the indictment or information and is an appear-
ance of the defendant before a judge. The purpose of the arraignment is to inform the
defendant of the charge, enter a plea to the charge, inform the defendant of his or her
rights, address pretrial release (if not done previously), and, in some cases, set a trial
date (Fed. R. Crim. P. 10 and 11).
The arraignment must be in open court and the defendant must be present unless
the defendant’s presence is waived. Rule 10 (amended in 2002) permits waiver of the
defendant’s presence if the charge is by indictment or misdemeanor information.
Note that this does not include appearance on a felony information, where the defen-
dant is asked to waive the right to an indictment, nor does it allow waiver when the
defendant stands mute or enters a plea of nolo contendere or guilty. A waiver must be
in writing, signed by both the attorney and the defendant, state that the defendant has
received a copy of the indictment or information and that the defendant pleads not
guilty, and be accepted by the court [Rule 10(b)]. If the defendant consents, the ar-
raignment may be conducted by video teleconferencing [Rule 10(c)]. Procedure at the
state level may vary.
The defendant may enter one of several pleas.
1.
Not guilty: If this plea is entered, the judge sets a trial date. The court will
enter a not guilty plea for a defendant who stands mute.
2.
Guilty: If this plea is entered, the court is obligated to question the
defendant to determine whether the plea is knowingly and voluntarily
given. A plea bargain is not an improper inducement to a plea of guilty.
The judge also must determine that the defendant understands the nature
of the charge and possible penalties and that he or she is giving up the
constitutional rights to a jury trial, to cross-examine witnesses, and to
testify or remain silent. If the judge is satisfied on these points, an inquiry
is made of the prosecution to determine the factual basis for the charge.
ANALYSIS PROBLEM
12–1.
Which Chapter 1 cases might lead to the opening of a grand jury in-
vestigation before charges are brought? Explain.

Pretrial: Grand Jury to Pretrial Conference
■445
The law permits a defendant to plead guilty, despite a profession of
innocence, when the defendant makes a rational decision that it is best to
do so. There must be a factual basis for the plea, however. This plea is
called an Alford plea [North Carolina v. Alford (1970)]. If the judge finds that
the defendant has admitted sufficient facts to prove each element of the
crime, the judge may accept the guilty plea and proceed to sentencing or to
set a future date for sentencing.
3.
No contest (nolo contendere): This plea essentially says, “I do not admit guilt
but I am not going to challenge the charge, so treat me as if I plead guilty.”
The court proceeds as in the case of a guilty plea. The judge decides
whether to permit a no contest plea. The purpose of this plea is to avoid a
guilty plea that could prejudice a corresponding civil suit against the
defendant. For example, in a vehicular homicide case, the driver is likely to
face a criminal charge plus a civil suit for money damages. A no contest
plea cannot be treated as an admission to liability in the civil case as a
guilty plea could.
Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(a)(2) and parallel state rules, a de-
fendant may enter a conditional plea of guilty or no contest. Procedures to do so vary,
but they permit the defendant to enter a plea pending the outcome of an appeal or an
important question of law such as the suppression of evidence. After a favorable ap-
pellate court decision for the defendant, the plea may be withdrawn.
If a defendant is entering a plea pro se, must the judge advise the defendant on
the usefulness of an attorney and the dangers of self-representation? The Supreme
Court said these admonishments are not required by the Sixth Amendment [Iowa v.
Tovar (2004)].
These three pleas are the only pleas accepted in the federal courts and in many
state courts. Some states have the plea of guilty but mentally ill. When the defendant’s
mental illness does not meet the standard for an insanity defense, this plea permits
the judge to order treatment for the defendant while any other sentence on the charge
is being served. Few studies have been done to determine if the plea’s purposes are
being fulfilled: the avoidance of costly trials, improper acquittals, and punishment
without rehabilitation for the mentally ill. Most prison systems lack adequate re-
sources to treat the mentally ill, though there are separate facilities for the criminally
insane. Where the plea of guilty but mentally ill is an option, the judge will not accept
the plea until the defendant has received a psychiatric diagnosis of mental illness.
Most jurisdictions also require the defense to notify the prosecution and the court
of certain defenses either at the arraignment or shortly thereafter. See Section VIII of
this chapter.
B.
THE PARALEGAL’S ROLE11
The prosecution paralegal can gather the names of all indicted defendants and their
attorneys, indictment numbers, and the charges to compile an arraignment list. This
list is given to the judge and the clerk of court. An arraignment list for our Chapter 1
cases in a common format appears in Exhibit 12–7.
Arraignment dates are set by the judge or clerk of court, and the attorneys are no-
tified. Both defense and prosecution paralegals review the files to see that they are
current and that the indictment, bail information, and factual summaries are readily
available to the attorney.
Defense paralegals notify clients and arrange any appointments needed to pre-
pare the client for the arraignment and to discuss possible pleas and procedure. If you
know that your client will be pleading guilty or no contest, brief your client on the
questions that the judge will ask to determine if the plea is knowing and voluntary.
Following the arraignment, the prosecution paralegal notifies the victim, po-
lice, and others of the trial date or checks to see that each case is placed on the
“In law it is a good policy
never to plead what you
need not, lest you oblige
yourself to prove what you
cannot.”

clerk’s trial docket and sent out. If the defendant has failed to appear, a warrant for
arrest is issued. It is important to ensure that the proper police agencies are noti-
fied and that the warrant information is entered in the national computer bank
(NCIC). Defense paralegals need to assist the defendant in making bail if not pre-
viously successful. Both the defense and the prosecution paralegals need to update
their files.
V.
DISCOVERY
A.
INTRODUCTION
The next critical stage is discovery. Discovery is the process of requesting and dis-
closing information pertinent to the trial of a case. It allows attorneys to try cases on
the basis of knowledge of the facts and evidence possessed by both sides in the case,
and not on tactics of surprise, courtroom dramatics, or some other device intended to
manipulate the jury. Discovery assists the defendant in making an informed plea, en-
hances the possibility of a plea bargain avoiding the necessity of a trial, and reduces
delay at trial. All of that facilitates a fair resolution of the case.
B.
THE LAW ON DISCOVERY
Due process under the Fifth and FourteenthAmendments requires a fair trial, and dis-
covery is instrumental in achieving this requirement. Although discovery’s impor-
tance is clear, the Supreme Court has ruled that there is no general constitutional right
of discovery in criminal cases, giving states considerable flexibility in this area.
[Weatherford v. Bursey (1977) and Grey v. Netherland (1996)]. Despite the absence of a
mandate, all jurisdictions now provide for significant discovery. Federal Rule of
Criminal Procedure 16 governs discovery practice. State rules vary as to what and
when information is discoverable. In addition, judges are given some discretion to in-
terpret the rules and to make justified exceptions in a particular case. In doing so,
judges rely on case law for guidance. Discovery practice is far from an exact science,
requiring knowledge of the rules, pertinent case law and forms, and some imagina-
tion and creativity.
The defense can discover a variety of information including the following:
1.
The defendant’s statements to police, or to others, that are relevant to the
crime charged.
2.
The defendant’s criminal record.
3.
Witnesses’ names and addresses (also criminal records and inducements to
testify in some jurisdictions).
4.
Witnesses’ statements. In some jurisdictions, statements may not be
available until after witnesses testify at trial. See, for example, the Jencks
Act, 18 U.S.C.A. § 3500, regarding statements of U.S. government witnesses.
5.
Documents, photographs, books, tangible objects, papers, and access to
buildings and places if they are “material to preparing the defense; the
government intends to use the item in the case-in-chief at trial; or the item
was obtained from or belongs to the defendant” [Fed R. Crim. P.
16(a)(1)(E)].
6.
Scientific tests and reports such as mental exams, drug tests, hair and
clothing analysis, DNA analysis, fingerprint reports, experiments, and others.
7.
Depositions in exceptional circumstances and in the interest of justice [Fed.
R. Crim. P. 15(a)(1)].
8.
Exculpatory evidence.
9.
Police and other investigative reports (not available in a number of
jurisdictions).

■447
attorney work product:
trial preparation materials
consisting of the attorney’s
mental impressions, conclu-
sions, opinions, and legal
theories concerning a case.
The items or information must be in the “possession, custody, or control of the
government,” which normally encompasses government agencies such as the local
police, social services, and others.
Once the defendant submits a request for discovery to the prosecutor, Federal
Rule 16(b) and similar state rules require the defendant, on request, to disclose recip-
rocal information to the prosecution. Neither request, however, permits discovery of
the attorney’s work product or otherwise privileged information. Attorney work
product is trial preparation materials consisting of the attorney’s mental impressions,
conclusions, opinions, and legal theories concerning a case. Overall, the scope and
means of discovery in criminal cases are not as broad as those in civil cases.
Sanctions for failure to comply with a discovery request and other disclosure ob-
ligations discussed in this chapter vary, ranging from a court order to provide the dis-
covery to a prohibition against admission of the evidence at trial, and even a new trial
in extreme circumstances [Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(d)(2)]. An overly broad or intrusive re-
quest can be defended against by a protective order by which the court denies, re-
stricts, or defers the discovery [Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(d)(1)].
The Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C.A. § 552, and state freedom of informa-
tion acts may also be used to obtain relevant information. Because such searches are
informal and investigatory, they are not subject to ordinary discovery rules and limi-
tations. Although some materials are exempted from disclosure, anyone with a bona
fide request has access to vast amounts of information. The FBI (www.fbi.gov) and
Department of Justice (www.usdoj.gov/04foia) Web sites link to the “FOIA Guide,”
the “Freedom of Information Case List,” and other useful resources.
C.
EXCULPATORY EVIDENCE
Exculpatory evidence is inconsistent with guilt, raises doubt about evidence of guilt,
or diminishes guilt. It is evidence favorable to the defendant or information that leads
to evidence that is favorable to the defendant. It is not only evidence inconsistent with
guilt, but also evidence for impeachment of a witness or that may mitigate the sen-
tence. The landmark decision of Brady v. Maryland (1963) requires the prosecution to
disclose exculpatory evidence. This disclosure is mandated by constitutional due
process requirements and is consistent with the prosecutor’s duty to seek justice. Brady
requires that the defendant request the exculpatory evidence and that the evidence
sought be material to guilt or punishment. Failure of the defense to make the request
does not necessarily relieve the government of its Brady duty [U.S. v. Agurs (1976)]. In
Agurs, the defendant asserted self-defense, but the prosecution failed to disclose the
fact that the victim had assault and weapons convictions. The standard for what was
sufficiently “material,” however, was unclear until the Court decided U.S. v. Bagley
(1985). In Bagley, the Court held that due process is violated and a conviction must be
reversed only when the failure to disclose exculpatory evidence is material, adding:
[E]vidence is material only . . . if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence
been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A
reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.
In Bagley, the defendant’s somewhat general request for “any deals, promises,
or inducement made to witnesses” was remanded to the trial court to determine if
the actual offers made by the state to the witnesses were material under the new
standard.
In Kyles v. Whitely (1995), the Court emphasized:
1.
The defendant does not have to demonstrate that the verdict would have
been different with the addition of the exculpatory evidence, but with the
evidence there would have been a reasonable probability of a different result.
Conversely, was the verdict without the evidence “worthy of confidence”?
exculpatory evidence:
evidence that is inconsistent
with guilt, raises doubt about
evidence of guilt, or dimin-
ishes guilt; evidence favor-
able to the defendant or
information that leads to evi-
dence that is favorable to the
defendant.

448
■
CHAPTER 12
2.
The defendant does not have to show that with the exculpatory evidence
the state would not have had enough evidence to convict.
3.
Once a Brady violation is found, there is no need for any other inquiry into
whether the error was insignificant to the result (harmless error).
4.
Materiality looks to the cumulative effect of the failure to disclose
exculpatory evidence rather than each individual undisclosed item.
5.
The prosecution has a duty to “learn of any favorable evidence known to
others acting on the government’s behalf in the case, including the police.”
In Strickler v. Greene (1999), the prosecutors violated Brady by failing to disclose
out-of-court testimony of a witness that was arguably helpful to the defendant. The
Court refused to overturn the conviction, however, because the defendant failed to
show a reasonable probability that his conviction or sentence would have been dif-
ferent if the out-of-court testimony had been disclosed.
Other guidelines concerning or affecting disclosure have been developed. Per-
jured testimony may not knowingly be used by the prosecution [Mooney v. Holohan
(1935)], and by implication, any material inconsistency in earlier testimony and what
the witness intends to say at trial should be disclosed. Further, the prosecution can-
not idly sit by once it knows a witness has testified falsely [Napue v. Illinois (1954)].
The burden on the defendant in Napue is to show a reasonable possibility that the vi-
olation could have affected the jury’s deliberations, a lesser burden than that in the
Brady line of cases. A court has no obligation to do an in camera inspection of the gov-
ernment’s files when the defense makes a general request and the prosecution re-
sponds that there is “no exculpatory evidence” [DeMarco v. U.S. (1974)]. Where the
defense request establishes some basis to believe that material evidence exists, how-
ever, the judge should conduct an in camera inspection [Pennsylvania v. Ritchie (1987)].
Ritchie wanted access to a child welfare agency’s file on his daughter to show the
daughter’s accusation of rape might have been based on factors other than the truth.
What happens if the allegedly exculpatory material has been lost or destroyed by
the police? In such cases the remedy has been to bar prosecution or suppress the gov-
ernment’s best evidence. The Court said it is appropriate to do so only if the defendant
shows that (1) the evidence was exculpatory and its value obvious to the custodian,
(2) independent evidence to establish the point in question is not available, and (3) there
is actual prejudice to the defendant even if police or the prosecutor acted in good faith
[California v. Trombetta (1984)]. Bad faith on the part of police, however, eliminates the re-
quirement of prejudice. In Arizona v. Youngblood (1988), a test of semen was inconclusive
and, therefore, speculatively exculpatory, so no relief was necessary when the samples
were destroyed, absent a showing of bad faith by the responsible police. Finally, the gov-
ernment cannot rely on negligence, poor communications between staff members, or ig-
norance of relevant facts to excuse a failure to disclose [Giglio v. U.S. (1972)].
The Brady doctrine is critical to both the prosecution and defense. Requests for
discovery should routinely include requests for disclosure of exculpatory information
that are as specific as possible. Such requests must be taken very seriously by the pros-
ecution; a diligent effort must be made to locate the requested or other important ex-
culpatory information. It is unethical for prosecutors to withhold such information
knowingly or even recklessly.
D.
DISCOVERY PROCEDURE AND THE PARALEGAL’S ROLE
Your primary tasks in discovery include drafting the necessary documents, gathering
the needed items and information, and monitoring the discovery process. Discovery
can start as soon as the indictment or information is filed and can continue right up to
and at trial. Typically, the defendant files a motion for discovery unless there is a stand-
ing court order for discovery; in that case, follow the local practice for submitting the
request. Sometimes the prosecution will simply provide all the accumulated informa-
tion at the arraignment. A checklist is helpful in drafting a motion for discovery.

CHECKLIST FOR DRAFTING A MOTION FOR DISCOVERY
❏
1. Locate a sample of a thorough discovery motion; research form books if there
is no office example. Enter the form into the word processor.
❏
2. Review the case file and note likely areas for special or particularized requests.
❏
3. Review the latest edition of the jurisdiction’s discovery rules and, particularly,
note any deadlines.
❏
4. Research the case law to support any unique or specialized requests not rou-
tinely covered by the rules of discovery (sources: rules decisions, case an-
notations, ABA standards on discovery, constitutional annotations, and
others).
❏
5. Meet with your supervising attorney to discuss any unique issues and to see
that you are covering what is expected in the case. The more serious the
case, the more thorough and imaginative the motion.
❏
6. Check the following list of suggested items to request.12
■
Witnesses’ names, addresses, statements.
■
Any statements of the defendant to police, jail mates, victim, others.
■
Grand jury testimony of witnesses and defendant transcribed or other-
wise recorded.
■
Results of any scientific tests, related reports, and conclusions of experts,
including physical or mental exams, forensic tests and analyses, drug
tests, blood tests, DNA analysis, and others.
■
Notification of intent to conduct tests or experiments, especially if evi-
dence will be destroyed in the process, so defense can be present with
own expert.

jects, buildings, or places.
■
Criminal record of the defendant, victim, witnesses, including codefen-
dants and informants.

seized items.
■
Notice of intent of prosecution to enter evidence of other crimes.
■
Notice of intent to use any models, diagrams, or other demonstrative ex-
hibits or procedures.
■
Appraisals of property value, in felony theft.
■
Proposal for in camera review, if there is a question about discoverability
or exculpatory nature.
❏
7. Review potential grounds for supporting unique requests.13

13. File the motion with the clerk and give copies to the prosecution and judge.
Exhibit 12–8 is a routine discovery motion.14 Exhibit 12–9 is a discovery motion in
a murder case, reflecting a more detailed and particularized approach.15
If working for the prosecution, review the discovery motion, note any unusual
or unreasonable requests, as well as those that go beyond the bounds of the rules
of discovery. Remember that attorney work product is not discoverable and infor-
mation that is normally protected by the rules of evidence as privileged (doctor-
patient, priest-penitent) requires sound justification for discovery, as does
information that is normally confidential or highly sensitive such as national se-
curity documents.
If any item should not be disclosed, draft a motion for a protective order. This mo-
tion seeks a judge’s order denying access to the information. Occasionally, the prose-
cution simply denies the request and leaves it to the defense to file a motion to compel
discovery. In gathering the evidence and considering whether to deny access to the
information, be especially sensitive to the requirements of fairness and due process,
the spirit of the Brady and subsequent decisions, and the overriding duty of your of-
fice to seek justice. Any deliberate attempt to conceal evidence is likely to result in re-
versal of a conviction, subject your supervising attorney to disciplinary procedures,
and cost you your job. Discovery involves critical decisions; good communication be-
tween you and your supervising attorney is essential. Also keep in mind that the de-
fense counsel’s duty is to be as zealous as the law allows.
Gather the needed information. Screen it for exculpatory evidence. Contact po-
lice and other agencies likely to have pertinent information. Arrange for tests, get re-
ports, establish dates for inspection and photographing.
Next, draft a written response to the motion indicating that the request is granted
and either attach copies of the requested material or state at what place and time the
items can be inspected or otherwise made available. Any denial of discovery should
be briefly explained. The prosecutor’s reciprocal request for discovery, consistent
with the applicable rules, can be joined with the response to the discovery motion
[Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(b)]. Some prosecutors use reciprocal discovery; others do not.
The opponent’s failure to comply or an unreasonable delay in complying with a
discovery request may lead your attorney to seek a sanction against the other side.
Exhibit 12–10 is a motion for sanctions for failure to provide timely discovery.16
It is a good idea to draft an inventory of items disclosed and received for both par-
ties to sign. The original should be filed with the clerk of court. Attorneys like to have
the inventory so the opponent cannot pull any surprises at trial. The inventory also

Pretrial: Grand Jury to Pretrial Conference
■451
serves as a good checklist to make sure all items requested have been received. A re-
view of the items and the request is essential. Any missed items need to be called to
the attention of the opponent.
Electronic communication and data storage and the advancement of the applica-
tion of forensic science to criminal procedures have increased the complexity of dis-
covery. Both prosecution and defense personnel must acquire new knowledge and
skills in these areas to work competently in criminal law. Although a detailed look at
electronic and scientific discovery techniques exceeds the scope of this book, some
points of information addressed here may be useful. A timely motion to preserve elec-
tronic information or types of data, such as meta data, pertinent to the case may prevent
the loss or routine destruction of valuable information, a process similar to preserving
tapes of 911 calls before they are erased. When electronic information has been disclosed
inadvertently, a protective order may be necessary to preserve attorney-client privilege
and to have the information returned. Electronic discovery requests need to focus on:
1.
who has the electronic information and knows how it was created and stored;
2.
what information is likely to exist relevant to the case;
3.
where will this information be located, including backups;
4.
when was the pertinent data created, modified, or deleted; and
5.
how should that data be compiled, delivered to the opponent, and stored
for quick access.17
Further, when a key piece of evidence is particularly technical, forensic expertise may
be needed. Government forensic labs may be adequate. A number of businesses offer
a wide array of electronic and forensic services.
Discovered information needs to be evaluated and summarized for the attorney
and placed in the file. If numerous documents are involved, you may have to catalog
them and have an index or the entire set of documents computerized for easy retrieval
of desired information. Keep in mind that any faxed copies may need to be photo-
copied, because the quality of some fax documents deteriorates quickly. The evalu-
ated evidence may lead to additional discovery requests, pretrial motions, such as a
motion to suppress, and the beginning of serious trial preparation and plea bargain-
ing, if not started previously.
Your role in discovery is critical. Requests for discovery, responses, and fulfilling
the continuing obligation to disclose [Rule 16(c)] must be thorough, conscientiously
monitored, and timely. Being aware of any time limits in the rules or set out in perti-
nent court orders is essential. Also, be aware that discovery has its strategic side and,
if done artfully, can help limit your opponent to only specified witnesses, evidence,
and issues. Diligence and creativity in the discovery process can lead to significant
dividends at trial. Despite its great usefulness, however, discovery is no substitute for
thorough, independent investigation.
VI.
OTHER INVESTIGATION
Paralegals must occasionally become investigators, whether working for prosecution
or defense. Investigation can involve locating and interviewing witnesses, talking
with police, gathering medical and other records, visiting the scene, photographing,
locating documents of various sorts, measuring, observing, and a host of other activ-
ities. Hard core investigation, however, takes specialized training. If you are inter-
ested in or find yourself faced with critical investigative tasks, consult the numerous
references in your library on investigating criminal cases. Good litigation books also
discuss how to interview witnesses and conduct investigation. Keep in mind that in-
vestigators often face serious ethical questions, and preparation here is also impor-
tant. For example, you investigate the scene of a crime for the defense after the police
conclude their investigation and you find a weapon. What should you do? Take the

452
■
CHAPTER 12
time to be prepared in this area by reading current sources on investigation techniques
and related ethical questions. Of course, the prosecution has detectives and the police,
and defense offices often employ an investigator.
There are a host of online resources and books on proper investigation techniques.
A number of private vendors offer an array of investigative services.
VII.
PRETRIAL MOTIONS
A.
INTRODUCTION
Discovery, interviewing, and other investigation often reveal the need to file pretrial
motions to resolve a variety of concerns prior to trial. These motions allow the court to
decide issues to avoid delay, inefficiency, and injustice at trial. They range from the mo-
tion to suppress illegally obtained evidence, discussed in Chapter 10 (Exhibit 10–1), to
motions to disqualify the judge or to change the location (venue) of the trial. The pro-
cedure used to define, research, and draft such motions and responses to them is cov-
ered in Chapter 10. This section identifies the names and purposes of some of the more
common pretrial motions and pertinent rules of procedure.
B.
PROCEDURE
Rule 47 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and parallel state rules require
motions to be made in writing except for those made at trial, unless the court permits
otherwise. The motion states the grounds for the motion and the order or relief
sought, then is served on the attorney in the manner prescribed by the Rules of Civil
Procedure (Fed. R. Crim. P. 49). Some jurisdictions require certain matters to be
raised by pretrial motions. In the federal system, these include defenses and objec-
tions to procedure, defenses and objections based on the indictment or information,
a motion to suppress evidence, requests for discovery, and requests for severance of
charges or defendants [Rule 12(b)]. In some states, judges may also require a written
brief in support of the motion. Rule 12(c) Fed. R. Crim. P. directs the court at the ar-
raignment or soon after to set a time for making pretrial motions. Local rules may be
more specific.
C.
COMMON PRETRIAL MOTIONS
Pretrial motions are frequently made not with the expectation of prevailing at the trial
level, but to preserve an issue for appeal. An erroneous decision by a judge may lead to
a new trial or reversal on appeal. The decision on some types of pretrial motions may be
appealed before going to trial. Exhibit 12–11 is an example of a pretrial motion.
The computer age makes it imperative to (1) use discovery and pretrial motions
skillfully to become aware of what kind of electronic evidence or exhibits will be used
by the opposition at trial; and (2) have them viewed and, if necessary, excluded if their
use will be prejudicial or if the item or exhibit is not what it purports to be. Keep in
mind that digital technology increases the ease with which evidence can be fabricated.
You need to be familiar with at least the name and purpose of the following pre-
trial motions.
1.
Motion to Dismiss
The motion to dismiss is a request to have the indictment, information, some charges, or
the matter as a whole dismissed. Its purpose is to have the document or matter termi-
nated and the defendant released. The court may permit some attacked documents to be
amended and charges reissued as long as jeopardy has not attached [Rules 6(b)(2), 7(e),
12(b)(2)]. This is not true of an indictment, however, which may issue only from a grand
jury. The defective indictment must be returned to the grand jury for reconsideration.

2.
Motion to Suppress Evidence
The motion to suppress evidence is a request to prevent the use of evidence at trial be-
cause of an illegal search or seizure, improperly obtained confession or admission, a
tainted lineup or other identification procedure, or the inflammatory or prejudicial
nature of the evidence, such as a ten-foot, blow-up color photo of the victim’s broken
nose [Rules 12(b)(3) and 41].
3.
Motion to Sever
The motion to sever is a request to have charges or defendants tried separately. Its pur-
pose is to avoid any unfairness or prejudice to the defendant [Rules 12(b)(3) and 14].
4.
Motion for Discovery
See the section on discovery in this chapter.
5.
Motion for Change of Venue
When it appears the defendant cannot obtain a fair trial because of pretrial publicity
or strong local feeling, a change of venue (trial location) may be requested. The pur-
pose of the motion is to secure an impartial jury.
6.
Motion for Continuance or Adjournment
The motion for continuance or adjournment is a request to postpone the trial date. The
purpose is to gain more time to secure important evidence, be more prepared, change
attorneys, let emotion-charged local opinion settle, or other reasons.
7.
Motion to Recuse or Disqualify a Judge
The motion to recuse or disqualify a judge is a request to reassign the case to a differ-
ent judge. It is not a common motion, but it is an important one. The purpose is to re-
move a judge because circumstances exist that might prejudice the judge, or at least
appear to raise that potential. Impartiality is the goal.

CHAPTER 12
8.
Motion to Obtain Funds for Expert
If the office has been appointed to represent a defendant, it may be essential to file a
motion to obtain funds to hire an expert. This is usually true if the case involves drugs
and alcohol, statistics, firearms and gunshot wounds, pathology, or DNA.18
Ten factors must be addressed in such a motion: type of resource; nature and stage
of assistance; name of the expert, qualifications and cost; reasonableness of the rate
charged and cost; factual basis for the need for the expert, including case theory and
relevant themes; the attorney’s observations, knowledge, and insights about the case
and the defendant; the legal basis for the expert in this case; the legal rationale for
such resources for the defense; inadequacy or unavailability of government resources;
and evidentiary documentation.19
A good source for additional information on the motion to obtain funds for an ex-
pert is the National LegalAid and DefenderAssociation (NLADA) and its publications.
9.
Motion in Limine or for a Protective Order
The motion in limine or for a protective order can be a powerful tool if used thought-
fully and creatively. It is designed to get the judge to issue a protective order pre-
venting one side or the other from using questions or arguments at trial that are
irrelevant, inadmissible, or prejudicial. For example, the prosecution may want to
protect a victim from cross-examination about her sexual orientation or her having
had psychiatric problems years earlier, which might be only mildly relevant but likely
to distract the jury from the relevance of the rest of her testimony.
The use of this motion allows the court to prevent anticipated problems or abuses.
Clarifying such matters before trial is not only efficient, but also better assures a fair
trial. In U.S. v. Universal Rehabilitation Services (3rd. Cir. 2000), the trial court had de-
nied the defense motion in limine seeking prohibition of the introduction of the pros-
ecution witnesses’ guilty pleas to some of the same charges facing the defendants. The
defense argued that evidence of the witnesses’ guilty pleas would prejudice the de-
fendants, because the jury would be more likely to convict the defendants if they
knew that the witnesses’ co-workers had already pleaded guilty to one of the charges.
The prosecution argued that the evidence of the pleas was needed to prevent the jury
from speculating that these government witnesses had been offered such a “sweet”
deal to plead guilty that they were not credible witnesses. The full Court of Appeals
ruled that the trial court had weighed all the factors and was correct in denying the
defense motion. This case demonstrates how evidentiary issues can be anticipated
and clarified through a motion in limine. It also demonstrates that a denial of such a
motion can provide grounds for appeal.
VIII.
NOTICE OF DEFENSES
In most jurisdictions the defense has the obligation to notify the prosecution of its in-
tention to raise specified defenses (Fed. R. Crim. P. 12.1 to 12.3). On written request of
a federal prosecutor, the defense has ten days to notify the government of its inten-
tion to offer an alibi defense. The notice must state the details of the alibi, including
time, place, and witnesses [Fed. R. Crim. P. 12.1(a)]. The prosecution must respond in
ten days with the details of its rebuttal evidence [Rule 12.1(b)].
The defense has an affirmative duty under the federal rules and parallel state
rules to notify the government of the insanity defense (Rule 12.2). The notice must be
made during the time allowed for pretrial motions and served on the prosecution
with a copy filed with the clerk [Fed. R. Crim. P. 12.2(a)(1)]. If the defense intends to
introduce expert evidence of a mental condition in a capital case, it must notify the
prosecution in writing within the time for pretrial motions [Rule 12.2(b)]. As when a

Pretrial: Grand Jury to Pretrial Conference
■455
claim of incompetency to stand trial is made, the judge usually orders a psychiatric
evaluation to help determine whether use of the insanity defense is proper.
Rule 12.3 sets out the procedure for notice of a public-authority defense. This de-
fense is an assertion that the defendant at the time of the alleged crime was acting on
behalf of a law enforcement or federal intelligence agency, or believed such.
The defendant’s withdrawal of a defense under Rules 12.1 to 12.3 may not be
commented on at trial. Check your state rules and statutes regarding the notification
of defenses.
IX.
PLEA BARGAINING
Plea bargaining is a negotiation process between the prosecution and defense to re-
solve a case. The defendant gives up the significant right to a jury trial in return for a
plea of guilty and a recommendation from the prosecution for reduced charges (or a
promise not to bring additional charges) or a lighter sentence than might be recom-
mended after trial. It is the criminal justice system equivalent to settlement in civil
cases. Plea bargaining has received criticism, justifiably when plea bargains are
reached pell-mell in an assembly line process without regard to constitutional de-
fenses, the nature and certainty of the evidence, the concern of the victim and the com-
munity, and other considerations. Criticism is not justified when critics ignore the
significant role plea bargaining plays in reducing expensive and costly trials and in
reaching agreement in an informed, conscientious, and productive fashion. Although
over 90 percent of criminal cases are disposed of without a trial, there are still cases,
especially misdemeanors, that could be resolved quickly and inexpensively if more
formalized mediation processes were established. In short, without plea bargaining,
the system would simply collapse under its own weight. With these advantages in
mind, courts have officially sanctioned the once-secretive plea bargaining process
[Brady v. U.S. (1970), Santobello v. New York (1971)], as have both state and federal rules
of criminal procedure [Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)].
To be upheld, however, plea bargains and the subsequent plea of guilty must con-
form to several standards summarized in Bordenkircher v. Hayes (1978).
We have recently had occasion to observe that “[w]hatever might be the situation in an
ideal world, the fact is that the guilty plea and the often concomitant plea bargain are
important components of this country’s criminal justice system. Properly administered,
they can benefit all concerned.” The open acknowledgement of this . . . practice has led
this court to recognize the importance of counsel during plea negotiations, Brady v.
United States, 397 U.S. 742, 758, the need for a public record indicating that a plea
was knowingly and voluntarily made, Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238, 242, and the
requirement that a prosecutor’s plea-bargaining promise must be kept, Santobello v.
New York, 404 U.S. 257, 262. . . .
In Santobello, a guilty plea was overturned because a second prosecutor recom-
mended the maximum sentence to the court after a previous prosecutor had prom-
ised to make no recommendation. Bordenkircher reiterated that pleas pursuant to a
plea bargain must not be coerced by prosecutorial threats. If, however, the “threat” is
an additional charge or habitual offender indictment that is supportable by the evi-
dence, it is not impermissible for the prosecutor to use it as a bargaining chip to get
the defendant to plead guilty to an existing charge.
The essentials of a valid plea include a record that reflects a knowing waiver by
the defendant of three constitutional rights: the privilege against compulsory self-
incrimination, the right to trial by jury, and the right to confront accusers [Boykin v.
Alabama (1969)]; the defendant’s understanding of the charge [Henderson v. Morgan
(1976)]; and a factual basis for the plea [North Carolina v. Alford (1970)].
“Those who think the infor-
mation brought out at a crimi-
nal trial is the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the
truth are fools. Prosecuting or
defending a case is nothing
more than getting to those
people who will talk for your
side, who will say what you
want said. . . . I use the law
to frustrate the law. But I
didn’t set up the ground
rules.”
—F. Lee Bailey, New York
Times Magazine, Sept. 20,
1970

456
■
CHAPTER 12
U.S. v. Gigot (10th Cir. 1998) nullified a plea bargain and the subsequent plea of
guilty, because the requirement that the defendant must understand the charge and
that the plea be voluntary was violated. The judge not only did not inform the defen-
dant of the elements of the crime, but both the judge and the defendant’s counsel mis-
informed the defendant on the maximum penalty and possible fine.
Blackledge v. Allison (1977) ruled that even if the procedure set out in pertinent
rules is followed, that fact does not necessarily and automatically prohibit the defen-
dant from trying to have the plea overturned for valid reasons.
Judges have the discretion to accept or reject a plea agreement. Rules of procedure
normally require the judge to explain that to the defendant prior to a plea of guilty.
The federal rules and many state rules permit the defendant to withdraw the plea of
guilty if the judge rejects the plea bargain. Plea agreements have come under judicial
attack as bribery when key witnesses have been offered “deals” in return for testi-
mony and as excessive when defendants have agreed to give up their rights of appeal
and collateral attack of their sentences. Appeal waivers and deals to codefendants
who testify for the government have been largely upheld by the courts. The former
are condoned in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(b)(1)(N). Some prosecutors re-
quire defendants in plea agreements to waive their right to withdraw their guilty plea
even if exculpatory or impeachment evidence may be found later.20 Such agreements
are likely to be challenged sometime in the future.
Jurisdictions that have mandatory sentences or closely follow sentencing guide-
lines indirectly restrict the range of plea bargains. In such jurisdictions, bargaining is
best done before the charges are filed, which is also the case where plea bargaining is
not permitted. Since the Supreme Court decisions in U.S. v. Booker (2005) and U.S. v.
Fanfan (2005) made sentencing guidelines advisory rather than mandatory, plea bar-
gaining is more likely to take place throughout the process rather than at the precharg-
ing stage. The impact of these decisions is discussed in more detail in Chapter 14.
Your role in plea bargaining is to ensure that the attorney has the necessary in-
formation about the case to conduct informed and conscientious plea negotiations.
Also, the prosecution paralegal should keep the victim or the victim’s closest relative
informed about offers of plea bargains and the agreement that is reached. Encourage
the victim to attend the defendant’s entry of plea and sentencing.21 Victims are ig-
nored too frequently in this process, and your dedication to keeping them informed
makes the system more responsive and the victim more appreciative of the process.
Defense attorneys and paralegals must be cautious regarding plea bargains in-
volving resident aliens. A resident alien is a foreign national who is permitted to stay
in the United States for the person’s lifetime. Stricter enforcement of the deportation
laws since 9/11 means that a twelve-month sentence on a misdemeanor may be suf-
ficient grounds for permanent deportation. This could mean permanent separation
from a spouse and children. Thus, the implications of a plea to what might be seen to
be a relatively mild charge may have severe consequences.
As the percentage of criminal cases that are resolved by plea bargain increases
and the percentage of cases resolved by trial decreases, more cases are being appealed
on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel at the plea bargain stage. To prevail, a
defendant must show:
1.
that counsel was deficient and
2.
that the deficiency prejudiced the defendant, that is, “there is a
reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s errors, [the defendant]
would not have pled guilty and would have insisted on going to trial”
[Hill v. Lockhart (1985)].
Thorough preparation for plea bargaining is essential to the fair, effective, and ef-
ficient administration of justice. Inadequate preparation, on the other hand, can lead
to allegations of malpractice.

ANALYSIS PROBLEM
12–2.
At a family picnic, your Aunt Tildy confronts you with a tirade about
how all the lawyers are in cahoots, letting criminals off through plea bar-
gaining. How do you respond?
X.
THE RIGHT TO A SPEEDY TRIAL
You may be asked to draft a motion or a response to a motion for lack of a speedy trial.
More importantly, you may recognize that speedy trial is becoming an issue in your
case and point that out to your supervising attorney. The winning or losing of a case
could turn on just such a suggestion.
The right to speedy trial is guaranteed in the Sixth Amendment to the Consti-
tution and is applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment [Klopfer v.
North Carolina (1967)]. Most jurisdictions have speedy trial requirements patterned
after 18 U.S.C.A. § 3161. Court rules also require the timely progression of the case.
The right reduces presentencing jail time, compresses the period of emotional
trauma and uncertainty associated with criminal charges, and lessens the potential
for loss of evidence over time. Some argue that it curtails crime by decreasing the
opportunity for defendants to commit other crimes while they are free awaiting
trial.22
In Barker v. Wingo (1972), the Court ruled that a five-year delay in which the de-
fendant failed to demand a speedy trial and demonstrate prejudice was not a viola-
tion of the Sixth Amendment. The Court established a four-item test: (1) length of the
delay; (2) reason for the delay, such as whether it was caused by the defendant;
(3) whether the defendant asserted the right; and (4) whether prejudice occurred,
such as diminished evidence for the defense, extended incarceration, and others. The
right commences on arrest and charging, and the time between a dismissal and
recharging does not count if the defendant is not jailed [U.S. v. Marion (1971) and U.S.
v. Loud Hawk (1986)].
The federal speedy trial statute moves a case along by requiring the filing of
charges within thirty days of arrest or of summons, and trial must occur within sev-
enty days thereafter. In contrast, a minimum of thirty days must elapse between the
defendant’s first appearance and trial to avoid rushed justice. Delays for mental ex-
ams, interlocutory appeals, and continuances requested by the defendant are among
those periods not counted in determining a violation of the right to speedy trial. Sanc-
tions for violation include dismissal with or without prejudice, depending on the se-
riousness of the charge, the reasons for the dismissal, and administrative and fairness
considerations involved in retrial (18 U.S.C.A. § 3162). Many states have a ninety-day
indictment-to-trial deadline with similar exceptions for delay and sanctions for vio-
lations. Failure of a state to hold a trial within the 189-day deadline required by the
Interstate Agreement on Detainer was not a denial of the right to speedy trial [New
York v. Hill (2000)], because defense counsel agreed to the delay and, therefore, waived
the right to trial within the time limit. In U.S. v. Lovasco (1977), the Court held that
some delays, especially those caused by the government to gain a tactical advantage
in the case, although outside the reach of the Sixth Amendment, may be a denial of
due process.
See State v. Houck in Chapter 8 for a discussion of speedy trial.

pretrial conference:
a meeting of the judge with
opposing parties to ensure
an efficient and fair process-
ing of the case, encourage
plea negotiations, and nar-
row the issues to be tried.
XI.
PRETRIAL CONFERENCE
Pretrial conferences may be ordered by the court under Federal Rule of Criminal Pro-
cedure 17.1 and parallel state rules. A pretrial conference permits the judge to meet
with the opposing parties to ensure an efficient and fair processing of the case, en-
courage plea negotiations, hear motions or schedule them for hearing, narrow the is-
sues to be tried, and set the trial date, if not already done. The pretrial conference is
often the last serious opportunity for resolving the case before trial.
A pretrial conference statement is often required, which lists the status of the case
in various categories such as offenses, situation of codefendants, the finding of prob-
able cause, trial date and estimated time required for trial, number of witnesses, dis-
covery completed, demand for jury trial, plea bargains offered and accepted, and
issues for a suppression hearing. This statement or report must be filed on the day of
the conference.23 A paralegal can help organize much of this material in a convenient
form for the supervising attorney before the conference.
XII.
CONCLUSION
The grand jury process is similar to a preliminary hearing in its purpose to hear evi-
dence and screen out unnecessary and unfounded charges. Its investigative powers of-
ten exceed those of the police and prosecutor, making it a potent weapon against crime.
Preparation for the grand jury, including the drafting of information and indictments,
lends itself particularly well to paralegal application. The arraignment provides the de-
fendant with notice of the charge and is the designated time to enter one of several pleas.
Discovery is another stage that offers great opportunity for assistance by the para-
legal. Effectively drafting the appropriate documents and carefully monitoring the
process helps you achieve a beneficial exchange of evidence. Pretrial motions and re-
sponses, when thoroughly researched and carefully drafted, are indispensable tools
for isolating and resolving pretrial issues.
Each of these pretrial processes not only guides the case toward trial, but also pro-
vides the background for informed plea bargaining, which is equivalent to settlement
in the civil system. Plea bargaining is vital for reducing trial court calendars and for
individualizing an increasingly crowded and mechanical system. The amount of liti-
gation regarding plea bargaining and the subsequent plea of guilty requires the legal
team to be cautious in this area and fully aware of its legal requirements.
The Sixth Amendment right to speedy trial, augmented by due process consider-
ations, requires the state and federal governments to ensure that an accused gets to
trial in a reasonable period of time, which promotes justice by avoiding unnecessary
incarceration and the loss of important evidence needed for a fair trial. Often the last
step before trial is the judge’s pretrial conference, which facilitates a plea agreement
and, if none is reached, a fair and efficient trial of the factual issues.
“First settle what the case is,
before you argue it.”

FIRST MOTION FOR DISCOVERY ON BEHALF
OF DEFENDANT (NAME)—MOTION
FOR HEARING DATE CERTAIN
Introductory Statement
Comes the defendant, through counsel, and does hereby file his motions for discovery and other relief. De-
fendant files this pursuant to Sections 1, 2, 3, 7, 11, and 17 of the Kentucky Constitution, and Amendments 5, 6, 8,
and 14 of the United States Constitution, and defendant’s rights to a full and fair hearing pursuant to both the state
and federal constitutions. The discovery sought is not only what is within the possession and control of the
__________ County Commonwealth Attorney, but also that which is in the possession of the __________ County
Sheriff’s Office, the Kentucky State Police, local police agencies within and around __________ County, local coro-
ners and/or deputy coroners, any and all other “medicolegal” investigators involved in the investigation of this case
to any degree, also Federal Law Enforcement Agencies, including but not necessarily limited to the Federal Bureau
of Investigation. Said Motion includes not only that which is known and possessed as set out above, but also that
which can be made known or obtained through the exercise of due diligence by the __________ County Common-
wealth Attorney or his agents as set out above.This demand for discovery specifically includes evidence which may
reasonably be interpreted as exculpatory as to “guilt-innocence,” but also as to the mitigation of punishment (miti-
gating evidence) which the Commonwealth intends to seek at trial or in a penalty phase presentation, or which
could lead to the discovery of same. Discovery sought is as follows:
Statements Made by Defendant: Oral
and/or Written
1. All written or recorded statements or confessions of any kind made by defendant to any person. RCr 7.24.
This request includes, but is not necessarily limited to statements made to jail companions, jailers, deputy jailers,

dence consumed in testing); and Haynes v. Commonwealth, Ky., 657 S.W.2d 948 (1983).This request also includes
reports, memoranda, and the like relative to samples taken of articles and/or substances found in or around the
crime scene, samples taken from defendant and/or his clothing and/or personal effects. See also RCr 7.24. Any
scientific tests or reports thereof would be needed by counsel sufficiently in advance of trial in order that he be per-
mitted a reasonable opportunity to defend against the results thereof, including the retaining of an expert to assist
defendant in the preparation and defense of the charges. Barnett v. Commonwealth, Ky., 763 S.W.2d 119 (1989).
6. Copies of any notes, whether recorded or not, of any tests, examinations, and/or experiments performed by
the Commonwealth, federal agencies, private labs, or the like, RCr 7.24.

during, and/or after the events which transpired that gave rise to the Indictment; persons who were witnesses to
the defendant before, during, and after the events which transpired giving rise to the charges and Indictment. This
request also includes any persons who may have seen defendant and the victim together prior to the time it is al-
leged [that the victim] died. Burks v. Commonwealth, Ky., 471 S.W.2d 298 (1971); United States v. Cadet, 727 F.2d
1453 (9th Cir.1984).Defendant will seek appropriate funding for an investigator and/or mitigation specialist, or other
experts. If the Commonwealth and/or its agents has already discovered witnesses, and if defendant has access to
this information, he can conduct this investigation in a more expedient manner, with the least potential cost to the
_____ Fiscal Court. See also Wright v. Commonwealth, Ky., 637 S.W.2d 635 (1982); ABA Standards for Criminal
Justice, Discovery and Procedure Before Trial, § 11–2.1(a)(i).
a. If the prosecutor objects, and should the Court sustain said objection, then the defendant moves for an
Order that all such reports, statements, memoranda, and the like which are sought but for which disclosure to de-
fense counsel is not ordered be presented to the court, sealed, and made a part of the record for possible appel-
late review.

a.This Motion includes any witnesses or other information from whatever source(s) that would indicate that
the defendant did not participate in the offenses mentioned in the Indictment.
b. If the Commonwealth objects, and if the Court sustains said objection, then defendant, in the alternative,
moves for an in camera inspection by the Court to determine relevancy and preservation for possible appellate re-
view.RCr 7.26(12). See Haynes, supra;Wright v.Commonwealth, Ky., 637 S.W.2d 635 (1982); and LeGrande v.Com-
monwealth, Ky., 494 S.W.2d 726 (1973); see also Goldberg v. United States, 425 U.S. 97 (1976) (notes taken by

Lynch v. Commonwealth, Ky., 472 S.W.2d 263 (1971) (RCr 7.26(12) is “procedural equivalent” of Jenks Act); and
Haynes v. Commonwealth, Ky., 657 So. 2d 948 (1983) (there is no generic work product exception for investigative
police reports); prosecutor must comply with agreed disclosure terms, even if beyond that required by RCr 7.24. See
also Hendley v Commonwealth, Ky., 573 S.W.2d 662 (1978) (court’s in camera review of prosecutor’s notes and mem-
oranda of his investigation).
Request for Discovery Compliance
Sufficiently in Advance of Trial in
Order That Counsel Might Seek
Assistance in Any Investigation
Needed to Be Accomplished Prior to
Trial
16. Defendant seeks any orders relating to compliance by the Commonwealth to be sufficiently in advance of
trial in order that defendant may conduct whatever investigation(s) are necessary in light of counsel’s limited re-
sources. Silverburg v. Commonwealth, Ky., 587 S.W.2d 241 (1979) (the disclosure of exculpatory evidence must be
made to the defendant in time for a due investigation to be made); see also Berry v.Commonwealth, Ky., 782 S.W.2d
625 (1990); Wright, supra; Hicks v. Commonwealth, Ky. App., 805 S.W.2d 144 (1991) (error analysis when prose-
cutor fails to follow “open file” policy); Epperson, supra; Barnett v. Commonwealth, Ky., 763 S.W.2d 119 (1989) (a
trial is not a “cat and mouse game”).
Exculpatory Evidence Generally
17. Any items of evidence, whether real or otherwise, that are or may be exculpatory in nature. RCr 7.24, RCr
7.26. This request includes, but is not limited to, the following: any and all promises or consideration, or promises
of consideration or inducements given to or made on behalf of prosecution witnesses, and this request includes full
disclosure of all plea agreements, formal or informal, written or unwritten, with any witnesses or informants, and
any and all state and/or federal presentence investigations that reflect a prosecution witness’s efforts or coopera-
tion on behalf of the Commonwealth or the federal government.This material is discoverable under the due process
clause of the 14th Amendment. See Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972); United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S.
667 (1985), on remand 798 F.2d 1297 (9th Cir. 1986); Williams v. Commonwealth, Ky., 569 S.W.2d 139 (1977). De-
fendant seeks an evidentiary hearing on this issue to demonstrate the lack of mere conjecture, Key v. Common-
wealth, Ky., 633 S.W.2d 55 (1982). See v. Commonwealth, Ky., 746 S.W.2d 701 (1988) and Ballard v.
Commonwealth, Ky., 743 S.W.2d 21 (1988) (entitlement upon request to exculpatory evidence in hands of prose-
cutor or agents of the Commonwealth); Barnett v Commonwealth, 828 S.W.2d 361 (1992) (right to discover excul-
patory evidence which amounts to the right of defendant to present a defense).
a. In Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972), the petitioner was convicted of passing forged money orders.
He received five years. An issue arose because petitioner argued that the government’s chief witness, Robert Tal-
iento, had been made “offers” if he would testify against petitioner. Both the government and Taliento denied this;
however, it was later learned that he had been made somewhat of a “promise” in exchange for his cooperation. Fur-
ther evidence revealed that the chief government attorney did not actually make a “promise”; however, the witness
was told that he definitely would be prosecuted if he did not testify:
The United States Attorney, Hoey, filed an affidavit stating that he had personally consulted
with Taliento and his attorney shortly before trial to emphasize that Taliento would definitely be prose-
cuted if he did not testify and that if he did testify he would be obliged to rely on the “good judgment
and conscience of the Government” as to whether he would be prosecuted. (pp. 152–153) (emphasis
added)

■
CHAPTER 12
b.The Supreme Court observed that there was “at least an implication that the Government would reward
the cooperation of the witness. . . .” Giglio v. United States, supra, p. 153.
c. The Court went on further to hold that where the case against a defendant depends upon the testimony
of witnesses who have entered into understandings and/or agreements with the government attorneys, this would
be relevant to the credibility of these witnesses.This information should have been disclosed to counsel for the de-
fense and, ultimately, to the jury.
d. It has been held to be a violation of defendant’s 6th Amendment rights under the United States Consti-
tution when a defense counsel was unable to cross-examine a witness on any understanding entered into with the
governmental authorities.
Commonwealth Witnesses—Pending
Charges, Probation and Parole
Status, Etc.
18. Further, defendant seeks a listing of any and all charges, prosecutions, investigations, or possible prose-
cutions pending that could be brought against any prosecution witness and any probationary, parole, or deferred
prosecution status of such witness, including both state and federal prosecutions, charges, or the like. Davis v.
Alaska, 94 S. Ct. 1104 (1974).
Commonwealth Witnesses—Mental
lllnesses, Psychiatric Histories,
Psychological Problems, and the
Like, Including Drug and Alcohol
Problems
19. Defendant seeks any reports of any psychiatric, psychological, or mental evaluations of any prosecution
witness or any evidence of psychiatric, psychological, or mental treatment of any prosecution witness, including but
not limited to conditions of said witnesses that relate to drug or alcohol problems. See Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, 480
U.S. 39, 107 S. Ct. 989 (1987); Wagner v. Commonwealth, Ky., 581 S.W.2d 352 (1979); Mosley v. Commonwealth,
Ky., 420 S.W.2d 679 (1967); United States v. Lindstrom, 698 F.2d 1154 (11th Cir. 1983).
a. In United States v. Lindstrom, supra, the Court cited the Davis v. Alaska case in commenting that
[T]he cross examiner is not only permitted to delve into the witness’ story to test the witness’
perceptions and memory, but the cross examiner has traditionally been allowed to impeach, i.e., dis-
credit, the witness. . . . (p. 1160)
Certain forms of mental disorder have high probative value on the issue of credibility. . . . [Men-
tal disorders] may tend to produce a bias in a witness’ testimony. (p. 1160)
b. The Court went on to hold that broadly based assertions of confidentiality of such information (mental
health records) usually argued by prosecution attorneys cannot justify denial of the defendant’s right to examine
and use psychiatric information to attack the credibility of a key government witness (p. 1167).
c. See also Wagner v. Commonwealth, Ky., 420 S.W.2d 679 (1967).
Defendant’s Mental Status, Any
Evidence of Insanity, Mental
Illnesses, Drug and/or Alcohol
Involvement
EXHIBIT 12–9 (Continued)
Motion for Discovery in Murder Case 

Pretrial: Grand Jury to Pretrial Conference
■473
20. Defendant seeks any indication, whether contained in memoranda, investigative notes, or the like, that
would indicate defendant was insane or suffered from mental illness or disturbance of any kind prior to, during, or
after the alleged offense. Defendant seeks to discover and copy any and all records the Commonwealth and/or its
agents may have regarding the mental status of the defendant, past or present, including, but not necessarily lim-
ited to, psychiatric reports, psychological evaluations and/or reports, physical exams, hospital records, or the like.
See Wagner, supra.
Commonwealth’s Evidence—Whether
Any Evidence Destroyed, Lost,
Misplaced
21. Any evidence of the destruction of any evidence by way of testing, the routine disposal of evidence, sam-
ples, or the like, and any and all other items that may have been considered in the investigation of this case but that
are no longer available. Defendant specifically moves that no evidence, samples, or the like be destroyed or other-
wise disposed of by the Commonwealth or its agents. Calvert v Commonwealth, Ky. App., 708 S.W.2d 121 (1986)
(right of defendant to own evaluation of evidence); Hendley, supra.
Exculpatory and Impeachment
Evidence—Rewards
22. Any reward offers published concerning this case, including any claimed by any prosecution witnesses by
virtue of their involvement in this case, including any rewards actually received.
Commonwealth Witnesses—Prior
History of Witnesses as
Commonwealth Informants
23. Disclosure of whether any prosecution witnesses or informants have served as informants in any other past
cases, or whether such persons have testified for any prosecuting agency in exchange for their cooperation, and
whether any information or testimony supplied by such persons was false.
Miscellaneous
24. All evidence not previously requested by this Motion which the Commonwealth intends to offer into evi-
dence in this case.
25. Defendant further moves this Court to order the Commonwealth to notify defense counsel if additional ma-
terial or information that is subject to discovery arises subsequent to compliance with the Order to be issued upon
this Motion.
26. Defendant moves for leave to file additional Motions for Discovery for material or information that is subject
to discovery that arises subsequent to compliance with the Order to be issued upon this Motion.
27. Defendant further moves for leave to file additional Motions for Discovery following the Commonwealth’s
Response to this Motion and Orders arising out of this Motion, some of which may require independent testing and
evaluation.
28. On the issue of testing and the like, defendant moves that should there be further testing performed, then
counsel for defendant and/or an expert for the defense be present, and that any samples or the like be preserved
for evaluation and testing by the defense.
29. As additional argument for the discovery sought, counsel refers this court to the new Kentucky Supreme
Court Rule (89–1), specifically Rule 3.8 (SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITIES OF A PROSECUTOR) of the KENTUCKY
RULES OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT, SCR 3.130, which states, in part as follows:
EXHIBIT 12–9 (Continued)
Motion for Discovery in Murder Case

474
■
CHAPTER 12
The prosecutor at all stages of a proceeding shall: . . . (c) make timely disclosure to the defense of
all evidence or information known to the prosecutor that tends to negate the guilt of the accused or mit-
igates the offense, and, in connection with sentencing, disclose to the defense and the tribunal all un-
privileged mitigating information known to the prosecutor, except when the prosecutor is relieved of this
responsibility by a protective order of the tribunal.
The “protective order” to which reference is made is clarified in COMMENT(2). It refers to cases in
which disclosure to the defense may result in substantial harm to an individual or to the public interest.
30. The issue for enhanced discovery in murder cases is best put in the following quotation from Britt v. North
Carolina, 404 U.S. 239 (1971) (n. 7, p. 236):
The excessive disparity between the State and the accused in their respective investigative re-
sources, and the common law’s prohibition against discovery have been summarized by one com-
mentator as follows:
The law enforcement agency is often at the scene of the crime shortly after its commission. While
at the scene, the police have better access to witnesses with fresher recollections.They are authorized
to confiscate removable evidence. In addition, the financial and investigatory resources of law en-
forcement agencies permit an extensive analysis of all relevant evidence.
The defendant has the option of hiring a private investigator. However, the investigator will proba-
bly get to the scene long after the occurrence of the crime and after the police have made their inves-
tigation and removed all relevant physical evidence. The defendant’s investigator may have difficulty
viewing the scene if it is on private property. Witnesses may be less accessible; their recollections will
probably be less precise. Indeed they may choose not to cooperate at all with the defendant’s investi-
gator. However, it may all be irrelevant if, as is often the case, the defendant is unable to afford an in-
vestigator or is incarcerated pending trial.
The defendant is helpless to cope with the uncooperative witness while the prosecutor has nu-
merous means to compel testimony. . . . [Norton, “Discovery in the Criminal Process,” 61 J. Crim. L. C.
& P.S. 11, 13–14 (1970)]
This defendant finds himself in just this posture, and he also is on trial for his life.It seems incongruous to strictly
apply Rules that apply to all criminal cases in this Commonwealth, from “Disorderly Conduct” to “Criminal Trespass
3rd,” to a death penalty proceeding. Taking this approach cannot be reconciled with the “enhanced reliability of the
criminal process when death is possible.” Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586 (1978), and Woodson v. North Carolina, 428
U.S. 280 (1976).

v.
MIGUEL CORDOBA
MOTION FOR SANCTION FOR
DEFENDANT
FAILURE TO PROVIDE TIMELY
DISCOVERY
The defendant, Miguel Cordoba, by counsel, pursuant to C.R.Cr.P. 337(A)(1), moves this Court for an order to
sanction the State for failure to provide the defense with timely discovery. Specifically, defendant requests that the
indictment charging the defendant with a violation of C.R.S. 809.00, a felony, be dismissed with prejudice. In the al-
ternative, the defendant requests the Court for an order reducing the charge to second degree theft, C.R.S. 809.20,
a misdemeanor.
As grounds for said sanction, the defendant states the following:
1. That Mr. Cordoba was indicted on the existing charge on February 12, _____ , and arraigned on February
20, _____ .
2. That Mr. Cordoba, by counsel, filed a motion for discovery on March 2, _____ , that specifically requested a
copy of Roderick Brewer’s grand jury testimony that addresses his basis for determining the value of the allegedly
stolen ring. The motion also requested copies of any written documents stating the assessed value of the ring and
the titles of any written authorities consulted by Mr. Brewer for making his assessment.
3. The Court ordered discovery on March 5, _____ .
4. Despite repeated reminders from defense counsel over a nine-month period, see Appendix A attached to
this motion, the State has yet to provide this information.
5. Further, the defense has repeatedly requested the opportunity to view the ring. . . .
Because trial is scheduled in one week and any delay would now jeopardize defendant’s right to speedy trial,
and because defense has been prevented from having its own expert see the ring and review Mr. Brewer’s basis
for assessing the ring, defense has been denied the opportunity to adequately prepare for trial on the issue of the
value of the ring, with the result that the defendant will be denied a fair trial.
WHEREFORE, based on Columbia’s Rules of Criminal Procedure and the precedents cited in paragraphs
7–10 outlining the appropriate sanctions in these circumstances, the defendant requests that the indictment be dis-
missed or, in the alternative, that the charges be reduced to second degree theft, a misdemeanor.

APPLICATION ASSIGNMENTS
1.
Conduct a brief in-class grand jury hearing with Eldon Spiers from Case I
as the target witness. Draft one or more of the following: an indictment of
Eldon Spiers on an appropriate charge or charges, a motion to dismiss the
indictment on any reasonable grounds, a motion for a bill of particulars,
and the bill of particulars.
2.
Draft a motion for discovery for the attorney defending Eldon Spiers.
3.
Because your defense team failed to notify the prosecution in a timely
manner of the defendant’s intent to use a necessity (duress) defense in a
robbery case as required by the discovery rules, the trial judge sanctioned
the defense by prohibiting it from using that defense. Look at both the
federal and your state rules on discovery sanctions to determine if this is
an appropriate sanction. Then use an electronic research source to look up
People v. Houser, 712 N.E.2d 355 (Ill. App. 1999). Determine if this case
might be useful in preparing an appeal regarding the trial court’s sanction.
4.
LaVallee was tried and convicted of aggravated assault. Eventually he filed
a habeas corpus action arguing that his sentence (ten to thirty years) was
disproportional to the sentence awarded defendants who plea bargained
on the same charge. He argued that he was being penalized for having
exercised his right to a jury trial. How would you decide this case and
why? Would your decision be different if records revealed that in cases
where there was no plea bargain, simply a plea of guilty, defendants got
seven to twenty-one years? Explain. See LaVallee v. Perrin, 466 A.2d 932
(N.H. 1983).
5.
A defendant raised the issue of speedy trial nearly eight years after the
filing of a detainer against him. Because he was illiterate, he relied on oral
representation by Texas authorities that charges in Illinois had been
dropped but found out they were still pending after he learned to read.
Neither the defense nor state was able to show prejudice or lack of
prejudice, but physical evidence against the defendant had been
destroyed. Was his right to a speedy trial violated? See People v. Prince, 611
N.E.2d 105 (Ill. App. 1993).

CHAPTER 13
I.
INTRODUCTION
The trial is the central test not only of the facts and points of law involved in criminal
litigation, but also of the strategy, preparation, and implementation of both the pros-
ecution and defense. The law comes alive in the courtroom, dragging all its history
behind it; the evidence that you so carefully stacked in your side’s favor now stands
or falls under the scrutiny of judge and jury.
At each step you see your case rest on the foundation of your pretrial work, as
well as on the alertness it takes to keep everything in balance throughout the shifting
course of the trial. Research pays off in jury selection, as do on-the-spot impressions.
Careful attention to rules of evidence is vital in preparation, in presentation, and in
noting items for objection, witness impeachment, impact on jurors, and so on. Your
skill at drafting pertinent questions and noting unexpected answers is tested, as is
your work on motions and jury instructions. In short, two very different kinds of skills
contribute to success at trial: the ability to make sometimes slow, painstaking, thor-
ough preparations and the ability to think quickly and adjust amid the flow of events.
This chapter focuses on those aspects of trial that are particularly important or
unique to criminal practice. Acomplete review of general litigation skills goes beyond
the practical scope of this text. It is worth noting that diligent trial preparation and
practice is required not only by the adversary system and, thus, the code of ethics, but
also by the need to avoid costly and time-consuming appeals. This need is reflected
in the statistics showing that 68 percent of death penalty cases are overturned by ap-
pellate courts, often on the basis of incompetence in representation.1
II.
TRIAL RIGHTS
A.
THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL
The rise in religious skepticism in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries undermined re-
liance on the belief in divine intervention to decide criminal cases. With priests for-
bidden to participate in superstition-laden trials by water and fire, a trustworthy
alternative was needed by the increasingly influential civil governments. Most of Eu-
rope chose the inquisitional system, whereas England developed the less oppressive
jury trial. The Magna Carta (1215 A.D.) guaranteed the right to trial by peers; juries,
however, were not truly independent of judicial dominance until 1670. Trial juries are
rooted in the belief that a neutral body should stand between a politically motivated
government and the accused citizen, and that a citizen should not be subject to pun-
ishment by the government until guilt has been proven to the satisfaction of that in-
dependent group of citizens.
These traditions and beliefs have been incorporated into our law. Article 3, Sec-
tion 2, of the United States Constitution states, “The Trial of all Criminals . . . shall be
by jury . . . ,” and the Sixth Amendment adds, “In all criminal prosecutions, the ac-
cused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury . . . to be
confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining
witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.” The
Fifth Amendment requires that trial procedures must comport with due process. Each
of these rights is applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. Juries
are required in the trial of all crimes except petty offenses, juvenile cases, and military
crimes. A petty offense is one having a maximum penalty not to exceed six months’
incarceration [see Duncan v. Louisiana (1968) and Codispoti v. Pennsylvania (1974)]. No
constitutional right to a jury exists, even if the defendant is facing trial on multiple
petty offenses, for which the combined penalties might exceed six months in jail
[Lewis v. U.S. (1996)]. Anumber of states grant jury trials in petty offenses even though
it is not constitutionally mandated. A jury trial may be waived [Rule 23(a) Fed. R.
“Jury service honorably per-
formed is as important in the
defense of our country, its
Constitution and laws, and
the ideals and standards for
which they stand, as the
service that is rendered by
the soldier on the field of
battle in time of war.”
—George H. Boldt, Ameri-
can jurist U.S. v. Beck
(1959)

Trial: Rights, Procedure, Tasks
■483
Crim. P.], but only if the waiver is knowingly and voluntarily given. Even though a
defendant may offer to waive a jury trial, neither the government nor the court is con-
stitutionally required to acquiesce in that request, and a jury trial can still occur
[Singer v. U.S. (1965)]. If a state has a constitutional provision that makes the defen-
dant’s waiver a constitutional right, however, then the prosecution may not be able to
get a jury trial [State v. Baker (Ore. 1999)]. Although a statute that enhances the penalty
of a person for exercising the right to a jury trial is unconstitutional [U.S. v. Jackson
(1968)], a plea bargain that rewards an accused for giving up the right is not.
Twelve jurors are used in capital cases and most felonies. Some states use six ju-
rors for misdemeanors. The federal rules require twelve jurors unless the accused
agrees to fewer. Even without such an agreement, a federal judge can validate a ver-
dict of eleven jurors after the jury has started its deliberations [Fed. R. Crim. P. 23(b)].
A change in Rule 24(c)(3) empowers the court to retain alternate jurors during delib-
erations in case one or more regular jurors have to be dismissed. There is no constitu-
tional magic in the number twelve. Six is acceptable [Williams v. Florida (1970)], but not
five [Ballew v. Georgia (1978)]. Unanimous verdicts, though commonly required, also
are not constitutionally mandated; nine of twelve is acceptable [Apodaca v. Oregon
(1972)], but a unanimous verdict is needed with six jurors [Burch v. Louisiana (1979)].
At least one federal court has ruled that an anonymous jury is acceptable, especially
when witnesses and, therefore, jurors may be in danger [U.S. v. Krout (5th Cir. 1995)].
B.
THE RIGHT TO COUNSEL
The Sixth Amendment and Gideon v. Wainwright (1963) guarantee an accused the
“assistance of counsel for his defense” at trial. The Gideon Court said, “[I]n our ad-
versary system of criminal justice, any person haled into court, who is too poor to
hire a lawyer, cannot be assured a fair trial unless counsel is provided for him.”
Misdemeanants were assured the right to counsel in Argersinger v. Hamlin (1972)
and, even if the court intends to impose only a suspended sentence, in Alabama v.
Shelton (2002). Even if counsel is provided, the right is violated if (1) counsel’s per-
formance is deficient, involving errors so serious that counsel was not functioning
at the level required by the Constitution, and (2) the deficient performance preju-
diced the defendant, involving errors that were so serious that the defendant was
deprived of a fair trial, one where the result is reliable [Strickland v. Washington
(1984)]. The appropriate standard is reasonably effective assistance. This has been
interpreted to include an adversarial testing of the government’s case. Failure to
comply with this standard is termed ineffective assistance of counsel. An attorney’s
decisions on strategy are generally not reviewable. If, however, the attorney’s strat-
egy is based on an unreasonable decision not to investigate an important aspect of
an adequate defense such as mitigation, then the representation is ineffective [Wig-
gins v. Smith (2003)]. Ineffective assistance errors normally involve serious over-
sights such as the failure to present battered person syndrome evidence in a
manslaughter case [People v. Day (Cal. App. 1992)], the failure to call police officers
whose testimony clearly would have impeached that given by the state’s key wit-
nesses [People v. Mejia (Ill. App. 1993)], or the failure to object to the prosecution’s
repeated comments on the defendant’s post–Miranda warning silence [Pennycuff v.
State (Ind. App. 2000)] or the failure to stay awake during periods of a murder trial
[Cockrell v. Burdine (2002)]. In the death penalty case of Florida v. Nixon (2004), the
defense attorney pleaded his retarded client guilty, even though the client had not
agreed to the plea. The attorney hoped the strategy of candor in admitting guilt in
the face of overwhelming evidence of guilt might lead the jury to recommend a
lesser sentence. Although the strategy failed, it was not so unreasonable as to com-
prise ineffective assistance of counsel. Ineffective counsel claims also arise in con-
flict of interest situations—representation by an attorney of the codefendant, for
example—but the defendant must show the conflict “adversely affected” his

484
■
CHAPTER 13
lawyer’s performance [Cuyler v. Sullivan (1980) and Mickens v. Taylor (2002)]. Inef-
fective assistance is often unsuccessful on appeal, but when it is established, the
remedy is reversal and remand.
Pro se (pro per) representation, “for himself,” is self-representation by the defen-
dant. Self-representation is guaranteed under the Sixth Amendment [Faretta v. Cali-
fornia (1975)] but must be entered into knowingly and intelligently. A court may
appoint standby counsel to relieve the court from assisting the defendant on proce-
dural matters [McKaskle v. Wiggins (1984)], or it can end pro se representation if the de-
fendant is disruptive [Illinois v. Allen (1970)]. A pro se defendant cannot later claim
ineffective assistance of his or her own representation. Some experienced defendants
have learned to manipulate the system to gain repeated delays and overturned con-
victions by waffling back and forth between pro se and appointed representation.
Courts, however, turn a deaf ear to such defendants when they claim denial of their
right to counsel [State v. Crisafi (N.J. 1992)]. If a defendant’s mental competency is in
question, pro se representation is a denial of effective counsel, unless the competency
issue is resolved prior to the representation [U.S. v. Klat (D.C. Cir. 1998)].
C.
THE RIGHTS OF PRESENCE AND CONFRONTATION
The right to be present and the right to confront one’s accusers are closely tied to-
gether. The Sixth Amendment’s right of confrontation gives the defendant the right
to see opposing witnesses and to challenge their testimony. To achieve this, the de-
fendant must be present. There is, however, a distinct right to be present that ex-
tends beyond the testimony phase to guarantee the defendant’s presence at most
aspects of the trial. Its source lies solely in procedural due process. The ruling in
U.S. v. Gagnon (1985) restricted a court from placing unreasonable or prejudicial
conditions on the right to be present and did not limit that right to testimonial
stages of the trial. The court may not require the accused to wear handcuffs, shack-
les, or prison clothes. Such conditions violate the due process presumption of in-
nocence [Estelle v. Williams (1976)]. A defendant may be forced to take an
antipsychotic drug for trial only “if the treatment is medically appropriate, is sub-
stantially unlikely to have side effects that may undermine the trial’s fairness, and,
taking account of less intrusive alternatives, is necessary significantly to further im-
portant governmental trial-related interests” [Sell v. U.S. (2003)]. Since adjudication
of guilt is an important government interest, it is, therefore, constitutional to force-
fully render a defendant competent to stand trial if the other conditions mentioned
above are met.
The right to confrontation specifically guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment is
also rooted in the due process quest for fairness. It is of utmost importance, because
it gives the defendant the opportunity to question each witness through cross-exam-
ination; to note and comment on a witness’s inaccuracies, inconsistencies, contradic-
tions, bias, and hostility; to observe and comment on a witness’s demeanor; and to
impeach or otherwise rebut witnesses [Illinois v. Allen (1970)]. In overturning convic-
tions, appellate courts have said that having a witness wear a mask [People v. Sam-
mons (Mich. App. 1991)], allowing a police officer to testify without the defendant
present [Commonwealth v. Rios (Mass. 1992)], and permitting a bailiff to express an
opinion to the jury [Parker v. Gladden (1966)] were all denials of the right to confront
witnesses.
The right to confrontation is essential to fairness, so what should a court do if the
witness is a young child? Should the child who is an important witness in an abuse
or sexual molestation case be subject to intensive cross-examination? Is it better to
protect the child or permit cross-examination in the spirit of avoiding the conviction
and imprisonment of an innocent person? Because such prosecutions are numerous,
the issue is a critical one. In Maryland v. Craig (1990), the Supreme Court ruled that a
child may testify by closed circuit television out of the presence of the accused in spe-
pro se (pro per)
representation:
self-representation by the
defendant.

Trial: Rights, Procedure, Tasks
■485
cial circumstances. In Craig the child was in a separate room with both the prosecutor
and the defense attorney. The child’s testimony was broadcast into the courtroom for
the defendant, the jury, and the judge to see. The defendant could communicate elec-
tronically with the defense attorney, and the judge could rule on objections. Separat-
ing the defendant and the child-witness is permitted only if the court finds
“necessity” to protect the child’s physical and psychological well-being or if the
trauma caused by the presence of the defendant, not simply the courtroom, would be
more than minimal.
More recently the Court ruled that other persons may testify in place of the child
[White v. Illinois (1992)]. The ruling permits doctors and nurses to testify as to what the
child said out of court under a medical treatment exception to the hearsay rule, and
parents and others can testify if the child’s statements were “spontaneous,” another
hearsay exception. Recent studies provide dramatic evidence that young children are
not reliable when repeatedly asked about sexual or other matters. The children in the
studies fabricated elaborate stories; 70 percent of them said their genitals had been
touched when they had not.2
Rape and other sexual assault cases also raise issues involving the right to con-
frontation. Most states have a rape shield law preventing a defendant in a sexual as-
sault case from questioning the victim about or introducing evidence of the victim’s
past sexual conduct. This law places the focus on the relevant conduct of the defen-
dant, rather than on irrelevant past indiscretions of the victim, and makes it easier for
victims to accuse their attackers. If the accused can demonstrate the relevance of the
victim’s past sexual practice to the pending case, however, the court must admit the
evidence or risk reversal of any conviction for denying the right to confrontation. In
a sexual assault case involving alleged sexual conduct with a five-year-old girl, the
rape shield law could not be used to bar testimony that the girl had experienced other
sexual play with her younger brother, because this testimony revealed that the girl
had knowledge relevant to the defense of fabrication [Dixon v. State (Fl. App. 1992)].
If a witness has testified under oath, was subject to cross-examination by the de-
fense at a hearing prior to the trial, and is subsequently unavailable for trial, that wit-
ness’s prior testimony may be read into the record at trial. In Ohio v. Roberts (1980), the
Court added that even an out-of-court statement (not under oath) made by an un-
available witness is admissible against the defendant, if the statement meets certain
indices of reliability. This has been the rule and practice. The Court overruled Roberts
in Crawford v. Washington (2004), however, holding that indices of reliability for such
hearsay were irrelevant, and, unless the witness was available for cross-examination
at trial, the admission of such a statement violates the right of confrontation. Craw-
ford, therefore, dramatically impacts prosecution and, potentially, cases like White v.
Illinois, abuse cases (when police often testify to what the victim said if the victim no
longer wants to press charges), and other exceptions to the hearsay rule3
Exceptions to the admissibility of out-of-court statements include a declaration
by the witness or victim in contemplation of imminent death and the instance when
the defense had a chance to cross-examine the witness at a preliminary hearing but
did not do so. An additional exception is found in Federal Rule of Evidence
801(d)(2)(E) and similar state rules that permit admission of out-of-court statements
by one coconspirator against another, even though the coconspirator may not be
available for cross-examination [Bourjaily v. U.S. (1987)].
Does it violate the right to confrontation and the right to be present to remove or
to bind and gag a disruptive defendant? Illinois v. Allen (1970) ruled that “flagrant dis-
regard . . . of proper conduct . . . cannot be tolerated.” Acourt may hold the defendant
in contempt, bind and gag the defendant, place an electrical shock belt on the defen-
dant, or remove the defendant until he or she promises to behave. Some famous cases
involving repeated disruptions by the defendant and court sanctions include the
“Chicago Seven” [U.S. v. Dellinger (7th Cir. 1972)] and the Charles Manson murder
trial. After repeated outbursts followed by repeated court warnings, Manson was

D.
THE RIGHT TO PRESENT WITNESSES, TO TESTIFY,
OR NOT TO TESTIFY
The defendant has the right to present witnesses at trial, which is guaranteed by ba-
sic due process in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments and the Sixth Amendment
right to compel the attendance of witnesses [Washington v. Texas (1967) and Chambers
v. Mississippi (1973)]. The procedure for subpoenaing witnesses is discussed in Chap-
ter 12. Note that the reach of federal subpoenas in criminal cases is the entire United
States and abroad (28 U.S.C.A. § 1783). Rule 17(b) allows indigents to subpoena wit-
nesses at government expense. The right to present witnesses at trial can include pro-
viding an indigent defendant with an expert witness at public expense [Ake v.
Oklahoma (1985)]. Under the Fifth and Fourteenth amendments, the defendant has the
due process right to testify in his or her own behalf. This right is subject to reasonable
limitations, but such limitations must stand up to constitutional scrutiny. Most rules
of evidence designed to ensure reliability survive this scrutiny. An Arkansas rule pro-
hibiting use of all hypnotically refreshed testimony, however, was unduly restrictive,
because it ignored other factors that, in the defendant’s case, might have shown the
testimony to be sufficiently reliable [Rock v. Arkansas (1987)]. More importantly, the
defendant has the right not to testify, guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment’s right
against self-incrimination. Any attempt by the prosecutor to raise an inference of guilt
by commenting on the defendant’s choice not to testify is a violation of the right suf-
ficient to warrant a new trial or a reversal of any conviction [Griffin v. California (1965)].
Other considerations may raise due process questions. Permitting the courtroom
audience to be 50 percent uniformed prison guards in an already inmate-hostile com-
munity deprived the defendant of a fair trial [Woods v. Dugger (11th Cir. 1991)], and
allowing the prosecutor to designate as witnesses all of the defendant’s friends so
they could be removed from the courtroom was a denial of the right to a public trial
[Addy v. State (Tex. App. 1993)].
III.
FAIR TRIAL VERSUS FREE PRESS
AND PUBLIC ACCESS
The defendant’s right to an impartial jury under both the Fifth and Sixth amendments
can run head-on into the First Amendment’s guarantee of freedom of the press and
public access. At least four concerns arise in this context.
1.
Exposure of jurors and potential jurors to media coverage of the case may
cause prejudgment or make it too difficult to find an impartial juror.
2.
In-court media coverage, especially cameras and television, may increase
political and community pressure on the participants; induce

■487
grandstanding by attorneys, witnesses, and the judge; and heighten jurors’
fears of reprisals from the community or the defendant’s sympathizers.
3.
Media exposure may increase juror susceptibility to bribery and encourage
other corrupt practices.
4.
Extensive in-court media coverage can erode the dignity of the courtroom,
which is essential to at least the appearance of a neutral and fair trial.
Because of the importance granted the freedom of the press, a judge may not for-
bid the press from publishing information about the case. Other remedies are avail-
able to the judge, including “gag orders” preventing attorneys, parties, witnesses, or
other court officials from publicly discussing the case; isolation of both witnesses and
jurors; restraints on in-court conduct of the press; and a change of venue in the case
of significant pretrial publicity [Sheppard v. Maxwell (1966)]. Standard 8-1.1 of the
American Bar Association Standards for Criminal Justice Fair Trial and Free Press is
an excellent resource for what the legal team can and cannot say to the media under
current ethical and judicial standards.
Press and public access extends to most other procedures, such as preliminary
hearings and arraignments, but not to grand jury proceedings. No trial or procedure
may be closed unless there is a compelling government need that clearly overrides
the required openness [Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia (1980)]. Although still
prohibited by federal Rule 53, television cameras do not violate the Constitution, so
criminal trials in their entirety are now televised via cable in many states [Chandler v.
Florida (1981)]. The court has the duty to see that the coverage is unobtrusive and dig-
nified. When done appropriately, video recording and broadcasting of local court
proceedings and cases of national interest, such as the O. J. Simpson case and the im-
peachment trial of President Clinton, not only provide a better record of proceedings,
but also enhance public understanding and scrutiny of our judicial processes.
The most recent debate in this regard is whether cameras should be permitted to
record jury deliberations. Special state supreme court orders in Arizona, California,
and Ohio permitted filming of jury deliberations in several homicide cases for an
NBC News series (In the Jury Room). The Texas Court of Appeals denied a similar re-
quest on the death penalty trial of a 17-year-old defendant.4

THE PARALEGAL’S ROLE IN PREPARATION
FOR TRIAL
A.
INTRODUCTION
The paralegal performs important tasks in preparation for trial. Critical issues re-
garding a defendant’s trial rights may require legal research that might lead to more
pretrial motions. In addition, this section explores the role of the paralegal in organ-
izing the trial notebook, preparing the client and witnesses for court, and generally
supervising trial materials and other matters.
B.
THE TRIAL NOTEBOOK
The trial notebook consists of a ringed binder or electronic version divided into sec-
tions for the necessary documents and materials needed at trial. A typical trial note-
book for a criminal case includes the following sections.
Trial Notebook Sections
■
Reference: table of contents, parties, court personnel, phone numbers, emer-
gency resource persons and numbers, witnesses, case summaries, and chart
of issues and proof.
■
Pleadings and Pretrial: charging documents, any pretrial orders, and last
minute motions.

■
Voir Dire: notes on each juror, most wanted-least wanted, outline of voir dire
questions, authorities researched on any legal issues surrounding challenges
to jurors or other voir dire issues, and final jury chart.
■
Opening Statement: complete text or outline.
■
Order of Proof: outline of the expected order in which evidence will be pre-
sented by both sides.

Closing Statement: complete text or outline, any props to be used, and space
to note additions that come up at trial.
■
Law Section: memo of legal authorities and copy of pertinent rules of evi-
dence or procedure likely to be in issue at trial.
Organization of a trial notebook is a lot of work, but the notebook is an invalu-
able trial tool for both attorney and paralegal. Most offices have a good example to
use as a model.
C.
PREPARATION OF CLIENT AND WITNESSES
You can also assist by preparing witnesses and the client for trial. Well in advance of the
trial date, let them know when they are likely to be needed, and that you will be there
to assist them. Taking the defendant or other key witnesses to the courtroom and let-
ting them sit where they will testify can reduce anxiety. Assisting the lawyer in practic-
ing both direct and cross-examination and evaluating the witness’s demeanor, clothing,
and style can substantially improve the witness’s impact at trial. If your jurisdiction
permits juries to ask questions, as many state and federal courts do, instruct the witness
on the court’s procedure. Normally, juror questions for the witness are screened by the
judge; the attorneys may object to a question at a bench conference. Help make the wit-
nesses comfortable at court. See that any witness fees, especially for expert witnesses,
are ready to be paid. See to it, of course, that the witnesses are subpoenaed for the trial.
Slip-ups here can be disastrous. Subpoenas should go out early for experts, physicians,
technicians, and other busy professionals. Preparing witnesses must be done in close
coordination with your supervising attorney and in accordance with long-established
office guidelines. That is particularly true when using documents to refresh a witness’s
recollection. Even attorney work product documents, not normally discoverable, may
have to be shared with the adverse party if they are used to aid a witness [Fed. R. Evid.
612 and parallel state rules]. Great caution needs to be exercised in this regard.
If necessary, instruct the defendant and family or victim and family on proper
courtroom demeanor. The presence of the defendant’s well-behaved small children
could have an impact on the jury, for example. By contrast, a rape defendant’s “lewd
noises” toward a female juror during recess was enough to result in a mistrial and ad-
ditional charges of intimidating a juror.5
D.
TRIAL MATERIALS
Supervise all trial materials, making sure they are present and kept secure during
trial, recesses, and overnight. Observe the jurors and each witness. Take notes on key
testimony, note in the exhibits log when an exhibit is presented and admitted, and
record the judge’s decision on juror challenges, objections, motions, and other mat-

TRIAL PROCEDURE AND THE
PARALEGAL’S ROLE
A.
VOIR DIRE
1.
Introduction
The list of eligible persons from which jurors are summoned for duty is the venire.
The venire must be a “fair cross-section” of the community under the Sixth Amend-
ment right to an impartial jury. Taylor v. Louisiana (1975) held that the exclusion of
women or other “large, distinctive groups” from the venire is unconstitutional. Equal
protection under the Fourteenth Amendment is denied if the process excludes a racial
or ethnic group. Similarly, an issue is emerging over the routine exclusion in some
states of jurors who do not speak English. About one-third of the states have statutes
that exclude such persons.7 In 2000, the New Mexico Supreme Court issued an order
declaring unconstitutional the exclusion of non-English-speaking jurors [State ex rel.
Martinez v. Third Judicial Dist. Court (N.M. 2000) cited in State v. Singleton (N.M. App.
2001)]. Equal protection has been interpreted to cover not only the selection of the
overall venire, but also the exclusion of potential jurors during voir dire. Potential ju-
rors are selected out of the entire jury pool for that term of court. Those persons are
summoned to the courtroom at the specified time and make up the in-court group
from which the actual jury and possible alternates are selected. A challenge to the
venire must be made before voir dire starts.
Voir dire, meaning to speak the truth, is the in-court questioning of potential ju-
rors by the judge and the attorneys to screen for bias or other reasons for inability to
serve in order to attain an impartial jury. Impartiality is gained, in theory, when each
side eliminates those persons who are most likely to be sympathetic to the other side.
The potential jurors are given preliminary instructions by the court then are asked
questions by the judge and each attorney. Jurisdictions vary on who asks the ques-
tions, the attorneys and the judge or only the judge, but the attorneys are generally al-
lowed to ask questions in criminal cases. The questions are designed to elicit any
information that indicates a bias, such as knowing the defendant or the victim, expo-
sure to extensive pretrial publicity, and the like.
In an effort to screen jurors, each side can use two types of juror challenges. The
first is a challenge for cause where an attorney requests the court to remove a poten-
tial juror on the grounds of bias or other reason. The second is a peremptory
challenge that gives the attorney latitude to strike a potential juror without having to
express any reason for the strike. Challenges for cause are unlimited; peremptory
challenges are limited in number by the applicable rules of procedure. Peremptory
challenges are numerous in death penalty cases (up to twenty) and progressively
fewer in felony and misdemeanor cases.
Issues arise in the process of making challenges for cause and peremptory chal-
lenges. The defendant must refuse to exercise a peremptory challenge to exclude a bi-
ased juror that should have been excluded by the trial court through a challenge for
cause in order for the court to find reversible error [U.S. v. Martinez-Salazar (2000)].
Jurors may not be removed by challenge for cause if they have general scruples
against capital punishment [Wainwright v. Witt (1985)], but if they will automatically

tial juror without having to

vote against the penalty, they may be dismissed [Witherspoon v. Illinois (1968)]. Like-
wise, prospective jurors may be asked if they would automatically vote for the death
penalty [Morgan v. Illinois (1992)]. In either case, jurors must be able to place their oath
and obligation to apply the law above their moral stance toward the penalty. In death
sentence cases, federal jurors must sign a certificate stating that their verdict was not
influenced by race, color, religious belief, national origin, or sex of the defendant or
the victim [18 U.S.C.A. § 3593(f)].
The government’s use of a peremptory challenge to exclude a juror on the basis of
race is an unconstitutional denial of equal protection [Batson v. Kentucky (1986)], re-
gardless of the race of the defendant [Powers v. Ohio (1991)]. Batson requires three steps:
1.
The defendant must allege and prove by a “reasonable inference” that the
prosecution’s use of peremptory challenges was based on race (the
accepted prima facie case). Note that California courts interpret this phrase
as meaning a “strong likelihood” of bias, a tougher burden that has been
challenged but not yet resolved [Johnson v. California (2004)].
2.
Once the prima facie case has been established, the prosecution must
provide a race-neutral justification for the exclusion of the juror [Hernandez
v. New York, (1991) and Purkett v. Elem (1995)].
3.
The court must then look to the surrounding circumstances to decide the
Batson challenge; in other words, determine if the race-neutral explanation
is credible.
In reviewing a trial court’s decision on a Batson claim, some latitude must be given to
the trial court, but the appellate court should not abdicate its responsibility to enforce
Batson [Miller-El v. Cockrell (2003)].
Batson has also been applied by both federal and state courts to prohibit the use
of peremptory strikes of jurors by gender [J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel. T.B. (1994)], and by
religion, disability, age, and other discriminatory factors. Two interesting U.S. Court
of Appeals decisions accept the assumption that peremptory challenges based on re-
ligious affiliation are prohibited, but find that those based on religious belief [U.S. v.
DeJesus (3rd Cir. 2003)] or the level of religious activity [U.S. v. Brown (2d Cir. 2003)]
are permissible. Consult your state’s law and applicable federal decisions.
If a challenge for cause is successful, the juror is discharged and another is se-
lected and questioned. Depending on local practice, it is common that once the ques-
tioning ends, each side exercises its peremptory challenges. It is necessary to place
enough potential jurors in the group to be questioned so that the requisite number of
jurors remain after the peremptory challenges are exercised.
After the jurors are selected, they are sworn in by the judge and instructed not to
discuss the case, even with each other, until told to do so. Any objections to the final
jury panel or the selection process must be made before the jurors are sworn in.
2.
THE PARALEGAL’S ROLE IN VOIR DIRE
Voir dire is an exceptionally important step in the trial process. It is here that impor-
tant and often lasting first impressions are made on the jurors. In addition to provid-
ing information about each juror, the questioning process is a crucial opportunity to
educate the jury on points of law, the theory of the case, or a relevant defense. It is of-
ten used to disarm arguments likely to be made by the opposition and to establish
rapport with the jury. As is true of so much of legal work, good jury selection is no ac-
cident. It is the product of careful preparation and planning. Your role here is a sig-
nificant one.
Preparation for voir dire begins well in advance of the trial date. To begin, you need

cupation, socioeconomic group, and other characteristics, then identify similar charac-
teristics in the prospective jurors. Such profiling is useful in choosing jurors, although
its degree of reliability for predicting juror behavior has probably been overestimated.8
Obtain the questionnaires filled out by each juror for the term from the appropri-
ate clerk of court. These forms vary, but often provide name, age, sex, race, religion,
marital status, number of children, address, occupation, educational level, previous
jury service, organizational memberships, whether the juror has been the victim of a
crime, and more. This information is sufficient for many cases.
Unique or more serious cases require a deeper investigation. Jury selection serv-
ice companies, normally found only in large cities, sell detailed juror information lists.
Although no prospective juror should ever be contacted, neighbors, friends, and oth-
ers can provide information. Sometimes a juror sits on more than one case in a term,
and the attorneys who tried that case, or their paralegals, can provide insights on the
juror. In smaller communities, those persons who seem to know about everyone else’s
business can also help. Public records can be searched. Some investigators even check
the jurors’ cars for revealing bumper stickers.9 Some attorneys employ handwriting
analysts to evaluate the jurors’ writing. Legal teams are increasingly using the Inter-
net to learn more about jurors. Search strategies encompass using prospective jurors’
names or affiliations to turn up personal, work, or association Web sites; checking
public records; and using online service message archives (groups.google.com). To
eliminate any unnecessary work, obtain the names of jurors who have been excused.
Community surveys can be conducted to determine community attitudes, and
thus juror attitudes, on matters pertinent to a case. Asurvey may aim to assess the im-
pact of pretrial publicity or attitudes toward the crime involved, the theory of defense,
or the death penalty, for example. Exhibit 13–1 is an example of instructions for con-
ducting the survey and questions to be asked.10
When courts significantly restrict the time for voir dire, an increasing number of
attorneys file a motion to do their own jury questionnaire. If the motion is granted,
the questionnaire should include biographical and psychological profile questions;
case-specific questions; items on the juror’s relationship to the victim, witnesses, and
attorneys; and any hardship issues.11
Discuss the survey data with your supervising attorney. In serious cases juror se-
lection consultants and psychologists can be employed to assist not only in interpret-
ing data and recommending jury selection strategies, but also in identifying effective
ways to employ what has been learned throughout the trial. Some attorneys use fo-
cus groups to see how various individuals respond to specific evidence and presen-
tation techniques, while still others prefer getting reactions from paralegals, fellow
employees, family, and friends. Locating past studies of jury attitudes in various le-
gal periodicals and trial practice books can be useful. For example, recent studies re-
veal that of those polled, about 50 percent said a judge’s jury instructions should be
ignored to do what the person believed was the right thing; African Americans, His-
panics, and people earning less than $20,000 were highly skeptical of police testi-
mony; 40 percent of those polled and 70 percent of African Americans said minorities
are treated less fairly than others by the system; and a significant number said that
they could not be a fair juror if one of the parties was a homosexual (12 percent, down
from 17 percent in 1998), a computer hacker (20 percent), or a white supremacist (33
percent). The same studies indicated that previous jury experience was a modifying
force in overall attitude toward the system, witnesses, and the parties.12
Condense the pertinent data on each juror onto a juror profile sheet to be placed
into the trial binder. The binder should also contain a fill-in-the-block juror grid sheet
showing the seating arrangement of the jurors. Include in the trial binder a final list
of voir dire questions. Develop the questions from the office’s standard set of voir dire
questions, practice manuals, and other works specifically on jury selection. Tailor and
supplement these canned questions according to the facts and strategies of the case at
hand and according to the demands and procedures of local practice. Confer with

CHAPTER 13
your supervising attorney to refine the list. Here are some points to consider in edu-
cating and questioning jurors.
Educating and Questioning Jurors at Voir Dire
1.
Use questions containing educational information on such matters as the
burden of proof, reasonable doubt, the presumption of innocence, the role
of prosecution and defense, introduction of the defendant, and like
matters; and clarifying that the information or indictment is merely an
accusation and not evidence, and that prejudgments are normal but need
to be spoken of freely and frankly in voir dire.
2.
Draft questions that get jurors talking and thinking, and that reveal their
attitudes: Have you or any close relatives been a victim of a similar or
other crime? Describe it. Have you been accused of a crime? Explain. This
is Ms. _____ the defendant or Mr. _____ the victim. What impressions come
to your mind about this person? Do you have any impression of the
attorneys? What have you heard about the case? What are your friends
and neighbors saying about the case? Do you feel any pressure to decide
the case one way or the other? The defendant has a strong accent; what
impression does this create? The victim was a member of a gang; does this
make you value his life less? Would you be inclined to believe a police
officer more than you would any other witness? What are your thoughts
about the credibility of a person who has been convicted of a crime? What
are your thoughts about the credibility of a spouse or friend testifying
either for or against the defendant?
3.
Draft questions that elicit views on race or ethnicity if pertinent to the case:
How do you feel about the relationship between races in this community?
What statements or comments by others in the community have you heard
suggesting the existence of racism? Have you or a relative or a friend ever
been the victim of a racial or ethnic slur? What is the first thing that comes
to your mind when you find out a person is Italian, homosexual, an artist,
and so forth, and how much stock do you place in such impressions or
generalizations?
4.
Consider drafting some questions for the defendant to ask, especially if
that will be the only time the jurors will hear from the defendant.
5.
Avoid questions that might embarrass the juror or that are too
confrontational. As indicated in item 2, there are ways to get at sensitive
matters more tactfully. Questions should not be condescending or seem
paternalistic; jurors respond best to sincerity, respect, and empathy.
Good voir dire depends heavily on the attorney’s courtroom delivery. Without
good preparation, however, the delivery will suffer.
At voir dire your job is to see that the jury selection binder and any other materi-
als are available for quick access. If jurors gather in a public area before voir dire or
during breaks, go to the area and inconspicuously observe jurors who seem to be
friends, and listen for revealing conversations. In the courtroom, note the jurors’
clothes, jewelry, and other clues. When they answer questions, note hesitancy, tone of
voice, posture, with whom they make eye contact, and how they respond to each at-
torney both verbally and nonverbally. Note significant points on the juror profile sheet
or directly onto the juror seating grid. This information can be used by the attorney to
argue challenges for cause and can be placed in the record if the challenges are denied.
It is also helpful for comparing notes with the attorney in reaching peremptory chal-
lenge decisions. Record selections on the jury grid so you and the attorney will know
who the final jurors are, as well as who was struck or otherwise excused. Once the ju-
rors are selected, keep observing them for clues on which way they are leaning and to
whom they are responding. Such information may assist the attorney in deciding to
call that reserve witness, have the defendant testify, or adjust the closing argument.

■493
B.
OPENING STATEMENTS
Following voir dire and the swearing in of the jury, the attorneys make their opening
statements to the jury. The opening statement is the initial presentation made by the
attorneys to the jury, giving an overview of the case and the evidence to be presented.
It provides the jury with a framework, and gives the attorneys the chance to state the
case from their perspectives. The prosecution makes the first statement. The defense
follows or may reserve its opening statement until just before the presentation of its
own evidence. Opening statements provide a road map of the case for the jury and
are not evidence. You may be asked to suggest approaches and items for the opening
statement and to evaluate it prior to its presentation. Good opening remarks should
attempt to swing the jury to your side of the case, but should never overstate the ev-
idence. Opening statements can be used to soften the impact of the opponent’s case.
C.
THE PROSECUTION’S CASE AND THE PRESENTATION
OF EVIDENCE
1.
The Prosecution’s Case
The prosecution has the burden of proof and, thus, must present its case first. It must
prove, beyond a reasonable doubt that a crime was committed and that the defendant
committed it. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is proof of sufficient weight to exclude
any reasonable explanation other than the defendant’s guilt. Areasonable doubt must
be based in reason and common sense. For example, the state must prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that the defendant was the person that committed the crime. If the
sole evidence was a witness who was fifty feet away from the perpetrator in poor
lighting, it is reasonable to doubt the identification. There is greater doubt if the de-
fense offers alibi testimony. Conversely, if the lighting was excellent, positive identi-
fication was made by two credible witnesses, and no alibi evidence was offered, there
would be no basis for doubt. The government’s burden applies to each element of the
alleged crime. Further, the line of cases from Apprendi to Booker (see Chapter 14) re-
quires the prosecution to present facts to the jury that prove beyond a reasonable
doubt any factors that will be used to enhance a sentence, such as the factual basis for
a hate crime charge or the use of a gun during the commission of a crime.
The prosecution’s case in chief is presented through the testimony of witnesses.
Witnesses may be the victim, police officers, eyewitnesses, forensic experts, physi-
cians, and others. Either side can request the court to allow only one witness at a time
in the courtroom. This procedure is called sequestering or separation of the witnesses,
and is done to prevent the testimony of one witness from influencing the testimony
of the others, the “let’s get our stories straight” syndrome. In addition to stating what
they observed, witnesses identify physical evidence such as important documents,
photographs, weapons, the defendant, and the like.
Witnesses are subject to direct examination from the prosecuting attorney. Direct
examination is the questioning of a witness by the attorney for the party that called
the witness. Direct examination questions must be neutral in nature, such as: What
did you see? What happened next? Leading questions are prohibited. A leading
question attempts to influence the witness by suggesting the answer: The lighting
was poor, wasn’t it, Mr. Witness? You’re the one who fired the weapon, aren’t you, Mr.
Codefendant? If a witness is called on direct examination but becomes hostile to the
examining attorney or is determined by the judge to be hostile to the attorney, or if
the witness is a child, the judge may permit the attorney to ask leading questions.
2.
The Presentation of Evidence
The rules of evidence govern what and how evidence is admitted at trial. When
constructed and applied evenhandedly, they are essential to a fair, reliable, and
opening statement:
the initial presentation made
by the attorneys to the jury,
giving an overview of the
case and the evidence to be
presented.
direct examination:
the questioning of a witness
by the attorney for the party
that called the witness.
leading question:
one that attempts to influ-
ence the witness by sug-
gesting the answer.

material:
topically important to a
matter in issue.
efficient fact-finding process. The Federal Rules of Evidence are used throughout
the federal system and in whole or in part in more than forty states. Even in those
states that have not adopted the federal rules, the basic guidelines and concepts are
similar. Despite their approximate uniformity, it is essential to research the specific
rules and case law in the pertinent jurisdiction, because even the smallest differ-
ence can be significant to a case. Anticipation and diligent preparation are the
means to successfully attacking or defending the admissibility of any important
piece of evidence.
The rules of evidence are sufficiently complex to preclude a detailed discussion
in this text. Nevertheless, here are some generalizations on the most important rules
of evidence.
1.
Evidence must be both material, topically important to a matter in issue,
and relevant, proving or disproving a material fact. The defendant’s
presence at the murder scene, for example, is a material fact in issue, and
the result of an analysis of fingerprints found at the scene is relevant
because it helps prove or disprove the material fact of the defendant’s
presence.
2.
Hearsay is secondhand testimony, a statement that is offered by the
witness as the truth, but that was made by someone other than the witness
about what that other person saw, heard, said, or did. Hearsay is
inadmissible because it is basically unreliable and the original declarant is
not subject to in-court scrutiny. Exceptions stem from circumstances that
are likely to make the statement more reliable and include dying
declarations, spontaneous statements (res gestae), statements against one’s
own interest, statements made in other hearings under oath and subject to
cross-examination, statements of coconspirators, and others. A number of
exceptions to the hearsay rule are found in the Federal Rules of Evidence
803–804 and parallel state rules. As previously mentioned, some of these
common exceptions may be reevaluated in light of the holding in Crawford
v. Washington (2004).
3.
Documents and other physical evidence must be authenticated to be
admissible. A witness must have the knowledge to be able to identify the
item as that which it purports to be or to establish a chain of possession to
show some other item has not been substituted for the original. Some
documents are authenticated by a government seal or other certification.
4.
Laypersons are permitted to give opinions on matters of general
knowledge such as estimates of speed or distance.
5.
Expert witnesses can give opinions on scientific or similarly complex
matters if their qualifications in the pertinent field are established and the
basis for their conclusion is reliable (not just trendy junk science).
6.
Documents must be the original or, in some cases, an authenticated
photocopy. This requirement is called the best evidence rule.
7.
Admissible evidence may be excluded if its inflammatory or prejudicial
nature outweighs any probative value.
8.
Evidence of prior acts or crimes is inadmissable unless it shows a pattern
of conduct relevant to proving the crime at hand.
9.
Privileged information is inadmissable (Fed. R. Evid. 501). Privileges
include communication between husband-wife, clergy-penitent,
attorney-client, physician-patient, and, in a few jurisdictions, reporter-
informant. Regarding the spousal privilege, “It is a maxim that man and
wife should never have it in their power to hang one another.”13 Some
exceptions to the privilege doctrine have been carved out in some states
and federal circuits allowing psychotherapists, counselors, and social
workers to reveal threatening or incriminating statements of their
patients or clients.

Evidence of character to show that a person’s conduct at a particular time
conformed to that character trait is inadmissible except (1) evidence of
general moral character or a pertinent character trait offered by the
accused or by the prosecution in rebuttal, (2) evidence of a pertinent
character trait of the victim of the crime offered by the accused or by the
prosecution in rebuttal, or (3) evidence of peacefulness of the victim
offered by the prosecution in a homicide case to counter character evidence
that the victim was the aggressor [Fed. R. Evid. 404(a)(1–2)]. Once the
defendant offers evidence of a specific trait of character of the alleged
victim, the prosecution can offer evidence of the same character trait of the
accused [Fed. R. Evid. 404(a)(1)]. Admissible, as well, is evidence of the
character of a witness if it pertains to truthfulness.
As standards for admissibility, the rules of evidence establish that the evidence
must tend to prove something of value in deciding the issues, it must by its nature
and as judged by human experience be reliable, and its probative value must not be
outweighed by its likely prejudicial or sensational nature. An objection to the admis-
sion of evidence must be made prior to or at the time the evidence is submitted or
asked for, and the objection must normally be related to a specific rule of evidence.
Improper rulings by the judge on the admissibility of evidence can be appealed only
if the objection is made in a timely manner and placed in the trial record. How fre-
quently an attorney decides to object may be based partly on strategy that takes into
account the impact of the objection on the jury.
Here is a sampling of rulings from various jurisdictions on evidentiary matters
raised at trial by objection.
■
Global positioning system data were held admissible to show the defendant
was stalking the victim [People v. Sullivan (Colo. 2002)].
■
Evidence of acts subsequent to the crime charged was held admissible [U.S.
v. Bibo-Rodriquez (9th Cir. 1991)].
■
A victim’s felony conviction that was more than ten years old was admissi-
ble for purposes of impeachment [State v. Askew (Conn. 1998)].
■
A photograph showing a massive maggot infestation of the child-victim’s
body in a murder case was inadmissible [Funk v. Commonwealth (Ky. 1992)].
■
A computer animation of a fall off a roof was not admissible in a civil case
where the plaintiff could not remember the fall, and there was no witness to
confirm the accuracy of the event’s portrayal [Brown v. Boise-Cascade Corp.
(Or. App. 1997)].
3.
Other Evidentiary Considerations
Evidence is either direct or circumstantial. Direct evidence is based on a witness’s
firsthand knowledge and proves a fact in issue without relying on inference or other
evidence. A witness’s testimony that the witness saw the defendant commit the crime
is direct evidence. Circumstantial evidence, indirect evidence, proves a point by in-
ference. Testimony by police that the defendant’s baseball cap was found at the scene
of the crime raises the inference that the defendant was at the scene.
Presumptions also play an important role in evidence. A presumption is a rule of
law that requires the trier of fact to conclude on threshold evidence that an ultimate fact
is true. Most presumptions are rebuttable presumptions, meaning that the ultimate
fact can be shown not to be true by other evidence. An example of a rebuttable pre-
sumption is that a person is intoxicated if the blood-alcohol level reaches the statutory
amount. Evidence that shows the testing method to be faulty rebuts the presumption

496
■
CHAPTER 13
of intoxication, dissolving its force. An irrebuttable presumption requires that the ul-
timate fact be treated as true once the threshold evidence has been introduced. For ex-
ample, once it is proven that a child is less than seven years of age, the law says the child
cannot commit a felony. Evidence to the contrary is of no consequence.
Eyewitness testimony is an important form of evidence, but deserves a healthy dose
of skepticism. Of sixty-two inmates exonerated by scientific tests by 2000, fifty-two of
the cases involved mistaken eyewitness identification.14 Some courts now permit the
admission of expert witness testimony on the accuracy of eyewitness identification [for
example, Commonwealth v. Christie (2003)]. Informant testimony, often in return for a re-
duced sentence, is also fraught with problems [Benn v. Lambert (9th Cir. 2002)].
Scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge is often critical to a criminal
case. Tests may be employed to identify and match blood and hair types, measure
blood-alcohol levels, detect the presence of telltale chemicals or identify substances, an-
alyze threads from clothing, determine the presence of semen, match a spent bullet to
a specific gun (ballistics), identify a body, and a host of other purposes. The long-ac-
cepted standard for the admissibility of such evidence set out in Frye v. U.S. (D.C. Cir.
1923) has been superseded by Rules 702 and 703 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and
parallel state rules [Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (1993)]. These rules pro-
vide a more flexible standard for admissibility of scientific and technical expert testi-
mony. They focus on the scientific validity of the principles involved and their relevance
and reliability, rather than solely on whether the methodology used is accepted in the
scientific community. Factors such as the method’s rate of error, whether the method
lends itself to testing and peer review, and whether it has gained general acceptance in
the scientific community should be considered. Subsequently, the Court ruled that the
standard for review of the ruling on the admission of the expert witness’s evidence was
whether the trial court had abused its discretion [General Electric v. Joiner (1997)].
Daubert was expanded to encompass not just scientific experts, but also other experts
whose testimony is based on technical or other specialized knowledge in Kumho Tire Co.
Ltd. v. Carmichael (1999). Under Daubert, the trial court is given considerable discretion
to determine if a witness qualifies as an expert and whether the expert testimony is ad-
missible. Some states retain the less flexible Frye test. Check local practice.
Because the use of expert witnesses is common in both civil and criminal law, the
jury’s role of assessing the credibility of such witnesses is significant. Therefore, some
courts permit inquiry at trial on the amount of the expert’s compensation and other
factors that might impact on the witness’s objectivity [Wrobleski v. Nora de Lara (Md.
1999) and Tuttle v. Perry (Ky. 2002)]. At least one commercial service tracks the latest
Daubert rulings at both the state and federal levels (www.Dauberttracker.com).
Admission of polygraph (lie detector) evidence remains controversial. Estimates
of its reliability range from 40 to 90 percent. Many states allow it if the defense and
prosecution agree to its admission prior to the defendant’s taking the test. In a case
involving a military ban on the use of polygraph evidence, the Supreme Court ruled
that it was not a denial of the defendant’s Sixth Amendment rights to ban the use of
such evidence [U.S. v. Scheffer (1998)].
Admission of expert testimony on handwriting analysis to determine authorship
or authenticity of signatures can encompass opinion on unique writing styles or char-
acteristics. Such evidence helped convict Theodore Kaczynski, the “Unibomber.”
Computers make such stylistic comparisons an even more powerful crime-solving
device by facilitating searches of huge databanks of written materials.
Tests to match DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) specimens gathered at a crime scene
with those from a defendant are normally admissible. This genetic material found in
human cells is unique to each person. Hair, saliva, semen, blood, skin, and other bio-
logical substances in amounts no larger than a pinhead can be analyzed. The chance
of an erroneous match is nearly nonexistent if the analysis is done properly. FBI and
state databanks consisting of DNA specimens from convicted felons and from crime
scenes make DNA an extremely powerful crime-fighting tool. It has been so effective
that law enforcement agencies want to expand the DNA data pool to include all peo-
irrebuttable presumption:

fact be treated as true once

ple arrested. Opponents of databank expansion express concern because of its possi-
ble misuse against innocent people in the future.
DNA evidence not only helps convict the guilty; it also exonerates the innocent.
The large number of false convictions exposed by DNAanalysts raises legitimate con-
cern for how often our system convicts innocent people, especially because some of
those exonerated were on death row.
Despite its unassailable reputation for reliable identification, DNA printing does
not assure a conviction. Like all scientifically and technically based tests, its reliabil-
ity can be attacked, as it was in the O. J. Simpson case, not as bad science, but on the
basis of how the evidence was collected and stored, the competency of the forensic
technicians involved, and the chance that blood specimens were planted by the po-
lice. Revelations of faulty lab procedures, overworked technicians, falsified expert
testimony, and the shortage of accredited forensic labs continue to plague the relia-
bility of DNA evidence
Hair match analysis, once considered reliable evidence, has been relegated to the
level of “junk science” (except when it is used to extract DNAsamples). Such is the case
of evidence revealed under hypnosis. Unfortunately, junk science and the misapplica-
tion of forensic science was a pivotal cause in one-third of the wrongful convictions dis-
covered by the Innocence Project atYeshiva University.15 Flaws have also been revealed
in fingerprint analysis, including the electronic matching of fingerprints, and in the
process of chemically connecting a bullet to a particular crime scene or defendant.16
The role of electronic evidence to show where a person has been (to discover a
buried body, for example) and what a person has said or done is increasingly impor-
tant to the prosecution of criminal cases. This evidence can include e-mails, electronic
documents, digital photos, statistical data, and cell phone and global positioning
records. Most courts admit such evidence if a witness can testify to the authenticity of
the information, which can simply be a description of how the evidence was recovered
and what software was used to recover it [U.S. v. Scott-Emuakpor (W.D. Mich. 2000)].
Digital information, such as a digital photo, can be altered, of course. Electronic signa-
ture technology, however, records any changes to the original, which means that the
electronic signature may become the standard for authentication in the future.17
Scientific and technically based evidence must be scrutinized by the prosecution,
the defense, and the court for reliability. Here are some lines of inquiry that are often
used to test the reliability of scientific and technical evidence.

Lines of Inquiry Regarding Scientific or Technical Evidence
■
Is the test or analysis based on valid scientific principles?
■
Is the analysis based on valid, reliable data, and are there adequate stan-
dards for drawing the necessary conclusions?
■
Are there substances other than an illegal one, such as drugs, that will cause
false readings?
■
Was the required procedure as directed in the operating manual followed
faithfully?
■
Was the machine or testing device in proper working order as proven by ap-
propriate sample runs, periodic recalibration, cleaning, and purging of pre-
vious test materials?
■
Was the lab technician properly trained and qualified to conduct the test and
interpret the results? (See Fed. R. Evid. 702 and parallel state rules.)
■
Were the results clear and unambiguous?
■
Was the sample used for testing:
a.
unquestionably the defendant’s (proper chain of custody and
segregation of sample), and
b.
free of contaminants from the point of collection through actual testing?
■
Could the evidence have been planted, and was there motive to do so?
■
Has the expert witness reliably applied the relevant principles and methods
to the facts of the case?
These questions offer important guidance in the proper collection and preserva-
tion of evidence. They are equally important for cross-examination of forensic tech-
nicians, scientific experts, and other witnesses. Keep these standards in mind as you
consider evidence that should be presented or challenged at trial. These lines of in-
quiry have been particularly useful in cases involving drug analyses, breath tests,
radar readouts, and blood and semen analyses. A useful publication is the FBI’s Sci-
entific Aids in Criminal Investigation: Suggestions for Handling of Physical Evidence.
Either side in a criminal case may make use of demonstrative evidence.
Demonstrative evidence is an audiovisual aid such as a diagram, chart, timeline,
photograph, model, videotape, or computer graphic designed to enhance the
jury’s understanding of the evidence. The use of such evidence is subject to the
judge’s broad discretion based on a balancing of the item’s probative value against
its tendency to misrepresent, confuse, delay, or be prejudicial (Fed. R. Crim. P. 403
and parallel state rules).
Many paralegals have developed excellent skills in preparing and using demon-
strative evidence and assisting at trial in its presentation. Demonstrative evidence
may require no more than preparation of a simple chart, or it may involve retaining
a company to prepare a detailed and dramatic computer animation. To fully assist
your supervising attorney, become familiar not only with the graphics software and
presentation equipment, but also with the rules in your area for presenting demon-
strative evidence. Continually look for ways such evidence can be used to better pres-
ent each case. Judges and juries alike increasingly expect sharp visual presentations.
Whether you are preparing demonstrative evidence or simply considering the most
effective way to get maximum jury attention, keep the following general rules in mind.
General Rules for Maximizing Juror Attention18
■
Attention wanes after twenty minutes, so something needs to be done to
change pace or get attention at that point. This is a good time to use demon-
strative evidence.
■
Attention is highest at the beginning of a presentation and at the very end.
■
Color gets more attention than black and white.
■
The larger the display the more impact it has.
■
Location of key data on a page or a chart is important; the top of the chart or
page gets more attention than the bottom, and the left side more than the right.

D.
DEFENSE CROSS-EXAMINATION
OF PROSECUTION’S WITNESSES
Before each prosecution witness leaves the stand, the defense may conduct cross-
examination. Cross-examination of key witnesses can be long and aggressive. It is a
critical weapon for testing each witness and for impeachment. Relentless investiga-
tion on each witness and research into case decisions on the rules of evidence are the
cornerstones to effective cross, or to anticipating cross and protecting a witness from
improper cross. In one case, for example, the defense discovered that two of three vic-
tims in an alleged child molestation case had made prior false accusations against an-
other babysitter for acts similar to those charged against the defendant. The trial
court, on the prosecution’s argument, denied admission of the prior accusations. The
state’s appellate court, however, overturned the trial court and allowed the prior false
accusations to be used for impeachment [Strickland v. State (Ga. App. 1992)].
The O. J. Simpson case and more recent media coverage has heightened juror’s
awareness that some law enforcement officers and prosecutors have been implicated
in hiding, altering, and planting evidence, and lying to secure convictions. Further,
the government has been known to provide “rewards” to witnesses, who themselves
are facing prosecution or have felony records, to testify against a defendant. In the
face of public concern for the reliability of prosecutorial evidence, both prosecution
and defense teams must carefully plan how best to defend and attack witnesses in the
era of such public knowledge.
As previously mentioned, the attorney conducting cross-examination can use lead-
ing questions. Using the brainstorming process discussed in the section on preparing
for the preliminary hearing, you can generate ideas and questions for cross-examina-
tion. Be alert for unexpected openings by the government’s questioning. Suggest ques-
tions that the defense attorney might use to take advantage of any such opportunities.
Although a government witness has been through direct and cross-examination,
the prosecution may conduct redirect examination. Redirect examination is the ques-
tioning of the witness by the party that called the witness to undo or limit any dam-
age done during cross-examination. This is called rehabilitating the witness. Redirect
examination of a witness may be followed by recross. Leading questions are not per-
mitted on redirect examination, but they are in recross. The scope of questions in redi-
rect is limited to material raised in the preceding cross-examination. Likewise, the
scope of recross is limited to matters raised in redirect.
E.
MOTION FOR JUDGMENT OF ACQUITTAL
Generally at the close of the prosecution’s case, the defense submits a motion for
judgment of acquittal, sometimes called a motion to dismiss or a motion for directed
verdict (Fed. R. Crim. P. 29). This motion asserts the argument that the prosecution’s
case has failed to show sufficient proof on one or more elements of the case and, thus,
the evidence is inadequate to sustain a conviction (Rule 29). In other words, the mo-
tion argues that the state has failed to prove a prima facie case. If the judge finds the
evidence is lacking to meet this threshold requirement, the case is dismissed. Judges
normally do not grant this motion unless the weaknesses in the evidence are quite
obvious. Appellate courts tend to give trial judges considerable latitude on this point.
redirect examination:
the questioning of the wit-
ness by the party that called
the witness to undo or limit
any damage done during
cross-examination.

■
CHAPTER 13
Generally, this motion must be made at this point in order to renew the motion at the
close of the defense’s evidence and any rebuttal. An example of a general form for a
motion for judgment of acquittal is presented in Exhibit 13–3.
F.
DEFENDANT’S CASE IN CHIEF
The defendant’s case in chief is next and may be preceded by defense counsel’s open-
ing statement if not given earlier. The defense occasionally chooses not to place any
evidence before the court. It is not necessary, because the government has the burden
of proof. If the government has established a good case, however, it is normally dan-
gerous for the defense to choose not to counter. In presenting its case, the defense calls
its witnesses and enters its exhibits and other evidence. Because this is direct exami-
nation, defense counsel must avoid leading questions.
Probably the most agonizing decision that must be made is whether the defendant
should testify. The FifthAmendment affords the right not to testify. The defendant who
testifies is open to intensive cross-examination, possible impeachment by an otherwise
inadmissible confession or statement, and the temptation to commit perjury. Choosing
not to testify disappoints the jury, however. It may raise doubts about the defendant’s
innocence or concern that the defendant is hiding something, even though the jury can
be instructed not to make any inferences from the defendant’s decision not to testify.
Each defense witness is subject to cross-examination by the prosecution. Although
the defendant can be impeached through the prosecution’s use of an inadmissable but
inconsistent statement made by the defendant [Harris v. N.Y. (1971) and U.S. v. Havens
(1980)], a defense witness may not be impeached with inadmissable evidence [Walder
v. U.S. (1954)]. The defense rests its case on completion of its presentation of evidence.
G.
PROSECUTION’S REBUTTAL AND DEFENDANT’S
REJOINDER
Following the close of the defendant’s case, the prosecution can call additional witnesses
to rebut new matter raised by the defense. Rebuttal witnesses are restricted to this pur-
pose. In Tome v. U.S. (1995) the Court limited what prosecution witnesses could testify
to in rebutting the defense claim that a child alleging sexual abuse had an improper mo-
tive. The Court said the normally admissible, consistent, out-of-court statement by the
child was inadmissible, because it was made after the improper motive may have arisen.
The defense may call rejoinder witnesses for the sole purpose of countering mat-
ters and evidence produced during the prosecution’s rebuttal. Both rebuttal and re-
joinder witnesses are subject to cross-examination.

and otherwise harmful statements by the prosecution on cross-examination.

dant should testify. Do you think Eldon Spiers should testify?

used in some states. This motion is granted by the court only if it is clear, as a matter
of law, that the prosecution has failed to prove its case. Judges hesitate to substitute
their judgment for the jury’s after the jury has heard the case for hours, days, or
longer. Ajudge under the federal rules may reserve ruling on the motion for judgment
of acquittal until after the jury has returned a verdict [Rule 29(b)].
I.
JURY INSTRUCTION CONFERENCE
The court recesses while the attorneys and the judge go into the judge’s chambers to
consider instructions to be given to the jury. Both sides must present any proposed
jury instructions to the judge in writing with the appropriate request (Fed. R. Crim. P.
30) and the support of legal authority. The judge considers each proposed instruction
and makes a decision based on the arguments presented, the apparent fairness of the
instruction, the adequacy or inadequacy of the jurisdiction’s set of standard or rec-
ommended jury instructions, and whether sufficient evidence was presented to war-
rant giving the instruction. The judge cannot give an instruction on self-defense, for
example, if no evidence has been presented on this point.
You can play a vital role in preparing for the jury instruction conference. You need
to research both the applicable standard instructions plus any alternative or unique
instructions. An excellent source for jury instructions is Federal Jury Practice and In-
structions, by West Group. Alternative or unique instructions can be found in crimi-
nal practice manuals, previous case files, and pertinent case law. The case law or
rationale for an alternative or unique instruction must be well established before a
judge is likely to substitute it for one of the standard instructions. Moreover, the legal
basis for a rejected instruction should be established in order to preserve an appellate
issue based on the court’s rejection of the instruction or, similarly, on the court’s ac-
ceptance of a flawed instruction.
Once the instructions are researched, draft the set of proposed instructions and
give them to your supervising attorney for review. When approved, an original set is
prepared for the judge and copies are made for the opponent and for your attorney.
Place these sets in the trial notebook. The set of copies for your supervising attorney
should include a checkoff box indicating “accepted” or “rejected.”
J.
CLOSING ARGUMENTS
Court is reconvened and the attorneys deliver their closing arguments to the jury. Again,
the government presents its statement first. Many jurisdictions permit the government
to follow the defense argument with a second but usually brief rebuttal argument (Fed.
R. Crim. P. 29.1 and parallel state rules). The purpose of closing arguments is to highlight
key evidence and assist the jury in weighing and drawing inferences from that evidence.
From the point of view of the advocates, it is a time to make one final effort to win over
the jury by deflecting the impact of the opponent’s evidence and increasing the impact
of their own. Persuasion is the ultimate aim. The jury is instructed, however, that closing
arguments are not evidence. Limits are imposed on how far the attorneys can go in try-
ing to be persuasive. Attorneys may ask the jurors to return a verdict of guilty or not
guilty but are forbidden to state their personal belief about the defendant’s guilt or in-
nocence. They may not argue any evidence at closing that was not admitted at trial, and
they may not make any inflammatory or other remarks likely to mislead or prejudice the

jury. Prosecutors must be particularly careful in this regard. Prosecutorial closing argu-
ments were held to be improper in the following circumstances.
■
The prosecutor commented that the defendant’s nontestimonial demeanor
was not that of an innocent man [Mayberry v. State (Tex. App. 1992)].
■
The prosecutor used Bible-based arguments, saying, “the murderer shall be
put to death,” in a death penalty case [Commonwealth v. Chamber (Pa. 1991)].
Similarly, a prosecutor’s use of biblical quotes to justify the death penalty
improperly “urge[d] the jury to follow religious mandates . . . rather than
Georgia law” [Carruthers v. State (Ga. 2000)].
■
The prosecutor in an arson case repeatedly referred to the defendant’s
smokescreen [People v. Kidd (Ill. 1992)].
■
The prosecutor told the jury that the authority to make the decision on the
death penalty rested largely with the appellate court, and not with the jurors
[Clark v. Commonwealth (Ky. 1991)].
■
The prosecutor in a case involving one charge of indecent liberty told the
jury to send the accused a message “that we’re not gonna let him do this to
the children of the community” [Wilson v. Bruce (D. Kan. 1993)].
■
A prosecutor’s comment that because the defendant could hear the testi-
mony of all the other witnesses, he had the advantage of being able to “fit”
his testimony into the evidence, however, was not an undue burden on the
defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to be present [Portuondo v. Agard (2000)].
The court may try to correct the damage of such a statement by instructing the
jury to disregard it; if the likely prejudice seems too great, however, the judge may
have no choice but to declare a mistrial. Can the defense, in an obviously lost cause,
comment to so prejudice the jury as to necessitate a mistrial? No, the defense cannot
be awarded a mistrial for its own misconduct, but contempt sanctions may be im-
posed, accompanied by a corrective instruction to the jury.
K.
JUDGE’S INSTRUCTIONS TO THE JURY
When instructing the jury, the judge may start by reading the information or indictment
and telling the jury that the document is an accusation only and is not to be considered
as evidence. The duty of the jurors to adhere to the instructions is reiterated, as well as
their role as sole judge of the facts. The jury is reminded that the defendant is innocent
until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on each element of the crime. Some ju-
risdictions permit an instruction for jurors to find the defendant not guilty unless they
believe that guilt has been proven to a moral certitude. The court instructs on direct and
circumstantial evidence and any permissible inferences, credibility of witnesses and im-
peachment, the right of the jury to accept or reject the opinions of expert witnesses, and
how to treat demonstrative evidence. The pertinent crime, its elements, and any tech-
nical terms are defined. Lesser included offenses are covered, as well as the elements,
terms, and burden of proof for any applicable defenses. The court may instruct that the
defendant has the right not to testify and no inference of guilt should be drawn for ex-
ercising that right. In jurisdictions where the jury determines the sentence, the jurors are
instructed on the permissible range of the penalty and, in some jurisdictions, the impact
of probation and parole eligibility. Some courts permit instruction on what will happen
to the defendant found not guilty by insanity. The court will cover the procedure for de-
liberation, including the election of a foreperson, the need for unanimity, restrictions on
items to be taken into the jury room, communications with the judge, and restrictions
on outside conversations. Any objection to an instruction or the omission of an instruc-
tion must be made before the jury retires to deliberate (Fed. R. Crim. P. 30).

JURY DELIBERATION
In an attempt to develop more meaningful jury deliberation, more courts allow jurors
during trial to take notes, keep juror notebooks with preliminary instructions, ask

of something doubtful.”

though the law and evidence
dictate otherwise.
questions, listen to interim summaries by the lawyers, and hold midtrial discussions.
These procedures, which are limited to civil cases in some jurisdictions, increase jury
participation and may improve the quality of jury deliberations.
When the jury adjourns to the jury room for deliberation, any alternate jurors may
or may not be excused [Fed. R. Crim. P. 24(c)(3)]. In lengthy and particularly serious
cases or where public feelings are likely to run high, the jury may be sequestered,
which means that when the jury is not deliberating, the jurors are confined to a hotel
under the close scrutiny of the bailiff. In such circumstances, jurors are denied access
to media coverage of the trial. Even when not sequestered, the jury is supervised at
meals and other recesses and instructed to avoid media reports or personal discus-
sions of the case outside of the deliberations.
Jury deliberations are not public, but posttrial interviews and other sources reveal
how much individual personalities and group dynamics impact on the process of
reaching a verdict. It is here that the careful preparation for selection of jurors and the
presentation of evidence pays off. Occasionally, that one individual you identified as
having an influential personality determines the outcome.
Jurors are admonished to follow the judge’s instructions and the law contained in
them. They do, however, have the latitude of deciding a case contrary to the law. This
privilege, seldom brought to the attention of the public, is called jury nullification (or
jury pardon). It gives juries the right to find a defendant not guilty even though the
law and evidence dictate otherwise. If juries believe that a law is being unjustly ap-
plied, is a bad law, or that the victim is more responsible for the crime than the de-
fendant, jury nullification is proper. Judges rarely instruct juries on this privilege and
are not required to do so even if asked [U.S. v. Dougherty (D.C. Cir. 1972)]. Attorneys
are not allowed to suggest to the jury that they resort to jury nullification, although
they may be allowed to invite nullification by arguing that the penalty awaiting the
defendant on conviction is unreasonable [U.S. v. Datcher (M.D. Tenn. 1993)]. Califor-
nia does not allow jury nullification [People v. Williams (Cal. 2001)].
Juries can become deadlocked, especially when unanimous verdicts are required.
Unless the deadlock is resolved in a reasonable period of time, the judge may be
forced to declare a mistrial, voiding all that has occurred at trial as though the trial
were never held. To avoid a mistrial brought on by a deadlocked jury, a judge is per-
mitted to give the jury an Allen charge. The Allen charge instructs the jury to pay def-
erence to their fellow jurors and reexamine the evidence and their own views [Allen
v. U.S. (1896)]. Controversial because of its “third degree” nature, the message is that
the court wants each juror to do everything reasonable to come to a group decision.
If this instruction fails, the judge declares a mistrial, and the state must decide
whether to retry the defendant at some later date. Allen charges have been the cause
for numerous appeals to the federal courts. In Early v. Packer (2002), the Supreme
Court held that federal courts should, generally, defer to state court determinations
on Allen charges. In Jones v. U.S. (1999), the Supreme Court ruled that jurors deliber-
ating on a sentence of death do not have to be told that, if they cannot agree on the
death penalty, the default penalty is life in prison without parole. Such an instruction
might prevent holdouts from ultimately agreeing to the death sentence.
Other grounds for mistrial or appeal can occur during deliberations. The judge
may erroneously allow alternate jurors to participate in deliberations or a juror may be-
come ill or otherwise unable to continue. If alternate jurors have not been retained [Rule
24(c)(3)], the federal rules [Rule 23(b)] and parallel state rules permit the case to con-
tinue with eleven jurors. Continuance with fewer than eleven jurors requires an agree-
ment by both parties. Juror misconduct can occur. It comes in three typical varieties:
improper consideration of extraneous evidence (the Bible, a dictionary, an Internet
source, or juror expert opinion, such as that of a nurse), improper third-party contact (a
bailiff or escorting officer renders an opinion of the case), and lack of candor in voir dire
(lying).19 Due process and the right to confrontation are the applicable legal principles.
It is likely that courts will continue to reform jury procedure. The new ABA Prin-
ciples for Juries and Jury Trials (2005) provides added impetus to reform efforts.
Allen charge:
instruction to a deadlocked
jury to pay deference to fel-
low jurors and to reexamine
the evidence and their own
views to come to a group
decision.

CHAPTER 13
M.
JURY VERDICT AND POLLING
When the jury notifies the judge that it has reached a verdict, court is reconvened.
The written verdict is handed to the judge, who checks to see that it is in proper
form, then it is usually returned to the foreperson or the clerk to be read aloud. It is
customary for the defense team to stand with the defendant during the reading of
the verdict.
Either side may request the court for a polling of jurors [Fed. R. Crim. P. 31(d)].
The judge asks each juror if the verdict is consistent with his or her vote. If not, the
jury must go back to deliberate. If all is in order and the verdict is not guilty, the de-
fendant is discharged; if guilty, the defendant is remanded to custody or granted bail
until sentencing or pending any appeal.
VI.
POSTTRIAL MOTIONS
A.
PURPOSE
On television or in the movies, the case seems to be over at the return of the jury’s ver-
dict. In a significant number of criminal cases, however, this is just the beginning of
the important posttrial motions and possible appeal stages. Posttrial motions are es-
sential because they isolate those things at trial that are likely to be appealed. They
also give the trial court one last chance to correct any errors before the matter is ap-
pealed to a higher court.
B.
TYPES OF POSTTRIAL MOTIONS
Posttrial motions come in several forms. The most common are a motion for judgment
notwithstanding the verdict and a motion for a new trial. In the federal system, a mo-
tion for judgment of acquittal can be renewed or made within seven days of the dis-
charge of the jury [Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(c)].
The motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) requests the court
for an order entering a judgment contrary to the verdict. Generally, a court must find
that the weight of the evidence is contrary to the verdict. In some jurisdictions a mo-
tion for dismissal or directed verdict has to have been made earlier in order to move
for a JNOV. For all practical purposes, this motion has been supplanted in the federal
system by the motion for judgment of acquittal.
A motion for a new trial is based on alleged error at trial or new evidence that for
the sake of justice requires that judgment be set aside (vacated) and a new trial be held
(Fed. R. Crim. P. 33). Typical grounds for a motion for a new trial or related motions
allege erroneous rulings on the admissibility of evidence, impaneling of the jury, pros-
ecutorial misconduct, new evidence, lack of jurisdiction, improper jury instructions,
and the like. The federal rules require a motion for new trial to be made within seven
days after the verdict. It can be made up to three years later if its basis is the finding
of new evidence. If granted, the judge may vacate the judgment of guilt and enter the
taking of new evidence (Rule 33).
Some of these motions are predictable and can be drafted in advance and placed
in the trial notebook for submission at the appropriate time. Notes that you have
taken at trial assist in identifying other matters that are appropriate for a posttrial mo-
tion. You may be asked to draft the motion and do the necessary research to support
it. Keep in mind that the time allowed for the filing of such motions is normally quite
short. Most posttrial motions are denied but are still necessary to preserve issues for
appeal. The case then moves on to sentencing if the defendant was found guilty. Ex-
hibit 13–4 presents a motion for a new trial.

CONCLUSION
Therighttoafairtrial,trialbyjury,andtheassociateddueprocessrightstocounsel,pres-
ence, and confrontation are of such import as to be guaranteed by the Constitution of the
United States and every state constitution. Occasionally these trial rights conflict with
other paramount rights such as freedom of the press and the need for open and public
trials. The courts have resolved such conflicts by reasonable restrictions on speech, press,
and public access only when there seems to be no other reasonable alternative.
Trial consists of a sequence of steps governed by rules of procedure and evidence
that assign the burden of proof, provide order and efficiency, and enhance the trier of
fact’s access to reliable evidence.
An effective trial presentation requires extensive planning and preparation. You
can play a vital role, evaluating and organizing evidence, conducting jury research
and drafting potential voir dire questions, assisting witnesses, making or obtaining
demonstrative evidence, drafting questions to be asked at trial, drafting motions and
doing supporting research, compiling a trial notebook, and evaluating opening and
closing statements. At trial, your being well organized, exercising keen observation,
and taking copious notes not only can lead to a better presentation, but also can iso-
late matters for posttrial motions and appeal.

APPLICATION ASSIGNMENTS
1.
Assuming that assets that are the product of or used for criminal activity
may be seized by the government (as you will see in Chapter 14), is there a
denial of the right to counsel in the following factual situation? Also, assume
that property found to be the product of criminal activity may not be used to
retain counsel. See U.S. v. Unimex, Inc., 991 F.2d 546 (9th Cir. 1993).
Keyhole, Inc., a small company, publishes adult magazines. All of the
corporation’s assets are seized by the government in association with a
prosecution for distributing pornographic material. Keyhole goes to trial
without attorney because it has no available assets with which to hire an
attorney.
2.
Assume that a forensic expert is called to testify to the time of death of a
victim, the time when resuscitation was viable, that injuries were
consistent with gagging, and that the gagging was done to keep the victim
from calling for help. What, if any, part of this testimony seems the least
scientifically based? Should the expert be permitted to testify on that part?
See Schieber v. City of Philadelphia, 2000 WL 1670888 (E.D. Pa. 2000).
3.
If codefendants are being tried for bribery, is there anything wrong with
admitting into evidence a codefendant’s statement made before the grand
jury? See U.S. v. Flores, 985 F.2d 770 (5th Cir. 1993). Does Crawford v.
Washington apply?
4.
You be the judge and decide whether the following facts require you to
grant or deny a defendant’s request for a peremptory challenge.
A black defendant has excluded six white jurors. The prosecution
challenges the defendant’s strike of a seventh white juror. The defense
explains that its last strike was because the juror’s hair style and glasses
suggested he was a conservative. See U.S. v. Blotcher, 142 F.3d 728 (4th
Cir. 1998).
5.
Assume you are part of a prosecution team with a trial soon to start
involving several police officers who will testify for the state. Your boss,
the prosecutor, asks your advice on what types of jurors she should
exclude. What will you tell her?
6.
Your supervising attorney on the defense team for Eldon Spiers, Case I,
reminds you that Dr. Bernita Tucker, a specialist in head injuries, will be
testifying for the state in that case. The state will be using Dr. Tucker to
describe Kate Lamb’s injuries and to say that her death was due to the
head trauma caused by the fall onto the rocks below the Smiley Creek
bridge.

Trial: Rights, Procedure, Tasks
■511
Your attorney compliments you on your medical research showing that
such injuries very commonly cause confusion, lack of clarity in thought,
and short-term memory loss. The doctor alluded to this at the preliminary
hearing. You also have a copy of Kate Lamb’s medical records. Your
research is clear on this point and your attorney feels that cross-
examination of the doctor can help the client and, at the very worst, not
hurt the client. For those reasons, the attorney asks you to draft five to ten
questions for cross-examination of the doctor for the purpose of getting
testimony that can shed doubt on Kate Lamb’s statement that Eldon Spiers
is the perpetrator of the crime. Add any details to your questions that seem
necessary to fill out the cross-examination. Once that is done, switch sides
and draft redirect questions for the state that will help rehabilitate the
witness, that is, undo or limit any damage done by the cross-examination.

CHAPTER 14
I.
INTRODUCTION
A.
GOALS
The stage of sentencing and punishment brings us full circle from the reasoning that
forms the basis of the criminal justice system. Chapter 1 presented the concepts of ret-
ribution, deterrence, and rehabilitation as the purpose behind the effort to apprehend
suspected offenders and determine their innocence or guilt. We demand that con-
victed offenders “pay their debt to society” in retribution, act as a deterrent to keep
others from following their example and themselves from repeating their acts, or
change their ways so as to be rehabilitated to take a productive place in society. With-
out these goals, there would be no reason to make an arrest in the first place. After the
guilty plea or determination of guilt through trial, we come to the processes that carry
out the goals of the criminal justice system.
B.
SETTING AND SERVING THE SENTENCE
The sentence officially establishes the punishment to be meted out to the perpetrator
of a particular crime. Different forms of punishment apply retribution, deterrence,
and rehabilitation in differing degrees and are measured to fit the specific crime or
criminal. The range in sentencing is set by federal and state statute, and more nar-
rowly by federal and some state guidelines. In the federal system, judges always pro-
nounce sentence, which is also true in most state systems; in Arizona, Indiana,
Kentucky, and West Virginia juries recommend the sentence to be set by the judge; in
Arkansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas, and Virginia juries set the sentence. Juries are
particularly responsible for sentencing in death penalty cases.
Legislatures do not have the freedom to set sentences randomly. The Fifth and
Fourteenth amendments to the Constitution and similar state provisions prevent
punishments from being enacted without due process. Procedural irregularities must
be ironed out to eliminate unfair advantages or disadvantages.
The Eighth Amendment prohibition on “cruel and unusual punishment” also lim-
its sentencing, but its interpretation by the courts provides the needed flexibility that is
dictated by changing societal attitudes. The predominantly capital and corporal pun-
ishment that served as retribution gave way to the idea of reformation and the building
of penitentiaries during the late eighteenth-century Enlightenment. The prison system
begun in Auburn, N.Y., in 1817, where prisoners were isolated in cells at night but
worked together during the day, became a model for prisons in the rest of the nation.1
It was not until 1968, however, that corporal, or physical, punishment was officially
eliminated in the United States. In Jackson v. Bishop (8th Cir.), Arkansas’s use of whip-
ping, electric shock, and brutal work conditions to discipline inmates was declared un-
constitutionally cruel.2 The disciplinary practice of chaining prisoners to outdoor
“hitching posts” in Alabama prisons from 1995 to 1998 was declared cruel and unusual
punishment in Hope v. Pelzer (2002). Guards should have known that this practice was
unlawful; therefore, they were not protected by qualified immunity from prisoners’
suits. Now penitentiaries, the intended benign alternative to corporal punishment,
have been criticized as cruel. Overcrowding and lack of control frequently subject in-
mates to dangerous conditions. Capital punishment also continues to draw criticism.
A refinement of the “cruel and unusual” clause came with proportionality analy-
sis, an attempt to balance the severity of the punishment with the severity of the
crime, in the decision of Weems v. U.S. (1910). The sentence of fifteen years of hard la-
bor in leg irons was held to be cruelly disproportionate to the crime of falsifying a mi-
nor document by a public official. Standards for proportionality analysis were set by
Solem v. Helm (1983): (1) the gravity of the offense relative to the harshness of the
penalty, (2) the sentences imposed for other crimes in the jurisdiction, and (3) the sen-
tences imposed for the same crimes in other jurisdictions. These standards were fur-
ther interpreted in McGruder v. Puckett (5th Cir. 1992); a court must determine that the
proportionality:
the attempt to balance the
severity of the punishment
with the severity of the
crime.

■517
writ of certiorari:
an order by the appellate
court having discretion that it
will hear an appeal.
first standard was violated by a sentence grossly disproportionate to the offense be-
fore considering the remaining two standards of the Solem test.
For serious crimes, sentencing procedure involves a presentence report and al-
ternative sentencing plan leading to the hearing where the sentence is pronounced.
Paralegals have important tasks in this preparation stage.
The beginning of punishment is not the end of the story, however. Problems oc-
curring during the serving of the sentence may require continued intervention.
C.
REVIEW
Conceding that errors may occur at the trial level, the criminal justice system pro-
vides for several types and levels of review where corrections can be made: trial de
novo, appeal by right, discretionary review, habeas corpus relief, and nonjudicial
remedies.
Appeals are generally made “on the record,” which means that the reviewing
court does not reenact the trial, but reviews the record of the trial to see if errors exist.
The United States Constitution does not provide the right to appeal a criminal
conviction [McKane v. Durston (1894)], but federal and state statutes uniformly fill the
gap. They provide for an appeal by right to the appellate court immediately higher
than the trial court.
After the appeal by right, further appellate review is possible only at the discre-
tion of the higher court. The United States Supreme Court exercises such discretion
by granting a writ of certiorari to the lower court, ordering records of those cases it
chooses to review. A denial of certiorari allows the lower court’s decision to stand.
Beyond appeal, relief may be sought through a writ of habeas corpus. This an-
cient form of remedy is the last judicial resort for those looking for release from cus-
tody they consider to be unjust.
Nonjudicial relief is still available after all other avenues have come to dead ends.
An appeal to executive authority is grounded in the common law tradition of appeal
to the Crown for clemency. The United States Constitution, in Article 2, Section 1,
Clause 1, gives the president the “Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for offenses
against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.” Sentences may be com-
muted, fines remitted, and conditional or full pardons issued; the last restores civil
rights as if the crime had not been committed. Relief may be granted even before con-
viction, as demonstrated by President Ford’s pardon of former President Nixon for
offenses surrounding the Watergate scandal. State constitutions or statutes usually
limit this last appeal to the governor. A few states require the governor’s pardons to
be approved by a state pardons board, and some states allow pardons only by such a
board.3 Amnesty is the pardon offered to a group, such as that freeing Confederate
soldiers from prosecution after the Civil War.
Approaches to these processes differ from those for trial, so the postconviction
phase may be turned over to specialists in the field. If you work on a case from begin-
ning to end, you have the advantage of being able to carry over information from one
phase to the next. If you enter the case at the appeals level, your work begins with a re-
view of all that has gone before. In either event, meticulous attention to detail is vital;
the one overlooked bit of information may be the one necessary to convince the court.

appeals.4

officers, and prosecution and defense teams sensitive to the needs of both victims and
defendants are continuing to find new ways to satisfy the goals of retribution, deter-
rence, and rehabilitation.
B.
CAPITAL PUNISHMENT
Taking the life of one who causes harm to others is a solution that has a long tradition in
history and even religion. The Massachusetts Code of 1648 provided the death penalty
for idolatry, witchcraft, blasphemy, sodomy, adultery, and “man stealing,” as well as for
most felonies. Death provides a strong retribution and individual deterrence, but elim-
inates any attempt at rehabilitation. A New York Times survey indicates that the death
penalty is not a general deterrent to homicide. Ten of the twelve states not using execu-
tions are below the national average for homicide rates. In the past twenty years capital
punishmentstateshavehomiciderates48 percentto 101percent higherthanstateswith-
out it.5 States began abandoning capital punishment with mid–nineteenth-century re-
form movements. The 1960s also brought strong opposition, and there were no
executions in this country in the decade following 1967. Bolstering this restraint was the
ruling in Furman v. Georgia (1972) declaring Georgia’s death penalty unconstitutional.
The Furman Court did not consider the general question of the constitutionality
of the death penalty, but it invalidated the statute because it allowed the sentence to
be applied capriciously and with discrimination. There were no standards setting
apart the cases whose circumstances mandated the death penalty from those that did
not, leaving that to the discretion of judge or jury. Because the death penalty was in-
voked infrequently, its imposition was judged likely to be so uneven as to be “cruel

Sentencing, Punishment, and Review
■519
and unusual.” The defendants in the three cases considered, one murderer and two
rapists, were African Americans with white victims.
Georgia responded to the Furman decision with a new capital punishment statute
subsequently upheld in Gregg v. Georgia (1976). A total of thirty-eight states passed
capital punishment statutes that enumerate aggravating and mitigating circum-
stances to be considered by the jury in the penalty phase of a bifurcated trial, after the
defendant has been convicted. Federal mitigating and aggravating circumstances are
listed in 18 U.S.C.A. § 3592. An automatic appeal to the state supreme court is an ad-
ditional safeguard.
Lockett v. Ohio (1978) specified that “as a mitigating factor, any aspect of the de-
fendant’s character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the de-
fendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death,” must be allowed for
consideration. Aggravating circumstances such as “utter disregard for human life”
have been ruled unconstitutionally vague unless more narrowly interpreted by the
courts [Arave v. Creech (1993)]. In Arave, the Idaho Supreme Court narrowed the
phrase with the construction “cold-blooded, pitiless slayer” to set apart defendants
worthy of the death penalty from defendants who show feeling.
Studies have shown that jurors often misunderstand instructions on aggravating
and mitigating circumstances and when a life sentence means without parole, and
they underestimate time served before a parole might begin. Therefore, they are more
likely to choose a death sentence.6 South Carolina law requires that when a jury finds
at least one aggravating circumstance, it must return a sentence of either death or life
in prison. In Shafer v. South Carolina (2001), the Supreme Court ruled that when a cap-
ital defendant’s future dangerousness is at issue, juries must be notified that as an al-
ternative to the death penalty, a life sentence does not include eligibility for parole. In
Penry v. Johnson (2001), mitigating evidence showing the defendant was mentally re-
tarded and a victim of child abuse was presented to the jury at the sentencing phase
of his trial, and the judge verbally asked the jury to consider mitigating circum-
stances, but the jury form only allowed for yes or no responses to three special issues
necessary for the death penalty. Since the form did not provide “a vehicle for ex-
pressing a view that Penry did not deserve to be sentenced to death based upon his
mitigating evidence,” the sentence was overturned, and the case was remanded.
The new statutes make imposition of the death penalty somewhat more pre-
dictable, but of course do not eliminate all discrimination. Moreover, when discrimi-
nation is claimed, it must be shown to be against the individual defendant, and not a
general group to which the defendant belongs. Statistical studies showing that the
death penalty is more common when defendants are African American and less com-
mon when victims are African American were rejected in McCleskey v. Kemp (1987).
Kentucky is unique among the states in responding to McClesky with a law allowing
a claim of discrimination to be raised at the pretrial conference when the prosecution
seeks the death penalty (KRS 532.300). At a hearing on the claim, the defendant has
the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence, including statistical evi-
dence, that race was the basis of the decision to seek the death penalty. If that burden
is met, the death penalty is barred.
Several decisions have had an impact on incompetent defendants facing execu-
tion. Ford v. Wainwright (1986) ruled that a defendant whose mental illness began af-
ter conviction could not be executed if he could not comprehend the reasons or
implications of the sentence. State v. Perry (La. 1992) ruled that the forced medication
of an incompetent death row prisoner with antipsychotic drugs in order to carry out
his death sentence would violate the state constitutional right to privacy, as well as the
prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. Atkins v. Virginia (2002) barred ex-
ecution of the mentally retarded, but left to the states the determination of who can be
considered retarded. Some states require a showing that the person was considered
retarded before the age of 18 or 22; some set the IQ line at 70, and others at 65.
Since the Stanford v. Kentucky (1989) ruling that upheld executions for those
between ages 16 and 18, the Supreme Court found that a national consensus had
“Gentlemen of the jury, the
charge against the prisoner
is murder, and the punish-

developed against such capital punishment for juveniles. The Court reversed Stan-
ford in Roper v. Simmons (2005), declaring that the Eighth and Fourteenth Amend-
ments bar as “cruel and unusual” the execution of anyone who was under the age
of 18 at the time of the crime.
Only Nebraska uses the electric chair exclusively for executions. All other death
penalty states use lethal injection, with alternatives of electric chair in ten states, gas
chamber in five states, hanging in two states, and firing squad in two states. Lethal in-
jection has been challenged, however, in several cases.7
The death penalty itself is under review. A study of capital cases from 1973 to
1995 found that reversible error occurred in 68 percent of those cases because of in-
competent defense, primarily failure to present evidence of innocence or mitigating
factors; suppression of evidence by police or prosecution; faulty jury instructions;
and biased judges and juries.8 By 2004, 115 people condemned to death in twenty-five
states were exonerated on evidence of innocence based on DNA testing, incompetent
defense counsel at trial, and use of unreliable jailhouse informants. In January 2003,
three years after declaring a moratorium on executions, the governor of Illinois
granted pardons and clemency to the entire population of death row in that state,
“because the Illinois death penalty system is arbitrary and capricious—and therefore
immoral. . . .”9
In 2003 the ABAcompiled guidelines to improve death penalty representation for
both state and federal handling of cases from arrest through clemency hearings. The
guidelines call for an independent authority to appoint and monitor defense attor-
neys, minimum requirements for defense team personnel and their skills and contin-
uing education, specific duties for each stage of the proceedings, and reasonable
compensation levels and workloads. Those guidelines are controversial and would be
expensive to implement, and no state has yet adopted them.10
Federal capital punishment statutes include espionage (18 U.S.C.A. § 794), trea-
son (18 U.S.C.A. § 2381), terrorism (18 U.S.C.A. § 2332), air piracy with loss of life (49
U.S.C.A. § 1472), and the “drug kingpin” statute (21 U.S.C.A. § 848), which covers
loss of life in connection with a continuing criminal enterprise. In Coker v. Georgia
(1977), the Supreme Court ruled that the death penalty may not be imposed for rape
of an adult. As of 1997 thirteen states allow the death penalty for nonlethal crimes,
however, including treason, espionage, drug trafficking, and rape of a child [State v.
Wilson (La. 1996) and State v. Kennedy (La. 2001)].11

Judgment of the Court, and opinion of MR. JUSTICE
STEWART, MR. JUSTICE POWELL, and MR. JUSTICE
STEVENS, announced by MR. JUSTICE STEWART.
The issue in this case is whether the imposition of the sen-
tence of death for the crime of murder under the law of
Georgia violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.
I.
The petitioner, Troy Gregg, was charged with committing
armed robbery and murder. In accordance with Georgia
procedure in capital cases, the trial was in two stages, a
guilt stage and a sentencing stage. The evidence at the
guilt trial established that on November 21, 1973, the pe-
titioner and a traveling companion, Floyd Allen, while
hitchhiking north in Florida were picked up by Fred Sim-
mons and Bob Moore. Their car broke down, but they con-
tinued north after Simmons purchased another vehicle
with some of the cash he was carrying. While still in
Florida, they picked up another hitchhiker, Dennis Weaver,
who rode with them to Atlanta, where he was let out about
11 p.m. A short time later the four men interrupted their

■521
journey for a rest stop along the highway. The next morn-
ing the bodies of Simmons and Moore were discovered in
a ditch nearby.
On November 23, after reading about the shootings in an
Atlanta newspaper, Weaver communicated with the Gwin-
nett County police and related information concerning the
journey with the victims, including a description of the car.
The next afternoon, the petitioner and Allen, while in Sim-
mons’ car, were arrested in Asheville, N.C. In the search in-
cident to the arrest a .25-caliber pistol, later shown to be that
used to kill Simmons and Moore, was found in the peti-
tioner’s pocket. After receiving the warnings required by Mi-
randa v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), and signing a written
waiver of his rights, the petitioner signed a statement in
which he admitted shooting, then robbing Simmons and
Moore. He justified the slayings on grounds of self-defense.
The next day, while being transferred to Lawrenceville, Ga.,
the petitioner and Allen were taken to the scene of the shoot-
ings. Upon arriving there, Allen recounted the events lead-
ing to the slayings. His version of these events was as
follows: After Simmons and Moore left the car, the petitioner
stated that he intended to rob them.The petitioner then took
his pistol in hand and positioned himself on the car to im-
prove his aim. As Simmons and Moore came up an em-
bankment toward the car, the petitioner fired three shots and
the two men fell near a ditch. The petitioner, at close range,
then fired a shot into the head of each. He robbed them of
valuables and drove away with Allen.
A medical examiner testified that Simmons died from a
bullet wound in the eye and that Moore died from bullet
wounds in the cheek and in the back of the head. He further
testified that both men had several bruises and abrasions
about the face and head which probably were sustained ei-
ther from the fall into the ditch or from being dragged or
pushed along the embankment. Although Allen did not tes-
tify, a police detective recounted the substance of Allen’s
statements about the slayings and indicated that directly af-
ter Allen had made these statements the petitioner had ad-
mitted that Allen’s account was accurate. The petitioner
testified in his own defense. He confirmed that Allen had
made the statements described by the detective, but denied
their truth or ever having admitted to their accuracy. He indi-
cated that he had shot Simmons and Moore because of fear
and in self-defense, testifying they had attacked Allen and
him, one wielding a pipe and the other a knife.1
The trial judge submitted the murder charges to the jury
on both felony-murder and nonfelony-murder theories. He
also instructed on the issue of self-defense but declined to
instruct on manslaughter. He submitted the robbery case to
the jury on both an armed-robbery theory and on the lesser
included offense of robbery by intimidation. The jury found
the petitioner guilty of two counts of armed robbery and two
counts of murder.
At the penalty stage, which took place before the same
jury, neither the prosecutor nor the petitioner’s lawyer of-
fered any additional evidence. Both counsel, however, made
lengthy arguments dealing generally with the propriety of
capital punishment under the circumstances and with the
weight of the evidence of guilt.The trial judge instructed the
jury that it could recommend either a death sentence or a life
prison sentence on each count. The judge further charged
the jury that in determining what sentence was appropriate
the jury was free to consider the facts and circumstances, if
any, presented by the parties in mitigation or aggravation.
Finally, the judge instructed the jury that it “would not be
authorized to consider [imposing] the penalty of death” un-
less it first found beyond a reasonable doubt one of these
aggravating circumstances:
“One—That the offense of murder was committed while
the offender was engaged in the commission of two other
capital felonies, to-wit the armed robbery of [Simmons
and Moore].
“Two—That the offender committed the offense of mur-
der for the purpose of receiving money and the automo-
bile described in the indictment.
“Three—The offense of murder was outrageously and
wantonly vile, horrible and inhuman, in that they [sic]
involved the depravity of [the] mind of the defendant.”
Tr. 476–477.
Finding the first and second of these circumstances, the jury
returned verdicts of death on each count.
The Supreme Court of Georgia affirmed the convictions
and the imposition of the death sentences for murder. After
reviewing the trial transcript and the record, including the ev-
idence, and comparing the evidence and sentence in simi-
lar cases in accordance with the requirements of Georgia
law, the court concluded that, considering the nature of the
crime and the defendant, the sentences of death had not re-
sulted from prejudice or any other arbitrary factor and were
not excessive or disproportionate to the penalty applied in
similar cases.The death sentences imposed for armed rob-
bery, however, were vacated on the grounds that the death
penalty had rarely been imposed in Georgia for that offense
and that the jury improperly considered the murders as ag-
gravating circumstances for the robberies after having con-
sidered the armed robberies as aggravating circumstances
for the murders.
We granted the petitioner’s application for a writ of cer-
tiorari limited to his challenge to the imposition of the death
sentences in this case as “cruel and unusual” punishment in
violation of the Eighth and the Fourteenth Amendments.
II.
. . . After a verdict, finding, or plea of guilty to a capital crime,
a presentence hearing is conducted before whoever made the

the petitioner to Allen entitled, “[a] statement for you,” with the in-
structions that Allen memorize and then burn it.The statement was
consistent with the petitioner’s testimony at trial.

CHAPTER 14
determination of guilt.The sentencing procedures are essen-
tially the same in both bench and jury trials. At the hearing:
“[T]he judge [or jury] shall hear additional evidence in ex-
tenuation, mitigation, and aggravation of punishment, in-
cluding the record of any prior criminal convictions and
pleas of guilty or pleas of nolo contendere of the defen-
dant, or the absence of any prior conviction and pleas:
Provided, however, that only such evidence in aggrava-
tion as the State has made known to the defendant prior
to his trial shall be admissible. The judge [or jury] shall
also hear argument by the defendant or his counsel and
the prosecuting attorney . . . regarding the punishment to
be imposed.” § 27–2503 (Supp. 1975).
The defendant is accorded substantial latitude as to the
types of evidence that he may introduce. Evidence consid-
ered during the guilt stage may be considered during the
sentencing stage without being resubmitted.
In the assessment of the appropriate sentence to be im-
posed the judge is also required to consider or to include in
his instructions to the jury “any mitigating circumstances or
aggravating circumstances otherwise authorized by law and
any of [10] statutory aggravating circumstances which may
be supported by the evidence. . . .” § 27–2534.1(b) (Supp.
1975). The scope of the nonstatutory aggravating or miti-
gating circumstances is not delineated in the statute. Before
a convicted defendant may be sentenced to death, however,
except in cases of treason or aircraft hijacking, the jury, or
the trial judge in cases tried without a jury, must find beyond
a reasonable doubt one of the 10 aggravating circum-
stances specified in the statute.9 The sentence of death may
be imposed only if the jury (or judge) finds one of the statu-
tory aggravating circumstances and then elects to impose
that sentence. § 26–3102 (Supp. 1975). If the verdict is
death, the jury or judge must specify the aggravating cir-
cumstance(s) found. § 27–2534.1(c) (Supp. 1975). In jury
cases, the trial judge is bound by the jury’s recommended
sentence. §§ 26–3102, 27–2514 (Supp. 1975).
In addition to the conventional appellate process avail-
able in all criminal cases, provision is made for special ex-
pedited direct review by the Supreme Court of Georgia of
the appropriateness of imposing the sentence of death in
the particular case. The court is directed to consider “the
punishment as well as any errors enumerated by way of ap-
peal,” and to determine:
“(1) Whether the sentence of death was imposed under
the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary
factor, and
“(2) Whether, in cases other than treason or aircraft
hijacking, the evidence supports the jury’s or judge’s find-
ing of a statutory aggravating circumstance as enumer-
ated in section 27.2534.1(b), and
9. The statute provides in part:
“(a) The death penalty may be imposed for the offenses of aircraft
hijacking or treason, in any case.
“(b) In all cases of other offenses for which the death penalty may
be authorized, the judge shall consider, or he shall include in his in-
structions to the jury for it to consider, any mitigating circumstances
or aggravating circumstances otherwise authorized by law and any
of the following statutory aggravating circumstances which may be
supported by the evidence:
“(1) The offense of murder, rape, armed robbery, or kidnapping was
committed by a person with a prior record of conviction for a capi-
tal felony, or the offense of murder was committed by a person who
has a substantial history of serious assaultive criminal convictions.
“(2) The offense of murder, rape, armed robbery, or kidnapping was
committed while the offender was engaged in the commission of
another capital felony, or aggravated battery, or the offense of mur-
der was committed while the offender was engaged in the commis-
sion of burglary or arson in the first degree.
“(3) The offender by his act of murder, armed robbery, or kidnapping
knowingly created a great risk of death to more than one person in
a public place by means of a weapon or device which would nor-
mally be hazardous to the lives of more than one person.
“(4) The offender committed the offense of murder for himself or an-
other, for the purpose of receiving money or any other thing of mon-
etary value.
“(5) The murder of a judicial officer, former judicial officer, district at-
torney or solicitor or former district attorney or solicitor during or be-
cause of the exercise of his official duty.
“(6) The offender caused or directed another to commit murder or
committed murder as an agent or employee of another person.
“(7) The offense of murder, rape, armed robbery, or kidnapping was
outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman in that it involved
torture, depravity of mind, or an aggravated battery to the victim.
“(8) The offense of murder was committed against any peace offi-
cer, corrections employee or fireman while engaged in the per-
formance of his official duties.
“(9) The offense of murder was committed by a person in, or who
has escaped from, the lawful custody of a peace officer or place of
lawful confinement.
“(10) The murder was committed for the purpose of avoiding, inter-
fering with, or preventing a lawful arrest or custody in a place of law-
ful confinement, of himself or another.
“(c) The statutory instructions as determined by the trial judge to be
warranted by the evidence shall be given in charge and in writing to
the jury for its deliberation. The jury, if its verdict be a recommen-
dation of death, shall designate in writing, signed by the foreman of
the jury, the aggravating circumstance or circumstances which it
found beyond a reasonable doubt. In non-jury cases the judge shall
make such designation. Except in cases of treason or aircraft hi-
jacking, unless at least one of the statutory aggravating circum-
stances enumerated in section 27–2534.1(b) is so found, the death
penalty shall not be imposed.” § 27–2534.1 (Supp. 1975).
The Supreme Court of Georgia, in Arnold v. State, 236 Ga. 534,
540, 224 S.E.2d 386, 391 (1976), recently held unconstitutional the
portion of the first circumstance encompassing persons who have
a “substantial history of serious assaultive criminal convictions” be-
cause it did not set “sufficiently ‘clear and objective standards.’ ”

Sentencing, Punishment, and Review
■523
“(3) Whether the sentence of death is excessive or dis-
proportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases,
considering both the crime and the defendant.”
§ 27–2537 (Supp. 1975).
If the court affirms a death sentence, it is required to include
in its decision reference to similar cases that it has taken
into consideration. § 27–2537(e) (Supp. 1975).
A transcript and complete record of the trial, as well as a
separate report by the trial judge, are transmitted to the court
for its use in reviewing the sentence. § 27–2537(a) (Supp.
1975).The report is in the form of a 6 1/2-page questionnaire,
designed to elicit information about the defendant, the crime,
and the circumstances of the trial. It requires the trial judge to
characterize the trial in several ways designed to test for arbi-
trariness and disproportionality of sentence. Included in the
report are responses to detailed questions concerning the
quality of the defendant’s representation, whether race played
a role in the trial, and, whether, in the trial court’s judgment,
there was any doubt about the defendant’s guilt or the appro-
priateness of the sentence.A copy of the report is served upon
defense counsel. Under its special review authority, the court
may either affirm the death sentence or remand the case for
resentencing.In cases in which the death sentence is affirmed
there remains the possibility of executive clemency.
III.
We address initially the basic contention that the punish-
ment of death for the crime of murder is, under all circum-
stances, “cruel and unusual” in violation of the Eighth and
Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution. . . .
A.
. . . When a form of punishment in the abstract (in this case,
whether capital punishment may ever be imposed as a
sanction for murder) rather than in the particular (the pro-
priety of death as a penalty to be applied to a specific de-
fendant for a specific crime) is under consideration, the
inquiry into “excessiveness” has two aspects. First, the pun-
ishment must not involve the unnecessary and wanton in-
fliction of pain. Second, the punishment must not be grossly
out of proportion to the severity of the crime.
B.
Of course, the requirements of the Eighth Amendment must
be applied with an awareness of the limited role to be played
by the courts. . . .
. . . Therefore, in assessing a punishment selected by a
democratically elected legislature against the constitutional
measure, we presume its validity. . . .
C.
In the discussion to this point we have sought to identify the
principles and considerations that guide a court in address-
ing an Eighth Amendment claim. We now consider specifi-
cally whether the sentence of death for the crime of murder is
a per se violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments
to the Constitution. We note first that history and precedent
strongly support a negative answer to this question.
. . .
It is apparent from the text of the Constitution itself that
the existence of capital punishment was accepted by the
Framers. . . .
Despite the continuing debate, dating back to the 19th
century, over the morality and utility of capital punishment, it
is now evident that a large proportion of American society
continues to regard it as an appropriate and necessary
criminal sanction.
As we have seen, however, the Eighth Amendment de-
mands more than that a challenged punishment be accept-
able to contemporary society. The Court also must ask
whether it comports with the basic concept of human dignity
at the core of the Amendment. Although we cannot “invali-
date a category of penalties because we deem less severe
penalties adequate to serve the ends of penology,” the sanc-
tion imposed cannot be so totally without penological justifi-
cation that it results in the gratuitous infliction of suffering.
The death penalty is said to serve two principal social
purposes: retribution and deterrence of capital crimes by
prospective offenders.
In part, capital punishment is an expression of society’s
moral outrage at particularly offensive conduct. This func-
tion may be unappealing to many, but it is essential in an or-
dered society that asks its citizens to rely on legal processes
rather than self-help to vindicate their wrongs. . . .
Statistical attempts to evaluate the worth of the death
penalty as a deterrent to crimes by potential offenders have
occasioned a great deal of debate. The results simply have
been inconclusive. . . .
In sum, we cannot say that the judgment of the Georgia
Legislature that capital punishment may be necessary in
some cases is clearly wrong. Considerations of federalism,
as well as respect for the ability of a legislature to evaluate, in
terms of its particular State, the moral consensus concerning
the death penalty and its social utility as a sanction, require
us to conclude, in the absence of more convincing evidence,
that the infliction of death as a punishment for murder is not
without justification and thus is not unconstitutionally severe.
Finally, we must consider whether the punishment of
death is disproportionate in relation to the crime for which it
is imposed. . . . [W]hen a life has been taken deliberately by
the offender, we cannot say that the punishment is invariably
disproportionate to the crime. It is an extreme sanction, suit-
able to the most extreme of crimes.
. . .
IV.
We now consider whether Georgia may impose the death
penalty on the petitioner in this case.

524
■
CHAPTER 14
. . .
[C]oncerns expressed in Furman that the penalty of
death not be imposed in an arbitrary or capricious manner
can be met by a carefully drafted statute that ensures that
the sentencing authority is given adequate information and
guidance. As a general proposition these concerns are best
met by a system that provides for a bifurcated proceeding at
which the sentencing authority is apprised of the information
relevant to the imposition of sentence and provided with
standards to guide its use of the information.
We do not intend to suggest that only the above-de-
scribed procedures would be permissible under Furman or
that any sentencing system constructed along these gen-
eral lines would inevitably satisfy the concerns of Furman,
for each distinct system must be examined on an individual
basis. Rather, we have embarked upon this general exposi-
tion to make clear that it is possible to construct capital-sen-
tencing systems capable of meeting Furman’s constitutional
concerns.
B.
We now turn to consideration of the constitutionality of
Georgia’s capital-sentencing procedures. . . .
Georgia’s new sentencing procedures require as a pre-
requisite to the imposition of the death penalty, specific jury
findings as to the circumstances of the crime or the charac-
ter of the defendant. Moreover, to guard further against a sit-
uation comparable to that presented in Furman, the
Supreme Court of Georgia compares each death sentence
with the sentences imposed on similarly situated defen-
dants to ensure that the sentence of death in a particular
case is not disproportionate. On their face these procedures
seem to satisfy the concerns of Furman. . . .
V.
The basic concern of Furman centered on those defen-
dants who were being condemned to death capriciously
and arbitrarily. Under the procedures before the Court in
that case, sentencing authorities were not directed to give
attention to the nature or circumstances of the crime com-
mitted or to the character or record of the defendant. Left
unguided, juries imposed the death sentence in a way that
could only be called freakish. The new Georgia sentenc-
ing procedures, by contrast, focus the jury’s attention on
the particularized nature of the crime and the particular-
ized characteristics of the individual defendant. While the
jury is permitted to consider any aggravating or mitigating
circumstances, it must find and identify at least one statu-
tory aggravating factor before it may impose a penalty of
death. In this way the jury’s discretion is channeled. No
longer can a jury wantonly and freakishly impose the
death sentence; it is always circumscribed by the legisla-
tive guidelines. In addition, the review function of the
Supreme Court of Georgia affords additional assurance
that the concerns that prompted our decision in Furman
are not present to any significant degree in the Georgia
procedure applied here.
For the reasons expressed in this opinion, we hold that
the statutory system under which Gregg was sentenced to
death does not violate the Constitution. Accordingly, the
judgment of the Georgia Supreme Court is affirmed.
It is so ordered.
MR.JUSTICE WHITE, with whomTHE CHIEF JUSTICE and
MR.JUSTICE REHNQUIST join, concurring in the judgment.
. . .
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, dissenting.
. . .
MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, dissenting.
. . .
The two purposes that sustain the death penalty as
nonexcessive in the Court’s view are general deterrence
and retribution. In Furman, I canvassed the relevant data on
the deterrent effect of capital punishment. The state of
knowledge at that point, after literally centuries of debate,
was summarized as follows by a United Nations Committee:
“It is generally agreed between the retentionists and abo-
litionists, whatever their opinions about the validity of
comparative studies of deterrence, that the data which
now exist show no correlation between the existence of
capital punishment and lower rates of capital crime.”
The available evidence, I concluded in Furman, was con-
vincing that “capital punishment is not necessary as a de-
terrent to crime in our society.”
. . .
There remains for consideration, however, what might be
termed the purely retributive justification for the death
penalty—that the death penalty is appropriate, not because
of its beneficial effect on society, but because the taking of
the murderer’s life is itself morally good. . . .
Of course, it may be that these statements are intended
as no more than observations as to the popular demands
that it is thought must be responded to in order to prevent
anarchy. But the implication of the statements appears to
me to be quite different—namely, that society’s judgment
that the murderer “deserves” death must be respected not
simply because the preservation of order requires it, but be-
cause it is appropriate that society make the judgment and
carry it out. It is this latter notion, in particular, that I consider
to be fundamentally at odds with the Eighth Amend-
ment. . . . Under these standards, the taking of life “because
the wrongdoer deserves it” surely must fall, for such a pun-
ishment has as its very basis the total denial of the wrong-
doer’s dignity and worth.

INCARCERATION
At one time prisons seemed the perfect solution to crime. Ideally, they provide retri-
bution, deterrence, and rehabilitation in one sentence. By shutting violent offenders
away from the rest of society, they represent safety and security for our population.
By placing the offender in a controlled environment, they can rehabilitate that person
to productive life.
Prisons, however, can be training grounds for criminals. Inmates are hardened by
brutal conditions and have access to a network of expertise in crime that offers more
likelihood of “success” than rehabilitation programs. These “schools for crime” cost
more to house an inmate for a year than it would cost to send that person to college.
Annual cost of incarceration in Bureau of Prisons facilities is $23,183, incarceration in
community corrections centers is $19,087, and probation is $3,506.12
The United States has one of the highest per capita imprisonment rates in the
world. One out of every eleven prisoners is serving a life sentence, up 83 percent in
the last ten years, because of mandatory sentencing, three strikes laws, and more lim-
ited use of parole and commutation.13 See Exhibits 14–2 and 14–3 for statistics on the
growth of prison populations.
Sentences may be imposed in different ways.
1.
A prison sentence may be pronounced then suspended, placing the
defendant on probation—a conditional, supervised release.
2.
Separate sentences must be imposed for each crime; in the case of multiple
crimes, sentences may be consecutive—one after the other—or
concurrent—to be served at the same time.
3.
Indeterminate sentencing allows flexible prison terms responding to the
defendant’s progress toward rehabilitation. This approach led to
disproportionality and is now largely abandoned.
4.
Indefinite sentences set a maximum and minimum amount of time to be
served, allowing for early release on parole if behavior goals have been
reached in the minimum time. Many states use indefinite sentencing.

Definite or determinate sentences are fixed terms chosen from the range
allowed by statute and guidelines. There is no parole. The federal system
and a few states use definite sentencing.
6.
Mandatory sentences are statutory minimum prison terms with no chance
for either probation or parole.
7.
Enhancements are automatic additions to the basic sentence for certain
circumstances making the crime or the criminal more dangerous to society.
Increases had been common for habitual offenders responsible for
repeated felonies, for use of a firearm in the commission of the crime, and
for committing the offense because of the victim’s status.
Then the Supreme Court in Apprendi v. New Jersey (2000) ruled that the
only factor that a judge can use in the sentencing phase to increase the
penalty beyond the statutory maximum is the fact of a prior conviction.
Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment due process rights and Sixth
Amendment rights to notice and jury trial require that other penalty
enhancement facts are treated as elements of the crime, not sentencing
factors. Therefore, hate crime and firearm enhancements must be
submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.
D.
FINES
Fines are the most common sentences in misdemeanor cases. They have reached the
level of millions of dollars in banking and securities crimes as well as drug trafficking of-
fenses. Fines seem particularly suited to defendants who have made large amounts of
money through illegal practices and corporations that cannot serve prison sentences.
Fines may be added to prison terms for more serious crimes, or may be an alter-
native to incarceration for those who can afford it. At least 25 percent of felons sen-
tenced to prison or jail are also ordered to pay fines.14 Like prison terms, maximum
and minimum amounts are set by statute. Some statutes base fines on the amount
gained by committing the offense.

RESTITUTION
As fines are a payback to society, restitution is a payment to the individual victim of
the crime, a return of the value that was wrongfully taken. Federal judges can order
restitution as a condition of probation or supervised release [18 U.S.C.A. §§ 3563(b)(2)
and 3583(d)]. Restitution to repay property crime values, compensate for physical in-
juries, and pay the state for public harm as part of the sentence itself can be ordered at
the discretion of the judge (18 U.S.C.A. § 3663), but is mandatory for a broad range of
crimes including crimes of violence, controlled substances offenses, and fraud, unless
it is impracticable or places a burden on the sentencing process (18 U.S.C.A. § 3663A).
Federal restitution procedure is covered in 18 U.S.C.A. § 3664. All states allow courts to
order restitution, and one-third require it unless there are compelling reasons not to.15
Critics point out that victims are not likely to be repaid by defendants who are in
prison and not able to maintain employment, making restitution “one of the grand il-
lusions in both sentencing reform and victim’s rights. . . .”16 Some states, recognizing
the inability of many defendants to pay restitution, have established victim compen-
sation funds to provide for victims’ needs.
A man convicted of arson and fraud died before he could pay restitution to the
defrauded insurance company. His estate was ordered to make the payment, because
it was compensatory rather than penal and, therefore, survived the convict’s death
[U.S. v. Parsons (5th Cir. 2004)]. Restitution for pain and suffering of the victim may
not be included in the sentence nor can restitution require the payment of the of-
fender’s entire prison income [Southall v. U.S. (D.C. 1998)].
F.
FORFEITURE
Beyond the payment of fines and restitution, property used in crime or acquired as a
result of crime, can be forfeited as part of a criminal sentence or through civil pro-
ceedings, even if no criminal charges are filed. Awarrant based on probable cause that
the property was purchased with profits of crime or was used in committing a crime
is necessary for the government to seize it. This method is increasingly popular as a
way to ensure that crime does not pay. A Wisconsin law requires forfeiture of all ve-
hicles transporting property used in the commission of a felony, even if that vehicle
was not used in the crime itself. By transferring a crowbar used in a burglary from the
car used in the crime to another car, the defendant subjected the second car to forfei-
ture [State v. One 1971 Oldsmobile Cutlass Auto (Wis. App. 1990)].
Federal forfeiture laws (18 U.S.C.A. §§ 981–986) include a provision of the PA-
TRIOT Act making all assets derived from or involved in terrorism subject to forfei-
ture. Forfeiture of property involved in racketeering is provided for in 18 U.S.C.A.
§ 1963. Empires built by drug lords became subject to forfeiture with the Comprehen-
sive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, 21 U.S.C.A. § 881. All property
acquired with drug money, as well as the premises on which transactions took place,
can be seized. Drug activity on a shopping center parking lot caused forfeiture of the
entire center in U.S. v. Sonny Mitchell Center (5th Cir. 1991). The more recent decision
in Austin v. U.S. (1993) ruled that forfeitures are subject to the Eighth Amendment re-
striction on excessive fines and should be limited. Forfeiture of $357,000 that a defen-
dant tried to take out of the country was ruled grossly disproportional to the crime of
not properly registering the money [U.S. v. Bajakajian (1998)]. A forfeiture of $15,000
was affirmed. The Court in U.S. v. Ursery (1996) ruled that for a double jeopardy chal-
lenge to civil forfeiture, a defendant must show legislative intent that the forfeiture is
a criminal penalty and not a civil sanction, or that it is so punitive in fact that it can-
not be regarded as a civil sanction.
Federal and many state laws include provisions that the innocent owner of prop-
erty may defend against a forfeiture. If property is jointly held, the innocent party
must be compensated for his or her interest in the property. A Michigan law that held
no such defense allowed the forfeiture of a car owned by both husband and wife,
restitution:
a payment to the individual
victim of the crime, a return
of the value that was wrong-
fully taken.

bilitation—do you believe are best served by each type of penalty listed in
this section?
when the husband used the car for a tryst with a prostitute [Bennis v. Michigan (1996)].
Some states do not allow the forfeiture of a homestead, even if it has been illegally
used; in other states, criminal laws prevail over homestead laws, allowing for forfei-
ture. Be sure to consult the laws and decisions in your jurisdiction on whether an in-
nocent owner or homestead defense is a possibility.
G.
PROBATION
Nondangerous criminals may receive a sentence of probation, conditional release un-
der the supervision of a probation officer who works within the corrections system.
Probation may be combined with other forms of punishment, such as a brief impris-
onment, fines, or restitution, but generally may not exceed the maximum prison term
for the offense. Shock probation, used in some states, may be granted upon motion of
the defendant at the discretion of the sentencing judge. This is a release after a short
time of the sentence has been served, usually between one and six months, designed
to combine the shock of prison with the relief of a second chance to encourage the
prisoner to become a law-abiding citizen.
The trial judge imposes the conditions for probation, often on recommendation
of the probation officer. Common conditions include avoiding further illegal activity,
staying away from certain people or places, maintaining or seeking employment, re-
maining in the area, and so forth. The court has considerable latitude in establishing
these conditions, and may even curtail certain constitutional rights of the defendant.
Mandatory and discretionary conditions for federal probation are listed in 18
U.S.C.A. § 3563.
Warrantless searches of the defendant’s person, vehicle, and residence for con-
trolled substances were allowed by People v. Hellenthal (Mich. App. 1990), but other
courts considered such conditions overbroad. Conditions have other limits, too. Pro-
bation could not be revoked for a defendant who refused to enroll in a sexual therapy
program, because such participation would amount to an admission of guilt to the
sexual assault for which he was convicted [State v. Imlay (Mont. 1991)]. Another de-
fendant whose probation conditions included admitting guilt as a part of rehabilita-
tion, however, was not successful in getting that condition set aside [Warren v.
Richland County Circuit Court (7th Cir. 2000)]. Courts in several states have offered
contraception as a condition of probation for offenders who fail to pay child support
[Wisconsin v. Oakley (Wis. 2001)].
House arrest is a type of probation condition used for those needing stronger con-
trols than the occasional visit with the probation officer. Extensive surveillance or
electronic shackles that send radio signals identifying the wearer’s location are used
to verify that the probationer is remaining within set boundaries. House arrestees and
those lodged in halfway houses often may leave the premises to go to work or carry
out other conditions of probation.
Community service is seen as a sort of restitution to society. As a condition for
probation, it sometimes is linked to the offense. A vehicular homicide defendant may
be required to speak to youth groups about the dangers of drinking and driving; a
vandal may be required to clean up a city park.

III.
SENTENCING STATUTES AND GUIDELINES
A.
SENTENCING STATUTES
Most state codes rank crimes by class for sentencing. A class C felony such as second
degree burglary or first degree forgery, for example, may subject a convicted defen-
dant to five to ten years of prison and a fine of $1,000 to $10,000. A class B misde-
meanor such as false swearing or unlawful practice of law may carry a sentencing
range of up to ninety days in jail and up to a $250 fine. By setting a range rather than
a single term for every crime in that class, the statutes allow for factors surrounding
the crime, such as aggravating and mitigating circumstances, to be considered. The
presumptive sentence is the midway point of the sentencing range; two years would
be the presumptive sentence in a one to three year range, for example. The judge must
sentence within the range, and must account for deviation from the presumptive sen-
tence by explaining for the record the mitigating or aggravating factors that affected
the decision. Most sentencing statutes are indefinite, allowing for early release from
prison after a portion of the sentence has been served with good behavior, or for pro-
bation rather than incarceration.
The advantage of statutory ranges in sentencing is the flexibility afforded judges
to tailor the punishment to the individual defendant and criminal conduct. The dis-
advantage is that the same flexibility allows two defendants convicted of the same
class of offense to be given very different punishments, depending on the sympathies
of their sentencers.
B.
THREE STRIKES LAWS AND MANDATORY MINIMUMS
Federal law, 18 U.S.C.A. § 3559(c), provides for mandatory life imprisonment for a se-
rious violent felony that follows two prior convictions for violent felonies, or convic-
tions for one serious violent felony and one serious drug offense. The court in U.S. v.
Gatewood (6th Cir. 2000), certiorari denied (2002) ruled that two robbery convictions
qualified as strikes, because the defendant did not meet the burden of proving the
lack of a weapon as required by 18 U.S.C.A. § 3559(c)(3)(A)(i). U.S. v. Wicks (7th Cir.
1997) upheld the law in its entirety.
In the mid-1990s twenty-three states passed laws for long, usually mandatory
sentences for second and third offenses, called three strikes laws. Most of those states
have used the laws sparingly, applying them to only a handful of cases and requiring
each of the three strikes to involve violence. California, however, allows less serious
crimes as the third strike and applies the law extensively. An out-of-state conviction
that was dismissed at completion of a domestic violence diversion program counted
as a strike in People v. Laino (Cal. 2004). The U.S. Supreme Court upheld California’s
three strikes law in two decisions, Lockyer v. Andrade (2003) and Ewing v. California
(2003). Andrade was sentenced to fifty years to life for the theft of $150 worth of
videotapes, and Ewing was sentenced to twenty-five years to life for the theft of three
golf clubs. In Crosby v. Delaware (Del. 2003), however, the Delaware Supreme Court
ruled that a forty-five years to life sentence was disproportionate, even though the of-
fender had five previous felonies.
Some state and federal laws impose mandatory minimum sentences, which re-
strict judges from giving lower sentences, often for weapons or drug crimes.
A 1994 “safety valve” provision of the federal law, 18 U.S.C.A. § 3553(f), allows
judges to depart from mandatory minimum sentences in drug offenses if the defen-
dant (1) has not more than one criminal history point, (2) did not use or threaten vio-
lence or possess a dangerous weapon in connection with the offense, (3) did not kill
or seriously injure any person, (4) was not an organizer or leader in the offense, and
(5) has truthfully provided all information and evidence the defendant has to the gov-
ernment not later than the time of the sentencing hearing.
presumptive sentence:
the midway point of the sen-
tencing range.

530
■
CHAPTER 14
Some courts deny the safety valve if the defendant lied before making a truthful
disclosure at the sentencing hearing [U.S. v. Ramunno (7th Cir. 1998)], but others allow
the departure if the full and truthful disclosure comes by the opening of the sentenc-
ing hearing [U.S. v. Schreiber (2d Cir. 1999)]. A refusal to testify against coconspirators
does not bar the safety valve, however [U.S. v. Carpenter (6th Cir. 1998)]. A defendant
who pleaded guilty because he was misled that he was eligible for the safety valve
had his plea set aside in Hernandez-Wilson v. U.S. (1st Cir. 1999).
C.
SENTENCING GUIDELINES
Disproportionality and judicial prejudice was the target of the Sentencing Reform Act
of 1984, creating the United States Sentencing Commission with the assignment to de-
velop uniform guidelines for sentencing in federal cases. The goals of the commission
were to eliminate indeterminate sentencing, and to provide uniformity and propor-
tionality in sentencing.
The resulting guidelines established numbers that stand for base levels of pun-
ishment in each category of crime, with additions and subtractions of points made for
factors affecting the severity of the crime. For example, the defendant’s record as a ca-
reer offender would increase the level of punishment, and her substantial assistance
to the prosecution as a witness against a codefendant would decrease the level. States
followed with similar sentencing guidelines of their own. The Sentencing Commis-
sion surveys the federal guidelines annually, submitting recommended changes for
congressional review.
For years courts understood the Guidelines as a strict limit on sentencing. De-
partures from the guidelines were possible, but not frequent. In Burns v. U.S. (1991),
the Supreme Court ruled that “the only circumstance in which the district court can
disregard the mechanical dictates of the Guidelines is when it finds that there exists
an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately
taken into account by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines.”
The ruling in Apprendi v. New Jersey (2000), however, said that facts upon which
sentence enhancements are based must be found beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury
or admitted by the offender in a plea agreement. Otherwise, they are violations of the
Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury. [Evidence of prior convictions is an exception
that will come before the Supreme Court in U.S. v. Shepard (1st Cir. 2003), cert. granted
(2004).] Blakely v. Washington (2004), dealing with Washington state sentencing guide-
lines similar to the Federal Guidelines, followed Apprendi by saying that a judge can-
not enhance a sentence based on facts that were not decided by a jury or included in
a plea agreement, even though the calculation of the sentence followed the dictates of
the guidelines.
The landmark case U.S. v. Booker (2005), addressed the Federal Guidelines in a
two-part decision. Part one of the decision agrees with Blakely and Apprendi on the
Sixth Amendment right to trial issue. Part two of the Booker decision remedies the con-
flict between the demands of the Guidelines and Sixth Amendment rights. By excis-
ing 18 U.S.C.A. § 3553 (b)(1), which makes the Federal Sentencing Guidelines
mandatory, Booker frees judges to use the Guidelines in an “advisory” capacity and to
set sentences within the statutory range (broader than the Guidelines range). Juries
(and plea bargains) still decide the facts that establish what crime the offender has
committed. Then Booker requires judges to consider all the factors listed in 18 U.S.C.A.
§ 3553(a) to make sentencing decisions. Those considerations include “the nature and
circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant” as
well as the need for just punishment, deterrence to criminal conduct, protection for
the public, and provision of training and care for the defendant.
Booker also excises 18 U.S.C.A. § 3742(e) that had required a de novo review on
appeals of sentencing departures from the guidelines. Instead, appellate courts will
decide on the reasonableness of the sentence.

followed the Booker ruling and are still being sorted through by the Circuit Courts.
IV.
SENTENCING PROCEDURE
A.
INTRODUCTION
In simple cases involving lesser crimes, judges often pronounce sentence at the time
of conviction. In some jurisdictions juries recommend sentences for the judge to con-
sider, and in others sentencing is accomplished by the jury alone.
B.
CAPITAL SENTENCING
States that have capital punishment statutes similar to the Georgia law upheld in
Gregg employ a bifurcated trial. The jury first determines guilt, then considers aggra-
vating and mitigating factors to determine whether the death penalty is warranted. A
list of these factors is usually included in the statute. At least one aggravating cir-
cumstance must be found for death to be imposed.
The Court in Ring v. Arizona (2002) ruled that the aggravating circumstance nec-
essary for the death penalty must be found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt, in
accordance with Apprendi v. New Jersey (2000).
When a death sentence has been pronounced, there is usually an automatic ap-
peal to the state supreme court for a review of evidence supporting the sentence; pro-
portionality with similar cases; and to discover any prejudice, passion, or other
arbitrary factor that might have influenced the sentence. Subsequent appeals may
take many years.
C.
PRESENTENCE REPORT
In serious cases in the federal system, the sentencing hearing is postponed to allow
time for a probation officer to investigate the circumstances of the offense and the
defendant, and to prepare a presentence report. This report is a written presentation
of factors for the judge to consider in determining the sentence. Most states use sim-
ilar reports.
The presentence investigation and report is covered in Federal Rule of Crimi-
nal Procedure 32. This rule provides that the defendant is entitled to presence of
counsel at a presentence interview. It enumerates items that must be included in
the report, such as Sentencing Commission classifications, defendant’s history, vic-
tim impact, and appropriate nonprison resources available for the defendant. Di-
agnostic opinions that might disrupt rehabilitation and information that is
confidential or might cause harm to the defendant or others must be excluded from
the report. Since the Blakely decision, probation officers have continued their sen-
tence calculations and reports as before, but some district courts have asked offi-
cers to identify clearly those factors not proven to a jury or admitted by the
defendant.17
Rule 32(e)(2) requires the probation officer to furnish the report to the defendant, the
defendant’s attorney, and the prosecutor no less than thirty-five days before sentencing.
The sentence recommendation may be withheld. Objections must be communicated be-
tween the parties within fourteen days, and the probation officer may revise the report.
No later than seven days before the hearing, the report and any addendum of un-
resolved objections must be delivered to the court and the parties. Except for unre-
solved objections, the court may accept the report as its findings of fact.
The presentence investigation includes interviews with family, friends, and asso-
ciates of the defendant to gather information on personal background; medical, em-
ployment, criminal, and educational histories; and other factors about the defendant

that might serve as mitigating or aggravating circumstances. Statements by police,
prosecutors, and the victim or victim’s family also are taken to provide a balanced
look at the offense and its impact.
The prosecution paralegal who is aware of particular needs of the victim may bring
these to the attention of the probation officer so that restitution can be considered in the
report. As already noted, the primary impact of the prosecution team on sentencing
comes with the decision of what charges to bring against the defendant. Your sugges-
tions and observations on sentencing factors could be helpful to the prosecutor in de-
terminingcharges.Exhibit14–4 attheendofthechapterisasamplepresentencereport.18
D.
ALTERNATIVE SENTENCING PLAN
The defense should begin to prepare for sentencing before indictment by helping to
shape the charges. At times, the defense team does not enter the case until after this
crucial point. All is not lost, however. Defense paralegals may assist their supervising
attorneys in the preparation of an alternative sentencing plan, a presentence report
from the point of view of the defense. Paralegals who work as sentencing specialists
become experts at this task. Some are employed by states as alternative sentencing
specialists; others have become consultants, contracting out to attorneys in significant
cases. To prepare an effective plan, keep these pointers in mind.19
1.
Never underestimate the victim’s plea for mercy for your client. It is best to
approach the victim through the prosecutor; always have a third neutral
party present, a minister, social worker, or investigator, for example.
Discuss the facts of the case, then explore what the victim sees as
appropriate punishment.
2.
Send a letter to the prosecution, inviting comments and suggestions for
the plan.
3.
Submit the plan to the judge a few days or at least the day before the
sentencing hearing to allow time for consideration of your
recommendations.
4.
Because the judge is familiar with the format of the presentence report, it is
helpful to follow that format for your plan as well.
5.
Get access to the presentence report as soon as possible, explaining that
such access will make the hearing go more smoothly. Because the report is
the “official version” of the offense and of your client’s life, sift through it
carefully to catch any inaccuracies or unfavorable slants that could be
corrected.
6.
If your client waives the presentence report, make sure it is a knowing and
informed waiver. A postsentence report is more difficult to correct and
may affect parole.
7.
In your investigation for the alternative plan, be sure to document all your
information: diagnoses, prognoses, job opportunities, availability of and a
commitment for placement from social services you recommend. News
clips, letters, certificates, and so forth can serve as documentation.
8.
Focus on the person, not the crime. Help the judge see this person as an
individual. Document the hardship a prison sentence would create for the
defendant’s innocent family, if possible. Point out the significant effect that
child abuse in its many forms or other family disruptions may have had
on the defendant. For example, in 1999 half the women inmates in the
United States correctional system had been physically or sexually abused
in their past.20
9.
Focus on the sentencing conditions that will help this defendant succeed.
Point out characteristics that will enable this person to handle employment or
community service: social skills, willingness to work with the disadvantaged,
job experience or know-how, and so forth. Do not identify problems you
cannot solve. Help the judge find a solution for this person’s problems.

Sentencing, Punishment, and Review
■533
10.
Take into consideration the needs for retribution, deterrence, and
rehabilitation.
11.
If possible, document the client’s exemplary conduct between the offense
and sentencing. This conduct must be beyond merely lawful behavior to
be effective.
12.
There are no rules of procedure for presenting the sentencing plan to the
judge at the hearing. It is a good idea to have witnesses and family present
in case the judge has questions and to show support and demonstrate the
impact of a sentence on more than just the defendant. You may summarize
statements for the witnesses.
13.
If the alternative sentencing plan is rejected, save it for future use at parole
hearings.
Exhibit 14–5 is a sample motion for probation with an alternative sentencing plan,
and Exhibit 14–6 is a judgment of sentence of probation.21 These exhibits are at the end
of this chapter.
E.
THE SENTENCING HEARING
1.
Procedure
The judge must pronounce sentence in open court. This pronouncement takes place
at the sentencing hearing where the judge considers trial evidence, the presentence
report and any alternative sentencing plan, evidence submitted by either party, and
the defendant’s statement.
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(i)(2) provides for the court to permit the
parties to introduce evidence on unresolved objections to the presentence report. The
defendant, defense attorney, prosecutor, and the victim of a crime of violence or sex-
ual abuse may make statements either in open court or, by joint motion of defense and
prosecution, in camera. Allocution, the defendant’s due process right to speak in his
or her own behalf [Rule 32(i)(4)], is usually limited in scope at the sentence hearing to
a brief statement of mitigation or response to evidence. One who pleads guilty to a
crime can still invoke the Fifth Amendment privilege not to incriminate oneself at sen-
tencing [Mitchell v. U.S. (1999)]. After sentencing, the court gives notification of the
right to appeal.
The defendant has the right to counsel at the sentencing hearing [Mempa v. Rhay
(1967)], but does not have the right to confront witnesses, which prevents the sen-
tencing hearing from turning into a minitrial. Evidentiary rules at trial do not neces-
sarily apply at the sentencing hearing. Courts are split over applying the exclusionary
rule at sentencing.
2.
Victim Impact
Beginning in the 1980s, laws have been passed giving victims of crime the right to be
involved in the sentencing of their offenders through presentation of a victim impact
statement and addressing the court at the sentencing hearing or testifying at the
penalty phase of the trial. The victim impact statement alerts the judge or jury to the
physical, economic, and psychological harm the offense has caused for the victim and
victim’s family, which may influence the inclusion of restitution in the sentence or af-
fect the harshness of the punishment in general.
Critics fear that an overuse of the victim impact statement and testimony will
cause disparity in sentencing, instituting more severe sentences for offenders against
victims who are well-off with close-knit families, and not penalizing so severely of-
fenders against the homeless persons, for example, who have no one to mourn their
loss. This concern was reflected in Booth v. Maryland (1987), which struck down a
statute requiring a victim impact statement to be considered in the sentencing phase
of capital cases. Subsequently, the Supreme Court reconsidered the use of victim im-
pact evidence in sentencing in Payne v. Tennessee (1991).

CHAPTER 14
Payne v.Tennessee
Supreme Court of the United States, 1991.
501 U.S. 808, 111 S.Ct. 2597.
[Citations omitted]
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of
the court.
In this case we reconsider our holdings in Booth v. Mary-
land, 482 U.S. 496 (1987), and South Carolina v. Gathers,
490 U.S. 805 (1989), that the Eighth Amendment bars the
admission of victim impact evidence during the penalty
phase of a capital trial.
The petitioner, Pervis Tyrone Payne, was convicted by a
jury on two counts of first-degree murder and one count of
assault with intent to commit murder in the first degree. He
was sentenced to death for each of the murders, and to 30
years in prison for the assault.
The victims of Payne’s offenses were 28-year-old
Charisse Christopher, her 2-year-old daughter Lacie, and
her 3-year-old son Nicholas. The three lived together in an
apartment in Millington, Tennessee, across the hall from
Payne’s girlfriend, Bobbie Thomas. On Saturday, June 27,
1987, Payne visited Thomas’ apartment several times in ex-
pectation of her return from her mother’s house in Arkansas,
but found no one at home. On one visit, he left his overnight
bag, containing clothes and other items for his weekend
stay, in the hallway outside Thomas’apartment.With the bag
were three cans of malt liquor.
Payne passed the morning and early afternoon injecting
cocaine and drinking beer. Later, he drove around the town
with a friend in the friend’s car, each of them taking turns
reading a pornographic magazine. Sometime around 3
p.m., Payne returned to the apartment complex, entered the
Christophers’ apartment, and began making sexual ad-
vances towards Charisse. Charisse resisted and Payne be-
came violent. A neighbor who resided in the apartment
directly beneath the Christophers, heard Charisse scream-
ing, “ ‘Get out, get out,’ as if she were telling the children to
leave.” The noise briefly subsided and then began, “horribly
loud.” The neighbor called the police after she heard a
“blood curdling scream” from the Christopher apartment.
When the first police officer arrived at the scene, he im-
mediately encountered Payne who was leaving the apart-
ment building, so covered with blood that he appeared to be
“ ‘sweating blood.’ ” The officer confronted Payne, who re-
sponded, “ ‘I’m the complainant.’ ” When the officer asked,
“ ‘What’s going on up there?’ ” Payne struck the officer with
the overnight bag, dropped his tennis shoes, and fled.
Inside the apartment, the police encountered a horrifying
scene. Blood covered the walls and floor throughout the unit.
Charisse and her children were lying on the floor in the kitchen.
Nicholas, despite several wounds inflicted by a butcher knife
that completely penetrated through his body from front to back,
was still breathing.Miraculously, he survived, but not until after
undergoing seven hours of surgery and a transfusion of 1700
cc’s of blood—400 to 500 cc’s more than his estimated normal
blood volume. Charisse and Lacie were dead.
Charisse’s body was found on the kitchen floor on her
back, her legs fully extended. She had sustained 42 direct
knife wounds and 42 defensive wounds on her arms and
hands. The wounds were caused by 41 separate thrusts of
a butcher knife. None of the 84 wounds inflicted by Payne
were individually fatal; rather, the cause of death was most
likely bleeding from all of the wounds.
Lacie’s body was on the kitchen floor near her mother.
She had suffered stab wounds to the chest, abdomen, back,
and head.The murder weapon, a butcher knife, was found at
her feet.Payne’s baseball cap was snapped on her arm near
her elbow. Three cans of malt liquor bearing Payne’s finger-
prints were found on a table near her body, and a fourth
empty one was on the landing outside the apartment door.
Payne was apprehended later that day hiding in the attic
of the home of a former girlfriend.As he descended the stairs
of the attic, he stated to the arresting officers, “Man, I aint [sic]
killed no woman.” According to one of the officers, Payne had
“a wild look about him. His pupils were contracted. He was
foaming at the mouth, saliva. He appeared to be very nerv-
ous. He was breathing real rapid.” He had blood on his body
and clothes and several scratches across his chest. It was
later determined that the blood stains matched the victims’
blood types. A search of his pockets revealed a packet con-
taining cocaine residue, a hypodermic syringe wrapper, and
a cap from a hypodermic syringe. His overnight bag, con-
taining a bloody white shirt, was found in a nearby dumpster.
At trial, Payne took the stand and, despite the over-
whelming and relatively uncontroverted evidence against
him, testified that he had not harmed any of the Christo-
phers. Rather, he asserted that another man had raced by
him as he was walking up the stairs to the floor where the
Christophers lived. He stated that he had gotten blood on
himself when, after hearing moans from the Christophers’
apartment, he had tried to help the victims. According to his
testimony, he panicked and fled when he heard police sirens
and noticed the blood on his clothes.The jury returned guilty
verdicts against Payne on all counts.
During the sentencing phase of the trial, Payne pre-
sented the testimony of four witnesses: his mother and fa-
ther, Bobbie Thomas, and Dr. John T. Huston, a clinical

Sentencing, Punishment, and Review
■535
psychologist specializing in criminal court evaluation work.
Bobbie Thomas testified that she met Payne at church, dur-
ing a time when she was being abused by her husband. She
stated that Payne was a very caring person, and that he de-
voted much time and attention to her three children, who
were being affected by her marital difficulties. She said that
the children had come to love him very much and would
miss him, and that he “behaved just like a father that loved
his kids.” She asserted that he did not drink, nor did he use
drugs, and that it was generally inconsistent with Payne’s
character to have committed these crimes.
Dr. Huston testified that based on Payne’s low score on
an IQ test, Payne was “mentally handicapped.” Huston also
said that Payne was neither psychotic nor schizophrenic,
and that Payne was the most polite prisoner he had ever
met. Payne’s parents testified that their son had no prior
criminal record and had never been arrested. They also
stated that Payne had no history of alcohol or drug abuse,
he worked with his father as a painter, he was good with chil-
dren, and that he was a good son.
The State presented the testimony of Charisse’s mother,
Mary Zvolanek.When asked how Nicholas had been affected
by the murders of his mother and sister, she responded:
“He cries for his mom. He doesn’t seem to understand
why she doesn’t come home. And he cries for his sister
Lacie. He comes to me many times during the week and
asks me, Grandmama, do you miss my Lacie. And I tell
him yes. He says, I’m worried about my Lacie.”
In arguing for the death penalty during closing argument,
the prosecutor commented on the continuing effects of
Nicholas’ experience, stating:
“But we do know that Nicholas was alive. And Nicholas
was in the same room. Nicholas was still conscious. His
eyes were open. He responded to the paramedics. He
was able to follow their directions. He was able to hold his
intestines in as he was carried to the ambulance. So he
knew what happened to his mother and baby sister.”
“There is nothing you can do to ease the pain of any of
the families involved in this case.There is nothing you can
do to ease the pain of Bernice or Carl Payne, and that’s
a tragedy. There is nothing you can do basically to ease
the pain of Mr. and Mrs. Zvolanek, and that’s a tragedy.
They will have to live with it the rest of their lives.There is
obviously nothing you can do for Charisse and Lacie Jo.
But there is something that you can do for Nicholas.
“Somewhere down the road Nicholas is going to grow up,
hopefully. He’s going to want to know what happened.
And he is going to know what happened to his baby sis-
ter and his mother. He is going to want to know what type
of justice was done. He is going to want to know what
happened.With your verdict, you will provide the answer.”
In the rebuttal to Payne’s closing argument, the prosecu-
tor stated:
“You saw the videotape this morning. You saw what
Nicholas Christopher will carry in his mind forever. When
you talk about cruel, when you talk about atrocious, and
when you talk about heinous, that picture will always come
into your mind, probably throughout the rest of your lives.
. . . . .
“. . . No one will ever know about Lacie Jo because she
never had the chance to grow up. Her life was taken from
her at the age of two years old. So, no there won’t be a
high school principal to talk about Lacie Jo Christopher,
and there won’t be anybody to take her to her high school
prom. And there won’t be anybody there—there won’t be
her mother there or Nicholas’ mother there to kiss him at
night.His mother will never kiss him good night or pat him
as he goes off to bed, or hold him and sing him a lullaby.
. . . . .
“[Petitioner’s attorney] wants you to think about a good
reputation, people who love the defendant and things
about him. He doesn’t want you to think about the people
who love Charisse Christopher, her mother and daddy
who loved her. The people who loved little Lacie Jo, the
grandparents who are still here.The brother who mourns
for her every single day and wants to know where his
best little playmate is. He doesn’t have anybody to watch
cartoons with him, a little one. These are the things that
go into why it is especially cruel, heinous, and atrocious,
the burden that that child will carry forever.”
The jury sentenced Payne to death on each of the mur-
der counts.
The Supreme Court of Tennessee affirmed the convic-
tion and sentence. The court rejected Payne’s contention
that the admission of the grandmother’s testimony and the
State’s closing argument constituted prejudicial violations of
his rights under the Eighth Amendment as applied in Booth
v. Maryland, 482 U.S. 496 (1987), and South Carolina v.
Gathers, 490 U.S. 805 (1989). The court characterized the
grandmother’s testimony as “technically irrelevant,” but con-
cluded that it “did not create a constitutionally unacceptable
risk of an arbitrary imposition of the death penalty and was
harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.”
The court determined that the prosecutor’s comments dur-
ing closing argument were “relevant to [Payne’s] personal re-
sponsibility and moral guilt.” The court explained that “[w]hen
a person deliberately picks a butcher knife out of a kitchen
drawer and proceeds to stab to death a twenty-eight-year-old
mother, her two and one-half year old daughter and her three
and one-half year old son, in the same room, the physical and
mental condition of the boy he left for dead is surely relevant
in determining his ‘blameworthiness.’ ” The court concluded
that any violation of Payne’s rights under Booth and Gathers
“was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.”
We granted certiorari to reconsider our holdings in Booth
and Gathers that the Eighth Amendment prohibits a capital

CHAPTER 14
sentencing jury from considering “victim impact” evidence
relating to the personal characteristics of the victim and the
emotional impact of the crimes on the victim’s family.
In Booth, the defendant robbed and murdered an elderly
couple. As required by a state statute, a victim impact state-
ment was prepared based on interviews with the victims’
son, daughter, son-in-law, and granddaughter. The state-
ment, which described the personal characteristics of the
victims, the emotional impact of the crimes on the family,
and set forth the family members’ opinions and characteri-
zations of the crimes and the defendant, was submitted to
the jury at sentencing. The jury imposed the death penalty.
The conviction and sentence were affirmed on appeal by
the State’s highest court.
This Court held by a 5-to-4 vote that the Eighth Amend-
ment prohibits a jury from considering a victim impact state-
ment at the sentencing phase of a capital trial. The Court
made clear that the admissibility of victim impact evidence
was not to be determined on a case-by-case basis, but that
such evidence was per se inadmissible in the sentencing
phase of a capital case except to the extent that it “relate[d]
directly to the circumstances of the crime.” In Gathers, de-
cided two years later, the Court extended the rule announced
in Booth to statements made by a prosecutor to the sentenc-
ing jury regarding the personal qualities of the victim.
The Booth Court began its analysis with the observation
that the capital defendant must be treated as a “uniquely in-
dividual human bein[g],” and therefore the Constitution re-
quires the jury to make an individualized determination as to
whether the defendant should be executed based on the
“character of the individual and the circumstances of the
crime.”. . .To the extent that victim impact evidence presents
“factors about which the defendant was unaware, and that
were irrelevant to the decision to kill,” the Court concluded,
it has nothing to do with the “blameworthiness of a particu-
lar defendant.”. . . [T]he prosecution may not introduce such
evidence at a capital sentencing hearing because “it creates
an impermissible risk that the capital sentencing decision
will be made in an arbitrary manner.”
Booth and Gathers were based on two premises: that ev-
idence relating to a particular victim or to the harm that a
capital defendant causes a victim’s family do not in general
reflect on the defendant’s “blameworthiness,” and that only
evidence relating to “blameworthiness” is relevant to the
capital sentencing decision. However, the assessment of
harm caused by the defendant as a result of the crime
charged has understandably been an important concern of
the criminal law, both in determining the elements of the of-
fense and in determining the appropriate punishment.Thus,
two equally blameworthy criminal defendants may be guilty
of different offenses solely because their acts cause differ-
ing amounts of harm. “If a bank robber aims his gun at a
guard, pulls the trigger, and kills his target, he may be put to
death. If the gun unexpectedly misfires, he may not. His
moral guilt in both cases is identical, but his responsibility in
the former is greater.”. . .
The Maryland statute involved in Booth required that the
presentence report in all felony cases include a “victim im-
pact statement” which would describe the effect of the crime
on the victim and his family. Booth, supra, at 498. Congress
and most of the States have, in recent years, enacted simi-
lar legislation to enable the sentencing authority to consider
information about the harm caused by the crime committed
by the defendant.The evidence involved in the present case
was not admitted pursuant to any such enactment, but its
purpose and effect was much the same as if it had been.
While the admission of this particular kind of evidence—de-
signed to portray for the sentencing authority the actual
harm caused by a particular crime—is of recent origin, this
fact hardly renders it unconstitutional. . . .
Booth reasoned that victim impact evidence must be ex-
cluded because it would be difficult, if not impossible, for the
defendant to rebut such evidence without shifting the focus
of the sentencing hearing away from the defendant, thus
creating a “ ‘mini-trial’ on the victim’s character.” In many
cases the evidence relating to the victim is already before
the jury at least in part because of its relevance at the guilt
phase of the trial. But even as to additional evidence admit-
ted at the sentencing phase, the mere fact that for tactical
reasons it might not be prudent for the defense to rebut vic-
tim impact evidence makes the case no different than oth-
ers in which a party is faced with this sort of a dilemma. . . .
Payne echoes the concern voiced in Booth’s case that the
admission of victim impact evidence permits a jury to find that
defendants whose victims were assets to their community are
more deserving of punishment than those whose victims are
perceived to be less worthy.As a general matter, however, vic-
tim impact evidence is not offered to encourage comparative
judgments of this kind—for instance, that the killer of a hard-
working, devoted parent deserves the death penalty, but that
the murderer of a reprobate does not. It is designed to show
instead each victim’s “uniqueness as an individual human be-
ing,” whatever the jury might think the loss to the community
resulting from his death might be. . . . Courts have always
taken into consideration the harm done by the defendant in
imposing sentence, and the evidence adduced in this case
was illustrative of the harm caused by Payne’s double murder.
We are now of the view that a State may properly con-
clude that for the jury to assess meaningfully the defen-
dant’s moral culpability and blameworthiness, it should have
before it at the sentencing phase evidence of the specific
harm caused by the defendant. . . .
The present case is an example of the potential for . . . un-
fairness. The capital sentencing jury heard testimony from
Payne’s girlfriend that they met at church, that he was affec-
tionate, caring, kind to her children, that he was not an abuser
of drugs or alcohol, and that it was inconsistent with his char-
acter to have committed the murders. Payne’s parents testi-
fied that he was a good son, and a clinical psychologist
testified that Payne was an extremely polite prisoner and suf-
fered from a low IQ. None of this testimony was related to the
circumstances of Payne’s brutal crimes. In contrast, the only

Sentencing, Punishment, and Review
■537
evidence of the impact of Payne’s offenses during the sen-
tencing phase was Nicholas’ grandmother’s description—in
response to a single question—that the child misses his
mother and baby sister.Payne argues that the Eighth Amend-
ment commands that the jury’s death sentence must be set
aside because the jury heard this testimony.But the testimony
illustrated quite poignantly some of the harm that Payne’s
killing had caused; there is nothing unfair about allowing the
jury to bear in mind that harm at the same time as it consid-
ers the mitigating evidence introduced by the defendant.
. . .
Reconsidering [Booth and Gathers] now, we conclude for
the reasons heretofore stated, that they were wrongly de-
cided and should be, and now are, overruled.We accordingly
affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of Tennessee.

The overruling of one of this Court’s precedents ought to be
a matter of great moment and consequence. Although the
doctrine of stare decisis is not an “inexorable command,”
this Court has repeatedly stressed that fidelity to precedent
is fundamental to “a society governed by the rule of law,”
(“[I]t is indisputable that stare decisis is a basic self-govern-
ing principle within the Judicial Branch, which is entrusted
with the sensitive and difficult task of fashioning and pre-
serving a jurisprudential system that is not based upon ‘an
arbitrary discretion.’The Federalist, No. 78, p. 490 (H. Lodge
ed. 1888) (A. Hamilton)”).
JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE BLACKMUN
joins, dissenting.
. . .
II.
Today’s majority has obviously been moved by an argument
that has strong political appeal but no proper place in a rea-
soned judicial opinion. Because our decision in Lockett, 438
U.S., at 604 (opinion of Burger, C. J.), recognizes the de-
fendant’s right to introduce all mitigating evidence that may
inform the jury about his character, the Court suggests that
fairness requires that the State be allowed to respond with
similar evidence about the victim.This argument is a classic
non sequitur: The victim is not on trial; her character,
whether good or bad, cannot therefore constitute either an
aggravating or mitigating circumstance. . . .
The premise that a criminal prosecution requires an even-
handed balance between the State and the defendant is also
incorrect. The Constitution grants certain rights to the crimi-
nal defendant and imposes special limitations on the State
designed to protect the individual from overreaching by the
disproportionately powerful State.Thus, the State must prove
a defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Rules of evi-
dence are also weighted in the defendant’s favor. For exam-
ple, the prosecution generally cannot introduce evidence of
the defendant’s character to prove his propensity to commit
a crime, but the defendant can introduce such reputation ev-
idence to show his law-abiding nature. Even if balance were
required or desirable, today’s decision, by permitting both the
defendant and the State to introduce irrelevant evidence for
the sentencer’s consideration without any guidance, surely
does nothing to enhance parity in the sentencing process.
III.
Victim impact evidence, as used in this case, has two flaws,
both related to the Eighth Amendment’s command that the
punishment of death may not be meted out arbitrarily or
capriciously. First, aspects of the character of the victim un-
foreseeable to the defendant at the time of his crime are ir-
relevant to the defendant’s “personal responsibility and moral
guilt” and therefore cannot justify a death sentence. . . .
Second, the quantity and quality of victim impact evi-
dence sufficient to turn a verdict of life in prison into a ver-
dict of death is not defined until after the crime has been
committed and therefore cannot possibly be applied consis-
tently in different cases. . . .
IV.
The majority thus does far more than validate a State’s judg-
ment that “the jury should see ‘a quick glimpse of the life peti-
tioner chose to extinguish,’ ” Instead, it allows a jury to hold a
defendant responsible for a whole array of harms that he could
not foresee and for which he is therefore not blameworthy. . . .
Payne v. Tennessee overruled most of Booth, allowing family evidence at sentenc-
ing when authorized by statute. Societal impact statements have been allowed to
show how the murder of a gas station attendant affected others working in similar
situations and the security measures considered for their protection [State v. Sivak (Id.
1990)]. The decision in Lynn v. Reinstein (Ariz. May 2003), however, barred the hus-
band of a murder victim from including in his Victim Impact Statement a recommen-
dation that the killer be sentenced to life in prison rather than death. The court held
that the Eighth Amendment renders victims’ opinions on sentencing irrelevant. Some

SERVING THE SENTENCE
A.
REVOCATION OF PROBATION
If conditions of probation are violated by the probationer, probation may be revoked
and the probationer sent to prison to complete the term of sentence. The decision to
seek revocation is exercised by the probation officer. First, a preliminary hearing is
held to determine if there is probable cause for revocation, then evidence is presented
at a revocation hearing for the determination of revocation. Federal Rule of Criminal
Procedure 32.1 provides the framework for these hearings.
1.
A preliminary hearing is held to determine probable cause to hold the
person for a revocation hearing. The person shall be given
a.
notice of the hearing, purpose, and alleged violation;
b.
an opportunity to appear and present evidence;
c.
upon request, opportunity to question witnesses unless, for good
cause, the federal magistrate judge decides that justice does not re-
quire the appearance of witnesses; and
d.
notice of the right to be represented by counsel.
Proceedings shall be recorded. If probable cause is found, the person shall
be held for a revocation hearing.
2.
The revocation hearing, unless waived by the probationer, shall be held
within reasonable time in the district of jurisdiction. The person shall be
given
a.
written notice of the alleged violation;
b.
disclosure of evidence against the person;
c.
an opportunity to appear and to present evidence on the person’s
own behalf;
d.
the opportunity to question adverse witnesses; and
e.
notice of the person’s right to be represented by counsel.
State rules may vary from these. Be sure to consult your rules, particularly in re-
gard to right to counsel and confrontation of witnesses. Rules of evidence are not so
stringent as those at trial. Hearsay may be allowed, but revocation may not rest solely
on hearsay evidence. Also, the burden of proof is relaxed; the court may revoke pro-
bation if it is reasonably satisfied that a violation occurred. The court can exercise its
discretion not to revoke probation, however, even if a violation is established.
B.
PAROLE AND ITS REVOCATION
Prisoners may be released early from incarceration in many state systems if they con-
vince the parole board that they are ready to conduct their lives within the require-
ments of the law. Parole is supervised by a parole officer to ensure that conditions of
release are met by the parolee, much like the conditions for probation. If those con-
ditions are violated, revocation is processed in hearings similar to those for proba-
tion revocation. A parolee who signs a parole agreement allowing unwarranted

searches does not have an expectation of privacy, and the exclusionary rule does not
apply to state parole proceedings [Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole v. Scott
(1998). Twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia require violent offenders to
serve at least 85 percent of their prison sentences. Six states have abolished discre-
tionary parole releases, and four states have abolished discretionary releases of cer-
tain violent or felony offenders. Paroles mandated by statute became the primary
means of release from state prisons by 1999; 41 percent of releases were mandated
compared with 24 percent by discretionary action of parole boards.22 Federal inmates
may still earn 15 percent “good time” credit toward early release after the first year
served, a substantial reduction from prior parole possibilities after one-third of the
sentence was served. Check your state’s statutes for parole and revocation conditions
and procedure.
When you work with the prosecution team in parole cases, provide contact in-
formation on the victim to the parole officer and let the officer know if the victim
wants to attend the parole hearing, submit a revised impact statement, or be notified
of the convict’s release date.
C.
RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF PRISONERS
Despite often wretched conditions, prisons are not “black holes” where prisoners are
dumped never to be heard from again. Some constitutional rights are forfeited with
conviction, such as rights to free assembly and association, as well as First Amend-
ment rights that are “inconsistent with [the] status as a prisoner or with the legitimate
penological objectives of the corrections system” [Pell v. Procunier (1974)]. Pell ruled,
however, that inmates may possess religious materials and receive visits by clergy.
The Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 prohibits imposi-
tion of a substantial burden on inmates’ exercise of religion, except for compelling
governmental interest. That law was upheld in Madison v. Riter (4th Cir. 2003), in a de-
cision allowing kosher meals upon request. The same law was declared an unconsti-
tutional violation of the Establishment Clause in Cutter v. Wilkinson (6th Cir. 2003)
cert. granted (2004), however, because it protects religious rights more than other civil
rights of inmates. In the Cutter case, a pagan religion claimed by inmates was al-
legedly used to camouflage gang activity. Inmates have access to the mails, but letters
may be censored. Censorship may not interfere with the attorney-client relationship,
however [Lee v. Tahash (8th Cir. 1965)]. Prisoners must be allowed access to the courts
[Ex Parte Hull (1941)] and must have access to writing materials, notarial services, law
libraries, and private consultation with attorneys. Several cases have resulted in con-
flicting decisions about inmate access to the Internet.23
The focus on prison conditions brought an explosion of prisoners’ rights cases
into court following the decision in Bounds v. Smith (1977), which requires that the
fundamental constitutional right of access to courts requires prison authorities to as-
sist inmates in preparing and filing meaningful legal papers. Prisoner petitions con-
stituted one-third of all appeals in 1996. Prisoner civil rights petitions doubled
between 1987 and 1996. To combat the filing of lawsuits over “insufficient storage
locker space, a defective haircut by a prison barber, . . . and yes, being served chunky
peanut butter instead of the creamy variety,” free access to the courts was limited by
the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) of 1996, 28 U.S.C.A. § 1915. This law restricts
in pauperis filing of successive, frivolous petitions and requires the inmate to exhaust
administrative remedies before filing petitions [Thomas v. McCaughtry (7th Cir. 2000)].
The 10th Circuit joined the 6th Circuit in ruling that prisoners must prove they have
exhausted prison administrative procedures before a federal court will review their
protest of prison conditions [Steele v. Federal Bureau of Prisons (10th Cir. 2003)]. The 2d,
3d, 7th, 8th, 9th, and D.C. Circuits, however, require prisons to raise the question of
exhaustion as an affirmative defense [Wyatt v. Terhune (9th Cir. 2003)].24
Lewis v. Casey (1996) further narrowed Bounds, giving prisoners standing to sue
only when they can demonstrate actual injury from some constitutional shortcoming

540
■
CHAPTER 14
and providing judicial remedies only to the extent of curing the inadequacies that
caused the harm. Claiming a denial of access to courts because the prison law library
and legal assistance program was subpar without demonstrating that the inadequacy
hindered efforts to pursue a legal claim did not reach the level of actual injury.
Actual injury was not established by the confiscation of legal materials that were
passed from one inmate to another without authorization, because other materials
were available [Bass v. Singletary (11th Cir. 1998)]. Imminent danger of serious injury
from a vent emitting pollutants entitled a prisoner to file a complaint under pauper
status, although three previous complaints had been dismissed as frivolous under
PLRA [Gibbs v. Cross (3d Cir. 1998)].
Hudson v. McMillian (1992) ruled that excessive physical force against a prisoner
may constitute cruel and unusual punishment even when an inmate does not suffer
serious injury. The central question is whether the force occurred as a “good faith ef-
fort to maintain or restore discipline or maliciously and sadistically for the very pur-
pose of causing harm.” De minimis use of physical force is allowed by the Eighth
Amendment, however, provided the use is not of a sort that is repugnant to the con-
science of mankind, such as sexual touching.
Most frequently, prison discipline takes the form of removal of “good-time”
credit for early release. Due process procedures include the rights to notice of disci-
plinary action, to an administrative hearing with a written record, and to produce ev-
idence and witnesses refuting charges, but not the right to have counsel present. An
HIV positive inmate who had spat on two guards was required to wear a mask that
covered his entire head and was denied all outdoor exercise for nine months. Because
he had not received a warning or hearing on the matter, his due process rights had
been denied [Perkins v. Kansas Department of Corrections (10th Cir. 1999)].
In Overton v. Bazzetta (2003) the U.S. Supreme Court upheld Michigan prison re-
strictions on visits to inmates in the interests of security and to combat inmate substance
abuse. Even in noncontact visits, visitors must be on an approved list, which includes
immediate family members and up to ten other approved persons, qualified clergy, and
attorneys on business. Inmates with two or more substance abuse violations may have
visits only from clergy and attorneys, with a review of privileges after two years.
VI.
APPEALS
A.
INTRODUCTION
The most immediate reason for appealing a case to a higher tribunal is to correct an
error made at the trial court level. This function serves the due process responsibili-
ties of the courts. When appeals reach the highest levels of the court structure, how-
ever, another function becomes primary. Here to the greatest extent, the language of
the law, both constitutional and statutory, is brought into the context of actual events;
the theoretical is interpreted into the practical, and adjustments are made. Laws of
substance and procedure are struck down, upheld, refined, and standardized. Previ-
ous court decisions are elaborated, bolstered, or nullified. It is here that the law be-
comes responsive to the lives of real people. The cases you research to support your
view of a case come from the body of appellate decisions whose ripple effect touches
the justice system at every level.
Appeal by right is allowed, without seeking permission, to the court level just
above the trial court. Appeals from federal district courts are taken by right to the
United States Courts of Appeal. At the state level, appeals by right go from the trial level
courts to intermediate appellate courts or, in a few states, special criminal appeals
courts. In some less populous states, routine appeals may go directly to the highest
court. Further review may be available by the highest state courts in discretionary

the United States Supreme Court through writ of certiorari. The Supreme Court also

B.
BASIS FOR APPEAL
1.
Conditions for Appeal
Appeals are possible usually only after final decisions on conviction and sentencing.
Modification and revocation of probation may also be appealable. Exceptions to the
“final decision” limit are a few collateral issues that may be subject to interlocutory
appeal, allowing for resolution before trial.
Most appeals are subsequent to a plea of not guilty. Issues of jurisdiction, invol-
untary plea, or legality of sentence may be appealed after a guilty plea, however, if
the defendant requested withdrawal of the plea and was refused by the trial court
[Counts v. State (Fla. App. 1979)].
2.
What Can Be Challenged on Appeal
Any decision by the trial court objected to by the defense can be raised on appeal.
Even if no objections were voiced, appeals may be based on improper jurisdiction or
actions that could be considered plain error, an obvious error that merits appellate re-
versal even if not objected to at trial. How fundamental the error must be varies from
court to court, but the seriousness of capital cases tends to lead to a more liberal con-
sideration of error [Fisher v. U.S. (1946)]. Since the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, sen-
tences can be appealed. Grounds for sentencing appeals by both defendant and
government are provided in 18 U.S.C.A. § 3742.
Of all the federal appeals completed in 2001, 77 percent were decided on the mer-
its, that is, based on the factors of the case; the rest were based on procedural grounds.
Of those decided on the merits, 79 percent affirmed the lower court ruling, with an
additional 4 percent affirmed in part, 9 percent reversed or remanded, and 7 percent
dismissed. See the charts in Exhibit 14–7.25

CHAPTER 14
3.
Harmless Error
If the appellate court does determine that error occurred at the trial level, it then must
determine whether the error was substantial enough to take remedial action. If the er-
ror is so blatant as to offend public standards of justice, the lower court decision is
generally reversed. A less conspicuous error may be harmful enough for reversal if it
substantially affected the outcome of the trial. A number of lesser errors, harmless if
considered individually, may accumulate to constitute an unfair trial.
Errors not impinging on the outcome of the trial, however, are considered harmless
errors and, as such, are not grounds for reversal. The standards for harmlessness are
somewhat more stringent for constitutional issues than for errors not involving consti-
tutional matters. Chapman v. California (1967) requires appellate courts to decide harm-
lessness beyond a reasonable doubt in considering errors of constitutional scope.
An appellate court may not base a reversal simply on disagreement with the out-
come of the trial. The fact finder, jury or judge, alone is responsible for assessing the
“whodunnit” aspects of the case. Questions of law, procedural and substantive, and
whether errors in these areas improperly influenced the fact finder are the issues that
rise to the appellate level.
4.
Appeals by Prosecution
“Appeals by the government in criminal cases are something unusual, exceptional,
and not favored” [Carroll v. U.S. (1957)]. Double jeopardy is a distinct danger from ap-
peals of acquittals by the state, so appeals by the prosecution are allowed only when
“plainly provided” by statute. In the federal system, 18 U.S.C.A. § 3731 permits ap-
peals from federal district court orders that
a.
Dismiss indictment,
b.
Grant a new trial after judgment or verdict,
c.
Suppress evidence prior to the time that the defendant is put in jeopardy, or
d.
Release a defendant prior to trial or after conviction.
The government also may appeal sentences that are unreasonable or violate the
law. Government appeals avoid double jeopardy concerns by entering appeal before
jeopardy attaches or not challenging the acquittal itself.
C.
APPELLATE PROCEDURE
1.
Introduction
Appellate procedure is quite complex, involving exacting rules on requirements, time
limits, and formats. Moreover, the rules vary in detail among jurisdictions. It is neces-
sary to follow the pattern in your jurisdiction with great care; you do not want to be re-
sponsible for a technical error that invalidates the entire appeal. Be sure to consult the
Federal Rules ofAppellate Procedure (FRAP), local rules of court (LRs), and internal op-
erating procedures (IOPs) for detailed rules governing each step for the relevant court.
Remember that even though the defendant is not so immediately involved with
the appellate process as at the trial, he or she is still intensely concerned about how
the case is progressing. As a paralegal, you are in an excellent position to keep your
clients informed. You need to contact them frequently, helping them understand each
significant document and step of the procedure. Be honest in discussing the time re-
quired, stringency of rules, and the likelihood of success as conveyed to you by the
attorney. Disgruntled defendants can do surprising things, and their angry letters to
the governor, appellate court, or local newspaper will probably not help the case.
Defense attorneys are not always required to file an appeal after the defendant
pleads guilty, unless the defendant specifically asks them to [Roe v. Flores-Ortega
(2000)]. In Martinez v. The Court of Appeals of California (2000), the Supreme Court ruled
that there is no federal constitutional right to represent oneself on appeal. States may
recognize the right for the defendant to refuse counsel at the appellate level, however,
under their own constitutions. The right to counsel in appeals by right was estab-
harmless error:
trivial error not prejudicial to
the rights of the party; does
not affect the outcome of the
case.

lished in Douglas v. California (1963). After the Douglas decision, courts were inun-
dated with appeals, many of them so lacking in merit that appointed counsel often at-
tempted to withdraw. In order to ensure effective counsel, the ruling in Anders v.
California (1967) required appointed counsel to submit a brief, subsequently known as
an Anders brief, demonstrating that the appeal was wholly frivolous before they
could withdraw. The Supreme Court ruled in Smith v. Robbins (2000) that Anders brief
requirements are not obligatory as long as the state provides a procedure that ade-
quately safeguards the defendant’s right to appellate counsel.
2.
Release on Bail
Pending appeal, the defendant may be released on bail. Criteria for release are enu-
merated in 18 U.S.C.A. § 3143 and similar state rules. Bail often depends on whether
the appeal is not frivolous but based on a substantial point of law, and on whether the
defendant’s flight risk is low. Denial or unreasonably high bail may be appealed. Un-
like bail before trial, there is no presumption in favor of postconviction release.
3.
Filing the Appeal
Notice or petition of appeal is filed with the clerk of the appellate court; copies may
be required for appropriate state officials and officers of the trial court. A statement of
issues may be part of the notice or filed separately. A filing fee must accompany the
notice; indigent appellants may move to proceed in forma pauperis to waive this fee
and other costs of appeal.
Rule 4(b) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure requires notice to be filed
within ten days of entry of judgment in federal district court. A motion for expansion
of time may allow an additional thirty days. When the appeal comes from the gov-
ernment, thirty days are allowed for notice. Appeals from state court to the United
States Supreme Court must be filed within ninety days of entry of judgment. Most
state courts require notice to be filed within thirty days of judgment. These time lim-
its are strictly enforced, with late filings resulting in dismissal of the appeal.
4.
Ordering the Transcript
File a designation of record with the clerk of the trial court to indicate the sections of
the trial record to be sent to the appellate court. Procedures for this step vary. Make
sure you order the trial transcript from the trial court reporter for your own use within
the required time limit, usually thirty days or less. The delivery of the transcript starts
another deadline clock giving usually sixty days to file briefs.
If you are entering the case for the first time at the appellate level, a careful di-
gestion of the transcript is in order. Also, obtain access to the court file before it is
shipped to the appellate court. This file contains more than simply the transcript of
testimony; it includes a record of motions, exhibits, and physical evidence. It is also
helpful to talk to the trial prosecutor and investigating police officers, and to examine
the police file and other professional reports if possible. Witnesses not called and ex-
hibits not introduced at trial may be a mine of helpful leads. Investigate all possible
reasons for the appellate court to reverse the conviction of your client.26
5.
Filing of Motions
Motions may be filed by both sides concerning matters outside the central issues of
appeal. Expansion or expedition of time may be requested, multiple appeals may be
consolidated or severed, funds for work of an expert witness may be requested, or
judgment or sentence may be stayed for good cause.
6.
Filing of Briefs
Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28 and similar state rules give detailed instruc-
tions as to the form, content, and method of submission of the appellate brief. This is
the document that bears the heaviest responsibility for persuading the court to decide

544
■
CHAPTER 14
the appeal in your client’s favor. For the appeal by right, the appellant, one who is seek-
ing relief, files the first brief containing the factual background of the case and defen-
dant; determination of the lower court; legal position; and citations to determinative
constitutional, statutory, or judicial authority supporting that position. The appellee
may respond in an answer brief, then the appellant is allowed rebuttal in a reply brief.
If a petition for discretionary review is granted, all parties are ordered to submit
responses. A petitioner’s reply to the opposing response may be allowed. Supple-
mental briefs from both sides may be required by the court. In all cases, both sides
send copies of briefs and other materials to the opposing side.
Legal briefs are available on the Internet for purchase at several sites27 and also
for free from several state courts, a couple of federal circuit courts, and the Supreme
Court.28 Other federal agencies and a variety of advocacy groups also offer briefs on-
line. Follow sample briefs and court rules very carefully to make sure that briefs sub-
mitted include all necessary items, and that the cover page, table of contents, and
table of authorities conform to the court’s format and clarify the contents of the brief.29
7.
Oral Argument
When oral argument is required, counsel for both sides present summaries of their
positions to the court within time limitations. Judges then question counsel from the
bench for further background or clarification.
8.
Preparation and Publication of the Opinion
After a review of the record and possibly additional legal research by counsel or the
court’s staff, the panel of judges meets in judicial conference to decide on the appeal.
The senior judge or senior judge voting with the majority on this case usually assigns
one member of the panel to write the opinion. The opinion may simply state that the
trial court’s judgment is affirmed, reversed, or that a new trial is ordered, or it may
present elaborate arguments and precedents supporting the ruling of the court.
A per curiam opinion represents the decision of the entire panel. More often the
opinion is signed by the writer and by others voting in the majority. Concurring opin-
ions emphasize different arguments in support of the same conclusion. Judges voting
in the minority may add their dissenting opinions. The publication of appellate deci-
sions in reporters provides guidance for attorneys and judges in subsequent cases.
9.
Motion for Rehearing
A motion for rehearing requests the appellate court to reconsider its decision.
Grounds may include misstatements of fact, or other overlooked or misunderstood
matters. These motions are often denied as a last-ditch effort to throw the case on the
mercy of the court.
Exhibit 14–8 is a federal notice of appeal, and Exhibit 14–9 is an affidavit in sup-
port of a motion to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis.
VII.
THE WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS
A.
INTRODUCTION
After all rights to appeal have been exhausted and time limits have expired, review
of the conviction of one in custody may still be available through the writ of habeas
corpus. The federal and all state systems provide this remedy that has stood as a cor-
nerstone for the rights of the accused since the time of the Magna Carta. The Latin
phrase means “you have the body.” The writ requires the person holding another in
custody to show just cause for that custody.
The United States Constitution, Article 1, Section 9(2), provides that “[t]he Privi-
lege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended unless when in Cases of Re-
bellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.” The only suspension of the writ,

Sentencing, Punishment, and Review
■545
during the Civil War, was subsequently declared unconstitutional. Originally applied
only to federal prisoners, federal review extends to state prisoners “in custody in vi-
olation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States” [28 U.S.C.A.
§ 2254(a)]. States provide their own collateral review on questions of state law.
B.
CRITERIA FOR ACCESS TO HABEAS CORPUS
Thepetitionerforawritofhabeascorpusmustbe“incustody.”Custodyextendsbeyond
incarceration to include parole, probation, pretrial release, or diversionary programs.
Defendants convicted in federal courts have rather straightforward access to
habeas corpus relief in the federal system (28 U.S.C.A. § 2241). Transfers from state to
federal systems, however, have numerous impediments (28 U.S.C.A. § 2254). A ques-
tion of federal law must be involved and state court remedies must have been exhausted
or ineffective in protecting the rights of the prisoner. The case record is presumed cor-
rect unless it is shown that the state court lacked jurisdiction; the petitioner did not re-
ceive a full and fair hearing, was denied counsel, or otherwise deprived of due process;
or there was not sufficient evidence to support the factual determination in the case.
The decision in Fay v. Noia (1963) held that failure to meet any state procedural re-
quirement for appeal was not a bar to federal habeas review, as long as the bypass of
procedure was not deliberate. Supreme Court decisions through the 1970s gradually
narrowed access to federal habeas corpus review. Davis v. U.S. (1973) and Francis v.
Henderson (1976) required a show of cause and prejudice for access. Stone v. Powell
(1976) blocks habeas relief if a full and fair litigation of a Fourth Amendment claim
has been provided by the state. The ruling in Rasul v. Bush (2004) established that fed-
eral courts have jurisdiction to hear habeas challenges from foreigners captured
abroad and held at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
In 1996 Title I of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), 18
U.S.C.A. § 2244, restricted habeas corpus petitions. AEDPA requires permission from
the court of appeals to file second or successive habeas petitions [Greenawalt v. Stew-
art (9th Cir. 1997)] and provides a one-year period of limitations for application for a
writ of habeas corpus after direct review is final. Review does not become final until
the Supreme Court affirms the defendant’s conviction or denies certiorari. If certio-
rari is not sought, review is final when the time allowed for filing for certiorari expires
[Kapral v. U.S. (3d Cir. 1999)].
A certificate of appealability must be obtained from the U.S. appellate judge be-
fore the habeas petition may be filed [§ 2253(c)(1)]. The certificate must list the specific
issues on appeal [Hiivala v. Wood (9th Cir. 1999)]. All state remedies must be exhausted
in matters pursuant to state court judgments before application can be made for a fed-
eral writ of habeas corpus [§ 2254(b)(1)].Aclaim that was not raised in the state’s high-
est court cannot be pursued in a federal habeas claim [O’Sullivan v. Boerckel (1999)].
Georgia and Wyoming do not provide counsel to death row inmates in habeas
corpus proceedings [Gibson v. Turpin (Ga. 1999)]. All other states do [Jackson v. State
(Miss. 1999)].
Common grounds for collateral relief include discovery of new evidence not
available at trial, and retroactive decisions of the Supreme Court that apply to the case.
One of the most frequent claims in habeas corpus petitions is that counsel was in-
effective. This claim is rarely subject to appeal because it is seldom an issue at trial.
Strickland v. Washington (1984) requires ineffective counsel claims to show that coun-
sel did not function in the capacity guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment and that that
deficiency deprived the defendant of a fair trial. A claim of ineffective counsel may be
made for the first time in a habeas corpus petition, because the record may not be suf-
ficiently developed to assess the merits of the claim at the time of direct appeal [Woods
v. State (Ind. 1998)]. The ruling in Massaro v. U.S. (2003), allowed an ineffective assis-
tance claim to be made after a direct appeal on other grounds had been entered.
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Wiggins v. Smith (2003) that attorneys’ failure to
present relevant mitigating evidence was a sufficient violation of the defendant’s

546
■
CHAPTER 14
Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel to grant him habeas relief.
The Court applied standards set out in Strickland in denying that the error could be
excused as a tactical decision.
A defendant gave fraudulent tax documents to her attorney for use in her trial,
which the attorney then turned over to the prosecution in the middle of the trial with-
out reviewing them or warning the defendant of the consequences if they were per-
ceived as fraudulent. The court in U.S. v. Lamplugh (3rd Cir. 2003) ruled that the
subsequent conviction could not be overturned on the basis of ineffective counsel, be-
cause the defendant’s own deceptive action nullified her right to a competent attorney.
C.
HABEAS CORPUS PROCEDURE
In the federal system, 28 U.S.C.A. § 2242 provides for a petition for a hearing on the
writ of habeas corpus to be filed with the federal district court. A petition for habeas
relief has been filed properly when it is delivered to, and accepted by, the appropri-
ate court officer in compliance with requirements of 28 U.S.C.A. § 2244(d) [Artuz v.
Bennett (2000)]. The one-year deadline for filing is based on the expiration of time to
file a petition for certiorari rather than the mandate affirming conviction issued by the
court of appeals [Clay v. U.S (2003)]. Section 2243 provides that unless grounds pre-
sented in the petition are invalid, the court shall award the writ or order the respon-
dent to show cause why the writ should not be granted. The person having custody
receives the writ or order and returns the writ or cause of detention within three days,
or an additional twenty days for good cause. A hearing date is set not more than five
days after the return. The respondent may be required to “produce at the hearing the
body of the person detained” for testimony or, if only issues of law are involved, the
court may render a decision on the record. Further requirements in habeas corpus
practice follow in 28 U.S.C.A. §§ 2244 to 2255 and in §§ 2261 to 2266 for procedures in
capital cases. Orders granting a writ of habeas corpus are not rare; orders granting re-
lief are. A habeas corpus claim is the last grasp for the next-to-the-last straw (execu-
tive clemency being the last), and as such, is a shaky bet. Exhibit 14–10 is a federal
application for habeas corpus.
VIII.
CONCLUSION
Paralegals can accomplish some of their most significant tasks at the point where they
can have the greatest effect for their client. Gathering information and planning sen-
tencing alternatives to meet the needs of retribution, deterrence, and rehabilitation can
be some of the most satisfying tasks you will accomplish. You can help give victims the
opportunity to be a part of the process, to feel that their injuries are significant to soci-
ety; you can help shape the rehabilitation plan to best serve needs of the defendant and
to interrupt the cycle of crime. To do the work efficiently, you must know the require-
ments of applicable statutes and guidelines, pay attention to detail in documenting in-
formation, be intuitive as to the personalities and needs of both the victim and the
defendant, and be creative in surveying possibilities for alternative sentencing. Most
important is the willingness to do the hard work in pulling all these elements together.
The criminal justice system—and your work—continues after sentencing to deal
with rights of convicts and postconviction review. Patience, research, creativity, and
more patience are necessary to see cases through the maze. Appeals and collateral at-
tacks on conviction and sentencing draw criticism for their seemingly endless flogging
of the same issues in an attempt to avoid the inevitable. The extensive appeals processes
that must be exhausted before an execution can take place make for inflammatory head-
lines. Accompanying costs are often cited; it is more expensive to litigate all the appeals
involved in a death penalty than to house a prisoner for life. Many states have not exe-
cuted a prisoner since the post–Furman statutes were written, so death row is crowded
with petitioners, some waiting nearly twenty years for the final resolution of their cases.

Sample Presentence Report
However excessive the multilevel appeals process may seem to an observer, it is the
best guarantee of justice that we have. We recoil at reports from repressive countries of
prisoners being convicted and only minutes later taken into a courtyard and shot to
death. We cry out in sympathy for those American prisoners who are released after years
of incarceration when evidence finally surfaces that they are innocent. We cannot truly
call ours a “justice” system without meticulous provision for the correction of error.
In a world that seems increasingly violent, there is a suspicion that crime is more
successful than punishment, that the criminal justice system is slipping behind in the
battle. Those who work with individual defendants and individual victims know, how-
ever, that it is not one battle. Each case presents its own problems and possibilities for
justice, its own case of real people whose lives are changed at the pounding of a gavel.

CHAPTER 14
PART A.
THE OFFENSE
Charge(s) and Conviction(s)
1. Thaddeus Smith and codefendants Simon Brown and Veronica Pond were named in a five-count indictment
filed by a Western District of Atlantis grand jury on November 30, 2000. Count one charges that from Novem-
ber 1, 2000, until November 30, 2000, the above-named defendants conspired to commit bank robbery, in vi-
olation of 18 U.S.C. § 2113(a) and 18 U.S.C. § 371. Count two charges that on November 16, 2000, Smith,
while armed with a revolver, robbed the Atlantis credit union, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2113(a). Count three
charges that on November 16, 2000, Smith used a firearm in a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C.
§ 924(c). Count four charges that on November 21, 2000, he possessed with intent to distribute a controlled
substance (cocaine), in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1), and Count five charges that on November 16, 2000,
the defendant robbed the Williams Bank, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2113(a).
2. On December 7, 2000, in accordance with the terms of a written [Rule 11(e)(1)(B)] plea agreement, Thaddeus
Smith, pled guilty to a two-count superseding information, charging him with armed bank robbery, in violation
of 18 U.S.C. § 2113(a) and simple possession of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 844(a). The U.S. Attorney
has filed an information charging Smith with a prior drug conviction, enhancing the penalty for this offense, in
accordance with 21 U.S.C. § 851. The terms of the plea agreement call for the dismissal of the original Indict-
ment. Codefendant Brown pled guilty to a one-count superseding information, charging robbery, in violation of
18 U.S.C. § 2113(a). Codefendant Pond pled guilty to a one-count superseding information, charging simple
possession of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 844(a). All of the defendants are scheduled to be sentenced
on February 8, 2001.
The Offense Conduct
3. On November 10, 2000, Thaddeus Smith met with Simon Brown and Brown’s girlfriend, Veronica Pond at a bar
in Breaker Bay. While at the bar, Smith discussed his plans of robbing the Atlantis Credit Union, located at 1948
Edgewater Street, Breaker Bay, Atlantis. Smith explained he had learned that on the following Friday, November
16, 2000, the credit union would have extra money in the safe to cash payroll checks and he planned to rob it on
that date. To establish an alibi, Smith told Brown and Pond that he planned to leave the area for several days to
visit relatives in a neighboring state, but would return to Breaker Bay early Friday morning, rob the credit union,
and fly back to his relatives’ residence before he was missed. He planned to travel using an alias to further avoid
apprehension. Brown and Pond agreed to steal two getaway vehicles for Smith and to assist him in the robbery.
Smith gave the couple a .357 magnum revolver, which he told them he had stolen from a friend’s cabin, and asked
them to leave it in the trunk of the getaway car. Smith promised to pay Brown and Pond $500 each for their help.
4. On November 14, 2000, Brown and Pond stole a 2000 sedan from a Chevrolet dealership in Surf City and, the
following day, the couple stole a 1998 Ford truck from an apartment complex in Surf City. On November 16,
2000, Brown picked Smith up at the airport in the Chevrolet and drove to a nearby shopping mall where Pond
was waiting in the Ford. Brown told Pond to wait while the defendant and Brown drove to the credit union.
5. At approximately 9:30 A.M., before the credit union opened, Smith, disguised with a wig and mustache, and
Brown approached Patty Martinez, a teller, as she was exiting her vehicle. Armed with a revolver, Smith
grabbed the teller’s arm, and escorted her to the rear door of the credit union. Ordering the teller to pretend
that she was alone, Brown told her to knock on the door to the credit union. The teller complied and the man-
ager opened the door. The defendants then forced them back inside, and while pointing the revolver at two
other employees, herded them into a corner near the vault.
6. Smith ordered the manager to open the vault and place five bags of cash into a duffle bag carried by Brown.
Smith then directed the employees to the back of the credit union, ordered them to lie on the floor, placed his
revolver inside his coat, and the two fled the credit union. Smith and Brown proceeded to the Chevrolet and
immediately drove toward the shopping mall where Pond was waiting. En route, Smith threw the revolver into
a vacant lot, later stating that he hoped some kid would find it, get caught, and be blamed for the robbery.

7. Smith and Brown abandoned the Chevrolet in the parking lot and left with Pond in the stolen Ford. While trav-
elling to the airport, Smith changed his shirt and shoes, and threw them, along with his disguise, into a dump-
ster. As Smith began to count the money, Pond was shocked that over $100,000 had been stolen and
demanded $5,000 for herself and Brown. Smith became angry and threatened to keep all of the money if they
continued to complain. At the airport, Smith gave Brown and Pond a total of $1,000, and a small packet of co-
caine as a bonus. Smith then left the couple and flew back to his relatives’ residence that afternoon.
8. As Brown and Pond were driving home in the stolen Ford, they were stopped by the police for a routine traffic
violation. When the police officer discovered the truck was stolen, Brown and Pond were placed under arrest.
Brown and Pond each admitted their involvement in this offense and during questioning implicated Smith.
9. On November 21, 2000, Smith was arrested by Federal agents at his relatives’ home. The agents seized
$78,690, along with 56 grams of cocaine, from Smith’s suitcase. A subsequent laboratory analysis found the
seized cocaine to be 64 percent pure.The revolver, used by Smith in the robbery, has not been recovered, but
was believed to be a .357 Smith & Wesson. Local police have no record of such a theft of a weapon on file. Ac-
cording to Smith, he purchased the weapon from an unknown individual at a gun show held at the Breaker Bay
High School in October 2000.
10. Smith is the most culpable defendant in this case. Smith recruited his codefendants, Brown and Pond, and di-
rected their activities in this offense. In addition, Smith compensated his codefendants for their participation in
the offense with a small share of the bank robbery proceeds.
Victim Impact
11. The Atlantis Credit Union is the primary victim in this offense and sustained direct financial losses totalling
$128,135. The credit union has recovered $78,690 seized from Smith at the time of his arrest, leaving a net
loss of $49,445. According to credit union officials, Apex Insurance Company has reimbursed the credit union
except for a $5,000 deductible. In addition, the credit union paid a total of $900 for Ms. Martinez to receive 12
hours of psychological counseling.
12. Three tellers and the credit union manager are also victims in this offense. The tellers and the manager were
interviewed by the probation officer and provided the following information.
13. Patty Martinez was the teller approached by Smith as she left her car in the credit union parking lot. While she
was not physically injured, she was reportedly emotionally traumatized by the defendant’s conduct. With her
consent, the credit union arranged for Martinez to receive private psychological counseling. After 12 sessions,
Martinez states that she began improving, and was able to sleep at night without nightmares and felt more
comfortable at work. Nevertheless, Martinez decided to resign from the credit union, due in part to the offense,
and has now returned to college to pursue her education.
14. The branch manager and the other two tellers inside the credit union stated that they were not physically in-
jured by the defendant, but each expressed anger toward Smith for assaulting them. Each employee expressed
experiences of being startled by strangers who enter the credit union, but the employees do not believe they
are in need of professional counseling or treatment.
15. The two stolen vehicles in this case have been recovered without damages. A representative from the Chevro-
let dealership was contacted and interviewed by the probation officer and advised that he has subsequently
sold the sedan for $14,000. Similarly, the owner of the Ford truck reported no losses or expenses relative to
the theft of the truck.
Adjustment for Obstruction of Justice
16. The probation officer has no information to suggest that the defendant impeded or obstructed justice.

CHAPTER 14
Adjustment for Acceptance of Responsibility
17. Shortly after his arrest, Smith made voluntary and candid admissions to the authorities concerning his in-
volvement in this offense, including his recruitment of Brown and Pond to help him execute the robbery
scheme. Smith also acknowledged using a weapon during the robbery, which he purchased from an unknown
individual at a gun show. In addition, Smith admitted his possession of cocaine at the time of his arrest, ex-
plaining that he had purchased the narcotics with money stolen from the robbery. The defendant freely admit-
ted his guilt in court at the time of his plea, and appears to fully accept responsibility for his conduct. During
his interview with the probation officer, Smith explained that he committed this offense at the prospect of quick
and easy financial gains, and expressed remorse for assaulting the credit union employees.
Offense Level Computation
18. The 1991 edition of the Guidelines Manual has been used in this case. Pursuant to the provisions found in
U.S.S.G. § 3D1.1(a)(3), counts one and two are unrelated offenses and are treated separately.
Count one—Armed Bank Robbery
19. Base Offense Level: The guideline for a 21 U.S.C. § 2113(a) offense is found in U.S.S.G. § 2B3.1 which pro-
vides that robbery has a base offense level of 20.
20
20. Specific Offense Characteristic: Pursuant to the provision found in U.S.S.G. § 2B3.1 because the property
of a financial institution was taken, the offense level is increased by two levels.
2
21. Specific Offense Characteristic: Pursuant to the provision found in U.S.S.G. § 2B3.1(b)(2)(B) because Smith
used a revolver during the commission of this offense, the offense level is increased by four.
4
22. Specific Offense Characteristic: In preparation for this offense, Smith directed Brown and Pond to steal two
vehicles, valued at a total of $26,000. Smith stole $128,135 from the credit union, thus the total loss attribut-
able to this offense is $154,135. According to the provisions in U.S.S.G. § 2B3.1(b)(6)(B), the offense level is
increased by two levels in accordance with the overall loss in this offense.

23. Victim-Related Adjustment: None
0
24. Adjustment for Role in the Offense: Smith was the organizer and leader in this offense. He provided in-
structions and directives to his codefendants and compensated them for their participation in this offense with
a small share of the robbery proceeds. In accordance with the provisions found in U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(c), the of-
fense level is increased by two.

Offense Behavior Not Part of Relevant Conduct
43. Smith was also charged in an unrelated robbery on November 16, 2000, of Williams Bank in Sun City, Atlantis,
as summarized in count five of the original indictment. Bank surveillance cameras show a suspect, generally
resembling the defendant, as he was approaching a teller, handing her a bag, accompanied by a demand note.
The suspect then left the bank with $1,375 in the bag. While the defendant has declined to discuss this rob-
bery, at the time of his arrest, Federal agents recovered a shirt, pants, and shoes from the defendant’s duffle
bag, matching those of the suspect in the surveillance photographs.

sentence. In accordance with U.S.S.G. § 4A1.1(d), two points are added.
59. The instant offense was commited less than two years following Smith’s release from custody on August 27,
2000. Pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 4A1.1(e), one point is added.
60. The total of the criminal history points is 15. According to the sentencing table (Chapter Five, Part A), 13 or
more criminal history points establish a criminal history category of VI.

in 1990 for possession of marijuana. Probation department records indicated that Smith successfully com-
pleted the diversion program.

PART C. OFFENDER CHARACTERISTICS
Personal and Family Data
65. Thaddeus Smith was born on March 15, 1964, in Breaker Bay, Atlantis, to the union of Samuel and Edith Smith,
nee Barker.The defendant’s parents separated on numerous occasions, and Smith was often left in the care of
his maternal grandmother, who has a history of severe depression. As a consequence, his childhood was
chaotic. According to his juvenile record, Smith ran away from home several times and was eventually placed
in his grandmother’s custody. In 1978 the grandmother committed suicide and Smith discovered her body. He
was returned to his mother’s residence, located in a small housing project on the lower east side of Breaker Bay.
EXHIBIT 14–4 (Continued)
Sample Presentence Report 

Sentencing, Punishment, and Review
■557
66. According to the defendant’s mother, Smith was very respectful in the family home, although he did exhibit re-
curring signs of violence and temper tantrums, which she attributed to her son’s inability to overcome the emo-
tional traumatic experiences associated with the loss of his grandmother. Smith and his grandmother had been
extremely close. After an episode of delinquency, Smith was committed to the Breaker Bay Youth Correctional
Center.
67. Since his release from the youth center, Smith has been residing with distant relatives, with friends, or alone
in a series of small apartments in Breaker Bay. His last contact with his parents was in 1994 at his brother Fred-
erick’s funeral. Since 1997, Smith has lived at 111 Fifth Street, Apartment 2B, Breaker Bay, Atlantis 99993, with
his cousin, Martin Johnson. A recent home investigation found this small, sparsely furnished apartment to be
located in a high-crime section in northwest Breaker Bay. According to the defendant’s cousin Martin Johnson,
Smith rarely stayed in the apartment and did not contribute to their monthly living expenses; however, John-
son would welcome the defendant back into his apartment upon his release because of limited housing alter-
natives available to the defendant at the present time.
Physical Condition
68. Thaddeus Smith is a white male who is 6′2″ tall, and weighs 210 pounds. He has brown eyes and brown shoulder-
length hair. Smith has a surgical scar on his abdomen, and a tattoo of a skull with the motto “Born to Lose” on
his right hand.
69. The defendant describes his overall general physical health as good. He was hospitalized briefly in 1995 for
the repair of a hernia he suffered while working in the Breaker Bay jail laundry.
Mental and Emotional Health
70. Smith indicated that he has never been seen by a psychiatrist and described his overall mental and emotional
health as good. There is no documented evidence to suggest otherwise.
Substance Abuse
71. The defendant describes a history of alcohol and drug abuse which began when he was approximately 10
years old. According to Smith, he stole alcohol from his parents’ supply, adding, “. . . they were drunk so often,
they never noticed.” He stated that he often attended school under the influence of alcohol, and that he has
been intoxicated “too many times to count.”
72. Smith stated that he began smoking marijuana when he was 12 years old.When he discovered that it was eas-
ier to attend school under the influence of marijuana without detection, than under the influence of alcohol, he
became a daily marijuana smoker.The defendant reports the abuse of numerous substances, including hallu-
cinogens, stimulants and depressants, methamphetamine, and cocaine. Smith said he never used opiates.
73. Smith reported he has often been under the influence of some substance when he had committed his crimes.
Before the instant offense, he drank a pint of whisky and inhaled approximately one quarter gram of metham-
phetamine. Smith admitted that he used some of the proceeds from the robbery to purchase cocaine, and said
he used as much as he could acquire since his most recent release from prison. Smith estimates that he has
spent at least $200 each week for methamphetamine, his drug of choice, alcohol, or cocaine. The results of a
urine test, administered by a pretrial services officer at the time of the defendant’s arrest, were positive for
methamphetamine and cocaine.
74. Smith stated that he has been referred to several alcohol and substance abuse programs as a result of his
criminal conduct. In 1990, he participated in a marijuana use and education program as a condition of diver-
sion and in 1992, he underwent drug treatment as a condition of probation. Prison records reflect that, during
his most recent confinement, Smith attended Alcoholics and Narcotics Anonymous sessions regularly, but his
correctional counselors noted that Smith seemed unmotivated and never selected sponsors. The defendant
currently indicates that he would be willing to participate in a drug treatment program and adds that he is now
motivated to address his narcotics dependency.

CHAPTER 14
Educational and Vocational Skills
75. The defendant attended Kennedy High School for Boys in Breaker Bay in 1971, where he received poor grades
and had a poor attendance record. After his commitment to the Breaker Bay Youth Center in 1981, Smith com-
pleted the 11th grade, but center records indicate that he reads at an 8th-grade level. He has no other formal
education or identifiable skills and is in need of remedial educational or vocational training.
Employment
76. Since his release from State custody on August 27, 2000, Smith has been unemployed. He acknowledges he
has made no attempt to actively seek employment and has relied on others for financial assistance.
77. From September 15, 1995, until December 25, 1995, Smith was employed by Sam’s Super-Save Gasoline,
333 Third Avenue, Breaker Bay, as a service station attendant and cashier, earning minimum wages. In addi-
tion, from January 10, 1996, until August 26, 1996, Smith was employed as a mechanic by Al’s Auto Aid, 129
5th Street, Breaker Bay, earning $10.45 per hour, until his commitment to state prison.
78. From July 10, 1991, until July 14, 1995, Smith was employed by Uriah’s Cheap Heaps, 435 Ohio Street, Breaker
Bay. He was first hired as a mechanic, but was later promoted to service manager at this dealership, where he
earned $2,500 per month before he was terminated when the dealership learned of his arrest for stealing cars
from a nearby dealership showroom. Smith’s former employer, Uriah Dickens, advised that he was extremely
disappointed in Smith, whom he hired despite his criminal record. Dickens described Smith as a likable em-
ployee who got along well with others. According to Dickens, hoping that a second chance would encourage
Smith to reform, Dickens allowed Smith to continue in his employ, even after his 1983 conviction for petty theft.
79. From January 10, 1991, until June 9, 1991, Smith was employed by Prestigious Motors, Breaker Bay, where
he worked as a mechanic, earning $9.75 per hour. According to his immediate supervisor, Smith was a knowl-
edgeable mechanic, but was terminated after he was incarcerated for writing bad checks.
80. From October 8, 1984, until September 9, 1990, Smith was employed by the Reliable Transportation Company
in Breaker Bay. He was initially employed as a mechanic, but was promoted to service manager, earning
$2,100 per month. According to available employment records, Smith was terminated after a series of petty
thefts which eventually resulted in his incarceration. According to a company representative, Smith would be
eligible for rehire consideration.

The above expenses reflect essential living expenses necessary for the defendant’s continued employment
and the health and welfare of his family. He has a net worth of $27,900 and liquid assets in the amount of
$13,600. If the defendant is not incarcerated and can maintain employment, he will be able to make a maxi-
mum initial fine payment of $13,600 within 30 days of sentencing. He could also make payments of $100 per
month. If collected for 3 years, the additional fine paid in installments would be $3,600 for a total fine of $17,200
and he could pay the interest on this amount.
If the defendant is confined within the guideline range, some of these assets should be preserved for the sup-
port of his family.
81. Overall, Smith has a sporadic work history, marked by substantial periods of employment. After his release
from the Breaker Bay Youth Corrections Center, he worked sporadically as a mechanic.When unemployed, he
supplemented his income by working on friends’ and acquaintances’ vehicles.
Financial Condition: Ability To Pay
82. Smith has no known identifiable assets or liabilities. While he has no sources of income, Smith claims to have
spent approximately $800 per month for drugs and alcohol. Prior to his arrest in this offense, Smith was living
with his cousin and the defendant provided no financial assistance to the monthly living expenses. The defen-
dant is unemployed and upon his release, he will be dependent upon others for financial assistance. At the pre-
sent time, he does not have the ability to pay a fine.
PART D. SENTENCING OPTIONS

CHAPTER 14
84. Guideline Provisions: Based on an offense level of 28 and a criminal history category of VI, the guideline
range of imprisonment is 140 to 175 months.
Impact of Plea Agreement
85. Had the defendant been convicted of all the charges in the original indictment, the guideline imprisonment
range would be 120 to 150 months, plus a mandatory 60-month minimum term of imprisonment required for
violations of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1).
Supervised Release
86. Statutory Provisions: If a term of imprisonment is imposed on counts one and two, the court may impose a
term of supervised release of not more than three years on count one and not more than one year on count
two, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3583(b)(2) and 18 U.S.C. § 3583(b)(3), since they are Class C and Class E
felonies, respectively. According to 18 U.S.C. § 3624(e), the terms of supervised release shall run concurrently.
87. Guideline Provisions: If the defendant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of more than one year, the
court must impose a term of supervised release, pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 5D1.1. The authorized term of super-
vised release for count one is not less than two years nor more than three years, and the authorized term of
supervised release for count two is one year, pursuant to U.S.S.G. §§ 5D1.2(b)(2) and 5D1.2(b)(3).
Probation
88. Statutory Provisions: The defendant is ineligible for a term of probation in this offense, pursuant to 18 U.S.C.
§ 3561(a)(3) since he must be sentenced to at least a 15-day term of imprisonment on count two.
89. Guideline Provisions: The defendant is ineligible for a term of probation since count one requires a manda-
tory term of imprisonment of 15 days and the minimum guideline imprisonment range exceeds ten months,
pursuant to U.S.S.G. §§ 5B1.1(b)(3) and 5C1.1(f), respectively.
Fines
90. Statutory Provisions: The maximum fine for count one is twice the gross loss, or $308,270, pursuant to 18
U.S.C. § 3571(d). The minimum fine for count two is $2,500, plus the cost of the investigation and prosecution
(unless the defendant does not have the ability to pay), pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 844(a), and the maximum fine
is $250,000, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3571(b).
91. A special assessment of $50 on each count for a total of $100 is mandatory, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3013.
92. Guideline Provisions: Pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 5E1.2(c)(3), the fine range for this offense is from $12,500 to
$125,000.
93. Subject to the defendant’s ability to pay, the court shall impose an additional fine amount that is at least suffi-
cient to pay the costs to the Government of any imprisonment, probation, or supervised release, pursuant to
U.S.S.G. § 5E1.2(i). The most recent advisory from the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts suggests that
a monthly cost of $1,210.05 be used for imprisonment, a monthly cost of $91.66 for supervision, and a monthly
cost of $938.44 for community confinement.
Restitution
94. Statutory Provisions: Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3663, restitution may be ordered. In this case, restitution in the
amount of $5,900 is outstanding to the Atlantis Credit Union and can be forwarded to the following address:
Atlantis Credit Union

96. Guideline Provisions: In accordance with the provisions of section U.S.S.G. § 5E1.1, restitution shall be or-
dered.
Denial of Federal Benefits
(DRUG CASES ONLY)
97. Statutory Provisions: Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 862, upon a second conviction for possession of a controlled
substance, a defendant may be declared ineligible for any or all Federal benefits for up to five years as deter-
mined by the Court. In addition, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 862, the Court may require the defendant to partici-
pate and complete an approved drug treatment program which includes periodic drug testing, or to perform
appropriate community service.
98. Guideline Provisions: Pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 5F1.6, the Court may deny eligibility for certain Federal bene-
fits of any individual convicted of distribution or possession of a controlled substance.
PART E. FACTORS THAT MAY WARRANT DEPARTURE
99. The probation officer has no information concerning the offense or the offender which would warrant a depar-
ture from the prescribed sentencing guidelines.

CHAPTER 14
PART E. FACTORS THAT MAY WARRANT DEPARTURE—SAMPLES
1.
Presentation of information in this section does not necessarily constitute a recommendation by the probation
officer for a departure.
The results of the psychological evaluation indicating that the defendant’s I.Q. tested well below the average
range and close to the borderline retarded range, coupled with the psychologist’s conclusion that the defen-
dant is impressionable and easily influenced by others, suggest that the defendant is not as culpable for the
offense as the average defendant. He is certainly far less culpable than his codefendants. These factors may
be considered for a downward departure within the policy statement at U.S.S.C. § 5K2.13, entitled Diminished
Capacity.This provision provides that if the defendant committed a nonviolent offense while suffering from sig-
nificantly reduced mental capacity not resulting from the use of drugs or other intoxicants, a lower sentence
may be warranted to reflect the extent to which reduced mental capacity contributed to the commission of the
offense.
2.
Presentation of information in this section does not necessarily constitute a recommendation by the probation
officer for a departure.
The guideline at U.S.S.G. § 2D1.8 for managing a drug establishment does not incorporate the unusual secu-
rity measures employed by the defendant in managing the site where the methamphetamine laboratory was
located. The elaborate electronic security system augmented with the constant monitoring of police radio
transmissions at the site are factors that make the planning of this offense unusual.
3.
Presentation of information in this section does not necessarily constitute a recommendation by the probation
officer for a departure.
The fact that the defendant is suffering from AIDS and is bedridden in the final stages of the disease, is a fac-
tor that the court may consider for a departure. The medical reports indicate that the defendant is near death
and it is not anticipated that he will ever be ambulatory again.Treatment at the Bureau of Prisons would be ex-
tremely costly to the government. U.S.S.G. § 5H1.4 provides that physical condition is not ordinarily relevant
in determining whether a sentence should be outside the guideline range. “However, an extraordinary physi-
cal impairment may be a reason to impose a sentence below the applicable guideline range; e.g., in the case
of a seriously infirm defendant, home detention may be as efficient as, and less costly than, imprisonment.”
The defendant’s medical condition may be a consideration for downward departure from a sentence of cus-
tody to a sentence of community confinement with the hospice designated as the place for service of a sen-
tence imposed within the guideline range.
4.
Presentation of information in this section does not necessarily constitute a recommendation by the probation
officer for a departure.
Although two tellers were shot in the instant robbery offense, the guideline for robbery increased the offense
level by 4 levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2B3.1(b)(3)(B) for the serious bodily injury of only one teller. The sec-
ond teller also suffered serious harm from the gunshot wound. Had the second teller been the only victim of
the offense, her wounds would have also resulted in a 4 level increase.

ASSESSMENT:
Justification:
The robbery of the credit union involved extensive planning in the design of the crime, as well as the recruitment
of others to participate in the offense.These factors, as well as Thaddeus Smith’s role in the offense, use of a gun,
and the amount of loss, have been taken into account in determining the guideline range. The defendant has an
extensive criminal record which is reflected in the fact that he is in the highest criminal history category. He ac-
cepts responsibility for his actions and expresses remorse for his actions in the instant case. Because the signif-
icant sentencing considerations, both aggravating and mitigating, have been factored into the application of the
guidelines, a sentence near the middle of the guideline range is merited. Accordingly, a prison sentence of 160
months is recommended which would reflect the seriousness of the offense and meet the sentencing objective of
just punishment.
In the past, when Smith has been subject to community supervision, his overall adjustment has been poor, as ev-
idenced by continued conflicts with the law. He has a history of drug and alcohol abuse and could benefit from in-
tervention and treatment. A three year period of supervised release is recommended for the protection of the public,
as well as for the correctional treatment of the defendant when he is released to the community. Accordingly, a spe-
cial condition for testing and substance abuse treatment is recommended.
In view of the defendant’s inability to pay financial sanctions and his lack of employment stability, it is recommended
that the fine be waived. However, in light of his expected lengthy jail sentence, it is recommended that the defen-
dant be ordered to make restitution immediately to the Atlantis Credit Union in the amount of $5,900 and to the
Apex Insurance Company in the amount of $44,445. The Federal Bureau of Prisons has a voluntary Inmate Fi-
nancial Responsibility Program, and while incarcerated, if employed, Smith can begin immediate payment toward
his restitution obligation.

■
CHAPTER 14
Although the court may deny any or all Federal benefits for up to five years because count two is the defendant’s
second conviction for possession of a controlled substance, denial of Federal benefits is not recommended. If the
court imposes a custodial sentence within the guideline range, the period for ineligibility for benefits would expire
before the defendant’s release from custody.
Voluntary Surrender:
Smith is subject to a substantial period of incarceration in this offense and he has been detained without bail since
his arrest. Although he has family members in the community, his regular contact with them has been sporadic. As
a result, the defendant does not appear to be a good candidate for voluntary surrender.

MOTION FOR PROBATION WITH AN ALTERNATIVE SENTENCE
STATE OF COLUMBIA
CAPITOL DISTRICT COURT
V.
CASE NO. _____
BILLY MCINTIRE
Comes the defendant, Billy McIntire, by his counsel, and respectfully moves that this Court grant him probation
with an alternative sentence. In support of his motion, the following is noted:
1. On March 13, _____ , Billy McIntire entered pleas of guilty to the offenses of Driving Under the Influence, 4th
Offense, Driving with a Suspended Operator’s License, and Disregarding a Traffic Control Device. The Common-
wealth is recommending a sentence of one year on the DUI charge and a concurrent 90-day sentence on the Sus-
pended License charge.
2. This Court’s decision whether or not to grant probation is obviously a critical one in the life of Billy McIntire. It
is obvious that Billy has a profound and long-standing alcohol abuse problem.The most successful method of deal-
ing with this problem is through treatment. A treatment plan to address this problem is fully outlined in the attached
alternative sentencing plan, and is incorporated by reference.
3.This plan calls for Billy to spend 120 days in jail as a condition of probation. Billy has already served 14 of these
days. During the remainder of his sentence, he will be able to engage in intensive alcohol counseling. He will be
able to continue his military commitments to the National Guard. While he is being punished, his time will be spent
productively.
4. Billy fully appreciates that this Court could take the attitude that given the community’s feelings toward multi-
ple offender drunk drivers that it would be very easy for this Court to deny probation. However, before the Court
should rush to that judgment, pragmatism requires that we examine what effect this would have in reducing the like-
lihood of repeat offenses. Without adequate treatment there is always the possibility of another offense. Given the
one-year sentence recommended by the prosecution, would denial of probation and a prison term ensure public
safety? The defense submits that it would not. If Billy were to be sentenced to a one-year term, he would be eligi-
ble for parole in a period of four (4) months. Given his general lack of record, while parole is not in any sense a cer-
tainty, it is not an unreasonable expectation. Billy has already served 14 days of this 4-month term. It is reasonably
anticipated he would spend around 10 to 14 days in the county jail awaiting transfer to the Correctional Center for
classification. This classification process normally takes about a month. As the center is not, for these purposes, a
treatment center, little if any chance is available for formal, structured alcohol treatment. It would only be upon a
transfer to the general prison population that Billy could even begin to sign up for such a program, a program which
would not be of the same intensive, individualized nature as that proposed by this alternative plan.Thus, Billy could
be more than half way to parole eligibility before he could even sign up for treatment. It is entirely possible that Billy
could be paroled without ever having had an opportunity for counseling or treatment. Counsel respectfully suggests
that this method does not solve the problem; it merely delays it.
5. However, if this Court were to grant probation with alternative sentencing, Billy would serve these same 4
months while undergoing intensive, individualized treatment. If he fails at any step during these 4 months, the prison
option is still there. This method not only addresses the real problem, it addresses it in a timely, responsible way.
6. If probation is denied, Billy will be released from all forms of supervision after a period of about nine months,
the presumptive date of his minimum eligibility. At that point, he would be under no restraints. However, if probation
is granted, Billy would be under the control and jurisdiction of this Court for up to five (5) years. As alcohol treat-
ment and rehabilitation is a long-term process, probation with an alternative sentence would, pragmatically, seem
to be the method to best secure the public safety, as well as allowing Billy to rebuild a productive life.
WHEREFORE, the defendant, Billy McIntire, by his counsel, respectfully moves this Court to grant him proba-
tion and to structure an alternative sentence.

Case No. _____
Dear Judge Martin:
The following is an individualized Alternative Sentencing Plan prepared on behalf of Billy McIntire. Mr. McIntire’s at-
torney requested the Alternative Sentencing Unit’s assistance in developing a highly structured sentencing pro-
posal for the Court’s review.
As a Sentencing Specialist, I have worked with Mr. McIntire and his attorney in constructing the sentencing alter-
natives. In doing so, I have attempted to combine the goals of sentencing with the individual aspects of Mr. McIn-
tire’s situation. With this incorporation in mind, we believe that treatment under the guidelines of supervised
probation with the attached plan, after serving a 120-day mandatory sentence, will better serve the interests of all
concerned parties. Should you have any questions concerning this plan, a Sentencing Specialist will be available
to the Court at the time of Mr. McIntire’s sentencing.
Thank you for your consideration of this proposal.
Sincerely,
Alternative Sentencing Specialist

F. Conclusion
The proposal presented here has been designed to provide the Court with an alternative to incarceration
for Billy McIntire. Mr. McIntire is not a person who is habituated to a criminal lifestyle, except for a recur-
rent drinking and driving problem. He has no criminal charges against him except those related to alco-
holism. Nevertheless, because of his abuse of alcohol, Mr. McIntire has acted in an irresponsible manner.
To assist him in addressing the case at hand, we have designed the above conditions which will also meet
the goals of sentencing. Several of the recommendations serve more than one goal.
The goals of punishment are accomplished by the fourteen days already served in jail, the one hundred
and six days still to be served at the community corrections center, the supervised probationary period,
the $25.00 per year to M.A.D.D., the hours volunteered to the community, and the inevitability of serving
the rest of his sentence in prison if he fails to meet the conditions of this plan.
The goals of treatment are attained by Mr. McIntire’s participation in several different classes and groups
while in a chemical dependency program for at least one year, participation in A.A. meetings, abiding by
the aftercare recommendations, and submitting to random alcohol and drug testing.
The goals of restitution are achieved through Mr. McIntire’s payment for his treatment and counseling, his
hours volunteered to the community, his payment of fees, and the $25.00 per year to M.A.D.D.
The goals of deterrence, which will help maintain community safety, are met by additional incarceration at the
community corrections center, undergoing supervised probation, completing a year-long substance abuse pro-
gram, paying for that program, paying for his additional incarceration, attending A.A. meetings, fulfilling his
monthly National Guard Duty, volunteering time to the community, maintaining full-time employment, being ran-
domly tested for drugs and alcohol, donating $25.00 per year to M.A.D.D., and having the knowledge that his
failure to comply with any of the conditions of this plan or his probation will mean the revocation of his probation.

CHAPTER 14
III.
SOCIAL HISTORY
Billy McIntire is before the Court on his fourth conviction of Driving Under the Influence within five years, Dri-
ving on a Suspended License, and Disregarding a Traffic Control Device.
Billy was born on July 18, 1971, to Susan and Andrew McIntire. He is the oldest of three sons born to
the McIntires. Billy’s early childhood was fairly normal until he was eleven, when his father was killed. Soon
thereafter, Billy went to live with his grandparents.
Although Billy was not a student who made good grades in school, he did stick with it and graduated with
his class in 1989 from Legalville High School. After high school, Billy got a job with Dawn Industries. Recently
he was not sure what he wanted to do. Billy eventually decided upon a career in computers and enrolled at
Capitol Community College in their Computer Programming course.
Billy wanted to expand his career opportunities. Therefore, he joined the Army National Guard. Not only
does the Guard give Billy some job skills, it will also pay for further education. Billy realizes he needs more
education and plans to finish his coursework in the computer field. In 1993 Billy married Jodie Aikens. They
have three children.
Concerning the charges at hand, Billy had been partying with friends and was attempting to go home
when he was pulled over. He realizes it was wrong to attempt to drive. The incident also helped Billy to see
that he has a problem with alcohol abuse which he minimized before. Billy wants to get the treatment he
needs so that this behavior stops before someone is injured. Billy’s brothers agree that he needs help be-
cause they cannot identify with the irresponsibility of drinking and driving as they have never been in any le-
gal trouble. In fact, if not for Billy’s periodic alcohol abuse, he would not have a criminal record.

VERIFICATION/AGREEMENT
The Alternative Sentencing Specialist has thoroughly discussed this Alternative Sentencing Plan with me and
I am aware that contingent on this plan’s acceptance, any noncompliance with the components as adopted
by the Court, could result in probation revocation and a possible prison sentence.

dies with respect to them. However, you should raise in this petition all available grounds (relating to this con-
viction) on which you base your allegations that you are being held in custody unlawfully.
Do not check any of these listed grounds. If you select one or more of these grounds for relief, you must al-
lege facts. The petition will be returned to you if you merely check (a) through (j) or any one of these grounds.
(a) Conviction obtained by plea of guilty which was unlawfully induced or not made voluntarily with un-
derstanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea.
(b) Conviction obtained by use of coerced confession.
(c)
Conviction obtained by use of evidence gained pursuant to an unconstitutional search and seizure.
(d) Conviction obtained by use of evidence obtained pursuant to an unlawful arrest.
(e) Conviction obtained by a violation of the privilege against self-incrimination.
(f)
Conviction obtained by the unconstitutional failure of the prosecution to disclose to the defendant 
evidence favorable to the defendant.
(g) Conviction obtained by a violation of the protection against double jeopardy.
(h) Conviction obtained by action of a grand or petit jury which was unconstitutionally selected and 
impaneled.

Petitioner’s Response as to Why His Petition Should
Not Be Barred Under Rule 9
Explanation and Instructions—Read Carefully
(I)
Rule 9. Delayed or successive petitions
(a) Delayed petitions. A petition may be dismissed if it appears that the state of which the respondent is an
officer has been prejudiced in its ability to respond to the petition by delay in its filing unless the petitioner shows
that it is based on grounds of which he could not have had knowledge by the exercise of reasonable diligence be-
fore the circumstances prejudicial to the state occurred.
(b) Successive petitions. A second or successive petition may be dismissed if the judge finds that it fails to
allege new or different grounds for relief and the prior determination was on the merits or, if new and different
grounds are alleged, the judge finds that the failure of the petitioner to assert those grounds in a prior petition con-
stituted an abuse of the writ.
(II)
Your petition for habeas corpus has been found to be subject to dismissal under rule 9( ) for the following rea-
son(s):

This form has been sent so that you may explain why your petition contains the defect(s) noted in (II) above.

All questions must be answered concisely in the proper space on the form.
(VI) Additional pages are not permitted except with respect to the facts which you rely upon in item 4 or 5 in the
response. Any citation of authorities should be kept to an absolute minimum and is only appropriate if there
has been a change in the law since the judgment you are attacking was rendered.
(VII) Respond to 4 or 5 below, not to both, unless (II) above indicates that you must answer both sections.

4.
If your petition is in jeopardy because of delay prejudicial to the state under rule 9(a), explain why you feel the
delay has not been prejudicial and/or why the delay is excusable under the terms of 9(a).This should be done
by relying upon FACTS, not your opinions or conclusions.
5.
If your petition is in jeopardy under rule 9(b) because it asserts the same grounds as a previous petition, ex-
plain why you feel it deserves a reconsideration. If its fault under rule 9(b) is that it asserts new grounds which
should have been included in a prior petition, explain why you are raising these grounds now rather than pre-
viously.Your explanation should rely on FACTS, not your opinions or conclusions.

1.
A prisoner who was sexually harassed by guards and other inmates
throughout her one-year sentence claimed that she had been subjected to
cruel and unusual punishment. The harassment was verbal; the prisoner
had not been touched offensively. Had her Eighth Amendment rights been
violated? See U.S. v. Sanchez (U.S. Armed Forces 2000).
2.
A defendant was not allowed to speak at his sentencing hearing to respond
to the mention of a letter from the father of one of the victims. The
defendant was represented by counsel. Were his rights violated? See
Boardman v. Estelle, 957 F.2d 1523 (9th Cir. 1992).
3.
Conditions of probation included that the probationer not use intoxicants
to excess and that he comply with the instructions of the probation officer.
The officer required the probationer to submit to urinalysis; the
probationer refused. Is this refusal grounds for revocation? See Paterson v.
State, 612 So.2d 692 (Fla. App. 1993).
