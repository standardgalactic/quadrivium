Foreword      xiii
Foreword
Y
our people are out there. Waiting for you. Whether you want to podcast 
about pop culture, marketing, bass fishing, or vintage wooden button 
­collecting, you will find an audience if you stick with it and produce a 
­quality show by following the advice in this book. The audience is probably bigger 
for a marketing podcast than a vintage wooden button collecting podcast, but you 
never know — there’s probably less competition for the button collectors.
When the Sirens lure you to the dangerous waters of obsessing over your listener 
stats, imagine your listeners all sitting together in one auditorium. Listening to 
you. It’s probably more people than your voice has ever reached in your whole life 
(unless you’re a professor teaching a freshman weed-out class). It’s amazing and 
a little frightening, and there’s nothing like the thrill of getting your first message 
from a listener in China, New Zealand, the Philippines, Egypt, or some other 
­distant land you’ve never seen.
There’s something especially intimate about the listening experience too. Listen-
ers imagine what you look like and where you are, and it’s usually better than the 
reality. They feel like they know you because in their imagination, they have 
­created you.
Now, instead of thinking of them as your audience, think of them as your com-
munity. Ask them what they want. Ask them what they like (and what they don’t 
like). Feature them on your show.
Go beyond the microphone and make things for your listeners, and let them make 
things for you. Meet them in person, and once they get over the disappointment 
that you aren’t the perfect person they’ve imagined (it happens quickly), your 
lives will be enriched. If you want it to be, a podcast is a magical gateway to a 
community.
When people start asking questions about podcasting, it’s usually about the 
equipment. What microphone should they use? What software is best? Do they 
need a mixer? Tee and Chuck will answer these questions, of course, but they’ll 
also address the bigger and more important questions — the questions you don’t 
even know you should be asking, but that will make the difference between a good 
podcast and a fabulous podcast that you’ll look forward to producing and that will 
become part of your listeners’ regular media diet.

xiv      Podcasting For Dummies
I used to tell students and conference attendees that the online world is so  
crowded — filled with so many people vying for attention — that you need to be 
relentless because nobody will miss you if you stop posting or publishing, but 
I  was wrong. Podcasting is different. On the rare occasion when I have (gasp) 
accidentally released my show late, people have pinged me. They have checked to 
make sure I’m okay. They are my people. A community.
Lots of people start podcasting, and many continue, but for a few people it becomes 
a lifestyle, a job, or even a small addiction. “I’ll start just one more,” they think. 
Tee and Chuck have been podcasting for more than a decade and literally wrote 
the book on podcasting. You will benefit from their years of experience.

Introduction
M
aybe you’ve been casually surfing the web or perusing your newspaper 
when the word podcasting has popped up. You’ve heard the word before, 
but lately, it’s been coming up again and again. Podcasting. Steadily, like 
a building wave that would make champion surfers salivate with delight, your 
curiosity continues to pique as the word podcasting echoes in your ears and remains 
in the back of your mind as a riddle wrapped in an enigma, super-sized with a side 
of fries and a diet soda to go.
Podcasting For Dummies, 3rd Edition, is the answer to that super-sized riddle-
enigma combo, and it even comes complete with a special prize. Beginning with 
the question at the forefront of your mind — What is podcasting? — this book takes 
you through the fastest-growing technological movement on the Internet. By the 
time you reach the end of this book, the basics will be in place to get you, your 
voice, and your message heard around the world — and you can even have a bit of 
fun along the way.
About This Book
“So what are you up to, Tee?”
“I’m currently making a podcast of my first novel, a swashbuckling tale that carries our 
heroes . . .”
“Uh . . . what’s a podcast?”
Asked by best friends and lifetime technologists, this question continues to crop 
up over and over again, immediately after the word podcast lands in a casual con-
versation. Just the word podcasting carries an air of geekiness about it  — and 
behold, the habitual technophobes suddenly clasp their hands to their ears and 
run away screaming in horror lest they confront yet another technical matter. Too 
bad. If they only knew how technical it really isn’t. When you peel back the covers 
and fancy-schmancy tech-talk, it’s a pretty simple process to make your own 
podcast. You just need someone pointing the way and illuminating your path.

2      Podcasting For Dummies
This is why we’re here: to be that candle in the dark, helping you navigate a world 
where anyone can do anything, provided people have the tools, the drive, and the 
passion. You don’t need to be a techno-wizard or a super-geek — you need no 
wad of tape holding your glasses together, and your shirt tail need not stick out 
from your fly. Anyone can do what we show you in this book, and often more than 
not people do. Anyone can take a thought or an opinion, make an audio or video 
file expressing that opinion, and distribute this idea worldwide. Anyone can cap-
ture the attention of a few hundred — or a few thousand — people around the 
world through mobile devices or smartphones, strapped around biceps, jouncing 
in pockets, or hooked up to car stereos.
Anyone can podcast.
Podcasting, from recording to online hosting, can be done on a variety of budgets, 
ranging from frugal to Fortune 500. You can podcast about literally anything — 
including podcasting for its own sake. As blogging gave the anonymous, the 
famous, the almost-famous, and the used-to-be famous a voice in politics, reli-
gion, and everyday life, podcasting adds volume and tone to that voice.
Podcasting is many things to many people — but at its most basic, it’s a surpris-
ingly simple and powerful technology. What it means boils down to a single per-
son: you. Some have likened it to online radio but it can do — and be — so much 
more. Podcasting is communication on a global platform, transmitting your voice 
and its message around the world without using public airwaves. It is connecting 
to the Global Village in ways that the creators of the Internet, RSS, and MP3 com-
pression would probably never have dreamed. It is the unique and the hard-to- 
find content that can’t find a place on commercial, college, or public access radio; 
but sometimes when a chord is struck, podcasts go beyond their humble 
beginnings.
You’re about to embark on an exciting adventure into undiscovered territory, and 
here you will find out that podcasting is all these things and so much more.
How to Use This Book
Podcasting For Dummies, 3rd Edition, should be these things to all who pick up and 
read it (whether straight through or by jumping around in the chapters):
»
» A user-friendly guide in how to listen, produce, and distribute podcasts
»
» A terrific reference for choosing the right hardware and software to put 
together a sharp-sounding podcast

Introduction      3
»
» The starting point for the person who knows nothing about audio editing, 
recording, managing RSS feeds, hosting blogs, or how to turn a computer into 
a recording studio
»
» A handy go-to “think tank” for any beginning podcaster who’s hungry for new 
ideas on what goes into a good podcast and fresh points of view
»
» A really fun read
There will be plenty of answers in these pages, and if you find our answers too 
elementary, we give you plenty of points of reference to research. We don’t claim 
to have all the solutions, quick fixes, and resolutions to all possible podcasting 
queries, but we do present to you the basic building blocks and first steps for 
beginning a podcast. As with any For Dummies book, our responsibility is to give 
you the foundation on which to build. That’s what we’ve done our level best to 
accomplish: Bestow upon you the enchanted stuff that makes a podcast happen.
This book was written as a linear path from the conceptualization stages to the final 
publication of your work. However, not everyone needs to read the book from page 
one. If you’ve already gotten your feet wet with the various aspects of podcasting, 
jump around from section to section and read the parts that you need. We provide 
plenty of guides back to other relevant chapters for when the going gets murky.
Conventions Used in This Book
When you go through this book, you’re going to see a few ⌘   symbols, the  
occasional  ➪   , and even a few things typed in a completely different style. 
There’s a method to this madness, and those methods are conventions found 
throughout this book.
When we refer to keyboard shortcuts for Macintosh or Windows, we designate 
them with (Mac) or (Windows). For Mac shortcuts, we use the “Command” sym-
bol (that funky cloverleaf symbol found on the “Command” key) and the corre-
sponding letter. For Windows shortcuts, we use the abbreviation for the Control 
key (Ctrl) and the corresponding letter. So the shortcut for Select All looks like 
this: ⌘  +A (Mac) / Ctrl+A (Windows).
If keyboard shortcuts aren’t your thing and you want to know where the com-
mands reside on menus, we use a command arrow ( ➪   ) to help guide you through 
menus and submenus. So, the command for Select All in the application’s menu is 
Edit ➪   Select All. You first select the Edit menu and then Select All.

4      Podcasting For Dummies
When we offer URLs (web addresses) of various podcasts, resources, and audio 
equipment vendors, or when we have you creating RSS feeds for podcast clients, 
also known as “podcatchers” such as iTunes, Downcast, or Juice, we use this 
particular typeface.
Bold Assumptions
We assume that you have a computer, a lot of curiosity, and a desire to podcast. 
We couldn’t care less about whether you’re using a Mac, a PC, Linux, Unix, or two 
Dixie cups connected with string. (Okay, maybe the two Dixie cups connected with 
string would be a challenge; a computer is essential.) In podcasting, the operating 
system just makes the computer go. We’re here to provide you tools for creating a 
podcast, regardless of what OS you’re running.
If you know nothing about audio or video production, this book can also serve as 
a fine primer in how to record, edit, and produce media on your computer, as well 
as accessorize your computer with mixing boards, professional-grade micro-
phones, and media production software that will give you a basic look at this 
creative field. You can hang on to this book as a handy reference, geared primarily 
for audio, though we do include some information on video, in podcasting. Again, 
our book is a starting point, and (ahem) a fine starting point at that.
With everything that goes into podcasting, there are some things this book is not 
now, nor will ever be, about. Here’s the short list:
»
» We’re not out to make you into an übergeek in RSS or XML (but we give you all 
you need to make things work).
»
» We figure that if you get hold of Audacity, GarageBand, iMovie, Final Cut Pro X, 
or Premiere, you can take it from there (but we give you overviews of those 
programs and a few basic editing examples).
»
» We’re not out to teach you how to use an MP3 player, smartphone, or tablet. 
That’s a prerequisite for this book.
For that matter, to dispel one of the biggest misconceptions of podcasting, you 
will not be told to run out and get an iPod. You do not need an iPod to podcast — or to 
listen to podcasts for that matter.
If you are looking for a terrific start to the podcasting experience, then — in the 
words of the last knight guarding the Holy Grail in Indiana Jones and the Last  
Crusade — “You have chosen wisely.”

Introduction      5
How This Book Is Organized
The following sections give you a quick overview of what this book has to offer. 
And yeah, we’re going to keep the overview brief because we figure you’re eager 
to get started. But the fact that you’re reading this passage also tells us you don’t 
want to miss a detail, so here’s a quick bird’s-eye view of what we do in Podcasting 
For Dummies.
Part 1: Podcasting on a  
Worldwide Frequency
Part 1 goes into the bare-bones basics of how a podcast happens, how to get pod-
casts from the Internet to your computer, and how to host a podcast yourself — 
ending up with a few places online that offer podcast feeds you can visit to sample 
the experience and (later on) to let the world know “Hey, I’ve got a podcast, too!”
Part 1 also helps you pick out the best hardware and software you need to start 
podcasting.
Part 2: The Hills Are Alive with  
the Sound of Podcasting
Consider this part of the book Inside the Actor’s Studio — part TWiT, and part WKRP 
(with your host, Dr. Johnny Fever . . . boooouuugaaar!!!). This is where we offer 
some techniques the pros use in broadcasting. Podcasting may be the grass-roots 
movement of homespun telecommunications, but that doesn’t mean it has to 
sound that way (unless, of course, you want it to sound that way). From preshow 
prep to setting your volume levels to the basics of audio editing, this is the part 
that polishes your podcast.
Part 3: So You’ve Got This Great Recording 
of Your Voice. Now What?
The audio file you’ve just created is now silently staring at you from your monitor 
(unless you’re listening to it on your computer’s music player, in which case it’s 
just defiantly talking back at you!), and you haven’t a clue what your next step is. 
We cover the last-minute details and then walk you through the process of getting 
your podcast online, finding the right web-hosting packages for podcasts, and 
getting a good working handle on the RSS and XML used in podcast feeds.

6      Podcasting For Dummies
Part 4: Start Spreadin’ the  
News about Your Podcast
“I wanna beeee a part of it. Podcasting, babeeeee . . . 
If I can get on Daily Source, 
Then I’ll have no remorse for pod—cast—in . . . podcasting . . .”
Sorry. Sinatra moment.
Anyway, you have the podcast recorded, edited, and online, but now you need to 
let people know you have this great podcast just waiting for them — and that’s 
what we explore in Part 4. With the power of publicity — from free-of-charge 
word-of-mouth (arguably the most effective) to investment in Facebook Ads, you 
have a wide array of options to choose from when you’re ready to announce your 
presence to the podcasting community.
Part 5: Pod-sibilities to  
Consider for Your Show
The question of why one should podcast is as important as how to podcast. We 
cover some basic rationales that many folks have for sitting behind a microphone, 
pouring heart, soul, and pocket change into their craft each and every day, week, 
or month. What is the endgame? Sponsorship? Patreon? Or just for the love of it? 
These questions have no right or wrong answers, but our hope is that this part 
offers pointers to convey you safely through the thought process behind 
podcasting.
Part 6: The Part of Tens
Perhaps the toughest chapters to write were these: the For Dummies trademark 
Part of Tens chapters. So don’t skip them because we’ll be über-miffed if you fail 
to appreciate how hard we busted our humps to get these chapters done!
Right — so what do we give you in our Part of Tens? We give you a list of the most 
influential people in podcasting, some of them still podcasting to this day. We also 
offer suggestions for the beginning podcaster — such as what kind of podcasts 
should be on your MP3 player, just to give you an idea of what’s out there, how 
they sound, and how you can benefit from them. And we wrap it all up with a list 
of reasons why you should podcast — we’re sure you’ll find something that reso-
nates with you.

Introduction      7
Icons Used in This Book
So you’re trekking through the book, making some real progress with developing 
your podcast, when suddenly these little icons leap out, grab you by the throat, 
and wrestle you to the ground. (Who would have thought podcasting was so 
action-packed, like a Daniel Craig-Bond movie, huh?) What do all these little 
drawings mean? Glad you asked.
When we’re in the middle of a discussion and suddenly we have one of those “Say, 
that reminds me . . .” moments, we give you one of these tips. They’re handy little 
extras that are good to know and might even make your podcast sound a little 
tighter than average.
If the moment is more than a handy little nugget of information and closer to a 
“Seriously, you can’t forget this part!” factoid, we mark it with a Remember icon. 
You’re going to want to play close attention to these puppies.
Sometimes we interrupt our train of thought with a “Time out, Sparky .  .  .” 
moment — and this is where we ask for your completely undivided attention. The 
Warnings are exactly that: flashing lights, ah-ooga horns, dire portents. They’re 
reminders not to try this at home because you’ll definitely regret it.
These icons illuminate the “So how does this widget really work . . .?” moments you 
may have as you read this book. The Technical Stuff icons give you a deeper under-
standing of what the wizard is doing behind the curtain, making you all the more 
apt as a podcaster. But if you want to skip the nitty-gritty details, that’s perfectly 
fine, too.

Where to Go from Here
At this point, many For Dummies authors say something snappy, clever, or even a 
bit snarky. We save our best tongue-and-cheek material for the pages inside, so 
here’s a more serious approach.
We suggest heading to where you’re planning to record your podcast, or just plant 
yourself in front of a computer, and start with Chapter 1, where you’re given a few 
links to check out, some suggestions on applications for downloading podcasts, 
and directories to look up where you can find Tee’s and Chuck’s (many) podcasts, 
and other podcasts that can educate, inspire, and enlighten your ears with original 
content.
Where do we go from here? Up and out, friends. Up and out . . .

Getting the Scoop 
on Podcasting
S
ometimes the invention that makes the biggest impact on our daily lives 
isn’t an invention at all, but the convergence of existing technologies, 
­processes, and ideas. Podcasting may be the perfect example of that 
­principle  — and it’s changing the relationship people have with their radios, 
music collections, books, education, and more.
The podcasting movement is actually a spinoff of another communications boom: 
blogs. Blogs sprang up right and left, providing non-programmers and designers 
a clean, elegant interface that left many on the technology side wondering why 
they hadn’t thought of it sooner. Everyday people could chronicle their lives, 
hopes, dreams, and fears, and show them to anyone who cared to read. And oddly 
enough, people did care to read — and still do.
Then in 2003, former MTV VeeJay Adam Curry started collaborating with 
­programmer Dave Winer about his enhancement to RSS (which stands for Really 
Simple Syndication) that not only allowed you to share text and images, but media 
attachments which included compressed audio and video files. Soon after, Curry 
released his first podcast catching client. Thus, the Age of Podcasting began.
Podcasting combines the instant information exchange of blogging with audio and 
video files that can be played on a computer or portable media device. When you 

12      PART 1  Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency
make your podcast publicly available on the Internet, you are exposing your craft 
to anyone with a computer or mobile device and a connection capable of streaming 
data. To put that in perspective, some online sources report the global online pop-
ulation is over 3.4 billion users. In the U.S. alone, more than 198 million people 
own a podcast-ready device, and every one of them can play your content!
This chapter is for the consumers of the content (the audience) and those who 
make the content (the podcasters) alike. We cover the basic steps to record a pod-
cast and lay out the basics of what you need to do to enjoy a podcast on your media 
player.
If you’re starting to get the idea that podcasting is revolutionary, groundbreaking, 
and possibly a major component of social upheaval, great. Truth is, some have 
made their marks in society. But not all podcasts are so deep. In fact, many of 
them are passion projects inviting you to join in on the experience!
Throughout the book, we discuss audio and video podcasts. Don’t be alarmed 
when we refer to the audience as listeners. We’re not leaving out viewers inten-
tionally. It’s a bit like that gender-neutral pronoun for he/she. Unless otherwise 
stated, the information we provide is applicable to audio and video productions.
Deciding Whether Podcasting Is for You
Technically speaking, podcasting is the distribution of specially encoded multime-
dia content to subscribed devices via the RSS 2.0 protocol. Whew! Allow us to 
translate that into common-speak:
Podcasting allows you to listen to stuff you want to hear, or watch stuff you want to 
see, whenever and wherever you want.
Podcasting turns the tables on broadcast schedules, allowing the listener to choose 
not only what to listen to, but also when — often referred to as time-shifted media. 
And because podcasts are transferred via the Internet, the power to create an 
audio program isn’t limited to those with access to a radio transmitter.
The simplest reason to podcast is that it’s just plain fun! We’ve been podcasting 
since the beginning, and we’re still having a blast, continuing to get out messages 
to our worldwide audiences and challenging ourselves with new tricks and tech-
niques in creating captivating media. So, yeah, for the fun of it? Heck of a good 
reason.
The following sections cover other reasons podcasting is probably for you.

CHAPTER 1  Getting the Scoop on Podcasting      13
You want to deliver media content  
on a regular basis
Sure, you can include audio, video, and PDFs content in your blog if you have one. 
Many bloggers record special media segments and insert them as links into the 
text of their blogposts. Readers then download the files at their leisure. However, 
this approach requires manual selection of the content blog hosts want readers to 
download. What sets podcasting apart from blogging is that podcasting automates 
that process. A listener who subscribes to your podcast is subscribed to all your 
content, whenever it’s available. No need to go back to the site to see what’s new! 
Once you subscribe to a podcast, the content is delivered to you in the same way 
as when you subscribe to a print magazine. New content, delivered to you.
You want to reach beyond the boundaries 
of broadcast media
In radio, unless it is satellite radio, the number of people who can listen to a show 
is limited by the power of the transmitter pumping out the signal. Same thing with 
broadcast television, depending if you are using antenna, cable, or satellite dish to 
receive programming. Podcasting doesn’t rely on or utilize signals, transmitters, or 
receivers — at least not in the classic sense. Podcasts use the Internet as a ­delivery 
system, opening up a potential audience that could extend to the entire planet.
WHAT’S IN A NAME, WHEN THE  
NAME IS PODCASTING?
As with most items that make their way into the conventional lexicon of speech, the pre­
cise origins and meaning behind podcasting are somewhat clouded. Although the 
domain podcast.com was originally registered back in 2002 (nothing was ever done 
with it, as far as we know), and Ben Hammersley suggested that and many other terms 
in February 2004 (www.guardian.co.uk/media/2004/feb/12/broadcasting. 
digitalmedia), it’s generally accepted in the podcast community that the first person 
to use the term as a reference to the activity we now know as podcasting was Dannie 
Gregoire on September 15, 2004 (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ipodder-dev/
message/41). Although some assert the name has connotations to Apple’s popular 
iPod, Dannie didn’t have that in mind when the phrase was coined. Regardless of the 
intentions, the term has been backronymed (that is, treated like an acronym and applied 
to a variety of plausible existing meanings). We’ve heard possibilities like Portable 
On-Demand casting, Netcasting, and several other similar attempts. Like the practice of 
podcasting, exact definitions don’t seem to really matter as much as the spirit of what 
you are doing.

14      PART 1  Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency
No rules exist (not yet, anyway) to regulate the creation of podcast content. In 
fact, neither the FCC nor any other regulatory body for any other government 
holds jurisdiction over podcasts. If that seems astounding, remember that pod-
casters are not using the public airwaves to deliver the message.
Just because the FCC doesn’t have jurisdiction, you’re not exempt from the law 
or — perhaps more important — immune to lawsuits. You’re personally responsible 
for anything you say, do, or condone on your show. Additionally, the rules concerning 
airplay of licensed music, the distribution of copyrighted material, and the legali-
ties of recording conversations all apply. Pay close attention to the relevant 
­sections in Chapter 5 to avoid some serious consequences. When it comes to the 
legalities, ignorance is not bliss.
You have something to say
Generally, podcasters produce content that likely holds appeal for only a select 
audience. Podcasts start with an idea, something that you have the desire and 
knowledge, either real or imaginary, to talk about. Add to that a bit of drive, do- 
it-yourself-ishness, and an inability to take no for an answer. The point is to say 
what you want to say, to those who want to hear it.
Podcasts can be about anything and be enjoyed by just about anyone. The topics 
covered don’t have to be earth-shattering or life-changing. They can be about 
do-it-yourself projects, sound-seeing tours of places you visit, or even your 
favorite board games. There are a few rules and guidelines in common practice, 
but there may be times when you find it necessary to bend the rules. (That can be 
a lot of fun in and of itself!)
Some of the most popular podcasts are created by everyday people who sit in front 
of their computers for a few nights a week and just speak their minds, hearts, and 
souls. Some are focused on niche topics; others are more broad-based.
You want to hear from your listeners
Something that is a real perk with podcasting: accessibility. On average, most 
audiences have a direct line of contact between themselves and the podcast’s host 
or hosts. Podcast consumers are more likely to provide feedback for what they 
listen or watch than for a favorite radio or television show. That’s probably trace-
able to the personal nature of a podcast. Podcasts offer their audiences — and 
makers — more control, options, and intimacy than traditional broadcast media 
can. Of course, the radio is much harder to talk back to than a computer with an 
Internet connection and email.

CHAPTER 1  Getting the Scoop on Podcasting      15
When you ask for feedback, you’re likely to get it — and from unusual places. 
Because geography doesn’t limit the distance your podcast can travel, you may 
find yourself with listeners in faraway and exotic places. And this feedback isn’t 
always going to be “Wow, great podcast!” Listeners will be honest with you when 
you invite feedback.
Creating a Podcast
There are two schools of thought when it comes to creating a podcast: The “I need 
the latest and greatest equipment to capture that crisp, clear sound of the broad-
casting industry” school of thought, and the “Hey, my computer came with a 
microphone, and I’ve got this cool recording software already installed” school of 
thought. Both are equally valid positions, and there are a lot of secondary schools 
in-between. The question is how far you’re willing to go.
But allow us to dispel a few misconceptions about podcasting right off the bat: 
You’re not reprogramming your operating system, you’re not hacking into the 
Internal Revenue Service’s database, and you’re not setting up a wireless com-
puter network with tinfoil from a chewing gum wrapper, a shoestring, and your 
belt — regardless if MacGyver showed you how. Podcasting, as mentioned earlier, 
is not rocket science. In fact, here’s a quick rundown of how you podcast:
1.	 Record audio or video and convert it to a download-friendly format.
2.	 Write up a description of what it is that you just created as a blog post.
3.	 Upload everything to a host server.
Yes, yes, yes, if it were that simple, then why is this book so thick? Well, we admit 
that this list does gloss over a few details, but a podcast — in its most streamlined, 
raw presentation — is that simple. The details of putting together a single episode 
start in Chapter 2 and wrap up in Chapter 8; then Chapters 10, 11, and 13 walk you 
through all the geek-speak you need to make the media you create into a podcast.
Looking for the bare necessities
You need a few things before starting your first podcast, many of which you can 
probably find on your own computer. For these beginning steps, we’re going to 
focus on audio podcasts. Here’s what you should keep an eye out for:
»
» A microphone: Look at your computer. Right now, regardless of whether 
you have a laptop or desktop model, Windows or Macintosh, your computer 

16      PART 1  Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency
probably has a microphone built into it — or guaranteed a USB port for 
plugging in an external mic. You might even luck out and find an included 
external mic packaged somewhere among the manuals, cables, and such. Yes, 
even your mobile phone has a microphone or it wouldn’t be much of a phone, 
now would it? Many earbuds even have a microphone in the cord with 
the earbuds.
Position the microphone in a comfortable spot on your desk or table. If 
you’re using a laptop, it should be somewhere on your desk that allows 
for best recording results without hunching over the computer like Young 
Frankenstein’s Igor (That’s EYE-gor.) Check the laptop’s documentation to find 
out where the built-in microphone is located in the unit’s housing. For the 
mobile phone, hold the device as if you are making a call, the way it was 
intended. Speaking in to it end-on or holding it any other way can degrade 
the audio quality. If you are using the microphone-earbuds set included with 
the phone’s purchase, you may need to do some experimentation.
Usually the built-in microphone in a laptop is located close to the edge of the 
keyboard or near the laptop’s speakers. Some models tuck it in at the center 
point of the monitor’s base.
»
» Recording software: Check out the software that came with your computer. 
You know, all those extra applications that you filed away, thinking, “I’ll check 
those out sometime.” Well, the time has arrived to flip through them. You 
probably have some sort of audio-recording software loaded on your 
computer, such as RecordIt (PC) or GarageBand (which comes preinstalled 
with many new Macs).
If you don’t already have the appropriate software, here’s a fast way to get it: 
Download the version of Audacity that fits your operating system (at www.
audacityteam.org), shown in Figure 1-1. (Oh, yeah . . . it’s free.)
»
» An audio interface: Make sure your computer has the hardware it needs to 
handle audio recording and the drivers to run the hardware — unless, of 
course, you have a built-in microphone.
Some desktop computers come with a very elementary audio card built into 
the motherboard. Before you run out to your local computer vendor and 
spring for an audio card, check your computer to see whether it can already 
handle basic voice recording.
For tips on choosing the right mic and audio accessories, be sure to check out 
Chapter 2. Chapter 3 covers all the software you need.

Recording your first podcast
When you have your computer set up and your microphone working, it’s time to 
start recording. Take a deep breath and then follow these steps:
1.	 Jot down a few notes on what you want to talk about.
Nothing too fancy — just make an outline that includes remarks about who 
you are and what you want to talk about. Use these bullet points to keep 
yourself on track.
All this — checking your computer, jotting down notes, and setting up your 
recording area — is called preshow prep, discussed in depth in Chapter 5 by 
other podcasters who have their own set ways of getting ready to record.
2.	 Click the Record button in your recording software and go for as long as it 
takes for you to get through your notes.
We recommend keeping your first recording to no more than 20 minutes. That 
may seem like a lot of time, but it will fly by.
3.	 Give a nice little sign-off (like “Take care of yourselves! See you next 
time.”) and click the Stop button.
4.	 Choose File ➪ Save As and give your project a name.
Now bask in the warmth of creative accomplishment.

Compressing your audio files
Portable media devices and computers can play MP3 files as a default format. 
While there are many other audio formats in existence, MP3 is quite common and 
the preferred format for podcasting. If your recording software can output straight 
to MP3 format, your life is much simpler. In Audacity’s case, you need to down-
load an add-on file. If you are using a different audio editor and can’t export 
directly to MP3, another option is Apple iTunes at www.apple.com/itunes. (The 
iTunes window is shown in Figure 1-2.) It does many things for the podcaster, 
including converting a wide variety of audio file formats to MP3. Yes, it’s from 
Apple, but the Apple folks made sure to create a version for Windows also.
After launching iTunes, follow these steps to convert your audio file:
1.	 Choose File ➪ Add File to Library.
Or you can press ⌘  +O (Mac) or Ctrl+O (Windows).
2.	 Browse for the audio file you want to convert and then click Open.
Your file is now in the iTunes Library.
3.	 Find the audio file in the iTunes Library and click to select it.
FIGURE 1-2:

available for both 
Mac and 
Windows 
platforms, can

CHAPTER 1  Getting the Scoop on Podcasting      19
4.	 Choose File ➪ Convert ➪ Create MP3 Version.
Your file is converted to the MP3 format. Figure 1-3 shows the progress screen 
that indicates your file is being converted.
The default file format for iTunes file import is AAC. If your menu doesn’t have a 
Create MP3 Version option, go to iTunes Preferences (File ➪ Preferences on a Mac, 
or Edit ➪ Preferences in Windows), under the General tab, Import Settings button, 
and change the Import Using option to MP3 Encoder. The Settings should be at 
least Good Quality (128 kbps); if you include a lot of audio design in your ­podcast, 
select Higher Quality (192 kbps). Now your files will be imported and converted 
to MP3.
Congratulations — you just recorded your first audio podcast! Easy, isn’t it? This 
is merely the first step into a larger world, as Obi-Wan once told Luke.
Uploading your audio to the web
An audio file sitting on your desktop, regardless of how earth-shattering the 
­contents may be, is not a podcast. Nope, not by a long shot. You have to get it up 
on the Internet and provide a way for listeners’ podcatcher software to grab that 
tasty file for later consumption.
If you already have a web server for your blog, company website, or personal 
website, this process can be as easy as creating a new folder and transferring your 
newly created audio file to your server.

Preferences tab,

compression you 
desire for your

If that last paragraph left you puzzled and you’re wondering what kind of mess 
you’ve gotten yourself into . . . relax. We don’t leave you hanging out in the wind. 
Chapter 11 covers everything you need to know about choosing a web host for your 
podcast media files.
We’ve been focusing a lot on audio at this point, and we will do that throughout 
the book. Just remember, though, a podcast media file can be any sort of media file 
you like — audio, video, interactive PDF. While our primary attention is on audio, 
you can use all the tips we give here to handle other types of media.
After you upload your episode, you need to have an RSS file (Really Simple 
Syndication) generated to deliver it. That happens automatically on a blog. The RSS 
describes where to find the media file you just uploaded. Check your blog software 
(like WordPress) for the details. Nearly all software for blogging (called blog 
engines) support RSS, but not all support podcasts. You may need to add a plug-in, 
a downloadable extension that make podcast support a simple affair. This gener-
ated RSS file is your podcast feed. People who listen to your podcast can subscribe 
to your show by placing a link to this podcast feed in their podcatching client — a 
fancy term for software that regularly checks one or more podcast feeds for new 
content.
Yes, we know . . . this all sounds really complicated. But we assure you it’s not. 
Some hosting companies such as LibSyn (www.libsyn.com) specialize in taking 
the technological “bite” out of podcasting so you can focus on creating your 
­best-sounding show. With LibSyn (shown in Figure 1-4), moving your episode to 
a web server is as simple as pushing a few buttons, and the creation of the RSS 2.0 
podcast feed and even the accompanying web page are automatic.
If you want to take more control over your website, podcast media files, and their 
corresponding RSS 2.0 feed, look at Chapters 11 and 13. In those pages, we walk 
you through some essentials — not only how to upload a file but also how to easily 
generate your RSS 2.0 file using a variety of tools.
Grabbing listeners
With media files in place and an RSS 2.0 feed ready for podcatcher consumption, 
you’re officially a podcaster. Of course, that doesn’t mean a lot if you’re the only 
person who knows about your podcast. You need to spread the word to let others 
know that you exist and that you have something pretty darned important to say.
Creating show notes
Before you pick up a bullhorn, slap a sandwich board over yourself, and start 
walking down the street (virtually, anyway), you have to make sure you’re 

CHAPTER 1  Getting the Scoop on Podcasting      21
descriptive enough to captivate those who reach your website. First, you’re going 
to want to describe the contents of your show to casual online passers-by in hopes 
of getting them to listen to what you have to say. That blogpost you created to help 
deliver your media is that place. This is where show notes take form and give ­people 
a rundown of what you’re talking about.
You can easily glance at a blog and get the gist of a conversation, but an audio file 
requires active listening to understand, and it’s quite difficult to skim. In effect, 
you’re asking people to make an investment of their time in listening to you talk, 
read a story, or play music. You need some compelling text on a web page to hook 
them.
Show notes are designed to quickly showcase or highlight the relevant and perti-
nent contents of the audio file itself. A verbatim transcript of your show isn’t 
always necessary, but we do recommend more than simply saying “a show about 
my day.” Chapter 12 discusses ways to create your show notes and offers tips and 
tricks to give them some punch.
Getting listed in directories
When you have a ready media file and a solid set of show notes, you’re ready to 
take your podcast message to the masses. You can get listed on some directories 
FIGURE 1-4: 
LibSyn handles 
many of the 
technical details 
of podcasting.

22      PART 1  Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency
and podcast-listing sites, such as iTunes, Google Play, Stitcher, and BluBrry 
(explained later in this chapter). Potential listeners visit literally dozens of 
­websites as they seek out new content, and getting yourself listed on as many as 
possible can help bring in more new listeners to your program.
A huge listener base is a double-edged sword: More demand for your product 
means more of a demand on you and the resources necessary to keep your podcast 
up and running. We recommend working on your craft and your skills, as well as 
getting a good handle on the personal and technological requirements of podcast-
ing, before you embark on a huge marketing campaign. When you’re ready, Part 4 
has more details about marketing.
Part 4 spends a lot of time talking about the various ways you can attract more 
listeners to your show and ways to respond to the ideas and feedback that your 
listeners inevitably provide. Many podcasters are surprised at the sheer volume of 
comments they receive from their listeners — but when you consider how per-
sonal podcasting is (compared to traditional forms of media distribution), that’s 
not surprising at all.
Catching a Cast with Your  
Podcatching Client
So, you have the MP3 file, an RSS feed, and accompanying show notes. You’re all 
set, but ask yourself, “How do podcasts get from the web to my preferred listening 
device?” To access all this great, new content, you need a podcatcher, an applica-
tion that looks at various RSS feeds, finds the new stuff, and transfers it from the 
Internet to your computer or mobile device automatically. In this section, we look 
at some of the different podcatching clients available for your listening and view-
ing needs.
You may think you need an iPod for all kinds of reasons, but you really don’t need 
one to podcast. Allow us to state that again: You do not need an iPod to listen to or 
create a podcast. You don’t even need an iPhone to listen to or create a podcast with, 
either. As long as you have an MP3 player — be it an application on a Mac, an 
application on a PC, mobile phone, or any portable device you can unplug and take 
with you — you possess the capability to listen to podcasts. Depending on the MP3 
player, you may even be able to create your podcast on the device as well — but to 
listen, all you need is a device that can play audio files. This includes your 
computer.

CHAPTER 1  Getting the Scoop on Podcasting      23
The following sections represent only a starting point for getting access to 
­podcasts. Any attempt at a comprehensive list would be instantly obsolete. Pod-
casting continues to grow in popularity, and new podcatching clients and players 
are coming out all the time. And remember, you can listen to podcasts on all sorts 
of devices besides computers — smartphones, tablets, AppleTV, Roku, and more!
For more information and product comparisons, we suggest heading over 
to  ­Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_podcatchers) and 
exploring more podcatching clients. Bottom line: At this point, you should easily 
be able to subscribe to the podcasts of your choice.
The catcher that started it all: Juice
Juice (shown in Figure  1-5) started life as a product called iSpider, then was 
branded as iPodder, and later became iPodder Lemon. In November 2005, as if 
searching for a new identity in the community, the package was rebranded as 
Juice. Inspired by a script written by the podfather himself, Adam Curry, Juice 
promotes itself as an open-source (free to use) application that downloads audio 
files from RSS feeds of your choice directly to your Mac or PC. You can then sync 
your portable player with your computer’s media player, and now you’re 
podcasting-on-the-go.
FIGURE 1-5:

breaking,

24      PART 1  Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency
Download Juice from http://juicereceiver.sourceforge.net. After you install 
it, subscribing to feeds is a simple process.
1.	 Click the Subscriptions tab.
2.	 On the Subscriptions pane, click the little green button with a plus 
symbol on it.
The Add a Feed window opens.
3.	 On your favorite podcast website, look for a small icon, typically orange, 
that says RSS, RSS 2.0, or something similar.
The icon may not even say RSS, but simply be a symbol like the one in the 
margin.
4.	 Right-click the icon to copy the link location.
5.	 Paste the copied information into the URL field of the Add a Feed 
window.
Or, type it in — just be very careful with your typing! If you get it wrong, you 
won’t get your downloads.
Congrats! You now know how to use Juice to subscribe to any podcasts you happen 
to come across in the future.
The turning of a corner: iTunes
With the launch of iTunes in June 2005, podcasting went from what the geeks 
were doing in the basement of the Science Building to the next wave of innovation 
on the Internet (which was, of course, developed by the geeks in the basement of 
the Science Building). There was plenty of contributing factors that help push 
podcasting mainstream but iTunes opening its own directory and allowing for an 
easier subscription method was a huge step forward. As always, such a step into 
the mainstream market brought some dismay to the original podcasters, finding 
themselves overshadowed by larger media entities. Now, recognizable studios like 
NPR, Disney, ESPN, BBC, and so on dominate the iTunes Music Store podcast 
directory (shown in Figure 1-6). What about the indie podcasts — the ones that 
started it all? Would they be forgotten? Go unnoticed? Languish unsubscribed? 
Well, at first, it seemed that many of the original groundbreakers that the pod-
casting community knew and loved (Comedy4Cast, Career Opportunities, Coverville, 
GrammarGirl) might get lost in the stampede. But not yet, as it turns out.
Apple’s iTunes (available for download at www.itunes.com) lends an automatic 
hand to people who don’t know where to find podcatchers, where to find blogs 
that host podcasts, and which podcast directories list the shows that fit their 
needs and desires — now they too can enjoy a wide range of podcast choices.

CHAPTER 1  Getting the Scoop on Podcasting      25
Apple now offers for people’s mobile devices a podcast app simply called Podcasts. 
If you want your music management and podcast management all on the go and 
away from your computer, you can search, subscribe, and manage your podcasts 
from here.
With its June 2005 edition, iTunes became a one-stop shop for all your podcasting 
needs; subscribing to a podcast with iTunes is just as easy, if not easier than with 
Juice. Follow these steps to do so:
1.	 Select Podcasts from the drop-down menu located on the left side in the 
top section.
2.	 Find the podcast of your choice.
You can do that by
•	 Browsing the list of iTunes top episodes and podcasts featured on the right 
side of the iTunes window.
•	 Clicking See All on any category or listing.
•	 Searching by using the Search box in the upper right. Note, make sure you 
select Store in the top center so you aren’t just searching your own library!
3.	 When you get to the podcast page (and available podcasts) in iTunes, 
click the Subscribe button.
After your podcast finishes downloading, you can find the new episodes by 
going to the Podcasts section in the left column of iTunes. The new episodes 
are marked to let you know that you have fresh content waiting for you, and 
iTunes remembers where you left off in a podcast if you pause or zip over to 
another podcast or playlist.

Podcatching on the go: Stitcher
As smartphones and tablets became more and more prevalent, the notion of 
­having “an app for that” grew in demand. Finding and subscribing to podcasts in 
the early days of iTunes on a mobile device was possible, but a bit clunky. The 
stage had been set for a new kind of podcatcher that was just as easy and elegant 
to use on your mobile device as it would be on a computer.
Enter Stitcher, shown in Figure 1-7.
Stitcher Radio (www.stitcher.com with an app available for both iPhone and 
Android) debuted in 2008 and has quickly become a must-have for not only 
­podcasts, but for radio shows coast-to-coast and around the world. On the app or 
on their computer, members of the Stitcher community “stitch” together on-air 
feeds from radio stations and podcasts both from professional and amateur stu-
dios into personalized stations all readily available on your mobile devices. Stitcher 
has become so popular, it joins Pandora as part of featured entertainment options 
in newer model cars.
Once you set up a free user account on Stitcher, finding a podcast for your per-
sonal feed is only a few taps away:
1.	 Launch Stitcher on your mobile device.
2.	 Find the podcast of your choice.
You can do that by

CHAPTER 1  Getting the Scoop on Podcasting      27
•	 Tapping on the Search icon in the top right corner.
•	 Tapping on the Menu option in the top-left corner and tapping Browse 
Shows, which offers a variety of categories and sub-categories of interest
•	 Swiping up through the offered feeds on your Front Page. (The more you 
use Stitcher, the more shows matching your interests will appear here.)
3.	 When you get to the podcast page (and available podcasts) in Stitcher, 
click the Listen button.
4.	 When the podcast plays, you should see a plus sign (+) to the right. 
Tap that, and the podcast now appears on your Favorites Playlist (see 
Figure 1-8).
Now you have your podcast feeds on a mobile device that can either play through 
your device, or through the media center of your car. Stitcher makes the portabil-
ity of podcasts a piece of cake. It’s an app you should have on your mobile device 
in order to make podcasting happen anywhere.

Podcasting with the G-man: Google Play
As mentioned earlier, Apple iOS users have their own app specifically dedicated to 
listening to podcasts. Not to be outdone, the diversified search engine service 
Google, along with Google Drive, Google Docs, and Google Voice, which we discuss 
later on, offers Google Play (at https://play.google.com/store with an app 
available from the same location) for Android users. It’s just as good as it sounds: 
Google Play is Google’s version of the iTunes Music app and the Pocasts app, all in 
one (see Figure 1-9).
Google Play works with the Google Play Music app to bring podcasts to you in the 
same way Stitcher and Podcasts do. There are a few extra steps involved in getting 
podcasts subscribed and playing on your phone. Once you download Google Play 
Music and sync it up with your Google account:
1.	 Launch Google Play Music on your mobile device, and then tap on the 
Menu option in the top left of the app screen.
2.	 Select Podcasts from the options.
3.	 Find the podcast of your choice.
You can do that by
•	 Tapping on the Search icon in the upper-right corner.
•	 Tapping on the All Categories option to reveal the top-rated podcasts of 
categories and sub-categories of interest.
•	 Swiping through Top Charts, podcasts that are either promoted or popular. 
This is the main page of Google Play Music’s Podcasts directory.
FIGURE 1-9: 
Google Play, an 
alternative for 
Android users.

4.	 When you find the podcast you want to listen to, click the Subscribe 
button.
5.	 Google Play Music will then offer a series of options for you to complete 
before subscribing.
•	 Select Auto-download if you want the latest content to update 
automatically.
•	 Opt-in for a push notification when new content downloads.
•	 Select a Playback Order if you want podcast episodes to go from oldest to 
newest, or newest to oldest.
6.	 Tap Subscribe again.
As seen by the Subscription process, Google Play Music’s app is like many of 
Google’s apps — it’s a work-in-progress. With more people podcasting, there will 
probably be future editions of Google Play Music that will be smoother in their 
execution. Granted, if your loyalties are not to one operating system, Stitcher 
works for both iOS and Android users. Regardless of which app best suits you and 
your digital lifestyle, it’s good to know options are out there and available for you.
Quest for Podcasts
Now that you have your podcatching client, it’s time to take a good listen to what’s 
happening in the podcasting community. If you’re going to podcast (and with you 
picking up this book, it’s a safe assumption that the interest is strong), it’s a good 
idea to look around the podcasting community and see what other podcasters are 
doing.
Many podcatching clients have internal directories of podcasts, and you can access 
their listings from another directory or listing site maintained elsewhere on the 
Internet. Other aggregators maintain their own lists based on how many listeners 
have used their podcatcher to subscribe to particular shows.
Some of the more popular directories where podcasts can be found include:
»
» iTunes: iTunes makes finding podcasts easy. The directory includes not only 
show information — searchable in a myriad of ways — but also the ability to 
listen to specific episodes, subscribe to a podcast with one click, visit the 
show’s website, leave comments, and see the podcast picks of other people 
who share an interest in the show you’re viewing.

30      PART 1  Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency
»
» Stitcher: The directories of both the website and mobile app are similar in 
that you can search top ranked or by categories for new podcasts. In the 
mobile app, however, individual episodes offer you the chance to Like an 
episode, share the episode across a variety of means (text messages, social 
media, and so on), or leave a comment specifically for that episode. You can 
also tell Stitcher you’ll Listen Later, and it highlights the episode in your 
directory as a priority for another time. Figure 1-10 shows the Stitcher app.
»
» Google Play Music: While the actual online Google Play directory only 
features apps for podcasting, the actual Google Play Music apps offer you 
the ability to find listed podcasts. You can also share podcasts like you can 
with Stitcher, but the process is not necessarily as quick and easy as Stitcher. 
(Remember that whole work-in-progress we mentioned earlier?) You can 
have a look at your options with podcasts through Google Play Music at www.
androidcentral.com/how-use-podcasts-google-play-music-android.
»
» Apple’s Podcasts: A separate app from the Music app, the Podcasts app for 
all Apple mobile devices allows you to search, subscribe, and manage your 
various podcasts. You can access show notes, share shows across a variety 
of platforms (like Stitcher), and even follow links referenced in show notes 
FIGURE 1-10:

to other locations. It is a robust app, and offers a lot of hidden options. 
(Tap through options offered, and you find out this is a layered app.) 
Figure 1-11 shows the Apple Podcasts app.
»
» PlayIt: Set up in a fashion like Stitcher, Play.It (http://play.it) offers 
podcasts in various categories ranging from Top Ranked to Shows of Interest. 
Unlike some directories that offer interaction, PlayIt keeps it simple with show 
art, show description, and brief episode descriptions. There are a few social 
share options, but brevity is the soul of wit with this directory.
If you want people to find you on Stitcher Radio, you need to register your podcast 
in their network. Just registering a podcast on iTunes isn’t enough. Same with 
Google Play. Each directory offering podcasts through its app may ask that you 
register with its network. Usually, it’s a free service. All it costs you is time. It 
would not be a bad idea to have this information documented in a separate file so 
all you need to do from directory to directory is copy and paste.
We give you a few other places to get started in the following sections — ­directories, 
podcast-listing services, and even podcast-specific search engines. (Check out the 
FIGURE 1-11:

various sources mentioned in Chapter 18 as well.) So where are these directories? 
Fire up your browser and, as Edgar Winter says, “Come on and take a free ride. . .”
There are so many directories for podcasts that Rob Walch of Podcast411 
has  put  together a directory of directories (http://podcast411.libsyn.com/
directories).
Other Podcast Resources
It goes without saying that this book is a snapshot in time, and you will likely 
want to keep up on the latest news and information of the podcasting world. We 
have a few suggestions to get you started. Perhaps, as you gain experience in 
­podcasting, you’ll share some of your pearls of wisdom with the community by 
contributing back to the vast universe of podcasting that many people like to call 
the podosphere. We recommend trying out these:
»
» Meetup.com: When you go to https://meetup.com and enter podcast, you 
might be surprised to find others in your area doing podcasts as well. Meetup.
com is a great place to organize anything from a meetup at a coffee shop to 
a group of 200 in a rented hall. If you don’t spot anything, why not set up a 
podcast get together and see who responds.
»
» PodCamp: Held around the world, a full schedule found at http://podcamp.
pbworks.com,PodCamp is a community-based, community-driven, open-air 
conference. It is called PodCamp but these events are geared toward enthusi­
asts and professionals into podcasting, blogging, vlogging, and social network­
ing. These PodCamps have been happening since 2006 and, in most cases, are 
free to the public.
»
» #TryPod: At the time of this writing, a special event hosted by podcasters 
from all parts of the world is taking place. The event is called #TryPod 
(http://legacy.wbur.org/about/blog/2017/03/03/trypod). Podcasters 
are turning to social media platforms to share their shows with new and 
pod-curious listeners. By the time this book reaches print the event will be 
done, but looking up #TryPod may just introduce you to some fantastic 
online talent.
»
» Podcasts about podcasting: Rob Walsh has one. Elsie Escobar has one. 
Daniel J. Lewis also has one. Heck, we have one for this book! Podcasters love 
talking shop so why not search for podcasts on how to podcast? It sounds 
pretty meta, sure, but if Tom Felton can deliver Harry Potter and Planet of the 
Apes references with a straight face while guest starring on CW’s The Flash, 
then searching for podcasts on how to podcasts shouldn’t be a challenge for 
anybody.

Getting the Gadgets That 
Make a Podcast Go
N
ow that you’re effectively hip as to what podcasting is and what it’s all 
about, you need to start building your studio. This studio can come in a 
variety of shapes, sizes, and price tags. What you’re thinking about 
doing — podcasting — is like any hobby you pursue. If it’s something to pass the 
time, then keep your setup simple. A modest setup with little to no investment is 
ideal if you want to see whether you like playing with audio. If, on the other hand, 
you find yourself tapping into a hidden passion or (even better) talent, you might 
want to upgrade to the audio gear that’s bigger, better, and badder than the basics.
If you suddenly decide you — yes, you — have a message you want to share, your 
next plan of action will be one of two options: picking up a digital recorder, read-
ing the instruction manual, and then downloading some free audio-editing  
software — or watching the DIY Network for methods of soundproofing the base-
ment and looking at industry-standard equipment that might require some extra 
homework to master.
This is the beauty of podcasting. In the long run, it doesn’t matter whether your 
podcasting studio is a smartphone with a plug-in microphone or comprised of the 
latest mixing boards, audio software, and recording equipment. Both approaches 
to podcasting work and are successfully implemented on a variety of podcasts.

34      PART 1  Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency
So which one works best for what you have in mind? That’s what we look at in this 
chapter, discussing the options, advantages, and disadvantages of each setup.
Finding the Right Mic
It’s easy and affordable to make your computer podcast-capable. Your first order 
of business is to find the right mic. If you already have a microphone built into 
your laptop (and you don’t mind starting out basic), you can just download Audac-
ity (described in Chapter 3) and take advantage of the fact that it’s free. That’s all 
there is to it! (For openers, anyway.)
However, if your desktop computer didn’t come with a mic (or you’re just not 
happy podcasting Quasimodo-style), you’re going to want to shop around. While 
microphone shopping, consider the following criteria:
»
» What’s your price range? In many cases, especially with inexpensive mics, 
you get what you pay for in quality of construction and range of capabilities. 
You want the most affordable model of microphone that will do the job for 
you and your podcast.
»
» Do you plan to use the mic primarily in the studio or on location? A 
high-end shockmounted model isn’t the best choice for a walk in the park, and 
a lapel mic might not provide you with the quality of sound expected for an 
in-studio podcast. Before you purchase your mic, consider your podcasting 
location needs.
There are many different types of microphones and microphone connections 
(or jacks). Some mics are meant to plug in to mixers while others connect 
directly to your computer’s USB port. If you’re thinking of starting with an 
inexpensive mic, you may not be able to plug it in to your “upgraded” rig later. 
Depending on your needs, you may find yourself upgrading more than just 
your microphone down the road.
»
» What do you want this mic to do? Record sound? Yeah, okay, but what kind 
and in what surroundings? Some mics offer ease of handling for interviews. 
Some are good at snagging specific outdoor sounds. Others may be better at 
capturing live music. You need to consider multipurpose mics, guest mics, and 
on-location recording devices, or any kind of condition your podcast provides 
for you.
Even after narrowing your options, there are so many microphones on the market. 
After a while, the manufacturers, makes, and models all start to give you that kind 
of brain-freeze you get when you eat ice cream too quickly. The sections that 

CHAPTER 2  Getting the Gadgets That Make a Podcast Go      35
follow give you the lowdown on the mic that’s right for your budget and even 
make a few sound recommendations along the way.
In Season Three of this book’s companion podcast, Podcasting For Dummies: The 
Companion Podcast, Tee and Chuck host several episodes concerning micro-
phones, including one where they test several makes and models, comparing 
the  sound of each. To find out more about microphones, gadgets, and con-
cepts,  listen to Podcasting For Dummies: The Companion Podcast, available at 
www.podcastingfordummies.com.
Mics on the cheap
Most of the economical microphones on the market use USB (Universal Serial Bus) 
hookups. Figure 2-1 shows two types of USB plugs, which you may have used for 
attaching a digital camera or an MP3 player. You can go online to any of the com-
puter equipment retailers and type USB microphones in their respective search 
engines. Make sure you include USB, because a search for microphones can bring 
up many more alternatives, including video cameras, high-end mics (which we 
talk about next), and other devices that might be way out of your budget.
You don’t have to sacrifice your retirement fund to get started with a USB micro-
phone. Prices start under $20 for a simple desktop microphone. The phrase “you 
get what you pay for” doesn’t always apply in podcasting. We’ve heard some 
amazing sounds out of very inexpensive microphones.

When shopping for microphones, you’ll hear a lot of terminology like omnidirec-
tional and unidirectional. These multisyllabic words may look cool to type and are 
impressive to say, but when you read them or they’re spoken to you, they can be 
a little intimidating. In the next two sections, we demystify these terms and 
explain how effective these various mic types are for podcasting.
Omnidirectional mics
Most microphones that come preinstalled in laptops are omnidirectional — they 
pick up sounds from all directions at once. You can find a fair number of omnidi-
rectional microphones that plug in to your mobile phone for under $10. Omnidi-
rectional mics pick up your voice, along with the television in the background, the 
traffic outside, the rustling of clothes, the ceiling fan . . . basically, if it makes 
noise and is within range of the mic, it’s recorded.
Although omnidirectional mics are ideal for sound-seeing tours (audio tours that 
incorporate surrounding sounds for ambiance) they may not be ideal for all in-
studio podcasting because they don’t capture your sound in detail — even when 
your mouth is so close that your lips brush against the mic’s screen. They tend to 
add a sharp, tinny quality to your voice and cut out on harsh, sudden sounds such 
as consonants (especially ps and ts). That’s partly because basic omnidirectional 
mics vary widely in quality and partly because of the limits imposed by their con-
struction. The built-in models, for instance, are sometimes crammed into leftover 
nooks in their devices, where they’re awkward to use and can pick up internal noise.
The most basic of omnidirectional desktop mics available would be Audio-­
Technica’s ATR-4750, currently retailing for about $13, compatible with both 
Mac and Windows platforms, and connecting with a 3.5 mm stereo (1/8″") mini-
plug. There are omnidirectional mics that come with headphones. Logitech 
(www.logitech.com) offers a wide variety of headsets built with microphones 
beginning  at just under $30, offering you the ability to record and monitor 
­yourself as you do so.
One advantage headsets have over a desktop microphone is that your mouth is 
always the same distance away from the actual part of the microphone that picks 
up sound. If you’re an animated podcaster like your authors, this may be useful. 
On the other hand, they can be very sensitive to breathing sounds. If the mic boom 
is in the wrong position, the slightest breath from your mouth or nose will sound 
like an EF5 tornado passing by.
Although purchasing a USB headset is a monetary plus because you’re getting 
both headphones and mic together with one purchase, this isn’t all you need to 
monitor yourself as you record. To self-monitor your recording, you need soft-
ware that offers you an on-screen mixer, a mixing board, or the option to monitor 
the incoming audio signal.

CHAPTER 2  Getting the Gadgets That Make a Podcast Go      37
Installation for these inexpensive investments can be a breeze. Find a USB port on 
your Mac or PC, plug in your new headset or microphone, and set up your audio 
preferences in your recording software. You’re ready for recording.
Unidirectional mics
Unidirectional mics, unlike their omnidirectional brethren, pick up sound from 
only one direction: the direction they’re pointing. What makes unidirectional mics 
a good choice for podcasting is in how by design they filter out surrounding 
sounds, reproducing only the sound directed to it. For in-studio podcasting, 
interviews, and quality recording, unidirectional microphones are the best option.
If you want to know exactly what a unidirectional mic is and what it can do, take 
a look at the Brian DePalma film, Blow Out. John Travolta plays a Foley Artist, a guy 
who collects random sound effects and then enhances them for particular 
moments in whatever film he’s working on. One night, he takes a stroll through 
the park with a shotgun microphone, a certain kind of unidirectional mic that picks 
up only sounds located where it is pointing. This microphone is so particular that 
it concentrates on recording along the line of sight — so it records not only the 
sound of a tire blowing out, but also the gunshot that causes it to happen.
If you’re out shopping for a unidirectional microphone, watch for the term cardi-
oid. It relates to the pattern and sensitivity of the microphone. And if you have a 
podcast that’s out in the field and want to be able to surrender the mic to guests 
and subjects without worry, look no further than the MXL 770 (see Figure 2-2). 
This mic, like many in the Marshall line, offers fantastic audio results for an eco-
nomic investment. Podcasters can pick up the MXL 770 for under $100 and get 
years of reliability and quality out of it.

Investing in a high-end mic
So you can go cheap and pick up a microphone for as little as ten dollars, but let’s 
be honest here — you’re going to sound like you’ve been recorded by a ten-dollar 
microphone. Say, however, you really want that sharp, professional sound for 
your podcast, and the cheaper microphones just aren’t cutting it for you. As you 
shop for an upgrade, you see mics ranging in price from an inexpensive $70 and 
reaching up to $3,600! (No, you’re not seeing a typo involving an extra zero.) So 
what defines a microphone? Price? Manufacturer? Look?
What truly defines a microphone is how you sound in it and how it reproduces the 
sound coming in. Based on how mics work, prices vary, but as you can see from 
our recommendations, plenty of high-quality microphones that are out there can 
pick up nuances and details and remain in the range of affordability.
When you purchase a higher-end microphone, keep in mind that you probably 
will receive no additional cables for hookup, a jack that does not fit into your 
computer, and no stand. That’s because you’re upgrading to professional equip-
ment. The manufacturer is assuming that you already have the tools, bells and 
whistles, and extra do-dads to make this mic work for you. For the lowdown on 
what accessories you need to hook up your new mic to your computer, check out 
the “Accessorize! Accessorize! Accessorize!” section later in this chapter.
Remember those three questions a few pages back? Question #2 — Do you plan to 
use the mic primarily in the studio or on location? — helps narrow your search even 
more for the microphone that’s the right investment for you. At this level, there 
are two kinds of mics you will hear people talk about: dynamic and condenser mics.
Although dynamic microphones are marketed more for on-location recording and 
condenser mics are considered best for in-studio recording, these aren’t fast- 
and-hard rules for what mics should be used where. Sometimes, podcasters use 
condensers in outdoor settings, and some podcasters prefer the sound of dynamic 
mics in studio over condensers. When picking a microphone, you want a mic that 
not only suits your needs but also makes you sound good. Really good.
Dynamic mics
Dynamic mics are what you see everywhere from speaking engagements to rock 
concerts. In fact, when someone mentions the word microphone, the image that 
comes to mind is probably a dynamic microphone. These mics work like a speaker 
in reverse. Sound entering a dynamic mic (by speaking directly into it) vibrates a 
diaphragm (a small plate) attached to a coil. This is located within proximity of a 
magnet, and the vibrations that this Wile E. Coyote setup makes create a small 
electric current. When this signal runs through a preamp or mixer, the original 
sound is re-created. This system sounds complicated (and if you’ve ever looked 

CHAPTER 2  Getting the Gadgets That Make a Podcast Go      39
inside of a microphone, it is), but the internal makeup of dynamic microphones is 
such that they can take a lot of incoming signal and still produce audio clearly. 
They’re also rugged in build so they can be manhandled, making dynamic mics 
exceptional for outdoor recording.
If you’re working in-studio, consider working with Heil Microphones’ PR40 
(­pictured in Figure  2-3). This mic offers up a clean, rich sound and picks up 
incredible details for a dynamic microphone. For microphones you may want to 
use out in the field, the Røde Reporter (www.rode.com/microphones/reporter), 
is specifically designed for handheld interviews, and delivers broadcast-quality 
results within any environment.
Condenser mics
When podcasting happens in studio and you’re looking for the subtleties and 
nuances of the human voice in your recording (the more detail you get, the 
­better!), you may want to shop for studio condenser microphones. The anatomy of 
a condenser microphone is very different from a dynamic one. In the condenser, a 
diaphragm (similar to the dynamic’s) is suspended in front of a stationary plate 
that conducts electricity. As a signal enters the microphone, the air between 
the diaphragm and the plate is displaced, creating a fluctuating electrical charge. 
Once given a bit more power (phantom power, which is explained later in this 
chapter), the movement becomes an electrical representation of the incoming 
audio signal.

A SHURE-FIRE INVESTMENT
If you were born after 1980, do yourself a favor and find on Netflix or borrow from a 
friend the comedy classic, The Blues Brothers. Aside from many tropes you see in movies 
now (that started with this movie), there is one joke that — thanks to podcasting — will 
make sense to you. Jake (John Belushi) turns to Elwood (Dan Aykroyd), after looking over 
the “new used” car his brother is driving, and asks him what happened to their Cadillac. 
“I traded it,” Elwood replies, “for a microphone.” Jake leans forward, a little stunned. “You 
traded the Bluesmobile for a microphone?!?” Then, on reflection, he nods. “All right, I can 
see that.” There are differences between the economic $20 USB microphones and the 
more expensive dynamic and condenser microphones, and there are even bigger differ-
ences between the $100 microphones and the $700 microphones.
The Shure SM7B was the first industry microphone Tee ever had in Imagine That! 
Studios. This was a microphone that, for its price, could easily cover two mixers and 
two high-end microphones, and this was a dynamic microphone, a kind of microphone 
that Tee wasn’t accustomed to working with in studio. He had recorded with this mic 
before though, in locations such as the Washington, D.C. WJFK and NPR affiliates in 
the DC-metro area. Now, it was in his studio, and after his first recording project, Tee 
understood — with the mic’s clarity and exceptional performance — exactly why Shure 
microphones are considered the industry standard when it comes to recording 
­equipment, be it in-studio or on location recording.

CHAPTER 2  Getting the Gadgets That Make a Podcast Go      41
This setup sounds very delicate, doesn’t it? Guess what  — it is! This is why 
­condenser mics are transported in padded cases; they’re not really built for 
hand-held use and are best used in a studio application (as shown in Figure 2-4) 
versus an on-location kind of podcast. If manhandled or jostled around, plates can 
be knocked out of whack or damaged, causing problems in the pick-ups.
The advantage to this delicate setup is that condenser mics are far more sensitive 
to sound, and they pick up a wider spectrum of audio. These microphones are so 
sensitive to noise around them that some come with shockmounts — spring-loaded 
frames that suspend the mic when attached to a microphone stand, providing 
­better reception while reducing any noise or vibration from your microphone 
stand. Think of a shockmount as a shock absorber for your mic.
If you plan to have a studio with multiple guests, the sensitivity of several 
­condenser microphones can be a liability and will degrade the overall sound of 
your podcast. The sound from one person’s voice will be picked up not only on 
that person’s mic, but also on the other mics as a “distant” sound. For multi-mic 
podcasts in the same location, consider dynamic microphones.
FIGURE 2-4:

Microphones can be an investment, worth the trade-in of a car in Jake and Elwood’s 
case. What you invest in a microphone will reflect in the quality of its sound. For Tee, the 
investment was the right one. But is such an investment right for you? Be sure that you 
and your podcast are ready for this kind of studio asset. Ask other podcasters what they 
use — we’re happy to brag, er, talk about our gear, try out microphones if vendors allow 
for such test drives, and take your time before making such an investment.

42      PART 1  Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency
Tee is a big fan of MXL microphones, mentioned earlier in this chapter. His first 
in-studio microphone was an MXL 990, a model he still podcasts with to this 
day. MXL microphones, along with being affordable, reliable, and popular, often 
come bundled with mixer boards (discussed in the section, “Podcasts Well with 
Others: The Mixing Board,” later in this chapter). Online vendors like BSW 
(www.bswusa.com) offer podcast bundles featuring another MXL microphone, the 
BCD-1. With each bundle offering new accessories, cost and features go up, but 
the quality sound that the MXL line captures remains the same.
USB Studio Condenser mics
Microphone vendors are noting the popularity of podcasting, and now USB Studio 
Condenser microphones are becoming more and more prevalent. Blue’s Snowball 
iCE ($50) and Yeti Pro ($270) are solid examples of what is now available for pod-
casters working on tight budgets. With these microphone models, podcasters can 
now record studio quality audio without an additional audio card, a mixer, or any 
of the go-betweens once considered essential for connecting audio gear to a com-
puter. With USB condenser microphones, the audio signal now has a direct con-
nection to the computer. It makes your podcast production extremely portable.
Two drawbacks of USB microphones:
»
» Latency is the slight echo you hear in your voice as you record. This is your 
computer trying to re-create the signal in real time for monitoring purposes. 
The recording itself will sound fine, but as you’re monitoring yourself, you may 
hear yourself echoing, and the echo may progressively get worse the longer 
you record one session, depending on your computer’s performance. A faster 
computer can reduce the latency but likely not resolve it completely. You can 
side-step the latency problem by disabling the recording application’s monitor 
or use the built-in headphone jack provided with many USB microphones.
THE PHANTOM (POWER) OF THE PODCAST
You might notice that condenser mics (such as the MXL 990 and 770 described in this 
chapter) are phantom powered — their connection to the mixer provides them with all 
the power they need. Portable condenser mics use batteries to get their kick, but when 
they start to die, so does your recording quality. (A word to the wise: Always check your 
mic’s battery level before you interview and have fresh batteries on hand.) Because 
phantom power comes from the mixing board (in the studio) through the cable con-
necting to the mic, it supplies a constant boost. No battery worries unless you are using 
a portable recorder as a pre-amp, covered in Chapter 4.

CHAPTER 2  Getting the Gadgets That Make a Podcast Go      43
»
» Expandability is another issue. While USB microphones are quick and easy 
to set up, there’s no good way to connect more than one to a computer at a 
time. If you are planning to have your best friend as a co-host or have an 
in-studio interview guest, then consider microphones that connect to a 
mixing board.
High end is relative. Professional recording studios can spend hundreds of dollars 
on a single microphone. Fortunately, the MP3 format isn’t so finicky. For this 
book, we’re defining high-end microphones as those ranging from $100 and up.
Podcasts Well with Others:  
The Mixing Board
If you’re looking to have more people in studio or you want to entertain guests on 
your podcast, you need more than just a good microphone. (Otherwise there will 
be the passing back and forth of a mic, and that’ll get distracting after a while.) 
You also need inputs for more microphones and full control over these multiple 
microphones.
Along with good microphones (and probably microphone stands, discussed later in 
the “Accessorize! Accessorize! Accessorize!” section), you will want to invest in a 
mixing board. What a mixing board (or mixer) does for your podcast is open up the 
recording options, such as multiple hosts or guests, recording acoustic instru-
ments, and balancing sound to emphasize one voice over another or balance both 
seamlessly.
You see mixers at rock concerts and in behind-the-scenes documentaries for the 
film and recording industry. They come in all shapes and sizes; Figure 2-5 shows 
the Behringer Q1202USB mixer. For under $100 you can connect four microphones 
and several additional stereo inputs and feed them directly in to the USB port on 
your computer.
Before you take your mixer out of its packing, make sure you have room for it 
somewhere on the desk or general area where you intend to podcast. Something 
you’ll want to consider is how close you want to be to the mixer. An ideal reach for 
your mixer is a short one. Whether it’s you recording yourself or balancing the 
levels of those around you, clear off a section within a relaxed reach. You’ll be 
happier because of it.

44      PART 1  Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency
The anatomy of a mixing board
The easiest way to look at a mixing board is as if you’re partitioning your com-
puter into different recording studios. But instead of calling them studios, these 
partitions are called tracks.
A mixing board provides mono tracks and stereo tracks, and you can use any of 
those tracks for input or output of audio signals. No matter the make or model, 
mixing boards are outrageously versatile. If you’re podcasting with a friend, you 
can hook up two mics through a mixer so you won’t have to huddle around the 
same microphone or slide it back and forth as you take turns speaking. Multiple 
microphones are the best option when you and your friends gather around to 
record. A real advantage of the mixer is that it allows you to adjust the audio levels 
of those multiple inputs independently so they sound even.
You may also be wondering about all those wacky knobs on a mixing board. Some 
of the knobs deal with various frequencies in your voice and can deepen, sharpen, 
or soften the qualities of your voice, and perhaps even help filter out surrounding 
background noise (which is the sound of an empty room because even in silence, 
there is noise). The knobs on the mixing board that are your primary concern 
are  the ones that control your volume or levels, as the board labels them. The 
higher the level, the more input signal your voice gains when recording. If one of 
your tracks is being used for output, the level dictates how loud the playback 
through your headphones is.
Heavy-metal legends Spinal Tap may prefer sound equipment that “goes to 11,” 
but cranking your mixing board way up and leaving it that way won’t do your 
podcast much good. The best way to handle sound is to set your levels before pod-
casting. That’s what’s going on when you see roadies at a concert do a mic check. 
The oh-so-familiar “Check One, Check Two, Check-Check-Check . . .” is one way 
FIGURE 2-5:

Q1202USB, a

CHAPTER 2  Getting the Gadgets That Make a Podcast Go      45
of setting your levels, but a better method is just rambling on as if you were 
­podcasting and then adjusting your sound levels according to your recording 
application’s volume unit (VU) meter. For more on setting levels, hop to Chapter 7 
for all the details.
ANALOG VERSUS DIGITAL
So you decide to go mixer shopping and you see a lot of these mixers going for $40 or 
$50, and in some cases the same number of inputs at two to three times the cost. What 
gives?
Before rushing off and making a purchase you may regret later, understand the major 
types of mixers and the features they have. The two different types of mixers are analog 
and digital. What makes a digital mixer a digital mixer is how it processes the signals 
internally before it gets sent to your computer or recording device. Analog mixers have 
the benefit of being simple to set up, configure, and in the case of those with USB or 
FireWire interfaces — yes, analog mixers can have digital outputs — easy to connect. 
The drawback is they are ‘hard wired’ in their configuration and any additional signal 
processing needs to be done with additional hardware.
What kind of processing, you ask? Compression to bring up low spots and dampen loud 
spots, or a gate which can set a threshold (a minimal noise level) before getting through 
to the mixer. These are nice features to help clean up the audio, but not mandatory. 
Digital mixers take the inputs from microphones, instruments, and other devices, and 
turn them in to a digital signal inside the mixer. They often have on-board compressors 
and gates for each channel and often complex input and output routing configuration.
Most podcasters don’t need this level of sophistication, but Chuck Tomasi isn’t most 
people. After his Tascam DM-4800 mixer gets done processing everything, the audio still 
comes out the back and connects to his Zoom H6 recorder with an analog jack. Yes, it 
has an option for a FireWire card, but he’s never opted to get it.
In the case of mixers, you do get what you pay for. Cheaper mixers often have inferior 
audio output because of cheap pre-amps or other components. They often are poorly 
constructed and don’t last as long. For something that sits on the desk, it’s amazing how 
much abuse a mixer can take. When considering how much to spend, use the same rule 
with mixers as computers — get as much as you can afford. Having a professional 
microphone with a low-end mixer can put your overall quality at risk.

Hooking up a mixer to your computer
Now that you have your desk cleaned off (mind the dust bunnies!) and a perfect 
place for the mixer, set your mixer where you want it. And then make certain you 
can see the following items:
»
» Your USB or FireWire mixer
»
» A power supply
»
» A USB or FireWire cable
Before hooking up the new mixer, check the manufacturer’s website for any 
downloads (drivers, upgrades to firmware, patches, and so on) needed to make 
your digital mixing board work.
USB and FireWire mixers are so similar in setup that we can give the same steps 
for both kinds of mixers. Regardless of where you fall in the Mac/PC debate, you 
can follow these steps to hook up your mixer board:
(continued)

CHAPTER 2  Getting the Gadgets That Make a Podcast Go      47
1.	 Shut down your computer.
2.	 Connect the power supply to the back of the mixer and to an available 
wall socket or power strip.
3.	 Find an available USB or FireWire port and plug your mixer-appropriate 
cable into the computer.
If your computer’s ports are maxed out, we recommend investing in a PCI card 
that gives your computer additional USB or FireWire ports. Do not run your 
digital mixer through a hub because that will affect the quality of the audio.
A direct connection between your mixer and computer is the best.
4.	 Plug the USB or FireWire cable into the back of your mixer.
5.	 Connect your input devices (microphones, headphones, monitors, and 
the like) to the mixer.
6.	 Power up your mixer by turning on the Main Power and the Phantom 
Power switches. See Figure 2-6.
7.	 Start your computer.
8.	 Install any drivers your USB/FireWire mixer may need.
Follow the instructions according to the manufacturer’s enclosed documenta-
tion. Restart your computer if necessary.

THE G-TRACK: THE BEST OF  
BOTH WORLDS
So far we’ve been talking about microphones and mixers as being two separate entities, 
but Samson Technologies decided to take the audio equivalent of chocolate and peanut 
butter and combine them into one sweet device: The G-Track, shown in the figure.
This microphone is a lot more than just a studio condenser mic. The G-Track has inputs 
built directly into the mic for an additional audio source (labeled as Instrument but it can 
really be for any audio input) and for headphones. With the mic’s basic interface, you 
can now mix in secondary audio with little to no crossbleed from whoever is on the mic. 
All this, and the microphone is completely USB-powered, the latency kept at a minimum 
as the headphone jack is closer to the signal than a computer’s or mixer’s headphone 
jack. The G-Track is a completely portable studio condenser mic solution; for a pod-
caster into music, mixing, or simply on-the-go, this mic’s potential can really get the 
audiophile’s creative juices going.

CHAPTER 2  Getting the Gadgets That Make a Podcast Go      49
And that’s it! You’re ready to record with your USB or FireWire mixer. Now with 
headphones on your head and some toying around, you can set levels on your 
mixer good for recording.
Before filing away the reference manual that came with your mixer, be sure you 
know how things work. Buttons like the Mix to Control Room suddenly make sense 
to you as opposed to being “that button that needs to be down when I record.” 
Getting a grasp of how things work on your mixer only makes you a better pod-
caster, so keep that reference manual close by and set aside a few pockets of time 
to clock in some reading time with it.
Accessorize! Accessorize! Accessorize!
A microphone and a mixing board are just the beginning when it comes to putting 
together your audio suite. You now need to add the final touches, as Martha Stew-
art would no doubt tell you if she were helping you with this process. Now when 
it comes to accessories, Martha might make suggestions like a doily for the mic 
stand or a sweet, hand-knitted cover for the mixer. When we talk about accesso-
ries, we have something different in mind. Here are some optional add-ons that 
can help you produce a rock-solid podcast:
»
» Headphones: Headphones help you monitor yourself as you speak. That may 
seem a little indulgent, but by hearing your voice, you can catch before 
playback any odd trip-ups, slurred words, or missed pronunciations.
We suggest you invest in good headphones before you spend a lot of money 
on a better mic, or else you won’t know how good the microphone is. Good 
headphones are nice to have for monitoring, but really show their value 
during the editing and mastering process.
Another advantage with headphones is they have better sound quality than 
your computer’s speakers as well as reduce ambient noise around you if you 
purchase what are called closed-ear headphones. Keep it simple for your first 
time out with a pair of the Sennheiser HD202 closed-ear headphones for 
around $35. These headphones end in a 1⁄8-inch jack but come with an 
adaptor that makes them a ¼-inch stereo male jack (as shown in Figure 2-7), 
plugging directly into your mixing board.

Bose Noise Cancelling stereo headphones, going for $300, promise the highest 
quality for audio listening. Note, we say listening. Not recording and editing. Any 
headphones you see listed as noise-cancelling are going to be terrific for 
listening to audio, but those headphones aren’t the best for recording and 
editing. You want to be able to hear the noise that these headphones cancel 
out so that you can eliminate it before a word is recorded. The best noise 
reduction and elimination happens before and during recording, not after-
ward. For podcast production, stick with closed-ear headphones sans the 
noise-cancelling feature.
»
» Cables: As mentioned in the section “Investing in a high-end mic,” earlier in the 
chapter, your newfangled microphone may arrive without any cable — and 
buying the wrong cable can be easy if you don’t know jack (so to speak). So 
check the mic’s connector before you buy. With many high-end mics, the 
connectors aren’t the typical RCA prongs or the ¼-inch jack shown in Figure 2-7; 
instead, you use a three-prong connection: a 3-pin XLR male plug. It connects to 
a 3-pin XLR female plug, as shown in Figure 2-8.
To plug a microphone into your mixer, you want to specify a 3-pin XLR-to-XLR 
male-to-female cord; the female end connects to the mic, the male end to the 
mixer. These cables begin at $9 and work their way up, depending on the 
length of the cord and quality of the inputs.
»
» Microphone stands: On receiving the microphone and possibly its shock-
mount, you may notice the attachment for a mic stand . . . but no mic stand 
comes with your new mic. It’s your responsibility to provide one, and although 
that may sound like an easy buy, your options for mic stands are many, each 
with its advantages.
FIGURE 2-8: 
XLR male and 
female plugs, 
standard plugs 
for phantom-
powered 
microphones.

CHAPTER 2  Getting the Gadgets That Make a Podcast Go      51
A simple desktop mic stand can run you around $10 and is the most basic of 
setups. When shopping for the right height and make, you’ll notice other 
stands like a boom mic stand around the $100 range. The type of mic stand 
that is best for you depends on what you want it to do and how you want to 
work around it. With the inexpensive desktop stand, you’re ready to go 
without the extra hassle of positioning and securing a boom stand to your 
desk. The boom stand, though, frees up space on your desk, allowing for 
show notes and extra space for you to record and mix in. Consult your budget 
and see what works for you.
»
» Pop filters and windscreens: Go to any music store and ask for pop filters 
and windscreens, which are both shown in Figure 2-9. Both devices can help 
soften explosive consonants (percussive ones like B and P) during a recording 
session. A windscreen can also reduce some ambient room noise. Using 
both on one mic could be overkill, but these are terrific add-ons to your 
microphones.
It is worth mentioning that there are DIY tutorials on YouTube, blogs, and 
elsewhere that will show you how to make pop filters with a stick and panty 
hose. Just remember: You get what you pay for. With the time, experimenta-
tion, and jerry-rigging to save yourself $10-$20, it’s less stress for you to just 
go and pick up a proper pop filter.
FIGURE 2-9:

noise and

Building Your Podcast’s 
Digital Workstation
A
fter you have your recording equipment in place, plugged in, and running, 
it’s time to look at audio-editing software packages. These are the applica-
tions that help you take that block of audio marble and chisel the podcast 
hidden within it. (If you are looking to branch into video podcasting or incorpo-
rating video segments into your podcasting feed, see Chapter 9 for information 
about video-editing software.)
As with digital photo editors, DVD-authoring software, and word processors, 
software for audio comes in all sizes and all costs, ranging from free to roughly an 
entire paycheck (or three). Like any software package, the lower the cost, the 
­simpler the product and the easier it is to understand, navigate, and use for 
recording. However, as the software grows more complex (and expensive), the 
features that offer advantages for pro-level work become abundantly clear. In this 
chapter, we run down some of the audio recording/editing software that might be 
right for you.
When you have software and hardware in place, test your setup to make sure 
everything works. Check your application’s preferences to make sure that your 
sound input and output are going through your mixer, bring up the volume on the 
channel on the mixing board that your microphone is connected to, and then lis-
ten to yourself through your headphones. Just make sure everything is running as 
promised so you can jump right in and get recording.

Budget-Friendly Software
Whoever said, “You can’t get something for nothing . . .” didn’t know about pod-
casting. It’s amazing what kind of product you can turn out with little or no mon-
etary investment.
Audacity: The risk-free option for all
Audacity (shown in Figure 3-1) is a piece of software that quickly became a pod-
caster’s best friend. It’s easy to see why: It’s free and simple to use. It’s available 
for download at http://audacity.audio.
Designed by volunteers who simply wanted to give something cool back to the 
Internet, Audacity is designed for a variety of audio capabilities such as importing, 
mixing, editing, and exporting audio. For podcasters, it’s become the must-have 
tool for recording voice straight off a computer. It’s also compatible with 
­Windows, Macintosh, and Linux. (We want to send a big thank you to the volun-
teers who went out of their way to show that yes, software can be made available 
for any platform, provided the creators are driven enough to make it happen!)

Cakewalk’s SONAR Home Studio  
for Windows: A first step in running  
with the pros
Audacity is an excellent piece of software for the basics, but what if you desire 
more control over the capabilities and features of your audio-editing package? Are 
you looking for more recording options, additional audio filters, built-in multi-
track recording, and prerecorded music loops? (Gads, what some people will do to 
set a mood or a tone for a podcast.)
SONAR Home Studio (www.cakewalk.com/Products/SONAR-Home-Studio) is the 
consumer line of Cakewalk’s SONAR audio software line. If your computer has the 
horsepower and the hard drive space, you can buy SONAR Home Studio for around 
$50. This impressive digital audio workstation (or DAW) is available for Windows 
10 and Windows 8 or 8.1.
SONAR Home Studio (shown in Figure 3-2) offers its users some serious goodies:
»
» Record audio from a microphone or other media (CD, LP, cassette, or Internet 
audio stream).
»
» Display and edit beat-by-beat with audio waveform displays.
»
» Pro-grade audio engineering tools included: Chorus/Flanger, Compressor/
Gate, Tempo Delay, Modifier, Reverb, and other post-production effects.
»
» Support for MP3, WAV, and WMA files.

56      PART 1  Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency
SONAR Home Studio allows users to record, edit, mix, and produce audio compo-
sitions, whether it is an original score for your podcast, a continuous music mix, 
or just you and your own personal soundtrack. Between its easy audio-editing 
features and Cakewalk’s collection of original audio samples (called Cakewalk 
Loopmasters Content Collection), it’s a breeze to set your own themes and special 
effects.
GarageBand: Moby in your Mac!
SONAR Home Studio is an economic audio package for the Windows user looking 
to go beyond Audacity, but what about Mac users? For people in the minority of 
the computer world, it’s always a frustration to hear software developers say, 
“No, we won’t be making this product available for Mac users.” Sometimes Mac 
users seem to be denied the coolest toys and utilities because they just aren’t 
offered for the Mac operating system.
Apparently, the Apple crew heard about this injustice, and shortly after the iPod 
took off, there came a software gem that made it more than cool to be a Mac 
user — especially one who’s into podcasting. Mac-using podcasters call this gem 
GarageBand.
With hundreds of music loops that can easily switch from one instrument to 
another, GarageBand (shown in Figure  3-3) makes royalty-free music easy to 
compose. Many of the loops are editable and, with a bit of tweaking, can set the 
right mood for your podcast. GarageBand has a few new additions:

CHAPTER 3  Building Your Podcast’s Digital Workstation      57
»
» Multitrack recording supports simultaneous tracks recording independent 
audio sources all in one recording session.
»
» With the Multi-Take feature, you can now do multiple readings or segments 
and save them as separate files. Then you can pick which one you want for 
the final.
»
» You can see a display of the music, with actual notation, in real time.
»
» You can choose to record your podcast as a Music Composition (Old School 
podcasting with GarageBand) or take advantage of the extra features 
available in the Podcast mode; note the extra track at the top in Figure 3-3.
»
» You can save the recordings as loops in the GarageBand library.
But perhaps the most amazing aspect of GarageBand, as reported by Arts Tech-
nica at https://arstechnica.com/apple/2017/04/iwork-and-ilife-apps-are- 
now-free-for-old-and-new-mac-and-ios-users, is that GarageBand is now free 
for anyone using a Mac OS or iOS device.
GarageBand’s most appealing asset (apart from the fact that it is free now) is its 
hundreds of sampled instruments available in loops. You can easily edit and splice 
together these loops with other loops to create original music beds of whatever 
length you choose. Prerecorded beds range from Asian drum ensembles to Norwe-
gian Folk Fiddles to Blues Harmonica to Emotional Piano reminiscent of films like 
The Fault in Our Stars and Sense and Sensibility.
FIGURE 3-3: 
GarageBand 
(pictured here in 
the Voice mode) 
is easy to use and 
easy to have a 
blast with.

58      PART 1  Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency
GarageBand also provides a capability — with many (not all) of the samplings — 
to create your own musical theme. Sure, some instruments may sound better than 
others, but you might — with a bit of trial and error — create an original melody 
that serves as the best royalty-free intro and exit for your podcast.
If you’re planning to do a bit of composing in GarageBand, be warned. Garage-
Band is a lot of fun but can easily soak up free time that you would normally dedi-
cate to recording. So if you need to get in touch with your inner Mozart, set aside 
a good-size pocket of time to put together your desired riffs. You have many 
options to choose from; as with podcasting, it’s best not to rush the process.
GarageBand is easy to tinker with, navigate, and understand within a short span 
of time. Plenty of terrific books are available for mastering all the nuances of 
GarageBand. We cannot praise this application enough  — and with expansion 
packs from Apple that add instruments, riffs, and loops to your GarageBand 
(always updated and stocked at the App Store), this unassuming software offers a 
lot to the podcaster.
SHARING WITH THE REST OF THE CLASS
We’re particularly keen on GarageBand which gives you the option to organize your final 
AIFF files in an iTunes playlist. When you’re done with that particular recording session 
(what GarageBand refers to as a song), choose Share ➪ Song to iTunes. Before your 
final audio is exported, you are offered options to tag your audio with a variety of 
­credits, including your own playlist. Once exporting concludes, iTunes opens with your 
new playlist. See Chapter 10 for details on adding ID3 tags.

CHAPTER 3  Building Your Podcast’s Digital Workstation      59
WireTap Studio: Recording  
and editing made easier
If you’re not interested in the musicality of GarageBand, Mac users have another 
handy application for recording podcasts and it comes with a few features 
not  found in Audacity. WireTap Studio Pro (www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/ 
wiretap and shown in Figure 3-4) is unique in its ability to record audio from 
nearly any source — not only coming in from microphones and musical instru-
ments, but also from any audio streaming and live audio chats from Skype and 
iChat. WireTap even allows you to mix in music from your iTunes libraries!
WireTap sports the familiar features that Audacity, GarageBand, and SONAR 
­possess — such as converting analog music to digital; preparing MP3 files specifi-
cally for podcasting (by adding ID3 tags, setting bandwidth, and so on); and sup-
porting audio formats such as WAV, AIFF, and MP3. The latest version of WireTap 
offers some appealing capabilities:
»
» Records incoming audio from microphones or other input devices
»
» Records and encodes audio into a wide variety of file formats, including all the 
popular ones needed for podcasting (AIFF, WAV, MP3, AAC)
»
» Simultaneously records two sources of incoming audio (on a per-application 
basis) into separate tracks
»
» Provides a lossless/non-destructive waveform editor
FIGURE 3-4:

» Offers automated options for scheduling recordings
Retailing for about $70, WireTap Studio is a reliable application for Macintosh 
podcasters and prides itself in being a one-stop shop for podcasting needs. It’s a 
non-Apple product that can record in Apple’s audio-compression formats, easily 
records streaming audio signals that tend to elude other audio-recording and 
editing software, and offers editing tools for both audio and ID3 tags so you can 
create the podcast from beginning to end, making it ready for upload.
The Sky’s the Limit: Big-Budget Software
If you’re lucky enough to have unlimited funds and resources to build your pod-
casting studio, this section on software is for you. Most podcasts are working on 
the bare-bones plan, and so far, the investment in the equipment we’ve recom-
mended (in Chapter 2) is for a budget of under $500 — provided you feel like 
making an investment in a professional microphone, mixing board, or software.
You may hear podcasters say, “content is king,” meaning it doesn’t matter how 
good you sound if you don’t have anything to say. What makes a good podcast is 
the same whether you’re on a budget of $0, $500, or $Ridiculous.
The difference is in the sound you can get. For the corporate entity, government 
agency, or professional organization venturing into podcasting, sound quality is 
crucial as your reputation and experience are now being socially tested. Do you not 
bother with the details, or do you raise the quality bar? Commercial podcasting 
demands nothing less than the best in audio quality. Depending on your budget 
and the future of your podcast, you can purchase and set up the higher-end audio 
hardware.
If you want to push its envelope and have the bucks, high-end audio software 
gives you full control over every aspect of the audio you’re recording.
Adobe Audition
At one time, a favorite software application was CoolEdit. But when Adobe  
Systems purchased it and repackaged the software as Adobe Audition (shown in 

CHAPTER 3  Building Your Podcast’s Digital Workstation      61
Figure  3-5), it got even better. Audition (www.adobe.com/products/audition.
html) is offered as part of the Adobe Creative Cloud membership for under  
$20 monthly. Audition’s features are nothing short of awesome:
»
» 128 tracks available to the user
»
» Can record 32 different sources simultaneously
»
» Offers 50 digital sound effects to enhance your audio tracks
»
» Provides 5,000 royalty-free loops that can be easily edited and compiled to 
create your own music beds
»
» Offers Surround Encoder for 5.1 surround sound mixing for audio only or 
integration into an Adobe Premiere Pro project
»
» Offers audio restoration tools like Click/Pop Eliminators and Noise Reduction 
that can restore recordings from vinyl and cassette recordings; remedy pops, 
hisses, hums; and fix clipped audio
What makes Audition so appealing to heavily engineered productions such as 
P.G.  Holyfield’s epic Murder at Avedon Hill (https://scribl.com/books/P4C82/
murder-at-avedon-hill) and the ongoing Secret World Chronicle (http://
secretworldchronicle.com) is the complete control users have over the audio. 
Audition 
gives you dominion over pitch, 
wavelength, time-stretching, 
­background-noise removal, and Dolby 5.1 stereo output, making it a staple in the 
digital audio industry.

Audition runs on Windows and Macintosh platforms. If you know your podcast 
needs a professional polish and you are ready to make the investment and the 
jump to higher grade software, Audition may be the option for you.
Apple Logic Pro X
Apple Logic Pro X (www.apple.com/logic-pro) is another software package in the 
industry that is carving out for itself a place with professionals. Designed to be the 
next step after GarageBand, Logic Pro X (shown in Figure 3-6) has been given 
features built for Mac-based podcasters:
»
» Supports multitrack recording.
»
» Displays multiple audio takes in a single window. After you select your desired 
takes, Logic Pro X compiles them for a final composite — complete with 
crossfades (the simultaneous fading from one audio source into another) — 
creating seamless playback for the end result.
»
» Copies audio effects and EQ settings from another clip — setting them on an 
audio clipboard for quick access and application or saving them as a preset 
for future use.
»
» Features specific functions for producing podcasts, such as ID3 tagging.
»
» Outputs multitrack audio projects into 5.1 surround sound.
»
» Offers multiple audio formats for export including WAV, AIFF, and many others.

production.

CHAPTER 3  Building Your Podcast’s Digital Workstation      63
Apple Logic Pro X offers incredible options for the audio professional and the 
up-and-coming podcaster. For $200 from the App Store, you can accomplish a lot 
with it. Tee does, and swears by it.
Gluing It Together with RSS
The hardware (mics and mixers) and the software (GarageBand and Audacity) are 
necessary to record audio and create the podcast media file. That’s the fun and 
creative part. But to make your recording a podcast, you need to get your hands 
dirty on the tedious and technical parts and add one more three-letter acronym to 
your vocabulary: RSS.
We’ve helped across these editions a huge number of podcasters get started — 
and in nearly every case, the RSS step is the biggest source of confusion. So, to 
get the basics out of the way, XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a markup 
language like HTML (the building blocks of the Internet), and RSS (Really Simple 
Syndication) is a file format built on XML. XML’s purpose is to allow systems such 
as computers, network devices, and other gadgets to exchange information in a 
structured format. The RSS file is that bit of information that the podcaster pub-
lishes so others can use their podcatching software to check for new content auto-
matically. Without the RSS file, you are not podcasting.
If that somewhat technical explanation doesn’t do it for you, try this old school 
analogy about deliverable content. Consider journalists for publications like The 
Washington Post, The New York Times, Vanity Fair, or Wired Magazine as authorities on 
what is happening within your passions in life. Whether the subject matter covers 
Apple computers, the Boston Red Sox, or The Beatles, you know these journalists 
are trusted experts in their fields, or maybe they are fellow fans just as passionate 
as you are. These journalists, if they are truly worth the ink used in their articles, 
are always creating new and unique content with every new issue or publication.
IS IT SOUP YET? NOT YET . . .
Regardless of the incarnations of this book or other books published on podcasting, there 
are people who think if media is posted on a blog or website and a graphic is placed over 
it that reads Podcast, you are podcasting media. No, you’re not. If you post a video on 
YouTube (www.youtube.com) and then circulate that link through a blog, you are still 
not podcasting. Podcasting is a delivery of media from your blog to a consumer using 
RSS. Without that delivery, you are not casting anything, pod or otherwise. A podcast only 
happens when you have these three elements in place — a website or blog, some form of 
media, and an accompanying RSS feed to deliver the media relevant to the website or blog.

64      PART 1  Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency
What if you want that content? Well, you’ve got options. You can check the news-
stand daily. Maybe it’s there, or maybe it is sold out on that day so you come back 
another time to see if the latest issue is there. Another way to get that content is 
to subscribe to the magazine or newspaper, and the content is delivered to your 
doorstep.
Here the role of the magazine is filled by the media created by the podcaster, and 
the RSS is the delivery mechanism that sends your podcast to people who sub-
scribe. Just like you would with a magazine or newspaper.
No school like the old school, huh?
As a podcaster, your job is to make sure you keep the RSS updated and current 
each time you post a new podcast media file. Lucky for you (and us too), plenty of 
software solutions make this step a breeze.
IT’S ALL ABOUT THE <ENCLOSURE>, BABY
If you already have a blog, you’re probably already generating an RSS feed — or can do 
so. Although podcatching clients can read this existing RSS feed, the feed needs to 
include the <enclosure> tag for podcasting to work.
Dave Winer invented the <enclosure> tag in early 2001 for embedding links to large 
audio, video, or other rich media elements into an RSS feed. At the time, Dave and 
Adam Curry were trying to solve the click-and-wait problems inherent in big files such as 
audio and video. Typically, if a user clicked a link to a 30MB file, several minutes would 
drag by before the file was completely downloaded to the user’s hard drive and was 
usable. Not a good user experience, regardless of what’s in the file.
With the advent of the <enclosure> RSS element, users could subscribe to places 
where they expected large files as a regular occurrence and move the downloading of 
those files to the early hours of the morning, when the users were snug in bed and a 
ten-minute download was no big deal.
Of course, users back then had to be technically savvy to take advantage of this new RSS 
element. It wasn’t until the summer of 2004 that Adam Curry wrote what most consider 
the first podcatching client — a simple, user-friendly desktop program that extracted 
enclosed media files from RSS 2.0 feeds. And behold! Podcasting was born.

CHAPTER 3  Building Your Podcast’s Digital Workstation      65
Keep it simple and get a blog!
If you’re looking to spend the least amount of time dinking around with an RSS 
feed, look no further than starting up a blog. Easy to set up and often free of 
charge, blogs make the process of generating and updating RSS feeds insanely 
easy by doing it automatically.
You can choose from dozens of blog software packages (also called engines), each 
with a variety of bells and whistles that are designed to make your updates 
(including your RSS feed) as easy and/or customizable as possible. For a crash 
course in how blogs do what they do, check out Blogging For Dummies, by Brad Hill 
(Wiley). The title can help you choose which blog engine might be right for you. 
Meanwhile, here are a few options we prefer:
»
» WordPress (https://wordpress.org): Perhaps the most popular blogging 
solution in writers’ eyes, WordPress has many advantages over other 
free blogs. Not only is it easy to install and get running, but it also supports 
podcasting out of the box. When you incorporate the PowerPress plug-in 
(available at https://wordpress.org/plugins/powerpress), podcasting 
takes on a whole new level of user-friendly options. There are also thou-
sands of WordPress and user-developed templates that can be used as is or 
customized to fit your specific look and feel for your podcast. Oh, and it’s free. 
To make incorporation into your website seamless, many hosting companies 
like DreamHost (http://dreamhost.com) and GoDaddy (www.godaddy.com) 
offer packages that have WordPress preinstalled or installed with a one-click 
option. Figure 3-7 shows the WordPress signup page.
If you choose to go the WordPress route, pay attention to the web address. 
There’s Wordpress.org and Wordpress.com. The .org flavor is where you can 
download the software and install it on your server of choice and may involve 
a bit of technical work. The .com site has the software already installed and 
you just configure it; however, the configuration options are a bit more limited.
There are two basic options where to put your blog, and prices and products 
vary from vendor to vendor. The non-hosted model blog is where you get to 
choose the blog engine, a great option if there is a specific engine you want to 
use. However, there is more work involved with setting it up and maintaining 
it. The other option, the hosted model, keeps things simple. The choice of blog 
engine is made for you. The trade-off for flexibility is ease of use.
»
» LibSyn (http://libsyn.com): Don’t be surprised if Liberated Syndication 
turns up quite a lot in this book. LibSyn, still going strong after launching 
in 2004, is a combined blog/hosting company specifically designed for 
podcasting. Although it may not address all your needs, its ease of use and 
all-in-one nature should not be passed up. Some podcasters choose to use 

66      PART 1  Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency
LibSyn as their hosted solution; others use it to store their podcast files while 
their blog is on a non-hosted solution somewhere else. Either way, we think 
LibSyn’s pricing is quite reasonable, starting at $5 per month.
»
» Podbean (www.podbean.com): Another popular all-in-one option with 
the added support of a podcast directory optimized for mobile devices, 
Podbean combines online hosting packages, podcast publishing tools, and 
crowdfunding services. Podbean, both in its website and mobile app, offers a 
user-friendly interface integrating feed and media management, syndication, 
and analytics, along with promotion through popular social media platforms 
like Facebook and Twitter. All this is available through affordable, flat-rate 
hosting plans. If you are starting off with baby steps, and then looking to take 
a deeper dive into podcasting, then Podbean is the right option for you and 
your podcast.
Doing it by hand
What’s this about podcasting by hand? Are you crazy? No, seriously — generating 
an XML file in RSS 2.0 format isn’t overly difficult. It’s just extremely easy to

mess up! Sure, you could open Notepad, TextEdit, or any text editor, download a 
few examples, and generate your own code, but we advise against it.
However, some code warriors  — in the same vein of hand-coding HTML, 
­JavaScript, and other markup languages — insist on composing their own code 
from the ground up. You glutton for punishment, you.
Whether you are running your podcast on a home-spun, handmade RSS feed, or 
letting WordPress handle the heavy lifting, you’re going to want to make sure 
your feed is solid and ready for prime time. That’s when Feed Validator is your 
best friend and harshest critic. Go to http://feedvalidator.org and enter your 
feed’s URL (not the host blog or site, but the feed itself) and then click the ­Validate 
­button. Feed Validator tells you whether your RSS is air-tight. You can also find 
the full technical specifications for RSS 2.0 and a few answers to questions you 
may have about RSS. This is a great place to visit not only when you’re about to 
launch a podcast but also when your feed suddenly stops working. When 
­something is borked in your podcast, Feed Validator is the first place you will 
want to visit.
Podcast Management 101
Unless you already have hosting taken care of, you’re going to need a place on the 
web to put your stuff. You know — your podcast media files, RSS feed, and show 
notes for your podcast. You also need a way to get them up there.
Getting a hosting provider is a breeze, with hundreds of companies all vying for 
your precious, hard-earned money each month. The good news is that all this 
competition has brought down the cost of hosting packages significantly. The bad 
news is that you must go through a lot of clutter to reach the right selection.
This section covers the basic needs for most beginning podcasts and mentions a 
few pitfalls to watch out for. In Chapter 11, we get into the process of actually 
moving your files to your host.
Don’t rush into a hosting agreement just yet. We suggest reading the rest of this 
chapter as well as Chapter 11 before forking over your credit card. We cover lots of 
good information that can help you narrow your choices.
When you’re comparing hosting plans, try not to get bogged down in the number 
of email addresses, MySQL databases, subdomains, and the like. All those ­features 
have their own purposes, but as a podcaster, you have only two worries: how 
many podcasts the site can hold and how much bandwidth you get.

68      PART 1  Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency
Size does matter
Podcast media files, especially video files, are big. Unlike bloggers, podcasters eat 
up server space. Where simple text files and a few images take up a relatively 
small space, podcast media files tend to be in the 5MB to 50MB range. And that’s 
just for audio. For video, that size can double.
Here are some suggestions for zeroing in on what you need storage-space-wise:
»
» Think about how many podcasts you want to keep online and plan accordingly. 
If you have a plan that isn’t constrained by storage space, then you don’t need 
to worry about it.
»
» Consider the amount of server space you’ll need to host your blogging 
software, databases, text, and image files. For example, if Tee wanted to keep 
all episodes of The Shared Desk, The Ministry of Peculiar Occurrences, and Happy 
Hour from the Tower online, he would easily need several gigabytes of space as 
one of these shows first went online in 2010. Podcasting did help quite a bit in 
creating a need for server space.
Podcasters should look for hosting plans that include at least 3GB of storage space. 
As of this writing, several host providers charge less than $10 per month for that 
much space, and more.
Bandwidth demystified
Of equal importance to storage space is bandwidth, an elusive and often-­
misunderstood attribute of web hosting that is critical to podcasters. Bandwidth 
refers to the online space needed to handle the amount of stuff you push out of 
your website every month. The bigger the files, the more bandwidth consumed. 
Compounding the problem, the more requests for the files, the more bandwidth 
consumed.
For instance, the bandwidth for Chuck Tomasi’s Technorama is over 10 terabytes a 
month — that’s impressive. Why so huge? Chuck and his co-host Kreg just cele-
brated their 500th episode. They’ve been at podcasting since the very beginning, 
and at their initial launch, the amount of information exchanged (read: down-
loads) was modest, but then people started talking. With the rise in popularity 
(thanks to top-shelf interviews with people in the science and entertainment 
industries), their downloads increased. So did the demands on bandwidth. Web 
hosts, in situations like this, must consider when it’s time to allocate a larger 
bandwidth package to handle a show — and that means more cash outlay for you.

CHAPTER 3  Building Your Podcast’s Digital Workstation      69
And therein lies the double-edged sword of success. Most podcasters want more 
listeners  — and that means more podcatching clients requesting the podcast 
media files. Bottom line: The more popular your show gets, the more bandwidth 
is being consumed every month.
To simplify, pretend that you produce one show each week, and your show requires 
10MB of bandwidth. You publish the show on Monday, and your 100 subscribers 
receive your show that evening. You’ve just consumed 1,000MB of bandwidth 
(100 × 10MB) for that week. But next week, more people have found out about your 
incredibly amazing show, and now you have 200 subscribers. Next Monday, your 
bandwidth increases to 2,000MB, which gets added to your previous week’s total 
to bring you up to 3,000MB. The new listeners were so happy, they also download 
the previous week’s show, tacking on an extra 1,000MB. You’ve just consumed 
4,000MB (or 4GB) of bandwidth for the month. You still have two weeks to go in 
the month, and if your numbers continue to climb like this, you will be burning 
through bandwidth (and your web host budget) quickly!
Generally, the longer your podcast episodes are, the more bandwidth you will 
need. If you find a plan that offers unlimited bandwidth, the problem is solved. 
Otherwise, you’ll want to try and find a plan that’s high in the gigabytes. If you 
have a podcast that’s both long and popular, start looking at plans that offer 1TB 
(that’s terabytes) or more.
You have ways to avoid the issue of bandwidth, or at least make it less of a concern 
even if you have large ambitions — as well as files. Chapter 11 talks about some 
podcast-specific and some advanced hosting options. Even if you don’t think 
you’ll have to worry about bandwidth, it’s a section to pay close attention to 
because you’ll likely be more popular — and perhaps wordier — than you think.

Go, Go, Power 
Podcasters!
U
p to this point, you have been building your podcast studio with your home 
computer as the center of your digital audio workstation. You have a mixer 
plugged with a few mics, and you have your software up and running. Or 
maybe you have a USB mic hooked up to your desktop computer (directly, and not 
through a USB hub, remember?), and you have Audacity primed and ready to go. 
Welcome to your new audio recording studio.
But hold on — what if you want to record someplace else? What do you need to do 
to pack up the whole recording unit and take this show on the road? What if your 
podcast isn’t about where you are but where you are going?
That’s why we’re spending some quality time on portability in this chapter. The 
aim is to be able to pack up your podcast and set up wherever you stop. Yes, yes, 
yes, we know — podcasts are portable by nature, but we’re talking about packing 
up the studio and working on location. You’re not going to have the podcast here. 
In this chapter, you’re taking the studio to go.
When you have software and hardware in place, especially when you are working 
remotely, test your setup to make sure everything works. Look at your System 
Preferences to make sure you are working with the proper sound input and output 
sources, make certain your levels are solid, and then run a quick sound check 

72      PART 1  Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency
through your headphones. It is a good idea to make sure everything is running as 
promised so you can jump right in and get recording.
Podcasting with Your Laptop
So, you want to have a podcast that has that studio quality sound, but you want 
more than one microphone, and to be able to have a bit of control over the levels. 
This is when you would want to invest in a preamplifier or a preamp. To under-
stand what a preamp is, you should know a few more technical matters around 
microphones.
Microphones, be they condenser or dynamic, record their signals at mic-level. This 
is the signal created from the internal diaphragm moving back and forth against 
a magnet in a wire coil, generating an electrical signal. It’s a clean signal, but very 
weak. The best audio is recorded not at mic-level, but at line-level. You get line-
level signals coming out of electric guitars, keyboards, and other instruments. To 
get a weaker mic-level signal boosted to the line-level signal, you need more 
power. The preamp, sometimes a separate unit or built into a mixer board or a USB 
microphone, provides that power to bring the mic-level signal to line-level with-
out adding any noise to the original signal.
Now that you know what a preamp is, how about a few options for you to 
consider?
Mackie Onyx Blackjack
The Mackie Onyx Blackjack (shown in Figure  4-1) offers you all the power and 
­reliability of a mixer in a small, compact design. The best part of working with this 
preamp is it has zero latency when recording. This means there is no delay for 
when you speak and when you hear your voice while recording. You can adjust the 
Blackjack’s buffer settings to maximize your computer’s processing ability as well.
Blackjack also offers podcasters:
»
» A preamp bus-powered via USB
»
» Two XLR connections delivering 48V phantom power
»
» A 25-degree inclination by design, allowing for full view of all controls at all times
»
» An all-metal chassis that gives the Blackjack built-like-a-tank durability
»
» Onboard analog-to-digital conversion, granting your amplified signal with the 
lowest noise and distortion possible

CHAPTER 4  Go, Go, Power Podcasters!      73
Shure MVi
Shure Audio, a manufacturer we named back in Chapter 2, is no stranger to setting 
the bar for audio engineering and recording on looking at the prevalence and rel-
evance of their audio gear. With the rise of podcasting, Shure set out to create gear 
that would capture quality sound, and the MVi is a compact, USB-powered preamp 
ready to power your microphone (or microphones, if you employ a splitter) 
accordingly. Figure 4-2 shows Shure’s MVi.
The MVi offers a podcaster-on-the-go:
»
» USB connectivity for easy plug-and-play with optional iOS connectivity with 
iPhones and iPads
»
» Touch-sensitive panel for control over five different DSP presets, headphone 
volume, and more
»
» Built-in headphone jack for real-time monitoring
»
» One XLR connection offering 48V phantom power option
FIGURE 4-1:

extremely 
portable.

the new MOTIV 
series, is a

74      PART 1  Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency
If you want to record on location, you could use Studio Condenser mics which, 
because of their sensitivity, will pick up a lot of the background, setting a nice 
ambiance for your podcast. Depending on your environment, though, there might 
be too much ambiance for your interview. This is why, in most on-location set-
tings, dynamic mics are preferred. You will still get some background noise, but 
not as pronounced when using Studio Condenser mics.
The Shure MVi can serve as a preamp for up to two microphones, powered by USB, 
just as the Onyx Blackjack. With an even more compact design, the MVi makes 
your portable studio even more so.
Podcasting with Your Mobile Devices
Development of mobile devices  — smartphones like the iPhone and Samsung 
­Galaxy, and tablets like Apple’s iPad and the Windows Surface  — has been 
astounding to watch, especially in the past five years. With cloud computing 
becoming more and more prevalent not only in personal lifestyles but now in 
­corporate sectors, mobile devices big and small are quickly becoming the new 
alternative to portable computing. When once it would require an entire backpack 
and pockets of accessories to replicate the office, mobile devices have reduced 
portability to a single pocket and a connection to the Internet.
As an example, Nobilis Reed of Nobilis Erotica and This Kaiju Life has a portable 
recording rig with a USB microphone, a smartphone, and Dropbox (see 
Figure  4-3). His sessions are all sent to cloud storage (relieving demands on 
the phone) and are easily accessed by his editing computer.
Now, leading names in microphone technology are looking to future trends and 
are releasing new audio gear designed for the portability you come expect from 
smartphones and tablets.
You may notice the featured photos throughout this chapter are somewhat Mac-
centric as both Tee and Chuck are using iPads and iPhones. This does not affect 
the ability of these innovations to float easily from platform-to-platform. What 
we showcase here, equipment-wise, does not discriminate from one operating 
system to another. It’s all in the ability to connect.

A Shure Thing: The MV5 and MV51
Shure Audio’s MOTIV series not only includes a preamp but also a new line of 
microphones built to be portable, but still able to yield superior audio recording 
quality Shure is known for.
The MV5
The MV5 (shown in Figure 4-4) packs a lot of audio punch in its small, sleek, retro 
design and its economic cost of just under $100. Offering you professional-quality 
audio when recording, the MV5 provides latency-free headphone monitoring and 
quick-and-easy plug-and-play capability.
Other features of the MV5 include:
»
» Retro-design includes desktop stand and adjustable position for microphone

76      PART 1  Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency
The MV51
The MV51 (shown in Figure 4-4) is much like its small counterpart, the MV5, in 
its retro design, ability to capture professional-quality audio, and zero latency 
when live monitoring. Beyond that, the MV51 is a fantastic addition to your 
ultra-portable studio because of the additional features found only in this higher 
model:
»
» Quick-and-easy plug-and-play capability
»
» Retro-design includes pull-out stand, either for standing independently on a 
flat surface or fitting into a standard microphone stand
»
» Touch-sensitive panel for control over five different DSP presets, headphone 
volume, and more
»
» iOS and USB connectivity
»
» Built-in headphone jack for real-time monitoring
»
» Large-diaphragm condenser capsule offering wider audio range for recording
The MV51 is more than just a step up from the MV5. It promises to set a new stan-
dard in mobile recording. With its capability to capture clean audio, setup and 
recording is as simple as unlocking your mobile device and recording on your 
audio app of choice. You are also given advanced options such as either recording 
with one of the MV51’s onboard presets or simply recording flat, uncompressed, 
unaltered audio, offering you full control over post-production treatment. 
Whether in-studio or on-the-road, at $200 the Shure MV51 proves itself an asset 
in your mobile studio setup.

Two for the Røde: The VideoMic  
Me and smartLav+
Røde Microphones (http://en.rode.com) has made a name for itself in the 
podcasting circles (or the podosphere) since the early days. New Zealand’s first 
podcast author, Pip Ballantine (http://pjballantine.com), won the 2009 Sir 
Julius Voguel Award for her podcast Chasing the Bard, recording her epic fantasy on 
the Røde Podcaster (http://en.rode.com/microphones/podcaster). Pip still 
endorses the USB microphone, suggesting it to everyone building a new home 
studio on a tight budget.
Røde continues to provide podcasters with a complete array of mobile options for 
podcasters ready to take their recording out of the studio, and go one step further 
in specializing gear for smartphones. Why smartphones? Particularly in interview 
situations where sitting is not an option (press conferences, man on the street 
interviews, and so forth), you need your recording rig to be even more compact 
than a tablet. That is where your smartphone transforms faster than an Autobot 
(or a Decepticon, depending on the mobile OS you prefer) and becomes your 
recording studio.
VideoMic Me
Røde’s VideoMic Me (shown in Figure 4-5) at the cost of just under $60 upgrades 
your on-board smartphone microphone to higher-quality audio. Instead of that 
tinny quality found in most phone conversations and smartphone recordings, the 
VideoMic Me picks up a far wider range and frequency, while focusing the direc-
tion of the mic, yielding audio of a much higher quality. The accessory also comes 
with an optional mount for better mic stability and a windscreen to cut down on 
any unexpected weather elements you might encounter.
In turning smartphones into portable recording devices, you may find your 
recording riddled with intermittent static. This is RFI, or Radio Frequency Interfer-
ence. RFI occurs when a disturbance in frequency is generated by an external 
source — in this case, a second microphone — causing a degradation of a signal. 
Static. You can try recording in Airplane mode, but this prevents you from doing 
anything online (such as Facebook Live or Periscope), and even then, it is no guar-
antee. As always, test your mobile rig before trying to capture that once-in-a- 
lifetime recording!
smartLav+
For the podcast more about the host or for the interview where the interview host 
is edited out of the final show and only the subject’s voice remains, the smartLav+ 
at a cost similar to that of the VideoMic Me offers broadcast-quality audio for a 

78      PART 1  Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency
modest investment. The smartLav+ is a lavalier mic, meaning it is not held by or 
pointed at the subject but worn on lapels or the collar of a host or guest’s shirt. 
Unlike other lavalier mics that are connected to a wireless transmitter, the smart-
Lav+ connects directly into a smartphone or tablet headset jack and records using 
GarageBand, Røde’s own Rec app, or any other media-recording app of choice. 
A small windscreen is included to cut down on both wind noise and percussive 
vocal elements.
FIGURE 4-5: 
Røde’s VideoMic 
Me (top) 
transforms your 
smartphone into 
a handheld 
recording device.

CHAPTER 4  Go, Go, Power Podcasters!      79
The smartLav+ also features:
»
» A Kevlar reinforced cable, protecting your mic connection from unexpected 
stretching or fraying
»
» High-quality omni-directional condenser mic design
»
» A body design no larger than 4.5mm
At the time of this writing, many smartphones in use are still using headphone 
jacks. Before purchasing these suggested models or other attachments that turn 
your smartphone into an equally smart recorder, you will want to see how the 
accessory connects, just to assure you are picking up the accessory that is the right 
one for you.
When you find yourself in the kind of setting where your podcast studio needs to 
fit in the palm of your hand, Røde offers options that will not let you down. There 
is a reason that Podcasting For Dummies recommended Røde’s products back in the 
second edition and continues to do so now. We use them, and yield great results 
on account of that company’s work. So, if your tablet is not portable enough, con-
sider Røde or other audio vendors that convert your preferred smartphone into a 
super-portable recording rig.
Podcasting with Portable Recorders
Up to this point we have gone from podcasting with laptop computers to podcast-
ing with mobile devices. Now we take everything we need to record and reduce 
it to a fully contained recording studio that fits comfortably in the palm of your 
hand.
Zoom-Zoom-Zoom: The Handy  
Recorder Line
In 2006, Zoom Technologies (https://www.zoom.co.jp) introduced its own 
series of portable recorders that raised the bar for not only portable podcasting 
but for portable recorders across the market. With each new model, Zoom upped 
its own game. Now, Zoom offers an entire line of lightweight, unobtrusive, 
all-in-one solutions for portable podcasting; a new standard arrived.

80      PART 1  Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency
Zoom H1
The H1 Handy Recorder is the smallest, sleekest of the Handy Recorder series. It 
also has the simplest of interfaces: one button. And yes, that is the one you use to 
get the recording underway. Along with ease of use, the H1 offers:
»
» Onboard X/Y microphones configuration.
»
» Recording formats include both WAV and MP3 in different bitrates and 
varying quality.
»
» Reference speaker and tripod mounts built-in.
»
» 1/8-inch external mic input and 1/8-inch stereo line output.
»
» Records directly to MicroSD and SDHC cards up to 32 GB capacity.
Zoom H2n
The H2n is the next step up and the evolution from the popular H2 that debuted 
over a decade ago. The new and improved H2n makes portable recording a piece 
of cake:
»
» Five built-in mic capsules offering multiple recording modes, including stereo, 
90° X/Y stereo, 2-channel, and 4-channel
»
» Recording formats include both WAV and MP3 in different bitrates and 
varying quality
»

Auto Gain, Tuner, Normalize, and Surround Mixer
»
» 1/8-inch external mic input and 1/8-inch stereo line output
»
» Records directly to MicroSD and SDHC cards up to 32 GB capacity
»
» 20 hours of operation on two standard AA batteries
Zoom H4n Pro
The H4n Pro (shown in Figure 4-6) sets a new standard for portable podcasting as 
it delivers a wide array of features building on the previous models. It features
»
» Four-channel audio recording, able to record either in stereo or mono
»
» Two XLR connections with both 24V and 48V phantom power options
»
» Two-Input/Two-Output USB audio interface

CHAPTER 4  Go, Go, Power Podcasters!      81
»
» Built-in studio-grade instrument effects and emulators
»
» Onboard X/Y microphones able to emulate a variety of condenser and 
dynamic microphones
»
» Capable of recording up to 140 dB SPL
»
» Recording formats that include both WAV and MP3 in different bitrates and 
varying quality
»
» Records directly to SD and SDHC cards up to 32 GB capacity
Zoom H5 & H6
Maybe you need more than the H4n Pro offers, and if that is the case you need to 
look at Zoom’s H5 and H6. Both these portable recorders offer all the functionality 
and features found in the previous models (as you would expect), but the H5 and 
H6 offer more options for your on-the-go studio.
»
» Interchangeable input capsules that can be swapped out as easily as the lens 
of a camera
»
» Multichannel and stereo USB audio interface for PC/Mac/iPad
»
» Recording formats that include both WAV and MP3 in different bitrates and 
varying quality
»
» Four-channel (H5) and six-channel (H6) audio recording
FIGURE 4-6: 
The Zoom H4n 
Pro is the latest 
portable recorder 
that sets new 
standards 
for recording 
on the go.

82      PART 1  Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency
»
» Two (H5) and four (H6) XLR connection ports with various phantom power 
options
»
» Records directly to SD and SDHC cards up to 32GB capacity (H5) and SD, 
SDHC, and SDXC cards up to 128GB (H6)
»
» Mountable to DSLR or camcorder with optional HS-01 Hot Shoe Mount 
adapter (H5)
There are other portable recorders out there  — TASCAM and Roland, for 
­example — but Zoom has established itself as a reliable, durable, and affordable 
option for field and on-location recording. Depending on what you need for your 
podcast, you no longer need to worry about remaining tethered to a studio.
Before recording, always check that you have enough storage on your recording 
device. Most portable records will have an indicator to show how many hours or 
minutes can fit on the remaining storage. For mobile phones, go to your system 
settings and ensure you have approximately 1MB available for each minute of 
audio you want to record (much more for video). Chapter 10 gets into more nitty-
gritty details about settings and storage considerations.
As noted earlier, RFI can be a real downer when recording. Even with portable 
recorders, ensure your mobile devices are a safe distance from your recording 
device as phone’s radio signals can leave a telltale buzzing/beeping noise and ruin 
your recording. Just ask Ben and Keith of The Two Gay Geeks Podcast (http://
tggeeks.com) when they recorded a 90-minute interview with Kevin Schindler at 
IT’S A PREAMP! IT’S A RECORDER! KIDS . . . 
IT’S A PREAMP AND A RECORDER!
The preamp is a terrific way to get studio-quality sound while recording portably. If you 
want to be able to work on a laptop and still be able to take your studio completely  
on-the-go, however, the Zoom Handy Recorders have got you covered.
The H4n-H5-H6 models can all operate in the field as recording devices, and you can 
easily plug in an XLR microphone (the Røde Reporter, for example) and conduct the 
interview right there on the spot. However, if you have an on-location spot secured and 
want to set up more XLR microphones for a round-table discussion where participants 
have their own mics, these models can easily plug in via an available USB port and serve 
as a preamp for your laptop.
And if that isn’t versatile enough, you can attach any of the Handy Recorders to a USB 
port and use it as a USB-powered microphone.

CHAPTER 4  Go, Go, Power Podcasters!      83
the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona in 2016. Keith used his phone to prop 
up his recorder and it sounded like a video game was being played the entire time. 
Fortunately, Chuck was there and had a second recording of the same interview 
which was unaffected and happily shared it — because that’s what podcasters do!
From Cloud to Computer: Portable  
Audio Workflow
Now that you know how portable you want your podcast to be, how exactly will the 
workflow differ from the usual editing work in a studio? There are a few different 
approaches to consider when working portably. It’s not a dramatic switch. It’s 
more of how to get the audio from your mobile devices to your studio.
Getting audio from your portable recorder
After you finish recording with your portable recorder, you have audio sitting in 
your portable recorder. How do you get it from the recorder to the computer you 
are editing your podcast on?
Here’s some good news — the hard part of getting great audio for your podcast is 
done. Getting the audio to the computer? That’s the easy part:
1.	 Connect the portable recorder to an available USB port.
You should have a USB cable that is USB 2.0 A to Mini-B. The A tab goes to your 
computer. The Mini-B attaches to your portable recorder.
2.	 The portable recorder’s interface should give you either Storage or Audio 
I/F as an option. Select Audio Storage from the menu.
Audio I/F is the option for using your portable recorder as a USB microphone 
or preamp for your computer. In Storage mode, as shown in Figure 4-7, the 
portable recorder (and the SD card inside it) mounts onto your desktop as an 
external drive.
3.	 Once your portable player mounts as a drive, select the drive. Then select 
the folder labeled in the mode you used for recording.
Depending on the model of portable recorders, you may see folders labeled 
with offered recording modes. That should be where your audio is stored.

84      PART 1  Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency
4.	 Find your latest recording, and then drag it to where you are storing your 
audio sessions.
Whether you are working on an internal drive, an external drive, or cloud 
storage, you now have copied your audio file source from the recorder to your 
workspace. You can now begin the post-production process.
It is typically quicker to transfer files from your portable recorder to your com-
puter directly rather than use USB. If your computer has an SD card reader, you 
can remove the SD card from your portable recorder and place it in the SD card 
reader for faster copying. Just be sure you observe good practice and properly eject 
the media before pulling the SD card out of the computer and returning it to your 
portable recorder!
Getting audio from your portable device
With your smartphone or tablet, it’s a little different environment. Instead of a 
hard drive or an SD card, you have internal flash memory that will quickly fill up 
if you are saving audio or video files directly on your device. To work with your 
audio recorded on your mobile device, you need to transfer it to some sort of cloud 
storage service. The workflow we created for this section incorporates Dropbox as 
the cloud service, an iPad for the portable device, and ­GarageBand for iOS as the 
audio recorder.

1.	 Before transferring audio, check to make sure that your cloud service’s 
app is loaded and synced with your mobile device.
2.	 Launch GarageBand.
If you have been working on a project, GarageBand will open on the last 
project you were working on, or default to an audio recording interface.
3.	 If you are in a project, tap on My Songs in the upper-left corner of 
window.
4.	 Tap the Select option in the top-right corner of the app.
5.	 Find the project you want to export and tap it once to select it.
The project(s) you want to export will be highlighted in blue.
6.	 Tap the Share option in the top-left corner of the app.
The Share function (shown in Figure 4-8) accesses which apps can share the 
media you are about to export. If you cannot find the app you want to share to, 
find the More option to add your cloud service app.
7.	 Tap your cloud service app.
In the case of Dropbox and iPad, tap the Save to Dropbox option to begin the 
export process.

8.	 Edit the Info for the file and then select Audio Quality from the offered 
options. Single tap Share to begin the exporting process.
In GarageBand, you can select from three formats: MP3, Apple Lossless (m4a), 
and AIFF.
9.	 Select the location where you want to save your media and then tap the 
Save option in the upper-right corner of the Save window.
Your media has now been exported on to your cloud service, and is waiting for you 
to edit or prepare for uploading.
While you can record and export audio to MP3, it is never a good idea to make an 
MP3 from another MP3. It is the audio equivalent of making a compressed JPEG 
image from another JPEG image. Always strive to record in a raw, uncompressed 
format such as AIFF or WAV files. It takes more space initially, but produces better 
results.

une to a classical radio station (and when we refer to classics here, we mean 
Beethoven and Haydn, not The Beatles and Hendrix) and listen to the 
DJs — oh, sorry, the on-air personalities — featured there. You’ll notice that 
they’re all speaking slowly and articulately, mellowed and obviously relaxed by 
the melodic creations of greats such as Mozart, Wagner, and Joel. (Yes, Billy Joel 
has a classical album — a pretty good one, too!) Although the on-air personalities 
of your local classical music station all sound alike, they sound dramatically 
­different from the wacky Morning Zoo guys on your contemporary hits radio 
­station who sound as if they’re on their eighth cup of espresso.
When you hear people talk about finding your voice in broadcasting, that’s what 
they mean. You come to an understanding of what your average audience wants 
(and to some degree, expects), and then you meet that need. This chapter helps 
you develop the voice and personality you want to convey when podcasting.
After you discover your voice, you will want to get ready for the show. This chapter 
shows you what to do to prepare for smooth and easy podcasts that (one can hope) 
will be glitch-free during the recording process. Preshow prep is essential when 
making a feed worth catching. Even the most spontaneous podcasts follow a logi-
cal progression and general direction, and remain focused on the podcast’s intent.

Choosing a Unique Topic for Your Podcast
Before you can think about putting together a podcast, you need to decide what 
topic you want to cover. At the time of this writing, a sample of what people were 
podcasting (according to statista.com [http://statista.com/] at the end of 
2015) — listed by the top ten categories — looked like this:
Topic
Number of shows (approximate)
Christian
39,000
Music
33,600
Comedy
14,200
TV and Film
12,800
Literature
10,600
News and Politics
10,200
Video Games
7,000
Sports
6,700
Management and Marketing
5,200
Personal Journals
4,300
That’s a total of 143,600 podcasts — up from 36,540 from the second edition of 
this book published in 2008. That’s a lot of growth!
The first thing to understand about podcasts is that this activity isn’t all about 
being “number one” in your chosen podcast genre. Granted, some podcasts do vie 
for top honors on various polls, but instead of worrying about garnering ratings 
and awards, think about what will make your podcast uniquely worth your effort 
and your listeners’ time. The point in launching a podcast isn’t always “I want to 
do something totally new . . .” but more about “What do I have to say about this 
topic?”
Here are some ways you can create a unique podcast:
»
» Study other podcasts. Before you can figure out what will make your 
podcast unique, check out some other podcasts. The best way to find out 
what makes a podcast worthwhile is to subscribe to a few feeds that pique 
your curiosity.

CHAPTER 5  Before You Hit the Record Button      91
Listen to these feeds for a few weeks (provided they’re weekly) and jot down 
what you like and don’t like about them. From the notes you take, you might 
find your angle. Keep in mind that downloading and listening to other 
podcasts should be educational and constructive, not a raid for fodder for 
your own show.
Don’t steal content, special effects, or unique segments (like “On This Day in 
Tech History” or “The Loot Crate Lookie-Loo”) from another podcast. Approach 
others’ podcasts as you would someone’s website. It’s okay to be inspired; just 
don’t make your podcast a carbon copy of your inspiration’s work. When you 
have your podcast up, avoid criticizing another podcast in your own. Criticizing 
someone else’s work is no way to better yours. It is better to show support for 
other podcasts and the podcasting community on a whole rather than insult 
or trash other people’s hard work.
In other words, stay on the pod-sitive side. It’s better for you and the 
community.
»
» Pick a topic you know. Whether you’ve decided to take on the topic of 
music, religion, or technology, the best way to make your podcast unique is 
to find an angle you’re comfortable with (Polka: The Misunderstood Music, 
Great Travesties of Sports History, Forgotten Greats of Science Fiction). There’s 
also the possibility that your initial show may inspire an additional angle so 
unique that you’ll have to start another podcast specifically to address that 
audience.
»
» Speak confidently. Don’t apologize for being “yet another podcast on . . .” 
or point out what you are doing wrong compared to others. What makes a 
podcast fun is the passion and the confidence you exude when the mics 
are hot. Address your topic with authority and energy, and enjoy your time 
recording. If you have a blast making a podcast, your audience will enjoy 
it along with you. That confidence might even inspire others to podcast 
themselves. That was how it happened with podcaster Joe Hogan and his 
first podcast, Geektitude (shown in Figure 5-1 and found online at http://
geektitude.com). His confidence and passion for the geek lifestyle inspired 
others like the Geek Wolfpack Podcast to launch their own podcasts.
The content you bring — regardless of what genre it’s in — is unique because it is 
your podcast. It’s your voice, your angle, and your approach to whatever intent you 
pursue. Provided you maintain a high confidence level and genuinely enjoy what 
you’re doing, people will tune in and talk to other listeners about what you’re 
podcasting.

92      PART 2  The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
Finding Your Voice
The broadcasting industry might not want to admit to this, but podcasting and 
commercial radio share a lot in common. In the early days of what is now a major 
radio genre, talk shows were reserved for National Public Radio and news stations. 
In general, they were pretty dry and lackluster, bringing their listeners the news, 
weather, and daily topics that affected the world  — but nothing particularly 
unusual or exciting.
Then a guy named Howard Stern came along and changed everything in this 
once-tiny niche. You can love him, you can hate him — you can claim to hate him 
when secretly you love him — but Stern completely turned around what was con-
sidered AM-only programming. Now talk radio is big business. Some personalities 
are just out to entertain, other hosts deep dive into lifestyles and subjects of inter-
est, and others use it to voice their political viewpoints.
The majority of podcasting is just that: talk radio. Each podcast has a different 
personality and appeals to a different market. Finding your voice is one of the 
most challenging obstacles that you (as a once-and-future podcaster) must clear. 
Even if your podcast’s aim is entertainment, you have a message you want to con-
vey. That message will influence the voice you adopt for your podcast. If you’re 
podcasting an audio blog about life, its challenges, and the ups and downs that 
you encounter, then maybe a soft tone — relaxed and somewhat pensive — would 
be appropriate. But if you decide to go political — say you’re the Angry Young Man 
FIGURE 5-1:

who’s fed up with the current business on Capitol Hill — then it’s time to fine-
tune the edge in your voice. That’s what you need for a podcast of this nature.
After you discover the passion your podcast is centered around (see the preceding 
section for tips on how to do that), here are some ways to find your voice:
»
» Record your voice and then listen to what it sounds like. It astounds us 
how many people hate listening to their recorded voice. It’s a fear akin to 
getting up in front of people and speaking. When finding your voice, though, 
you need to hear what your current voice sounds like. Write a paragraph on 
your show’s subject. Then read it aloud a few times and find a rhythm in your 
words. Expect the following:
•	 Talking too fast
•	 Swallowing small, one-syllable words like to, in
•	 Ignoring commas, thereby creating one long, run-on thought
•	 Lip-smacking, heavy breathing, and the unavoidable ahs and ums
You can edit out some of these problems (see Chapter 8), but you should 
grow accustomed to hearing your own voice because you’ll hear yourself 
again and again . . . and again . . . during the editing process. The more 
familiar you are with how your voice sounds, the easier time you’ll have 
editing your podcasts before publishing them online.
»
» Play around with the rhythm of your speech. You don’t have to be an actor 
to podcast, but you can apply some basics of acting when you’re recording. 
One of these basics, as one of Tee’s acting professors told him, is to “make a 
meal of your words.” This means to play around with the rhythm of your 
speech. When you want to make a point, slow down. If you’re feeling a tad 
smarmy, pick up the pace. Above all, be relaxed and make sure you don’t 
sound too contrived or melodramatic.
»
» Speak clearly. Another simple trick from the acting world to add to your 
arsenal is to open your mouth wider. Many people talk with their mouths 
mostly closed, but by opening your mouth wider, you can gain clarity. So, 
when making a meal of your words, it is good manners to chew with your 
mouth open.
»
» Speak with confidence. Yes, we’re saying this again, because it bears 
repeating: Speak confidently about your topic. No one is going to believe in 
what you say if you don’t believe in yourself. It may take a few podcasts to 
find a groove, or you might hit the ground running and have a podcast that 
immediately takes off. Just speak with conviction and allow yourself to shine.

94      PART 2  The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
»
» Develop your podcasting personality. After you know what you sound like 
when you record, here’s where you develop your podcasting personality. 
Is your persona going to be light, fun, and informal, or something a little edgy, 
jaded? Is your message taking an angle of marketing, politics, or religion? Or 
are you podcasting a love of music, science, or your Macintosh? Your persona 
should generally match the theme of your show. If you’re doing a show on 
classical music, a persona of a morning radio DJ probably isn’t going to work. 
If you’re taking a light-hearted look at politics, you may want to have a little 
more levity in your tone and pace than a funeral director.
What If I Hear More than One Voice?
One of our favorite ways to podcast is with guests in-studio or co-hosts where 
more than one podcaster gets on mic. While there’s something to be said for the 
single voice doing a monologue or perhaps doing interviews, the show dynamics 
change quite a bit when you get multiple people gathered together over your 
favorite topic. For one thing, it’s a lot easier to carry on a conversation! Another 
bonus is with the right dynamic between hosts, an energy is created that sub-
scribers see and hear in every episode. Along with the guidelines described in this 
and other chapters, there are some specific things to be aware of when doing a 
show with multiple guests.
»
» Have a mixer with enough channels. In Chapter 2, we talk about gear. 
Remember the mixer? The mixer becomes a crucial piece of equipment when 
co-hosts become part of the production. You can try the one mic, two voices 
approach, but the end result is hard to control and mix in post-production. 
For the best sound and optimal control, all participants need their own 
microphones. This means XLR connections, not USB, for microphones. Two 
hosts and you’ll need two channels. Four hosts, four channels. And don’t 
forget, you may want a few extra inputs for music, sound effects, and more. 
So make sure the mixer can handle the in-studio demands.
»
» Make sure everyone can hear. You’re wearing headphones when you record. 
So should your guests, especially if drop-ins are included in your recording. 
It’s not only fair, it’s practical that everyone hears the same thing. Each guest 
needs his or her own set of headphones. Before you run out and get a cheap  
“Y” cable to split the signal, realize that with each split, the audio signal 
degrades. To keep the investment economical, invest in a stereo headphone 
amplifier for about $25 that takes the headphone signal and splits (while 
boosting) it in to four separate channels. Then pick up from BSW a  
5-pack of Sennheiser headphones (http://bit.ly/5packphones) for  

CHAPTER 5  Before You Hit the Record Button      95
you and your co-hosts or guests. You’ll find this investment will serve you and 
your podcast well.
»
» Always do your prep work. Even after a decade of podcasting, there are 
still gremlins in our audio systems. We can record on Saturday afternoon 
and come back Sunday night only to find audio levels have been adjusted. 
Okay, it could be the cats playing with the mixer settings in the middle of the 
night, but it never hurts to check your audio (and video) settings before each 
recording.
»
» Have one director. This is the person in charge of your show’s flow, timing, 
and in some cases coming up with clever segues to jump from one topic to 
the next. Usually this is the person at the mixer, but not always. It may even 
be someone off mic (or camera) giving hand signals. In some cases, this may 
be a baton passed from person to person in the cast. You’ll find what works 
best for your group. The podcaster calling the plays serves as a moderator. It 
is your job to keep the energy up, the conversation going, and keep the 
episode on track.
»
» Give everyone some air time. As with the previous item, the director may 
need to make sure everyone gives everyone else a chance to talk. Different 
people bring different things to your show. Some people may be passionate 
and outspoken (and some may be considered an unstoppable train), while 
others don’t want to interrupt and wait their turn. Encourage your guests to 
play fair and give everyone a share the air time. We recommend discussing 
this among your co-hosts before it becomes a problem.
»
» When guests are in-studio or on the line, give them the majority of air 
time on that episode. Both Chuck and Tee have seen and heard their fair 
share of interviews gone bad. It can be something as horrific as the host or 
hosts not knowing (or caring) to do any research on the guest. Tee recalls one 
podcast where the co-hosts broke on a tangent between themselves for ten 
minutes while the guest remained silent on the line, waiting to be asked another 
question. When guests are on the docket, remember that the episode is no 
longer yours. It’s theirs. For more on interview techniques, take a look at 
Chapter 6, coming soon.
»
» Make sure everyone can see everyone else. It’s been said that as much as 
93 percent of our communications is nonverbal. Even if you are doing an 
audio podcast, you want to be able to see each other during the conversation. 
Configure your studio to make sure everyone can see everyone else in order 
to have eye contact, see silent signals to pick up the pace or slow down, and 
let the director know all have something to say (see Figure 5-2). Being able to 
read each other’s nonverbal cues is made easier when sightlines are clear and 
unobstructed — well, most of the time.

96      PART 2  The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
Be aware that your show will be longer as you include more guests in the conversa-
tion. If you want to keep your show length consistent — a good recommendation in 
our book — then include fewer topics than you expect. Part of Chuck’s Saturday ritual 
for building out the Sunday night episode is to find out how many people are coming 
over so he can add or remove topics accordingly. For Tee, it’s coordinating with his 
co-hosts who wants to take the lead on a specific topic. Breaks offer a moment for 
anyone to say, “Mind if I take the lead in the second half?” If you really don’t care 
about length, then just realize that more guests will make for a longer show and plan 
accordingly. Communication is essential with co-hosts and in-studio guests.
Deciding Whether You Need  
an Outline or Script
What method works best for you? A full script and hours of prep time, or a single 
note card and two clicks of the mouse — one for Record and another for Stop? Both 
approaches work, depending on the podcaster’s personality. It could be said that 
there’s little difference between a writer and a podcaster: Some writers prefer to 
use an outline when putting together a short story or novel; others merely take an 
idea, a few points, and a direction, and then let their fingers work across the 
keyboard.
FIGURE 5-2: 
Sightlines matter 
when you have 
co-hosts or 
guests in-studio.

CHAPTER 5  Before You Hit the Record Button      97
If you decide to work with a script, it’s a good idea to invest some time into pre-
show prep, simple preparation for what you’re going to say and how you’re going 
to deliver it. Depending on your podcast, though, prep time may vary. Here are a 
couple of examples of how dramatically different prep time can be for different 
podcasting situations:
»
» For their podcast The Brit and Yankee Pubcast (http://thebritandyankee.
com), Phil Clark and his crew do very little prep — usually just enough to get 
some basic facts about the drink of choice for that show and perhaps set up a 
location and interview with the brewmaster. After he does minimal orientation 
with the guest panel, he’s ready to record. You really need to know your 
subject and have good chemistry with your show participants to make a 
minimal plan like this turn in to a good show, but it can work.
»
» On the other side of the spectrum is The Radio Adventures of Doctor Floyd 
(http://doctorfloyd.com), a 10-minute show in the style of old-time radio 
with a modern, educational, comedic spin. Grant Baciocco and Doug Price 
(see Figure 5-3) have every show carefully scripted. Depending on the 
historical research required, Grant can spend anywhere from 1 to 3 hours 
doing preshow prep. The careful scripting comes in real handy when Doctor 
Floyd has celebrity actors playing a part in the show.
FIGURE 5-3:

that means plenty 
of preshow prep!

98      PART 2  The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
Preshow prep can range anywhere from jotting a few notes on a napkin to writing 
a complete scripted with full sound effects — regardless of show length. So how 
far should your prep go technically? That depends on what your podcast needs. 
Outlines and scripts will keep you on track with what you want to say, serving as 
roadmaps you use to keep moving smoothly from Point A to Point B.
Whether you’re a napkin scribbler, a script writer, or somewhere in between, if 
you’ve never done any kind of planning like this, the secret to efficient preshow 
prep can be boiled down to three disciplines:
»
» Habit: Many podcasters, especially podcasters emerging from corporate 
offices, prepare for podcasts in the same manner as business presentations. 
They jot down essential points on note cards to keep the podcast on track, but 
the points are the only material they write beforehand. You can easily apply 
your organizational skills from the workplace to the podosphere.
»
» Talent: Some podcasters are truly the Evel Knievels of the podosphere, 
firing up their mics and recording in one take. These podcasters tend to have 
backgrounds in live entertainment, deciding in a moment’s time when a 
change of delivery is required. This is a talent of quick thinking, and although 
it keeps material spontaneous and fresh, it’s a talent that must be developed 
with time.
»
» Passion: For most podcasters, passion is a driving force that keeps their 
podcasts spur-of-the-moment. With enough drive, inspiration, and confidence 
in their message, they keep their prep time to a minimum because podcasting 
isn’t a chore but a form of recreation.
Determining a Length for Your Show
If you’ve been using this chapter to develop your podcast, you’ve made serious 
progress by this point in getting your preshow prep done. Now you’re ready to 
podcast, right?
Well, no. First you must consider how long your show’s episode is going to run. 
The following sections give you the rundown on how best to determine your 
show’s length.

CHAPTER 5  Before You Hit the Record Button      99
The hidden value of the short podcast
There are many podcasts that run under ten minutes where hosts deliver their 
message and then sign off only moments after you thought they signed on. While 
on average — and this is more like an understood average, not really a scientific, 
detailed study of all the podcasts out there — a podcast runs from 20 to 30 ­minutes 
per episode. So what about these 10-minute vignettes? Does size matter? Does 
time matter? (Whoa. Deep.) Is there such a thing as too short a podcast?
Here are some advantages in offering a short podcast:
»
» Shorter production time: Production time is reduced from a weeklong 
project to a single afternoon of planning, talking, editing, and mixing. With a 
quick and simplified production schedule, delivering a podcast on a regular 
basis — say, every two weeks, weekly, or twice a week — is easier.
»
» Fast downloads: You can be assured — no matter what specs you compress 
your audio file down to — that your podcast subscribers will always have fast 
and efficient downloads.
»
» Easy to stay on target: If you limit yourself to a running time of less than ten 
minutes, you force yourself to stick to the intent (and the immediate message) 
of your podcast. There’s no room for in-depth chat, spontaneous banter, or 
TIMING YOUR PODCAST TO THE  
AVERAGE COMMUTE
You may hear some veteran podcasters say, “Your podcast should never be longer than 
30 minutes because that is the time of an average commute.” Chuck has heard actual 
listener feedback asking, “Can you make your show the length of my commute?” Oh 
boy! Tee’s response to this has not changed since 2005: “Obviously, you don’t live in the 
Washington, D.C. Metro area, do you?”
Yes, maybe the average commute from sea to shining sea is 30 minutes, but that  
should not be a set-in-stone template. There are shows where each episode is 
60 seconds, others where the host(s) decide they need to go on for hours (thank you 
to whoever invented the pause button!), and still others where each episode length is 
variable.
The bottom line: You decide how long it takes you to podcast, and remember, there are 
going to be those super-sized episodes that occasionally come along.

100      PART 2  The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
tangents to explore. You hit the red button and remain on target from 
beginning to end, keeping your podcast strictly focused on the facts. 
Shakespeare said, “Brevity is the soul of wit.” Considering his words, ol’ Bill 
would probably have podcast under 15 minutes if he were alive today.
Nothing’s wrong with keeping a podcast short and sweet. In fact, you might gain 
more subscribers who appreciate your efficiency.
A little length won’t kill you
Now with that quote from the Bard about brevity, you might think, “Shakespeare 
said that?! Before or after he wrote Hamlet?” That’s a good point because Shake-
speare did have more than a few of his characters say, “My lord, I will be brief . . .” 
and then launch into a three-to-four-page monologue.
What if Shakespeare decided to be brief in his podcast? Would he get any sub-
scribers if his show ran longer than half an hour? What if he broke the 60-minute 
­ceiling? Would the Podcast Police shut down his show?
Podcatchers and subscribers, on reading your show notes and descriptions, should 
be able to figure out the average running time of your show. On a particular topic, 
some podcasts can easily fill two or even three hours. It’s hard to believe even avid 
podcast audiences would want to sit and wait for such a mammoth download, but 
huge productions have some definite advantages:
»
» If the show is an interview, you have anywhere from two to three hours 
with an authority. It’s something like having a one-on-one session stored 
on your computer or MP3 player. From shows like SyFy Wire’s The Churn 
(see the upcoming sidebar, “Free-falling into The Expanse”), if a guest is part 
of the podcast, you can rest assured your podcast will go a little longer than 
30 minutes — and sometimes it should.
Be careful with this one. Shows and interviews that ramble aimlessly run the 
risk of losing audience attention. We talk more about good interview practices 
in Chapter 6.
»
» You’re allowed verbal breathing room. Discussion stretching past the 
30-minute mark allows you and your co-hosts or guests to break off into 
loosely related banter, widening your podcast’s focus and sparking discussion 
that can lead in other directions.
The cost of podcasts longer than 30 minutes is in bandwidth and file-storage — 
issues that smaller podcasts rarely, if ever, must deal with. See Chapter 10 for a 
discussion of the bandwidth demands on your server.

CHAPTER 5  Before You Hit the Record Button      101
FREE-FALLING INTO THE EXPANSE
The SyFy channel has been employing podcasting as an “enhanced experience” to its 
leading shows. In the first and second editions of Podcasting For Dummies, Battlestar 
Galactica’s Executive Producer Ronald D. Moore and SyFy (then called SciFi) were fea-
tured for hosting hour-long episodes, similar to director commentaries on DVDs, provid-
ing an inside look at what went into the episode airing that day. The companion podcast 
of Battlestar Galactica was so successful that SciFi broadened its scope to include script-
writing sessions and guest appearances from cast members.
Since then, SyFy continues to use podcasting as a means to bring fans deeper into its 
most popular shows, and The Churn is such a podcast. The Churn, hosted by Fangrrls 
Managing Editor Cher Martinetti and Editor-in-Chief Adam Swiderski and writers Ty 
Franck and Daniel Abraham (who collectively make up the pen name S.A. Corey), take 
deep dives into The Expanse, the books that Franck and Abraham create. Along with get-
ting into the heads of the series creators, The Churn also invites actors, visual artists, and 
special science guests like Bad Astronomy’s Phil Plait to talk about issues addressed in 
the show from accuracy of physics to theoretical politics stretching across the solar 
system. If you are a fan of this incredible science fiction series, The Churn is a must-have 
companion for watching The Expanse.

Finding that happy medium
Is there such a thing as middle ground in the almost-completely undiscovered 
territory that is podcasting? How can you find a happy medium if podcasters can’t 
agree on a standard running time?
The happy medium for your podcast should be a sense of expectancy or consistency. 
For example, in Tee’s Parsec-winning podcast of Tales from the Archives, the run-
ning times for each episode are across the board — the shortest clocking in at just 
over 30 minutes, and the longest weighing in at over an hour. His audience, 
­however, understands this is a podiobook, an audiobook presented in a serialized 
format. Readers understand that chapters and short stories vary in size, so it’s no 
surprise when a podiobook follows suit. Some of the episodes are short and sweet 
while others push the length limits expected from literature.
Podiobooks aren’t the only genre that variable length works well for. If your 
­podcast deals in do-it-yourself home improvement, explaining the construction 
of a bookshelf will be a far shorter show than one about adding an extension to 
your deck.
Give yourself some time to develop your show, your voice, and your direction. If 
you build some consistency and expectation for your audience, it’s easier to intro-
duce a little variation or even a happy medium into your running time.
Mark Your Calendar: Posting Schedule
You’ve got a format for your show. You’ve got an idea about its running time. Now 
you have to figure out when your show is going to go live. What is the best pace to 
set for your podcast? What are the advantages to posting frequently versus post-
ing on occasion? How often will you be dropping your podcast into your feed?
There are four different kinds of posting schedules, some easier to maintain than 
others. Your podcast, depending on the planning and running-time you set, will 
dictate how often you post. There is no sure schedule to podcasts. What matters is 
setting a schedule and maintaining it.
A good way to know what posting schedule works best for you is to sit down and 
brainstorm on show topics. If you rattle off several ideas, rapid-fire, you may be 
looking at a frequent schedule. If your ideas are reliant more on current events 
and their outcomes, you may space out your episodes. See how quickly you can 
come up with ideas, and from there, make a decision on a reasonable posting 
schedule.

CHAPTER 5  Before You Hit the Record Button      103
Posting daily
The demands of podcasting can be daunting between recording, editing, and post-
ing. There are those who have figured out a way to minimize production, whether 
it is keeping the recordings raw and unedited or employing a studio with a crew or 
something in between, and posting on a daily schedule. Every day, a new episode 
appears in your podcatcher. Every day. That’s a lot of content to sift through if you 
subscribe to a long-running podcast. Daily podcasts, though, do not necessarily 
follow a linear path. In other words, you do not have to go back to Episode 1 to 
understand the flow and the atmosphere of a podcast. Just jump on in, and enjoy!
If you think podcasting is daunting, podcasters like Nathan Lowell on Today on My 
Morning Walk (www.nathanlowell.org/tommw), the high-energy Geek Radio Daily 
(http://geekradiodaily.com), and The New  York Times powered The Daily 
(https://www.nytimes.com/podcasts/the-daily) undertake the challenge and 
produce new content every day. A payoff to answering this challenge is building 
an audience. With so much content to share, your community should grow quickly.
Regardless of your intended schedule, life sometimes deals us an unintended 
hand. Just let your audience know. They’ll understand. We’ve found that doing 
this can build loyalty. Let’s face it, the majority of podcasters are doing this as a 
second job. We have family that need attention, day jobs that require business 
trips, and a host of other things that might crop up, scheduled or otherwise. You 
don’t have to reveal personal details if it’s not appropriate; however, a quick mes-
sage to your audience is always polite.
Posting weekly
Perhaps the most common of schedules for podcasts is weekly posting, like you 
would with a popular television show. Perhaps not as demanding as the daily 
schedule, this schedule means a commitment to producing new content at least 
once a week. You will want to make certain the content is there before you launch, 
and find workflows that make your production schedule more efficient. You can 
do this by maintaining a buffer of content, seen often in gaming podcasts like 
Steam Rollers Adventure Podcast (http://riggstories.com/the-podcast) and So 
Many  Levels (http://christianaellis.com/so-many-levels-a-dd-podcast) 
that record gaming sessions that can last for an hour (or longer) and then present 
them in a serialized format. Pick a day out of the week, and make that your day. 
That will be the time your listeners or viewers will be expecting your next 
episode.
Other podcasts like George Hrab’s The Geologic Podcast (www.geologicpodcast.
com, shown in Figure 5-4) and Grammar Girl’s Quick and Dirty Tips (www.quickand 
dirtytips.com/grammar-girl) seem to just happen spontaneously. There’s some 

104      PART 2  The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
planning that goes into these podcasts, but talent also comes to play. If you can 
get behind the mic and feel right at home, you can keep up with the weekly 
schedule.
Posting biweekly (or “fortnightly” for our 
friends in the Commonwealth)
Say you have a reasonable amount of content, but not a whole lot of free time. 
Or  maybe you want to podcast but are concerned that you will burn through 
the ­content before you can come up with new ideas and directions for your show. 
A  biweekly posting schedule provides you with a comfortable alternative to 
the  regular demands of a weekly production. This may mean the audience 
response and the timeliness of your podcasts may be lacking when compared to a 
more ­frequent posting schedule, but this schedule is easier to maintain in case a 
weekly schedule is difficult for you to maintain. Podcasts like Headshots 
(www.headshotspodcast.com) and The Wekk Podcast (https://wekkpodcast.com) 
find a good life-work-podcast balance with the biweekly schedule.
Whether working daily, weekly, or biweekly, you might find life stepping in the 
way of your production schedule. This is why having a concept of seasons should 
be considered for your podcast. In the case of Tee’s steampunk podcast, Tales from 
the Archives, seasons are defined by 10 to 12 short stories. If you see a break coming 
in your production, make sure to let your audience know.
FIGURE 5-4:

Podcast, hosted

schedule since 
its launch.

CHAPTER 5  Before You Hit the Record Button      105
Posting monthly
What are the benefits of a monthly podcast, aside from the relaxed scheduling and 
production schedule? It’s easy to see what is the challenge in working on a monthly 
schedule: nurturing the audience. Posting only monthly makes it difficult — not 
impossible, but difficult — to build a community over content that only happens 
once a month. In addition, the timeliness of a monthly podcast is almost nonex-
istent as news headlines happening weeks ahead of a recording session are impos-
sible to comment on in a timely fashion.
What does make a monthly podcast schedule appealing? Longer-than-usual run-
ning times on topics inspired by the recent weeks’ headlines. Such is the case State 
of the Geek (www.stateofthegeek.com/podcast), where hosts Joe Hogan and Kelly 
Hightower talk about topics that have cropped up in the month’s news. These are 
geeks discussing politics in-depth, voicing their opinions on a monthly inspired 
topic. As they have a month to prep for recording, both Joe and Kelly have time to 
gather their resources as well as their thoughts. So if you have a subject that needs 
time for research and discussion, posting monthly may be a better option for you.
If you find yourself with an intermittent schedule, avoid apologizing for the 
absence. Both Tee and Chuck have listened to a number of podcasts over the years 
that have somewhat random schedules. When we hear from those wayward pod-
casters, we’re excited to hear from them again. It’s a bit of a letdown when the 
first words we hear are “Sorry for not producing a show as often as I would like.” 
Instead, consider telling us how glad you are to be back, or just don’t mention it 
at all. Get right in and start your delivery as if nothing happened. We forgive you!
I Hear Music (And It Sounds  
like Police Sirens!)
Adding the right kind of music to your podcast can give your show an extra punch 
or just a tiny zest. Although our skills and tastes range from classical to jazz to 
rock ’n’ roll, both Chuck and Tee appreciate and understand the power of music 
and what it can bring to a podcast.
Chuck and Tee also understand and appreciate the law. Although you may think 
it’s cool to “stick it to the man” and thumb your nose at Corporate America, the 
law is the law, and there are serious rules to follow when featuring that favorite 
song of yours as a theme to your podcast.

106      PART 2  The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
We want to make this clear as polished crystal: We are not lawyers. We’re pod-
casters. We’ve looked up the law on certain matters so we know and understand 
what we’re talking about, but we are not lawyers. We can tell you about the law and 
we can give a few simple definitions of it, but we are not giving out legal advice. If 
you need a legal call on a matter concerning your podcast — whether it concerns 
the First Amendment, copyright issues, or slander — please consult a lawyer.
The powers that be
The government regards the Internet even today as a digital Wild West, an unknown 
territory that’s avoided regulation for many years, granting those who use it a 
true, self-governed entity where ideas, cultures, and concepts can be expressed 
without any filtering or editing, unless it comes from the users themselves.
Does this mean we podcasters are free to do as we please? Well, no, not by a long 
shot. There are some rules and regulations that even podcasts must follow. There 
are also organizations that both broadcasters and podcasters must pay attention to.
The following organizations have influence on the destiny of podcasting, and it’s 
only going to benefit you as a podcaster to understand how their legislation, 
activities, and actions are going to affect you.
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
The Federal Communications Commission, or FCC (www.fcc.gov), is the watch-
dog of anything and everything that gets out to the public via mass communica-
tions. The FCC keeps an eye on technology development, monopolies in the 
telecommunications industry, and regulating standards for telecommunications 
in the United States and its territories. It is most commonly known for enforcing 
decency laws on television and AM/FM radio.
For podcasters, the FCC can’t regulate what is said (yet) because it doesn’t con-
sider the Internet a broadcasting medium. However, given existing legislation to 
reduce spam (junk email) and the growing popularity of podcasting among main-
stream broadcasters (such as Clear Channel, Oprah Winfrey, and ESPN), it may 
not be long before the law catches up with technology.
The Recording Industry Association  
of America (RIAA)
Sean Fanning. Does that name ring a bell? Sadly, it was Fanning who lost his 
battle against the Recording Industry Association of America, also referred to by 
its more common acronym RIAA (www.riaa.com), when he contested that his file-
sharing application, Napster, in no way infringed on copyright laws and was not 

CHAPTER 5  Before You Hit the Record Button      107
promoting music piracy. The RIAA led the charge in shutting down the ­original 
Napster and continues to protect property rights of its members  — as well as 
review new and pending laws, regulations, and policies at the state and federal 
level.
The RIAA will have a definite say as to why you cannot use a selected piece of music 
for your podcast. Simply put, it’s not your music. Sure, you own that CD or maybe 
you have downloaded that album from iTunes, but the music you listen to is under 
the condition that you use it for listening purposes only. This means you can’t use 
it as your own personal introduction that people will associate with you. And, no 
matter how appropriate your favorite song is, you cannot use it as background 
music. Unless you’re granted licenses and you pay fees to the record labels and 
artists, you’re in copyright violation when playing music without permission.
One way of getting music for themes, background beds, and segues is to look into 
what musicians and podcasters refer to as podsafe music. This is professionally 
produced music from independent artists who are offering their works for 
­podcasting use. The demand for podsafe music has been so high that several sites 
like the Free Music Archive (see Figure  5-5) have been launched (http://
freemusicarchive.org), offering a wide array of genres, artists, and musical 
works. Today several other sources of podsafe music exist including Digital Juice 
(www.digitaljuice.com), Neosounds (www.neosounds.com), and Instant Music 
Now (www.instantmusicnow.com). Find out more about podsafe music, the 
­conditions of using it, and how it can benefit your podcast.

108      PART 2  The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
In addition to the big dogs who are passing the laws and legislations to restrain 
your podcasting capabilities, a group is looking out for you, the podcaster, with 
Science Fiction author and tech guru Cory Doctorow stepping forward as one of 
its  more outspoken members. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, or EFF 
(www.eff.org), is a donor-supported organization working to protect the digital 
rights of the individual; to educate the media, lawmakers, and the public on how 
technology affects their civil liberties; and uphold said civil liberties if they’re 
threatened.
A good example of EFF’s mission is its involvement in various legal cases con-
cerning URL domain registration and cybersquatters (individuals who buy desired 
domains and then hold on to them, waiting for the highest bidder). The EFF stands 
for the rights of legitimate website owners who happen to own a domain that a 
larger corporation would desire to use.
The EFF, provided you have a strong case to contradict the findings of the RIAA 
and the FCC, will stand up for you and give your voice a bit of power when you’re 
standing up to a corporate legal machine.
Creative Commons (CC)
Founded in 2001, Creative Commons (CC) is a nonprofit corporation dedicated to 
helping the artist, the copyrighted material, and the individual who wants to use 
copyrighted material in a constructive manner but may not have the resources to 
buy rights from groups like the RIAA.
Copyright protection is a double-edged sword for many. On the positive side of a 
copyright, your work is protected so that others cannot steal it for their own per-
sonal profit, or if other people make the claim that you’re ripping off their work, 
your copyright is proof that your egg came before their chicken. That’s the whole 
point of the copyright — protection. The downside of this protection is that people 
now must go through channels for approval to feature your work in an educational 
or referential manner; and although you’re given credit for the property featured, 
there’s still a matter of approvals, fees for usage, and conditions that must be met. 
Also, many contributors just want to share their work with others on no other 
terms but to contribute and share with the world. Copyrights complicate this.
This complication of the digital copyright, protections, and desire to exchange 
original creations brought about Creative Commons (http://creativecommons.
org), shown in Figure 5-6. It’s dedicated to drafting and implementing via the 
Internet licenses granting fair use of copyrighted material.

CHAPTER 5  Before You Hit the Record Button      109
In the case of the podcaster, you want to offer your audio content to everyone, not 
caring whether listeners copy and distribute your MP3. As long as the listeners give 
you credit, that’s all fine and good for you. CC can provide you with licenses that 
aid you in letting people know your podcast is up for grabs as long as others give 
credit where credit is due. CC provides these same licenses for artists and musi-
cians who would not mind at all if you used their music for your podcast.
CC licenses are made up of permission fields:
»
» Attribution: Grants permission for copying, distribution, display, and 
performance of the original work and derivative works inspired from it, 
provided credit to the artist(s) is given.
»
» Noncommercial: Grants permission for copying, distribution, display, and 
performance of the original work and derivative works inspired from it for 
noncommercial purposes only.
»
» No Derivative Works: Grants permission for copying, distribution, display, 
and performance of the original work only. No derivative works are covered in 
this license category.
»
» Share Alike: Grants reproduction of the original work and also allows deriva-
tive works if they are also released under a similar Creative Commons license.
These four fields can be used as stand-alone licenses or can be mixed and matched 
to fit the needs of the podcaster or the artist offering content for the podcast.
FIGURE 5-6: 
Creative 
Commons offers 
free licenses for 
use of original 
content in 
podcasting.

110      PART 2  The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
The CC and its website give details, examples, and an FAQ page that answers 
questions concerning the granting of licenses for use of protected content. Just on 
the off-chance you don’t find your answer on the website, it gives contact infor-
mation for its representatives. CC is a good group to know and can open opportu-
nities for you to present new and innovative ideas and works in your podcast.
I can name that tune . . . I wrote it!
Using almost anyone else’s music for your podcast can be an open invitation for 
the RIAA to shut it down. This is primarily to protect the artist’s rights. Think 
about it — how would you feel if you were producing a popular podcast, receiving 
praise from all over the world, and while you’re thinking about ways of taking the 
podcast to the next level, you turn on your radio and hear your podcast being 
broadcast on a top-rated radio station. Soon, your podcast is all the rage on the 
broadcasting airwaves — and you haven’t made dollar one.
The same thing can be said for artists and their music. They work hard to produce 
their work, and now podcasters are using their music to brand their shows, not 
bothering to compensate the artists for their efforts. Artists love to say that they 
do what they do for the love of the craft but in the end, it’s their work and artists 
have to pay the bills, too.
So how can you use a piece of music without suffering the wrath of the RIAA or 
FCC? Ask permission of the artist? Only if the artist owns the rights to the music 
and the recordings. Otherwise, you also need to get written permission from art-
ists, musicians, record labels, producers . . .
The best way to avoid the legal hassles is to avoid copyrighted material that is not 
your own.
If you want to use published pieces that aren’t royalty-free, ask the artist directly 
(if you can) for permission to use that music on a regular basis. Compensation 
to the artist may come in the form of a promotion at the beginning or end (or 
both) tags of the podcast. As long as you have written permission from the artists 
and the artists have the power to grant it (that is, they haven’t signed the power 
over to their label or publisher), you should be able to use their work to brand your 
show or feature them on your podcast. (If you’re not sure whether you have the 
appropriate permission, you may want to consult an attorney.) This is usually 
acceptable with independent artists because, in many cases, they also own the 
record label. Confirm this with artists. Otherwise, you run into the same legal 
issues if you were to use music recorded by Queen, Bruno Mars, or U2.

CHAPTER 5  Before You Hit the Record Button      111
You can always offer your podcast as a venue for the musician to sell his or her 
work. Dave Slusher of Evil Genius Chronicles (www.evilgeniuschronicles.org) has 
written permission from the Gentle Readers to use its music as intro, exit, and 
background music for his podcast; in return, Dave promotes its CD, Hi, Honey. This 
promotion works well for the Gentle Readers as well as artist Michelle Mallone 
(www.michellemalone.com). After her music was featured on Dave’s podcast, her 
sales spiked — both through her website and on iTunes!
I’ll take the First: Free speech  
versus slander
Words can (potentially, at least) get you in just as much trouble as music. The 
legal definition of slander is a verbal form of defamation, or spoken words that falsely 
and negatively reflect on one’s reputation.
So where does podcasting fit into all this? Well, the Internet is a kind of public 
space. Think about it — before you open your mouth and begin a slam-fest on 
someone you don’t like in the media or go on the personal attack with someone 
you work alongside, remember that your little rant is reaching MP3 players around 
the world. Be sure — before you open your mouth to speak — that you aren’t mis-
quoting an article or merely assuming that your word is gospel. Cite your sources, 
and make certain those sources are not only reliable and authentic, but also that 
they are confirmed by other credible sources. If you’re doing a news podcast or 
include a news segment in your show, consider citing the source where you got 
your news. It not only tells your listener that you’re not making this stuff up, but 
it’s also a nice way to drive traffic to the website you consider valuable. When 
expressing opinions, jaded, constructive, or otherwise, have real evidence to back 
up what you say.

P
odcasting is empowering. There’s something about a microphone in your 
hand that gives courage. Suddenly, you’re not afraid of anything. Oh yeah, 
you’re running with the big dogs now, and like Charlie Rose, Larry King, or 
even BCC’s own Stephen Sackur, you’re asking the questions to find out what 
makes your guest tick.
What sets you apart from those big dogs, though, is skill. James Lipton of Inside 
the Actor’s Studio may make interviewing look easy, but make no mistake: Inter-
views are not easy. It takes skill to host an interview, and hosting a great interview 
is an art. The good news is these luminaries possessing the gift of gab all had to 
start somewhere. Podcasting is an excellent venue to hone these skills, but you’re 
going to want a solid foundation to build your skill set on.
Along with helping you schedule an interview, we help you get ready for it by 
looking at hardware and software tried and true for us, asking good questions to 
keep the conversation lively and engaging, and giving you examples of bad ques-
tions best avoided. Finally, we impart those always-valuable behind-the-scenes 
technical tips that make the interview go smoothly.

114      PART 2  The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
I’ll Have My People Call Your People: 
Interview Requests
The courage to submit an interview request comes simply from your interest in 
the interview subject. Script or compose an email to ask your favorite author, 
actor, sports celebrity, game streamer, podcaster, or whomever you want for an 
interview. You may need to submit the request multiple times, and sometimes you 
may have to work through numerous people simply to get a “no” as your final 
reply. That happens. It doesn’t mean that individual is mean, a rude person, or 
otherwise. They just don’t do interviews. For every “no,” you will find ten others 
who will enthusiastically say “yes.”
Here are some things you should keep in mind when working on the interview 
request:
»
» Market yourself and your show. A good deal of marketing is involved with 
podcasting. Your interview request needs to sell your services to the prospec-
tive interviewee. If you’re part of a podcasting network, be sure to mention 
that. Large listenership numbers are always helpful. Have you done interviews 
before? If so, do some name dropping. If not, a good place to start might be 
with other podcasters. They’re looking to get their names out and grow their 
listenerships also.
»
» What can I do for you? The person (or the person’s agent) is going ask 
“What’s in it for me (or my client)?” You need to ask yourself questions like: 
Does he or she have a new book coming out? Perhaps he or she is about to 
launch a special product? Find an angle and work with it.
»
» Be flexible. Remember, you’re asking for their time. There may be restrictions 
in your schedule and theirs. Sometimes you can get an interview within 
24 hours, and other times, you have to schedule it weeks or months in advance. 
You may have to take time off work from your regular job or rearrange other 
plans, just like the interview subject who is taking time out of his or her day to 
chat with you.
Don’t assume the person reading your interview request is going to know your 
podcast, or even what a podcast is. (Yes, we’ve been at this for over a decade and 
there are people who still don’t know what a podcast is.) You may have to explain 
your platform using alternative terms or a short explanation.

CHAPTER 6  Interview-Fu: Talk to Me, Grasshopper      115
Preparing for Interviews
There’s an approach that all interviewers, be they Barbara Walters or Stephen 
Colbert, should take in talking to guests — use a simple, basic plan to ask the 
questions that garner the best responses.
THE INTERVIEW REQUEST
One of the easiest ways to do interview requests is via email. It’s time to put on your 
marketing hat on top of your public relations hat and consider how you want to repre-
sent your show when sending queries. First, putting words like interview request or pod-
cast interview request in the subject tells readers what you want before they even open 
the message. Use a warm greeting, “Hello” followed by the person’s name is always a 
good start. Remember, you may not be sending the message to the interviewees 
directly, but rather must work through their agent or handler.
In the body of the message use the B.L.U.F rule — or Bottom Line Up Front. The first line 
of your message body should include something along the lines of “I am requesting an 
interview with Brent Spiner for the Warp 11 Podcast” — again, no doubt what you want. 
Don’t dive in to the details about your show yet. We know, it’s tempting right after you 
mention it by name, but remember, this query is about them. You can mention what 
your podcast is about with a one-liner about what you do (“Technorama is a show show-
casing the lighter side of the geek lifestyle. . .”) or it may be all in the title (“We would love 
to host an interview with Shohreh Aghdashloo in an upcoming episode of Happy Hour 
from the Tower: A Destiny Podcast”), but right now, the interview subject is your focus.
Explain why you want to speak with that person. Does he have any upcoming books, 
movies, or appearances he is interested in promoting? This would be a good time to 
mention how much time you are asking for. Asking someone for 2 hours is a much dif-
ferent consideration (and easier to say no to) than 15 minutes.
Now is when you can get on with describing your show, but don’t drone on — a couple 
sentences and perhaps some other notable names whom you have interviewed ought 
to be all you need. If you have an audio or video file that describes your show, include a 
link to that, as well.
Close with a respectful, yet positive salutation such as “I look forward to hearing back 
from you.” Remember, most people are very busy and may not respond back right 
away so you might need to follow up periodically. In some cases, several times. It took 
Chuck two years of polite, yet gentle, reminders to get an interview with Dr. Robert 
Ballard (the man who discovered the Titanic), but it was worth the effort.

116      PART 2  The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
Asking really great questions
Chances are good that if you’re new to podcasting, you’ve never held an interview 
quite like this  — an interpersonal, casual chat that could get a bit thought-­
provoking or downright controversial, depending on your podcast’s subject 
­matter. The interview may be arranged by you, or it may be prearranged for you. 
There’s a science to it, and here are just a few tips to take to heart so you can hold 
a good, engaging interview:
»
» Know whom you’re talking to and what to talk about. When guests appear 
on your show, it is a good idea to know at the very least the subject matter on 
which you will be talking about. Let’s say, for example, you are having an 
author appear on your show. If the author has written over a dozen books, be 
they fiction or non-fiction, trying to find the time to read all your guest’s books 
would seem an impossibility. So, do some homework. If the author guest has 
written a popular series, go online and research the series. Visit Wikipedia.
org and see if the series has a summary there. If you can only find limited 
information, find websites relevant to the topic of the series. If the series is 
steampunk, dig up information about the Victorian era. If the series follows 
a snarky, sentient robot, look up Artificial Intelligence. This has two effects: 
(1) You sound like you have a clue what the writer is writing about and (2) It 
allows you to ask better questions. These same rules apply for non-fiction 
authors, and really for guests of any background.
It’s also a good idea to visit guests’ websites (provided they have ’em). You 
don’t have to be an expert on their subject matter, but you should be familiar 
with it so you know in what direction to take the interview.
»
» Have your questions follow a logical progression. Say you’re interviewing a 
filmmaker who is working on a horror movie. A good progression for your 
interview would be something like this:
•	 What made you want to shoot a horror movie?
•	 What makes a good horror film?
•	 Who inspired you in this genre?
•	 In your opinion, what is the scariest film ever made?
You’ll notice these questions are all based around filmmaking, beginning and 
ending with a director’s choice. The progression of this interview starts specific 
on the current work and then broadens to a wider perspective. Most inter-
views should follow a progression like this, or they can start on a very broad 
viewpoint and slowly become more specific to the guest’s expertise.
»
» Ask open-ended questions. To understand open-ended questions, it’s 
simpler to explain closed-ended questions. Close-ended questions are the 

CHAPTER 6  Interview-Fu: Talk to Me, Grasshopper      117
kind that give you one-word answers — for example, “How long have you 
been studying plate tectonics?” Don’t count on your interviewee giving a 
dynamic answer to a question like that. Close-ended questions make the 
process harder than it needs to be. Instead, rephrase your question like “So 
what exactly got you interested in plate tectonics?”
Write down a series of questions that could fill your podcast with brief, 
one-or-two-word answers. This way, if you find yourself struggling, you have a 
hidden stockpile of questions to call upon. After a few quick answers, you can 
always fall back on the “Would you expand a bit on that please?” question.
»
» Prepare twice the number of questions that you think you’ll need. Some 
interviews you hear grind to a halt for no other reason than the interviewer 
believed that the guest would talk his head off on the first question. You’re 
certainly in for a bumpy ride when you ask a guest, “Tell the listener a little bit 
about your experience at WidgetCo” and the guest replies, “It was a lot of hard 
work, but rewarding.” (Yeah, this is going to get painful.)
Have a pad and a pen on hand, ready to go. In the middle of your interview, 
an answer may inspire a brand new question you would want to ask your 
guest about. Jot it down so you won’t forget it. Then ask this new question 
either as a follow-up, or in place of another question you have up and coming.
»
» Never worry about asking a stupid question. When asking questions that 
may sound obvious or frequently asked, remember: Chances are good that 
your audience has never heard them answered before. Okay, maybe a writer 
has been asked time and again, “Where do your ideas come from?” or a 
politician has heard, “So, when did you first start in politics?” often. When you 
have a guest present for a podcast, there’s no such thing as a stupid question; 
what’s dumb is not to ask a question that you think isn’t worth the guest’s 
time. He or she may be champing at the bit in hopes you will ask it.
Leave room for spontaneous questions as mentioned above. Listen to your guest’s 
answers and see if a new path has opened up. She may be tense while answering 
the same questions for the 50th time, but if you strike a chord and stumble on 
a piece she is passionate about, abandon the questions for a bit and follow the trail!
Avoiding really bad questions
Before you start percolating and dream up a few questions based on the preceding 
tips, stop and think about the interviews you’ve listened to where things suddenly 
headed south. Usually the interviewers find themselves with guests they know 
nothing about and they are expected to interview them on the fly, or the host 
ambushes the guest with questions that dig into something that’s out of the 
guest’s scope or none of the interviewer’s business. We’ve piled up the typical 
gaffes in a prime example of a good interview gone bad.

118      PART 2  The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
Every podcaster should know how to turn a pleasant conversation sour (uh, this is 
a satire and not a recipe, okay?), and the following blunders should do it faster 
than an Uwe Boll movie is in and out of theaters:
»
» Ask inappropriate questions. Keep in mind your podcast is not 60 Minutes, 
HardTalk, or even Jerry Springer. If you want to fire off hard-hitting-tell-all- 
mudslinging questions, think about who your audience is, whom you’re talking 
to, and whether the question is within the ability of the guest to answer honestly 
and openly. If not, an awkward moment may be the least of your worries. 
Inappropriate questions can also be those irrelevant, wacky, off-the-wall, and 
far-too-personal questions for your guests. “Who was the rudest person you 
have ever worked with on a set?” could put a stunt performer’s career into 
jeopardy if answered earnestly. “What’s the worst book you’ve ever read?” 
could drop a writer into hot water with colleagues. Asking athletes “You are in 
fantastic shape. Do you sleep naked?” could easily derail an interview quickly. 
Maybe these wild card questions work for shock jocks, but when you have an 
opportunity to interview people you respect in your field, do you really want to 
ask them something like, “Boxers, briefs, or none of the above?” Think about 
what you’re going to ask before you actually do.
»
» Continue to pursue answers to inappropriate questions. If a question has 
been deemed inappropriate by a guest, don’t continue to ask it. Move on to 
the next question and continue forward into the interview. Podcasts are by no 
means an arena for browbeating guests into submission till they break down 
in tears and cough up the ugly, sordid details of their lives.
Are there exceptions to this exception? We would say, yes, depending on the 
content of your podcast. Say after reading — and enjoying — Podcasting For 
Dummies, you decide to become the Zach Galifianakis of podcasting, complete 
with the foliage as your backdrop. Of course, if you’re after irreverent material 
for your show and push that envelope as far as you can, your guests may not 
want to play along — especially if they don’t get the joke. If that’s the case, 
expect your guests to get up and walk away. Even in the most idyllic situations, 
guests can (and do) reserve the right to do that.
»
» Turn the interview into the Me show. Please remember that the spotlight 
belongs to your guest. Tee recalls a podcast where — no kidding — the 
three-person crew invited a guest on their writing podcast to talk about their 
books and their methodology of writing . . . only to launch into a ten-minute 
discussion between themselves on a completely unrelated topic, leaving the 
guest on the other side of their mic. Silent. For ten minutes.
Yes, it is your podcast, but when a guest is introduced into the mix, you’re 
surrendering control of the show to him or her, and that isn’t necessarily a 
bad thing. Let guests enjoy the spotlight; your audience will appreciate them 
for being there, which adds a new dimension to your feed. One way to avoid 

CHAPTER 6  Interview-Fu: Talk to Me, Grasshopper      119
the me-factor is to think of yourself as a liaison for the listener. Ask yourself, 
“As a listener, what questions would I ask or information would I be looking 
for from the guest?”
»
» Disrespect your guests. This has happened to Tee as an interview subject. 
He’s answered some questions that made him uncomfortable, and requested 
podcasters to please edit out the question and related awkward response. In 
most cases, the podcast respected his request. The others who did not bother 
to edit their podcasts? Well, he no longer fields queries from them. With that 
experience, Tee extends the same courtesy to his guests. Why? He wants to 
avoid blacklists. Also, interview subjects talk to their friends. You want them to 
speak positively of you and your podcast. Show them respect, and those 
guests worth your time will do the same.
Feelin’ the synergy
One final note on preparing for interviews: We’ve heard some guests say, “I’m 
doing these interviewers a favor by going on their show.” And we’ve been told by 
other show hosts, “We’re doing you a great favor with this chance to showcase 
your work on our show.”
Both opinions are not just arrogant, they’re just flat-out wrong.
The reality is that host and guest are working together to create a synergy. The 
interviewer has a chance to earn a wider audience and display mastery of journal-
istic techniques. The guest has a chance to get into the public eye, stay in the 
public eye, and talk about the next big thing he or she has coming in sight of said 
public eye. Working together, guest and host create a seamless promotional 
machine for one another.
If you decide to take on the art of the interview, keep these facts in mind; you and 
your guests will have your best chance to work together to create something 
special.
If your format allows it, ask your guest for an ID that you can drop in from time to 
time. You’ve probably heard these before on radio stations “Hi, this is Rex Kramer, 
danger seeker. You may remember me from such films as Airplane and The Ken-
tucky Fried Movie, and you’re listening to The Shameless Self-Promoting Podcast.” If 
the interview guests want to be more creative, let them. These are a great self-­
promotion tool, a whole lot of fun, and a way to remind your listener of previous 
accomplishments. Remember to ask politely, and be aware that not everyone will 
(or can) comply.

Recording Interviews with Skype
Unless you’re conducting in-person interviews, your podcast just got a bit more 
technically complicated. You need to have the appropriate software to record your 
interview over the phone.
One option of recording your interviews is with Skype (www.skype.com). What 
makes Skype appealing to podcasters is its expandability of the application, avail-
able for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Skype is the vehicle to make your calls, but it 
lacks the feature to record them. You can record Skype conversations with various 
methods and use downloadable software to monitor levels and volume as you 
record. You can also use Skype with a little more hardware for similar results. We 
discuss all your options  — whether software or hardware  — in the following 
sections.
As stated in Chapter 5, there are legal restrictions concerning the recording of 
telephone/Skype calls, and these restrictions vary from country to country, state 
to state, and region to region. Compliance with these laws is the responsibility of 
the podcaster. Always ask for permission (or better yet, get it in writing) before 
recording phone calls.
Recording using software
Recording using software or hardware — once again you’re faced with choices. 
Software solutions are typically less complex to set up and use and cost less; 
­however, they can put more load on the computer’s CPU. If the CPU is too busy, it 
could impact the quality of the recording. The following sections cover some soft-
ware options for recording Skype calls.
Call Recorder
Call Recorder for the Mac from eCamm Network (www.ecamm.com/mac/
callrecorder) is a handy little piece of software with a simple interface that 
allows you to record Skype audio and video and save it to one of many formats for 
later editing. The only downside of Call Recorder is that the file is recorded as a 
robust MOV file. To reduce its size (for archiving purposes or to produce a smaller 
MP3 from), you need to run it through a media player like QuickTime Pro, produc-
ing a streamlined AIFF or WAV file. However, this step isn’t necessary if you’re 
using GarageBand or Logic Pro. If you don’t have the money for a mixer and 
­second computer (or portable recording device), the $29.95 investment is a 
great deal.

CHAPTER 6  Interview-Fu: Talk to Me, Grasshopper      121
SoundTap
For Windows users, SoundTap, from NCH Swift Sound (www.nch.com.au/ 
soundtap/index.html), lets you record just about any audio that plays through 
your Windows computer. Simply install the software and turn it on, and then all 
sound played on or through the PC, including Skype calls, will be recorded as WAV 
or MP3 files. All audio is tapped by a virtual driver, so the process is perfect digital 
quality. Current pricing for SoundTap is $29.99.
WireTap Studio
As mentioned in Chapter  3, WireTap Studio from Ambrosia Software (www.
ambrosiasw.com/utilities/wiretap) lets you record just about any audio that 
plays through your Mac and allows you to record from a second source such as 
your mixer, iTunes, or another media player.
As for the steps involved in recording a Skype interview with WireTap Studio, it’s 
a piece of cake:
1.	 Launch WireTap Studio and make sure the Controller window (shown 
in Figure 6-1) is visible. You can access it either by choosing Window ➪    
Controller or by pressing ⌘  +0.
2.	 From the Controller’s top menu, select one incoming source of audio. 
From the menu underneath it, select your second input source.
The image on the right in Figure 6-1 shows you the input menus for the 
running applications that can serve as an audio input source.
3.	 Choose File ➪   Preferences to access the Preferences of your WireTap 
Studio Pro application.
The Preferences window appears, as shown in Figure 6-2.
FIGURE 6-1: 
WireTap Studio’s 
Controller 
window (left) 
allows you to 
select two 
separate 
incoming sources 
of audio on your 
Mac (right) for 
recording and 
mixing.

122      PART 2  The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
4.	 Click the Source button at the top of the Preferences window. Have your 
interview subject (on Skype) talk as you check your own levels (on the 
mixer, USB microphone, and so on).
5.	 Click the Format option to select an audio format.
You can record your audio as an AIFF, a WAV, or another uncompressed digital 
audio format or it can go directly to MP3 to the compression settings of your 
choosing.
6.	 Close this window and then return to the Controller. The large, dark circle 
is the Record button. Single-click that to begin recording.
7.	 When the interview is concluded, end the recording by clicking the Stop 
button (the dark square).
Automatically WireTap Studio pulls up a window with the waveform of your 
newly recorded audio (see Figure 6-3). Here you have tools available for 
editing, creating loops, and creating basic audio effects. For more on the 
capabilities of these tools, review the online tutorials for WireTap Studio at 
www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/wiretap/videos.html.
8.	 When your recording is ready, you can select it from WireTap’s Library 
window and then click either the iTunes or the Local Disk button from 
the Send To options at the bottom of the window.
If the Library window isn’t displayed, choose Window ➪   WireTap Studio Library 
to display it. Check out Figure 6-4.
Your WireTap recording is then sent to your desired location either for ID3 tag 
editing (see Chapter 10) or for further editing.
FIGURE 6-2:

window in 
WireTap Studio 
gives you an

CHAPTER 6  Interview-Fu: Talk to Me, Grasshopper      123
WireTap Studio is the pricier of the software options at $69, but when you con-
sider its capabilities of mixing in two separate audio sources, editing, ID3 tagging, 
and exporting options, it’s an easy and reliable recording resource for those 
important Skype interviews.
Skype uses VoIP (Voiceover Internet Protocol) to do what it needs to do to help you 
host and hold audio and video conferences. If you have a good Internet connection 
and want an all-in-one solution, consider looking into Zencastr (http://
zencastr.com) as a possible solution for recording interviews. It will require that 
your interview subject on the other side of the website has audio hardware hooked 
up on her end, but the result is audio so cleanly recorded, you would think both 
host and guest are in the same room together.
FIGURE 6-3: 
After you make 
your recording,

124      PART 2  The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
Recording using hardware
If recording using software has your head spinning, using hardware may simplify 
things a bit. The key to the operation is a device called a mixer. (You can find more 
details on mixers in Chapter 2.) You’ve probably seen mixers at music concerts or 
television studios — those are for the big boys and tend to be quite expensive. 
Fortunately for you, there are less expensive options that cost as little as $50.
The idea behind a mixer is to take multiple inputs and mix them to create an 
­output. An input can be a microphone, a computer, an MP3 player, an electronic 
keyboard, or just about anything with an audio output to feed in to the mixer. For 
interviews, your input will come from the microphone, and your interviewee will 
be coming from a computer running Skype. The output needs to go to a recording 
device such as an MP3 player or a second computer. Why do you need a second 
device? Well, the output can’t go to the machine running Skype, or your inter-
viewee would hear his or her own voice (probably with annoying lag), and that 
would be bad.
Figure 6-5 shows an example setup that provides the ability to record Skype calls 
using a little more hardware.
FIGURE 6-5: 
Use a mixer and a 
recorder for 
recording remote 
guests.

CHAPTER 6  Interview-Fu: Talk to Me, Grasshopper      125
For standard studio recording, the mixer is quite simple — microphones, com-
puters, perhaps an MP3 player in the input port (or channels), and your main 
output going to a recording device. Of course, because we’re talking about inter-
views, who wants simple?
Alright, it’s not that complex. Whether you have a basic four-channel mixer or 
something the size of a cruise ship, most mixers have the same basic layout and 
features. Plugging in a microphone to a single audio channel is straightforward. 
Adding the stereo output of a second computer is also simple (given you have the 
right connecting cables). The real fun begins when you need to get your output 
back to the Skype machine and the recording device. This is where you need to 
take advantage of your mixer’s aux send (sometimes called effects send) port. This 
is an output port that you will feed back to your Skype machine. So, the question 
now becomes, how do you get your microphone input sent out the aux send?
You see, most mixers can create multiple mixes. The main mix is what you typi-
cally record, but there are often hidden mixers, called buses, that let you create an 
alternative mix. How cool is that? You thought you were just buying one mixer, 
and you got yourself one (or more) for free! To make use of this additional output 
mix, locate the row of knobs on your mixer labeled Aux, which often are red in 
color. (If you have more than one row of Aux knobs on your mixer, each row 
­corresponds to a separate aux send channel.) These are the volume controls for 
your aux send. If you turn up the volume on your microphone, whatever is 
­connected to listen to the aux send output will hear it.
For example, if your Skype computer is connected to input channels 3 and 4, you 
want the red knobs on those channels turned all the way down so that input isn’t 
fed back to the output on the aux send channel. This is called mix minus 1 because 
you’re taking the entire mix minus one input (the Skype machine). For a 
short  video tutorial, watch the video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v= 
au47Ferbxfc.
Prepping Your Green Room for Guests
A guest could be your dad, your mother-in-law, your best friend, or the man on 
the street. It could also be the friend of a friend who can get you on the phone with 
your favorite author, actor, or athlete. When you’re interviewing, you have a 
­second party to worry about.
Removing the “technical difficulties” element usually means either taking the 
show to the guests or bringing the guests to the show. This kind of interview not 

126      PART 2  The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
only is the most fun to do, but also gives you direct contact with the subject so you 
can observe body language, facial expressions, and reactions to questions and 
answers.
Welcoming in-studio guests
When you have guests visit your facilities — and because you’re podcasting, this 
is probably your house — make them feel at home. Offer them something to drink. 
Offer to take them on a tour of your humble abode. Introduce them to your family. 
The point is to be polite. You don’t have to cook dinner for them, but offering a 
hint of hospitality, be it a glass of water (or a beer, if you’ve ever worked closely 
with the Binary Studio crew), is a nice touch.
If you’re having in-studio interviews, it’s also a good idea to get your home and 
yourself ready to receive guests. Sure, Tee has recorded quite a few podcasts in his 
pajamas, but because he’s working with his wife or recording short stories for his 
podcast, he’s allowed. If fantasy and science fiction authors Terry Brooks and 
Catherine Asaro ever come over to his house for an interview, don’t think he’d be 
greeting them in his Avenger jammies and Stone Brewery slippers.
Okay, maybe he would greet them wearing the Stone slippers, but he would be 
bathed and dressed and have his teeth brushed and hair combed. The key word 
here is guest. Treat them as such. Be cool, be pleasant, be nice. And if you’re a 
guest on someone else’s podcast, the same rules apply. Don’t prop your feet up on 
the furniture, don’t demand hospitality, and don’t be a jerk during the interview.
The in-studio visit is an audition for both guest and host. If the guest is abrasive, 
abusive, and just plain rude, chances are good that the guest will never be invited 
back, no matter how well the previous interview goes. If a host asks unapproved 
questions, continues to pry into personal matters that have nothing to do with the 
interview, or seems determined to take over the interview spotlight as if trying to 
impress the guest, said guest may never return, even if extended an invitation.
Meeting guests on their own turf
Be cool, be pleasant, be nice. These same rules apply when you take your podcast 
on the road. You may find yourself at a person’s home, place of business, or some 
other neutral place. You’re now practicing  — for the lack of a better term  —  
guerilla journalism, ambushing unsuspecting people with questions that may not 
strike you as hard and probing but could be to people who don’t expect them. 
Make certain to show respect to your guests, wherever you are when the interview 
takes place.

CHAPTER 6  Interview-Fu: Talk to Me, Grasshopper      127
A good approach for getting good interviews is to ask permission of your guests, 
be they passersby or experts at their place of business, to interview them. Shoving 
a microphone in someone’s face and blurting out a question is hardly a great way 
to introduce yourself and your podcast to the world. If the guest you want to inter-
view has a handler or liaison, it’s good protocol to follow the suggestions and 
advice of the guest’s staff.
If you start out with a warm, welcoming smile and explain what you’re doing and 
why, most people open up and are happy to talk.
When interviewing people on the street or in the moment, there are some  
easy ways to identify yourself. Michael Butler of The Rock and Roll Geek Show 
(http://www.americanheartbreak.com/rnrgeekwp) uses a mic cube around his 
­microphone — these are sometimes called mic flags. The classic cube usually has a 
logo identifying a network, a show, or an organization affiliated with the inter-
viewer. You can find mic cubes online (unprinted) starting around $25. There’s also 
the simple greeting, “Hi, do I have your permission to record this for a podcast?”
Just as with the phone and Skype interviews, test your equipment. You’re now out 
of the controlled environment of your home studio; you must deal with surround-
ing ambient noise and how well your interview is recording amid uncontrolled 
background variables. Set up your equipment; power up your laptop, mixing 
board, and mics; and record a few words. Then play back your tests and set your 
levels accordingly. When you have your setup running, you’re ready to get your 
interviews.
Ensuring Trouble-Free Recordings
When it comes to recording conversations, here are a few points to keep in mind 
before asking the first question:
»
» Get permission to record conversations, even if the interview is prear-
ranged. Laws (both federal and state) prohibit the recording of conversations 
without permission, and further restrictions limit broadcasting these conver-
sations. If you plan to record and publish a conversation, get the subject’s 
consent (for both) beforehand, both verbally and in written communication 
(even email) to make sure your legal issues are covered.
»
» Test the calling equipment. If you have arranged a phone-in (or Skype-in) 
interview with someone for your podcast — say, a favorite musician or 
politician — prepare for the interview ahead of time. Skype (or phone) a friend 
to conduct a mock interview and make sure the recording setup not only 
works but also sounds good.

128      PART 2  The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
The bandwidth demand increases the more people you conference through 
your computer. Reception will be affected, so if you know more than one 
person will be involved in this interview, it’s a good idea to test how many 
people you can effectively conference in one call.
»
» Check your batteries. If you’re using a portable recorder (such as the Zoom 
H4n Pro), make sure your batteries are charged and you have spares. (Check 
the spares, too.) If you’re really paranoid or live in an environment with 
periodic electrical problems, you can also pick up an uninterruptable power 
supply in case your main power cuts out.
»
» Check your storage space. Hard drives and solid-state devices are getting 
bigger and cheaper, but that doesn’t mean they’re infinite. Audio files can be 
big — especially if you’re recording to a raw format like WAV or AIFF! If you run 
out of space in the middle of recording a show or an interview, you lose time; 
lose pace; and in the case of interviews, lose face with your interviewee. If 
you’re recording to a portable recording device, it’s basically the same idea. 
Know how much storage you have, in megabytes or gigabytes, and how long 
you can record at your current bitrate. Don’t worry; we talk more about 
bitrates in Chapter 10.
If you’re doing an interview with multiple Skype participants (known as confer-
encing), it’s often best to have the person with the highest-power CPU host the 
meeting. That person should initiate the call and invite the other attendees one at 
a time. The better the CPU, the better the conference will run and the better your 
recording will sound. Also, the conference host may or may not be the same as the 
person recording the call. Remember, your goal during an interview is to try and 
minimize the chances for problems.
And although this may sound a bit pessimistic, be ready for things to go wrong. 
Guests might not show up for interviews. Also, new high-tech toys, if not given a 
proper preinterview shakedown, may not come through. Prepare to have plenty of 
topics to discuss on your own, and then your podcast can continue following 
a  quick disclaimer. In podcasting, sticking to a regular schedule is reassuring 
to  your listeners because they know you’ll offer new feeds consistently and 
punctually.

So What Are You Waiting 
For? Record, Already!
O
kay, you’ve most likely gone through the hardware and software gadgets 
from Chapters 2, 3, and 4. In this chapter, we make the bold assumption 
that you’ve made your purchasing selections, hooked up all the hardware 
according to the supplied documentation (you did read the documentation, right?), 
chosen your software, and gotten everything ready to record. This is it! You have 
a microphone pointing in the direction of your mouth, just waiting anxiously for 
you to begin podcasting.
Okay then. What’s stopping you?
Perhaps you have no clue how you sound to your recording equipment, or perhaps 
you’re still trying to understand why your smooth and sultry voice sounds like you 
just finished a dozen espressos. The problem could be in your audio application’s 
sound settings. Too much pep in the voice, and you sound like Rob Zombie croon-
ing a goth’s delight. Too little amplification, and you’d be better off if you just 
went out to your front porch and shouted your podcast’s content.
Before the podcast gets underway with your single-click or touch of the Record 
button, you must set levels. That’s a very fancy-schmancy way to say fiddling with 
knobs and sliders on your mixing board or your audio-editing software. Setting 

130      PART 2  The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
levels ensure that the signal you’re sending through the microphone is loud and 
clear. Once the technical side is running smoothly, give some thought to your 
voice  — things like timing and enunciation  — as how you say your message 
directly impacts the listeners’ interest in what you’re saying.
Did Your Sound Check Clear the Bank?
If you show up early enough for a rock concert, you see those roadies setting up 
microphones, playfully waving to the crowd as they speak quickly into a micro-
phone “Check one, check two, check-check-check!” It’s a staple for rock ’n’ 
­rollers to do such a mic check because the fans expect a good performance — it 
needs to be done.
With podcasting, your own mic check should be more involved. In Chapter 5, we 
recommend you perform such an audio diagnostic just to assure yourself (and, if 
applicable, your guests) that the equipment is working and sound is, in fact, 
reaching your computer. The goal is not only to confirm that your mic is picking 
up sound, but also to check the volume of the voices — yours and that of whoever 
else is involved in this podcast.
Understanding dB levels
Setting levels is quite easy, provided you know where your decibel (dB) input levels 
are displayed on your software. The decibel unit is used to express the intensity of 
sound, beginning at -9 dB for the least perceptible sound to approximately 130 for 
an intensely loud sound level. Your readout measures how hot you are (in this 
instance, that’s the power of your voice, not how good you look) on the micro-
phone. Audio signal strength (measured in decibels) is the amount of power that 
goes into the signal, which affects how clearly it can be heard and how hard it hits 
the ears. “Loud and clear” is good; too much signal strength causes distortion, 
and that’s a pain to listen to.
In vintage radio and audio equipment, this dB display was a VU (volume unit) 
meter — the little needle that bounced in response to your voice. Later, the needle 
was replaced by lights that reacted when you spoke into a microphone, going from 
green to yellow to orange to red. What the lights said was pretty easy to 
translate:
»
» Green: Well, I can hear you, but wow, are you quiet!
»
» Yellow-Orange: You’re coming in loud and clear.

CHAPTER 7  So What Are You Waiting For? Record, Already!      131
»
» Red: You’re in danger of hitting the distortion level (clipping).
»
» Red with double bars: Your audio is going to sound distorted.
Across hardware and software, the volume meters appear different (Figure 7-1 
shows the volume meter display for Audacity), but they all serve the same pur-
pose: to make sure your content is heard clearly. Your aim, as you speak and watch 
the indicators speak back, is to keep your dB levels bouncing in the high level (low 
red) without lighting up those double bars. When you attain that average, your 
voice is rising and falling within a good balanced dynamic range. Try to keep 
things a little lower — in the red and orange range — with only the high points 
(when you raise your voice) going in to the red occasionally. You can always bring 
up the low spots with some simple post production tips (described later in this 
chapter).
Because microphones, audio-capture cards, and mixing boards all work at differ-
ent sensitivity levels, it’s best to test your voice before you record. If your levels 
are in the green, it means you’re loud enough to be heard by your equipment but 
still so soft that people will have to crank up the volume on their computers or 
portable MP3 players, consequently blowing out their eardrums on the next 
­podcast or playlist.
If your recording is too loud (or “hot”), it tends to cause problems for listeners. 
Listeners have their MP3 players set for a pleasant, comfortable volume . . . and 
suddenly your show begins with guns blazing and pipes blaring. As your levels 
reach deep into the red, listeners fumble for their players and try to turn down the 
sound so the program can be understandable through its own distortion. Sadly, 
the modulation is such a problem that your voice crackles and growls as it tram-
ples the volume limits of your recording equipment, even at the lower volume. 
Worse yet, some programs and microphones will even cut the signal from the mic 
for a second, leaving you with chunks of missing audio  — and you may not 
­discover this until after your precious recording is over!

132      PART 2  The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
You want to try to avoid clipping to prevent that distorted sound. Clipping is when 
you’re feeding too much signal to your equipment. It can come from many sources, 
including incorrect settings on a microphone or other audio input, incorrect set-
tings on a mixer, or the preferences in your software. Once audio is clipped, you 
can’t get the original (or intended) quality back.
In achieving a balance in your audio, you could spend the day setting and resetting 
those levels in quest of dB nirvana. That’s time spent, but not well spent. It makes 
more sense to practice until you get a pretty good sense of what your best working 
level is and get comfortable speaking into a mic at that level. Time to go mano-a- 
mano with setting the levels.
Setting your levels
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to keep your levels about 0 dB, 
dipping and spiking when necessary. For podcasting, consistency is key. You have 
your mixer turned on (if you have one), your mic is plugged in and turned on —  
check — and your software is running. Now follow these steps to check levels:
1.	 Begin talking into the mic about your podcast topic or plans.
You can do a scripted test read or just talk off the top of your head, but be sure 
to speak in the manner and mood of your podcast.
Instead of speaking to thin air in the vague direction of the mic (or the person 
next to you), speak in the exact direction of the mic, pointing your voice directly 
at the recording device (as shown in Figure 7-2). Even if the mic isn’t omnidirec-
tional (meaning it picks up sounds from all directions at once), it can pick up 
your voice better this way.
CALLING IN THE CREW
It’d be great to set your levels so that “0 dB” is always where your lights remain, but 
recording is a real-world activity. Sometimes your meter may never reach yellow, and 
other times it might hit the double red bars. If your goal is to maintain perfect levels 
from the beginning to the end of a recording session, an audio crew can work with you 
in rehearsal and performance, adjusting levels when you go loud and when you go soft.
The downside of hiring a crew is an added expense to producing your podcast. Even if 
the crew is a collection of audio geek friends, it can still cost you sending for a lot of 
pizza every time you record.

CHAPTER 7  So What Are You Waiting For? Record, Already!      133
If you speak directly into the microphone, you might hear some sounds —  
particularly ps and bs — causing an effect known as popping. An investment 
of less than $20 in a windscreen or pop filter can fix that. This device is a foam 
or nylon filter that stops the wind made by your mouth from hitting the 
microphone’s diaphragm and causing distortion.
2.	 While you’re talking (or if you’re monitoring by playing back your test 
takes), keep an eye on your dB levels on the computer screen.
If the levels are spiking into the double-red/red area or remaining in the green, 
check your input volume settings on your mixing board or audio-editing 
software. This might require a bit of multitasking on your part, but continue to 
adjust the input levels while talking, as you watch the input meters.
3.	 Rerecord your voice at the new settings.
Try to speak in the same manner and inflection as you did on the first 
­recording.
4.	 As you review the second take, watch the dB input levels and adjust 
accordingly.
When in doubt, err on the side of caution on the input levels. Record your 
volume a little low. You can always correct it in post-production. One way to 
increase the volume later, using Audacity, is to select your audio and use the 
Effects ➪   Amplify feature to bring it up. Another is to save your audio to WAV 
format and use a tool called The Levelator (http://conversationsnetwork.
org/levelator) to fix the levels.

THERE’S A RIGHT WAY AND  
A WRONG WAY . . .
Time for a confession.
When Tee got his MXL990, it was his first studio condenser microphone. He was so 
excited about this microphone he failed to check the small slip of paper included that 
told him how to talk into it. Perhaps it was the excitement of venturing into new fron-
tiers of creativity that made him hook up the equipment without reading the directions. 
Maybe it was a bold assumption that he knew what end to talk into with a mic as he had 
worked with (dynamic) microphones before. Whatever the reason, Tee was speaking 
into the microphone incorrectly (left image). His friends in the podosphere, on seeing 
Tee in action, didn’t really have the heart to tell him so — or didn’t know any better 
themselves.
Fortunately, Evo Terra of The Opportunistic Travelers (https://www.theopportunistic 
travelers.com) is a heartless evil mastermind. He told Tee he was doing it wrong, as 
any heartless evil mastermind would. On a podcast, naturally.
All microphones do not behave the same, and condenser microphones work best when 
speaking into them properly (right image), with the microphone pointed straight down. 
Tee, reflecting on Evo’s “kind” advice, positioned the mic accordingly and continues to 
do so to present day. When hooking up microphones, refer to the enclosed documenta-
tion for additional and essential information on getting the best sound out of your 
microphone.
You, too, can avoid the embarrassment (caught forever) that published photographs 
may deliver upon you . . . regardless of how good the content it generates for your 
­podcast.

CHAPTER 7  So What Are You Waiting For? Record, Already!      135
After you set your levels, make a note of the settings somewhere other than your 
computer (using, say, a smartphone or its retro ancestor — a legal pad and pen), 
in case your preferences are lost or fiddled out of whack by somebody’s child or 
best friend playing spaceship in your studio. (Yes, even adults enjoy playing 
spaceship with super-cool-looking equipment!) That way, even if something 
awful happens to your application’s preferences or your mixing board, you always 
have your last known settings to reference.
Noises Off: Capturing Ambient Noise
Part of the charm that is podcasting is just how varied the content is, as well as 
how spontaneous the shows tend to be when the Record button is hit. Some pod-
casters believe that a “true” podcast (whatever that is!) must record everything in 
one take and deliver its content to listeners completely unedited. This supposed 
mark of authenticity includes any background noise (also called ambient noise) 
you happen to capture while recording — from comforting sounds like rustling 
trees and birdcalls, to the more grating one like pounding car stereos and 
jackhammers.
Hey, if that’s the style of your show, that’s great. However, if you’re trying to take 
listeners to a place in their imagination, read on to find out how to reduce or 
eliminate ambient noise.
Identifying ambient noise
As we discuss in both Chapters 4 and 8, how much you edit depends on what kind 
of content you’re presenting. For example, if you’re doing an off-the-cuff, 
off-the-wall podcast about your life and a typical day in it, you may just grab the 
VideoMic Me, plug it into your iPhone, and head out the door, recording every step 
along the way. This kind of podcast can be (note we said can be) easiest to record. 
You’re podcasting a slice of Americana . . . or Britannia, if you’re in the United 
Kingdom . . . or Kiwiana if podcasting from the Land of Hobbits, Championship 
Rugby, and Pavlova. Especially if your goal is to capture the look and feel of your 
culture, ambient noise is not only welcomed, but desired. Up to a point.
Some podcasters cringe at the mere mention of ambient noise — ambient noise 
like . . . well, what was in Tee’s very first podcast. When he podcasted MOREVI: The 
Chronicles of Rafe & Askana back in 2005, he worked to create a magical setting with 
voice, story, music, special effects . . . a world that was completely shattered by 
real-world interference like school buses, kids at recess, UPS trucks, the Virginia 
Commuter Rail system, and air traffic from two nearby airports. Even if you love 

136      PART 2  The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
the source of the ambient noise, sometimes it just doesn’t fit what the podcast is 
trying to do.
The best noise reduction happens in preproduction. If your podcast could do with-
out input from the outside world, strategically scheduling recording sessions is 
the start of your production. Try recording at night or early morning. You’ll find 
that traffic is lighter, the kids are in bed, construction crews aren’t running those 
earlier-mentioned jackhammers, animals typically are less active — all adding up 
to less ambient noise, hence fewer takes on the mic.
Minimizing ambient noise
To reduce the intrusion of the outside world, record anytime during the day, and 
still maintain a budget, some creativity is in order.
Truth be told, there really isn’t an easy solution to podcasting in a noisy world. 
One not-so-cost-effective answer is to rent a studio and record your podcast 
there. Unless you have a sponsor who bankrolls your costs, your hobby could eas-
ily max out credit cards and cast a hungry eye upon your nest egg. (Let’s not even 
go there.)
A somewhat-less-expensive option is to soundproof your home-based recording 
room. That may sound simple, but it can involve a lot of home improvement 
before you have one room in which you can be sure the only sound is yours. But is 
it impossible or impractical? Not really. P.G. Holyfield of the podcast novel Murder 
at Avedon Hill 
(https://scribl.com/books/P4C82/murder-at-avedon-hill) 
built his own studio for podcasting.
Holyfield’s do-it-yourself adventure began with a house hunt, so a studio in a 
finished basement was on the list of what the house needed. The studio eventually 
came about from a large storeroom, a few new walls, and the addition of an air 
vent. The newly created 7-x-8-foot room was then soundproofed with foam tiles 
that cost around $500. Holyfield found the effort worthwhile. “The studio is 
working out great. It was amazing to hear the difference as the foam went up. 
Now I have a completely silent room, except when the A/C turns on, which I can 
turn off most times, since the basement is pretty cool.” Figure 7-3 shows the 
process he went through: the arrival of acoustical foam (left), measuring twice 
and cutting once (center), and the studio (right). The advantage of being in the 
basement is far less outside noise entering through the walls. The advantage of 
the acoustic foam is to reduce sound waves bouncing off the walls and creating 
unwanted effects.

CHAPTER 7  So What Are You Waiting For? Record, Already!      137
Renovation, especially if you’re a fan of the DIY Network, makes this kind of 
home-built studio a possibility, but still may not be a practical solution for all 
homeowners. And this kind of aggressive home improvement is seriously frowned 
upon if you’re renting an apartment.
You can keep this home renovation affordable and within the lease agreement 
terms:
»
» Stuff towels under the door. It decreases the amount of sound from inside 
your house filtering into your recording area.
»
» Keep the microphone as far away from your computer as possible. Its fan 
(if audible) simply becomes part of the natural ambiance for the podcasting 
room.
»
» Turn off any ceiling fans, floor heaters, additional air conditioners, or 
room ionizers. With fewer appliances running, you have less chance of 
additional ambient sound being created.
»
» If you do encounter ambient noise that you don’t want in your podcast, 
simply give it a few moments. Wait until the noise subsides, pause, and 
then pick up your podcast a few lines before the interruption. That’s for the 
sake of post-production: With a substantial gap in your podcast activity, you 
can easily narrow down where your edits are needed.
When noise interferes with your podcast, leaving gaps of silence so you know 
where to edit isn’t exactly a foolproof method. Always set aside enough time to 
listen to your podcast — and really listen, not just play it back while you clean the 
office or call a friend. Make sure levels are even, no segments are repeated, and 
the final product is ready for uploading and posting.
Many podcasts rely on ambient noise to set a mood, but sometimes reality just 
doesn’t cut it. If you want to put more craft into the setting for your podcast, the 
ideas in this section should help you keep the background down to a dull roar.

138      PART 2  The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
When holding podcasts on location, make sure the ambiance — be it a particularly 
busy crosswalk at a street corner, a frequented bar, or backstage at a concert — 
does not overwhelm your voice. Background noise belongs in (well, yeah) the 
background. Its intent is to set a tone for the aim of the podcast, not to become the 
podcast itself. It would also be a good idea, if possible, to do a few test recordings 
in the space to see how much volume you’ll need and how close to the mic you 
must be to be heard.
Now Take Your Time and Hurry Up:  
Pacing and Clock Management
Podcasts, whether short and sweet or epic and ambitious, all share something in 
common: the need for pacing. As a rule, you don’t want to blurt out the aim or 
intent of your podcast in the opening 5 minutes and then pad the remaining 10 or 
15 with fluff. Nor do you want to drone on and on (and on . . .) till suddenly you 
must rush frantically into why you’re podcasting on this day about this topic. Give 
yourself ample time to set the mood comfortably and competently and make it to 
the intent without dawdling. Enjoy your podcast but respect your listeners’ time. 
Make certain you don’t overstay your welcome. The trick in pacing is to under-
stand how much time you have to get your message across.
The big question is how to really grasp how much time you really have. Where to 
start?
It’s a good idea to get a grasp of how much time you really have in one whole 
minute. To do this, find a clock, watch, or a stopwatch and for 1 minute (and only 
1 minute) sit quietly and do nothing, say nothing, and remain perfectly still. That 
1 minute will feel like a short eternity. Now imagine that 1 minute times 15. (No, 
no, no — do not repeat this exercise for 15 minutes. There’s a fine line between an 
exercise and a complete waste of time.)
Fifteen minutes (for a start) is a good amount of time on your hands, so you 
should make certain that in your podcast you take your time to get to the message. 
The journey you take your listeners on doesn’t necessarily have to occupy all that 
time — be it 15, 20, or 30 minutes — but you have time to play. That’s the most 
important thing to remember as you set your best podcasting pace.

CHAPTER 7  So What Are You Waiting For? Record, Already!      139
Take the potato out of your  
mouth and enunciate
It isn’t out of the ordinary to fire up the mic and launch into your podcast with 
enough energy and vitality to power a small shire in England. Nothing wrong 
with that — until you go back and listen to yourself. Your words, phrases, and 
thoughts are running together and forming one turbulent, muddy stream of 
thought. Yes, that is your voice, but even you’re having a tough time understand-
ing what the podcast is about and what the podcaster is saying . . . and you’re the 
podcaster!
One way of getting a grip on pacing yourself through a podcast is enunciation —  
pronouncing your words distinctly, explaining your topic clearly — and there is 
no better way to do that than to slow your speech slightly and listen carefully to 
certain consonants (for example, the t, s, and d sounds). Proper enunciation can 
help you set a comfortable pace and keep you from rushing through your presen-
tation. In fact, it isn’t a bad idea to over-enunciate. In the excitement of recording, 
over-enunciation forces you to slow down, clean up your pronunciation, and make 
your voice easily understandable. That same excitement is likely to increase your 
pace of speaking. Again, if the rapid pace is part of your presentation, stick with 
it, but if you’re doing anything like a narration for an audio book, slow down. If 
you think you’re speaking just a little too slowly, you’re probably going just the 
right speed.
Speaking a few tongue-twisters before going on mic helps your enunciation and 
warms up your voice and prepares it for the podcast you’re about to record. Here 
are some easy ones that emphasize the problem consonants lost when speaking 
too quickly:
»
» Toot the tin trumpet, Tommy, in time.
»
» Pop prickly pickles past the peck of parsley.
»
» See sand slip silently through the sunlit seals.
»
» The sixth sheik’s sheep is sick.
»
» Will Wendy remember wrecking the white rocker?
If you perform a search online for tongue twisters, you can find a wide variety of 
classic and original warm-ups for the voice. You can also take the twisters you 
find and compose your own.

140      PART 2  The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
And now let’s take a break for  
station identification
Ever notice that certain podcasts suddenly break in with a show ID or take some 
other marked break and then (if they’re lucky enough to have sponsors) play their 
sponsors’ spots? They’re trying to emulate — and maybe make themselves easily 
syndicated by  — conventional radio. You know  — the broadcasting industry. 
Clock management is the careful, standardized interruption of a typical radio 
broadcast — usually every 15 minutes in a one-hour slot — for such necessities 
as station identification, show identification, public-service announcements 
(PSAs), and (of course) commercials.
Another nice bonus of following clock management is you have several points in 
your show to give a quick show ID (something like “You’re listening to Technorama 
with Chuck and Kreg . . .”) that lets people know who you are. This show ID is 
great to catch the attention of people who may be walking into the middle of your 
podcast, and just as they ask the podcast listener “What are you listening to?” the 
show ID drops. Although show IDs are usually expected at the top of the hour and 
on the half-hour, you can drop in a show ID anytime you feel like it.
A good rule of thumb for clock management for each hour is:
»
» :00 — Programming break, station identification, show ID, PSAs, 
advertisements
»
» :15 — Programming break, PSAs, advertisements
»
» :30 — Programming break, station identification, show ID, PSAs, 
advertisements
»
» :45 — Programming break, PSAs, advertisements
These breaks vary in length but can last anywhere from two minutes to five min-
utes. No surprise that this is where hardcore podcasters (anyone podcasting since 
before early 2005) get a bit restless. They find clock management and show ID 
redundant, if not frivolous. Why bother to break or even drop in a show ID? People 
have downloaded your feed specifically. They know what they’re listening to, so 
what purpose does clock management serve?
It all comes back to what you see for your podcast’s future. If you intend to remain 
in the podosphere (the community of podcasters and loyal listeners, a podcast ver-
sion of the blogosphere), it really comes down to your format, your way. No con-
straints from the FCC. It’s just you, the microphone, your listeners, and caution to 
the wind. However, if you set your sights for taking your passion project to the 
airwaves — be it AM, FM, or satellite radio — you must format your show to fit 
the standards.

CHAPTER 7  So What Are You Waiting For? Record, Already!      141
Think about the possibilities of your podcast and where you see yourself with it 
several months (or years) down the road. Maybe a bit of management and organi-
zation will aid your podcast in jumping to the airwaves.
Concerning Tangents and Their  
Val — Oh, Look, a Butterfly!
It’s hardly surprising that broadcasters who have no experience in broadcasting 
tend to stray from their topic once the microphone goes hot, and then they lose 
themselves in the thickets and thorns of tangents. Defensive podcasters claim 
that’s part of the charm of podcasting, but that charm fades as the topic gets 
closer to serious. If (for example) you launch a podcast intent on addressing the 
growing concern of television violence and wander into Sherlock trivia, don’t be 
surprised if your audience wanders away.
It’s worth repeating: Stay focused on the intent of your podcast. Remaining true 
to your podcast’s subject matter isn’t just about staying within your running time; 
it also makes clear to your listeners that, yes, you have a message and you will 
deliver it. You haven’t promised something substantial only to let your mind and 
commentary wander aimlessly. When people listen, you want them to feel assured 
that what they will hear is exactly what you’ve offered.
Read on to find out how you can make tangents work and how to smoothly get 
back on topic after you’ve taken your side trip.
PODCASTING GOES PRO
Broadcasting networks that present to the airwaves sensational commentators like 
Sean Hannity, Anderson Cooper, Bill Maher, and Rush (no, not the kickin’ rock group 
from Canada, but the big man of the Right Wing, Rush Limbaugh . . .) often take their 
shows to the podosphere to market their shows and reach a worldwide audience.
Along with the talk-radio personalities, other major players in broadcasting like NPR, 
ESPN, Disney, the BBC, and ABC use podcasting to reach audiences that may have 
missed their original broadcasts. One of Chuck’s favorites is a show from “the other 
ABC,” the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, called Dr. Karl on TripleJ, while Tee enjoys 
NPR’s Note to Self and PBS’ Masterpiece Studio, both of which were recommended to him 
by Stitcher. Thanks to podcasting, all of us can learn more about bee stings, double 
­rainbows, and tidal waves on our own schedules.

142      PART 2  The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
“Say, that reminds me of something . . .”
Tangents can also be creative opportunities. You don’t necessarily treat tangents 
as strictly verboten in podcasting. If your tangent is directly related to, or benefits 
your topic, it can be effective and engaging.
Say your commentary begins with “Anyone notice how smartphones are no longer 
just phones but tiny PDAs that can be easily monitored and hacked into?” You 
cover that for a bit, and then break off on a tangent about phone etiquette and the 
lack of manners it brings out of people. This is a tangent that will keep your listen-
ers engaged — and that can count as much as staying on topic.
What if your podcast isn’t so structured, though? There’s nothing wrong with hit-
ting Record and forging ahead into the great unknown of the next 15 or 20 min-
utes, so long as you have an idea of where you want to go. Tangents are terrific in 
moderation, but put some reins on ’em and keep them at least (well, yeah) tangen-
tially related to the subject matter of your podcast. If, say, your podcast is about 
movies but your review of Doctor Strange suddenly goes into the decline of the 
comic book industry (regardless of the onslaught of comic-books-to-film produc-
tions), then you still have a sense of focus. However, if your review of Doctor Strange 
wanders off into how your cat is throwing up hairballs every time you podcast or 
that your car’s sunroof chose to stop working, blah, blah, blah, what the heck is 
going on here? Your audience may grow frustrated enough to stop listening.
“But getting back to what I was  
saying earlier . . .”
When you’re podcasting for 15 or 20 minutes (or longer . . .), it’s okay to take the 
scenic route with your discussion, but make sure that you return to the point you 
wanted to make in this (weekly, biweekly, or monthly) installment. The listener’s 
delight in podcasts is often the revelation that individuals who (in many cases) 
have never set foot in a recording studio can produce entertaining, and even infor-
mative, shows. Sometimes meandering back to the point is part of that delight.
For instance, a podcast might begin with something read in the headlines — say, 
a new marketing strategy launched by Apple for the iPhone to reach a wider client 
base. This can lead to a variety of topics in the discussion, such as the following:
»
» Smartphones that begin extending into other functionality like playing games 
on the PlayStation Network or providing Wi-Fi hotspots
»
» Costs for iPhone services from AT&T and other carriers
»
» Ways that carriers could bring down the costs of services
»
» Continued shortcomings and disappointments from the smartphone industry

CHAPTER 7  So What Are You Waiting For? Record, Already!      143
But in the last five to ten minutes, a simple segue like “So, to recap our thoughts 
on this bold marketing strategy from Apple. . .” can successfully steer you, or you 
and your co-hosts, back to the aim and intent of your podcast. If you return delib-
erately from a tangent, your listeners arrive back at the point and know the des-
tination as well as the scenery they went through to get there.
THE NAME SAYS IT ALL
Unless you are already an established brand like Bill O’Reilly or Ricky Gervais, your show 
name is your calling card. For example, Astronomy Cast (http://astronomycast.
com) — the name tells you right away what the show covers: galaxies, stars, gravity, 
­continental drift, and extra-solar planets. Once you have a topic for your show, it’s 
extremely beneficial that the name conveys the detail the show goes into. That way, 
when someone asks you “So what’s your podcast about?” and you respond with “Bite 
Me!” they will understand it wasn’t an insult as you explain “It’s a podcast about canines 
with temperament issues.”
But give your show’s description a few seconds. Just in case you want to mess with 
them.

144      PART 2  The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
Get your listeners there and back again. Not only will they appreciate it, but they’ll 
tell others about your podcast, and your subscribers will grow in numbers.
We hit on the topic of using a script versus an outline in Chapter 5. When it comes 
to staying on track, clearly, a script has a distinct advantage over an outline. 
Regarding interviews (see Chapter 6), having a list of questions is important, but 
don’t be afraid to ask impromptu questions — you can always go back to your 
prepared list.
Recording!
Whew — there certainly is a lot to think about before you get started. That’s what 
makes a great podcast — someone did some planning. Now it’s time to put that 
planning and practicing into action.
Getting started with GarageBand
When you first start GarageBand, you’re presented with an array of choices. How 
you answer this first question has ramifications on what you can — and in some 
cases cannot — do in GarageBand: Should you create a new Voice project or a new 
Empty Project? What’s the difference?
The Voice Project is a project already populated with audio tracks that give you a 
variety of vocal effects, some practical if you are doing dramatic presentations; or 
comical effects for the fun of it. You can choose to utilize any of these effects, and 
edit them using the GarageBand interface to cater to your needs. The Empty Proj-
ect is a clean slate in GarageBand. No filters. No effects. Just an empty project.
For simplicity’s sake, choose to create an Empty Project and in the following win-
dow select your microphone or audio interface. We also recommend changing a 
few settings that work better for music composition than they do for podcast 
recording:
»
» Turn off the Count-In feature. The Count-In sets a tempo and is most often 
used when recording music, but as you will probably not be concerned with a 
set tempo, you probably don’t need this feature. Turning off the Count-In 
feature should also turn off the metronome. If you don’t turn it off, you’ll hear 
a click-click-click while you’re speaking — annoying to say the least.

»
» Hide the Library. By default, a window will be made available on the left-
hand side called the Library. The Library is a collection of effects for different 
kinds of recording. To hide the Library, click the Library icon, located in the 
top-left corner of the application window.
»
» Show Time in the LCD. In the top of the GarageBand window is a display. By 
default, the LCD shows Beats & Measures. For your podcast, time is more 
appropriate so switch it by clicking on the music note/metronome icon. You 
will get a drop-down menu that offers the Time option. Select that and your 
LCD now measures in time.
Now you have a clean slate to start with. There’s just one more thing to check 
before you throw the switch, and that’s to confirm GarageBand knows where to 
get input from. Choose GarageBand ➪   Preferences and click Audio/Midi at the top 
of the window that pops up. Check to make sure your Audio Input is selected cor-
rectly. The setting varies depending on your actual input (USB microphone, mixer, 
preamp, and so on). After that’s taken care of, close the window.
Return to your project window and click the big red Record button located at the 
top of the screen, and begin speaking. When you’re ready to stop, click the Stop 
button or the spacebar. Note, clicking the Record button again stops recording, but 
GarageBand continues playing.
Congratulations, you’ve made your first recording in GarageBand!
Getting started with Audacity
Audacity was meant to be simple. To record a podcast in Audacity, follow these 
simple steps:
1.	 Set your input.
At the top of the screen you can find a drop-down list with several choices — 
Line In, Microphone, and so on. Your settings depend on your system setup. 
Audacity is pretty good at detecting what inputs it can use on your system. Go 
ahead and pick the proper one. Just make sure that your microphone is 
plugged in before launching Audacity: Otherwise, it won’t know your mic exists.
2.	 Click the Record button.
Audacity creates a new track and begins recording. As you speak your words of 
wisdom to the world, you should see the meters moving and the waveform 
being created.

146      PART 2  The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
Audacity comes with a terrific function called Noise Reduction which digitally 
attempts to identify the offending noise and “remove” it from the recording. 
To do this effectively and efficiently, though, Audacity needs to have a clean 
sample of the room’s natural audio, called an audio floor or noise floor in 
professional settings. Record, either at the beginning or at the end of your 
recording, 5-10 seconds of the space you are recording in. Just leave the mics 
open but say nothing for a chunk of time, and that is the sample of your room 
noise. That will be your sample to use when, after you record and are working 
with the audio in post, Audacity’s Noise Reduction asks for a sample of the 
background noise you want to eliminate.
3.	 Click the Stop button.
When you’re done, just click Stop.
Congratulations, you’ve made your first recording using Audacity. Now you know 
why so many podcasters love it!

lthough a high-tech activity like podcasting doesn’t exactly qualify as 
quaint, the charm of podcasting is — whether produced by a major studio 
or by friends with a microphone and a laptop — its inherent, homespun 
quality. Steve Jobs once described it as the Wayne’s World of radio. (No kidding, he 
said that in 2005 at http://bit.ly/jobs-podcasting on ABC.) Podcasts, much 
like Saturday Night Live’s classic sketch depicted, are often done on a shoestring 
budget and recorded in one take, with no editing. All the trip-ups and tangents are 
captured for posterity and sent to MP3 players everywhere. This is part of the 
grassroots appeal that podcasting is not only known for, but prides itself on 
­nurturing as new and innovative podcasters enter the podosphere.
Although podcasting purists may harbor animosity toward the editing process, 
sometimes it makes all the difference between a listenable podcast and an inco-
herent mess of senseless rambling. For example, you might want to eliminate the 
sound of a train going by or silence a cough that would otherwise distract your 
listeners from a brilliant riposte. This chapter shows you how to use editing to 
shape your podcast while retaining its natural atmosphere, adding depth to that 
atmosphere with music, and then give the final touch to your podcast’s format 
with an introduction and exit.

A Few Reasons to Consider Editing
Take a serious look at the mood you want to convey with your podcast. From 
there, you can judge how intense your editing workload will be. The following 
explains some instances where editing is needed — and (trust us) your podcast 
will benefit from it:
»
» Professional production quality: You can’t always get everything right on 
the first take — and sometimes not even on the second or third. Editing 
makes it sound like you got even hard-to-pronounce names and tricky tongue 
twisters right on the first try. What’s more, you can drop in preproduced 
clips with just the right amount of space before and after to give it that 
polished feel.
»
» Removing boring material: You’ve probably watched a live show or listened 
to live audio that doesn’t go quite where it is intended. The content gets dull 
and uninteresting. As a listener, you can fast forward, change the channel, or 
just turn it off. As a podcaster, you can avoid this situation with editing. But 
even though it sounds easy to take out the boring bits, be careful that you 
maintain continuity. If edited improperly, the listeners may find themselves 
confused because the line of questions changed from space travel to herbs 
and spices in the matter of a few seconds.
»
» Ambient noise: As explained in Chapter 7, ambient noise is the natural and 
spontaneously occurring noise you may pick up when recording your podcast. 
If you’re conducting an in-studio interview and suddenly a passing siren or the 
rumble of a garbage truck makes it into your recording, the noise can disrupt 
the momentum of the interview and distract the audience. In fiction podcasts, 
such as The Raven & The Writing Desk (http://metamorcity.com) hosted by 
author Chris Lester, moods and atmospheres must be maintained. For Chris, 
however, both apply as he breaks up his fiction with interviews. Therefore, 
control and minimization of ambient noise is a must.
»
» Running times: You just wrapped your latest podcast with a great interview, 
and you’re confident that you have plenty of material for your 30-minute 
podcast. And then you check again and realize that you have recorded over 
90 minutes’ worth of interview. And you love all of it! Now here’s where editing 
works in your favor. Your listeners expect 30 minutes, give or take a segment 
or two, from your podcast. You could run the whole thing, unedited, but that 
might test the patience of your audience members (not to mention your own 
bandwidth and file storage). Or you could split it up into two 45-minute 
interviews — or even three 30-minute interviews — breaking up the airplay of 

CHAPTER 8  Cleanup, Podcast Aisle 7!      149
the interviews with two smaller podcasts in-between the segments. In this 
approach to editing, everyone wins.
Editing can easily increase your productivity with podcasts. True, some 
podcasters define editing as cutting and deleting material, but there’s more 
to it. Editing can help you rescue discussions and content that would other-
wise be hard to shoehorn into one podcast.
»
» Scripted material: Some podcasters argue that the true podcast is done in 
one take, but as podcasting matures as a medium, audiences grow more and 
more demanding. Expectations for a podcast change when your podcast 
includes scripted material. Editing is a necessity in these situations. With 
dramatic readings and productions, moments of “ah” and “um” should be 
edited out to maintain the clarity of the story, as well as maintain the mood or 
atmosphere established in your reading.
With the popularity of storytelling in the podosphere, professionalism and 
performance are the keys to a good product — and usually that means (yep!) 
editing. Lots of it. If you feel that editing would mar the spontaneity of your 
podcast — but still want to present literature or other scripted material — ask 
yourself how good you think The Lord of the Rings would have been if Sir Ian 
McKellen and Viggo Mortensen did everything in one take. Imagine their 
dialogue sounding like this:
Gandalf: Frodo . . . he, uuummm, grows closer to, you know, the end. 
I wonder if, um, he’s, ahh . . . alive.
Aragorn: Ummm . . . what *sneezes suddenly — sniffle sniffle* . . . what does 
your heart *ahem* tell you?
Not what we would call riveting drama. With scripted material, editing is a must.
The Art of Editing
Editing out breaks, stammers, and trip-ups may sound easy, but there’s a science 
to it. If you cut off too much from a clip, one word comes right on top of another, 
and you sound unnatural. If you don’t cut off enough, pauses last too long between 
thoughts.
When you’re editing audio, the key is to review, review, review.

150      PART 2  The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
A lot of audio applications are out there, each with its own way to edit stumbles, 
bumbles, and moments of silence to honor a lost thought. The same principles 
apply to all those applications:
1.	 Find the unwanted content.
2.	 Give your clip a little bit — perhaps a half a second — of silence as leader or 
play area between edits.
3.	 Review the edit, making sure it sounds smooth and natural; an effective edit 
doesn’t sound like an edit.
But instead of talking about it, how about you do it? In the following sections, we 
go into basic editing using GarageBand (www.apple.com/mac/garageband) and 
Audacity (www.audacity.audio) as examples. These are two very common audio-
editing software packages in podcasting, and both serve as our benchmarks for 
how to create podcasts. If you’re using some other audio-editing software pack-
age, the steps are similar enough for you to apply to your own project.
Editing with GarageBand
You can use GarageBand to edit awkward gaps of silence or eliminate coughs and 
stammers from your podcast. We assume at this point you just finished recording 
or opened a GarageBand file with a recorded track already done (see Chapter 7 
for instructions on recording with GarageBand). You can also import audio files 
(­perhaps recorded on a portable device) by dragging them from the Finder into 
GarageBand.
To prepare for editing the silences and splutters, split your audio into smaller 
­segments to isolate the audio that you want to remove. Then follow these steps:
1.	 Determine where in the track you want to make the edit by clicking and 
dragging the playhead to the beginning point of your edit.
Use the Time Display readout to see exactly how long the gap of silence runs. 
The playhead tool is the triangle connected to a vertical line. (See Figure 8-1 for 
details.) When creating segments, you want to place this line at the beginning 
and ending points of your edit.
Silence is easy to see when you’re looking at a waveform of the audio. Coughs 
or other noise can be a little trickier to isolate. We suggest watching the 
waveform while you listen to the audio at the same time. You may want to 
use the slider in the bottom left to increase your time scale resolution and 
make it easier to work with smaller bits of information.
2.	 Choose Edit ➪   Split Regions at Playhead to make the first cut.
Figure 8-1 shows the first cut.

CHAPTER 8  Cleanup, Podcast Aisle 7!      151
3.	 Move your playhead to the location where you want the edit to end. Then 
choose Edit ➪   Split Regions at Playhead to make your next cut.
As you edit, give yourself a second or two of silent play area at the beginning 
and end of your edits. It makes the editing of two segments sound like one 
continuous segment, and they’ll be a little easier to mix together.
4.	 Single-click the segment between your two cuts and then press the 
Delete key.
If you’re working with GarageBand for the first time, note that the first track of 
audio is selected by default. To deselect the segment you’re editing, single-click 
anywhere in the gray area underneath the track(s) you’re working on.
5.	 To join the two remaining audio segments, click and drag the right 
segment over the left segment, overlapping the two (as shown in 
Figure 8-2).
If the selected segment overlaps any part of the unselected segment, it takes 
priority over the unselected segment, effectively erasing any content there.
You can combine the step of deleting a segment and closing the gap (delete 
and move) by using the GarageBand key sequence Ctrl+Backspace.
6.	 Click and drag the playhead to any point before the edit and click the 
Play button to review.
7.	 If the edit doesn’t sound natural, undo the changes (by choosing 
Edit ➪   Undo Drag) and try again.
Because you’re allowed multiple undos in GarageBand, you can step back in 
your project to begin at the first Split command.
FIGURE 8-1: 
Click and drag the 
playhead to the 
beginning point 
of your edit. The

of where you are 
in the project’s 
duration.

152      PART 2  The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
As much as we would love to cover all the neat doodads in GarageBand — and 
there are a lot of them — we need to stick to the essentials you need to get started 
podcasting. For more in-depth information on mastering GarageBand, there are 
plenty of other resources available, including Apple’s own Support site at https://
support.apple.com/garageband.
Editing with Audacity
At this point, we assume you’ve just finished recording something awesome with 
Audacity (see Chapter  7 for instructions), or perhaps you’ve opened a saved 
­project. If you have an audio file from another source, such as a portable recorder, 
you can import it using File ➪   Import. Now you’re ready to follow these steps to 
make a basic edit:
1.	 Find the segment that you want to edit.
To view the entire timeline of your project, click the Fit Project in Window tool, 
shown here in the margin.
You can easily navigate between the segments of your timelines selected and 
the project timeline with the Fit Project in Window and Fit Selection in Window 
tools, located in the top-right section of the project window.
2.	 Click the Selection tool — in the upper left (Mac) and upper center 
(Windows) — and then click and drag across the unwanted segment.
The unwanted segment is highlighted, as shown in Figure 8-3.
FIGURE 8-2: 
To shorten the 
silence, move one 
edit over another.

CHAPTER 8  Cleanup, Podcast Aisle 7!      153
Right about here would be a good opportunity to use the Fit Selection in 
Window tool to double-check that the selection border doesn’t go into the 
recorded content you want to keep.
3.	 Single-click the segment between your two cuts and then press the 
Delete key (Mac) or the Backspace key (Windows).
You can also choose Edit ➪   Cut or press ⌘  +X (Mac)/Ctrl+X (Windows) to 
remove the unwanted segment.
Do not use the Trim command. (HERE’S THE COMMAND NOT TO USE: Edit ➪   Trim 
or ⌘  +T for Mac/Ctrl+T for Windows.) You may think you are trimming away 
unwanted content, but this command works differently from the ⌘  +T command 
in GarageBand: Just like when you crop an image, it trims off unselected  
material — leaving you with only the content you wanted to edit out. Ack!
4.	 Review the clip.
5.	 If the edit doesn’t sound natural to you, undo the changes by choosing 
Edit ➪   Undo Change of Position Region or pressing ⌘  +Z (Mac) or Ctrl+Z 
(Windows), and try again.
You’re allowed multiple undos in Audacity, giving you the advantage to go back 
to the beginning point of your editing just in case you aren’t happy with the 
sound of the edit.

tool, click and

Making Your Musical Bed and Lying in It: 
Background Music
On listening to podcasts of people in interview situations or in round-table discus­
sions, there can be a strange sense of isolation, especially if the conversation hits 
a pocket of dead air (when conversation or the signal stops), and only silence is 
recorded or broadcast.
A few podcasters like to add a little bit of atmosphere in their individual podcast 
with bed music — a background soundtrack that’s usually two to three minutes 
long and is looped so it can play again and again throughout the podcast, if desired. 
Sometimes the bed music lasts only a minute or two into the podcast when the 
hosts return from the break, whereas other shows keep it going from beginning to 
end, fading it out if they’re bringing in any other sources of audio (voice mail, 
other podcast promos, ads, and so on).
Regardless of how long the loop is, you must obtain permission from the artists 
to use their music and give them audible credit — either at the beginning or end 
of your podcast. If you’re using shareware music, such as from PodShow 
(http://podshow.com), giving audible credit is one of the conditions you must 
agree to. Other options include using music loops found in GarageBand, Audition, 
or Logic Pro.
Finding the right balance
As you add music as a background bed, incorporate sound effects, and bring in 
prerecorded audio from other sources (such as H4n Pro recordings or a Skype 
call), the sound of your podcast gets more complex. Balance becomes not only 
harder, but even more essential. (Note, for example, the various volume levels of 
the multiple tracks in Figure 8-4.)
HATE EDITING? GET REAL . . .
Are there exceptions to the rule? Absolutely! Yes, a performance is at its best when your 
actors are stammer-free, but back in 1938 there was a radio drama that was chock-full 
of trip-ups, stutters, and stammers. With all this going against its production, the 
Mercury Theatre terrified a nation with its adaptation of H.G. Wells’ War of the Worlds, 
arguably the first reality-based entertainment (well, a realistic simulation of reality, 
anyway) unleashed on America, the ubiquitous mistakes intensified the illusion of real-
ity. If your podcast is primarily entertainment anchored, you can probably avoid the 
arduous editing process. Again, it depends on the content you’re podcasting.

CHAPTER 8  Cleanup, Podcast Aisle 7!      155
Bed music should add atmosphere to your podcast. That means finding a proper 
balance between the talking of the hosts and the soundtrack. The following 
­sections explain why you want to avoid music that’s too soft or too loud.
What is that noise?
If your music is too soft, your looped music could be mistaken as unwanted ambi-
ent noise of someone listening to music in the next room. Or it could be regarded 
as technical difficulty such as a stray signal bleeding (another wireless audio signal 
accidentally being picked up by the same frequency as your own wireless audio 
device) into the podcaster’s wireless microphone. Music too indistinct to hear  
can be a distraction, particularly in quiet moments or pauses in the conversation. 
Your audience might end up hammering out email after email (asking what’s 
making that annoying noise) or trying to figure out what that faint music in the 
­background is.
Could you speak up? I can’t hear  
you for the music . . .
When bed music is too loud, your voice is lost in the melody. Music, especially 
classical music and selections that rise and fall in intensity (like any good Queen 
album) can be tricky to mix into a conversation.
You do want to allow your audience to hear the music in the background, but the 
music, if you’re using it as background music, probably isn’t the point of the 
­podcast. It shouldn’t be so loud that you have to pump up your own voice track to 
be heard.
FIGURE 8-4: 
Adding multiple 
tracks is easy. 
Balancing 
them can be 
challenging.

156      PART 2  The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
Never sacrifice audio clarity so bed music can be heard and identified clearly. If 
you want to showcase music, then showcase music properly. Otherwise, your bed 
music should remain in the background as a setting, not in the forefront of your 
podcast.
Applying bed music the right way
When you’re setting audio levels, you want to find the best blend of music and 
voice, assuring one doesn’t overpower the other. Both tracks should work together 
and not struggle for dominance.
Always listen to the podcast in headphones and your computer speakers before 
uploading to the Internet — review, review, review, and find that balance.
To avoid music that’s either too soft or too loud, keep the following points in mind 
as you apply the bed music:
»
» Experiment with levels for the music before you record voice. Watch your 
decibel level meter and set your music between –11 and –16 dB, depending 
on the music or sound effects you’re using.
»
» When you’re comfortable with the bed’s level, lay down a voice track and 
see how your project’s overall levels look (as well as sound) on your 
decibel level meter. Remember, your aim is to keep your voice in the 0 or 
red area without overmodulating. With the music bed now behind your voice, 
it’s much easier to hit the red without effort.
»
» Avoid uneven music, or music that suddenly dips low and then has 
moments of sudden intensity. The best music-bed-friendly loops have an 
even sound (whether driving and dramatic or laid-back and relaxed) and an 
even level.
»
» Experiment with putting your music at the beginning and at the end of 
your podcast instead of throughout. In these cases, music beds announce 
upcoming breaks and pauses in your podcast.
Setting volume levels for bed music
Each audio application has its own way to change volume dynamically — but the 
basic process is the same. In the sections that follow, you find out how to use 
GarageBand and Audacity to bring music into your podcast at full volume, and 
then balance it to be just audible enough in the background.

CHAPTER 8  Cleanup, Podcast Aisle 7!      157
Setting volume levels manually with GarageBand
Follow these steps to set volume levels with GarageBand:
1.	 Click the track that your voice resides on.
All segments in this track only are selected.
2.	 Click and drag the playhead to anywhere between five and ten seconds 
into the project.
If you look at the Time Display in GarageBand and see a music note in the left 
corner, single-click it. Doing so accesses the drop-down menu where you can 
select the Time mode.
3.	 Click and drag the beginning of your vocal track (your voice) to the 
playhead.
You now have ten seconds of lead time between the beginning of the timeline 
and your podcast.
4.	 In the Finder, open a window and find the music file you want to use as 
your bed music. Click and drag the file into GarageBand, just underneath 
your podcast track, as shown in Figure 8-5. Once the new audio is in place, 
select the Show/Hide Automation tool (circled in Figure 8-5) to set levels.
FIGURE 8-5: 
A simple

but also adds a

podcast.

158      PART 2  The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
When using sound effects or bed music, try to use AIFF or WAV files. An MP3 
file is a compressed file. Compressed files (film, photo, audio, whatever) are 
usually far from ideal for editing because there’s loss with every compression 
cycle — you lose a bit of quality. If you have audio bits you want to export for 
editing, perhaps in another program, we recommend exporting them in a raw 
format such as AIFF or WAV so you don’t lose any quality.
5.	 Select the new track of audio you just created, then single-click the 
Show/Hide Automation tool located above and to the right of the tracks 
as shown in Figure 8-5.
You should see a thin line against your audio tracks. If your audio track is set 
on the Volume option, the line is your track volume control. If your playhead 
isn’t at the ten-second mark, be sure to put it there.
6.	 Click at the point where the playhead line and the volume control line 
intersect.
You have now created a control point — a place you can click and drag to 
change volume levels at various times. (See Figure 8-6.)
7.	 Move your playhead back two seconds to the eight-second mark. At the 
eight-second mark, click the volume control to create another control 
point.
8.	 Return to the first control point you created (in Step 6). Click, hold, and 
drag the control point halfway between the bottom of the track-volume 
partition and its current level.
You have just created a volume curve. Now the sound dips lower, allowing for a 
voiceover to be heard with music softly playing in the background.
FIGURE 8-6: 
Creating a 
volume curve for 
a fade-down 
requires two 
control points 
and gives you 
dynamic control 
over the track’s 
output.

CHAPTER 8  Cleanup, Podcast Aisle 7!      159
9.	Move your playhead back to the ten-second mark, as shown in Figure 8-6.
Doing so completes your fade-down (the automatic fading of the music to a 
subdued volume behind the voiceover).
10.	Select the podcast track and click and drag your podcast segments to 
where the content begins at the ten-second mark.
You now have a bed of music behind your podcast.
11.	Bring the playhead back to the beginning and review your podcast. Change 
the levels accordingly to set the music at a level you think works best.
Keeping volume levels in GarageBand after edits
While adding in bed music, sound effects, or additional audio, you might need to 
make a change — add or delete another edit. Does this mean you go on and manu-
ally adjust your various levels? Not if you activate Move Track Automations with 
Regions, located under the Mix menu. This will keep your work up to that point 
intact while the new audio is positioned in place.
Follow these steps to have GarageBand automatically keep the volume levels in 
your podcast intact when last-minute audio changes occur:
1.	 Find a section in your audio project where you need to add in a segment 
of audio.
Make sure you have levels set in your audio, as shown in Figure 8-7. You will be 
creating a gap where audio is needed. Make sure you are viewing your Volume 
Levels, made available by clicking your Show/Hide Automation feature.
2.	 Choose Mix ➪   Move Track Automations with Regions from the menu.
3.	 Select segments you want to move to make room for the new audio, then 
move the selected audio to the right between five and ten seconds.
The changes you made to the volume levels follow the changes of the audio on 
the project timeline, also shown in Figure 8-7.
Setting volume levels with Audacity
If you’re using Audacity, you can set volume levels by following these steps:
1.	 Click the Selection tool to activate it and then click at the ten-second 
mark of your timeline, placing an edit line there.
2.	 Click the Time Shift Tool button on the toolbar, shown in the margin.
The Time Shift tool takes an entire track of content and places it elsewhere 
along the project’s timeline.

160      PART 2  The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
3.	 Click and drag your audio to the edit line you created in Step 1.
4.	 Choose File ➪   Import ➪   Audio and browse for the music file that you want 
to use as bed music. Then select the file and click Open to begin the 
import process.
Although you can import MP3 files directly into Audacity when you’re editing — 
be it film, photo, or audio — you shouldn’t be working with compressed files. 
(It’s just too easy to lose a bit too much quality along the way.) You can use 
them in Audacity, but do so at your own risk.
5.	 Click the Envelope Tool button on the toolbar.
The Envelope Tool allows you to dynamically control the audio levels over a 
timeline. Clicking at the beginning of the audio track establishes the first 
volume setting, and the second click (at the ten-second mark) establishes the 
new volume level.
6.	 Select the track of recently imported music by clicking its name on the 
left side of the project window.
7.	 Click at the beginning of the music and then click at the point where your 
podcast begins (the ten-second mark).
Two sets of points appear in your track of music.
FIGURE 8-7: 
By activating 
Move Track 
Automations with 
Regions, your 
audio levels 
remain intact 
when major 
changes occur in 
your Timeline.

CHAPTER 8  Cleanup, Podcast Aisle 7!      161
8.	 Click and drag the second set of points to the 0.5 dB mark.
You now have a fade-down of the music that maintains its subdued volume 
behind the voiceover.
9.	 Activate the Selection tool, click at the beginning of the timeline, and 
then click Play to review your podcast.
Now you can change the levels as needed to set the music at a level you think 
works best.
Making an Entrance: Intros
Now that your podcast has a solid lead-in and a cue to fade out — or you have a 
loop throughout your podcast that sets a tone — your podcast is beginning to 
solidify. It’s establishing an identity for itself; be proud of the way this podcast of 
yours is maturing.
But when the microphone comes on, do you always know what those first words 
are going to be? For some listeners, you’re about to make a first impression. What 
do you want that first impression to be? Are you looking for something spontane-
ous every time, or do you want to create a familiar greeting that makes listeners 
feel like old friends? Your chance to make a first impression with your listeners is 
with an intro, which is the first thing the listener hears, be it with a bit of theme 
music or a word or two about you and your show.
It’s up to you, but think about how strong a first impression and a cool intro can 
make. Consider the ten simple words that became the signature introductions for 
George Lucas’s Star Wars saga:
A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away . . .
This intro leaves an unforgettable first impression. But even if you’re not vying to 
be the next George Lucas, the first impression is always important. No matter who 
you are, this is a moment that can either establish you as a personality (and a 
podcast) that people will enjoy and eagerly await from episode to episode, or it 
will make winning over audiences a little harder. You want the first impression to 
be fascinating, lasting . . . and positive.
Consistent, iconic intros can serve as a polished touch of preparation or a subtle 
flair of professionalism. You’re announcing to your audience that the show is on 
the launchpad, you’re ready, and the journey is about to begin.

Theme music
How about a catchy theme? Just as television and motion picture themes establish 
a thumbprint for themselves in pop culture, an opening theme — be it a favorite 
song (used with permission!) or an original composition — can be just the right 
intro for your podcast. Perhaps you have a friend in the wide world of podcasting 
who can assist with audio production. Ask — you might be surprised how willing 
other podcasters are to assist. Earlier-mentioned software applications such as 
GarageBand, SONAR, Logic Pro, and Audition all offer royalty-free loops that can 
be easily edited into your own podcast intro. Other great free music sources include 
Kevin MacLeod’s site, Incompetech (https://incompetech.com/music), and the 
YouTube 
Audio 
Library 
(https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music), 
which also includes sound effects. If you have a little cash in the coffers, check out 
memberships with Digital Juice (www.digitaljuice.com) for an astounding 
­collection of royalty-free jingles and sound effects.
Royalty free means you’re free to use the audio clip over and over without paying 
a license fee. You may still need to purchase the audio clips such as Digital Juice. 
In the case of GarageBand, the loops and clips are included in the price of the 
package with additional add-on libraries, available in the App Store.
Intro greeting
Some podcasters use quick, snappy intro greetings for their podcasts. For exam-
ple, Adam Christianson opens every show with a heavy rock riff and the salutation 
“Hey, Mac Geeks, it’s time for The MacCast, the show for Mac Geeks by Mac 
Geeks  .  .  .” that kicks off his podcast, The MacCast (www.maccast.com). Others 
­create an imaginative setting; for Tales from the Archives (http://ministry 
ofpeculiaroccurrences.com), the producers have a more complex intro with 
music, sound effects, and original dialogue. Whether elaborately produced or just 
a simple welcome, a consistent greeting serves to bring listeners into your corner 
of the podosphere.
The elements you’re looking for in a spoken introduction are
»
» The show’s name
»
» The name(s) of the host(s)
»
» Location of the podcast
»
» A tagline that identifies your show

CHAPTER 8  Cleanup, Podcast Aisle 7!      163
Sit down and brainstorm a few ideas on how to introduce your podcast. For exam-
ple, try these approaches on for size:
»
» “Good morning, Planet Earth! You’re listening to My Corner: A Slice of 
Cyberspace, and I’m your host, Tee Morris.”
»
» “From Washington, D.C., welcome to My Corner: A Slice of Cyberspace.”
»
» “With a perspective on politics, technology, and life in general, it’s Tee Morris 
with the My Corner podcast.”
As you see in these examples, you can mix and match the elements to drop into an 
intro. Come up with what feels right for you and your podcast, and stick with it. 
After you’ve put together your greeting, you can either keep it prerecorded and 
use it as a drop-in (an isolated audio clip that you can use repeatedly, either from 
podcast to podcast, or within a podcast) at the introduction of your podcast, or you 
can script it and record it with each session. Whatever method you choose, a 
greeting is another way of bringing your audience into your 20 to 30 minutes (or 
5 minutes to an hour and a half) of time on their preferred media player.
Exit, Stage Left: Outros
Now that you have reached the end of your message or the time limit you have set 
yourself for a podcast, what do you do? Do you just say “Thanks, everyone, see you 
next time . . .” or just a basic “Bye,” and then it’s over? Or do you want to go out 
with a bit of fanfare? Whatever you decide, an outro is much like an intro — as 
simple or elaborate as you want to make it. Your outro is your final word, closing 
statement, and grand finale (at least for this episode).
In practical terms, putting together an outro is no different from putting together 
an intro — same approach, only you’re doing it at the end. So review the earlier 
suggestions for intros and consider what seems a likely direction for an outro.
Some podcasters figure there’s little more to think about for an outro than what 
to say and how to present it. Sure, you could keep it simple — say “Until next 
time,” and switch off, no fuss, no script, just do it, done, and then upload. But 
other podcasters see the outro as more of an art form. Before taking a shortcut to 
the end, check out the following sections for some ways to spiff up your outro.
Leave the audience wanting more
Continuing your podcast to its final moments is a gutsy, confident, and exciting 
outro, carrying your audience all the way to the final second. This is one of the 

164      PART 2  The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
toughest ways to end a podcast, but if it’s done right, it can only make your 
­podcast better.
For example, the Geek Wolfpack Podcast ends every episode with the segment 
“ADHDD&D” featuring three families connecting on Roll20 (www.roll20.net) to 
play Dungeons & Dragons in between silly tangents. The dungeon crawling usually 
builds up to a cliffhanger of some description — an upcoming battle, a battle that 
appears to be turning on the party, or some kind of tension — and then comes 
an  audio cue of a musical sting. The theme kicks in, quickly followed by a 
(prerecorded) Creative Commons attribution. The D&D cliffhangers offer a quick 
and easy way to say, “Tune in next week. . .” without doing so.
Catch phrase sign-off
Your outro can be the final word from the host, and it should be your bow during 
the curtain call. A signature farewell is a classy way of saying “This podcast is a 
wrap. Thanks for listening.”
For example, throughout the years that journalist Walter Cronkite reported the 
news to America, he always ended with the words, “And that’s the way it is . . .” 
followed by the date. On Technorama, Chuck and Kreg have taken a similar approach 
with their signature sign-off starting with Chuck saying, “And until next time, a 
binary high five.” To which Kreg always responds “1–0–1.” It has become such a 
well-known piece of the show that listeners writing or calling to leave feedback 
close their pieces with the same tag.
If you can’t think of anything overly clever, a consistent exit such as “This 
has  been my podcast, protected by a Creative Commons license. Thanks for 
­listening . . .” works, too.
Credits roll
Another possibility for your outro could be a scripted list of credits: Websites 
where past shows can be downloaded, resources can be endorsed, and special 
thanks can be given to various supporters of your podcast.
When listing credits, take care that your list of thank-yous and acknowledgments 
doesn’t ramble on for too long after every podcast. Some podcasters reserve a full 
list of end credits for special podcasts, such as an end-of-the-season or even final 
episode. By and large, a minute can serve as a good length for ending credits —  
plenty of time to mention relevant websites, tuck in the obligatory “Tune in next 
week .  .  .” statement, and ask for a vote of support on your favorite podcast 
directory.

CHAPTER 8  Cleanup, Podcast Aisle 7!      165
Coming soon to a media player near you
Just as television shows drops teasers of what will be coming up next week, 
­podcasters can also give quick hints as to what is planned for future podcasts. The 
many podcast fiction titles from Mark Jeffrey (http://markjeffrey.net) and 
Scott Sigler (http://scottsigler.com) had already been prerecorded for the 
intent of podcasting. This gave both authors a terrific advantage to edit together 
montages of audio clips and even record a quick synopsis of what will come in 
future episodes.
Previews for future podcasts tend to be difficult to plan — mainly because of the 
spontaneous nature of podcasting that the medium prides itself on. Many 
­podcasters have no idea what will be on the agenda for their next show until the 
day or even a few hours before recording, and then there are other podcasts that 
start up the audio equipment and speak with no prep time for their latest install-
ment. However, for those podcasts that can provide glimpses of things to come, 
this kind of outro serves as a commitment to the audience that there will be more 
­content coming through the RSS feed and that programming is being planned for 
future installments.
As mentioned with intros, your outro can use one of these approaches or combine 
them. Find what best fits your podcast and stick with it. The more consistency 
your podcast can follow, the more professional it sounds  — spontaneous but 
focused, right?

Roll Camera: Video 
Podcasting
I
n its first year, podcasting established itself as an exciting audio option. It was 
truly “The People’s Radio” for your computer, promising a fresh alternative to 
cookie-cutter corporate radio. A few potential podcasters took a closer look at 
the way RSS 2.0 worked and thought, “Wait a second — if we can do this with 
audio, what about video?” So, a few brave podcasters decided to put moving 
­pictures to their podcasts; while people still search for just the right term (vidcast, 
vodcast, vodblog, vlogging, and so on), video podcasting has come to be and 
­continues to grow.
Once upon a time, professional-quality video production (such as editing, post-
production effects, and DVD authoring) on a consumer market was either a pipe 
dream or a hobbyist’s major investment. With the advancements of film technol-
ogy, advancements in home computing systems, and the ease of video-editing 
software, producing broadcast-quality video is not only affordable, it’s expected. 
Add to this the popularity of services like YouTube (youtube.com) and Vimeo 
(vimeo.com), and creative minds both in the amateur and professional circles are 
now looking at video podcasting as an alternative to distribution.

168      PART 2  The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
When to Go Video
Chuck fancies himself as moderately skilled in the ways of live and produced 
video. He’s been working with digital video (DV) at home and work since 2007. 
­However, Tee sports a longer track record with editing video, both in a linear (the 
traditional two video decks tied together to one central deck with a control board 
offering basic post production effects) and a nonlinear (all on a computer, in a 
digital format) method. Even in those early Flintstones-esque days of digital video, 
Tee found the digital filmmaking art nothing short of amazing. Today, with 
­terabyte drives and gigahertz processors, a lot of things have changed, and Tee’s 
opinion has changed as well.
He now finds editing video on his Mac a cruel, demanding mistress . . . that he 
finds nothing short of amazing.
Video production is also not easy. Some of the downfalls to video podcasting are:
»
» A learning curve: Despite what the commercials for laptops of all makes 
insinuate, editing video is not a push-button technology. A lot goes into video, 
even on the most basic of levels; with video podcasts like The Joe Rogan 
Experience (http://joerogan.net), Technorama (www.chuckchat.com/
technorama), Happy Hour from the Tower (www.happyhourfromthetower.
com), and Universe Today (www.universetoday.com), the bar to run with the 
big boys and girls of video podcasting is pretty high.
»
» More production time: With video, you must contend with more than just 
ambient noise. Now you need to consider lighting, camera angles, wardrobe, 
make-up, and so on. Editing also proves more difficult, since you can’t just cut 
a flub out without the host seemingly jumping around. Podcasting audio can 
prove daunting in its production needs, but video is a step up and demands a 
great deal of time and attention.
So, with all these daunting challenges, why go video with your podcast? Here are 
some good reasons to step up to video podcasting:
»
» Your message needs more than sound to get across to your audience. 
If you’re putting together a show for educational or training purposes, 
you may want to feature diagrams or procedures that require visual aids. 
With video, you now can appeal to listeners on a visual as well as an 
aural level.

CHAPTER 9  Roll Camera: Video Podcasting      169
»
» You want a captive audience. The ability or temptation to multitask is 
removed as your subscribers are now applying the visual senses, taking 
advantage of the video features in mobile phones, computers, and other 
devices. They can’t drive a vehicle, cook a meal, or walk Fluffykins while they 
watch your video podcast, so you gain greater audience focus. So, make sure 
the video serves a purpose for your viewers.
OH, YOU TEASE!
Sure, video can take a lot longer to record, edit, upload, and so on than an audio-only 
counterpart. We don’t deny that part. The great thing is that there are ways to make 
quick, short videos that you can use to promote your podcast be it audio or video! Many 
podcasters have turned to services like Periscope and Facebook Live to make short 
vignettes, or teasers to promote a show with larger production. While at your favorite 
con, expo, or weekend event, you may find yourself gathering interviews or some other 
footage for your regular show. Take a few minutes to tell your audience what you are 
working on. Grab your mobile phone and do a quick broadcast. “Hey, this is Chuck 
coming to you live from Phoenix ComiCon. I just got done talking to The Green Arrow —  
Stephen Amell! Be sure to listen to the full-length interview on our site when it comes 
out in a couple weeks.” Okay, it’s a made-up example and maybe Chuck will get that 
interview this year.

170      PART 2  The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
»
» You want to create your definitive vision. In travel podcasts (also known as 
sound-seeing tours), where the sounds of a marketplace provide the host with 
a background, or beer tastings (also called pubcasts, barcasts, or beercasts), 
where the flavor of a local bar filters into the show, or podcast novels, where a 
few sound effects set the scene, the listener’s imagination fills in the blanks on 
what is happening around the podcaster. Now, the subscriber can see and 
(virtually) experience walking through the marketplace in Athens, take in the 
sights and sounds of a Western Yorkshire pub, or see the characters as the 
author intended them to be seen, in the settings he or she imagined.
The Price of Pretty Pictures
You can create video podcasts with any video-editing application running on 
either Mac or Windows. You can use Apple iMovie, Apple Final Cut Pro, Telestream 
Screenflow, or Adobe Premiere to create your episode. When it’s time to export 
your movie out of your video-editing software, many of these applications use a 
format optimized for podcasting.
Of course, you could do the compression by hand, but the question here is why. 
Take advantage of the shortcuts because in this section, we take a closer look at 
other considerations concerning video podcasting.
That file is how big?!
Provided you follow our Cheat Sheet’s compression specs, the standard audio 
podcast of roughly 80MB will cover anywhere from 90 minutes to two hours — of 
audio. When compared with other podcasts that are far more economical in their 
running times, 80MB is huge.
To video, this is chump change.
Tee created a 10-second video clip for The Ministry of Peculiar Occurrences that 
came out to 1MB. Think about that a moment: 10 seconds = 1MB. That is a video at 
standard definition (not high definition, the preferred format for video now) and 
without audio. When video podcasting first came to the hearts and minds of audio 
podcasters, it was a bit of a shock when they tried to make their 20-to-30-minute 
audio into a video equivalent. “How do I get my file size smaller?” podcasters 
asked on various discussion boards. Although the reply might have come across as 
snarky, it was the only available answer: “Make a shorter podcast.” If you have a 
two-hour podcast and are planning to compress your video down to the same size 
(or thereabouts) as that 80MB MP3, well . . . that just won’t happen.

CHAPTER 9  Roll Camera: Video Podcasting      171
Maybe you want to make the jump from standard (720 × 480) digital-video resolu-
tion to high definition (1920 × 1080) resolution. You’re going to want to prepare 
for major demands on both bandwidth and file sizes. Sure, there are compressions 
that will cut your file sizes by half, but your resolution will not be as sharp as the 
version before compression. There is always a trade-off with video. You can’t have 
compression, resolution, and small file sizes. For more about the final steps 
between video editing and compression, consult Digital SLR Video and Filmmaking 
For Dummies by John Carucci (Wiley).
Burn, bandwidth, burn!
Bandwidth is the factor most new podcasters tend to gloss over. That can prove to 
be costly, especially if your podcast is 50MB or higher per download. If you garner 
1,000 listeners, for example, you’ve gone through 5GB simply for that file trans-
fer. If these 1,000 listeners are going through your archives, your bandwidth needs 
to increase exponentially.
Now, suppose you decide to produce a video podcast with some length — let’s say, 
20 minutes. A decent length for a podcast, right? What happens? Your first episode 
is nearly 900MB compressed in the M4V format at a resolution of 1280 x 720 — a 
very hefty download.
It’s even heftier if your podcast is a runaway success. If you have 2,000 subscrib-
ers in your first week, you have burned through 2TB of your monthly bandwidth 
just for that episode. What about the weeks — and the listeners — to come? What 
does your web host offer, and can it handle this kind of traffic for your podcast? 
When you’re looking at video podcasting, consider the running time and file size 
of your episodes, and then look at your web host’s bandwidth.
Lock and Load (Your Camera): Planning 
Your Shooting Schedule
Nonlinear (that is, digital) video applications like iMovie and Premiere have 
­dramatically simplified the process of editing video. However, as we state earlier, 
the commercials aren’t quite accurate when describing the ability to make a movie 
as quick and easy. It’s still far from a push-button technology. We’ve been talking 
about the various demands for your video podcast, but perhaps the greatest 
demand of them all is time.

172      PART 2  The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
YOU’RE ON TWITCH? NOPE.  
STILL NOT PODCASTING.
Maybe you’re thinking “Hold on — there’s a way we can side-step all these demands. We 
can set up a recording studio and use Twitch (http://twitch.tv) to get our podcast 
out there!” You could do that, and not have a concern for time, storage space, or band-
width. Just angle your cameras, get your lighting right, and start streaming.
Sure, you could do that, but you’re not podcasting.
Twitch, first introduced in June 2011 and known best for playthroughs of video games 
and broadcasts of eSports competitions, has branched out to creative content program-
ming from tutorials on Photoshop to live music performances. The content on the site 
can either be viewed live or on demand, but this is where Twitch is entirely different 
from podcasting. True, podcasting can also be streamed on demand, but episodes are 
distributed through RSS, meaning you have the option to have content automatically 
downloaded. The show is brought to you, not requiring you to go to a site. You can sub-
scribe to a Twitch stream, but the video is not distributed through RSS. It is a streaming 
website, meaning you can watch it live or watch it on demand, provided you go to 
Twitch’s website or use its app to watch the stream. So, no, you are not podcasting.
That does not mean that hosts of Twitch streams are not working as hard (if not harder) 
as podcasters. Streamers like OneActual, lulusoccer, Raza528, Frida, and ZGPhoto 
­(pictured here) are known to stream for hours, keeping the conversation and the energy 
up and lively, all while fragging opponents in their favorite video games. Now that’s 
­multitasking.

CHAPTER 9  Roll Camera: Video Podcasting      173
Here’s how the process works:
1.	 Set up the camera, rehearse your podcast (if applicable), and then make time 
to shoot from that angle.
2.	 Reset for the same shot but from a different angle. Shoot your footage from 
the new angle unless you’re lucky enough to have multiple cameras. If so, 
combine the preceding step and this one, making sure you do not catch any of 
your other cameras in frame. (Cinematography speak for catching sight of 
another camera when shooting.)
3.	 Review your video footage and capture (get the video off the camera media 
and into the video editor) it onto your computer.
4.	 Edit your footage together, removing any mistakes, continuity errors, and 
small trips and tumbles. The result is making the whole project appear 
seamless and fluid.
5.	 After all the editing, post-production, and reviewing is done, you must render 
the video, outputting this production in the desired format — be it podcasting, 
streaming (something we discuss later), full-screen video, or DVD.
Depending on the power of your computer’s processors, the length of your video, 
and what format you’re outputting it to, this could take anywhere from a few 
minutes to a few hours to a full eight-to-nine-hour workday.
The allure of video is intense — and don’t mistake us for a moment, we love it! —  
but make sure you give yourself time: time to shoot, time to edit, time to review, 
and time to render.
Make that first episode and then give a second episode a shot. Go for three, if you 
can. Once you have those episodes edited and ready to go, you can decide on what 
kind of posting schedule you want your podcast to follow.
iTarantino: Creating with iMovie
If you’ve just purchased a new Macintosh computer, you have iMovie (www.apple.
com/imovie) within reach. This unassuming application grants you the ability to 
edit video by dragging and dropping clips where you want them on your project’s 
timeline.

174      PART 2  The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
Capturing video with iMovie
You need to get the video off the camera or media it is currently recorded on 
(SD card, internal hard drive, cassette, and so on) and into your computer. This 
process is called capturing. The video is played back and then captured into the 
video-editing application in a format that the program can understand.
We’re going to make the bold assumption that you have a digital video camera, 
digital SLR, or some other device that has your video footage ready for importing. 
Here’s how you get your video off the camera and into your computer for 
editing:
1.	 Launch iMovie.
2.	 From the intro window, select Create a New Project by clicking the big 
plus sign and select Movie.
3.	 Connect your video camera to your computer via USB and set it to 
playback mode.
iMovie detects the camera automatically and brings up the import window 
shown in Figure 9-1. If it doesn’t, you won’t have any options available for 
importing footage. If iMovie doesn’t detect your camera, check your camera 
to make certain it’s in playback mode, has power, and is plugged into your 
computer.
FIGURE 9-1: 
Select the clips to 
import from the 
Import window.

CHAPTER 9  Roll Camera: Video Podcasting      175
4.	 Select the clips you wish to import and click Import selected, or click 
Import All to retrieve all clips on your camera.
Your clips are imported into the My Media Pane, the area on the left in iMovie, 
as shown in Figure 9-2.
The version of iMovie we are using is iMovie v10. As with most software 
mentioned in this book, updates happen. Parts of the interface may change 
between what is shown here and what you get, but the steps should be easily 
applied to any version.
5.	 When your import is concluded, iMovie closes the import window 
automatically and returns to the main editing window.
If your video is on your computer as a data file (MOV, M4V, MPEG, and so on), 
choose File ➪   Import Media (or press ⌘  +I) to import your clips into the My Media 
Pane.
A walk in the park on a clear Spring day, don’t you think? This process is known 
as logging, where you go through and organize your clips as needed.
Always eject your camera like any other USB device before unplugging it from your 
computer to avoid losing data. You can do this from within iMovie’s import screen 
or from Finder.
FIGURE 9-2: 
Your video is 
brought into the 
My Media Pane 
in the order 
of capture.

176      PART 2  The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
Creating your episode with iMovie
When you have your video imported and organized in iMovie, you’re ready to edit 
it into a video podcast. Follow these steps:
1.	 Click and drag your opening clip from the My Media Pane into the 
Timeline along the bottom of the iMovie interface.
The Timeline in your iMovie interface is where you assemble and edit your clips. 
Simply drag and drop clips in the order you want them to appear. By default, 
you’re viewing video in the Timeline as clips (View Clip mode).
2.	 Repeat Step 1 for the remaining clips in your My Media Pane until you 
have your clips in the order you want. See Figure 9-3.
What you have now is commonly referred to as a rough cut. This is your video 
podcast without transitions, set volume level, or any detailed editing. It gives 
you an idea of what the video will look like when it’s done.
The amount of editing your video podcast needs depends on the amount of footage 
you shoot and how detailed you want your production to be. When you have a 
rough cut, here are some editing tricks to try:
FIGURE 9-3: 
After you move 
your clips from 
the My Media 
Pane to the 
Timeline, you 
have completed 
your rough cut.

»
» Navigate throughout your video. A scroll bar across the bottom of the 
Timeline will allow you to move from the beginning to the end of clips, going 
back and forth as needed.
»
» Zoom in and out. Underneath the preview window is a Zoom slider that 
allows you to view the project from beginning to end, or zoom in on specific 
edit points.
»
» Scrub through video. With your playhead, you can scrub through the video. 
Scrubbing is the process of viewing audio at a user-designated speed. You 
scan through segments, find what you’re looking for, and make edits. With the 
left and right arrows, you can also advance through a clip frame by frame.
»
» Make a cut. Move your playhead in the Timeline to where you want to make 
an edit. Choose Modify ➪   Split Clip at Playhead (or press ⌘  +B).
»
» Delete a segment. Click the segment you want to remove and press Delete to 
remove the unwanted video.
»
» Create a cutaway. Sometimes, you want video that breaks the monotony of 
a single shot, more commonly known as a cutaway.
»
» Drop in a transition. Click Transitions just above the My Media Pane and 
select a transition. A transition is a cool way to get from one clip to the next (a 
crossfade, wipe, or some interesting bridge), unlike a cutaway or jump cut 
where one video source switches to another. Click and drag the desired 
transition between two clips to apply it.
To see a preview of a transition, move your cursor over from left to right.
»
» Place a title at the beginning of your podcast. Click Titles (on the same 
row as My Media and Transitions) to bring up the Title Pane. Choose a title 
and drag it to the timeline just above the first clip. Once you place your title 
on the clip, edit the text in the preview window (see Figure 9-4). The Titles Pane 
is the feature of iMovie where you can place animated or static text at the 
beginning, middle, or end of your movie, giving your podcast a polished 
Hollywood touch.
Click the T icon above the preview window to bring up more styling options 
for your title, including font size, color, position, and more.
iMovie renders the title and then incorporates it into the project. If your title 
needs to change, return to the clip with the attached title, select the title, and 
click the T to edit it. When you are done, click the T again.

178      PART 2  The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
When you have your video how you want it, follow these steps to finish your 
podcast:
1.	 Choose File ➪   Share ➪ iTunes.
2.	 After reviewing the dialog box that appears, click Share.

CHAPTER 9  Roll Camera: Video Podcasting      179
Congratulations, you have just edited and output your first video podcast.
iMovie is not only designed to be easy, it’s designed for you to have fun with video. 
Remember to go exploring with its various features. For example, you can take 
your finished episode, export it, then use it (or footage from the original shoot) to 
create a Hollywood-style trailer or a preview of what’s coming soon.
It’s just that easy! With upgrades to Mac OS X and various incarnations of iMovie, 
your interface and your results may vary. You may also find iMovie has a lot of 
features we haven’t even touched. That’s because we’re keeping it quick and easy, 
fast and furious, and above all, to the basics. If you want to find out more about 
editing with iMovie, there are many books on the market that will take you deeper 
into the power of this application. You may also pick up a few cool tips from John 
Carucci’s Digital SLR Video and Filmmaking for Dummies (Wiley).
So what happens when you want to go beyond iMovie’s features and you’re ready 
to do more? Then consider the step above iMovie, Final Cut Pro X (https://www.
apple.com/final-cut-pro), a standard in the video production industry.
FIGURE 9-5:

as easy (and as 
important) with 
video podcasts 
as with audio

DV on the PC: Podcasting  
with Adobe Premiere
Remember Windows Movie Maker? It was considered the iMovie for the PC . . . only 
a lot less easy. In 2017, with all the various options out there for PCs, both for free 
and for sale, Microsoft decided there was no longer a need or demand for its built-
in, free video editor for Windows, and Windows Movie Maker was discontinued. 
The PC market is now awash with so many freeware alternatives available. Find-
ing the right editor for Windows that can meet all the various demands and fea-
tures needed in filmmaking and DV editing has become something of a risky 
business. What’s the best option for you out there?
For podcasters, we focus on two Adobe products that have not only been tried and 
tested, but are considered trusted and reliable by editors of all backgrounds. ­Premiere 
Elements (www.adobe.com/products/premiere-elements.html) is Adobe’s pro-
fessional grade video editing suite made available and affordable to consumers. 
There will be a slight learning curve in finding the workflow that suits you, but the 
user interface is accessible to newcomers to video editing. It does have a price tag 
around $70, but that should fit within most podcasters’ budgets. If, however, you 
are looking for something with more options, also available is Elements’ “big 
brother” Adobe Premiere Pro (www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html) for the 
more advanced producer.
Capturing video with Adobe  
Premiere Elements
For this example, we’re going to assume your video clips are on a digital ­camcorder 
(one with a hard drive, SD card, or some other high-speed storage). If you are 
transferring from a camcorder that uses tape, the instructions are a bit different 
and we encourage you to review the Premiere Elements documentation.
1.	 Make sure your video camera, phone, or DV playback device is connected 
to your PC. Then launch Premiere Elements.
2.	 From the Add Media drop-down box, click Videos from Cameras & Devices 
(see Figure 9-6).
3.	 In the Video Importer window that appears, check clips you want to 
import, or rather, uncheck the ones you don’t want to import since all 
clips are checked by default.
Don’t forget to check out the other options available on the import window, 
such as naming your clips, deleting them after import (to reclaim space on your 
camera), and where the video clips are being stored on your hard drive.

CHAPTER 9  Roll Camera: Video Podcasting      181
By default, Premiere Elements will add all your videos to the timeline. If you’d 
rather have them saved as project assets that you can pick and choose later, 
uncheck the Add To Timeline checkbox.
4.	 Click Get Media to import the selected clips.
If you’re capturing on tape, you will be importing your footage in real time. For 
every second you shoot, it takes a second to import. Also, check your battery 
level or plug your camera in to AC power. There are few things more frustrat-
ing than hitting the Import button, coming back an hour later only to find out 
your battery on the camera has died partway through the import!
5.	 Once your clips are imported, use the Project Assets drop-down to copy 
the clips you want to the timeline (see Figure 9-7).
FIGURE 9-6: 
Use the Add 
Media ➪   Videos 
from Cameras & 
Devices to import 
your clips.
FIGURE 9-7: 
Once imported, 
you’ll find your 
clips in the

­collection, where 
you can drag 
them to the 
timeline.

182      PART 2  The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
Although programs like iMovie and Premiere have simplified video editing dra-
matically, as mentioned earlier, this isn’t a quick-and-easy process. When the 
video is done, it must be processed, and that can take anywhere from a few minutes 
to a few hours, depending on the length of your episode, the dimension of your 
video, and the compression format. Give yourself that time to edit and time to pro-
cess the video you’re creating. Before announcing your video podcast, try to find 
out how those first few episodes will progress in production and finally what the 
processing time will be for a single episode. You may find that a missed mistake 
can cost you hours. Always preview and then preview again before processing.
And We’re Live! — Video Podcasting  
in the Moment
Quick reminder — podcasting is a means to deliver your content, right? So why 
not look at some of the other things the cool kids are doing these days, like 
­Facebook Live, YouTube Live, and Periscope? Instead of recording (and hopefully 
editing), then uploading, posting, and waiting, why not just push a button and go 
online now?! The truth is, you can do both — and you might choose to depending 
on whom you want to speak to and when.
Live events are great for on-the-spot broadcasts such as a car show, parade, or  
a conference floor. You start broadcasting, people can ask you questions immedi-
ately, and you can provide them feedback as well. The downside is, if people 
SCREENCASTING: WHAT’S ON  
YOUR DESKTOP?
Screencasting is a delivery method of an established teaching tool: recording actions of 
your desktop. In a screencast, a podcaster is usually showing off features of a computer 
application (like Evernote, Final Cut Pro, Word, and so on); but instead of using screen 
captures that show drop-down menus already deployed or attempting to film your 
monitor and sacrificing clarity of image, a third-party application like Camtasia 
(https://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.html) or Telestream’s Screenflow 
(telestream.net/screenflow/) captures all actions taken on your desktop in a live 
recording and then allows you to edit with basic editing functions such as copy/paste, 
titles, transitions, callouts, layering, chroma-key, audio tracks, and popular features 
found in most video editing software packages. Subscribers can follow along with the 
video, cursor, menus, and actions all happening clearly and vividly on your media 
player. You also have the additional option of outputting the raw video from your 
­screencasting and importing it into any of the video editors we spotlight in this chapter.

CHAPTER 9  Roll Camera: Video Podcasting      183
missed it, they missed it. Sure, people can go to your Facebook page, YouTube 
­channel, or Periscope page (where your content disappears after 24 hours), but 
that’s a different experience from podcasting, which is delivered to their device 
automatically to watch when they are ready. Are we clear on this yet?
However . . .
These services do offer you the option to download the segment you just shot. This 
means you can always download the clip, edit for an opening and closing segment 
and ID3 tags, and then place it into your RSS feed, distributing the video as your 
next podcast episode. Just like that.
Up Periscope!
Periscope (https://www.periscope.tv), owned by Twitter, allows you to take 
your Android or iOS smartphone, click a button on the app, and start broadcasting 
anywhere and anytime. As mentioned, once the broadcast is over, others can 
watch it for up to 24 hours on Periscope’s website, as shown in Figure 9-8. As well 
as broadcasting, the app is also good for watching videos from others who are 
spouting their message. Like other social networks, you can follow people and be 
notified when they are broadcasting, as well as be followed. You can also answer 
and respond to your viewers in real-time, making the connection with your 
­audience even more personal.
FIGURE 9-8: 
Periscope’s 
website offers 
your audience, 
comprised of

Twitter users, to 
catch your live 
streams up to a 
day after you 
log off from your 
live episode.

184      PART 2  The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
Here is how to run Periscope:
1.	 Download and launch the Periscope app on your smartphone.
The Periscope app is available for both Android and iPhone, and automatically 
syncs up with Twitter once you validate a Twitter account.
2.	 From the Options menu along the bottom of the app, tap the Video 
Camera icon found at the center of the menu.
You can also access Periscope through the LIVE option offered in the Twitter 
app when you are composing a tweet.
3.	 Your interface now features a live picture, a keyboard, Audience options, 
and a field for you to title your Periscope video. Enter your video’s topic 
here.
At any time, you can tap the “X” in the upper-right corner to cancel this video 
and exit this mode. Your Periscope video can be shot either in a Portrait 
(vertical) perspective or a Landscape (horizontal) perspective.
4.	 After you title your episode, tap the red Go LIVE option to begin your 
Periscope video.
5.	 At the end of your Periscope video, the app will offer an option to save 
your video to your Camera Roll. Doing this will save your video episode on 
your smartphone.
With your episode on your smartphone, you can then transfer it to your video 
editor of choice and work with it to prepare to send out on your podcast feed.
When shooting your video, especially if you are doing a video of yourself on 
location, make sure you are aware of your surroundings. It is far too easy to 
lose your footing, bump into someone, or find yourself in a rather precarious 
(if not dangerous) situation. Be careful!
YouTube Live
What more can you say about YouTube? It’s brought us everything from instruc-
tional videos how to fold fitted sheets to people jumping off roofs to teach us all 
that gravity is more than just a theory — it’s the law. Most of these videos are 
recorded on one device and uploaded afterwards. YouTube also offers a live feature 
(formerly called Hangouts On Air until 2016). These can be scheduled ahead of 
time, allowing you to embed a video in to a site with a countdown, or you can start 
streaming immediately. Chuck uses YouTube Live a lot in his day job where he 
does presentations and software demonstrations. Unlike Periscope, YouTube Live 
videos are available on your channel forever — or at least until you remove them.

CHAPTER 9  Roll Camera: Video Podcasting      185
Additionally, YouTube Live events can be broadcast from a mobile device as well 
as your desktop or laptop with a webcam. If you have more advanced software like 
Wirecast Pro from Telestream (https://www.telestream.net), you can broad-
cast directly from your studio to YouTube Live.
1.	 Point your browser to YouTube (https://youtube.com).
2.	 Click your Google Profile icon, located in the upper right of your browser 
window.
Your Google Profile icon should be the image associated with your account. 
A drop-down menu appears.
3.	 Click the Creator Studio button.
4.	 From the menu on the left, click Live Streaming and choose Events.
Even if you want to start streaming immediately, use Events rather than 
Stream Now.
5.	 Give your show a name, set the time (Today/Now is good for an immedi-
ate broadcast), provide a description and keywords. See Figure 9-9.
6.	 Click the Go live now button.
You are presented with one final pop-up informing you that you will be 
brought to a Google Hangout On Air to do your live streaming. You’re still not 
LIVE yet. . . . This is a good time to check your camera and audio settings, share 
your desktop if you plan to do a presentation or software demo, and invite any 
guests you may want to bring in to the conversation.
FIGURE 9-9: 
With a few details 
filled in, you’ll be 
live on YouTube.

186      PART 2  The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting
7.	 Click the Start Broadcast button. 
Now you are live . . . until you hit Stop Broadcast.
If you have guests on your live broadcast, YouTube automatically switches to 
display the person who is talking. This is great if you are having a face-to-face 
conversation but not so great if one of you is doing a screenshare. When the 
others talk, the viewer is pulled out of the screenshare and one of the other 
cameras is displayed. Be sure (as the person running the broadcast) that you 
click the avatar in the lower right of the person you want to lock as the presenter 
while doing screenshares to avoid the flip-flop effect of auto-switching for the 
viewer — very annoying to watch! You will know it’s locked because a white 
border appears around that avatar. When you are done with the screensharing, 
click the avatar again to remove the white border and return to auto-switching.
Don’t forget, YouTube is a social network — that’s why all the content creators 
are constantly begging you to subscribe. When you do subscribe to a YouTube  
channel, you’ll get notifications when your favorite creator is broadcasting live so 
you won’t miss a beat.
Facebook Live
Not to be outdone by Twitter or Google, Facebook has gotten in to the act of live 
broadcasts from your mobile device with Facebook Live. Facebook incorporated 
features Periscope users would recognize, like immediate broadcast capability, 
back and forth engagement until the broadcast is done. Facebook Live also allows 
for desktop broadcasts as well, feeding video directly from software like Wirecast 
Pro (https://www.telestream.net/wirecast/overview.htm). This is how 
Chuck and Kreg do their live stream on Technorama (see Figure 9-10.) When the 
live stream starts up, sharing happens, followers are alerted, discussions start, 
and happiness ensues. Afterwards, the video can be downloaded and distributed to 
your podcast subscribers.
Facebook Live has exclusive live broadcast rights. As Chuck found out after 
upgrading Wirecast Pro in 2016, the software states “if you have the bandwidth, 
you can simultaneously broadcast to multiple destinations.” Terrific! You can do 
YouTube Live and Facebook Live at the same time, right? Wrong! Telestream had 
to write Wirecast in such a way that if you are broadcasting to Facebook, you 
­cannot broadcast to YouTube at the same time. Instead, Chuck and Kreg record a 
local MP4 video file and upload that to YouTube later. The moral of the story is, 
you may have to make choices when you broadcast live. The best bet, go where 
your people are!

CHAPTER 9  Roll Camera: Video Podcasting      187
To do a Facebook Live event, follow these steps:
1.	 Launch the Facebook app on your smartphone.
The Facebook app is available for both Android and iPhone. Also available is 
Facebook’s Pages app. Both Facebook and Pages can shoot Facebook Live 
segments.
2.	 From the status update’s options, tap the Live icon, shown in Figure 9-11.
3.	 Your interface now features a live picture. Tap Describe your live 
video . . . and type in your video’s topic here.
At any time, you can tap the X in the upper-left corner to cancel this video and 
exit this mode. Your Facebook Live can be shot either in a portrait or landscape 
perspective.
4.	 After you title your episode, tap the blue Go Live option to begin your 
Facebook Live. Once the countdown is done, you are broadcasting video 
over Facebook.
5.	 At the end of your Facebook Live video, the app will offer you analytics. 
After a few minutes, Facebook will post the video for replay. People will 
still be able to comment on your video, just not in real time as when you 
are live.

6.	 When you replay your video on your Facebook, you can download the 
video, as shown in Figure 9-12.
With your episode on your computer, you can now import it into your 
video editor of choice and work with it to prepare to send out on your

SERIOUSLY? A SELFIE-STICK?
The much-maligned Selfie-Stick has been either a source of ridicule or, for those really 
lost in their own narcissism, a source of horrifying (if not comical) death; but when it 
comes to video podcasting and using Facebook Live, Periscope, or YouTube on your 
smartphone, a Selfie-Stick saves your arm from a lot of cramping and offers your video 
a bit of stability. With the right angle and the right leverage, your Selfie-Stick works as a 
collapsible steady cam and can allow you better options in capturing more people in the 
moment and even more activity in your shot. Just remember, as we warn earlier in the 
Periscope segment, to be aware — well aware — of your surroundings. Getting the best 
shot for your podcast will not matter one bit if you are dead or recovering in a ­hospital.
And yes, Tee was being very careful with a vintage steamtrain slowly advancing

Y
ou’ve finished your final edit (and if you think we’re skirting blasphemy 
whenever we use the E word, trust us — creativity sometimes demands a 
sacrifice). At last you’re ready to compress your mondo-super-sized AIFF 
or WAV file down to the format that inspires terror and indigestion in RIAA 
­representatives everywhere: MP3.
The MP3 format was designed to reduce the amount of data (via compression) 
required for digitized audio while still retaining the quality of the original record-
ing. MP3 files are the best way to keep the audio small enough in size to make it a 
quick-and-easy download, and it’s this format that podcasting uses to get con-
tent efficiently from podcaster to podcatching client. Although creating MP3s is a 
simple enough process, you do need to make some tradeoffs between quality and 
compression.

194      PART 3  So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice: Now What?
A Kilobit of Me, and a Whole Lot of You: 
Understanding Kbps
The compression process begins with proper bitrate settings, measured in Kbps 
(kilobits per second). Bitrate is a method of measuring data transmission from 
one point to the next. The higher the Kbps value, the more data being transferred 
between two points. The more data being transferred per second, the better the 
quality of information. With each rate of data transfer offered by recording appli-
cations, you can digitally reproduce the various qualities of audio:
»
» 8 Kbps, matching the vocal quality of a telephone conversation
»
» 32 Kbps, yielding audio quality similar to AM radio
»
» 96 Kbps, yielding audio quality similar to FM radio
»
» 128 Kbps, matching audio CD quality, and the most common Kbps used for 
MP3 compression of music
»
» 192 Kbps, a “Higher Quality” setting Kbps used for MP3 compression of music; 
better audio sound, but larger data files
You aren’t married to this listing of Kbps by any stretch of the imagination.  
Figure 10-1 shows that Audacity offers in its Preferences plenty of variations from the 
five common settings. Tweak until you find the Kbps best suited for your podcast.
It’s a tradeoff: The higher the bitrate, the larger your file size is — but the smaller 
your bitrate, the lower your audio quality is. A good idea is to experiment: Com-
press your podcast using one bitrate, save it that way, and then change your 
bitrate to something higher (or lower), save it, and play back each clip to compare 
FIGURE 10-1:

variety of bitrates

how they load and how they sound. Note any changes in sound quality and file 
size. When you find that happy medium between quality and compression, stick 
with that number for your current and future podcasts. 
Setting bitrates in Audacity
Changing bitrates in Audacity is a multistep process. The first step is to get your 
editor all set for creating MP3 files:
1.	 Choose Audacity ➪ Preferences (Mac OS) or choose Edit ➪ Preferences 
(Windows).
The Preferences window opens.
2.	 Choose the File Formats option in the left column (see Figure 10-2).
3.	 Click the Download Free Copy of LAME button in the MP3 Export Setup 
section.
4.	 Follow the steps for your OS as outlined on the web page to download the 
proper files.
5.	 Open the archive file (no need to worry — it’s a safe download) and drop 
it into your Audacity folder.
FIGURE 10-2: 
Before setting 
bitrates in 
Audacity, you 
need to 
­download a  
LAME file.

196      PART 3  So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice: Now What?
6.	 Return to Audacity and click the Find Library button.
7.	 Choose Applications ➪ Audacity (Mac) or My Computer ➪ (Main Drive) ➪  
Program Files ➪ Audacity (Windows) to navigate to the libmp3lame file.
8.	 Select the libmp3lame file and click Open.
This step in setting up the LAME Library is a one-time thing. You won’t have to 
repeat this process again unless you move the library to another location.
Now you’ve come to the point where you set the bitrate. When you have a file, fol-
low these steps to export it as an MP3 file:
1.	 Choose File ➪ Export.
2.	 From the Format menu, select MP3 Files.
3.	 Next to the Format: MP3 Files menu, click Options.
The Specify MP3 Options dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 10-3.
4.	 Choose your desired bitrate from the Quality drop-down menu.
If you’re following our recommendation from the Cheat Sheet for this book, 
you would set the bitrate to 128.
You can also set up your Bit Rate Mode (Constant) and your Channel Mode 
(Joint Stereo). Constant bitrate ensures the bits are output at a steady (con-
stant) rate despite the audio that is being used (including silence). Variable 
bitrate attempts to do a bit of compression — for example, the bitrate of a 
complex music sample would take more space than that of the same length  
of time in a spoken piece with several pauses. Although variable length audio 
sounds good on the surface, it can present problems to the listener — actual 
playback times may not be correct, causing problems when people pause a 
long podcast. Joint Stereo refers to a technique that saves some space when 
FIGURE 10-3: 
Under the MP3 
options, you can 
set bitrates and 
other variables 
for your 
compressed 
audio.

CHAPTER 10  Shrink That Puppy and Slap a Label on It      197
your recording includes mono channels or tracks. Rather than using the space 
of a stereo track (left and right) to save that information, joint stereo tech-
niques recognize it and save space by only using half the space.
5.	 Click OK to return to the Export window.
6.	 Name your file and then click OK.
7.	 You will be prompted to fill out your ID3 tags (see the ID3 tag section of 
this chapter).
After you set the bitrate for this one file, your settings are automatically applied to 
other MP3 files created from this point. Only when you go into the Options for 
MP3 files will you change bitrates.
Changing bitrates in iTunes
It doesn’t matter how your audio files get into iTunes, be it from Audacity, Garage-
Band, or anywhere else. When you get the files in to iTunes, you can easily convert 
them to a different bitrate, change the file format, or make any number of other 
changes to the file.
You can’t get better quality out of a file by changing it from a lower bitrate to a 
higher bitrate. For example, once a file has been saved at 32 Kbps, converting it to 
128 Kbps won’t make it sound any better.
To set the bitrate in iTunes and create an MP3, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose iTunes ➪ Preferences (Mac OS) or choose Edit ➪ Preferences 
(Windows).
The Preferences window opens.
2.	 In the Preferences window, click the Import Settings button.
3.	 From the Import Using drop-down menu, select MP3 Encoder.
The MP3 Encoder dialog box opens.
4.	 From the Settings drop-down menu, select your desired bitrate (shown in 
Figure 10-4).
5.	 Import your podcast episode (currently in an uncompressed format) in 
iTunes by double-clicking on the file.
6.	 Click the audio in iTunes and then go to File ➪ Convert ➪ Create MP3 
Version.

198      PART 3  So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice: Now What?
Care for a Sample, Sir?  
(Audio Sample Rates)
When you have a grasp of bitrates, you’re ready to move on to sample rates. This 
may strike you as a tad redundant, particularly when you see the list of common 
audio-sample rates. A strange déjà vu makes you wonder whether you’re in the 
real world or exist merely as part of The Matrix. No biggie — sometimes technol-
ogy is redundant.
As we discuss in the preceding section, bitrate is a measurement of how much 
audio data is transferred between two points, such as the computer and your 
headset. The sampling rate is a measurement of audio samples taken from a con-
tinuous signal (a signal of a varying quantity, defined over a period of time) in order 
to create a discrete signal (a signal made up of samples from a continuous signal).
Very simply, the sample rate determines the maximum sound frequency that can 
be reproduced — the value you set is twice the frequency value. For example, a 
44.1  kHz sample rate can reproduce sounds up to 22.05 kHz, which is slightly 
above the range of human hearing.
The most common audio sampling rates found in MP3 encoders are
»
» 8,000 Hz / 8 kHz, telephone-quality recording or lo-fi
»
» 22,050 Hz / 22 kHz, equal to AM radio transmission
FIGURE 10-4: 
The iTunes 
options for 
sampling rates.

CHAPTER 10  Shrink That Puppy and Slap a Label on It      199
»
» 32,000 Hz / 32 kHz, equal to FM radio transmission, minimum sound quality 
on a digital video camcorder
»
» 44,100 Hz / 44 kHz, audio-CD quality
»
» 48,000 Hz / 48 kHz, digital TV, DVD, films, maximum sound quality on digital 
video camcorder, and professional-grade audio recording
As with your audio-recording applications, you have a range of bitrates  
available — and you can type in your own custom sampling rates.
Using different sample rates in compressed audio files does not affect the file 
size — only the bitrate and duration affect file size. A high sample rate at a low 
bitrate can result in poor signal representation and thus poor quality, but if you’re 
using at least 64 Kbps (bitrate), there’s no good reason to ever use anything except 
44.1 kHz as the sample rate.
Be careful when using a sample rate other than a multiple of 11. Choosing a sample 
rate other than 11.025 kHz, 22.5 kHz, or 44.1 kHz can produce an effect similar to 
the voices of Alvin and the Chipmunks. It might be funny at first, but most listen-
ers won’t stick around to hear your entire message.
Changing sample rates in Audacity
Sample rates are located in the Preferences window and extremely simple to either 
change or customize to your podcast’s personal needs. Follow these steps to cus-
tomize sample rates in Audacity:
1.	 Choose Audacity ➪ Preferences (Mac OS) or File ➪ Preferences (Windows).
The Preferences window appears.
2.	 Click the Quality option in the left column.
3.	 Select your desired bitrate from the Default Sample Rate drop-down 
menu (as shown in Figure 10-5), or enter your own custom sampling rate 
by selecting the Other option and entering a number.
If you’re entering a custom sampling rate, make sure you enter the rate in hertz 
(Hz) and not kilohertz (kHz). For example, if you decide your sampling rate is 
44.1 kHz, you must enter 44100, not 44.
4.	 Click OK.

Changing sample rates in iTunes
iTunes makes the process of changing the sample rate easy — what else would 
you expect from Apple?
To get an idea of what a good sampling rate is, look at the podcasts your aggrega-
tor is pulling down and check the settings. Press ⌘  +I (Mac) or Ctrl+I (Windows) to 
see the MP3 Summaries. Settings may vary from file to file. As you work out the 
final technical details of your podcast, make sure that one of them is the setting 
that best suits your needs and (of course) your ear.
Follow these steps to change the sample rate in iTunes:
1.	 Choose iTunes ➪ Preferences (Mac OS X) or Edit ➪ Preferences (Windows).
The Preferences window appears.
2.	 In the Preferences window, click the Import Settings button.
3.	 From the Setting drop-down menu, select the Custom option.
The iTunes MP3 Encoder dialog box opens.
4.	 Select your desired sampling rate from the Sample Rate menu.
Apple loves to make things easy for its users, and we love that. However, Apple 
sometimes takes out the “I did it MY WAY!” alternative and does not allow for 
custom settings. Here, iTunes keeps this sampling to the common settings, so 
you’re given no leeway.
FIGURE 10-5:

rate in Audacity.

CHAPTER 10  Shrink That Puppy and Slap a Label on It      201
Note that iTunes offers your sampling rates at kilohertz (kHz), a more common, 
recognizable presentation of a sampling rate. Again, this is Apple looking out 
for you, keeping it to the basics.
5.	 Click OK.
You return to the Import Settings window. The default settings for your MP3 
compressions are now visible in the Details area.
ID3 Tags: The 411 of Podcasting
Is it soup yet? Not quite yet. Adding ID3 tags is the final step before you can upload 
the podcast to your website. This is the final detail (okay, batch of details) that not 
only tells other podcasters who you are, but also tells listeners what your podcast 
is all about, and which episode they’re listening to.
ROCKING THE PODCAST JOINT  
WITH JOINT STEREO
We haven’t discussed the difference between stereo and joint stereo output in this 
chapter, for one reason: It all depends on the method you use for recording — and on 
how you’re listening:
•	 Stereo: By default, many applications that export to MP3 also export as Stereo. 
Stereo encoding takes the left and right audio separately and divides the selected 
bitrate for each. The drawback to (plain) stereo is that the channels are equal width, 
so a 128 Kbps encoding of a mono signal is really two identical 64 Kbps channels, 
resulting in a 50 percent inefficiency.
•	 Joint Stereo: With this option, one channel carries sound that is identical in both 
the left and right stereo tracks, and the other channel carries the difference. Both 
channels are only as big as they need to be, so if your podcast is mostly mono — 
with just one microphone — you’ll get more out of your bitrate than you would with 
a plain stereo file, but without the reliability issues of a mono file.
When working with a consistent sound for your podcast, working in one stereo output is 
something you should consider. Setting standards for yourself and your podcasts lays 
solid groundwork for success. For the writers, their own experiences have them using 
Joint Stereo as the go-to podcast format.

202      PART 3  So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice: Now What?
Because this is a final detail, we find that some podcasters either skip it or just 
don’t care how they tag their podcasts. And there goes any hope for their listeners 
to effectively organize podcasts in a computer’s media player or remind drivers of 
what they are listening to while on their commute. Maybe some podcasters are 
unaware of where or how to identify their podcasts — or want to get their content 
out to the fans ASAP without taking the time to implement these tags.
Whatever the case, we entreat you: Stop the madness, stop the insanity, and stop 
the monkeys. Proclaim your true self for the sake of media players everywhere — 
implement your ID3 tags!
Tell me about yourself: All about ID3 tags
First created in 1996, ID3 tags were designed to be added to audio files in order to 
have the artist, album, and track title displayed in a computer’s MP3 player when 
the file is played back. The current ID3 tags now include composer, bitrate, album 
art, and even genre.
Of course, another question that comes to mind is why would a podcaster want to 
even bother with ID3 tags?
Look at a podcast you’re listening to, regardless of whether you are old schooling 
it on a portable MP3 player or listening through your desktop computer. Your 
podcatching client probably organizes your various feeds by the date down-
loaded,  either with the most recent show at the bottom or at the top of your 
­playlist, depending on the player’s preferences. Each individual podcast has an 
episode title, an artist, and a podcast (show) title. If the podcaster working with 
the ID3 tags is particularly savvy, artwork associated with your show is also 
displayed.
Now hop from podcast to podcast in your MP3 player, and you can tell which 
people care — or don’t — about identifying their shows. Some podcasts simply 
use obscure numbers that could be a date, but when you hear two episodes of 
the podcast back to back, you find out the number and the date read at the intro of 
the show (provided there is one) don’t match up (confusing). With ID3 tags in 
place, you can now look at your player and get an idea of exactly what you’re  
listening to.
When you add ID3 tags to your podcast, you set apart individual podcasts from one 
another, making each one unique but keeping it grouped with your podcast show.

CHAPTER 10  Shrink That Puppy and Slap a Label on It      203
IDentity crisis: Making ID3 tags  
work for podcasting
Some ID3 tags really don’t work for podcasting. Album? Track number? Com-
poser? You’re podcasting, not producing music. Your responsibility (as a pod-
caster) is to redefine the following tags we have found useful for the podcasting 
medium:
»
» Song or Name: This should be the name or number of your episode. 
Examples are Show #19, Episode 3: One of Those Faces, BOOK 
THREE: Chapters 39 & 40.
»
» Artist: This one is pretty self-explanatory. You’re the artist behind this 
podcast, so let people know who you and your group are. Put in your name 
(or at least the pseudonym you’re using as a podcaster) or the name of your 
podcasting team. For example, Philippa Ballantine, August Grappin, 
and Dr. Kelli Dunlap and Josué Cardona.
»
» Album: Here is the name of your show, your show’s website, or your network 
if you are part of a podcast network. Good examples are The Shared Desk, 
Destiny Community Podcast, and Podrunner.
»
» Album Artist: Often left blank, this tag can be a bit tricky for users. You can 
use it to refer to the show artwork artist, the production studio, or the creator 
of the podcast. Examples are Imagine That! Studios and Geek Therapy 
Podcast Network.
»
» Composer: This tag can be used to feature the name of your producer or 
head editor. You can enter your engineer’s name, or the studio where the 
show is produced. For example, The Shared Desk artists is listed as Imagine 
That! Studios but the composers are Tee Morris & Pip Ballantine as 
the show is co-produced and co-hosted.
»
» Grouping: This tag may remain blank until you’re affiliated with a network or 
distribution hub of some kind. Good examples are QuickAndDirtyTips.com 
and Geek to Geek Podcast Network.
»
» Genre: The genre “Podcast” wasn’t offered in drop-down menus of MP3 
creators, but with the growing popularity of the medium, it’s becoming more 
and more common.
»
» Year: The year this podcast episode was produced.
»
» Track Number: Purely optional, this ID3 tag allows you to make sure your 
podcasts remain in some kind of sequential order. For podcast novelists, the 
track numbers coincide with the chapter numbers. If podcasts follow a season 
of multiple episodes, the Track Number coincides with the episode in that 
season.

204      PART 3  So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice: Now What?
»
» BPM: If you are into staying fit and are listening to or producing a workout 
podcast, you want to fill in this ID3 tag as BPM is for Beats Per Minute. BPM is 
also good if your podcast is a house music-dance mix podcast. A good example 
of a podcast showing off BPM is any one mixed by D.J. Steve boy (Pod runner).
If you’re using iTunes and don’t see the Podcast genre, you can manually type 
Podcast into the field.
»
» Comments: As with comments you leave in XML, you can give a quick two or 
three lines of show notes for your podcasts. It’s also a great place to put in any 
Creative Commons notices, websites for more information of the show and its 
hosts, and special dedications.
There may be other tags offered, but for what we do in podcasting, the tags going 
unnamed can remain blank.
Reminiscent of John Cleese’s aside in a Monty Python robbery sketch (“Adapt, and 
improve. That’s the motto of the Round Table”), we podcasters must adapt these 
ID3 tags to our podcasts to improve how they appear in our players. On playback, 
the ID3 tags appear on the listeners’ interfaces, offering a quick glance at the con-
tent of the podcast (as shown in Figure 10-6).
FIGURE 10-6: 
How a properly 
tagged podcast

system.

CHAPTER 10  Shrink That Puppy and Slap a Label on It      205
A peril in working with ID3 tags is spelling errors. There is no spell check in 
Audacity, iTunes, or any other tag editor. Because many directories, search 
engines, and players rely on the ID3 tags to organize and properly display your 
show, make sure to double-check the spelling of your show title, names of people 
involved, and any other text you’re putting in place. Also, some editors like iTunes 
create “quick fill” databases that help you fill in your File Info quickly. This data-
base also includes the misspellings. So, when filling in your ID3 tags, take your 
time and check your spelling.
Creating and editing ID3 tags in Audacity
Unlike iTunes where you tag individual files after they are created, Audacity lets 
you set up a template for the ID3 tags that gets applied when MP3 files are created. 
To create this template, open Audacity and follow these steps:
1.	 Choose File ➪ Open Metadata Editor.
The Edit ID3 Tags (for MP3 Exporting) window opens (shown in Figure 10-7). 
The ID3v2 option is already selected by default.
2.	 Fill in these fields:
•	 Title: The episode name and/or number
•	 Artist: The podcaster or name of the podcasting crew
•	 Album: The show’s name or website
FIGURE 10-7: 
The Edit ID3 
Tags (for MP3 
Exporting) 
window in 
Audacity.

206      PART 3  So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice: Now What?
•	 Track Number: Optional, unless numerical order is a priority in your 
podcast
•	 Year: The podcast publication’s year
3.	 From the Genres drop-down menu, select the option best suited to your 
podcast.
Click the More button to add a customized tag (refer to Figure 10-7). You can 
also add additional ID3 tags and save your tags as a template.
4.	 Give a brief description of your podcast in the Comments field.
Don’t make your comments a long, detailed description of your podcast’s 
content. Keep it simple and brief. For example, if the creators of The Average 
Geek Show (http://www.averagegeekshow.com) were to write comments for 
Show #88, it wouldn’t say “On this show we share the mic with Kenny Rotter of 
the Dumbells & Dragons podcast, chat about Star Wars, Joss Whedon directing 
Batgirl, and how Chris Evans is looking at the future of reprising his role as 
Captain America.” Instead, the podcast would boil down this description to 
“Show #88 — Geek News with Dumbells & Dragons host, Kenny Rotter.”
5.	 Click Done.
And that’s it! When Audacity generates your MP3, your show is tagged and ready 
for uploading.
Audacity’s ID3 tagger does have its limitations. It cannot embed artwork into your 
audio metadata. For that extra touch, use an ID3 Tag editor such as IDTE (https://
sourceforge.net/projects/idteid3tagedito) or iTunes, as we discuss later.
Creating and editing ID3 tags in iTunes
Using iTunes to tag your files offers more flexibility in customizing genres and 
even incorporating artwork than Audacity does. Apple’s media player, encoder, 
and podcatcher also make adding and editing ID3 tags extremely easy. Follow 
these steps:
1.	 Single click your newly created MP3 in iTunes. Choose Edit ➪ Get Info or 
press ⌘  +I (Mac) or Ctrl+I (Windows).
The Info window appears, which gives you a summary of your MP3 file.
2.	 Fill in the following fields:
•	 Song: The episode name or number.
•	 Artist: The name of the podcaster or podcasting crew.

CHAPTER 10  Shrink That Puppy and Slap a Label on It      207
•	 Album: The show’s name or website.
•	 Album Artist: This would be a good spot to give credit to the artwork artist 
or show producer.
•	 Composer: Fill in this field if you have a separate sound engineer, a tech 
guru handling the editing, or if you’re doing the work yourself.
•	 Grouping: If you’re part of a group or network like Farpoint Media, or 
FriendsInTech, give credit here.
•	 Genre: Select one of the offered genres from the drop-down menu, or you 
can select the genre in the field and type Podcast (or whatever genre you 
want to use to classify your work).
•	 Year: The podcast publication’s year.
•	 Track Number: This is optional, unless numerical order is a priority in your 
podcast.
•	 BPM: If you’re doing an exercise show or a music podcast featuring original 
house mixes, give your Beats Per Minute here. Listeners will dig that.
One of the cool bonuses of iTunes is how you can create custom genres. 
Choose Edit ➪ Get Info ➪ Info and enter your own genre here. Or go to the 
song in your iTunes Library and click in the Genre column and edit the 
genre name. When you return to the Info window later, you can see your 
custom genre offered as an option on the Genre drop-down menu.
•	 Comments: A brief version of show notes.
3.	 Take a last look at your ID3 tags to make sure everything is spelled 
properly and listed the way you want it, and then click OK.
Album Art: Getting Graphic  
with Your Podcast
A big piece of successful podcasting is marketing — and a big part of marketing is 
branding. Your podcast logo (or album art) is very important to help set you apart. 
Although not all media players will offer this feature, don’t discount its impor-
tance. A large percentage of podcast listeners use iTunes and listen at their 
­computers — where the album art may be prominently displayed. Also, Apple is 
now requiring Album Art as part of registering your podcast with its directory.

208      PART 3  So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice: Now What?
Once you have your album artwork designed, and you have your tagged MP3 ready 
to go, incorporating artwork into your podcast episode takes only a handful of 
shortcuts and clicks:
1.	 Import your MP3 file into iTunes if you have not already.
Your ID3 tags should be present in this file.
2.	 Single-click the podcast episode and then choose Edit ➪ Get Info or 
press ⌘  +I (Mac) or Ctrl+I (Windows).
3.	 In the Info window, single-click the Artwork tab and then click the 
Add Artwork button to locate your show art.
4.	 Click OK to import your show art.
If you have a Finder window open to where your artwork resides, you can also 
click and drag your show art into the Album Artwork window.
5.	 Take a last look at your ID3 tags to make sure everything is spelled 
properly and listed the way you want it, and then click OK.
If your logo is in a format that iTunes recognizes, it appears in the Artwork field, 
as shown in Figure 10-8. See the sidebar “Art for art’s sake” to make sure your 
logo has the appropriate format.
FIGURE 10-8:

devices.

CHAPTER 10  Shrink That Puppy and Slap a Label on It      209
ART FOR ART’S SAKE
Album artwork, commonly seen in many media players, is a nice option for podcasters 
who want to brand a podcast with a logo. Mur Lafferty’s Parsec-winning I Should Be 
Writing logo is a classic broadcast microphone with a sticky note slapped on it and a 
pencil, sharpened and ready for use. Then you have The Onion Radio News’s trademark 
onion with a globe ghosted behind it, the stamp of quality journalism at its funniest. 
These are icons associated with their shows, and this kind of branding is becoming 
more and more common in podcasting.
But what is the best way to make sure iTunes (and for that matter, the iTunes Store’s 
Podcast Directory) recognizes your artwork? Just make sure that your logo fits the fol-
lowing parameters:
•	 3,000 x 3,000 pixels, both in width and height. The image is large as some listeners/
viewers are now enjoying podcasts through Apple TV. This is a requirement and 
considered a standard.
•	 JPEG (.jpg) format
Keep in mind that when you compress your artwork, overcompression can distort and 
deteriorate its visual quality. Some JPEG settings work in numbers 1–10 or 0–100. As a 
rule, if you compress your logos no more than 50, your artwork should retain visual 
quality.

Y
ou’ve managed to figure out what it is you want to say (or show), you’ve 
gone through the trials and tribulations of the editing process (or not), and 
you’ve faithfully employed correct ID3 tagging (nonnegotiable). That’s 
great, but no one is going to hear your contribution to the podcasting world until 
you put your files up on the web.
In Chapter 1, we cover the hosting provider selection process. In this chapter, we 
take an extensive look at the mechanics of the process, including how to appro-
priately name and organize your files.
Podcasters have a variety of options when it comes to uploading files. Although 
the methods are all different, they all help you accomplish the same job: copying 
files from your personal computer to their new home online. Many hosting pro-
viders have easy-to-use browser-based drag-and-drop file transfer utilities built 
into their service. In many cases, this may be all you need to get your files onto 
your server for others to consume. In this chapter, we dig a little deeper to ensure 
you not only know how to use the simple “Fisher-Price” way of doing things but 
that you understand other options to make it easier in cases where you need to 
maintain files for multiple shows or multiple hosting providers.

212      PART 3  So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice: Now What?
Adopting an Effective Filenaming 
Convention
In Chapter 10, we talk about the importance of the little things, such as ID3 tags. 
Equally important is how you decide to name your podcast media files. In 
this ­section, we illustrate the importance, not only to you as a podcaster, but also 
to your listening audience. Although no hard and fast rules for naming files 
exist, following some common conventions allows everyone to easily find your 
podcasts.
A good naming convention of a podcast accomplishes the following:
»
» Easy sequential ordering: Files should not appear at random in your 
directory. They should line up — first, second, third, and so on.
»
» At-a-glance recognition for your listeners: Calling a podcast media file my 
media file doesn’t help very much. Calling it Bob's Fencing Podcast 
certainly does.
Here’s an example of a well-named podcast media file, if we do say so ourselves:
Tech_Ep500_170301.mp3
Although the structure may not be obvious, this filename adheres to both rules 
and even adds one more:
»
» Tech: This abbreviation stands for Technorama. Starting the filename with 
these four letters organizes the files together in the media folder. For listeners 
who can see only the filename on their MP3 players or computers, they can 
quickly recognize that files starting with these four letters belong to his show. 
Pretty much everyone listens to podcasts through some podcatching client 
these days, but don’t discount that small segment of people who like to 
download files to their hard drive and listen.
»
» Ep500: This is Episode 500 of the show. Referring to each show with a 
sequential number is a good idea, giving you and your fans a common 
reference point that is easier than “Remember when you did that one show 
with that one guy who said that funny thing? Man, that was great!” Having the 
episode number right after the name also ensures that the files stack up right 
in the media folder, as well as in your listeners’ MP3 players. You may want to 
consider adding some leading zeroes to the number so episode 3 (003) comes 
before 500. Add more zeroes if you plan on doing more than 999 shows.

CHAPTER 11  Move It on Up (To Your Web Server)      213
»
» 170301: The date Chuck posted the file. The order he uses here is year-month- 
day. He uses 03 instead of 3 so that dates from October (10), November (11), 
and December (12) don’t intermingle with January (which would happen if he 
used 1 instead of 01). True, in this case the files were already sorted by 
episode number, but you may choose to go with the date first.
Between each element, he adds an underscore (_) simply to provide a clear dis-
tinction of each part for his eye, or anyone else’s eye looking at the filename.
Don’t use any spaces or special characters in your filenames. Stick with A–Z, 0–9, 
dashes, and underscores. Slashes (/, \), octothorpes (#), ampersands (&), and 
others can and do cause problems when creating RSS 2.0 files or when clients are 
handling the file. Also, leaving a space in the filename might mess up a URL, so if 
you want to space things out, use underscores or dashes (for example, use 
My_Podcast.mp3 instead of My Podcast.mp3).
The following examples are from well-respected podcasters who all follow the 
guidelines we set forth earlier:
»
» NMS-2017-04-01.mp3
»
» scienceontriplej20170406.mp3
»
» AC_EPISODE_021.mp3
»
» TSD-075.mp3
Note how each of them identifies the name of the podcast and provides a sequen-
tial way of ordering the files. If you leave out the episode number, as in the case of 
the Science on Triple J file, the year of the podcast ahead of month and day also 
ensures that 2017 files are always grouped together. If the podcaster had used the 
month first, as people traditionally think of dates in the United States, files would 
be mixed based on the month they were released, regardless of the year.
If thinking about the date that way seems a little too strange for you, do what 
Chuck does — stick a sequential episode number in front of your date, and don’t 
worry about it.
Understanding How FTP Works
FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is the method by which you can transfer files from 
one destination to another over the Internet. You likely transfer files every day, 

214      PART 3  So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice: Now What?
from your desktop to your documents folder, from an email to your desktop, or 
even MP3 files from your podcatching client to your MP3 player.
Transferring your podcast files to and from the Internet isn’t much different, at 
least on the surface and even at any depth necessary for podcasters to ply their 
trade. Lucky for you, specialty software exists to make this process even more 
simple. FTPing files has become as simple as dragging and dropping.
Some podcast hosting services such as Liberated Syndication (http://libsyn.
com) make this simple process even simpler by providing a web form to handle the 
uploading of podcast files, as described later in the chapter in the “Uploading to a 
Podcast-Specific Host” section. Browser-based systems certainly remove the 
complexity for many, but it doesn’t hurt to understand the processes outlined in 
this chapter. Many experienced podcasters need more flexibility than the limited 
functionality a browser-based upload process allows.
Regardless of what software, forms, or other assistance you use to move files 
around, the concept of FTP is the same.
FTP has been around for quite a while now. As such, archaic and seemingly non-
intuitive names abound from the start  — such as the following two computer 
systems involved:
»
» Local host: The local host is the computer you are sitting in front of and 
initiating the file transfer from. If you’re using a laptop to connect to your web 
server, your laptop is the local host. If you’re at work and logged in from a 
workstation, your office computer is the local host.
The local directory or local path is the folder on your local host that contains 
the files you want to transfer. You can change local directories at will, but 
most FTP programs have a default starting place. Feel free to move around 
after that.
»
» Remote host: The remote host is the computer or web server to which you’ve 
connected. It’s likely the spot where you’re trying to get your MP3 files to go to 
allow others to download them.
Not surprisingly, the remote host has its own remote directory (the folder on 
the remote system where you drop your files). Again, you can change or 
navigate through remote directories just as you can change the file folders on 
your computer.

CHAPTER 11  Move It on Up (To Your Web Server)      215
Making Your Connection with  
an FTP Application
You need three pieces of information to initiate an FTP connection:
»
» The IP address or hostname of your remote host
»
» Login name
»
» Password
Your hosting company should have provided this information to you. If you don’t 
have it handy, find it. You’re not going any further without it.
All FTP programs do the same job but have slightly different methods of going 
about it. After you grasp the concept, using just about any FTP client is a simple 
process. Here are the general steps you follow to set up a connection in any FTP 
client:
1.	 Launch your FTP client and create a new connection.
Because this step is what FTP clients are designed to do, they usually make this 
process very simple.
2.	 Enter the hostname of your web server, username, and password.
This step identifies the remote system and shows you have access to the files 
and folders it contains.
3.	 Connect using either a button or a menu option.
Depending on the speed of your connection, the connection is established in a 
matter of seconds.
The following sections show you how to use Cyberduck (http://cyberduck.io), 
a free and handy FTP program for the Macintosh system, and FileZilla (http://
filezilla-project.org), a similar program for the PC. You can find many FTP 
programs as freeware, shareware, and shrink-wrapped software, for every brand 
of modern day operating system. We picked these two for their ease of use and 
streamlined approach to getting the job done, but you can use the FTP program of 
your choice.

216      PART 3  So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice: Now What?
Step by step (or quack by quack)  
setup for Cyberduck
After you download the Cyberduck program from http://cyberduck.io onto 
your Mac, you can follow these steps to set up an FTP connection in Cyberduck:
1.	 Click the New Connection button in the upper-left corner.
The Connect dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 11-1.
2.	 In the Server text box, enter the name of your server.
Depending on the requirements of your ISP, this name can be in the format 
of ftp.mydomainname.com or perhaps simply my_domain_name.com. And 
of course, you need to be sure and use the name or IP address of your web 
server. Chances are good that you don’t really own the domain my_domain_ 
name.com, right?
3.	 Enter your Username and Password in the text boxes.
The hosting company should have provided this information. If your hosting 
company is the same company that is supplying your connection to the 
Internet, it might be the same information you use to check your email. But if 
you toss some additional money each week at a hosting provider, it’s likely 
something completely different.
Select the Add to Keychain option to store your username and password for

If you entered things properly, you now see the file folders on your remote 
web server. If you didn’t, you get an error message or a login failed dialog box. 
Correct what’s wrong and try it again.

When your connection is established, choose Bookmarks ➪   New Bookmark. Give 
your newly created connection a catchy name and simply double-click the given 
name the next time you need to connect.
Step by step setup for FileZilla
FileZilla (http://filezilla-project.org) operates much the same as Windows 
Explorer, allowing you to drag and drop files between your PC and your FTP server. 
When you’ve downloaded the FileZilla program, follow these steps:
1.	 On the Login toolbar (shown in Figure 11-2), enter your server name, 
username, and password.
Leave the port blank. (It defaults to 21.)
2.	 Click the Quickconnect button.
If you did things right, you see a lot of text scroll by in the upper-most window and 
content from your web server appears in the right windows, labeled Remote Site.
Congratulations; you’re now connected to your web server. If you entered 
something wrong, you get an error message in red text in the upper window. 
Correct your mistakes and try again.

218      PART 3  So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice: Now What?
From here, you can navigate through the folders on your web server much as you 
do on your computer’s hard drive. You can move up or down the file system, find-
ing the spot where you want to drop your podcast files.
A place on your web server  
for your stuff
Logging in to your web server for the first time can be an intimidating process. In 
this section, we show you how to place your files in a location so you can easily 
create links to your podcast files.
Don’t be intimidated by the odd directory names on your web server. The only one 
you really need to know is Public_html. Other hosts may call it www or simply 
html. If you don’t have one of those three, poke around until you find one that has 
a bunch of files in it that end in .html.
Look, but don’t touch. Going into folders doesn’t hurt anything, but doing silly 
things such as deleting, renaming, and moving files you know nothing about is a 
bad idea. All those strangely named folders do something, and they’re likely nec-
essary to make your website work right. Remember the proverb “’Tis best to leave 
functioning web servers lie. . . .”
You may see lots of different files and a few folders. We show you how to add even 
more files to this system, so now is a good time to think about organizing and 
housekeeping.
Start by creating a special place to keep your podcast files. Making a new folder 
exclusively for your podcast media files not only separates your podcasts from 
your other critical web server files, but it also allows you to quickly see what is 
currently live and what needs to be cleaned up.
In your root directory (the top-level folder usually denoted with a forward slash), 
create a new folder called media. With Cyberduck, choose File ➪   New Folder, fol-
lowed by entering the name in the resulting dialog box. On FileZilla, right-click 
the window with the details (date, size, permissions) on the remote file server and 
choose Create Directory.
After you create the new media folder, double-click the name of the folder to 
open it. You’re now inside your totally empty media folder, and ready to load it 
with your podcast media files.

CHAPTER 11  Move It on Up (To Your Web Server)      219
Uploading your files
After you set up a folder for your podcast media files and decide on a filenaming 
convention, you’re ready to move your freshly named files to the web server.
Both Cyberduck and FileZilla support drag-and-drop file transfers. If you’re new 
to FTP, the FTP program interface may be easier for you to use.
For Cyberduck, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose File ➪   Upload.
2.	 Browse your system to find the podcast media file you want to upload.
3.	 Click the Upload button.
For FileZilla, here’s what you do:
1.	 Navigate to the desired folder using the Local Site window on the left.
2.	 Select one or more files and/or folders from the window directly below.
3.	 Drag the selected files to the Remote Site window on the left.
Depending on the size of your file and the speed of your Internet connection, the 
file may transfer in a matter of seconds or a matter of minutes. When completed, 
the file appears in your FTP client and is ready to be linked in your show notes and 
RSS 2.0 feed.
UNDERSTANDING UNMETERED 
AND UNLIMITED
Okay, time for a couple more terms you’ll want to be familiar with when dealing with 
your files and your hosting provider:
•	 Unmetered bandwidth refers to the policies of certain hosting companies, like 
Liberated Syndication (http://libsyn.com), that don’t base their monthly 
charges on the number of files transferred (podcasts downloaded) each month.
•	 Unlimited server space means you can host 1 or 1,000 different podcast media 
files on the web server and be charged the same flat fee. We don’t know of any 
hosting company offering unlimited server space currently, but you can get close. 
Many hosts offer gigabytes for a cheap price — sometimes even hundreds of 
­gigabytes — which is effectively unlimited.

220      PART 3  So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice: Now What?
Uploading to a Podcast-Specific Host
Podcast-specific hosting companies significantly simplify the uploading process; 
many include web-based forms that take the place of additional computer pro-
grams to handle the uploading process. They also take care of archiving, RSS 2.0 
creation, and even ID3 tagging.
Although this web-based uploading process is simple, we prefer the flexibility of 
using an FTP client — or better yet a command line interface. Or maybe we’re old 
school. . . .
For the purposes of illustration, we use an account with Liberated Syndication 
(http://libsyn.com) in this section. If you haven’t already, you need to sign up 
with LibSyn and create your own account. Then follow these steps:
1.	 Begin at LibSyn’s home page. Enter your username and password and 
press the Login button.
UPLOADING FILES WITH YOUR  
BLOGGING SOFTWARE
Many popular blogging tools allow podcasters to upload files without the need for spe-
cial FTP software, much like the HTTP process.
However, podcast media files often exceed the file size requirements for these services. 
For this reason, we recommend not using your conventional blogging software to 
handle your podcast media file uploads.
Consider that blogs are primarily used to communicate text. Although you can easily 
extend the functionality of a blog to support a podcast, the site management tools are 
designed for text and images.
WordPress (http://wordpress.org) does allow file uploads, but the file size depends 
on system parameters that are often set by the web host and can’t be changed by the 
individual. You can upload, but it does take a significant amount of work that exceeds 
the scope of this book.
Instead, we recommend using blogging software to manage the posting of your content 
after your file is uploaded to the server. In WordPress, this is easily done with a plug-in 
called PowerPress (https://create.blubrry.com/resources/powerpress).

CHAPTER 11  Move It on Up (To Your Web Server)      221
2.	 Click the Content menu option and select Add New Episode.
You are taken to the New Content page, as shown in Figure 11-3.
3.	 Click the Add Media File button.
4.	 Click Upload File From Hard Drive if your files are on your local hard 
drive. There are other options available if your file is on another server 
accessible via FTP or Dropbox.
The File Upload dialog box opens.
Note: HTTP upload is another name for form-based transfers.
5.	 Find the podcast media file you want to upload and either double-click 
the file or select it and click Open.
If you’ve used proper ID3 tags on your podcast — and you have by this point, 
right? — you can check the Populate Form with ID3 Data checkbox to save 
some time. Just be aware that the description may need some additional 
formatting as the importer doesn’t recognize paragraph breaks. Also check 
your title and description for encoded characters. You may need to do 
touch-ups like replace &amp; with the & character.
6.	 If you did not choose to import the content of the ID3 tags, enter the 
information for your blog and/or podcast in the form.
The blog settings are very simple: things like the name of your blog, your email 
address, and what category you want it placed in. Nothing here is mission 
critical, so fill it out however you want to see it listed. You can always come 
back and change it later.
7.	 When you finish, click the Publish button.
While LibSyn has full hosting capabilities, some may find the blogging feature a 
bit limited and use LibSyn as a file repository while hosting their blog on their 
own site, then referencing the files on LibSyn from their blog. To access files 
stored on LibSyn in your blog (and resulting RSS feed) follow the preceding steps 
to upload and publish the content. Then follow these steps after your file is 
published.
1.	 Go to the Content menu and select Previously Published.
2.	 Locate the file in the list and click the Link/Embed icon for that episode.
3.	 Copy the URL from the Direct Download URL field and use that as the 
location of your file in your blog software as needed.

222      PART 3  So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice: Now What?
LibSyn offers an FTP interface if you prefer to use an FTP client or command line 
interface. Your login and password are the same as through the web interface.
If you prefer to try it before you buy it, LibSyn offers up to a free month with the 
promo code podcast411 allowing you to get a feel for how it works before you fork 
over your hard-earned cash. Not that the very inexpensive monthly fees will break 
you or anything, but it’s nice to know how your future home might work.

Providing Show Notes
S
how notes are brief summaries of each podcast episode. Show notes can take 
the form of an outline, a detailed bulleted list, or just a few sentences of text. 
In this chapter, we show you how to effectively use show notes to enhance 
the listener experience of your show and bring in additional traffic to your podcast 
through search engines.
And where do you find these show notes? Simply enough, on the podcast’s 
website.
Getting additional traffic means additional bandwidth consumption, which 
can cause issues. Flip to Chapter 11 for tips on ways to reduce the load on your 
servers and for info about optional hosting plans that don’t charge for additional 
bandwidth.
Show Note Etiquette
Several schools of thought exist on how to approach show notes. Some podcasters 
say you should be very brief, using notes only to hold URLs and other pieces of 
important offline data that your listeners may not have had time to write down as 

224      PART 3  So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice: Now What?
the show was playing. Others suggest show notes should be filled with informa-
tion on each concept touched upon in the show. Whether you prefer a more 
­moderate approach or a deeper dive into the format of your show, your personal 
tastes and style go a long way in determining what is right for you.
Setting aside the length of your prose and the level of detail you want to explain, 
you need to follow some basic rules of etiquette:
»
» Use intriguing and informative titles. In general, and to keep things simple, 
the title of your show notes should match your episode title. Your title is 
your pitch; you’re a huckster competing for the attention of listeners. Some 
listeners may know all about you; others could be seeing something from you 
for the first time. Include keywords in your title that accurately and specifically 
represent the contents of this episode. Your keywords should also generate 
some excitement and make the episode sound interesting and intriguing to 
potential listeners.
»
» Include links to resources mentioned in the podcast. If you’re talking 
about a trip to the local museum, provide a link to the museum’s website 
in your show notes. If you mention another podcast, link to it. If you 
­mention a news story or opinion piece, drop that URL into your show 
notes. Don’t forget about music credits and affiliate or sponsor links too! 
Good ­linking brings good karma, and it may provide some interesting and 
potentially helpful “Hey, you linked to me!” comments (and backlinks) 
from others.
»
» Concise or complete? Show notes can be as simple as a bullet list of topics or 
as detailed as a word-for-word transcript of your show. It’s up to you. The 
advantage to the bullet list is that it’s quicker to put together, obviously. If 
you’re already scripting your podcast, it’s no extra trouble to post the script, 
but be aware of the length. A transcript for a 3-minute show is easy for people 
to read from their browser; however, a 45-minute transcript — yes, there are 
45-minute shows that are completely scripted — may be something you don’t 
want the reader to go through.
Figure 12-1 displays how Phil Clark and Mark Naski of The Brit and Yankee Pubcast 
(http://thebritandyankee.com) use show notes. The notes include plenty of 
backlinks, time marks, and a brief discussion about the topics covered. A thing of 
beauty, to be sure.

CHAPTER 12  Providing Show Notes      225
Planning the Post
The amount of time you spend planning your show notes is inversely proportional 
to the amount of time you spend during your show prep (see Chapter 5). If you 
forgot everything from your high school math class, allow us to paraphrase: The 
more you prepare for your show, the less time you spend working on the show 
notes — and vice versa.
Examine the notes you used when you recorded your podcast. Did you talk about 
any websites? Find the URLs and make sure you spell them right. Test them. Make 
sure they are headed to the right place. We highly recommend the copy- 
and-paste technique for URLs, rather than relying on your typing skills, especially 
for lengthy URLs.
If you recorded and/or edited your show hours or days before you started this 
notation process, replaying the media file with pen and paper at the ready is a 
good idea. Look for need-to-know moments and jot them down as the show plays. 
After it finishes, use a search engine to find additional, relevant URLs you may 
want to provide to your listeners.

226      PART 3  So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice: Now What?
It’s all in the details
Now is a good time to figure out what level of detail you’re going to employ in your 
show notes. Several factors can influence your decision, and audience expectation 
and personal choice are among the more important.
Here’s a good rule: The deeper you dive in to a single topic on your podcast, the 
less detailed your notes need to be. That may sound counterintuitive, and please 
keep in mind this is only a general rule and not a law. For example, if your podcast 
episode features a 20-minute interview with Theoretical Physicist Dr. Michio 
Kaku on his book Physics of the Impossible and how applicable those ideas are to the 
Star Wars Universe, you likely won’t have much more than a link to buy the book 
and/or rent the movie.
Show note details serve two primary purposes:
»
» To act as a table of contents for the episode
»
» To allow listeners to skip ahead if they so choose
As the podcaster, you can decide how much or how little you embrace these pur-
poses. Here are some approaches that other podcasters have adopted:
»
» Add a time stamp on segment or topic changes. Some podcasters put the 
exact time stamp of when they change topics, which can be frequent depend-
ing on the show’s format and its host. Time stamps can be quite helpful to 
your listeners if you cover a wide range of topics in each episode and want to 
assist possible listeners in jumping around.
»
» Write in complete sentences and paragraphs. Taking cues from the world 
of blogging, many podcasters, such as Michael J. Riggs’ Steamrollers Adventure 
Podcast (http://riggstories.com/the-podcast), write show notes in 
prose, using complete sentences and paragraphs in place of bullet points and 
time stamps. This approach feels better to potential readers, giving them a 
flavor of the show without having to listen. However, we’ve also heard 
listeners complain that key elements are difficult to find in this format.
»
» Create a simple one-line summary. Some podcasters, such as Manoush 
Zomorodi’s podcast Note to Self (https://www.wnyc.org/shows/notetoself), 
take a minimalist approach and post simple one-liners or maybe three 
­sentences that quickly sums up what the show will cover. We suggest new 
podcasters not follow this lead because it doesn’t do much for helping attract 
new listeners. Many shows that take a quick summary approach enjoy a 
wider distribution method. In this case, Note to Self is also broadcast over 
WNYC93.9FM.

CHAPTER 12  Providing Show Notes      227
Detailed show notes improve your search engine rankings, and they enable web 
surfers to determine the value of an episode before listening. For Tee’s Destiny-
themed podcast, Happy Hour from the Tower, he uses a detailed, time-stamped 
­bullet approach to what he, Nick Kelly, and Brandon Kelly cover in their 30-­minute 
talk show. Show downloads and subscriptions spiked whenever the guys talked 
about hot topics for the week (the launch of “Age of Triumph” and the announce-
ment of Destiny 2’s release, for example) as these keywords appeared in show 
notes as well as blogpost tags. That’s how powerful show notes can be.
A picture is worth a thousand words
Some podcasters include a representative image or two in their show notes. 
Although random graphics serve only to increase your bandwidth consumption 
and clutter your page, well-selected images can add flavor and dimension to your 
show notes. In some cases, these are the same images used as album art in the 
episode files.
Before you add an image to your post, keep in mind these three considerations:
»
» Is the image protected by copyright? Posting someone else’s creative work 
without first securing permission (which may include royalties and fees) is 
stealing, pure and simple, and can land even the most well-meaning pod-
caster in a heap of legal trouble.
»
» Can you link directly to the image, or do you need to copy it to your 
server? Some sites, such as Amazon.com, allow you to link directly to images 
as they sit on the website. These sites have a huge technology infrastructure 
and can handle remote hosting images that appear on other sites. But many 
smaller and personal sites can’t handle the load a popular podcast can put on 
their systems if they allowed direct linking to their stored images. In these 
cases, copy the image to your own server before adding it to your page. If 
you’re going to do this, it’s good karma to provide an image courtesy of . . . link 
to the original site. Again, this assumes you’ve received the appropriate 
permissions to copy the file. When in doubt, don’t.
»
» Does the image fit on your page? Images too small or too large aren’t doing 
your listeners any favors. Make sure the image you select is the right size. You 
can add width=”x” height=”x” declarations to your image tags to control 
the size or use your blog engine’s editing presets to resize the image (better to 
go larger-to-smaller than the opposite direction), but keep in mind that this 
might distort the image. Previewing your post with resized images is a must. If 
your HTML is a little rusty, check out Coding For Dummies, by Nikhil Abraham 
(Wiley), for additional help.

228      PART 3  So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice: Now What?
Posting Your Show Notes
If you’ve planned and prepared, posting your show notes is easy. And if you’ve 
decided for the quick-and-dirty approach or don’t really care to use show notes, 
this process can go quickly as well because there’s nothing to do, right?
In this section, we show you how to enter your show notes by using WordPress 
and LibSyn as examples. If you use another tool to make your posts, or if you cre-
ate your notes by hand, you still get value out of these examples as we show you 
things to consider along the way.
Posting in WordPress
WordPress is free, easy-to-use blogging software that also works well for 
­podcasters. Follow these steps to post show notes in WordPress (https://www.
wordpress.org):
1.	 Log in to your website’s site administration page.
By default, you typically can find a Login link on WordPress pages. If you’ve 
already provided credentials, the link may say Site Admin. In most instances, 
the URL looks something like: www.your_domain_here.com/wp-admin.
2.	 Choose Posts  ➪    Add New from the menu along the left of your browser 
window, as shown in Figure 12-2, to start a new posting.
You can also select +New from the menu across the top of your browser 
window. A new posting page opens. Here’s where you fill in the details of your 
new posting. Although this screen displays a lot of items, you don’t need to use 
them all to get started.
3.	 Select the appropriate category for your podcast from the Categories 
section.
Though not critical, categories help keep things more organized. It’s not 
uncommon to have one category for text/blog entries and another for 
podcasts.
4.	 Enter the title of your podcast in the Title text box.
Label your show with a short descriptive tag, Classic Car Auction, for example. 
For more titling help, see the “Loading up your titles” section, later in this 
chapter. To make the reader’s life easier, we recommend using the same title 
on your show and your show notes.

CHAPTER 12  Providing Show Notes      229
5.	 In the large text area below, enter your show notes.
Follow a chronological order and list the various topics covered in your show, 
one on each line.
6.	 Be sure to add URLs to any websites you mention (see Figure 12-3).
To create a link, highlight the text you want to link and then click the Link 
button (the chain link icon in the WordPress interface). Copy and paste the full 
URL — including the http:// part and then either click the blue Enter icon or 
press Return. Make sure to set them to open in a new tab, so listeners keep 
your page open and can easily return to visit your other show note links.
7.	 Connect your podcast file to the blog.
Before entering in your show notes, you will want to install a plug-in. Pictured 
here is Blubrry’s PowerPress interface, but there are others out there you can 
install into your WordPress. Your media file should be on your server, so use 
that pathname from your server and the plug-in will detect your file.
What if you wanted to feature a podcast you were on? What is the best way to 
share that experience with your audience? Well, this is when you syndicate an 
episode. The episode is reaching your feed, but the statistics go back to the 
podcast creator. Podcast plug-ins make syndication incredible easy. Instead of the 
media hosted on your server, it appears on another server, or a remote server. Go 
to your plug-in and use the entire URL in your podcast plug-in — for example, 
http://theotherpodcast/episodes/path_to_yourinterview.mp3.
FIGURE 12-2: 
Once you log into 
the WordPress 
interface, you can 
begin a new post 
either be going 
to the +New 
option from the 
top menu or 
the Posts option 
from the 
left-hand menu.

230      PART 3  So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice: Now What?
8.	When you’re done entering your show notes, click the Save Draft button.
You can see a preview of your posting by clicking the Preview button — it’s not 
a bad idea to verify the format and ensure links will work before releasing it to 
the public.
9.	After clicking Preview, scroll through your post to proof it.
Make sure links work properly — including your podcast file. Few things are 
more embarrassing than releasing that long-awaited podcast only to find that 
a link in your show notes doesn’t work. When you’re just starting out, you likely 
won’t have a lot of people letting you know of technical issues. It’s up to you to 
test as much as you can before releasing a new episode.
10.	Return to your post editor and make any adjustments necessary.
If you notice links that don’t work or typos, you still have an opportunity to fix 
them by scrolling back up, making the edits, saving your work, and repeating 
Step 9 until you’re satisfied.
11.	When you’re satisfied with your show notes, click Publish.
You can also choose the Schedule option and enter in a date later in the week 
to cue shows for automatic posting.
12.	Click the View Site link at the top of the page to see how your entry looks.
Visiting your web page is a good idea to make sure everything looks as you expected 
it to. If it doesn’t, simply edit the post and save your changes.
Many podcasters with detailed show notes use the <More> tag in their WordPress 
postings, as shown in Figure 12-4. Any text above the More link is displayed on 
the main page. Those with interest to view the detailed content can click the link. 
If you have lots of show notes to include in your post, this is a good way to keep 
your front page tidy with a few bullet items for each show, and then you can hide 
the longer list.
FIGURE 12-3: 
Each plug-in will 
have its own 
interface, but 
what is essential 
in distributing 
your media is 
making sure you 
know where your 
episode is on 
your server.

CHAPTER 12  Providing Show Notes      231
Posting on LibSyn
Because LibSyn (www.libsyn.com) is a dedicated podcast hosting provider, the 
steps are quite intuitive and a bit different than those used by folks who work with 
blogging software.
Follow these steps to post your show notes on LibSyn:
1.	 To create a new post, click the Publish tab or the link of the same name 
from the main page.
2.	 Click the New Post option button.
LibSyn also allows text-only posts to the site, which is great for times when you 
want to post some text without a media file, such as to say, “I’m on vacation for 
the next two weeks.”
3.	 Enter a title for this episode.
We cover some titling tips later in this section. For now, simply enter a basic 
description of what this episode is about — “Classic Car Auction,” for example.
4.	 Choose a category for your podcast from the Category drop-down list.
Categories on LibSyn work like they do with most blogging applications. To 
keep this simple, choose Podcast from the list.
5.	 Skip the Post Image drop-down list for now.
Yes, you can put something in there if you must. But it’s not required. See our 
earlier comments on using images in this chapter if you decide you can’t live 
without one (but you probably could).
FIGURE 12-4:

WordPress screen

232      PART 3  So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice: Now What?
6.	 Enter the detailed show notes in the Show Notes text box.
This is the appropriate place for your detailed show notes. Follow a chronologi-
cal order and list the various topics covered in your show, one on each line. Be 
sure to add URLs to any websites you mention.
Typing the URL in this section isn’t quite as effective as providing a true 
hyperlink. Making a hyperlink isn’t difficult, though it may look that way if you 
aren’t familiar with the mysteries of HTML.
Hyperlinks follow this convention:
<a href=”link/to/website/or/web/page”>Name of link</a>
Basically, you fill out what’s between the quotes, replace the name of the link, 
and you’re done. Here are a few real-world examples:
<a href=”http://www.chuckchat.com/gmail”>Gmail Podcast</a>
<a href=”http://morevi.net”>Morevi podcast</a>
<a href=”http://marsrovers.nasa.gov/gallery/images.html” target=”_ 
blank”>Pictures from Mars</a>
Take note of the target=”_blank” part of the last link. By including that in the 
HTML tag, you are telling the link to open in a new browser tab.
7.	 Choose your podcast media file from the drop-down list.
If you haven’t uploaded the show yet, LibSyn makes it easy. Simply click the 
Browse button and navigate to the appropriate file in your media folder (which 
we show how to set up in Chapter 11).
Because LibSyn doesn’t allow you to preview your post first, we highly recom-
mend checking your spelling and double-checking your links before you 
proceed. An ounce of prevention and all that.
Figure 12-5 shows how your post looks on LibSyn before it is posted.
8.	 Click the Publish button.
LibSyn makes it hard to screw up, requiring you to fill out the appropriate fields 
before allowing you to continue. If you’re successful, you see a green check box 
next to your new post.
9.	 Check your page.
Click the link to your show name and see how it looks in the real world. Check 
your links, spelling, and layout. If it’s not the way you want, close the window 
and click the name of your post to edit it.

CHAPTER 12  Providing Show Notes      233
It never hurts to mention that you have show notes. You can do so as part of the 
running dialog — for example, in the middle of your show dialog say “. . . We found 
a great deal on those at Frobozco. We’ll have a link in the show notes on our web-
site . . .” or mention it at the end of the show with contact information, as in “Don’t 
forget to stop by our website, where you’ll find links to everything we mentioned 
in the show notes, information on how to contact us, and much more at www . . . .”
Using a wiki for your show notes
A wiki is a website that allows your listeners to contribute to your show notes. This 
may sound rather scary — “let others modify MY website? Are you crazy?” Before 
you dismiss the idea, consider sites like Wikipedia (www.wikipedia.org), one of the 
foremost reference sites built entirely by volunteer public efforts. Now imagine the 
power of your listener community helping you build and maintain your show notes. 
By giving your listeners access to show notes, details you might miss can be pro-
vided by those consuming your media. Keep in mind, you are not handing over the 
FIGURE 12-5:

notes on LibSyn.

234      PART 3  So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice: Now What?
keys to your castle to your listenership. Any changes listeners provide are sugges-
tions. In the end, you make the final approval to what is contributed and what is not.
One method of using the wiki is to post a framework, or bullet list for your show 
notes, and let the users contribute. Another way is to just start writing and let the 
user community come along and do the cleanup.
Note that wikis won’t work for every podcast. It takes a certain level of listener 
loyalty — something the podosphere has no shortage of.
You can employ a wiki in two basic ways: Build one yourself or use a wiki someone 
else has built. We discuss each way in this section.
Using MediaWiki
MediaWiki (https://www.mediawiki.org) is the software that runs the popular 
Wikipedia. The software is freely available to anyone who wants to set up a wiki. 
It does require you to maintain a database with your web hosting provider. Check 
the website to install the software.
Installing MediaWiki is similar to installing WordPress in that it requires you to 
have a web host that allows you to upload and install software and access to a 
MySQL database. Some web hosts, such as Dreamhost (https://www.dreamhost.
com), may provide a One-Click Install option and allow you to run it through them.
When it’s installed, you can create pages specifically for show notes. MediaWiki 
does use special formatting characters to create links, bulleted lists, numbered 
lists, and more; however, using the wiki formatting characters is simpler than 
trying to teach yourself HTML. An example of your show notes in a MediaWiki 
page might look something like this:
=Show 15: HP Laptops and me=
* Introduction
* The week in review
* [http://www.microsoft.com Software troubles]
In this example, the line flanked with one or more equal signs (=) indicates a 
­section heading. The more equal signs, the further the indent. The lines starting 
with asterisks (*) are a bulleted list. The last line enclosed with the single square 
brackets ([ ]) is a link to another site; everything after the site is the text ­displayed. 
In this example, the web browser displays a link Software troubles, which takes 
users to the Microsoft home page.
The following steps show you how to create a new page of show notes. We assume 
the top-level page is at http://www.mysite.com/wiki.

CHAPTER 12  Providing Show Notes      235
1.	 Click the Log In/Create Account link in the upper-right corner.
2.	 Log in to your wiki with your username and password.
Assuming you set up the wiki, you already have an account. New visitors must 
use the link Create an Account.
3.	 Click the Edit tab.
The page will change to Edit mode, allowing you to enter text in a large text area.
4.	 Create a page link.
Enter the formatting code [[Some Text]], where Some Text is the name of 
your page. For example, [[April 30, 2017]].
5.	 Click the Save Page button.
MediaWiki goes back to Browse mode. You now see a link with the text of your 
new page link. Note that the link is in red, which means there’s no actual page 
for this link — yet.
6.	 Click the newly created link.
You’re taken to the same page editor as before, but there’s no content. This is 
where you enter your show notes using the formatting codes for headers, 
bullet lists, and so on.
7.	 Click the Save Page button.
Congratulations! You’ve created your first set of show notes using MediaWiki.
In very little time, you can create fairly extensive show notes and then link to 
them from your blog post. Other listeners can then come along (and set up 
accounts if necessary) and make changes.
You can use the wiki for more than show notes. You can create almost any 
web content to support your show from listener show suggestions to results to a 
contest — there’s practically no limit to the ideas.
Most wikis feature revision control — meaning you can roll back changes in the 
event something goes wrong. With multiple people editing the same information, 
it happens from time to time.
Using Wikifoundry
If you don’t have the ability to install software on your hosting server (which 
MediaWiki requires), or setting up your own wiki just isn’t your thing, you can 
still take advantage of a wiki’s features with a site like Wikifoundry (http://www.
wikifoundry.com). Figure 12-6 shows a sample of show notes from Technorama 
using Wikifoundry.

236      PART 3  So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice: Now What?
Wikifoundry is a free site to manage wikis. Begin by going to the site and creating 
a login ID. You can create a personalized wiki and give it your own hostname —  
for example, http://technorama.wikifoundry.com.
Updating your wiki is as simple as running a word processor. Just click the Easy 
Edit button at the top of any page. The graphical toolbar makes it easy to create 
headings, bulleted lists, and even insert widgets like an RSS feed so visitors to 
your wiki know your recent postings to your web page. And the best part for you 
is that no HTML is required!
You can use the same wiki for other crowd-sourced information. Chuck and Kreg 
ask listeners to put in their birthdays and give them a shout out on the show when 
their time of year comes around.
Boosting Search Engine Rankings  
with Good Show Notes
One tangible benefit of quality show notes is the impact they can have on your 
listings within search engines. Traditional search engines cannot (yet) scan and 
index the contents of your podcast media files. As such, you need to provide text 
for search engines to examine and evaluate for index inclusion.
FIGURE 12-6:

show notes from

CHAPTER 12  Providing Show Notes      237
Podcasters can pick up a lot of tips and tricks from bloggers and other website 
owners on how to boost search engine rankings. Many include page-level changes 
to positioning of elements, correct usage of headings, meta and image tags, and 
back-linking techniques. That conversation is far beyond the scope of this book, 
so grab a copy of SEO For Dummies by Peter Kent (published by Wiley) if you want 
to make a bigger splash.
In the following sections, we show you some best practices you can implement 
right away that can make your notes (and podcast) more accessible to search 
engines — and ultimately search engine users.
Loading up your titles
Search engines (and searchers) pay close attention to titles. You should consider 
the title of your individual podcast episodes every bit as important as the title of a 
given web page.
Important as they are, most podcasters struggle with effective titles. The biggest 
problem comes from confusing titles with descriptions. If your title starts with 
“In this episode,” stop right there. You’re writing the description, not the title. 
A title is a string of well-chosen and crafted words that has no room for superflu-
ous baggage.
We find that the best titles come from a reexamination of your show notes. If you 
haven’t made your notes yet, you may find coming up with a solid title quite 
tough. Here’s the process we suggest:
1.	 Read your show notes and pull out the key elements, thoughts, or 
themes covered on the show.
Let’s say you have a podcast on a Classic Car Auction. In your show notes, you 
have covered:
•	 Sleeping in the Seattle airport while the flight was delayed
•	 Interesting discussion during the flight with an 80-year-old man who is a 
car restorer
•	 Under the hood of the 1965 Ford Mustang
•	 Custom headers and exhaust systems
•	 A short interview with the owner of a 1972 Chevy Nova
•	 Taking a 1957 Chevy Belair for a cruise
•	 Listener feedback request: What’s your favorite classic car

238      PART 3  So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice: Now What?
2.	 Boil down each element to a single word or phrase, if possible.
Think about the people who might be interested in the contents of your show 
and pick common words they’re likely to search for.
Potential show titles from your bullet list above:
•	 Sleepless in the Seattle
•	 The Old Man and the Chevy
•	 Two Decades of Drive
•	 Making a Classic Your Own
These all make solid titles, giving searchers a good tease about what they can 
expect. It all depends on what kind of title you want for your show. A sense of 
humor? Alliteration? Something more literal? Whether your audience is more 
casual or, in the case of our Classic Car Auction podcast, more serious collec-
tors and restorators, you select the key points from your show notes and 
condense them to what works.
Notice how the title doesn’t cover everything, and it shouldn’t try. That’s the job 
of the description where you can go into even greater detail, plus the many other 
things you talk about on the show.
Titles also carry good keywords likely to be of interest to your audience. Chances 
are good that you know your audience much better than we do. Think about how 
people are likely to search and write your titles for that. Keep them short, don’t try 
to cover everything, and employ more detailed descriptions to carry the rest of 
your story.
Soliciting backlinks
Backlinks are the Holy Grail of search engine optimization. A backlink is simply a 
link from someone else’s website to yours — whereas a regular link is from your 
site to another. Sites that have a lot of backlinks pointing to them are considered 
more important to the computers that control where your site shows up on a 
search engine. To get backlinks from others, you must create links to their 
­websites in your show notes.
When you’re soliciting backlinks from sources, make each email personal, ­provide 
the exact link you want them to use, and tell them why you think it’s important 
for them to link it.

CHAPTER 12  Providing Show Notes      239
Before you post your show, contact other podcasters, bloggers, and perhaps 
­notable websites to see whether they’re interested in linking to you (and you to 
them) to generate interest in your podcast, rather than a specific show. Many sites 
have a section somewhere for related sites. This can be a very effective tool for 
drawing people to your site and your podcast. Then you can also find folks who 
might want to backlink to particular episodes.
You’ve posted your show and got your show notes online. It’s time to start solicit-
ing backlinks to individual episodes:
»
» Company backlinks: Write to the companies that manufacture the custom 
headers to tell them you’re posting a review of one of their products. Getting 
big companies to link to you doesn’t always happen, but sometimes it does. 
And getting backlinks from big popular sites is very beneficial to your rankings.
»
» Courtesy backlinks: If someone helped you with a part of your podcast and 
you mention it in your episode, let that source know. Send an email to the 
agency you booked the trip with and maybe even the hotel.
»
» Backlinks from fellow podcasters: If other podcasters cover topics related 
to your episode, let them know about it because they might be willing to spare 
you a backlink. Notify various car bloggers and podcasters about the new 
episode. It takes only a few moments of your time and is information they 
would or should welcome.
A fine line exists between asking for backlinks and spamming someone. If you 
can’t think of a good reason why that site should link to you, then you don’t 
ask for it; otherwise, just mention what your show is and what you’ve covered 
that might be of interest and let those site owners decide whether they want to 
provide a backlink.

Speaking Directly 
to Your Peeps
C
ommunication can be defined in a multitude of overly complex ways. For 
the sake of argument (and not to copy each and every dictionary entry we 
can find), we define the term this way:
The exchange of information between two points.
Note that last part — between two points. To us, this implies a bidirectional flow of 
information, to and from both parties.
If you’ve had the pleasure (note how well we can say that with a straight face) of 
attending any productivity or team-building seminars, the presenters really drive 
the message home: Effective communication is not a one-way street.
Over the past few years, podcasting has evolved as a more effective communica-
tion than traditional media (such as radio or television). We all have the same tools 
to communicate at our disposal — email, websites, phone lines — so why do pod-
cast listeners seem to get more involved with podcasting? Two simple reasons:
»
» There seems to be a closer bond between podcast consumer and podcast 
producer. The simple fact that anyone can do this makes the producer seem 
more like a real person than a personality and easier to relate to.

244      PART 4  Start Spreadin’ the News about Your Podcast
»
» The podcasters are asking for the feedback — and getting it. Audience size 
doesn’t matter. We’ve seen some instances of shows with a couple hundred 
loyal followers where the podcaster has to spin off a second show just to 
handle the listener feedback.
In this chapter, we show you some real-world examples of how to foster com-
munication between you and your audience, touching on a variety of methods and 
venues you probably haven’t considered.
Gathering Listener Feedback
It must be a natural human reaction to fear the opinions of others. Perhaps it’s 
insecurity, but we think it has more to do with our culture’s constant reinforce-
ment of the “How are you?” — “I’m fine. You?” — “Fine.” meaningless chatter 
that precedes most of our conversations.
That cultural crutch, however, is left next to Tiny Tim’s seat when it comes to 
podcasting. Listeners, for whatever reason, are compelled to give real and mean-
ingful criticism. And podcasters, for the most part, take to heart those responses.
Of course, we’re speaking in general terms. Yes, there are flamers and trolls out 
there with less than helpful opinions at the ready. Podcasting can’t change basic 
human nature for the ill-evolved, unfortunately.
You can foster good communication with your listening audience in a multitude of 
ways, such as:
»
» Allowing and responding to comments on your blog
»
» Creating and visiting online discussion groups and forums
»
» Responding to listener email
»
» Participating in online social networks
»
» Leveraging voice mail
So, let’s get cracking on how we make these methods of reaching out and touching 
someone work for your podcast.

CHAPTER 13  Speaking Directly to Your Peeps      245
Fostering Comments on Your Blog
In an ideal world, all communication, feedback, rants, and raves about your show 
would take place in a neat little box, keeping things nice and tidy for you. But 
because that won’t happen, your best bet is to build a website that both enables 
and encourages the communication in your own backyard.
In Chapter 12, we demonstrate how much adding show notes can improve reach-
ing new audiences on account of search engine optimization (SEO). Well, here’s 
one more reason show notes are important to your podcast — show notes serve as 
mechanisms for interaction.
In the world of blogs, this interaction is referred to as comments. Visit just about 
any blog you can find, read a post, and you’re likely to find a small Comments link 
at the bottom. Figure 13-1 shows one example, though the treatment varies widely 
from site to site.
If you’re already using a blog, you usually don’t have to do anything special to 
turn on the Comments feature. Most software comes configured to accept com-
ments by default. If you decide comments are not for you or your podcast, turning 
off that capability is simply a matter of selecting the right option.
FIGURE 13-1:

gets quite a few 
comments on 
each episode.

246      PART 4  Start Spreadin’ the News about Your Podcast
Some podcasters get dozens of responses per episode. Some get none. Although 
there is some relation to the size of your listening audience, the frequency of your 
podcast, and the number of comments you’re likely to receive, it really has more 
to do with the connection users feel they have with your podcast.
Much like two co-workers chatting about last night’s The Late Show with Stephen 
Colbert, two or more listeners using your website to talk to each other about your 
show speaks to the attachment they feel to what you have to say (or play). From 
the very first moments of attachment, you can nurture for your podcast its own 
community. Here are some simple ways we recommend to foster your following:
»
» Mention that you have comments on the blog either as a standard practice as 
part of the show — part of the intro, outro, or break perhaps.
»
» Include a one-line promotion of your podcast in your email signature.
»
» Ask questions during the show and direct listeners to your blog to leave their 
comments or opinions.
»
» Actively respond to received comments.
Communication develops amongst the listening community itself. Rather than 
talking to you, listeners start talking to each other, and the conversation — and 
sometimes, the community — takes on a life of its own. If this happens to you, 
don’t fret over it. Encourage it! Podcaster Jack Mangan did just that during the run 
of Jack Mangan’s Deadpan (http://jackmangan.com) blog. Comments on individual 
show posts were consistently reaching into the hundreds, and these comments 
would begin on one show only to break off into a tangent of their own and appear 
on another show. The activity had become so lively when the podcast was live that 
Jack developed a regular segment where he used a 20-sided die to pick several 
comments at random to read on the show. Even with his podcast on hiatus since 
2015, long-time fans of Jack Mangan’s Deadpan continue to banter between one 
another on the show’s blog and even schedule yearly “MMMMMeetups” so fans 
can get in real-time face-time with Jack and one another. This kind of interaction 
between host and listeners reinforces the value of a community that not only sup-
ports your show but meets regularly on your blog to share links, feedback, and 
random thoughts. Even after your show goes dark.
Sometimes, comments that take on lives of their own mutate into hostile take-
overs, and the conversation is lost amidst an onslaught of personal attacks either 
to other posters or to you, the podcast’s and blog’s host. Neither your community 
nor you need this kind of conversation. You may want to consider moderating blog 
comments. Moderating still allows people to post comments, but you get to 
approve those comments for public consumption. When someone posts a com-
ment, you get an email. With a couple mouse clicks, you can choose whether to 

CHAPTER 13  Speaking Directly to Your Peeps      247
approve it. You have to do a little more work, but moderating ensures all com-
ments meet your quality standards.
You may find your name or podcast mentioned other places on the Internet via 
search engines (discussed both in this chapter and Chapter 12). We recommend 
you get engaged with those discussions as well. Be sure to check back in a couple 
days for additional follow-ups, or if you are responding to a blog comment or 
forum, check to see if they have an option to alert you to replies.
Focusing on Online Forums
An online forum allows individuals to post their thoughts and ideas on a variety of 
topics — at their own choosing. Through a concept known as threading, multiple 
discussions can exist independently of all the others. Topics can get buried quickly 
in a mailing list like those mentioned in the previous section. Forums work 
­differently, keeping all threads and topics available for clutter-free commenting 
at any time.
As easy as it is to create places for these types of conversations to occur, someone 
else may have already done it. Spend some quality time searching the Internet for 
your name and your show. Maybe a devoted fan has already done the not-so- 
heavy lifting for you.
Finding free, hosted forums
Using a hosted forum, like a hosted blog, takes away much of the burden of down-
loading, installing, and configuring the software. On the other hand, you don’t 
have quite the flexibility with a hosted solution as you would with a package you 
host yourself. One of the easier hosted forums to use is ProBoards. To get started, 
just follow these steps:
1.	 Browse to www.proboards.com.
If you have a ProBoards account, enter your username and password.
If you don’t have an account, click the Sign Up link.
2.	 Create a username.
Choose carefully. Your username becomes part of the URL that followers will 
navigate to. We suggest using your show name as the username.

248      PART 4  Start Spreadin’ the News about Your Podcast
3.	 Enter the remaining information in the form.
Provide a password, your name, email address, and category for your topic.
4.	 Click Sign Up.
Information regarding your newly created forum will be displayed including the 
URL to publish, your administrator account, and password. That’s it! You’ve 
created a new forum, like the one shown in Figure 13-2.
5.	 Customize the forum.
Click the Admin link at the top of the screen, and you can create new boards, 
categories, and other customizations to create a framework around which 
discussions can happen. For example, visitors will find it easier to find informa-
tion about where to get car parts if that discussion is kept separate from 
auction values for classic vehicles.
6.	 Send invitations.
Using the same etiquette as a distribution list, let the world know your forums 
are available. You can send an email or announce it on your podcast.
Keep in mind the issue of how some people might see invitations as spam.
FIGURE 13-2: 
ProBoards offers 
free forum 
hosting that you 
can use for your 
podcasts.

CHAPTER 13  Speaking Directly to Your Peeps      249
That’s it! You can now customize your forum, start new posts, and spread the 
word of your newly created forum. Much like discussion groups, you can promote 
your forum by
»
» Posting the address on your website
»
» Adding the address to your email signature line
»
» Mentioning the forum on each of your podcast episodes
Other hosted forums are available. You can find plenty of options by entering 
hosted forums into a Google search. Most are supported by web ads or voluntary 
donations.
Forums take some time to build steam. Be persistent, post every day, and con-
stantly encourage your listeners to interact with you and your podcast in this 
manner. But above all, be patient!
Now, although your forum performs admirably — for free — it most likely doesn’t 
have The Look (and you know what we mean by The Look) of other online forums. 
Popular podcasts also host forums that sport a spit-polished look, interfaces that 
make posting and replying easy-peasy, and little details peppered throughout 
that make you think “Wow, I’d love to have a forum that does that!”
You can . . . but a bit more effort (and investment) is needed. See the following 
section.
Remember when we said podcasting has an element of marketing with it? Here’s 
another opportunity to take your name to the people. Developing a public forum 
means your information becomes available to a lot of potential listeners. They 
may find your discussion list and become interested in your podcast, rather than 
the other way around.
Gaining more control of your forum
After a time, you may find yourself wishing for more control of your lively forum. 
Perhaps you’d like to implement the look and feel (branding) of your website on 
the forum, eliminate the advertisements you get with the free service, or more 
tightly integrate your forum into your overall web presence. When that happens, 
it’s time to think about installing some forum software on your website.
Here we go with the tech stuff again. We’re not going to go into great detail on 
how to install and configure forum software on your web server. But we give you 
some things to think about when wrestling with the decision of using free forum 
software or dropping some cash on one you can purchase.

250      PART 4  Start Spreadin’ the News about Your Podcast
There’s the old saying: Why should I pay for the cow when I get the milk for free? 
Choosing between a free or paid solution depends on many factors, at the top of 
which are your level of technical prowess and tolerance for downtime. Like any-
thing in life, there are tradeoffs with each option. Consider this checklist:
»
» Are you comfortable editing PHP or Perl scripts?
»
» Do you have the ability to create new MySQL databases?
»
» Can you change the permissions of files and directories on your web server?
»
» Are you willing to continually seek out patches and updates to keep the 
hackers out?
»
» Can you handle having your forum down for days on end while you research 
problems?
»
» Do you want to field “I can’t remember my password” questions from your 
listener base?
»
» What is the capital of Assyria?
If you answered No to one or more of the preceding questions, you probably aren’t 
ready to tackle installing your own forum software.
If you answered Yes to all the preceding questions — except for the last one, and, 
by the way, the answer is Aššur — you don’t mind getting your hands dirty. We 
recommend finding out what forum software your hosting company already has 
preconfigured on your web server, if any. If your hosting company doesn’t have a 
forum preconfigured for your system, start searching through the multitude of 
options out there ready for downloading and installing. You can also visit some 
existing podcast sites that use forums and ask them what they use, what they like 
(or dislike), and perhaps some of the technical details.
One option for your own forum is to consider open source solutions that 
many  podcasters implement on their sites. For the Fear the Boot guys of 
www.feartheboot.com, their forums as seen in Figure 13-3, are powered by phpBB 
(www.phpBB.com), a download that needs only your web host to support PHP 
(a programming language that gives site developers methods of creating dynamic 
content that interact with databases) and databases in order to work. Although 
knowing PHP helps you use phpBB to create a better forum, it isn’t a prerequisite. 
With its built-in GUI (graphic user interface), phpBB can do quite a lot for you, 
even if you know nothing about PHP. It’s a bit like working with the WordPress 
blogging software in that you can use what phpBB provides or go beyond it with a 
background in PHP.

CHAPTER 13  Speaking Directly to Your Peeps      251
Moderating a forum takes only three to four hours a week for troubleshooting, 
answering user requests, and keeping the spammers and forum troublemakers at 
bay. Four hours is a modest investment considering the return is a strong com-
munity of Fear the Boot listeners.
Like blog comments, you might find your name or podcast being thrown around 
other forums. We highly suggest you sign up and participate in the discussion. 
Respond to the comments — positive or negative. (See the section about not-so- 
positive comments later in this chapter.)
Like many other things on the Internet, the most popular software is often the 
biggest target of attacks from spam and hacking  — that includes phpBB. You 
might want to choose a “path less traveled” like Simple Machines Forum 
(www.simplemachines.org) that is very secure and easy to set up.
Social Media
Social Media has become a part of our lives over the past decade and a half. Online 
communities built around these platforms are made up of profiles, tweets, 
updates, pages, images, and snaps for people of all ages and backgrounds. They 
can serve as one-stop shops for when you pay a visit, or combine popular forms 
of communication into a hybrid that gives you all the best features. Some of these 
FIGURE 13-3: 
Fear the Boot 
hosts a forum 
with sizzle,

phpBB.

252      PART 4  Start Spreadin’ the News about Your Podcast
platforms have been online longer than podcasting has been around, but podcast-
ers rely on these platforms as a ways and means of reaching new audiences.
We cover many of the more popular networks out there. Yes, there are more than 
the ones highlighted here, but these are the ones getting a lot of the attention.
You can find plenty more social networking sites out there, and many more will 
probably appear (and disappear) in the time it takes this book to reach your hands. 
What’s important is finding the network or networks that can get the word of 
your listeners back to you, help you create a better show, and make you a better 
podcaster.
Facebook
Facebook (www.facebook.com) has evolved from the “alternative to MySpace” 
(yeah, remember when MySpace was cool?) to a one-stop shop offering a blog, bul-
letin board, online scrapbook, video streaming, and forum, all on one convenient 
location. Facebook gives registered users the ability to create online Groups where 
comments can be circulated across others’ networks as well as your own. You can 
also establish a Page where you control the message being sent out to the public and 
boost posts that will appear in Facebook News Feeds around the world. Facebook 
provides your listeners a quick interface both through your computer and your 
mobile device to not only offer feedback on what just went live, but also preview 
what’s coming up next on your podcast. You can also use your Groups and Pages to 
solicit voicemail or offer up polls that serves as instant content for your show.
Facebook now offers Facebook Live (as we talk about in Chapter  9), a video 
streaming service where your mobile device’s camera captures where you are, 
what you are doing, and what you are saying. While you are filming, comments 
and reactions are shared with you and your audience. If you are sharing video in 
your podcast feed, you can easily download your video and drop it into your feed. 
If you would prefer not to offer video, then go on and pull the audio from your 
Facebook LIVE segment, then drop it as a new podcast episode. Facebook LIVE can 
be used as either a promotional device for your podcast, or provide content for 
upcoming episodes.

Carolyn Abram (Wiley).
Twitter
Twitter (www.twitter.com) continues to be a fantastic and instantaneous way of 
beginning conversations, garnering feedback, and getting word out about your 

CHAPTER 13  Speaking Directly to Your Peeps      253
podcast while not becoming a distraction or time-sink from your productivity as 
Facebook sometimes tends to be. Twitter, either through its website, its mobile 
app, or a third-party application that is Twitter-enabled, gives you 140 characters 
to say anything. You can use Twitter to direct people to your blog when a new 
show posts. Listeners can post (or tweet) what they’re listening to and comment 
on it. From various tweets, topics can be created on the blog or forums, resources 
can be cited, and quick announcements can reach a wide variety of listeners in 
moments.
Twitter delivers the instant gratification of posting a comment but gives you only 
140 characters to do it, preventing you from losing your intent in a drawn-out 
posting. It’s based on the premise of answering the question “What’s happen-
ing?” If you find people listening to your podcast, ask them for feedback. Good or 
bad, begin a simple chat and ask for the opinions of others in your Twitter net-
work. Use Twitter to post teasers on upcoming episodes, ask for validation from 
comments found elsewhere, and tweet relevant links either you or your listeners 
provide that tie back to your most recent episode’s topic.
Before Facebook LIVE, Twitter developed its own video streaming platform  — 
Periscope (www.periscope.tv)  — allowing for viewers all over the world the 
opportunity to comment on what you are sharing. As we discuss in Chapter 9, your 
video in Periscope can be saved to your phone, and then uploaded either to your 
feed or your video platform of choice. If you would prefer not to offer video, then 
go on and pull the audio from your Periscope segment, and drop it as a new pod-
cast episode. Periscope can be used as either a promotional device for your pod-
cast, or provide content for upcoming episodes.
Pinterest
Known more as a haven for D.I.Y. projects or slow cooker recipes, Pinterest 
(www.pinterest.com) is a platform waiting for you and your podcasting street 
team to take full advantage of. How podcasters should tap into the potential of 
Pinterest is to understand how Pinterest works. Think of the social network as a 
visual bulletin board and every time you post a new show, you go to your virtual 
bulletin board and post an image relevant to your show. That could be your show 
art, or it could be an image you dropped into your show notes. Your fans go up to 
this board, click the image you just posted, and they eventually find themselves on 
your podcast’s site. That’s how boards on Pinterest work.
Set a podcast board for your show, and then, when putting together show notes, 
incorporate relevant images for whatever you are talking about. When you create 
a new post — Pinterest calls this a pin — Pinterest will ask where to pull images 
from. Use your latest episode’s URL and then pick an image to represent the new 

254      PART 4  Start Spreadin’ the News about Your Podcast
content. Others in your Pinterest network can now interact easily with this by 
either leaving a comment or re-pinning it to their boards, reaching a whole new 
network.
YouTube? For audio?!
“My podcast is audio-only. What possible use could I have for YouTube?” Yeah, that’s 
what many podcasters think — they couldn’t be more wrong. The challenge is 
that YouTube (www.youtube.com) doesn’t allow uploading of MP3 files. Every-
thing has to be a video. It’s not a big leap to use something like iMovie, Premiere 
Elements, or Screenflow to take your audio track, slap in an image, and create a 
video file you can put on YouTube. You’ve already done the editing for the audio 
file (if you’re in to that sort of thing). Now it’s just a couple additional steps to 
import and export to upload to YouTube. If you skipped over Chapter 9, this gives 
you a good opportunity to go back and find some of those useful bits for creating 
a simple video file.
What’s the point of putting your audio-only podcast on YouTube? Simple: You 
want to be where the people are. Billions of people are on YouTube all looking for 
content. Suppose your podcast is on Chinese history . . . People are searching for 
information on Chinese history on YouTube. Sure, it may not be your biggest dis-
tribution channel, but like the other sections in this chapter, it’s all about making 
yourself as visible as possible.
One example of a successful podcast published on YouTub is the TGGeeks podcast, 
shown in Figure 13-4.

Instagram
Instagram (www.instagram.com) may not come to mind as a promotional plat-
form or communication channel for your podcast, but with some ingenious 
approaches, the image-exclusive platform gives your podcast an exciting new way 
to let people know that new episodes are live and how to send feedback through 
voicemail.
So how do you turn an app all about capturing the moment visually into a com-
munity platform for your audio podcast? It may require a few workarounds, but 
once you find your workflow, it becomes second nature after a few postings.
Once your latest episode goes live:
1.	 Mail your Show Art to your smartphone.
At the time of this writing, there are no apps that allow you to upload photos 
from your computer to your Instagram account. Instagram was always meant 
for smartphones.
2.	 Save the Show Art into your smartphone’s Photo app.
3.	 Open your smartphone’s browser and find your new episode’s URL. Copy 
the URL to your phone’s clipboard.
4.	 Launch Instagram and go to your Instagram profile by tapping your 
profile icon in the lower-right corner of the app’s Options.
5.	 Tap the Edit Profile option.
6.	 Where you can enter in a URL for your Instagram profile (shown in 
Figure 13-5), paste the new episode’s URL into your profile.
You can use the main URL for the podcast, but the individual episode’s URL will 
take your audience directly to the new episode.
7.	 Tap “Done” to accept and activate the changes.
8.	 Tap the Create Post option (the “+” icon) in the Instagram menu.
9.	 Create a new Instagram post with your Show Art as the featured image. 
Be sure to include in the post “Follow the URL in my Instagram profile . . .” 
so people know where to find the new content. (See Figure 13-6.)
URLs are not active in Instagram posts.
If you are creating an Instagram profile just for your podcast, you do not want 
an Instagram account that is nothing but images of your Show Art. You will 
want to either create “Instagram Show Art” that feature images relevant to 
your show’s content, or post other content that may be in tune to your 
interests, or even the show’s interest. Reporting the same image over and over 
again could get you reported as SPAM and, in turn, shut down.

Now that you have your podcast featured on Instagram, how about giving your 
listeners an easy way to leave you voicemail? They are already on their phones. 
How can you make that happen?
1.	 Launch Instagram and go to your Instagram profile by tapping your 
profile icon in the lower-right corner of the app’s Options.
2.	 Tap the gear icon in the upper-right corner of your screen to access the 
Account Options menu.
3.	 Scroll down to the Switch to Business Profile option. Tap this option and 
follow the steps to link this Instagram account to a Facebook account.
You will be asked to link your account to a Facebook Profile. Any Pages where 
this Facebook Profile is listed as an Admin will appear as an option for where 
you can post.
4.	 In the steps featured on switching your Instagram account from Personal 
to Business, you will be prompted to enter in various contact options. 
Enter in your email and voicemail line here.
On finishing this process, you will notice your Instagram profile now comes with 
a Contact button. By tapping this button, visitors to your Instagram profile can 
directly reach out to you, as shown in Figure 13-7.

Social media offers you these options and a whole lot more. These platforms are a 
breeze to set up, but you know what else is easy-peasy to set up? Voicemail. If you 
have a smartphone and if you can navigate through Google, you are only a few 
clicks away from your own voicemail account.
Using Voicemail
One of the strengths of podcasting is that the content is so portable. That means 
your listener is quite likely to be away from a computer while listening to your 
podcast — making the interaction more difficult. Plenty of people, including your 
authors, listen to podcasts during their commute to work or on road trips. How do 
you get comments from those listeners? Simple: Have them call in.
Mobile phones are practically ubiquitous. It’s a fair assumption that if your listen-
ers have one — they will often listen to your podcast on it. If you want those lis-
teners to give you feedback, give them a number to call. Many podcasters have set 
up a number through Google Voice (https://voice.google.com). Google Voice 
lets people call and leave a message.
To set up a “listener line,” follow these steps:
1.	 Sign up for a free Gmail account (https://mail.google.com) if you do not 
already have one.
2.	 Go to https://voice.google.com.
Notice the message at the bottom of the screen that prompts you to choose a 
number. In the left menu, seen in Figure 13-8, click the option with three 
vertical dots (More. . .) and choose Settings from the menu that appears.
3.	 Click the Choose Number link.
4.	 Review the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, then click Continue.
5.	 Enter the city or area code for which you would like to get a free phone 
number. Note, this does not have to be a number in your area.
You can choose the phone number, so find one that is easy for your listeners 
to use. If you are doing a Star Trek podcast, for example a number with 8735 
(TREK) somewhere in it makes it easy for your callers to remember.

CHAPTER 13  Speaking Directly to Your Peeps      259
6.	 Click Next to link your Google voice number with your mobile number.
Be sure to enable the Do Not Disturb option for your Google Voice number. 
This will automatically take any calls going to your Google Voice number 
straight to voicemail.
7.	 Google will send you a verification code. Enter this on the screen pre-
sented and click Verify.
8.	 When the process is complete, click Finish.
You can now tell the world about an easy way to leave you a voicemail. When 
someone leaves you a message, you’ll get an email notification!
Okay, Google Voice is fine and dandy if you’re calling from the United States, but 
let’s not forget that podcasting can reach anyone anywhere. How do you get in 
touch with the listeners from Australia, South Africa, or Tierra del Fuego? You 
can encourage your international audience to leave you a voice memo through 
­Facebook Messenger or take advantage of WhatsApp. Their audio can come from 
anywhere in the world for free.
You may find yourself with so much voicemail that you’ll have to do what several 
podcasters have done and create a separate show for their listener feedback. 
­Listeners, including your authors, often get a kick out of hearing their comments 
aired before the world.

DISCORD: IT’S NOT JUST FOR GAMERS 
ANYMORE!
Jason Citron was looking to design a platform where he and his gamer friends could all 
gather to chat while gaming. In 2014, Citron and his game development studio Hammer &  
Chisel conceived the idea of Discord (www.discordapp.com) and in 2015 released their 
first desktop app to the general public. The communications platform, now available as 
a smartphone app along with the desktop client, gained popularity through eSports and 
Twitch streamers, and today hosts over nine million daily users and 200 million messages 
a day. While Discord is more associated with console gaming, podcasters can easily 
take advantage of the platform in how Discord works. Discord allows you to build a 
community, either through invitation only or public membership. By establishing a server 
on Discord, you offer one location for your listeners or viewers to meet. Once on your 
server, you and your audience can keep in touch through text channels and voice channels, 
designated by hashtags, as shown here. These channels can be (as you might imagine) 
text only or real-time audio chat. Discord offers you a unique ability to not only develop 
and build a community around your podcast but also keep the conversation rolling in 
real time either through text or as an audio forum. With the right connections and 
consent from those attending, you can record the Discord gatherings and offer them up 
as podcasts themselves. Think of these shows as feedback forums.
Discord is still new territory for podcasters. Consider this an opportunity to do some 
trailblazing.

CHAPTER 13  Speaking Directly to Your Peeps      261
Seeking Out the Comments of Others
There’s an old saying about the best-laid plans of mice and men (and how they 
often go awry). That adage can be applied quite aptly to when podcasters pick up 
a walking stick, throw a haversack over their shoulders, and proclaim, “I’m going 
on an adventure!” You see, it is a certainty that listeners of your show, both fan 
and foe, will talk about your show to others in a variety of formats and on plat-
forms of which you have absolutely no control.
There are existing forums, chat rooms, and social media threads that deal with 
your podcasting topic. At some point, those people will find out about your show 
and start listening. Current research shows these people will post reviews faster 
than Han Solo’s time in the now legendary Kessel Run. In fact, uneducated opin-
ions on the Internet stand as the only things faster than the Millennium Falcon’s 
unbroken Kessel Run record.
Welcome to the community of the Internet.
There are a variety of ways to keep your eyes and ears on these groups and to find 
comments regarding your podcast. Doing so will give you valuable, direct feed-
back from listeners and let you respond quickly and easily. But before you set off 
on that journey, consider the warnings passed on to Indiana Jones before setting 
off on an archaeological quest: Be careful what you unearth.
Whoa. Two Harrison Ford references in one section? Madness, We tell you. Madness.
Trying a general search
Is it just us, or don’t most people do a Google search for their own name at least 
twice a week? Could be just us, but that’s a great way to see whether people are 
talking about you. Google has a gazillion pages in its search database and con-
stantly crawls a good percentage of the web, finding interesting tidbits and adding 
more data with each pass.
When you search, try various combinations. If your name is a common one, such as 
John Smith, you’re probably going to get a lot of hits unrelated to you. Try adding the 
topic of your show to the search for more relevant results. For example, if your name 
is John Smith and you’re podcasting about underwater basket weaving, type John 
Smith underwater basket weaving in the Google search box. If your show name is 
unique, or at least uncommon, try using the name of your show as a search term.
We realize that there are other search engines besides Google. Yahoo! and Bing 
produce fine results, as do a few others. If you have neither the time nor the incli-
nation to experiment with a dozen search engines, we suggest these three. They 
syndicate their results to other lesser-known (but equally valid) search engines. 

262      PART 4  Start Spreadin’ the News about Your Podcast
But as we’ve said countless times before, your mileage may vary. The same tech-
niques we outline work well on just about any search engine you prefer.
Searching within a site, blog,  
or social media platform
As extensive and cool as search engines are, they can’t cover everything on the 
Net. Not only are there physical limitations as to how wide of an area the spiders 
and bots can cover, there are also self-imposed limitations set up by website own-
ers that inhibit a good indexing of the site.
Take forums, for example. Some forums are set up in a manner that renders their 
internal pages invisible to the spiders and bots of even the best engines.
But most forums have an internal search engine that you can use to find the con-
tent within the forum — though you may be required to register with the forum 
to access its search engine. Blogs, forums, and even social media platforms such 
as Twitter have search features, and the results are easy to track down, as shown 
in Figure 13-9.
FIGURE 13-9: 
With the right

CHAPTER 13  Speaking Directly to Your Peeps      263
When the Comments Are Less than Good
First, don’t panic.
Second, don’t respond. Not yet.
Third, let your blood pressure come down to a normal level.
Let’s face it. Anytime someone has any critical comments about us, we get an 
emotional reaction. We call that being human, and it’s perfectly understandable 
and impossible to suppress. Following that impulse of replying right away only 
leads you to discover the two reasons why it’s called a knee-jerk reaction: It’s a 
reflex to clashing viewpoints, and you come across like a real jerk when you don’t 
think about your response before riding the emotional roller coaster. (The classic 
wooden ones like the Rebel Yell, Beast, or Grizzly. Yeah. Roller coasters. Cool.)
When you’re calm and feeling a bit more detached, reread the comment and plan 
your course of action. Here are some suggestions:
1.	 Reflect on the comment.
What does the comment say, really? Does the person make a valid point? Is 
there an area of improvement you should make? If the comment was specific, 
relisten to the show in question. Did you say what the person said you did or 
stumble as bad as the person made it out to be? You may need a different 
perspective, so feel free to get someone else involved.
2.	 When you fully understand the criticism, decide whether you want to 
respond.
Obviously, if a comment is in any way libelous, you may want to seek legal 
counsel before proceeding. If a comment is simply pure vitriol, your best 
course may be to ignore it and go about your business.
3.	 If you decide to reply, consider sending an email.
If you send an email, count on that email being posted right alongside the 
negative comment. There’s no guarantee the person will keep your correspon-
dence private. In fact, count on the opposite. Whatever you say in a private 
email should be something you would be willing to say in a more public forum. 
Keep your rebuttal rational, civil, and, above all, professional.
Just like any argument, it’s best to keep things on a professional level with your 
words and mannerisms. Although it may be hard to not put it on a personal level, 
try to refrain. It’s not going to help the situation.

AVOID THE BAITING GAME
Tee recalls, after watching a scene in Bull Durham where an umpire goads Kevin Costner 
into insulting him, saying, “That’s so Hollywood.” His dad, a highly respected umpire in 
college and semi-pro baseball, said, “Actually, that’s not. That’s baiting. I’ve played that 
game too many times.” Although you may not think there is a common trait between 
baseball umpires and podcasters, there is: The Baiting Game.
Fast-forward to 2005 when on Tee’s podcast The Survival Guide to Writing Fantasy, he 
posted a tribute to a friend lost to breast cancer. Billed as a “Special Edition” this show 
was simply to raise awareness. An anonymous poster came on to the show’s blog and 
left a long comment that said in so many words, “We don’t care about you. We don’t 
care about your friend dying of cancer. Stick to the content of the show.” While Tee did 
not reply, his community of Survivalists did, to which the anonymous poster rebutted 
with a lot of contempt and very little reason. On his following Survival Guide, Tee asked 
the poster to stop listening if he found the show so distasteful. The anonymous poster 
returned to say, “You can’t make me stop listening . . .” and then listed other writing pod-
casts he found better than Tee’s.
At this point, Tee recognized this for The Baiting Game that it was.
There are people out there who live to pick fights. They are commonly referred to as 
Trolls. Trolls can be listeners of your podcasts or, sometimes, other podcasters looking 
for a thrill in bucking the community. A way to tell it’s The Baiting Game is to look closer 
at the criticism with (pardon the pun) a critical eye. Usually the feedback from baiting is 
comprised of personal attacks, misconstruing of facts, flawed reasoning (if there’s any 
reason present), spin control, and a healthy dose of verbal insults akin to punching 
someone in the ear and then running away. When this happens, don’t reply. Ever. By 
not replying, the words sent to you are a waste of time and effort on the sender’s part, 
not yours. Not replying isn’t a guarantee that the baiter will simply disappear. You may 
need to moderate your blog just to be sure people don’t post comments that you deem 
inappropriate.
And as you may be moderating said comments, you can continue to delete the trolls’ 
comments, and they never see the light of day.
The high road has a better view than the low. In some cases, like The Baiting Game, the 
best response is none at all.

CHAPTER 13  Speaking Directly to Your Peeps      265
Negative feedback is never an easy thing to stomach, but look at the positive 
aspect of this: People are listening. They’re listening, and now they’re most 
assuredly talking, blogging, and podcasting about you. We’re not saying to rush 
out and say something completely irrational simply to drum up controversy, but 
we’re saying that people will disagree with you now and then. It should be 
expected, and you should be ready to face that tough love when it comes your way.
More than anything, grow from the experience. Understand that anything you say 
in your podcast will be heard by a variety of people, with different backgrounds, 
experiences, and expectations of the world. We’ve been on both sides of this and 
can count many times where the negative comments we received turned out to be 
some of the best feedback. We think we’re better podcasters for it.
Feedback, good or bad, is only as constructive as you make it out to be.

Fishing for Listeners
A
s of this writing, there are hundreds of thousands of podcasters. By some 
estimates, the number of subscriptions exceeds one billion. However, that 
pales in comparison with the potential audience, which is somewhere in 
the billions of people worldwide with a broadband Internet connection. Although 
the audience is large, the options for listeners are legion. But how do you attract 
an audience to your podcast?
In this chapter, we show you a variety of options that you may want to use to help 
gain a larger listener base. Some cost money; others cost time. But using these 
options, you can expose your podcast to the right people at the right time.
Getting Your Podcast Ready for Promotion
Whether you plan on spending real money or expending real energy, you need to 
do some prep work before you start your campaign. You shouldn’t rush your pro-
motional campaigns, but take the time to carefully plan and execute them. Failure 
to do so can not only be a huge waste of time and money, but it may also result in 
turning off potential listeners to your show, making it many times more difficult 
to attract them back for a second chance.

268      PART 4  Start Spreadin’ the News about Your Podcast
Polishing your presentation
Most podcasters need a few episodes under their belts before they hit their stride. 
If you’re on podcast episode number three, you likely haven’t fleshed out your 
show. Granted, you may have been planning your podcast for months on end, or 
have previous experience behind the mic on another medium, or have nailed it 
from the beginning. If so, great. But understand you’re in the minority. And much 
like a new TV series with experienced writers, producers, and directors, experi-
enced podcasters launching a new show should consider releasing a few shows 
until that show is running like a machine.
Even though each person is different, we suggest giving yourself at least five 
full episodes to find the sweet spot. Experimentation is part of the format, so play 
with a few things along the way to see where your strengths as well as your weak-
nesses are.
Checking your bandwidth
In Chapter 3, we talk about the negative aspects of too large an audience. Each new 
listener means more of your precious bandwidth being consumed. For podcasters 
with limited bandwidth, getting more listeners can be an expensive proposition.
If you’re using the services of Liberated Syndication (http://libsyn.com) or 
another unmetered bandwidth podcast hosting company, you don’t have to worry 
about your bandwidth and can safely skip ahead to the next section. See Chapter 11 
for more information about these very affordable services.
Many podcasters start out using the standard web hosting service to host their 
podcast files and are quickly surprised when they run out of bandwidth. We’re 
more surprised about how poor their math skills are. Suppose that you have 100MB 
of monthly transfers allowed for your site. On the 10th of July, you log in to your 
bandwidth stats page and see that you’re already at 60MB for the month. Will you 
make it? Here are the formulas to figure this out:
Bandwidth consumed / number of days so far this month = Daily bandwidth rate
Daily bandwidth rate × 31 (the total number of days in the month) = Total band-
width needed
Now you plug in your numbers to find out your daily bandwidth rate:
60MB / 10 = 6MB

CHAPTER 14  Fishing for Listeners      269
You’re consuming about 6MB per day. Now multiply this number (6MB) by the 
number of days in the month (31) to get the total bandwidth you need for the 
month:
6MB × 31 = 186MB
It’s inevitable; you’re not going to stay within your 100MB limit. You will be 
roughly 86MB over your 100MB plan.
That sounds — and is — simple. As a real-world example, Chuck checked his band-
width usage on July 18 and found that he had used 256.65GB in the first 17 days.
First, he needs to find out his daily bandwidth:
256.65GB / 17 days = 15GB average daily transfer rate for July
Then, he must find out his total bandwidth for the month:
15GB × 31 days = 465GB
As you can see, he needs 465GB of bandwidth to get through the month, assuming 
his traffic stays steady and doesn’t increase. If his bandwidth ceiling was 500GB, 
he’d need to think twice before starting an advertising campaign, as he’d likely hit 
that ceiling, and his hosting provider would likely shut down access to all those 
brand-new podcast listeners he just worked so hard to get. Not a good way for 
anyone to spend his or her time.
As a good rule, you need to be using less than 50 percent of your monthly allotment 
of bandwidth before starting an advertising campaign. If you’re using any more 
than that, you’ll run out of room and will have to seek alternative hosting options 
before proceeding. We cover some of these alternative options in Chapter 11.
Figuring out your USP
USP is a marketing term, and it stands for unique selling proposition — a message 
that sells your podcast to potentials listeners. Although you probably aren’t charg-
ing money to listen to your podcast, make no mistake that you need to sell it to 
potential listeners if you’re considering advertising.
Why should a potential listener listen to your podcast? And more importantly, 
how can you, as the podcast advertiser, present a message that makes a potential 
listener want to listen?
Plenty of books, websites, seminars, and post-graduate degree programs are dedi-
cated to the subtle nuances of marketing and advertising. We’re not suggesting 

270      PART 4  Start Spreadin’ the News about Your Podcast
you go that far, obviously. But we do suggest you take a good, hard look at what 
you produce every week and come up with a concise and consistent message with 
which to promote your show.
For example, when Chuck was looking at advertising for his Technorama podcast, 
he found that the market for another tech podcast was saturated. Several dozen 
shows repurposed the same news about Microsoft, Google, and Apple. Instead, 
Chuck chose to spotlight the strange, bizarre, and unusual items that are typically 
passed via email from geek to geek  — the steam-powered Nintendo DS, the 
motorcycle that folds in to a briefcase, and who can forget the device made of 
wood that adds binary numbers. Thus, the USP for Technorama goes like this:
Technorama takes a light-hearted look at the world of tech, science, sci-fi, and all 
things geek.
Sometimes calling in help from the outside can be a good thing. Ask your friends 
and family, or even your listeners, to come up with some key points of why they 
listen to your show. We’re not talking about a catchy slogan or jingle of the sort a 
Madison Avenue marketing firm might designate as the perfect thing to attract 
new listeners, but plain English (or your language of choice) ways to tell inter-
ested folks what your show is about and why they should be listening.
We can’t give you a step-by-step outline on this one. Spend a few days on it. Try 
it out on some folks first. When you find a message that fits, you’re ready to 
­proceed on your advertising quest.
Exploring Various Advertising Options
In this section, we discuss some of the many ways you can advertise to give your 
podcast exposure to a larger audience.
Give me a boost, Facebook
With well over two billion users and growing, Facebook continues to dominate the 
social media space, so it makes sense to consider a modest financial investment to 
reach a larger group of people with hopes of converting them in to loyal listeners. 
This is the same reason you see ads for shaving razors, car batteries, or pillows to 
help you stop snoring on your Facebook timeline. Someone wants you to see what 
he or she has to offer and somewhere in your massive collection of data, you fit 
the profile — so why not turn the tables and start reaching people who fit your 
profile?

CHAPTER 14  Fishing for Listeners      271
How it works
Facebook boosts allow you to expose, for a price, your Facebook post on the time-
lines of people who don’t directly follow you or those who may have shared your 
content. The price is determined by how many people you want to reach.
For the sake of argument, let’s assume you’ve already set up a Facebook page for 
your podcast as one of the many ways you can stay in touch with your people and 
IS ADVERTISING RIGHT FOR  
YOUR PODCAST?
Before launching your advertising campaign, apply some Jurassic Park logic. In that 
movie, Jeff Goldblum’s character chastises the dinosaur-resurrecting mogul with “Your 
scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn’t stop to think 
if they should.” Good advice for podcasters and mad scientists alike.
For many, podcasting is a labor of love and not a money-making proposition. As such, 
spending too much money or time on advertising may make a passion seem a heck of a 
lot more like a job — and you probably already have one of those.
If you’re interested in making money on your podcast, you might also consider the 
Return on Investment, or ROI — oh, now we’re starting to sound like a corporation so 
bear with us a moment. Simply put, is the money you spend on advertising going to 
generate you any additional . . . anything? It doesn’t make sense to spend $5 or $5,000 
if you won’t get more . . . something — listeners, advertisers, sponsors, money — in 
return. Spending money just to spend money doesn’t sound like a lot of fun to us.
Some of the podcasts we enjoy the most, such as Dave Slusher’s Evil Genius Chronicles 
(www.evilgeniuschronicles.org), are very vocal about not advertising and not 
working toward a huge listener base. Dave makes a podcast for one person — Dave 
Slusher. If other folks hear about the podcast and decide to listen, great, so long as they 
enjoy it and don’t expect him to be something he’s not. Fame is a double-edged 
sword — even the moderate fame a popular podcaster can achieve. Before long, emails 
and voicemails are flying in with ideas, suggestions, and even mandates of how you can 
make the show better — for the listeners. Don’t forget that fan is short for fanatic, and 
fanatic people don’t always behave rationally.
Choose this path with caution. “Doing it for the love” probably means you can (and 
should) forgo advertising your podcast. It’s not a fast way to get more listeners, but it is 
a fast way to burn through money without a lot to show for it. We talk more about 
intangible returns on your investment in Chapter 15.

272      PART 4  Start Spreadin’ the News about Your Podcast
your people can stay in touch with you. As you post a new episode, you are men-
tioning it on your podcast’s Facebook page, right? But let’s say your Facebook 
page has 30 followers. It’s great that those 30 people know about your new epi-
sode, but you want to reach more, so you share it via your personal account to your 
500 followers (mostly family, friends, and co-workers) in hopes that some of 
them share it. How do you reach more people you haven’t already met to let them 
know? That’s where Facebook helps. It allows you to boost a post for a few dollars 
and define whom you wish to target.
Boost a post containing your episode, not your page. People will be more inter-
ested in hearing your breakthrough research on stopping telomere breakdown to 
extend a cell’s lifespan than just knowing about your science research show.
Using the service
You should have no problem finding your post to boost. Facebook practically 
pushes it in your face when you view your own timeline. Chuck found it odd at first 
to see Technorama ads with his latest episode on his timeline. This is Facebook’s 
subtle way of increasing the likelihood of him paying for a boost. Very clever! Then 
Chuck looked closely at the top of the ad and noticed the text Only you can see 
this preview until you run this ad and a blue button at the bottom that says 
Boost Post.
Save your “boost budget” for your special shows. Like most podcasters, you are 
working on a budget and want to save it for when it really matters. If you do a 
music podcast and just landed a spectacular interview with Alice Cooper, that’s a 
good candidate to boost!
When you click the Boost Post button a window pops up, as shown in Figure 14-1.
Facebook gives you a few ways to choose your target audience for your ad:
»
» When you click the option for People you choose you choose through 
targeting, you’ll also notice an Edit button that allows you to pick specific 
genders, age range, locations, and topics of interest. Think of the topics of 
interest as your way to match keyword searches with people. If you just did an 
episode with a noted independent horror film director, you might include 
things like Independent movies, horror movies, movies, and other related 
items that might capture the interest of Facebook users.
»
» The option People who like your page doesn’t sound like it’s going to get you 
anything more than people who already like your page and are likely to see 
your content, but thanks to Facebook’s magical algorithms, it also targets 
people who like other pages similar to yours.

CHAPTER 14  Fishing for Listeners      273
»
» People who like your page and their friends lets you place your ad not only 
one the timeline of people who already follow your page, but their friends as 
well. It’s almost like paying everyone to share your link for you — does that 
make you feel dirty too?
»
» And the final option: Create a new audience is similar to the first option, but 
you can create groupings of targets to save and use on multiple ads. This is 
handy if your show has a variety of topics on a regular basis. Let’s say you do a 
science podcast, you might set up one grouping that targets people interested 
in space exploration, NASA, and Mars, while another ad would be better 
targeted to DNA, gene sequencing, and genetic mutations. That way when you 
finish that interview with the rocket technician, you can target the right group 
and repurpose that group weeks or months later when you air the tour at JPL.
Of course, there’s always the subject of money. How many people can you reach 
and how long do you run the ad? Fortunately, you can choose a budget that works 
for you starting with just a few dollars and running for as little as a day. The more 
you spend, the larger potential audience you can reach. The longer you run the ad, 
the more it will cost you. The pop-up window has a special section that helps you 
calculate the cost before you commit. No surprises here that will force you in to a 
second mortgage, thank goodness.
Finally, there’s the method of payment. Facebook makes this pretty easy by taking 
credit or debit cards, PayPal, and online banking accounts. Pretty straightforward.
FIGURE 14-1: 
The Facebook 
Boost Post 
feature lets you 
target Facebook

interests that

show’s content.

274      PART 4  Start Spreadin’ the News about Your Podcast
Be sure to read the Facebook Advertising Policy (https://www.facebook.com/
policies/ads) before launching your campaign. Yes, it’s a lot of text, but it can 
save you from nasty surprises that get your ad rejected. Chuck discovered this his 
first time out when he learned that images on boosted posts must not contain 
more than 20% text (see Figure 14-2).
While Facebook is a major player in social media, this may change over time. 
We  encourage you to look in to other avenues for ad campaigns including: 
Blogads  (http://web.blogads.com) and Project Wonderful (http://project 
wonderful.com).
Insta-traffic with Instagram
In the Chapter 13, we walk you through the process of switching your Instagram 
profile from a personal account to a business profile. With a business profile, you 
can offer your listeners and viewership quick and easy access to your podcast’s 
email and voicemail.
Now we’re going to show you exactly how you can do business on your Instagram 
business profile.
In 2016, Instagram — with a lot of help from its parent company, Facebook — 
offered to business account holders the option to boost Instagram posts. This 
meant you could easily take one of your images and turn it into a sponsored post, 
meaning you could reach beyond your own network and reach Instagrammers 
that you may not be following who share interests relevant to your podcast.
When you activate your (free) business profile, Instagram connects to either a 
Facebook account or a Facebook Page that you manage. Along with the option to 
go to a profile and tap a Contact button, all your posts will offer you the option to 
promote that post. When you promote a post, your Instagram post — the image 
and its accompanying text  — appears in feeds of audiences you target. If this 
sounds a lot like what happens when boosting Facebook posts, it’s because you are 
working with the same audiences you are building with Facebook.
FIGURE 14-2: 
Facebook has 
specific rules 
around the 
format and 
content of 
your ad.

CHAPTER 14  Fishing for Listeners      275
And promoting a post on Instagram is just as easy as on Facebook:
1.	 Launch your Instagram app.
Your Instagram business account must be activated to complete these steps. 
See Chapter 13 for the steps for how to do so.
2.	 Create a post pertaining to your podcast, or find a post about your 
podcast in your Instagram profile.
3.	 Tap the blue Promote button.
4.	 From the options offered, tap Visit your website to set this promotion for 
a specific episode.
This is called an Action Item. What do you want your audience to do when they 
see your ad? Most of the time, you will want your audience to visit a URL.
5.	 Tap the Shop Now option associated with the Action Button option. 
Select Learn More as your button.
6.	 Select your Audience, either from audiences you have built in Facebook, 
walking through steps to build your own audience, or having Instagram 
do it for you.
When you have synced your Instagram business account with a Facebook 
Page, any audiences you have built there that you have previously advertised 
to will automatically carry over to Instagram.
7.	 Scroll down to set your Total Budget and Duration for this ad campaign, 
then tap Next in the upper-right corner of your Instagram app.
8.	 Tap the Shop Now option associated with the Action Button option. 
Select Learn More as your button.
9.	 You can now review your order at this screen and enter a payment 
method. The ad campaign can be previewed here (as shown in Figure 14-3) 
or submitted for review by tapping Promote in the upper-right corner.
After you send your Instagram post, your post is reviewed by Instagram (just as 
Facebook does when you boost a post there), and you are notified when a promo-
tion goes live. Instagram will then keep running analytics on your post, keeping 
you informed regarding how much traffic you are seeing, what your CTR (click-
through rate) is, and how much remains in your budget.
When you set up a boosted Facebook post, you are given an option to also simul-
taneously run a boosted post on Instagram, provided the post you are boosting is 
an image that supports the image’s resolution. Make sure you use an image that 
looks good on a laptop as well as a smartphone.

276      PART 4  Start Spreadin’ the News about Your Podcast
Instagram’s analytics on a boosted post, you will notice, are kept separate from 
the analytics you collect on the original post. In other words, you will see that 
some people liking your boosted Instagram post do not add numbers to the origi-
nal post. This is Instagram’s way of keeping organic traffic separate from paid 
traffic. Once again, it falls on you to decide, based on your budget, whether the 
number of people you reach is worthwhile Do you run the ad longer? Do you try a 
different demographic? Presently, Instagram’s budget suggestions for posts are 
modest, if not humble. Choose a budget that works for you, starting with just a 
few dollars a day and having it run for a week. As with Facebook, the larger your 
budget and the longer you run it, the larger your potential audience.
Regardless if you are using the Promote option or simply using Instagram to pro-
mote your podcast, consider the accompanying post and your Profile’s URL. As we 
mention earlier, you cannot make active links in Instagram (yet). Before posting 
your show’s art or image related to your episode, go into your Instagram profile 
and paste the URL of your latest episode into your featured URL field. Once you 
have the episode’s URL in place (see Figure 14-4), compose a post with “Visit the 
URL in our Instagram’s profile . . .” somewhere in there. This way, people can 
reach your podcast through Instagram easily.
FIGURE 14-3: 
Before you 
submit an 
Instagram post 
for review, you 
are given a 
chance to 
review your  
order before 
making it live.

CHAPTER 14  Fishing for Listeners      277
Boosting on Instagram is still a relatively new option for Instagrammers, and at 
the time of this edition, the hard and fast rule Facebook adheres to that images on 
boosted posts must not contain more than 20% text does not apply to Instagram 
posts. This is subject to change but presently show art like the one in Figure 14-3 
is more than okay to use, provided it is at a good resolution like 600 x 600, for 
example.
Writing press releases
Some podcasters have had enormous success attracting new listeners with press 
releases. When you release a press release, it’s available to be picked up by a vari-
ety of news sources. On the positive side, you have a lot of room inside a press 
release to talk about your show. On the negative, you have no guarantee of who — 
if anyone — will pick up and run your press release.
Writing an effective press release is a true art form. It must appeal both to 
the managing editor of the publication considering your release, as well as being 
worthwhile reading to John Q. Public.
FIGURE 14-4: 
Dropping the

a way to reach 
your podcast 
through the app.

278      PART 4  Start Spreadin’ the News about Your Podcast
Here are some ideas to help you write a good press release:
»
» Hook them early. This is also known as B.L.U.F. — stating your bottom line 
up front. Whatever you have to say, be sure to say it first and grab their 
attention.
»
» Tell a story. Your press release should convey a condensed version of what 
it is you want to say. Three or four paragraphs made up of two or three 
sentences each is a good guideline to follow. Try to answer the most common 
questions people will have about your announcement. Start with the basics of 
good journalism — who, what, when, where, and why.
»
» Target the press release. Write the press release suitable to your target 
audience. You will likely have to write more than one version — and send your 
story to those likely to run it. A story about “hometown boy writes successful 
book on podcasting” is more likely to get published in the college alumni school 
paper than USA Today.
»
» Give the tag line. Use your USP. This is the perfect place to give someone 
that 30-second pitch about your show.
»
» Give some quotes. Include a couple lines from the people involved. Keep 
them positive and upbeat.
»
» Provide appropriate URLs. Don’t forget to provide links to your site(s). This 
should go without saying, but sometimes you may get so wrapped up in the 
wording of the press release that you forget the point of the press release —  
to get people to come to your site and try the content.
We recommend reading several press releases to get a feeling for the marketing 
aspect.
If you know people who have written press releases in the past, see if they can 
lend some help  — if not, reach out. Remember that podcasting can be a very 
­helpful network.
PR Newswire
PR Newswire (http://prnewswire.com) is the cream of the crop when it comes to 
online and offline distribution of your press release. PR Newswire can send your 
press release to thousands of media outlets, ranging from newsprint, radio, web-
sites, television, and more.
The company also provides editorial services for your press release, as well as tips 
and tricks on how to write an effective release that’s more likely to get results. If 
you’re serious about getting the maximum exposure to your show and are 

CHAPTER 14  Fishing for Listeners      279
thinking about using a press release as part of your strategy, PR Newswire is 
worth considering.
However, many independent podcasters may find the cost prohibitive (around 
$300 to start) and the registration process somewhat daunting. In a world where 
online registration and upfront disclosure is commonplace, PR Newswire follows 
a more traditional approach. Gaining access requires you to contact your local 
bureau either via email (information@prnewswire.com) or by telephone.
PRWeb
Considerably less archaic is PRWeb (http://prweb.com). This organization offers 
paid and donation-based services, and it boasts of a good number of media out-
lets. The main difference between the two organizations (other than cost and the 
hassle-factor) is the quality of the distribution. PRWeb works to put your press 
release in front of thousands of online media outlets. Offline media sources may 
subscribe as well, but the primary distribution is online.
Not that that is a bad thing. After all, your podcast is an online service, and you’re 
likely most effective reaching an audience who is already online. Both of us have 
had various write-ups in both online and offline media, and we’ve always received 
more traffic and attention to our websites from the online sources.
We don’t want to make PRWeb sound somehow inferior to the traditional sources 
of press release distribution. Far from it. Although the service may not be as full 
featured, it can still be a great way to get your word out, and one that is quite cost 
effective.
For $99, PRWeb distributes your press release (among many other things) in 
search engines and news sites. Additionally, press releases at this level are 
reviewed by the PRWeb editorial team, providing valuable feedback on ways to 
make your press release more meaningful and more likely to be picked up by 
­various other news organizations around the Internet.
Promoting Your Podcast
Before you start throwing money toward an advertising campaign, consider all the 
things you can do to spread the word about your podcast that don’t require a 
financial investment. In fact, you probably should be doing these things even if 
you plan on tossing out some cash for effect.

Optimizing your site for search engines
In Chapter 12, we give you several tips on how you can make show notes more 
appealing to search engines. You can employ similar methods to your entire web-
site so that it receives the maximum exposure and visibility to search engines.
For more information on optimizing your site, we highly recommend SEO For 
Dummies by Peter Kent (published by Wiley) and Search Engine Optimization All-in- 
One for Dummies by Bruce Clay (Wiley) Additionally, Cre8asite Forums at http://
cre8asiteforums.com is an invaluable discussion board to keep up on the latest 
techniques on keeping your website search engine friendly.
Submitting promos to other podcasts
Podcasting has been called by some to be a great hall of mirrors, as it seems that 
many podcasts spend at least some portion of their time talking about . . . other 
podcasts!
We think this feeling of community adds to the distinctiveness that is podcasting, 
and something that is, for the most part, accepted by the general podcasting audi-
ence. The podcasting landscape isn’t shrinking anytime soon, and it’s so fractured 
that many listeners are looking for their favorite podcasters to help steer them 
toward other podcasts they may find interesting.
Not all podcasters do this. In fact, most corporate podcasts must see other pod-
casts as competition and are as likely to talk about another podcast as a traditional 
broadcaster is to talk about another station across town. Even some of the inde-
pendent podcasters make a point not to talk about other podcasts, simply because 
they don’t want to add to the hall of mirrors effect.
One of the more widespread ways podcasters talk about other podcasters is 
with promos. A promo is a short (or long) audio clip that describes your show. 
Other podcasters then insert this clip into their shows — play it on the air so to 
speak — thereby presenting your message to their subscribed and downloading 
audiences.
Promos are a great way to let other folks know your podcast exists. Spend some 
time listening to other podcasts and see whether they’re playing promos. When 
you find one that does, see what the average time for the promotion turns out to 
be and what type of content is being presented. Is it all serious business, or is 
more lighthearted humor involved? Query other podcasts and offer up your promo. 

CHAPTER 14  Fishing for Listeners      281
In exchange, offer to make a promo for your host podcast. Some podcasters are 
good at making promos and even offer to make promos for free for other 
podcasters.
One final note on sending out promos: Ask. Unless the show specifically says, 
“Submit your promos to us at . . . ,” be a good podcasting citizen and send the 
podcaster a note asking whether she’d like to run your promo. Requests that start 
off with “I listen to your show every week because you . . .” are likely to get a 
­better response than those starting (and ending) with “Please run my promo.” 
Consider taking a reverse approach, as well. If you listen to a podcast and want to 
run her promo on your show, ask if she has a promo and offer to play it. Most 
podcasters are more than happy to contribute.
Recording your promo
Recording your own promo isn’t difficult, and we tend to enjoy the ones that come 
from the voice of the podcaster. You’ve done the hard work by figuring out what 
makes your podcast special; now you need to sit down and record your promo. 
Here are a few tips:
»
» Write your script. Or don’t. Some folks are happy flying off the cuff. But in 
the interest of time, we highly recommend putting some thoughts down on 
paper and running through them out loud to see how long it takes. Most 
promos are under a minute long, unless you have lots of great stuff to say.
»
» Add effects and music from your podcast. If you use the same music (see 
Chapter 8) in your show each week or have some special sound effects that 
brand the show as yours, include them in your promo. Effects are a great way 
to tie in your promotion to your show, assuring new listeners that they have 
subscribed to the right place.
»
» Don’t forget your website URL! Too many podcasters provide the link to 
their podcast feed. Useless, in our opinions. Instead, repeat the URL of your 
website, where it should be painfully simple to subscribe to the RSS feed for 
your podcast. Now here’s to hoping you picked an easy-to-remember domain 
name!
»
» Include a link to the promo on your website. Recording one and sending it 
out to a few podcasts is great, but what about all the other folks you inspire to 
make their own podcast? Chances are good that if you put a link to your 
promo file on your website, others will grab that file and include your promo 
in their shows. It’s also a good repository for when you find another podcast 
you think might want to run your promo.

282      PART 4  Start Spreadin’ the News about Your Podcast
»
» Speak clearly and enunciate! You may know the name of your show very 
well. Like your own name, you’ve said it “millions” of times. This means you 
might say it so quickly, it may not come out as clearly as it should. When you 
introduce your show to someone who has never heard the show name 
before, you need to slow down a bit. Say your podcast’s title as if you are 
introducing yourself to someone new. Let him hear the words clearly. While 
doing research for this book, we listened to several promos where the 
podcaster said it so fast that it reminded us of those misheard lyrics in a song. 
Was that Jimmy Hendrix podcast actually called “Kiss this guy dot com”? If it 
weren’t for a printed URL, we would have no idea what the show was called or 
where to find it.
When you send other podcasters your promo, save some email bandwidth 
and send the link that’s on your website, rather than the file itself.
Giving interviews
Don’t forget that podcasting is the fastest growing medium we’ve seen . . . ever! If 
your podcast covers a brand-new area of the world or addresses an underserved 
market, folks are out there who want to talk with you about it.
Contact the publications, radio shows, websites, and other outlets that cover the 
industry your podcast falls under. Send them your press release, along with a per-
sonalized note telling them about your show and stating that you’re happy to do 
an interview.
Interviews can be done in person, but most today are conducted over the phone or 
online phone services like Skype. A handful are conducted via email. Preparing for 
an interview can make the difference between a poor interview that never sees 
publication or airtime and a well-delivered interview that keeps the audience —  
as well as the interviewer — engaged and entertained.
Here are a few tips to make your interview go swimmingly:
»
» Eliminate the BS factor. If you have only a passing interest in the subject for 
which you’re trying to pass yourself off as an expert, you’ll quickly be discov-
ered, thrashed repeatedly, and left out for the buzzards. The people who are 
interviewing you likely are already experts in their fields, so don’t try to come 
off as something you aren’t. Be open and honest about your experience and 
focus on why you’re doing the podcast. Even if you’re considered a subject 
matter expert, remember that your listener may not be. You might want to 
consider simplifying things on behalf of the listeners new to the subject. Of 
course, this depends on your listeners and the subject being covered.

CHAPTER 14  Fishing for Listeners      283
»
» Mention your website again and again. Remember that the listeners, 
readers, or viewers you are being interviewed in front of have no idea who 
you are and what you are about. This is your chance to sell yourself and 
your podcast. If your interviewer is good, he’ll give you ample opportunity to 
mention your website and podcast. If not, it’s up to you. Look for chances 
to drop the name and URL if necessary.
»
» Stay positive. If the interviewer knows anything about podcasting, he’ll likely 
ask questions on the future of podcasting, the death of radio, amateur versus 
professional, and all sorts of other controversial topics. Unless your podcast is 
about podcasting, we recommend rising above the din. This conversation 
doesn’t serve you or the listening/reading/viewing audience well. Point out 
how your podcast addresses the issue and resist the temptation to get into 
an argument. Unless your podcast is about arguing with interviewers; in that 
case, go right ahead.
Generating buzz
All the processes we outline in this chapter are geared toward one thing: generat-
ing buzz for your podcast. The more folks you can get talking about your show, the 
better off you are. We don’t buy the “any publicity is good publicity” line, but we 
do think that “Hey have you heard about . . .?” conversations among real people 
are the best form of advertising you can get.
Sometimes, you need to take the message to the masses. Find a discussion group 
or an online forum germane to your podcast’s area of interest and start posting.
When you post, don’t start out with “Hey, I’m new to the group and have this 
great podcast!” Instead, listen in to the conversation, comment on a few threads, 
and get folks used to your voice before you hit them with the come-listen-to-my-
podcast pitch. In fact, the best way to pitch your podcast is to never utter those 
words at all. Instead, offer up things like “Last week on my podcast, I covered the 
very thing you were talking about, Jill.” It shows you’re paying attention to the 
conversation and not just looking to spam a newsgroup or mailing list with your 
podcast URL.
A very fine line exists between tasteful self-promotion and outright spamming. 
Generating buzz isn’t the same as advertising. Advertising has its place, but most 
forums don’t welcome it. If you can’t decide whether your post contains too much 
advertising or not, it probably does. Discretion is the better part of valor, in this 
instance.

Show Me the Money
T
hroughout this book, we show you novel and interesting ways to toss 
­significant amount of coinage into the proverbial black hole of podcasting. 
Throwing money at your podcast can easily become a habit  — and it 
likely  should come with a warning from the Surgeon General or perhaps your 
accountant.
Hosting fees, bandwidth overages, shiny new microphones, music royalties and 
licensing fees, phone charges, travel expenses . . . the hard and soft costs of this 
little hobby of yours just might add up quickly.
That’s why this chapter shows you some ways to offset a portion (or all) of these 
costs and perhaps even add a few dollars to your pocket while you explore your 
newfound passion. In case you anticipate a large following, we cover some ideas 
you can use to make this your paying gig.
Being a podcaster is a lot like being an actor, a writer, or a movie star. A few select 
individuals may make it big, but most folks just get by — and that can be okay. If 
you’re reading this chapter first in hopes of getting a crash course in how to get 
rich quick with your podcast, you’re about to be disappointed. If not, we can talk.

288      PART 5  Pod-sibilities to Consider for Your Show
How Much Money Can You Make?
Most podcasters fall into one of three categories in terms of their audience size: 
small, medium, and large (well, yeah). Because of the very low barrier-to-entry — 
in effect, almost anyone can create a podcast — the smaller variety of podcaster 
will likely make up the bulk of the community for the foreseeable future.
Here’s a closer look at the moneymaking opportunities for these three podcast 
categories:
»
» Small: Roughly, a small podcast has under 1,000 listeners. Having a small 
audience size doesn’t exclude you from drawing a revenue stream from your 
podcast. It likely limits the size of your potential revenues, but it doesn’t mean 
you can’t bring in at least some income.
Small is a relative term, and we’re not about to start tossing out audience-size 
statistics to draw a clear demarcation between small and medium. Small is 
also not a derogatory term; many podcasters enjoy the idea of keeping their 
community intimate. There’s a certain comfort in the small podcasts, a charm 
that some would say is diminished as the size of the podcast’s audience 
increases. Small can be an asset — some podcasts are so niche that they draw 
a small, but extremely loyal following. To a potential advertiser, you have a 
target audience.
»
» Medium: When you have more than a handful of dedicated listeners (in the 
four-digit bracket with over 1,000 listeners), you find yourself in the medium 
category. This category affords you additional opportunities. For instance, 
corporations and advertisers may be more willing to consider placing ads or 
providing sponsorships.
However, you also find yourself in a more competitive marketplace, as other 
podcasters start fishing for monies to help offset their costs. Stepping upward 
in the ranks also means stepping up your game, and you may find yourself in 
an unfamiliar place — trying to develop a media kit that boosts your podcast 
above the din raised by all the other podcasts chasing the very same 
advertisers.
Creating an effective media kit, especially for a newly discovered marketplace 
such as podcasting, is a pretty important task. (For more about the why, what, 
and how-to, see “Developing a media kit,” later in this chapter.) We highly 
recommend Paul Cooligan’s The Podcast Report (http://thepodcastreport.
com) to anyone looking for ideas and ways to make your podcast into a 
money-making venture along with making your podcast more visible through 
SEO and promotional strategies.

podcasters who occupy the large category and are in the five-digit bracket 

CHAPTER 15  Show Me the Money      289
with over 10,000 listeners. When it comes to making money with your 
podcast, size really does matter. With a huge audience base, you’ll likely find 
advertisers a lot easier to approach; you can present listener numbers that 
are more like what the advertisers are used to seeing in their more traditional 
media buys.
Outside the mainstream media (like NPR, CNN, and ESPN), there aren’t that 
many large podcasts out there — yet — so thus far the playing field is still 
fairly open. Still, it’s no picnic for large podcasters; after all, they’re still 
targeting a very narrow audience on typically one topic (or show), and they 
probably won’t rake in as much as a nationally syndicated radio program. 
Don’t be surprised, however, if you see that paradigm change. Podcasters 
have much more flexibility than broadcasters and arguably a closer relation-
ship with the audience.
DOES YOUR PODCAST NEED  
TO PAY FOR ITSELF?
“You spent how much on a new microphone?” You’ll soon be hearing that or a question 
just like it with a different gizmo attached to the question mark. Your non-podcasting 
friends, colleagues, and perhaps even family will gaze in wonder at your apparent lack of 
good judgment as you seemingly spend money as if it grew on trees — trees we say!  — 
adding just one more piece to your previously professed “perfect” podcasting setup.
How can you, in good conscience, justify this outlay of cash without the financial backing 
of someone else? Surely if no one is willing to pay you to do this podcasting thing, you 
shouldn’t be doing it at all, right?
In a word, wrong.
Let’s take a hypothetical, yet not atypical, household scenario — the family that likes 
camping. They’ve got their initial investment of tents, stove, sleeping bags, perhaps 
RV or pop-up trailer, maybe an ATV or two. For those of us who prefer podcasting, 
even a high-end, mic, mixer, mic boom, pop-filter, and some cables are a lot cheaper! 
Then there’s the ongoing expenses. The camping family has campsite fees, vehicle 
maintenance — those ATVs don’t fix themselves — food, fuel, park permits, and if we 
did more camping we could come up with a few others. The podcaster has hosting fees 
which we’re pretty sure are a lot easier on the budget than vehicle maintenance. Don’t 
even get us started about how much space it takes to store a canoe compared to an 
iPad! We’re sure you can think of several other hobbies/passions to do this little 
exercise.
(continued)

290      PART 5  Pod-sibilities to Consider for Your Show
Now back to the camping-loving family . . . ask them, “Have you ever thought about get-
ting sponsorship to help pay for your love of the great outdoors?” The look on their 
faces would be priceless — you might want to have your camera ready. Just because 
you love to podcast doesn’t mean you need a sponsor.
Think of the amount of money you spend eating out each week. Or for movie tickets, 
theater presentations, concerts, and/or bar tabs. These are things you love and enjoy, 
not things you’re trying to find others to pay for. Most podcasters will spend no more 
than a hundred bucks a month on their show — average over time — and that’s stretch-
ing it. And for such a small investment that has such a high personal payoff . . . do you 
need to be paid off in cold hard cash to do it?
(continued)
Convincing Advertisers to Give You Money
If the idea of begging for money sounds rather repulsive, good. If you have to 
resort to begging, you shouldn’t be asking at all. People will only part with their 
cash if you give them a compelling reason. “Because I’m a poor podcaster” is not 
a compelling reason.

CHAPTER 15  Show Me the Money      291
Whether your goal is to gain sponsors or sell advertising spots, you must answer 
a very important question: What’s in it for them? Why should someone else make 
a financial contribution to your show? There are a multitude of good reasons that 
you’ll need to uncover, understand, and be able to explain if you hope to be suc-
cessful in asking for funds to support your podcast.
Contrary to popular belief, there aren’t nearly enough corporations so bursting- 
at-the-seams with unused advertising dollars that they’ll welcome you with open 
arms when you approach them and ask, “Hey! Wanna advertise on my podcast?”
Most corporations have an advertising budget (as in, a limit on what they can 
spend). In nearly all circumstances, this budget is significantly smaller than the 
range of potential places they might be advertising — so they’re looking for the 
most bang for their buck. As one of the would-be venues for their ads, you’re 
competing with other forms of media — including outlets that already have well- 
established pitches and presentations at the ready.
Before you start cold-calling possible advertisers, do a little homework. Spend some 
time, energy, and money developing something your potential advertisers can 
touch and see: a media kit and a rate sheet, which we describe in the next sections.
Sometimes all you can do is put your best foot forward and make your pitch. Talk 
to the advertiser about your dedicated audience, and how loyal it is to your show. 
Breaking down the costs into per-listener numbers might help as well. Whatever 
your approach, don’t try to compare your numbers with those of traditional out-
lets the advertiser is already working with. Instead, talk about how adding podcast 
advertising to the mix can enhance its current efforts, allowing the company to 
reach an audience that has turned away from traditional media sources in favor of 
this new medium.
Developing a media kit
A media kit is, in effect, a collection of marketing tools designed to awaken poten-
tial advertisers to their crying need to shell out big bucks to support your product 
or service (in this case, your podcast). The size of your media kit depends on many 
factors, among which are how much you want to spend and how much important 
stuff you think you have to say. It’s not size you’re striving for here; it’s a compel-
ling argument that you can present to your potential advertisers.
Media kits are most certainly not one size fits all. Your media kit should be repre-
sentative of the actual feeling you try to produce on your podcast — competent 
and real, not over-the-top glitzy. Consider it like a job interview: It’s okay to comb 
your hair and put on a fresh shirt, but you wouldn’t send your good-looking-but- 
ignorant roommate as a stand-in, would you? Know how to clearly communicate 
what your podcast is all about and how it would benefit a potential sponsor.

292      PART 5  Pod-sibilities to Consider for Your Show
The big fish are very well armed in this pond. Large media outlets tend to have 
large media kits that were developed with the assistance of large advertising 
agencies that charged large sums of money for their expertise. The small- to 
mid-size podcaster need not go this far. You need something more than just a 
burned CD of your latest episode.
So, here’s a practical list of dos and don’ts to keep in mind when considering what 
to put in your media kit.
First off, the “Yes, go for it” list:
»
» Include accurate listener statistics. Well, as accurate as you can, anyway. 
Include the total number of subscribers to your podcast feed; estimate how 
many direct downloads an episode of your show attracts. If your podcast is 
seeing great growth, include a chart that shows the increasing numbers. (For 
more about listener statistics, see the handy nearby sidebar, “Can you ever 
really know the size of your audience?”)
»
» Display your show schedule. If you update your podcast several times a 
week or once a month, include a calendar or schedule of when your updates 
happen. If your show has no set schedule, be prepared to explain your 
methodology of updates. Many advertisers expect some sort of consistency 
(read: reliable exposure) from the places their ads are running.
»
» Provide demographic information. Some advertisers want to know the 
general make-up of your audience. The more detailed you can get, the better. 
At a minimum, show a breakdown of gender, age range, and household income 
level. These statistics can be difficult to gather, but doing so increases your 
chances with many advertisers. Consider asking listeners to take a voluntary 
survey. If you ask your listeners to take a survey, it never hurts to offer them an 
incentive. Perhaps one lucky random survey taker wins a $50 Amazon gift card. 
There are many sites like http://surveymonkey.com that cost a few dollars — 
remember sometimes you have to spend money to make money.
»
» Showcase your popularity. If you get 50 comments on each of your show 
note entries, talk about it. Technorati (http://technorati.com) and Google 
(www.google.com) can support any claims for the popularity of your site. Print 
any great testimonials showing your knowledge and expertise in the field. 
Favorable comments from other known experts go a long way, too!
»
» Provide a sample CD or USB flash drive of your show. You can, in your kit’s 
literature, provide a link where people can sample the “Best of . . .” reel, but do 
not count on that initiative. With a press kit, you do want to make the best 
impression you can. That means you take initiative and offer media that 
already has your show burned on it. CDs are the easiest media to do this with, 
but as many computers are side-stepping the need for a CD player, consider 
USB flash drives as part of your kit. As these are podcasts and only a few 

CHAPTER 15  Show Me the Money      293
episodes sampled (no more than five in their entirety), you do not necessarily 
need flash drives larger than 1GB. This means money in your budget to get 
these drives branded with your show title and URL, if possible.
And in the “No, no, a thousand times no” corner, we have . . .
»
» Don’t artificially inflate your statistics. Grandmother always used to say 
that lies just cause you to make bigger lies. Eventually you find yourself with 
an advertiser who wants you to explain how you came up with your numbers. 
Make sure you can support your claims.
»
» Don’t use terminology without really understanding what you’re talking 
about. Marketing and advertising professionals have a vocabulary all their 
own. ROI. Conversions. CTR. Maybe you do know what these mean; but if you 
don’t, peppering your media kit with these terms is dangerous. For example, 
say you look at your numbers in Google Analytics and discover that an episode 
you promoted received over 10,000 impressions. You then proclaim, “My 
podcast has earned over 10,000 impressions!” to potential advertisers. An 
impressive stat, but what does that mean? It means that someone has clicked 
on a link to watch or listen to your podcast, and that Google was able to look at 
the network of where that click originated from and calculate how many people 
potentially saw or heard your episode. In other words, ten people with 1,000 
followers each clicked on the link leading to your episode. That’s 10,000 
impressions. Welcome to the Doublespeak of Digital Marketing.
»
» Don’t offer reduced pricing. Unless you have been podcasting for a couple 
years, and you likely haven’t had time to put things on sale yet. Pick a price 
you’re comfortable with and justify why it’s worth it. If you’re not sure of a 
starting price, ask other podcasters. Avoid discounting right off the bat; it 
implies that you’re over-valuing your product. You can always negotiate the 
price, but don’t try that in a media kit. We talk about putting together a rate 
sheet in the following section.
»
» Don’t include a copy of your entire podcast season on CD, USB flash 
drive, or online. People like to know what they’re getting themselves into. 
You have a great opportunity to offer that courtesy to potential advertisers — 
to let them listen enough to sample the wares. Remember, however, that 
their time is limited. You may include entire episodes if you like, but as 
mentioned earlier you may find better success by stitching together a “Best of” 
reel from your show instead of a full season of your podcast. Select shows, or 
even highlights from your favorite episodes, take less time to consume.
»
» Don’t make a halfhearted effort. Okay, you don’t have to create a full-blown 
presentation that would make the mavens of Madison Avenue envious of 
your skill set. But we’re not talking Elmer’s glue and crayons here, either. Treat 
it like a business; invest the right kind of time and money to make your media 
kit look (and sound) as professional as you can.

294      PART 5  Pod-sibilities to Consider for Your Show
When you have your content figured out, go buy a nice, pretty binder. Or better 
yet, order some custom ones online that feature your podcast logo, slogan, and 
website address. You can get them online from VistaPrint (www.vistaprint.com) 
if you want large quantities. For smaller runs, see what your local office-supply or 
copy center can provide.
Establishing a rate sheet
A rate sheet is simply a table of what you charge for ads and other services — this 
could include things like audio or graphic production. And you thought you were 
headed into uncharted waters by just creating a podcast? How about figuring out 
a fair price to charge for running advertising? That’s by no means a science. Heck, 
it’s not even an art form at this stage! It’s total guesswork — picking a number, 
throwing it out there, and seeing what sticks.
CAN YOU EVER REALLY KNOW  
THE SIZE OF YOUR AUDIENCE?
Tracking down listener statistics is elusive — and that’s quite an understatement. Although 
many of the podcasting pundits will tell you how important understanding your audience 
size is (especially when you’re trying to attract advertisers and sponsors), it’s difficult for 
them to agree on the best way to snag those numbers.
Web server analysis tools are wholly unreliable in this regard; after all, they weren’t 
designed for this purpose. They can tell you how many times your podcast episodes 
were requested, but not how many of those requests were successful, and if successful, 
how many of those downloads were listened to. They can tell you how many times your 
RSS 2.0 file was accessed, but they provide no tool to filter out requests made every five 
minutes by the same obsessed podcatcher.
The most widely used model of determining audience size is the bandwidth-division 
method. This requires you, the podcaster, to know two pieces of data: the average size of 
your podcast media files and the total amount of data transferred in each month. For 
example, suppose your ISP reported that you transferred 350GB of data in the month of 
May. Convert that to MB by multiplying by 1,024 (the numbers of megabytes in a giga-
byte) to get 358,400MB of data transfer.
Okay, suppose that during that month, you put up four podcasts, each with a size of 
10MB. Divide the total number of transfers (358,400) by the average size of your file 
(10MB) to get the total number of accesses to that file — in this case 35,840. Finally, 

CHAPTER 15  Show Me the Money      295
You can start by reviewing rates of other podcasts  — hopefully podcasts with 
similar topics or audience sizes. Ask them for their media kits and rate sheets — if 
they are separate items.
A rate sheet can be as simple as a fixed price for a given ad segment — we like to 
think podcasting is more flexible than that. Can you offer cheaper prices for 
shorter ads? Can you offer prices for different placement within the show, keeping 
in mind that the closer to the top of the show, the more valuable the ad place-
ment? You can offer decreasing rates based on how many shows carry an ad. How 
about giving better pricing if there’s an ad in your show along with a link on your 
website? Are you capable of offering production services for an audio or video ad? 
These options can be combined in a variety of ways to complement each other.
Getting a Sponsor
Sponsorship and advertising are often used as interchangeable terms, but they’re 
distinct approaches with different requirements. For the purposes of this discus-
sion, we consider sponsorship as a relationship you (the podcaster) have worked 
divide that number by the total number of podcast media files released (4, in this case). 
The answer (in theory, at least): You have approximately 8,960 listeners to your show.
This number, however, does not consider the data transferred by your web server 
simply to run your website — say, images and text. Nor is it helpful when your podcast 
media files vary widely in size. And it still doesn’t factor in those folks who downloaded 
90 percent of your show before the connection broke.
That is not to say developers are not trying to come up with a better system. At the time of 
writing and editing this edition of Podcasting For Dummies, Apple is offering a new Podcasts 
app for the upcoming iOS 11 for iPhone and iPad. Along with a complete overhaul of how 
podcasts are organized and consumed by the subscriber, the Podcasts app now offers for 
content creators Podcast Analytics. This new feature will include total hours listened to a 
specific episode, average minutes per listener, where listeners stopped listening (and 
never returned to the episode), and the average number of listeners that finish an episode 
from beginning to end. This iOS 11 Podcasts app sounds fantastic, but we have yet to see 
it in action. This is why we have Podcasting For Dummies: The Companion Podcast (http://­
podcastingfordummies.com), where we will review and discuss the new app in depth.
Our advice on this matter: Find a method that seems to work for you and stick with it. 
It’s the best you can do . . . for now.

296      PART 5  Pod-sibilities to Consider for Your Show
out with an organization that regularly funds — and has a vested interest in the 
success of — your show. (Obviously, you can’t say that about all advertisers.)
Sponsorships were popular — almost to the point of exclusivity — in the old days 
of radio in the early 20th century. During that time, corporations would create the 
various radio programs as an advertising vehicle — they could even censor con-
tent if (for example) some writer goofed and had the villain using the sponsor’s 
product. Modern-day advertising deals, which allow a station or program to drop 
a 30-second ad into its already-established programming, came into play much 
later; these days, such deals dominate the scene.
Traditional media sponsorships have all but disappeared, and their last bastion 
can be found in the world of daytime television: They have morphed into . . . the 
dreaded infomercial. We’re not suggesting that you turn your podcast into an 
infomercial. However, if you’re catering to a niche audience and a corporate entity 
can service the needs of your audience, that angle may be worth considering.
Understand that obtaining a true sponsor for your show likely means you give up 
some creative control. Instead of paying you a few dollars to run a preproduced ad, 
your sponsoring corporation underwrites your entire show, or at least a signifi-
cant portion of it. Rather than getting you to take a break from your content while 
you talk about its product for a few moments, your content becomes dedicated to 
talking about its product.
Examples of sponsored podcasts include Mike Rowe’s The Way I Heard It podcast 
(http://mikerowe.com/podcast) and WNYC’s Note to Self (www.wnyc.org/shows/
notetoself) sponsored by such companies as Blue Apron, Squarespace, and Zip 
Recruiter.
If you’re thinking about approaching a corporation to underwrite your show, you 
need to provide much of the same information necessary for securing advertisers, 
as discussed earlier. In addition, however, you need to demonstrate how your 
show can help bolster the success metrics of the corporation. “It’s a cool show 
that your customers will love” probably won’t cut it.
There’s no secret sauce that irresistibly attracts corporate sponsorship. Each cor-
poration has distinct goals and objectives. Any podcaster trying to solicit sponsor-
ship would be well served to understand these goals and objectives inside and out, 
and be prepared to clearly demonstrate how sponsoring a podcast can help the 
company achieve those goals.

CHAPTER 15  Show Me the Money      297
Asking Your Listeners for Money
There is one group of potential financial backers out there who couldn’t care less 
about your fancy media kit: your listeners. They couldn’t give a hoot about your 
anticipated growth curve in subscribers or your ratio of direct downloaders to 
feed-based audience. They do have a vested interest in your continuing to produce 
the very best possible show, each episode — and they are (usually) content to let 
you take the show in the direction you feel it should go.
Sometimes your show is important enough to them that they’re willing to pony 
up. That’s why the following section discusses some novel ways you can go about 
soliciting your listeners for funds to help offset some of the costs of creating a 
podcast.
MORE VALUABLE THAN MONEY
Tee and Chuck haven’t gotten rich off podcasting. They do it for the love (see 
Chapter 17). The return on investment they have gotten from picking up a microphone 
and hitting record has gone far beyond cold hard cash. We know, this is starting to 
sound a little hippy-dippy love fest, but hang with us. Sure, we aspired at one time to get 
a nice source of funding and perhaps a fleeting moment to quit our day jobs and turn 
our hobby (or should we say another hobby) in to a full-time paid gig, but the fates had 
other things in store for us.
Looking back on it, though, your humble authors were not expecting the pile of indirect 
benefits podcasting has led them to, and through. Thanks to podcasting, both Chuck 
and Tee have found some great career opportunities. As his gateway to social media, 
Tee not only wrote other books on social media but is a full-time professional in social 
media, managing social media platforms and devising strategies that resonate with 
audiences around the world. Podcasting made Chuck a better presenter, which led to 
promotions at his day job, and even prepared him for an unexpected job transition in 
2010. Podcasting helped Chuck quickly transition to a new role at a new company in just 
three weeks. As for Tee, his own understanding of podcasting and social media sent 
him coast-to-coast and around the world, leading workshops and seminars on the sub-
ject. Finally, let’s not forget the awesome network of people and amazing friendships 
both Chuck and Tee have forged over a decade of firing up microphones and sharing 
their views through RSS feeds.
They cannot promise everyone future success such as what they have been blessed 
with, but keep this in mind: When the people in your life question you for buying some 
(more) electronic gear, start recording your voice, and publish it to the world, tell them 
you’re doing it for more than money.

298      PART 5  Pod-sibilities to Consider for Your Show
Please don’t turn your podcast into a weekly telethon. Most people tolerate the 
time when NPR goes into pledge-drive mode, but no one looks forward to it. If 
you’re going to ask your audience for money, do it tactfully and as rarely as pos-
sible. Please.
Gathering listener donations with PayPal
Some of your audience will so love your show that they’ll happily hand over some 
of their hard-earned money — if you’ll only ask.
Asking for listeners’ support is a two-step process: First you ask for the money, 
and then you provide an easy and convenient way for your listeners to send you 
money. PayPal (www.paypal.com) has been handling small and large web-based 
transactions for years. A PayPal donation link can be fully integrated into your 
website with minimum hassle. Here’s how:
1.	 Log in to PayPal.
If you don’t have a PayPal account, click the Sign Up link and follow the simple 
instructions. You need a valid credit card to sign up.
PayPal, like much of the web, is subject to change. The flow of these steps 
might be slightly different at the time you’re reading this. Regardless, the steps 
you need to follow will basically be the same.
2.	 From your Account Overview page, click the Details in the Selling Tools 
section on the left side.
The Merchant Services page allows you to set up a variety of ways people can 
send you money.
3.	 Click the Create payment buttons for your website link on the right side 
of the page.
You are taken to the My Saved Buttons.
4.	 In the Related items box, click Create New Button.
You are taken to the Create PayPal Payment Button page, as shown in 
Figure 15-1.
5.	 Enter a donation name and donation ID in the appropriate text boxes.
We recommend using the show name, and perhaps a suffix – Donations to help 
you identify your donations if you have other types of income to your PayPal 
account.

CHAPTER 15  Show Me the Money      299
You can also use the ID field to denote multiple types of donations or dona-
tions for different shows in the event you produce more than one podcast. You 
can put anything you want in this field, but keep in mind that it will be visible to 
those making donations — so make sure it isn’t something confusing.
FIGURE 15-1: 
PayPal makes 
accepting 
donations as  
easy as filling  
out a few fields.

6.	Enter a set donation amount if you want in the Amount text box. Also, 
change the designated country if you’d like your currency to be some-
thing other than U.S. dollars.
If you want your listeners to donate a set amount, choose that amount now. If 
you leave the Amount field blank, your users will have to enter an amount 
before they donate. You decide which is best for you.
If you’re familiar with using HTML forms, you can later add a suggested 
donation amount, and allow your listeners to change the amount if they desire. 
Get a copy of Coding For Dummies (Wiley) by Nikhil Abraham if you need help 
with editing forms.
7.	Select the style of Donation button you would like to use from the 
Customize Button section.
If you have a custom button, here’s the place to change it. If you don’t have 
one, don’t worry. The default button works just fine on your website, and you 
can always change it later if you want.
8.	Under Merchant Account ID, choose Use My Secure Merchant Account ID.
Using your merchant account ID links your account to your email address and 
protects you from spammers.
At this point you can optionally review the information the collapsed sections 
labeled Step 2: Save your buttons (optional) and Step 3: Customize advanced 
features (optional). While not required, you should get familiar with what’s 
covered there.
9.	After you fill in the fields on the Donations page, click Create Button at 
the bottom of the page.
PayPal whisks you to the Add a Button to Your Website page.
10.	You have some decisions to make about the custom HTML code for your 
button:
If you’re comfortable doing some minor editing of the HTML that makes your 
website work, copy the HTML in the Website tab and add it to your page.
If you think editing HTML is a little beyond you just now, then simply copy the 
text in the Email tab and include it in your show notes. You’ll want to make it a 
hyperlink, so don’t just leave it like this:

Instead, you want to enclose it with an <a href=“”></a> tag and include 
some descriptive text, like this:

That should do it for the donation link.
Building patrons with Patreon
Another alternative that many podcasters and creative artists are exploring is 
called Patreon (https://patreon.com). Patreon offers a couple ways for you to 
get paid for your content. Like PayPal, you can set up a monthly billing system to 
charge your loyal followers at the beginning of each month. However, you can also 
set it up to tap your patrons’ wallets on a per creation method. For the podcaster, 
this means the harder you work, the more you can potentially get paid. For the 
patron, it means if the podcaster starts to get complacent and doesn’t produce any 
new content, you don’t have to pay.
Many podcasters will set up tiered patronage, much like the different levels public 
radio can set you up with only on a per episode basis rather than per year. For 
example, for $1 per episode, you get a special episode, show notes, or a postcard 
once a year. For $2 per episode, you get your name read on the show and a T-shirt. 
You see how it goes? If you support the show, you get goodies. Each show has its 
own take on what it charges and what it offers.
But how effective can Patreon be? For writers Chris Lester (www.patreon.com/
authorchrislester) and Phil Rossi (www.patreon.com/philrossi), Patreon has 
proven to be quite the motivator in turning out new fiction. Chris Lester, host of 
the award-winning Metamor City podcast, had stepped away from storytelling for 
quite some time before returning with The Raven and the Writing Desk, his own 
author interview show that also journals his own return to writing fiction. His 
accompanying Patreon was solid enough to keep him writing, even when finding 
himself unexpectedly in-between jobs after moving from the West Coast to the 
Midwest. For Phil Rossi, author and podcaster behind Crescent, Eden, and Harvey, 
his greatest challenge for writing fiction was time. His Patreon income allows him 
to invest less in lucrative performance gigs as a musician so he can continue pro-
ducing more fiction. Both Lester and Rossi offer their Patreon investors exclusive 
fiction both in audio and digital formats, and additional incentives when print 
versions of their podcasts are released (see Figure 15-2).

302      PART 5  Pod-sibilities to Consider for Your Show
To get started on Patreon, first have a plan. Think about what you can offer the 
potential contributors to make them want to sign up. Once you have your plan, 
create an account on Patreon by following these steps:
1.	 Click your icon in the upper right and select Become a Creator.
2.	 Click the big blue button Create Your Page.
3.	 Enter your name and click OK.
4.	 When prompted for what you are creating, enter your podcast name and 
click OK.
5.	 Pick the category that your podcast best fits.
Lucky for us, there’s a category called Podcasts!
6.	 Answer the question about the material content by clicking the appropri-
ate option.
7.	 Watch the short video from the CEO of Patreon. It’s informative and 
perhaps a bit inspiring. Click Continue.
8.	 On the Settings page, review the various bits of information.
Some information, like your name and what you are creating, was entered 
earlier whereas some, like cover picture and appropriate social media links, are 
new. You can even set a custom link at patreon.com if you fancy yourself a 
vanity URL.
9.	 Visit the other links across the top of the page and review the informa-
tion for each. When you are done with each section click the big red Save 
Changes button.

available only 
to them.

CHAPTER 15  Show Me the Money      303
The About page lets you describe who you are and what your show is about. 
The Rewards page is where you define the different patron levels and what 
they can expect in return for their fantastic contribution to your artistic work 
(see Figure 15-3). If you have certain goals you would like to meet, you can 
specify them in the Goals page. The Payment page determines whether you 
will charge monthly or per episode. The Thanks page allows you to send a note 
(or video link) to your supporters — always a nice touch.
Don’t forget to set your Payout Preferences if you want to get paid! Visit your 
accounts settings by clicking on your icon in the upper right and choosing 
Account Settings. Click Payout Preferences on the right. Complete the form and 
click Save Preferences.
10.	When you are done reviewing and saving all the other pages, click 
Preview & Launch in the upper right.
Look at your sample page. Make sure it looks the way you want and has 
accurate information. If you need to make changes, go back to any of the other 
pages and save.
11.	Finally, hit the green Go Live button.
Now you can put a link or button on your website guiding your audience to your 
Patreon page, announce it on your show, or any other way to let people know how 
they can help you. Once a month, it automatically withdraws money from their 
account and deposits it in yours.

Patreon allows 
you to set

304      PART 5  Pod-sibilities to Consider for Your Show
Patreon takes a service fee for hosting and managing your content. Typically, this 
is 5%. However, be sure to review the payment processing fees to understand how 
much you can expect from your donors.
Selling stuff
Some podcasters offer merchandise for sale to support their show financially — 
T-shirts, hats, mugs, CDs, autographed pictures, you name it. If it’s sellable, 
chances are good that some podcaster out there is selling it.
If you’re contemplating selling merchandise via your podcast, you fall into one of 
two groups:
»
» You have merchandise to sell. Musicians, authors, artists, and craftspeople 
fall into this category. For these podcasters, offering CDs, books, prints, or 
other items to the listening audience can bring in significant revenue. (Down 
the road, there’s no reason why it shouldn’t be possible to make a living via 
podcasting.)
Once again, PayPal (www.paypal.com) can be very helpful in taking away the 
technical hurdles for selling items online and integrating them into your 
podcast and website. If you can master the process for setting up online 
donations, you aren’t far from having PayPal work as your entire online 
shopping cart. But this book is about podcasting, not about PayPal. Luckily for 
you, Victoria Rosenberg and Marsha Collier wrote PayPal For Dummies (Wiley).
»
» You need merchandise to sell. If you need stuff to sell, CafePress (www.
cafepress.com) is more than happy to step in and offer its assistance. 
Remember the T-shirts and other stuff mentioned earlier? You can go to the 
trouble of making those yourself, carrying an inventory, and shipping the 
orders out as they trickle in — or you can let CafePress take care of all of that 
for you.
Setting up a CafePress storefront is a breeze, though it’s a highly configurable 
task, and how you set it up depends on what you want to sell. A basic shop is 
free to set up and to use. Your listeners buy the T-shirts and coffee mugs (or 
whatever), with your logo or design on them, from the CafePress store, and 
CafePress pays you a commission. It’s very simple and requires only some 
quick setup information from you to get started. It takes about five minutes to 
set this up; CafePress takes care of the rest.

CHAPTER 15  Show Me the Money      305
Don’t expect to make tons of cash via CafePress. Unless you can convince a large 
group of your listeners that they simply must have an $18 T-shirt with your logo 
on it, we wouldn’t recommend quitting your day job just yet.
Handling Fee-Based Subscriptions
Getting your listeners to donate a couple of bucks to you or buy your latest CD is 
one thing, but getting them to shell out money for the privilege of listening to your 
show is another matter altogether.
If you don’t have a preestablished following, a fee-based subscription approach 
likely won’t help you. If you do have a following but have never required anyone 
to give you money, you may find yourself with less of a following afterwards. Use 
this option sparingly  — and only if you really think others are willing to give 
money to listen to your podcast. You’ll need to come to the decision whether you 
want x listeners for free, or 1/10 x listeners to pay — okay, we made that number 
up, but it will definitely be far less than your current listener base.
One way to get your listeners interested in parting with their money would be to 
give them a sample of what to expect. Offer the first episode or two for free down-
load and in them, mention how to get the rest. (We knew podcasting was addict-
ing, but this is ridiculous.) Another method is to offer the opening 15-20 minutes 
of your podcast for free, then offer the rest of the episode for a fee, provided your 
show has the content to follow it up with.
Securing your feed
Okay, we’re sure you’re wondering just how you prevent giving away your podcast 
to anyone who cares to download it, not just to those who pay for it. The answer 
is to create a secure RSS feed with logins and passwords.
It’s time to be blunt — setting up and maintaining a secure feed is a little ugly. 
The good news is this is a For Dummies title, so we don’t expose all the technical 
warts and scars here. We keep the process simple but still manage to get you in 
touch with the inner code monkey that lurks in everyone.
To start, there’s nothing special about a secure feed. The web server handles 
prompting for the login and password. You are responsible for setting up the feed 

306      PART 5  Pod-sibilities to Consider for Your Show
and a configuration file. If you’re using a web server based on Apache — which a lot 
of hosting providers are — the high-level technical bits look something like this:
»
» Create a separate RSS feed for your protected content in a separate directory — 
we’ll call it members.
»
» In the new members directory, create a file called .htaccess with some 
special instructions. These instructions tell the web server where to look for 
accounts and groups allowed access to this directory.
The authentication process works like this:
1.	 The Apache web server receives an instruction from the podcatching client to 
download the new feed file. It peeks inside the .htaccess file to find the logins 
and passwords.
2.	 The podcatching client presents a prompt for a login and password.
3.	 The user types his or her information.
4.	 The podcatching client sends the info back to the web server. It checks to see 
whether a) the information provided is correct, and b) that the account is in a 
group with permissions to the directory.
5.	 If both of those are correct, the feed is downloaded and processed by the 
podcatching client like any other feed.
A sample .htaccess file looks like this:
AuthType Basic
AuthName "Members Only"
AuthUserFile /www/users/chucktomasi/html/security/passwd
AuthGroupFile /www/users/chucktomasi/html/security/group
Require group members
The first line (AuthType) tells the server what type of authentication to use — for 
now, stick with what it says. The second line (AuthName) is the text that appears 
when the login/password prompt appears. The AuthUserFile line points to a file 
with login names and passwords. The AuthGroupFile file is a simple list of 
accounts associated with a group name. It’s important that the files indicated in 
AuthUserFile and AuthGroupFile are placed where the file says they are or this 
doesn’t work.

CHAPTER 15  Show Me the Money      307
The contents of the .htaccess file are case-sensitive  — except for the text 
between quotes. It’s extremely important you get the case right for this to work. 
One of your authors spent many hours trying to figure out why things didn’t work 
because he had Group instead of group.
A sample line from the AuthUserFile file looks like this:
chuck.tomasi:2nyp44rex
In this example, the login name is chuck.tomasi, and the password is encrypted, 
so nobody can download your file and find out all the passwords. You, the podcaster, 
are 
responsible 
for 
creating 
and 
maintaining 
the AuthUserFile 
(and 
AuthGroupFile). For a small list of user accounts, it’s fairly easy to maintain the 
password file by hand, using a command-line utility called htpasswd — commonly 
provided as part of the Apache web server.
Not all hosting accounts provide access to a command-line interface. You should 
check with your web hosting provider to see whether you have this capability. If 
not, you may have to resort to creating and maintaining these files on another 
system and uploading the files. For Mac OS X users, you already have Apache 
installed and can access these tools from the Terminal window. Windows users 
have to download Apache (http://apache.org) to install them.
If you find yourself with a runaway hit podcast on your hands with lots of accounts, 
managing them can be a bit of a pain. In such a case, look at a product like aMem-
ber at www.amember.com, which is a PHP web interface that runs on your web 
server. Make sure your hosting account allows you to upload and run PHP pro-
grams beforehand, though.
A typical line from an AuthGroupFile file might look like this:
members:tee.morris,chuck.tomasi,kreg.steppe
The format is pretty straightforward — first is the group name (members), then a 
colon (:), then a list of comma-separated names from the AuthUserFile file. You 
can name the group anything you like — as long as it corresponds to the Require 
group line in the .htaccess file. The AuthGroupFile can also manage multiple 
groups with each line following the same format described earlier.
The path less traveled
When you have your AuthUserFile and AuthGroupFile files set up, you must 
designate the physical path to them. You get the physical path to your password 
and group files from your hosting tech support.

308      PART 5  Pod-sibilities to Consider for Your Show
Be sure to ask for the physical path and not the virtual path. A virtual path is a 
shortcut that the web server gets from the browser on the other end in a URL to 
get to your files — for example, /security/passwd. The physical is how the oper-
ating system on the web server gets to the same information — for example, /
www/users/chucktomasi/html/security/passwd. Most modern podcatchers and 
RSS readers support basic authentication. If you would like more information on 
configuring an Apache file, refer to the Apache web page (www.apache.org).
If all else fails, seek out an experienced web geek and offer pizza, extra cheese, 
and a six-pack of Red Bull!
A great example of a pay-for-podcasting is Bill O’Reilly (https://www.
billoreilly.com). The former Fox News channel host has taken his cadre of loyal 
listeners and charges about $50 for a premium membership to his audio and video 
content (which includes a free gift.)

Podcasting for Publicity
T
rue podcasters bristle at the growing commercialization of podcasting. With 
many corporate podcasts dominating iTunes and Stitcher, independent 
podcasters have voiced many concerns that boil down to one: A true podcast 
is done for passion, not for profit. The movement towards podcasting as a mon-
eymaking venture goes against the grain of a true podcast. The words, opinions, 
and emotions should all be aimed for the listeners’ hearts and minds, not their 
wallets.
Well, yeah, that’s all fine and dandy — but before we cheer on the sentiments of 
the purist, indie podcaster, sheer love of the medium does not pay the bills. Also, 
when juggernaut organizations like NPR create runaway hits with millions of 
­listeners, you won’t hear their producers or creators thump their chests and 
­proclaim proudly, “No, you go on and keep your commercial revenue and corporate 
bankrolls. We’re going to keep on podcasting with our USB mic and preamp.”
Truth be told, podcasting has proven itself a great way to reach the consumer. It’s 
economical, unobtrusive, and can be a great way to build a potential audience.
With blogging, social networks, and the still-mysterious podcasts all struggling 
to find their place in the corporate world, all these platforms are finding them-
selves becoming integrated as part of a business marketing and promotion 
machine; and with the right directors, strategists, and content producers in place, 
these platforms are gaining traction. Podcasting has come a long way since the 
first edition of this book, but for larger corporations (such as Coca-Cola, Nike, and 

310      PART 5  Pod-sibilities to Consider for Your Show
many others), podcasting remains an unproven medium. Because podcasting is 
audio-on-demand, there’s still no easy way to measure numbers, feedback, and 
response in the same way radio and television advertisements are tracked. 
­However, statistics from WordPress plug-ins like JetPack, online services like 
Google Analytics, and service providers like LibSyn continue to develop new 
methods to do so.
This doesn’t mean the change is taking its time. With iTunes and its podcast 
­subscriptions going from zero to 1 million in two days — match those numbers, 
J.K. Rowling! (oh, wait, you did. . .) — the corporate world is wanting to know 
more about podcasting, realizing that some independent podcasts are discovering 
new audiences for their products (and broadening their existing audience) one 
MP3 at a time. If the end goal of your podcast is publicity, this chapter is for you. 
We go through several examples of where podcasting has paid off — maybe not in 
dollars and cents, but in good word-of-mouth buzz.
Podcasting and Politics
In the political arena, innovation can be a political candidate’s best strategic 
option in winning an office. The podcasting fad that some of Capitol Hill’s old 
guard snickered and scoffed at is now part of its own outreach initiatives. Indi-
viduals interested in holding office — be it local, state, or national — are side-
stepping conventional media and adding to their platform the people who listen in 
the podosphere.
What we’re defining in this section as a political podcast is a podcast hosted by a 
political figure or an individual seeking a political office. (We’re not talking about 
podcasts where a host discusses current affairs, rants about the state of the world, 
or cracks jokes about the latest scandal.)
So, what can a podcast do for you, the tech-savvy politician?
»
» Podcasting (and its companion blog, if you use a blog as part of your delivery) 
connects you directly with your constituencies.
»
» Podcasting can reach young voters, the elusive demographic that can easily 
make or break a victory at the polls.
»
» Podcasting avoids the bias that creeps up in media outlets, allowing you as a 
candidate to present agendas and intentions uninterrupted.

CHAPTER 16  Podcasting for Publicity      311
When going political with a podcast, whether you’re running for the U.S. Senate or 
podcasting your term as School Board representative, here are a few things to 
keep in mind:
»
» Keep your podcast on a consistent weekly schedule. Monthly podcasts 
don’t cut it; the tide of politics is in constant flux. Daily updates are less than 
practical, but weekly podcasts work well for ongoing political issues, and you 
can shape their content to remain timely enough to fit the podcasting 
medium. Set a day for delivering your weekly message and stick to 
that schedule.
»
» Focus on the issues, not the opinions. A political podcaster will always walk 
a fine line between public servant and political commentator. You need to 
stay focused on the issues. If you suddenly start hammering away with 
opinion and commentary, you’d become more like Hannity, Beck, or Maddow. 
If you want politics as your podcast’s subject matter, ask yourself whether 
you’re looking to help listeners understand the issues accurately and take 
meaningful action, or whether you’re just ranting and venting to entertain 
people who want their opinions reinforced.
»
» Give your listeners a plan for action. When you cover the issues in your 
podcast, provide possible solutions to the pressing matters of your commu-
nity and your constituents. Whether you’re detailing blood drives or fundrais-
ers, or launching an awareness campaign for cancer research, increase that 
divide between political figure and political commentator by offering listeners 
ways they can get involved in the community and make a difference.
Podcasting is definitely an avenue to explore if you’re venturing into the political 
area, but this is not your sole means in reaching out to voters. You will need to 
campaign, of course. Get out on the road, shake hands, kiss babies, and the like. 
Unless you are recording said baby-kissing and hand-shaking, campaigning will 
mean your podcast goes on the occasional break. Make sure to communicate to 
your listeners that changes in the posting schedule are upcoming. When you can, 
give a podcast from the road to keep the communication lines open.
Anytime a podcast goes public on the issues, its creator walks a fine line between 
public servant and political commentator. The podcasters described in the follow-
ing paragraph all keep their content focused on the issues and less on what they 
feel about the issues.
The first politician to host a political podcast of this nature was North Carolina 
Senator John Edwards with the One America Committee Podcast with John Edwards, 
covering poverty, Internet law, and environmental issues. His wife, Elizabeth 
Edwards, was also featured, raising awareness on breast cancer. The success of 
the One America podcast caught the attention of the govern-ator himself,  

312      PART 5  Pod-sibilities to Consider for Your Show
Arnold Schwarzenegger, who podcasts his weekly radio address. Then, direct from  
the Oval Office, George W. Bush and Barack Obama hosted podcasts on a weekly 
basis, much in the same manner as FDR’s Fireside Chats only this time  
happening on your mobile devices. And at the time of writing this, Senator Bernie 
Sanders podcasts from the left side of the aisle at https://www.sanders.senate.
gov/bernies-podcast (shown in Figure 16-1) while Senator Ron Paul offers from 
www.stitcher.com/podcast/ron-paul-liberty-report a look at the issues 
from the right.
If you’re a politician and you want to get in touch with the people (to respond 
when voters complain about poor communication with their representatives or 
the candidates running for office), why not invite them into your kitchen, offer 
them a cup of virtual coffee, and ask them to relax a bit? Instead of dishing up 
prepared statements from professional speechwriters, you can offer voters (and 
worldwide listeners) impromptu, candid, sincere opinions on issues facing the 
country and the world.
Telling the World a Story,  
One Podcast at a Time
The whole point behind promotion  — be it for books, film, or other forms of 
entertainment — is to win prospective target audiences (or build on existing ones) 
with something new or to give a different take on a familiar commodity. For a 
fraction of the cost of print advertisements and broadcast-media commercials,

CHAPTER 16  Podcasting for Publicity      313
podcasting opens markets for your creative work — and can even start to get your 
name into an international market. If you’re an established presence in the writ-
ing market, or any entertainment field, the fans you have nurtured, with time, 
will not only eagerly support your podcast, but also introduce your MP3s to reader 
groups, friends, and enthusiasts of the subjects you’re writing about.
Podcasting can introduce your writings or your music to audiences worldwide. 
For  artists in more visual arts such as film, dance, painting, or sculpture, 
­podcasting — audio or video — can serve as a journal leading up to the premiere 
of your work or a behind-the-scenes look at how works go from idea to fruition. 
It’s an instant connection with your audience, and a great way to build an audi-
ence by getting them to know you on however intimate a level works best for you 
and your work. Planning a strategy for this kind of promotion only helps your 
agenda:
»
» When podcasting even in a visual media, briefly describe the action  
for the audience. In Masterpiece Studio’s podcast (www.pbs.org/wgbh/
masterpiece/podcasts), both hosts and guests add into their interview 
details about scenes and moments that accompany audio clips from produc-
tions being discussed. It is never taken for granted that people have seen the 
episode or special event this companion podcast is showcasing. (Many times, 
the host will give a quick spoiler warning.) In only a few words and a few 
seconds, Masterpiece Studio sets the scene for what’s happening and why it is 
talking about it for the sake of listeners who are currently watching the latest 
PBS offering.
If you’re documenting your visual art, it will take only a moment to describe 
what you’re doing. For the painter: “I am using green with just a hint of black 
so we can make the eyes appear more unearthly, unnatural.” For a dancer, 
“In reconstructing the Australian Aboriginal dance, you must remain grounded 
and deep in your squats, more so than what is normally seen in modern 
dance.” Commentary like this, especially in a voiceover with video, does not 
need to go into every minute detail; but a few words are needed to create or 
complete a picture.
»
» For writers and musicians: Edit, edit, edit. Awkward pauses, stammers, 
and stumbled words are obstacles for a writer introducing his work to the 
podosphere: They’ve gotta go! The approach is no different from that of an 
independent musician who podcasts a rehearsal session or a recording: You 
don’t want off-key instruments and vocalists missing the high notes. Your 
podcasts need to sound sharp and clean.

314      PART 5  Pod-sibilities to Consider for Your Show
Musicians, no matter if it takes 5 takes or 50 takes, should have their instru-
ments in tune, lyrics clearly pronounced, and all notes sung on key. Writers 
should enunciate, speak clearly, and (most importantly) enjoy the manuscript. 
Each piece, whether music or printed word, should be a performance that 
serves as your audition to a worldwide audience. (While that may sound a bit 
nerve-racking, don’t think of it as walking out on stage so much as building 
something fine to send into the world.) Just have fun, and your audience will 
enjoy the ride with you.
If you need a refresher on the basics of editing, skip back to Chapter 8 for the 
primers on editing with Audacity and GarageBand.
»
» Open or close your podcasts with a brief, off-script commentary. Before 
beginning your latest installment or after your latest chapter concludes, a 
brief word from the author is a nice (and in many cases, welcoming) option for 
a podcast’s audience. This commentary gives the author a unique opportunity 
to connect with readers, sharing ideas about what inspired a scene, to 
promote an upcoming book-signing, or to give an update about what’s 
happening in the next book’s production.
This approach adds to the intimate experience of podcasting a novel, and 
podcast storytellers like Mur Lafferty, Philippa Ballantine, and Chris Lester use 
this to invite listeners into their real world after sharing the world they 
imagined. Let your audience members know who you are, and they’ll show 
their appreciation through their support of your current and future works.
Podcasting continues to prove itself as a viable means of promotion for artists of 
any media unable to fund their own coast-to-coast tour. It may make conven-
tional creators shake their heads at the idea of giving their works away for free, 
but the numbers and individual successes of authors taking this chance is the 
proof in this publicity. Now, before ink even hits the page, authors are building fan 
bases and getting their names out into the public. (And some of the lucky ones get 
to write books for the For Dummies people!)
WHERE IT ALL BEGAN . . .
Allow us a personal account of the journey from podcasting fan to full-fledged podcaster. 
When Podcasting For Dummies’ own Tee Morris was in the final rewrites of Legacy of 
MOREVI, his publisher contacted him and said, “Okay, Tee, start thinking of neat promo-
tional ideas.” Around this time, Evo Terra and Michael R. Mennenga of The Dragon Page 
had just started podcasting. The more Tee found out about podcasting, the more he 

CHAPTER 16  Podcasting for Publicity      315
began planning to podcast MOREVI to get word out about Legacy of MOREVI. After all, 
he’d been complimented several times on his live readings. And as an actor who loved 
playing around with his Mac’s audio and video features, he figured, why not?
The Prologue of MOREVI: The Chronicles of Rafe & Askana dropped into the Dragon Page’s 
feed on January 21, 2005, and so began a completely new kind of promotion, different 
from what The Dragon Page had ever done before: a chapter presented every Friday, as 
read by the author. The feedback was instantaneous. Within weeks of Tee’s first epi-
sode, two other authors stepped up and offered their works for podcast as well. One of 
them was Mark Jeffrey, author of the science fiction/fantasy young adult adventure, The 
Pocket and The Pendant (www.markjeffrey.net). The other author was adrenaline-
hopped, in-your-face, über-intense conductor of mayhem, chaos, and carnage, Scott 
Sigler (www.scottsigler.com), and the book was EarthCore.
From here, the podcast novel — or podiobook — was born. Since then, authors both new 
and accomplished have turned to podcasting as a way of sharing their stories with the world.

316      PART 5  Pod-sibilities to Consider for Your Show
Keeping Good Company:  
Community Podcasts
Slice-of-life podcasts that encourage community among listeners and among 
fans are podcasts that promote. They can promote a show cancelled too soon into 
production, an issue affecting the well-being of a community, or offer a voice to a 
cause. The promotion comes from word-of-mouth advertising (buzz) that these 
podcasters generate from their thoughts, comments, and opinions on their 
­subject — be it traveling across Spain, daily life in New York City, George Lucas’s 
Star Wars, or Joss Whedon’s Firefly.
Slice-of-life podcasts let the world into locations and clue people into possibilities 
that listeners may be curious about. After a few podcasts, you can even encourage 
listeners to experience that corner of the world, that idea, or join the 
community.
Do you have a cause you want to give attention to? Do you want to raise awareness 
in your county or district? Do you want to share the experience of preparing for a 
wedding or anniversary? Consider sound-seeing tour podcasts to build an online 
community through your podcast.
Creating a podcast to encourage testimony
Community is synonymous with podcasting. This book talks a lot about commu-
nity, establishing a connection between you the podcaster and your audience 
which is waiting impatiently for the next episode. Podcasts can also bring an 
existing community — a group with a shared interest, a community of homeown-
ers, or a group dedicated to a cause — together and keep its members informed. 
The podcast can reach audiences in and outside of your community, sharing your 
interests and concerns with others, making your community even stronger in the 
long run.
The WDW Radio Show (Figure 16-2, found at www.wdwradio.com) has been a long-
running podcast about planning the best trip to the “House of the Mouse,” Walt 
Disney World. Hosted by Disney expert, author, speaker, and entrepreneur Lou 
Mongello, the WDW Radio Show has built an impressive community around this 
family-friendly podcast, featuring a blog, videos, and live broadcasts alongside 
this audio travel guide.
Travel planning is not the only topic of discussion on the WDW Radio Show. Lou 
also hosts interviews with representatives from the Walt Disney Corporation, 
shares comments from listeners about previous episodes or queries about best 

CHAPTER 16  Podcasting for Publicity      317
travel tips, and many personal anecdotes on everything from a favorite amuse-
ment park ride to the best Disney vacation memories. What makes the WDW Radio 
Show more of a community than just another podcast is in how its podcast works 
to not only inform listeners on getting the most out of a visit to Walt Disney 
World, but also encourage listeners to share their own tips, ideas, and stories 
about the best way to experience Disney, Epcot, and other properties. This com-
munity, in turn, promotes the Walt Disney image through the best of methods: 
word-of-mouth.
The podosphere takes great pride in its sense of community, but the podcasts 
showcased here are set apart because the community is encouraged to take a more 
active role in the issues, concerns, and points of focus the podcast is centered 
around. More than chiming in with feedback, the community takes an active role 
in participating with increasing awareness over the podcast’s main subject. In 
some cases, the producing of the podcast brings the community together, either 
through listener contributions, listeners directing the course of the show, or 
­listeners coming together for a common cause.
Podcasting for fun while promoting  
in the process
When it comes to promotion, no one does a better job in promoting your business 
than your most passionate fans.
They work for free, set their own hours, and sing the praises (if you are lucky) of 
whatever it is you happen to be producing. Many times, these podcasts are nick-
named fancasts but these are podcasts where consumers independently sit down 
around mics and talk about your business, be it an entertainment property, a 
product, or some sort of service.
But what, you may ask, is the line between a fancast and a podcast about your 
business?

Well, as we describe in Chapter 5, The Expanse has The Churn, produced by SyFy 
Wire. The Churn is hosted by SyFy and features as co-hosts authors Ty Franck and 
Daniel Abraham, who write collectively as James S.A. Corey, author of The Expanse 
novels. This makes the podcast an official production, and upon listening to it, you 
know without question that anything appearing on this show is firsthand knowl-
edge of what is happening on the set, coming from the creators of the world, and 
shared from the actors bringing these characters to life.
That does not mean The Churn is the only podcast about this popular SyFy 
offering.
While SyFy hosts its own podcast about The Expanse, Solo Talk Media produces The 
Expanse Podcast: Tales from the Rocinante (see Figure 16-3).
The Expanse Podcast: Tales from the Rocinante (http://solotalkmedia.com/
category/the-expanse-podcast) is hosted by Mark, a graphic designer from 
Ontario, Canada. Mark is not affiliated with SyFy or Universal Studios, but he is a 
fan of The Expanse and launched this podcast to share his love for the series. Along 
with show recaps, he reports news on The Expanse cast and crew and offers his 
own speculation on how things will unfold over upcoming episodes. Other shows 
like Solo Talk’s include The Expanse: The Unofficial Podcast and The Expanse After 
Show, two podcasts independently produced from SyFy’s own official podcasts. 
These are examples of fans who are sharing their appreciation for this science 
­fiction series, serving as an unofficial street team for the production.
When it comes to fans podcasting, be it about a specific property or a generic 
theme, don’t expect all the opinions coming from the podcast to be positive. If 
fans don’t like a direction or a decision taken in a series, they will share it on their 
podcast. A fan’s podcast could be considered the highest form of feedback, but it 
should not be regarded as such. You might like the podcasts supporting your 
favorite sports team, show, or organization. You also might hear some opinions 
radically different from your own.

Between fancasts hosted by experienced journalists like Yahoo! Sports’ Greg 
Wyshynski and Vice Sports’ Dave Lozo (of Puck Soup at http://nerdist.com/
podcasts/puck-soup, part of the Nerdist Network) or two fans passionate for the 
sport as in Shut Yer Five Hole with Meg and Piper (http://shutyerfivehole.
libsyn.com), the National Hockey League receives regular promotion and atten-
tion free of charge. Irish culture is also given plenty of attention through podcasts 
like historian Fin Dwyer’s Irish History Podcast (http://irishhistory.libsyn.
com) and celebrated musician Marc Gunn’s Irish & Celtic Music Podcast (http://
celticmusicpodcast.com), shown in Figure  16-4. What’s terrific about these 
podcasts is they can work to not only promote your passion but promote your own 
brand. Marc Gunn, for example, in showcasing Irish and Celtic music, culture, and 
lore on his podcast, also spreads awareness of his own brand as an accomplished 
musician. The podcast, blog, and companion app all offer listeners a chance to 
find his music alongside the music of other independent musicians featured on 
his podcast.
Community-driven podcasts cover a wide range of audiences. However, all com-
munities share a similar mindset, and you can apply these “sound” production 
principles:
»
» You are the host, but it’s not all about you. Community podcasts should be 
about the community. Yes, there is room for personal thoughts and commentary, 
but in small doses.
The podcast is about the community and how it interacts with the world 
around you; that is what the content should focus on. Your podcast can 
feature other members of the community who share the same opinions as 
yours or even take opposing viewpoints (a spirited debate can up your show). 
Just remember that the community-based podcast is not about you personally, 
but about how you see the world, how that connects with the people around 
you in the community, and how all that comes together in the pursuit of a 
common interest.

» Avoid the negative. It would be easy to turn a podcast into a gossip column 
or a personal rant against the very concept that brought the community into 
being. While there is no law or ethic barring you from speaking out or voicing 
concerns, a community is based on support. Whether you consider yourself a 
fan of Harry Potter, Apple Computers, or your local county, your goal in a 
community podcast is to remain positive and celebrate the benefits of being 
part of the cooperative spirit. If there is a matter of concern in your commu-
nity, then there’s room for debate and action, as with a political podcast —  
offer some possible solutions to these issues.
Regardless of the kind of community you’re chronicling, your podcast should 
work much like glue  — helping to keep supporters together in the face of 
­problems (instead of just crying in your collective beer) and celebrating what 
gives them joy. Reinforce that sense of community and keep your podcast strong.

podcast
Podcasting for Passion
O
ur mission from the beginning of this book has been to fill you in on what 
a podcast is, demystify the technical aspects of getting your voice heard 
on media players around the world, and assure you that those with the 
drive to make their message happen can do it, with the right tools. But a podcast 
is empty if you don’t have that drive, that passion to get your podcast up and 
­running and keep it running, whether the episode goes out every week, every 
other week, or every month. We drop that word a lot throughout the book: passion. 
What do we mean by podcasting with passion?
Okay, if you take the dictionary as a starting point, passion means “a keen interest 
in a particular subject or activity, or the object of somebody’s intense interest or 
enthusiasm.” You can have state-of-the-art audio equipment, hire the most 
engaging vocal talent, and employ the best engineers, but that isn’t what makes 
a  podcast a podcast. The artists and creativity behind a podcast make an 
­investment  — not simply financial or physical  — and collect the windfall in 
­listener feedback and download stats.
Yes, a podcast can make money, promote a cause, or bring attention to social 
issues, but without that passion, you might as well sit behind a microphone and 
read the instruction manual to your mobile phone. Passion is what motivates rela-
tive unknowns to slip on the headphones, step up to the microphone, and let their 
words fly.

322      PART 5  Pod-sibilities to Consider for Your Show
This chapter won’t presume to teach you how to create, cultivate, or conjure your 
own passion. It’s something you have, or you don’t, for a given topic — and we 
suspect everybody has it for some topics. Instead, we offer some real-world exam-
ples of how others apply their passions to podcasts — and we tell you about some 
tools to apply a little passion-power of your own.
The Philosophical Question for  
All Podcasters: Why Do We Do It?
It’s going to come up sooner or later: Someone will question your motives, 
­rationale, and even sanity at your investment of so much time and energy into a 
podcast. We highly recommend deep nonsensical answers such as “It’s because of 
the cheese” be returned to these people. Then watch their eyes start to twitch. 
That never stops being funny.
The following sections tell you some of the ways you can take that passion and 
channel it in to a truly effective force behind your podcast.
Gaining perspective on passion
“Get some perspective!” they say. Well, we agree with them (whoever they are). As 
a podcaster, you need a firm idea of what your show is about. If you’re not sure 
what your point is, your audience isn’t going to be sure, either!
Marc Blackburn’s America at War podcast (http://americaatwarpodcast. 
libsyn.com) started in February 2016 and is still a relative newcomer to the pod-
cast scene at the time of this writing, but the content has been centuries in the 
making and taken decades of Marc’s life to collect to tell his story about military 
history. Marc, a Ranger for the National Park Service, has a PhD in American Mili-
tary ­history and has been in love with the topic since he was a teen — let’s just say 
a “long time ago.” He loves his topic and he loves to write. That’s what we call a 
certifiable subject matter expert!
Marc was one of a dozen or so people who participated in a podcasting course 
offered by Chuck Tomasi in 2009 to the National Park Service western region. One 
day he found himself with the training, the material, and enough Amazon gift 
cards to get some equipment so he decided it was time to let the world know about 
his love for military history.

CHAPTER 17  Podcasting for Passion      323
He has a well thought out method to his madness that can serve aspiring 
­podcasters well.
»
» Learn the landscape. Take time to find out what shows on your topic exist. 
Like any good prospective podcaster, Marc did some listening to other similar 
podcasts to understand what is out there and identify a unique place he can 
fill in the podosphere.
»
» Look for a unique angle. The last things your listeners need are carbon 
copies of other podcasts or (perish the thought) radio shows based on a 
template. If your passion is commonplace, focus on a niche or small aspect 
that you have the most knowledge about. Many of the shows Marc heard 
focused on specific events, often leaving the listener desiring more context of 
how we got those events. Marc opted for a chronological approach starting 
with the settlement of Jamestown in 1607. Until we listened, we weren’t aware 
that the reasons for our early colonists seceding from England go back so far.
»
» Make it personal. Let’s face it, history in high school was pretty dull because 
it was mainly facts about people and places a long time ago — okay, as teens 
we also had other things on our minds to distract us, too. Marc explains that it 
helps to make the listener feel a part of the story. He’s got expertise in this 
area as well having interpretation training from the National Park Service. We 
sure wish we had someone like Marc leading our high school history classes. It 
would have been a lot easier to relate to what these people went through 
since we were the nerdier types who didn’t have to think about a date on 
Friday night. Figure 17-1 shows Marc’s America at War podcast.

324      PART 5  Pod-sibilities to Consider for Your Show
Podcasting passion with a purpose
Podcasting with a purpose is an essential. By doing so, you have a destination. It 
doesn’t matter if that destination is to educate, showcase your material, or enter-
tain. Pick something as your core reason for speaking and don’t be afraid to have 
fun with it and make it exciting.
That’s exactly what Barry and Catherine Cohen of Phoenix, Arizona, have done 
with their podcast Together 24/7 (http://together247.net). Not only are they 
partners in life, but also in business. They started working together in 2003. 
­Several of their friends and colleagues kept telling them, “You two are great 
together and funny; you should get a show.” They heard tales of people making 
bushel baskets of money and thought it might be worth a try. With Barry’s techni-
cal background and a little research, they put together their first episode.
Together 24/7 talks to other couples in the same situation — they own their own 
business and live together. (God bless them!) The main purpose of the show is to 
be a vehicle for clients for their consulting business; however, it has turned into 
much more than that, bringing them friendships, fun, and yes, more together 
time.
Their approach to podcasting can be summed up like this:
»
» A new perspective on creativity. As Barry and Catherine are going about 
their day they are constantly asking each other, “Would this be good in the 
show?” “We should think about adding this in a future episode,” and “Do you 
think people on the show will find this helpful?” Tee and Chuck agree as well. 
It’s hard to listen to another show, or watch TV or a movie without thinking 
about the production, editing, lighting, vocal inflections, really everything that 
goes in to it and try to improve their own product. That’s called being profes-
sionally aware.
»
» Continuity. Produce episodes on a regular basis with a consistent format. As 
Catherine stated, “If you want to make changes to your show, do it how you 
would cook a frog. You don’t just throw a live frog in a frying pan or it will hop 
out. You put it in a pot of water and slowly turn up the heat.” The metaphor, 
gross as it may seem, is also appropriate to podcasting. If you suddenly shift 
topics or format, your audience may think they got the wrong show.
»
» Because it’s fun. Sure, the primary purpose of the show is to drive interest 
with their potential clients, but it’s the passion for what they do and enjoying, 
that keeps the show going.

CHAPTER 17  Podcasting for Passion      325
Sharing your passion with friends
Enthusiasm can be infectious. Podcasting can sometimes feel like a very solitary 
endeavor when it’s just one voice behind the mic, but as we mention in Chapter 5, 
getting multiple hosts around the microphone can be a challenge. However, when 
the mics go live and the banter begins it can be a challenge to stop talking. It’s that 
spark that all podcasters strive for, and sometimes, with the right people, the 
chemistry is instantaneous.
Podcaster Tony Mast of the Back Seat Producers (http://backseatproducers.com) 
knows all about this chemistry as his first foray into podcasting over a decade ago 
began with Fanboy Smackdown, a podcast that evolved into Back Seat Producers, a 
podcast about what’s at the box office, what’s coming to Blu-ray, and what fans 
would like to see from Hollywood. “We all knew each other from our local science 
fiction convention, Archon,” Tony recalls, “and we got together to create Fanboy 
Smackdown which launched on the week of April 30, 2006. The thing was, we could 
never talk about anything other than movies, so we re-branded the podcast to 
Backseat Producers.” Since then, Tony has launched other podcasts such as SciFi 
Smackdown (with Christiana Ellis and Trampas Whiteman), Tony’s Losing It 
(a weight-loss podcast), and many Backseat Producers spinoffs like Backseat Box 
Office (still on-going with different hosts), Backseat Quickies (a 10-minute movie 
review podcast), and Backseat Book Club.
The original intent of Tony, a writer of fiction, and his co-hosts was to build a 
fanbase around their podcast and their personalities. That way, when their books 
went live, they would have an instant fan base. “The podcasts evolved into 
­something much bigger,” he admits. Even with the success of Backseat Producers 
and their loyal fan base (Backseat Box Office, for example, is produced solely by fans 
of the original podcast), Tony continues to podcast because of the community they 
have built. “When these listeners drive through town, we all get together and have 
drinks with them, or pie from Richmond’s Proper Pie Company, in Tee’s case. 
We’ve met them at cons. We call out our friends on the podcast because we know 
they listen.”
For Tony, the podcast is a catalyst for staying in touch with friends, as well as 
forcing himself to slow down and treat himself to a bit of entertainment. “The 
reason I podcast now is that my buddies come over and we have a good time for 
an hour or two. Our lives get busy, and there are things that we want to do but 
don’t make time to do. Podcasting forces us to make time with our friends, and 
obligates me to just stop and sit down to watch a movie, which is not a bad thing.”
As for a podcast’s infectious enthusiasm, as we mention earlier, the Backseat Pro-
ducers continues to grow beyond its original founders. “We’ve had a lot of people 
come to our table every week and served as co-hosts. Right now, we are a group 
of four who have been consistent over the years,” Tony says, chuckling a bit at 

326      PART 5  Pod-sibilities to Consider for Your Show
being the old man on the mic, “but for a while we had a gentleman in his ­fifties 
joining us every week. We have David who’s in his thirties, and David  —  
­everywhere we go — tells people he builds a rapport with ‘Hey, we do a podcast. 
Show up at Tony’s house Wednesday night,’ and this brings a completely differ-
ent set of ideas, ideals, and perspectives that keeps Backseat Producers fresh after 
400 episodes.”
When you invite friends together to launch a podcast, here are a few tips to keep 
in mind:
»
» Make sure to have an agenda for the night. Coming up with a plan is 
more than just saying to the people you work with, “We should do a podcast 
because it’s cool. Here’s what we talk about in Episode One.” A podcast’s 
agenda, or game plan, or to-do list, should be an idea of what you will want to 
gather around the mics to riff about for at least five shows. If you have ideas 
that go well beyond Episode 10, then you might just be on to something. 
When getting the cast and crew together for your podcast, you will want to 
make sure it is clear what the topic of conversation is. Otherwise, you might 
find yourself recording awkward silence, and that makes for terrible audio.
»
» Make the most of your time together. If the subject matter is not time-
sensitive, or if you have mapped out evergreen topics (subjects of discussion 
that are relevant no matter when they drop in a show’s schedule) for a few 
episodes, then record these episodes in one night. Granted, the ability to 
create a buffer for your podcast will depend on the running time for your 
episodes, but if possible, record several episodes in case schedule conflicts 
occur.
»
» Nominate one person to take the point in a conversation. Usually in 
situations where many hosts are on mic, there should be one person calling 
the plays and prompting others for commentary. In a quick-paced, back-and- 
forth conversation, that might mean the lead host sits back and moderates 
the episode. What matters is that you stay on topic, lest your episode goes 
bouncing off the rails and into the great audio-video abyss. Having a lead 
host — and that position can vary from show to show, depending on the 
topic — will keep you, your cast, and your episode on track.
»
» Invite others to join in on the fun. While there should be core hosts in every 
multi-mic podcast, inviting people to join in only adds to the dynamics of a 
podcast. It could be a formal interview, or better still, it can be an informal 
sit-down where everyone contributes. These sort of round-table discussions 
may open your podcast up for more hosts, or some hosts may offer to pick up 
the mantle for a spinoff podcast — much like in the cast of Tony Mast’s 
Backseat Box Office — out of loyalty to and joy from the podcast. Open mics 
also offer different perspectives and backgrounds, providing your podcast a 
broader scope and reach.

CHAPTER 17  Podcasting for Passion      327
A passionate love for the podcast
All successful podcasters share a true love for the podcast. Something about 
­getting behind the mic and producing quality content is satisfying. That passion 
can tax you, especially if the podcast is an emotional ride; and if a podcast reaches 
a conclusion, it would make sense if the podcast’s host decided to step away from 
the mic for a spell.
However, when you are one of podcasting’s original voices, it is hard not to want 
to podcast, especially when embarking on new adventures overseas.
Such is the story of Evo Terra, a name very familiar in podcasting circles. Evo 
was  one of the original advocates of podcasting, hosting alongside Michael 
R. Mennenga of The Dragon Page in October 2004. He launched Podiobooks.com 
with Chris Miller and Tee Morris, and joined Tee on the first edition of Podcasting 
For Dummies. “One thing we had going for us,” Evo recalls, “is that Mike and I 
were already doing The Dragon Page as a syndicated radio show, both on Internet 
Radio and terrestrial radio since 2002, so we hit the ground running while many 
other podcasters at that time were figuring things out as they went. Many of the 
technical challenges of podcasting gear we already had figured out.”
Evo loved podcasting so much, he brought in his wife, Sheila Unwin, when The 
Dragon Page launched a Y.A.  Fiction spinoff series, The Dragon Page with Class. 
Together, Evo and Sheila podcast on Evo at 11 and The Opportunistic Travelers which 
evolved into This One Time. . .; all three podcasts very different but all three very 
much full of the intellectual snark that Evo and Sheila are known for. “When I was 
asked to deliver the keynote at the very first Podcast Movement event, I was told 
‘You should be podcasting more. . .’ but by then Sheila and I were transitioning to 
leave the country,” Evo recalls. “I had sold most of my equipment, but I had kept 
my H4n, a few cables, and a pair of Shure SM58s. It occurred to me that we needed 
to produce a podcast to explain what we were doing. I had been listening to The 
Startup Podcast with Alex Bloomberg, and I really liked that journalistic style. 
So  during our drive out to California, I broke out the mic and started asking 
Sheila  questions, and that was the first episode of the Opportunistic Travelers 
(www.theopportunistictravelers.com).” As seen in Figure 17-2, The Opportu-
nistic Travelers, while a dramatic change in the kind of podcast Evo was known for, 
still retains his signature of a lighthearted look at life and the world around it.
Sheila’s own love of the podcast took root not on the technical side, but more on 
the content provider side. “When I first started, I was primarily voice talent, and 
it was a lot of fun. Initially, The Dragon Page with Class was an interview show, and 
I really loved the back stories of these books I’ve been reading and how they came 
to be.” After Evo at 11, Sheila believed her podcasting chapter had concluded, until, 
“When we were getting ready to leave the country, Evo said, ‘We’ll update people 
in a blog format,’ and I came back with ‘That doesn’t make any sense. You’re a 

328      PART 5  Pod-sibilities to Consider for Your Show
podcaster. We need to podcast this.’ So we started The Opportunistic Traveler.” Not 
only has podcasting made Sheila a better public speaker and presenter, Sheila 
gives podcasting credit for the close friendships she has cultivated over the years. 
“I have friends all over the world, and I’ve met people at different conferences, all 
of who know me from my appearances on podcasts.”
What keeps both Evo and Sheila podcasting today, on a more personal level, is 
their online dynamic. “Our podcasts are our personalities amped up,” Sheila says. 
Evo agrees. “It’s a project and a platform that we not only can work on together, 
we work on it well together.”
And it doesn’t hurt Evo’s passion at all that it has now become a source of income. 
“The Opportunistic Traveler and then later The Bangkok Podcast — the #1 show 
­produced in Bangkok, Thailand — served as showcase for me. Now I’ve been hired 
to co-host and produce. It’s easier now to get people to pay you to produce 
a  ­podcast because of podcasting’s increased attention recently. As a podcast 
­producer, I am hired to handle strategy, execution, and promotion.”
The desire to continue recording, producing, and uploading shows simply for the 
love of the podcast is not uncommon. Many podcasts are created out of that need. 
These shows and their hosts stand out in their dedication, infusing raw 
­enthusiasm for this medium into every new show. It is this passion that brings 
the podcaster back to the microphone and invites new podcasters (like you!) to 
take the host’s chair.

CHAPTER 17  Podcasting for Passion      329
Holding Interest: Keeping a Podcast’s 
Passion Alive
You have your podcast underway. You’re planning to have a weekly show. The first 
month in, you feel strong, confident. But this is all in the first four episodes. How 
do you keep the momentum going?
In the early days of a podcast, you can easily see yourself continuing banter a year 
from launch date — but remember that schedule you planned? Have you consid-
ered sick days? Vacation? The occasional stumbling block of inertia (“Do I really 
want to do a podcast today?”)? Even the best podcasters need to step away from 
their mics, recharge their batteries, and then jump back into their recording. 
­Personal health, well-being, and time to edit episodes if your episodes need edit-
ing (and if you’re human, sometimes they do) are factors you also must consider. 
Add in dealing with conditions such as background noise and having to tax the 
strength of your voice, and podcasting can become less of a joy and more like a 
chore or a second day-job. Plenty of podcasts begin strong out of the box, only to 
have their feeds go silent, and remain so.
Even with passion, momentum is difficult to sustain. How do podcasters keep that 
spark alive? Well — as with the answers to “Why do we do it?” — podcasters have 
a myriad of opinions and thoughts. Each show applies different tactics to keep 
each new episode fresh; even amid diverse topics, you can find common threads 
between all podcasts that provide the momentum to forge ahead 50 episodes later.
Podcasting on puree: Mixing it up
After you’ve racked up a few episodes of your podcast, look at its format. How do 
you have it set up? Is it all commentary? What can you do to vary the content?
Just because this is your first, second, third  — or seventeenth, eighteenth, or 
nineteenth — episode, that doesn’t mean you’ve set your show in stone. (That’s 
where you find the fossils of all sorts of creatures that didn’t manage to evolve.) 
In this section, we look at ways to dodge that asteroid and keep your show from 
suffering an extinction-level event.
Don’t be afraid to try different things with your podcast’s format. For example,

Technorama, hosted by one of your illustrious authors, has been in a near-constant 
state of evolution since inception in May 2005. It started with a single host and 
acquired a second after only a handful of episodes. Things stayed constant for a 
while, and then its hosts — Chuck Tomasi and Kreg Steppe — added an “On This 
Day in History” segment to the show to review tech, science, and geek events that 
happened in history on the day the show is released.
With the addition of “On This Day in History” segments, Chuck and Kreg started 
experimenting with production elements and other kinds of regularly occurring 
features in the podcast. Soon the show, described as looking at the lighter side of 
technology, started covering odd news in the “Hacks and Strange Stories” seg-
ment and the hosts began scratching their heads at how silly people can get over 
tech with the “What the Chuck?!” segment. Following the wacky wake-up morn-
ing show format, Technorama became a favorite in the podosphere.
Fast-forward through the years (time travel saves belaboring the point), and the 
award-winning show continues to offer something different than its normal fare. 
While taking pride in its lighter look at tech, Technorama has also featured inter-
views with Grant Imahara and Adam Savage of Mythbusters, oceanographer and 
Titanic-discoverer Dr. Bob Ballard, John Chatterton and Richie Kohler of Deep Sea 
Detectives, and renowned physicist Dr. Michio Kaku. The guys have also ventured 
in to video podcasting, on-location recordings, and elaborate audio spoofs, 
including “How Can You Tell He’s a Geek?” (inspired by Monty Python’s “How 
You Can Tell She’s a Witch” sketch) and several parodies inspired by Star Trek, Star 
Wars, and classic TV shows.
Your show may not have to go to elaborate lengths to stay fresh, but it does need 
to heed the creed: Evolve or die. Remember Catherine Cohen’s story about cooking 
a frog mentioned earlier in this chapter — do changes like this slowly and get 
feedback from your audience to see what works.
If you decide your podcast is going to be in a constant state of flux, keep in mind 
that the risk of alienating your listeners is ever present. Podcasting for podcast-
ing’s sake is like improvisational comedy: It’s a skill. You can keep your passion 
alive by continuously changing the format of your show, but you run the risk of 
making your show an acquired taste.

CHAPTER 17  Podcasting for Passion      331
Starting a second (or third) podcast
Keeping the passion alive and well in one podcast can be found in variety, but 
what happens when you are finding yourself cutting off the microphones and still 
having a lot to say? Some podcasters decide to fire up the mics again and keep 
going. Sure, the occasional “super-sized” show isn’t a bad thing, especially if the 
topic is timely and your normal running time can’t cover everything you want or 
need to. What happens, though, when your special super-sized shows are becom-
ing less and less special, but becoming the norm? What if your broad focus on a 
subject matter is becoming more and more focused on one aspect of it? Are you 
willing to risk overloading your podcast’s audience with new content, and possi-
bly burn out you, your co-hosts, and your audience?
It might be time for another podcast.
Okay, that may double your workload. Well, no, it will double your workload; but 
spinoff podcasts allow you to follow this new rabbit hole you’ve discovered while 
keeping the original podcast’s voice true. A new podcast also keeps your perspec-
tives fresh and excited about what unknown discussions you have yet to record for 
upcoming podcasts.
If your gut instinct is telling you to begin a second podcast, go for it. Variety, not 
only in a podcast’s original content but also between the different podcasts you 
create, can benefit both shows. Now, instead of the same old podcast every week, 
you can allow yourself different avenues to explore  — and maybe in the new 
­venture, attract a whole new audience.
Podcaster Jason Gregory Banks, after launching Talk Nerdy 2 Me (branded with its 
signature show art seen in Figure  17-3 and found online at http://
talknerdy2mepodcast.com) in 2012, discovered that while his co-host, Jen, and 
he had a lot to talk about when it came to nerd culture, anime, and comics, one 
podcast was not going to cover it. Along with a long drive between jobs, Jason 
wanted to make the most of his time, so he recorded episodes in his car. “It’s not 
the same quality as Talk Nerdy 2 Me, I admit,” Jason says, “but I’m more about the 
content and the quality of it than audio clarity; and my portable recorder is reli-
able, so no worries.” The Talk Nerdy 2 Me brand expanded to the following offer-
ings, all carrying the same signature wit and wisdom Jason and Jen established in 
the original show:
»
» Anime 101 (http://talknerdy2mepodcast.com/podcasts/anime-101): 
For anyone curious about the animated offerings coming from across the 
Pacific, Jason offers Anime 101, a deep dive into anime both familiar to 
mainstream audiences and unknown but worth your time and attention.

»
» Nerds on Cinema (http://talknerdy2mepodcast.com/podcasts/nerds- 
on-cinema): If you are more into movies, Nerds on Cinema offers everything 
from reviews to the homegrown commentary track for what’s new on Blu-ray 
and DVD. Nerds on Cinema also hosts every October the “Halloween Horrorfest” 
where the TN2M crew releases 31 consecutive days of podcasts.
»
» Talking Comics (http://talknerdy2mepodcast.com/podcasts/talking- 
comics): Talking Comics is TN2M’s exclusive platform for all things Marvel, DC, 
Dark Horse, Valiant, IDW, and other comic creators.
»
» Big Bear’s Den (http://talknerdy2mepodcast.com/podcasts/big- 
bears-den): Jason’s podcast encapsulating random thoughts, short fiction, 
and other inspirations better-suited for its own home outside of the main 
podcast.
“I produce a lot of content,” Jason states, “and Jen and I know each show has its 
own audience. Some people just want the anime show. That’s fine. Some just want 
Nerds on Cinema. That’s fine. But there are those listeners who want it all,” and 
that makes him smile. “This is why we offer a master feed where everything goes. 
So long as people are listening, I’ll keep podcasting.”
Meanwhile, out on the West Coast, The Wekk Podcast (http://wekkpodcast.com) 
launched in February 2015, intending to be a podcast about all things geek. Not an 
uncommon theme for podcasts (see the East Coast’s Talk Nerdy 2 Me above), and 
the show’s hosts  — Katy, Kellie, Kevin, and Mandy  — originally planned for 
weekly conversations on various geek interests ranging from books to board 
games to box office offerings. Their first episode featured the B-17: Queen of the 
FIGURE 17-3: 
Talk Nerdy 2 Me is 
more than just 
one podcast —  
it’s a network 
of podcasts.

CHAPTER 17  Podcasting for Passion      333
Skies board game, Rachel Morgan’s Creepy Hollow series, and Mr. Kiss and Tell by 
Rob Thomas and Jennifer Graham. So their adventure into podcasting began . . .
. . . but then Katy, Kellie, Kevin, and Mandy found themselves with a backlog of 
geeky conversations they wanted to have, but could not carve out the time in the 
original Wekk Podcast. This inspired the crew to produce and feature in the same 
feed their first spinoff, Wekk Whovians, a podcast where hosts and guests could 
delve more into Doctor Who lore. Its success inspired the podcast team to create 
other spinoffs that dropped into the Wekk’s feed, giving the listener the option to 
listen or skip. Growing Up 70’s is the Wekk-produced nostalgia podcast that looks 
back on the 1970’s and its eclectic entertainment of the day. Wekk Conversations is 
their interview show, featuring authors, podcasters, and other interviews keen to 
the Wekk hosts’ interests. Beer, Books, and Tea is their book club offering reviews 
and discussions of literature over a nice Lapsang or lager. And finally, there is 
Little Things where the cast share those tiny victories that brighten a day. With so 
many podcasts under the Wekk umbrella, the original podcast continues to get its 
own episodes out, remaining true to its original concept while offering “bonus” 
content for those who want it.
If you’re thinking about branching out with a new show, consider these tips:
»
» Take your audience with you. If you’re podcasting about triathlons, yet hold 
a secret passion for seventh-century Gaelic text, expect only a handful of folks 
to subscribe to both shows. However, if you move from triathlons to a podcast 
on sports medicine, they may find the new topic an easier pill to swallow.
»
» Cross-promote. Even if your podcasts are quite close in scope, there will be 
listeners to one who aren’t aware of the other. Although we caution against 
turning one podcast into a giant commercial for the other, plug the heck out 
of your other show. Within reason.
»
» Look for the niche within the niche. If your main topic is broad, break it out 
into chunks and see what needs further exploration. Granted, a deep dive into 
the minutiae of a niche topic may reduce the size of your listening audience. 
But so what? This is about exploring your passion, not about gaining market 
share. And (we promise) there’s always someone else out there who will want 
you to delve even deeper into the obscure topic you’ve just built an entire 
podcast around.
»
» Keep trying. Don’t expect to hit your stride in the new show by Episode 2. You 
must try different formats, flavors, and ideas, just the way you did to make 
your first podcast perfect. (Or is it? Maybe it’s getting a little stale. Time to 
spruce that one up, too. See the following section.)

334      PART 5  Pod-sibilities to Consider for Your Show
When enjoying the journey of your first podcast, keep in mind that your next 
­podcast may be closer than you think. Keep a close eye on your feedback; look for 
recurring themes that your audience likes to hear. If it’s a broad enough topic and 
you can speak on it with authority, you may be able to craft a show around audi-
ence suggestions instead of having to sweat bullets to come up with something 
brand new every time.
Moving forward with a plan
Reinvention for the sake of reinvention isn’t a bad idea, but it’s so 20th century. 
You may find it a better idea to move forward with a plan for your rebranding, 
your reformatting, or your spinoff podcasts. So here are a few dos and don’ts —  
with the don’ts first.
WHO’S UP FOR A CHALLENGE?
Kreg Steppe, Chuck’s co-host on Technorama, came up with a great idea in 2012. He 
challenged podcasters to publish a podcast a day for the month of August. He called his 
challenge “The Dog Days of Podcasting” (http://dogdaysofpodcasting.com). His 
idea was to get back to the roots of podcasting (late 2004 and early 2005), theoretically 
where there were so few shows that all the podcasters seemed to be listening to each 
other’s show and had cross-show conversations with each other. Something said on 
one show would get a response on another show. The early few months of podcasting 
really was a more intimate group. Kreg’s goal was to recapture some of that community. 
The first year or two there were only a half dozen or so podcasters who joined in. It was 
easy to subscribe to all of them and keep up with each thread. However, in recent years, 
the group has grown to many times its original size and listening to every single episode 
of the show has become somewhat of a new challenge. Some of the nostalgia is hearing 
from some of the original podcasters from 2004 to 2005 and hearing new voices. In fact, 
some people like Amy Bowen and Charlotte Kennedy have used the Dog Days challenge 
to launch their own podcasts. Proving that you don’t need a decade of experience or 
lots of technology to be part of this challenge. Kreg has made it easy to listen to all the 
podcasts without having to subscribe to each show individually with a “master feed” 
which includes all episode for all shows during the annual challenge.

CHAPTER 17  Podcasting for Passion      335
What NOT to do (Ack! Run away! Run away!):
»
» Don’t use shock-radio techniques. Hearing a podcaster drop a few words 
that would make most grandmothers blush isn’t anything new, and it’s a 
cheap way to get a laugh and attention. We personally don’t have any moral 
compunction against the more colorful aspects of the English language. If 
that’s your style, don’t change it; otherwise, try to use them sparingly, okay?
»
» Don’t swing between kid-friendly and adults-only. If you’re unhappy being 
a family show, give some notice so folks can unsubscribe. Hell hath no fury 
like a mother scorned (or even unpleasantly surprised).
»
» Don’t get angry when you get dissenting email. Not everyone will be 
happy with your decision to change things around or to add a new segment. 
Deal with it and move on. You can’t please everyone — or “correct” others’ 
­opinions — so don’t even try.
What to DO with all your might:
»
» Cast your net wide. Be open to a variety of new ideas and concepts and don’t 
be afraid to try them out on your audience. Your loyal listeners will likely 
forgive you a few miscues along the way.
»
» Have a purpose for the change or addition. Find the common connection 
with what your show has focused on before and talk to your audience about it. 
You can do this before or after the “newness” goes in the show, but your 
listeners will enjoy knowing the method behind your madness.
»
» Encourage feedback about the change. When you do this, ask more than 
“do you like it?” Find out whether your audience members feel differently 
about your show, if they think it’s “fresher” or perhaps more appealing — and 
ask why. The changes you put in place are designed to give your show a 
boost; be sure and ask for confirmation that it actually happened!
If you find yourself in need of a break, there’s nothing wrong with taking some 
time out. As a courtesy to those who are listening, however — whether it’s 20 or 
20,000 — let them know you’re holding off on new episodes for a few weeks so 
you can reorganize priorities, goals, and the whole momentum of your podcast to 
make it even more rewarding for them to listen to. The same courtesy applies 
when you’ve had an unexpected illness: Give your listenership a quick update on 
what happened; reassure them that your voice is back and that your podcast is 
back. As passionate as you may be about a podcast, always remember your health 
and your voice must come first. There’s nothing wrong with missing a week or 
two of a podcast while you get back up to par.

336      PART 5  Pod-sibilities to Consider for Your Show
When Podcasting, Be like Bruce Lee
“To me, ultimately, martial art means honestly expressing yourself. Now it is 
very difficult to do. I mean it is easy for me to put on a show and be cocky and 
be flooded with a cocky feeling and then feel, then, like pretty cool. . . and be 
blinded by it. Or I can show you some fancy movement. But, to express oneself 
honestly, not lying to oneself — and to express myself honestly — that, my 
friend, is very hard to do.”
— BRUCE LEE, FROM AN INTERVIEW ON THE PIERRE BURTON SHOW
When Tee was writing the first draft of this chapter back in 2006, he had playing 
in the background Bruce Lee: The Way of the Warrior, a (really cool) documentary 
featuring recently discovered footage from Bruce Lee’s then-work-in-progress 
Game of Death, rare commentary from The Dragon himself, and interview footage. 
In one of the interviews came the preceding quote — a compelling moment when 
Bruce Lee sums up, in his own words, what the martial arts mean from his per-
spective. As Tee pondered his words, it struck him that Bruce was basically saying, 
Martial arts are all about keeping it real.
And (for whatever reason) he blurted out loud, “If Bruce Lee were alive today, he 
would have a podcast!”
Part of the passion in a podcast is cultivating honesty with yourself and your 
audience, and that honesty in your podcast is what keeps listeners coming back. 
“To thine own self be true . . .” — one of Shakespeare’s most-quoted lines from 
Hamlet — holds as true for podcasting as it has for every other intensely personal 
creative activity; let it serve as a mantra that fires up your drive to produce a 
­terrific podcast. Honest passion, and honesty in general, cannot be faked in a 
podcast because many podcasters are producing their audio content without any 
other compensation save for ratings on various directories and analytics through 
Google, some feedback from listeners, and perhaps a Patreon donation. On 
the  larger scale, podcasters, regardless of their agendas or goals, are on the 
­podcasting scene because they want to be there, and if that honesty in wanting to 
deliver new content is even remotely artificial, listeners will lose interest in your 
podcast.
It’s okay to ask yourself, before hitting Record, “Do I know for sure what I’m 
­getting into?” — or, more to the point, “Do I really want to do this?” — but never 
ask yourself whether you can do this. That isn’t even a question to consider. 
­Podcasting welcomes voices of all backgrounds, all professions, all experience 
levels (be they professional, semiprofessional, or amateur). You can do this — and 

CHAPTER 17  Podcasting for Passion      337
you have as much right to as any of us. All you need is a mic, an application, a feed, 
and a server host. From there, it all rests on you. And once you start podcasting, 
produce your podcast because you want to, not because you have to.
Podcasting is a commitment of time and resources — to yourself and to your lis-
teners. It’s a promise you make to bring to the podosphere the best content you 
can produce — and with the right support, passion, and drive, your podcast will 
evolve, mature, and move ahead with the same zeal that inspired the first episode. 
Accomplishing this feat rests on remaining honest in your desire to sit behind the 
microphone and produce your next show. If you’re not sure about the answers to 
“Do I know for sure what I’m getting into?” or “Do I really want to do this?” ask 
yourself, “If I don’t want to be here, then why would listeners want to hear my 
latest episode?”
“To express myself honestly — that, my friend is very hard to do.” Tee believed 
back in 2006 Bruce Lee would have produced an incredible podcast.
Ten years later, Tee got his wish realized as Bruce Lee’s daughter launched the 
Bruce Lee Podcast over at http://www.brucelee.com/podcast in 2016. Lee’s 
­philosophy and disciplines, reviewed weekly.
And yes, it’s an incredible podcast.

A
h yes, narrowing down the thousands upon thousands upon thousands of 
podcasts out there to an elite ten: The Top Ten Podcasts You Should Be 
Listening To. The Best of the Best. The Select Few to Follow.
No pressure.
Where to begin? Where to begin? With each edition of Podcasting For Dummies, 
your humble authors sat down and put together our own top ten lists of podcasts, 
and here’s what we have noticed: There are a lot of podcasts out there. While 
some of our listening habits have remained steady and constant as the North 
Star, our taste can sometimes shift into unexpected offerings . . . which if you 
listen to Astronomy Cast, you would know Polaris is not that constant. We have 
found, over our years of podcasting, that we listen to a solid cross-section of types 
of podcasts, not just in the way of genres but in production values. So, with a 
quick edit of the outline and a change of mindset, we present Ten Types of Pod-
casts to Check Out.

342      PART 6  The Part of Tens
There are other kinds of podcasts that are, perhaps, not showcased here; but with 
these ten kinds of podcasts as a starting point, you can easily begin to fill your 
media player with a variety of offerings. When you’re comfortable with what you 
hear, you can then follow podcasts that podcasters will recommend. Feeling even 
braver, you can delve into the many directories out there, some of which offer 
suggestions based on your listening habits.
Here’s your starting point for podcasts to seek out and consume. We are confident 
that from the list given in this chapter, you can sample a wide cross-section 
of interests, passions, and projects. Relax, download, and give your eyes and ears 
a treat.
Always check podcasting directories to see how active these shows are before you 
subscribe. The podcasts in this section are constantly changing. They were actively 
producing content when we wrote this book, but printed material is never as up to 
date as a good podcast directory.
Tech Podcasts
If you’re thinking about podcasting, you likely have a comfortable knowledge of 
computers, the Internet, and blogging. But regardless of how technologically 
savvy you are, like any aspect of life, you can never stop learning. That’s why your 
aggregator should be catching at least one tech podcast.
The agenda for a tech podcast is (surprise!) technology. All geek, all the time. 
Geeks, nerds, wizards, and Tech Help gurus sit behind a microphone and pull back 
the curtain on how your computer works, how a podcast’s RSS feed can be better, 
and how to make your time behind the keyboard more efficient.
Tech podcasts come delivered to you in a variety of skill levels and on a variety of 
topics:
»
» Macs: Some excellent podcasts for Mac users include The Mac Observer’s 
Apple Context Machine (shown in Figure 18-1 and available at https://www.
macobserver.com/show/apple-context-machine) and the iMore Show 
(http://www.imore.com/podcasts), or for the more retro Mac user Open 
Apple (www.open-apple.net) that covers all things Apple II.

» PCs: Windows Insider Program (http://windowsinsider.mpsn.libsynpro.
com) is an ambitious effort spearheaded by Windows Insider chief Dona 
Sarkar to podcast updates from within the Windows Insider community.

The MSPoweruser Podcast (https://mspoweruser.com/podcast) is more 
end-user/consumer focused to help you be more productive on your PC (and 
all things Microsoft).
»
» General computing: Many of the tech podcasts out there like This Week in 
Tech (or TWiT, as it is so lovingly referred as by its hosts and listeners, available 
at www.twit.tv/twit) or Daily Tech News Show (www.dailytechnewsshow.
com) are generic in their approach to operating systems, following a mindset 
that a computer is a computer and the rest is mostly bells and whistles.
»
» Technology perspectives: Computer Talk Radio (http://computertalk 
radio.com) and Technorama (http://www.chuckchat.com/technorama) 
give personal and (in many cases) lighthearted perspectives on technology in 
society and go beyond the geek-speak, giving their own perspectives on issues 
and how technology can affect just about everything.
Whichever podcast you feed into your podcatching client, find a tech podcast 
that’s right for you and either enjoy the new perspective or allow yourself to grow 
into your geekdom. There is a lot to learn about computers, smartphones, the 
Internet of Things, and other cool Q Branch gizmos that are available at your local 
electronics store. When you have the basics down, these podcasts allow you to 
unlock their potential and go beyond your expectations.

Independent Media Podcasts
Podcasting is audio and video content on demand, and after taking in what is being 
offered on the radio, that is a very good thing. Maybe it’s a hazard of getting older, 
but some of us just aren’t hearing anything on the air that’s all that interesting or 
exciting. Unless you are really into auto-tune or hungry for yet another hacker- 
crime-investigation-unit-comprised-of-incredibly-pretty-­people series.
The good news is that media mavericks are alive and well and doing just fine in 
the 21st century, finding a new promotion channel with podcasting.
Independent labels, where the artists also work as promoters, producers, and 
holders-of-all-rights, have control over where their music plays, how often it is 
played, and how much it will cost you. Many indie musicians who are having 
trouble getting exposure and radio airplay will grant permission for podcasters to 
use their music. What does this cost the podcaster? A few moments of time and a 
spot or two, such as, “This music is brought to you by . . .” and “Visit this band 
online at w-w-w-dot . . .” And in return, the musician is exposed to a worldwide 
audience.
Musicians such as The Gentle Readers, Michelle Malone (both featured on Evil 
Genius Chronicles at www.evilgeniuschronicles.org), George Hrab, and Rubber 
Band Banjo (both featured on Tee’s Parsec-winning podcast Billibub Baddings and 
The Case of the Singing Sword) have all enjoyed the benefits of associating them-
selves with a podcast. Catching wind of this, indie artists of all backgrounds are 
turning to podcasts to spotlight their independent works whose vision might go 
against the corporate entertainment industry’s notion of “what the public wants.” 
Here are few such podcasts you may want to check out:
»
» Welcome to Night Vale (www.welcometonightvale.com): Best described as 
A Prairie Home Companion meets The Twilight Zone and known for its quirky, 
sometimes sinister storytelling, the popular podcast has proven itself a 
fantastic platform for independent label music. Whenever Cecil announces 
the Night Vale weather report, listeners are treated to music from artists 
such as Anais Mitchell, Robin Aigner, daKAH Hip Hop Orchestra, Destroyer, 
Daniel Knox, Toys and Tiny Instruments, and Eliza Rickman, just to 
name a few.
»
» Irish & Celtic Music Podcast (http://celticmusicpodcast.com): Celebrated 
musician Marc Gunn hosts The Irish & Celtic Music Podcast. It’s all in the title. 
Marc offers his podcast as a spotlight for the best in Irish and Celtic culture 
and sound; and with over 20,000 downloads per episode, multiple wins for

» Making Movies is HARD!!! (http://spindryproductions.com/podcast

of video podcasting, YouTube, and other online video providers — is embracing 
podcasting platforms as not only a place to promote but a place to educate. 
Making Movies is HARD!!! (shown in Figure 18-2), hosted by Timothy Plain and 
Alrik Bursell, discusses independent filmmaking, but not just shooting and 
editing a film. Timothy and Alrik deep dive into all aspects of filmmaking. 
Writing. Producing. Directing. Even how you take care of your cast and crew. 
Timothy and Alrik also cover the downsides of making movies: hours of 
investment, rejection, lost opportunities, self-doubt. It’s all here.

» Film Trooper (http://filmtrooper.com): Scott McMahon, following two 
decades of working in the entertainment industry through gaming, film, TV, 
and video production, delved into independent filmmaking, creating for $500 
a short film called The Cube. Now, he hosts Film Trooper, a resource for 
up-and-coming filmmakers who want to know more about the business. Film 
Trooper features interviews with performers, directors, musicians, and other 
creative minds involved in making independent movies as well as step-by-step 
tutorials on how to get your movie from concept to cinema screen.

Science Podcasts
The approach to science made popular by Bill Nye the Science Guy, Mr. Wizard, 
and the Mythbusters, is rampant in the podosphere. Here are some science pod-
casts that we recommend:
»
» Astronomy Cast (http://astronomycast.com): If you’ve always wondered 
about what’s really going on beyond our atmosphere, take a listen to a 
podcast descendant of Carl Sagan’s Cosmos concept. For those who would 
never leave the planet without their attitude, Fraser Cane and Dr. Pamela Gay 
dubbed the show Astronomy Cast.
»
» Skepticality (http://skepticality.com): This Parsec-winning podcast looks 
deeper into the news too weird for mainstream media, and it takes a critical 
microscope to the pseudoscience of the paranormal, the supernatural, close 
encounters, and urban legends.
»
» The Brain Science Podcast (http://brainsciencepodcast.com): When it 
comes to the human brain and its mechanics, Dr. Ginger Campbell, MD, 
knows her way around it. The Brain Science Podcast features the latest books 
about neuroscience as well as interviews with leading scientists from around 
the world. Neuroscience, you might think, would appeal to a niche audience;

deep dive into the human psyche and its reaction to games like Destiny, Zelda,

tion at how people game, and analyzes the way gaming, game mechanics, and 
gaming concepts impact behavior, emotion, and social interaction.

Science shows are good for you — like vegetables, only better. Not only can you 
learn something new or broaden your scope in a field you may regard as a hobby, 
but you can marvel at how the hosts demystify concepts once comprehensible 
only to PhDs and keep the ideas easy to grasp.
Self-Development Podcasts
Why not broaden your horizons — personal or professional — with podcasting? 
For example, say you’ve always wanted to learn Spanish. You could shell out some 
bucks for the “Teach Yourself Spanish” series, or you could to listen to the free 
SpanishPod101 podcast (https://www.spanishpod101.com). SpanishPod101 is a 
podcast that is part of a multiple device approach across PDFs, online forums, and 
smart devices that culminates into a survival guide for a new language. With 
its podcast as the first step, SpanishPod101 helps you navigate situations at the 
­restaurant, at the bank, or if your car breaks down.
If you aren’t interested in learning another language, look at some of the other 
subjects offered in the podosphere. Here are just a few examples of what’s 
available:
»
» Education: Podcasts can be like your favorite class after the bell has rung, 
offering material completely devoted to what you might not have heard while 
in middle and high school. Stuff You Missed in History Class (http://www.
missedinhistory.com), hosted by Tracy V. Wilson and Holly Frey, offers 
details behind Lady Jane Grey, Executive Order 9066, or comedians Abbott & 
Costello, each episode an in-depth look at events from our past. Instead of 
history, you want to know the origins of stories like “The Legend of Sleepy 
Hollow,” Aladdin and His Wonderful Lamp, or King Arthur and the Knights of the 
Round Table (including Camelot, a silly place). This means Myths & Legends 
(http://www.mythpodcast.com) is the podcast you need to subscribe to.

» Career Development: Are you looking to make a jump from working stiff 
to corporate raider? Have a listen to Mechanic to Millionaire (http://www.
mechanictomillionaire.com), a podcast about making the right steps forward 
in a career no matter what place in the office you occupy. For female entrepre-
neurs, the She Did It Her Way podcast (http://shediditherwaypodcast.com) 
features interviews with risk-takers who worked hard to bring their ideas to 
reality. And when it comes to incredible visionaries — Elon Musk, Norman 
Lear, and Michelle Obama, to name a few — the TED Talks podcasts (http://
www.ted.com/talks) offer up all kinds of great career advice from those who 
shape the world.

» Personal Development: TED Talks don’t just stop at Career Development (as 
there are many podcasts TED produces), but also help you better yourself and 
your life. Are you looking to change your eating habits or maybe just find calm 
within the stress of daily life? Podcasting can bring a healthy alternative to your 
current digital lifestyle, and maybe even lower blood pressure and cholesterol 
points in the process. To find a bit of health and harmony in your life, give The 
Ultimate Health Podcast (http://ultimatehealthpodcast.com) or The Healthy 
Moms Podcast (https://wellnessmama.com/podcast) a listen. Get more

There is a lot to learn from the world, and whether you’re tuning in to one of 
numerous podcasts sponsored by universities and colleges or to an enthusiast who 
wants to share and swap resources with you, all this continuing education is 
available online, in audio, and at no charge.
Comedy Podcasts
There are times in life when you just need a good laugh. A real bonus with comedy 
podcasts is having those good laughs categorized, digitized, and waiting for you, 
only a tap or click away.
Humor, though, is in the eye of the beholder and the ear of the listener. Perform-
ing a search on “Comedy Podcasts” will offer you many, many choices, ranging 
from kid-safe comedy to performing arts to adults-only discussions with an 
irreverent approach. Comedy covers a lot of ground, but straight-up comedy pod-
casts are not intended to do anything other than entertain.
The way these podcasts make you laugh covers a wide spectrum of how humor is 
defined. Here are a few comedy podcasts that we enjoy:
»
» The Bitterest Pill (http://thebitterestpill.com): Perhaps you like your 
humor dry, witty, and maybe just a touch smarmy. Dan Klass and his award-
winning podcast, The Bitterest Pill, shown in Figure  18-5, should do the trick. 
With his background in stand-up comedy and over a decade of podcasting 
under his belt, Dan’s delivery is edgy and relentless. He takes a hard, cold look 
at the world and makes observations that you might think but would not have 
the courage to express openly. Dan not only gives you his opinions but also 
podcasts them for the world to hear.

» Comedy4Cast (www.comedy4cast.com): The unpredictability from 
Comedy4Cast’s host, Clinton, is one of the elements that adds charm to the 
show. Sometimes you get a tongue-in-cheek review of an electronic gadget, 
another time you hear a parody of another popular podcast, or Clinton could 
be offering a comedy serial. Whatever is on the menu provided by cast and 
crew, Comedy4Cast has but one goal: having you pull over to the side of the 
road so you don’t drive in to the ditch, or setting the hot coffee aside so as not 
to spit it on your keyboard. DISCLAIMER: Comedy4Cast is not responsible for 
damages incurred while listening.

interviews that center around people’s genuine struggles, both in New York 
City and in the world. Alison Rosen Is Your New Best Friend has been described 
as a marriage between Seinfeld and Charlie Rose, but Rosen considers her 
podcast as a chronicle of daily life and how we tend to laugh at what we as

Slice-of-Life Podcasts
Comedy is prevalent in all the various genres of podcasting, especially with the 
podcasts that just take a look at life and give it a perspective. Sometimes you need 
humor to deal with loved ones, life’s unexpected pitfalls, or just the world on a 
whole. Slice-of-Life podcasts offer audiences a chance to laugh at the headlines, 
slow down with an in-depth look at a specific topic, or offer a look at a lifestyle. 
The subjects covered are varied, but the podcasts serve as windows into the hosts’ 
world. True, most podcasts are; but in these podcasts, it’s about the moment, the 
here and now, and what is happening in their lives. From this casual and candid 
approach comes a podcast that might make you laugh, might make you cry, and 
maybe — just maybe — make you think.

Rowe, best known for his snarky-but-sincere approach to America’s working 
force in Dirty Jobs, brings all his dry wit and endless charm to The Way I Heard It. 
This podcast tells new and slightly unexpected stories of celebrities, history, 
and icons of culture, passed on from person to person, generation to genera-
tion. It’s a quick listen — usually under ten minutes per episode — and 
guaranteed to make you smile.

» Note to Self (www.wnyc.org/shows/notetoself): Produced by WNYC 
Studios, Manoush Zomorodi hosts a weekly look at the boundaries between 
connecting online and connecting with the real world. This may sound like a 
podcast better suited for our Tech Podcasts section, but Manoush’s podcast is 
more about how our culture and its values — privacy, empathy, personal 
relationships, and perception of current events — are affected by technology. 
Note to Self emphasizes the importance of remaining human while taking 
advantage of the latest digital innovations.
As it goes with slice-of-life podcasts, the general content can go in any way: 
G, PG-13, to “What did they just say?!” Always check the podcasts’ listings (in direc-
tories or on their websites) for an “Explicit” tag to see how “playfully blunt” 
these podcasts can get.

Gaming Podcasts
You might think that podcasts about games and gaming would be something bet-
ter suited for the Slice-of-Life, Geek, or Comedy sections, depending on how 
lively these style of podcasts get. Long-form and serialized productions of friends 
gathering together to crawl through a dungeon, claim the title of King of Tokyo, or 
share strategies and latest news from World of Warcraft or Minecraft stand in a class 
all their own. Gaming podcasts are quite popular, and the skill levels featured on 
these podcasts range from the professionals appearing on the circuit to the nov-
ices purely in it for the fun.

» ESPORTS Podcast (www.espn.com/espnradio/podcast/archive/_/id/ 
16788274): You may not believe that eSports — professional teams with 
such names as Cloud9, Evil Geniuses, and Digital Chaos that come together to 
play video games — is a thing, but it is. It is a serious thing. So serious that 
ESPN Radio hosts the ESPORTS Podcast, featuring interviews with outstanding 
athletes from the digital octagon, latest news and results from recent 
tournaments, and breakdowns of how teams performed.
»
» Dumbbells & Dragons (http://dumbbellsanddragons.com): When it comes 
to Dungeons & Dragons and other role-playing games, a stereotype has 
developed over the years of players consuming pizza, Cheetos, and Mountain 
Dew — personal fitness is not viewed as a priority when it comes to looting a 
necromancer’s chamber for treasure. However, there are gamers who care 
about health, exercise, and diet, and how taking care of yourself makes you a 
better player. That was Kenny Rotter’s intention with Dumbbells & Dragons, a 
podcast combining his love of Tough Mudders with casting magic missiles. 
With many others contributing to Kenny’s world where fitness and nerdiness 
collide, Dumbbells & Dragons strives to live up to the podcast’s popular theme, 
“Work out. Nerd out.”

» The Steamrollers Adventure Podcast (http://riggstories.com/the- 
podcast): Michael J. Rigg loves to write. Michael J. Rigg loves role-playing 
games. And Michael J. Rigg loves steampunk. When Mike wrote his debut 
novel, Clockwork Looking Glass, he wanted to delve even deeper into his 
world, but invite his friends along for the ride. This inspired Mike to design a 
d20-style role-playing game around his steampunk universe. The Steamrollers 
Adventure Podcast provides an immersive RPG experience for its audience as 
Mike provides music and sound effects associated with events in-game. There 
is also a lot of inappropriate humor peppered throughout which has been 
known to happen during RPG sessions, but “Storycrafter Mike” keeps the 
action going as he pulls his friends and special guests deeper into a 
Wonderland of his own making.

» Happy Hour from the Tower (www.happyhourfromthetower.com): If you enjoy 
video games, you have a lot of podcasts to choose from. There are podcasts 
that just talk about console gaming on a whole, and then you have podcasts 
that focus on one game like Halo, Mass Effect, or Call of Duty. Then there’s Happy 
Hour from the Tower (shown in Figure 18-6), hosted by Tee Morris, Ron Dauphin, 
Nick Kelly, and Brandon Kelly. The hosts may not be the best players at Bungie’s 
science fiction, first person shooter Destiny, but they genuinely love the game, 
the lore behind it, and their own experiences within it. Happy Hour from the 
Tower also features the latest news from Bungie, gameplay video, and original 
fiction. If you are wanting more after listening to these Guardians, have a listen 
to other Destiny-centric podcasts like Destiny Reset, DCP: The Destiny Community 
Podcast, Fireteam Chat, or R2O: Return to Orbit.
Podcasts of the Pen
As you know, Tee stepped into podcasting with an idea no author had yet set out 
to do: serialize a novel in podcasts. When the podcast of MOREVI ended for Tee in 
the summer of 2005, he looked at the audio equipment he had and asked himself, 
“So . . . what do I do now?” By this time, there were a few writerly podcasts out

there all talking about the craft of writing, but there were no active podcasts on the 
business of writing books. To fill this void, Tee launched in September 2005 
The Survival Guide to Writing Fantasy, a podcast about the everyday operations of a 
writing career.
The last episode of The Survival Guide to Writing Fantasy aired in 2009, but many 
more podcasts have appeared that cover all aspects of writing from the business

happening in the publishing industry, and go into what is happening with 
their individual works as well. Whenever possible, Tee and Pip bring guests

Geek Podcasts
If you have ever attended a Comic Con or a science fiction-fantasy-horror conven-
tion, you may have witnessed first-hand passionate individuals who love to talk 
about their favorite movie, television show, or game. Or maybe you caught a live 
interview with an actress or writer that you love, and heard that Nathan Fillion is 
a comic book nerd or that Erin Grey is big into Tai Chi. Truly one of the joys of 
podcasting is capturing good laughs between friends, luminaries, and a room full 
of fellow geeks attending a con and riffing on the mics.
This is the joy you hear in these podcasts. A love and a passion for all things geek.

SOMETIMES, OPPORTUNITY PRESENTS 
ITSELF. TAKE IT.
This is Tee Morris and Jack Mangan interviewing Battlestar Galactica’s Richard Hatch in 
February 2006 at Farpoint, a science fiction convention in Baltimore, Maryland. You’ll 
notice that Richard is wearing a coat. He wasn’t cold. He had a plane to catch, but he 
made time before leaving to sit down and talk on the mic about his experience between 
the BSG of the 1970s and of the 2000s. With Battlestar Galactica being a hot property 
once again, it was a real treat for Tee and Jack, two fans of both renditions of the 
epic space opera, for Richard to give them time, but how did they do it? How did two 
podcasters — at a time when podcasting was still a new media — land an interview with 
one of BSG’s regular players?
Simple: Tee and Jack asked.
We go into more detail on approaching people about interviews in Chapter 6, but there 
are those opportunities that present themselves in the moment. There is nothing wrong 
with asking experts and special guests relevant to your podcast’s subject matter if they 
would like to take a few minutes to talk. There is a strong possibility that this favorite 
writer, actor, performer, or comic book artist will have time to sit down for a few min-
utes to talk, but you will never know if you don’t ask. The worst thing a potential guest 
on your podcast could say to you is “No.”
But if they say “yes” then be ready to go. And as we say in Chapter 6, be ready with solid, 
intelligent questions. Then let the magic happen.

Top Ten Reasons 
Why to Podcast
“P
 
 
odcasting is just a fad.”
“I’ve listened to a few podcasts, and I’m not impressed.”
“This is nothing more than streaming media, and that really hasn’t gone anywhere.”
The naysayers of podcasting (especially those who have no idea what it is, have 
never listened to one, but are the first to dismiss it) have a plethora of reasons why 
podcasting will fail or never really catch on in mainstream media.
And yet, here we are a decade later  — naysayers still talking smack about 
podcasting, even though podcasting is more popular than ever.
We podcast for a great many reasons. You have heard us talk about those reasons, 
but this chapter — this final word from your authors — is our hard sell. We love 
doing this. We returned to Podcasting For Dummies because we enjoy podcasting 
that much. Heck, Tee launched a brand new podcast right after completing the first 

360      PART 6  The Part of Tens
deadline for this book, Chuck started a new Star Trek podcast called The Topic is Trek 
(http://thetopicistrek.com) during final edits, and Chuck and Tee are resur-
recting another podcast after finishing this edition!
So, yeah — there is something to podcasting, and there are some good reasons to 
jump into the podosphere with us.
Here are a few (ten, to be exact) reasons why.
You Are Considered a Subject  
Matter Expert
Guy Kawasaki is a name you should know in social media circles. As if his time 
with Apple Computers (where his team was responsible for the marketing of the 
Macintosh back in 1984), his New York Times bestselling titles (like The Art of Social 
Media, The Art of the Start 2.0, Reality Check, and Rules for the Revolutionaries), and 
how his blogs remain in the Top 100 visited blogs in the world wasn’t enough to 
make him a name in tech circles, Kawasaki has cemented himself as something of 
an oracle when it comes to influencing, both online and in the walking world. 
Some of his advice? Rock solid. Other bits of it? Worth questioning. However, in 
one of his most loved/hated of blogposts, “Looking for Mr. Goodtweet” (https://
guykawasaki.com/looking-for-m-1), Kawasaki had this to say:
“Establish yourself as a subject expert. One thing is for sure about Twitter: There 
are some people interested in every subject and every side of every subject. By 
establishing yourself as a subject expert, you will make yourself interesting to 
some subset of people.”
Yes, Kawasaki is talking about Twitter but this rule does apply to podcasting quite 
aptly. When you launch a podcast, you are establishing yourself as a voice in the 
subject matter of your podcasting. When it comes to writing, Joanna Penn on The 
Creative Penn brings her experience as a New York Times and USA Today bestseller 
along with her own experiences promoting her works and her brand. The Spy Cast 
(https://www.spymuseum.org/multimedia/spycast), shown in Figure 19-1, the 
official podcast of the International Spy Museum, was started by and hosted for 
years by ISM’s Executive Directory and 36-year spy veteran Peter Earnest. When 
Peter decided to step down he wanted to ensure the expertise remained so he 
turned the mic over to Dr. Vince Houghton, historian and curator at the museum, 
his specialty being in intelligence, diplomatic, and military history, with expertise 
in late World War II and the early Cold War. Then you have Cliff Ravenscroft, the 

CHAPTER 19  Top Ten Reasons Why to Podcast      361
Podcast Answer Man (http://podcastanswerman.com), who started his journey 
with podcasting over 500 episodes ago and he continues to help others find their 
feet in media production.
When you launch a podcast, you speak with the voice of authority. You speak as an 
expert in your field, as someone who has a proven track record and an individual 
who knows a thing or two about the topic of discussion. Speak with confidence. 
You have a lot to say, and what you have to say makes a lot of sense.
You Are Passionate about the Subject
You may not be the world’s greatest gamer. You may not be the best at crafting 
costumes. You may not be the world’s fastest runner. But if you are passionate 
about a sport, if you are passionate about creative endeavors, if you are passionate 
about a board, card, or console game, then yes, you should be podcasting about it.
It is a reoccurring theme in this book, and it bears repeating as many people want 
to podcast about something they love but are intimidated by the amount of work 
that could go into a podcast. Another obstacle for passionate people who podcast is 
to compare themselves to more polished, professional podcasts that gather the 
best and the brightest guests in-studio. How do you compete with productions 
like that?

Well, Chuck and Tee have seen professional podcasts come and go, sometimes 
after eight episodes. Sometimes, after four. Why do productions like this podfade 
so quickly? In many instances, podcasts are regarded as revenue generators. 
In other words, these hosts are in it for the money. Podcasting can be a money-
making venture (as discussed in Chapter  15) but that “overnight success” 
rarely happens. Eventually, the studio lights are turned off and the equipment is 
packed away.
Sure, there are plenty of podcasts out there for Bungie’s video game, Destiny, but 
Tee, Nick, and Brandon love the game. They are not experts (although Brandon is 
ruthless in the Crucible), but it was their passion for Destiny that led to Happy Hour 
from the Tower. With so many podcasts out there about technology, why do Chuck 
and Kreg continue to podcast Technorama since 2005? Because after 500 episodes, 
Technorama continues to nurture that passion. No show ever sounds forced or 
trite. There’s a genuine joy within every podcast.
You can be an expert in your chosen field, or you can just be a huge fan. Passion 
should be at the core of every podcast. Without that, you can’t really find the drive 
to sit yourself behind the microphone and record, only then to edit and produce 
the final work for your audience. So if you feel the drive to podcast, do so. It will 
take you far.
You’ve Got a Creative Itch to Scratch
Maybe you never thought of yourself as a creative person, or maybe you were a 
creative person when you were younger. Maybe there’s been an inspiration work-
ing at the back of your mind, and you’ve been wanting to explore it. The weird 
thing about this idea, this unexpected muse that has grabbed hold, is that you may 
need to pick up some skills that you don’t know. Audio editing. Video production. 
Is this creative endeavor something that can really happen? And can you afford it?
Podcasting, as we have shown, is not only something you can pick up quickly, but 
it is an affordable venture.
Science Fiction-Fantasy author Aly Grauer and game connoisseur Drew Mierze-
jewski took a few brave steps into podcasting with Dreams to Become (http://
dreamstobecome.com). It began with The Disney Odyssey where Aly, Drew, and spe-
cial guests joined them in their personal journey through every animated feature 
film from Walt Disney. They were enjoying this adventure so much, they launched 
an additional podcast, The Night’s Rewatch, a step back to the beginning of HBO’s 

CHAPTER 19  Top Ten Reasons Why to Podcast      363
Game of Thrones. But still this wasn’t enough so DND20 Public Radio, a sketch com-
edy created at the intersection of NPR, Dungeons & Dragons, and Waiting for Guffman 
launched, all under the DTB feed.
Within their first year of podcasting, Aly and Drew shut down their DTB feed, and 
brought all their creative inspirations — writing, gaming, fantasy, and theater — 
together to launch, Welcome to Warda (https://welcometowarda.com), shown in 
Figure 19-2. This production could be best described as a transmedia FATE-core 
RPG experience, telling the story of the far-off fairy realm of Warda through 
gaming, podcasting, and live stream actual play on Twitch’s channel One Shot 
Podcast Network (http://oneshotpodcast.com/).
Once you have your studio, be it a simple audio setup or a complex video produc-
tion, a podcast serves as your blank canvas for whatever creative endeavor you’re 
about to embark on. This could be a throwback to the days of radio theater or this 
could be a personal journal for you accomplishing a life goal, be it physical fitness, 
a college degree, or a trip across the country. This podcast is where you share your 
creation with the world. Regardless of whether your feedback is positive or nega-
tive, this is your stage. Make the most of it. Assure your audience what they can 
expect from your feed, and then allow your creativity to run. This is your creative 
corner of the Internet. Make the most of it.

You Like Playing with Tech Toys
So let’s just be honest: The toys a podcaster gets to play with are just so cool.
Microphones. Mixer boards. Gadgets for going portable. Software. The tools of the 
trade, while sometimes coming with steep price tags, are absolutely tempting. Not 
only do some of these technical gadgets stimulate the creative juices within your 
brain, but they can also be quite the showstoppers with the company you keep.
Tee has a terrific story about when he sat down in 2007 to interview Peter Earnest, 
executive director of the International Spy Museum. At that time, Peter was the 
host of the aforementioned SpyCast. Tee was using a Zoom H4 for the interview, 
the predecessor to the H4n mentioned in Chapter 4. While both models differ in 
features, the H4 was of a similar design. In other words, it looked a bit like a taser. 
This fascinated Mr. Earnest, and before the H4 went hot, Peter asked Tee many 
questions about the device, its many features, and the quality of its recordings.
Think about that for just a moment: The curator of a museum that features a lip-
stick pistol, an Enigma machine, the Model F-21 buttonhole camera, a rectal tool-
kit (yes, you read that right), and the “Bulgarian Umbrella” used to fire a tiny 
pellet filled with poison, was completely captivated by this portable audio recorder 
of Tee’s. Considering Peter’s background, that is saying something about the 
allure of audio gear.
If there is something to the latest technology that makes you happy and gets your 
blood pumping, whether it is an all-in-one recording device like a Zoom H6 
Handy Recorder or an accessory like the MXL Mic Mate Pro (see Figure 19-3) that 
offers you recording options, consider all the wonderful toys you find in podcast-
ing. While this may sound like a frivolous reason to think about launching your 
own show, consider how your skill set also broadens. Working with gear like con-
denser and dynamic microphones, portable digital recorders, software packages 
from Adobe and Ambrosia Software, and producing audio or video presentations 
will only serve to your advantage when called on to create something special for 
an office demonstration or for a special event at home. It might surprise you, as 
well, what kind of skills you pick up in producing a podcast in the ways of plan-
ning, project management, presentation skills, resource budgeting, and time 
management.
And to think it all starts with the tech toys.

CHAPTER 19  Top Ten Reasons Why to Podcast      365
Bring Your Friends Together
You are putting together your notes for your podcast. It could be your first podcast. 
It could be a new podcast to add to your portfolio of podcasts. Whatever the case, 
you decide that instead of your voice being the only voice on the show, you reach 
out to a few friends in the area or online that you know are just as passionate 
about the subject you plan to podcast.
Maybe this podcast is a Dungeons & Dragons session, or perhaps you want some 
fellow Chicago Cubs fans or L.A. Kings fans to get around the mics and talk about 
the last game. Or you invite some friends who all share an interest — writing, 
period costume productions, movie soundtracks — to come on over and riff about 
it on pod. With schedules agreed upon and set, you settle in with your friends 
either in real time or over Skype, Google, or your favorite online conference net-
work of choice and record. Maybe you don’t realize it, but your recording sessions 
are more than just your chance to herd content and build up a buffer for your 
show. The podcast is your guaranteed connection with you and your friends. Tony 
Mast even mentions this in Chapter 17. His podcast Back Seat Producers is a “locked-
in” time when good friends know they are getting together to have a little fun and 
share some quality time around microphones.

Another great thing about podcasting with your friends is that the podcast 
becomes a journal — a testament — of your friendship. That’s worth the time, 
especially when you do retrospective episodes.
All the Cool Kids Are Doing It
Kevin Smith.
Katie Couric.
Neil deGrasse Tyson.
And you.
It’s a little humbling how many high-profile journalists, celebrities, and industry 
influencers are turning to what was once a platform for indie artists exclusively. 
What is most satisfying is, after a decade and some change, podcasting is still a 
fantastic platform for independent creatives. For the NPR, network television, AMC, 
and ESPN types, the podcast also serves as a fantastic opportunity to go beyond their 
time on stage, screen, or a sports event. Podcasting is something akin to a great 
equalizer as, regardless of the production values, we are all doing the same thing 
here: getting in front of the camera or on the mics and sharing what’s on our minds.
This is some great company to be in, so why don’t you go on and get your podcast 
up and running? It’s okay. There’s plenty of room in the podosphere for what 
you’ve got. Bring your best, put your heart into it, and get your pod on!
I Can Do More
In the 2009 edition of Star Trek, Captain Christopher Pike says to young upstart 
James T. Kirk:
“Your father was the captain of a starship for 12 minutes. He saved 800 lives, including 
your mother’s and yours. I dare you to do better.”
Now what exactly does the reboot of a popular science fiction series have to do 
with podcasting? Pike’s words serve as a great mantra for podcasters as with 
every show produced, podcasters look to do better. We look to improve. We look to 
grow. Some podcasters, after running a show for a time, love to look back on early 
shows and see the progress made from those first steps. It is said among some 

CHAPTER 19  Top Ten Reasons Why to Podcast      367
podcasters that the first five episodes of any podcast (even those done by experi-
enced hosts) will suck, but they are allowed to suck.
Chuck and Tee do not necessarily adhere to or believe in that rule as some pod-
casts find their voices straight away within two or three episodes. Others, we have 
found, record an “Episode 0” just to see if the idea looking awesome on paper 
translates as well to media. Then you have shows that find a groove once the mics 
are hot or the camera goes live. Whenever you find your voice, creating something 
that people react to is truly special and worth the time and effort. The slippery 
slope in podcasting, though, is that drive and desire to do more.
Take a look at Tee, for example. He’s the first author to podcast a novel from cover 
to cover. He took what started as a marketing strategy and turned it into a book. 
Then he goes on and creates a podcast about the business side of writing, launches 
companion podcasts for his books in social media, and helps establish a website 
where other podcasters can podcast their own novels and collections.
And yet, he wanted to do more.
Tales from the Archives is launched, opening up the steampunk universe he created 
with his wife to other authors and to wider audiences. The Shared Desk is soon 
launched after this, offering commentary on the latest news in the publishing indus-
try as well as a behind-the-scenes look at an author’s life. While delving into the 
current edition of this book, Tee follows an impulse and launches Happy Hour from the 
Tower, a loving nod to the Bungie game Destiny, alongside his friends Ron Dauphin 
and Nick & Brandon Kelly. All this, and he still hosts alongside Chuck Podcasting For 
Dummies: The Companion Podcast in order to keep this book fresh and up-to-date.
This may seem like a lot for Tee to take on, but for Tee this is a real love for the 
platform and the medium. He challenges himself to do better. He desires to do more.
This is the drive behind a podcaster.
Bring Out the Best in You
When you sit down to create a podcast, you want the production to rival that of 
professional broadcasting. No, you don’t have that budget but that doesn’t mean 
you don’t strive for that level of polish and professionalism. Even with a show like 
Technorama, which comes across as spontaneous and off-the-cuff (and for the 
most part, it is!), Chuck and Kreg work to make their show a production that pod-
casters and radio show hosts all strive to reach, if not surpass. There is a sense of 
accomplishment and achievement in producing a podcast that gets people to stop 
and ask “Wait, hold on—you do this in your home?”

368      PART 6  The Part of Tens
Sometimes, we do. Sometimes, we take our act on the road. It all depends on 
where we can kick up the most trouble!
Podcasting encourages by its artistic and technical nature to compel producers and 
show host to create the best podcast in whatever subject the producers and hosts 
pursue. Does that mean it will be regarded by audiences worldwide as the best? It 
depends on how you measure your success. Most podcasters measure the impact 
of a podcast on ratings and rankings. Others care more about feedback from their 
listeners. Some measure their podcast’s success by how long their show runs after 
the premiere episode drops. This also compels producers and hosts to insist on 
creating the best podcast they can. This is how podcasting engenders a real desire 
in those involved to offer a show that is as much fun for audiences to listen to as 
it is for the podcast’s crew to record, edit, and release.
Let podcasting bring out the best in you.
Talk to Interesting People
Bugs Bunny was right:
“My, I bet you monsters lead iiiinnnnnteresting lives. I said to my girlfriend 
just the other day ‘Gee, I bet monsters are iiiinnnnnteresting,’ I said. The places 
you must go and the things you must see — mmmyyyyy staaaaarrrs. And I bet 
you meet a lot of iiiinnnnnteresting people, too. I’m always interested in 
meeting iiiinnnnnteresting people.”
BUGS BUNNY, HARE RAISING HARE (1946)
Now while Bugs was referring to monsters, Chuck and Tee refer to really iiiinnnnn-
teresting people. Some of the people the authors of this book have met over the 
course of podcasting include authors who have made an impact in their genre 
(Robert J. Sawyer and Terry Brooks); actors who have plenty of stories from behind 
the scenes (Richard Hatch and Lani Tupu); other podcasters who have made last-
ing impressions in and beyond the podcasting community (Grant Baciocco and Dr. 
Pamela Gay); and even scientists who have changed the world in what we know 
about it (Dr. Robert Ballard, discovered the Titanic wreckage in 1985). Both Tee and 
Chuck consider themselves fortunate for meeting a wide range of guests in their 
years of podcasting.
Sometimes, though, you are lucky enough to talk to guests who wind up becoming 
far more familiar than just guests on your podcasts. A perfect example is Chuck 
and Tee. In the infancy of podcasting, Tee reached out to Chuck, asking to be on 
Technorama as a guest. Tee returned for other promotional opportunities, at first, 

CHAPTER 19  Top Ten Reasons Why to Podcast      369
but those return trips led to meetups at conventions which led to friendship, 
which eventually led to this book’s second edition as well as the edition you are 
reading now.
Not all the people you meet will lead to lifelong friendships, but through podcast-
ing you will meet a lot of iiiinnnnnteresting people who will in some way impact 
your life. Some of those impacts you will notice straightaway. There will be those 
discussions you have with people that become a more subtle touch on your life, 
and you might not notice it until years down the road. Each person you meet, 
though, is part of a network; and that network — personal or professional — will 
at the very least broaden your view of the world. As an example, the P. G. Holyfield 
Meat & Greet, shown in Figure 19-4, was a yearly meetup hosted at Balticon to 
remember this fallen podcaster and friend, and the lives he touched.
At the most, it will enrich your life for years to come.
The Ultimate Thrill Ride
There is something scary, humbling, and intimidating about taking something 
you have created and releasing it to the world. You think it’s good. Good enough 
to share, even. But once you release your podcast out into the world, it is out there. 
For everyone to consume. And for everyone to critique, criticize, and dissect. This 
is a whole new level of fear when your first show goes live.
It is, also, an amazing rush of adrenaline, euphoria, and accomplishment.
Tee has been podcasting for over a decade. This is nothing new to him, and yet he 
can attest on launching Happy Hour from the Tower while writing this edition that 
he was terrified beyond reason. Why? This was a whole new kind of podcast for 
Tee. He had never podcasted about video games before. This was his first regular 
show with co-hosts relatively new to podcasting. And when it came to a subject 
FIGURE 19-4:

matter — Bungie’s award-winning video game, Destiny — Tee was not the best of 
players, let alone “well known” in the community. Oh, and as the show’s launch 
date was less than a month out from Bungie revealing details of Destiny 2, it 
just seemed a bit late to launch a new podcast about a game that had been out 
since 2014.
Still, Tee launched the podcast, and he’s been enjoying the ride since that first 
show dropped.
Podcasting, whether on the grand scale or a small, personal stage, is an adventure. 
The longer you podcast, the bolder you become. The bolder you become, the more 
you want to test your limits. You find yourself reaching out to experts in the sub-
ject matter of your podcast, or maybe you reach out to podcasts similar to your 
own. You invite others to appear on your show. Or you find yourself carrying 
recording equipment everywhere, much like a photographer does with camera 
gear. You set up your portable studio, fire up the mic, and begin documenting. You 
talk. You meet new people. People with stories to tell. Suddenly, you find your own 
personal network growing. Your network grows closer, and those contacts become 
friends. Then, if you are lucky, those friends become family.
Podcasting is an incredible ride, and it can take you to unexpected places. It isn’t 
easy. Not by a longshot. It is rewarding, even the podcasts that never seem to take 
off. They are an education of what to do differently and how to improve. Possibili-
ties are endless, and the unexpected — regardless of how much you plan — will 
happen. This only adds to the fun ahead.
Now it’s your turn. You’ve got an idea. The microphones are waiting. Go on and 
hit Record.
And hold on. Your adventure is officially underway.

About the Authors
Tee Morris is social media professional based out of the Washington, D.C./Virginia/
Maryland metro area, and an award-winning author of science fiction and 
­fantasy. Tee’s writing career began with his 2002 historical epic fantasy, MOREVI: 
The Chronicles of Rafe & Askana, published by Dragon Moon Press and the first 
novel to be podcast from cover to cover. It was MOREVI’s podcast that led to this 
team-up with podcaster Evo Terra for the original Podcasting For Dummies in 2005. 
Since then, he has written four other titles for social media professionals, includ-
ing Social Media for Writers, penned with his wife, Philippa Ballantine. Both Tee 
and Pip continue to podcast together with their Parsec-nominated podcast The 
Shared Desk, and continue to write together in The Ministry of Peculiar Occurrences, a 
steampunk series that has won several Parsec awards as well as numerous ­literary 
awards, including RT Reviewer’s Choice for Best Steampunk of 2014.

In “real life,” Chuck Tomasi is an IT professional with over 35 years of experience. 
He is currently employed as a Pre-Sales Platform Architect for ServiceNow, a 
cloud enterprise software company. Currently residing in Phoenix, Arizona, he is 
a devoted husband and proud father of two beautiful girls. As for his alter 
ego . . . Chuck was bitten hard by the podcasting bug (there’s an understatement). 
He was so eager to get started in late 2004 that he made a few tweaks to his self-
written blog software and had the feed ready to go. Since then, he has migrated to 
WordPress and produced over 1,000 episodes across multiple shows. The longest 
running being Technorama, a light-hearted geek show that he co-hosts with Kreg 
Steppe. In 2011, Technorama took home a Parsec Award for best comedy/parody. 
Chuck has also been given license to employ his podcasting talents at work, 
­garnering notoriety with a series called TechNow. This show is targeted toward 
ServiceNow administrators and developers and is co-hosted with Kreg Steppe and 
Dave Slusher (also podcasters). When people talk about podcasting with passion, 
Chuck’s enthusiasm comes to mind.

Authors’ Acknowledgments
Due to the complexity of the issue and the incredible growth in the community, it 
would be impossible to properly express our thanks to all the parties who were of 
great help with this book. So with that . . .
To our wives, Donna and Pip: Thanks for not strangling us for our constant “Oh! 
We’ve got to add that to the book!” and “Come on, honey, we have to record this 
for the book!” moments. We deeply appreciate the averted gazes of death when we 
answered that no, unfortunately we would not be coming to bed, no, I forgot to 
scoop the litter boxes because we had one more chapter to write, and that yes, we 
did realize it was three o’clock in the morning.
To the podcasters that provided not only inspiration, but also camaraderie and 
friendship along the way. Through listening to you all and talking to many, you 
served as a constant reminder of why we were pouring our hearts and souls into 
this text. 
Finally, a special nod to Michael R. Mennenga for passing along that e-mail on 
October 12, 2004, that opened a door to a world of time-shifting, kick ass mystic 
ninjas, podiobooks, and science fiction and fantasy geeks around the world inter-
ested in what we have to offer.
