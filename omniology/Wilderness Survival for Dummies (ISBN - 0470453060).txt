About the Authors
John Haslett is a veteran expedition leader and adventure 
writer. He is the author of various adventure books, magazine 
articles, and academic papers, and his work has been featured 
in National Geographic Adventure, Archaeology, QST, and other 
magazines. He has spent decades catching unpleasant tropical 
diseases, explaining himself to local authorities, fleeing from 
various misguided animals, and putting into practice many of 
the tenets of this book.
In the 1990s, with the help of an isolated community of 
Ecuadorian mariners, John built four 30,000-pound wooden 
rafts and then voyaged on the Pacific Ocean aboard those 
primitive vessels for hundreds of days. He and Cameron are 
now preparing their most extensive expeditions to date.
John lives in Los Angeles with his wife, film director Annie Biggs.
Cameron M. Smith’s mountaineering, sailing, archaeological, 
and icecap expeditions have taken him to Africa, South 
America, arctic Alaska, Canada, and Iceland. In 2004, he made 
the first solo winter ski crossing of Iceland’s storm-lashed 
Vatnajökull icecap, an expedition televised on the National 
Geographic Channel. He is currently documenting arctic Alaska 
in winter by trekking on, piloting a paraglider over, and scuba 
diving beneath the sea ice.
Cameron has written for Scientific American Mind, Hang Gliding 
& Paragliding, Archaeology, and Spaceflight magazines and in 
the books The Best Travel Writing (2008, 2009), Science under 
Siege, They Lived to Tell the Tale, The Top 10 Myths about 
Evolution, and Anthropology For Dummies.
A Life Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, a Fellow of the 
Explorers Club, and a member of the Society for Human 
Performance in Extreme Environments, Cameron is currently 
writing a narrative of his Iceland expeditions and preparing for 
balloon exploration of the stratosphere as well as another 
Pacific expedition with John Haslett. You can track his expedi-
tion at www.cameronmsmith.com.

Dedication
John Haslett: This book is dedicated to Annie Biggs, 
Cameron Smith, Alejandro Martinez, Cesar Alarcon, and 
Dower Medina — five extraordinary people who know a thing 
or two about surviving in bad conditions. 
And to the boys and men of Troop 100, BSA, wherever 
you are . . .
Cameron M. Smith: Like John, I dedicate this book to my 
companions in adventure: namely, John himself; my moun-
taineering partners, Dr. Chiu Liang Kuo, W. McRee Anderson 
III, and Jamie Anderson; my flight instructors, Larry Pindar 
and George McPherson; my diving partner, Todd Olson; 
Arctic Expedition Coordinator Chuck Sullivan; and Dr. Evan 
T. Davies. Thank you all for throwing your dice with me. I 
also dedicate this book to the indigenous people across the 
globe — the Samburu of East Africa, the fisher-folk of West 
Ecuador, and the Inupiat of Alaska — who taught me how to 
survive in places where suburbanites like me would other-
wise just vanish.

Authors’ Acknowledgments
John Haslett: I would like to send my thanks to my wife, Annie 
Biggs, for her editing, proofing, scheduling, strategizing, and 
solid backboned, fighting spirit. I am lucky. I would also like to 
acknowledge Cameron McPherson Smith, PhD, my coauthor. 
Not only did he write roughly half of this book, but he also 
hand-drew some 120 technical illustrations at the same time. 
Thanks to Literary Agent Matt Wagner at Fresh Books, Inc., 
who represented this book and who has been exceedingly sup-
portive. I’d like to thank the editor of this book, Chad Sievers, 
who has been excellent to work with and someone I would 
work with again, as well as copy editor Danielle Voirol, who 
made important contributions to this manuscript. Lindsay 
Lefevere, Acquisitions Editor, deserves credit for believing this 
would be a worthwhile book. Search and Rescue veterans Gary 
Cascio and Rick Goodman, both of New Mexico, were generous 
with their time, advice, and facts. Finally, I’d like to send out 
my deepest thanks to all the readers and supporters of my pre-
vious work — all the letter writers and e-mailers and lecture 
attendees.
Cameron M. Smith: I thank John Haslett for inviting me aboard 
one of his extraordinary raft expeditions and for his rock-solid 
friendship over more than a decade. I am particularly pleased 
to have the opportunity to thank John’s wife, Annie Biggs, for 
supporting John’s expeditions. I thank Literary Agent Matt 
Wagner for suggesting this project, Acquisitions Editor Lindsay 
Lefevere for managing it, and our primary editors, Chad 
Sievers and Danielle Voirol, for deftly improving the text. I 
thank our technical reviewers for their helpful comments, and 
like John, I thank my friends and mentors from Boy Scout 
Troop 616, among whose company I first learned the rewards 
of an outdoor life. I thank Angela Perri for her limitless 
patience during this time-devouring project and Search and 
Rescue Technician Jeff Parsons of the Idaho Falls Fire 
Department for his technical comments. Finally, I thank my 
parents, professors Donald E. and Margit J. Posluschny Smith, 
for granting me the freedom to weave reality from my dreams. 
There is no greater gift, and I know that the price — their 
worry while I’m on expedition — is real.

Introduction
W
elcome to the realm of the extraordinary. Survival 
situations can bring out greatness in some people, 
and they can also bring out foolishness or terror or spiritual 
renewal or changes in perspective or sometimes, just 
enormous gratitude for being alive. We, your friendly authors, 
have crawled like fleas in the face of enormous winds and 
waves, and we, too, have experienced these extraordinary 
states of mind — and many more.
But more often than not, survival situations aren’t so romantic: 
You’re on a day hike, 5 miles from a major city — hopelessly 
lost — and even though you can hear and see signs of 
civilization, you’re still in danger of dying from hypothermia 
in the next hour. Unfortunately, this situation can kill you 
just as fast as being lost on an expedition to the North Pole. 
Perhaps even worse, when you do finally make it out, you 
don’t get an ounce of respect for it from the folks back home! 
Well, we wrote this book with sympathy for both — those 
involved in exotic adventures and those who just got a little 
turned-around while taking pictures.
You may worry, understandably, that wilderness survival 
requires you to bite off the heads of snakes and eat them raw 
or perhaps leap from a cliff into a raging river. Nothing could 
be further from the truth. Many survival skills are much more 
mundane. For example, you can extend the life of your batteries 
by taking them out of your flashlight and putting them inside 
your shirt (or better yet, in a plastic bag taped to your 
armpit) — against your skin. Keeping batteries warm makes 
your flashlight run much, much longer during the cold and 
dark night. There. That wasn’t so bad, was it? You picked up a 
basic survival skill and you didn’t have to shiver or go hungry. 
You’re already rolling.

About This Book
This book is designed to thoroughly cover the basics of 
wilderness survival. To compile the information, we’ve 
used the most tried-and-true sources, such as The U.S. Army 
Survival Manual and Essentials of Sea Survival, by Frank 
Golden and Michael Tipton (Human Kinetics), but we’ve 
called upon our own practical experiences as well. We give 
you much of this information in a cheerful voice, but we also 
interject a more serious tone when we have to give you grim 
news. You can find both voices in these pages.
Conventions Used in This Book
Throughout this book, we use the word we when we, Cameron 
and John, both want to say something personal to you, our 
reader. This book comes from the combined experiences of 
two people who’ve been through a lot of misadventures and 
who are very close friends. We’ve been in enough trouble — 
and scared enough — that we think alike, basically, and 
therefore we speak with the same voice.
We define the wilderness as just about any place out-of-doors. 
We know from bitter experience that it’s easy to freeze to 
death in places that a geographer wouldn’t necessarily think 
of as “wilderness areas.” With that in mind, you should know 
that this isn’t a camping book; it’s a book for anyone at risk of 
perishing from exposure to the elements, whether camping or 
off on a harmless stroll.
We try not to use too much technical terminology in this 
book, but when we do offer new vocab, we italicize the term 
the first time we use it. Shortly after giving you the new term, 
we always define it.
Foolish Assumptions
Although we know that you don’t fit every description in 
this list of assumptions we make about you, our reader, we 
do assume that you have a least a few of the following 
characteristics:

 Introduction
3
 
✓ You want a basic survival book that gives practical, 
tried-and-tested advice, whether you’re solo or with a 
group.
 
✓ You’ve tried other manuals, but they seem just a little 
too, well, dry.
 
✓ You want a comprehensive survival manual that you can 
throw in your car or backpack (or carry-on luggage), just 
in case.
 
✓ You’re already in a wilderness survival situation and you 
have this handbook nearby.
 
✓ You’ve seen a survival show on television and it has 
intrigued you.
 
✓ You’re not someone who is into bushcraft (at least not 
yet), which is the art of being completely self-sufficient in 
the wilderness. You can find numerous, excellent books 
if you want to live off the land, long term. We simply want 
to help you survive so you can find your way back to 
civilization or signal a search and rescue team.
What You’re Not to Read
Although we hope you enjoy reading every word that 
we’ve written, we also realize that you’re a busy person, 
juggling a career, family, and friends and handling ten other 
responsibilities. If you just want the bare essentials of 
surviving in the wild, feel free to skip the sidebars that appear 
in the gray shaded boxes. The information in the sidebars is 
additional information, purely for the curious. You can also 
skip over any paragraphs marked with the Technical Stuff 
icon, which marks info that’s fun or useful but not essential. 
We hope you read them, but if you don’t, you won’t miss any 
vital information.
How This Book Is Organized
Though you can turn to any section in this book and start 
reading, we’ve organized the information so that we start 
with the most basic needs and then work up to the extremes. 
Whenever we talk about a basic idea that we think has an 

Wilderness Survival For Dummies 
4
exception in an extreme situation, we tell you where to look 
for that exception. We also try to do the reverse: In extreme 
environments, we frequently send you back to the basics to 
help you review the foundations of survival. Here’s what you 
can find in the various parts of this book.
Part I: Stayin’ Alive: Basic 
Wilderness Survival Principles
In this part, we start with basic survival protocol — what you 
should do and in what order you should do it. We show you 
how to make improvised clothing, how to make fire, how to 
make shelters, and how to find water and food. We also spend 
some time showing you how to prepare for the wilderness — 
what to carry and what to keep an eye out for.
Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival 
Techniques
This is the part that we hope gives you the upper hand over 
your surroundings. In this part, you discover how to navigate, 
trek through trails and the bush, make sure someone sees 
you so you can be rescued, handle a bleeding wound, and tie 
knots and make tools from wood and stone.
Part III: Surviving in Extreme 
Land Environments
In this part, we address all the special problems (and miseries, 
frankly) that jungle, desert, and polar environments can 
present to you, the survivor. We delve into topics such as 
tropical disease prevention, snake avoidance, cactus eating, 
and avalanche safety.

 Introduction

Part IV: Surviving on the Seas, 
Oceans, and Great Lakes
This part takes you from the moment your vessel begins to 
sink to the moment you make it back to shore and every place 
in between. It shows you how to abandon a ship safely, how 
to float for extended periods of time, how to inflate a life raft, 
and hopefully, how to catch a fish — without accidentally 
deflating the raft!
Part V: The Part of Tens
In this part, we give you ten fun exercises that you can do to 
improve your survival skills in the field. We also show you ten 
scenarios that aren’t so much about survival as escape.
Icons Used in This Book
In this book, we place icons, little pictures in the margins, 
next to some of the paragraphs that we feel need a little extra 
emphasis.
 
This symbol gives you a little added info that (hopefully) makes 
the survival skill we’ve just explained a little easier. Sometimes, 
a tip is also a small qualification — a little explanation that tells 
you when you should use another method.
 
This symbol is a reminder to do a particular action that 
makes a survival skill successful, or it makes you think about 
common sense before you rush out and try something!
 
This symbol means danger. When we use this symbol, we’re 
trying to emphasize some aspect of a survival situation that 
can really get you into trouble.

This symbol tells you that we’re giving you some background 
info on the topic, but you don’t necessarily need to know the 
info to be able to execute the actions outlined in the text.
 
This symbol marks true stories of survival and some of our 
own accounts of close calls, foolish mistakes, and improvised 
solutions.
Where to Go From Here
Feel free to start reading this book anywhere you like. The five 
parts are completely modular, so you don’t have to read them 
in order. However, Chapter 1 is certainly a good place to start 
because it tells you exactly what to do first if you find yourself 
lost in the woods.
Part I is a great place to start to get a good foundation for all 
things wilderness survival. If you’re planning on a trip to an 
extreme environment, you may want to start with Part III. On 
the other hand, if you’re looking for adventures on the sea, 
you can go straight to Part IV.
Of course, when you’re in a survival situation, you can check 
out the index or table of contents and simply flip to the 
information you need. If you’re bleeding, or if you’ve twisted 
your ankle, or if you’ve been bitten by a snake, check out 
Chapter 13. Or if your ship has gone under and you find 
yourself in a life raft, go to Chapter 19.

Part I
Stayin’ Alive: Basic 
Wilderness Survival 
Principles

In this part . . .
W
hether you’re adrift at sea or lost on a day hike, 
survival situations throw the same basic questions 
at you: How can you stay warm overnight? How are you 
going to prevent dehydration or get something to eat?
In this part, we show you how to prioritize your actions. 
For instance, we let you know that while you’re waiting for 
rescue or planning your escape, your fi rst priorities are to 
keep warm (or cool), fi nd water, and take shelter — only 
then do you start looking for food. We also give advice on 
psychological preparedness, talk about improvising clothing, 
and name some practical methods for making fi re, building 
shelter, fi nding water, and harvesting food from the 
wilderness.

Chapter 1
Surviving the Wilderness
In This Chapter
▶ Being prepared for common wilderness survival situations
▶ Having the right attitude and being proactive
▶ Taking care of basic needs and signaling for rescue
▶ Navigating and avoiding mistakes
K
nowing the threats you face in the wilderness and the 
wisest courses of action to take to counter those threats 
can go a long way toward keeping you alive in a bad situation. 
If you know in advance what the real problems are, then as 
soon as you find yourself lost or adrift, you can go to work 
immediately — and that changes you from victim to survivor.
This chapter serves as a jumping-off point to wilderness 
survival. Here, we give you an overview of the basics you need 
to know in practically any wilderness survival situation. We 
show what the threats are and how to take care of them in the 
right order. Finally, we take a minute to show you how 
so many people go wrong and how you can prevent your 
situation from getting worse — or perhaps how to stay out of 
trouble altogether!
Being Prepared and Proactive
Every piece of knowledge or equipment you carry with you 
makes you stronger in the wild. Preparation gives you staying 
power, and it frequently gives you that little extra advantage 
you need to stay out of a crisis. Chapter 2 discusses what you 
can do to be prepared.

Part I: Stayin’ Alive: Basic Wilderness Survival Principles 
10
Being proactive usually means stopping and getting control — 
such as slowing your swimming stroke or even floating to 
conserve your energy. If you’re lost, don’t react and don’t 
speed up. Stop, sit, and think carefully about your situation 
for a long time. Take control of the situation instead of letting 
it take control of you.
Keeping the Right Attitude
Real survival situations feel enormously unfair. Almost all 
survivors face the feeling of injustice — it’s as though the 
world is conspiring against you or the odds are simply 
beyond your abilities. To survive this situation, you can’t 
let these feelings take over. You need to have your head on 
straight and keep a positive outlook. Chapter 3 gives more 
info on survival psychology.
To keep a positive attitude, the first thing you have to do is 
size up your situation. Take it all in. This can be very difficult 
for some people, and it can stand in the way of clear thinking. 
The truth is that most survival situations are so unexpected 
that they leave you a little stunned. You have to master 
disbelief. Many people perish simply because they can’t go 
beyond denial.
The following suggestions can help you keep your spirits up:
 
✓ Be resourceful. Resources and options that you’ve never 
considered are available to you. Use rocks as hammers, 
nails as fishhooks, and belt buckles as reflectors for 
signaling. Then think of new options and work out more 
plans. Think of a way.
 
✓ Be patient. Consider that being rescued or working your 
way out of the problem may take time, but never assume 
that no one will come looking for you.
 
✓ Never say die. Misery and fear can fool you into thinking 
you’re finished. Don’t let your mind play tricks on you. 
You can keep going long after you feel like you can’t. A 
lot longer. Don’t give up. Keep a positive attitude, or 
grit your teeth in grim determination. If you slip into a 
negative attitude, you’ll melt like a candle.

 Chapter 1: Surviving the Wilderness 11
Identifying Survival Basics
When you find yourself in a survival situation, the immediate 
decisions you make can significantly impact what happens 
to you. Make sure you address your basic needs in the order 
they appear in this section.
You may also face a medical situation, which may take 
precedence over the ones we mention here, depending on 
its severity. For first aid procedures, see Chapter 13.
Regulating your body temperature
Thermoregulation is the management of your body temperature. 
It’s the highest priority because being too cold (hypothermia) 
or being too hot (hyperthermia) are the fastest killers in the 
wilderness. You have to stay warm in cold environments and 
cool in hot environments. Here’s how:
 
✓ Cool or cold environments: Don’t allow yourself to get 
wet. Be careful near streams and rivers, shelter yourself 
from rain, and keep sweating to a minimum. If night is 
coming, realize that hypothermia is a threat and construct 
an insulating shelter.
 
✓ Hot environments: You need liquid and shade to cool 
the body. If your temperature is rising, recognize this 
and rest or find shade. Waiting too long is the biggest 
contributor to heat exhaustion. Always stay well hydrated 
in all situations but especially in hot environments.
The four components that govern thermoregulation are 
clothing, fire, shelter, and your own actions. The following 
sections give an overview of them.
Your first line of defense: Clothing
In a survival situation, you have to cope with the entire 
temperature range of a particular environment, as well as the 
changes in your own body’s temperature. The best way to do 
this is to dress in layers or to improvise layers. You want to 
be able to add or subtract clothing. For more on clothing, see 
Chapter 4.

Part I: Stayin’ Alive: Basic Wilderness Survival Principles 
12
 
In many survival situations, people discard clothing that they 
don’t think they need (it’s true, honest). Never discard any 
clothing, under any circumstances. If you take off a shirt or 
jacket, tie it around your waist or jam it in your belt. Be 
prepared to carry the layers that aren’t currently in use.
If you’re in a cold environment, strip off layers of clothing if 
you start to sweat. You must stay dry. If you’re facing a cold 
night, add insulating layers by stuffing grass, leaves, or moss 
inside your clothing. You can use other materials, including 
debris, trash bags, cardboard, or anything that you can attach 
to or wrap around your body, to make layers and insulation. 
Remember, trapped air is an excellent insulator, so you can 
use anything that traps a layer of air next to your body.
 
In all environments, cover your head. If you don’t have a hat, 
improvise one that covers your head and neck thoroughly. 
In the cold, a head and neck covering deters hypothermia, 
especially if you’ve fallen into cold water, and in the sun, it 
deters heat stroke.
Warming up to the fire
Starting a fire is crucial because it prevents hypothermia, it 
boosts morale, and it can be used to send a distress signal. 
Think overkill when preparing your first fire in a survival 
situation. Don’t rush things. Plan it out and have lots of 
backups to keep the flame going after it ignites. For info on 
how to make fire, see Chapter 5.
Gimme shelter
Like a fire, a shelter can help you maintain a sufficient body 
temperature, which is your first priority. And just like fire, 
shelter can really boost your morale. Even if you’re not a 
do-it-yourselfer around your home, you should know that 
anybody can make an insulating shelter, regardless of how 
much experience he or she has had in the woods.
Chapter 6 discusses how to build general shelters. But if you 
find yourself in a specific wilderness setting, such as a wintry 
tundra or a hot desert, check out the specialized shelters in 
the chapters in Part III.
Regulating temperature in oceans, seas, and lakes
If you’re in a water environment, thermoregulation is especially 
important. Take the following measures to say warm:

 Chapter 1: Surviving the Wilderness 13
 
✓ Stay as still as you possibly can. Don’t tread water if you 
can help it. That just makes you colder.
 
✓ Cover your head. If you have access to anything that can 
act as a hat, use it.
 
✓ Try to keep your armpits closed by holding your 
elbows at your side, and keep your crotch closed by 
crossing your legs. These areas leak a lot of body heat.
 
✓ Don’t take any heat-saving measure that causes your 
head to go under the water. You lose more heat from 
your head than from any other body part.
Check out Chapter 18 for a discussion of staying warm at sea.
Signaling for rescue
The sooner you help others figure out where you are, the 
better. You need to be ready to signal for rescue at all times. 
Begin thinking about signaling for help the moment trouble 
starts. Don’t ever believe that no one will come looking for 
you — someone usually does.
 
To get potential rescuers’ attention, your distress signals 
need to be huge. Shouting is fine if that’s all you can do, but 
just know that shouting is a very poor signal because the 
human voice doesn’t travel very far. To be seen or heard, 
signals have to be big — choose large symbols, loud noises, 
bright colors, or large clusters of objects, such as debris fields 
or people in groups. Even if you believe rescuers are nearby, 
make sure your signals are big. Chapter 12 provides info on 
signaling for help.
Avoiding dehydration
In a hot environment, water can become a life-threatening 
problem within hours, but in most temperate environments, 
you usually have roughly three days before the lack of water 
completely incapacitates you. The minute you think you’re in 
trouble, start practicing water discipline, which means you’re 
minimizing your usage in everything you do.
To practice water discipline, no matter where you are, take 
immediate action in these ways:

Part I: Stayin’ Alive: Basic Wilderness Survival Principles 
14
 
✓ Stop consuming diuretics immediately. These are 
liquids that make you urinate a lot, like coffee, tea, soda, 
and alcohol.
 
✓ Minimize your physical exertion if you can. Even if you 
can’t feel it, you’re losing water through perspiration and 
heavy breathing.
 
✓ Don’t eat or smoke. These activities use up your body’s 
water reserves. Try to enforce this measure as long as 
possible.
 
✓ Limit your water intake as much as you can. If you’re in 
temperate conditions or at sea, don’t drink anything for 
the first 24 hours — you’ll just lose it through urination. 
The only exception to this rule is if you’re in very hot 
conditions on land. In these conditions, you have to drink 
as soon as you feel yourself becoming incapacitated.
Check out Chapter 7 for a discussion of catching water, finding 
water, treating water, and drinking water in the wilderness.
Staying nourished
Food is the last on the list, by far, because in most cases, 
you’re rescued before it becomes a real factor. You can go a 
week or more before a lack of food begins to incapacitate you. 
Nevertheless, finding and eating something can really boost 
your energy and morale.
 
Many plants and animals are poisonous. If you’re in any 
way uncertain about a food source, don’t eat it — becoming 
incapacitated is the worst thing that can happen to you in the 
wild. For more on finding food in the wilderness, see Chapter 8.
Navigating in the Wild
The first and most basic rule of navigation is to know exactly 
where you are as often as you can. Now, you can’t stop every 
two minutes to look at the map — certainly not all day — but 
that’s not necessary to maintain good navigational awareness.
Make sure you don’t allow yourself to get more lost. If you’re 
disoriented, stop and take a moment to remember where 

 Chapter 1: Surviving the Wilderness 15
you were when you last knew your location. If you’re lost, 
consider staying put — especially if you know someone is 
looking for you or may look for you in the future. (See 
Chapter 11 for more on traveling with trails and on what to 
do when you’re disoriented or lost.) This section provides an 
overview of navigating in the wild with the help of tools and 
with the sun and stars.
Relying on tools to navigate
You may find this astounding, but many people are rescued 
every year even though they have a map and GPS in their 
hands. Satellite navigation and modern map making haven’t 
taken all the challenge out of the wilderness — if anything, 
they’ve given people a false sense of confidence. Whenever 
navigating with instruments, make sure they’re calibrated and 
that you’re looking at the correct map. Chapter 9 provides 
in-depth coverage on using these tools to help you navigate in 
the wilderness.
Looking to the heavens
Finding direction with the use of the sun and stars is really 
quite easy. You can start with the sun — it rises in the east 
and sets in the west, and if you’re anywhere in North America, 
Europe, or Northern Asia, it’s due south of you at midday. 
Check out Chapter 10 for specific ways you can use the sun 
and stars to find your way.
Surviving Injury
When you’re in the wild, staying healthy and injury-free can 
go a long way toward surviving your experience. To do so, 
keep the following tips in mind, and for more on first aid, 
check out Chapter 13.
 
✓ Always be on guard for hypothermia and hyperthermia. 
Even if you don’t feel the symptoms, someone in your 
party may be becoming incapacitated, and unfortunately, 
people don’t necessarily cry out when they’re afflicted by 
hypothermia — they just lie down.

Part I: Stayin’ Alive: Basic Wilderness Survival Principles 
16
 
✓ Treat trauma immediately. If a member of your party 
has suffered a trauma, you must make sure his or her 
ABCs are working:
 
• Airway: Check to make sure nothing is interfering 
with that person’s airway.
 
• Breathing: Make sure the subject is breathing.
 
• Circulation: Make sure he or she has a pulse.
 
 Be prepared to administer cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
(CPR). If you’ve checked the ABCs and they’re fine, put 
the subject in the recovery position, which means lying on 
his or her side with the head on an arm.
 
✓ Stop bleeding. If you have a bleeding wound on your 
hands (or anywhere else!), keep in mind that nothing’s 
changed since you were in Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts: 
Direct pressure for about 10 to 15 minutes does more to 
stop bleeding than just about anything else.
Avoiding Some of the Causes 
of Survival Situations
Most survival stories never make the news. This section looks 
at some of the most common reasons people end up lost in 
the wild. Use this info to ensure you don’t end up in the same 
situation.
Making errors in judgment
The leading cause of crises in the wilderness, according to 
various authorities, is errors in judgment. This is an exceedingly 
broad term, but a few examples can do a lot to show you how 
people commit errors in judgment in the wilderness:
 
✓ Not watching out for potential falls: Be especially careful 
whenever you’re near cliffs or when traveling at night or 
in low visibility conditions. Watch for ledges and earthen 
trails that can give way.

 Chapter 1: Surviving the Wilderness 17
 
✓ Letting yourself become dehydrated: You only have to 
dehydrate by about 5 percent to become physically and 
mentally impaired by 20 percent. When you add this on 
top of fatigue and hypothermia, you end up incapacitated.
 
✓ Trying to walk too far: Anytime you or one of your party 
isn’t physically fit, you need to be prudent in estimating 
how far you can go. If you’ve missed a meal or have been 
through an excessively exhausting event within the 
previous 24 hours, don’t push it.
 
✓ Continuing to walk long after you’re lost: Doing so just 
gets you more lost.
 
✓ Wearing inadequate clothing: You should know that wet 
cold is vastly more dangerous than dry cold. Anytime 
you face wet cold, take extra precautions. This type 
of environment causes fatalities. Chapter 4 discusses 
important clothing information.
 
✓ Carrying inadequate gear: Not having durable or warm 
clothing and footgear or the tools to start a fire are 
the prerequisites for a deadly hypothermia scenario. 
Chapter 2 identifies the equipment to take.
 
✓ Relying too much on GPS or cellphones to carry you 
through rough conditions: Not watching your maps 
because you have GPS or ignoring a deteriorating situa-
tion because you think can always call for help is a recipe 
for disaster. Take a look at Chapter 11 for more on this.
Losing it: Behaviors that 
help you get lost
You can get lost in the wild for an infinite number of reasons, 
but certain common denominators frequently crop up in 
statistical surveys of lost persons. Chapter 11 has more info 
about avoiding getting lost and what to do if you’re lost.
 
✓ Leaving the trail to take a shortcut: An inordinate 
number of people get lost every year because they leave 
the trail to try a shortcut. Stick to the trail, especially if 
you’re in unknown territory.

Part I: Stayin’ Alive: Basic Wilderness Survival Principles 
18
 
✓ Letting your awareness lapse: You pass through a tunnel 
in the foliage, or you’re concentrating on your photography 
or on seeing a particular species of bird, and suddenly 
you’re not exactly sure where you are.
 
✓ Walking downslope from a trail: Whenever you walk 
down from a trail (descend), you break your line of sight 
with the trail.
 
✓ Being overconfident in wilderness areas where you 
haven’t been in for a while: You can easily get lost when 
going back to your old stomping grounds.
 
✓ Turning onto false trails: Keep in mind that the world’s 
wilderness areas are constantly in flux. One good rain 
can wash away enough earth to make it appear as though 
there’s a new trail.
 
✓ Forging ahead: Many people get lost because they reach 
a point where the trail fades or is poorly marked and 
they continue on but can’t pick up the trail again. Be on 
guard for this, and make sure you leave behind your own 
markers in these areas.
 
✓ Going farther than you normally go when hunting, hiking, 
bird-watching, shooting outdoor photography, or berry- 
or mushroom-picking: You leave your normal stomping 
grounds — you push a little farther, and then when you 
turn around to come back, you get turned around.
 
✓ Falling behind the group: Parties of friends or social 
groups get spread out, or one particular person becomes 
begins to straggle.
 
✓ Getting separated from the group: This can happen when-
ever you’re transported to a remote area, such as when 
you’re taken to a dive site or a location in the desert.

Chapter 2
Preparing Yourself for a
Survival Situation
In This Chapter
▶ Developing basic weather awareness
▶ Knowing what to take along every time you go outdoors
▶ Assembling survival kits
Y
ou can take a quantum leap in self-sufficiency and 
survivability by making a few preparations before going 
into the wilderness. In particular, you need to consider the 
weather and how it can affect your situation. Furthermore, a 
discussion of being prepared isn’t complete without mentioning 
the importance of having a stocked survival kit in case 
something happens to you or your group.
In this chapter, we give you some practical suggestions for 
predicting bad weather and knowing how to handle it, and we 
show you a practical survival kit and how to carry it.
Being Ready for Mother Nature
Various authorities and surveys can tell you that errors in 
judgment cause more emergencies in the wild than just 
about anything else. High on that list of mistakes is being 
ill-equipped for the environment. Properly judging what 
you’re getting into — and carrying the right gear for the 
environment — can go a very long way toward staying out 
of survival situations.

Part I: Stayin’ Alive: Basic Wilderness Survival Principles 
20
By knowing what weather to expect, you can take precautions 
in deciding what clothing to wear (see Chapter 4) and when 
and where to venture. This section helps you get a firm grasp 
on weather-related issues. Later in this chapter, we discuss 
some of the equipment you need to take with you to be 
prepared.
Relying on weather forecasts
Before you head out into the field — and until you build up 
enough expertise to read clouds and wind — your best bet for 
knowing what kind of weather to expect is to use the forecasts 
available to you. Try the following resources:
 
✓ The local news: It can give you very detailed, specific 
info that nationwide forecasts can’t.
 
✓ The Internet: What doesn’t the Web have these days? 
Check out the following sites:
 
• The National Weather Service: This is a part of the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 
or NOAA, and it’s a great place to start if you’re in 
the U.S. The Web page (www.nws.noaa.gov) is 
excellent.
 
• Commercial sources: Other good sources are 
AccuWeather (www.accuweather.com), Intellicast 
(www.intellicast.com), and The Weather 
Channel (www.weather.com). All these sites have 
an advisories section that lists watches and warnings 
of bad weather throughout the world.
 
✓ Weather radios: To receive National Weather Service 
reports in the wilderness, bring along an NOAA radio 
receiver. These units are very inexpensive.
When checking any weather source, know at least four basic 
pieces of info:
 
✓ The 24-hour temperature range: This one piece of info 
prepares you more than just about anything else because 
it tells you how to dress and what gear you need to 
have. If you get lost, delayed, or injured, you may end up 
having to endure the entire temperature range — from 
the lowest to the highest.

 Chapter 2: Preparing Yourself for a Survival Situation 21
 
 If you’re planning on leaving your base, such as a road 
or a campsite, for any length of time, take the estimated 
temperature range, add 10 degrees to the high and 
subtract 10 degrees from the low, and then consider the 
wind in your preparations. The wind can make cold 
temperatures even more formidable.
 
✓ The short-term forecast: The three-day forecast is 
usually the most reliable.
 
✓ Watches and warnings: Keep in mind the difference 
between the two types of advisories:
 
• Watch: A watch is simply the weather service’s 
way of telling you that ideal conditions exist for 
a certain type of weather — tornadoes, floods, 
storms, and so on.
 
• Warning: A warning means that the weather 
phenomenon is known to be occurring at this 
moment. For example, a tornado warning means 
that someone actually saw a tornado nearby.
 
 If you’re going into the mountains or near a coastline, 
you need to locate the authority who issues the 
avalanche warnings or rip current and surge 
warnings.
 
✓ Barometric pressure: Barometric pressure is simply a 
measurement of how much air is sitting on top of the 
area you’re in. The pressure tells you one of two things:
 
• If the pressure is dropping, the atmosphere around 
you is becoming unstable. This means that the 
weather is probably going to deteriorate.
 
• If the pressure is rising, the atmosphere around 
you is stabilizing. Rising or steady pressure usu-
ally means good weather or a continuation of the 
weather you already have.
Watching for weather signs
When you’re in the field, you usually don’t have a chance 
to check the Web. However, you can watch out for signs of 
approaching weather — especially changes that weren’t 
predicted or that had a low chance of occurring. Pay attention 
to the winds and clouds to help you make weather predictions.

Part I: Stayin’ Alive: Basic Wilderness Survival Principles 
22
Considering the winds
Keep an eye on the wind you feel now as well as the wind 
you don’t feel yet. If the wind increases or changes direction, 
conditions around you are changing. If the wind changes 
radically, that usually means a substantial change in the 
weather.
 
To gauge the wind you don’t feel, try to size up the terrain 
around you and then estimate what a big wind would do if it 
were to come upon you suddenly. Here’s what wind can do in 
various terrains:
 
✓ If you’re on an exposed mountainside, a hard wind can 
cause a drastic drop in temperature.
 
✓ If you have open plains around you, remember that wide 
open spaces are nature’s speedway for high winds.
 
✓ If you’re near an exposed cliff, the wind may come in, 
explode against that cliff, and cause havoc.
Watching the clouds
Two types of clouds signify the coming of rain within a few 
hours or minutes. Here are the nimbus (rain) clouds:
 
✓ Any dark, low, heavily laden clouds: Rain’s obviously 
coming, right? These gray, blanket-like clouds are 
nimbostratus clouds.
 
✓ Tall, dense, fluffy clouds: Though less obvious, this 
second type of rain cloud indicates heavy rain and 
thunderstorms. An anvil head (a cumulonimbus cloud) 
is usually tall, dense (like a large island in the sky), and 
as puffy as cotton. If, during the day, you see this type of 
cloud grow very tall in the sky, or worse, start to become 
lopsided at the top — blown sideways by high-altitude 
winds — you’re seeing an anvil head (see Figure 2-1). 
These storm clouds usually bring rain, lightning, high 
winds, and sometimes hail.
 
If you’ve received a forecast of 20 percent chance of rain 
and an anvil head or low, gray clouds are nearby, feel free 
to increase the chance of rain to 50 percent (or more), all by 
yourself.

 Chapter 2: Preparing Yourself for a Survival Situation 23
Figure 2-1: An anvil head cloud.
Carrying Survival Equipment
Always carry a survival kit with you in the wilderness. If you 
spend enough time in the dark and in trouble, as we’ve done, 
you find that one little item is almost always what saves you. 
Being prepared and carrying a survival kit can often turn a 
bad situation into at least a tolerable one. In this section, 
we discuss different types of kits. Each list of equipment is 
slightly more elaborate than the previous one. Sometimes we 
list a piece of equipment twice because to be fully prepared, 
having two types of a particular item is ideal.
Five items you need
You need to have five basic items with you at all times, even 
if others in your party have them, too. Without these items, 
you’re utterly defenseless — naked, in fact. You can put three 
of these items on a keychain, and four out of the five can fit in 
one pocket.
Flashlight
You need a flashlight so you can perform complicated tasks 
in the dark and also so you can signal for help at night. Many 
times, especially when you have plenty of moonlight, you 
should try to do everything with your natural night vision; 
however, you may not have time to adjust to darkness, or you 
may have to perform a critical task, such as map reading in 

Part I: Stayin’ Alive: Basic Wilderness Survival Principles

a dense forest on a moonless night. Luckily, your flashlight 
options are almost unlimited:
 
✓ LED keychain flashlights: This is the bare minimum. 
These tiny flashlights fit on your keychain or in your 
pocket, and they use LEDs, or light-emitting diodes. 
Because LEDs use only a tiny amount of energy, these 
lights last a long time on a single battery.
 
 Try to buy an LED flashlight with multiple bulbs, as 
opposed to a single bulb. They give off a lot of light for 
their size.
 
✓ Conventional penlights: These lights also fit on key-
chains, but unlike LEDs, they use conventional light 
bulbs and use up their batteries relatively quickly. 
Although they’re generally heavier, they’re brighter than 
LEDs. (See Figure 2-2g, later in this chapter.)
 
✓ Conventional flashlights: You can’t beat a conventional 
handheld flashlight in some scenarios. These are still 
the best if you have to shine a beam a long way or if you 
simply need a lot of light. Many companies make very 
good, midsized conventional flashlights that can fit in 
your pocket.
Fire maker
A fire maker, such as a lighter or magnesium bar, is mandatory 
because it gives you the ability to make heat, and in most 
cases, hypothermia poses an even greater threat than 
dehydration. Dying of dehydration takes anywhere from one 
to ten days, but you can die of hypothermia in less than 90 
minutes.
We discuss fire makers in more detail in the section titled 
“Building the basic survival kit,” later in this chapter. 
Unfortunately, the fire makers work only if you know how to 
build a fire. For more on fire, check out Chapter 5.
Penknife, pocketknife, or multitool
You don’t have to have a big, impressive knife in the wild 
(although it sure helps), but you do need to have some kind 
of blade. Your three main options — all of which have blades 
that fold down — are as follows:

 Chapter 2: Preparing Yourself for a Survival Situation 25
 
✓ Penknife: The smallest knife, the penknife, fits on a 
keychain. This little item may be the best purchase you 
ever make — even if you never set foot in the outdoors. 
Just make sure you take it off before you try to board a 
commercial airliner.
 
✓ Pocketknife: The next step up from the penknife is the 
small pocketknife. You can choose from infinite varieties. 
Regardless of which type you buy, it should have a hole 
at one end for a lanyard, a string that runs from the knife 
to your wrist, so you don’t lose your blade when you’re 
working. A 5-inch long folding pocketknife with a sturdy 
lanyard on it is a lifesaver.
 
✓ Multipurpose knife or multitool: The next step up is 
the multipurpose pocketknife, such as the Swiss Army 
knife, which has a variety of tools folded into one case 
(see Figure 2-2e, later in this chapter).
 
 Probably the handiest of the multipurpose knives is the 
multitool, which has blades and other utensils packed 
into a foldable pair of pliers. You can carry a multitool in 
your pocket, or better, in a pouch that fits on your belt. 
We talk more about knives later in “Building the basic 
survival kit.”
Water container
Staying hydrated keeps you strong and running at your peak. 
Carrying a good container gives you the ability to refill it 
easily. Keep in mind two ideas when buying and carrying a 
container:
 
✓ Durability and versatility: An army-style canteen is 
great, and better still is a water bottle that has a wide-
mouthed, screw-off top. This offers you the ability to 
easily scoop up water or collect rain. If you have nothing 
else, you can grab bottled water from the convenience 
store.
 
✓ Convenience in carrying: Many times, unbelievably, 
people who are lost discard equipment, clothing, water 
bottles, and so on — you don’t want that temptation.
 
 If you’re not using a pack of any type, know that water 
bottles tend to ride better on a crossover shoulder strap 
when they’re full and on your belt when they’re empty.

Part I: Stayin’ Alive: Basic Wilderness Survival Principles 
26
Instruments and electronics
If you have electronics and other related instruments within 
reach, grab them — even if you think you’re going to be 
beyond coverage. Examples include cellphones, any type 
of compass (Figure 2-2m, later in this chapter), and a GPS 
receiver (Figure 2-2n). For more on these types of equipment 
and how they can help you navigate, check out Chapter 9.
Building the basic survival kit
A good wilderness survival kit is a great asset when you 
go outdoors. Although some good kits are available on the 
market, we strongly suggest you make your own because you 
can be sure of the quality of the items inside it (and it’s also 
fun). The basic kit we discuss in this section weighs only a 
few pounds, and you can assemble it in a day. You can see a 
fully assembled survival kit in the section titled “Building the 
complete kit.”
We like to brag that you can fit this little kit into a large 
zipper-lock bag, but we suggest you find a sturdier container. 
Look for a container around your house, use an ammunition 
pouch from a surplus store, or your best bet, get a dry bag, 
a completely waterproof vinyl bag that you can get from a 
boating store. When you have the container you want, take 
a permanent marker and write your name and WILDERNESS 
SURVIVAL KIT in large letters on the container.
A complete fire-making kit
Your complete fire-making kit should contain at least three 
fire-making instruments and some tinder. Good fire-making 
instruments include the following:
 
✓ Lighters: Butane cigarette lighters (see Figure 2-2s) are 
good, but saltwater causes them to malfunction within 
just a few days. Long-nosed fireplace lighters, which are 
usually red and black in color, last much longer under 
corrosive conditions, and they’re generally superior 
to just about any other lighter. Some high-tech lighters 
claim to work in any conditions, but we take that claim 
with a grain of salt.

 Chapter 2: Preparing Yourself for a Survival Situation 27
 
 Some of our colleagues swear by Zippo lighters, which 
are metal cigarette lighters that use wicks soaked in 
lighter fluid. If you carry one, also carry spare flints and 
wicks.
 
✓ Matches: Carry two types: Plain, wooden, strike-anywhere 
matches and wooden waterproof matches that you can 
get at a boating supply store (Figure 2-2t).
 
✓ Magnesium bar (metal match): This is a tiny rod of metal 
that, when you shave it forcefully with a knife, produces 
a small pile of magnesium, which ignites under any 
conditions — even when wet! On top of the bar is flint, 
which produces a shower of white-hot sparks when you 
scrape it with a knife, igniting the magnesium (Figure 2-2i).
 
✓ Magnifying glass: Get a flat, flexible plastic magnifying 
glass, about the size of a credit card, to focus the sun’s 
rays on your tinder (Figure 2-2r).
Tinder is the highly flammable stuff you carry that starts a fire 
on the first try — even in wet conditions. A film canister filled 
with lint from your clothes dryer and treated with a couple 
of drops of lighter fluid or gasoline is good (Figure 2-2b), as 
is rolled newspaper dipped in paraffin wax. Some people like 
to stuff paper egg cartons with straw, pour in wax, and then 
separate each little pocket to create a set of fire starters. The 
wax and straw burn for as long as 10 minutes, giving you time 
to get your kindling started. You can also find prepackaged 
tinder at the outdoors stores.
Pack your fire-making instruments and tinder in a waterproof 
container, seal it with tape, and put it inside your survival kit.
Items for clean water, shelter, and sun protection
Pack the following items to help you take care of your basic 
needs for clean water and protection from the elements:
 
✓ Water purification chemicals: These are usually small 
tablets of chlorine or crystals of iodine. You can buy 
them at all outdoors stores. Follow the directions on the 
bottle, and expect to have to wait an hour or two for 
them to purify your water (see Figure 2-2w).

Part I: Stayin’ Alive: Basic Wilderness Survival Principles 
28
 
✓ Steel cup: A small metal cup is invaluable because you 
can boil water in it — which is still the very best way to 
disinfect water in the wild (Figure 2-2k).
 
✓ High-SPF sun block: Get the highest rating you can find 
in the smallest container you can, or transfer some into 
a separate, clean miniature bottle. Put this in a plastic 
zipper storage bag so it doesn’t leak on everything else 
(Figure 2-2x).
 
✓ Plastic painter’s tarp: In an emergency, you can build a 
waterproof shelter with this tarp, or you can use it as a 
ground cloth or a water catcher (Figure 2-2a).
 
✓ Space blanket: A space blanket is a large and very thin 
sheet of plastic, coated with a reflective material that 
traps body heat (Figure 2-2q). These blankets can be 
invaluable on a cold night, and you can spread the 
bright, mirror-like surface out on the ground as a signaling 
device. We suggest putting two in your survival kit.
Tools for making other things
Wilderness survival usually involves a fair amount of 
improvisation. You may have to make your own shelter, 
clothing, or weapons for hunting. Pack the following tools so 
you can cut, tie, cover, tape, and light your way to safety:
 
✓ A second knife: Even if you already have a small knife 
or multitool (refer to the “Five items always to have” 
section, earlier in this chapter), a large knife is 
indispensable in a real survival situation (see Figure 2-2d). 
If you get into a serious situation, you have to use this 
knife to dig, pry, hammer, and do just about everything 
else.
 
 Look for a substantial knife that you can really punish 
without having it break. Many folding blades are excellent, 
but you should consider getting a knife made from a 
single piece of steel — these knives usually require a 
sheath.
 
✓ Rope and wire: You frequently have to bind things 
together or make improvised repairs in the wild, so carry 
some cordage. Here’s what to pack:

 Chapter 2: Preparing Yourself for a Survival Situation 29
 
• The easiest cordage to carry is the ready-made 
30-foot lengths of parachute cord (Figure 2-2j), 
which you can buy at outdoors stores. This is a 
lightweight line that has an infinite number of uses.
 
• A small spool of thin metal wire is also a life-saving, 
multipurpose item.
 
• For small jobs, consider carrying a spool of 
50-pound-test monofilament fishing line or unwaxed 
dental floss.
 
✓ Plastic garbage bags: You can use plastic bags (Figure 
2-2l) as containers and as improvised rain ponchos. Get 
three or four bags of the heaviest gauge you can find.
 
✓ Duct tape and safety pins: You can use these items when 
you have to bind, repair, and seal all sorts of things in a 
crisis (Figure 2-2y).
 
✓ A spare flashlight: You need a backup flashlight. You can 
carry a medium-sized conventional flashlight if you have 
room.
 
 A really good idea is to carry a headlamp, such as a Petzl 
lamp, with a halogen bulb (www.petzl.com/en). The 
benefits are threefold: it uses less battery power than a 
conventional flashlight, it throws off an intense light, and 
you wear it on your forehead, thus freeing the hand that 
would normally carry a flashlight.
 
 Reverse the batteries when you stow the spare flashlight 
in your kit — that way, they won’t run down if the light is 
accidentally turned on. Remember: Take plenty of extra 
batteries. You never know how long you may be out 
there.
Navigation stuff
The following items can help you find your way — and 
eventually, your way out (for info on using navigation 
equipment, see Chapter 9):
 
✓ Compass: Even if you’ve never used one, this handy item 
can reveal things to you that nothing else can — namely 
which way you’re going! Like your knife, your compass 
should have a hole for a lanyard. If you have a choice, 
opt for an orienteering compass, which is molded into a 
baseplate (see Figure 2-2m).

Part I: Stayin’ Alive: Basic Wilderness Survival Principles 
30
 
✓ Map of the area: Any map is better than none, and 
practically every map is useful in some way (Figure 2-2o). 
If you head off into the wild, USGS topographic maps are 
usually the best. Almost all ranger stations have maps, 
and the National Park Service (maps.nps.gov) as well 
as National Geographic (maps.nationalgeographic.
com) have some online. International Travel Maps, which 
you can find at the local bookstore, are also very good.
 
✓ Electronics: If they’re within reach, grab them — even if 
you think you’re going to be beyond coverage (Figure 2-2n).
Tools for signaling
Use these items when the going really gets rough and you 
have to send a distress signal (for more on distress signals, 
see Chapter 12):
 
✓ Signal mirror: Use a mirror to signal for help during the 
day. You can get a good signal mirror (Figure 2-2h) at an 
outdoors or boating store.
 
✓ Whistle: A high-pitched whistle can be heard for miles 
and is vastly better than using your voice. You can 
usually purchase a signal whistle in the same place you 
find signal mirrors (Figure 2-2f).
Building the complete kit
If you have a daypack or a full backpack, or if you’re traveling in 
a car or boat, you can carry a more complete kit (see Figure 2-2).

Figure 2-2: The complete survival kit.

 Chapter 2: Preparing Yourself for a Survival Situation 31
Here’s what goes in the complete kit. The items on this list are 
in addition to the basic kit we discuss in the preceding section, 
and they give you a lot of staying power in the wilderness.
 
✓ Bivy sack (bivouac sack): These are fabric bags that 
work like improvised sleeping bags/tents (see Figure 
2-2q). Along with a space blanket or two, they can save 
your life in the cold.
 
✓ Heavy duty camel bag: A camel bag, sometimes called 
a camelback, is a flexible bladder that fits on your back 
like backpack and has a tube that you drink from (Figure 
2-2u). These are the very best water-carrying devices.
 
✓ First aid kit and pamphlet: Dozens of premade first aid 
kits are available (Figure 2-2p). Good first aid kits come 
with pamphlets reminding you how to deal with cuts, 
burns, infections, broken limbs, and so on. We cover 
wilderness first aid in Chapter 13.
 
✓ Map collection: Collect any map you can. Anything 
helps — even sightseeing or tourist maps, because each 
map contains a different type of info. Put your maps in a 
zipper-lock plastic bag.
 
✓ Sewing needles, thread, and buttons: Being able to 
repair your clothing is important, as is the ability to 
improvise clothing from scraps of fabric, plastic, and so 
on. You can carry several needles in a survival kit. We 
suggest large, heavy needles, at least 2 inches long, 
with large eyes that are easy to thread with a variety of 
cordage (Figure 2-2c). Also carry some large buttons, 
which you can use to repair or improvise clothing.
 
✓ Flexible straw/surgical tubing: You can use tubing 
(Figure 2-2z) to suck water out of small crevices in rocks 
when you can’t get water in any other way.
 
✓ Candles and spare wicks (Figure 2-2aa): Before you buy 
candles, be sure you know how long they’ll burn. Some 
types can burn for 6 hours and are favorites among 
mountaineers, who know a thing or two about long, cold 
nights. You can use them for light or to start fires.
 
✓ Wire saw: You can buy wire saws (Figure 2-2bb) at outdoors 
stores. Use these flexible tools to cut off tree branches.
 
✓ Gloves: Heavy-duty yard gloves (Figure 2-2cc) can give 
you an almost superhuman ability in the wild — the only 
problem is that these types don’t have a lot of dexterity.

Part I: Stayin’ Alive: Basic Wilderness Survival Principles 
32
 
✓ Food: Good old-fashioned granola bars (Figure 2-2dd) 
can help a lot in a demoralizing situation. Nuts are good, 
as are packets of soup — just make sure they don’t have 
excess salt in them. If they do, they’re diuretics, and they 
don’t help you in the end.
 
✓ Mini fishing kit: These kits (Figure 2-2v) are so lightweight 
and useful that you should squeeze in a couple of them if 
you have room. These aren’t just for fishing — the hooks 
and the fishing line have a million and one uses.
 
You may also want to include an extremely lightweight 
insulator that you spread on the ground to sleep on. This pad 
prevents the ground cold from getting to your body and can 
prevent hypothermia during the night.
Gathering equipment for 
going out on the water
If you’re going to be out on a ship or boat, be prepared with 
the right equipment. Most importantly, you need a personal 
flotation device, or PFD, for everyone on board. All PFDs are 
labeled by type:
 
✓ Type I: These life jackets are the best. They keep you 
afloat in heavy seas, and they turn you right-side-up if 
you’ve been knocked unconscious.
 
✓ Type II: These vests are for near-shore activities, and they 
don’t turn you right-side-up if you’re knocked unconscious.
 
✓ Type III: These floatation aids are used when water-
skiing or duck hunting. Don’t use these in the ocean.
 
✓ Type IV: These are life rings and seat cushions, and 
they’re designed to be thrown to someone in peril.
 
✓ Type V: These are work vests, and they usually look like a 
harness. They’re designed to inflate in time of emergency.
Also, we suggest that you always have a spare propulsion 
device, such as an extra paddle or oar. Check with your outfit-
ter or the U.S. Coast Guard to see what’s required by law to be 
aboard any vessel you rent.

The Psychology of Survival: 
Gaining the Upper Hand
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding your emotions during a survival situation
▶ Understanding how survivors think
▶ Building morale
M
ore often than not, survival situations catch you off 
guard. They’re nothing like you expected, and the 
mindset that you always wanted to have in a crisis suddenly 
seems foreign. There’s no background music, like in the 
movies, and there’s nothing heroic about the situation at all. 
But with a little understanding, perhaps you can find that 
inner heroic survivor and bring him or her to the surface.
In this chapter, we discuss the mindset you need to get 
through a survival situation, what you can expect to feel when 
the crisis comes, and how you can expect others to act — or 
react — when things go bad. We also show you how you can 
boost your morale.
Getting into the Right Mindset
The psychological factor — in other words, having the right 
mindset about the experience — is the most important com-
ponent in any survival situation. It’s more important than 
training, knowledge, experience, odds, or luck. How you per-
ceive what’s happening to you dictates your ability to perform 
and to survive.

34
Part I: Stayin’ Alive: Basic Wilderness Survival Principles 
 
You need to remember one startling fact when facing a sur-
vival situation: Many people succumb — they give up and 
perish — before they’re physically overwhelmed. They give 
up trying to get into a life raft after just a few tries, or they 
lie down on the trail after just a few days or even hours of 
misery. Their perception, and therefore their belief, is that the 
situation is beyond their means or that the struggle simply 
isn’t worth it. If you’ve ever had the misfortune to see this, 
then you know, as we do, that it’s one of the most bizarre, 
unfathomable characteristics of humankind.
Just knowing that this problem exists can be a huge advan-
tage for you in a survival situation. Even more, knowing 
how to summon up some coping mechanisms can help you 
manufacture — in the field — the mentality that gives you 
the power to hold out longer, push further, and endure more, 
which is the essence of survival. This section explains how to 
develop a survivor’s mindset and how to stay focused when 
you’re in a survival situation.
Mastering disbelief
All survival situations are extraordinary — especially when 
they’re happening to you. Many times, the events leave 
people so stunned with disbelief that they take action very 
slowly or not at all.
 
To master disbelief, you need to know that most survival situ-
ations feel unfair: You just went for a swim, and now you’re 5 
miles offshore, dragged out by a current. Or perhaps you’re in 
familiar territory, hiking, and you have lots of experience, but 
Hundreds of miles from land
In 1995, a U.S. Marine stepped out 
on the deck of an aircraft carrier for 
a little air and promptly fell off the 
boat — in the middle of the Arabian 
Sea. The fleet sailed away into the 
night and there he was, with no flo-
tation, no land for hundreds of miles, 
treading water — a single head in 
a vast, empty plain of waves. The 
odds of surviving were off the scale, 
but nonetheless, he made a flotation 
device by inflating his pants and then 
held on for 34 hours — until he was 
picked up by Pakistani fishermen.

 Chapter 3: The Psychology of Survival: Gaining the Upper Hand 35
now you’re lost and an unexpected cold front is coming in. It’s 
not fair, but it’s reality. Some of the most gruesome, incom-
prehensible stories of survival revolve around not being able 
to master disbelief.
Make sure you do the following to help you fully accept your 
situation.
Realize that it’s happening to you
Some people simply can’t get over the outrage of being put in 
such a position. Don’t let this happen to you. It is unfair, but 
nonetheless, you’re in a survival situation, so fair or unfair is 
irrelevant. Now, that doesn’t make the ordeal one ounce more 
pleasant, but it gives you strength, and the more quickly the 
idea of what’s happening sinks in, the better. Only the inexpe-
rienced think this idea is obvious or easy.
 
Keep in mind that modern ships still sink, people with GPS units 
still get lost, friends who are just trying to have a nice time still 
fall into disaster. Realize this immediately and start planning 
proactive procedures to save yourself and your companions.
Dismiss the odds of surviving
Don’t believe that the odds of surviving are just too low. You 
have to dismiss that type of thinking.
 
Statistics and odds mean nothing after you go into action. If 
you spend enough time studying the history of human beings 
in impossible conditions — survivors — you begin to see that 
people survive “the impossible” quite frequently. Realize that 
thousands of people before you have survived these types of 
perilous situations. These people are just like you — they look 
like you, they talk like you — they’re usually not supermen or 
superwomen. They’re just like you. And they made it.
Working with stress and fear
After you realize you’re in a survival situation, you can expect 
a flood of stress and fear. Stress and fear are necessary 
because they make you stronger and more alert — but only 
if you control them. People who don’t have any fear get com-
placent and get themselves into trouble — we know, because 
we’ve done it! What’s most important is how you channel this 
emotional response.

Part I: Stayin’ Alive: Basic Wilderness Survival Principles 
36
 
You can be scared and still function and still succeed. What 
you need is self-control; otherwise, your thinking becomes 
muddled. Here are some methods of controlling fear and gain-
ing the upper hand:
 
✓ Take a deep breath and slow your heart rate. Simply 
realize that your heart is racing, and relax. Relax your 
shoulders — let them sag a bit — and then stretch your 
neck. Draw in a deep breath through your nose and let 
it out through your mouth. Your heart rate should slow 
down a little.
 
✓ Take inventory. Get a total grip on your situation. Where 
are you? What are your options? How can you improve 
your situation? Consider taking a piece of paper and writ-
ing down the history of your situation. For example, note 
when and where you saw the last familiar landmark, as 
well as what your threats are and your options for deal-
ing with them. Plans and escapes present themselves 
when you do this, and you gain strength by being 
proactive.
 
✓ Boil things down to their basics. Ask yourself what 
exactly you’re facing here. This is a good exercise 
because it reduces your situation from “the whole world 
against you” to just one or two problems.
 
✓ Get to work. Do something — anything at all — to take 
your mind off the situation.
 
✓ Get angry. Anger can be super-potent, even in the weak-
est people. If you need a serious burst of strength, take 
a moment to get seriously angry. Refuse to accept that 
some small mistake is reason to lose your life.
 
✓ Get some contempt. Tell nature and fear and every-
thing else to shove it. Refuse to give in. Feel free to be 
obstinate — it works.
 
✓ Become resigned to the fact that you’re in extreme 
peril. Many survivors have made it through their dark-
est hours by resigning themselves to the moment, by 
taking the attitude that come what may, they’re going 
to keep fighting. Many have looked at death and said to 
themselves that they don’t care if they live or die — but 
they’re not going to give in. This is grim business, indeed, 
but it has worked in many cases.

 Chapter 3: The Psychology of Survival: Gaining the Upper Hand 37
 
✓ Try the tire-changing mentality. Instead of flying into 
frenzied action, act like you’re just changing a tire. Just 
go to work, one thing at time. The no-nonsense body 
language that comes from this mentality can give you a 
clear head in an instant — and it has a miraculous effect 
on others around you. Frequently, when they see you act 
this way, they adopt this mentality for themselves. Soon, 
you have a cool-headed group working through a serious 
problem. We’ve used this technique in the middle of the 
night when there was panic all around us and our vessel 
was in trouble, and it worked.
Planning and taking action
As you calm your stress and fears, you also need to clear 
your head and think to the future with a clear plan. In stress-
ful situations, your thinking can become muddled. Confusion 
and bad plans can take over quickly, so make sure you put 
together a thorough plan before doing anything.
 
To make your plan so you can take action, keep the following 
suggestions in mind:
 
✓ Eliminate as much physical misery as you can. Cold, 
hunger, being soaked, injury — any of these can cloud 
your judgment. With that in mind, take inventory and try 
to relieve yourself of some small — or large — misery if 
you can. You may find that suddenly your mind clears 
and that making good plans isn’t hard after all.
 
✓ Observe carefully. These types of situations can close 
off your powers of perception. You may have options 
right in front of your nose that you can’t see or haven’t 
even considered. Take time to take it all in, and never, 
ever assume that you see everything.
 
✓ Give yourself an extra choice. In emergency situa-
tions, the either/or decision-making loop can blind you 
to options that are in fact right in front of your face. 
We know that not every situation has a wide array of 
options, but if you have an either/or decision in front of 
you and both are bad, try coming up with a third — the 
results may shock you and even give you strength.

Part I: Stayin’ Alive: Basic Wilderness Survival Principles 
38
 
 After you come up with a third option, continue to 
expand outward. View the problem from a new perspec-
tive. There may be a fourth option you haven’t thought 
of — or maybe even a fifth. Never assume you’ve thought 
of everything.
 
✓ Keep in mind that survival can be a war of attrition — 
a fight in which small, persistent actions allow you to 
succeed. Your first plans may fail. That isn’t a sign or 
an indication that you’re not going to make it. On the 
contrary, you frequently have to work through several 
failures before you get to something that works. Just take 
a lesson from every failure.
If you can’t solve your problem immediately, you may be 
able to improve your position. Small steps can help a lot. Just 
about any action is better than none, and some small success 
can lead to another. The more action you take, the more confi-
dence you feel.
Understanding discipline
Much of your chances for survival revolve around how well 
you stay disciplined and practice self-denial. The more you 
can conserve, the better. You’re in the business of holding 
out, hanging on, and extending your reserves. Discipline your-
self. Tell yourself that using small amounts — of water, food, 
electrical power, and so on — is going to save your life.
 
Disciplining yourself is especially important when using sig-
nals. Be careful to not let fear run away with the moment. 
You can easily waste flares that nobody sees or run radios 
that have only a limited amount of battery time if you’re not 
careful. In a survival situation, those who can discipline them-
selves are usually the ones who make it out.
Valuing life and home
One way to get in the right mindset is to value living and 
value your life. In many cases, this simple idea gets lost in 
the moment. Realize that your life is valuable, that it’s worth 
saving, and that you still have a lot of good living to do.

 Chapter 3: The Psychology of Survival: Gaining the Upper Hand 39
 
Keep in mind that people want you to return. Picturing their 
grief can be a powerful tool in motivating yourself to stay 
alive. Many survivors have done this. Know that you can 
cause great suffering to those back home if you don’t survive 
and that you have a duty to them, and to your own life, to stay 
alive. Picture the faces of your family, your friends. This frame 
of mind can carry you through when no other can.
Using humor and a 
positive attitude
Optimism and a positive attitude can turn a bad situation 
around in a second. We’ve seen people use positive thinking 
in the field. The effect really is incredible. Many lifeboat survi-
vors can attest to the fact that a smile and a joke — no matter 
how strained — can give you hope.
Group decision-making: Getting people 
in a crisis to cooperate
Getting a group to be disciplined can 
be exceedingly difficult. For many 
people, this may be the first time 
they’ve ever had to go on rationed 
food or water, and they rebel. And 
food and water aren’t the only pos-
sible sticking points. Whenever your 
group has to make a decision — 
whether deciding when to stop for 
the night, coordinating your open-
sea fishing team, or figuring out 
which way is north — you have a 
potential for conflict.
When working with a group, explain 
everything in full. Try to be as con-
vincing as you can. One of the best 
ways to do this is to look at the faces 
around you and make a quick asso-
ciation with those who are cool-
headed and fully functional. Try to 
get a majority, and try to explain the 
wisest course of action.
If possible, try not to enforce deci-
sions through power and might. 
However, you may have to. You may 
have to guard the water, take dan-
gerous tools and objects away from 
irrational people, and even physically 
restrain someone who’s doing some-
thing that’s going to get you killed.
If you have people who simply won’t 
cooperate, you may have to go it 
alone. Many times, groups go off and 
do incredibly unwise things. You can 
always abstain from this; you don’t 
have to go along with a group that’s 
determined to destroy itself.

Although a humorous comment can alleviate stress and 
defuse a situation, comments that appear callous can be 
harmful. Sometimes you have to be sensitive. Pick and choose 
your moments for levity carefully.
 
You should try to celebrate sometimes and be proud of your-
self. Survival, more often than not, is a clumsy business. You 
get very few clean successes, and it’s easy to see how imper-
fect your progress is. We’ve had times when we were making 
progress in the face of very grim circumstances, but because 
the progress was small, the pessimists among us used it 
to show how we were failing. Don’t let this happen to you. 
Survival is about tiny victories. When you win, give yourself 
credit. It makes you stronger.
Being Aware of Your Emotions
Real survival situations bring out all kinds of spontaneous 
reactions in you and others that you may have never consid-
ered. This section looks at some of the common emotions you 
and your group may feel and how you can cope with them.
Thankfully, there are practical ways to fight all the emotions 
we talk about in this section. You can strengthen yourself 
in the field by taking just a few of the practical steps in the 
upcoming section “Improving Morale.”
Optimism on ice
Perhaps the greatest expedition 
leader of the 20th century, Sir Ernest 
Shackleton, himself a survivor, 
always maintained a cheerful atti-
tude no matter how bad things got. 
His results were nothing short of 
miraculous. He kept all his men alive 
through a year-long ordeal when they 
were stranded on Antarctica with no 
support. He knew that optimism was 
the highest quality a person could 
have when facing a survival situa-
tion, and he never allowed dark talk 
or bad attitudes.

 Chapter 3: The Psychology of Survival: Gaining the Upper Hand 41
Fear
Fear is the most common emotion people in survival situa-
tions feel. Fear is a reaction to uncertainty, and it can range 
from a simmering anxiety to heart-stopping terror. You should 
expect it and know how to use it to your advantage. We talk 
about taking advantage of this emotion in the section “Getting 
into the Right Mindset,” earlier in this chapter.
In surveys of lost persons, some fears tend to crop up again 
and again. None of these will come as a surprise, but knowing 
that others have experienced these feelings can be reassuring. 
Here are some top wilderness fears:
 
✓ Being alone
 
✓ The night
 
✓ Suffering and pain
 
✓ The unknown
 
✓ Death
 
✓ Animal attack
 
Trying to take on all your fears at once can incapacitate you 
quickly. Any of the preceding threats can come upon you, but 
you probably won’t have to face all at once, and none of them 
may develop into real threats at all. If you must think about 
them, take one at a time. Boil down your situation: What are 
you really facing?
For more on how to cope with fear, check out the “Working 
with stress and fear” section earlier in this chapter.
Panic
Panic is the most counterproductive emotion you can feel in a 
crisis. Realize that if you panic, you lose. The most important 
action you can take is to practice self-awareness, to realize 
which direction you’re going, and to reel yourself back in.

Part I: Stayin’ Alive: Basic Wilderness Survival Principles 
42
If you feel an enormous surge of fear rushing over you, or if 
you feel your body actually speeding up — such as hiking 
faster or shaking — immediately recognize that you’re think-
ing in the wrong way, and pull tightly on your own personal 
leash. Self control may feel unnatural, but it makes you very 
strong in the field, and ultimately, it saves lives.
 
Some people around you are going to go into a panic and lose 
their heads. These reactions, such as shouting and scream-
ing, can be severe and very disturbing. Unfortunately, the 
Hollywood cliché of someone yelling, “We’re all going to die!” 
is all too real sometimes. Expect it. Be ready for it. Some 
people are unstable, and they explode in the shrillest of fash-
ions in these situations. Don’t let it unnerve you or influence 
you into doing something stupid.
Understanding Lost Person Behavior
Lost Person Behavior (LPB) exam-
ines case histories of people who’ve 
gone lost and tries to find common 
denominators. Over the years, LPB 
has revealed some common mistakes 
that people make when they’re lost. 
Make sure you don’t commit them.
 ✓ Speeding up: In most cases, as 
soon as people suspect they’re 
lost, they speed up. They don’t 
exactly start running; they just 
start hiking much, much faster, 
which usually only gets them lost 
much, much quicker.
 ✓ Disbelieving instruments or 
maps: This happens with com-
passes, GPS units, and most 
especially maps. Trust your 
instruments and the map.
 ✓ Disrobing and discarding equip-
ment: Never leave anything 
behind. Find a way to carry it — 
you’ll invariably end up need-
ing it.
 ✓ Lying down: Sometimes the size 
of the wilderness simply over-
comes people, and they lie down 
and give up.
 ✓ Assuming no one will come 
looking for you: Don’t assume 
that no one will come looking for 
you. Be ready to signal.
 ✓ Traveling in the direction of 
least resistance: When lost, 
many people take wrong turns on 
the trail intentionally because a 
particular part of the trail simply 
looks easier to walk on. Think 
through your trail junctions. 
Another path-of-least-resistance 
error is to go down a slope, even 
though it’s not the way back.

 Chapter 3: The Psychology of Survival: Gaining the Upper Hand 43
Irrationality
Frequently, people in survival situations act in completely 
irrational ways — ways that can astonish you. We’re not talk-
ing about panic here; we’re talking about irrational thinking. 
People sometimes refuse to cooperate even though their lives 
depend on it, or they sometimes commit acts that put you and 
your party in even more danger than you’re already in!
 
As soon as you know you have an unstable or irrational 
person on your hands, you have to be ready for that person 
to do anything. People can sabotage equipment, foil plans, and 
commit acts that can kill the whole group. Watch irrational 
people carefully, and never trust them with anything, even if 
they seem to get better. You may have to restrain them or at 
least assign someone to watch them.
Anger and blame
Many times, people in survival situations are overcome by 
guilt for having gotten themselves into such a mess. If you 
find yourself feeling this way, don’t despair; forgive yourself 
immediately. If someone else caused it, forgive them. Regret, 
anger, and blame only distract you and waste precious time 
and energy.
Misery and fatigue
Misery and fatigue can amplify the feeling of despair to the 
point where it seems that you can’t possibly make it. You 
can gain strength from self awareness and self inventory. Be 
honest with yourself: You’re hot, you’re cold, you’re hurt, 
you’re fatigued, you’re frankly scared. Then admit that these 
feelings and conditions warp your judgment and make every-
thing seem hopeless.
 
Some people wilt very quickly. The desire to keep going dies 
and the will to live or just to save themselves dries up. This 
reaction can discourage and demoralize you if you misinter-
pret it. People decline unevenly, but someone else’s decline 
isn’t a sign that you have to decline, too. For some sugges-
tions on slowing this decline, or sometimes even reversing it, 
see the next section.

Part I: Stayin’ Alive: Basic Wilderness Survival Principles 
44
Improving Morale
 
The more you improve your morale, the stronger you 
become. The situation is serious, but you can give yourself an 
emotional boost by doing the following:
 
✓ Get ready for night. Be prepared to face the night, to 
have to wait it out. Start thinking about coping with the 
night before it comes — even if it’s 3:00 in the afternoon. 
When the sun goes down, every problem you have is 
going to be harder to handle, even if you have flashlights. 
Solve as many problems as you can before the sun sets.
 
 Also, know that you can function in the dark. You may be 
on a sharp learning curve, to be sure, but you can over-
come night paralysis.
 
✓ Assume a positive attitude. Sometimes improving your 
outlook can be as simple as stretching a smile across 
your face when you don’t feel like smiling at all. If you 
have a series of failures, undertake a minor task that you 
know you can achieve. Doing so can help you regain your 
confidence.
 
✓ Warm up. A fire, a hot cup of water, or just a hat or a 
coat can clear your head. If you’re feeling confused or 
fatigued and you have the ability, do something to warm 
your body.
 
✓ Clean up. Try to keep up your cleanliness in the field. It 
promotes clear thinking and calms you and your com-
panions. Pull your hair out of your face, wash your face, 
and take a moment to remove irritants. Inspect your 
body. Look for wounds and clean them if you can.
 
✓ Adjust your clothing. If your clothes are chafing you, 
locate the problem and eliminate it. Some small discom-
fort can take away your strength overnight.
 
✓ Get something in your stomach. A hot meal or some hot 
liquid can sometimes give people a lot of strength. Some 
people decline very quickly when there’s nothing to eat. 
Remember: Deciding to eat or drink has to be a judgment 
call. If water is scarce, don’t eat (see Chapter 7 for why 
you shouldn’t eat if you don’t have water). Also, worrying 
about food when you should be trying to figure out how 
to get out of your predicament is sometimes a dubious 
decision.

Survival Style: Keeping 
Warm or Cool
In This Chapter
▶ Grasping how the human body regulates temperature
▶ Understanding the principles of cold- and hot-weather clothing
▶ Knowing how to improvise survival clothing
▶ Working in the cool of the night
I
n any survival situation, you have to know how to warm up 
if you’re cold and how to cool down if you’re hot. At home, 
you control temperature with air conditioning, central heating, 
sweaters, flip-flops, or what-have-you. But if you find yourself 
in desolate snow-covered mountains wearing just jeans and a 
t-shirt, things are going to go bad, fast. Even if you have plenty 
of food and water supplies, none of that can help you if you 
succumb to hypothermia.
In this chapter, we cover the basics of temperature regulation 
in wilderness survival situations. We tell you how to stay 
warm or cool with certain kinds of clothes (and how to 
improvise them) and discuss strategies for staying cool in 
hot environments. (Note: We detail shelters for hot and cold 
environments in Chapter 6.)
Regulating Body Temperature
The human body, tough as it is, is really comfortable in only 
a pretty narrow temperature margin. Above 75°F (24°C), most 
people begin to feel too hot, and below about 50°F (10°C), 

Part I: Stayin’ Alive: Basic Wilderness Survival Principles 
46
most people start to feel chilly. Figure 4-1 shows specific 
effects of air temperature on the body.

Zipless at 40 below
In March 2007, I (Cameron) was 
trekking alone on Alaska’s North 
Slope to learn about the beautiful 
world of the tundra in winter. One 
day, while testing a new clothing 
system, I felt myself getting colder by 
the minute. My experimental system 
wasn’t working, and I knew that if I 
felt cold, my body was screaming at 
me to do something to warm up.
I should have listened, but I pressed 
on, thinking, “Oh just do another hour. 
You’ve been plenty cold before.” 
This was an almost fatal mistake. 
Soon my body was conserving 
heat in emergency mode, calling 
warm blood in from my extremities to 
keep my core organs warm (fingers, 
toes, and nose freeze first). Before 
I knew it, my hands and feet were 
profoundly numb.
To warm up, I stopped dragging my 
sled and instantly tried to put on a 
heavy parka, one that I’d used to bring 
me back from the brink many times. 
I knew that if I just got the zipper 
up, my core temperature would rise 
enough that my body would let blood 
back into my fingers and toes.
When I had the zipper halfway 
up, though, the little metal pull-tab 
snapped off in my glove. It was 
a cheap zipper I’d sewn onto my 
customized parka. I stopped breathing. 
With my whole chest uninsulated, 
I was in real trouble, and my hands 
were so useless that making some 
kind of repair was unthinkable. 
Without my hands, I might not be able 
to set up my tent and get inside, out 
of the wind, to get warm. This was no 
spectacular Hollywood moment, but 
the situation was potentially lethal.
With near-useless hands, setting up 
my tent took an hour — it normally 
took about three minutes. Using my 
teeth and the heels of my mittens 
as crude clamps, somehow I 
managed to get the tent up and 
crawled into my sleeping bag, and 
somehow I opened my thermos 
flask to get some hot liquid into my 
guts. An hour later, the crisis was 
over as hot blood flooded back into 
my fingers and toes. Rewarming felt 
exactly like when you hit your thumb 
with a hammer, but it went on for half 
an hour or so, on every fingertip and 
toe.
My parka is in my closet now, and 
on my list of things to do before I 
go back to Alaska is “replace parka 
zipper with sturdier.”

The body’s internal temperature is different from the air 
temperature. Internal temperature is normally about 97–98.6°F 
(36.1–37°C); if it rises above 104°F (40°C), you suffer the 
effects of heat stroke (a form of hyperthermia), and if it dips 
below 95°F (35°C), you begin to suffer from hypothermia. 
We introduce these conditions later in this section, and we 
discuss how to recognize and deal with them in detail in 
Chapters 17 and 13, respectively.
 
The sensations of uncomfortable heat or cold are your body’s 
signal that something’s wrong! Don’t try to just headbang 
your way though uncomfortable temperatures. If you feel 
uncomfortably cold or hot, use the techniques we describe in 
this chapter to regulate your temperature.
The cold continuum: What happens 
as your body cools
When the body cools below the optimal temperature of 
97–98.6°F (36.1–37°C), you begin to feel the effects of 
hypothermia. Hypothermia is a debilitating reduction of body 
temperature (you can identify hypothermia by the symptoms 
we outline in Chapter 13). Unless you do something to stop 
cooling, you can easily slip into a lethal hypothermic coma. 
It’s that serious. Table 4-1 shows you what can happen when 
your body cools.

Luckily, you can do plenty of things to stay warm, and we 
cover them in most of the rest of this chapter.
 
People have survived many situations that tables and charts, 
or doctors themselves, would call “clearly unsurvivable.” 
Never give up; however cold you or your companions are, 
don’t write anyone off. Keep at it. Keep trying.
The heat continuum: What happens 
as your body heats
When the body overheats, the effects can be as lethal as 
when it cools beyond a certain point. Hyperthermia occurs 
when your body suffers from overheating. You can identify 
hyperthermia by the symptoms we detail in Chapter 17.
Table 4-2 shows you what can happen when your body heats. 
Body temperature begins to be dangerous around 104°F (40°C), 
and by 106°F (41.1°C), brain damage can occur. Around 120°F 
(48.9°C), your body goes rigid, and soon thereafter you die. But 
you can do plenty to prevent this scenario.

Relying on Layering for Warmth
All clothing that keeps you warm works on the same principle; 
it traps a layer of warm air, normally warmed by your own 
body, between you and the elements. Layering involves using 
several garments to trap layers of air (such as wearing three 
thin sweaters instead of just one thick one), and it’s an 

Part I: Stayin’ Alive: Basic Wilderness Survival Principles 
50
important basic principle of cold-weather clothing. This 
section explains the importance of layering to keep you warm 
and suggests how to layer your own clothing.
Avoiding a cold sweat
You should wear several layers of clothing that you can add 
to or take off, depending on your activity level. When you 
start to sweat, you can take off a layer or two.
 
Sweat is your number-one enemy in cold-weather situations 
for a few important reasons:
 
✓ Sweat deprives you of bodily fluids, leading to 
dehydration. Dehydration worsens hypothermia.
 
✓ As sweat evaporates, it cools your body and brings on the 
onset of hypothermia much faster than if you were dry.
 
✓ Sweat can soak your insulating layers, making them stick 
together so that they no longer effectively trap a layer of 
warm air, ruining their insulation properties.
Although a single, heavy layer — such as a parka — definitely 
keeps you warm, it also makes you sweat, even if you’re just 
moving around camp or chopping wood. But with layers, 
you can add to them or strip them off according to your 
circumstances.
If you’re breaking up firewood, plowing your way through 
knee-deep snow, or doing other similar heavy work, strip off 
a layer or two to prevent sweat from soaking your insulating 
layers. On the other hand, when you’re doing less strenuous 
work — such as butchering an animal, setting traps, fishing, 
or washing plant foods — you’re best off wearing more layers.
 
Because keeping warm mainly relies on trapping a layer of 
warm air next to your body, you should always try to keep your 
clothes dry in a survival situation. If it’s raining, you’re going to 
have to wait before really drying your clothes (unless you’re 
lucky enough to have access to a cave or can use a tarp to 
protect your fire from the rain). If you’re caught in a downpour, 
use whatever you can (such as the space blanket or a plastic bag 
from your survival kit) as shelter from the rain and make a fire as 
soon as it stops raining. If you can’t make a fire, you can at least 
wring out your clothes and hang them in direct sunlight.

 Chapter 4: Survival Style: Keeping Warm or Cool 51
Choosing your layers
The good news is that layering clothing is straightforward. 
A good layering system for temperatures around freezing 
includes the following:
 
✓ Base layer: The base layer should be something like long 
johns. Avoid cotton, because of all the outdoor clothing 
you can use in cold-weather environments, cotton has 
the least capacity to trap warm air and keep you warm, 
particularly when it gets wet.
 
✓ Thermal layer: Wear wool, pile, or fleece, a wool-like 
synthetic material that retains its insulation properties 
even when wet.
 
✓ Shell layer: Wear a shell layer to protect you and your 
insulation layers from wind and moisture. Ideally, the 
layer is breathable, meaning that it lets sweat vapor out 
but doesn’t let water droplets in — that’s the main 
characteristic of waterproof/breathable shell layers, 
such as those made of Gore-Tex or its equivalents.
 
 Ideally, your jacket or shell layer should have zippers 
along the underside of the arms and along the outside 
of the legs. Zipping these openings up or down controls 
the flow of air into your clothes, allowing you to remain 
properly ventilated so you sweat less.
When you begin to feel too warm, start by taking off the shell 
layer, and then, if needed, remove the second (thermal) layer, 
still leaving you with the base layer. In many cases, such as 
hiking or doing other similar heavy work, you can work with 
the shell layer over the base layer, preventing overheating. 
When you stop moving, though, you may put a sweater 
(thermal layer) on over the base layer and then put the shell 
back on as well to give you three layers.
 
Of course, in wilderness survival situations, you don’t always 
have the luxury of wearing a perfect three-layer insulation 
system. Here’s where you have to be creative. If you’re 
scavenging supplies from some kind of wreck (such as from 
a boat, car, or plane), keep your eyes out for any textile not 
made from cotton. If cotton is all you have, so be it; but don’t 
forget, you do much better with something else (just about 
anything) if you’re trying to keep warm.

Improvising Cold-Weather 
Clothing
If you don’t have access to nice, dry, cold-weather clothing, 
you have to improvise. You just need to know a few basic 
skills and apply them with some creativity to improvise with 
cold-weather clothing.
For improvising cold-weather clothing, the best guides are 
the native people of the polar regions, who’ve adapted to 
various wildernesses for thousands of years. Their invaluable 
expertise can help you when you find yourself trapped in a 
place you’ve seen only on TV. In this section, we describe how 
to stay warm outdoors, using a lot of advice based on native 
methods. Figure 4-2 shows the native dress of Arctic Canada 
and a hypothetical cold-weather wilderness survivor. Note the 
following items of clothing:
 
✓ A hide jacket trapping a layer of air against the skin 
(Figure 4-2a)
 
✓ Fur used to block wind from the face (Figure 4-2b)
 
✓ Heavy mittens (Figure 4-2c)
 
✓ High boots for deep snow (Figure 4-2d)
 
✓ Cloth used to wrap the head and neck (Figure 4-2e)
 
✓ Improvised snow goggles (Figure 4-2f)
 
✓ A heavy jacket trapping a layer of warm air next to the 
body (Figure 4-2g)
 
✓ Mittens improvised from heavy socks (Figure 4-2h)
 
✓ Improvised gaiters/boot covers (Figure 4-2i)
 
✓ Fabric sewn to a coat to provide a sitting surface 
(Figure 4-2j)
 
✓ Improvised snow shoes (Figure 4-2k)

Figure 4-2: Native Arctic clothing (left) and a cold-weather survivor in 
improvised clothing (right).
See Chapter 16 for info on how to make all the improvised 
clothing: goggles, mittens, gaiters, and snowshoes. The 
techniques we describe in this section do require a few basic 
tools. You can’t do much without a knife and some kind of 
needle and thread (you should have these supplies in your 
survival kit, which we describe in detail in Chapter 2). You 
can improvise cutting tools and even needle and thread, but 
everything is easier if you just always have your survival kit 
on hand.
Extreme sewing: Using needle 
and thread to save your life
Improvising clothing requires you to join together pieces of 
fabric or other flexible material. The best way to do so is with 
needle and thread. Knowing how to use both is a great outdoor 
skill that can keep you alive. If you don’t have a needle in your 
supply kit, you can improvise one from a piece of plastic, a 
splinter of bone or antler, or any one of many other materials 
(to see how, head to Chapter 14).

Part I: Stayin’ Alive: Basic Wilderness Survival Principles 
54
After you have a needle, you can improvise cordage (thread) 
from any number of materials; shoelaces or laces pulled from 
a hood, wiring ripped from the wreckage of a machine, and 
dental floss are all acceptable, though they make different 
sizes of holes in the fabric you’re sewing. Natural cordage for 
sewing includes sinew (the tough, stringy tissues stripped 
from animal joints) and tough vegetable fibers.
 
To thread your needle, slip the cordage you’re using through 
the eye and pull through a good measure; put a knot in the 
thread at the beginning of where you’ll make your seam to 
prevent the thread from pulling through the fabric (refer to 
Figure 4-3a). Join the two fabrics (Figure 4-3b) and end the 
seam with a final knot to prevent the seam from coming apart.

Using plastic, cardboard, and 
other materials for warmth
If you need to improvise and make your own cold-weather 
clothing, you can look to different materials, such as plastic, 
cardboard, and so on. These materials are durable and can 
make weatherproof layers for keeping warm. When you’re 
considering improvising cold-weather clothing, keep in mind 
the layering principles we outline in the section “Relying on 
Layering for Warmth,” earlier in this chapter.
If you find yourself in a cold setting and need to improvise 
with materials around you, look at the following items:

 Chapter 4: Survival Style: Keeping Warm or Cool 55
 
✓ Car seat covers: They’re often made of a flexible plastic, 
and you can easily cut them away and sew them into an 
improvised shell layer to protect you from wind, rain, 
and snow. Use the padding inside these seats as insulation 
(the thermal layer) by stuffing it inside your outer layer.
 
✓ Plastic sheet, tarp, or garbage bag: You can easily 
convert one of these plastic items into a poncho simply 
by cutting a foot-wide slit along a fold, near the center, 
for your head to pass through.
 
✓ Cardboard: You can sew cardboard together to make 
large sheets for use as a poncho, though it breaks down 
in rain after a while.
 
✓ Extra sleeping bag: You can modify a sleeping bag into 
a heavy insulation layer, but only do this if you have a 
spare. A sleeping bag is more useful in keeping you alive 
overnight, when the temperature really plummets; during 
the day, you can stay active to keep warm.
 
✓ Duct tape: Duct tape is one of the wonders of modern 
civilization, and it’s useful in a hundred wilderness 
survival scenarios. You can use it to patch holes in your 
clothing, tape over a cloth hat to make it waterproof, 
and even tape over sneakers to help keep out rain. Keep 
some in your survival kit. You can wrap a few yards of it 
around a cigarette lighter for easy access later.
 
✓ Dry grass, leaves, moss: You can stuff dry grass, leaves, 
and moss into your clothes, or better, between your 
layers to make that all important space of dead air that 
insulates you.
 
✓ Newspapers or magazines: You can crumple up pages 
of newspapers or magazines and stuff them inside your 
outer layer. The crumpling helps trap a layer of air inside 
the paper, which acts as a very good insulator inside 
your clothing. Whenever you drive into extreme cold or 
snowstorms, you can keep an ample supply of newspapers 
or magazines in the trunk of your vehicle.
Putting together animal skins
If your survival situation has you trapping small animals, such 
as squirrels, you can use their skins to help you keep warm 
(Chapter 8 explains trapping). You need multiple skins to sew 
together to create a garment, though a hat may take just a few.

Part I: Stayin’ Alive: Basic Wilderness Survival Principles 
56
You need to process and preserve the skin before you use it. 
To preserve an animal skin so you can use it to create a piece 
of clothing, follow these steps:
 
1. Scrape off the loose, fatty tissues from the inside (the 
non-fur side) of the skin.
 
 If you don’t, these tissues will rot and degrade the 
hide. You can de-fat the skin of any mammal with any 
sharp instrument, such as a knife blade or a broad 
scrap of plastic. Soaking a hide in water for a day can 
make de-fatting easier, as can using wooden pegs to 
stretch the hide flat on the ground.
 
 Hold the scraper blade across the skin and scrape 
(don’t slice) off the fatty tissues by drawing the 
scraper toward you; the motion is like shaving your 
cheek or leg with a razor. This is a messy job, and the 
fat adheres to the blade; clean it off every few strokes.
 
2. When you have enough animal skins prepared, let 
them dry out; then begin to sew them together.
 
 Just let one overlap the other a bit and start sewing 
to join the overlapping margins. Soon you’ll have a 
towel-sized skin that you can use as a hat or a light 
cloak. Be creative and make whatever garment you 
need.
 
 If you wear the fur on the inside of the garment (next 
to your skin), you get a warmer garment because the 
fur next to your body traps a layer of air.
Processed skins stiffen over time. Keep them pliable by 
bending and wringing them with your hands every day.
 
Process and store your animal skins away from camp when 
you’re not wearing them, because their odors may attract 
bears or mountain lions.
Having the right headwear, 
handwear, and footwear
When you’re in a cold setting and not wearing clothing that 
adequately keeps you warm, you at least want to keep your 
head, hands, and feet warm. Keeping these body parts warm 
is particularly important, because

 Chapter 4: Survival Style: Keeping Warm or Cool 57
 
✓ So much heat is lost from the head.
 
✓ If your feet freeze, you can’t travel.
 
✓ If your hands freeze, you can’t even make a fire or set up 
a camp.
Also take care to keep your wrists and neck insulated; in both 
places, the skin is particularly thin, and you can lose heat 
from these regions very quickly. You can use duct tape (or 
any kind of tape) to tighten your cuffs if they don’t already 
have Velcro tabs for adjustment.
Keep the following in mind about these important body parts:
 
✓ Your head: The first thing to do when you feel cold is get 
a hat on. The scalp contains so little fat that you lose a 
great deal of heat though the head. Slowing or stopping 
that heat loss can keep your whole body warm.
 
✓ Your hands: Mittens are usually warmer than gloves, and 
they’re easy to improvise from a pair of socks. Mittens 
trap a larger layer of air around your hands than gloves 
do because gloves wrap only around individual fingers.
 
✓ Your feet: To keep your feet warm, you can take several 
steps:
 
• Loosen the laces on your boots or shoes. Don’t 
loosen so much that they fall off, but make them 
loose enough that your blood (which warms your 
skin) can circulate.
 
• Add layers to the inside of your footwear. This can 
be as easy as slipping on another layer of socks, 
being sure to keep your laces somewhat loose. If 
you don’t have the luxury of extra socks, improvise 
them by making a simple tube of cloth sewn down 
the side and across the toe-end. This doesn’t have 
to be particularly comfortable; it just has to help 
trap warm air inside your shoe or boot.
 
• Insulate the outside of your footwear. The padding 
from seat cushions can be useful as insulation that 
you layer on the outside of your footwear. Cut the 
padding into slabs and sew them together, paying 
particular attention to the toe area. You can also 
make snowshoes from cordage and flexible, green 
branches.

Using Other Ways 
to Keep Warm
In addition to wearing layers of dry, air-trapping clothing, 
you can keep warm by staying active, covering yourself with 
blankets or other insulation, and using fire. We cover fire later 
in this chapter and discuss shelters in Chapter 6. For now, 
here are some good ways to keep warm.
Staying active
One way to stay warm is to keep moving, which generates 
body heat. On really cold mornings, you may want to do some 
jumping jacks, run in place, or windmill your arms (which 
drives blood back into your fingertips).
However, being active does have its drawbacks. When you’re 
active, you sweat, which can soak your clothes — and then 
they can freeze solid. (Check out the earlier section “Avoiding 
a cold sweat” for more on the dangers of sweating.)
 
During a hard day in the Arctic winter, we constantly adjust 
our clothing systems to prevent them from being sweated up 
and freezing solid. If you’re going to do some vigorous exercise, 
remember to strip off a layer before you start, but put it back 
on soon after you stop moving. The other problem with staying 
active is that it burns calories. If your food supply is an issue, 
weigh the pros and cons of having to consume more food to stay 
active. In the extreme cold, recovering from hypothermia is very 
difficult, so err on the side of eating more rather than less.
Staying warm when 
you’re staying still
A cold night can turn into an eternal agony; it seems that the 
sun will never come up. But remember, it will. To help you 
keep warm, you can try the following options:
 
✓ Insulation from cold surfaces: Never sit or lie directly on 
the ground. Always use some kind of padding to insulate 

 Chapter 4: Survival Style: Keeping Warm or Cool 59
you from cold surfaces; for example, you can gather pine 
boughs to make a soft, thick insulating pad that you can 
sleep on.
 
✓ Hot rocks: If you’ve had a fire, you can pull warm rocks 
from near the fire to slip inside your clothes. Be careful 
that they’re not hot enough to burn you, though.
 
✓ Huddling with your companions: If you have companions, 
huddling with them allows you to conserve the group’s 
body heat by having it all under one cover. Use any type 
of cover you have as a blanket to stay warm (you should 
definitely have at least one space blanket in your survival 
kit; see Chapter 2).
 
✓ Candles: If you have a candle, hunch over it to keep your 
hands warm and to allow you to inhale warm, dry air.
Cool Threads: Clothing 
for Staying Cool
We think the best guides to surviving in a hot wilderness are 
the native people of such areas, and in this case, we look to 
the nomadic Bedouin folk originally of the Arabian Peninsula. 
Figure 4-4 shows a Bedouin in native dress, and shows a 
desert wilderness survivor in improvised clothing. Note the 
following items of clothing:
 
✓ A long cloth used to completely protect the head and 
neck from the sun (Figure 4-4a)
 
✓ Long, flowing, robe-like clothes that let air circulate next 
to the skin but shield the skin from direct sun (Figure 4-4b)
 
✓ Lack of shoes (Figure 4-4c)
 
 Going barefoot is an aboriginal custom you shouldn’t 
emulate. Bedouin folk go shoeless from childhood, and 
their feet are very tough. Your feet aren’t accustomed to 
going barefoot, so make sure you wear shoes.
 
✓ Survivor’s t-shirt head-garment that completely protects 
the neck and head (also note use of sunglasses and face 
mask) (Figure 4-4d)
 
✓ An untucked shirt to let air circulate (Figure 4-4e)

✓ Hand-protecting flaps of cloth sewn to cuffs (Figure 4-4f)
 
✓ Improvised sandals (Figure 4-4g)

Figure 4-4: Shows a Bedouin in native dress(left) and a desert wilderness 
survivor in improvised clothing (right).
One of the principles of dry hot-weather clothing is shielding 
from the sun. Although on vacation you may want to get a tan 
by wearing a t-shirt and shorts outdoors, doing this day after 
day, all day, can be fatal in a wilderness situation. Instead, 
you need to wear loose, flowing robe-like clothing as well as a 
substantial head covering to protect yourself from the sun.
This section takes a closer look at the specific types of clothing 
you can wear and names a couple of important principles to 
remember about clothing in a hot setting.
Wearing a hat and eye protection
Exposed to direct sunlight for too long, your scalp absorbs 
too much heat, leading to hyperthermia. Simply wearing a hat 
can greatly improve your chances of survival. Try to wear a 
loose-fitting hat with a wide brim that shields the entire head.
A hat also cuts down glare, which you can also reduce with 
soot under your eyes or with sunglasses. If you don’t have 

 Chapter 4: Survival Style: Keeping Warm or Cool 61
sunglasses, you can improvise them from a strip of stiff cloth, 
a piece of bark, or plastic. You can protect your face from the 
sun simply by hanging a handkerchief below the eyes: Pin or 
sew it to your headgear. Check out Chapter 17 for ways you 
can improvise your own eye protection and headgear to keep 
cool.
Considering other clothing 
concepts to keep cool
As you try to come up with clothing in a hot setting, keep the 
following pointers in mind. These concepts can help keep you 
cool:
 
✓ Select light colors. If you have the luxury of choosing 
what color material to wear in the direct sun, wear white 
or other light colors; they reflect the sun instead of 
absorbing its rays as darker colors do.
 
✓ Wear loose-fitting clothing. Hot-weather clothing should 
be loose and flowing rather than tight. Loose clothing 
allows a little ventilation to keep your skin cool, but tight 
clothing makes you sweat, leading to dehydration. Note 
the Bedouin’s loose, flowing robes in Figure 4-4.
 
✓ Be prepared to add or subtract layers. As in cold 
environments, adjust your clothing according to the 
conditions. At night, be prepared to bundle up, because 
hot areas can get very cold, particularly on cloudless 
nights when there’s no cloud layer to trap the Earth’s 
warmth.
 
✓ Cover your skin. Improvise a robe-like garment from a 
blanket or sheet to protect you from the sun.
 
✓ Use ventilation. Keep ventilated by unbuttoning your 
cuffs and shirt neck. Wear your trousers loose, or 
better yet, roll them up to your knees and wear your 
improvised robe over them.
 
✓ Drape yourself with damp cloth. Wet skin cools much 
faster than dry skin, and if you have the luxury of excess 
water, you can keep cool by draping damp fabric over 
your body while resting in shade. As the water evaporates, 
it carries excess heat away from the skin.

Part I: Stayin’ Alive: Basic Wilderness Survival Principles 
62
A Cool Proposition: Working at 
Night, Resting During the Day
 
If it’s really hot and you’re trying to walk your way out of the 
survival situation, you would do best to travel at night, when 
it’s cooler (deserts may be very cold indeed, but it’s easier to 
keep warm by moving than to keep cool when it’s very hot). 
Sleep in the day, under shelter if you can, and travel and/or do 
your work of finding water, food, and keeping your temperature 
regulated at night. We tell you how to work and travel at night 
in Chapter 17.

Chapter 5
Making Fire in the 
Wilderness
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding what makes fire burn
▶ Building a wilderness fire
▶ Starting fires in the rain
▶ Using alternative methods to get a fire started
You don’t just start a fire — you build one! With that in 
mind, remember that most people have trouble getting 
their fires started in the wilderness because they hurry the 
building process and use a haphazard selection of starter 
materials. So try to think of your fire as being like a well-designed 
structure — if you build it right, you’ll be rewarded.
In this chapter, we show you how you go about constructing 
a fire. We also show you some interesting alternatives to 
matches and lighters, as well as some advice for the toughest 
task of all: starting a fire in the rain.
Making a Fire
If you find yourself in a wilderness survival situation, being 
able to build a fire to stay warm may be question of life or 
death. Always keep in mind that every fire needs three things: 
heat to ignite it, oxygen to breathe, and fuel to burn.
This section explains what you need to do to get a fire going, 
including different fire-building options, depending on your 
situation. The most important thing to keep in mind is that 

Part I: Stayin’ Alive: Basic Wilderness Survival Principles 
64
getting the fire going — from igniting it until it becomes self-
sustaining — is a critical time for you in a survival situation.
Looking at fire-building materials
To get a fire going, you need the right materials. All wilderness 
fires require three distinctly different kinds:
 
✓ Tinder: This is the first material to be ignited, so it must 
be the most flammable. Make sure you have plenty of it 
before you strike your first match. Good tinder includes 
straw, grass, scraped fibers or husks from trees or dried 
fruit, lint from your clothing, dry shavings from a stick, 
dry pine needles or leaves, a ball of dry toilet paper or 
newspaper (although when paper is damp, it’s worse 
than useless), and even sap from pine trees, which burns 
hot and bright. Be sure to collect tinder if you see it when 
traveling.
 
✓ Kindling: Kindling is the first real fuel to burn, and it’s 
composed of thin twigs (pencil-thick at most) and/or 
splinters of wood split with an ax or knife.
 
✓ Fuel: This is the main fuel for the fire, usually composed 
of wrist-thick or larger branches and even logs if you’re 
really lucky. You can also burn dried animal dung, as well 
as natural tar or oil that seeps from the ground.
Whatever kinds of tinder, kindling, and fuel you use, you light 
the tinder first, which ignites the kindling, which ignites the 
fuel. Figure 5-1 shows the process, which we discuss in more 
detail in this section — after looking at how to light a fire in 
the first place.
Understanding fire-making basics
Before you start trying to create flames or sparks, arrange 
your tinder and fuel and have it ready to go. One of the main 
reasons many people have such a hard time is poor selection 
of starter fuels. The following tips can help you build a good 
fire:
 
✓ Watch out for Mother Nature. Make sure your fire-
building site is protected from heavy winds and rain that 
can extinguish it or make starting it difficult.

 Chapter 5: Making Fire in the Wilderness 65

c
Figure 5-1: Essentials to making a teepee fire: Tinder (a), a teepee of kin-
dling (b), and fuel added to the teepee (c).
 
✓ Take time to build your fire. Don’t be impatient. 
Generally speaking, the easiest type of fire to ignite is 
the teepee (check out the next section). Take your time 
making a beautiful teepee. Carefully construct your fire 
to take full advantage of the fact that fire always burns 
upward: Put the lightest, driest tinder at the very bottom — 
wispy-fine fibers are the best — and then build your way 
up with kindling (twigs) that gradually gets thicker.
 
✓ Use the driest wood you can find. Wood is dry when it 
snaps cleanly in your hands. You should actually hear 
a very dry snap! when you break it. This type of wood 
ignites quickly and burns well. Green wood, which is 
wood that still has a little moisture in it, is hard to ignite. 
If you have to work a stick or twig in your hands to get 
it to break — or if it holds together by a fiber when you 
bend it — then it isn’t dry enough.
 
✓ Use the thinnest possible kindling. Twigs less than 
1⁄8 
inch (3 millimeters) in thickness (thinner than your 
shoelaces) make the best kindling. When you build a 
teepee fire, make sure you have very dry tinder at the 
bottom and then a nice structure of these dry twigs 
above it.
 
 Have an extra pile of very dry kindling next to you to feed 
the flame as it arises, because a fire is very precarious 
when it first starts. You want to make sure you can feed 
it at just the right speed to really get it going.

Part I: Stayin’ Alive: Basic Wilderness Survival Principles 
66
 
✓ Ignite your fire at the lowest spot you can. Fire always 
burns upward, so the lower you ignite it, the better.
 
✓ Blow gently on your fire or fan it. Fire needs oxygen, 
and the best way to convert a tiny flame into a large 
one is to give it some air. This is one of the arts of fire 
making. Put your lips as close to your burgeoning fire as 
you safely can and blow gently. Doing so can get the fire 
going more than practically anything else.
 
 Be careful not to blow too hard, because doing so can 
actually prevent the fire from growing or put it out. A 
long, gentle stream of air is best.
 
✓ Feed your fire. As soon as your fire ignites, feed the 
flame quickly and steadily, but don’t overdo it; you can 
smother a burgeoning fire very easily. Keep in mind that 
fires ignite and burn unevenly. Flames may crop up in 
places you don’t expect. A few twigs, placed well over a 
burgeoning flame, can get you going.
Considering your basic 
fire structure options
Different fire structures are useful for different purposes. 
Knowing the following types of fires can help you conserve 
your fuel, keep you warm at night, ensure that you have 
embers ready to relight the fire in the morning, dry out wet 
fuel, and signal for help. Here are some structures to choose 
from:
 
✓ Teepee fire: The teepee fire (see Figure 5-2a) is good for 
a crisis because it starts almost every time.
 
✓ Star fire: When the fuel is really large and hard to break 
up (as with large logs), push it into a star or cross fire 
(Figure 5-2b) so that just the tip is burning at any given 
moment. You can extinguish this fire easily, because all 
you have to do is pull the star apart by the cold ends of 
the logs.
 
✓ Pyramid fire: A pyramid fire (Figure 5-2c) built with 
plenty of fuel collapses in on itself overnight, providing 
a good pile of embers to use to relight the fire in the 
morning.

 Chapter 5: Making Fire in the Wilderness 67

b
c
Figure 5-2: The different types of fires.
 
Whatever fire you make, pile up some dirt, rocks, or vegetation 
around it, like a screen, just before going to sleep to help 
reflect the heat into your shelter area on a cold night.
You should have a signal fire structure on standby at all 
times. For more on signal fires, see Chapter 12.
Striking matches correctly
Lighting a match seems straightforward — until your life 
depends on it. Then you take your time to think through just 
what you’re going to do. Particularly if you have a limited 
number of matches, you don’t have much room for error.
 
To strike a wooden match, follow these steps:
 
1. Turn your back to the wind, crouch near the tinder 
pile, and cradle the box securely in one hand, cup-
ping it against any breeze.
 
2. Hold the match in the other hand and stab down 
deliberately across the striker patch.
 
3. After the match is lit, give it a second (or three) to 
fully ignite the first quarter of the wood.
 
4. Carefully move the lit match toward the tinder 
(unless you’ve struck the match right next to the 
tinder, which is preferable if there’s a breeze or it’s 
drizzling).

Making fire in wet conditions
When things get wet, making fire is more difficult, but if 
you’re persistent, you may be able to get a fire going. First and 
Starting a fire with a dead lighter
Even after your lighter has run out of 
fuel, you can still get fire from it. The 
trick is to force the lighter’s spark 
into the very best tinder you find: Lint 
pulled from cotton socks or some 
other cotton garment is ideal. Here’s 
how to do it:
 1. Pull off enough lint to make a 
wad about half the size of golf 
ball.
 
 Make sure the lint is pulled apart 
as much as possible. Don’t com-
press the lint or roll it into a ball. 
When you’re finished, you should 
be able to see through the lint. 
This process is time consum-
ing — it may take you as long as 
an hour — but it really works.
 2. Roll a tissue or a small length of 
toilet paper into a cone.
 
 You can use any type of paper for 
this, but tissue is the best. When 
you have a cone, mount the lint 
ball just inside the very end of 
it — think of the shape of a snow 
cone. This paper apparatus is 
your fire-starter.
 3. Take a lighter and flick it into 
the wad of lint at the end of your 
paper cone.
 
 The sparks should fly into the 
wad and ignite it.
 4. If the lint hasn’t ignited after a 
dozen or so attempts, take the 
metal housing off the lighter and 
try again.
 
 If you have a pocket knife or 
some other straight edge, you 
can pry the housing off pretty 
easily. You may have to use your 
fingernail. Make sure you don’t 
accidentally dislocate the steel 
wheel or the flint. The wheel 
and flint shouldn’t be attached to 
the housing in any way, so they 
shouldn’t move when you’re 
taking the housing off. If they 
move during the process, stop 
what you’re doing and reexam-
ine. After the housing comes off, 
the lint should ignite on the first 
few tries.
The lint ignites very quickly, so you 
need to have everything perfectly 
prepared beforehand. Have your kin-
dling expertly prepared so it catches 
properly.

 Chapter 5: Making Fire in the Wilderness 69
foremost, look for dry tinder, kindling, and fuel in the following 
places:
 
✓ Under rock shelters and in caves
 
✓ Under or inside downed trees or logs (found lying on the 
ground)
 
✓ Under heavy snow pack (if temperatures are just under 
freezing, everything above the snow may be dripping 
with melt water, but deep under the cold snowpack may 
be colder, dry wood)
 
✓ In animal burrows, such as squirrel or marmot dens
Sometimes you can take sticks that are slightly wet and 
whittle away the soaked parts to produce somewhat dry 
kindling.
Also search your clothes and possessions, especially the 
inside of your wallet, for dry tinder. Sometimes papers or 
even paper money deep inside a wallet or pocketbook remain 
dry even though everything else around you is soaked. If you 
aren’t completely soaked through, you can try making a tinder 
pile using lint from your underclothes. Lint ignites almost 
every time. The problem is having enough. Making a lint ball 
large enough to start kindling can take as much as an hour.
In wet conditions, try to build your fire on top of something 
and under some kind of shelter. Before building the fire, look 
for a base — a board or a piece of metal is good, and cloth 
or plastic cloth can work in pinch. Or you can try building 
on rock; almost anything is preferable to the wet earth. Use 
anything you can for shelter, as long as it keeps the drops off 
your fire for a moment.
 
In wet conditions, consider trying to start your fire without 
the use of tinder. Many times, when it’s wet, tinder is harder 
to ignite than kindling — especially leaves or paper. If that’s 
the case, make a small teepee of twigs and try lighting the 
thin stems directly. The kindling must be exceedingly thin, 
though — the thinnest twigs you can find. A dense teepee 
made of wire-thin twigs can sometimes ignite when a tinder-fire 
won’t.

Trying Other Ways to Start Fire
You can start fire with many methods. In this section, we 
show you some of the best techniques you can use if you 
don’t have matches or a lighter.
Starting a fire with common, 
everyday items
You may be surprised at the wide array of everyday items 
that you can use to start a fire. Be sure to practice these at 
home before you go outdoors:
 
✓ Magnesium bar: A magnesium bar (also known as a 
metal match) is a block of magnesium inlaid with a strip 
of flint. This handy item can help you start a fire even 
when wet! For more on these, see Chapter 2.
 
✓ Magnifying glass or similar lens: You can use a magnifying 
glass to focus the sun’s rays onto tinder and ignite it. 
Doing so is easy, and it takes only seconds to figure out. 
If you don’t have a magnifying glass, you may be able to 
carefully remove lenses from binoculars or a rifle scope. 
Check out Figure 5-3.
Figure 5-3: Starting a fire with a magnifying lens.

 Chapter 5: Making Fire in the Wilderness 71
 
✓ Stone and steel: Steel produces a spark if struck against 
some kinds of stone (including flint and chert). Check 
the local creek bed for a variety of stones, and then try 
striking your knife against them. Anytime you’re trying to 
ignite a fire with the use of a spark from metal and stone, 
try to use the lightest tinder you can find. Lint pulled 
from clothing is ideal.
 
✓ Batteries and steel wool: Many alkaline batteries (includ-
ing car batteries and the common 9-volt rectangular bat-
teries used in transistor radios) have enough charge to 
start a bit of steel wool on fire. Make sure the steel wool 
is fine. If you’re using common soap pads, you have to 
pull them apart until they’re wispy-thin.
 
 Anytime you can connect the two poles of a battery with 
the steel wool, you have a chance of getting ignition. 
Here’s how:
 
• 9-volt: The best thing to do is wrap your steel wool 
in tinder or toilet paper and rub the 9-volt battery’s 
poles in the wool.
 
• Other batteries: When using any other type of 
battery, you must pull the steel wool apart and 
form a cord that can reach both poles.
 
 The steel wool ignites almost immediately, so have your 
tinder ready.
 
✓ Batteries and wire: If you’re lucky enough to have 
machinery nearby, such as a car or tractor, you can make 
a spark by attaching a wire to each terminal of a battery 
and then touching the tips of the wires. Doing so pro-
duces a serious spark that you can use to ignite tender.
 
 Be careful not to shock yourself if you’re using a car 
battery. Insulate yourself from the steel wool or wire by 
holding it with thick, dry cloth.
Igniting a fire, primitive style
Humans have made fire for hundreds of thousands of years, 
if not a million or more. Still, many aboriginal people prefer 
to keep a fire going after it’s lit rather than building a new one 
every night. You can discover a lot from them that can help you 
survive outdoors. This section explains the two easiest kinds of 
primitive fires most useful in wilderness survival situations.

Part I: Stayin’ Alive: Basic Wilderness Survival Principles 
72
 
When making a bow fire or any type of friction fire, you’re not 
trying to get a flame; you’re trying to get a coal. After you have 
a coal, you need to take it and wrap it carefully in the lightest, 
driest tinder you can find and then blow on it steadily until 
the tinder catches. It may take multiple tries to get a live coal 
into your tinder.
Plow fire
A plow fire is about as simple as it gets. To start a fire, you 
carve a channel, which is just a long notch, and then run a 
stick up and down the channel as though you’re plowing. 
Embers then begin to form and embers trickle down the 
channel, igniting the tinder. See Figure 5-4.
a
b
Figure 5-4: Building a fire with a plow fire.
Bow fire
A bow fire uses a curved piece of wood, strung with a cord of 
some kind, to spin a spindle that creates friction. This makes 
a coal that you can use to light tinder.
 
The most important part of making a bow fire is selecting 
good pieces of wood and cordage and then manufacturing 
good components. To make a bow fire, follow these steps 
(see Figure 5-5):
 
1. Use strong, green wood for your bow.

 Chapter 5: Making Fire in the Wilderness 73
 
2. Choose the straightest, most symmetrical length of 
wood you can find for your spindle.
 
 The spindle needs to spin very quickly, so it must be 
a perfect stick or one carved that way. Even small 
imperfections can slow the spinning process. An ideal 
spindle is around 8 to 9 inches (20 to 23 centimeters) 
long and a little thicker than a quarter. Both ends 
should be carved to a shallow taper (picture a used 
crayon — not blunt, but close) to allow for maximum 
spinning speed and friction.
 
3. String the bow with shoelaces.
 
 When stringing the bow, the string should be just taut 
enough to grip the spindle.
 
4. Carve a shallow notch into the handhold.
 
 The handhold is the small piece of wood you use to 
apply downward force on the spindle. The deeper the 
notch in the handhold, the more friction you have in 
the handhold, so you want it as shallow as possible.
 
 You can use leaves or pine needles inside the hand-
hold to dampen the friction. Don’t use water or oil 
because liquids only make the wood swell.
 
5. Carve a circular notch in a baseboard.
 
 The baseboard is a heavy piece of wood split in half.
 
6. Start spinning your spindle slowly, using your bow, 
and make sure you have a good groove going.
 
 At this stage, you’re just trying to make sure you have 
a good connection between the spindle and the notch 
in the baseboard. Try to keep the spindle perpendicu-
lar to the line, because that cuts down on the problem 
of having the spindle slip out of the string (which is 
the most frustrating part, we know).
 
7. After you have the connection you want, cut a V 
from the baseboard’s edge to the circular notch.
 
 Put your tinder directly below the V notch in the base-
board. This allows the coal that you make to fall onto 
the tinder under the baseboard.
 
8. Speed up your drilling only after you start to see 
white smoke smoldering from the baseboard.

Part I: Stayin’ Alive: Basic Wilderness Survival Principles 
74
 
 Embers build in the notch of the base block; they’re 
the beginnings of your fire.
This method is probably the most practical way to make a 
primitive friction fire. Practice making this type of fire at home 
before trying it in the wilderness — it can help a great deal.

Extinguishing a Fire
Before you leave camp, you must extinguish all fires. No 
exceptions. A forest fire can start in less than a minute. You 
know when a fire is extinguished when you can place naked 
hands on the dead coals.
 
To extinguish a fire, use water. If you don’t have liquid or are 
preserving your water supply, bury the fire with dirt built up 
to at least 1 foot in thickness. Don’t use grass or moss, regard-
less of how wet it is. Then place heavy stones on top of the 
dirt to make it more difficult for animals to dig up the dirt 
(animals can smell anything aromatic that has fallen into the 
fire, such as fat, oil, or food, from a great distance).

W
hen you’re in a wilderness setting, getting in from the 
elements can be a lifesaver. A shelter can keep you 
warm in cold environments, cool in hot conditions, and dry 
when it’s raining. Sometimes you can take shelter in natural 
formations, such as caves, but many times you need to build 
your own haven. That’s okay, though, because most survival 
shelters are easy to make.
In this chapter, we show you the simplest and most effective 
shelters you can find and make. In Part III, we cover shelters 
for specific conditions (snowdrift shelters, for example, or 
desert sunshades and jungle hammocks). For the moment, we 
look at the simplest ways to take shelter outdoors.

Part I: Stayin’ Alive: Basic Wilderness Survival Principles 
76
Grasping the Importance 
of Shelter
Shelter is important in survival situations for physical and 
psychological reasons. Physically, the human body is pretty 
frail. A few hours in the sun can burn you severely, and a cold 
night can incapacitate you. A good shelter
 
✓ Gets you out of the direct sun, which can prevent sunburn 
and stave off hyperthermia (such as heat stroke)
 
✓ Can be warmed, preventing hypothermia and frostbite
 
✓ Protects you from rain, keeping you warm
 
✓ Includes an insulating bed that keeps your body heat 
from being sucked into the cold earth
As for the psychological reasons, everything seems so much 
better when you can get in from the rain, wind, or storm. If 
you’re fully exposed, heavy weather wears you down, but from 
inside a shelter, the world and your chances look a lot better.
Taking the time to plan a camp and build a good shelter are 
proactive steps that remind you that you’re working toward 
survival, not just reacting to things that happen to you. We 
cover the full importance of the psychology of survival in 
Chapter 3.
To make a shelter in the wilderness, you can try to make do 
with natural shelters or build your own. Whenever you’re in 
a survival situation, keep a constant lookout for good natural 
shelters. If you’re pretty sure you’re going to be stranded out-
doors overnight, finding or making shelter is a top priority. The 
upcoming sections look at the main natural-shelter alternatives.
Before Making Camp: 
What to Do
Whether you’re going to use a natural shelter or build your 
own, you need to consider a few things before starting to 
make camp. In this section, we outline some important ideas 
to consider when using any outdoor shelter.

 Chapter 6: Home, Sweet Hut: Survival Shelters 77
Understanding priorities
When it becomes clear that you’re going to spend the night 
out, you should prioritize your actions in getting shelter in the 
following way:
 
1. Decide where you want to locate your shelter.
 
 See the next section for why the location is important.
 
2. Gather some tinder, kindling, and firewood and put 
them near where you intend to build your shelter.
 
 You don’t want to search for these supplies at night. If 
you can, cover them to keep them dry (even if it isn’t 
raining now, it could be in ten minutes!). See Chapter 5 
for more on fire-making.
 
3. Build (or find) your shelter.
 
 Whatever shelter you use, you should never rest or 
sleep directly on the ground, because it’s always 
colder than body temperature and it sucks heat from 
your body. Insulate yourself from the ground with a 
layer of vegetation, such as pine boughs, or use extra 
clothing.
 
4. Clearly mark your location so you can be seen from 
the air.
 
 Use the methods we describe in Chapter 12.
 
5. Settle in for the night.
 
 Quality sleep is important to keep up your strength 
and morale, but psychological factors may make it 
hard to sleep in a survival situation. See Chapter 3 for 
ways to proactively cope with stress.
Selecting a good campsite
If you’re going to build or find shelter, you need to choose an 
appropriate campsite. Take some time to select a campsite; 
a good location can protect you from wind, rain, and other 
elements. Before you start building or searching, consider the 
following:
 
✓ When you’re near water, look for higher ground to 
make your camp. Cold air flows downhill, so riverbeds 

Part I: Stayin’ Alive: Basic Wilderness Survival Principles 
78
and lakesides are colder than slopes that lead down to 
them, particularly in the early morning.
 
 Beware of flash floods, sudden bursts of water that can turn 
a dry riverbed into a raging torrent. Look for high-water 
marks, such as water stains on rock faces or vegetation 
trapped by running water in trees or bushes. Be sure your 
camp is considerably higher than the usual high-water 
mark. For more on the dangers of flash floods, and how to 
spot high-water marks, see Chapter 17.
 
✓ When on the spines of exposed ridges, beware of 
lightning hazards. Although you may want to build 
your rescue signals on a ridge, actually camping on such 
exposed ground is a lightning risk.
 
✓ When you’re in the mountains, watch out for the 
telltale signs of avalanche or rockfall. Either of these 
can wipe out your camp in an instant. An example of an 
avalanche area is a treeless swath on a mountainside. An 
example of a rockfall area is a cone-shaped talus slope 
at the bases of mountains (talus is loose, rocky debris 
that piles up at the bases of cliffs and mountains). See 
Chapter 16 for more on avalanche hazards.
 
✓ Keep aware of high-wind hazards. Check trees to see 
whether they’re all leaning the same way or are missing 
limbs on the same side; these signs can indicate the 
prevailing wind direction. Set up your shelter in a protected 
area if you can, because incessant wind really can wear 
you down psychologically. If you have the misfortune to 
be camped on sea ice (a skin of ice on the surface of the 
ocean), keep in mind that wind can move sea ice. Look 
for older, stable ice that has wind-rounded corners and 
snow on it rather than newer ice that has sharp corners 
and is free of snow.
 
 Remember that on frozen ocean surfaces (and even some 
large frozen lakes), pressure ridges occur where two 
large pieces of ice crash together (caused by wind or 
sea currents). They can be up to 30 feet (9 meters) tall; 
camping in their lee (the side protected from wind) can 
provide excellent shelter from high winds.

 Chapter 6: Home, Sweet Hut: Survival Shelters 79
Using Natural Shelters
Natural shelters come in all shapes, sizes, and kinds, but they 
really boil down to two types: trees and caves/rock overhangs. 
This section looks at these two shelters and discusses which 
critters to watch out for before you move in.
Trees
In a survival situation, you can turn to trees for shelter. You 
can use trees that have been hollowed out by fire or downed 
for some other reason and rotted from the inside-out. Put 
down some vegetation, such as leaves or pine boughs, on the 
floor of the shelter to keep your body off the cold ground. 
Figure 6-1 shows two examples of tree shelters.
Figure 6-1: Taking shelter in a hollow tree (left) or log (right).
Old logs are often as populated as apartment buildings, 
crawling with ants, termites, spiders, millipedes, and a 
multitude of other wonderful bugs. If you’re desperate for 
shelter, you can try to evict these inhabitants by building a 
fire next to the tree and fanning dense smoke (produced by 
throwing live branches on the fire) onto the log. Note: This is 
a lot of work that may or may not pay off.

Part I: Stayin’ Alive: Basic Wilderness Survival Principles 
80
Caves and rock overhangs
A cave or rock overhang is an ideal shelter for a person lost 
in a wilderness. With caves — actual cavities in rock faces — 
smaller is normally better because small caves are easy to 
heat up with a good campfire. You won’t be looking to warm 
rock overhangs — simple rock shelves that may offer some 
protection from rain or sun — so they can be large or small. 
Cave or rock overhangs can exist anywhere you see rock, so 
keep an eye out for them and look carefully. Figure 6-2 shows 
an example of using a cave entrance for shelter.
Figure 6-2: A cave can be a great shelter.
 
If the cave is very deep and you can’t find the back, resist the 
urge to explore by making a torch or using a flashlight. Stay 
in the first few feet of the shelter, just deep in enough to keep 
out of the elements. Your objective is simply to survive. You 
can easily get lost, take fatal falls, or even get trapped by flash 
floods in a dark cave.
Check for current residents
 
Although natural shelters can be ideal, you need to make sure 
no one else calls yours home. For example, does a bear live 
there? Bears den in caves throughout North America from late 
September through late May. You can spot some clues near 

 Chapter 6: Home, Sweet Hut: Survival Shelters 81
the cave entrance to find out whether the place is vacant; 
caves occupied by larger mammals often display the following 
telltales:
 
✓ A faint trail leading into the entrance. (Look at the paw 
prints in the trail — are they squirrel-sized, dog-sized, or 
person-sized? Larger prints may indicate a bear.)
 
✓ Food debris, such as bones, shells, and bits of vegetation, 
scattered at the entrance.
 
✓ Feces (scat) present at the entrance or just off to the 
sides of the entrance.
 
✓ Animal hair hanging on vegetation near the entrance.
 
✓ A distinctive odor, much like a wet dog.
Depending on the environment, snakes, spiders, scorpions, 
bats, birds, and a dozen other kinds of critters may well live in 
the shelter, too, so you should check any natural shelter out 
carefully before moving in.
 
If you suspect a bear lives in the shelter, back away slowly 
and then get the heck out of there. It’s tough to say how far 
you should go to stay safe in this situation, but you may want 
to travel several hours to get out of the bear’s territory — 
even that may not be enough. If it’s a mama bear inside with 
her cubs, you sure don’t want to challenge her for the shelter.
In other cases, do the following to determine whether any-
thing lives in a tree:
 
✓ Use a long and sturdy stick to knock on the shelter. 
Be ready for a raccoon, bird, or some other animal to 
explode out of the entrance.
 
✓ Creep closer and look closely. Don’t assume there’s 
nobody home, because some animals freeze rather than 
run when frightened.
 
✓ Carefully explore the inside of the tree shelter with the 
end of the stick. Use the stick like a poker.
 
A good fire may deter animals from coming back to the shelter 
at night. Build the fire right at the entrance to the cave or rock 
overhang. Take care to shield the fire from strong winds near 
the entrance and be sure to place your fire so it can’t be 
extinguished by rain.

Putting a Roof over Your Head: 
Building Simple Shelters
If you’re going to be out even just one night, building a shelter 
is well worth it. Doing so is easier than it sounds. You can 
build a simple and effective shelter within an hour with just 
a few materials — either found in the wild or carried in your 
survival kit. In your kit, you should have the following three 
shelter-building tools:
 
✓ Knife (or other cutting and chopping implement): See 
Chapter 14 for how to improvise knives and chopping 
tools from stone.
 
✓ Tarp: A tarp can help waterproof the shelter. A large 
plastic bag or three may work in a pinch.
 
✓ Cordage: You can use cordage (rope, shoelaces, wire, 
strips of cloth, whatever you have) to lash wooden parts 
of a shelter together; parachute cord is ideal. If you’re 
running low, you can cut open parachute cord to get at 
multiple strands inside it, giving you three or five times 
as much cordage as you think you have.
By making a temporary home, you can really improve your 
situation. This section shows a few simple shelters to make.
Making a tarp shelter
A simple plastic tarp is invaluable outdoors. It’s probably 
most useful for making a shelter that can keep you out of the 
rain, sun, and wind. If you can make a fire near the entrance 
and block the rear entrance with brush or a backpack, you 
have a shelter that can keep you alive indefinitely.
 
If you build a fire in your shelter, always be careful not to light 
your shelter on fire. Keeping a pile of sand or dirt (or, if you 
can afford it, a jug of water) next to the fire can help you put 
out a fire before it spreads.
The basic type of tarp shelter uses a line tied between two 
trees as the peak of the tarp. All you need are a couple trees 

 Chapter 6: Home, Sweet Hut: Survival Shelters 83
about 10 to 20 feet (3 to 6 meters) apart, a length of cordage, 
your tarp, and a few stakes that you can use to anchor down 
the corners, as in Figure 6-3a.
a
b
Figure 6-3: Two types of tarp shelters.
To create this tarp shelter, follow these steps:
 
1. Tie the length of cordage between two trees.
 
 The tighter you tie it, the better. You want the roof to 
be straight, not bowing down.
 
2. Drape the tarp over the cordage, making the peak of 
the roof.
 
3. Use stakes to secure the corners of the tarp by 
hammering them into the ground.
 
 Stakes should be green wood cut from living trees, 
not the more brittle wood you find lying on the forest 
floor. If your tarp has grommets (metal-reinforced 
holes) on the corners, put the stakes through them to 
prevent the tarp from tearing under pressure.
If you’re in a hurry or are weak and need to rest, you can 
make an alternative tarp shelter, as in Figure 6-3b. This 
shelter uses a ridge pole and is simpler to set up, but it’s a 
little cramped, so after the storm passes or you’re more fully 
rested, you may later decide to use cordage to make a roomier, 
more permanent shelter.
 
Whichever type of tarp shelter you fashion, use some foliage 
(such as pine boughs) to insulate the ground so you don’t rest 
directly on the earth.

Part I: Stayin’ Alive: Basic Wilderness Survival Principles 
84
Building a downed-tree or 
other A-frame shelter
Downed-tree or A-frame shelters can provide a little more 
protection from the elements than a simple tarp shelter if the 
downed tree (or A-frame materials) has a lot of vegetation 
still on it. Like the tarp shelter, you can supplement these 
shelters with a tarp for waterproofing. They should always 
be equipped with an insulated sleeping/sitting area and a fire 
with a fire reflector. Figure 6-4 shows examples of these types 
of shelters.
a
b
Figure 6-4: A downed-tree shelter and an A-frame shelter.
Both shelters use a ridgepole (a pole at the peak of the shelter) 
flanked by walls. In the case of the downed-tree shelter 
(Figure 6-4a), the ridgepole is simply a tree trunk that’s fallen 
(you can fell it yourself if you have an ax). Crawl under the 
tree and cut out tree limbs that hang down to the ground, 
making a hollow under the ridgepole; you may also want to 
cut off branches that stick up above the ridgepole to prevent 
them from catching wind and shaking the shelter.
Here’s how to build the A-frame shelter:
 
1. Gather wood to make the frame.

 Chapter 6: Home, Sweet Hut: Survival Shelters 85
 
 In the A-frame (Figure 6-4b), the ridgepole is a sturdy 
sapling supported by about six uprights; all of these 
should be green wood, not dead wood from the forest 
floor.
 
2. Build the frame as in Figure 6-4b.
 
 Lash the uprights to the ridgepole at an angle of 45 
degrees or more.
 
3. Pile branches with vegetation against the ridgepole, 
at the angle of the uprights, to make the walls.
In either case, a tarp draped over the ridgepole (and tied 
down or staked down, as seen in Figure 6-3) can help waterproof 
the shelter. Build an insulation bed under the shelter and a 
fire with a fire-reflecting screen of sticks, placed vertically in 
the ground, to reflect the fire’s heat back into the shelter area.
Constructing an insulated shelter
You can make a very simple, very warm shelter by doing the 
following:
 
1. Next to a log or long rock, make a 2-foot-thick 
(0.6-meter) bed of leaves, grass, moss, pine needles, 
any other dry vegetation, clothing, or other items 
that can insulate you from the ground.
 
2. Lean four or five 5-foot-long (1.5-meter) branches 
against the log or rock, forming a sloping roof over 
the bedding.
 
 This is the frame for your shelter. Don’t make it too 
big. You want this shelter to be tight-fitting so it 
insulates you almost like a sleeping bag.
 
3. Pile a 3-foot-thick (0.9-meter) insulating layer of leaves, 
grass, moss, pine needles, any other dry vegetation, 
clothing, or other items on top of the roof.
 
 If you have a waterproof tarp, you can tie it to the roof 
to help you stay dry.
 
4. Mark the outside of the shelter so it can be clearly 
seen and then squirm inside, sealing the opening with 
a backpack or more vegetation; then try to sleep.
 
 Remember, you can improve your morale with just a 
few hours of good sleep.

Keeping Your Shelter Clean
Remember the old adage: Cleanliness is next to godliness. The 
same goes for your shelter and campsite. A clean, organized 
campsite is important because
 
✓ It’s less likely to attract bears, wolverines, or other 
potentially dangerous animals. To keep camp clean, 
designate a butchery and food preparation area 20 or 
more paces away from your actual shelter (though still 
within sight).
 
✓ It allows you to find what you need when you need 
it. When you hear a helicopter flying overhead, you’re 
ready to light your signal fires, find your signaling mirror, 
or turn on your radio or any other electronic device. To 
stay organized, we suggest hanging signaling gear from 
lines or branches so you can easily access it when the 
chopper flies overhead.
A clean and organized camp also gives you some peace of 
mind. You’re not just eking out a filthy, savage existence; 
you’re doing okay. You know what you’re doing, you’re 
taking steps toward staying healthy and being found — 
you’re surviving!

egardless of the wilderness setting you find yourself in, 
finding and storing water is your second priority after 
you do all you can to protect your body temperature. If you 
have the problems of hypothermia or heat exhaustion under 
control, then go to work on collecting and conserving as much 
water as you can.
In this chapter, we show you the average time it takes for 
dehydration to incapacitate you in the wilderness — and how 
to extend that time. We show you how to find water, how to 
extract it from various sources, and finally how to filter and 
purify unclean liquids so you can consume them.
Knowing Your Water Needs
You can estimate how much water you need in any situation 
by starting with the averages. Under average, moderate condi-
tions, you lose from 2 to 3 quarts (2 to 3 liters) of body water 
per day. If you don’t replenish this lost water, you begin to 
feel the effects of dehydration.

Part I: Stayin’ Alive: Basic Wilderness Survival Principles 
88
Dehydration usually starts with a drop in your energy level, 
which is quickly followed by headache, mental confusion, dry 
mouth, quivering muscles, and then extreme fatigue. If the 
average human loses water at the average rate and doesn’t 
replace any of it, he or she loses consciousness after three 
days and perishes after five.
Now that you know the averages, you need to know the 
extremes:
 
✓ If you’re in temperate conditions and you stay in bed 
all day, you lose only about 1 quart (1 liter) of water 
per day.
 
✓ If you’re involved in normal activities in a hot climate, 
you lose about 1 gallon (4 liters).
 
✓ If you walk across a desert at midday, you can lose over 
5 gallons (more than 20 liters) in one day, which, if not 
replaced, is fatal.
For more on the special problems of hot climates, see 
Chapter 17.
 
You can measure your personal dehydration rate by examin-
ing your urine. If your urine is clear and straw-colored, you’re 
basically hydrated, but if it becomes yellow or orange, or 
cloudy or “thick,” or if you don’t urinate at all over a 10-hour 
period, then you’re dehydrated.
Your first strategy in a survival situation is to conserve your 
body’s water usage. If you’re thorough in the conservation 
practices, you can stretch your water — and your survival 
time — significantly.
Stretching your water supply
Your body uses water all the time, even when you’re at rest. 
It leaks out in three ways: urination, perspiration, and respi-
ration (breathing). Though you can’t stop the water-leaking 
process, you can slow it down to a trickle, and in a survival 
situation, that’s your goal. Here’s how to do it:
 
✓ Stop water intake in the short term. Stop consuming 
your water supply for a short while. Your body has a 
reserve supply, and any water you consume before the 

 Chapter 7: Liquid Capital: Finding Drinking Water 89
reserve is used up will be lost through urination. You 
have to make a judgment call here: Adrift in a life raft 
in moderate conditions, you can go the first 24 hours 
without any water at all. In hot desert conditions (or in 
extreme cold, such as the Arctic), you may not be able to 
last that long.
 
✓ Don’t consume any diuretics. Diuretics are liquids that 
make you have to urinate a lot, such as coffee, soda, alco-
hol, and salt water.
 
✓ Limit strenuous movement. Limit your physical exertion 
to the absolute minimum. Lie still and rest if you can.
 
✓ Keep your body cool. If you’re in hot conditions, stay in 
the shade or erect a covering to make shade. Splash any 
liquid that you can — even salt water — on your body. 
Don’t lie on hot surfaces like the ground. If you’re in cold 
conditions, strip off layers of clothing when you feel 
yourself start to perspire.
 
✓ Don’t eat or smoke. If you have to eat, try to eat carbohy-
drates. You need water to digest food in general but espe-
cially fats and proteins, as well as to process tobacco.
 
✓ Breathe through your nose and limit talking. Try to 
limit the loss of your breath’s vapor.
 
✓ If you’re at high altitude, descend. The higher you are, 
the harder you breathe, and the more vapor you lose.
Rationing water
 
You ration water only when you know you’re in a real survival 
situation. If you don’t know whether you’ve reached the sur-
vival stage yet, then practice some or all of the water conser-
vation steps listed in the preceding section — this is the first 
step in your overall strategy.
 
Base any water-rationing program on your environment. You 
have to find a balance between extending your life and impair-
ing your physical capacities so much that you can no longer 
function. For instance, consider the following:
 
✓ At sea in a raft, the minimum you need is around 1 cup 
(237 milliliters) per day. This is the smallest amount you 
can consume and still survive for more than a week or 
so, and this pertains only to ideal conditions.

Part I: Stayin’ Alive: Basic Wilderness Survival Principles 
90
 
✓ If you’re on land, especially in hot conditions, cutting 
down to a cup per day when you have 2 or 3 gallons (7.5 
or 11.5 liters) lying around is counterproductive, because 
you end up physically incapacitated long before you con-
sume your water.
Discuss any type of water rationing with your companions 
thoroughly. Make sure everyone in your party feels they’re 
included and that they’re being treated fairly. You should also 
discuss plans for finding water, which we cover later in this 
chapter.
What Not to Drink
 
You may be tempted to drink whatever fluids you can find 
during a survival situation. However, some liquids, such as 
salt water, blood, and urine, cause more trouble than they’re 
worth. Here’s why you should stay away from them:
 
✓ Salt water: Salt water increases urination, which makes 
you even more dehydrated. Although some survival 
texts claim you can consume salt water, these claims are 
almost invariably based on faulty sources, or they don’t 
take into account the practical problems (namely, that 
as soon as you start drinking salt water, it’s very hard to 
stop), or they ignore volumes of research. So we have 
some simple advice: Never drink saltwater. For more on 
the problems of drinking salt water, see Chapter 20.
 
✓ Blood: Consuming animal blood causes trouble in several 
ways: Your body must draw on its own water reserves 
to digest the protein contained in the blood, so even 
though you’re drinking fluid, you may be depleting your-
self. Secondly, animals frequently carry diseases in their 
blood — diseases you don’t normally contract because 
you cook the meat. Consuming blood also puts you at 
risk for vomiting, which further dehydrates you. (Note: 
We endorse only one exception to this rule: drinking 
turtle blood at sea. For details, see Chapter 20.)
 
✓ Urine: Generally speaking, drinking unpurified urine is 
highly inadvisable. It’s most likely a diuretic, or worse, 
a poison. And as soon as you begin to dehydrate, your 
urine only becomes denser and saltier. For more on the 
bitter controversy surrounding drinking urine, see the 
nearby sidebar.

 Chapter 7: Liquid Capital: Finding Drinking Water 91
The controversy over drinking urine
Of all the issues we address in this 
book, none is more controversial 
than the question of whether drink-
ing urine extends your life or hastens 
your demise. The truth is that some 
castaways and wilderness survivors 
have endured extended dehydration 
times while drinking urine, and some 
have probably hastened their deaths 
from drinking it, too.
Each year, a story surfaces in which 
a person drinks urine and then 
stays alive well beyond the average 
survival time. The problem is that 
knowing what the person could’ve 
endured had he or she not drunk 
urine is practically impossible. In 
some cases, survivors have gone 
seven full days — an unusually long 
survival time — without any liquid at 
all. Some didn’t even lose conscious-
ness during these extended times, 
even though they drank nothing at 
all. So just because a survivor drank 
urine and had an unusual survival 
time, while dehydrated, doesn’t nec-
essarily mean that urine-drinking and 
extended times are related.
The argument is divided into three 
camps: Those who absolutely 
oppose drinking urine, those who 
favor it, and those who oppose it 
but who’ve read enough case stud-
ies to know that the question prob-
ably doesn’t have an easy answer. 
This last camp, which consists of 
some famous survival experts, usu-
ally addresses the issue in a highly 
diplomatic fashion or simply tries to 
ignore it altogether.
That leaves us with some facts:
 ✓ Urine is sterile when it comes out 
of the body.
 ✓ Urine will keep for about two to 
three days, depending on how 
it’s stored.
 ✓ If you’re properly hydrated at 
the start of the survival situation, 
your first urination would be the 
purest.
 ✓ Drinking urine before you’ve 
exhausted all other possibilities 
is most likely a very bad strat-
egy. You don’t know whether 
you’re drinking something that’s 
harmless or something that’s a 
diuretic. There’s no use, in the 
initial stages, in taking a chance.
 ✓ The more you dehydrate in a 
survival situation, the more 
salty, toxic, and diuretic your 
urine becomes. If you’re cycling 
your urine through your system, 
you need to know that this can 
hasten a shutdown of your renal 
system.
 ✓ In the last stages of dehydra-
tion, the uric acid in unpurified 
urine strips the membranes from 
the inside of your mouth and 
severely aggravates the cracks 
in your lips. Both are exceedingly 
painful traumas.
Based on this information, we sug-
gest that you avoid drinking urine 
and look for other water sources. If 
you have no other water source and 
you’re desperate, consider running 
urine through a solar still.

Part I: Stayin’ Alive: Basic Wilderness Survival Principles 
92
If you’re in dire straits, you can get drinkable water from salt 
water or urine through distillation. See “Distilling salt water 
and urine,” later in this chapter, for details.
 
Knowing the signs of a low-grade or even possibly poisonous 
water supply is essential. Here’s what to watch out for:
 
✓ An acrid, foul, or sewage smell
 
✓ Skeletons of dead animals nearby
 
✓ No plant life whatsoever near the water source
 
✓ Bubbles, foam, or thick green slime on the surface
 
✓ Milky colored water (especially from glaciers)
 
✓ A profusion of cattails or rushes in a stagnant area
You want the highest quality water you can find — before you 
filter and purify. For more on purifying water, see “Filtering 
and Purifying Water,” later in this chapter.
Finding Bodies of Water
You can find drinkable liquid in almost any environment; you 
just have to know where to look. After you find that liquid, you 
may then have to transform it into something you can safely 
consume. (For a look at cleaning water, check out the later 
section titled “Filtering and Purifying Water”; for tips on rec-
ognizing contaminated water, see the preceding section.) This 
section identifies water sources and helps you locate water.
Locating water in drainages
One of the first places to look for water is in a drainage, which 
is any place where rain trickles down and collects. Most drain-
ages are at the bottoms of slopes. Valleys and canyons are 
drainages, as are creek beds, culverts, gullies, ditches, run-
offs, and depressions in the land, such as ponds or lakes.
Sometimes the nearest drainage is obvious: It’s the raging 
river right next to the trail. Many times, however, you have to 
examine your surroundings to determine the pathway rain-
water takes after it falls on the ground. Sometimes old sewer 
pipes can indicate the existence of nearby drainages. Any 
drainage may hold water for months after the last rain.

 Chapter 7: Liquid Capital: Finding Drinking Water 93
If you find a drainage that seems dry, work your way 
downstream until you find a puddle; in temperate or near-
temperate climates, you can almost always find one. If you’re 
in bone-dry conditions, dig for water underneath the drainage.
 
When heading into an unknown drainage, you must mark your 
trail or, at the very least, turn around as you descend to make 
sure you know your way back. Walking downslope from a trail 
frequently gets people lost because as they walk down, they 
break their line-of-sight with the trail. For more on marking 
trails, see Chapter 11.
Knowing other signs of water
You should keep a sharp lookout for signs of water at all 
times — even before the survival situation occurs. Places to 
look for water include the following:
 
✓ Where you see a profusion of green vegetation: This is 
especially true if the vegetation is bunched in a low 
spot, such as in a ditch or at the bottom of a valley or 
depression.
 
✓ Beneath a damp surface, such as damp sand or mud: 
This may indicate ground water. You may have to dig 
down and allow the water to seep into the hole.
 
✓ At the foot of concave banks of dry rivers: For more on 
dry riverbeds, see Chapter 17.
 
✓ In holes and fissures in rock faces: Sometimes rock 
faces have cracks or deep holes in them that hold water 
for months at a time between rains. You may have to use 
a tube or straw made from a reed to suck up the water.
You can also find water by paying attention to wildlife. Most 
animals drink at dawn and at dusk, so try to track their 
courses at these times of the day. When checking out animal 
behavior, look out for the following:
 
✓ Game trails: Game trails are narrow pathways that 
animals of the area beat through the grass. Many times 
these trails lead to water — especially the trails that go 
downslope or converge.
 
✓ Birds, especially smaller birds: If they fly low and 
straight, they’re usually headed for water; after they 

Part I: Stayin’ Alive: Basic Wilderness Survival Principles 
94
drink, they usually have to fly from tree to tree to rest. 
Large birds of prey, however, like eagles, hawks, owls, or 
buzzards, aren’t indicators.
 
✓ Bees, flies, and ants: Bees fly to water, as do green flies. 
Trails of ants crawling up trees frequently lead to pock-
ets of water trapped in hollows.
Catching Rain
All too often, survivors miss their golden opportunity to col-
lect rainwater because they didn’t realize that you have to be 
highly prepared to really take advantage of rainfall. Make sure 
you get organized before the first drop falls.
 
To catch rain, you basically want to create the biggest funnel 
that you can and channel as much water as you can into as 
many containers as you can acquire. The key is to have a 
large surface area, or plane, to catch the maximum number of 
drops. A water-catching plane can be (and usually is) a plastic 
poncho or tarp (see Figure 7-1a), but you can also use metal 
sheeting, broad leaves (Figure 7-1b), fabric such as canvas, or 
even wood to channel drops into your containers.
As in any survival situation, containers are king. If you believe 
rain is coming, collect or build as many water-collection con-
tainers as you can. Here are some options:
 
✓ Look for plastic debris, such as bottles.
 
✓ Shape paper or heavy cloth, like denim, into cups that 
last long enough to drink from.
 
✓ Make large bowls from sturdy half-pieces of bark, sealing 
the ends with plastic, fabric, or clay.
 
✓ Use split bamboo canes — they’re nothing more than a 
long row of bowls.
 
✓ Channel water into natural receptacles that you’ve wid-
ened, such as nearby tree hollows or natural depressions.
 
✓ Let your water-catching plane serve as your container: 
Dig a wide, shallow pit and line it with plastic, fabric, 
paper, or leaves to make a little pond (see Figure 7-1c).
If your collection materials are clean, you can drink the col-
lected rainwater straight, without purifying it.

Figure 7-1: Ways to catch rain.
Collecting Condensation
If water isn’t flowing down rocks or falling from the sky, you 
may have to pull some water out of thin air. The good news 
is that this process is more science than magic. After water 
vapor condenses and reverts to its liquid form, you can move 
in and collect it. In this section, we tell you how to gather dew 
and collect the water that evaporates out of plants.
Gathering dew
You can frequently collect enough condensation or dew to 
drink. This water has to be purified only if you think the sur-
face it comes from is somehow contaminated. Here’s how to 
collect dew:
 
✓ Take your shirt off, tie it to your ankle, and walk through 
the wet grass; then wring out the water into your mouth.
 
✓ Look for puddles of condensation that form in the pits of 
rock faces and inside bowl- or pitcher-shaped leaves.
 
✓ Soak up the drops on metal or glass surfaces with your 
shirt or a sponge. You can also use a credit card or some-
thing like it to coax the drops into a container.
 
Dew usually forms sometime during the night, not at dawn. 
You can maximize the amount of water you collect if you act 
right after the dew has formed.

Part I: Stayin’ Alive: Basic Wilderness Survival Principles 
96
Making a transpiration bag
You can get water from plants by using a transpiration bag. A 
transpiration bag is a plastic bag that you wrap around a tree 
or bush that captures the water that naturally evaporates 
from the vegetation. Droplets form inside the tightly sealed 
bag and then trickle down to collect in the bottom.
You can use any plastic sheeting to make a transpiration bag — 
just make sure you have a tight seal around the vegetation and 
try to make sure that it’s exposed to direct sunlight. If you have 
a tube of any kind, you can thread it down to the bottom of the 
bag and just suck up the fluid as it accumulates — that way, 
you never have to break the seal of the bag and interrupt the 
evaporation process. Check out Figure 7-2 to see how a transpi-
ration bag works.
 
If a plant is poisonous, the water you collect from it is poison-
ous. For more on poisonous plants, see Chapter 8.
Figure 7-2: Transpiration bags on the ground and on a tree.
Setting up a solar still
A solar still is a tightly sealed evaporation unit that allows 
droplets to form and then trickle down to a collection cup. 
You can use this method to get water from vegetation; you 
can also use it to desalinate salt water or purify urine or other 
contaminated water. Sometimes just the wet earth below the 
topsoil can be enough to produce drops if you build a solar 
still over a freshly dug pit.

 Chapter 7: Liquid Capital: Finding Drinking Water 97
You can follow these steps to make a basic vegetation still, 
but this setup (shown in Figure 7-3) also works for all the 
applications previously listed in this chapter. Solar stills like 
this produce only a tiny trickle of water, so build as many as 
you can.
 
1. Dig a pit and fill it with freshly cut plants, the wetter 
and fleshier the better.
 
 
Poisonous plants produce poisonous liquid in solar 
stills. Don’t put plants that ooze milky fluid or sticky 
sap in a solar still (with the exception of the barrel 
cactus — see Chapter 17).
 
 
To purify contaminated liquid, place a container of it 
in your pit in place of the vegetation. If you don’t have 
vegetation or liquid but the ground is wet, you can 
simply put plastic over the empty pit, and the ground-
water will evaporate into the still.
 
2. Put a collection container in the center of the pit, on 
top of the vegetation.
 
3. If possible, extend a tube from the container at the 
bottom to the rim of the pit.
 
 Using a tube vastly improves efficiency. With the tube 
in the cup, you can suck up the condensation without 
disturbing the evaporation process inside the still.
Figure 7-3: A basic solar still with vegetation.

Part I: Stayin’ Alive: Basic Wilderness Survival Principles 
98
 
4. Drape plastic sheeting over the pit; then take a 
slightly pointed stone and push the plastic down 
gently to form a slope.
 
 This allows the condensation to roll down and drip 
into the container. You want to end up with a minia-
ture stalactite shape just over the container. You can 
try canvas if no plastic is available.
 
5. Heap sand or stones around the edge of the plastic 
sheeting to anchor it in place.
 
 Make sure you get a good seal around the plastic.
Extracting Water from Plants
You can get the water you need from nearby vegetation, but 
you have to be on guard for signs of poisonous liquids. This 
section identifies trees and plants that provide safe drinking 
water.
 
Consider any plant liquids that are sticky or milky to be poi-
sonous and unfit to drink!
You can frequently find water in tree hollows and in pitcher- 
or cup-shaped leaves. Or you can extract water from trees if 
you know the right methods. Here’s how:
 
✓ Palms: Coconut, buri, nipa, rattan, and sugar palms all 
contain drinkable liquid. Bend over a flowering stalk of 
palm and cut the tip off to allow the liquid to drip into a 
cup. Make a new cut every 12 hours to renew the flow.
 
✓ Banana and plantain: Cut down the tree and then con-
vert the stump into a reservoir by hollowing it out. The 
tree’s liquid rises and fills this reservoir quickly. Check 
out Figure 7-4. At first, the liquid is too bitter to drink, so 
you have to sit through two to three fillings before the 
liquid is palatable. One tree can provide you with three 
to four days’ worth of liquid.
 
✓ Umbrella tree: Found in western tropical Africa, this tree 
has leaf bases and roots that can yield water.
 
✓ Traveler’s tree: Water collects at the bases of the leaves 
of this fanlike tree, which grows in Madagascar.

 Chapter 7: Liquid Capital: Finding Drinking Water 99
 
✓ Baobab tree: Water collects and is stored in the bottle-
like trunk of this tree, which grows in Australia and 
Africa.
Figure 7-4: Cut down a banana or plantain tree to get water in the trunk 
reservoir.
Other plants that yield water include the following:
 
✓ Bamboo: Green bamboo may contain water. You can 
either cut the sections open and drain them or bend the 
entire cane over, cut the top off, and let the water drip 
into a cup. If the water is clear and doesn’t smell bad, you 
can drink it straight; if it’s brown or smells fermented, 
you have to purify it (see the next section). Brown canes 
sometimes contain water as well.
 
✓ Coconuts: Drink only from mature, brown coconuts. 
Young, green coconuts contain an oil that acts as a laxa-
tive, and too much of it can cause diarrhea.
 
✓ Fleshy plants: Cut down plants with fleshy centers and 
then squeeze or mash them to extract the liquid from 
them. Warning: Some varieties of fleshy cactus are poi-
sonous. For information, see Chapter 17.
 
✓ Vines: To extract water from a vine, first cut it at the 
highest point you can; then cut it at a lower point to 
allow the liquid to drain down. If you cut low first, the 
water just runs back up the vine. Don’t drink any vine 
liquid that appears sticky or milky.

Filtering and Purifying Water
In the field, any body of water can contain bacteria, parasites, 
and toxins, such as pesticides — any one of which can make 
you ill. Nearly all water-borne diseases involve a violent bout 
of diarrhea, which only accelerates dehydration. To avoid 
sickness, consider all water dangerous, regardless of how 
clear it appears. Filter and purify all your water to the best 
of your ability. This section explains methods you can use to 
purify or treat water, starting with the most effective one.
 
In most tropical situations, it’s vastly better to get an orga-
nized rain-catching operation going than to mess around with 
having to filter and purify water.
Boiling water
Boiling water for 10 to 15 minutes is the very best course of 
action in a wilderness situation. If you have a tin cup or some 
other type of metal container and you can get a fire going, 
always boil your water.
Boiling water in a plastic container is possible, but you risk 
destroying your only container. Put some thought into this 
procedure before you risk it. If boiling in plastic is your only 
alternative, proceed slowly and keep a sharp eye on the plas-
tic. It should turn black, but you obviously want to watch for 
the deformities that indicate the plastic is melting. The key 
is to suspend the plastic container from a tripod and never 
allow it to touch hot flames or coals. (For instructions on 
building a tripod, see Chapter 14.)
 
Before boiling any water, consider filtering it first to remove 
larger particles. See the later section “Improvising filters” for 
details.
Going with chemical treatments
If you can’t boil your water, you should use chemicals to 
purify it. (Preferably after filtering — see the later section 
“Improvising filters.”)

 Chapter 7: Liquid Capital: Finding Drinking Water 101
The general rule when using chemicals is to use a standard 
dosage if the water is clear and doesn’t smell bad and to 
double the dosage if the water is cloudy or foul smelling. 
When you have access to chemicals, you usually have one of 
three options, which we present in Table 7-1.
Table 7-1

Iodine
This is liquid iodine,

many first aid kits. You 
may find iodine swabs 
in your kit, which you 
can also use.
3–5 drops liquid iodine 
(when using a 2%

you think the water is

Sodium 
hypochlorite
You can find this in 
household bleach.
2–3 drops per quart 
(liter) of water
For small amounts of water, you should wait at least 30 min-
utes for the chemical to kill enough germs to make the water 
safe. For gallon jugs and larger, wait two hours or more.
Distilling salt water and urine
If you have the necessary tools and time, you can convert salt 
water or urine into drinkable water by heating it in a metal 
container and collecting the steam in fabric. Then wring out 
the fabric into a container. Or you can distill salt water and 
urine in a solar still. For more on this, see “Setting up a solar 
still,” earlier in this chapter.
 
Distillation is the only method that makes salt water or urine 
drinkable. Using water purification tablets doesn’t do any-
thing to make salt water or urine safe. Some filters can desali-
nate salt water, but you must read the label on the package of 
the filter to make sure it’s built to do this highly specialized 
task.

Part I: Stayin’ Alive: Basic Wilderness Survival Principles 
102
Using commercial water filters
Commercially made water filters are available at most outfit-
ters. These are usually small hand pumps that force liquid 
through a cylinder filled with purifying chemicals and dense 
particle filters. The main thing to keep in mind is that many 
water makers aren’t guaranteed to filter out all harmful germs 
or to remove the salt from salt water. Read the instructions 
thoroughly, as well as the warning labels on the pump itself.
Improvising filters
You have access to several types of natural water filters in the 
wilderness, and though they can remove excrement, leeches, 
body parts of dead animals, and many other unpalatables, 
they don’t necessarily remove all the bacteria and toxins from 
the water.
The only time you want to use this last method, improvised 
filters, is as a last resort — or as a precursor to chemical treat-
ments or boiling. Improvised filters are filters you make in the 
field from natural elements, like sand and grass. This section 
looks at a couple of options you have.
 
Using improvised filters is a judgment call. If you’re on the 
verge of being incapacitated and you can’t boil your water, 
distill it, or treat it with chemicals, you may have to try an 
improvised filter so you can remain conscious and ready to 
signal for rescue. The water that comes out of the improvised 
filter may not harm you at all, or it may give you a disease. 
Most water-borne diseases give you diarrhea, and when your 
body begins to purge itself, you begin to dehydrate rapidly. 
Diarrhea can begin as quickly as 8 to 12 hours (in the case of 
dysentery) after you consume bad water, or it may not start 
for several days.
Many times, you have access to several types of filters in the 
wild. You can use any of the following filters, either by them-
selves or in combination:
 
✓ Fabric: You can filter water through a t-shirt or sock (see 
Figure 7-5, on the left) — just make sure you’re not making 
salt water! If you’re near the ocean or if you’ve perspired 
a lot and you try to filter a small amount of fresh water 
through a shirt or sock, you usually taint it with salt.

 Chapter 7: Liquid Capital: Finding Drinking Water 103
 
✓ Vegetation: Grasses can make good filters for large par-
ticles, as can straw (Figure 7-5c).
 
✓ Sand: You can use sand as a filter, especially in layers 
(Figures 7-5b and 7-5d).
 
✓ Charcoal: Make charcoal by burning hardwoods. 
Charcoal neutralizes some toxins and sometimes filters 
out bad tastes (Figures 7-5a and 7-5e).
You can combine natural filters to make a layered multifilter 
by using a sock or a tripod, as in Figure 7-5. (If you’re unfamil-
iar with the construction of the tripod used in the figure, take 
a look at Chapter 14.)

Digging a seepage basin
If you have no filtering equipment or resources at all, you can 
try digging a seepage basin. This is a pit that you dig next to 
a pond, creek, or river that allows the water to seep in. The 
sand between the water source and the pit acts as a crude 
filter. Here’s how to make this basin (refer to Figure 7-6):
 
✓ Next to a river, creek, or pond: If you have any suspi-
cions of the quality of the water, especially in the tropics, 
dig a pit about 2 to 3 feet (0.6 to 0.9 meters) from the 

Part I: Stayin’ Alive: Basic Wilderness Survival Principles 
104
banks of the river, creek, or pond, and use the seepage as 
your water source.
 
✓ Next to the ocean: You can dig behind the first or second 
sand dune on beaches. Sometimes the top 2 inches (5 
centimeters) of the seepage that fills this basin is drink-
able, although it often tastes bad.

fter you solve your most immediate survival problems 
— maintaining good health, keeping a tolerable body 
temperature, and securing a water supply — you need to start 
thinking about food. Although people can and have gone for 
weeks or even months without significant amounts of food, 
having the strength to keep up your campsite, signal for help, 
or start traveling toward civilization all require food.
The good news is that humans have lived off the land for a lot 
longer than they’ve been going to the nearby grocery store. 
Although most civilization-dwellers have forgotten how to 
subsist on what nature provides, this chapter shows you how 
to do exactly that: how to find — and get your hands on — 
food sources even when it seems that there’s nothing to be 
had. You also discover how to clean and cook food.

Part I: Stayin’ Alive: Basic Wilderness Survival Principles

Managing Food in the Wild
When you find yourself in a survival situation, the first thing 
you think about is probably food. But despite your immediate 
desire for food, the human body can go much longer without 
food than it can without water.
 
As soon as your water situation is under control, you need 
to assess your food situation. If you have food on hand, 
remember the following:
 
✓ Don’t eat for the first 24 hours. Your body can handle 
this time just fine on its own, and you may as well get 
used to a little hunger.
 
✓ Don’t eat if you don’t have a good supply of water. 
Digestion requires water.
 
✓ Eat what will spoil earliest first. Consume spoilables, 
such as meat, before foods that keep well, like dry rice or 
any canned or packaged food.
 
✓ Arrange your food by dividing it into portions per person 
per day. Start by assuming you’ll be out for a week (most 
lost hikers are found well within this time frame). If you’re 
dealing with relatively small quantities of food, say, back-
packing meals, lay the food out so you can inspect it 
visually. Doing so allows you to be sure the food isn’t spoiling, 
and it shows you how serious the situation really is.
 
✓ Immediately consider using any existing food as an 
emergency supply and plan to subsist on what you can 
hunt and gather. If you can find food in the wilderness, 
this leaves your nonperishable civilization foods — such 
as granola bars or a can of chili — as a reserve that you 
can count on.
 
✓ Consider ways of preserving your incoming food 
supply. Keep a supply of food coming into camp and 
being stored, while eating only a portion. You can rely 
on that supply if you have to travel or you’re injured and 
unable to check your snares and fishing traps for a while. 
Find out how to preserve food in the later “Drying and 
smoking food” section.
Unless you have a tremendous amount of nonperishable food 
on hand, you should begin to think about living off the land.

 Chapter 8: Gathering and Hunting to Stay Alive in the Wilderness 107
Including Plants in Your 
Wilderness Diet
When you’re stranded in the wild and looking for food, plants 
are a great food source. The good news is that human beings 
can safely eat thousands of kinds of plants. All you have to 
know is which ones are safe to eat. Unfortunately, figuring 
out which ones you can eat — and their seasonal variations 
across the planet — would take a lifetime. No worries. We’re 
here to help. This section explains how you can figure out 
which plants to eat, names some common edible plants, and 
identifies which types of plants to avoid.
Perusing the salad bar: Where 
to find a variety of plants
One of your first tasks in finding plant food is to find a decent 
vantage point, sit down, and take a careful look at the terrain. 
No matter how uniform the area you’re stranded in appears, 
you can probably find some variations in the landscape 
(ecological niches) where different kinds of plants thrive. Even 
in a desert, you can find vegetation niches — including open 
ground (in direct sun) and shaded terrain (under the edges of 
large boulders) — if you look carefully.
 
Instead of wandering aimlessly in search of plant foods, 
systematically search each vegetation niche to increase your 
odds of finding new kinds of plant food. For example, search 
carefully near a lakeshore, then on the open plain between 
the lakeshore and some foothills, and then up in the foothills 
themselves; you can find different plant life in each area.
Trying new foods
You want to survive, don’t you? Then 
get over food taboos. If you can stom-
ach it without throwing up or setting 
off your food allergies, you’re getting 
calories to your body, and that’s the 
point. Of course, if you’re vegetarian 
or vegan, you may have some seri-
ous philosophical soul-searching 
to do if you get into a wilderness 
survival situation. Good luck!

Looking at a plant’s edible parts
You can divide each plant into segments that you can consider 
eating. If the flower doesn’t look at all appetizing, maybe the 
leaves are more palatable, or maybe the roots can supply 
food. This section looks at some common guidelines for 
consuming different types of plant parts. (For info on cooking 
and preparing these plant parts, see “Cooking food you can 
eat now,” later in this chapter.)
Fruits
Fruits are the ripened reproductive elements of plants that 
have flowers. They often contain large numbers of seeds. 
Fruits are normally safe to eat unless they’re
 
✓ Divided into five segments (bananas are an exception)
 
✓ Fermenting (the sickly sweet smell is unmistakable)
 
✓ Moldy
 
You need to be aware of the poisonous berry varieties in the 
areas you’re most likely to visit — do some research before 
you go hiking or camping. Remember this fun little saying 
when deciding whether to eat berries (but to be sure berries 
are safe, always use the Universal Plant Edibility Test that we 
describe later in this chapter):
Red, white, or yellow might kill a fellow!
Black or blue, that’s for you!
Leaves
You can eat many leaves safely. Although you want to avoid 
leaves with hairs or spines, even these can sometimes be 
softened by boiling, as in the case of stinging nettle leaves.
Flowers
Soft flower petals are often edible. They may be bitter, though 
boiling may help.
 
Flowers may cause allergic reactions because they’re often 
coated with pollen.

 Chapter 8: Gathering and Hunting to Stay Alive in the Wilderness 109
Mosses and lichens
In the Arctic, reindeer (caribou) and people alike eat tundra 
mosses. These mosses grow in small tufts, often clinging to 
rocks. Lichens, which are technically a combination of algae 
and a certain kind of fungus, are similarly low-lying; some are 
edible.
Nuts and seeds
Nuts and seeds are high in calories. Except in the case of fruit 
seeds, though, they’re often encased in hard shells that can 
take time to process. Some people have nut allergies. Many 
seeds are poisonous or can at least make you very sick, but 
cooking many of these is an effective way to make them safe.
Roots and tubers
Roots and tubers, which are swollen underground stems, are 
the plant’s nutritional feelers. They can contain quite a bit 
of water when you dig them up. You can dig out and pry up 
roots with a stout wooden staff. Try not to take so many that 
you kill the plant. Some roots and tubers are poisonous, so 
use the Universal Plant Edibility Test if you have any doubt.
Naming edible plants
You’d have to be a botanist to know the thousands of edible 
plants available to you in the wild. To help you, this section 
identifies some of the most common edible plants in various 
climates. We just scratch the surface here, but this list can 
guide you to further researching what’s available in your area. 
(Tip: Identifying plants can be tricky business, so perform the 
Universal Plant Edibility Test, described in the next section, if 
you’re not certain of a plant’s identity.)

The preceding section lists some safe plants to eat. How do 
you know, though, if you’re in the wild and come across a

and kelp (c).
Knowing which plants to avoid
 
To help you figure out which plants not to eat, keep these 
rules in mind. Don’t eat the following:
 
✓ Any plant with a milky sap
 
✓ White, yellow, or red berries
 
✓ Red plants
 
✓ Plants with hairs or spines
 
✓ Plant bulbs (except onions or garlic); beware that the 
death camas (Zigadenus venenosus) bulb, which looks 
very inviting, can kill
 
✓ Fruit that’s divided into five segments (except bananas)
 
✓ Any plant food with an almond scent (this may indicate a 
powerful toxin)
After these rules, what’s left? A lot! In fact, you can eat many 
thousands of kinds of plants. If a plant doesn’t automatically 
score a spot on the forbidden list, you can check your next 
potential meal by using the Universal Plant Edibility Test, 
which we cover next.

Part I: Stayin’ Alive: Basic Wilderness Survival Principles 
114
Taking the Universal Plant Edibility Test
When you’re considering eating any unfamiliar plant food, 
you must carry out the Universal Plant Edibility Test (but 
don’t use the test for fungi, because some are lethal even in 
small doses — see the nearby “Hold the mushrooms, please!” 
sidebar). This test determines whether a given plant is safe 
to eat. The test takes a whole day, and you can only drink 
water during that day, so it’s quite an investment. The return, 
though — knowing that you can safely eat a certain plant — 
may well be worth it.
You can find the test in Table 8-1. If you get through a step 
without having a bad reaction, proceed to the next one. And 
if you go all the way through without any problems, 
congratulations! You can consider the part of the plant 
that you’ve eaten to be safe to eat.

Hunting and Trapping Food
Even though getting meat may be more difficult than gather-
ing plants, it’s not impossible. Since the beginning of time, 
native people all over the world have hunted and trapped 
animals. Instead of running down animals or lunging for them 
from a bush, you too can make tools that extend your reach 
and make it sharper. (Or you can pick up some grasshoppers, 
mealworms, and other little critters that are yours for the 
taking. See the sidebar titled “Finders keepers: Foraging for 
food” for details.)
This section helps you find animals you may want to hunt and 
includes info on how to make and use snares and weapons, 
such as a bow and arrow, spear, and bola. Finally, we tell you 
how to get to the meat.
Looking for tracks and 
critter highways
To hunt or trap successfully, keep an eye open for places 
where animals often travel, feed, drink, and/or sleep. Animals 
often travel repeatedly on game trails, which you can spot 
in many environments. Game trails (see Figure 8-6) are faint 
clearings through vegetation.
You may also notice the trails marked with animal tracks.
Hold the mushrooms, please!
However enticing mushrooms look, 
the species you’re hungrily eyeing 
may be a deadly mimic of the kind 
you grew up finding in forests back 
at home. That’s why we suggest that 
you completely avoid mushrooms 
and other fungi in survival situations. 
Having said that, if you’re in the most 
desperate straits and have only fungi 
to eat and can’t hold out any longer, 
three rules can help you stay alive. 
Don’t eat any fungi with
 ✓ White gills
 ✓ A cup-like basin at its base
 ✓ Rings around the stem

Part I: Stayin’ Alive: Basic Wilderness Survival Principles 
116
Figure 8-6: Look for faint (or distinctive) paths through vegetation.
Finders keepers: Foraging for food
Most hunting-and-gathering aborigi-
nal folk worldwide gather just as 
much as they hunt or trap. This life-
style is called foraging. Foragers are
 ✓ Opportunistic: Just about any-
thing that flies, hops, swims, 
walks, or crawls can be cooked 
and eaten (including mussels, 
limpets, and clams). For exam-
ple, a grasshopper, a snail, or a 
nest of eggs all serve as nutri-
tious food sources. You can also 
snare the parent when it returns 
to the nest.
 ✓ Observant: Learn the patterns of 
the land. See how things change 
by day, night, and at high- and 
low-tide (but avoid any shellfish 
you find above the high-tide 
mark — they can be poisonous). 
Think of yourself as a part of the 
landscape rather than an actor 
on the stage of the landscape. 
Think about how other animals 
make their living out here and 
envision how you can do the 
same. If it isn’t feasible where 
you are, you may have to move 
somewhere else.

 Chapter 8: Gathering and Hunting to Stay Alive in the Wilderness 117
Snaring small animals
Snares capture animals that you can later collect and eat. A 
snare is essentially a loop of wire or very strong cordage that 
an animal gets entangled in and can’t escape. If the snare 
closes around the throat, the animal may die before you reach 
it. If the snare only snags the animal’s leg, you may have to 
kill the animal when you check your snares. Snares are best-
suited to capturing smallish mammals, such as squirrels and 
rabbits.
Setting up your snares
Making snares is fairly easy; most just require a good piece 
of wire or very thin cordage. You can strip suitable snare-
making wire from cars, airplanes, and other vehicles. You 
need lengths well over 1 foot (0.3 meters) long. If the wire is 
sheathed in plastic insulation, strip it off before making the 
snare.
To create a basic snare, follow these easy steps:
 
1. Make a loop about 4 inches (10 centimeters) in 
diameter (for the neck of a squirrel) or larger if 
you’re trying to snare a larger animal.
 
2. Tie the snare off with a snare knot.
 
 To tie a snare knot, loop the end of the line around 
twice and then thread the end through the first loop. 
Make sure you pull the knot tight. Check out Figure 8-7 
for an example.
a
b
c
d
Figure 8-7: A snare knot.

Part I: Stayin’ Alive: Basic Wilderness Survival Principles 
118
 
3. Arrange the snare loop so that it lies right in the 
animal’s path.
 
 Take some time to study the game trail or branch on 
which you’re deploying the snare.
 
4. Tie one end of the snare wire to a sturdy tree or 
stake, bury the stake deep, and regularly check on it 
to see what you’ve caught.
 
When you make a snare, wear gloves (if you have them) to 
prevent your scent from getting on the wire, which alerts the 
animal of danger. If you can’t do this, you can camouflage 
your scent by burying the snare wire in dirt for 24 hours 
before deploying it, using pieces of cloth or socks on your 
hands to prevent you from scent-marking your snare lines.
Some types of snares you may want to use include the following:
 
✓ Branch snare: Place branch snares in series on branches 
where you’ve seen animals like squirrels travel frequently. 
Figure 8-8a shows a series of squirrel snares; place many 
of these snares so that one traps the squirrel as it travels 
on the branch.
 
✓ Burrow-hole snare: You can spot animal burrows in 
many places, such as near the banks of rivers or under 
heavy brush. In any case, you can use a burrow-hole 
snare (see Figure 8-8b), which you place just outside the 
entrance to a burrow. It traps the animal as it exits or 
enters.
 
 When setting up a burrow-hold snare, firmly anchor a 
strong stake near the burrow. Better yet, anchor the 
snare to an existing branch, sapling, or trunk so the animal 
doesn’t spot some new element in its environment.
 
✓ Game-trail snare: A snare on a game trail has lightweight 
brush walls that corral the animal into the snare (see 
Figure 8-8c). Most animals are unwilling to travel 
backward, so they run into the snare instead of backing 
away from it if they spot it.
 
 You make this snare by suspending a slipknot loop over 
a trail. Place the wire on two small forked twigs just 
above ground level so the animal’s neck goes into the 
snare.

 Chapter 8: Gathering and Hunting to Stay Alive in the Wilderness 119
a
b
c
Figure 8-8: Different types of snare setups.
You can use bait to lure animals into snares, but we suggest 
focusing on laying out many baitless snares and checking 
them often. Baiting is complicated, and some baits alert the 
animal that something is amiss. If you do use bait, you need 
bait that the animal is familiar with or bait that’s unfamiliar 
but attractive to the animal.
Checking snares and collecting your catch
Check and maintain your snares regularly. Sometimes the 
snare kills the animal, which is one reason to check snares 
often; predators may get to your prospective meal before 
you do. Other times, you may come back to a snare and find 
it holding a wounded, desperate, and potentially dangerous 
animal. Kill a snared animal as quickly and humanely as 
possible. A sturdy club works fine. (Check out the later 
section “Going in for the kill with a club.”)
 
Be equipped with a spear (or bow and arrow, bola, or other 
weapon that extends your reach) anytime you venture away 
from camp, ready to kill animals you come across while 
making or checking your snares. We discuss these other 
weapons in the upcoming sections.

Part I: Stayin’ Alive: Basic Wilderness Survival Principles 
120
Using a throwing stick
A throwing stick, although not as sexy as a spear or bow and 
arrow (see the next sections), can be effective for killing small 
animals such as rabbits and squirrels. A throwing stick is 
larger than a stone and more likely to hit the target. It’s 
especially useful when you throw it into groups of smaller 
animals, such as a flock of birds.
Use any 1- to 2-foot long (0.3- to 0.6-meter long) green branch 
or sapling that’s from 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 centimeters) in 
diameter. Strip it of all bark and whittle away any branches. 
Try to find a branch that’s a little heavier on one end than 
the other. Throw the stick so that it hurtles through the air 
horizontally, something like a Frisbee.
Making and using a spear
A spear is a good implement for nearly any wilderness survival 
situation. You can use a good, sturdy spear for self-defense 
from animals, as a probe for checking out murky water or 
thick brush, and for a dozen other things. For hunting, spears 
can wound large animals enough that, although the animal 
flees the attack, you can follow its blood trail (the spoor) until 
the animal dies or is so weak that it’s an easy kill.
Constructing a spear isn’t difficult. Just follow these steps 
(and Figure 8-9):
 
1. Select a green sapling, thicker than a broomstick, 
and cut it down (Figure 8-9a).
 
2. Strip the bark from the sapling and cut the length to 
about 6 feet (1.8 meters; see Figure 8-9b).
 
3. Sharpen one end of the sapling with any knife you 
have available, be it metal or stone, as in Figure 8-9c.
 
4. Harden the sharp end of the spear by holding it over a 
fire for a while, being sure to rotate it (see Figure 8-9d).
 
 Rotating drives some of the water out of the wood, 
blackening the tip and making it very hard; now it will 
puncture rather than just bend. Note: If you’re going 
to add an armature (keep reading for instructions), 
you don’t have to sharpen or harden the tip with fire.

 Chapter 8: Gathering and Hunting to Stay Alive in the Wilderness 121

d
Figure 8-9: Creating your own spear.
If you prefer, you can mount an armature on the end of a 
spear. An armature is any hard, sharp item that can serve 
your needs. You need to bind an armature carefully and very 
tightly onto the working end of the spear. Begin by splitting 
the end of the spear by hammering a knife into the end (see 
Figure 8-10a). Then slip in the armature (see Figure 8-10b) 
and wrap tightly around the whole assembly with strong 
cordage (as in Figure 8-10c); be sure to wrap below the 
armature to prevent the spear from splitting. You can use any 
type of cordage, although wire tends to slip.

c
Figure 8-10: Lashing an armature onto a spear.
Good items for making an armature include the following:
 
✓ A large nail: Bind a nail to your spear very tightly. A nail 
is best for fishing, which doesn’t put as much stress on 
the nail as using the spear for self-defense from a large 
animal does.

Part I: Stayin’ Alive: Basic Wilderness Survival Principles 
122
 
✓ A sharpened sliver of hard plastic: You can get one from 
a shattered car-light cover.
 
✓ A sharpened splinter of bone or antler: See Chapter 14 
for how to process bone and antler into sharp slivers.
 
✓ A sharpened sliver of stone or glass: These take more 
time and effort to shape than bone or antler splinters, 
but they can be very effective.
If you can put notches into the sides of the armature, your 
cordage has something more to grab, which holds the 
armature more firmly.
 
Despite what you see on TV or at the movies, few aboriginal 
people worldwide actually throw spears at animals to kill 
them. Throwing your spear will probably just result in a 
fleeing animal and a broken spear tip. For attacks at range, a 
bow and arrow, throwing stick, or bola is much more likely to 
land you some food than a spear is.
Making and using 
a bow and arrow
People have been using bows and arrows for tens of thousands 
of years, and they can be very effective weapons against 
both small and large animals. Making and using them is a fun 
activity for an afternoon, and it’s great practice for anyone 
contemplating going outdoors. Among other things, practice 
can show you how far you can expect to be accurate with a 
bow (for most people — with practice — that’s about 10 to 15 
yards, or 9.1 to 13.7 meters).
Creating the bow
To make a bow, just follow these easy steps:
 
1. Select and cut down a sturdy 1- to 1.5-inch (2.5- to 
4-centimeter) diameter sapling with a straight trunk 
(see Figure 8-11a).
 
2. Strip off the bark (Figure 8-11b), leaving a clean 
4-foot (1.2-meter) pole.
 
3. Whittle away the ends of the bow with a knife (as 
in Figure 8-11c), leaving a sturdy midsection as a 
handle (Figure 8-11d).

4. Notch the upper and lower ends to accept the 
bowstring (Figure 8-12a).
 
 Cut about 
1⁄3 of the way into the branch but no deeper. 
The heartwood is the strongest wood, and you don’t 
want to cut into it too deeply.
 
5. Tie your string to one end of the bow using the two 
half hitches knot (as in Figure 8-12b).
 
 Use fishing line or some other suitably durable 
cordage, such as electrical wire.
 
6. Bend the bow and attach the other end of the string 
(Figure 8-12c).

1. Select a thin, sturdy (green wood) branch as an 
arrow shaft (see Figure 8-13a).
 
2. Strip off the bark (Figure 8-13b).
 
3. Use a knife (or sharp stone) to shave away irregular-
ities and whittle a point on the arrow (Figure 8-13c).
 
 At this point, you can harden the tip over a fire as in 
Figure 8-13d, or you can try to attach a separate point 
(the armature). Here’s how:
 
1. Split the shaft on one end and then tie off the 
shaft below the split (to prevent the split from 
spreading).
 
2. Insert an armature (such as a sharpened splinter 
of bone or a sliver of glass) into the split (Figure 
8-13e). For more on how to make armatures from 
stone, bone, or antler, see Chapter 14.
 
3. Use more cordage to secure the split wood 
around the base of the armature (Figure 8-13e).
 
3. Cut a notch into the base of the arrow for the bow-
string and then tie off the arrow above the notch to 
prevent it from splitting the arrow (as in Figure 8-13f).
 
 Your complete arrow should look something like 
Figure 8-13g.

 Chapter 8: Gathering and Hunting to Stay Alive in the Wilderness 125
Practicing the fine art of archery
Here’s how to use the bow and arrow (see Figure 8-14):
 
1. Stand with your chest at 90 degrees to the target (not 
facing the target), as in Figure 8-14a.
 
 In Figure 8-14b, the archer has dropped to one knee, 
perhaps hiding behind cover in an ambush or simply 
seeking a more stable firing position.
 
2. Fit the notch of the arrow on the bowstring.
 
 In Figure 8-14c, you see the grip you use to hold the 
arrow in place and draw back the string (Note: We 
show a left hand drawing the bow for clarity.) Use 
the three upper fingers of the hand (not the thumb or 
pinky finger), holding the arrow between your index 
and middle fingers. The other end of the arrow should 
rest against the bow, not quite resting on your thumb, 
as in Figure 8-14d.
 
3. Lock the arm that’s holding the bow straight out in 
front and aim for the target.
 
 In a survival situation, simply aim for the largest body 
mass visible, such as the abdomen. A gut-shot animal 
won’t die quickly, so you’ll have to use your club to 
kill it.
 
 To prevent the string from chafing you when you 
release it, you may want to first tie a patch of cloth 
to the wrist of the hand holding the bow. Figure 8-14e 
shows this bracer.
 
4. Draw the string only as far back as your chin and 
then sight directly down the arrow shaft; release the 
arrow.
 
 Pulling the bowstring beyond the ear can cause the 
string to lacerate your ear and probably doesn’t add 
much more power.

Making and using a bola
People have used bolas for thousands of years to hunt all 
kinds of animals, including birds and rabbits. Bolas are simply 
strings weighted at one end. When they find their target, they 
can wrap around and ensnare the legs, immobilizing the prey 
and allowing you to move in for the killing blow with a club.
Bolas are easy to make; just stick to these steps:
 
1. Find three to five smooth, round stones, each an 
inch or so in diameter; for each stone, cut a piece of 
cloth or other textile about 4 inches (10 centimeters) 
square (see Figure 8-15a).
 
2. Wrap each stone in its own cloth (Figure 8-15b) and 
tie off this cloth tightly with cord (Figure 8-15c).
 
3. Connect all the cords and make a loop for swinging 
the bola (Figure 8-15d).
 
You need to practice using bolas accurately. Whirl a bola well 
above your head (Figure 8-15e) and then release to send 
the weapon at the target. Whirling a bola without knocking 
yourself out takes practice. In the heat of the hunt, whirl the 
bola only one or two times before releasing so you don’t alert 
the prey.

Going in for the kill with a club
Many animals won’t be killed by spear, bow and arrow, or 
bola. Many times, you have to follow a blood trail to the 
injured, exhausted animal and then kill it with your club.
 
To make a killing club, select a 1- or 2-inch (2.5- or 5-centimeter) 
diameter sapling and cut a 3-foot (0.9-meter) length from it. 
Strip the bark (which would otherwise decay and skip around 
like a sheath) and lash a wrist-loop of some kind of cordage 
around the base so it doesn’t fly out of your hand.
Be prepared to attack with a purposeful explosion of energy; 
just like you, an injured animal will fight hard to stay alive. 
Use a ruthless, lightning-fast attack, aiming at the neck to kill 
the animal humanely and quickly.
 
Don’t underestimate any animal’s ferocity or the damage it 
can do even with small claws and teeth! The danger from 
infection is real.
Butchering your next meal
After you make your kill, you need to take quick action and 
butcher the animal before it starts to decay. Butcher animals 
at least 50 yards (45 meters) from your camp, near water if 
possible, so you don’t attract predators and scavengers to 
your campsite.

Part I: Stayin’ Alive: Basic Wilderness Survival Principles 
128
Skinning a larger animal
To butcher a larger animal, follow these steps:
 
1. Hang a large mammal by the hind limbs, cut deeply 
across the neck, and let the blood drain away (see 
Figure 8-16a).
 
 You can capture and consume the blood instead of 
draining it away, but consuming it can carry a heavy 
risk of infection, and we don’t recommend it except in 
the direst of circumstances.
 
2. Cut along the dotted lines shown in Figure 8-16b to 
facilitate removing the hide.
 
 You’re not butchering the animal (taking it apart) yet, 
just removing the hide.
 
3. Cut with just the tip of a sharp knife slipped under 
the skin (see Figure 8-16c) and cut the genitals as 
shown to prevent infection.
 
4. Remove the hide, cut away the intestines, and gener-
ally empty the body cavity (see Figure 8-16d.)
 
 Deer have scent glands behind the knee that can smell 
foul; you can avoid the smell by cutting around the 
knee rather than through it.
 
 You’re now ready to cut the muscle from the bones 
and cook it. In survival situations, you want to eat as 
many parts of the animal as you can stomach: lungs, 
knuckles — everything but hooves, bones, and hide 
are pretty much edible (though carnivore livers can 
be toxic).
 
Keep the bones (and if available, antlers) of any mammal 
larger than a small dog. Bone and antler are excellent raw 
materials for making survival tools (as you see in Chapter 14), 
as are the hide and sinews (stringy tissues that hold the limbs 
together), which you can use as cordage.

Skinning a smaller animal
To skin a small animal, follow these steps:
 
1. Make an incision though the skin (but not deeper 
than the skin) across the back, as in Figure 8-17a.
 
2. Grab the two sides of the hide by slipping your fin-
gers under it and pulling outward (see Figure 8-17b).
 
 When the skin snags at the paws, you can easily slice 
it off with a knife. Small mammals don’t need to be 
bled if you’re going to roast them whole next to a fire, 
which is a good way to cook them.
 
3. After you skin the animal, remove the meat.
 
 For information on getting that meat into edible form, 
see “The Wilderness Café: Preparing Food Outdoors,” 
later in this chapter.

Getting Your Hands on 
Freshwater Fish
In addition to gathering plant foods and hunting, fishing — if 
water’s nearby — is a good way to live off the land. You can 
often find fish in large numbers, and with some ingenuity (and 
patience), they can be relatively easy to get your teeth into! 
This section focuses specifically on freshwater fish, including 
info on catching them in different ways and how to clean and 
cook them. (Check out Chapter 20 for more specific information 
on fishing at sea.)
Locating fish
Before you can enjoy the delicious taste of a bluegill, perch, or 
some other freshwater fish, you need to know where to catch 
them. Fish like to take cover in certain places in rivers and 
streams. You can find them in the following places:
 
✓ In eddies (mini whirlpools), where they can rest 
(Figure 8-18a)
 
✓ Just downstream of rocks or gravel bars, where they can 
rest (Figure 8-18b)
 
✓ In the shade under overhanging vegetation or logs, where 
they can hide (Figure 8-18c)

Fishing with a hook and line
Fishing with a hook and line (also known as angling) is 
relatively straightforward. If you have a wilderness survival 
kit, you may have a line and hooks ready to go; you only 
have to bait them, weight them, and set them in the water. 
If you don’t have hooks, you can improvise them from many 
materials, including wire, safety pins, or splinters of bone, 
antler, or plastic. You can set out as many fishing lines as you 
have hooks.
Here’s how to fish without a reel:
 
1. Tie a hook, weight, and float to the line; tie the other 
end to a 5- or 6-foot (1.5- or 1.8-meter) pole, cut from 
a living tree.
 
 You may want to put the hook at the end of the line, 
with a weight — any piece of stone or metal — above 
the hook, or vice versa. The weight keeps the line from 
pulling out horizontally in a current.
 
 A float — which you can make from any piece of floating 
material, such as cork — can show you that a fish is 
taking the bait. Figure 8-19a shows a hook baited with a 
worm, using a float but no weight. In a waterway with a 
little current, use a weight, as in Figure 8-19b.
 
2. Bait your hook and drop the line in the water.
 
 Bait is a topic for a whole encyclopedia, but here we 
can say that winged insects, worms, and grubs are all 
good bait.
 
3. Check your lines every few hours and bring in your 
catch by taking in the line, hand over hand.
 
 Have a club ready to kill hooked fish, which may flop 
right back into the water if you’re not careful.

132

Figure 8-19: Fishing with a hook and line but no reel.
Put out multiple fishing lines and check them often, just like 
snares. The beauty of this system is that it works 24/7.
Making and using fishing spears
Catching fish with a spear is common worldwide even today. 
You can master this technique with some practice. To make 
your spear, stick to these easy steps (and check out Chapter 
14 for more on tying knots):
 
1. Cut down a long sapling (up to 8 feet, or 2.4 meters) 
and strip it of bark.
 
2. Cut a notch into the base of the spear to attach a 
lanyard (see Figure 8-20a).
 
 A lanyard is a simple leash made of any durable 
cordage that prevents you from losing your spear in 
the water.
 
3. Use a quick clove hitch to tie your lanyard into the 
notch at the base of the spear (Figure 8-20b).
 
4. Finish the leash with a bowline knot, leaving a loop 
large enough to slip your hand in and out easily 
(refer to Figure 8-20c).

 Chapter 8: Gathering and Hunting to Stay Alive in the Wilderness 133

c
Figure 8-20: Crafting a fishing spear and fastening it to your wrist.
 
5. Fashion some barbs from bone, antler, or even hard 
plastic or wood; attach the armature to the spear.
 
 We show you how to attach armatures in the earlier 
section “Making and using a spear.” You should catch 
fish with barbed spear armatures; these prevent the 
fish from wriggling off the spear. Figure 8-21 shows 
a range of possible designs. Because fish are hard to 
spear, lash several armatures on the spearhead. Make 
your lashings tight. You can secure lashing with sticky 
pine pitch (sap).
Figure 8-21: Barbed armatures can make spearing fish easier.

Part I: Stayin’ Alive: Basic Wilderness Survival Principles 
134
 
Here are some spear-fishing tips:
 
✓ When spear-fishing from a bank (see Figure 8-22), try to 
keep your shadow under you or behind you to keep from 
alerting fish of your presence.
 
✓ If you wade into the shallows, don’t go deeper than 
knee-deep and move slowly to prevent splashes that 
drive fish away.
 
✓ Aim a little lower than the fish appears in the water. 
This corrects for the water’s distortion of perspective; 
as Figure 8-22, the fish’s apparent position (in gray) is 
somewhat above its real position.
Figure 8-22: Fishing with a spear.
Fishing with a net
Making a net is so laborious (and requires so much cordage) 
that we don’t want to cover it in this book. However, if you 
come across an old fishing net (you may find one on the 
seashore), you can use it to catch fish by stretching it across 
a water course and weighting the bottom. Check the net every 
few hours.

 Chapter 8: Gathering and Hunting to Stay Alive in the Wilderness 135
Creating a fish bottle trap
A 2-liter soda bottle makes a great trap for small fish. To use 
the bottle, just cut off the top and add some rocks or sand 
to weigh the bottle down. Flip the top around and insert it 
backward into the rest of the bottle, as in Figure 8-23. It may 
hold by itself, or you can sew through the plastic with heavy 
thread for a few stitches or use duct tape to secure the joint.
Simply place the bottle trap in the water and wait. With the 
weighted bottle on the bottom of a stream, small fish may 
enter the opening but find it hard to swim out again.
Figure 8-23: A soda-bottle trap.
Preparing fish to eat
You can boil small fish whole, without bothering with butchery, 
but any fish larger than the palm of the hand should be 
butchered. Here’s how to clean and cook a fish:
 
1. Cut the fish down the belly and remove the guts, 
either by pulling them out (Figure 8-24a) or by 
cutting them out with a knife (Figure 8-24b).
 
 You can use the guts as bait. Just be sure to store 
them away from camp.

Part I: Stayin’ Alive: Basic Wilderness Survival Principles 
136
 
2. Decapitate larger fish.
 
 You can boil the head for soup and cook the resulting 
fillet.

The Wilderness Café: Preparing 
Food Outdoors
You may not have a fancy cutlery set or a stove or a clean 
kitchen sink, but you can still prepare your food in the 
wilderness to make it safe and reasonably appetizing. In this 
section, we tell you how to prepare food before you eat it and 
how to preserve food for later. (For information on building a 
fire, see Chapter 5; for directions on lashing together a tripod 
that you can use to cook over a fire, flip to Chapter 14.)
 
Whatever animal parts you don’t eat can be burned 
(thoroughly, down to just ashes) or buried away from camp 
(at least 50 yards, or 45 meters) to prevent attracting other 
animals.
Cooking food you can eat now
With few exceptions, you should cook wilderness survival 
food to kill bacteria and parasites. Cooking can also improve 
flavor and make some foods (like snails) more palatable. This 
section gives you an overview of how to cook and otherwise 
prepare foods in the wild.

 Chapter 8: Gathering and Hunting to Stay Alive in the Wilderness 137
Plant foods
Although not all plant foods require cooking, you should cook 
most of them. Microorganisms thrive on plant surfaces as well 
as in water that plants may be growing in. Boiling, steaming, 
and otherwise cooking plant foods can decrease their nutritional 
value, but it’s worth knowing that you’re not eating the 
colonies of bacteria that live in a single drop of swamp water.
You can boil plant foods, bake them, or roast them over a 
flame. Here’s how to prepare various plant foods:
 
✓ Fruits: Wash fruits before eating them. Most fruits don’t 
need to be cooked, though you can make some (like the 
plantain, a banana-like fruit) more palatable by cooking.
 
✓ Nuts and seeds: Wash and shell the nuts and seeds on a 
large, clean working area, such as the surface of a clean 
tarp.
 
✓ Leaves and flowers: Thoroughly wash leaves before 
eating them. Flowers must be washed and boiled.
 
✓ Moss: Boil moss before eating it.
 
✓ Roots: You have to cook most roots to soften them up 
before eating. Bake them in coals or boil them. When 
they’re softened, you can mash them if you like.
 
 You can bake foods like roots in a ball of wet clay, which 
you then place into embers until it hardens. When you 
break off the clay, the root food should be well cooked.
Mammal foods
 
Although some wilderness TV shows have featured people 
devouring uncooked (or even living) animals on camera, don’t 
do it. This is just a trick for dramatic TV, and it’s a spectacularly 
bad idea. Cooking kills many potentially lethal microscopic 
life-forms; it’s the main reason that humans cook food in the 
first place!
You can roast mammal meat on a rack or spit above fire, boil 
it in water, or bake it in clay or wrapped in thick layers of 
leaves. Mammal meat should be well-done, not raw or bloody, 
when you consume it.

Part I: Stayin’ Alive: Basic Wilderness Survival Principles 
138
You can split open mammal bones with a heavy rock (crush 
the bone on an anvil stone) to get at the marrow, a nutritious, 
calorie-rich tissue inside. You can also boil bones to extract 
every possible calorie and nutrient in a tasty broth.
 
The organs of mammals are normally good to eat, but be 
aware that the liver of many carnivores contains high 
concentrations of vitamin A, which can cause death. Don’t eat 
carnivore livers.
Insects and invertebrates
Grasshoppers, snails, mussels, and other critters can be 
roasted on a rack over a fire or boiled. Some insects are so 
hard to process, though, that it’s best to just crush them into 
a paste that you boil in water as a soup.
 
Insects are related to shellfish, so if you have a seafood 
allergy, leave insects off the menu.
Fish
Although you may get away with eating some fish uncooked 
(and you may have to if you’re stranded in a dinghy!), fish 
should normally be cooked, like any other animal tissues.
Fish are excellent survival food because they cook quickly 
and can be dried and preserved for a long time. Figure 8-25a 
shows how to rack a larger fish next to a fire for cooking (we 
explain smoking fish and other meat in the next section); be 
sure to slice small flaps in the meat, allowing the filet to hang 
on the rack. You can simply skewer smaller fish on a clean 
stick next to a fire as in Figure 8-25b; when the fish is dry and 
flaky, it’s ready to eat. Or use other methods, as long as you 
can prevent the body from falling apart when it heats up. 
Boiling prevents you from losing any of the fish in the fire.
Drying and smoking food
Preserve your survival foods if you’re not eating them immedi-
ately; the wilderness is no place to waste anything! Dried food 
is less liable to attract insects and is slightly water-resistant. 
Store dried foods carefully.

 Chapter 8: Gathering and Hunting to Stay Alive in the Wilderness 139

Figure 8-25: Cooking large and small fish.
You can mash fruit flat and spread it (not too thinly!) on a 
flat surface, like a rock, to dry in the sun. The resulting fruit 
leather makes a good trail food.
You can dry meat and fish on a rack — just be sure the wood 
for making the drying rack is clean. Also try to use nonresinous 
wood for smoking foods — smoke from resin, which is present 
in pine, sours the meat. To smoke fish and meat, follow these 
steps using a teepee-style rack (see Figure 8-26):
 
1. Build your fire and let it die down.
 
 You don’t need a hot fire with flames to dry meat; in 
fact, it’s better to dry food slowly, over coals.
 
2. Build a tripod over the fire.
 
 Make sure the branches are sturdy. We explain how to 
build a tripod in Chapter 14.
 
3. After laying strips of meat (either mammal or fish) 
on the various rungs of the tripod, you can cover the 
structure with a tarp or even brush to concentrate 
the smoke.

avigation, like fire building, is a skill you should practice 
a little when the pressure’s off. Later on, when it counts, 
this small amount of practice can end up meaning as much to 
you in the wild as a good knife or a dependable lighter.
In this chapter, we show you the basics of navigation, or 
otherwise staying oriented in the wild. We show you how to 
use a map, a compass, and a GPS receiver. (For information 
on navigation using the stars and sun, see Chapter 10.)
Grasping Navigation Basics
Whether you’re working your way back to civilization, moving 
toward a water source, or simply trying to figure out where 
you left your pack, being able to navigate is essential to your 
survival. You want to know not only where you are but also 
where you’re heading. Even in the era of the GPS, you should 
keep in mind some basic navigational practices. These 
principles apply whenever you head into the wild:

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
144
 
✓ Try to know your position as closely as you can, as 
often as you can. Many times, people get lost in the 
wilderness due to a momentary lapse in awareness. (If 
you have no idea where you are, see Chapter 11 for tips 
on what to do when you’re lost or disoriented.)
 
✓ Navigate for yourself. Work out as many situations and 
problems as you can in your own mind, regardless of 
who “the navigator” is, because nobody’s perfect.
 
✓ Trust your instruments. When you’re disoriented (and 
really frustrated!), you tend to ignore what your map and 
compass are telling you — especially when they don’t 
seem to make sense. Maps and compasses can be wrong, 
but it’s rare.
 
✓ Always orient your map. Keep your map aligned with 
the terrain around you at all times. Check out the section 
“Orienting your map,” later in this chapter, for more info.
 
✓ Be thorough. Double-check your calculations, and if 
you’re moving through new, unexplored territory, make 
notes of your movements.
 
To simplify the whole process of navigation, use your wits 
and instruments to find large landmarks; then use these large, 
easy-to-find landmarks to find smaller ones.
Setting a route with waypoints
Whenever you move through the wilderness, you should 
establish a route made up of a series of waypoints. Waypoints 
are prominent places along your route that give you the ability 
to know precisely where you are for a moment. You can use 
waypoints in two ways:
 
✓ Beforehand: You can use waypoints as a way to break up 
your route into goals — places you want to reach, check 
off, and then move past. Plot your waypoints on a map or 
pick them out in the terrain in front of you.
 
✓ As you go: You can use waypoints to record your course, 
which gives you a “trail of breadcrumbs” so you can 
make your way out of the wilderness. This is such an 
important part of navigation that practically all GPS units 
have a waypoint function that allows you to record your 
waypoints as you’re passing them.

 Chapter 9: Finding Your Way with Tools: Basic Wilderness Navigation 145
If you’re operating in an area that doesn’t have trails, you can 
always use handrails. A handrail is exactly what the name 
implies: a sturdy, reliable object or landmark — such as a 
large rock outcropping or a river or creek — that can guide 
you. Even if you seem to be going a long way out of your 
way, moving from large landmark to large landmark is almost 
invariably the fastest, easiest way to travel in the wilderness.
 
A handrail is almost always better than a beeline. A beeline 
is a straight line cut across the wilderness, and it often only 
looks like the shortest route. In reality, it’s almost invariably 
the longest — especially when you’re dealing with hilly terrain 
or dense underbrush in a jungle.
Using deliberate offset
 
Deliberate offset, sometimes called aiming off, is a navigation 
trick in which you intentionally miss a small landmark to hit a 
large one. Why would you want to do that? Because sometimes 
the waypoint you need to reach is so small that when you aim 
right for it, you miss it and go right past.
A lot of navigation in the wilderness centers on trying to use 
large landmarks to find smaller ones. For example, you can 
use deliberate offset if you’re trying to reach a house that sits 
near a road. Instead of trying to hit a bull’s-eye and land on the 
front porch, aim a little off — say, a quarter mile down the road 
(Figure 9-1). When you arrive at the road, you should know 
which direction to turn because you deliberately aimed a little 
off, and you can now turn and travel straight to the house.
Figure 9-1: Using deliberate offset to find a small landmark.

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
146
Map Reading Made Easy
When you head out into the wilderness, you need to be able 
to read the appropriate kind of map. You may end up using 
any of the following:
 
✓ State and national park maps: You usually find these 
maps at the ranger station or online on the park’s Web 
site.
 
✓ Travel maps: These maps tend to incorporate detail of 
both human-made and natural features; they usually 
cover a large area, such as an entire province or nation.
 
✓ United States Geological Survey (USGS) maps: USGS 
maps are usually referred to as topographic maps, or topo 
maps. These maps use contour lines to show the shape 
of landforms, such as mountains and valleys.
To make sense of the map you’re using, you need a good 
foundation in map reading. The map’s key or legend can give 
you the specifics on your map’s symbols and colors. Also 
note the map’s scale; sometimes the scale is inches to miles 
or inches to kilometers. For now, this section helps you figure 
out what the different parts on your map mean so you know 
where you are and where you’re going.
Deciphering your map’s colors
The colors on your map can tell you a lot (as long as you take 
them with a grain of salt). Table 9-1 lists the standard colors 
for a map showing the area’s physical features.

water, because flash floods can come in 
seconds if a rainstorm hits.

On many USGS maps, trails — which are drawn as tiny channels 
of dotted lines — are so faint that you need a magnifying glass 
to see them. Magnifying glasses are molded into the baseplates 
of most modern land compasses.
Measuring map distances
To read a map and calculate distances, start with the scale. 
The scale, usually located at the bottom of the map, helps you 
determine the distance between landmarks and how large 
landforms are in real life (except for manmade structures, 
which aren’t drawn to scale). The scale is expressed as a 
ratio, such as 1:75,000. What that means is that 1 inch on your 
map equals 75,000 inches, or 6,250 feet, on the ground. But on 
a more practical level, the scale allows you to convert inches 
on a map to miles (or kilometers) on land. The best way to 
calculate distances is to lay something that bends, such as a 
string or wire, over the scale at the bottom, mark it at various 
intervals, and then use it as a measuring stick on the map.
 
When measuring distance on the map, you’re always at risk 
of confusing the various units of measurement — kilometers, 
statute (land) miles, nautical miles, and so on. You can stay 

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
148
out of trouble by writing down distances or any other type of 
measurement on paper rather than trying to work things out 
in your head.
Using contour lines to identify 
the shape of the land
To read a topographic map, you need to know how to interpret 
contour lines. Contour lines are the mapmaker’s way of 
expressing a three-dimensional world on a flat map. Each 
contour line denotes a change in the altitude of the terrain, 
such as when you have hills or valleys. At the bottom of 
your topographic map, you can find the contour interval, the 
amount of altitude change that each contour line equals. For 
example, a contour interval may equate to 500 feet in elevation.
 
On a topographic map, the closer the contour lines, the 
steeper the terrain. Densely packed lines (as in Figure 9-2a) 
may indicate a sharp slope or cliff. Widely spaced lines (as 
in Figure 9-2b) mean gentle grades, easy slopes, and flatter 
terrain.
Many times, the contour lines form designs on your map that 
correspond with certain types of landforms. You can use 
these recognizable shapes to quickly identify landforms in the 
terrain around you. Following is a list of contour designs and 
their real-world equivalents; Figure 9-2 shows how those 
contour lines translate into 3D.
 
✓ V-shaped lines pointing toward higher elevation: 
Drainages, like creeks, runoffs, washes, and sometimes 
canyons (as in Figure 9-2c)
 
✓ V-shaped lines pointing toward lower elevation: Ridge 
lines, which are long crests, and spurs, which are small 
crests that that protrude from the main crest (as in 
Figure 9-2d)
 
✓ U-shaped lines pointing toward higher elevation: 
Valleys, usually gentler depressions than canyons (as in 
Figure 9-2e); densely packed lines near the base of the U 
usually mean a cliff or sometimes a waterfall
 
✓ Circles, especially circles decreasing in size: Peaks and 
hilltops, as in Figure 9-2f

 Chapter 9: Finding Your Way with Tools: Basic Wilderness Navigation 149
 
✓ Hourglass forms (two U-shapes butted against each 
other): Passes in mountains and hills, as in Figure 9-2g

Understanding your coordinates
Practically all maps are based on a grid of some sort. There 
are a variety of types of grids, but the two you’re most likely 
to run into are latitude and longitude and Universal Transverse 
Mercator (UTM). We discuss both in this section.
Using latitude and longitude
When trying to determine where you are on your map, you 
can check out the latitude and longitude. These numbers are 
important because they tell you how far north or south you 
are or how far east or west.

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
150
Latitude and longitude are both measured in degrees, and 
each degree is divided into 60 minutes. A minute is equal to 
about 1 nautical mile (about 6,076 feet), which is about 15 
percent longer than a statute mile (5,280 feet). (Note: If the 
distance scale at the bottom of your map uses miles, it usually 
means statute miles unless otherwise indicated). A minute — 
1 nautical mile — is always identified by its unique symbol: '.
Latitude lines run horizontally, and they tell you how far north 
or south you are. There are 90° of north latitude and 90° of 
south latitude. You can’t miss this type of helpful measurement 
on your map. It’s always located along the side margin and is 
identified by the degree symbol, °.
When you stand on the equator, your latitude is 0°, and when 
you stand at the North Pole, your latitude is 90° North. If you 
stand on the South Pole, your latitude is 90° South. Easy, 
isn’t it? A higher number means you’re closer to the pole. 
You don’t need a sailor’s cap or a parrot for that. If you look 
at your map and figure out that your latitude is 26°11' North 
and the Coast Guard tells you over the radio that they’re at 
26°13' North, you know that they’re 2 nautical miles north of 
you because they have a higher number value. The opposite 
is true when you’re south of the equator — if a location has a 
higher number than yours, it must be south of you.
Longitude tells you how far east or west you are. There are 
180° of west longitude and 180° of east longitude. Instead of 
starting at the equator, longitude starts at the Prime Meridian, 
a vertical line passing through Greenwich, England. If you’re 
standing at 118°36' West and you need to go to 118°38' West, 
then you need to travel 2 nautical miles west, because your 
destination has a higher number.
 
If you travel 180° to the west of the Prime Meridian, you hit 
the International Date Line, an imaginary line of longitude in 
the middle of the Pacific Ocean. If, on the other hand, you 
leave Greenwich and travel 180° east, you hit the same line! In 
this way, the world is divided into two halves: west longitude 
and east longitude.
Using the UTM grid
If your map has a UTM grid, you can use it to your advantage if 
you know how to read it. UTM stands for Universal Transverse 
Mercator, a navigation system used by mapmakers all over 

 Chapter 9: Finding Your Way with Tools: Basic Wilderness Navigation 151
the world. This system is based on the meter, with grid lines 
drawn on maps at every kilometer (1,000 meters, or about 
0.62 miles).
Using UTM is very easy: The vertical lines drawn on your map 
are called eastings. Eastings are numbered, and their numbers 
increase as you move east. Moreover, the numbers count 
meters as they move across your map. For example, if you’re 
near the easting 350000 m.E. and your map shows that the 
easting 351000 m.E. is near your camp, then you know that 
your tent is 1,000 meters to the east.
The light blue lines running horizontally across your map are 
called northings. Northings’ numbers increase as they move 
northward. So if your GPS tells you you’re located at 411536 
m.N and you look on your map and see that the river you 
want to reach runs along the northing 411000 m.N., then you 
know that the river is 536 meters to your south.
Navigating with a Map
Many times, you can navigate through the wilderness with 
just a map — especially if you’re on well-marked trails. The 
problem is that your map can get you lost, too! The basic 
practices in this section can cut down on the unwanted angst.
Orienting your map
 
Each time you pull your map out, you have to orient it. 
Orienting a map means physically aligning the map so that it 
matches the surrounding terrain. If the river is on your left 
and the hills are on the right, then you should rotate the map 
in your hands until the map reflects that real-world reality — 
even if it means turning the map upside down! Why? Because 
the very essence of map reading is about interpreting spatial 
relationships — how the real world really looks. If your map 
isn’t in sync with the real world around you, then you’re just 
inviting mistakes. You can orient your map in one of two 
ways:
 
✓ Eyeball it. Look at the nearby features and then rotate 
the map until it’s close.

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
152
 
✓ Use a compass. If you have a compass nearby, use it; 
compass orientation is much more exact. For more on 
orienting you map with the use of a compass, see “Using 
your compass to orient the map,” later in this chapter.
Keeping track of distance 
traveled: Dead reckoning
You can find your way in the wild with a map by dead reckoning. 
Dead reckoning is a method of figuring out where you probably 
are by keeping track of how fast you’re going and how long 
you’ve traveled. For example, if you walk at 3 miles (4.8 
kilometers) an hour and you’ve walked for about two hours, 
you can estimate that you’ve travelled 6 miles (9.6 kilometers).
Ideally, you should dead-reckon every time you go out. 
Keeping a log, a journal of your travels, is the very best way 
to dead-reckon, but even if you just make a mental note of 
the time of day at every important juncture, you’re helping 
yourself a lot.
 
When estimating how fast you’re moving, you have to take 
into account difficulties in terrain, especially when you leave 
the trail. The accepted standard of rate of travel by foot is 3 
miles per hour over flat terrain. When leaving the trail, your 
pace usually drops off to less than a mile an hour. One of the 
most common errors in navigation is to overestimate how fast 
you’re traveling on foot.
 
When estimating your rate of travel and navigating through 
the wilderness, you frequently estimate distances to landmarks, 
even if it’s just subconsciously. Here are a few situations in 
which just about anybody can assume landmarks are closer 
than they really are:
 
✓ When looking uphill or downhill (watch out for this one 
especially)
 
✓ Whenever a bright light is shining on your landmark, 
especially a large one, such as a mountain; if the sun is 
shining brightly on a mountain in front of you, expect it 
to be much farther away than you initially think

 Chapter 9: Finding Your Way with Tools: Basic Wilderness Navigation 153
 
✓ Whenever looking across flatlands, such as a desert, or 
bodies of water
 
✓ Whenever the air is unusually clear, such as after a good 
rain and when the air is cool and crisp
Understanding How Your 
Compass Works
Your compass gives you the ability to stand anywhere in the 
world and determine which direction is north. If you know 
that, you can determine all the other directions relatively 
easily.
A variety of compass types are out there. You can find highly 
accurate digital compasses that correct a compass’s errors 
for you, or you can opt for back-sighting compasses, which 
have what look like gun sights mounted on them to tell you 
which direction you’re currently pointing. But the standard 
compass for wilderness travel is an orienteering compass 
molded into a clear plastic baseplate, like the one in Figure 
9-3. It’s top-sighting, which means it’s made to be mounted 
below eye-level, or held low, so you can read it by looking 
over its top. Top-sighting compasses also include many 
cheap compasses — affectionately called gumball-machine 
compasses — that find their way into survival kits, in glove 
compartments, or onto keychains.
Orienteering and gumball-machine compasses are the two 
compass types you’re likely to come across in a survival 
situation. Both are top-sighting, so if you understand how an 
orienteering compass works, you can figure out how to use 
the gumball-machine one.
Breaking down the parts of 
an orienteering compass
Before you can fully understand how an orienteering compass 
works and how you can use it in the wild, you need to know 
the parts of a compass:

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
154
 
✓ Baseplate: The flat plastic platform that the compass unit 
sits on (see Figure 9-3a)
 
✓ Direction-of-travel arrow: The large arrow on the 
baseplate, where you read the bearing (see Figure 9-3b)
 
✓ Housing (bezel): The small plastic dome that protects 
the compass needle and also has the degree readings on 
it (Figure 9-3c)
 
✓ Orienting arrow: The red arrow painted on the inside of 
the housing (Figure 9-3d)
 
✓ Straight edge: Simply the edge of the baseplate; it works 
like a ruler (Figure 9-3e)
 
✓ Needle: The small, magnetized bar that swivels around 
inside the housing and always points north (Figure 9-3f)

Being aware of potential errors
Although a compass is a great navigational tool, it isn’t 
accurate 100 percent of the time. As long as you’re aware 
of the two types of slight error, you can adjust the compass 
readings to correct the errors and determine what the 
true readings should be.

 Chapter 9: Finding Your Way with Tools: Basic Wilderness Navigation 155
Understanding declination (variation)
You probably know the exasperating truth by now: Your 
shiny new compass probably doesn’t point to the North Pole. 
It points to magnetic north, which is an alignment with the 
Earth’s magnetic field. On land maps, the difference between 
these two spots is called declination (on nautical charts, 
magnetic variation). Declination is simply the amount of error 
your compass has in any given area. You have to add or 
subtract this amount from your compass’s reading to get 
true north.
At the bottom of your map, you can find the amount of 
declination you need to adjust for in your area. Look for a 
diagram with the annotations TN, which stands for true north, 
and MN, which stands for magnetic north, and then a number, 
like 13°. The declination may be east or west:
 
✓ East: If magnetic north is located to the right of true 
north in the diagram (as it is on maps of most western 
states in the U.S.) the declination is east (see Figure 9-4a). 
Subtract the number of degrees from your compass 
bearing to get a true bearing.
 
✓ West: If magnetic north is to the left (as in most eastern 
states), the declination is west (Figure 9-4b). Add the 
number of degrees to your compass bearing to get a true 
bearing.
 
To remember whether to add or subtract, just remember a 
simple rhyme: “East, least; West, best.” How does that help 
you? Well, if your compass claims you’re pointing to 90° but 
you look at the bottom of your map and you see that you have 
a declination of 13° east, you just remember “East, least,” so 
you subtract 13° and you know that you’re really pointing 77° 
(true bearing).
 
Any type of compass can have a declination adjustment, a 
feature that corrects the error automatically. The declination 
adjustment feature usually takes the form of an extra dial 
inside the main dial of the compass. This extra dial changes 
the way the compass points — ever-so-slightly — to make 
the instrument point toward the North Pole. Electronic units 
do this same trick but with a computer, which you of course 
never see.

Interference: Understanding local deviation
Sometimes nearby magnetic disturbances can influence 
your compass and cause it to have a second type of error: 
deviation. If you have stereo speakers nearby or if you have 
headphones on or if you have a large block of iron — like an 
engine, for example — you can expect it to pull on your 
compass’s magnetic needle. The best way to find out whether 
you have this type of compass error is simply to move the 
compass around in one area. If you see the needle pulling to 
one side for no apparent reason, try to get as far away as 
possible from what you think is influencing the needle.
Navigating with a 
Map and Compass
Your map and compass can give you more peace of mind in 
the wilderness than anything else (short of a GPS; look later 
in this chapter for more on the GPS). However, they can also 
help you get lost if you don’t use them correctly. Map-and-
compass navigation usually requires a little practice before 
you get that wonderful ah-ha experience, so be patient and 
keep at it.

 Chapter 9: Finding Your Way with Tools: Basic Wilderness Navigation 157
 
When using your map and compass, keep in mind a few basic 
procedural ideas:
 
✓ Try to hold your compass at stomach-level when 
sighting (unless your compass is back-sighting). This 
usually gives you the greatest understanding of the 
spatial relationships around you.
 
✓ When moving across the landscape, try to be flexible 
in the way you use the compass. For example, if you’re 
moving on a river and you know where you are, you 
don’t have to be precise in every bearing. On the other 
hand, if you’re approaching a small landmark, you should 
slow down and be very precise, because small landmarks 
are so easy to miss.
 
✓ Write down anything and everything, especially if you’re 
at risk of being lost. A journal or log or simply a good piece 
of scratch paper to keep notes on can help tremendously.
This section gives you directions for performing basic 
navigational functions with a common handheld, top-sighting 
orienteering compass. If you have a cheap gumball-machine 
compass, check out the sidebar titled “Stuck with a gumball-
machine compass?” for some adjustments you can make.
Understanding common 
compass usage
The orienteering compass may seem complex, but keep in 
mind that most of what you do with this compass requires 
only two or three actions:
 
✓ Taking a bearing: A bearing is an imaginary line drawn 
from your compass to something you see, like a 
landmark. Simply point the direction-of-travel arrow at 
something in the terrain, and you’re taking a bearing.
 
✓ Adjusting the housing: Turn the housing dial, usually 
while holding the compass stationary on the map.
 
✓ Using the compass like a ruler: Line up the straight edge 
of the compass’s baseplate on two points of the map. 
This is useful because the baseplate’s sides are made 
to run perfectly parallel to the direction-of-travel arrow 
(more on that later.)

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
158
Establishing a field bearing
You can get started moving with your compass as your 
guide by taking a field bearing. A field bearing is a compass 
measurement that gives you the ability to establish an orderly 
course in the wilderness and navigate in a straight line. It 
doesn’t require the use of a map. Check out Figure 9-5 while 
you’re following these steps:
 
1. Point the direction-of-travel arrow in the direction 
you want to travel (see Figure 9-5a).
 
2. Rotate the housing until the red end of the magnetic 
needle is centered above the orienting arrow (the 
magnetic arrow is pointing to north).
 
 This is called boxing the needle. Figure 9-5b aligns 
north with the compass needle; the bearing to the 
landmark is 258°.
a
b
Figure 9-5: Taking a bearing in the field with an orienteering compass.
 
3. Read the bearing, in degrees, where the housing 
meets the direction-of-travel arrow.
 
 This reading is your field bearing.
 
4. Pick out a series of landmarks along this field 
bearing and make note of them.

 Chapter 9: Finding Your Way with Tools: Basic Wilderness Navigation 159
 
 You can begin walking toward the first landmark in the 
series — just don’t touch that dial! Leave the housing 
of your compass alone. You’re trying to navigate on a 
set course now. You want to reach your first landmark, 
make sure the next landmark lines up on your course, 
and then continue on.
 
Your field bearing doesn’t need to be corrected for declination 
because you’re simply using your compass as a pointer — 
you’re trying to travel in a straight line, nothing more.
Stuck with a gumball-machine 
compass?
If you get stuck in a survival situation 
where all you have is a basic gumball-
machine compass, you can still 
take a field bearing. Simply hold the 
compass between your thumbs and 
forefingers. Your fingers should form 
a triangle in front of you, slightly 
below chest level.
Rotate compass until needle is
aligned with “N”.
Read bearing from ‘pointing’ fingers;
here, about 300 degrees (magnetic.)
Now, point your finger-triangle in the 
direction you intend to go, and then 
rotate the compass until the needle 
lines up with north. Read your bearing 
from right behind where your 
fingers touch, and walk toward 
your chosen landmarks.
In this way, the gumball-machine 
compass works just like the ori-
enteering compass that we use 
throughout this chapter. All you have 
to do is use a little ingenuity instead 
of using sophisticated equipment 
features. Here’s how:
 ✓ Instead of turning a housing dial, 
you rotate the whole compass.
 ✓ To box the needle, you center the 
needle behind the N mark.
 ✓ You use a finger-triangle to repre-
sent the direction-of-travel arrow 
of an orienteering compass.

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
160
Using your compass 
to orient the map
Using your compass to orient your map can go a long way 
toward helping you figure out where you are — especially if 
you’re disoriented or lost. When you use this technique, you 
can rest assured that your map matches up with the physical 
features around you. That helps a lot if you’re trying to figure 
out whether the trail is on your right or left — or behind you!
 
1. Lay your map on a flat surface and place your compass 
on it, with the straight edge of the compass’s baseplate 
lined up with any straight edge on the map.
 
2. Rotate your compass’s housing until the N, located 
above the 360° marker, is centered on the red 
direction-of-travel line.
 
3. Rotate the entire map and compass around smoothly 
until the red end of the compass’s magnetic needle is 
centered over the orienting arrow inside the housing.
 
 You’re boxing the needle. Your map is now oriented to 
magnetic north (see Figure 9-6a) — which isn’t exactly 
good enough, because you want true north.
 
4. Correct for declination.
 
 Now you want to eliminate the error between magnetic 
north and true north. For example, if you have a 13° east 
declination, you have to subtract 13° from your magnetic 
heading, which gives you 347° (360° – 13°). Rotate the 
housing to 347° and then box the needle by rotating the 
entire map again. (See the earlier section “Being aware of 
potential errors” for more on declination.)
When you’re finished, your map and compass should look like 
this:
 
✓ The baseplate of the compass should be lined up on one 
of the straight edges of the map.
 
✓ The red needle should be hovering over the orienting 
arrow inside the compass housing.
 
✓ The housing should be set to read 347° on the direction-of-
travel arrow (corrected for declination).

 Chapter 9: Finding Your Way with Tools: Basic Wilderness Navigation 161
When this is done, your map is officially oriented to true 
north, and it matches your surroundings exactly. Check out 
Figure 9-6b.
a
b
Figure 9-6: A map oriented with a compass both before (a) and after (b) 
correcting for declination.
The following sections show you additional ways to use your 
map and compass. All these methods use this map-orienting 
procedure as their foundation.
Setting your course from 
a map bearing
If you know where you are on the map and you know where 
you want to go, you can take a bearing from the map and then 
use it to make your way across the terrain. The upshot is that 
you can navigate toward a landmark that isn’t yet in sight. 
Just follow these steps:
 
1. Orient the map (see the preceding section).
 
2. Lightly draw a straight line from your starting 
position to your destination.
 
3. Place the edge of your compass’s baseplate on the 
line, with the direction-of-travel arrow pointing 
toward your destination.
 
4. While holding the compass and map firmly in place, 
rotate the housing until you’ve boxed the red part 
of the magnetic needle in the orienting arrow inside 
the housing.

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
162
 
5. Lift the compass from the map while keeping the red 
end of the magnetic needle boxed over the orienting 
arrow.
 
 You’re now pointing toward your destination.
After you set your course from a map bearing, you don’t need 
to make any more adjustments to the compass or perform any 
adding or subtracting. You can begin moving from landmark 
to landmark.
Making improvised compasses
You can make an accurate compass 
yourself if you can simply magnetize a 
small, thin piece of metal. The problem 
is that some metal won’t magnetize! 
You need iron-based objects for this, 
which in this modern day means things 
made of steel. Sewing needles work 
well, but some are now being made 
from nickel-plated brass, which can’t 
be magnetized. Paper clips also work, 
as do some double-edged razors and 
clips on the tops of writing pens.
To magnetize your needle, you 
can use
 ✓ The magnets inside stereo 
speakers — even the small ones 
like those found in headphones
 ✓ Stones containing iron, which 
usually means stones that are 
brown or rust-colored
 ✓ Materials that carry a static 
charge, such as pieces of fabric 
and human hair (the best fabrics 
are silk and nylon)
 ✓ Batteries and wire
Here’s how to make your compass:
 1. Magnetize your “needle.”
 
 Whether using a magnet, stone, or 
your own head of hair, the trick is to 
stroke the piece of metal over your 
magnetizer slowly, repeatedly, 
and always in the same direction. 
For example, when using a piece 
of silk fabric, take your needle and 
stroke it 100 to 200 times across 
the silk — but always in the same 
direction. To use a battery to 
magnetize a needle, hook up a 
wire to the poles of the battery 
and then wrap the wire around 
your needle like a coil.
 2. Suspend your needle so it can 
rotate freely.
 
 You can do this by hanging it from 
a string, a long hair, or by putting 
it on a floating object in a bowl of 
water. Floating objects include 
cork, wooden matchsticks, and 
the best of all, leaves. The con-
tainer has to be nonferrous (not 
made of iron), like a plastic or 
porcelain cup or an aluminum 
mess tin. When free to rotate, 
the needle should align itself on 
a north-south axis.

 Chapter 9: Finding Your Way with Tools: Basic Wilderness Navigation 163
Navigating with a GPS Receiver
The global positioning system (GPS) is a network of satellites 
that send precise navigation data to hundreds of thousands 
of receivers all over the world. Receivers come in all sizes 
and levels of sophistication. More and more, they’re becoming 
a standard feature in cars and cellphones. Knowing how the 
technology can work for you in the wild can go a long way 
toward getting you back home.
This section familiarizes you with what GPS receivers offer — 
what they can and can’t do — and then shows you some basic 
actions to make sure GPS works for you in the wild.
What to expect from GPS
When you activate a GPS receiver, the unit makes contact with 
its satellite network, works out a few calculations, and then 
tells you where you are. (It usually lets you know by flashing 
“Position Acquired” on the screen.) The modern GPS system is 
so accurate that it’s rarely off by more than just a few feet.
GPS receivers range widely in sophistication, but all units do 
one or two things:
 
✓ They give you your position purely as a series of 
coordinates, which you then have to transfer to a paper 
map to find exactly where you are. (See the earlier 
section “Understanding your coordinates” for info on 
using map coordinates.)
 
✓ They show you your position on an electronic map that’s 
installed on the unit.
Most GPS receivers also have a compass function that can tell 
you which way you’re pointing.
 
Most maps on GPS units lack sufficient detail to help you with 
navigation in tricky areas, and the compass calculations in 
GPS receivers sometimes lag behind real time. And like any 
other electronic instrument, GPS receivers can break down 
in the field or simply run out of battery power. A great 
navigational package for the wilderness includes a GPS, a 
paper map, and an orienteering compass — regardless of 
what data your GPS receiver can offer you.

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
164
 
When carrying a GPS receiver in cold conditions, put it on a 
cord around your neck and slip it inside your shirt to keep the 
batteries warm, which makes them last longer.
Setting your receiver
Before you start trying to figure out where you are, you have 
to make sure the receiver is giving you the right data! Some 
GPS receivers give you the right data through default, but 
you still need to make sure you’re set up before heading out 
into the wild. Check the GPS receiver’s settings for the datum, 
position format, and unit format.
Datum
Datum is the survey information that was used to make a 
particular map, especially a topographic map. If you’re using 
a GPS receiver that gives only coordinates, you first have to 
make sure that your receiver sends you information based on 
the datum used to create your paper map.
To find out which datum was used to make the map you’re 
currently using, look in the margins of the map for one of the 
following statements or abbreviations:
 
✓ North American Datum 1927 (NAD27)
 
✓ North American Datum 1983 (NAD83)
 
✓ World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84)
To determine which datum your GPS unit is set to, go to the 
menu and click on the datum function. Then select the datum 
that matches your map’s datum.
Position format
Regardless of whether your unit gives you a map or just 
coordinates, you have to set the position format. This is 
your opportunity to choose which coordinate system you 
want to use to locate your position. Most receivers offer 
you the choice between latitude/longitude and the UTM 
coordinate system. Choose the one used by your paper map 

 Chapter 9: Finding Your Way with Tools: Basic Wilderness Navigation 165
or the system you feel most comfortable using if the map has 
both. For more on how these coordinate systems work, see 
“Understanding your coordinates,” earlier in this chapter.
Unit format
Finally, you need to make sure you’re using a unit format that 
you understand. The unit format setting is your chance to set 
the receiver to the units of measurement — miles, kilometers, 
degrees, whatever — that your map is using in its scale. The 
GPS unit may do this for you, or it may offer you a choice.
 
If you’re using the latitude/longitude coordinate system, 
you probably want to use nautical miles as your unit of 
measurement. If you’re using UTM positions, using kilometers 
is best.
Using GPS in the wild
 
Probably the most important action you can take with your 
GPS receiver is to record waypoints, places of interest and 
importance you pass along your travels. The single most 
important waypoint is your start point. Before entering 
any wilderness area, bring up the unit’s menu, go into the 
waypoint feature, and record your position at that moment. 
Regardless of where you go afterward or how lost you 
become, you can now go into the waypoint feature and ask 
the receiver where this starting point is — and how far away 
you are.
As you go about your travels in the wild, you can continue to 
record waypoints. If you do become disoriented, you can go 
to the waypoint feature and find where the last waypoint was 
and backtrack. (Record these waypoint readings on paper, 
too, because GPS units can run down in the field.)
A second function that can go a long way toward keeping you 
found, not lost, is the track function. After you turn on the 
track feature, the unit automatically makes a record of your 
travels. The receiver has to remain turned on for this to work, 
so battery power is always a consideration. But if you have 

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
166
fresh batteries, this is a great feature because it gives you a 
“trail of breadcrumbs” that can help you find your way back 
or simply tell you how far you’ve gone.
 
GPS receivers can’t always communicate with the satellites, 
but you can solve this problem many times by simply knowing 
that receivers sometimes have to be in just the right spot to 
work. If your unit isn’t receiving, move it — especially if a cliff 
or a hill is nearby. If it still doesn’t work, move it again. You 
may have to get creative.

Looking Up to the Skies: 
Celestial Navigation
In This Chapter
▶ Relying on the sun to find your way
▶ Checking with the stars
P
eople have been using the sun and the stars to find their 
way across land and sea for thousands of years. Sometimes 
this type of navigation can be complex, but more often than not, 
using the heavens to navigate is relatively easy.
In this chapter, we show you how to find direction using 
the sun, the stars, and a little ingenuity. Keep in mind that 
though these techniques are sometimes incredibly accurate, 
more often than not, they give you only general direction. 
Nevertheless, if you don’t have a compass or a GPS unit, you 
should consider the results that come from these methods to 
be very reliable.
Finding Direction with the Sun
The sun can be a great tool to help you find your way in the 
wilderness. You can use its position in the sky just like a 
compass if you know a few easy techniques.
None of these methods are hard to do; just keep in mind 
that the closer you are to the equator or to the poles, the 
less accurate these methods are. Luckily, the majority of the 
world’s landmasses — including North America, Europe, and 
most of Asia — lie at latitudes that make these sun-navigation 
techniques useful.

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
168
 
You can improve the usefulness of all these techniques by 
carefully drawing a mock-up of a compass in the dirt or sand. 
After you find north and south, draw a 90° line to indicate east 
and west. Likewise, if your technique gives you east and west, 
draw in north and south.
Finding north and south 
around midday
The sun rises in the east and sets in the west, regardless of 
where you find yourself on planet Earth. Just keep in mind 
that it doesn’t always rise at due east, or precisely east, nor 
does it always set at due west. But you can take the dawn’s 
early light to be generally east and sunset to be generally west 
anywhere in the world.
At midday, if you’re anywhere in North America, Europe, or 
Northern Asia, the sun lies due south of you. For example, if 
it’s lunch hour, say, between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m., you can rest 
assured that if you turn and face the shining sun, you’re facing 
south. And behind you, over your shoulder, lies north. From 
this easy technique, you can figure out the other directions, 
too. If you face the sun at midday in the Northern Hemisphere, 
east is on your left, and west is on your right.
Likewise, you can use this technique to find north in some 
of the southernmost parts of the Southern Hemisphere. At 
midday, if you’re in New Zealand, Argentina, or South Africa, 
the sun lies due north of you. (In the northernmost extremes 
of Argentina or South Africa, this may not be accurate on a 
few days out of the year. On those days, the sun appears to be 
directly overhead at midday.)
Drawing a compass with the 
stick and shadow method
If you’re in the wilderness without a compass or GPS, you 
can construct a reliable type of compass using the stick and 
shadow method. This direction-finding instrument can be 
highly accurate, and it works everywhere on Earth.
To create a compass using the stick and shadow method, 
follow these simple steps:

 Chapter 10: Looking Up to the Skies: Celestial Navigation 169
 
1. Take a 3-foot-long stick and plant it in the ground.
 
 You can use practically any length of stick, but 3 feet 
(0.9 meters) is ideal.
 
2. Take a rock and place it right on the point where the 
stick’s shadow ends (see Figure 10-1a).
 
 This is your first mark, and it represents west.
 
3. Wait at least 15 minutes and mark the new location of 
the shadow’s point with another rock (Figure 10-1b).
 
 During this time, the shadow moves. This second 
point is east. If you don’t have a watch, you can simply 
estimate this time — it doesn’t have to be exact.
 
4. Put your left foot on the first mark and your right 
foot on the second mark.
 
 You’re now facing true north.
 
5. Draw a straight line from one rock to the next.
 
 This is your west-east line. See Figure 10-1c.
 
6. To complete the compass, make a cross by drawing a 
line through the middle of the west-east line (Figure 
10-1d).
 
 This second line should be at a 90° angle to your first 
line. This is your north-south line.

Finding direction with your 
wristwatch and the sun
If you have your wristwatch set to local time, you can use it 
to find direction. This technique uses the sun’s position to 
determine north and south. Although the wristwatch method 
isn’t as precise as the stick and shadow method (see the 
preceding section), it’s much faster because you don’t have to 
wait 15 minutes to find out which way is north or south. Just 
keep in mind that this method becomes less accurate 
the closer you are to the equator. But if you don’t have the 
time to wait, just point your wristwatch at the sun and get on 
your way!
If you’re in the Northern Hemisphere, follow these instructions 
to find directions by using a watch:
 
1. Take a sheet of paper and place it on the ground; 
then put your wristwatch on the paper.
 
 You don’t have to use paper to mark your directions; 
you can perform this technique on dirt or sand. The 
main idea is to be thorough and make sure you have a 
clear picture of a compass before moving on.
 
 The wristwatch technique for finding direction uses 
the hour hand of a watch. But what if your watch is 
digital? No problem. Simply draw a circle on a piece 
of paper and then draw in where the hands would be 
at the current time. This is your “wristwatch” for the 
next few minutes.
 
2. Take a twig and stand it up on the paper so the 
twig forms a shadow.
 
3. Rotate your wristwatch until the hour hand (the 
small hand!) points toward the sun and is perfectly 
lined up under the shadow.
 
 If your watch is set to local Daylight Saving Time 
(DST), you must subtract one hour from the time 
shown on your watch. For example, if your watch 
reads 3:00, either temporarily turn it back to 2:00 or 
simply make sure the stick’s shadow falls over the 
point where the hour hand would be if you did move 

 Chapter 10: Looking Up to the Skies: Celestial Navigation 171
it back (in this case, 2:00). Note: In the United States, 
DST runs from the second Sunday in March until the 
first Sunday in November; in Europe, it goes from the 
last Sunday in March until the last Sunday in October.
 
4. Make a mark on the sheet of paper over the 12 at the 
top of your watch.
 
5. Draw a mark at the halfway point between the 
shadow and 12.
 
 This mark points due south. Take a look at Figure 10-2a.
 
6. Take a straight edge and lay it over the watch; make 
a mark on the exact opposite side of your watch 
from your due south mark.
 
 When you have this second mark, you have due north.
 
7. Without disturbing the paper, remove the watch and 
draw your north-south line; then draw your east-west 
line.
 
When navigating with a wristwatch, you don’t necessarily 
have to use the paper each time you take a reading. If you 
have a good idea of which way you’re going, take readings on 
the move by just eyeballing the wristwatch.

Hemisphere (a) and Southern Hemisphere (b).

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
172
 
The wristwatch method of finding direction works only if your 
watch is set to local time. If your watch isn’t set to local time, 
use another technique. See the earlier section “Drawing a 
compass with the stick and shadow method” for one option.
In due time: Making a 
portable sun compass
If you’re a hands-on type of person, 
you can create your own portable 
sun compass to help you in a bind. 
All you need to make this improvised 
compass is a piece of paper (paper-
board or cardboard work slightly 
better, because they’re slightly 
tougher than paper, and you have to 
carry the sun compass with you when 
you navigate), a stick, and a watch so 
you can track the time. The only prob-
lem with this method is that you need 
several hours, or even an entire day, 
to make it right. But if you’re facing 
a long march to safety, it’s a good 
idea to make one of these because 
it keeps you from having to stop and 
set up a shadow compass every time 
you want to find direction.
To make a sun compass, follow these 
steps (and check out the following 
figure):
 1. Take a piece of paper (or paper-
board or cardboard) and put it on 
the ground in a place where the 
sun will shine on it all day.
 2. Attach a 1- to 2-inch (2.5- to 
5-centimeter) stick to the center 
of the paper.
 
 This is your shadow-maker. 
Making your compass consists 
of simply tracking the shadow’s 
path across the paper for as long 
as possible.
 3. Throughout the day, at intervals 
of every 30 minutes, mark where 
the stick’s shadow ends; write 
down the time of day next to 
each mark.
 
 For example, at 10:30, place a dot 
at the very tip of the shadow and 
write “10:30” next to your mark. 
Then wait 30 minutes and make 
a new mark with “11:00” next to 
it and so on. Look at the following 
figure. (The time increments in the 
figure are marked only on the hour 
for clarity, but you get the idea.)
 4. Stay at it as long as you can.
 
 It won’t take long to have a long 
arc of dots streaming across the 
piece of paper.
 5. When you have enough marks to 
form an arc, draw an arrow that 
goes from your shadow stick to 
the closest part of the shadow 
line.
 
 This line is true north.
You navigate with your sun compass 
by holding it to the sun and rotating it 
until the shadow falls on the current 
time of day. Your arrow will then point 

 Chapter 10: Looking Up to the Skies: Celestial Navigation 173
to true north. As the day progresses 
and you’re moving across the land, 
you just keep rotating the compass to 
keep the shadow on the current time. 
For example: If it’s 4 p.m., turn the 
sun compass until the shadow falls 
on the 4:00 mark. The north line you 
drew earlier is pointing to true north.
Consider your sun compass to be 
accurate for only a week. After seven 
days, you have to make another one 
(by then, hopefully, you’ll be out of 
the wilderness!). Also, try to use as 
many of the other techniques in this 
chapter as you can to constantly 
confirm your direction.
a
a
b
c
d
You can find direction in the Southern Hemisphere by using 
your wristwatch, but you have to modify the technique 
slightly. It’s still very easy, and it works every time. To do so, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Place a sheet of paper on the ground and stand up a 
twig on the paper so the twig casts a shadow on the 
paper.
 
2. Place your watch behind the twig so that the shadow 
falls directly over the 12.
 
 The twig’s shadow should draw a straight line right 
down the very center of your watch’s face, from 12 to 6.
 
3. Make your first mark at the midway point between 
the shadow and the watch’s hour hand.

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
174
 
 This mark represents due north. Look at Figure 10-2b.
 
 Your watch must be set to local time for this method 
to work. If you’re in the Southern Hemisphere and the 
country you’re in uses Daylight Saving Time (DST), 
then you need to compensate by subtracting one hour 
from the current time. For example, if it’s 4:00 p.m. 
DST, you want to determine the midpoint between 12 
and 3 on the watch to find north.
 
4. Take a straight edge and place it so you can make 
your second mark on the exact opposite side of the 
watch from your first mark.
 
 You can now draw your north-south line. Afterward, you 
can draw a perpendicular line to represent east and west.
Finding Direction with the Stars
When you’re in the wilderness and don’t have any tools to 
help you find your way, you can resort to what men and 
women have done for thousands of years: Just look up. You 
can rely on the stars to guide you to safety.
What follows in this section are the easiest methods in the 
world, and they’re a lot of fun to know. Don’t be surprised if 
you find yourself checking every night for your newfound 
beacons in the sky. Enjoy.
Looking for the North Star
You can count on the North Star, called Polaris, to be your 
most reliable signpost in the sky, because it’s the only heavenly 
body that never moves or sets. (Actually, it does move, but 
only a tiny bit — so little, in fact, that you’d need instruments 
to detect its movement.) After you find the North Star, you can 
easily determine the other directions: south, east, and west.
 
When you’re facing the North Star, west is on your left and 
east is on your right. If you want to travel west, for example, 
you simply turn to the left and keep your right shoulder 
oriented on the North Star as you walk. The North Star lies 
almost directly over the North Pole, so when you’re facing 
it, you’re facing true north, not magnetic north, which is the 
direction your compass points.

 Chapter 10: Looking Up to the Skies: Celestial Navigation 175
Before you can find the North Star, you have to find one of the 
constellations that lie on either side of it, the Big Dipper or 
Cassiopeia. These constellations point the way to the North 
Star and allow you to confirm that you have just the right 
pinpoint of light in the sky. The following methods work in 
any season for everyone in the Northern Hemisphere (see 
Figure 10-3):
 
✓ The Big Dipper (Ursa Major): The Big Dipper appears in 
the sky just as its name suggests: like an enormous ladle. 
You can find the North Star by following the pointer stars 
at the end of the bowl.
 
✓ Cassiopeia: This constellation looks like a huge W, 
although it usually appears tipped over on its side. 
Find the North Star by following the inside point of 
Cassiopeia.

Finding due south with 
the Southern Cross
If you’re anywhere near the equator or below it, you can see 
the Southern Cross and use it to find direction at night.
The Southern Cross appears in the sky just as advertised — 
like a cross — so locating it after nightfall is no problem. Just 
be sure you have the genuine article! Next to the Southern 
Cross lies a false cross (see Figure 10-4c). The only way to be 
sure you’ve found the right one is to locate the Pointer Stars, 

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
176
two bright stars near the Southern Cross’s base. You should 
think of the Southern Cross and the Pointers as parts of the 
same body.
You can find south with the Southern Cross; just remember 
that the Southern Cross doesn’t always sit directly over the 
South Pole. You find due south by using the Southern Cross 
and Pointers like a ruler. Just draw an imaginary line straight 
down the center of the Southern Cross (Figure 10-4b) and 
draw another imaginary line that cuts the space between the 
Pointers in half (Figure 10-4a); follow these two imaginary 
lines, and you get a point in space where the lines cross 
(Figure 10-4d). Directly below this point lies due south.

I
t’s not hard to picture the situation: You’ve been walking 
all day on a well-marked trail or in a seemingly familiar 
area, and now the sun is going down and suddenly nothing 
seems well-marked or familiar at all.
You can work your way out of this mess, but it’ll take time, 
a clear head, and a lot of patience. This chapter helps you 
traverse over trails and shows you the basics of traveling 
through the wilderness, including info on how to cross rivers 
and streams and what to do if you’re lost.
Understanding Trail Travel
You may be wondering how difficult traveling on trails can 
actually be. You’d be surprised, brave traveler. Any wilderness 
area you go into is in reality a maze — a labyrinth of trails, 
false trails, animal trails, and washes. To avoid meandering or 
even getting lost in the wild, check out the following practical 
tips for successfully traveling trails. (And see Chapter 9 for 
the basics on finding direction.)
 
Before you head out, let someone know where you’re going 
and when you plan to be back. If you don’t return as expected, 

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
178
that person can contact the authorities and help set the 
search-and-rescue teams in motion.
Knowing where you are
When traveling on a trail or doing some other activity in the 
wild, try to know your position as closely as you can, as often 
as you can. This deceptively simple principle can do more to 
keep you from getting lost than just about any other.
 
Leaving the trail to take a shortcut gets more people lost in 
the wilderness than just about anything else. Many times, 
leaving the trail and heading directly for a large landmark 
seems like a shorter route, but doing so is frequently the start 
of trouble. Without the help of the trail, even experienced 
wilderness people sometimes become disoriented.
Another practice that gets people lost is leaving the trail to 
walk down a slope, such as down to a creek. When you walk 
down from a trail, you lose sight of it. You can still see signs 
of it, but many times they can be misleading. If you do walk 
down slope from a trail, always turn around and look behind 
you to make sure you know the way back.
 
People usually get lost in the wilderness due to a momentary 
lapse in awareness — part-time navigation. Many times, people 
who are bird-watching, berry-picking, or hunting end up lost 
because they’re so concentrated on the task at hand that they 
only occasionally look up to see where they’re going. They 
frequently find what they were looking for, but then they 
realize that they’ve strayed into an unknown area.
Knowing where you’ve been
Finding your way back is more important than forging ahead. 
You can stay out of trouble almost indefinitely if you can 
remember how to get back to where you came from, such as 
the car, the river, or the trail.
 
Your greatest survival tool on the trail is the ability to stop, 
turn around, and look behind you. Always look behind you 
when you’re walking on any trail — even if you don’t expect to 
go back that way. People get lost in the wilderness every year 

 Chapter 11: Trekking Over Land 179
because they get on the trail and think only about moving 
ahead. When they turn around to go back, the trail doesn’t 
look the same — it has lots of turns they didn’t see and lots 
of landmarks they aren’t sure about. The following is a list of 
problem areas to keep an eye on. When encountering these 
points, examine the area well enough that you’d know it in the 
dark or in a driving rain.
 
✓ Trail junctions and intersections: Many times, a pathway 
joins the trail you’re walking on and you don’t realize it. 
When you come back down your trail, that seemingly 
harmless junction is going to be a fork — a fork you’ve 
never seen before. When you’re hiking, turn around and 
look at each junction from the direction you’d see it from 
if you were returning. Stop and make sure your mind 
absorbs each junction. Let it really sink in.
 
✓ Old trails, false trails, animal trails, and washes: Always 
watch for trail imitators and imposters. A single sudden 
rain can create a track in the land that looks just like the 
turnoff that takes you back to your car or the road, but it 
in fact takes you off to nowhere.
 
✓ Tunnels through foliage: These are especially bad 
because when you emerge from the tunnel after you’ve 
had no view for a long time, your sense of spatial 
relationship is distorted.
 
✓ Rivers, streams, lakes, landforms, and manmade 
structures: If you run into a landmark in the wilderness, 
keep in mind that it may have a twin — a nearby lookalike 
that can easily fool you in the rain or in the dark. Always 
look for distinguishing characteristics — shapes of rocks, 
strange trees, and so on.
 
✓ An area outside your normal stomping grounds: If you 
frequently hike in a particular area but then decide to 
push your boundaries a bit, look behind you as you leave 
familiar grounds.
 
✓ Your old stomping grounds: Remember that when you 
go back to your Uncle’s old farm, or when you take the 
trail to your favorite old swimming hole, the lay of the 
land may have changed.
In the next section, we show you various techniques you can 
use to find your way back should you become disoriented.

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
180
Getting Back on Course When 
You’re Disoriented
If you’re disoriented, stop. Plant yourself. Take a deep breath 
and settle your mind. You can almost always find your way 
out of the wilderness if you can calm yourself and work the 
problem thoroughly.
If that seems like simple advice, it’s not. More often than not, 
your instincts tell you to double your efforts, to try harder, to 
walk more — and to walk faster. But the harder you try, the 
less you think. The instinct to double your efforts only makes 
things worse. If you find yourself off course and disoriented, 
this section can help you get back on course.
 
Don’t backtrack unless you’re absolutely certain that you 
know where you came from. The most important thing to do 
when you’re disoriented is to find out where you are now. 
Sometimes backtracking just gets you more disoriented. If you 
do backtrack, establish a range and mark your trail. For more 
on these basic travel practices, see “Traveling in a straight 
line” and “Marking your trail,” later in this chapter.
Reviewing your calculations
If you’re using instruments to find your way and you’ve 
become disoriented, make sure you haven’t made an error in 
your calculations or measurements (for more on calculations, 
see Chapter 9):
 
✓ Make sure your map is oriented correctly. Incorrectly 
oriented maps get more people in trouble than just about 
anything else.
 
✓ Make sure you’re looking at the right map. Keep in mind 
that you may have walked off the map or that you may 
have been navigating all this time with the wrong map.
 
✓ Check the date of your map. Your map may be outdated 
and inaccurate — especially in the category of manmade 
features, which change all the time.
 
✓ Check your compass corrections. Many times, you have 
to correct for compass error, which is the source of so 

 Chapter 11: Trekking Over Land 181
many mistakes. Make sure your compass isn’t being 
affected by some metallic or magnetic influence.
 
✓ Make sure you’re calculating with the right units of 
measurement. Not all maps use the same units of 
measurement, and many maps offer the ability to 
measure distances in two or three different units — 
miles, kilometers, and so on. When using a GPS receiver, 
make sure it’s calibrated to the units of measurement on 
the map and to the datum setting (the frame of reference 
that matches the geographic features to map coordinates).
Using your senses to help 
you find your way
If you don’t have maps or instruments with you, or if you’ve 
examined them and you still can’t make heads or tails of 
where you are, you can reorient yourself by examining various 
clues around you.
Stop and observe
Taking a moment to stop and look around can be tough, and 
sitting still can be excruciating, but stopping to observe your 
surroundings and thinking through your earlier movements 
can get you back on the trail. Try the following:
 
✓ In your mind, go back to the last point where you were 
certain you knew where you were. Make a list of what 
you’ve seen and everywhere you could’ve gone wrong. 
If you can figure out where you had your lapse in 
awareness, you can probably get out of trouble.
 
✓ In your mind, try to replay your entire hike, from when 
you left your base to where you are now. What were 
the major features you passed? Did you cross a river or 
stream?
 
✓ Examine the features and landforms around you. Any 
two landforms can look the same if you only glance at 
them, so don’t assume that you’ve seen everything on 
the first glance. You usually can’t distinguish one creek 
bed or hill from another unless you spend a minute 
contemplating it. Many features appear different in 
different shades of light.

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
182
 
✓ Watch for sunlight in thinning forests or scrub. You 
may be next to a major trail or road that’s only 50 feet 
away. A major shaft of sunlight can indicate a break in 
the forest from a road or a trail.
Listen
Sitting in the quiet can be brutal, but it works. The only way to 
listen is to be still — really still. Hold your breath if you have 
to. Here are common sounds to listen for:
 
✓ River rapids, waterfalls, and surf: Water noises are 
among the very best. On some clear nights, it’s not 
uncommon to hear the surf crashing on a beach that’s 
miles away — even on the other side of hills.
 
✓ Highways and roads: One can hear the roar of cars from 
miles away, but hearing a single car takes a little work. 
Sometimes people mistake these sounds for water noise.
 
✓ Barking dogs: A steady, single bark usually denotes a 
domesticated dog. But remember that in most wilderness 
areas of the world, domesticated dogs aren’t the only 
types of canine.
 
✓ Slamming doors: This noise can be heard from a long 
distance, but you must be attuned to hearing it. This 
sound is especially prevalent in state and national parks.
 
✓ Laughter: You can frequently hear people sitting around 
a campfire from a long distance — if you’re listening for 
them.
Taking action when 
you’re disoriented
If you’ve become disoriented, your sole priority should be to 
figure out where you are — not to travel more. If you can’t 
establish your position on a map, do everything you can to 
understand your relative position — in other words, where 
you are in relation to some nearby landmark. At least you 
can establish a base, a single point you can work from. After 
you’ve established your base, mark that spot.
Plan on returning to your base after you’ve tried one or both 
of the following tricks:

 Chapter 11: Trekking Over Land 183
 
✓ Move to higher ground. Higher ground gives you the 
ability to see a lot of terrain and landmarks all at once — 
this alone can tell you where you are. Move to higher 
ground only if you know where higher ground is — and 
you’re positive you’ll be able to find your way back to 
your current position.
 
✓ Expand out in concentric circles. Do this slowly. 
Venture out nearby and look at the lay of the land around 
your position. Do this in very small increments, and 
return to base frequently. You may be able to pick up the 
trail again this way.
Before you move, make sure you’ll be able to get back to 
where are right now. Whether you move to higher ground or 
move outward in concentric circles, you need to mark your 
trail very prominently. Check out the later section “Marking 
your trail” for specific advice.
What to Do When You’re Lost
Whether you wandered off trail or your plane had an 
unplanned, not-so-gentle landing in the woods, it never hurts 
to admit it: You’re lost. In this section, we discuss staying put 
and waiting for rescue, and we tell you what to do if you make 
the risky decision to move when you’re lost.
Staying put so people 
can find you
If you’re monumentally lost, or if you have good reason to 
believe that someone is going to come looking for you, stay 
put. The following is a list of typical situations in which you 
need to stay where you are:
 
✓ You’re separated from your hiking or tour group.
 
✓ You’ve left word saying you’ll be back.
 
✓ You were involved in a crash or any other tragedy that 
typically mobilizes search-and-rescue services.
 
✓ You know that search-and-rescue services are already 
looking for you. Many times, hikers or victims call in a 

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
184
rescue and then move, which is the worst thing they can 
do. You only have to be a few feet away — only a few 
feet — to make yourself invisible to search-and-rescue 
services.
 
If you have reason to believe someone may come looking for 
you, your responsibility is to stay alive and healthy so you can 
signal them. (For more on signaling, check out Chapter 12.)
Even if your current situation is tough, try to do what you can 
to stay put. Here’s how to ward off the cold and make yourself 
more comfortable as you sit tight:
 
✓ Make a fire and stay the night. If you can get a fire going, 
you can turn the tables on the wilderness. For more on 
the fine art of starting a fire, see Chapter 5.
 
✓ Make a shelter. A small, tight-fitting, hovel-like shelter 
can do much to insulate you. Building a shelter when 
you know there’s a town nearby may seem crazy, but 
you need to fight hypothermia in any way you can. If you 
build a good shelter, you can get through the night — 
which is much better than wandering. For more on 
building your wilderness home, see Chapter 6.
 
 Anytime you build a shelter, you need to mark it; 
otherwise, you’re building camouflage! You can use 
brightly colored cloth or reflective metal, or you can 
break branches or stack rocks to mark your shelter.
Deciding to travel
When you’re lost, you may realize the only way you’re going 
to be rescued is to move. In this section, we tell you how to 
move systematically when you’re lost. In the next, we explain 
how to travel over open wilderness.
 
Traveling when lost may make you even more lost than you 
already are. Even worse, you may move out of the area where 
people are searching for you. Making the decision to travel 
when lost must be your last resort. Travel only if you must 
move because of safety reasons or you’ve logically concluded 
that no one is going to come looking for you.
Preparing to move
If you’re dead set on moving, take the following precautions:

 Chapter 11: Trekking Over Land 185
 
✓ Above all, make a plan. Take a bearing on something — 
a tree, a rock, anything; don’t just walk aimlessly. (For 
more on traveling with bearings, see “Traveling in a 
straight line,” later in this chapter.) If you’re leaving 
people behind, make a timetable and a schedule of 
contacts (if possible) and thoroughly discuss what the 
plan of action is.
 
✓ Make the necessary preparations. Carry water, make 
copies of maps, and carry as many tools as you can.
 
✓ Leave a message at your current location. Write down, 
specifically, the following information:
 
• Who you are
 
• What you’re doing
 
• The history of your situation
 
• What time you left
 
• Where you went
 
 Then display this note prominently. If someone comes 
looking for you, this information may be the only hope he 
or she has of locating you. If possible, periodically leave 
small notes that searchers may discover along the way.
 
✓ Leave bright markers behind you as you move. Do 
everything you can to help search-and-rescue units find 
you. If you don’t mark your trail, you complicate the 
process enormously.
Detecting signs of civilization
You can detect civilization by listening for sounds and looking 
for physical signs. For a list of some of these, check out the 
earlier section “Using your senses to help you find your way.” 
Here’s a list of ways to find civilization; always look for as 
many indicators as you can:
 
✓ A glow on the horizon: Cities and towns glow on the 
horizon. Even if a town isn’t nearby, look for the glow of 
large distribution complexes or trucking terminals in the 
countryside.
 
✓ Reflections off of low clouds: Anytime you have a low 
sky at night, especially if it’s dense, white, and overcast, 
you can see reflections from human-made light. Even a 
campfire reflects on the underside of an overcast sky.

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
186
 
✓ Smoke: You can see smoke from great distances. A single 
campfire gives off only a tiny black trickle, so scan the 
horizon slowly and carefully.
 
✓ Converging power lines or railroads: Power lines and 
railroads are especially useful for finding civilization if 
they seem to be converging.
 
 Never assume that your troubles are over if you have a 
road or power line in front of you. Many times, road and 
power lines go for miles and miles and lead you deeper 
into the wilderness.
 
✓ Frequent, low-flying aircraft: If you can see aircraft 
descending or ascending, especially if you see a series of 
aircraft moving in the same general direction, that may 
point to an airfield or airport.
 
✓ Noise: Keep your ears tuned for noises that indicate 
civilization, such as car or snowmobile engines, voices, 
industrial machinery, and so on.
 
✓ Squared land and fences: If you have a view of the area 
around you, look closely for squares or rectangles in the 
distance. These shapes are a dead giveaway for civilization.
 
✓ Smells of food or industry: Food smells and industry 
exhaust travel long distances. Many experienced 
navigators have followed their nose to safety.
Following water to civilization
You’ve probably heard the old adage that you can follow 
water to civilization, or perhaps you’ve heard that you should 
always work your way downstream. Nothing’s wrong with this 
advice, except that it’s not a guarantee. Sorry! You can follow 
a drainage to a creek and then a creek to a river and so on, 
but you may be traveling for a very, very long time before you 
hit people.
 
Don’t travel down the bottoms of steep canyons or river 
drainages — especially if you have no way to get out in a 
hurry. The water level can rise swiftly, even if it hasn’t been 
raining. We’ve been on rivers when, unknown to us, the 
floodgates of a nearby dam were suddenly opened. The water 
rose 10 feet in 20 minutes.

 Chapter 11: Trekking Over Land 187
Blazing Your Own Trail
If you’re in the wild and don’t have a trail to guide you, you 
may end up setting out across the open wilderness. This 
section gives some pointers you need to remember when 
traveling without a trail and explains what you need to do to 
orient yourself.
 
Be realistic when estimating your rate of travel off trail. Even 
if you’re tough, you can still probably travel only about 1 mile 
per hour in bad terrain. Many times, you go much slower. Just 
a small amount of underbrush and growth can slow you down 
to a crawl.
Understanding meandering
When you’re moving through territory without the use of 
trails, maybe for the first time, keep in mind the following 
unavoidable problems:
 
✓ Without anything to orient you, you tend to walk in a 
series of arcs or in an aimless fashion. Everybody, you 
included, tends to veer to one side. This has nothing to 
do whatsoever with being right-handed or left-handed; 
it has to do with the fact that one leg is always slightly 
longer (and usually stronger) than the other. (Didn’t 
Mother always say you were special?) This is true for 
everyone, and it causes a slow and constant turn unless 
your mind can orient itself and correct for it.
 
✓ You tend to make arbitrary turns when you reach obsta-
cles you’re unsure of. Many people take the path of least 
resistance, or they turn down the trail that appears more 
inviting, or they prefer to turn right or left, even though 
there’s no real navigational rationale for this turn. If you’re 
uncertain, take your time and think through your turns.
 
✓ You always tend to turn away from irritants. Irritants 
include heavy winds on one side of your face, burning 
sun, briars and thorns, and especially slopes. Whenever 
you walk on the side of a slope, you tend to want to walk 
either up it or down it (especially down).
Now that you know some ways you can get turned around, 
you’re ready to try to walk in a (somewhat) straight line.

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
188
Traveling in a straight line
 
To make a straight path, establish a bearing before you set 
out into the unknown. A bearing is simply an imaginary line 
you draw from your position to a prominent landmark or 
feature. Even if you can see only 50 feet in front of you, draw 
a bearing to a tree or a rock. This helps immensely because it 
cuts down on the meandering and wandering that can cause 
you to become disoriented. One of the best types of bearings 
is the type you make with a compass. (For more on compass 
bearings, check out Chapter 9.)
You can make an excellent bearing by establishing a range. 
A range is an imaginary line that you draw through any three 
landmarks that line up in a column. To make a range, you 
have two options:
 
✓ Connect three landmarks. Draw a straight line through 
three landmarks ahead of you, such as a bush, a rock, 
and a hill (as in Figure 11-1a). Then follow this straight 
line through a twisting and turning wilderness.
 
✓ Use a back bearing. A back bearing is simply a line that 
runs from an object behind you, through your body, 
and to an object in front of you. This gives you a range 
because it gives you three things you can line up in a 
column.

 Chapter 11: Trekking Over Land 189
Marking your trail
 
Whenever you’re working in uncharted territory with bearings 
and ranges, mark your trail. Marking your trail, or trailblazing, 
means leaving behind physical signs of your movement 
through the wild. Just keep in mind that marking the wilderness 
is something you do only if you’re truly lost. Marking your 
trail does the following:
 
✓ Gives you the ability to work your way back if you hit a 
dead end
 
✓ Allows you to turn around
 
✓ Prevents you from getting lost
 
✓ Helps you to maintain a straight line of travel because 
you can check your back bearing on the trail markers 
you’ve left behind
You can mark your trail with just about anything you want —
use piles of rocks (cairns), break tree limbs, or tie brightly 
colored or reflective material to branches. Just make sure 
your markers are visible from both sides of the tree or landmark, 
back and front, so you can see them when you look behind 
you and so search-and-rescue units can see them as they’re 
following you.
In dense jungle, forest, high underbrush, or bad conditions, 
you may need to shorten the distance between markers down 
to just 20 feet or less. Patience is the key in these situations. 
Trailblazing can seem tedious at times, but if you’re thorough, 
this method can save your life in low-visibility terrains.
 
If you’re lucky enough to be traveling with a group, you can 
blaze the trail by setting up a moving range, known as a file. 
Here’s how (refer to Figure 11-1b):
 
1. Send two people out in front of you.
 
 One is the aimer, and one is the trailblazer.
 
2. If you’re standing at the back of the line, use the 
aimer in the file to line up the trailblazer; then coach 
the two down the range using hand signals until 
they’re almost out of sight.

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
190
 
3. After the trailblazer has gone as far as you want him 
or her to go, the trailblazer sets a mark — blazes the 
trail — while the rest of the file moves forward.
Crossing Obstacles in the Wild
When you encounter obstacles in the wilderness, you should 
generally try to go around them rather than over or through 
them. All too often, survivors are injured or killed in falls or 
are swept away in streams and rivers. Sometimes, however, 
you have little choice. This section focuses on obstacles you 
may encounter and how to handle them. Before you attempt 
to climb or go through an obstacle, make sure you’ve 
established a bearing on a distinct landmark on the other 
side. For more on establishing a bearing, see “Traveling in a 
straight line,” earlier in this chapter.
Crossing rivers and streams
If you come up to a river or stream and crossing it is your only 
option, you need to take some precautions. You can either 
try to walk through the water or build a raft. This section 
covers these two choices. (For info on crossing frozen water 
obstacles, see Chapter 16.)
Wading across
The first step in walking across a river or stream is to choose 
a place to cross. From high ground or a safe tree, examine 
the river for possible crossings and look for a ford. A ford is 
a place where the river narrows or becomes shallow. Many 
times, a little exploration can really pay off. Fords aren’t 
necessarily obvious, and many times you can see them only 
when you’re close to them.
 
As you evaluate possible crossing places, think about where 
you’ll end up on the other side of the river. The best choice 
for a landing site is a sandy bank. Know that your landing 
site will be well downstream. The moment you start to move 
toward the opposite bank, the current will push you. Don’t 
fight this power; crossing at an angle is always best. Expect to 
cross a river at a 45° angle.

 Chapter 11: Trekking Over Land 191
 
If you have any type of plastic sheeting with you, take your 
clothes off and roll them into it, and then tie up the whole 
bundle with your belt or shoelaces. Then tie the bundle to 
your wrist and try to hold it above the water. If tied tightly, 
even the most improvised of packages can keep your 
clothes dry long enough for you to get across (and help 
you momentarily float should you lose your footing).
When crossing, you can use any one of the following techniques:
 
✓ Crossing solo with a pole: You can use a pole to help 
break the river’s current. Find a strong tree branch or 
other pole, about 3 to 4 inches (7.5 to 10 centimeters) in 
diameter and about 7 to 8 feet (2 to 2.5 meters) long, and 
dig it into the riverbed upstream from your body, as in 
Figure 11-2a. The pole disrupts the flow so you can walk 
at a 45° angle to a strong current. Drag the pole along the 
riverbed, moving it by small increments, and stay behind 
the break in the current.
 
✓ Crossing with a group and a pole: Use a strong pole that 
several people can hold onto. Have your group form a 
single column, lined up on the pole, as in Figure 11-2b. 
This column breaks the flow of water, making it easy 
for everyone to keep his or her feet. The lightest person 
should be the one farthest upstream.
 
✓ Crossing with a group and a loop of rope: Send the 
strongest person across first. That person should stay 
on the inside the loop of rope, with the other two people 
holding the rope on shore. The second person holds 
onto the rope as he or she crosses. The third person 
crosses on the inside of the loop, as the first person did. 
See Figure 11-2c.

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
192
 
You should avoid rapids, but if you find yourself in swift 
water, try to float on your back with your feet pointing 
downstream. Escaping rough water is possible as long as you 
keep your feet in front of you and your buttocks high. Your 
feet and hands may occasionally graze and bounce off the 
riverbed like shock absorbers — try to keep this to a minimum, 
because you want to avoid having underwater rocks or tree 
roots entrap one of your limbs, and you’re trying not to fight 
the current. Try to float smoothly until you can swim to one 
side of the river.
Building a raft to cross the water
You can make improvised rafts from one of three types of 
materials or a combination of all three. We list these raft-
building materials here, in order of their practicality:
 
✓ Empty containers: Anything that holds air can be 
tied together or put in a bag or tarp and tied up, as in 
Figure 11-3a.
 
✓ Logs and Styrofoam: Styrofoam is the best. Always test 
the floatability of wood — many types don’t float very 
well. Thick bamboo canes are ideal for building fast, 
lightweight rafts. You can tie logs or Styrofoam together 
with two pieces of rope and sit in it as in Figure 11-3c. 
You steer and propel this raft with your hands and feet 
(it doesn’t lend itself very well to paddles).
 
✓ Lots of logs or bamboo poles: With these materials, you 
can build a conventional raft using crossbeams, as in 
Figure 11-3b. Use a simple levering process to tighten the 
lines. Simply wrap the line around a pole a few times and 
then pry upward.
a
b
c
Figure 11-3: Your options for rafts to cross rivers and streams.
Here’s how to make a trapped-air raft with a plastic sheet 
(check out Figure 11-4):

 Chapter 11: Trekking Over Land 193
 
1. Pile 1.5 feet (0.5 meters) of brush, foliage, or plastic 
containers on top of a plastic sheet or tarp.
 
 Don’t use foliage that has thick branches for this, 
because they poke holes in the raft. If you’re using a 
poncho, tie the hood closed and lay the poncho down, 
hood up.
 
2. Tie together two sturdy poles or branches into an 
X and lay the X on top of your foliage; then pile 
another 1.5 feet of foliage on top of your X.
 
3. Wrap the edges of your plastic around the foliage 
and tie them in place using any cordage or vines you 
can find.
 
4. Place your wrapped foliage package on top of a 
second tarp or poncho, open side down.
 
5. Wrap the second tarp or poncho around the first and 
tie the whole package together.
 
 Place the entire raft in the water like it is, with the 
second poncho or tarp on the bottom. The tied part of 
the second poncho or tarp — the open side — should 
be face up.
Figure 11-4: Making a trapped-air raft to cross rivers and streams.

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
194
 
Improvised rafts are vulnerable to capsize and disintegration. 
To cut down on the problem of capsize, build your raft as 
wide as you can. Small rafts, or long thin ones, are unstable. 
The best design is a large raft in the form of a square or circle. 
To avoid having your raft fall apart, overbuild it. Use as much 
cordage as you can and tie your knots tightly. (For more on 
ropes and knots, see Chapter 14.)
Going over loose rock and sand
A gentle slope can be just as dangerous to you in the wild as 
a cliff. Many times, easy-looking hills have gravel and loose 
sand on them, and as soon as you begin to slide on this type 
of surface, you can’t stop. Before working your way up or 
down, take a moment to plan a route. If you really examine the 
terrain before you, you can usually see a possible pathway 
of ledges, pits, divots, holes, tufts of grass, flat spots you can 
step on — anything that may support your weight.
When going over loose rock and sand on a slope, you have 
two options:
 
✓ The kick-step: The kick-step is one of the most effective 
techniques you can use on loose rock or sand. To use 
this method, take a moment to aggressively kick or dig 
each foothold with your shoes. Make sure you have a 
good purchase on the land before you put your weight 
on the foot you’ve been kicking with.
 
✓ The heel kick-step: This method is excellent for descend-
ing a sandy slope. Facing outward, with your back to the 
hill, take your heel and drive it sharply into a pit or tuft of 
grass below you. Use your heel like a sharp edge — you 
want to drive your heel into the earth and form a step 
that can hold your weight. With a little practice, you can 
figure out which pits and imperfections in the surface 
lend themselves to this method.
 
 When using the heel kick-step to descend, keep your 
downward momentum to a minimum. Dig your heel in, 
and then stop. Then dig in again, and stop. After you get 
moving and your confidence in this method builds, your 
upper body often begins to take on mind of its own — 
and this leads to slipping and sliding, so take it slow.

Signaling for Rescue
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the ins and outs of signaling
▶ Choosing the right language
▶ Knowing some tools you can signal with
▶ Using radios and cellphones to signal
▶ Preparing for the arrival of a rescue helicopter
You can kick up quite a bit of commotion in the wild and 
still not be noticed. What seems obvious to you can be 
completely invisible to a potential rescuer. Understanding 
what people can actually see and hear — what really gets you 
noticed — is part of the art and skill of signaling.
In this chapter, we show you ways to get the attention of 
anybody who’s looking for you — and even those who aren’t. 
We show you how you can get attention, how to use a radio 
to make a Mayday distress call, and how to prepare for the 
arrival of help from the skies.
Grasping the Basics to Signaling
When you’re in the wild and need someone to find you, 
you send out a signal — basically anything that can get you 
noticed. A good signal is one that not only gets the attention 
of search-and-rescue units but also gets the attention of those 
who are not looking for you, too — people or passersby who 
may be able to help you long before the professionals arrive. 
This section helps you establish a firm signaling foundation so 
you’re easier to find.

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
196
Picking a good location
If you’re in a situation where you have to begin signaling, take 
a moment to consider doing it in a place that gives you the 
maximum visibility. Prime real estate for good signaling is 
usually
 
✓ The highest elevation you can safely get to
 
✓ A spot that can be seen from all sides; ideally, you want 
to have 360º visibility
 
✓ An expanse with few natural objects that would distract 
rescuers; for instance, an open field with no large boulders
 
✓ A wide opening, free from tree lines or cliffs; the wider 
the opening, the better
 
If you can’t stay at your signaling spot, leave behind a signal 
pointing to where you are. Large, well-contrasted, and angled 
arrows make excellent signals. For more on these types of 
signals, see “Mastering the Language of Signaling,” later in this 
chapter.
Making your signal stand out
The basic philosophy of signaling is bigger, brighter, different. 
These three ideas encapsulate the entire spectrum of signaling. 
Anytime you can do something bigger, brighter, or different — 
especially in conspicuous spot — you’re improving your 
chances of being found. This section explains how you can 
make your signals bigger, brighter, and different.
Bigger
Bigger means anything that makes you, or your signal, larger. 
A human being is actually a very small thing on this Earth, 
so whenever you can be a part of something larger, you’re 
making yourself more visible.
 
If you’ve been in an accident, stay with your downed aircraft 
or near the debris field of your damaged or capsized vessel. 
Debris fields represent a much larger position marker than 
your body — and search-and-rescue units look for them 
specifically.

 Chapter 12: Signaling for Rescue 197
If you’re in a group, stay together and form a symbol. If you’re 
in the water, link arms with others in your group.
Brighter
Brighter means a more intense signal. Brighter can mean more 
light at night, such as more fire or more flares, but it can also 
mean using the brightest colors you can get your hands on. 
Here are some ways to make your signal brighter:
 
✓ Make more than one fire, or make a larger fire.
 
✓ Put reflectors near anything that puts out light.
 
✓ Use any types of colored objects, such as clothing, for 
your signals. If your undershirt is brighter than your 
outerwear, consider putting the undershirt on over 
the outerwear.
 
✓ If you have brightly colored objects that you can lie out 
on the ground or sea ice, do so. Anything that contrasts 
with the earth’s tones can stand out.
Different
Different can mean almost anything that contrasts with its 
surroundings or that appears wrong or out of place. 
Whenever you make something stand out, such as when you 
fly the flag upside down or leave the hood up on your car, 
you’re signaling.
 
Nature’s lines are curvy and messy, so any line you can make 
that’s straight and clean is good for signaling. Your best signals 
are right angles and hard angles — these can be seen in the 
wilderness from great distances.
Being persistent
Unfortunately, getting someone’s attention may take a while. 
Don’t expect to be seen easily or on the first try. You should 
always be prepared to send out multiple, repetitive signals.
It’s common for search-and-rescue units or people going 
about their business to pass right by someone who’s signaling 
frantically. Many times, airplanes or ships change course and 
only appear to be heading your way. This can be frustrating in 
the extreme and demoralizing. Continue to signal until you’re 
certain they’re coming for you.

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
198
Mastering the Language 
of Signaling
You can always simply shout, “Help!” but in survival situations, 
you often want to send a message that lasts longer, goes 
farther, or describes more. A distinct group of words and 
symbols comprising the language of signaling, known as 
distress signals, can increase your odds of being rescued. 
These internationally recognized symbols mean only one 
thing: Someone is in peril.
This section takes a closer look at the language of signaling, 
whether you’re writing, speaking, moving dirt, or sending out 
sounds or flashes of light. Read on for the basic symbols and 
words you can use if you need help.
Using three of anything to 
show something’s up
Anytime you use three of any type of signal, you’re sending 
out a strong, universally recognized message. Three loud 
noises, three bright flashes, three fires built in a triangle — all 
of these are recognized as distress signals, and they fall into 
our criteria of “bigger, brighter, and different.” (See the earlier 
section “Making your signal stand out.”)
You can use three of anything if you don’t know any other 
types of signals, or you can communicate in more specific 
terms, such as SOS or Mayday. These are a little bit more 
complex, but they’re very powerful — check out the next 
section.
SOS and Mayday: Calling 
for urgent help
You can use SOS or Mayday anytime, anywhere — you don’t 
have to be on the water or in the air, and you don’t have to be 
an official, like a ship’s captain, to use them.

 Chapter 12: Signaling for Rescue 199
 
Use SOS or Mayday only when you’re in grave danger and 
need immediate assistance. These are not the signals to send 
if you’re just tired and want to go home! SOS and Mayday are 
the biggest, most serious signals you can send.
Spelling or sounding out your SOS
SOS is a traditional distress signal for ships in peril. Over the 
years, so many people in different situations have used it 
that SOS now simply means help. You can use the universal 
distress signal of SOS anytime and anywhere you’re in peril.
Your SOS can be a visual or audio signal, and you can use 
either the letters themselves or Morse code. For instance, 
you can spell out SOS on the ground using large tree limbs or 
other objects. At night, you can use Morse code flashes from 
a flashlight. And when you’re using a radio or cellphone, you 
can say “S-O-S,” send it as a text, or use a sound or tone to 
spell SOS in Morse code.
Tapping into Morse code
When all else fails, beeps or tones 
can still be heard — even when 
there’s heavy static and your batteries 
are virtually dead! Most people 
know how to sound out SOS in 
Morse code. After all, it’s just three 
shorts, three longs, and three shorts. 
But if you need to tell someone your 
position or medical condition, you 
need to know more.
Below is the alphabet in Morse 
code and the digits from 0 to 9. If 
you can establish contact with a 
radio operator, you can slowly and 
carefully say anything you need to 
say using the code. Thousands of 
radio operators all over the world 
understand this code, and if you send 
it to them slowly, they’ll respond, in 
kind, slowly.

Try Morse code on your radio if your batteries are running 
low, you have poor reception, or there’s a lot of static. Radio 
operators can frequently hear sharp, piercing beeping sounds 
through heavy static when no other signals can be heard. 
These sounds are unlike the sound your voice makes over 
the radio, and because of that, they’re rarely mistaken or 
confused for something else. (For more on using a radio, see 
“Sending a distress call over the radio,” later in this chapter.)
 
Anybody can spell SOS in Morse code. It’s just nine signals: 
Three short signals, three long ones, and three short again. In 
Morse code, SOS looks like this:
 
 
. . . - - - . . .
That’s it! If you want to know numbers and the rest of the 
alphabet, check out the nearby sidebar titled “Tapping into 
Morse code.”
Calling Mayday
The most common radio distress signal is Mayday, which is the 
international code word for serious emergencies. Mayday comes 
from the French phrase m’aidez, which means “help me.”
You can spell Mayday on the ground or on the roof of downed 
aircraft or shelters, but its most common use is as a radio 
signal. For more on how to use Mayday over the radio, go to 
“Sending a distress call over the radio,” later in this chapter.
Sea stuff: Saying Pan-Pan when 
you’re not in immediate danger
Pan is the international code word you use when your situ-
ation is serious but not life-threatening. Pan is usually used 
only on the sea, but it can be helpful in international areas 
where you don’t speak the local language, because most mili-
taries understand it.
Use Pan if you want to send a signal saying your situation is 
serious but not immediately life-threatening. Generally speak-
ing, Pan is spoken twice, three times in a row. It’s pronounced 
so that it rhymes with swan: “Pahn-Pahn, Pahn-Pahn, Pahn-
Pahn.”

 Chapter 12: Signaling for Rescue 201
Using ground-to-air emergency 
code (patterns)
Large symbols that you make on the ground around you are 
referred to as ground-to-air emergency code, or simply patterns. 
Generally speaking, you make these patterns using debris, 
colored items, branches, and rocks. Or you can build up 
mounds of earth — just make sure your patterns are big.
Here are the main messages you may need and the basic 
patterns:
 
✓ Require assistance: V
 
✓ Require medical assistance: X
 
✓ Proceed in this direction: ↑
 
Make the lines of your pattern signals six times longer than 
their width. When you draw your V, for example, the lines 
should be 3 feet wide but 18 feet long. If you can make each 
line 4 feet wide, then make the lines 24 feet long. This 6-to-1 
ratio makes your signal really stand out from the air. (Check 
out the Cheat Sheet at the beginning of this book to see what 
these symbols look like in the proper proportions.)
Using your body to signal
You can communicate with low-flying aircraft and ground 
units on nearby hills by standing still and forming signals 
with your arms and body position. Depending on your 
situation, you basically have four body signals to make in 
times of distress. They mean the following:
 
✓ Need help, or pick us up: Raise both arms into the 
air, similar to signaling a touchdown in football (see 
Figure 12-1a). Just make sure you turn your palms 
forward.
 
 Don’t wave at aircraft with one hand if you’re in trouble. 
Waving with one hand means that you don’t need 
assistance. If you’re in peril, you must put both hands in 
the air.

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
202
 
✓ Land here: Crouch down and hold your arms straight 
out, parallel to the ground (Figure 12-1b). Make sure 
you’re pointing toward the specific area where you want 
the aircraft to land.
 
✓ Don’t attempt to land here: This is vigorous waving 
motion you use to prevent an aircraft from landing in a 
hazardous area (Figure 12-1c).
 
✓ Urgently need medical assistance. Lie on your back with 
your arms straight overhead and your legs extended 
(Figure 12-1d).
 
You can enhance any of these signals by standing still, with 
your feet together. When you take that stance, you leave no 
doubt that you are signaling — not just waving.

Mastering Signaling Tools
The more creative your tools, the better your chances of being 
rescued. However, some tools are much better than others, and 
these are bound to catch the eyes of searchers. In this section, we 
take a look at basic tools that have proven very effective in saving 
the lives of survivors. (For info on radios and other electronic 
devices, see “Signaling with Electronics,” later in this chapter.)
Noisemakers and horns
You can use anything to make audio signals — just try to make 
your signals unusual. Repeated patterns are the best type of audio 
signals, and distinct patterns of three sound blasts are usually 
recognized as distress signals. Here are some good noisemakers:

 Chapter 12: Signaling for Rescue 203
 
✓ Whistles of all types
 
✓ Aerosol-propelled noisemakers, like the type used at 
sporting events
 
✓ Gunshots
 
✓ A steel pot or a metal wing or any other large or hollow 
piece of metal you can beat on
 
Almost any noisemaker we list here is better than the human 
voice. You can obviously shout anytime you want, just keep in 
mind that the human voice isn’t nearly as piercing.
Mirrors and other reflectors
A mirror or other reflector can sometimes be seen from 50 
miles (80 kilometers) away in normal conditions. If you have 
access to a survival kit, look inside for a signal mirror. If you 
don’t have that luxury, practically anything shiny will work. 
Here’s a list of good reflective materials:
 
✓ Mirrors in cosmetic cases
 
✓ CDs, DVDs, or computer discs of any kind (these are 
very good)
 
✓ Any piece of glass (a dark backing, like mud smeared on 
the back, can sometimes increase its reflecting ability)
 
✓ Plastic space blankets
 
✓ Glossy book covers
 
✓ Polished metal lids
 
✓ A split log with water splashed on (the exposed white 
wood inside shines when it’s soaked)
 
✓ Flashes on cameras
 
✓ Belt buckles or buckles on purses
 
✓ Plastic wrap stretched over a pot
 
If you signal with a mirror or some other reflective device, you 
need to aim your signal carefully. A simple way to aim is to put 
your hand out before you, line up the mirror so it reflects light 
on your hand, and then quickly remove your hand. Or you can 
send an adequate signal by simply moving the mirror back and 
forth in a tight pattern. Practice before the rescuers get to 

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
204
you — it’s harder than it looks! Check out the Cheat Sheet at 
front of this book to see how to aim your signal mirror.
 
Even if you can’t actually see someone to signal to, continually 
sweeping the horizon with your mirror or other reflector is a 
good idea.
Fire
You can use fire anytime as a signaling tool, day or night. 
However, keep in mind that other fires may be nearby, so 
yours must be bigger, brighter, or different. In the case of fire, 
it’s almost always best to be different. You can make yours 
different the following ways, alone or in combination:
 
✓ Three fires in a triangle: Pilots and search-and-rescue 
units universally recognize this signal, and it’s the very 
best use of fire as a signal. Try to space these fires at 
least 75 feet apart.
 
✓ Three fires in a line: This type of signal isn’t as good as 
fires in a triangle, but if your surroundings hamper you, 
three in a row works. Again, try to space these fires at 
least 75 feet apart.
 
✓ A fire that flares up sharply: Use this technique if you’re 
able to make your fire flare up when ground units or 
low-flying aircraft are nearby. Oil, gas, or any other 
petroleum products are good for this, but you can also 
use paper, leaves, or grass.
 
✓ Large bonfires: This option is okay if you have no other; 
just remember that if another large fire is nearby, your 
fire may not be distinctive enough. Also keep in mind 
that big fires can quickly get out of control and start 
forest fires, which can put you in more peril.
For more on starting fires, check out Chapter 5. And for tips 
on escaping a forest fire, flip to Chapter 24.
Smoke
Smoke is another signaling tool you can use, but make sure 
you understand that it’s very similar to fire (see the preceding 
section): If you want to use smoke, you have to distinguish it 
from normal smoke, which can come from any fire anywhere.

 Chapter 12: Signaling for Rescue 205
The international signal for distress is three columns of smoke. 
However, simply producing an abundance of smoke that 
contrasts with your environment can frequently do the trick. 
You can create contrast and abundance in one of two ways:
 
✓ Black smoke: This is your best bet in snowy conditions or 
when you have overcast skies. Only certain materials can 
produce large amounts of black smoke, so if these materi-
als are in short supply, you may want to consider building 
a large fire of other materials and hold your black-smoke 
producers in reserve. You can then throw these items on 
the fire when searchers are in your vicinity. Thick, black 
smoke immediately comes from any of the following:
 
• Engine oil, vegetable oil, animal oils, and fats
 
• Rags soaked in oil
 
• Rubber or rubbery products, like tires
 
• Plastic
 
✓ White smoke: White smoke is very effective in green 
forest environments. You can create a sudden surge of 
white smoke by starting a fire and then partially smother-
ing it. Use any of the following materials for the partial 
smothering that produces white smoke:
 
• Green leaves or grass, or wet leaves or grass
 
• Moss
 
• Green branches
 
• A small amount of water or wet clothes
The torch: Setting an evergreen afire
If you’re in the wild and need to signal 
rescuers, then lighting an evergreen 
tree on fire — creating an evergreen 
torch — is an option. To make an 
evergreen torch, cut down an entire 
evergreen tree or bush, carry it to a 
large clearing, and pile tinder and 
kindling in its lower branches. Then 
light the tinder. Though green, these 
trees will ignite. The tree’s resin, or 
pitch, burns black, and it produces 
an enormous plume of smoke.
Warning: The risk with the evergreen 
torch is that it can start a forest fire, 
so be careful. Do not perform this is 
in dense forest.

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
206
Pitch, sap, or resin — or wood that contains it — can make 
either white or black smoke, so you have to experiment.
 
Smoke isn’t very effective in windy conditions. If it’s windy, 
consider some other type of signal and save your materials 
for making colored smoke for when conditions are calmer.
Shadows
You can use shadows to make contrasting patterns that are 
visible from the air in sunny conditions. Remember that 
sharp, hard angles get you noticed, especially when using 
shadow. Always use the standard 6-to-1 ratio when making 
any pattern. (For more on the 6-to-1 ratio in pattern-making, 
see “Using ground-to-air emergency code [patterns],” earlier 
in this chapter.)
Here are some methods you can use to make patterns with 
shadow:
 
✓ Build up mounds of earth. This is useful in desert 
conditions, but the mounds must be substantial. To make 
this signal stand out, pile up sand or dirt at least 1 foot, 
preferably more. Keep in mind that what looks obvious 
to you isn’t obvious to others.
 
✓ Tramp down snow. You can make visible ground-to-air 
signals with this method; just be meticulous in making 
your angles and contrasts distinct. In large, flat fields of 
snow, this kind of signal has to be very sharp and very 
large. It’s not optimal in overcast conditions or gray light.
 
✓ Make piles of branches, foliage, and rocks. To make this 
type of signal, you have to be really elaborate. Don’t take 
any chances. This type of signal has to be very large, and 
the edges must be very well defined.
Dye markers and other color
If you’re lucky enough to have a survival kit handy, check 
whether it contains a dye marker. These signaling devices 
usually look like bulging little packets of tightly packed sand, 
and they contain about 2 pounds (0.9 kilograms) of food 

 Chapter 12: Signaling for Rescue 207
coloring. You usually use this type of signal to mark your 
position in water. When you open the package, the coloring 
agent turns the water around you a bright yellow or sometimes 
yellow-orange.
If you don’t have a dye marker, you should still try splashing 
as much color around as you can. Essentially, you want to 
use a color that delivers the maximum contrast against your 
surroundings. Opt for primary colors:
 
✓ Yellow: Superb in all conditions except snow
 
✓ Royal blue: Very good as well, even sometimes in green 
forested environments
 
✓ Red: Works well on snow or ice
If it’s snowy out, you can simply turn over the snow and 
expose the sod underneath. This makes a good signal because 
the dark earth contrasts so well against the white snow. You 
can use charcoal from fire on snow as well.
 
A good way to signal is to take a bright piece of cloth, tie it 
to the end of a tree branch, and then wave it vigorously over 
your head. This is very effective because it gives you motion 
in addition to color.
Leaving directional signals
You can use branches, foliage, 
and rocks to mark your trail or lead 
searchers to your position. The trick 
is to be obvious. If you break several 
branches all in the same direction, 
search-and-rescue units, especially 
the experienced ones, will pick up on 
the message you’re trying to send.
You can also use rocks to make 
cairns. A cairn is simply a pile of 
stones built up in a pyramid shape 
to mark a trail or direction of travel. 
The top stone should be an oblong 
rock that points in your direction of 
travel.
People frequently use cairns to leave 
messages for rescuers (such as 
number in the party, medical condi-
tion, equipment condition, available 
food and water, and so on). Simply 
write messages on paper and put 
them into a weatherproof container, 
such as a zipper-lock bag; then leave 
them near the cairn’s top stone.

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
208
Aerial flares
You can use aerial flares in the daytime or at night. If you 
decide to use flares, take extraordinary precautions when 
using them. Don’t fire flares at random — fire only when you 
feel reasonably sure someone can see them.
Aerial flares usually come in one of two types:
 
✓ Pistol-fired flares: These types of flares usually fly only a 
few hundred feet and burn only for a few seconds.
 
✓ Parachute-type flares, or rockets: These flares are 
usually housed in their own cylinders and are sometimes 
labeled as rockets. They can fly to 1,000 feet (305 meters) 
or more, and they usually burn up to a minute.
 
If there’s a breeze, fire your flare just downwind of vertical. 
Shoot it at about a 75º angle so it adequately marks your real 
position without letting the flare come back to land on your 
vessel.
 
Aerial flares are basically firearms, and they have the ability 
to kill people and set survival craft on fire. Old fashioned 
hand-flares, like the cardboard type found in car trunks 
and highway emergency kits, have the tendency to drip 
pyrotechnics. These flares must be ignited well away from the 
body and should never come near anything flammable or near 
any important piece of gear made of plastic. These types of 
flares can sink an inflatable raft in the blink of an eye.
Flashlights and electronic lights
Use a flashlight so it leaves no doubt that you’re sending a 
distress signal. You can use SOS or any other distinctive 
pattern, like three flashes, or you can tape the flashlight to 
the end of branch and wave it overhead. This gives the light 
a wide range of motion and makes you bigger, brighter, and 
different.
 
If three flashlights are available, have three people stand as 
if on the three corners of a triangle and flash in unison. 
This eye-catching display is clearly different from your 
surroundings.

 Chapter 12: Signaling for Rescue 209
 
Recently, pilots equipped with night-vision goggles were able 
to detect the light from a survivor’s electronic device — his 
PDA. If you hear an aircraft coming toward you at night, 
consider moving to a clearing and turning a cellphone or PDA 
on so that the face lights up. If the pilots have night vision 
goggles, they can see this from a great distance.
Upside-down flags and other 
things out of place
You can simply put something where it doesn’t belong to get 
attention (it always got the attention of your mom, right?). For 
example, you can turn a flag upside down and run it up the 
pole, you can raise the hood of your car, or you can place a 
large piece of debris in a clearing.
Signaling with Electronics
Electronics can give you peace of mind in the wilderness, as 
long as you understand their limitations. Electronic devices 
and beacons have gone through several changes over the 
years, so whenever you’re preparing to take them with you 
into the wild, make sure that your equipment is up-to-date and 
that the frequencies and procedures you’ve used in the past 
are still valid. This section delves into the many ways you can 
use electronics to make contact with potential rescuers.
 
If you rely on electronics, you’re relying on batteries. Try to 
keep your electronics turned off until you know you need them. 
Keep your batteries warm and dry. Excessive cold or heat 
greatly reduces battery life, as does the exposure to corrosives 
like transmission fluid or brake line fluid (in air crashes and car 
wrecks) and salt water (in shipwrecks). In extreme cold condi-
tions, place your batteries in a soft pouch with a strap so you 
can secure the pouch inside your clothing under your armpit or 
on your belly. This keeps them warm and increases battery life.
Radioing for help
Even in this era of satellite phones, there’s nothing like having 
a good radio around. Many times, the folks who hear your 

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
210
transmission are amateur radio operators and ship captains, 
and they’re great allies when you’re in trouble.
Tuning your radio into a distress frequency
In a survival situation, you can use any radio transmitter you 
have access to, and you can tune it to any frequency to call for 
help. The law gives you unlimited access to radios and their 
frequencies when in need of rescue. However, you’re much 
more likely to get a quick response if you send your distress 
signal on a distress frequency. Here’s a list of the radios you’re 
likely to run into and their respective distress frequencies:
 
✓ VHF Radio: Channel 16. VHF radios are those radios 
you usually see on boats and other vehicles. They 
tend to be mounted on the overhead dash, with the 
microphone hanging on a hook at the unit’s side. 
You can expect these radios to have a range of 25 to 40 
miles (40 to 64 kilometers) if you’re near a U.S. port or 
a U.S. Coast Guard installation and about a 10-mile 
(16-kilometer) range when transmitting to other boats on 
the sea. On land, the radio’s range is dictated by hills and 
other obstacles that the radio can’t transmit through. 
You may have a range of 40 miles or less than 1 mile.
 
 Generally, all distress signals on VHF are sent out on 
Channel 16. If you receive no response, try Channel 13, 
especially if you have a large vessel in your line-of-sight 
or if you find yourself in a shipping lane or near the 
inbound or outbound lanes near a large port. In some 
cases, large vessels are legally required to monitor 13.
 
✓ CB Radio: Channel 9. These are radios used by many 
long-haul truckers. These are short range, usually less 
than a few miles.
 
✓ Family Radio Service (FRS) UHF: Channel 1. These are 
handheld units that make up a burgeoning radio network 
that’s becoming popular in the U.S. They have a very 
short range, usually less than a few miles.
 
✓ Single-sideband: 2,182 kHz. These are long-range 
maritime radios, and they’re only on the better-equipped 
boats. These radios are usually used for long-range 
communications, between 75 and 300 miles (120 and 480 
kilometers), so they may send a signal that overshoots a 
nearby station.

 Chapter 12: Signaling for Rescue 211
 
✓ Shortwave (ham) radios: 2,182 kHz. These radios can 
transmit hundreds of miles, or sometimes, all over the 
globe. When using shortwave radios, you can try calling 
on 14.300 MHz or 14.313 MHz. These are the Maritime 
Networks for ham radio operators, and they’re run by 
people who will help you anytime you call.
 
 If you don’t have a ham radio on your own boat, you may 
be able to contact people who have a shortwave radio on 
theirs, and they can perform a relay for you. Generally, 
the people who operate these types of radios are the 
most well-trained and experienced radio operators in the 
world. Distress signals sent on these radios get a very 
quick response.
 
✓ Airband Radios: 121.5 MHz and 243.0 MHz. These 
are radios found in aircraft. Military personnel and 
volunteers monitor these frequencies.
Getting a clear signal
Whenever you use a radio, keep in mind that transmitting a 
clear signal requires a few physical actions:
 
✓ Try to find high ground or an area where obstacles won’t 
impede your radio signal. Most radio transmitters are 
limited in range to line of sight, which means they can’t 
send a signal around obstacles or over the horizon. Try 
to elevate the antenna as much as you can. If you’re 
using a handheld VHF unit, just standing up in the boat 
helps.
 
✓ Make sure you know what kind of microphone the radio 
has: push-to-talk or voice-activated.
 
✓ Switch to the correct frequency (see the preceding section).
 
✓ Have your info ready before you send your signal.
 
✓ Try to keep your radio’s antenna perpendicular to your 
intended receiver.
 
 If you have nothing in sight, try keeping the antenna at 
a right angle to the ground. Why? Because the antenna 
doesn’t send out energy in an even fashion; it sends out 
its signal in the shape of a lobe, which is a slightly 
flattened bubble. Check out Figure 12-2 to get an idea 
of the type of lobe a radio antenna develops.

Sending a distress call over the radio
When you send a distress call over a radio, you take a bold 
step. This type of signal is exceedingly potent, and it sets 
search-and-rescue units, volunteers, nearby ships, and law 
enforcement agencies in motion. If you’re satisfied that your 
situation is indeed grave, follow these directions:
 
1. Hold the microphone 4 inches (10 centimeters) away 
from your mouth and speak slowly and distinctly.
 
 Don’t kiss the mic. The closer your mouth is to the 
microphone, the more distorted your voice will sound 
on the other end of the transmission. Give the mic 
some space.
 
2. Call, “Mayday, Mayday, Mayday.”
 
3. Say, “This is . . .” and then say the name of your 
boat or aircraft three times, or just say your name if 
you’re not aboard a vessel.
 
4. Immediately give your position.
 
 If you don’t know exactly where you are, say that 
you’re giving an approximate position and then 
estimate how far you are from a prominent landmark 
and in what direction.
 
5. Give the nature of your emergency.
 
 For example, “My boat has been swamped and is sinking.”

 Chapter 12: Signaling for Rescue 213
 
6. Give the number of people in your party.
 
7. Give a very short description of your vessel, aircraft, 
or automobile.
 
8. Say, “Over,” and then listen.
 
 Try to be patient and wait for a response. Sometimes 
it takes a few moments.
 
The more calmly and clearly you can talk on the radio, the 
better. You must say “over” every time you transmit, or the 
other radio operators won’t know you’re finished transmit-
ting; they’ll wait, which wastes precious time.
 
If you know your radio signal is weak for some reason, send 
SOS via Morse code (nine tones or beeps: three short, three 
long, and three short). On many radios, the button to make 
beeps or tones is labeled Key or sometimes CW or Tone. (For 
more on SOS, check out “SOS and Mayday: Calling for urgent 
help,” earlier in this chapter.)
Using cell and sat phones
Cellphones function just like handheld radios. They can send 
and receive voice and text transmissions only when they’re 
in a line of sight with a transmission tower — in other words, 
they can’t send signals around obstacles like hills or mountains 
or canyon walls.
 
If you find yourself in a survival situation and you have cell-
phone reception, dialing 911 is generally best. Even if you 
haven’t paid your phone bill, the system will take this kind of 
call. (We list emergency numbers for various countries at the 
front of the book on the Cheat Sheet.) And if you don’t know 
your position, sometimes dialing 911 is enough: With the new 
Enhanced 911, the emergency system receives your exact 
location whenever you dial 911. This system is replacing the 
old 911, but it’s not countrywide in the United States yet.
 
If you have no cellphone reception, you have a few options:
 
✓ If you’re moving and your phone is fully charged or 
nearly so, send a distress text to someone who checks 
his or her messages. After you’ve sent this text, your 
cellphone continuously tries to get through to a tower for 

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
214
as long as the phone is turned on. If you’re walking, you 
may briefly pass through an area that — unknown to 
you — is in line-of-sight with a distant tower, at which 
time the phone will automatically send the message. This 
can happen virtually anytime, anywhere.
 
✓ If you’re moving and the phone doesn’t have much 
charge, text only at the most advantageous spots — like 
on the tops of tall hills or areas with wide visibility. 
After you’ve texted, turn the phone off, at least for a 
while, to conserve batteries.
 
✓ If you’re not moving, have no reception, and are low on 
battery power, shut off the phone. Conserve your power 
and think of a plan.
Satellite phones are becoming more and more popular each 
year. Despite their popularity, they’re like any other electronic 
device in that they’re limited by their battery’s life. They 
also have trouble getting reception when you’re in a spot 
that doesn’t have a clear view of the sky overhead. Keep in 
mind that sat phone technology is still somewhat embryonic. 
During times of large-scale calamity, like during tsunamis 
or hurricanes, sat phone networks can be overwhelmed by 
surges in traffic. However, if you’re going on a serious trip 
where there’s no cellphone coverage, you should look into 
taking a sat phone with you.
Using radio beacons: EPIRBs, 
ELTs, and PLBs
Radio beacons may look like small, handheld radios, but you 
don’t speak into them. When you activate a radio beacon, it 
simply transmits a distress signal with your exact position to 
a low-orbiting satellite, which then relays this info to national 
search-and-rescue units. You register radio beacons so that 
at the beacon’s activation, search-and-rescue services receive 
info specifically about you (and your vessel) that could save 
your life. Here are some of the beacons available:
 
✓ Emergency position-indicating radio beacon (EPIRB): 
This is a small radio beacon used for ships at sea. EPIRBs 
are usually yellow in color and have a simple activating 
mechanism that requires you to pull a small cord.

 Chapter 12: Signaling for Rescue 215
 
 EPIRBs must continuously transmit to be successful; in 
other words, just pulling the cord and sending a single 
signal may not be enough. After you’ve activated your 
EPIRB, try to keep it in a position that has a 360º access 
to the sky so the EPIRB can continue to signal its satellites.
 
✓ Emergency locator transmitter (ELT): This is similar to 
an EPIRB, but it’s standard-issue for all aircraft, and most 
people never come into contact with one. It’s activated 
on impact.
 
✓ Personal locator beacon (PLB): This is a personal, 
land-based equivalent of an EPIRB that’s usually very 
small and portable. It’s for terrestrial applications, such 
as backcountry hiking. Although PLBs are meant to be 
carried by a specific person, you can find them in small 
aircraft and sometimes on boats. Some outfitters now 
rent these units to hikers headed into backcountry.
 
In the past, EPIRBs, ELTs, and PLBs transmitted on a 121.5 
MHz frequency, but in February 2009, those types of units 
became officially obsolete.
 
If you buy a 406 MHz radio beacon, you must register it with 
the NOAA or your country’s search-and-rescue authorities.
Getting a Lift: What to Do When 
the Helicopter Comes
If you have reason to believe that you may be rescued by 
helicopter, take precautions to ensure your safety. Helicopters 
can indeed hover and lower a basket to you, but this is a 
complicated process. Allowing the helicopter to land and 
then take you aboard is a safer option. This section discusses 
preparation for a landing and goes over some copter safety.
Preparing a landing zone
Your first action is to select a piece of ground suitable for 
landing. The following is a checklist for preparing a helicopter 
landing zone.

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
216
 
✓ Choose an opening that’s at least 110 feet (37 meters) 
wide. This is the touchdown area, and it’s the bare 
minimum that the aircraft can enter (see Figure 12-3). 
The wider the space, the better, especially in windy 
conditions. Ideally, the touchdown area should have 
an entrance and exit that allow the helicopter to fly into 
the wind.

Figure 12-3: Minimum requirements for a helicopter landing zone.
 
✓ The surrounding area, the area near the touchdown 
area, needs to be wide, clear airspace if possible. Some 
bald ridgelines work well. You want to have several 
hundred feet around the touchdown area that’s obstacle 
free. Though a helicopter can indeed hover, you want to 
try to give the aircraft the opportunity to land and take 
off using forward motion because it’s much safer for the 
aircraft and its crew.
 
✓ Find the flattest ground you can. Helicopters have 
trouble landing on slopes of more than 5º to 10º.
 
✓ Clear the touchdown area. Remove any object or 
plant that stands taller than 1.5 feet (0.5 meters) in the 
touchdown area.
 
✓ Remove or hold down all loose items in your landing 
zone, especially little things like plastic bags. When the 

 Chapter 12: Signaling for Rescue 217
helicopter arrives, it can blow everything that isn’t held 
down into the air, which can play havoc on the whole 
rescue process. Make sure you’ve removed all the 
cardboard, paper, and plastic bottles from your landing 
zone, and try to stomp down as much loose snow as 
possible in the touchdown area.
 
✓ If you can make contact with the pilot or crew, tell 
them the direction of the wind and where the nearest 
power lines or other obstacles are. Electrical wires are 
especially hard to see.
Practicing helicopter safety
 
When the helicopter is on its approach to your landing zone, 
you need to practice scrupulous helicopter safety. Here are 
basic points to keep in mind as the chopper lands:
 
✓ Stop signaling with mirrors or any bright reflective 
devices the moment you’re sure the helicopter has 
seen you. If using a flashlight, don’t shine it anywhere 
near the pilot’s eyes. Mirrors and flashlight beams can 
blind the pilot.
 
✓ Put out any fires or smoke-producing devices. The 
smoke can obscure the pilot’s view.
 
✓ Be prepared to be winched if necessary. If the helicopter 
can’t safely land, one of two devices will be lowered to you:
 
• A metal basket: These float, and all that’s required 
is for you to get inside the basket and make sure 
you have nothing hanging over the side that could 
get hung up somewhere during the winching process.
 
• A strop: This is simply a loop of very heavy cordage. 
Put both arms through the loop, pull it backward 
until it’s under your armpits, and then hold your 
arms at your sides. Make sure you keep your arms 
by your side, or you may fall out.
 
 If you’re at sea, static electricity builds around these 
devices, so when they’re lowered, allow them to dip into 
the water first to discharge the static electricity.
 
✓ Try not to stand underneath a landing helicopter. Stay 
well clear of the aircraft as it lands.

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
218
 
Here’s what to do after a helicopter has landed:
 
✓ Wait until you’re signaled to board the aircraft. Watch 
for the crew to tell you that approaching the helicopter is 
okay.
 
✓ Always approach a helicopter from the front. Position 
yourself so you’re in plain sight of the pilots or aircrew. 
Never approach the helicopter from the rear (check out 
Figure 12-4). If you do, you’re walking into the pilot’s 
blind spot and are at grave risk of injury. Stay clear of the 
tail at all times, and never go under the tail boom.
 
✓ Never approach a helicopter from higher ground. The 
risk of injury from the rotor is too great. If the aircraft 
is lower than you, stay well away from it until you’ve 
walked down to an even elevation.
 
✓ Keep long-handled tools out of the way. Carry long-
handled tools like ice axes, ski poles, walking sticks, or 
digging implements low and parallel to the ground.

Y
ou can make a quantum leap in your ability to survive 
by just knowing a few basic first aid procedures. In a 
real survival situation, the inability to deal with even minor 
medical trauma can prevent you from getting back to safety.
In this chapter, you find the step-by-step procedures you need 
to know when you face trauma in the field. We give you advice 
for dealing with injuries of all types, including animal attacks 
and insect stings. Of course, how much first aid you can pick 
up from a book is limited, so consider taking a course on 
Basic Life Support or first aid.
Understanding First Aid Basics
Whenever you encounter a person who is injured or 
incapacitated, you should assume the situation is serious. 
No matter the circumstances, following the basic responses 
in this section can help you stabilize the situation. Read on.
Responding to serious trauma
In any crisis, you should work in a sequence of priorities:

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
220
 
1. Watch for danger to you or the subject and move the 
subject only if necessary.
 
 Be on guard for whatever may have caused the injury — 
rock falls or other debris threats, dangerous vehicles, 
poisonous gasses, and so on. If no danger exists, treat 
the subject in the position you found him in.
 
 If a threat exists, remove the subject from danger 
using the clothes drag: Grasp the collar at the lowest 
point you can, and keeping your buttocks low, drag 
the subject gently out of danger (see Figure 13-1a).
 
 Moving someone with a neck or spinal injury can 
cause further damage. Make the best decision you 
can about which is the greater threat: the immediate 
danger or the possibility of worsening the injury. If 
danger is imminent, support the neck with your hands, 
or better, immobilize the neck with an improvised 
brace (Figure 13-1b). As soon as the neck is secured, 
practice the clothes drag.
a
b
Figure 13-1: Practicing the clothes drag (a) and immobilizing a neck 
injury (b).
 
2. Make sure the subject’s breathing and heartbeat are 
restored.
 
 See the next section for details on checking pulse and 
breathing and on what to do if you find none.

 Chapter 13: Administering First Aid 221
 
 If bleeding is especially heavy, control it before 
dealing with the subject’s breathing and heartbeat.
 
3. Treat bleeding (see “Controlling Bleeding,” later in 
this chapter).
 
4. Protect wounds and immobilize fractures.
 
5. Treat for shock.
 
 Check out the “Treating Shock” section later for more 
info. If you have a subject who has been in the water, 
look at Chapter 22 for info on cold shock response.
Keep in mind that all the procedures here are for survival 
situations only. In any of these cases, you should try to obtain 
professional medical treatment as soon as possible.
Assessing the ABCs
After you remove the subject from immediate danger, you 
need to make sure the person is breathing and has a heartbeat. 
Just remember your ABCs: Check the person’s airway, 
breathing, and circulation (see Figure 13-2).
Airway
The first part of the ABCs is making sure the person has a 
clear airway. To do so, follow these simple steps:
 
1. Lay the palm of one hand on the subject’s forehead 
and put two fingers of the other hand under his chin, 
pulling the jaw forward; then ease the subject’s head 
back a couple of inches (see Figure 13-2a).
 
 This procedure prevents the tongue from blocking the 
airway. If you suspect the person has a broken neck, 
don’t tilt the head back unless doing so is the only 
way the person can breathe.
 
2. Open the mouth gently and examine the airway.
 
3. If you can see anything that’s obviously blocking the 
airway, use two fingers to reach in and pull it out.
 
 Things that usually prevent breathing include foreign 
objects, broken teeth, blood or bloody froth, vomit, 
the person’s tongue, swelling, or kinks in the wind-
pipe. Don’t use your fingers to blindly feel around in 
the person’s throat.

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
222

b
c
Figure 13-2: Checking the airway (a), breathing (b), and circulation (c).
Breathing
The second part of the ABCs is making sure the person is 
breathing. You can detect shallow breathing by placing your 
cheek right next to the person’s mouth (see Figure 13-2b). 
You should also listen for any sucking noises coming from 
the upper body of the person, which can indicate a punc-
tured lung. For the procedure for handling this injury, go to 
“Bandaging a sucking chest wound,” later in this chapter.
If you can’t detect any breathing, follow these simple steps:
 
1. Check the pulse.
 
 We describe how to take a pulse in the next section. If 
you find neither a pulse nor breathing, perform CPR.
 
2. If you find a pulse but no breathing, pinch the per-
son’s nose completely shut and give him two com-
plete breaths by mouth-to-mouth.
 
 Blow slowly and steadily twice. Watch for the chest to 
expand when you’re administering these two breaths.
 
3. If the torso doesn’t expand, check the person’s 
airway again.
 
 If you can’t find anything, try pushing three to five 
times forcefully on the subject’s abdomen, halfway 
between his breastbone and belly button. This may 
eject the blockage.
 
4. Repeat the two-breaths-and-clearing process until the 
person responds.
 
People commonly vomit during mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, 
so be ready for it. If the person vomits, clear it away with your 
fingers. You can also try rolling the person onto his side so he 
can expel the vomit or fluid more easily.

 Chapter 13: Administering First Aid 223
Circulation
The third part of the ABC list is to assess circulation. Check 
whether the heart is beating by taking a pulse. The easiest 
place to take a pulse is the carotid artery, a large blood vessel 
in the neck. Lightly place your first two fingers on the side of 
the windpipe just where it meets the underside of the jaw, as 
in Figure 13-2c.
To measure the heart rate per minute, count the pulses you 
feel in a 10-second period and then multiply by 6. Healthy 
pulse rates vary, but you can compare the subject’s pulse to 
these general ranges:
 
✓ Children: 90–110 per minute
 
✓ Healthy adults: 70–90 per minute
 
✓ Strong athletes: 45–60 per minute
A rapid pulse may be a sign of shock (see the later section 
“Treating Shock”). If you find no pulse, begin chest compressions 
(see the later section “Giving CPR”). Otherwise, put the 
subject in the recovery position, as we explain in the next 
section.
Using the recovery position
If the subject’s ABCs are fine but he’s unconscious, place him 
in the recovery position, which allows fluids or vomit to drain 
from the mouth and keeps the tongue from rolling backward 
and blocking the airway. Warning: If you believe the injured 
person has a neck or spinal injury, don’t place him in the 
recovery position unless you’ve first immobilized the neck 
(refer to Figure 13-1b).
To place someone in the recovery position, reach across, 
grasp the subject’s leg behind the knee, and pull the leg 
toward you. Place the leg at a 90° angle so that it props up the 
body (see Figure 13-3). You want the subject to end up with 
the following:
 
✓ One leg and one arm raised
 
✓ His head resting on his arm
 
✓ His mouth free of obstruction

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
224
Ideally, you want to place the subject in the horizontal 
recovery position, with the head below the feet, to help treat 
shock. For info on shock, see “Treating Shock,” later in this 
chapter.
Figure 13-3: The recovery position.
Giving CPR
Anyone who plans to spend a good deal of time outdoors 
should know the principles of cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
(CPR), a method of supporting the heart and breathing until 
rescue crews arrive or until the subject is breathing on his 
own. CPR is best administered by someone who has received 
formal training. To find a CPR course near you, consult the 
Red Cross at www.redcross.org.
 
You should use CPR only if the person both
 
✓ Has no detectable pulse
 
✓ Is unconscious and not breathing
If the subject is breathing but has no pulse, do the chest com-
pressions only. Here are the four main steps of CPR on adults:
 
1. Place the person flat on his back, making sure his 
mouth is slightly open.
 
 Kneel next to him in such a position that you can 
perform the chest compressions and breathing 
without moving.

 Chapter 13: Administering First Aid 225
 
2. Locate the spot where you perform chest 
compressions, and position your hands.
 
 Place two fingers at the bottom of the person’s 
breastbone and then place the heel of your hand 
just above the fingers. Your hand should be near the 
center of the person’s chest (see Figure 13-4a).
 
 Place your other hand over your first and interlock your 
fingers. The heels of both hands should now be aligned 
as in Figure 13-4b. Make sure your hands are well above 
the subject’s sternum (breastbone); otherwise, you’re 
just pumping on the abdomen, which does no good.
 
3. Using a straight-armed stance and a steady, smooth 
motion, lean forward to compress the breastbone 
down about 2 inches (5 centimeters), and then come 
back up, releasing pressure (see Figure 13-4c).
 
 You should try to do compressions at a rate of slightly 
more than one per second. A good way to do this is to 
count “one and two and three and four” and so on.
 
4. After every 15 compressions, pinch the person’s nos-
trils together and give two slow breaths (Figure 13-4d).
 
 The whole cycle of 15 compressions and two breaths 
should take you about 15 seconds.

Figure 13-4: Administering CPR.
Continue CPR until the person resuscitates (check the person’s 
pulse and breathing on occasion) or until you’re unable to 
continue. Keep at it as long as you can. In some cases of 
cold-water immersion or other causes of hypothermia, 
prolonged CPR has proved successful if the subject was also 
warmed during CPR.

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
226
Controlling Bleeding
When an accident occurs, you can expect to see one or more 
of the three types of bleeding:
 
✓ Capillary: This is usually superficial bleeding from tiny 
blood vessels near the skin.
 
✓ Venous: This bleeding comes from the veins, the blood 
vessels that return blood to the heart. It’s characterized 
by a steady flow of dark red or maroon colored blood.
 
✓ Arterial: This is potentially the most dangerous type of 
bleeding, and it’s characterized by spurts of bright red 
blood.
This section shows you how to control visible bleeding. Signs 
of internal bleeding include blood in the urine (though other 
things can result in bloody urine) or a blue or red discoloration 
in the skin, but this kind of injury can’t be treated without 
surgery.
Treating capillary and 
venous bleeding
Capillary and venous bleeding are the two most common 
types of bleeding. You can control them in the following four 
basic ways. Think of these techniques as a system, not just 
individual methods that you have to perform separately.
 
✓ Direct pressure: Apply pressure directly to the wound 
with a bandage, with some other type of cloth, or with 
your hand if you have nothing else. Apply pressure for 
10 to 15 minutes or more, and resist the urge to look at 
the wound during that time. If the bleeding doesn’t stop, 
keep up the pressure for an additional 15 minutes and 
consider applying indirect pressure to a pressure point.
 
 If you need to continue applying pressure but are unable 
to do so manually, you can apply a pressure bandage. 
For more on applying a pressure bandage, see “Cleaning 
and covering wounds,” later in this chapter.

 Chapter 13: Administering First Aid 227
 
✓ Indirect pressure: You can apply pressure at one of the 
body’s main pressure points (see Figure 13-5). If you can’t 
locate an exact pressure point, experiment by exerting 
pressure at the joint just above the injury.
 
✓ Elevation: Simply raising the wound so that it’s above 
the heart can slow the blood loss significantly.
 
 Don’t elevate a wound in the case of snakebite — in that 
situation, keep the wound below the heart.
 
✓ Holding the blood vessel shut with your fingers: If 
you’re really in trouble and you have to act fast, you can 
put one or two fingers over an open vein (or artery). This 
can sometimes be the only way to stop major bleeding.
Figure 13-5: Pressure points where you can apply indirect pressure.
Handling arterial bleeding
Arterial bleeding occurs when one of the body’s arteries has 
been injured. You can easily identify it by the extreme amount 
of bright red blood spurting or pulsing from the body. When 
this happens, you can
 
✓ Put one or two fingers into the wound to stop the bleeding. 
This may be your only option during a crisis.

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
228
 
✓ Try to staunch the flow of blood by exerting pressure 
on a pressure point above the wound. (Check out Figure 
13-5 for where the pressure points are.)
 
✓ Apply a tourniquet if the situation is dire. A tourniquet is 
a band you apply with extreme compression to cut off 
circulation.
Deciding to use a tourniquet
 
Use a tourniquet only when the subject is in clear and 
immediate danger of bleeding to death. The tourniquet is an 
absolute last resort! Tourniquets are usually overkill and can 
cause severe tissue damage, which can lead to the loss of the 
limb later on. Tourniquets are also very painful, which can 
cause undue stress and trauma.
 
Traumatic amputation, such as when a limb is severed or torn 
off as a result of an accident or an animal attack, doesn’t 
necessarily warrant a tourniquet. The muscles in the remaining 
portion of the limb may spasm and close the artery. You still 
have other bleeding to deal with, but you can control this, 
many times, with other methods. To see those other methods, 
read the earlier section “Treating capillary and venous 
bleeding.”
Applying a tourniquet
To make a tourniquet, you need a stick (to restrict the 
tourniquet) and a band, preferably a thick one. A good width 
is 3 inches (7.5 centimeters) or more. (Tip: If you have to use 
line or wire, wrap cloth under or around the line to reduce the 
pain and damage from the tourniquet.) The stick should be 
about 6 inches (15 centimeters) long — you can use a pen or 
pencil.
If applying a tourniquet is your only option, keep in mind the 
following instructions and refer to Figure 13-6:
 
1. Apply the tourniquet just above the bleeding site 
and tighten it only as much as is necessary to stop 
the arterial bleeding.
 
 To tighten the band, thread the stick under the band 
and then twist. Attempt to put a pressure bandage 
on the wound after the bleeding has stopped (see the 
later section “Cleaning and covering wounds”).

 Chapter 13: Administering First Aid 229
 
2. If you know that no help is coming for at least 2 
hours, loosen the tourniquet, very slowly, after 
about 20 minutes.
 
3. If the person is breathing and has a pulse, and if 
the bleeding is either under control or absent, treat 
immediately for shock.
 
Never cover a tourniquet. Leave it exposed so that emergency 
personnel can see it if they arrive to help. Take a pen, lipstick, 
or blood and print TK on the subject’s forehead so that 
everyone knows this extreme type of treatment has been 
given. And of course, never apply a tourniquet to a neck wound.
Figure 13-6: Applying a tourniquet.
Treating Shock
Shock is a reaction your body develops as a response to inad-
equate blood flow. The blood pressure is too low to maintain 
all the body’s functions, especially the brain, and they begin 
to shut down, which can be fatal. Shock can come as a result 
of a wide variety of traumas. In any traumatic situation, you 
should keep an eye out for the following signs of shock:
 
✓ Cold, clammy skin
 
✓ Acute anxiety, psychological distress, or disorientation

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
230
 
✓ Bluish lips and extremities
 
✓ Rapid pulse
 
✓ Sensation of thirst
Because shock is a reaction to trauma, your first priority 
is to make sure that none of the subject’s traumas are 
life-threatening. If the patient is breathing, has a heartbeat, 
and isn’t severely bleeding, treatment for shock is as follows 
(see Figure 13-7):
 
✓ Maintain the subject’s body temperature. Place a sheet 
or blanket under and over the subject to keep him warm. 
If it’s hot out, find shade and try pouring cool fluids onto 
a rag or sheet and then gently administering the cooling 
cloth to the subject’s body.
 
✓ Try to calm the subject. Stay near the subject and be 
reassuring, upbeat, and firm. People in shock can benefit 
greatly from reassurance.
 
✓ Lay the subject down and elevate his feet. The proper 
position depends on whether the subject is conscious:
 
• Conscious: Lay the person on his back and elevate 
the feet about 12 inches (30 centimeters) to 
improve the blood flow to the brain. Don’t let the 
person smoke, eat, or drink.
 
• Unconscious: Lay the person on his side, supporting 
his neck, and elevate his feet 12 inches. Make sure 
the subject’s airway is clear and that he’s breathing. 
Do not attempt to give fluids to someone who’s 
unconscious.
 
 If the subject has a head injury, don’t elevate the feet. 
Just keep him warm and calm.
 
✓ Continue to monitor the subject. Be on guard and ready 
to treat for shock even if the subject is conscious and 
doesn’t immediately feel pain or other discomfort. If the 
subject is unconscious, watch for changes in breathing, 
temperature, and circulation, and try to keep him in the 
recovery position (refer to Figure 13-3). Anything other 
than dry, healthy-pink skin and a normal body temperature 
can indicate the patient is still in shock.

 Chapter 13: Administering First Aid 231
Figure 13-7: Treating conscious and unconscious subjects for shock.
Handling Breaks, Sprains, 
and Wounds
Any one of the common conditions that follow can debilitate 
you in the wilderness, and as we tell you at the beginning of 
this chapter, just knowing the basic procedures can mean the 
difference between life and death. In this section, we explain 
how to deal with broken bones, soft tissue injuries, and 
wounds.
Treating fractures
A fracture is a break in a bone, usually from some type of 
force-trauma. If you don’t treat this type of injury, it can cause 
permanent damage and/or internal injuries. It can also seriously 
hamper your ability to travel, build, or otherwise move 
around without causing pain to the injury.
 
As soon as you believe you or someone else has sustained a 
fracture (or a sprain), you should assume the injured limb is 
going to swell. Remove wristwatches, jewelry, or any type of 
constrictive clothing near the injury.
In treating any fracture, strive to immobilize the part of the 
body that sustained the trauma. Immobilizing a fracture 
prevents the broken bone from doing more damage, and it 
makes transport of the subject possible.
There are two types of fractures, classified according to 
whether the bone breaks through skin: open and closed. This 
section explains how to treat them.

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
232
Closed
Closed fractures, in which the broken bone doesn’t break 
through skin, can be more difficult to identify. Signs that a 
person has a closed fracture include the following:
 
✓ Immediate swelling, usually in the form of a knot or lump
 
✓ Tenderness at the site of the trauma
 
✓ A grating sound when trying to move
 
✓ An unnaturally bent or crooked limb or joint
To immobilize the fracture, apply a splint (see Figure 13-8). 
A splint is simply a rigid support, firmly attached above and 
below the fracture point. You can use poles, sticks, rolled 
newspapers, or anything else that’s strong and firm as the 
support for your splint.
 
Try to use cloth to tie the splint, and try to use square knots 
or bows that you can easily undo (go to Chapter 14 for more 
on knots). Always try to align all the knots on one side of the 
splint.
Figure 13-8: Splinting broken bones.
If a limb is bent at such an angle that you can’t immobilize 
the fracture, you can try applying traction — a gentle 
straightening of the limb — so you can apply a splint. 
Traction should be relatively painless, especially if you 
perform it before the swelling becomes excessive. To apply 
traction, gently pull the misaligned part of the limb away 

 Chapter 13: Administering First Aid 233
from the fracture and move it slowly toward alignment. If this 
causes any appreciable pain in the subject, stop. Sometimes 
you can perform traction only in small movements.
 
After you perform traction on a fracture, you need to check 
for circulation in at the extremity of the limb. If you feel no 
pulses, or if the skin is discolored beyond a fracture, you may 
have to realign the fracture to restore circulation. If circulation 
is okay, go ahead and apply the splint.
Open
You can quickly identify open fractures because when the 
bone breaks, it pierces the skin.
 
Open fractures are exceedingly susceptible to infection, so 
now’s the time to put on sterile gloves, wash your hands, wear 
a mask — do whatever you can to keep things sterile with 
the supplies you have. Try not to breathe on the wound, and 
don’t touch the protruding bone directly.
Here’s how to treat an open fracture (see Figure 13-9a):
 
1. Apply traction if necessary (as we explain in the 
preceding section).
 
2. If bleeding is severe, apply direct pressure to the 
wound or skin near the break.
 
 Try pushing downward on either side of the bone to 
stop bleeding, but don’t put any pressure directly on 
the bone (refer to Figure 13-9b). For more on applying 
direct pressure to stop bleeding, see “Treating capillary 
and venous bleeding.”
 
3. Pad around and protect the bone before bandaging.
 
 You can do this by putting a protective housing over 
it, such as a clean plastic cup, or you can use rolled 
gauze (Figure 13-9c). Afterward, apply the proper 
dressing and bandage. For more on that, see “Cleaning 
and covering wounds,” later in this chapter.
 
4. Bandage firmly (Figure 13-9d) and then pinch the 
limb’s extremity to make sure circulation is adequate.
 
 The limb is now ready to splint, as we explain in the 
preceding section.

Treating sprains
You can think of sprains and pulled muscles as soft tissue 
injuries, which means that the bone hasn’t been damaged. 
You suffer these types of injuries because of stresses on 
joints, muscles, and damage to tendons. They can be just as 
debilitating and painful as fractures. In the field, you may 
not be able to tell the difference between a fracture and a 
sprain. If you can’t tell, put a splint on the damaged site to 
immobilize it.
To treat a sprain, use the memory tool RICES:
 
✓ Rest: Give the limb at least 72 hours rest, if you can, or 
it won’t heal. Rest can mean simply minimizing motion, 
although no motion at all is the best.
 
✓ Ice (cold therapy): Apply cold to the injury for 15 to 20 
minutes every 3 to 4 hours. Do not apply continuous cold 
therapy, and don’t apply ice directly to the skin; always 
wrap the ice in cloth.
 
✓ Compression: After applying cold, wrap the injury in a 
compression bandage (any bandage that applies pres-
sure), like an elastic Ace bandage (see Figure 13-10). The 
bandage should be snug but not constricting.

 Chapter 13: Administering First Aid 235
 
 After you apply the bandage, pinch a finger or toe on the 
injured limb to see whether the blood is circulating 
properly. If you don’t see a noticeable flood of blood 
under the skin after you pinch it, you’ve put the bandage 
on too tightly, and you have to rewrap the injury.
 
✓ Elevation: Elevate the limb by propping it up about 6 
inches to 1 foot (15 to 30.5 centimeters) on something 
soft. This cuts down on swelling and throbbing.
 
✓ Stabilization: Don’t move the injury, and take precautions 
to prevent an object or person from bumping into or 
striking the damaged limb. In the case of a sprained wrist 
or arm, you can use a sling to immobilize it, or you can 
simply tie the limb to the person’s body.

Cleaning and covering wounds
You should bandage any wound, no matter how small, to 
protect it from infection. Take three important steps: clean 
the wound, dress it, and then bandage the wound. This 
section explains how to do all three.
Cleaning the wound
Before you start to dress the wound, take a moment to clean 
it. Cleaning the wound reduces the risk of infection, which 
could slowly incapacitate you. When cleaning the wound, 
keep in mind these basic guidelines:
 
✓ Operate cleanly. Try to use sterile gloves when handling 
a wound. If you don’t have them, wash your hands 
thoroughly with soap and water if possible, or use 
alcohol or hand sanitizer.

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
236
 
✓ Irrigate the wound to remove debris. Use a flow of clean 
water to wash debris out of a wound instead of removing 
it with your hands or with a cloth, because your hands 
usually have unwanted bacteria on them. If clean water 
is unavailable, you may need to remove grit and dirt with 
tweezers (make sure your first aid kit has a set).
 
✓ Use soap and water. Washing a wound with common 
soap and then rinsing it with clean water can do more 
to prevent infection than anything else. The iodine or 
antiseptic wipes in most first aid kits are fine, but you 
should use them only if you don’t have soap and water.
 
 Don’t use antiseptics on deep wounds. Antiseptics are for 
small, shallow wounds.
 
✓ Clean the wound from the center, outward. If you clean 
from the outside toward the center, you risk bringing in 
dirt and germs from the surrounding skin.
Dressing the wound
After you clean the wound, you’re ready to put on a dressing, the 
covering that goes directly over the injured area. Remember 
the following points:
 
✓ Make sure the dressing is the right size. It should be 
large enough to extend well beyond the wound’s edges.
 
✓ Without touching any of the surrounding skin, place 
the dressing directly on the injured site. Skin isn’t 
sterile, so avoid sliding or dragging the dressing over the 
wound.
 
✓ If blood soaks through your dressing, don’t take the 
dressing off. Instead, put another one directly over the 
first.
 
✓ Use sterile gauze if you have it. If you don’t have any, 
use any clean, nonfluffy material. Fluffy cloth produces a 
lot of lint, which gets into the wound.
Bandaging the wound
With your dressing in place, you’re ready to bandage. When 
you bandage the wound, keep the following guidelines in 
mind:

 Chapter 13: Administering First Aid 237
 
✓ Use nonfluffy cloth, such as fabric from a shirt, as your 
first option. If you don’t have any, then you can use 
almost anything else.
 
 If you’re desperate, you can reuse old bandages and 
dressings — but only if you boil them in water first.
 
✓ Make your bandages wide. Roll the bandage in a wide 
area to spread the friction and force, and tape the 
bandage to itself, not to the skin.
 
✓ Apply bandages firmly with tape or safety pins, or tie 
them with a square knot directly over the dressing. To 
see how to tie a square knot, see Chapter 14.
 
✓ Monitor the circulation. Keep an eye on circulation, 
because cutting off the blood flow with a bandage is all 
too easy. If blood is flowing properly, you should see a 
rapid return of blood under the skin after you pinch it.
A pressure bandage, which you use for continuous bleeding, is 
a tighter bandage. To apply a pressure bandage, place a thick 
wad of gauze or cloth over the wound so that when you tie 
the bandage over it, you apply extra pressure. Always tie the 
knot of the bandage directly over the wound. A large knot of 
gauze, firmly tied over a bleeding wound, can slowly stop the 
bleeding. This bandage isn’t a tourniquet, so don’t cut off 
circulation completely.
Periodically check bandages, and the wounds under them, to 
make sure infection isn’t setting in. For more on infections, 
see the later section “Treating infections in wounds.”
Closing open wounds
If you encounter a clean, open wound, try to close it to avoid 
infection. There’s little reason to sew up wounds in most out-
door situations, but you can essentially tape a wound shut:
 
✓ Butterfly bandages: A butterfly bandage is a special 
adhesive strip shaped like an hourglass. Many first aid 
kits have them. When applying the butterfly bandage, 
make sure that the wide parts grab the skin on either 
side of the injury, with the thin part stretched across the 
closed wound.

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
238
 
✓ Tape: If you’re desperate, you can use strong tape to 
close a wound. Bring the edges of the flesh loosely 
together with adhesive tape or, in dire circumstances, a 
safety pin.
 
Do not close dirty wounds; bandage them and seek help. If 
you can’t close the wound or if the wound is dirty, simply 
bandage the wound and monitor it for infection.
Bandaging a sucking chest wound
If your subject has had her chest punctured and you can hear 
air being drawn through the wound, or if you can see bubbles 
coming from it, you have a special case on your hands: a 
sucking chest wound. If left untreated, this type of wound 
causes the lung to collapse. Take action immediately by doing 
the following:
 
1. Put the palm of your hand over the wound to seal it 
shut.
 
 This can prevent the lung from collapsing.
 
2. Quickly bandage the wound on only three sides.
 
 Place sterile gauze over the puncture and then tape it 
in so that one side is left unattached. In a pinch, you 
can tape plastic wrap over the puncture.
 
 The gauze or dressing should lie down snugly over 
the hole. When the subject inhales, you want the ban-
dage to close tightly over the puncture, like a one-way 
valve; when the subject exhales, you want the air to 
escape.
Treating infections in wounds
Despite cleaning and washing, some wounds still become 
infected. Wounds that have become infected usually display 
one or all of the following characteristics:
 
✓ Inflammation, redness, and pain at the wound
 
✓ Elevated temperature at the wound (the skin feels hot)
 
✓ Reduction of mobility in the limb
 
✓ Presence of fluid discharge (pus) from the wound

 Chapter 13: Administering First Aid 239
If you or someone else develops an infection, you can treat 
the infection with the following treatments:
 
✓ Rest: One way to help fight infection is to rest. This may 
not be possible in a wilderness survival situation, but if 
you can’t rest the whole body, try to rest the infected 
area as much as possible.
 
✓ Heat therapy: Apply very warm, moist bandages over the 
wound for half an hour, three times daily. A clean, sterile 
cloth soaked in hot water is ideal.
 
✓ Daily wound cleaning: If you collect foreign matter in 
the wound, or if it appears infected, take a moment to 
wash your wound with soap and water if possible.
 
✓ Antibiotics: Antibiotics can fight infection, but in many 
survival situations, broad-range antibiotics, such as 
ciproflaxin (Cipro), aren’t always effective. Before going 
into the field, check with your doctor to find which 
antibiotics have proven effective for treating infections in 
the area you’re planning to travel in.
Treating Burns
Burns threaten your life in two major ways: shock and 
infection. When you’re burned, your body leaks fluid in 
response, which you can think of as “clear bleeding.” If you’re 
burned over a significant portion of your body, you’re going 
to have the same situation you’d have if you were severely 
bleeding, and that puts you at risk for shock. Not only that, 
but burns damage the body’s protective layer, and that’s 
where you get the infection. Burned skin leaves you with 
nothing to fight off bacteria and other germs.
In this section, we tell you how to treat burns, both minor and 
severe. (For information on treating sunburn, see Chapter 17.)
Handling minor burns
Thankfully, most burns are minor scalds. To treat minor 
burns, follow these directions:
 
1. Remove jewelry and clothing.

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
240
 
 You don’t want anything to impede the swelling that 
accompanies all burns.
 
2. Pour cool liquid over the burn site for at least 10 
minutes.
 
 You can use water for this, but canned soda will do in 
a pinch.
 
3. Bandage the wound according to the guidelines in 
the “Cleaning and covering wounds” section, earlier 
in this chapter.
 
 Try to be as clean and sterile as you can, because 
burns invite infection.
 
Don’t break or burst any blister. New skin will form under the 
blister during the healing process. If you break the blister, 
you interfere with the healing process and could introduce 
infection. Cover blisters with a protective bandage, like the 
type used to protect an open fracture (see the earlier section 
“Treating fractures”).
Dealing with more-severe burns
Some burns are more severe and require different treatment. 
Generally, in severe burns, the skin is clearly charred or 
disfigured. Here’s the procedure for treating severe burns:
 
1. Put a covering on the ground and then lay the 
subject on it, taking special care that the burned 
area doesn’t come into contact with the ground.
 
2. Douse the burn with cool liquid immediately to stop 
the burning process.
 
 If you’re short on water, put some kind of receptacle 
or dish underneath the subject so that you can catch 
the poured water and recycle it over the wound. 
Continuously pour water over the wound as needed 
for pain.
 
3. Check the subject’s airway, breathing, and circulation 
and treat as needed.
 
 We explain how in “Assessing the ABCs,” at the 
beginning of this chapter.

 Chapter 13: Administering First Aid 241
 
4. Remove constricting jewelry or smoldering clothing 
near the burn site.
 
5. Apply a sterile bandage.
 
 See “Cleaning and covering wounds,” earlier in this 
chapter.
Addressing Hypothermia 
and Dehydration
In this section, we discuss hypothermia (the cooling of the 
body) and dehydration. We cover some additional hot- and 
cold-weather concerns in the chapters that deal with extreme 
environments, such as the desert (Chapter 17) or tundra 
(Chapter 16).
Treating hypothermia
When your body cools below the optimal temperature 
of 97–98.6°F (36.1–37°C), you begin to feel the effects of 
hypothermia. If the human body cools down too much, basic 
functions shut down and death follows shortly. (Check out 
Chapters 4, 5, and 6 for tips on how clothing, fire, and shelter 
can help you avoid hypothermia.)
Hypothermia is a progressive condition, which means that the 
longer it’s left untreated, the more dangerous it gets and the 
more difficult it is to treat. If you notice initial signals of cold, 
such as shivering, do something immediately, such as putting 
on an extra layer of clothing or covering your head. Signs of 
hypothermia include the following:
 
✓ Extreme shivering
 
✓ Bluish coloring
 
✓ Apathy and the desire to lie down or give up
 
✓ Dizziness, disorientation, slurred speech
 
✓ A stop in shivering (very dangerous)

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
242
 
If a person who is cold has stopped shivering, or if she lies 
down after a long bout of shivering, assume that she’s in 
extreme danger. Treat for hypothermia immediately.
To treat for hypothermia, follow these directions:
 
1. Try to keep the hypothermic subject horizontal.
 
 When dealing with water casualties, try to hoist the 
subject out of the water horizontally rather than head 
first. In any case, try to keep the subject’s heart level 
with her head. In extreme circumstances, turning the 
subject vertical can cause cardiac arrest.
 
2. Remove wet clothing.
 
 If possible, replace wet clothing with dry clothing.
 
3. Rewarm slowly and steadily, monitoring the subject 
very closely.
 
 Rewarming a hypothermia subject too fast can cause 
the person to go into shock or cardiac arrest, so watch 
closely and be ready to perform CPR. When treating 
for hypothermia, it pays to be slow and gentle. Trying 
to speed recovery can cause more problems than it 
solves because the dangerously weakened subject 
can’t withstand harsh changes. To rewarm someone 
with hypothermia, follow these steps:
 
1. Apply sources of warmth slowly, gently, and 
steadily, starting with the chest.
 
 Work steadily by applying warm rocks, hot water 
bottles, warm hands, or anything else you can to 
warm the skin of the upper torso. Don’t boil your 
subject!
 
2. Warm the neck and crotch.
 
 Don’t rewarm the limbs. Doing so may cause the 
subject’s body to divert precious blood to those 
areas, which can cause shock, stroke, or cardiac 
arrest.
 
3. Cover yourself and the subject with a blanket, 
sleeping bag, and/or your survival kit’s space 
blanket.

 Chapter 13: Administering First Aid 243
 
 A cold person needs rewarming, not just a cover, 
so get under the covers with the hypothermic 
person. Give the subject skin-to-skin contact — 
don’t be afraid to strip down.
 
Never assume that a hypothermia subject is out of trouble 
after you’ve rewarmed her. All hypothermia subjects are at 
risk for afterdrop, a continued cooling of the body even after 
exposure to heat. Don’t take your eyes off your subject. Stay 
with the person and treat for shock and exhaustion.
Dealing with dehydration
The longer dehydration goes on, the harder recovery 
becomes. As it progresses, dehydration causes fatigue, 
dizziness, high pulse rate, nausea, and in advanced cases, a 
swollen tongue, delirium, and death. The only way to treat 
dehydration is to slow the loss of bodily fluids and to take in 
liquids that don’t dehydrate you further. For a thorough look 
at getting water, turn to Chapter 7.
 
If dehydration has already set in and you’re lucky enough to 
have access to water, have the subject take a long series of 
small sips of water, not big gulps. Large volumes of water can 
cause complications like nausea and vomiting.
Treating Bites, Stings, 
and Poisonings
In case of an animal attack, your first priority is to make sure 
that you and the subject are no longer in danger. Your second 
priority is to record accurate information. Whenever you deal 
with bites, stings, or poisonings, you need to immediately 
gather as much info as you can. That way, you can pass it 
on to the medical team when you reach professional help. 
Specifically note the following:
 
✓ The type of creature or source of poisoning: For 
instance, record the color and shape of the spider. 
Most effective treatments are specially designed for a 
particular species or substance.

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
244
 
✓ The condition an animal was in: Notes on obviously sick 
animals can help doctors choose treatments or watch for 
specific signs of disease.
 
✓ When the incident occurred: Some treatments depend 
on the time that has expired since the bite, sting, or 
poisoning.
 
If you can do so safely, capture whatever attacked or bit 
you. That way, the pros can identify the culprit and test it for 
disease.
This section provides some basic advice for treating bites, 
stings, and poisonings when medical help isn’t nearby.
Mammal bites
If you’re attacked by a mammal, here’s what you should do:
 
✓ For superficial bites: These are basic puncture and 
scratch wounds. Clean and bandage the wound (as we 
describe in “Cleaning and covering wounds,” earlier in 
this chapter). Mammal and reptile bites, especially deep 
puncture wounds, also carry the threat of tetanus 
infection. Make sure your tetanus shots are up-to-date.
 
✓ For serious bites and attacks: In case of a dismembering 
or deep gouging, concentrate on stopping the bleeding. 
Cleaning this type of wound in the field is usually 
counterproductive because getting bleeding under control 
is vastly more important. Tightly bandage the wound and 
then get help or transport the subject out of the wild as 
soon as possible.
 
Whenever a mammal bites you, you’re at risk for rabies, a 
virus that causes severe neurological disorders in all mammals 
and is fatal if not treated. If you can’t safely catch the animal 
that attacked you and verify that it doesn’t have the disease, 
you may have to undergo treatment for rabies.
Snakebites
Lethal snake venom usually takes several hours to kill a 
person. However, venomous snakes usually don’t inject 
enough toxin during a strike to kill an adult human. In fact, 

 Chapter 13: Administering First Aid 245
bite marks don’t necessarily mean that the snake has discharged 
venom at all. But even if a snake isn’t venomous, its bite can 
still cause tetanus and infection, and that makes all snakebites 
dangerous. You have to take each bite seriously.
You should monitor the subject of a bite for at least 2 hours 
after she’s been bitten. Be on the lookout for the following 
signs of a reaction to venom:
 
✓ Continuous extreme pain at the bite site
 
✓ Head and muscle aches
 
✓ Dizziness, nausea, and sweating
 
✓ Difficulty breathing and shock
If you’ve been bitten by a snake in a wilderness situation and 
you believe the snake is venomous, try to slow the spread of 
the venom. Here are the steps you should take (Note: In some 
countries the advice for treating snakebites varies from what 
we provide here, so check with local experts before you go):
 
1. Try to identify the snake.
 
 Most antivenins are engineered to work against venom 
from only one type of snake, so knowing exactly which 
type of snake bit the subject is critical.
 
 When trying to identify or catch the snake, keep in 
mind that a dead snake can still strike from reflex and 
that the venom is still just as potent.
 
2. Make sure the bite is lower than the subject’s heart 
at all times.
 
3. Work to calm the subject.
 
 Anxiety makes the snakebite much worse. Any 
reassurance you can give the person helps.
 
4. Wash the wound.
 
 Soak up any venom that may be near the teeth marks 
and then wash the site (with soap and water if 
possible) and pat it dry.
 
5. Apply a pressure bandage.
 
 This is a simply a compression bandage that starts 
above the wound and then winds tightly down to the 
puncture site. For example, if you’re bitten on the ankle, 

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
246
you start bandaging above the calf and work your way 
down, winding tightly until you reach the bite. This can 
help stop the flow of toxin through the body. Warning: 
Don’t cut off circulation with a tourniquet.
 
6. Immobilize the limb.
In any situation involving a snakebite, be ready to treat for 
shock and perform CPR. For instructions, see “Treating 
Shock” and “Giving CPR,” earlier in this chapter.
The best treatment for a venomous snakebite is the 
administration of antivenin, so get to the hospital as soon as 
you can. The longer you wait before seeking medical help, the 
more likely that the snakebite will cause complications, and 
the antivenin will be less useful.
Spider bites and insect stings
Most spider bites and insect stings are merely itchy or painful, 
but others can cause allergic reactions, paralysis, tissue 
damage, or death. Avoidance, of course, is the best course of 
action. (For more on avoiding spider bites and insect stings, 
see Chapter 15.)
Of the dangerous spiders, black widows, brown recluses, 
and tarantulas tend to cause the most harm. Brown recluse 
bites are usually the worst. These bites are painful, and they 
usually form a large pustule at the bite site; this normally 
ruptures, and the dead tissue around it falls away in 10 to 14 
days. Black widow bites usually cause pain and even partial 
paralysis, usually for no more than 24 hours; bites are rarely 
fatal. Tarantula bites are painful, but they’re also rarely fatal.
In any bite or sting situation, follow these instructions:
 
1. Try to identify the insect or spider.
 
 Try to catch the insect or at least make sure you know 
what color it was and what specific markings it had.
 
2. Make sure the subject’s ABCs are satisfactory.
 
 For a look at these procedures, see “Assessing the 
ABCs,” earlier in this chapter. Be on guard for signs of 
difficulties swallowing and choking, which are signs of 
anaphylactic shock (check out the nearby sidebar).

 Chapter 13: Administering First Aid 247
 
3. Try to calm and reassure the person who’s been 
stung.
 
 Anxiety and high heart rate only amplify the symptoms.
 
4. Remove the stinger or mouthparts if they’re still in 
the skin.
 
 If the stinger has been left in, scrape it off with a piece 
of paper or the edge of a knife or credit card. Don’t use 
tweezers for this procedure, which can squeeze the 
poison sac and just inject more venom.
 
 A tick anchors itself in your skin with its sucker, which 
can break off and stay inside you if you remove the 
critter in the wrong way. To force a tick to release, 
grasp it at the precise point where it enters the skin, 
preferably with tweezers, and then pull slowly and 
steadily. Your skin should rise slightly with the pull 
on the animal. Hold this pressure. You may have to 
wait for anywhere from 10 seconds to 2 or 3 minutes, 
but the tick should disengage and pull its sucker out. 
When performing this procedure, don’t crush or twist 
the tick’s body. You want it to stay alive so it can 
disengage cleanly.
 
5. Wash the sting or bite site with soap and water, and 
then apply cold compresses.
 
6. Monitor the subject for an allergic reaction or shock, 
and be ready to give CPR.
 
 Regardless of the type, insects pose the greatest 
threat to you when they inflict multiple stings. Even if 
you’re not allergic, multiple hornet stings or ant bites 
can cause you to go into anaphylactic shock. Always 
take multiple sting situations seriously.
Poisoning
Unlike venom, which critters inject, a poison is a substance you 
ingest through your food or water. As always, prevention is 
best. You can avoid eating poisonous plants by performing the 
Universal Plant Edibility Test, which we outline in Chapter 8.
The common symptoms of poisoning are
 
✓ Nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and/or diarrhea

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
248
Watching for anaphylactic shock
Many allergens and toxins, such 
as those found in insect bites 
and stings, foods, and medicines, 
can cause anaphylactic shock, a 
deadly allergic reaction. Symptoms 
usually include difficulty swallowing, 
dizziness, wheezing, nausea, hives, 
and swelling of the eyes, face, and 
tongue.
If you see signs of a severe 
reaction developing, especially 
choking and difficulty in swallowing, 
take extra precautions to maintain a 
clear airway in the subject, and be 
prepared to give CPR. Don’t put a 
pillow under the head of the subject, 
because this can close the airway.
Some people who are prone anaphy-
lactic shock carry medications with 
them. If you believe you’re dealing 
with a case of anaphylactic shock, 
ask the subject whether she’s carry-
ing medication, or if she can’t com-
municate, look in her backpack or 
kit. The most common medication 
is epinephrine, usually carried in 
syringe called an Epi-Pen. If this isn’t 
available, you can try administering 
diphenhydramine (Benadryl). Anyone 
experiencing anaphylactic shock 
should be evacuated to a medical 
facility as soon as possible.
 
✓ Weakness
 
✓ Sweating
 
✓ Seizures
If you have a person who has lost consciousness due to 
suspected poisoning, put him in the recovery position and 
monitor his airway. The subject may vomit, which can 
obstruct the breathing. To see the recovery position, check 
out Figure 13-3, earlier in this chapter.
Note when the subject ingested the poison and how much 
he took, and try as hard as you can to identify exactly what 
caused the poisoning. Treatment can vary depending on 
the substance, so you may have to make a judgment call. If 
someone has recently eaten a poisonous plant — and he’s 
conscious and coherent — he can put a finger down his 
throat to induce vomiting and attempt to get it out of his 
system. However, note that vomiting up caustic substances 
can burn the throat.

Keeping It Together: 
Ropes and Knots
Even possessing just a few skills with rope (or cordage) can 
give you tremendous confidence in the wild. This section 
gives you the lowdown on ropes, including the different types 
you can use, and then delves into some knots and lashings.

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
250
Getting the lowdown on rope
Here are some important principles to keep in mind about the 
strength of rope:
 
✓ Shock puts tremendous strain on rope. When you’re 
estimating whether your rope can hold a certain amount 
of weight, keep in mind that you need a thicker rope to 
handle a sudden snap or shock on the line than you’d 
need if that same amount of weight were applied slowly.
 
✓ Ropes lose their strength rapidly. If you have a rope 
that’s been sitting out for a while or one that has lots of 
burrs and scrapes on it, or if its coloring is faded, consider 
it to be weakened and vulnerable to breaking.
 
 You weaken your rope whenever you put a knot in it. The 
average knot weakens a rope by about 60 percent. Seems 
kind of unfair, doesn’t it?
 
✓ Braided rope is stronger than laid rope. Ropes that are 
braided, or woven together, are stronger than ropes that 
are the same size and made of the same material but are 
laid, or twisted.
Knowing the types of cordage
You usually don’t have whole lot of choice of cordage in a 
survival situation, so you frequently have to improvise. Some 
ropes are better than others for certain situations, so try to 
get an idea of what you can expect from the type of rope you 
do have. Knowing your rope’s relative strength and stretchiness 
can tell you, say, whether you can rely on that rope to hold a 
raft together, support your jungle hammock, or save you from 
a fall down the mountainside.
The following list names the main types of rope you’re likely 
to use in your travels, from strongest to weakest:
 
✓ Nylon: This fiber is used for climbing ropes and for 
anchor lines on boats. It’s usually white, and it feels soft 
to the touch, though in climbing rope, it’s usually hidden 
inside a colorful sheath. Nylon is exceptionally strong, 
and it’s very stretchy — almost like rubber in some 
cases. The stretchiness allows the cordage to act as a 
shock absorber. Nylon doesn’t float.

 Chapter 14: Survive or Thrive? Advanced Methods and Tools 251
 
✓ Dacron: This is the type of rope typically found on 
sailboats. It’s very strong, and it doesn’t stretch or float.
 
✓ Polypropylene: This is polyethylene’s older, stronger 
brother, and it’s usually blue. Not as shiny or smooth 
as polyethylene, this type of cordage is the strongest of 
the cheap plastic ropes. It floats and is slow to rot, and 
you can usually find it aboard fishing boats. It stretches 
slightly, although nothing like nylon.
 
✓ Polyethylene: This is the type of rope that’s usually sold 
in hardware stores. It’s shiny and smooth to the touch, 
usually brightly colored — most often bright yellow — 
and it’s usually braided. This rope is only slightly stronger 
than manila or sisal rope, but it rots at a slower rate than 
those natural fiber ropes, and more importantly, it floats.
 
✓ Manila and sisal: This is the hairy yellow or brown rope 
that feels raspy in your hands. It’s a natural fiber, and if it’s 
thick enough, it’s pretty strong. It’s very stretchy, and it 
swells rapidly when exposed to water, which can make 
it very hard to work with when it’s wet. It doesn’t float.
 
✓ Cotton: This is the soft white cordage that makes up your 
clothesline. Don’t use it for anything other than to hang 
up your laundry, unless you have to.
Tying some essential knots
Knots are simply the use of friction to make the rope perform a 
certain type of job for you. There are hundreds of types of knots. 
Here, we list several that can get you by in a tight situation.
 
Whenever you tie any of these knots, take a moment to tighten 
them — really work them in so that they’re locked down. All 
these knots are designed to lock tightly and then to come out 
easily when you’re finished with them. (Note: In the figures, the 
knots are tied loosely to make them clearer for you.)
Square knot
You use a square knot to tie to two similar ropes together 
(see Figure 14-1). To tie this knot, follow these steps:
 
1. Take two ends of a rope, lay the right end over the 
left, and wrap it around in an overhand knot.

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
252
 
 This is the same way you start to tie your shoelaces 
or any other bow, for that matter; just fold the rope 
around itself.
 
2. Take the end in your left hand, lay it over the right, 
and fold it over once again.
 
 You know you have a square knot when it looks 
symmetrical. If it looks crooked, it’s a granny knot — 
and granny knots don’t work very well for anything!
Figure 14-1: A square knot.
Sheet bend
The sheet bend can join two different types of ropes, which is 
exactly what’s required in most survival situations. You can 
tie any two types of line together with this knot (like nylon to 
manila, for example), or you can use it to tie any two types 
of improvised cordage together in an emergency (like if you 
have to tie a bed sheet to a garden hose or an electrical cord 
to a beach towel). Just remember that if you’re using two 
dissimilar cordages, the one that is the thickest is the one 
that forms the bight. To tie the sheet bend, follow these steps 
(see Figure 14-2):
Bight
Figure 14-2: Tying a sheet bend.

 Chapter 14: Survive or Thrive? Advanced Methods and Tools 253
 
1. Take the thicker of the two ropes and make a bight.
 
 The bight is the big loop that the thin line snakes 
around.
 
2. Thread the thin line up through the bight and then 
wrap it around the head of the bight.
 
3. Thread the thin rope between itself and the bight; 
then tighten.
Sheet bend double (Beckett bend)
The sheet bend double is the exact same knot as the sheet 
bend (Figure 14-2) with one extra step: You just wrap another 
loop of rope around the bight to increase its gripping strength. 
Use this knot (Figure 14-3) when you join two things that are 
really slippery.
Figure 14-3: Making a sheet bend double.
Anchor bend
Use the anchor bend knot (Figure 14-4) whenever you want 
to attach a rope to a pole or a log or a ring. To tie this knot, 
follow these simple steps:
 
1. Wrap your rope twice around whatever you want it 
to hold so you end up with a circle of rope around 
your object.
 
2. Take the free end of your rope, bring it around, and 
thread it through the circle; then tighten.

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
254
 
3. Lay the free end over the rope again and now thread 
it through this new loop; then tighten.
Figure 14-4: Tying an anchor bend.
Bowline
The bowline knot (Figure 14-5) instantly gives you a loop that 
won’t slip. To make this knot, do the following:
 
1. Hold the palm of your left hand up and lay your 
rope on top of it so that you’re grasping the rope 
about 3 feet (0.9 meters) from the end.
 
 The 3 feet of line should be hanging down from the 
heel of your upturned palm.
 
2. Take the hanging bit of line in your right hand, 
reach up, and lay a loop over the line in your left, 
forming a design that looks like the numeral 6.
 
 You should now have a loop of line in your left hand, 
with about 2 feet (0.6 meters) hanging down from the 
heel of your upturned palm.
 
3. Take the point of the rope, which is called the 
rabbit, in your right hand; thread the point up 
through the bottom of the loop, snake it around the 
rope on the other side of your left hand, and then 
thread it straight back down into the loop.
 
 This saying can help you remember what to do: The 
rabbit comes up through the hole, runs around the tree, 
and goes back down the hole.
 
4. After you thread the end of the line back into the 
loop, pull on it to tighten the knot.

 Chapter 14: Survive or Thrive? Advanced Methods and Tools 255
Figure 14-5: A bowline knot doesn’t slip.
Clove hitch
The clove hitch (Figure 14-6) is the knot that begins and ends 
most lashings on wood. To make this knot, do the following:
 
1. Wrap your rope around a pole; then wrap it a second 
time, laying the first wrap over the second to form 
an X.
 
2.  Thread the point of the line underneath the X and 
tighten.
Figure 14-6: Tying a clove hitch.
Two half hitches
You use this quick knot as a finishing knot when tying things 
down. To tie two half hitches, do the following (see Figure 14-7):

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
256
 
1. Wrap your rope around a pole and then lay the loose 
end over the line.
 
2. Thread the loose end under the line lying over the 
pole; tighten.
 
3. Lay the loose end over the line and thread it through 
the loop underneath; tighten.
Figure 14-7: Tying two half hitches.
Lashings for loads
If you ever need to secure something, you can use this simple 
and reliable method to tie something down so it holds. This 
type of work is called lashing, and the lashing we show you 
here is sometimes called a trucker’s hitch. We use a luggage 
rack to demonstrate, but it works on anything — on the back 
of a truck or on the back of your backpack.
The trucker’s hitch is simply a loop and a tensioner. This 
lashing gives you the ability regulate exactly how much or 
how little tension you want to put on the line. Check out 
Figure 14-8 as you read these instructions:
 
1. Tie an anchor bend to one pole.
 
 We show anchor the bend earlier in Figure 14-4.
 
2. Grasp the rope in the middle and pull it up until it 
forms a bight; then double the bight over itself so 
that it forms a slip knot.
 
 A bight is an arc of rope pulled up from the middle of 
the line. This step gives you a loop in the center of 
your line.

 Chapter 14: Survive or Thrive? Advanced Methods and Tools 257
 
3. Wrap the line around the second pole and then 
return it to feed through your loop.
 
 This is your tensioner.
 
4. Pull the line through the loop until you have the 
amount of tension you want; then pinch the neck of 
the loop with your hand to hold the tension.
 
5. Finish with two half hitches.
 
 Tie two half hitches (Figure 14-7) at the neck while 
holding the tension.

That’s a wrap: Making a tripod
You can use a tripod for a wide variety of purposes in the 
wild. A tripod is three poles, tied together by a lashing, that 
you can use to make tents, hold pots for cooking, and do a 
host of other practical things. Refer to Figure 14-9 as you read 
these instructions:
 
1. Start with three thin logs of the same length; place 
two on the ground, with a space between them, and 
place the end of the third log between them.

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
258
 
 The poles can be of any length, depending on what 
you’re using the tripod for, but they should be sturdy.
 
2. Tie a clove hitch (Figure 14-6) to the end of one of 
the outer logs.
 
3. Wrap your rope tightly around all three logs as 
many times as you can.
 
 As you’re performing this procedure, knead and work 
each of these wraps so that all the slack comes out 
and you get a good, firm bond on your logs. Make sure 
you leave a good deal of rope to finish the lashing.
 
4. Tighten the entire lashing with fraps.
 
 A frap is a wrap that goes between the logs and gathers 
the ropes into a tight bunch. Take time and care to 
really tighten your fraps.
 
5. Finish with a clove hitch on the log opposite your 
first clove hitch.

Making a square lashing
You can use a square lashing to bind one pole to another at 
a right angle, such as when you’re building a platform in the 
jungle or making any other type of shelter. Refer to Figure 14-10 
as you follow these steps:
 
1. Put a clove hitch (Figure 14-6) on one pole; then 
wrap the rope around that pole once to get the 
lashing started.
Begin with
clove hitch.
End with

Fraps

2. Mount the tied pole at a right angle to the new pole 
you want to attach it to; wrap the free end of the 
rope behind the new pole.
 
3. Bring the rope around, pass it over the original pole, 
and then wrap it around the new pole once again.
 
4. Continue this binding process until you have about 
four or five wraps; then frap.

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
260
 
 To frap, take the rope and go between the poles, 
wrapping up only the rope — not the poles. Fraps are 
for tightening the wraps.
 
5. After you get about three fraps squeezing the wraps, 
finish tightly with a clove hitch on the pole that 
doesn’t have one yet.
Crafting Your Own Tools
With just a few raw materials, such as stone, wood, and 
cordage of some sort, you can quickly fashion tools to defend 
yourself from wildlife as well as to catch food to eat.
This section looks at how to make some basic survival tools 
almost entirely from natural materials. Keep in mind that it 
always helps to have your wilderness survival kit handy, con-
taining at least a knife and some cordage (for more on kits, 
see Chapter 2). You can survive without the kit, but the kit is 
invaluable in making other tools.
Making stone tools
If you lose your knife, never fear — a stone tool will do in a 
pinch. This section explains how you can break a stone to 
determine its type. After you know the type, you can shape it 
into a tool for various tasks.
Splitting a stone to assess its type
Before you can craft your own stone tool, you need to know 
about the different stones available and what they can do for 
you. Superficially, river or beach cobbles (baseball to softball-
sized round rocks) all seem the same: round, boring, gray 
rocks. But if you split them open, you find some differences.
To split a stone, take it in two hands and slam it down on 
another rock. (Warning: At the moment of the blow, close 
your eyes to prevent being injured by a chip of flying stone. 
Better yet, wear glasses or sunglasses.) You can simply throw 
the stone at a cliff wall if you don’t want to risk smashing your 
fingers, but holding the rock can give you a little more control 
over what you’re doing.

 Chapter 14: Survive or Thrive? Advanced Methods and Tools 261
 
After you open the stone, you can assess its grain size and 
identify what the stone is useful for. Run your thumb over 
the exposed surface of the rock to assess its grain size. The 
following are common rock types listed in order of increasing 
grain size, along with some ways you can use them:
 
✓ Obsidian: Obsidian is volcanic glass. It’s often black, and 
when chipped, the edges come off razor-sharp.
 
✓ Flint and chert: Flint and chert are smooth, fine-grained 
stones that have edges that can be very sharp, but they 
aren’t as brittle as obsidian. These rocks are ideal for 
making spearheads or arrowheads. (If you have access 
to steel, you may want to save a piece of flint or chert for 
starting fires — see Chapter 5 for details.)
 
✓ Basalt: Basalt is dense, dark rock that doesn’t shatter as 
easily as obsidian. Its edges aren’t as sharp as obsidian, 
but because basalt is more durable, it’s great for making 
tools for heavy-duty work like scraping or chopping.
 
✓ Pumice and sandstone: Pumice, an igneous rock, and 
sandstone, a sedimentary rock, are the sandpaper of the 
natural world. They’re both ideal for abrading wood, 
bone, and antler into various shapes.
Shaping the stone into a tool
After you have an idea of how fine the grain is, you can begin 
to shape the stone into the tool you want. Here are the two 
main tools you need so you can work stone into shapes useful 
to the survivor:
 
✓ Hammerstone: A hammerstone is a rock you use to break 
open another rock. Larger hammers (about the size of a 
baseball; see Figure 14-11a) are useful for breaking the rock 
to get good slivers and splinters of rock; smaller ham-
mers (Figure 14-11c) can be the size of a peach pit or a 
large marble and are used to trim the edge of a splinter 
of rock with a little more control. In either case, the point 
is to break the core (the main rock) with the hammer and 
produce shatter (Figure 14-11b), bits of stone that have 
sharp and robust edges that are useful for woodworking 
or other tasks. In Figure 14-11d, you see a cobble that has 
conveniently split in half, providing a great hard, sharp 
edge for chopping wood.

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
262
 
 Smash the hammerstone against the edge of a core stone. 
Holding the core in the hand gives you more control over 
where your strike lands. This bashing often results in 
sharp flakes of stone that you can easily use as knives 
without any further shaping. In most survival situations, 
you can get what you need just by breaking open lots of 
rock and picking through the debris to find just the right 
shape — no pressure flaker required.
 
✓ Pressure flaker: A pressure flaker is a piece of metal, 
bone, or antler, about the size of a pen or pencil, with a 
robust but sharpened tip (Figure 14-11e); you use it to 
press hard on the very edge of a flake of a piece of 
shatter. The pressure flaker allows fine control of the 
shape of the rock you’re working on, allowing you to 
make shapes as intricate as notched arrowheads 
(Figure 14-11f) after some practice. To shape a stone 
with a pressure flaker, carefully trim the edges of a flake 
of stone into the desired shape.

f
Figure 14-11: Breaking and shaping stone for tools and weapons.
 
Most of the time, when a stone tool isn’t working, the problem 
is that the rock is the wrong grain size or the hammerstone is 
too large or small. The only way to figure out these subtleties 
is through trial and error; experiment in your backyard, and 
get your hands on a book about basic flintknapping.

 Chapter 14: Survive or Thrive? Advanced Methods and Tools 263
Carving bone and antler tools
You can carve bone and antler into tools you can use in the 
wild. In fact, sometimes bone and antler are easier to work 
with than stone. They flex under impact instead of shattering 
(which stone does), which makes them particularly good tips 
for spears.
You can harvest bone and antler from the carcasses of many 
large mammals. Figure 14-12a shows an elk, highlighting (in 
white) the very useful antlers and the metapodials, the lower 
leg bones. Don’t leave these at a carcass! Collect them, scrape 
away any tissues, and wash them if you can. Soaking bone 
and antler in water for 24 to 48 hours can make them easier to 
work with.

Figure 14-12: Making tools from bone and antler.
Here are the main ways to shape bone and antler:

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
264
 
✓ Smash them with a hammerstone on an anvil to produce 
splinters. To split a bone open, smash down on the bone 
with a baseball-sized stone or even hit a small wedge of 
stone into the bone with a hammerstone, as in Figure 
14-12b. Many bones (and antlers you may find just lying 
on the ground, as in Figure 14-12c) are hard to break, 
especially if the animal died recently. Try again a few 
days later, when the bone begins to dry out.
 
✓ Abrade the splinters with a coarse stone. Grind away 
the surface of the bone or antler with sandstone or 
pumice, just like you do when you use regular sandpaper. 
See Figure 14-12d.
 
✓ Perforate the abraded splinters with a hard item, such 
as the awl on your knife. You can instead use a sharp 
stone splinter to perforate bone and antler, but this is 
very hard to do. It’s much better — as always — just 
never to be out there without your pocketknife or 
multitool.
Figure 14-12 shows a variety of bone and antler tools you can 
make, such as spear tips, harpoons, and fishing hooks. Use 
your imagination and experiment to find useful shapes.
Making Natural Remedies
When you’re in the wild, you may encounter sickness, infection, 
and other ailments. If you’re in a bind and don’t have certain 
treatments in your first aid kit, you can improvise by making 
your own remedies. This section looks at a few easy and safe 
medicines you can make.
Using salicin, nature’s aspirin
Salicin, or salicylic acid, is one of the main ingredients in 
aspirin, and you can use it as a cold and headache reliever, 
as well as a treatment for swelling and inflammation. You can 
find it in aspen and willow trees. To extract salicin, peel away 
some bark and scrape off the soft tissue between the bark and 
the wood. Figure 14-13 shows an example.

 Chapter 14: Survive or Thrive? Advanced Methods and Tools 265
a
b
c
Figure 14-13: Extracting salicin from an aspen tree (a); recognizing willow 
leaves (b) and aspen leaves (c).
To use salicin, prepare a tea by boiling twigs, buds, or scrapings 
from the moist layer of wood between the bark and the tree. 
Steep the materials for a long time, and then mash them into 
a liquid pudding and drink it. You can also chew on the twigs 
and use the solution as a topical reliever by smearing it on an 
inflamed area.
Preparing medicines for wounds, 
burns, and bowels
You can apply any of the substances in this section to your 
skin to treat a wound or burn, or depending on the plant, 
you can ingest them to treat bowel problems or satisfy your 
hunger.
Tannin
Tannin, or tannic acid, is useful for preventing infection, 
for treating burns and other skin problems, and for treating 
diarrhea. You can draw tannin from all types of sources, 
including just about any tree bark (Figure 14-14), acorns, 
strawberry leaves and blackberry stems, and banana plants.
To use tannin, prepare a tea by boiling or soaking crushed 
bark, acorns, or leaves. Steep for a long time, and then add 
more materials to steep until you have dense tea. Treat burns 

Part II: Eyeing Advanced Survival Techniques 
266
or wounds by applying cool compresses soaked in the tea. If 
you’re desperate and suffering from a debilitating bout of 
diarrhea, try drinking a small portion of tea made from white 
oak bark or other hardwood barks known to contain tannin.
Figure 14-14: The bark from just about any tree has tannin in it.
Plantains
Plantain plants, which come in more than 200 varieties in the 
tropics, are good for treating wounds of all kinds, itching, and 
problems in the bowels, such as diarrhea and dysentery. A 
plantain (see Figure 14-15) is a little banana-like fruit, usually 
green, flat, and hard like wood.
To use plantain plants, brew a tea of plantain leaves or seeds. 
Drink it for diarrhea, or mash up the boiled or soaked leaves 
in the tea and then apply it to irritated skin.
Figure 14-15: Plantain fruit.

 Chapter 14: Survive or Thrive? Advanced Methods and Tools 267
Common cattail
Cattail grows at the edge of water sources and is good for 
treating wounds, sores, and burns. It’s also a food source. 
Check out Figure 14-16 to see a cattail and its roots.

b
Figure 14-16: Common cattail (a) and cattail roots (b).

bloom spikes, or peel and eat the shoots raw.

Surviving in Extreme 
Land Environments

In this part . . .
A
lthough the basics of wilderness survival are the 
same worldwide, different environments can pose 
different problems. How do you build a shelter in the 
snowy tundra, where the nearest stick of wood is 300 miles 
away? How do you survive the relentless rays of the sun if 
you’re trapped in the desert? In this part, we cover three 
main environments: forests (both temperate and tropical), 
snowy climates, and arid deserts. We tell you how to survive 
them by looking for food and water in specific places and 
by making shelter from the materials at hand.

Chapter 15
Special Considerations for 
Forests and Jungles
In This Chapter
▶ Watching out for dangerous animals
▶ Preventing tropical disease
▶ Taking care of water, clothing, and shelter in the jungle
▶ Making your way through the rainforest
T
emperate forests offer many resources that make sur-
vival a little easier than it is on the open sea or in the 
desert. Nevertheless, jungles and tropical forests present 
many problems for the survivor because these areas harbor 
so many diseases and parasites. Before entering either type 
of forest — temperate or tropical — make sure you’re ready 
for these situations.
In this chapter, we cover bear safety, insect and parasite aware-
ness, and the dangers of tropical disease. We also give special 
instructions for dealing with the problem of getting off the floor 
of the jungle (which is a particularly nasty place) and explain 
how to use your best friend in the tropics, the machete.
Identifying Hazardous Wildlife 
in Dry Forests
Knowing what kinds of animal life are nearby gives you an 
advanced understanding of the wilderness around you. It 
helps you know where to set traps for food, where to make 
camp, and where you shouldn’t tread. This section points out 

Part III: Surviving in Extreme Land Environments 
272
some dangerous wildlife you may encounter in the woods and 
how to recognize it.
Preventing bear attacks
Many times, bear attacks occur because a person acciden-
tally stumbles upon the animal when it’s feeling vulnerable 
or territorial. Knowing the signs that bears are nearby can 
help you remain safe in the wild. Bear paw prints (check out 
Figure 15-1a) are about the size of a large human hand, and 
their claw marks are unmistakable on trees — just make sure 
you’re looking in the right place for these marks. Bear claw 
marks on trees are frequently 8 to 9 feet (2.4 to 2.7 meters) up 
the side of the trunk.
 
Whenever traveling in bear country, take the following proper 
precautions:
 
✓ Carry bear spray or bear pepper spray: You can buy it 
in most National Parks and outfitter stores. Make sure 
you read the label and follow the instructions. Recent 
studies suggest that bear pepper spray really works, and 
you should have it handy — not buried in your pack.
 
✓ Be exceedingly careful about food smells: Never keep 
food in your shelter, not even a morsel. Perfumed soaps 
and deodorants fall into this category, too. Always place 
your food at least 100 yards (91 meters) from your shel-
ter. Don’t sleep in the same clothes you wear when you 
cook your food.
 
✓ Make plenty of noise as you travel: Many experienced 
hikers in bear country make constant noise as they hike. 
Singing, banging metal, or making other such noises lets 
bears know that you’re approaching. Making a noise often 
causes the bear to move away long before you get there.
 
✓ Remember which way the wind is blowing: If the wind 
is at your back, the bears can smell you coming and usu-
ally get out of the way. But if the wind is in your face, 
you’re in danger of startling a bear because your smell is 
flowing behind you. Make a lot of noise when the wind is 
in your face.
 
You should also keep an eye out for three important scenarios 
in which bear attack is likely:

 Chapter 15: Special Considerations for Forests and Jungles 273
 
✓ Cubs: If you see bear cubs in the wild, consider yourself 
in peril. Locate the mother bear as quickly as you can 
and move away from her. Female bears are known to 
attack anything near their young.
 
✓ Fresh kills: If you come across a freshly killed animal 
that has been covered up with some freshly flung dirt, a 
tree branch, or some leaves (Figure 15-1b), you may have 
run across a bear’s cache, and the animal may be nearby. 
Get away from this kill site as quickly as possible.
 
✓ Hibernation dens: A large hole that faces away from 
the wind or at an angle to the wind — especially one 
that allows snow to build up around its face — may be 
a hibernation den, especially if you’re in bear country 
between the months of September and April.
a
b
Figure 15-1: Keep an eye open for bear paw prints (a) and kill sites (b).
If you do encounter a bear, freeze. Talk calmly in a monotone 
and try to back away slowly. For more on what to do when a 
bear attacks, see Chapter 24.
Avoiding mountain lions
Mountain lions (Puma concolor), or cougars, are big cats that 
stand about 3 feet (0.9 meters) tall and weigh anywhere from 
100 to 250 pounds (45 to 115 kilograms). They rarely attack 
humans, but attacks have climbed recently to about one per 
year. Mountain lions usually attack children or the elderly, 
and they usually do so by lunging for the neck.
Keep in mind that big cats of all kinds hunt for the weakest of 
the species and that many times, they can tell when you’re

infirm, especially if you have a limp. (Animal trainers some-
times feign limps or infirmity to draw big cats’ attention.) If 
you’re infirm and traveling in big-cat country, stay off trails 
near dusk and dawn and always try to travel with a companion.
If you encounter a mountain lion, don’t run. Make yourself 
appear to be as large as possible. For more on mountain lion 
encounters, see Chapter 24.
Avoiding woodland snakes
 
You can avoid snakebite almost indefinitely if you use your head. 
You should always expect snakes to be under any rock or log. 
The best way to prevent snakebite is to practice the following:
 
✓ Wear stout boots. The taller, the better. Most snakes 
can’t bite through good boots, and most bites occur 
below the knee.
 
✓ Watch your step. Stepping on snakes is a common prob-
lem in the wild.
 
✓ Use a stick and look closely. Always use a stick or pole 
to part foliage or turn over rocks or boards.
 
✓ Check bedding and clothes. Snakes like to curl up in 
warm, dark places.
If necessary, you can kill a snake with blows to the head or 
immobilize the head by using a forked stick to pin the snake’s 
neck to the ground. Table 15-1 lists poisonous snakes in dry 
forests; antivenins exist for all of these. For information on 
treating snakebite, see Chapter 13.

Evading spiders and ticks
Thankfully, protecting yourself from insects, spiders, and 
other creepy-crawlies is easy. The problem arises when your 
mind wanders and you forget the following precautions:
 
✓ Always wear a hat.
 
✓ Thoroughly shake out all clothing — especially shoes.
 
✓ Try not to put your hands in dark places or holes.
Here are some nasty eight-legged creatures you may encounter:
 
✓ Brown recluse: This spider is brown, with thin legs and 
a body in the shape of a violin. The bite causes fever, 

Part III: Surviving in Extreme Land Environments 
276
chills, and vomiting for up to 48 hours. It’s rarely fatal, 
but it can cause disfigurement and even lead to limb 
amputation from tissue death.
 
✓ Black widow: The notorious black widow is generally 
black with a distinctive red or orange hourglass design on 
the body. This spider is usually found in warmer environ-
ments. The bite, which is rarely fatal, is very painful and 
can cause temporary paralysis, sometimes up to a week.
 
 If someone is envenomed by a brown recluse or black 
widow, treat for shock and be prepared to administer CPR 
(see Chapter 13). Seek medical help as soon as possible.
 
✓ Ticks: You can find many varieties of these tiny arach-
nids. Ticks carry a wide variety of diseases, including 
Lyme disease. See Chapter 13 for tips on removing ticks.
Laws of the Jungle: Surviving 
in the Tropics
We wish we could tell you that you should prepare yourself 
to fight off a stealthy jaguar or swing from a vine, but unfortu-
nately, the main problem you face in jungle survival is disease. 
All extreme environments have their own forms of misery, and 
in the tropics, it’s the microscopic creatures that kill.
This section gives you a heads-up on how to survive in the 
tropics, including info on how to prevent tropical diseases; 
obtain safe drinking water, clothing, and shelter; and travel 
specifically in the jungle.
Preventing jungle diseases
 
Taking necessary precautions is the best way you can avoid 
major jungle diseases. You can take four basics steps to fend 
off illnesses that can kill you. If you do them all, the chances 
of being infected drop significantly. Here are the four methods 
of prevention, in order of importance:
 
✓ Boil water and cook food thoroughly. Many tropical dis-
eases come from contaminated water and food. Chapter 7 
explains how to filter and purify water (or collect rainwater, 
which is usually fresh if your collecting surface is clean).

 Chapter 15: Special Considerations for Forests and Jungles 277
 
✓ Wear proper clothing, sleep under protective nets, and 
use insect repellant. Just keeping the bugs off of you 
goes a long way toward staying disease-free.
 
✓ Wash and bathe often. Regular soap and water can do a 
surprisingly good job of stripping away harmful bacteria 
and other parasites.
 
✓ Use vaccines and preventive medication (prophylac-
tics): These of course must be specific for the environ-
ment. Talk to your doctor before your trip.
 
We highly recommend visiting the Centers for Disease Control 
(CDC) Web site at www.cdc.gov/travel for travelers’ info 
well in advance of your journey.
Diseases from contaminated water or food
Unfortunately, if you’re out there long enough, you eventually 
pick up something — it is, after all, the tropics. Knowing the 
signs of disease, when combined with prevention, gives you 
the best defense. The following tropical diseases are usually 
contracted from contaminated food or water:
 
✓ Bilharzia: You contract bilharzia from contaminated 
water, either from drinking it or through a break in the 
skin. A microscopic worm grows in the liver and irritates 
the urinary tract. The disease responds to medication.
 
✓ Cholera: You contract cholera from contaminated food 
or water. It causes very runny, “rice water” diarrhea, 
which causes rapid dehydration. It’s fatal in the very 
young, the very old, and the sick. Treatment is large 
quantities of clean water. A vaccine is available.
 
✓ Dysentery: This comes from contaminated water. 
Dysentery causes severe and persistent bloody diarrhea. 
Treatment is rest and rehydration. The disease may 
respond to antibiotics.
 
✓ Giardia: Giardia comes from contaminated water. This 
parasite causes severe and persistent diarrhea, as well 
as unpleasant burps. Treatment is rest and rehydration. 
The disease responds to antibiotic courses. No vaccine is 
available.
 
✓ Hepatitis: Hepatitis comes from contaminated water, 
sexual contact, or contact with urine or feces. It causes 
nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and yellowing 
of the skin (jaundice). There are many variations of this 

Part III: Surviving in Extreme Land Environments 
278
disease; some have vaccines, others don’t. Treatment is 
rest and nursing.
 
✓ Paragonimiasis: This parasitic disease, which is preva-
lent in Southeast Asia, occurs when a fluke worm grows 
in the lungs. It comes from undercooked food, espe-
cially shellfish. Paragonimiasis responds to antiparasitic 
medicines.
 
✓ Traveler’s diarrhea: This is the commonest complaint 
in travelers to the tropics, and it may be caused by bac-
teria, viruses, or parasites. Avoiding contaminated food 
and water is important. Maintaining fluid intake is very 
important. This condition may respond to Pepto Bismol 
or antibiotics.
 
✓ Typhoid fever: Typhoid comes from contaminated food. 
It causes severe intestinal disturbances and pink spots 
on the chest and the abdomen. Treatment is antibiotics, 
rehydration, and rest. A vaccine is available.
Diseases from insect and animal bites
Here are the identifying characteristics of the most common 
tropical diseases that are passed on through insect and animal 
bites (for more on protection from bug bites, see the later sec-
tion “Identifying jungle insects and other buggy creatures”):
 
✓ Bubonic plague: You contract this disease from fleas, 
and it causes fever, persistent vomiting, and painful 
swelling in the lymph nodes. It’s fatal if not treated, but it 
responds to antibiotics if diagnosed early.
 
✓ Dengue fever: This disease, which you contract through 
mosquitoes, has been on the rise in areas in the trop-
ics. Dengue fever causes flu-like symptoms and some-
times rashes, especially on the face and neck. It usually 
lasts a week and is sometimes fatal. There’s no vaccine. 
Treatment is rest. Don’t take aspirin or ibuprofen if you 
think you have dengue.
 
✓ Malaria: Malaria comes from mosquitoes, and it causes 
weakness, fever and chills, violent shivering, nausea, 
coma, and death. Preventive medications are effective, 
but they must be taken up to one week before exposure 
to the disease and several weeks afterward. Malaria can’t 
be cured, but medicine courses can reduce the severity 
of the symptoms during the lifelong outbreaks that come 
after infection.

 Chapter 15: Special Considerations for Forests and Jungles 279
 
 Malaria is a constantly evolving disease, and older medi-
cations become ineffective over time. You must take a 
prophylactic that’s up-to-date — one that’s engineered to 
cope with new strains. Opt for one with a proven record 
of working in the area in which you’re traveling. No vac-
cine is available.
 
✓ Leishmaniasis: This disease is passed on through sand 
flies. It causes large sores on the face, neck, and arms 
that can last for months and frequently disfigure the 
victim. This condition can lie dormant in the body for 
months or even years before rising to the surface. It’s 
very difficult to treat, and there’s no vaccine.
 
✓ Onchocerciasis (river blindness): Bites from black flies 
cause worm larvae to infest the victim, which causes 
tissue damage and blindness. It responds to worm-killing 
drugs and antibiotic courses. No vaccine is available.
 
✓ Rabies: This viral disease comes from bites from infected 
mammals, including bats. It causes madness and death. 
Rabies may respond to a vaccine.
 
✓ Yellow fever: Yellow fever is another mosquito-borne ill-
ness. It causes headaches, pain in the limbs, high fever, 
constipation, vomiting, and yellowing skin after about 
four to five days. It’s sometimes fatal. Treatment is rest 
and rehydration. A vaccine is available.
Obtaining safe water
The tropical forest is the greatest incubator of disease on 
planet Earth, and every single body of water presents the 
possibility of dysentery, hepatitis, and cholera. Consider 
river and stream water deadly, and make sure you boil all 
water in the tropics. The clarity of the water in a particular 
stream means absolutely nothing.
 
Boil your water for as long as you can. Ideally, you want to 
bring your water to a rolling boil and keep it that way for 15 
minutes. You can sterilize water with water purification tab-
lets, too, but they aren’t as reliable as boiling. Whether you 
use boiling or chemicals, strain your water through a filter 
first. For more on filtering and purifying, see Chapter 7.
If you don’t have the equipment or fire to boil water, start a 
rain-catching operation. Even a brief rain shower — like the 

Part III: Surviving in Extreme Land Environments 
280
type that comes almost every day in the tropics — can give 
you more than enough water. You can use broad leaves, like 
those on plantain and banana plants, as water-catching planes 
and receptacles. For more on the spine-tingling adventure of 
catching rainwater, see Chapter 7.
The jungle cover-up: Dressing 
for the tropics
Frankly, Tarzan was a little underdressed. When you’re in a 
jungle environment, you can think about clothing in terms of 
coverage. You want to cover as much of your skin as possible 
to prevent bites from insects. Make sure you wear the follow-
ing pieces of clothing (and Check out Chapter 4 for a basic 
overview of clothing needs in a survival situation):
 
✓ Hat: The most important piece of gear in a tropical forest 
is a hat. Keep your head covered as often as you can, 
because spiders and insects can drop from foliage and 
into your hair.
 
 Wear a hat even inside a tropical house or hut, even if it 
has a metal roof. Many insects dwell in the roof of a tropi-
cal house or hut, where they have the nasty habit of fall-
ing on victims.
 
✓ Lightweight long-sleeved shirt and long pants: The 
material you wear should breathe. Examples of this 
fabric are ripstop nylon, nylon blends, and cotton. Cuffs, 
both at the wrists and the ankles, should be snug.
 
 Ideally, you want adjustable cuffs so you can loosen them 
during the day and tighten them at dusk. Many outfitters 
sell lightweight pants and shirts with Velcro on the cuffs 
just for this purpose.
 
✓ Boots: A boot that rises up and meets the pants leg, com-
bined with a snug cuff on the pants at the ankle, can do 
much to protect you from mosquitoes, fleas, and mites.
 
In any tropical environment, mold and mildew are serious 
threats. Mold appears as small black and gray dots on fabric, 
and it eats through clothing, backpacks, and webbing in just a 
few days. The best way to defend against this is to hang all fab-
rics to dry every chance you get. If you’ve ever wondered why 
castaways’ clothes are always so shredded, now you know.

 Chapter 15: Special Considerations for Forests and Jungles 281
Avoiding mud flats, sand traps, 
and dangerous terrain
When you’re moving through the jungle, or whenever you’re 
deciding where to camp, be aware of these undesirable types 
of terrain and move away as quickly as you can:
 
✓ Stagnant water and mud flats: Avoid large, open patches 
of mud and/or stagnant water. They’re home to millions 
of mosquitoes, and when the sun sets, those mosquitoes 
swarm. They attack by the thousands, and they cause 
convulsions, shock, and malaria.
 
 Consider the afternoon sun to be like an alarm: If you’re 
still near mud flats or stagnant water at dusk, you’re 
going to have a problem with mosquito swarms. Don’t 
get caught out in the open at dusk or dark near a mud 
flat or stagnant pool — try to get away or under a net or 
some other protection.
 
✓ Mud holes and quicksand: These areas are small holes in 
the ground, usually less than 50 feet (15 meters) across, 
filled with mud or sand so soft that it can’t support your 
weight. Sometimes you can see these areas, but many 
times you can’t. Quicksand and mud holes won’t suck 
you down and suffocate you, but they can leave you quite 
stuck. There are many cases of strong people who walked 
into mud holes and couldn’t extract themselves.
 
 You should carry a large walking stick to probe the ground 
in front of you — especially if you leave the trail. This 
can seem cumbersome, but in remote areas, especially if 
you’re alone, you have little other choice. Whenever you 
begin to sink, especially if you sink past your calf, don’t 
struggle — turn around immediately and go back. For 
techniques for extracting yourself, see Chapter 24.
 
✓ Beaches near rivers: Beaches near tropical rivers are 
inviting, but you should camp on them only as a last 
resort. Tropical rivers have a bad habit of rising quickly. 
This is especially true of the Amazon River and its tribu-
taries. If you do camp on the beach, you have to maintain 
a good watch at night.

Part III: Surviving in Extreme Land Environments

Using a machete
A machete is a long metal blade with a plastic handle. They’re 
found in practically every house, bus, and car in the tropics. 
Sometimes they’re called cutlasses. Because the vegetation in 
the jungle is soft and it grows over the trails quickly, you need 
the unique cutting ability of a machete, as opposed to the 
harder, blunter cutting ability of an ax. (Sorry, but that beauti-
ful ax you bought at the outfitter starts to lose its value the 
moment you head off into the Great Green Tangle.)
Choosing and using the right blade
A variety of types of machetes are available. Just know that 
they can be divided into two categories: those you use to 
travel with and those you use to work with. If you can, carry 
both types. Here’s when and how to use them:
 
✓ Use the long blades when you’re traveling. To travel a 
trail with this type of machete, you use a lazy forehand 
swing to reach down low and strike the stalks of the 
plants standing in your way. Try not to flail away at the 
leaves or stems hanging in your face. Cut the foliage low, 
at the stalk, using a reaching motion. Done well, you 
shouldn’t have to bend over all day — which is precisely 
why the blade is made so long.
 
✓ Use the short blades for work. When chopping, making 
shelters, or preparing rafts, use the shortest blade you 
can. Attempting to use a long blade for work — like when 
you’re doing a lot of chopping — causes fatigue and 
injury, and it destroys the wood. Always use the short, 
cleaver-type of machete for work.
 
A machete isn’t a baseball bat or tennis racket; it’s not designed 
to be swung with enormous speed. When working your way 
through tangled foliage, make your low cuts with a controlled 
medium-speed motion (which isn’t very Hollywood, we know, 
but there’s nothing we can do about it). Wide and fast swings 
made with a machete eventually result in the blade’s coming 
back and striking you. Even the most experienced jungle people 
occasionally miss what they’re aiming at and strike themselves 
or someone nearby. Practically everybody we know has a 
machete scar on his or her leg.

 Chapter 15: Special Considerations for Forests and Jungles 283
Cutting bamboo
In the tropics, you build just about everything out of bamboo 
cane, and the act of cutting bamboo cane is a fine art that 
requires a lot of technique. Generally speaking, you cut at an 
angle. If you deliver the blow straight down — at a 90° angle 
to the wood — you just splinter the cane, and as soon as 
bamboo begins to splinter, it becomes exceedingly difficult to 
cut through. (If you’re in the mood for a bout of hair-pulling 
frustration, just try cutting bamboo cane the wrong way.) 
Here’s the right way:
 
1. Deliver the first blow at an angle slightly higher 
than 45°.
 
 Cut just below the joint, and cut away from the joint, 
not toward it. The farther you move away from the 
joint, the harder cutting the cane becomes.
 
2. Rotate the cane slightly and deliver another blow, at 
the same angle, so that the cuts are joined.
 
 You want to form one, continuous incision. If the cane 
is standing, you need to move your body around it to 
make this continuous incision.
 
3. Continue cutting around the joint, lengthening the 
incision until you’ve severed the cane.
 
 Firm blows made with a slight flick of the wrist at the 
end of the motion — not heavy or hard blows — are 
the best. Don’t rear back and slam the machete into 
the cane. This just causes it to splinter. Most of the 
cutting should come from your wrist at the end of the 
motion. Experienced jungle people cut cane with a 
subtle wrist motion at the end of the chop.
Making camp and shelters
 
When you’re in a tropical environment, making camp well 
before dark is absolutely critical. Keep in mind that there’s 
almost no dusk in tropical areas, especially in the jungle. 
When the sun starts to drop in the late afternoon, the clock 
begins ticking for you. Stop what you’re doing and set up 
camp at least two hours before sunset.

Part III: Surviving in Extreme Land Environments 
284
When making camp, take extra precautions to get off the 
ground. Even if you’re really in trouble and have no equipment 
at all, you can make a platform. The platform is an essential 
tool in the jungle or swamp (see Figure 15-2a). To make one, 
you want to find three or more stout trees that you can tie 
poles to. The best poles are usually bamboo canes that are at 
least 6 inches (15 centimeters) thick. Tie the poles to the trees 
so you have a rough triangle, and then use branches or other 
poles as crossbeams. You may have to use vines to make your 
platform if you don’t have rope. When building a platform, use 
square lashings. (To see how to make a square lashing, go to 
Chapter 14.)
If you can stand it, consider building a smoldering fire below 
your platform. The smoke can do much to drive away insects. 
If you can’t build a platform, try to get off the ground and lie 
in a hammock (Figure 15-2b).

Identifying Dangerous Animals 
in the Tropics
Like so many other dangerous animals, those in the tropics can 
be surprisingly hard to see. You can do a lot to protect yourself 
by using a long stick to part foliage or probe tangled bushes; 
this almost always flushes out these animals. This section iden-
tifies some of the most dangerous critters in the tropics.

 Chapter 15: Special Considerations for Forests and Jungles 285
Insects and other buggy creatures
To avoid many tropical diseases — as well as some unpleas-
ant bites and stings — you need to recognize bugs, spiders, 
and other multi-legged creatures and then take necessary pre-
cautions to avoid them. The best line of defense is to wear a 
hat and not to expose your skin.
The jungle can contain millions of species of bugs, many of 
which are giant, fairly hideous, and fascinating in a creepy 
sort of way. But the critters that are most likely to cause you 
trouble in the tropics can be relatively mundane. Here are the 
usual culprits:
 
✓ Mosquitoes: You find these nuisances throughout the 
world, even in polar regions. They’re generally more 
severe at dusk and then through the night. Never go into 
a tropical region without a proper net and antimalarial 
drugs. For info on mosquitoes swarms, see “Avoiding 
mud flats, sand traps, and other dangerous terrain,” ear-
lier in this chapter.
 
✓ Botflies: Botflies are small, hairy flies found throughout 
the Americas. They deposit their eggs under your skin, 
which hatch and grow into a larval sack about the size of a 
thumbnail. The sacks must be drained in a sterile environ-
ment, and a course of antibiotics is advised. Infestation 
usually isn’t fatal, but it’s sometimes debilitating.
 
✓ Black flies: These are small black or multicolored insects 
with bulbous bodies. They bite hard and spread river blind-
ness (see earlier section “Preventing jungle diseases”).
 
✓ Tarantulas (and other spiders): Large, furry spiders can 
be found throughout the world, not just in the tropics. 
The bite is painful but rarely fatal.
 
✓ Centipedes, millipedes, and stinging caterpillars: These 
crawling creatures administer painful stings that are 
rarely fatal. They often have small spine-like hairs on 
their backs that can seriously irritate the skin and can 
be next to impossible to get out. Always sweep these ani-
mals off your skin in the direction they’re crawling.
 
✓ Ticks: Ticks are widespread in all environments. Always 
wear a hat to keep them off your scalp, and always 
inspect yourself each evening. For more on ticks, see 
Chapter 13.

Jungle snakes
Like snakes everywhere, tropical snakes prefer dark holes or 
other tucked-away places. However, keep in mind that snakes 
in tropical areas can be arboreal — which means they’re fonder 
of trees than their dry-forest counterparts are. All the snakes 
we list in Table 15-2 are venomous. Antivenins are available for 
all of these. For more on treating snakebite, see Chapter 13.

Gators, crocs, and caimans
Alligators, crocodiles, and caimans are ambush predators. 
Generally, they strike at short range, trying to catch you 
unaware. The most dangerous areas are near water’s edge, 
where these animals wait to make their ambush. Also keep 
an eye out for large clumps of bushes near rivers; these are 
sometimes used as nests for females laying eggs.
These animals usually don’t chase their prey long distances. 
However, they have been known to chase people in the water, 
as well as capsize boats. Black caimans in the Amazon and 
saltwater crocodiles in Australia are the most dangerous. Give 
these animals a wide berth.
Leeches
Leeches are small wormlike parasites, usually black in color, 
that live in tropical and temperate waters. They attach them-
selves to your skin when you swim in streams and rivers; they 

Part III: Surviving in Extreme Land Environments 
288
suck your blood until they’ve had their fill, and then they fall 
off. Sometimes leeches can be found on the ground, too, or in 
dense, water-covered vegetation.
 
The best way to avoid leeches is to stay out of the water as 
much as you can. If you do go into the water, even if you’re 
just crossing a stream, keep your skin covered and the cuffs 
of your pants cinched tightly around your boots. Leeches can 
also find their way into the water supply, so as always, strain 
and boil your water thoroughly. Leeches can make you quite 
ill in the bowels if accidentally swallowed.
Like ticks, leeches have a way of working into strange places 
on your body, so take a moment each night to examine your-
self thoroughly. You can remove them by applying salt, alco-
hol, kerosene, or gasoline, or you can burn them off with a lit 
cigarette or burning ember. Do not attempt to pull leeches off 
with your fingers — always allow them to disengage and roll 
away. If you pull them off, the animal’s jaws may stay inside 
your skin and cause infection.
Piranhas
Piranhas are small fish, ranging from 8 inches to 1.5 feet 
(20 centimeters to 0.5 meters) in length. They’re found in 
the Amazon, Orinoco, and Paraguay Rivers, as well as the 
tributaries of those rivers. Though they’re nowhere near as 
dangerous as their legendary reputation suggests, they do 
nevertheless bite humans with their large, razor-sharp teeth, 
which causes infection.
Piranhas have developed a reputation of being especially 
dangerous when water levels are low and when the victim is 
bleeding, although precautions should be taken at all times. 
Stay out of waters where locals say piranhas live, and be care-
ful crossing shallow streams. Like elsewhere in the wild, we 
recommend you wear tall, stout boots and long pants.

old is simply an absence of heat energy, and you can 
feel cold in just about any environment on Earth. In 
this chapter, we focus on snowy environments, which you 
can encounter in around half of all the land masses in the 
Northern Hemisphere and somewhat less in the Southern 
Hemisphere. You can find snow even in unexpected places — 
both Hawaii and Australia offer snow skiing — so being 
prepared for cold is always a good idea. In this chapter, we 
cover methods for surviving in cold, snowy wildernesses.
 
When you’re cold, you have to do something. Don’t try to 
just force your way through the sensation of cold — it’s your 
body’s signal that something is wrong, and you may not have 
much time to solve the problem. Take action.
Staying Warm
Keeping your body warm is your first priority in a cold-weather 
survival situation. If you become hypothermic in extreme cold 
or wind chill, survival can become an epic battle. The following 

Part III: Surviving in Extreme Land Environments 
290
are general principles to remember for staying warm outdoors 
(also be sure to check out Chapter 4 for important info on 
cold-weather dressing):
 
✓ Breathe through your nose and wear a scarf. Breathing 
through your nose conserves body moisture, and wrapping 
a scarf or other cloth across your nose and mouth can 
cut the chill so that the coldest air doesn’t hit your lungs 
directly.
 
✓ Stay dry. Wet clothing cools your body faster than just 
about anything else, so if you get wet, get under some 
shelter, make a fire, and dry out your clothes. If you don’t 
have the option of making a fire, try to keep moving — 
this may help to dry damp clothes, but soaked clothes 
really need to be properly dried out.
 
✓ Eat and drink. Keeping the body fueled and hydrated 
can prevent most cold injuries! If you have food, eat it — 
eating keeps the body’s fires stoked. From your food 
supply, choose the food that has the most calories. 
Drinking lots of liquid keeps your body hydrated, which 
can forestall hypothermia.
 
✓ Get out of the wind. Wind rapidly sucks heat away from 
the body, so take shelter when there’s wind; if you can’t 
take shelter, try to improvise a windproof layer for your 
clothing.
 
✓ Loosen your footwear. Tighter footwear constrains the 
blood vessels that would normally carry warm blood to 
the feet, leading to frostbite. So when it gets cold, loosen 
your laces. But be careful to keep the top of your footwear 
sealed around your calves so that cold air, snow, and ice 
can’t get in. Duct tape or any strong cordage works well.
 
✓ Protect your hands and feet. These are the first to go 
when your body gets cold, and because you can’t really 
travel with frozen feet or do anything at all with frozen 
hands, you have to protect them. Mittens are normally 
warmer than gloves, something to keep in mind when 
you prepare to go outdoors in the first place. Gloves 
under windproof mittens are ideal.
 
✓ Stay active. If your clothes aren’t providing enough 
warmth, you can temporarily stay active to warm up; but 
don’t do so much that you sweat, which dampens your 
clothes. Stay out of the wind while getting your heart rate 
(and heat rate) up.

Cold Comfort: Making Your 
Shelter in a Snowy Environment
In cold areas, a shelter is as much psychological as it is 
physical (well maybe not, but nearly so!). One of the first 
things you notice in a snow shelter is how quiet it is. Coming 
in out of wind and storm — and into a warm, quiet place — 
is a tremendous relief. This section first walks you through 
some general building principles. We then describe three 
main ways to use snow to make a shelter.
Grasping snow shelter basics
You may think that a snowy landscape provides no shelter, 
but the snow itself can provide a home. Snow, which is 
composed of loosely piled granules of frozen water crystals, 
traps air, which is a good insulator. That’s why you can use 
snow to make a great, warm survival shelter. Just remember 
these important tips, whatever shelter you build:
 
✓ Build your shelter in a safe location. Stay away from 
avalanche slopes, and if you’re on a frozen lake or 
sea surface, build on thick ice. Later, in the section 
“Avoiding avalanche terrain,” we cover assessing snowy 
environments for the likelihood of these catastrophic 
snow-slides, which can bury your shelter under feet of 
snow in an instant.
 
✓ Keep the shelter as small as is practical. A large shelter is 
nice and roomy, but to make it warm, you have to warm 
more air than in a smaller shelter. Keep your shelter 
roomy enough so you can sit up, work on gear, and so 
on, but don’t make it much bigger. Opting for a small 
shelter also saves you work when you’re building your 
shelter.
 
✓ Keep your shelter ventilated (see Figure 16-1a). Burning 
a camp stove or other fuel in your shelter can lead to an 
excess of carbon dioxide (a colorless, odorless, lethal 
gas), so carefully poke several ventilation holes in the 
shelter’s roof with a long pole. A ski pole is thin, so you 
may need more than eight or ten holes.

Part III: Surviving in Extreme Land Environments 
292
 
 Keep your eyes open for the signs of carbon monoxide 
poisoning, which include a splitting headache, nausea, 
dizziness, and weakness — if you notice these, get 
outside fast and then vent that shelter!
 
✓ Keep a digging-out tool inside your shelter (Figure 
16-1b). Heavy snow — or in the worst case, avalanche — 
can trap you inside a shelter, so always store a digging 
tool in your shelter. You can improvise a digging tool 
simply from several stout branches lashed together with 
cordage (see Chapter 14 for tips on lashing), or you can 
use a helmet, a license plate, or even a cooking pot.
 
✓ Block the entrance of your shelter (Figure 16-1c). Just 
covering the entrance/exit hole of your shelter with your 
backpack and perhaps some heavy brush is a great aid 
in trapping warm air inside; a snow shelter with an open 
door isn’t much better than a refrigerator. Don’t block 
the door until you’re satisfied that you have the shelter 
properly ventilated.
 
✓ Make a cold trap in your shelter (Figure 16-1d). Warm 
air rises and cold air sinks, and you can use this knowledge 
to improve your shelter by making a cold trap at the 
lowest point of the floor. A cold trap is simply a basin, 
trench, or other hole in the snow floor of your shelter 
that traps the coldest air in the shelter; don’t stand in the 
cold trap unless you want to chill your feet.
 
✓ Make your shelter visible. Snow shelters can blend 
right into the landscape, so make your position visible to 
rescue personnel. For example, lay out giant symbols in 
the snow using dye markers, charcoal from your fire, or 
sod from beneath the snow. Or securely peg a brightly 
colored piece of cloth or tarp to the top of the shelter. 
See Chapter 12 for more on signaling.
 
✓ Insulate yourself from the snow. Never sit or sleep 
directly on snow; use anything — such as pine boughs, 
a bed of moss, seat cushions, the fireproof hood liner 
from a car, or an extra blanket — to stay off the snow 
(Figure 16-1f). When you’re sitting, place a backpack or 
other insulating object between your back and the wall of 
the shelter.

 Chapter 16: The Big Chill: Enduring in Snowy Places 293
 
✓ Keep your shelter organized. At the least, designate a 
place to store the first-aid kit, your wilderness survival 
kit (see Chapter 2), and any items you have for signaling 
passing aircraft or other potential rescuers. Keep these 
items in the designated places; you don’t want to be 
scrambling around in the dark interior of a snow shelter 
for your signal mirror when you hear the sweet sound of 
a helicopter!
 
 You can customize any snow shelter by building in 
conveniences such as niches — little cavities cut in the 
side of the shelter to store gear or food — and hangers, 
which can just be sturdy sticks stuck in the walls, on 
which you can hang equipment. These modifications get 
your gear up off the floor and make it easier to find what 
you need when you need it.

Making a snow-cave
A snow-cave is the simplest snow shelter, and it’s entirely 
capable of keeping you warm enough to stay alive indefinitely. 
A snow-cave is basically a burrow inside a snowdrift or a pile 
of snow. You can either burrow into a naturally occurring 
snowdrift or build your own mound of snow.

Part III: Surviving in Extreme Land Environments 
294
To make a snow-cave shelter, you need a digging tool, such 
as a helmet, ski, snowshoe, cooking pot, several strong green 
sticks (cut from a tree) lashed together, or even the glove-
compartment door from a car. The best tool, of course, is a 
mountaineer’s snow shovel, which is small enough to strap 
to a backpack (the handle telescopes out) and very strongly 
built — we won’t even travel in snow country without one. 
The best, made by Life-Link (www.life-link.com), have metal 
blades that don’t break. Plastic shovel blades eventually do.
 
Consider stripping off a layer of clothing before you start 
working. Making any kind of snow shelter is heavy work that 
can make you sweat, and wet clothing quickly cools your 
body. Also, you’ll probably be covered in snow after all the 
digging that’s involved, and that snow can melt from your 
body heat, leaving you wet.
Gas poisoning in the Arctic
A few winters back, I (Cameron) was 
the sole inhabitant of a remote gla-
ciological research hut on Iceland’s 
Vatnajökull glacier. One night, I 
heard a machine turn on behind a 
locked door — an electrical engine 
activated by satellite control. It was 
hard to sleep, but finally I did. I’m 
lucky I ever woke up.
About the incident, I wrote, “A few 
hours later, I woke with stinging eyes 
and aching lungs. It felt like someone 
was standing on my chest. I coughed 
and hacked and lunged out the door 
leading to the antechamber. A fierce 
migraine was slowly slicing my brain 
in two. Without consciously thinking 
about it, I was suiting up, and soon 
I was crawling dizzily out the hatch 
and gulping fresh air. The first gasps 
I took in the blast of storm outside 
collared me and tugged me back 
from the brink.
“Crouched in the storm just outside 
the hatch, I realized that the gas-
powered generator’s exhaust fumes 
had filled the hut. I hated the thing 
even more, now, the deep, human 
hatred of inventions that don’t do 
as they’re told. My symptoms were 
those of carbon monoxide poison-
ing. I breathed for a minute or so 
before climbing back in and opening 
the door to the living compartment. 
This let in piles of blowing snow, but 
I didn’t care. I had to breathe.”

 Chapter 16: The Big Chill: Enduring in Snowy Places 295
Creating shelters from natural snow drifts
Wind often blows snow into dunes or drifts, which you may 
be able to use as a shelter. Before you use a natural snowdrift 
as a shelter, verify that it’s compact enough to hold its shape 
when you burrow inside. Some snowdrifts are composed of 
very loose, fluffy snow that’s of no use for a shelter.
 
To test the snow’s compactness, dig into the drift a few feet. 
You may start out in compact snow but then punch through 
a hard wind crust to find loose snow underneath. Is the roof 
constantly collapsing in like sand? Can you even keep a shape 
to the cavity you’re digging in? If not, move on and find more 
compact snow.
After you find compact snow, dig horizontally into the drift 
for about a body-length before burrowing left for half a 
body length and then right for half a body length, making an 
L-shaped burrow (see Figure 16-2). You can use the entrance 
tunnel to store your gear and food and the perpendicular 
tunnel as your sleeping and resting area.
a
b
c
d
Figure 16-2: Building an L-shaped burrow in a natural snowdrift.
 
The L-shape of the natural-drift burrow is a strategy for the 
fact that many drifts aren’t deep enough to make a large, 
round burrow inside. But if the drift is large enough, you can 
use any shape you like, though we suggest conserving your 
energy by making it only as large as you need to stay alive and 
reasonably comfortable.

Part III: Surviving in Extreme Land Environments 
296
 
Don’t forget to dig a cold trap, which is a trench you make 
in the floor of the shelter that allows the heavy, cold air to 
pool or collect beneath you, leaving the rest of the air slightly 
warmer.
Making your own snow-heap shelter
If you can’t find a natural drift, or if the snow is too loose in 
any drift you find, you can make your own snow heap. This is 
a lot of work, but it’s worth it. To make a snow-heap shelter, 
just follow these steps:
 
1. Strip off a layer of clothing and — using any tool 
you can — scoop up snow and pile it in a giant 
mound, up to 6 feet (1.8 meters) wide and 6 feet 
high (Figure 16-3a).
 
2. Put your layer back on while you let the heap settle 
for an hour or so.
 
 Go and do something else, such as finding a heavy 
pole or other tool that you can use in the next step.
 
3. When you’re back at your heap, start to compact the 
snow by tamping it down hard.
 
 Use a large pole or a snow shovel, or even climb onto 
the heap and jump up and down. You’re trying to 
make the heap as dense as you can, so it may be only 
4 feet (1.2 meters) high when you’re done
 
4. Strip off a layer of clothing again, and start burrowing 
into the side (Figure 16-3b).
 
 Make the door of your shelter face east or a little 
southeast so you can see the sky lighten with sunrise; 
this is very good for morale after a cold night.
 
5. Hollow out the inside.
 
 As you dig in, assess the compaction. Is the roof 
holding its shape? Is the tunnel collapsing? If not, 
burrow on! Your shelter is taking shape. After a foot or 
so, start excavating the interior so you have a round 
chamber with a flat floor and a dome-shaped roof 
(Figure 16-3c).

Making Fire in Cold, 
Snowy Environments
Cold itself doesn’t interfere with making fire. If you can ignite 
it, fire fuel (such as wood or animal fat) will burn no matter 
how cold it is. The main fire-making issues in cold environments 
have to do with finding fuel and getting it to burn without 
your fire melting into the snow. But don’t worry — you can 
build a fire in a cold, snowy environment with the pointers in 
this section.
Finding fuel in snowy places
Wooded areas provide plenty of fuel to burn. High in the 
mountains, though, or on open Arctic plains (the tundra 
regions), wood may be scarce or absent. You may be able to 
use the following as fuel:
 
✓ Driftwood: It may be frozen into a beach, but if you can 
pry or chop it free, it’ll probably burn.
 
✓ Tundra grasses or mosses: These are under a blanket of 
snow for much of the year, but by burrowing down, you 
can find them even in winter; twist them into compact 
“sticks” or even thick bundles — they burn better than 
loose clods.

Part III: Surviving in Extreme Land Environments 
298
 
✓ Dried animal dung: Caribou, polar bear, musk ox, and 
wolf droppings may burn.
 
✓ Animal fats: Fats such as seal blubber burn well. If you 
have the luxury of such a resource, use it sparingly — for 
example, only to cook or dry clothes but not for warmth 
unless you really need it. It burns quickly.
Getting any fuel to burn requires the fire-making skills we 
introduce in Chapter 5.
Protecting a fire from the snow
 
If you build a fire on a snowy surface, the heat quickly melts 
the snow and your fire collapses into a wet, smoky snow 
crater — not what you were after. Building a fire directly on 
ground you’ve cleared of snow and ice doesn’t work well, 
either; in the Arctic regions, this ground is usually interlaced 
with ice, and the heat of the fire melts it into a soggy mess. 
You can make fire in these situations by using the following 
methods and building the fire on the following surfaces:
 
✓ In or on a piece of metal: You can use a cooking pot 
(see Figure 16-4a); any sheet of metal stripped from a 
car, snowmobile, or airplane wreck (be sure to burn off 
potentially toxic plastics and paints before cooking over 
such a fire); or even a piece of tin foil (double it a few 
times to be sure you don’t burn right through it). If 
you have only one pot, you’ll have to find some other 
container to boil water, but if you’re just cooking food, 
you can roast it above the flames.
 
✓ On a wood platform: Build a flat platform of several 
layers of branches, each layer laid out at 90° to the last 
(as in Figure 16-4b). The log platform will catch fire 
eventually, but by using lots of logs, you can keep a small 
fire going well enough.
 
✓ On a slab or bed of rock: Exposed rock slabs work 
fine. You can make a bed of rock by setting small rocks 
together on a flat snow surface, as in Figure 16-4c.

Don’t Eat the Yellow Snow: 
Safe-to-Drink Snow and Ice
Locating clean drinking water is essential in any wilderness 
setting. You may be in a cold tundra with pristine white snow 
everywhere, but before you grab a big handful and start 
eating, take a moment to read this section.
Choosing and treating 
frozen water sources
Microbes can live in the coldest places on Earth, so before 
you eat snow or drink melted ice, make sure you disinfect 
it with iodine crystals or the other methods we describe in 
Chapter 7. Whatever method you use, keep these points in 
mind:
 
✓ Select clean snow. You don’t want snow that has been 
discolored by urine or feces (either yours, from around 
camp, or that of other animals). Snow can be discolored 
pink (watermelon snow), black, brown, or yellow by 
cold-climate algae. Some people feel nauseous after 
consuming these.
 
✓ Select non-salt ice. If you’re near frozen seashore, 
remember that sea ice is salty, but over a period of years, 
the salt leaches out. Salty ice is gray or white, but blue or 
glassy ice should be safe to melt and drink.

Part III: Surviving in Extreme Land Environments 
300
 
 You can chip off a small piece of sea ice and taste it for 
saltiness. But be careful — eating ice causes a loss of 
body heat, so make the pieces small. And choose your 
ice wisely so you don’t have to repeat the tasting process 
more than once or twice.
Melting snow and ice
 
Never eat snow in extreme cold unless you’re in a warm 
shelter or have other ways to keep warm beside just your 
body heat. No amount of snow will provide enough water to 
quench your thirst, so in cold environments, you have to melt 
snow and ice to stay hydrated.
 
Ice is denser than snow, so it yields more water than snow when 
you melt it. If you can’t find ice, then choose snow that’s as 
densely packed as possible. The denser the snow, the higher the 
water yield. Here are several main methods to melt snow or ice:
 
✓ In a pot over a fire: Always use a lid to keep as much 
heat in the pot as possible.
 
✓ In a cloth bag next to a fire: Hang snow or ice in a 
bundle of porous (nonwaterproof) cloth next to a fire and 
catch the melt in a container. This works if you have, for 
example, a plastic container (such as a milk jug or soda 
bottle) but no metal pan to melt in.
 
✓ In a container you keep next to your body: Packing 
some snow into a bottle that you keep next to your body 
overnight (inside your sleeping bag or blankets) can 
yield some liquid water and keeps it from freezing.
 
✓ In the sun: If you have a black or dark-colored plastic 
bag and the temperature isn’t too cold, you can pack 
snow into the bag and leave it out in the sun.
Steering Clear of Cold-
Environment Terrain Hazards
Cold, snowy environments present a number of special 
hazards for the survivor, some of them lethal. With the basic 
information in this section, however, you can avoid this 
dangerous terrain altogether.

 Chapter 16: The Big Chill: Enduring in Snowy Places 301
If you encounter a whiteout and your visibility drops to nearly 
zero in the blowing snow, you need to stop moving and wait it 
out. See Chapter 24 for tips on surviving a whiteout.
Avoiding avalanche terrain
 
Avoid avalanche terrain at all times. You just can’t fight tons 
of snow moving according to the laws of gravity! You don’t 
want to be anywhere near avalanche terrain, and you don’t 
want to set your camp up under avalanche slopes, either. 
Luckily, it’s often pretty easy to assess whether your 
campsite is safe and whether the snow-slope you’re about 
to try to cross is at risk of avalanching.
 
An avalanche is a mass of sliding snow (and ice, tree trunks, 
mountaineers, and anything else it picks up) that can move 
down a mountainside with lethal velocity. It occurs when a 
new layer of snow doesn’t bond well with the snow it settles 
on. After accumulating for a while, the new layer simply slips 
off the old layer, headed downhill.
People caught in avalanche are normally killed either by 
trauma (being swept along until they’re slammed into a tree 
or simply knocked on the head) or suffocation. Suffocation 
occurs when the snow stops moving and settles; if a person is 
buried under the surface, the snow can prevent breathing.
The following avalanche-hazard notes apply worldwide 
(and Figure 16-5 shows these points visually):
 
✓ Avalanches normally occur on slopes from 30° to 40° in 
steepness, but some occur on slopes as low as 20°.
 
✓ Most avalanches occur from 12 to 48 hours after a heavy 
snowfall (over 6 inches, or 15 centimeters, or so).
 
✓ Many people killed in avalanches trigger the avalanches 
themselves by walking or skiing in avalanche-prone 
snow.
 
If you can’t avoid avalanche terrain and you find yourself 
having to cross a snow slope that you think may avalanche, 
take some precautions:

Part III: Surviving in Extreme Land Environments 
302
 
✓ Unfasten your backpack buckles so you can cast aside 
your backpack if needed (it can drag you down in an 
avalanche).
 
✓ Zip up all your clothes and pockets (these can fill with 
snow and drag you down).
 
✓ Test the slope by listening to the snow under your boot. 
Is there a crump or whump sound? If so, get out of there! 
This may well indicate that one layer is settling on top of 
another.
 
✓ Trail a long rope or string so that if you’re buried, 
someone may be able to follow the string to you.
 
✓ Cross the slope one at a time so that if the slope 
avalanches, not everyone is endangered at the same 
time.
Make your way across the slope. Try not to panic; this is very 
scary. After you reach more solid terrain on the other side, 
the next person should come across in your footsteps, or a 
little higher up the slope. As soon as everyone is across, get 
out of there and don’t come back!
For advice on surviving an avalanche, flip to Chapter 24. 
Finding and digging people out of avalanches is a topic for 
a whole other book; you can start with detailed advice in

Staying off thin ice
Falling through thin ice (ice over a stream or lake, for example) 
is a terrible survival scenario. The definitive studies of Dr. 
Gordon Giesbrecht, at the University of Manitoba, have 
identified exactly what happens: The body goes into cold 
shock, leading to hyperventilation, gasping reflex, and possible 
cardiac overload, panic, and death. Every person is different, 
though. The cold shock response may not come for a few 
minutes, so use those minutes wisely to get out of the situation 
(check out Chapter 22 for more on cold shock response).
 
Do your best not to fall through the ice in the first place. 
Here’s how to avoid this terrible fate:
 
✓ If you can see how thick the ice is, make sure it’s thick 
enough for your activity. You may be able to spot the 
thickness of ice if it’s clear, or you may spot some broken 
ice somewhere. Conditions vary, but here are estimates 
of how thick the ice needs to be:
 
• Walking: Avoid freshwater ice that’s less than 4 
inches (10 centimeters) thick or saltwater ice less 
than 6 inches (15 centimeters) thick.
 
• Driving a snowmobile: Avoid freshwater ice that’s 
less than 6 inches thick or less than 1 foot (30.5 
centimeters) for sea ice.
 
• Driving a car or truck: Avoid ice that’s less than 1 
foot thick.
 
✓ Keep an eye on the color of the ice. In Wisconsin, where 
people spend a lot of time ice-fishing (and therefore 
wandering around on the surface of frozen lakes), folks 
say, “Thick and blue, tried and true; thin and crispy, way 
too risky.”
 
✓ Be extra-careful when the ice is covered with snow, 
which can mask or hide the ice’s true color or texture. 
On sea ice, stay away from dark, smooth ice that forms 
thin plates directly over seawater.
 
✓ Don’t walk on ice without using a probe. Use a hard 
pole that you use to test the ice ahead every few steps.

Part III: Surviving in Extreme Land Environments 
304
If you need to get someone else out of ice, don’t rush to his or 
her aid! Take a second to think through the situation. Here’s 
what to do:
 
✓ Calm down. Take a deep breath. Look for any long item — 
a rope or pole or branch for example — that you can 
use to reach the victim. If you have a rope, tie something 
to the end (to give it a little weight) and throw it to the 
victim or slide it to that person across the ice. If you 
don’t have a rope and your stick is too short to reach, 
consider lashing together branches or poles.
 
✓ If you have to go for the person, get on your belly and 
slither to distribute your weight over a larger area. 
Remember that the two of you are at risk of death, so be 
extra careful.
 
✓ If you have several people available, you can reach out 
to the victim like a human chain. Each person holds the 
next person’s ankles, all spread out on their bellies on 
the ice.
After getting out of the ice, anyone who’s fallen through must 
get his or her clothes dry and warm up immediately. Make a 
shelter and a fire and treat the victim for hypothermia and 
shock (see Chapter 13 for treatment details).
Avoiding cornices
When you’re traveling in snowy mountains, you want to stay 
on ridges, the spines between mountain peaks. That’s because 
avalanches slide down the sides of mountains, and on the 
ridge tops, you really can’t get avalanched. However, when 
you’re on ridges, you want to be aware of cornices and avoid 
them at all costs. Cornices are unstable ledges of snow that 
can form on ridges. Figure 16-6 shows where cornices form 
and how to avoid them.
Glacial cracks: Avoiding crevasses
Crevasses are cracks in glaciers, which are vast rivers of ice 
that creep down from mountainous terrain. Crevasses are 
normally V-shaped, so if you fall in, you continue to fall until 
your body wedges in tightly at the bottom. Obviously, you 

 Chapter 16: The Big Chill: Enduring in Snowy Places 305
want to stay out of crevasses in the first place, and the best 
way to do that is to stay off glaciers. If you plan to climb on 
one, you should have extensive mountaineering experience.

If you find yourself trapped on a glacier — for example, if 
you’ve crashed a plane on one — your best bet is to stay put 
and signal for help — you’ll stand out against the snow and 
ice. If you decide to move for some reason, keep the following 
in mind:
 
✓ Try to get off the glacier. Estimate the distance to the 
surrounding ridges and other rocky terrain and head for 
them.
 
✓ Avoid snow bridges if possible. A snow bridge is a 
natural bridge of snow across a crevasse. These features 
can be exceedingly risky to cross (however firm they 
look, they can collapse at any moment, just like in a 
Hollywood movie), so try to find another way. If you see 
no other way, wait until night, when the snow is frozen 
more solidly. Go across on your belly to spread out your 
weight.

Part III: Surviving in Extreme Land Environments 
306
 
✓ Don’t use a rope to make a bridge crossing “secure.” 
Tying a rope to someone else while that person crosses a 
snow bridge will probably (if the snow bridge collapses) 
just result in both people falling into the crevasse; the 
first will drag the second in unless you have specialized 
mountaineering gear and training.
Dealing with snow slopes
If you’re in a snowy survival situation and you have to deal 
with a steep slope, you can use the following pointers to give 
you a little edge:
 
✓ Ascend or descend steeper slopes by step-kicking. Kick 
the first third of your boot into the snow with each step. 
Face the slope and keep three points of contact at all 
times (at least one foot and both hands).
 
✓ Cross steeper slopes by step-kicking carefully with the 
side of your boot at every step. Use a staff or pole of 
some kind to keep your balance, as in Figure 16-7a.
a
Keep feet wide for balance
b
Figure 16-7: Dealing with steep snow slopes by step-kicking (a) 
and glissading (b).
A slope doesn’t have to be steep to cause trouble. If you slip 
and start sliding down, stopping can be tough — you may fall 
thousands of feet. The best way to descend a low-angle slope 
is to glissade, or slide down, basically on your hind end. Here 
are two ideas to keep in mind:

 Chapter 16: The Big Chill: Enduring in Snowy Places 307
 
✓ Control your speed with a very heavy wooden pole. 
A metal rod or a ski pole works fine. Just grasp it firmly 
(fit it with a wrist loop) and lean on it as you descend, 
as Figure 16-7b shows. Go slowly while glissading — you 
may be headed for a cliff!
 
✓ Stop sliding if the terrain gets steeper. Dig in hard with 
the pole. If you’re going fast, whatever you do, don’t dig 
in your heels — that just catapults you forward!
Making Wearable Tools for 
Cold-Weather Survival
If you’re in a wilderness survival situation, sometimes the 
smallest tool can do wonders for you. And often, these special 
tools don’t require a lot of extra supplies or work — just a 
little patience and ingenuity. The special tools in this section, 
which are all clothing-based, can really help you in cold 
environments and stack the odds in your favor.
Creating footwear
You can’t travel if your feet are frozen, and sinking into the 
snow makes walking a cold, wet, exhausting ordeal. In this 
section, we explain how to assemble footwear to protect your 
feet and help you make tracks.
Making your own snow boots
If you can’t loosen your shoes to increase circulation and you 
constantly feel your feet are frozen, taking off your shoes and 
making your own boots from heavy cloth or any other flexible 
material is a good idea. To make your own boots, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Lay out a square or rectangle of any heavy cloth 
(see Figure 16-8a).
 
2. Place a slab of bark, plastic, or other semirigid 
material on the cloth (Figure 16-8b.)
 
 This is the footbed; if your shoes really are useless in 
the situation, you can cut your shoes down to supply 
the footbed only.

Part III: Surviving in Extreme Land Environments 
308
 
3. Wearing the warmest socks you have, place your 
foot on the footbed; then put dried grass, crumpled 
newspaper, padding from a car cushion, or any other 
insulating material under, on, and around your foot 
(Figure 16-8c).
 
 You need a lot of this insulating material to stay warm, 
so don’t be skimpy. Depending on which material you 
use, you may have to change this insulation frequently 
as it gets wet or squashed flat.
 
4. Draw the sides of the boot up and around your 
ankle, and tie off with a cord (Figure 16-8d).
 
 Don’t tie so tight that you constrict blood flow.
These boots are better than nothing, but stay out of water 
while wearing them, because they fall apart more easily than 
normal boots.

Figure 16-8: Making your own snow boots.
Making a pair of snowshoes
Snowshoes spread your weight over a large area, allowing you 
to walk on top of the snow instead of punching through it at 
each step. Functional snowshoes are easy to fashion from a 
few sturdy branches, some good, strong cordage, and some 
patience and creativity. To make your own pair of snowshoes, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Cut two sturdy, green branches from a tree to use as 
the frame; strip them of bark.
 
 These should be about 3 feet (0.9 meters) long and 
at least 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) in diameter. Cut the 
wood from living trees, because dry wood breaks.

 Chapter 16: The Big Chill: Enduring in Snowy Places 309
 
2. Assemble the frame as Figure 16-9a shows.
 
3. Select a number of sturdy green branches (at least 
3⁄4-inch [2-centimeter] diameter) as crossbars, and 
lash them across the frame.
 
 Use natural places where the sticks branch off to 
more securely socket the crossbeams to the frame 
(Figure 16-9b).
 
4. Using heavy cordage (parachute cord is ideal), begin 
lacing across the frame, adding crossbars as needed 
(Figure 16-9c).
 
 Make a kind of web across the crossbeams. This web 
and the snowshoe frame distribute your body weight 
across the snow.
 
5. Using heavy cordage, make a kind of sling to tie your 
boot to the frame.
 
 A sturdy loop over the toe section may be all you need 
(Figure 16-9d). Keeping the heel free allows for a more 
natural walking motion, though while getting used to 
snowshoes, shuffling your feet is easier. Don’t tie your 
boot so tightly to the snowshoe that it cuts off your 
circulation — this causes frostbite.
a
b
d
c
Figure 16-9: Making your own snowshoes.
 
Snowshoes can be difficult to get used to, but they’re worth 
it; half an hour of postholing, going thigh-deep at each step, 
through deep snow will tell you that in a hurry. While you get 
used to your snowshoes, you may well want to use a pair of 
wooden poles, one in each hand, to keep your balance. After a 
while, you won’t need them.

Part III: Surviving in Extreme Land Environments

Boot wraps: Making and wearing gaiters
Gaiters are garments that wrap over the top of your boots 
to prevent gravel, dirt, and snow/ice from getting into your 
boots; in snowy environments, this can be particularly 
important because you really want to keep your feet dry and 
warm. You can create your own by following these steps:
 
1. Cut a piece of heavy cloth, flexible plastic, or even 
cardboard to the shape and size in Figure 16-10a; 
puncture two holes in the tabs on the lower margin.
 
2. Roll the fabric into a tube and sew up the loose ends.
 
 Make sure the tube is big enough around that you can 
slide it up to your knee and that it fits over the top of 
your boot (Figure 16-10b).
 
3. Take off your boot and slip the gaiter up your leg; 
then put your boot back on.
 
4. Slip the gaiter down and over the boot-top; tie a 
length of cordage under the boot, connecting the 
two tabs, to keep the gaiter from coming off 
(Figure 16-10c.)
a
b
c
Figure 16-10: Making your own gaiters.
Insulating your clothing
Air is a good insulator, and anything that you can use to 
trap air next to your clothing can keep you warmer. Insulate 
clothing by adding a second layer to any garment and stuffing 
the gap between them with loose material, such as bunched 
up grasses, crumpled paper (though this becomes useless if it 
gets wet, so replace it as needed), or crumpled pine needles. 
These hold the layers of the garment apart, allowing a pocket 
of air between them.

 Chapter 16: The Big Chill: Enduring in Snowy Places 311
Protecting your face and eyes
Snow is white because it reflects nearly all the light that 
strikes it, and all those bouncing rays of sunlight can cause 
sunburn and damage your vision. In this section, we tell you 
how to make tools that reduce the glare and protect your face 
from the sun, wind, and cold.
 
Sunblock is extremely important in polar regions because 
the sun reflects off the snow and ice, quickly causing severe 
burns. Be sure to carry sunblock (or improvise it, as we 
describe in Chapter 17), even in cold weather.
Making a balaclava
When improvising headgear for the cold, make a balaclava, a 
head garment that’s snug around the face and entirely covers 
the head and neck. You can make one from the leg of a spare 
pair of pants or stitch together any sheet of plastic or cloth, 
as we show you in Figure 16-11.
Figure 16-11: An improvised balaclava.
Carving snow-glare goggles
 
Light reflecting from snow can temporarily blind you; this 
can happen on an overcast day as easily as on a sunny day. 
Always wear eye protection in snowy terrain. Snow blindness 
(retinal sunburn) is very painful. The main symptom is 
extreme pain in the eyes, as though hot sand grains have been 
packed under your eyelids. The cure is to rest with the eyes 
closed, perhaps wearing a blindfold. Twelve to 48 hours of 
rest should be enough, allowing you to see again.

Part III: Surviving in Extreme Land Environments 
312
You can avoid snow blindness by always wearing sunglasses 
and/or goggles in snowy terrain. If you don’t have goggles, 
you can make them very easily from a piece of cardboard, 
leather, heavy cloth, or pliable plastic, using the steps here:
 
1. Cut a slab of bark, plastic, cardboard, or other 
semi-pilable material into a bar about 8 inches 
(20 centimeters) across and 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 
centimeters) high (Figure 16-12a).
 
2. Cut slits into the material, about eye distance apart 
(Figure 16-12b).
 
3. Tie a headband onto the goggles by perforating 
the ends and tying cordage through them 
(Figure 16-12c).
a

c
Figure 16-12: Improvising snow goggles.
Making mittens out of socks
If you have spare socks, you can make mittens to keep your 
hands warm. Mittens are normally warmer than gloves and 
are easy to improvise. Simply cut a slit in the sock for the 
thumb. Then sew up the slit so that the thumb has its own 
compartment.

Staying Alive under the Sun
In This Chapter
▶ Protecting yourself from the dangers of sunlight and dehydration
▶ Finding or building shelter in the desert
▶ Finding food and water in the desert
▶ Safely crossing desert terrain in the cool of the night
Y
ou face unique challenges in hot desert regions. 
Dehydration is always a threat because water is scarce 
and the heat makes you sweat. But deserts aren’t always 
just hot. Believe it or not, you have to be ready for very cold 
nights as well, which make you hypothermic in short order. 
These regions are also home to some hard-to-see animals that 
strike quickly with dangerous, sometimes lethal, poisons.
In this chapter, we show you how to protect yourself from 
the sun, make shelter, find food and water, and avoid certain 
critters. We also show you how to hike your way safely across 
desert terrain in the dark, when it’s cooler.
Knowing the Dangers the 
Sun and Heat Pose
Your body reacts to overheating by sweating and dilating 
your blood vessels to expel more heat from your system. If 
the body becomes so hot that these methods can no longer 
dump excessive heat, injury can occur. Overheating can be 
just as deadly as hypothermia (excessive cold).

Part III: Surviving in Extreme Land Environments 
314
The heat and sun can threaten your well-being in three ways: 
sunburn, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke. This section helps 
you grasp what the sun and heat can do to you if you don’t 
take action.
 
If you have a good supply of water with you, you can prevent 
most heat injuries simply by drinking an adequate quantity of 
liquid.
Going skin deep with sunburn
Sunburn is a common heat malady that can become 
debilitatingly painful. You can easily prevent sunburn by 
wearing the correct clothing and using sunblock (see the 
later section titled “Wearing Sun Shields”).
 
If you do get sunburned, treat the burn by draping a cloth 
soaked in water over the affected areas. Juice from the aloe 
vera plant can sometimes give you relief from the pain, 
although some evidence suggests that aloe vera can slow the 
healing process.
Overheating your body with 
heat exhaustion and stroke
Heat exhaustion and heat stroke are forms of hyperthermia, an 
excessive heating of the body. Heat exhaustion can turn into 
heat stroke, which can lead to brain damage and death. Here’s 
how to recognize and treat these problems.
Recognizing the symptoms of hyperthermia
Heat exhaustion is indicated by one or all of these symptoms:
 
✓ Pale and perhaps clammy skin
 
✓ Racing pulse
 
✓ Dizziness and/or headache
 
✓ Nausea and/or diarrhea
 
A person with heat exhaustion isn’t always sweating 
profusely; the body may have already used up its water 
supply prior to reaching heat exhaustion.

 Chapter 17: Staying Alive under the Sun 315
Heat stroke is a more dire condition than heat exhaustion, and 
it’s indicated by the following:
 
✓ A red, flushed look to the skin
 
✓ Shock
 
✓ Extreme mental disorientation or unconsciousness
 
✓ Very dark urine
 
✓ Body temperature over 103°F (39.4°C)
 
Use your first aid kit thermometer to take a rectal temperature 
and monitor it carefully; anything over 103°F is potentially 
life-threatening, so keeping the body cool, wet, and rested is 
critical.
Cooling off
If the person has heat exhaustion or heat stroke, do the 
following to treat it:
 
✓ Get the person out of the sun.
 
✓ Loosen the clothing.
 
✓ Cool the body with liquid. Applying warm to tepid water 
to the skin and then fanning it may be the best course 
of action. You can substitute alcohol or soda if water is 
scarce.
 
✓ Fan the body vigorously, or if you’re the victim, fan 
gently to avoid overexerting yourself.
 
✓ Massage the body to keep the blood circulating.
 
✓ Rehydrate the exhausted person with cool water.
When the body temperature is below 102°F (38.9°C), you can 
stop the cooling with water treatments (both applying it to 
the skin and drinking it), but be sure to monitor temperature 
carefully, because a person may go back into heat stroke.
If your survival situation doesn’t allow you copious amounts 
of water to cool a heat-stressed person, you have to decide 
what’s more important: long-term water conservation or 
saving the person right now.

Part III: Surviving in Extreme Land Environments 
316
Wearing Sun Shields
The first step in protecting your body from the sun is to dress 
appropriately. You should also cover your exposed skin with 
some kind of sunblock, whether you’ve packed some SPF 50 
lotion or have to improvise some from your surroundings. 
This section tells you how to wear your sun defenses.
Cool clothes for hot times: 
Dressing for desert survival
Your first thought may be to strip down while in a desert to 
avoid overheating, but actually, you have to shield yourself 
from the sun’s rays. Dress yourself from head to toe in clothing 
that shields you from the sun. You can find out how in 
Chapter 4 and with the tips we show you here (see Figure 17-1):
 
✓ Hat or head covering: To improvise a head covering 
to keep your brain from cooking, you can use a t-shirt: 
Simply put the neck of the upturned t-shirt on your head 
and drop the rest of the t-shirt behind your head, fully 
protecting your neck and ears. Alternately, you can sew 
stiff fabric, cardboard, or even pliable plastic, cut to 
shape with a knife, into a ball cap.
 
✓ Sunglasses or goggles and a mask: Sunglasses or even 
goggles protect you from becoming sunblind. If you don’t 
have sunglasses or goggles, you can improvise them (see 
Chapter 16). You can also improvise a cloth mask to keep 
the dust and sand out of your lungs (see Chapter 4).
 
✓ Shoes or sandals: These protect your feet from hard 
stones, sharp thorns, cactus spines, and hot sand and 
rocks. You can improvise footwear from many materials, 
such as wood, hard plastic, or rubber. You may be able 
to protect your legs from snakebite by making a pair of 
gaiters (that come to the calf) from heavy cloth or even 
cardboard (see Chapter 16 for more on making gaiters).
 
Don’t ditch your warm clothes! Deserts get cold at night (or 
they can), and then you face the risk of hypothermia.

 Chapter 17: Staying Alive under the Sun 317

b
Figure 17-1: Improvised hot-weather clothing for the head and feet.
 
If you have the luxury of extra water, keeping a wet cloth 
wrapped around your head can keep your brain cool. If you’re 
short on water, you may as well use urine’s cooling potential. 
Yes, that’s right: Urinate on your hat and then put it back on. 
Hey, we never said any of this wilderness survival business 
was going to be pretty. Urine is sterile when you first urinate, 
and in a desert survival situation, it evaporates before 
bacteria become problematic.
Slathering on the sunblock
You can protect yourself from the sun with any cream or 
other paste that stands between your skin and the rays of the 
sun. If you’re venturing into hot terrain, always carry a tube 
of sunblock. If you don’t have any on you, you can improvise 
sunblock from the following:
 
✓ Mud or clay: Pigs and rhinos have the right idea when 
they wallow in the mud. Smear either mud or clay on the 
skin.
 
✓ Charcoal: Grind it up (after you’ve made a fire) and 
smear it on your face, mixing it first, if possible, with 
water or motor oil.

Part III: Surviving in Extreme Land Environments 
318
 
✓ Used motor oil or axle grease: These materials, which 
you can find in cars or other vehicles, can be effective 
sunblocks.
 
Unless you want to cook yourself in the sun, don’t use baby 
oil, vegetable oil, mineral oil, or any kind of butter (such as 
cocoa) as a sunblock.
Finding Shelter in the Desert
Getting out of the sun and under a shelter is particularly 
important in a desert setting because the sun’s direct rays can 
burn your skin, and the heat dehydrates your body. Shaded 
areas may not feel cool, but they’re normally 10–20°F (5–10°C) 
cooler than areas in direct sunlight. Check out this section for 
more details.
Building a sunshade
You can make your own desert survival shelter as Figure 17-2 
shows. All you need are two large sheets of cloth or plastic 
(such as a tarp and a space blanket from your wilderness 
survival kit — see Chapter 2). To make this shelter, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Using a sturdy stick or flat rock, dig a trench in 
the ground, at least 1 foot (0.3 meters) deep, to get 
below the hot surface.
 
 This trench needs to be big enough to lie in; you must 
never rest directly on the hot surface.
 
2. Pile rocks to hold up the corners of your sheets.
 
 Pile the rocks so they hold the sheets off the ground 
and trap a layer of air between the two sheets. With 
this construction, the sun beats on only the upper 
sheet, and the space below it keeps the heat from 
blasting through and reaching you.
 
 Using a space blanket as your top layer both deflects 
the sun’s rays and creates an instant signal to any 
passing plane or car.

 Chapter 17: Staying Alive under the Sun 319
 
3. If possible, pile up sand and/or rocks to make a shel-
ter against wind.
 
 Wind can be strong and prolonged in desert areas, 
preventing sleep and wearing you down.
In windy conditions, your shelter tarps may blow away, so 
weight them down securely.
Figure 17-2: A desert shelter.
Looking for shady places
If you don’t have the resources to make the desert shelter we 
show in Figure 17-2, look for the following shady spots:
 
✓ Bushes and rock overhangs: Before you find shade, 
always evict snakes, scorpions, or other critters from 
the bush, rock overhang, or boulder by first pelting it 
with rocks or prodding it vigorously with a stick. Animals 
want that shade as much as you do.
 
 The animals you find, such as rabbits or snakes, may 
be edible, so always be prepared to kill with a club 
(see Chapter 8).
 
✓ Wrecked vehicles: Make sure all the doors and windows 
are open so breezes can blow through. Otherwise, they 
act like ovens.
 
 Anytime you’re stuck in a survival situation with a disabled 
car, be sure to leave the hood propped up, 24/7; this 
signals help to anyone who sees it.

Part III: Surviving in Extreme Land Environments 
320
 
The surface of a desert is normally about 35°F (19.4°C) hotter 
than the air a foot (30.5 centimeters) above the surface, so 
you never want to sit directly on the sand or rock. Instead, tip 
over a rock — watching out for snakes, scorpions, or other 
critters, of course — and sit on the side that was shaded. Or 
sit on a bundled-up jacket or your backpack.
Warming shelters overnight
Whatever shelter you use, be sure to make a fire in the late 
afternoon if you’re staying put for the night (if you plan to travel, 
see later section “Traveling at night”). Collect wood, brush, and 
other fuel before it gets dark, so you can see what you’re doing.
 
Do not burn wood from species of the genus Euphorbia (milk 
bush or pencil-tree) — the smoke is toxic. Before venturing 
into desert terrain, look up the milk-bush and see what they 
look like — there are many kinds!
If you’re short on fire-starting equipment, such as matches 
or lighters, pile on heavy fuel throughout the night so you’re 
always creating more coals, which you can use to restart 
the fire in the morning. Even in the desert, you should keep 
embers ready to make a smoke signal (see Chapter 12), and 
you can use a fire to cook food and purify water. For more on 
making fires, see Chapter 5.
 
If you can’t make a fire — for whatever reason — you can use 
rocks heated by the sun to stay warm overnight. Slip some 
sun-warmed rocks inside your clothes before you turn in. 
These can keep you warm through a night. As soon as they 
cool down, though, toss them out; otherwise, they suck heat 
from your body.
Finding Water in the Desert
Though deserts may lack flowing water, every desert does 
have some moisture — moisture you need to keep cool and 
slake your thirst. You just need to know where and how to 
find it. This section gives you some water-finding methods 
that are particularly useful in deserts. Chapter 7 covers 
general methods to collect and purify water (including info 
on gathering dew, which can work in a desert).

 Chapter 17: Staying Alive under the Sun 321
 
In the desert, dehydration can kill you in hours. You must 
prevent dehydration at all costs, even at the risk of getting a 
water-borne disease. Even in hot, arid places, we advise you 
to filter and purify all water you find in the wild. However, if 
you’re on the verge of perishing from dehydration and you 
have nothing to purify your water with, just drink unpurified 
water. Purifying water usually requires you to boil it (which 
may boil away all that you have in the desert) or put chemicals 
in it (chemicals you may not have). Unpurified water can give 
you a wide variety of diseases, but if you’re facing death by 
dehydration right now, you’d better just take your chances.
Discovering standing water
When looking for water, one of the best places to start with is 
standing water. Huecos are holes in rocks or the ground that 
contain standing water. Even in the driest-appearing deserts, 
you can usually find such water in three main areas:
 
✓ River courses: Wet mud or sand, and even pools of 
water, can stand for a long time wherever rock or canyon 
walls hang over the riverbed. (“Squeezing water from 
mud or sand,” later in this chapter, shows how to extract 
water from mud or sand.)
 
✓ Under the shade of boulders and in caves, where shade 
may prevent evaporation: Don’t venture too far into 
a dark cave, though, or you could get lost or fall into a 
hole.
 
✓ In solution pockets: Solution pockets are bowl-like 
depressions in rocks that catch rain and may contain 
anything from a cup of water to hundreds of gallons.
 
A mirage is an illusion created by heat rising from the ground, 
and you can see plenty in desert terrain (they can also occur 
on open, snowy plains). A common — and frustrating — 
desert mirage is that of a distant pool of water, shimmering 
on the horizon. Don’t change your course to head toward an 
oasis you think you see on the horizon unless it’s accompanied 
by lots of thick, green vegetation.

Part III: Surviving in Extreme Land Environments 
322
Locating water underground
You may be able to discover some water in river courses that 
appear dry. Figure 17-3 shows you where you may be able to 
find water. Dig in the outside bends of turns in the riverbed — 
the outside bend often undercuts the riverbank, providing 
shade and preventing all the water from evaporating.
Flow
Figure 17-3: The most likely place to find water in an apparently dry river-
bed.
Sometimes, palm trees can indicate the presence of water as 
well. You can often find water about 3 feet (0.9 meters) below 
a palm tree of any type.
 
To access underground water, dig down several feet, using a 
stick, a flat rock, or some other tool to preserve your hands. 
If you find wet sand, wait awhile; water may seep into your 
excavation, filling it like a basin. If the water doesn’t seep 
into the excavation, you can either try digging deeper or in 
another spot, or you can try to squeeze water from damp 
sand or mud.
Squeezing water from 
mud or sand
You can extract water that remains frustratingly locked in 
sand or mud. Simply pile some wet sand or mud on a cloth, 
and then roll the cloth around the sand or mud before twisting 
it and catching the water in a receptacle (refer to Figure 17-4.)

 Chapter 17: Staying Alive under the Sun 323
Figure 17-4: Squeezing water from wet mud or sand.
Unearthing water from 
cracks in rock
You can get water from narrow cracks in rocks or very shallow 
pools by sucking water through a tube. Surgical tubing is 
ideal, as is a long straw (see Figure 17-5). If you don’t have 
tubing, sometimes you can use a hollow reed.
Figure 17-5: Using a tube to get water from a rock cranny.
You may have to suck vigorously a few times to get the water 
going. Don’t drink the water when you suck it from the cranny 
unless you’re on the verge of succumbing to dehydration. Spit 

Part III: Surviving in Extreme Land Environments 
324
the water into a receptacle and then use some method to filter 
and purify it. This, however, may be impractical. You may 
have to simply take your chances and drink it unpurified.
Making a desert solar still
You can use a solar still to recycle urine (or any other impure 
water) and make it into drinkable water. Chapter 7 discusses 
how to make a solar still. To repurpose your urine, place a 
receptacle of urine in the bottom of the still, next to the 
collection receptacle (see Figure 17-6). The heat evaporates 
the water from the urine, leaving behind the impurities; the 
clean water condenses on the plastic and drips into your 
water collector, from which you can suck up the water with a 
tube or straw.
Figure 17-6: A desert solar still for distilling pure water from urine.
Collecting water from a cactus
Hollywood cowboys often cut open cacti to drink, but only 
one cactus is really safe for this method: the barrel cactus. 
The best cactus for drinking is the fishhook barrel cactus 
(see Figure 17-7), which normally stands about 6 inches 
(15 centimeters) high and has distinctive, fishhook-like thorns.

 Chapter 17: Staying Alive under the Sun 325
Figure 17-7: The safe fishhook cactus.
To get water from a fishhook cactus, cut it open with a heavy 
knife, mash the inside with a stick, and scoop out the fleshy 
tissue onto a piece of cloth. You can then squeeze the water 
out using the method we describe in the earlier section 
“Squeezing water from mud or sand.”
 
When drinking the fluid out of a barrel cactus, take your time 
and make sure you can digest it. Some of these cacti are very 
alkaline, which can make you ill, even if you put the fluid 
through a solar still. For more on solar stills, see Chapter 7.
Finding Food in the Dry Places
Only after you’ve protected your body from the sun with 
clothing and shelter and have secured some water (or thought 
out how you’re going to get it) can you turn your thoughts to 
food. You can go weeks without food, so water always comes 
first.
 
Food requires water to digest, so if you don’t have water, 
too, don’t eat. Some experts even recommend throwing away 
or destroying your food if you don’t have water to help you 
avoid the temptation of eating! This is a pretty extreme 
measure, though — a decision best left to the circumstances 
and your judgment.
This section considers the different types of food sources you 
may find in the desert as well as some to avoid at all costs.

Part III: Surviving in Extreme Land Environments

Fruits of the desert: Eating 
cacti and other plants
The fruit of any cactus is edible. Just cut off the bulbs and 
peel the fruit, being very careful of the spines, which can be 
as fine as peach fuzz. Boiling is the safest way to consume the 
fruit.
You can eat the tender, young pads of the prickly pear cactus. 
Just peel and cook them.
 
The leaves, stems, roots, and flowers of many desert plants 
are safe to eat, but many species can sicken or kill you. For 
instance, species of the genus Euphorbia (commonly known 
as milk bush or pencil-tree) are poisonous. So before you eat 
any plants, check them with the Universal Plant Edibility Test 
in Chapter 8. Remember: Some fungi do grow in the desert, 
but don’t eat them or use the Universal Plant Edibility Test on 
them — they can be toxic even in small amounts.
Eating insects
Insects are excellent survival foods. Here’s how to prepare 
them:
 
✓ Ants and termites: You can collect ants and termites one 
by one and eat them raw (they’re one of the few survival 
foods that are safe without cooking). Or you can mash 
them into a paste if you have a lot of them.
 
✓ Grasshoppers and beetles: The wings and legs of 
grasshoppers and beetles are a choking hazard, so 
remove them before cooking. You can boil these animals 
in water to make a soup, or to save water, broil them 
next to a fire.
 
✓ Larvae: If you find beetles, you may find beetle larvae — 
white, grub-like animals — under or inside logs or other 
pieces of wood. Simply cook and eat them as you do for 
beetles.
Stay away from bees and hornets because of their painful 
stings — you may be allergic, leading to a serious and 
sometimes life-threatening reaction.

 Chapter 17: Staying Alive under the Sun 327
Choosing poultry and eggs
All birds are edible, and so are their eggs. Remember that 
birds don’t just nest in tree branches; they may occupy a 
cavity in a cactus or tree trunk, or their nests may be under 
a bush on the ground, in a cave, or on a rock ledge. Boil the 
eggs, and broil the birds after plucking off the feathers.
Catching desert mammals
Small mammals, such as mice, are common in many deserts. 
They can be tough to catch, though — they’re so small that 
snaring them would require a very small, delicate snare. You 
can sometimes trap mice by placing a can of water or other 
bait in the bottom of a 2-foot (0.6-meter) deep, steep-sided 
hole. At night, mice are attracted by the smell of food or 
water, and as soon as they fall into the hole, they can’t get out.
Larger desert mammals include foxes and various herbivores, 
such as antelope. You may be able to snare these animals as 
well, but insects, snakes, or small mammals are much easier 
to catch. If you do catch a mammal, you can butcher and cook 
it in ways we cover in Chapter 8.
Dining on lizards and snakes
Many lizards and snakes are harmless. If you do decide to 
hunt them, make sure you know what you’re hunting. We 
don’t recommend hunting snakes because some have lethal 
bites, but if you do come across one and feel the situation is 
manageable, there’s no reason not to kill and eat it. What is a 
manageable situation, with respect to a potential killer (like 
a rattlesnake), is up to you. Your decision depends on how 
hungry, well-armed, strong, and confident you are. (See the 
next section for more on venomous reptiles.)
If you choose to eat snakes and lizards, here’s how to process 
them:
 
1. Cut off the head by cutting at the neck, several 
inches down from the base of the skull.

Part III: Surviving in Extreme Land Environments 
328
 
 The poison glands are in the head, and this gets them 
out of your way. This works for snakes as well as the 
poisonous lizards, such as the gila monster and the 
beaded lizard.
 
 Snake heads can still bite 24 hours after death, and 
lizard mouths are breeding grounds for bacteria. Bury 
the head away from your butchery and eating spot 
and mark the burial spot with a pile of stones so you 
don’t accidentally dig it up.
 
2. Strip off the skin.
 
 Start an incision, lengthwise, down the body from 
where you removed the head, and then pull the skin 
off like a sheath.
 
3. Cook it properly.
 
 Broil the carcass next to a fire or bake it underground, 
under the hot coals. When the meat is flaky, white, 
and dry, it is edible.
Avoiding Dangerous 
Desert Animals
In deserts, keep your eyes out for the following creatures, 
especially in shaded areas or at night, when desert animals 
are most active.
Gila monsters and 
slithering snakes
Most desert lizards aren’t toxic, but beware of the bite of the 
large Gila monster (see Figure 17-8) and Mexico’s very similar 
beaded lizard. Both lizards are around 1 foot (30.5 centime-
ters) long and are unlikely to attack unless provoked. Unless 
you have a weapon that you can use to kill the lizard so you 
can eat it, your safest move is to just walk away.
 
Many desert species of snakes can sicken or kill you with a 
lightning-fast bite. Especially stay away from the rattlesnake, 
which has a diamond-shaped head that’s fatter than the 
neck, as in Figure 17-8. These snakes have a lethal bite, and 

 Chapter 17: Staying Alive under the Sun 329
they make a distinctive Sssss sound with their tail-rattles as a 
warning. Many poisonous snakes don’t have diamond-shaped 
heads, though, so be cautious around any snake.
Figure 17-8: The distinctive head of a rattlesnake and a gila monster.
You can sometimes scare snakes away by making plenty 
of noise as you walk. Sturdy boots and heavy trousers can 
protect you from a bite. You can also use gaiters, which are 
fabric covers that seal the space between the trousers and the 
boots. To see how to improvise these, take a look at Chapter 16.
Stinging scorpions, centipedes, 
and spiders
Arthropods are critters with hard shells and lots of little 
jointed legs — and sometimes some pretty nasty bites and 
stings. You do have to watch out for wasps and ticks as you 
do in temperate environments (see Chapter 11), but you may 
also run into some scorpions, centipedes, and desert spiders. 
In this section, we tell you what to watch out for.
Scorpions and centipedes
What they say in the movies is true: The big, burly scorpions 
sting hard, but the small ones can be lethal. Meanwhile, 
centipedes can deliver a very painful and occasionally 
debilitating bite, to which some people can have a severe 
allergic reaction.
 
Scorpions (Figure 17-9a) and centipedes (Figure 17-9b) are 
tough to avoid in deserts, but you can take some precautions:

Part III: Surviving in Extreme Land Environments 
330
 
✓ Be vigilant with every rock you turn over — use a stick.
 
✓ Never put on a piece of clothing (such as a shirt or a 
shoe) without first checking it for scorpions and 
centipedes. Shake all your clothing and foot gear before 
putting it on — and we mean shake it vigorously so the 
fabric makes a pop! sound.
 
✓ Be especially careful between sundown and the next 
noon — that’s when most scorpion stings occur.
a
b
Figure 17-9: Watch out for scorpions (a) and centipedes (b).
Scorpion stings feel like bee stings, and less than 1 percent 
of scorpion stings in the U.S. are fatal. The symptoms of a 
serious sting, however, include the following:
 
✓ Dilation of the pupil and twitching of the eye
 
✓ Difficulty swallowing
 
✓ Heart palpitations and sweating
Treat scorpion stings and centipede bites simply by washing 
and then keeping the wound clean. Painkillers may ease the 
pain. There are antivenins for scorpion venom, but they must 
be administered by a doctor.
Spiders
The world is home to almost 40,000 spider species, some of 
which live the in desert. Most are harmless to humans, but 
some can be lethal. Dangerous spider bite symptoms include
 
✓ Dizziness, nausea and vomiting
 
✓ Fever
 
✓ Cramps, especially in the abdomen

 Chapter 17: Staying Alive under the Sun 331
Chapter 13 covers spider bite treatment. Avoid spiders by 
checking under rocks and shaking out clothing.
Wind and Water: Watching 
Out for Desert Weather
Deserts seem so calm most of the time — little wind, not 
much weather to speak of other than the relentless sun. But 
there are two real dangers you have to keep an eye out for, 
outlined in this section.
Staying high and dry 
during flash floods
A flash flood is any unexpected arrival of water on a landscape, 
and strangely enough, this is a big danger in deserts. A big 
storm can drop millions of gallons of water 100 miles away — 
while you’re being blistered by the sun — and suddenly the 
dry riverbed you’re staggering along, or sleeping in, turns into 
a raging river!
To avoid flash flood dangers, walk along the rim of a dry river 
while you assess the danger, remembering a few tips:
 
✓ Look for high-water marks. High-water marks (refer to 
Figure 17-10) include stains on rock walls or piles of 
vegetation snagged in tree limbs adjacent to watercourses, 
where vegetation floating on a prior flash flood rose up 
and got caught. Stripes in the rock may not be high-water 
marks — they may be natural rock layers — so look for 
stranded vegetation and other signs of flooding.
 
✓ Before venturing into a canyon or dry riverbed, look at 
the horizon all around for clouds. If you see low, dark 
clouds that look rainy, get back up on higher ground. The 
flash-flood water may be pouring down way over there, 
right now — just an hour from where you are.

Part III: Surviving in Extreme Land Environments 
332
Figure 17-10: High-water marks in a dry riverbed mark this canyon as a 
dangerous place to walk.
Taking shelter from sandstorms
High winds can pick up mass quantities of sand and blow 
them across deserts with tremendous force in what’s called 
a sandstorm. Some sandstorms can actually strip the paint off 
a car. If you see a giant, sand-colored wall on the horizon (for 
once, it looks just like it does in the movies!), prepare yourself 
by covering your mouth with a cloth (to filter out some sand) 
and finding some shelter. If you have to, build a wind-shelter 
from rocks. A circle or semicircle of stones large enough to lie 
behind may be enough to break some of the wind, but you still 
get covered by sand every few hours. Don’t put a tarp over 
the shelter if the wind is strong — it’ll just blow away.
 
Dense, blowing sand can interfere with radio transmissions, 
and will ground rescue aircraft anyway, so if you have a radio, 
save your batteries and wait until the storm ends to begin sig-
naling again. Sandstorms can last for days.
Finding Your Way in the Desert
The decision to travel in a survival situation is a big one 
that we cover in Chapter 11. If you do decide to move in the 
desert, the main thing to keep in mind is that you need to 

 Chapter 17: Staying Alive under the Sun 333
have a plan and stick to it. Determine the direction you want 
to travel, prepare your gear, and then stick to your plan, day 
after day — or as we suggest in this section, night after night. 
The good news is that in a desert, you can see a long way, 
allowing you to plan your trek, take compass bearings, and 
navigate more efficiently than in, say, a dense jungle. (See 
Chapters 9 and 10 for more on navigating.) This section helps 
you travel in the desert both during the day and night.
 
Whenever you make the decision to travel, be sure to leave a 
note or signal at the place where you first became lost. And 
as you travel, leave notes behind updating your progress. 
Put messages in trees or under conspicuous piles of stone so 
people can find them easily. Indicate the following:
 
✓ What direction you’re headed and why
 
✓ Who you are and what happened to you
 
✓ What supplies you have
 
✓ The date that you’re departing
Traveling at night
If you’ve committed to traveling to get out of your wilderness 
survival situation, traveling at night is a good tactic for dealing 
with hot country. Temperatures are cooler and sometimes 
downright cold in deserts at night, so your body uses less 
water — about half the water it needs when traveling in 
daylight.
For navigation, you can use the stars, which — after you know 
a few basics — are nothing less than a vast compass in the 
sky (and the stars never lie, thankfully). Chapter 10 tells you 
how to navigate by the stars.
 
Spend plenty of time during the day making your plans before 
traveling at night. Get to the highest point you can safely 
reach to give you a better vantage point, and then study the 
terrain, locating the features that can act as landmarks.
Seeing in the dark
To travel at night, you have to use night vision, which you can 
acquire by letting your eyes adjust to darkness. In the space 
of an hour of sitting in darkness — with no campfire or any 

Part III: Surviving in Extreme Land Environments 
334
other artificial light — your pupils dilate to their maximum, 
which allows your eyes to gather more light.
 
When using night vision, you have to maintain strict light 
discipline. Don’t use a flashlight or even light a match after 
you start traveling, because these lights will ruin your night 
vision.
 
If you have a red lens filter on your flashlight, you can use it 
to read maps at night without destroying your night vision. A 
red filter is simply a red-colored translucent plastic cap that 
fits over your flashlight bulb housing. If you don’t have a red 
filter, improvise one by taping red fabric over your flashlight.
Using a staff to probe ahead in darkness
When traveling at night, make sure you use a walking stick 
or staff to feel the ground in the darkness and help you keep 
your balance on uneven terrain. Using one in each hand, like 
ski poles, is also effective.
You can also use a walking stick or staff to prod bushes or 
other obstacles (or better yet, go around them) when you sus-
pect they may be home to a snake or other potentially danger-
ous animal. Remember, a lot of desert animals come out at 
night, when it’s cooler.
Confronting drop-offs
Walking at night can pose potential dangers, such as the 
inability to see that canyon in front of you. If you’re on rocky 
ground, beware of sudden drop-offs.
 
If the ground goes completely black in front of you, stop 
and feel with your walking stick or staff. You may have to go 
around an obstacle, or you may be able to judge how far a 
drop-off is by probing with a walking staff. If you can feel that 
solid ground is just a few feet down (and, by throwing a stone 
into the darkness, you can tell that it’s not just a little ledge 
leading to a high cliff!), you can proceed. But don’t jump down 
the drop-off — that’s crazy! To clamber down a 3-foot (0.9-
meter) cliff, do the following (see Figure 17-11):
 
1. Probe the ground at the bottom of the drop-off with 
your walking stick.
 
2. Turn to face the land you’re walking on and kneel 
down.

 Chapter 17: Staying Alive under the Sun 335
 
3. Hold onto the edge and shove your legs over.
 
4. Slide/lower yourself down, using your arms for 
support.
Figure 17-11: Checking height and clambering down a 3-foot drop-off.
Traveling in daylight
 
We don’t believe there’s any good reason to travel significant 
distances in deserts in daylight in a real survival situation. 
You may as well wait for cooler hours of dusk till dawn, when 
you’ll consume less water and you’re at less risk of heat 
exhaustion or heat stroke. However, if you’re forced to travel 
in the day (we can’t really think why, but it may happen):
 
✓ Watch yourself and your companions for the symptoms 
of heat exhaustion and dehydration. We discuss these 
earlier in “Knowing the Dangers the Sun and Heat Pose.”
 
✓ Protect yourself from the sun with the proper clothing. 
See the earlier section “Wearing Sun Shields.”
 
✓ Drink plenty of water. If you have the water, drink 
at least 1 gallon (4 liters) a day. You may need up to 
5 gallons (19 liters) a day.
 
✓ Rest in shade and up off the ground for at least 10 
minutes every hour. This gives you a few moments to 
cool off.

Part III: Surviving in Extreme Land Environments 
336
 
✓ Breathe through your nose rather than your mouth. 
You want to minimize water loss from exhaled vapor.
Better yet, avoid all these problems by traveling at night.
Crossing Desert Terrain
The vast, open terrain of deserts can be deceptive, making 
distant hills look three times closer than they really are. Don’t 
get frustrated. Stick to your plan even as you encounter these 
obstacles:
 
✓ Sand dunes: The wind can blow sand into mountainous 
heaps. Dunes present no real immediate dangers, but 
they’re dangerously exhausting to climb. You either have 
to slog over them — sinking back with each step — or go 
around them, which may cost miles. Tough call.
 
✓ Rocky terrain: Crossing rocky terrain requires shoes or 
boots. Sturdy soles protect you from heat, sharp rock, 
and thorns, and high cuffs prevent the dreaded twisted 
ankle and may stop a snake attack.
 
✓ Wadis and lagas: Dry watercourses — termed wadis 
in Arabia and lagas in East Africa — are riverbeds that 
flow in the spring (when mountain snows melt) but are 
dry the rest of the year. They can be the home of flash 
floods in the springtime, so beware of this danger. They 
may have water in them, though (see the earlier section 
“Locating water underground”).
 
✓ Gallery forests: These are vegetation stands that run 
along the banks of river courses that are dry most of 
the year but flow with spring meltwater. They can be a 
great source of water — because tree roots and other 
vegetation trap water in their vicinity — but remember 
that a lot of nonhuman animals (such as African lions) 
like to take shelter in the shade of gallery forests, just like 
you do.

Part IV
Surviving on the 
Seas, Oceans, and 
Great Lakes

In this part . . .
S
urvival challenges on the water are so unique that 
we’ve dedicated an entire part to this topic. How do 
you protect yourself from hypothermia if you fall into one 
of the Great Lakes? How can you satisfy your thirst on the 
ocean when you’re surrounded by salt water? Which 
foods are safe to collect from the sea? Can you fend off 
sharks and other dangerous animals? And how are you 
going to get to land — or even fi nd land in the fi rst place? 
In this part, we answer these questions, and we show you 
the skills you need to know when you head offshore.

I
f you get into trouble while at sea (or on a large lake), your 
ordeal begins, most likely, in one of two ways: You get 
separated from your boat in some way, or your vessel sinks. 
Neither are pleasant thoughts, we know, but you can use 
plenty of good strategies to make it through.
In this chapter, we look at scenarios in which life rafts aren’t 
involved. (Chapter 19 covers life raft procedures as well what 
to do if your vessel is disabled.) For now, we show you how to 
recognize a ship or small boat is in trouble, how to cope with 
that situation, and how to stay alive in the minutes and hours 
after the sinking — with or without a life jacket.
Recognizing When Your 
Vessel Is in Trouble
If you spend any time studying the harrowing history of 
tragedies at sea, you quickly see a clear pattern: Those who 
recognize what’s happening immediately — as it’s happening — 
usually have the highest rate of survival. This section shows 
you some of the causes of sinking and the warning signs that 
the vessel you’re aboard, whether large or small, may be in 
danger.

Part IV: Surviving on the Seas, Oceans, and Great Lakes 
340
Overloading
If you find yourself aboard a vessel that you feel is overloaded, 
try as hard as you can to stay above deck; go below only if 
you have to. If danger comes — such as heavy weather — an 
overloaded vessel is going to get into trouble quickly.
Over the years, island-to-island ferries and river ferries in many 
countries have developed a reputation of being constantly 
overloaded, which has caused some tragic capsizes 
(overturning). But danger from overloading can happen 
anytime and anywhere — even with canoes and rowboats 
on lakes and ponds.
 
If you haven’t yet boarded the boat, here’s how you can tell 
whether it’s overloaded:
 
✓ Check the freeboard. The freeboard is the amount of 
the boat’s hull that’s above the surface of the water. If 
the rim (gunwale) of the vessel is too close to the water, 
even a small wave could sink it. Check out Figure 18-1.
 
 Keep in mind that some vessels have naturally low 
freeboards, especially the ones on the big rivers, like the 
Amazon in South America and Mekong in Southeast Asia. 
The best thing to do is to compare the freeboard of the 
vessel you’re about to board with other vessels, loaded 
and unloaded.
 
✓ Look for empty spaces. All vessels should have empty 
spaces in them, places where no person stands, no 
equipment rests, no cargo is stored. Few boats are 
designed to be stuffed to the brim. If a vessel appears full 
and has little or no freeboard, be on guard.
Overloaded
Figure 18-1: Identifying overloading.

 Chapter 18: Staying Afloat and Warm 341
Poor trim or listing
If a vessel you’re traveling on suddenly leans in the water, this 
is called a list, and it may be a sign you should be planning 
your escape. This is especially true if the boat is rolling. If the 
vessel rolls one way and doesn’t roll back, this is a definite 
sign that something is wrong.
All boats should remain trimmed in the water, which means 
they should sail along in a balanced fashion. Even sailboats, 
which lean over (heal) naturally, should still be trim — in 
other words, they should lean over in a straight and organized 
fashion. Many vessels start out their voyages poorly trimmed, 
and like overloaded vessels, when they get into trouble, bad 
things happen quickly. Figure 18-2 shows trimmed and poorly 
trimmed boats.
 
Small boats swamp quickly. Swamping means that the boat 
floods almost to the brim. This happens when an enormous 
mass of water comes over the side, or over the back (transom), 
of the boat.
Out of trim
Trim and not
overloaded
Figure 18-2: An out-of-trim vessel and a trimmed vessel.

Part IV: Surviving on the Seas, Oceans, and Great Lakes 
342
Bad weather and heavy seas
The vast majority of vessels come through bad weather 
without any problem at all. But if the vessel you’re aboard 
labors heavily in bad seas, especially if the boat loses power, 
start thinking about your plans for survival. Most vessels are 
designed to allow water to come aboard and then drain off. 
If more water is coming aboard than is draining, be prepared 
to act.
All waves aren’t created equal. Many times, great mountains 
of water on the sea do nothing but create a lot of foam at the 
top, and they’re much safer to deal with than small waves that 
fling their tops forward.
 
When you’re in any boat, but especially a small boat, you’re 
vulnerable to the plunging breaker, a wave that flings an 
enormous amount of water in front of it. You can see a perfect 
example of these curling waves near the shore because the 
surf is often made up of plunging breakers. However, plunging 
breakers can develop anywhere. Remember, size isn’t the 
main factor here; a wave can be only about 6 feet tall, but if it 
plunges, it’s dangerous (see Figure 18-3).
Although waves of any kind can cause problems, if you’re 
aboard a small boat and plunging breakers are nearby, be 
prepared for serious problems like flooding and capsize — 
another reason to wear your life jacket when going through 
a heavy surf, or even better, a good reason to avoid the surf 
altogether!
Figure 18-3: A plunging breaker.

 Chapter 18: Staying Afloat and Warm 343
Collisions
The oceans are big, but ships and boats still find ways to run 
into each other or submerged objects every day. Knowing 
how collisions occur can give you the added edge of a few 
extra seconds or minutes to plan your survival. In this section, 
we tell you how to avoid running into things, whether you’re 
on a lake or the ocean.
Understanding collision courses with other vessels
Collisions between boats usually occur in marinas, ports, 
entrances to ports, or places with bad visibility, but they can 
occur almost anywhere. Here’s what to do whenever you see 
another boat (check out Figure 18-4).
Distant vessel off
starboard bow
After a time, the vessel is
in essentially the same
position, but is much
larger. On this course,
you will collide with
the vessel.
Figure 18-4: A collision course.
 
1. Align your view of the other boat with some object 
of reference on your vessel.
 
 Line up a nearby object with the faraway vessel, just 
like looking down a gun sight. For example, if you’re 
on a sea kayak and you see a sailboat in the distance, 
make a mental note that the sailboat lines up with, 
say, your backpack’s shoulder strap. In Figure 18-4, 
the sailboat is off your kayak’s starboard (right) bow.
 
2. After a few seconds, check the alignment again.

Part IV: Surviving on the Seas, Oceans, and Great Lakes 
344
 
 If the sailboat is still aligned with the same object 
on your sea kayak but the sailboat is much larger — 
in other words, much closer — the two of you are 
moving toward the same point.
 
 In a few more seconds, you may take your sighting 
again, and now the sailboat is so large that you can 
see the person who’s steering it — but it’s still at the 
same sighting point, over the same sighting object: 
You’re on a collision course.
 
3. If you’re on a collision course, take action to get 
away or turn very sharply.
 
 Or if you have no control of the vessel — such as 
when you’re on a charter or ferry, begin taking the 
steps we show you in “Knowing What to Do If Your 
Boat Starts to Sink,” later in this chapter.
 
Anytime you’re sailing or motoring in waters where there are 
Jet Skis, Sea-Doos, or any other sort of personal water crafts 
(PWC), be especially vigilant. These small motorcycles-on-
water are involved in a lot of collisions.
Watching out for underwater obstacles
The second type of collision is the type that occurs when the 
boat you’re on strikes a fixed object, or a submerged one, like 
a reef or rock. Maintain a very sharp lookout for the following:
 
✓ Any signs or buoys that have large red diamonds on 
them: These signs can vary from country to country, but 
in North America, they mark danger.
 
✓ Any foam near the shore: This usually means that a rock 
is just right under the surface (awash).
 
✓ Any long lines of rocks extending from land: Where these 
long, rocky peninsulas stop is only the start of danger. 
These rocks usually continue just under the surface.
Fire
Fire burns well on the water because you’re in an open space 
with lots of oxygen. Fire burns so aggressively on the water 
that the flames and the heat frequently make it impossible for 
the crew to maintain control of the vessel, which puts you at 
the mercy of the waves and the sea.

 Chapter 18: Staying Afloat and Warm 345
If you see a fire on a cruise or charter, notify the crew 
immediately. Though you should always try to let the crew 
of the vessel perform the fire-extinguishing duties, know that 
on most boats, fire extinguishers are available.
Hatch failure and ship damage
Loosely speaking, a hatch failure occurs whenever a previously 
closed opening breaks and lets water into the boat. Doors can 
be left unsecured, allowing water to pour into the vessel, and 
large waves can break windows on boats quite easily. Heavy 
flooding in these cases happens in an instant, so be ready for 
it. Some vessels can pump the water out, and some can’t.
 
Many tragedies at sea give warnings in the form of sounds or 
bad vibrations. The water itself can make horrendous noises 
against a boat’s hull without causing any damage whatsoever, 
but when a ship strains, the sound is significantly different. 
The ship groans, metal twisting on metal. All ships make these 
sounds when laboring, but listen for them, and try to develop 
a sense of what’s unusual. The best way to react to loud or 
violent noise is to be vigilant, but not panicked.
Knowing What to Do If Your 
Boat Starts to Sink
As soon as the boat you’re on starts to sink, you need to take 
action. If you keep calm and take a few steps in a timely fashion, 
you greatly increase your chance of survival. This section 
takes you through the important immediate steps you need to 
take if your ship is in trouble and starting to sink.
Radioing for help
If you can get to a radio and your vessel is in grave and 
immediate danger, you need to signal for help. The law states 
very clearly that anyone, regardless of experience or licenses, 
can operate any radio he or she has access to if sending a 
distress signal. The single stipulation to this law — and it’s 
a serious stipulation — is that to signal SOS or Mayday, you 
must be in “grave and immediate danger” of death or loss of 

Part IV: Surviving on the Seas, Oceans, and Great Lakes 
346
significant property. If your situation isn’t that bad, consider 
signaling Pan, which is for smaller problems. (For directions 
on how to send a Mayday or Pan signal, check out Chapter 12.)
If you’ve made radio contact with someone and your distress 
signal has been sent and completely received, make a schedule. 
Tell the radio operator on the other end that if you lose 
contact, she should listen again at a specific time for another 
signal. If radio contact is very good — for example, if you’ve 
made contact with a U.S. Coast Guard radio operator or with 
one of the ham radio networks (such as the Maritime Mobile 
Net) — then after making your distress call, make your 
schedule, confirm it, and then shut off your transmitter or 
cellphone. Good battery discipline can give you the upper 
hand on your surroundings.
 
If you know you’re going to leave the vessel — in other words, 
if the boat is sinking and you know there won’t be a second 
contact — tape down the button on the microphone so that 
the radio continues to transmit for as long as possible.
Putting on a life jacket
Faced with a deteriorating situation, you should put on a life 
jacket. If the captain or one of the mates of the vessel you’re 
on doesn’t give you a life jacket, you may have to find one 
yourself. Life jackets usually live in the dark. If you’re in 
trouble, look in the darkest places of a boat:
 
✓ Under the seats, in the seat lockers
 
✓ In the forepeak, the dark place at the very front point of 
the boat
 
✓ In the lazarette, the trunk at the very back of the boat
 
✓ In the closet behind the bridge, the room from which the 
boat is steered
 
If you have time and the water is cold, put on as much clothing 
as you can before putting on your life jacket. Forget all those 
Hollywood movies where the hero strips off his shirt to 
dive in. Clothing traps water near your body, which is then 
warmed by your body, forming a protective layer. Extra 
clothing usually doesn’t hinder you so much in swimming that 
you should discard it.

 Chapter 18: Staying Afloat and Warm 347
If you can, try to find life jackets — and the places where 
they’re stored — while you’re still at the dock. Choose the 
thickest life jacket you can find. Don’t go for style — you want 
puffy and bulky. However, that doesn’t mean an oversized 
jacket. The perfect life jacket is one that fits you snugly, like 
a glove, but with a lot of puffy flotation in it. The ones labeled 
Type I are the very best (check out Chapter 2 for the lowdown 
on the types available). Put the life jacket on before you go 
into the water — you won’t have time later! If you’re wearing 
the type that inflates, put it on but wait until you’ve entered 
the water to inflate the jacket.
Tighten all straps until the jacket feels like it’s actually gripping 
you — but don’t overtighten; if the jacket is too tight, you’ll 
have trouble swimming. Snug is right. Many times, when you 
abandon ship, the life jacket’s buoyancy forces it to rise up 
and fly over your head — which means you’re now in the 
water, struggling to put it back on. Sometimes it simply shoots 
up and knocks you in the chin. The crotch strap is the most 
effective way of keeping the life jacket on, so anytime a jacket 
has a crotch strap, use it.
 
Here’s the only exception to the rule of putting on your life 
jacket before you go into the water: if you’re surrounded by 
burning fuel or if you have to submerge your body to swim 
to safety. Submerging your body long enough to swim under 
burning fuel or out of a sunken boat is practically impossible 
when you’re wearing a life jacket. If you face this type of 
situation, try throwing your jacket beyond the flames and 
then make your underwater escape.
Preparing to abandon ship
If the vessel is sinking, make abandoning it cleanly your first 
priority — you don’t want to be pulled down with the sinking 
ship. But in the seconds and minutes between when you first 
realize that there’s danger and when you have no choice but 
to leave, you can take advantage of your surroundings.
As soon as you know the boat is in trouble and is at risk for 
sinking (and after you’ve put on your life jacket), take the 
following precautions — but only if you’re sure you have the 
time. We list these in order of importance:

Part IV: Surviving on the Seas, Oceans, and Great Lakes 
348
 
✓ Put on a hat. If you have access to wool, grab it. Having 
a covering on your head can double your survival time in 
some cases.
 
✓ Protect your cellphone. If you have access to plastic, 
wrap up your phone. A woman’s handbag can function as 
a sufficient dry-bag — put the phone in and roll the bag 
tightly around it.
 
✓ Gather signaling materials. You need to be able to signal 
for help when you’re in the water. Chapter 12 lists items 
you can grab to make signals.
 
✓ Collect water and/or containers. Even just a small 
amount of water can help. Your ability to survive long 
term on the sea, many times, comes down to your ability 
to catch and store rainwater. (For more on fresh water at 
sea, see Chapter 20.)
 
If you can, make sure water containers have a little air inside 
them so that they’ll float well in the waves.
Abandoning ship: The how-to
If you have the choice, stay with the vessel for as long as you 
can. It’s large and easier to see than a life raft, and it’s where 
search teams will start looking for you. It may float, partially 
sunk, for a very long time. If, however, the vessel is leaving 
the surface and you can step straight into a life raft, boarding 
the raft is preferable to releasing the life raft and swimming 
for it. (For more on using life rafts, see Chapter 19.) The rest 
of this chapter deals with situations in which you don’t have 
a life raft.
 
A sinking vessel is a body in motion. Just because the boat 
is oriented one way right now doesn’t mean it’s going to stay 
that way. Expect the boat to roll or pitch heavily. The following 
are procedures for abandoning a sinking ship or boat:
 
✓ Leave from the side on which the wind is blowing 
(upwind). If you jump off the boat on the other side 
(downwind), you run the risk of having the boat blown 
over you.
 
✓ Enter at the lowest point. Ideally, you want to slip 
smoothly into the water — slowly. Doing so can help to 
prevent cold shock response (see Chapter 22 and the 

 Chapter 18: Staying Afloat and Warm 349
nearby sidebar). Jumping from height can also cause 
injuries as you hit the water.
 
✓ If you must jump into the water, assume the following 
position:
 
• Fold your arms across your chest and grasp 
the lapels of your life jacket with your fingers 
before you jump. Hold your jacket down strongly. 
Remember, when people lose their life jackets, 
they usually lose them over their heads because 
the buoyancy makes the device shoot up while the 
people are plunging down.
 
• Cross your legs tightly at the ankles. You do this 
to cut down on becoming entangled in lines and 
cables and to make your body a solid unit.
 
✓ Above all things, part company cleanly. Stray lines and 
fishing gear, cables and railing, masts — all these things 
can grab you. Abandon, and swim away quickly.
Coping with cold shock response
Members of polar bear clubs may 
get a thrill out of the gasping breaths 
and racing pulses that come from 
plunging into cold water, but cold 
water is no friend to the survivor. 
Unlike hypothermia, cold shock 
response kills by causing cardiac 
arrest or stroke or by incapacitating 
you so much that you drown or are 
unable to perform physical tasks, 
such as climbing into a life raft. If you 
enter the water and you’re surprised 
by how cold it is, you’re at risk.
Entering the water slowly and 
gradually — if you have that luxury — 
can go a long way toward preventing 
cold shock response. Another way 
to help yourself is to gently swim 
to something nearby that you can 
hold onto, or just float in your life 
jacket, and wait until your heart rate 
normalizes. This usually takes from 7 
to 10 minutes. Of course, if you’re in 
extremely cold water and in danger 
of hypothermia immediately and 
a lifeboat is nearby, you obviously 
don’t have the luxury of waiting.
You should know that if you have cold 
shock response, holding your breath 
for any length of time becomes very 
difficult. If you’re expecting to have 
to hold your breath for any amount 
of time and you have cold shock, be 
very still and wait patiently for your 
heart rate to go back down. After this 
happens, you should be able to hold 
your breath for almost as long as you 
normally can.

Part IV: Surviving on the Seas, Oceans, and Great Lakes 
350
 
After the vessel has sunk, and you’re sure it has sunk, return 
to the sight of the sinking and begin working through the 
debris field. All vessels disgorge odd and ends when they sink, 
any one of which can save your life later on. But you must 
act quickly. Debris disperses incredibly fast. Scan for jugs, 
bottles, sheets of fabric, anything.
Coping with sharks
When you’re in the water, sharks can be a problem. You 
need to practice shark attack safety and prevention. Keep the 
following pointers in mind:
 
✓ Keep blood out of the water, if possible. Tend to any 
wounds as best you can.
 
✓ Don’t swim erratically. Swim in smooth powerful 
strokes. Avoid weak or fluttering strokes, and don’t 
thrash about in the water.
 
✓ Don’t urinate or defecate in the water if sharks are 
nearby. Sharks have a keen sense of smell and may be 
attracted to the scent.
 
✓ Stay in a group. Most sharks are scavengers and are 
looking for easy targets. Larger may be better.
In case you’re forced into fighting sharks, we offer the following 
methods, in the order in which we think they’re effective.
 
✓ Pull your knife out and be ready to use it: Put your knife 
on the end of a pole — if you’re lucky enough to have 
one or find one floating in the debris. You can use this 
weapon to scare them away. For more on this procedure, 
check out the nearby sidebar.
 
✓ Shark repellant: You can find shark repellant in many 
life rafts — just know that it’s a one-time-use-only agent. 
After you open the package, the repellant works for a 
very short time.
 
✓ Strike a shark in the eyes or gills. Try to dig them out 
with your fingertips or your knife. People have tried 
this with varying degrees of success. It’s certainly better 
than doing nothing.

 Chapter 18: Staying Afloat and Warm 351
 
✓ Slapping the water or screaming underwater: There 
are, admittedly, two schools of thought concerning this 
method: Some say it drives sharks away, some say it can 
attract them. Again, you may have to use trial and error.
Organizing your shark defense
Years ago, when we were drifting on 
the open sea and were surrounded 
by thousands of sharks, we devised 
a method for coping with these ani-
mals that was crude but effective.
Our vessel was sinking, and the only 
way to repair it involved spending 
a lot of time in the water, so we 
needed some way to chase away 
the sharks. To do this, we behaved in 
a highly territorial fashion and made 
the sharks believe that they had to 
leave. The key to success seemed 
to be to attack several sharks in 
rapid succession — as many as we 
could in the shortest amount of time 
possible. Using a sharp pole or spear, 
we’d come in from above and behind 
and jab them sharply in the back, an 
area that they couldn’t easily defend. 
When we did this, we’d also scream 
loudly under water.
Whenever we made an attack on one 
shark, most of the others seemed to 
take notice — they’d jump as though 
startled or would suddenly begin 
swimming much faster than normal. 
They seemed to register the fact 
that something had attacked one of 
their own and would begin to clear 
out, leaving for better grounds. They 
seemed to have a short memory, 
though. A pack would scurry away 
after an attack, disappear into the 
ocean, and then slowly reemerge 
a few minutes later. We frequently 
needed repeated attacks on a school 
to drive it away permanently.
Keep in mind that we got these results 
under very limited conditions:
 ✓ We were fighting small animals, 
less than 8 feet (2.4 meters) 
long.
 ✓ We were working in water free 
of blood.
 ✓ We had four people, were orga-
nized, and had time to perfect 
our methods.
 ✓ We had pointed weapons and 
experience using them.
We don’t know whether this method 
would work on larger animals, and 
we don’t believe that it, or any other 
type of method, would be guaranteed 
to work in waters filled with blood. 
However, we did experience good 
success under the limited condi-
tions we had, so we don’t hesitate to 
recommend this technique. If you’re 
desperate and you’re organized, and 
if you have something that you can 
use to stab the sharks, then acting 
territorial in an organized fashion is 
a proactive method that may give you 
the upper hand.

Staying Warm as You Float 
with a Life Jacket
Floating with a life jacket seems pretty straightforward, doesn’t 
it? You just float there and the jacket does all the work. But 
you may be shocked: Floating the correct way can improve 
your survival time by 100 percent in some cases! This section 
gives you the details.
What to do in the water
Regardless of how you end up in the water, you now have to 
survive in a life jacket, and the first and greatest problem you 
face is hypothermia — the slow draining of your body’s core 
heat.
 
If you enter cold water, perform as many sophisticated tasks 
as you can, as soon as you can. Cold water causes impairment: 
As your body gets colder and colder, you have more difficulty 
performing sophisticated tasks — like removing things from 
bags or closing difficult zippers.
To slow the onset of hypothermia, use the following strategies:
 
✓ Be as still as you can. This action is the most effective 
you can take to prevent the hypothermia in the water. 
Contrary to popular belief, swimming, treading water, or 
generally moving around makes you much, much colder: 
You’re moving warmed water away from your body and 
constantly bathing your body in colder water. The less 
water circulating around your body, the better.
 
 Whenever you go into the water, you develop a boundary 
layer. A boundary layer is the water next to your skin; 
your body heats it a little, and it protects you from the 
colder water.
 
✓ Use HELP. HELP, or the Heat Escape Lessening Position, is 
a body posture you use to close off your main heat leaks. 
Check out Figure 18-5, and remember to protect the 
following areas, which are some of the main places where 
your body leaks heat:

 Chapter 18: Staying Afloat and Warm 353
 
• Armpits: Hold your elbows near your sides to close 
the armpit area.
 
• Crotch: Squeeze your thighs together so that your 
crotch is insulated and protected.
 
 Losing heat from the top of your head is worse than 
anything else, so don’t use a heat-retaining position that 
would cause your head to go under the water. Ideally, 
you want to end up with your armpits and crotch sealed 
and your head above the water. If you can, keep as much 
of your body out of the water as possible; pull your chest 
up onto a piece of floating material.
Figure 18-5: The HELP heat-saving position.
Staying warm in groups
If you’re with a group, huddle together for support and extra 
warmth. Doing so can increase survival times dramatically. 
Just put your arms around your companions and have them 
do the same. For a demonstration on the group huddle, see 
Figure 18-6.
Just as important, staying together in a group makes you a 
bigger target for search and rescue to see. For more on being 
seen, check out Chapter 12.

Part IV: Surviving on the Seas, Oceans, and Great Lakes 
354
Figure 18-6: Huddle together in groups to keep warm.
Floating without a Life Jacket
As the years pass, more and more incredible stories of people 
surviving long-term floating experiences come to light. It’s 
no doubt a frightening thought, but many have survived this 
ordeal. If you ever find yourself in this situation, this section 
can help improve your chances of survival.
 
If you’re involved in a sinking and you don’t have a life jacket 
on, swim through the debris field after the vessel has sunk. In 
many cases, you can find extra life jackets or floating debris 
that you may be able to make into a raft.
Inflating your clothes
If you don’t have a life jacket, you can create a provisional 
float from your own pants. Your success partially depends on 
the fabric your pants are made of. It doesn’t work at all with 
shorts. The technique is simple (see Figure 18-7):
 
1. Remove your pants and tie knots at the bottoms of 
each leg.
 
 In our experience, tying each leg separately works 
best. Try to tie the knots just as closely to the ends as 
you can, and tie them very, very tightly.

 Chapter 18: Staying Afloat and Warm 355
 
2. Take the pants by the waistband and put them 
behind you — behind your shoulders — as though 
you were going to use them as a cape.
 
3. In one swift motion, throw them over your head, 
catching and trapping as much air in the legs as you 
can, and end with a whop! on the water in front of you.
 
 To increase the amount of air inside, exhale into the 
waist band to fill the legs.
 
4. Quickly cinch the waist closed with the belt, or if 
you don’t have a belt, hold the waist closed with 
your hands.
Tie overhand knot in
trouser leg.
Button and zip waist,
and then inflate by
vigorous overhead
swing.
Try to prevent air from escaping
by bundling up the waist
while floating.
Figure 18-7: Making a PFD out of your pants.
You may need several tries before you get hang of it, but the 
process does work. You have to reinflate the pants anywhere 
from every 5 to 20 minutes, but done well, you can hold out 
for a long time this way.
Understanding long-term floating
You can actually float for days — as long as you can remain 
conscious. But you need to think about conservation of 
energy. The position that uses the least amount of energy is 
called drown-proofing (by the U.S. Armed Services) or the less 
appetizing term, dead-man’s float (by many old-timers).
Essentially, drown-proofing simply requires you to take a deep 
breath, hold it, and allow your body to settle to its normal 
position, which means face down; this usually requires less 

Part IV: Surviving on the Seas, Oceans, and Great Lakes 
356
effort than floating on your back. Your lungs and buttocks 
are the two parts that float the best, so after you achieve this 
position, maintaining it takes almost no energy. There are 
dozens and dozens of stories of people who have gone into 
this position and floated for two to three days.
When drown-proofing, you must look up often for search and 
rescue units. One of the false assumptions that many people 
make in these situations is that no one is going to come 
looking for them. In some cases, search and rescue helicop-
ters hovered right over a floating person, but subject failed 
to respond and the helicopter never saw that person! Don’t 
make that mistake.
 
Don’t drown-proof in cold water. If you do, you end up with 
your head in the water, which is the worst thing you can do. 
This causes hypothermia faster than anything else. If you’re in 
cold water and you have no flotation whatsoever, tread water 
very slowly and gently. You must keep the top of your head 
out of the water. If you have no flotation, see the preceding 
section.
 
When floating long term, maintain a sharp lookout for groups 
of jellyfish. Many of these animals are translucent, and unless 
you’re really watching for them, you can drift right into the 
center of a group (we know — we’ve done it, and a close 
friend once wandered into a group and ended up sucking 
some of them down his snorkel!). If you feel a little sting, look 
around immediately. It’s a heck of a lot easier to swim around 
a group of jellyfish than to look up from your floating position 
and find yourself in the center — having to swim out!

The Great Drift: Aboard Life 
Rafts and Disabled Vessels
In This Chapter
▶ Deploying a life raft
▶ Being prepared for the difficulties of surviving in life rafts
▶ Handling a drifting boat
I
n most survival situations at sea, you end up on a drifting 
vessel, such as a raft or disabled boat (it happens on lakes 
and rivers, too). Life rafts are small inflatable pods, used the 
world over, for survival situations. They’re what you usually 
find yourself in if you have to fend for yourself on the ocean.
However, most cruise ships have two types of survival craft: 
Life rafts and lifeboats, which are small, rigid boats, many 
times with motors on them. When the captain orders aban-
donment, the crew usually tries the lifeboats first because 
they’re motorized. But if you’re aboard a ship that begins to 
lean to one side, or list, your only chance of escape may be 
the rafts. As the ship leans, the crane-like arms (davits) that 
hold the lifeboats frequently can’t launch them, so the life 
rafts, which are launched by hand, are the only way off the 
ship.
Having a realistic understanding of what you can expect when 
dealing with a life raft can go a long way toward saving your 
life. This chapter covers the basics of how to deploy life rafts, 
how to keep them afloat, and other relevant info concerning 
a life raft at sea. This chapter also explains what you can do if 
you’re in a small vessel that loses power.

Part IV: Surviving on the Seas, Oceans, and Great Lakes 
358
Getting from Ship to Life Raft
Unfortunately, you have no guarantee that the captain or 
crew of the boat you’re on will be conscious or even alive 
when the time comes to launch the life raft. You may have to 
activate the raft and get into it by yourself or participate in 
these actions in some way. In this section, we give you the 
how-to on inflating and using life rafts. Before going aboard 
any vessel, you also need to know how to put on a life jacket, 
which we cover in Chapter 18.
Locating the life raft
Before you even leave port, make sure you know where the 
life raft is on your boat. Although life rafts usually come in 
containers, those containers unfortunately don’t shout, “Here 
I am!” On small yachts, they may even be buried in closets or 
under a lot of equipment. Life raft containers come in three 
basic varieties:
 
✓ The valise: A valise is heavy bag like a large gym bag. It 
looks like an oblong cube, with a carrying strap sewn on 
it. Valises are usually very heavy, so if you grab some-
thing you think is the valise and it’s light in your hands, 
it’s probably not the life raft.
 
✓ Cylindrical canisters: These containers are made of 
metal or fiberglass and look like beer kegs or barrels. 
They can be any color, but many times they’re white. 
These types of cylindrical canisters sit in a cradle, or 
holder, like a large, sturdy bracket.
 
✓ Flat canisters: These types of canisters look like the 
typical modern luggage rack found on the top of an auto-
mobile. They can be any color but are usually white, and 
they’re usually strapped into a cradle.
All these containers should have a painter, the raft’s main 
rope (bow line) — protruding from them. This line keeps the 
raft attached to the sinking ship or boat as you’re launching, 
and it also activates the automatic inflator. The painter usu-
ally ends with a loop, which is called the eye.

Chapter 19: The Great Drift: Aboard Life Rafts and Disabled Vessels 359
Knowing when to abandon ship
Life rafts aren’t pleasant. They’re made to keep you alive 
when other options aren’t available, so you want to use one as 
a last resort. Basically, you deploy a life raft only if
 
✓ The boat you’re in is completely sinking. If the boat 
sinks only partially, stay with the vessel. It’s probably 
easier to see from the air, it has equipment that you can 
salvage, and it may float for a long time.
 
 A partially sunken vessel can sink suddenly, which 
could take your inflated (or uninflated) raft down with 
it or damage the fragile little craft. In case of a partially 
sunken boat, have the raft ready to inflate at a moment’s 
notice and be ready to be cut free of the sinking boat.
Whatever floats your boat: 
Making a DIY life raft
If your sinking vessel doesn’t have a 
life raft, you need to act quickly. You 
can work the debris field and collect 
floating items and tie them together. 
When boats sink, they almost always 
disgorge items that float.
Always maintain a lookout on the sea 
for debris or flotsam of any kind. A 
lot of stuff is out there — Styrofoam, 
entire trees, and so on — and you 
can use any of these things to make 
a raft. Look for garbage patches and 
snarls of line and buoys. You can use 
plastic bottles if you find enough of 
them. It’s not a bad idea to start col-
lecting them when you’re in trouble. 
You need only about 25 to 50 plastic 
bottles, wrapped in a tarp, canvas, or 
netting, to make a raft that supports 
a human being.
When building your raft, anything 
goes, but here are a few structural 
ideas that may help you:
 ✓ The closer you can get to a 
square or circular shape, the 
better. Oblong or rectangular 
rafts are more prone to capsize 
than wide ones.
 ✓ The wider you spread out — in 
other words, the more stuff you 
tie on — the more stable your 
craft becomes.
 ✓ If you can rig rigid poles, such as 
bamboo canes, to floating flot-
sam, you can make a very stable 
raft.

Part IV: Surviving on the Seas, Oceans, and Great Lakes 
360
 
✓ The ship’s crew can’t get you into a lifeboat. Sometimes 
even a competent crew becomes overwhelmed. In these 
extreme cases, you may have to consider fending for 
yourself. Generally, if you’re aboard a boat or ship that 
has a crew, they control the abandonment; they direct 
you to the lifeboats, or they deploy the rafts themselves, 
and you simply their follow instructions.
Launching a life raft
 
Letting the crew operate the safety equipment, especially the 
life rafts, is your best choice. Launch the life raft yourself only 
as a last resort.
You have to launch the life raft correctly, or you end up with a 
disaster on your hands. Take your time and make sure you’re 
acquainted with these steps before disaster strikes. That way, 
you’re prepared in case you have to abandon ship. Here’s the 
basic procedure:
 
1. If your raft isn’t already in place, carry the raft to the 
side of the vessel.
 
 If your raft is in a flat or cylindrical canister, you often 
have to release the canister from its cradle before you 
can deploy the raft. There are two ways to do this:
 
• Wait for the automatic hydrostatic release to 
activate. The hydrostatic release is a device that 
automatically releases the raft if the boat sinks 
to a depth of between 10 to 15 feet (3 to 4.6 
meters). If you wait for the vessel to sink and for 
the hydrostatic release to release the canister, 
you may end up in cold dark water, trying to find 
the life raft.
 
• Pull the quick release, which is located near 
the hydrostatic release. The quick release is usu-
ally a pin or a button. When you pull or push the 
quick release, the life raft may roll off into the 
water, or you may be able to pick the entire can-
ister up and move it to a safer place to launch.
 
 If you can’t release the raft, the hydrostatic release 
should activate after the boat has sunk, so be on the 
lookout for the raft to come up in a hurry, and don’t 
let it get away.

Chapter 19: The Great Drift: Aboard Life Rafts and Disabled Vessels 361
 
2. Make sure the painter (the raft’s main line) is 
secured to something strong on the boat.
 
 
When the raft inflates, it’s just like a kite, and if it’s not 
attached to something strong, it flies away — just like 
a kite! You may find that the painter is already secured 
to the weak link, which is a fitting designed to break if 
the boat has sunk and the raft has inflated underwa-
ter. Weak links are usually made of lightweight wire. If 
you think the painter is secured to a weak link, leave 
it alone. The weak link is strong enough to hold the 
raft near the boat while you get aboard. If the painter 
is not attached to a weak link, attach the painter to 
something solid, like a railing.
 
3. Throw the raft overboard.
 
 
No exceptions: You always hurl or push the raft into 
the water before you inflate it. If you inflate it aboard 
the boat, it usually hits a sharp edge and bursts, or it 
gets wedged in a spot where you can’t get it out. This 
happens fast, and you can’t stop it after it gets going.
 
 Throw the raft downwind from the vessel if you can. If 
you throw it into the wind and it inflates, the wind just 
pushes it right back against the boat, where it deflates 
against the boat’s sharp edges.
 
 Sometimes cradles are made so that when you release 
the canister, it just rolls right into the water. If the 
boat is leaning too far over, you may have to give the 
canister a good kick to get it to roll overboard.
 
4. Inflate the raft in the water.
 
 You inflate a life raft by pulling sharply on the painter. 
Painters commonly range from 20 to 60 feet (6 to 18 
meters) in length, but they can be much longer, and 
they activate the raft’s inflation device only when you 
reach the end of the line. You may have to pull out 
a lot of line before you reach the firing point. When 
the slack stops coming, you yank very sharply, and 
the raft begins inflating. The inflation takes between 
30 and 90 seconds. The overhead canopy (see Figure 
19-1a) is the last part to inflate.

Entering a life raft
In the ideal scenario, you enter the life raft directly from the 
sinking vessel — you never enter the water. However, doing 
so may not be easy, because the life raft has to be held closely 
to the sinking vessel, which means the raft can be punctured 
or dragged down when the boat finally sinks. To enter from 
the sinking vessel, try to climb down the side of the boat and 
enter gently. You probably won’t have access to a ladder to 
do this, so the process can be clumsy. Make sure you don’t 
injure someone who’s already in the raft or damage the little 
craft by barging in with all your weight.
 
If there’s any chance that the life raft could come into contact 
with sharp edges from the sinking boat — any chance at all — 
you have to keep the raft away and enter it from the water.
Don’t jump into a life raft. Jumping in is likely to injure you 
and anyone already aboard and possibly damage the life raft.
Entering a life raft from the water can be difficult. You have to 
lift yourself over the raft’s walls (see Figure 19-2), and you’re 

Chapter 19: The Great Drift: Aboard Life Rafts and Disabled Vessels 363
usually hampered by fatigue, waves, and a life jacket. Keep in 
the following ideas in mind:
 
✓ Get your upper torso on top of the walls of the raft. If 
you can get your chest on top, or even just close, you can 
usually roll in or be pulled aboard by other survivors. 
Fling your body up and forward using all the momentum 
you can muster.
 
✓ If your raft has a submerged boarding ladder, step on 
the rungs (Figure 19-2a), pull yourself up with your 
hands, drape your chest over the raft’s opening, and 
start heaving yourself in. If you’re almost there, throw 
your head forward as aggressively as you can and try to 
roll or wallow in.
 
 
If you’re almost there, throw your foot up to hook the 
opening, and then use the extra leverage to work your 
way in. Flight attendants practice this technique when 
they train.
 
✓ Some life rafts have a boarding platform that resem-
bles a common air mattress and floats right below the 
opening; you have to fling yourself aboard the platform 
first and then pull yourself into the raft. Fling your body 
up and forward.
 
✓ Using wave action can help. If a lot of waves are moving 
around the raft, you can sometimes use the ocean to get 
you started — to lift you a little higher — maybe just high 
enough to get your torso in. Watch how the waves rise to 
the opening, and then try to time one to correspond with 
your physical efforts (Figure 19-2b). Momentum counts.
 
✓ Allow the strongest to go in first and then have them 
help the others into the raft. If you go inside first, kneel 
on the floor of the raft and reach over the inflated walls 
to haul survivors aboard. If someone else is inside the 
raft, have him go to the other side to prevent capsizing 
the lightweight craft while you’re hauling aboard the 
struggling survivors (always avoid bunching around the 
opening, which can cause the raft to turn over). For a 
firm grip, reach over the sides and grab the boarding 
survivors by the upper arms, or better, the armpits 
(Figure 19-2c).

Adjusting to Life Afloat
When you’re inside an inflated life raft, you’re not out of 
danger. You and your fellow raft-mates have lots of work to 
do — which is good, because in a bad situation, staying 
busy is sometimes the best medicine. This section walks you 
through what you need to do while in a life raft and discusses 
possible scenarios.
The first ten minutes in a raft
As soon as you’re inside the raft, the first few minutes are 
important for ensuring your safety. Locate the raft’s knife 
immediately, and be ready to cut the painter if the sinking 
boat goes down. The raft’s knife is usually in a pocket in the 
overhead canopy, near the entrance. Knives in life rafts are 
squared-off, not pointed, to keep them from puncturing the 
raft. They have plastic handles that float, and they’re usually 
orange in color. You can still bring aboard survivors after 
you’ve cut the raft loose.
 
A sharp object can sink your only hope in two seconds. Most 
modern inflatables are strong, but we’ve seen rafts, hard 
ones, sliced-through like butter. When you’re in your raft, 
quickly probe for sharp objects or protrusions among your 

Chapter 19: The Great Drift: Aboard Life Rafts and Disabled Vessels 365
companions: Check for purses with metal latches or orna-
ments, belt buckles, earrings, snaps with jagged edges, and 
even ballpoint pens. Make sure your pocket knife is folded.
When people come on board, they tend to congregate near 
the entrance, which unbalances the raft and can cause it to 
capsize. Tell people to spread out, and start assigning mainte-
nance jobs. Here’s what to do:
 
✓ Address immediate medical concerns. We discuss first 
aid for problems such as cold shock response, hypo-
thermia, and near-drowning in Chapter 22, and we cover 
general first aid in Chapter 13. A few inches of water pres-
ent a drowning hazard for anyone who’s unconscious, 
so make sure no person is lying face down in the bottom 
of the raft. If water accumulates as people board, assign 
people to bail it out.
 
✓ If the boat you’ve abandoned has sunk completely, 
scavenge the debris field. Ask yourself whether any 
equipment you can grab — containers, sheets of plastic, 
anything — is floating nearby.
 
✓ Gather the equipment together and tie it down, espe-
cially the inflation pump. As time passes, the raft 
deflates a little, so you have to reinflate it.
 
✓ Check the pressure-escape valves, and check the seams 
for leaks. The escape valves usually hiss for a little while 
to release excess gas. This is normal. If you do find leaky 
seams, look to see whether a repair kit is in the raft’s bag. 
If there isn’t one, watch the leak carefully and try not to 
put undue stress or weight on it.
 
✓ Activate the ballast bags if necessary. These are bags 
under the raft that fill up with water to stabilize the craft 
(Figure 19-3d). Many times they fill on their own.
 
✓ Deploy the drogue when the raft is clear of the sink-
ing vessel. The drogue is a small cone or parachute 
that drags in the water on a long line that keeps the raft 
headed into the waves (see Figure 19-3a). Some drogues 
have a recovery float, a piece of Styrofoam that connects 
to the drogue and makes it easier to haul out of the water 
(Figure 19-3b). Some drogues automatically deploy, and 
some don’t.

Part IV: Surviving on the Seas, Oceans, and Great Lakes 
366
 
 If you find a cone-shaped bag in the center of the raft, it’s 
probably the drogue. Attach it to the outside of the raft 
at a location away from the entrance. The drogue is going 
to be under tremendous strain, so check it periodically 
for wear and tear.
 
 You want the drogue to float away from the raft on 
as long a line as possible. It should reach the trough 
between the waves when the raft is up on a peak of a 
wave. If you can get it to extend to two or three waves 
away, try it.
 
 If the drogue seems to be hurting the raft, try using a sen-
tinel, a weight that you put on the drogue’s line to make 
the line sink (Figure 19-3c) — this acts like an enormous 
shock-absorber. You can use anything you have handy as 
a sentinel, as long as you’re not chafing the drogue line.
 
✓ Inflate the raft’s floor. Usually, the automatic inflating 
cylinder doesn’t inflate the floor. Look for the valve that 
accepts the nozzle of the hand pump. An inflated floor 
helps prevent hypothermia.

Inside the raft: Giving order 
to the chaos
As you can imagine, being on a life raft at sea can be quite a 
traumatic experience. You need to prepare for at least one 
emotional explosion from someone. Sometimes it’s panic, 
recrimination, blame, or indignation at being put in the situ-
ation. If someone does have a meltdown, let the person blow 
off some steam in a benign way. For more on these problems, 
see Chapter 3.

Chapter 19: The Great Drift: Aboard Life Rafts and Disabled Vessels 367
In this section, we explain how you can organize your raft-
mates to increase your chances of rescue, and we name a few 
ways you can keep everyone a little more comfortable while 
you’re still adrift.
Organizing operations
Most rafts are small, so people are going to be sitting on each 
other, which can cause injury. It also may be dark inside. 
Having a plan — and assigning specific functions that people 
can focus on — can help everyone stay relatively calm.
 
Try to get everyone to listen and organize, or take a look 
around and figure out whom you can make an alliance with. 
Who looks like they can function? They may not be the ones 
you expect. Begin discussing life raft operations with them 
rationally, just like you’re operating any other piece of equip-
ment. If you can get just two to three level heads working the 
problem with obvious rationality, this can have a tremendous 
effect on organizing the others.
Here’s how to organize your crew, however small it is:
 
✓ Start a watch-keeping system immediately. A watch 
team is a person or persons temporarily on guard. These 
people look for ships and tend the raft while others rest. 
Have each watch team go through all the maintenance 
procedures we list earlier in “The first ten minutes in a 
raft.” When the team is changed, the new watch performs 
them again.
 
✓ Organize your bailing operation. Raft bailers are notori-
ously small, so use a boot if you have one, and make sure 
you bail water downwind. Bail out the last drops with the 
sponge you find in the raft’s kit.
 
 
If you have two sponges, only use one for bailing. Keep the 
other clean for collecting fresh water dew to drink later.
 
✓ Take stock of your equipment and how much food and 
water you have on hand. Discuss each item thoroughly 
with your companions. For more on collecting and ration-
ing food and water at sea, see Chapter 20.
 
✓ Make sure everyone’s ready for multiple capsizes. If the 
waves are big and the wind is strong, you may have to 
get out of the raft and right it again and again. Familiarize 
yourself with the procedure we discuss later in “The flip-
out: Righting a raft.”

Part IV: Surviving on the Seas, Oceans, and Great Lakes 
368
 
✓ Make yourself visible. Have your signals, like aerial 
flares, smoke, or mirrors, ready to go (for more on sig-
nals, see Chapter 12). If other rafts are nearby, consider 
tying them to yours to make you a bigger visual target. 
Don’t do this is rough seas, though, because the rafts will 
beat against each other and cause damage.
 
✓ Watch for land (or search-and-rescue teams) and dis-
cuss navigation. Make sure you start writing everything 
right away — especially your last known position. For 
more information on finding land, see Chapter 21.
Increasing your safety and comfort
Life in a raft is uncomfortable at best. Here are a few ways to 
keep everyone a little less cold, wet, and miserable:
 
✓ Dry off. If you’re in wet clothes, take them off and wring 
the water out, over the side, and then put them back on. 
Have everyone remove wet cotton clothing, because wet 
cotton causes them to cool quickly.
 
✓ If you’re in cold conditions, or if you’re trying to keep 
the seas out, close the canopy. If you close it using ties, 
use bows or slipknots so it can be opened easily later on.
 
✓ Stay with the raft. If you have to leave the raft to do 
something, tie a tether to yourself.
 
✓ When someone starts to become seasick, anticipate a 
bout of vomiting. Try to move the sick to the opening, 
because even a small amount of vomit in the raft can 
make others ill.
 
✓ Know that sea creatures like to bump against life rafts. 
These creatures include dorados (mahi-mahi), sharks, 
and turtles. This is largely harmless, but it can be annoy-
ing and unnerving.
 
✓ Treat sea-related ailments. Be prepared for sunburn, 
seasickness, and the like. We discuss treatment in 
Chapter 22.
The flip-out: Righting a raft
Life rafts are some of the lightest vessels in the world, used 
in the very worst conditions, such as strong winds and big 
waves. That’s why life rafts capsize all the time, especially 

Chapter 19: The Great Drift: Aboard Life Rafts and Disabled Vessels 369
right after you’ve inflated them. Make sure you’re ready to 
handle a life raft that has capsized. If you’re with companions, 
get them to cooperate, because righting a raft while people 
are still inside is exceedingly difficult.
All life rafts have handles on the bottom to enable you to flip 
them right-side up. To right an upside-down life raft, do the 
following (see Figure 19-4):
 
1. Swim to the downwind side.
 
 This side is where you have a wind shadow — in other 
words, you’re behind the raft, and the raft is acting as 
a wind break.
 
2. Brace your knees or feet against the raft and act like 
you’re trying to climb up the handles.
 
 When you start to pull on the handles, the other side 
will rise, catch the wind, and help you turn the raft 
over. This climbing force causes the raft to flip back-
ward and on top of you — this works, and it doesn’t 
usually cause injury.
 
3. Board the raft (as we explain in the earlier section 
“Entering a life raft”).

Controlling Drifting Vessels
If you find yourself aboard a small or medium-sized boat 
that has lost power, you have to act fast to gain control of 
the vessel. This is where you enter the realm of the Lost 
Opportunity. Slow reaction time is the hallmark of these need-
less disasters. Most of the tips in this section also pertain to 
handling life rafts.
Taking action with 
depowered boats
Boats that have lost power are vulnerable to filling with water 
or capsizing because instead of driving through the waves, 
the waves overwhelm the boat. Even on a small lake, large 
boats can motor by and create waves big enough to sink a 
small disabled boat. The moment your boat is disabled, take 
action immediately:
 
✓ Try to get some kind of propulsion going, quickly. 
Organize a paddling operation immediately. Keep the 
boat pointed into (toward) the waves, and watch for 
unexpected waves. If you’re with others, quickly explain 
why they need to paddle or row, or you’ll end up with 
an uncoordinated group. Paddle with anything you can; 
even your hands will do in a pinch.
 
✓ Be ready to bail. Many times, a wave plunges in and fills 
the boat halfway, and then shortly afterward, a second 
wave sinks the craft entirely. Acting quickly can keep this 
second wave from finishing you off. Organize your bailing 
operation before you need it.
 
✓ Balance the boat. If the boat is tilted to one side, 
vmove some weight to the other side. If the back end 
is squatting down, move some weight forward. If your 
motor is out of gas, take the motor off the back and stow 
it in the lowest part of the boat and as near to the center 
as you can.
 
✓ Consider throwing heavy equipment overboard. If your 
boat is close to being overloaded and has lost power, 
you may have to heave something overboard to save 
your life.

Chapter 19: The Great Drift: Aboard Life Rafts and Disabled Vessels 371
 
✓ If you’re being blown in a way you don’t want to go, 
employ a drogue. A drogue is a weight that you stream 
off the front of the boat on a line (or off the back of the 
boat) that slows you down. If you’re near the shore and 
you’re being taken out by the wind, try throwing out a 
drogue to slow you down. For more on drogues, see “The 
first ten minutes in a raft,” earlier in this chapter, and 
“Traveling with current and sail,” coming up next.
 
✓ If you’re by yourself in an inflatable boat, sit on the 
front (bow) and paddle by pulling the water toward 
you (see Figure 19-5). The process may seem clumsy at 
first, but you’ll get the hang of it.
Figure 19-5: Paddling an inflatable boat by yourself.
Traveling with current and sail
Beyond the use of paddles, the only other means of moving 
your disabled vessel or raft is to use the water’s current or to 
use the wind. The key is to pick the one that’s going the direc-
tion you want to travel and harness it.
 
To use the water’s current, you can simply put a paddle or a 
drogue into the water and let the water pull you. If the wind 
is blowing you in a direction you don’t want to go but the 
current is flowing the way you want to go, drogues can many 
times pull you against the wind. Traveling against the wind in 
a raft is entirely possible if you can figure out the current. For 
more on using drogues, see “The first ten minutes in a raft,” 
earlier in this chapter.

Part IV: Surviving on the Seas, Oceans, and Great Lakes 
372
You can erect a sail out of just about anything. Two paddles 
and a shirt will do. The higher your sail is, the better — just 
make sure you can handle the sail. If the wind really gets 
strong, be ready to take the sail down. Keep in mind that all 
life rafts travel in the direction of the wind, with or without a 
sail.
 
The wind usually cycles near land. During the day, the wind 
blows toward land, and at night, it blows away from land. This 
isn’t a sure thing, though. For more on winds and currents, 
see Chapter 21.
Restarting outboard motors
If your outboard motor won’t run, you can take several simple 
actions that may get it running again:
 
✓ Let it dry out. If the motor is wet from water, or if it’s 
flooded with gas, many times just taking the cover off 
during the day and letting the motor sit under the sun 
is enough to get it going. Put the cover back on before 
sundown to prevent condensation from accumulating. 
Sometimes this drying process takes several days.
 
✓ Make sure everything is clean. The fuel or the fuel filter 
could be dirty and/or clogged.
 
✓ Make sure debris hasn’t fouled the propeller. Examine 
below the water line. If anything is tangled, get down 
there and pull it out before restarting the motor.

Food and Drink at Sea

▶ Fishing from a life raft
▶ Finding alternative food sources in the sea
N
ot surprisingly, the challenge of finding food and water 
becomes life-or-death business within just a day of 
being adrift in a life raft or lifeboat. It’s a terrible irony that at 
sea you’re surrounded by water you can’t drink and by food 
you can’t see. The good news is that you can find the food and 
water you need on the sea by using generous amounts of inge-
nuity and patience.
In this chapter, we show you the minimum needs you have to 
fulfill to survive on the ocean, and we look at your options for 
getting fresh water and food at sea.
On the Water Front: Improving 
Your Chances for Survival
If you find yourself lost at sea, expect thirst to be a prob-
lem very quickly and prepare accordingly. To enhance 
your chances for survival at sea, take the following actions 
immediately:
 
✓ Master disbelief. Believing that you can actually die from 
thirst in this modern, high-tech era is kind of difficult, 
isn’t it? But you need to recognize immediately that the 
risk is real. Come to grips with this unfair situation and 
go to work right away on your water plans.

Part IV: Surviving on the Seas, Oceans, and Great Lakes 
374
 
✓ Expect water to be a problem even if you’re within 
sight of land. The ocean current can still take you out to 
sea within a matter of minutes.
 
✓ Concentrate on finding and taking any water you can 
from the sinking or disabled boat before it’s lost. Try 
to make sure the water containers have a little air inside 
them so they float well in the waves.
 
✓ Scan the debris field, the area around the sinking 
vessel, for important resources you can use later. You 
may be able to find containers or sheets of plastic you 
can use for your water-storing needs.
 
✓ Take stock of the water you have and secure it. Tie all 
your water containers to yourself or your life raft.
In addition to these immediate actions, you want to conserve 
and ration the water you do have. The following sections 
explain your situation and highlight what to do.
Understanding your body’s 
dehydration limits
Without any liquid, the average human begins to lose con-
sciousness after about three days on the sea and perishes 
after about six (slightly longer time than on land, usually). We 
don’t like these numbers any more than you do, but they pro-
vide the foundation for your hydration goals, so knowing and 
understanding them is key to your survival.
First, take heart: Those numbers are only averages. Many 
people have survived much, much longer. And here’s another 
factor to take heart in: If you take steps to conserve your 
body’s natural water supply, you need only a small amount of 
liquid to stay alive. We discuss these important steps in the 
following sections.
 
If your body is in the water, such as when you’re adrift in a life 
jacket, death from hypothermia is a much greater threat than 
dehydration. If you’re floating in a life jacket and you’re suffer-
ing from advanced hypothermia and dehydration, try to drink 
as much fresh water as you need. For tips on staying warm at 
sea, flip to Chapter 18.

 Chapter 20: Food and Drink at Sea 375
The first line of defense: 
Conserving your body’s water
As soon as you realize that you may be entering a survival 
situation on the sea, begin conserving your body’s water. The 
more you conserve, the less you’ll need to consume to stay 
alive. Fresh water is always scarce on the open sea, so you 
have to cut your needs down accordingly.
 
Take the following steps to conserve your body’s internal 
water supply:
 
✓ Don’t drink anything for the first 24 hours.
 
✓ Don’t drink diuretics, such as alcohol, soda, salt water, or 
urine (which also contains toxins).
 
✓ Avoid perspiration; soak rags in seawater and put them 
on your body to stay cool.
 
✓ Avoid any type of excessive effort, and breathe through 
your nose.
The cup (or half-cup) of life
In 1956, a group of scientists in the 
UK published a remarkable scientific 
paper called “The hazards to men 
in ships lost at sea.” The study was 
drawn from the experiences of thou-
sands of sea survivors in World War 
II, such as downed air pilots or sail-
ors from torpedoed ships. It was the 
largest such survey ever taken.
One of the most revealing statistics 
to come out of the study was that if 
a human received just 8 ounces (0.25 
liters) of water per day while adrift on 
the sea, his or her chances of living 
through the ordeal were actually 
very good — just 8 ounces. However, 
at the other end of the scale, the 
study revealed that if the survivor’s 
water ration was cut down to below 
4 ounces (0.12 liters) of liquid per day, 
the chance of death was very high. 
This area, between about 4 and 8 
ounces of water per day, was clearly 
a deciding factor in whether a person 
survived or perished.
Even more compelling was the com-
parison of people who had drunk salt 
water to those who had not. Those 
groups who drank salt water were 
roughly 13 times more likely to die on 
the ocean than those who didn’t.

Part IV: Surviving on the Seas, Oceans, and Great Lakes 
376
 
✓ Try not to eat protein; many types of seaweed are edible 
and contain carbohydrates.
Chapter 7 discusses the importance of conserving your 
body’s water in more depth.
Rationing your water
Controlling the amount of water you consume, or rationing, 
can improve your chances of survival at sea. A small amount 
of drinking water can last you a long time if you consume it 
efficiently. A human can survive for a short time on as little 
as 6 to 8 ounces of fresh water per day. That’s a daily ration 
of about 1 cup of water, or 0.25 liters. If fresh water is really 
scarce, you can get by for a short time, perhaps a week or 
longer, on this ration.
 
Take inventory of your water and try to determine how much 
water you can afford to drink per day. You can’t determine 
when you’ll be rescued, so think long-term. Aim for survival, 
not comfort or perfect health. Here are some rationing 
guidelines:
 
✓ If you have little water, limit your intake to 1 cup (0.25 
liters) a day. You may have to drink even less than that, 
but know that a ration of less than 1/2 cup usually doesn’t 
extend survival time.
 
✓ If you have an adequate water supply, you can afford 
to go on a larger ration. If your water inventory isn’t so 
small, a ration of 2 cups (0.5 liters) per day can keep a 
person alive for many weeks.
 
✓ If you find yourself sitting on a 50-gallon (190-liter) drum 
of beautiful drinking water, 1 quart per day (1 liter) is 
ideal.
Take care to keep in mind that this is a water ration at sea, and 
it doesn’t apply to other environments, especially deserts.
 
Take your ration in several increments rather than all in one 
swallow; doing so relieves the agonies of dry mouth more 
often. When taking in your ration, hold it in your mouth for 
as long as you can to soak the membranes inside cheeks and 
gums to lessen the pain of dehydration.

 Chapter 20: Food and Drink at Sea 377
 
Before you begin a water-rationing program, talk to your com-
panions. If they aren’t well-versed in survival at sea, take a 
leadership position and explain how best to conserve water. 
Then get everyone to agree to the rationing scheme you’ve 
developed. Designate one person to distribute the water 
and one person to assist and keep track of who has gotten a 
ration. Don’t assume these positions yourself, because you, 
the leader, will be called on later to arbitrate any disagree-
ments. This issue is sensitive, and the more you make it a 
group project, the better.
Avoiding salt water
Consuming salt water only causes you to further dehydrate, so 
don’t do it. Drinking salt water increases your need for fresh 
water. If you drink 1 pint (0.5 liters) of salt water, your body 
will drain at least 1 pint of fresh water from your tissues just 
to get rid of it. The net effect is to worsen your fluid balance.
Even worse, drinking saltwater is closely linked to delirium 
and hallucinations on the sea. The old warning that “salt 
water makes you mad” probably has some truth in it. There 
are so many case studies on the books that show castaways 
becoming mentally unbalanced after they drank large portions 
of saltwater that you can’t ignore this danger.
 
The hallucinations linked to drinking salt water probably 
occur because of hypernatremia, an electrolyte imbalance in 
the body. Usually, this condition occurs due to an advanced 
state of dehydration, but drinking large portions of salt water 
can cause it as well.
The dangers of drinking “a little” salt water
No matter how thirsty you become at sea, don’t drink even 
a little salt water, because after you start, you can’t stop. 
People in survival situations often begin to drink salt water 
very slowly because they think that if they take just a few 
sips, it won’t matter. It does matter, and you’ll get into serious 
trouble.
 
Drinking salt water only makes you thirstier. If you drink a few 
harmless gulps of salt water, you feel satisfied for only about 
10 minutes. When your thirst returns, it comes back with a 
vengeance. You’ll be on a vicious cycle, needing to drink more 
each time.

Kon-Tiki and the Heretic: Survival 
stories to take with a grain of salt
In 1947, a Norwegian adventurer 
named Thor Heyerdahl crossed the 
Pacific Ocean on a giant wooden 
raft, which he called Kon-Tiki. 
Heyerdahl was trying to demonstrate 
to the world that primitive mariners 
possessed the ability to travel from 
South America to Polynesia in 
ancient times. His voyage was one 
of the most significant expeditions 
of the 20th century, and whenever 
the question of drinking salt water 
comes up, many people point to this 
famous story of men drifting on the 
ocean.
Heyerdahl and his crew reported 
that during their time on the sea, they 
drank great quantities of fresh water 
mixed with salt water. What most 
people don’t realize is that Heyerdahl 
and his mates weren’t facing dehy-
dration. On the contrary, they were 
hungry for salt. Fighting the sea 
day-in and day-out made them per-
spire very heavily. Although they had 
plenty of fresh water aboard their 
raft and drank pure, fresh water until 
their stomachs were bloated, they 
still felt a lack of something: salt. 
Their saltwater cocktail was brewed 
to replenish their body’s lost sodium, 
not to remedy dehydration.
Shortly after the voyage of the 
Kon-Tiki, another raft voyage came 
along — one that seemed to present 
absolute proof that you could drink 
salt water for long periods of time 
on the sea. In 1952, a French doctor 
name Alain Bombard crossed the 
Atlantic Ocean in a small inflatable 
raft. Bombard claimed that he had 
carried no water during his voyage 
and that he had survived on little 
more than salt water and the fluid he 
wrung from fish. He had undertaken 
his voyage to prove his theory that 
most survivors in rafts die of despair, 
not from dehydration or starva-
tion, and that if you could keep your 
spirits up, you could survive almost 
anything. He also believed that the 
claim that drinking salt water was 
suicide simply wasn’t true. This was 
a highly controversial position, and 
accordingly, Bombard named his 
little rubber raft The Heretic.
Though Bombard survived several 
months at sea, his claims simply 
can’t be proven. The French doctor 
didn’t keep accurate or complete 
records of his exploits. To complicate 
the matter further, Bombard drifted 
through regions where rain showers 
are really quite frequent and collect-
ing adequate fresh water is entirely 
possible. Important questions of 
how much salt water he actually 
drank, how much rainwater he col-
lected, and how much water he was 
given by passing ships were never 
fully answered. In the end, Bombard 
proved his theory that castaways 
need not die of despair, but his brave 
voyage didn’t prove that a human 
could survive by drinking salt water.

 Chapter 20: Food and Drink at Sea 379
 
The salt water–drinking scenario can happen even to the 
most disciplined. A downed U.S. Air Force pilot once admit-
ted, after being picked up in the Gulf of Mexico, that he had 
begun to drink salt water after the first day and that after that 
he “just didn’t care anymore,” gorging himself on even more 
salt water. Shortly afterward, he vomited, further dehydrating 
himself. This particular survivor was lucky to be picked up. 
Most aren’t so fortunate.
The dangers of mixing salt water with fresh water
 
Don’t consider mixing salt water with fresh water and drinking 
it. If you mix salt water with fresh, you’ll most likely be creat-
ing a diuretic. You’re better off concentrating on getting liquid 
in other ways rather than polluting what little good fresh 
water you have.
Making Fresh Water on the Sea
You have a variety of ways to acquire drinkable liquid on the 
sea, and all these methods have one thing in common: They 
require immense patience and persistence. Some of these 
methods in this section may give you only a mouthful of 
water or just a few drops, but every little bit helps. The his-
tory books are filled with survivors who, after a little practice, 
were able to get enough liquid to keep them going.
 
Take extra steps to safeguard your fresh water supply at sea. 
Life rafts and other small vessels pitch and roll violently and 
in the most unexpected of ways.
There are other cases like these that 
are reported from time to time, or that 
are rumored. Under careful investi-
gation, however, most of them have 
mitigating circumstances. Worse, 
these cases do little to address the 
risk of delirium. There are hundreds 
of documented cases, sadly, that 
show a strong relation between the 
drinking of salt water and the onset 
of short-term psychiatric affliction 
and death.

Part IV: Surviving on the Seas, Oceans, and Great Lakes

Collecting and drinking rainwater
Collecting rainwater is harder than it seems. Most showers 
last only a few minutes, so before the first drop falls, adopt 
an aggressive, proactive program to catch every drop you 
can. We cover rain collection in Chapter 7, but here are some 
notes on gathering rain-catching supplies:
 
✓ Gather containers first. Scan the debris field and recover 
anything that can hold water.
 
✓ After containers, sheets of plastic or fabric are of the 
highest priority. Hold onto any item that you can use as a 
rain-catching plane.
Shortly before a shower comes, make sure your rain-catching 
plane — the mouth of your giant funnel — is fully extended, 
and then rinse off all the surfaces with seawater. The seawater 
rinse cuts through the salt crust that develops on all things 
within just a day or so on the sea.
 
If possible, designate a container to hold only the initial rain-
fall. Then quickly put that container aside and concentrate 
on collecting water in another container for your main rain-
catching operation. Most of what you collect in the first 20 to 
30 seconds of a rain shower at sea is slightly fouled by salt, 
even if you’ve rinsed your collection surfaces. Sample this 
water later to determine whether it’s drinkable. If not, use it 
next time for rinsing collection surfaces.
The biggest problem in collecting rainwater at sea is keeping 
all the components in place. Violent flapping of the rain-catch-
ing plane in the wind can make getting collected water into a 
container difficult. Develop a rain-catching plan that involves 
everyone, and use it as a team-building exercise.
 
If you catch your water in clear or translucent jugs, such as 
milk jugs, try to store them out of the sunlight. Sunlight makes 
algae and mold grow in these containers.
Collecting condensation
You can collect condensation from the surfaces of your vessel 
and use it for drinking purposes — but only if it’s free of salt, 
which is rare. You can sometimes use a cloth or rag to soak 

 Chapter 20: Food and Drink at Sea 381
up the moisture, but the results can be meager. Sponges are 
better for this.
 
Maintain a close watch on all your water-collecting surfaces. 
You may have a surface that’s relatively free of salt. You may 
be able to maximize the amount of water you collect if you act 
just as the condensation is forming during the night.
Using water makers
A reverse osmosis water maker is a small pump that forces 
water through a filter, making the water safe to consume 
(though not all are designed to remove salt from seawater, so 
check the capabilities of your device). The water maker looks 
like a small bicycle pump, and if you come across one in a life 
raft or abandon-ship bag, check immediately for a package of 
spare filters and put them in a dry, secure place. Most small 
cylindrical water makers require you to change their filters at 
regular intervals, although new types use ceramic filters that 
must be cleaned.
 
Always attach a cord to your water maker and then tie the 
other end to your body or to your vessel. As with all tools on 
the sea, the water maker has a good chance of slipping out of 
your hands and sinking to the bottom of the ocean or simply 
drifting away from you. Even if you have good hands and are 
conscientious, things slip. We can’t stress this point enough. 
Why? Because we’ve lost a lot of good equipment to the deep 
blue!
If you have enough containers, use one to hold salt water in 
the bottom of the boat. Then pump this water through the 
unit into another container. This system reduces the risk of 
losing equipment overboard.
Setting up a still at sea
A solar still at sea is simply a clear container that uses the 
sun’s rays to heat and evaporate water; the still then con-
denses the water vapor and collects the fresh water.
A variety of commercially manufactured models (see Figure 
20-1a) are available, but they all work on the same principle: 
You pour salt water (or anything containing water) onto a 

Part IV: Surviving on the Seas, Oceans, and Great Lakes 
382
piece of dark cloth or into a reservoir made of black plastic, 
and then you put the cloth or reservoir under a little tent of 
clear plastic. When you put the tent in the sun, the seawa-
ter evaporates — but it leaves the salt behind. Droplets of 
purified water soon form on the inside of the tent, and these 
trickle down into a receptacle at the bottom of the still.
 
If you have the materials and the time, build as many solar 
stills as you can. And take your time with the construction, 
because craftsmanship counts. Solar stills, especially impro-
vised stills, produce only a tiny amount of drinkable water per 
day — and this only in calm conditions.
Here’s how to build the basic still using odds and ends at sea 
(remember the debris field you were in?). This type is a varia-
tion on the land-based solar still (see Figure 20-1b):
 
1. Glue or tape a cup at the bottom of a medium-sized 
bucket.
 
2. Use a plastic sheet to form a dripper over the cup.
 
 The dripper is basically a stalactite-in-a-bucket. To 
make the dripper, just drape a plastic sheet over the 
top of your bucket and place a weight in the center of 
the sheet, which sags down over the cup.
 
3. Secure the plastic with string or a rubber band.

Try to have good seals around the still the outer perimeter of 
the still so that you get an air-tight evaporation unit. You may 
be able to stabilize your solar still at sea by attaching a handle 
to it and suspending it from a boom or ceiling. Commercially 

 Chapter 20: Food and Drink at Sea 383
manufactured solar stills usually have weights in their 
rounded bottoms to make them stable on the bucking ocean.
Using a solar still on the sea can try your patience to the 
breaking point because everything is in motion, and getting 
the little drops to fall into the right receptacle can be a night-
mare. If your first efforts to distill water yield meager results, 
look for ways to improve your methods. It takes practice.
Removing salt with 
desalination kits
Desalination kits use chemicals and filters to convert seawater 
into drinkable liquid. Usually the kits require you to pour one 
or two chemicals into a pouch full of seawater and then allow 
the seawater to pass through a filter. Even the larger kits can’t 
produce much water, many times only a few pints, but they 
can save you in a pinch. If you’re lucky enough to run across 
a chemical desalination kit, save it for a cloudy day — when 
your solar still won’t work (the preceding section explains 
solar stills). Try to concentrate on getting liquid from other 
sources first.
Considering Living 
Sources of Water
You can supplement your rain-catching and saltwater-
distillation activities by drinking the bodily fluids of fish or 
the blood of turtles. Draining the juice from sea creatures 
may sound unappetizing, but many castaways owe their 
lives to these techniques.
Drinking the juice of fish
You can consume bodily fluids of fish to get extra water intake 
while on the sea. The key here is to use only the fluids that 
don’t contain protein: the spinal fluid and the eyes. Note: Try 
not to drink the fluid in the meat of the fish. This juice con-
tains protein, so your body has to use water to process it. Of 
course, you have to catch fish before you can wring the juice 
from them! See “Fishing at Sea” later in this chapter.

Part IV: Surviving on the Seas, Oceans, and Great Lakes 
384
A modern castaway’s story
On a windy night in late March, 1980, 
a close friend of ours, a Colombian 
fisherman named Joaquin Cuellar, 
went lost-at-sea off the coast of 
Colombia. He had gone out in a small 
boat to run an errand with two other 
men, and unbelievably, his shipmates 
had managed to get into a childish 
shoving match and had knocked 
the boat’s outboard motor into the 
sea. Without power, the tiny vessel 
drifted away from land and into the 
vast Pacific.
For nine days, Joaquin drifted on 
the open sea. His thoroughly unlik-
able shipmates all but gave up. But 
he didn’t. His will to live was incred-
ible. He tenaciously clawed at every 
opportunity that came along, and 
instead of falling into despair, he 
became defiant. He loved life, and 
he was going to live. Though it was 
distasteful, he drank the fluid from 
his prescription earache medicine. 
At one point, he found a piece of 
drifting bamboo and tried to drink the 
fluid sloshing inside, but quickly had 
to spit it out. It was fermented.
On the fifth day, Joaquin managed 
to snag the leg of a passing sea 
turtle with a fishing hook. He hauled 
the 50-pound (23-kilogram) animal 
aboard and then quickly slashed its 
throat with a screwdriver he had 
sharpened. “There was so much 
blood,” he later told us. “It was 
incredible.”
The others in the boat wouldn’t drink 
the turtle blood. But Joaquin did, and 
it gave him strength. Like so many 
other mariners, he reported that 
the blood was not salty but “very 
sweet.”
Drinking the turtle’s blood was 
something of a turning point for 
Joaquin. It gave him strength and it 
renewed his determination. With a 
favorable wind now upon the little 
boat, he fashioned a sail from plastic 
and sailed to land, and safety, saving 
himself and his foolish mates.
 
Some fish are toxic and you shouldn’t consume them or drink 
their juices. For more info, check out “Knowing which fish 
aren’t on the menu” later in this chapter.
Here are two methods for extracting the spinal fluid from fish:
 
✓ For large fish: Cut an incision along the back of the fish 
and then suck the fluid out, or turn the fish vertical and 
allow the spinal fluid to flow down into a container. 
Sometimes, if you’re careful, you can use this method to 
simply remove the backbone altogether.

 Chapter 20: Food and Drink at Sea 385
 
✓ For small fish: Make an incision in the spine near the tail 
fin and then turn the fish’s body until it’s vertical. Either 
allow the spinal fluid to drip out or simply suck it out 
with your mouth.
You can chew or suck fish eyes to get the fluid from them. 
They can be very bitter, and some castaways have gagged 
when doing this. Even so, juice from fish can sustain you 
when you have nothing else.
Drinking turtle blood
To get water intake, you can also safely drink turtle’s blood 
to save your life. This method has saved many castaways. 
Technically, the blood has protein in it, so it would seem to 
violate one of the rules of water conservation. But because 
this last-ditch source of liquid has saved so many, including 
friends of ours, we don’t hesitate in recommending it.
Sea turtles are slow-moving animals and you can easily catch 
them, either by snagging them with hooks or gaffs (hooked 
poles) or by catching them with your hands. For information 
on catching turtles, check out the section titled “Identifying 
Other Delicious Things to Eat in the Sea” later in this chapter.
After you have a turtle in your possession, you have to extract 
the blood. Here’s how to do it for best results:
 
1. Turn the animal on its back and step on or hold 
down its beak and claws.
 
2. Take a pointed knife or spear and cut the arteries 
where the neck joins the body, near the animal’s 
backbone.
 
 The severed veins will spurt blood, so you need to be 
ready with your containers.
 
3. If possible, turn the animal upside down and allow 
the blood to drain into a container.
 
 You may be able to collect as much as 2 quarts (2 
liters) of the sickly sweet liquid.
 
4. Drink the blood within about 1 minute of draining it; 
otherwise, it will coagulate.

Part IV: Surviving on the Seas, Oceans, and Great Lakes 
386
 
Sea turtles are endangered and are important to their respec-
tive ecosystems — besides being remarkable creatures. Kill 
one only if you’re at risk of death on the open sea.
Fishing at Sea
After you take care of your water needs, you can begin to take 
food from the sea. Fishing for survival at sea is a completely 
unique experience. You usually have to fish from a flimsy 
craft that’s close to the water — a craft that a large fish can 
damage or destroy. You’re probably in crowded conditions, 
so when you bring the fish aboard, it’s like being trapped in a 
closet with a wild animal. So you have to rethink fishing. You 
can make a huge leap in thinking by simply reminding yourself 
that you are now hunting on the sea.
 
Keep the following pointers in mind when fishing at sea:
 
✓ Always use stealth when fishing. A fish can see you on 
your raft, and it can hear many of the noises you make. 
Even more than that, it has a very strong sense of vibra-
tion. Try to be as quiet as possible when you fish.
 
✓ Maintain a sharp watch on all your lines every second 
they’re in the water. After you put them in the water, try 
to keep a hand on every line at all times. If you allow your 
vigilance to lapse, the fish will surely get away.
 
✓ Maintain a disciplined fishing time, just before dawn. 
Get ready to fish every morning in the same way you’d 
get dressed for your job on land. Don’t be late! Have all 
your gear in the water before dawn — this alone can save 
you. Fish for as long as you can every day but especially 
during this critical time window.
 
✓ Make plans ahead of time for bringing your fish 
aboard. Ocean fish can easily get away — even after you 
have them aboard — or they can deflate your life raft or 
cause personal injury, so plan ahead. For details on how 
to board fish, see “Bringing in Your Catch” later in this 
chapter.
This section focuses on some specific fishing-related point-
ers if you’re lost at sea. You can also check out Chapter 8 for 
more-general fishing techniques.

 Chapter 20: Food and Drink at Sea 387
Tackling hooks and lines
You need hooks, line, and bait or lures. Almost anything 
works, but for a rundown on improvised hooks and lines, see 
Chapter 8. The best substance for bait is freshly butchered fish 
meat or entrails. Generally speaking, lures made from white 
cloth or some shiny object, such as aluminum foil, work best.
When you’re at sea, you usually fish with hand lines, and you 
should fish with the strongest tackle you have first — the 
strongest and best lines, best hooks, and so on — especially 
at dawn, when the big fish are hitting. If the fish steal your 
bait, reduce the size of your hook.
 
Fishing tackle can save your life on the open sea, but it’s very 
hard to hold onto. Lines break and precious hooks are lost all 
the time, so take precautions to safeguard your equipment:
 
✓ Stow your tackle in a container that’s attached to the 
vessel.
 
✓ Service your tackle — such as tying on new hooks — 
only when you have the boat’s bottom below you, never 
over the side.
 
✓ Fish with an assistant if possible. People lose gear or 
have other minor disasters usually because they’re 
overwhelmed.
 
✓ Maintain the lightest touch possible on a hooked fish. 
Never fight a fish on the sea if you can help it. Give the 
fish as much slack as it can handle and wait for it to tire.
 
Salt crystals develop on fishing lines, and when a big fish pulls 
sharply, it can turn the line into a cutting instrument — not 
something you want inside a life raft. When fishing from an 
inflatable craft, always tie your fishing lines to the exterior 
grab lines, never to something inside the raft.
Using a spear
Spearing a fish is well within the ability of even the most die-
hard of landlubbers. Spears are immensely useful and can be 
good weapons for killing violent fish in the water (which is 
better than doing it in your raft or boat, because that can be 

Part IV: Surviving on the Seas, Oceans, and Great Lakes 
388
a dangerous, clumsy process). You can stab dorados in the 
spine to paralyze them or sharks in the eyes to produce the 
same affect.
Craft spears by sharpening wood that you find on the open 
sea (like split bamboo cane) or from metal (such as rod from 
an outboard motor that’s run out of gas or the frame of a 
backpack). Make spear tips from odd and ends you find in 
your drifting boat, such as broken oar locks. All you have to 
do is grind these metal parts on other metal until you form a 
point, a process that usually takes about two days. You can 
attach the metal tip as we show you how to do in Chapter 8, 
or if you have access to wire (perhaps from dead electrical 
devices or outboard motors), you can simply bind the two 
together, wood and metal, as we show you in Figure 20-2a.

Figure 20-2: Fishing with spears.
 
If you’re using a spear, be extra careful. A spear can deflate 
your raft or cause injury very quickly! Never underestimate 
this crude weapon. Treat it like a loaded gun.
Always keep in mind that fish on the open sea like to congre-
gate. In the first few days you’re adrift, you may see only the 
types of sea creatures that swim too fast to be speared. But 
after a few days, a community of fish will spring up, including 
the slower swimmers, such as the slow gray groupers, which 
are meaty and easily speared. Here’s how you do it:
 
1. Enter the water with a rope tied from the boat or raft 
to your waist or ankle.

 Chapter 20: Food and Drink at Sea 389
 
 Doing so helps you avoid getting separated. You also 
want to have a loop of string that goes from the spear 
to your wrist so you don’t lose your new tool!
 
2. Float quietly and wait for a slow fish to come near, 
or drift casually over to the fish without making any 
hurried movements.
 
3. Grasp the spear at the halfway point so that it’s bal-
anced in your hand; then cock your fist under your 
armpit (see Figure 20-2b).
 
4. When you think you’re close enough, thrust straight 
out, from armpit to fish.
 
 Because you’re horizontal, this feels almost like you’re 
pushing the spear directly over your head (Figure 
20-2c). This is the fastest motion your arm and the 
spear can develop underwater. No other way works.
 
5. After you spear the fish, reach forward and hold the 
struggling animal with your other hand, and return 
to your raft or boat.
You can construct a slightly more effective fishing spear, 
called a Hawaiian sling, by simply attaching a length of 
bungee cord, rubber tubing, or elastic, to the butt end of your 
lightweight spear. After you’ve done that, just put your thumb 
through the loop of elastic, reach forward with the same 
hand, and grasp the spear about three-quarters of the way up. 
This stretches the elastic and makes the spear ready to fire 
(check out Figure 20-2d). When you thrust forward, release 
your hold on the spear for just a moment so that it travels 
slightly farther and much faster. This weapon is very effective 
on small fish that congregate within a few feet of rafts.
Using nets
You can use nets, fashioned out of clothing and other fabric, 
to capture small fish near your raft for use as bait. Submerge 
your net in an area where smaller fish may be schooling, 
and then be prepared to pull up sharply. This is an exercise 
in patience and quiet. Keep in mind that successful fishers 
who use nets do so with the help of lots of equipment. You 
may find net fishing impractical, and you may find it better to 
move on to other methods.

Part IV: Surviving on the Seas, Oceans, and Great Lakes 
390
Advanced fishing for the hungry
You may want to consider trying a couple of advanced fishing 
methods to augment the basics. These methods include the 
following:
 
✓ Get flying fish to jump in your boat. You can catch 
flying fish on the sea at night sometimes by simply turn-
ing on a flashlight or a lamp, or better, flashing the light 
on some background, like a sail or a piece of plastic. 
These tasty fish many times fly out of the water and land 
aboard your vessel. They make good eating, but they’re 
sometimes better used as bait. Put a hook in one and 
toss it out on a line. Larger fish are fanatical about flying 
fish.
 
✓ Fish with a gaff, a pole with a very sharp hook on the 
end of it. You can make hooks for this, but large, barbed 
fishhooks are the best. To fish with a gaff, drop your 
pole into the water, hook end down. When a fish swims 
over the hook, jerk the gaff sharply upward. Be careful, 
though: Like spear fishing, this is also a good method for 
accidentally sinking a raft.
Catching small sharks by hand
One of the easiest ways to get food from the ocean is to catch 
small sharks by hand. When you carry this out in an orga-
nized fashion, it’s safe, and it’s a sure thing. This method also 
doesn’t require you to risk your fishing gear to the sea. When 
you’re a castaway, you suddenly notice that you lose fishing 
tackle at an incredible rate through day-to-day usage: Lines 
break or hooks are lost or fall overboard. So if you’re short 
on equipment — or have no equipment to speak of — this is a 
good method to practice.
Use the barehanded method to catch only small sharks; don’t 
try to catch anything longer than about 3 feet (0.9 meters). To 
catch a shark, simply wait until the creature swims past. Then 
swiftly reach into the water and grasp the thinnest part of its 
body — just in front of its tail — and yank it out of the water 
smartly.

 Chapter 20: Food and Drink at Sea 391
 
Don’t grab a shark by the tail if you can help it. Grasp the thin-
nest part of its body — right where the tail joins the body. 
Some sharks have sharp tails that can cut you severely. Also, 
never attempt to use two hands to grasp a shark (or a turtle) 
in the water; use one hand for the fish and the other hand to 
hold onto your vessel.
Turn the shark upside down as soon as you can and throw 
something over its eyes, such as a shirt or towel. After doing 
so, hold the shark by the tail until it dies. Alternatively, if 
you’ve a cleared spot inside the raft and you have the shark 
upside down and blinded, you can do this inside. Otherwise, 
hold the shark on a reinforced area near the entrance to your 
raft. You may want to club the fish.
 
Keep in mind, when you start out, that even the very smallest 
of sharks seem fantastically strong. They fight, wriggle, and 
twist and writhe violently in your hands. Be aware that sharks 
writhe violently for as long as 5 minutes and can still bite even 
after they seem dead. Be patient.
Shark meat tastes of ammonia when first caught. To improve 
the flavor, let the meat sit out in the sun or overnight. The 
ammonia taste usually subsides significantly after just 8 
hours. You can also rinse it in fresh water or slightly fouled 
fresh water if you have precious liquid to spare or in salt 
water if you’re desperate.
The Baileys’ shark-catching operation
Hand-catching sharks may take you 
a couple of tries, but it’s well within 
the physical abilities of most fit 
adults. Maralyn Bailey, a 98-pound 
(44-kilogram) tax accountant from 
Southampton, England, was fre-
quently able to pull these animals 
aboard her dinghy during her famous 
1973 survival voyage of 117 days, 
saving herself and her husband, 
Maurice, from starvation. During the 
operation, Maurice usually stood 
by with a towel to throw over the 
shark’s head as soon as Maralyn 
pulled the animal out of the water. 
She was so good at it that Maurice 
eventually had to tell her to stop. 
We, your friendly authors, have used 
variations of this method to catch 
dozens of sharks during the voyage 
of the Manteño II without endanger-
ing ourselves in the slightest.

Part IV: Surviving on the Seas, Oceans, and Great Lakes 
392
Bringing in Your Catch
Before you catch fish at sea, you need to have a plan for 
bringing your fish aboard your vessel. Many fish are essen-
tially pointed animals, and they can deflate your raft or cause 
injury. They’re spring-loaded, too: Most fish have the ability 
not just to flop but also to jump — sometimes several feet 
into the air — after they’re aboard a raft or boat. You have to 
make sure the fish can’t jump back into the water.
 
The following is a list of strategies to consider when bringing 
your catch in:
 
✓ Get organized. Discuss thoroughly with your fellows 
exactly how you’ll bring the fish aboard and keep it 
aboard.
 
✓ Estimate the pathway that the fish will take when you 
pull it from the sea and put it in your vessel. Reinforce 
this area with anything you can and make sure there are 
no vulnerable points in the spot where you intend to land 
the fish.
 
✓ Kill or stun large or aggressive fish while they’re still 
in the water. To do this, stab the fish in the eye or just 
behind the head with a spear — grim business, we know, 
but you need to be certain.
 
 
When killing or stunning a fish in the water, it’s best not 
to use a spear that has your pocketknife for a spearhead. 
Your knife is irreplaceable. Use some other type of spear 
for this operation if you can.
 
✓ Be ready to guard the exits when the fish is aboard. Get 
between the fish and the sea.
 
✓ Throw a piece of cloth or canvas over the fish’s eyes. 
Doing so can sometimes calm it after it’s aboard.
 
✓ Be ready to club the fish after it’s aboard. This can be 
grim business as well, like the stabbing, but you need to 
get yourself fully prepared to overpower the fish.
 
Don’t use a spear when the fish is aboard the life raft under 
any circumstances. That operation is way too clumsy — you’ll 
most assuredly miss and damage the boat.

Preparing and Eating Fish
After maybe a few false starts, we hope you’re starting to 
bring in the catch. Now you have a new problem: How do you 
eat it? In this section, you find out how to prepare and dry raw 
fish. We also include some notes on identifying fish that aren’t 
fit for consumption.
Setting up the sushi bar
After you’ve killed the fish (see the earlier section “Bringing 
in Your Catch”), you can fillet it if you like, but many times it’s 
easier simply to peel the skin back and then cut the meat into 
long strips for drying. This is especially true in the case of 
large fish such as dorado (mahi mahi) and tuna. Here’s how to 
prepare and dry large fish like these:
 
1. Cut a large triangle in the fish’s skin.
 
 Start your triangle just behind the gill and narrow it 
down to a point at the tail fin.
 
 
If you have no blade, you need to improvise. Anything 
that’s made of metal works; a close friend of ours once 
cut open the armor plating of a turtle with a sharpened 
tin can. Unfortunately — or fortunately, depending on 
how you look at it — you have lots of time on a raft.
 
2. Start at the point and peel the skin toward the gill.
 
3. After the meat is exposed, slice off long thin strips.
 
4. String a line from one side of your raft or boat to the 
other, and hang the strips over it to dry.
 
Tuna is the only fish you shouldn’t dry in this fashion. Tuna 
is easy to distinguish because of its shiny silver body and the 
bloody meat that comes out of it. Consume this meat quickly, 
or it spoils within just a few hours. Save the entrails for bait.
Knowing which fish 
aren’t on the menu
When you’re fishing at sea, you need to know that not every 
fish you catch is edible. A few varieties of fish flesh can actually 
poison you. Most of these fish are found near reefs, although 

Part IV: Surviving on the Seas, Oceans, and Great Lakes 
394
there’s no guarantee that you won’t catch them on the open 
sea. The following is a list of these toxic fish:
 
✓ Puffers: Consider any fish that can expand its diaphragm, 
or puff up, or any fish covered by spines, to be toxic and 
inedible. These include
 
• Puffer fish (Figure 20-3a)
 
• Porcupine fish (Figure 20-3b)
 
• Cowfish (Figure 20-3c)
 
✓ Barracuda: Larger and older barracuda (Figure 20-3d) 
have developed a reputation over the years for carrying 
the toxin that causes ciguatera, or seafood poisoning. 
This is especially true in Polynesia.
 
✓ Triggerfish: The general rule with triggerfish (Figure 
20-3e) is to consider those species near reefs to be poi-
sonous and those on the open sea — the ones around 
your raft — not poisonous. If you want to give yourself 
added protection, you can approach the triggerfish 
around your raft in the same way most indigenous 
people do around the world: strictly as a bait fish.

Other fish should be considered dangerous not because they’re 
toxic but because of their various defense mechanisms. For 
more on fish with nasty spines and stings that can cause inju-
ries at sea, check out Chapter 22.

 Chapter 20: Food and Drink at Sea 395
Identifying Other Delicious 
Things to Eat in the Sea
Beyond fish, you can find other creatures and plants to eat in 
sea. You can eat all these foods raw, like fish, although they’re 
invariably more edible when dried in the sun. This section 
lists some of the more common foods you can eat at sea.
 
If you’re susceptible to deadly bouts of anaphylactic shock 
from seafood, abstain from eating, at least in the short term. 
You can try seaweed if faced with starvation, but perform 
the Universal Plant Edibility Test first (see Chapter 8). You 
need to know, however, that plankton can attach to the broad 
leaves of seaweed, and these hard-to-see creatures could 
cause a reaction, even if the seaweed itself doesn’t.
Turtles
Turtles are among the easiest animals to catch in the sea 
because like sharks, they frequently bump up against your life 
raft or small boat. To catch a turtle, simply grasp its hind flip-
pers and haul it aboard. It may be possible to turn the animal 
over on its back and haul it in upside down, which makes con-
trolling it vastly easier.
 
Sea turtles may appear to be benign animals, but they’re more 
than capable of sinking your inflatable raft with their sharp 
beak and claws. They’re exceedingly strong. You need to have 
a good plan and be well-organized before you begin to board 
the animal. Wrap heavy canvas or plastic around this animal’s 
head and claws if you can.
If you can’t pierce the turtle’s hard shell, you can still cut out 
its forequarters and hindquarters. On large turtles, this can 
provide you with as much as 30 pounds (13.5 kilograms) of 
meat. Handle the meat same way as with large fish — in other 
words, cut it into strips and dry it.
Birds
You can catch the sea birds that inevitably land on your life 
raft or boat, many times by hand. We’ve had many birds land 

Part IV: Surviving on the Seas, Oceans, and Great Lakes 
396
on our rafts, as have many castaways. All bird flesh is entirely 
edible, although it has a tendency to glow at night due to the 
bioluminescence of the fish in the birds’ diet.
 
Sea birds can administer nasty bites that can become infected 
almost immediately. Put on gloves, if you got them or you can 
make them, when catching birds.
Barnacles
Barnacles, which begin to grow almost overnight on any hull, 
are the little brown creatures that cling to the undersides 
of boats or rafts. They appear as long brown tubes, usually 
with white shells at one end. These critters are crustaceans, 
related to lobsters and crabs, but they aren’t nearly as appe-
tizing. We can tell you here that the good news and the bad 
news are the same: They’re completely edible. You can eat 
them raw, so feel free to pull them off with a satisfying snap. 
Bon appétit!
Seaweed
Seaweed is unappetizing but edible. Generally speaking, 
you’re looking for seaweed with broad, flat leaves. Kelp is 
good, and it contains carbohydrates and fiber, which are hard 
to come by on the sea. You can find many other broad-leaf 
species floating in the open ocean. To see what the edible 
types of seaweed look like, go to Chapter 8.
 
Thin, threadlike seaweed can be acidic and irritating to the 
stomach. Also, keep in mind that eating too much seaweed 
(rarely a problem) can cause diarrhea and dehydration. You 
should use seaweed to supplement your diet, not as a main 
staple.
Dry seaweed in the sun before eating it. Rinsing it in fresh water 
helps tremendously if you have that luxury. You probably 
shouldn’t eat seaweed if it’s salty, because that dehydrates you.

egardless of what circumstances you find yourself in — 
whether floating, swimming, drifting in a disabled boat, 
or castaway in a raft — a few good decisions can help get you 
back to land. We hope to show how a little wily observation, 
combined with some decisive action, can help you walk on 
the shore again — drenched, to be sure, but alive and well.
In this chapter, we discuss how to size up your situation at 
sea and what signs to look out for — just in case you’re in the 
mood for some dry land. At the end, we give you a few pointers 
on how to make your landing a little smoother.
Swimming Back to Land
When you’re in the water, getting back to land, or just back 
to the safety of a good vessel, becomes your most important 
goal. And you don’t need us to tell you that it’s heck of a 
lot harder than people think. But if you can measure a few 
things — if you can use some knowledge and techniques to 
eliminate chance — you can, like so many survivors before 
you, give yourself that little edge.

Part IV: Surviving on the Seas, Oceans, and Great Lakes 
398
In this section, we talk about getting your bearings, considering a 
current’s direction and speed, and measuring distances when 
you’re in the water. We also tell you how to decide whether 
to swim or float and give you advice on getting out of a rip 
current.
Measuring distance to shore
Estimating the distance you must travel to get back to land 
can be tricky. Land has a nasty habit of always appearing to 
be a lot closer than it really is. This is especially true when 
sunlight shines on large landforms, such as large rocks, 
peninsulas, or mountains near shore. When the sunlight is 
shining on these types of landforms, expect them to be much 
farther than you initially estimate. (For more on the funny 
business of estimating distances, see Chapter 9.)
 
When you’re in the water (either in a life raft or bobbing in a 
life vest), your ability to see land is diminished because the 
water interferes with your line of sight. Nevertheless, here are 
some general guidelines for estimating distances to land:
 
✓ Within a mile (1.6 kilometers) of shore: You can clearly 
distinguish the limbs on humans or the individual 
branches on trees.
 
✓ Roughly 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) out: You can distinguish 
individual windows on houses or buildings.
 
✓ More than 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) out: You can’t 
distinguish exactly where the surf strikes the land.
 
This last distinction is probably the most important, because 
if you’re in the water and you’re more than 3 miles out, you 
should try getting to land by drifting, not swimming. We talk 
about the decision of whether to swim or drift later in this 
chapter.
Figuring out where the 
current is taking you
You can do a lot of things in life, but you can’t swim against 
an ocean current — at least not for long. You have to work 
with the current, and that takes patience and faith. Regardless 

 Chapter 21: Emergency Travel and Navigation at Sea 399
of your predicament, you save a lot of energy and frustration 
by knowing which way the water is moving before you start 
making swimming plans.
Debunking some myths about ocean currents
To really understand how currents affect you, consider these 
truths:
 
✓ The current isn’t necessarily going with the waves or 
swells. So even though you may feel as though you’re 
being pushed one way, you may be drifting another.
 
✓ Tides aren’t currents (usually). Generally speaking, 
when the tide is flooding onto the land or ebbing away 
from it, the current actually flows parallel to the shoreline. 
This isn’t always true, but it helps to point out that the 
current isn’t necessarily rushing toward the beach or 
hurtling out to sea during the tides — it may be just 
running down the coast.
Determining the direction and speed of a current
So which way is the current really going? Here’s one way to 
be sure: If you can see land, you can use a range. A range is 
simply an imaginary line drawn through two objects on land 
(see Figure 21-1). Using a range is an exceptionally accurate 
way of determining which way you’re moving — vastly more 
accurate than using the waves as a measurement.
When you’re in the water, take a look at the lights or landmarks 
on land and try to find two that are in line with each other — 
such as two large trees, or perhaps the glow from a village 
and the hill behind it. The line through these two landmarks 
is your range. In a few minutes, you should be able to detect 
that the linear relationship between the two landmarks has 
changed. Remember: You’re moving in the opposite direction 
of the closest landmark.
Figure 21-1: Using a range to tell which way you’re drifting.

Part IV: Surviving on the Seas, Oceans, and Great Lakes 
400
Another way to figure out the current’s direction is to look 
at a buoy. Most river mouths and bays have large navigation 
buoys anchored to the riverbed. If you’re near a river mouth 
or a bay inlet, you can simply observe which way the buoy 
is leaning — that’s the direction the water is headed. A buoy 
that’s leaning at a 20° angle indicates a pretty strong current.
 
Whenever two large rivers converge, or whenever a powerful 
river emerges into the ocean, the water is pushed up so that 
you get very dangerous, turbulent seas. The large, standing 
waves can cause havoc for you when swimming. When making 
your way back to land, avoid these places at all costs.
Also, beware of riptides, or rip currents, that lead back out 
to sea. This current exists very close to the shoreline and 
causes a lot of drowning. For info on handling this special 
type of current, see “Swimming out of a rip current,” later in 
this chapter.
Moving in the water: 
Float or swim
When you’re in the water, you have a decision to make: float 
or swim. Either mode of transport can get you where you 
need to go — you just need to know which is better in your 
situation. In all but a very few cases, it’s better to drift with 
the current. Because the current is doing all the work, you 
may be able to travel as much as five or ten times as far by 
drifting than by actively swimming.
In this section, we cover floating and swimming as a means 
of travel toward land. Before you do any type of swimming, 
either for travel or just to escape from a burning vessel, you 
should take a look at Chapter 18 on staying afloat.
Letting yourself float
Many floating survivors have been picked up or have reached 
a distant shore that was well beyond their swimming abilities. 
If you’re without a life jacket, using the dead-man’s float, or 
drown-proofing, may give you the ability to float for as long as 
two days. For more on floating, see Chapter 18.

 Chapter 21: Emergency Travel and Navigation at Sea 401
 
Do not drown-proof in cold water, because floating like this 
makes your head go under, which makes you lose too much 
heat.
Swimming slowly
 
The most critical factor when swimming back to land is 
conservation of energy. In practical terms, that means that you 
need to relax and take your time. Swim more slowly than you 
want to — much more slowly, because that keeps your heart 
rate down, doing more to prevent fatigue than just about 
anything else. Swimming slowly can try your patience and 
make you feel as though what you’re doing is futile, but it’s 
the best way.
If you’re wearing a life jacket, consider doing a slow, easy 
dog paddle. This type of swimming stroke requires very little 
energy and gives you steady progress.
 
If you don’t have a life jacket on, keep in mind that the 
more you fatigue, the less efficiently you swim. One way to 
cut down on fatigue is to use a variety of strokes, sometimes 
referred to as relief strokes. The three strokes usually 
recommended for swimming long distances are a lazy 
backstroke, the breast stroke, and the sidestroke. Alternating 
among these three is your best bet.
You swim best when your body is horizontal, with your legs 
more or less behind you instead of below you. As you tire, 
your body begins to turn upright, and your legs sink below 
you. This creates more and more drag (check out Figure 21-2). 
Again, the only way to avoid this is to take your time and try 
to relax.
Figure 21-2: Swimming failure.

Part IV: Surviving on the Seas, Oceans, and Great Lakes 
402
 
If you feel yourself becoming fatigued, you should drift rather 
than swim. When you’re fatigued, swimming starts to become 
counterproductive. You can also check to see whether you’re 
moving toward the coast or away from it. If currents are 
moving you away, stop wasting your energy. Many people 
have survived by drifting until they were picked up. Also, after 
you’ve drifted awhile, your strength may come back.
Swimming out of a rip current
As you approach shore, watch out for riptides. A riptide is 
an area near the surf line where the water is flowing quickly 
down an underwater trough. You can usually see this 
phenomenon because it looks like a calm stream or creek 
flowing through the surf. The surface is usually flat, and 
sometimes it has an outline of debris or flotsam around it. 
More often than not, it runs perpendicularly to the main surf. 
(Note: This effect can influence the course of boats, too.)
When you’re in a riptide, you should be able to notice that you’re 
moving away from shore. You may also notice that you’ve 
sped up — that the land is leaving you in a hurry!
 
To get out of a riptide, swim at a right angle to the flow of the 
water, parallel to the beach. Don’t swim against it, toward 
land. It may take you a long time to get out, maybe as much as 
half an hour, and you may end up a mile or so offshore — but 
this is the only way. Don’t panic — just realize you’re in a rip, 
and swim to the edge. As soon as you’re out of the rip, swim 
to shore.
Improvised Open-Sea Navigation 
for Life Rafts
What happens if you’re out on the ocean and you can’t 
actually see the land? In this section, we talk about long-term 
navigation, such as the type you have to perform when you’re 
in a life raft, life boat, or aboard a disabled boat, adrift on the 
open sea. (For info on actually steering or propelling your 
vessel, flip to Chapter 19.)

 Chapter 21: Emergency Travel and Navigation at Sea 403
 
If you’re out of sight of land, start writing down as much 
information as you can (if you haven’t already started), such 
as estimated rate of travel, sightings of ships or signs of land, 
and so on. This is your log, and it’s one of the best safety 
devices you can have because it helps you put all the pieces 
of the navigational puzzle together. Even if you’re lucky 
enough to have a GPS unit, you quickly realize that navigation 
is best when it’s the product of a combination of many factors.
Getting your bearings
If you can get you bearings at sea, you can estimate where 
land lies. Even if you don’t have a map, you still usually know 
where the world’s continents lie, and you may have a good 
idea of where a large island is. So developing a sense of 
direction can help you guide your craft to safety, or at least 
help you to know how long you may be drifting, which helps 
when figuring out what your food and water rationing program 
should be.
The following sections discuss improvised navigation methods 
that are unique to the sea. For a basic course on navigation, 
including instructions for correcting compass errors, see 
Chapter 9. For info on finding directions by using the sun and 
stars, see Chapter 10.
Finding direction with compasses and charts
When you’re at sea, the most common instruments for 
navigation are compasses and nautical charts. If you have 
access to a compass, take a moment to see whether any metal 
or electronic device may be influencing it — simply move the 
compass around and watch the needle carefully. Metal items 
can cause errors by pulling the needle toward them. The best 
thing you can do is to try to locate the interference and move 
as far away as you can.
If you have access to a nautical chart, the compass-error info 
is called magnetic variation — not declination, as it’s called 
on land maps. These two terms mean precisely the same 
thing. Magnetic variation simply tells you that your compass 
will always be in error by a certain amount in the area of the 
chart. So if your chart says VAR 10 W, the needle is always 
pointing 10° west of the true direction. If it says VAR 10 E, the 
needle points 10° east of the true direction.

Part IV: Surviving on the Seas, Oceans, and Great Lakes 
404
 
Whenever you measure any distance on a nautical chart, you 
must use the latitude scale on the side of the chart. This scale 
may be delineated in minutes. A minute is equal to 1 nautical 
mile, which is about 15 percent longer than a terrestrial 
(statute) mile.
 
If you think you’re located somewhere in the middle of the 
chart, simply go to the latitude scale nearest your position, 
take a piece of string, and measure out a minute (a nautical 
mile). You can then take this string and use it to measure how 
far you have to go from your position to get to land. If the 
latitude scale nearest you is in degrees, keep in mind that 
there are 60 minutes (60 nautical miles) in a degree.
For more on correcting compass error and using latitude and 
longitude, see Chapter 9.
Determining direction with waves
If you don’t have a compass or any other type of navigational 
instrument, you can use the direction of the waves (and 
swells) as a rough guide to help you steer your boat or raft 
throughout the day. At dawn, when you know the sun is rising 
in the east, study the prevailing direction of the waves. This 
can give you a general sense of direction throughout the day — 
until late in the afternoon, that is, when the sun is obviously 
pointing west, and you’ll have to measure the waves’ direction 
again.
 
This method of orienting with the waves is only useful if 
you understand that at least two wave systems are usually 
around you:
 
✓ Swells: These are the largest masses of sea and are 
usually very constant. In other words, if at dawn you see 
that the swells are moving to the southwest, you can be 
pretty certain they’ll continue to do so all day. These are 
the best to follow, because they’re so constant.
 
✓ Waves: These aren’t usually exactly in sync with the 
swells — they’re smaller masses of sea that come along 
a little faster than swells. Sometimes the waves can be in 
sync with the swells, though watching swells is almost 
always better.

 Chapter 21: Emergency Travel and Navigation at Sea 405
You need only about an hour of careful observation to see 
which is which and which way they’re moving. Give it a try. If 
you combine this method with the navigation method of using 
the sun and stars that we describe in Chapter 10, you should 
be able to figure out which way you’re moving without too 
much trouble.
Estimating current at sea
If you’re far out to sea (you can’t see land), it’s virtually 
impossible to establish the current’s direction and speed 
unless you have sophisticated navigational instruments, like a 
GPS or a sextant.
 
As a default, you can assume that most of the world’s ocean 
currents move at a speed of between 0.5 and 0.75 miles (0.8 
and 1.2 kilometers) per hour. But keep in mind that this is a 
generalized assessment — many currents move much faster, 
and some move much slower. If you’re drifting off the coast of 
South America, for example, you can expect to move at about 
1 mile (1.6 kilometers) per hour. In the Gulf Stream off the 
coast of Florida or South Carolina, you can sometimes speed 
along at 5 miles (8 kilometers) per hour — even though it feels 
like you’re not moving at all! But 0.5 to 0.75 mph is a good 
baseline to estimate your speed, if you have no other way to 
judge.
Understanding signs of land
With heightened awareness, you can find your way to land — 
even if you can’t see it and you don’t have a compass or chart. 
Land gives all kinds of clues, but many of them are subtle, so 
you have to pay close enough attention. In this section, we 
name some of the signs of land.
 
At sea, the height of your eye or your antenna or your signal 
means everything. So when you’re looking for land, try to get 
in as high a position as you can — just standing up for a few 
minutes in a raft can make all the difference in the world.

Part IV: Surviving on the Seas, Oceans, and Great Lakes 
406
Signs of civilization
Some signs point you not only to land but, sometimes even to 
civilization:
 
✓ City glow: This can be more subtle than you think. Many 
times a city’s glow shows up as a very light gray semicircle 
way out on the horizon.
 
✓ Navigation lights: Many are very hard to see, especially 
because they often blink only about once a minute — and 
then only in red! Sometimes, finding a navigation light 
can be like finding a certain comma on this page.
 
✓ The courses of small airplanes, helicopters, and small 
boats: Watch which way these small boats are traveling — 
if you see a civilian helicopter moving in the same 
direction, an offshore platform may be nearby.
 
✓ Nautical bells and horns: Nautical bells are rarely bells 
at all; they’re long, heavy bass tones. They can be heard 
at night from immense distances, but you have to be on 
guard — you can easily miss them if you’re not paying 
attention.
 
 We hate to tell you this, but many times foghorns are 
deactivated because someone finds them annoying or 
because they need repairs. This is a common problem. 
If a foghorn is listed on your chart but you can’t hear it, 
that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s not there.
 
If you’re out to sea or in heavy fog, you can use an AM radio 
to find land. This is an easy and reliable technique:
 
1. Open the antenna and point it toward the horizon.
 
2. Tune the radio to any station you can, no matter how 
poor the reception.
 
 You’re not trying to hear what they’re saying on the 
station — you’re just trying to pick up a signal.
 
3. Slowly pivot your body while keeping the antenna 
pointed at the horizon.
 
4. When the station disappears completely, you’ve hit 
the null — the quiet spot where the station suddenly 
goes silent or gets very faint.
 
 When this happens, you’re pointing directly at the 
transmitting tower — and land!

 Chapter 21: Emergency Travel and Navigation at Sea 407
If you have an AM radio with an internal antenna, you have 
to take the housing off and find out which way the antenna is 
pointing. The antenna is simply a metal rod with a lot of wires 
coiled around it. When you find the antenna, point it toward 
the horizon and start your pivoting procedure.
Hints from the birds
Sometimes the flight paths of seabirds can point you toward 
land. The general rule when using birds to find land revolves 
around understanding what they’re doing out at sea. Each day 
at dawn, they leave the land and fly offshore to hunt for fish. 
Then, in the afternoon, after they’ve eaten their fill, they begin 
steadily gaining altitude. When they reach a certain height 
and spot land, they tend to immediately fly in a straight line, 
and often in a V formation, to their home.
 
Watch for groups of birds coming out to sea at dawn and then 
leaving in the afternoon or at dusk. If you see birds behave 
in this manner, especially in groups, that’s a pretty good 
indication that the direction of their flight leads to land.
 
The idea that all birds must eventually return to land is a 
myth. For some unknown reason, this idea still persists today, 
even among some serious mariners. This is false. Many birds 
stay out and sleep on the ocean — often thousands of miles 
out to sea.
The problem with identifying birds is that so many varieties 
exist, so it’s easy to mistake land birds for those that sleep 
on the sea. The most reliable land-returning birds are the 
following:
 
✓ Boobies and gannets: Boobies and gannets have two 
important distinguishing characteristics: long, thin wings 
and tails like arrowheads. Their tails aren’t split, blunt, 
or flat-edged — they look just like a sharp triangle or 
a spearhead. If dusk is coming and you see a group of 
these birds, watch carefully to see which way they fly 
away.
 
✓ Frigate birds: Identify these birds by their split tails, 
which are long, thin, and forked, like swallow tails. 
Frigate birds return to land near dusk.

Part IV: Surviving on the Seas, Oceans, and Great Lakes 
408
Other land signs from the water, wind, and air
 
There are other signs of land, ones that the great Polynesian 
navigators have used for centuries. Now, you can’t master all 
of these overnight, but you’d be shocked at what you can see 
if only you pay attention:
 
✓ Sea breeze/land breeze: On many shorelines around the 
world, the wind’s direction frequently changes with the 
time of day. Here’s the standard pattern: The wind blows 
toward the land from about noon until sundown, and 
then it reverses, blowing out from the land from early 
evening until just before dawn. If you record these types 
of wind changes in your log, they’re probably coming 
from land. Land will most likely be in the direction from 
which the night breeze is coming.
 
✓ Smells, pollen, or brown or gray air: Land has a very 
distinctive smell, especially at night, when the wind 
tends to blow offshore toward the sea. If you have 
allergies and your nose starts to run just after the wind 
switches direction, the wind is probably coming from 
land. Also keep in mind that off the coasts of North 
Africa, Chile, and even Southern California, when the 
winds get things stirred up, the sky turns brown with 
dust from the desert.
 
✓ A stationary cloud: Most islands — even islands that 
aren’t in the tropics — tend to develop puffy cumulus 
clouds over them during the day (see Figure 21-3a). If you 
see a single, puffy cumulus cloud that stays in the same 
spot while all the others are drifting by, this is almost 
always a dead giveaway that an island is underneath.
 
✓ Discoloration of flat-bottomed clouds: Low-lying, flat-
bottomed clouds reflect whatever is directly under them. 
If these types of clouds are over an island, they appear 
distinctly green underneath.
 
✓ Long, curved waves: If you see long lines of straight, 
parallel waves moving in the general direction of the 
wind and then you suddenly notice a distinct curve in the 
waves (a long bend that extends from one horizon to the 
other), an island is probably somewhere downwind from 
you. The island is bending the waves, and you’re seeing 
the first sign of it.

 Chapter 21: Emergency Travel and Navigation at Sea 409
 
✓ A sudden, confused wave pattern: When ocean waves 
hit islands or ricochet in and out of gulfs and large 
bays, they develop a distinctive crosshatch pattern (see 
Figure 21-3b). The sea suddenly becomes exceedingly 
turbulent — which means the waves have been hitting 
something solid and reflecting. You’re close to land. 
Unfortunately, this crosshatch pattern usually means 
you’ve already passed the island — although you may 
still be able to navigate toward it.

Figure 21-3: Stationary clouds (a) and wave patterns (b) indicating land.
 
✓ Walls of white mist on the horizon: Some very low 
shores — like many of the beaches around the Gulf of 
Mexico — are so low that they’re hard to see, but you 
can see the mist that their multiple lines of heavy breakers 
kick up. Look for a wall of mist on the horizon that 
doesn’t evaporate as the day gets hot. You may hear this 
before seeing it.
 
✓ Water color: Generally, deep water is blue and shallow 
water is green or turquoise, although there are exceptions. 
This is another reason to keep your log — if you can 
combine clues, you can put together a pretty good 
picture of what’s going on around you.
 
✓ Increase of flotsam: Random debris floating on the 
surface (such as tree trunks, coconuts, garbage, and 
so on) usually indicates the presence of land nearby — 
especially if the wood or vegetation is still fresh.

Part IV: Surviving on the Seas, Oceans, and Great Lakes 
410
 
✓ Butterflies and other insects: There are no insects on the 
sea, so unless they’ve stowed away on your raft, they’re 
coming from land.
We hope that all these indicators help you find your way back 
to land. Just know that when you get there, you still have 
some surviving to do.
Coming Ashore: A Dangerous 
Ordeal
Make no mistake about it: As good as land seems after you’ve 
spent a perilous time at sea, coming ashore is almost invariably 
unpleasant. You face heavy surf, coral, rocks, and vicious 
currents, all of which can drown you and your companions. 
Everyone wants to go ashore, but the act of landing may be 
the most dangerous part of your ordeal.
Basic landing principles
 
Before you think about landing, consider the following facts, 
which can mean the difference between life and death:
 
✓ If you have stormy conditions, stay offshore and wait 
until things calm down. In storms, generally speaking, 
the closer you get to land, the more violent the waves 
become. If you have a sea anchor, a drogue, or the ability 
to paddle, deploy these defensive measures to hold your 
ground until things calm down.
 
✓ If it’s dark out, try to wait until dawn to land. Going 
ashore in the dark is excessively dangerous. Waiting for 
dawn takes a lot of discipline, but this alone can save 
your life. (We know. We can remember nights when we 
really wanted to come in to land but didn’t — because it 
was suicide!)
 
✓ If you know the tide cycle, try to land when the tide 
is coming in. When the tide is going out and opposing 
incoming waves, the seas peak more sharply, making a 
landing more dangerous.
 
✓ Try to land on the leeward side of an island or pen-
insula or near a headland or jetty that breaks up the 

 Chapter 21: Emergency Travel and Navigation at Sea 411
waves. The leeward side is the area of land located in the 
wind’s shadow; it’s where the wind is not directly blow-
ing on shore. A headland is a bulge of land, and a jetty is 
a finger of land, and they both protrude from the main 
shoreline. Usually, neither of these landforms has as vio-
lent a surf as a beach.
 
✓ Try to avoid any area where you can hear the breakers 
before you can see them — especially if you see a high 
wall of mist over the breaker line. These are signs of 
excessively violent conditions.
 
✓ Look for a lagoon, bay, or sandy beach that has less 
wave energy.
 
• Lagoons on volcanic islands: Generally speaking, 
lagoons on volcanic islands have inlets that face the 
wind. This would be the only time you’d want to 
approach land on the shore where the wind is 
blowing. Ideally, you’d like to sail and paddle 
through the inlet and into the lagoon.
 
• Lagoons on coral islands: Generally speaking, 
lagoons on these types of islands are on the leeward 
side. If you’re on the approach to a low-lying tropical 
island — especially if you can hear the surf and see 
a veil of mist around the surf line — you must do 
everything you can to navigate around it and come 
in for your landing on the back side.
Procedures for landing
We hope you manage to get to land, and we hope that your 
landing does nothing more than give you a fine old war story, 
but the truth is that landings are usually not romantic or fun 
at all. So get ready:
 
✓ When you know you’re going to land, heavily reinforce 
your paddles and bailers. These are the most important 
objects in your raft, and they’re most likely to break just 
when you need them. Use tape or rope or anything you 
have to do this.
 
✓ Dress yourself in every piece of clothing you have for 
protection against the landing. Use anything you have 
handy as extra protection. If you’re barefoot, tape card-
board, wood, or metal to your feet. If you have duct tape, 
now’s the time to use it all.

Part IV: Surviving on the Seas, Oceans, and Great Lakes 
412
 
✓ Tie down all objects inside the boat, and tie important 
electronics, wrapped in waterproof plastic, to your body. 
You still need to be able to swim, no doubt, but if you land 
on an uninhabited coast; you want to land with a stripped-
down collection of your best gear, intact and functioning.
 
✓ Deflate the overhead canopy of the life raft. That way, 
you won’t be trapped below during capsize.
 
✓ If you’re in a small, rigid boat, consider backing in. 
Simply tie a line to something heavy (such as a big battery 
or a tire) and hurl it over the front (bow) of the boat. 
This gives you a drogue that keeps the front of the boat 
pointed toward the surf while you’re landing. The surf 
has more than enough power to slowly push you — 
backward — onto the land. This is a safe, common 
method used by mariners throughout the world.
 
✓ On approach to any shoreline that has steep land 
nearby, such as a cliff or a mountain, be ready for the 
wind to die. High cliffs frequently block the wind and 
cause a vacuum near the shore. If you’re using sails to 
guide your craft to safety, these areas can mean serious 
trouble. Be ready with your paddles, and have the 
paddling chores already assigned.
 
✓ Be ready for multiple lines of breakers. Many times it 
looks like you have to get through only one line of big 
waves. Watch out — you may face two or more.
 
✓ Stay with the raft or disabled boat for as long as you 
can. You’ll most likely get stuck — hung up on a rock or 
some kind of coral. Try to stay with the vessel; the ocean 
has the nasty habit of hammering boats, and hopefully, 
it will hammer you ashore. Don’t get caught between the 
boat and a rock or shore.
 
✓ Cut your drogue or sea anchor only as a very last 
resort. If you stall and you’re still far offshore, you may 
have to cut it free.
Ideally, you want to wash up on shore and quite literally crawl 
out onto the sand. That may sound crazy, but that’s a safe 
landing!

First Aid on the Water
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the risks of hypothermia, cold shock, and drowning
▶ Treating typical sea illnesses
▶ Dealing with dangerous sea creatures
E
ven just a little knowledge and ability can make a big 
difference when you’re trying to survive emergencies on 
the sea. Knowing the signs of danger — and some of those 
signs are only visible if you know exactly what to look for — 
can save lives, including your own.
In this chapter, we show you how to respond to cold water 
immersion and near drowning. After that we show you how to 
handle the medical problems you may encounter when you 
drift in a life raft, as well as how to treat bites and stings from 
sea creatures.
Responding to Water Casualties
In any survival situation on the water, you face four major 
threats. Most people know about drowning, but you should 
know that anytime you go into the water — especially when 
you go into cold water — you’re also at risk for the following:
 
✓ Hypothermia
 
✓ Cold shock response
 
✓ Near drowning
In this section, we first tell you how to get people out of the 
water so you can treat them, and then we show you how to 
deal with these dangers separately.

Part IV: Surviving on the Seas, Oceans, and Great Lakes 
414
Getting someone out of the water
When rescuing someone from the water, always try to reach 
or throw something to the person in the water, so you can haul 
her in. This is almost invariably better than going into the water 
yourself, unless you’re trained in lifesaving, because the weight 
and movement of the person in peril can easily overwhelm you. 
Here’s how to get to someone out of the water:
 
✓ Reaching: Remember to plant yourself firmly. Use one 
hand to hold onto the vessel and one hand to extend a 
long stick or pole to the person in the water. Expect a 
heavy tug when the person grabs on.
 
✓ Throwing: The best thing to throw is a coil of line or a life 
ring, a circular flotation device found on practically every 
vessel in the world. When throwing, remember to use a 
long, swinging forehand (don’t throw it like Frisbee — this 
never works!), and always hold on with your other hand. 
Going overboard is very easy because of the momentum 
your body develops when you hurl the line or ring.
 
✓ Getting in water: If you do have to go into the water, tie 
a tether to your body so you can get back safely.
For pointers on how to help someone into a life raft, see 
Chapter 19.
Understanding hypothermia
Hypothermia is the progressive cooling of the human body, 
which leads to mental and physical impairment and later, 
death. If you’re in the water, hypothermia can kill you much 
faster than on land, because it can incapacitate you so much 
that your mouth falls below the water’s surface, thus causing 
drowning — long before you actually perish from the cold.
 
Hypothermia can occur even if you’re in tropical waters. It 
can sometimes take days, whereas it can take only minutes in 
frigid seas, but enough heat can eventually leave your body to 
cause hypothermia.
Anytime you’ve been exposed to a water environment, be on 
guard for one or more of the symptoms of hypothermia:
 
✓ Extreme shivering

 Chapter 22: First Aid on the Water 415
 
✓ Bluish coloring in the lips or skin
 
✓ Apathy and the desire to lie down or give up
 
✓ Dizziness, disorientation, slurred speech
 
✓ A stop in shivering (very dangerous)
If you or one of your companions exhibits the symptoms in 
the preceding bulleted list, treat for hypothermia. Here are 
the main points of treatment:
 
✓ Try to keep the subject from exerting himself to the 
point of tiring. Climbing out of the water can put an 
enormous strain on a person with hypothermia. Assist 
the subject as much as possible.
 
✓ Try to keep the subject’s body horizontal, even when 
pulling him out of the water. After he has cleared the 
water, elevate the feet slightly, and, if possible, put him 
in the recovery position (which we cover in Chapter 13).
 
✓ Warm the subject slowly, especially if he has been in 
the water for a long time. Warm the torso and neck first. 
Don’t warm the limbs. You may have to hold the subject 
close to your body to transfer heat.
 
✓ Monitor the airway closely, and don’t allow him to 
inhale vomit. Be prepared for afterdrop, which is a 
continued decline of central body temperature after the 
rewarming process has begun.
Turn to Chapter 13 for a detailed explanation of how to treat 
hypothermia, the most deadly of conditions.
Treating cold shock response
Cold shock response is a sudden incapacitation of the human 
body due to cold water immersion. It can incapacitate you so 
suddenly that you can’t swim, inflate a life vest, or climb into 
a life raft. Signs of cold shock response include the following:
 
✓ Accelerated heartbeat
 
✓ Dizziness and disorientation
 
✓ Hyperventilation
 
✓ Motor skill impairment

Part IV: Surviving on the Seas, Oceans, and Great Lakes 
416
 
Anyone immersed in water that’s less than 50°F (10°C) is 
considered at risk for cold shock response.
When subjects perish from cold shock response, their core 
temperatures aren’t at the level necessary to cause death 
from hypothermia. Cold shock deaths usually come from the 
inability to move (the muscles don’t respond) or sometimes 
cardiac arrest, either of which may lead to drowning.
Treat cold shock response the same way you treat hypothermia, 
which we discuss in the preceding section. If you’re with 
someone who’s at risk of cold shock response, monitor the 
person closely (don’t leave the person unattended) and be 
ready to perform CPR.
 
Studies have demonstrated that humans, if exposed to cold 
water often enough, can build up a tolerance to cold shock. 
If you’re accustomed to crossing cold rivers or swimming in 
cold seas but you’re with someone who isn’t, be ready for 
the possibility that your companion will go into cold shock 
response, even though you don’t feel any effects yourself.
Handling near drowning
Drowning is death due to asphyxiation from fluid in the 
lungs. Unfortunately, you can’t do anything for those who’ve 
expired. But many times people inhale enough fluid simply to 
lose consciousness, become incapacitated, or have difficulty 
breathing. This condition is called partial drowning or near 
drowning.
Reviving near-drowning subjects
You can revive some near-drowning subjects through 
resuscitation. Treatment involves performing CPR and 
allowing gravity to withdraw as much fluid out of the lungs 
as possible. Follow these steps:
 
1. Remove the subject from the water, trying to keep 
the head, especially the mouth, lower than the rest 
of the body.
 
 This prevents the accidental inhalation of water that 
may be in the throat.

 Chapter 22: First Aid on the Water 417
 
2. Lay the subject down on the ground and check her 
airway, breathing, and circulation (ABC); perform 
CPR if the subject isn’t breathing and has no pulse.
 
 Continue CPR until you’re exhausted. The only good 
thing we can say about long-term cold water immersion 
is that sometimes it slows the body’s functions down 
to such an extent that people survive for a very long 
time, even after they’ve lost consciousness.
 
3. If the subject is breathing and has a pulse, place her 
in the recovery position, and make sure the mouth is 
free of obstructions like grass or clothing.
 
 Water and vomit should be able to drain freely from 
the airway.
 
4. Monitor the subject (as we explain in the next section).
For more on the ABCs, CPR, and the recovery system, flip to 
Chapter 13.
Monitoring someone after near drowning
 
Even just a small amount of inhaled water can cause the lungs 
to become swollen and congested, a deadly process that can 
take anywhere from a few minutes to a couple of hours. More 
often than not, death occurs after the subject has been pulled 
from the water and seems to be recovering. Watch near-
drowning subjects for the following signs:
 
✓ Incessant coughing
 
✓ Coughing up water, froth, or bubbles
 
✓ Shortness of breath
 
✓ Lightheadedness and disorientation
If you or someone around you exhibits these signs, go to the 
nearest medical facility. If that’s impossible, be ready to 
perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation or CPR. Putting the 
subject in the recovery position can help.

Part IV: Surviving on the Seas, Oceans, and Great Lakes 
418
Treating Common Sea Ailments
Most of the problems we talk about in this section aren’t 
deadly by themselves, but they can become deadly when 
they’re combined with other conditions, fatigue, or 
demoralization.
 
Dehydration is also a serious concern at sea. For information 
on collecting and rationing water, go to Chapter 20.
Seasickness
Seasickness, or simply motion sickness, occurs when a vessel’s 
rolling motion irritates your sense of balance. It usually begins 
with a bout of yawning, followed by headache, nausea and 
finally, vomiting. Seasickness usually lasts no more than 
three days, although in severe cases it can be persistent. It’s 
unfortunately very common in life rafts.
You can take medications to prevent seasickness, but generally 
speaking, you have to take the medicine before the onset of 
the symptoms. The most common over-the-counter medicine 
is dimenhydrinate (Dramamine), which is sometimes in first 
aid kits. One effective prescription treatment is the transdermal 
patch of scopolamine. A transdermal patch is a dime-sized 
adhesive gauze that sticks to your skin and releases medication 
into your body over a period of days.
 
Prevention and treatment are basically the same thing when 
dealing with seasickness. Your goal is to try to relieve the 
irritation as much as you can. The following list includes 
the most reliable methods for preventing and treating 
seasickness — experiment with each method until you find 
one that works for you:
 
✓ Look at the distant horizon. The distant horizon is the 
only thing at sea that doesn’t move, and looking at it can 
prevent your sense of balance from being irritated.
 
✓ Try not to sit down. Sitting only makes seasickness worse. 
When you stand, you allow your body to compensate a 
little for the boat’s motion. In a life raft, you may not have 
any choice, although you can always try to kneel.

 Chapter 22: First Aid on the Water 419
 
✓ Stay active. Give yourself something to do to take your 
mind off of being seasick.
 
✓ Change the motion of the vessel. This may be impossible 
to do in a life raft, but if you’re in a vessel you can steer, 
try turning to a new course so the vessel has a different 
motion in the waves. Some rolling motions are easier to 
take than others.
 
✓ Change your location on the boat or raft. You may be in 
a position where you’re getting a bad motion, one that’s 
making you sick.
 
✓ Get some rest, or even better, some sleep. Seasickness 
and fatigue are buddies — wherever you find one, you 
usually find the other. When resting, lie on your back 
with your face up and your eyes closed.
 
✓ Eat ginger. Take ginger capsules the moment you feel the 
symptoms. If the symptoms are advanced, and especially 
if you’re about to vomit, try nibbling on sugar-coated 
ginger pieces. Many consider ginger to be ineffective, but 
we’ve used it with great success.
 
✓ Drink something. If you’re vomiting, you’re dehydrating, 
and that weakens you. If you’re not dehydrated, consider a 
clear soda, if you have access to it, to settle your stomach.
Sunburn and heat maladies
Sunburn is a serious threat on the sea. When combined 
with other problems, it can cause you to go into shock. Do 
everything you can to stay out of the sun, and keep in mind 
that the sun’s reflection on the water can burn you, too. Try 
to keep every inch of your skin covered. Use sunblock if 
you have it, or try making improvised sunblock from mud, 
charcoal, or used motor oil. You can relieve pain with any 
type of anti-inflammatory, such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, 
Motrin), or naproxen sodium (Aleve).
If you’re in a life raft at sea, you also have to guard against 
the typical problems that heat can cause — heat exhaustion 
and, worse, heat stroke. These two conditions come from 
hyperthermia, or the overheating of the body. For symptoms 
and treatments of hyperthermia, go to Chapter 17.

Part IV: Surviving on the Seas, Oceans, and Great Lakes 
420
Water-glare blindness
Though rarely a permanent condition, water-glare blindness 
is a very painful eye irritation, somewhat like sunburn in the 
eyes, that comes from the sun’s reflection on the water. It can 
cause your eyes to become bloodshot and severely swollen.
To prevent water-glare blindness, wear sunglasses or make 
improvised sunglasses (see Chapter 16). You can also apply 
dark coloring under the eyes to divert the sun’s rays. A large 
stripe of dark paint, charcoal dust, or used oil can absorb 
harmful rays away from your eyes.
Treat advanced cases of water-glare blindness by bandaging 
the eyes with sterile dressings. Don’t use salt water to cool this 
condition — use cold packs for pain relief if you have them.
Skin chafe and saltwater sores
Of all the unheroic injuries, skin chafe has to be the most 
painful. Anytime skin rubs continuously on any surface at sea, 
you’re going to have a problem — no exceptions. If your skin 
is rubbing on a surface like the side of the raft, try to change 
your body’s position or try to protect the skin. If left unattended, 
skin chafe quickly degenerates into saltwater sores.
Saltwater sores are small pockets of inflammation that form in 
breaks in the skin. They usually start out as pea-sized ulcers, 
but they can widen to become dime-sized or larger.
To treat saltwater sores, scrupulously clean every break in 
your skin with soap and water if possible. Bathing in fresh 
water can help tremendously, but if none is available, use salt 
water. Soap doesn’t make suds when used with salt water, and 
salt water also irritates the sores a little, but it’s better than 
not cleaning them at all.
Treating Bites and Stings
We wish we could tell you just to avoid the dangerous animals 
of the sea, but unfortunately, the sea has a way of throwing 
them in your way, regardless of what you do. This section 
tells you how to treat injuries from these creatures of the sea.

 Chapter 22: First Aid on the Water 421
Jellyfish
Jellyfish stings occur when you brush against the animal’s 
membranes and it releases venom into your skin. All stings 
are painful, but some are fatal. The white, translucent box 
jellyfish, which inhabits the waters north of Australia, is 
probably the most deadly. An animal that looks like a jellyfish, 
but is actually a colony of small animals, is the clear, purple 
Portuguese man-of-war, which is present in all the world’s 
oceans. Reactions to serious stings include nausea, vomiting, 
shock, and cardiac arrest.
To treat jellyfish stings, follow these procedures:
 
1. If you have access to vinegar, pour it on the tentacles; 
otherwise, use seawater.
 
 This neutralizes the stinging mechanism.
 
2. Remove the tentacles using tweezers, sticks, or gloves.
 
 Don’t touch the tentacles with your hands.
 
3. Apply shaving cream, baking soda, or even mud to 
the wound, and then shave the area with a razor or a 
knife.
 
4. Apply more water or vinegar (or seawater) to the 
wound to dilute the poison.
 
 If the tentacles have gotten in the eyes, irrigate liberally 
with fresh water. If in the mouth, rinse with a solution 
of one part vinegar to three parts water.
 
5. Treat the wound like a sprain and use the RICES 
procedure (see Chapter 13).
Keep in mind that if you or one of your companions has been 
stung, CPR may be necessary.
Sea snakes
Sea snakes usually live out their entire lives on the sea. Most 
strikes don’t envenomate the subject enough to cause seri-
ous harm; however, you should consider all sea snakes to be 
dangerously venomous. The symptoms of being envenomed 
don’t always show up immediately after a strike. The first sign 
is usually a headache and aching muscles. You treat a sea 

Part IV: Surviving on the Seas, Oceans, and Great Lakes 
422
snake bite like you treat other snakebites, which we detail in 
Chapter 13.
Stinging fish and stingrays
Fish stings can damage large portions of tissue and be 
exceedingly painful — the pain can sometimes last for days 
or even weeks.
 
Never try to handle any fish that has spines, points, spikes, or 
bristles. Never handle a fish that’s spotted, that looks like a 
stone or a rock, or that has zebra stripes or tiger stripes. And 
never wade near a reef barefoot.
Anytime you believe stingrays may be nearby, keep your feet 
off the seabed. Stingrays swim across the seabed, and if they 
feel threatened, they may sting you with the barb on the end of 
their tail, which is sometimes fatal. If you hook a stingray while 
fishing, consider cutting the line rather than boarding the ray.
If you get stung, wash the wound immediately with soap and 
water if possible. If you have access to hot water, immerse the 
wound in the warmest water the person can handle without 
being scalded. Repeated immersions in hot water should help. 
Be prepared to treat for shock and administer CPR.
Cone shells and terebra shells
Cone shells are small gastropods that look like miniature, 
brightly colored pine cones, between 1 and 4 inches (2.5 and 
10 centimeters) in length. You can find them in the Indian and 
Pacific Oceans, and they frequently travel across the seabed, 
usually at night. Don’t handle cone shells, because they can 
be lethal — they have a venomous barb that they use like a 
harpoon to kill their food.
Terebra shells also live in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. 
They’re thin and usually 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 centimeters) 
in length. Like the cone shell, the terebra shell has a stinging 
barb and should be considered very dangerous, although the 
stings are rarely fatal.
Like ray stings, you treat shell stings by immersing the wound 
in hottest water the person can stand without scalding.

Ten Ways to Practice 
Wilderness Survival Skills
In This Chapter
▶ Building a fire
▶ Creating survival tools
▶ Practicing techniques
A
s you can imagine, many of the skills we talk about in 
this book require some practice before you can do them 
every time. However, performing many of these just once is a 
quantum leap that can boost your confidence considerably.
This chapter covers several skills you may want to practice, 
including building tools, finding direction, and performing 
CPR. We start with the fire exercises because they’re the ones 
you should master first. (Note: When working on a fire-building 
exercise, have a garden hose or other fire extinguisher at the 
ready, don’t build next to anything flammable, and be sure to 
check into local regulations regarding campfires or open fires 
before you start building one!)
Make a Fire with Two Matches
Your ability to start a fire can mean life or death in cold 
conditions, so practicing your ability to successfully ignite 
a fire and keep it going is the cornerstone of being able to 
survive in the wilderness. One great practice exercise is to 
take two matches into the backyard and see what you can do 
to make a fire. Remember, you get only two matches to get 
the whole thing started, so overbuild everything. Get as much 
of the following as you can:

Part V: The Part of Tens 
426
 
✓ Tinder: Try to use the wispiest of fibers, like a dense wad 
of hair-thin scrapings from the inside of a dry piece of 
bark. A dense wad of dry, dead grass works well, as does 
straw. You can also try something more substantial, like 
thin wood shavings or leaves.
 
✓ Kindling: Only use wire-thin twigs that snap cleanly in 
your hands — that indicates they’re completely dry. The 
largest kindling in your arsenal should be pencil-sized 
sticks that are so dry that they snap cleanly. Snap!
 
✓ Fuel: Use thumb-sized sticks and larger.
 
Build the fire meticulously before you start, and make sure 
you build a wind break around it. Hold the box of matches 
firmly and stab down. Give the match a few seconds to really 
start burning, and then ignite your tinder at lowest point 
possible. You get only two tries. For more on fire craft, see 
Chapter 5.
Make a Fire with a 
Magnifying Glass
To start a fire with a magnifying glass, you need pretty strong 
sunlight. Here’s how to light your fire:
 
1. Find a spot where you can hold the magnifying glass 
so that direct sunlight can reach it (that is, out of any 
shadows).
 
2. Build your fire as in the preceding section.
 
 The fire-starting method using a magnifying glass (or 
sparks) requires you to use exceedingly flammable 
tinder, such as a golf-ball sized wad of lint collected 
from your clothes. This tinder ignites fast and burns 
for only two to three seconds, so you have to use it 
to ignite secondary tinder, like bark scrapings, dead 
grass, straw, wood shavings, or leaves.
 
3. Hold the magnifying glass in the sunlight, a few 
inches over the primary tinder, until a bright white 
spot appears on the tinder; when this happens, 
adjust the distance from the magnifying glass to the 
tinder until the spot is as small as you can get it.

 Chapter 23: Ten Ways to Practice Wilderness Survival Skills 427
 
 Now it’s at its hottest, and in a few seconds the tinder 
should catch fire.
 
4. Use the primary tinder to ignite your secondary 
tinder; use that, in turn, to light your kindling.
Make a Fire with a Bow Drill
Making a bow drill is a fun afternoon activity that can help 
you figure out a lot of info that’s valuable outdoors. By making 
and using your own bow drill, you can discover
 
✓ What kind of cordage does — and doesn’t — work for 
the bowstring (long, tough boot laces are good; however, 
although the drawstring from sweatpants may work, it’s 
perilously fragile, and it slips)
 
✓ How to use a branch to make the bow
 
✓ The feeling of the right type of friction you need to make 
an ember
Chapter 5 outlines the how-to to make a bow drill fire.
Make a Flotation Device 
from Your Pants
You can use a swimming pool for a few hours to figure out 
how to make an improvised life preserver from a pair of 
trousers (as we show in Chapter 18). Here’s how:
 
✓ Start in the shallow end of the pool (standing in chest-deep 
water) to see how the inflation process works. Tie tight 
knots in the bottom of each pant leg and grasp the pants 
by the waistband. Hold the pants behind your head. In 
one quick motion, swing the pants over your head and 
down onto the water, trapping the air inside. Cinch the 
waist tightly with a belt.
 
✓ After you see how your pants inflate, try going through 
the whole process in the deeper end of the pool, where 
you have to take your pants off while floating and/or 
treading water. If you have a lot of trouble removing your 

Part V: The Part of Tens 
428
shoes and pants while you’re treading water, you can 
take a good lungful of air, try to float calmly as you can, 
and then (very gingerly) untie your shoes and slip off 
your trousers.
 
 If you’re not a good swimmer, obviously the deep-end 
practice session can be lethal, because you may get 
tangled in your clothes and drown. Don’t try it unless 
you’re very confident and competent in water.
This is a very realistic simulation, and it’s one of the best 
survival practice sessions you can do. If your pants don’t 
inflate well, try submerging for a moment and blowing air up 
into the partially inflated pants legs.
Find North with the Sky’s Help
If you know which direction is north, the rest of the directions 
are easy enough to find. If you face north, east is on your 
right, west is on your left, and south is behind you. To locate 
north, just look to the sun and stars for direction (Chapter 10 
covers these methods in detail):
 
✓ If it’s lunchtime — midday — and you’re in North 
America, Northern Asia, or Europe, the sun is due south 
of you. Put the sun at your back, and you’re facing north.
 
✓ Use a wristwatch to find north in the daytime. (If you 
have a digital watch, you can draw a simulated watch 
face, with the current time, on a slip of paper.) If you’re 
in the Northern Hemisphere, point the hour hand of your 
watch directly at the sun. Due south lies halfway between 
the hour hand and the 12. When you’re facing due south, 
north is directly behind you. (Note: If you’re on local 
Daylight Saving Time, you have to adjust your watch by 
subtracting an hour. You can either wind it back manually, 
or you can simply estimate where the hour hand would 
be if you were to set the watch back.)
 
✓ Use a simple stick-shadow compass to find your east-
west line, and then derive north from that. Place a 3-foot 
(0.9-meter) stick in the ground and mark the end of 
its shadow. Fifteen minutes later, mark the end of its 
shadow again. Put your left foot on the first mark and 
your right on the second, and you’re facing north.

 Chapter 23: Ten Ways to Practice Wilderness Survival Skills 429
 
✓ Go out on a clear night and locate the Big Dipper and 
Cassiopeia. Between them lies the North Star. This 
method only works in the Northern Hemisphere; if you’re 
in the Southern, you want to look for the Pointer Stars 
and the Southern Cross to find due south.
Make a Tripod
You can use a tripod of stout poles to hang a pot over a stove, 
to use as a rack for drying clothes or food by a fire, and to 
smoke food. In the wilderness, you’d make a tripod from 
three saplings, stripped of bark and each about 2.5 inches 
(6.5 centimeters) in diameter. At home, you can simulate 
these with broomsticks or other similar poles.
Most people need about three tries before they understand 
the amount of tension they need on the lines to make the 
tripod work. Use whatever kind of cordage you can scrounge 
up at home (such as electrical wire or clothesline) to simulate 
the realities of having less-than-ideal materials in a survival 
situation. Chapter 14 covers cordage and lashing in detail.
Make a Bow and Arrow
A bow-and-arrow project makes for a fun afternoon. The main 
obstacle to making a bow in the city is finding a piece of green 
(living) wood to carve into the bow. You need a sapling about 
1.5 to 2 inches (3.8 to 5 centimeters) in diameter. After you 
have this, the rest of the elements are relatively straightforward, 
as we outline in Chapter 14. Find a safe place to practice 
shooting a bow — the local park isn’t good because you could 
injure or kill someone! Call your local police station for advice 
on where you can shoot your bow and arrow.
 
A good bow and arrow is lethal, and you shouldn’t try to build 
anything less than that. You want to develop the skills to 
make something you could use to hunt in the wild. This is a 
real weapon, so don’t point it at anyone.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
430
Make a Transpiration Bag
Water is a major concern in any survival situation, and you 
should know several places to find it outdoors and several 
ways to extract it from wilderness resources (such as plants). 
Chapter 7 addresses the actual how-to directions on making 
transpiration bags, tools you use to collect water from plants.
A transpiration bag is simply a large bag (preferably plastic) 
that you wrap around the bushy end of a tree or bush limb. 
The resulting assembly should be about the size of a beach 
ball, and you should fit it with a drinking hose. As water 
naturally evaporates from the plant tissues, it collects inside 
the bag.
 
Beware that covering a whole plant with a bag can kill it; try 
to cover no more than 20 percent of a plant’s leaves every 
time you use a transpiration bag.
Use a CD to Practice Signaling
You can practice signaling for help by taking an old CD (and a 
friend) to a park on a sunny day. Without blinding anyone, try 
to use the CD to flash the sun at your friend from across the 
park. Have your friend wear sunglasses to prevent light injury.
Sight directly through the hole in the center of the CD: Put 
your friend “in the hole” and then tilt the CD very slightly to 
put the sun on the target. To help you aim, frame your target 
between two fingers held up like a V. Have your friend raise an 
arm when he or she sees the distinctive flash so you can tell 
the method is working.
To make the exercise more fun, have your friend stand in 
various places. Then see how fast you can get at spotting your 
friend and then picking the CD off the ground and signaling 
successfully. Or try a moving target: Signal your friend while 
he or she walks.

 Chapter 23: Ten Ways to Practice Wilderness Survival Skills 431
Practice CPR
At home, you can practice cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
(CPR) simply by going through the motions of finding the 
right place press on the chest, lacing your fingers in the right 
way (to do the compressions), and figuring out how to get the 
rhythm of compressions and breaths down. Doing this is a 
good idea because it builds memories that you can refer to if 
you end up in a bad spot. Remember: When practicing, don’t 
actually do the compressions or breaths; just practice the 
motions and the rhythm. Of course, taking a course from the 
Red Cross is the best way to practice CPR, and it’s inexpen-
sive. For more on CPR, see Chapter 13.

Ten Quick Escapes
In This Chapter
▶ Escaping from cars and planes in the water
▶ Getting out of some tight spots in the wilderness
W
hen you get home, you can tell everyone how you 
cobbled together a shelter, built a fire, and finally 
flagged down your rescuers. The most dramatic part of your 
story, however, usually comes when you have to tell how you 
made your great escape. In this chapter, we tell you how to 
get out of ten high-adrenaline situations.
Escaping a Sinking Car
Whether an accident sends your car into a river or a flash 
flood sweeps you off the road, here’s how to escape if your 
car ends up in water:
 
1. Brace for impact.
 
 Put your arms up in the shape of an X to protect your 
face and grab the shoulder strap of your safety belt.
 
2. The moment you strike the water and stop moving, 
roll the windows down (not up) and unlock the 
doors.
 
 A flooded electrical system prevents electrical locks 
from unlocking or windows from coming down.
 
3. If no water is flooding through the window yet, 
unbuckle your seatbelt and go out the side window 
right away; if water is already pouring in, stay 
buckled up and wait.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
434
 
 If the water is flooding in or you can’t get the window 
to roll down, keep your seatbelt buckled. The flooding 
water can overwhelm you and push you around in the 
car, disorienting you. Also, as the car floods, it will 
most likely roll, and staying in the seat helps to keep 
you oriented.
 
4. Wait until the water reaches your chin and then take 
a deep breath and hold it.
 
 You can probably hold your breath for about 45 
seconds, which is plenty of time to make it out alive.
 
5. If you’ve gone down fast and you can’t roll down the 
windows or open a door, use a heavy object, like a 
flashlight or hammer (you can carry one under the 
driver’s seat) to break a side window; don’t try to 
break the windshield — it’s too strong.
 
 Many companies manufacture survival tools specifically 
made to both cut seatbelts and knock out a window. 
Every car should have one convenient to reach, and 
everyone should know how to use it.
 
6. Swim out through the window if it’s down; if not, try 
the door.
 
 You must wait until the car floods and the pressures 
are equalized — inside the car and out — before you 
can open the door. Even when the car is flooded, 
getting the door open is difficult, but you can do it.
 
 If you’re disoriented when you reach the outside of 
the car, follow bubbles; they tend to go toward the 
surface.
Escaping a Small Plane in Water
Many small planes turn upside down when they ditch in the 
water, so you’re most likely to find yourself inverted, with the 
cabin filling with water. Keep composed — you probably have 
about 30 seconds, which is plenty of time to do this maneuver 
right.
Wait until the motion of the plane has completely stopped. 
Identify your exit (the nearest door handle) with one hand, 

 Chapter 24: Ten Quick Escapes 435
and with your other hand, find a point of reference inside the 
cabin, like the dash or the handle near the ceiling. Release 
your seat belt and pull yourself out through the exit you’ve 
identified. If that door is stuck, you may have to go out the 
other. If all the doors are stuck, break out a window. Use a 
heavy tool, if possible, such as a fire extinguisher. Kick with 
your legs; they’re much stronger than your arms.
Righting a Small Boat or Canoe
Small boats and canoes are easy to tip if you’re not careful. 
Unless your vessel is very easy to right, don’t bother trying to 
do it on your own unless you’re an expert and have practiced 
it a lot. Some small vessels have good flotation capabilities, so 
you can actually sit in a sunken canoe and paddle it to shore, 
even if it’s 90 percent underwater. Here’s what to do if your 
vessel capsizes.
 
As soon as you’re in the water, be sure to put on a personal 
flotation device (PFD) if you’re not already wearing one.
You can usually right a small sailboat that’s flopped on its 
side by standing on the daggerboard (also known as a 
centerboard) and letting your weight roll the boat upright. 
If the boat has turned all the way over (turned turtle), you 
may have to step on the gunwale (the ridge that runs along 
the edge of sides of the boat), grasp the daggerboard with 
your hands, and lean back to slowly turn the boat on its side.
If you were in a canoe and you have a friend with you, go 
under the overturned boat (with your PFD still on). When 
you’re underneath, the two of you have to push the canoe 
up out of the water a few inches and then throw it over to 
one side. Decide, when under the inverted canoe, which 
side you’re going to throw it to, and then count, “One, two, 
three” to a combined upwards shove. Many times, doing this 
requires the two of you to kick with your legs at the same 
time to give yourself just enough buoyancy. If you have two 
canoes, one capsized and the other upright, you can lift the 
inverted canoe out of the water and slide it crosswise across 
the floating canoe; then turn it over and launch it back into 
the water.

436
Escaping a Forest Fire
Forest fires can move quickly and wipe out almost anything in 
their path. For humans, the main dangers are suffocation (the 
fire consumes so much oxygen that there’s literally nothing to 
breathe), choking (breathing in ash or dense smoke), and of 
course, burning. Here’s how to escape a forest fire:
 
1. Make a mask from a bandana or other material to 
protect yourself from smoke inhalation.
 
 Use it to cover your mouth and nose tightly.
 
2. Try to get downhill and into a clearing with little or 
no fuel to burn.
 
 Fire moves upward fastest, so going downhill buys you 
time. Sandy areas like dry riverbeds are good places 
to go. A forest clearing is better than a fully vegetated 
forest. If you find a lake or river, get in and wait for the 
fire to pass.
 
3. If you can’t find cover and a fire is coming close, dig 
a ditch, get in, and cover yourself with as much sand 
or dirt as you can.
 
 Be sure the sand or dirt doesn’t contain a large 
percentage of dead wood or forest duff, the soft, 
decaying layer of vegetation that carpets many forest 
floors; this material explodes into flames.
 
4. When the fire has passed, stay in the areas that are 
burnt off and begin efforts to signal for help.
 
 With nothing left to burn, the fire can’t come back.
Escaping a Bee Swarm
If bees start swarming, here’s how you can evade the attack:
 
✓ Run as fast as you can for dense vegetation; they may 
lose your trail there.
 
✓ If you have a campfire going, run to it and try to make a 
lot of smoke with wet vegetation to deter the bees.

 Chapter 24: Ten Quick Escapes 437
 
✓ If you have a blanket or tarp, wrap yourself in it tightly 
and wait them out.
 
✓ If you can find a body of water, you can lie in it, on your 
back, breathing with just your lips out of the water or 
using a reed to breathe (a fun thing to practice on a hot 
afternoon) However, the bees may still be there when 
you surface.
 
Try not to crush bees; their dead bodies emit an alarm to 
others.
Surviving a Bear Encounter
Bears are common in many wilderness regions. With bears — 
from black bears to grizzlies and even polar bears — the best 
offense is a good defense. Let them know you’re coming in the 
first place; some people wear a bell when they hike in bear 
country, yell, “Hey bear!” loudly every few minutes and/or hit 
trees or rocks with sticks. These sounds often frighten bears 
away before an encounter even happens. For more on keeping 
bears away from you, see Chapter 15.
 
Although bears are unpredictable, some general advice has 
proven valuable. Here’s how to handle a bear encounter:
 
✓ If a bear spots you: Don’t run, and don’t make eye 
contact. Hold your ground for a moment and then back 
away slowly. You can try speaking in calm monotone 
voice to reassure the bear. If you’re between a mother 
and a cub, get away from them as fast as you can without 
making jerky, panicky moves.
 
✓ If the bear rushes you: Hold your ground. This is 
important but hard to do.
 
✓ If a bear attacks you: Don’t fight back. A bear is much 
stronger than you are. Play dead by curling up in a ball 
and protecting your neck and skull with your hands. (The 
only time to fight back is if the bear doesn’t leave you 
alone after you’ve played dead for a while; then, it has 
decided to eat you, and you might as well fight. Go for 
the eyes.)

Part V: The Part of Tens 
438
 
Many people venturing into bear country carry bear spray, a 
large canister containing some kind of pepper or deterrent 
that bears don’t like to get in their snouts or eyes. Sometimes 
it deters bears, other times it doesn’t, and sometimes it 
backfires when the wind blows the spray back into the 
human’s face! All things considered, carrying bear spray is a 
good idea, but be sure you know how to use it, and don’t let it 
fool you into thinking you’re safe from bears.
 
The most unpredictable and dangerous bear is the polar 
bear. In a survival situation, only a high-powered rifle or a 
large-gauge shotgun loaded with slugs are realistic defenses. 
Don’t get caught in the high Arctic without one of these 
weapons and the knowledge of how to use them effectively 
and humanely. If you’re forced to shoot a polar bear, aim for 
the lungs first. If you disable the bear, be sure to kill it with a 
final, lethal shot, to prevent suffering.
Encountering a Mountain Lion
Mountain lions (also known as cougars, pumas, or panthers) 
are big cats, roughly 100 to 200 pounds (45 to 90 kilograms) 
in weight. In spite of constant media hysteria to the contrary, 
attacks on humans are rare. Mountain lions are opportunistic 
predators, which means that they’re looking for the easiest 
thing to eat.
When a mountain lion confronts you, you want to convince it 
that you’re the hardest thing in the world to eat. Make yourself 
larger by opening your jacket and spreading it out to the sides 
or by lifting your backpack over your head. You can also try 
holding up branches of trees or large boards — anything that 
makes you appear to be a very large animal.
 
Never run from a mountain lion. Instead, you want to signal 
to the animal that you’re not a sheep or deer. Do not crouch, 
limp, or act in any way infirm. The cat knows the difference 
between strong and weak prey.
If the animal attacks, it usually goes for the neck or head. You 
can fight off mountain lions. A sharp blow to the bridge of 
the nose or to the eyes with a large stone or the blunt end of 
an ax communicates to the animal that you’re not easy prey. 
Continued strikes may be necessary to get your point across, but 
the animal should disengage as soon as it realizes its mistake.

 Chapter 24: Ten Quick Escapes 439
Surviving an Avalanche
Avalanches are sudden landslides of ice and snow that can 
bury you and suffocate you in the blink of an eye. The best 
policy is to avoid avalanche terrain altogether (see Chapter 
16). However, if you are caught in an avalanche, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Try to get your backpack off.
 
 Some people say this prevents the body from being 
dragged down into the snow.
 
2. Use a swimming motion to try to stay on the surface.
 
 Swim in an overhand, freestyle motion. Some survivors 
say being in an avalanche is like being caught in a 
raging river.
 
3. As you slow down, fold your arms across your face.
 
 If you’re lucky, this creates a breathing space as the 
snow settles all around you.
 
4. After you stop moving, try to dig for the surface or 
make sounds to help rescuers.
 
 If you’re not sure where up is, let some drool slide out 
of your mouth: It heads downward, so you want to dig 
in the opposite direction.
Surviving a Whiteout
A whiteout is a thick mist or blizzard that reduces visibility to 
just a few feet. If you don’t know exactly where you are, you 
may find yourself stepping off a cliff, so traveling in a whiteout 
is a bad idea unless you’re highly experienced and have a 
good map and compass skills. A whiteout, though, should 
really just be an inconvenience. Remember that you don’t 
really need food for the night and that things will probably 
look better in the morning. To wait out a whiteout, do the 
following:
 
1. Get your hat on, and if you’re going to sit down, 
insulate your body from the snow with anything you 
can, such as a backpack or vegetation pulled from a 
tree or bush.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
440
 
2. Make a snow shelter (refer to Chapter 16).
 
3. Do whatever you can to keep your body 
temperature up.
 
 Light a candle, wrap yourself in a survival blanket, 
huddle with another person — whatever you need 
to do. If it gets very cold, get active. Be sure to leave 
some signal outside the entrance so rescue crews 
don’t just ski right past you.
Getting Out of Quicksand
Quicksand forms when water wells up from an underground 
spring and “liquefies” sand or mud to the consistency of 
gelatin. If you find yourself in quicksand, don’t panic — your 
body is probably less dense than quicksand, so you shouldn’t 
sink fast. Note that on television, survival experts have to 
leap into quicksand with both feet to show how to get out 
dramatically. You’re much more likely to realize you’re in 
quicksand when one leg goes in.
If you’re walking in the country and suddenly find yourself 
with one leg deep in quicksand, simply sit back on the firm 
ground you just stepped off. Shove your walking stick down 
alongside your leg and work the shaft back and forth as you 
try to pull out your leg slowly. This breaks the vacuum formed 
by trying to pull your leg out. Don’t try to jerk your leg out 
of the pool; work your leg free slowly and get back on firm 
ground.
If you find yourself suddenly up to your hips in quicksand, 
slowly bend forward at the waist to try to lay some of your 
body on the surface. If you have a walking stick, lay it across 
the quicksand in front of you and lie on it, distributing your 
weight across a larger area. Use your arms to slowly swim or 
drag yourself forward. Continue to work your way toward firm 
ground. If you can’t see firm ground in front of you, work back 
toward the firm ground you last walked on.
