F
or most of human 
history, the idea of 
“walking on the Moon” 
was more or less the 
same as the idea of 
“walking on the Sun”. 
We always knew the 
Moon was different to 
the Sun, but it was still the less-bright light 
that comes out at nighttime. We thought it 
was a source of light itself, rather than merely 
a reﬂector. We took it for granted.
More than that actually, because to our 
ancestors, the way the Moon changes shape 
over the course of a month, and the way 
these phases affect everything from the size 
of the tides to when various plants bloom and 
animals migrate, wasn’t so much a source of 
wonder as a source of an extremely reliable 
and predictable celestial clock.
The Moon. Not much of a name is it? Most 
cultures name it either after some kind of 
minor deity (often female), while others are 
more practical or prosaic. For instance, you 
may have heard that the word “month” comes 
from “moon”, since a month is more-or-less 
the time it takes for a new Moon to fully wax 
and then wane. But actually, it’s the reverse 
- “moon” comes from words meaning month 
and, interestingly, “to measure”.
That’s because for thousands of years, the 
Moon’s main job was to let farmers know 
when to sow and when to harvest. Animal 
reproduction is also linked to a lunar cycle - 
indeed, so is our own - so having a big bright 
disc in the sky every night that gets bigger 
and smaller over time to let you know when 
to get things ready for little lambs or little 
piggies (or even little people) has, in many 
ways, been key to our success.
The irony? Our Moon is one of the darkest 
in the Solar System. It’s albedo - the amount 
of sunlight it reﬂects - is just 0.12. That 
means only 12% of the sunlight that hits it 
gets bounced back at us. Or about the same 
amount as a road covered in black asphalt.
Compare that to Saturn’s moon Enceladus. 
Its icy surface has an albedo of 0.99 - it 
returns almost all the light that hits it. Were 
Encedalus in orbit around Earth, at the same 
distance as the Moon, it would be a tiny but 
blinding and blazing coin, about a tenth the 
apparent size of the real Sun (and 0.14 the 
actual size of our current Moon).
Of course, albedo is an ideal number. The 
Moon actually does look a bit brighter than its 
albedo suggests, especially due to something 
called the “opposition effect”. When the Moon 
is full, that means the Sun is behind us as we 
view the Moon. The light comes straight back 
at us. When the Moon appears as a crescent, 
that means the Sun is off to the side (well, 
the Moon is off to the side really, because it’s 
orbiting Earth, and the Earth itself spins and 
orbits the Sun and... look, it gets complicated). 
Point is, the Moon looks plenty bright to us!
Eventually of course, humans got around 
to inventing the telescope. If you’ve never 
looked at the Moon through a properly 
powerful telescope, it’s worth trying to 
arrange it. To the naked eye, even on a very 
clear night, the Moon looks like a disc. In 
a telescope, it bulges out toward you. It’s 
really, almost confrontingly obvious that the 
Moon is a huge, three-dimensional thing.
And all along the dark edge you can see 
what are unmistakably mountains. There 
is a country up there, a place of desolate 
beauty. A landscape that, because of the lack 
of atmosphere and eroding water cycle, is - at 
human scale - grander and more epic than 
anything here on Earth. 
It’s deﬁnitely time to go back.

A ship is laying out new solar panels for the 
world’s greatest solar installation. Decades of 
intensive mining have left their marks on the Anhui 
province in Eastern China, but black energy is 
replaced by green. Ten years ago, a coal mine 
collapsed, filling with water after heavy rain. The 
artificial lake is now an ideal location for solar 
energy plants, as the water cools the panels. The 
plant will generate power for 15,000 homes as part 
of China’s switch-over to green energy, which covers 
11 % of the energy requirement today.

Sawfly larvae have developed a method that 
makes them seem bigger than they are. The 
larvae always keep close to one another, and when 
they feel threatened, they raise their abdomens, 
moving them synchronously back and forth. The 
dance makes them look like one big creature instead 
of many small ones, scaring off hungry predators. 
Around 7,500 sawfly species exist, making up a 
nuisance to garden owners, as many larvae strip 
trees of leaves. After having stuffed themselves, the 
larvae fall down to pupate in the ground.

 ARCHAEOLOGY  For more than a billion years, life 
on Earth consisted of simple, monocellular organisms. 
But about 600 million years ago, something happened: 
New, complex organisms suddenly appeared in the 
oceans, and subsequently turned into the animals we 
know today – and humans. Why the ancestors of all 
animals originated at this time, scientists do not know, 
but now Australian geochemists have a theory. 
In central Australia, scientists from ANU have 
discovered traces of algae that lived in a freezing cold 
ocean 650 million years ago. Scientists have found fossil 
remains of molecules from liquid in the algae’s cells by 
crushing and analysing rocks. The scientists believe that 
the algae spread after Earth had been frozen for 50 million 
years in what's called the Snowball Earth hypothesis.
The discovery is important, because some algae are 
a thousand times larger than bacteria and more efficient 
at converting oxygen and energy. The algae play an 
important role in the redistribution of organic matter in 
the oceans. And with the algal bloom, the conditions of 
life suddenly became favourable for larger and more 
complex organisms to evolve.

 MEDICINE  Exercise stops signs of 
ageing, which affect body cells as 
we get older, but scientists do not 
know whether you should run or 
throw spears, if you would like to 
remain young for as long as 
possible. So, scientists from the 
German Otto-von-Guericke 
University divided 26 elderly test 
subjects in two groups: one that 
learned a new dance every week and 
one that carried out stamina and 
flexibility exercises. Subsequently, 
they studied the hippocampus brain 
centre, where dementia diseases 
such as Alzheimers hit hard. In both 
groups, the hippocampus grew, but 
only the dancers had a clearly better 
balance. Two other brain areas also 
grew in the dancers.

Graphene is a one-atom thick 
carbon layer in a grid structure. 
The structure makes it 
incredibly strong, and it is also 
flexible, transparent and 
conducts heat and electricity.

German scientists reveals that dancing

The hyperloop prototype accelerates from 0 to 324 km/h in a

Hyperloop Model 
Beats Speed Record
 TECHNOLOGY  A German team has built the world's 
fastest Hyperloop test track. 24 teams from all over the 
world competed in a "simple" challenge: Make a 
Hyperloop prototype accelerate as fast as possible and 
then bring it to a controlled stop. A team from the 
technical university of Munich won with its WARR 
Hyper-loop, reaching a speed of 
324 km/h. Behind the 
competition is Elon Musk and 
SpaceX. The idea of Hyperloop is 
to create a fast train with a top 
speed of 1,200 km/h, which can 
run in a vacuum-sealed tunnel, 
propelled by magnetism.
Magnetic Levitation 
means that the train is 
kept hovering due to a 
magnetic field between 
the capsule and current 
coils in the track.

EARTH WAS 
COVERED IN ICE 
According to the snowball 
hypothesis, Earth was 
covered by ice for 50 m years 
some 700 m years ago. 
However, scientists disagree 
about how thick the ice was. 
Some believe that there was 
2-km-thick ice on the oceans 
by the Equator, and that it 
was not bacteria and algae 
in the ocean that performed 
photosynthesis. Others think 
that the ice was thin, 
allowing light to penetrate, 
so photosynthesis took 
place. Their theory is known 
as Slushball Earth.

NEWS FLASH!
For the ﬁ rst time, the 
American Red Cross has 
used a drone to inspect 
the damage caused by a 
hurricane. The fastened 
drone can reach an 
altitude of 120 m and used 
a super zoom camera to 
see many km ahead.
Drones can navigate 
precisely in the air, so 
that they can be coordinated 
in large swarms. Chinese 
engineers programmed  
1,000 drones to perform an 
advanced light show.
 The world's fastest 
drone has a top speed 
of  289 km/h. It weighs a mere 
800 g and is equipped  with 
two of the same kind of 
batteries found in many 
cordless drills.
The deployment of 
drones means that more 
companies and private 
individuals are now building 
drones with an airframe that 
is strong enough for them to 
carry a person.

The Greenlandic Ice Has Grown
  CLIMATE  Over the past year, Greenland 
has experienced ice and snow growth. DMI is 
behind the model that shows the growth
The model is fed data about snowfall, 
evaporation, and solar irradiation every six 
hours. It is expressed in water equivalents, 
which is the quantity of water that the 
snow and ice correspond to. In the past 10 
years, Greenland has lost an average of 
about 500 gigatonnes of ice a year. But the 
new data show that in the past year, so 
much snow has fallen that there has been a 
growth of 544 gigatonnes. That means 
Greenland has gained about 44 gigatonnes 
of ice over the past year. This is because 
Greenland has received more snow than 
usual and the summer has 
been short and cold.

Cobwebs Used In 
Bullet-Proof Vests
Italien researchers have been feeding spiders nanomaterials to 
create a web that is strong enough to protect against bullets.
 ZOOLOGY  In a study involving 21 
spiders, researchers from the University of 
Trento in Italiy has strengthened their 
webs using nano-materials. The cobwebs 
became up to four times as strong and ten 
times more ductile than the strongest 
spider’s thread. Also, the web is among the 
strongest materials in the world compared 
to both synthetic material like Kevlar and 
natural materials like sea snail teeth.
Three different species, two cellar 
spiders and one false widow, were either 
fed flakes of the flat carbon net 
graphene or of carbon nanotubes 
through liquid. Two to 12 days later, 
the researchers could harvest cobwebs 
of an extreme strength and elasticity. 
The nano-materials had been built into 
the protein structures that make up the 
web. The spiders that were fed carbon 
nanotubes produced the strongest silk. 
Previously, Chinese researchers have  
strengthened thread from silk worms. 
Researchers believe that the method can 
be transferred to other animals and 
plants and lead to the development of a 
completely new class of artificially 
modified materials.

Craniums Reveal

 ARCHAEOLOGY  Disagreements among 
young men in medieval London were often 
solved by resorting to fights and brutal 
violence. This is shown in a new archeological 
study from Oxford University, UK.
The archeologists examined a total of 399 
craniums from the 1050-1550 period from six 
churchyards in the British capital. Out of the 
many skulls, almost 7 % had marks from 
blows or other types of violence, and the 
study shows a clear connection between the 
gender, age and social status of the dead.
It turned out that craniums from men 
aged 26-35 from disadvantaged social 
conditions where significantly over-
represented among the damaged skulls.
THE CAPITAL WAS THE 
CENTRE OF FIST FIGHTS

historic evidence suggest that 
London was more violent during the

Micro Needles Target Fat Cells Very Precisely

Surrounded By 
Black Holes
Astronomers have calculated that 
our galaxy is probably teeming with 
black holes.
 ASTRONOMY  A team of 
astronomers from University of 
California have performed a 
complex calculation to take a 
census of the cosmos. Their 
result shows that our galaxy is 
probably full of black holes, 
contrary to what astronomers 
have so far believed. This means 
that there may be up to a 100 
million black holes in our galaxy. 
Black holes appear when red 
giant stars, which are several 
hundred times bigger than the 
Sun, collapse and explode. 
A black hole with a diameter 
of 1 cm weighs what corresponds 
to approx. half of Earth’s mass. 
The vast mass creates a gravity 
so strong that even light cannot 
escaoe from it.
The researcher's new plaster only administers drugs to small areas, thus
avoiding unnecessary side effects on the rest of the body .
 MEDICINE  American researchers have 
developed a plaster that converts white fat 
into brown. This way, they want to remove 
specific fat deposits from the body.
White fatty tissue is the body’s storage. 
It forms on the stomach, thighs and hips 
and stores excess energy. Brown fat is full of 
mitochondria and burns fat into heat when 
we feel cold. Brown fat cells burn vast 
amounts of energy, so researchers have, for 
some time, been developing drugs that 
convert white fat cells into brown. The 
problem with these drugs, however, is their 
unwanted side effects on several organs.
Now, American researchers have 
succeeded in administering drugs to specific 
fat deposits in overweight mice. Using a 
plaster studded with microscopic needles, 
nanoparticles containing medicine are taken 
underneath the skin. The researchers put a 
new plaster on the stomach of overweight 
mice every three days for four weeks. The fat 
in the mice was reduced by 20 % where the 
plaster had been positioned, and their 
fasting blood sugar level became 
significantly lower.

A plaster covered with microscopic needles can make fat 
disappear and fight against obesity and diabetes.

triceratops showed traces

crustaceans, shrimps and 
beach fleas.

COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER & SHUTTERSTOCK
N E E D L E S
The plaster is studded with rows of needles, 
each measuring 300 times 800 μm.
Nanoparticles are released from 
microscopic needles in the plaster once they 
have penetrated the skin. Over three days, 
the particles are broken down and release 
drugs, which affect fat cells under the skin.
The drugs change the composition of the 
fat cells. For example, a number of proteins 
are regulated, so that the fat cells turn into 
so-called brown fat, which burns energy 
much faster.

The World’s Largest Plane Leaves The Hangar
 TECHNOLOGY  In the Mojave Desert, 
Microsoft billionaire Paul Allen recently rolled 
the world’s biggest plane out of its hangar. 
The huge aircraft, which weighs almost 227 
tonnes, is designed to take spacecraft one 
step closer to space.
Whereas a large passenger plane has a 
wing span of 70-80 m, the “Stratolaunch” 
measures an impressive 117 m from wing tip 
to wing tip. The two plane bodies are almost 
73 m long, and the aircraft will be powered by 
six Boeing 747 engines. The Stratolaunch is 
meant to take off carrying a rocket on its 
back. When the plane has carried the rocket 
– is the weight of the recently discovered dinosaur Patagotitan 
mayorum, which is one of the biggest that ever lived (37 m).

CT scan discloses Central America’s oldest cancer // A 700-year-old 
skeleton discovered in Panama in 1970 has proved to include Central America’s oldest

Suction Discs Inspire 
Waterproof Patch
Inspired by octopus arms, South Korean scientists 
have developed a material which sticks under water.
 CHEMISTRY  In the future, 
underwater robots for cleaning 
and examining ships will be 
able to walk about on the 
side of a ship by means of 
tiny suction discs. That is 
one perspective of a new 
material developed by 
scientists from Korea's 
Sungkyunkwan University. 
The material sticks to very 
smooth, moist surfaces such as 
glass, silicone, and skin, and its 
texture is inspired by the 
Octopus vulgaris, whose suction 
discs are particularly powerful.
Scientists have discovered 
that  "balls" at the centres of 
the octopus’ numerous suction 
discs use pressure differences 
to stick under water. So, they 
have made a polymer patch 
with imitated suction discs. 1 
cm2 of patch includes 5,000 
imitated suction discs.
Underwater, pressure 
differences occur between 
suction disc cavities and the 
surroundings, resulting in the 
material’s considerable adhesive 
strength. Apart from making 
feet soles for underwater 
robots, scientists aim to 
use the material for 
very strong 
adhesive patches.

Why Is There No GPS 
In The Black Boxes?
Would it not have been easier to find Malaysia Airlines 
Flight 370, which disappeared in 2014, if the plane’s 
black boxes had been equipped with a GPS transmitter?
Although missing planes are rare, 
Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which 
disappeared in the Indian Ocean in 2014, 
has brought attention to the black boxes, 
which is another name for the plane’s, 
um, orange flight recorders.
In order for a flight recorder to be 
found in the ocean, it is typically 
equipped with an acoustic transmitter, 
which is activated by contact with water 
and emits a sound signal once a second 
for 30 days, until the battery runs dry.
The acoustic transmitter has been 
chosen, because radio signals and 
GPS are blocked under water and 
would hence not have been of any 
help in the case of Flight 370.
But now, the Airbus aircraft maker is 
developing a new type of black box, 
which, in case of a crash, is shot out of the 
plane and can float on the ocean surface. 
Planes will still have a Cockpit Voice and 
Data Recorder at the front, which also 
records pilot conversation in the cockpit.
So, plane crash investigators will get 
two copies of the data.
The classic black box 
emits an acoustic signal, 
which, unlike GPS, can be 
sent and received 
through water.

No studies have yet proved that the Moon has an 
effect on people, but there is no doubt that it 
affects animals. A number of species, primarily 
marine, run life cycles according to the phases 
and motions of the Moon. Some species of corals, 
worms, crustaceans, and fish only spawn during 
specific Moon phases at very special times of year. 
The most famous are the Christmas Island red 
crabs. In October and November, 43 million crabs 
leave the forests at the centre of the island to go 
to the ocean, where they meet in a tremendous 
mating orgy. At full moon, the females release 
their fertilised eggs at high tide, before they 
venture back to the forest.

Soluble stitches are broken down 
naturally in the body and need not 
be removed by a doctor. 
Previously, the suture was made of 
intestines from sheep, goats, or 
cows, which were dissolved by the 
body, as the wound healed. Today, 
the soluble sutures consist of 
plastics such as polyglycol acid.

What Is The Smallest

In 2012, physicist David Kielpinski and his colleagues 
managed to take a photo of the shadow of one single 
atom: the tiniest object ever photographed only using 
visible light.
The scientists isolated one single ytterbium atom in 
a vacuum chamber to avoid that other atoms 
interrupted the picture. Moreover, the atom was 
electrically charged, so the scientists could halt it by 
means of a magnetic field. Inside the chamber, they 
aimed a laser beam at the atom, which absorbed a 
fraction of light, producing a shadow behind it. Thanks 
to an extremely high-resolution microscope, a digital 
camera sensor could capture the slight light reduction.

Not even identical twins, whose genes 
are 100 % the same, have the same 
fingerprints. For the same reason, police 
and courts throughout the world accept 
fingerprints as conclusive evidence.
The general shape of fingerprints is 
determined by genes, but the finer 
details form randomly in the unborn 
baby. During the third and fourth months 
of pregnancy, fluid pressure expands the 
skin on the fingers into a type of “pads”. 
When the pressure is reduced again, the 
skin folds, and so, you will see  patterns 
which vary from finger to finger and from 
person to person. Once the fingerprint 
has been formed, it will never change.
Based on statistical models, 
scientists have concluded that the 
likelihood of a complete match is zero. 
Whether each print is really unique is 
very difficult to test scientifically, as it 
would require that all the world’s more 
than seven billion people had their 
prints taken and compared.

WORLD RECORDS
Water purification plants use sulphuric 
acid and iron chloride to remove 
impurities from dirty water. 
When did we begin 
to purify water?
How early in the history of mankind did we 
find out that water could contain impurities?
The earliest known records of attempts to 
purify water date back to Indian Sanskrit texts 
from around 2000 BC. The texts recommended 
several different methods – such as boiling 
water over a fire, heating it in the Sun, or 
filtering it through sand or coal. Around 400 
BC, the Greek doctor Hippocrates began to 
experiment with water purification. He 
realised that the water in the Greek aqueducts 
was far from clean and created a filter of cloth 
to purify the water he gave to his patients. 
The major breakthrough in efficient water 
purification came in the late 1600s, when 
Anton van Leeuwenhoek from the Netherlands 
invented the microscope. Now, for the first 
time, it was possible to see that the water that 
seemed crystal clear and pure was really 
teeming with microorganisms. Boiling and 
filtering of drinking water subsequently 
became more common.

PLANTS IN THE FIGHT 
AGAINST CHOLERA
C. 1800: The world's first 
municipal water purification 
plant opens in Scotland. 
1839: Filtering of flood 
water introduced in London. 
1849: The British doctor 
John Snow puts forward the 
theory that cholera is carried 
by sewage-contaminated 
drinking water.
1852: Researchers 
acknowledge the connection 
between water quality and 
cholera, which ravages 
Europe. Filtering of drinking 
water is made compulsory 
throughout the UK.

Who invented marzipan?
Both the Italians and Germans

According to an Italian 
legend, marzipan was invented 
by a Venetian baker’s daughter, 
who by mistake used far too 
many chopped almonds in a 
portion of cake dough. The 
father was furious, but 
discovered that the dough 
tasted divinely. He cut the 
dough into small pieces known 
as Marcus bread after the St. 
Marc guardian angel – 
“marcipani” in Latin.
According to the Germans, 
the German cook Franz Marcip 
was asked to invent a delicious 
dessert for a banquet in the 
1600s. Marcip served a delicious 
dough of chopped almonds and 
sugar, which he, in all modesty, 
named after himself. 
The aerial photo shows 
thin flakes of ice in double 
layers. The phenomenon 
is known as overshot ice 
and is almost impossible 
to observe from the shore.  
 Due to a light breeze or 
current, tension arises in 
the ice, making thin ice plates 
place themselves on top of 
each other along a crack. 
The thin ice is so porous 
that the one plate cuts 
into the other. The regular 
zigzag pattern arises, when the 
ice moves perpendicularly to 
the crack. 
Where the ice lies in two 
layers, it is twice as thick, 
making the dark fiord water 
less visible through the ice, 
which seems lighter.

From melting heat to a global ice age. If Earth were removed from its

How would the climate behave, if 
Earth’s orbit around the Sun were 
altered?
Earth’s orbit around the Sun is almost 
circular at an average distance of 
149.6 million km. This distance is 
optimal, as we are thus located in the 
habitable zone, which is neither too 
warm nor too cold, and where the 
conditions for life are perfect.

temperature would rise violently, the 
greenhouse effect would run amok, 
and the oceans would evaporate – 
roughly what has happened on Venus. 
Further away, we would freeze to 
death in a global, infinite ice age.
If Earth’s orbit were more 
elliptical, the distance to the Sun 
would vary, and the temperature 
would alternate tremendously over a 
year. Most of the year, Earth would be 
relatively far away from the Sun, so 
we would have a long, freezing cold 
winter followed by a short, hot 
summer. In a very elliptical orbit,

LONG ANSWER: The decades-old Moon 
landing conspiracy theory shenanigans 
reached absolute peak ridiculousness in 
2002, in Beverely Hills, California.
On September 9 of that year, Apollo 
astronaut and second person on the 
Moon, Buzz Aldrin, was confronted 
outside a hotel by conspiracy theorist 
Bart Sibrel. Sibrel demanded that Aldrin 
swear an oath on the Bible that he 
really had walked on the Moon.
Obviously, Aldrin ignored Sibrel and 
tried to walk away. Sibrel (then 38) 
followed Aldrin (72) while loudly insisting 
the veteran fighter pilot was “a coward, and 
a liar, and a thief”. Eventually, in full view of 
several TV cameras, Aldrin snapped and 
punched Sibrel right in the mouth. The 
police refused to file charges.
As insane as this little episode is, it does 
illustrate the depth of passion the small 
community of Moon Hoaxers have about 
their favourite conspiracy.
The theory is simple: the US did not send 
astronauts to the Moon in the period 1969 to 
1972. Rather than a space agency, NASA was 
more like a reality TV production company. 
Elaborate sound-stages were built, detailed 
props and costumes created, and incredibly 
complex “missions” were choreographed, for

the benefit of America’s increasingly 
powerful news industry.
Why? Simple propaganda. By “putting 
a man on the Moon”, the US could show 
those dirty communists in the USSR who 
was boss. It was payback for the 
humiliation of Sputnik and Yuri Gagarin’s 
space walk, and all the other times the 
USSR had beaten the US to yet another 
important milestone in space.
Moon Hoaxers claim that at some point 
after US President John F Kennedy made 
his famous “we choose to go to the Moon” 
speech in 1962, NASA realised the cost and 
technological challenge was far too great. 
It would be easier (according to 
the conspiracy) to just 
pay Hollywood to fake 
the whole thing.
This has always 
been an important part 
of the Moon Hoax: that 
elite Hollywood 
producers and directors 
- especially Stanely 
Kubrick who directed 
2001: A Space Odyssey 
in 1968 - would create the faked up 
missions, and ensure they looked as 
realistic as possible.
From that fairly basic idea, things get 
really really complicated. Moon Hoaxers 
have spent thousands of hours scrutinising 
every piece of video, film, photographic 
print, and negative from Apollo, for what 
they call “inconsistencies.”
Shadows that are wrong. Weird 
reflections. Visual evidence that the 
“soundstage” Armstrong and Aldrin 
are prancing about on isn’t 384,400 
kilometres away, but just in a backlot at 
Universal Studios. And so forth.
Even Australia gets tied up in the 
whole thing, thanks to our role in 
relaying Armstrong’s live video feed 
from the Sea of Tranquility on the 
Moon, down to Honeysuckle Creek in 
the ACT, and then out around the 
world. Moon Hoaxers claim we just 
pointed the TV cameras at a screen 
showing a film that NASA/Hollywood 
had made earlier. Someone even 
claimed they saw a coke bottle resting 
behind a moon rock.
A coke bottle? That’s right - Moon 
Hoaxers point to errors and 
inconsistencies in various images released 
by NASA. Which raises an obvious 
Each of the six LEM descent stages remaining on 
the Moon has a plaque similar to Apollo 11's.
Stanley Kubrick has been accused of 
filming fake Apollo landings for NASA. 
Mostly because he was the director of

sets for that film could be reused, see. 
Because even massive international 
conspiracies have to stick to a budget.
question: After spending hundreds of 
millions of dollars faking this Moon landing, 
why would NASA allow an error as simple as 
a discarded coke bottle or a mislaid camera 
lens cap, or a rock with a prop-code scrawled 
on it, into the official images?
The Moon Hoaxer is quick to respond: 
because those “errors” are deliberate, 
placed there by brave whistle-blowers who 
are trying to expose the whole thing.
As a scientific magazine that believes in 
observational evidence, Australian Science 
Illustrated does not dispute the reality that, 
between 1969 and 1972, NASA landed six 
LEMs (and 12 humans) on the Moon. But 
even ignoring an almost endless supply of 
proof that Apollo was 
real, the Moon Hoax 
still has a couple of 
problems that we find 
really hard to get over...
The biggest one of 
course is that, even 
now, 45 years after the 
last landing, no one 
has come forward to 
bust the conspiracy 
wide open. On top of this, during the 
Apollo program, even though the USSR 
was scrutinising every piece of US radio 
communications (and had agents at all 
levels of government), at no point did the 
Soviets challenge America publically. Even 
after the Cuban Missile Crisis and various  
other small diplomatic humiliations, the 
USSR did not think to tell the world: “This 
Apollo thing the US is so proud of? It’s 
fake.” For some reason.
And yet the conspiracy theory persists. 
Old men are getting hassled outside 
Beverly Hills hotels 33 years after their 
mission. There are hundreds of websites 
full of exhaustive (and exhausting) details.
Why do a small but intense number of 
people want to believe the Apollo landings 
were faked? Maybe its because they look 
around at the world today and see all the 
petty politics, and the obsession with the 
superficial and the meaningless, and 
think: this is not a society that could 
possibly have done something as grand 
and as noble as fly to the Moon.
Maybe in this day and age it is hard to 
believe that the US (of all countries) would 
dedicate the 1960s-equivalent of $110 
billion to just going to the Moon.
Most unbelievable of all, to the mind of 
today’s embittered cynic brought up on a 
media diet of war and terrorism, must be 
the plaque that still remains on the ladder 
of the descent stage of Apollo 11’s Eagle 
lander. Because it reads:
“Here men from the planet Earth first 
set foot upon the Moon, July 1969 AD. We 
came in peace for all mankind.” 
By “putting a man 
on the Moon”, the US 
could show the USSR 
who was boss.

swarm of satellites are orbiting the 
poles. Landers touch down softly in 
the moon dust. And rovers and hoppers are 
moving across the surface in craters and on 
mountains and plains. 
This fleet will be launched by  space 
agencies and private aerospace companies 
to carry out scientific studies that focus on 
the Moon's geology and history. 
Today, all our information about the 
Moon comes from satellite observations 
and from a mere 570 kg of moon rock and 
dust, which have fallen down on Earth as 
lunar meteorites or have been brought 
back by the Apollo missions.
So, future missions will collect and 
analyse lots of samples from craters, 
mountains, and plains and drill cores of 
lunar material many metres long. The aim 
is to find out which key resources the Moon 
can provide the infrastructure to follow.

hydrogen and find raw materials to use for building bases.

eople all over the world are glued to 
their TV screens to watch the first 
blurred, black and white images 
from the Moon. The hatch of the 
Apollo 11 mission’s lunar lander 
opens, and Neil Armstrong steps down onto the 
Moon’s surface. A few minutes later, Buzz 
Aldrin follows, and together, the astronauts 
plant the American flag in the moon dust.
On 20 July 1969, Neil Armstrong was the 
first human to set foot on the Moon, and over 
the next three years, another 11 astronauts 
followed. Today, the American flag is still there, 
but no humans have revisited. Space agencies 
have taken only occasional interest in launching 
unmanned craft about 400,000 km into space, 
and so, Earth’s natural satellite has been buried 
in oblivion for decades. Until now, that is.
At the moment, seven unmanned spacecraft 
and one manned mission are getting ready to go 
to the Moon in 2018. Moreover, another 10 will 
follow before the end of 2020. Aerospace 
organisations have become aware of the Moon's 
great potential. It boasts valuable, rare raw 
materials, which space robots can harvest, but 
even more importantly, the Moon can be used 
as a “launch pad” for operations further into 
space. Rockets can be launched more 
inexpensively from a future base on the Moon, 
where gravity is only one sixth of Earth’s, so less 
fuel is required for take-off.
PRIVATE CRAFT INITIATE LUNAR ERA
The fast-growing private aerospace industry 
will probably make the first visits in the new 
lunar era. Five companies from the US, Japan, 
Israel, and India are competing to go to the 
Moon first in the Google Lunar XPRIZE 
competition. The Internet giant has offered a 
prize of US$190 million to the private group, 
which is the first to land a craft on the Moon, 
cover a distance of 500 m, and transmit video to 
Earth. The aim is to test different spacecraft 
concepts – such as hoppers, which jump across 
the surface, and rovers, which are small cars on 
wheels – and boost technological developments. 
Initially, the competition ended in late 2012, 
five years after its introduction, but in mid-
2012, it was clear that none of the participants 
would be able to build and launch their craft 
before the deadline, which was first postponed 
to late 2015 – and subsequently to late 2017. In 
the autumn of 2017, the five remaining 
competitors were almost ready for launch, but 
only one team had found a lift to the Moon. 
Hence, the deadline has now been postponed to 
31 March. If no team is ready by then, there will 
be no prize.
Private aerospace companies are not the 
only ones aiming to conquer the Moon within 
the next year. The space agencies of the world 
are also on their way.
China has traditionally not been a major 
space-faring nation, but today, the country’s 
space agency, China National Space 
Administration, has the world’s most ambitious 
Moon programme with the Chang’e spacecraft, 
which are named after the Chinese moon 
goddess. CNSA’s first lunar landing took place in 
2013 with the Chang’e 3 rover, and the 
organization plans another landing in 2018 
with the Chang’e 4 craft. The mission 
will be the first ever to land a lander 
and a rover on the far side of

the Moon. The landing site is the huge 
Aitken crater, which is located close to the 
south pole and is probably the Moon’s oldest. 
The mission aim is to determine the accurate 
age of the crater, determine the make-up of the 
moon dust, and test the possibilities of moving 
astronomical space observations from Earth to 
the far side of the Moon. In theory, the far side 
is ideal for radio astronomy, as observations are 
not interrupted by radio noise from Earth.
In 2019, the Chang’e 4’s exploration will be 
followed by the Chang’e 5 craft, which is to 
land on a mountain close to the north pole, 
where the lander will collect moon dust 
specimens and extract a 2-m-deep drill core 
from the rock. The craft is to send at least 2 kg 
of rock and dust back to Earth. 
NASA RETURNS TO THE MOON 
The major aerospace player of all, the US space 
agency NASA, has also taken a new interest in 
the Moon. Back in 2004, President George Bush 
made an attempt to repeat the success of the 
moon programme with a new series of lunar 
missions. The Apollo astronauts brought back 
381 kg of moon rock and dust to NASA’s labs, 
but Bush wanted more. The new missions were 
to pave the way for mining operations. NASA 
began to develop a modernised version of the 
Apollo missions, but in 2010, the plans were 
scrapped by the new president, Barack Obama, 
who believed that NASA should only focus on 
bringing people to Mars in the 2030s. 
Although the Moon programme 2.0 has 
been killed off, the space agency will not keep 
away, because the Moon can be used as an 
outpost on the way to Mars. In 2018, NASA will 
head for the Moon with its new Space Launch 
System (SLS) rocket, which is the world’s biggest 
and will carry the new Orion space capsule. 
The maiden voyage will be unmanned, but 
will bring five small cube satellites. From an 
orbit around the Moon, the satellites’ 
instruments will be searching for ice and 
hydrogen in the surface, and they will bring 
yeast to test how this organism reacts to space 
radiation.
Two years later, the Resource Prospector 
mission will be launched, whose lander is to 
drill small cores out of the Moon’s surface, 
whereas a rover will extract several 1-m-long 
drill cores. 
WATER IS VITAL
The aim of all the missions to the Moon is to 
find out whether water is present and to 
determine its constituents of oxygen and 
hydrogen in free states. 
The most important resource is water, 
which can be drunk, and with the use of 
electricity, it can also be split into hydrogen and 
oxygen. The oxygen can be used at the base 
and in space capsules, allowing astronauts to 
breathe, but in their liquid states, oxygen and 
hydrogen can be used as rocket fuel. Rocket 
launches from the Moon will require less fuel, 
but it is expensive to carry fuel to the Moon, so 
Gold rush on the Moon
Space agencies and mining companies send robots to the Moon 
to find gold and other valuable materials.
H
opefully by 2020, the first mining 
robots will be digging in the Moon's 
surface. First, they will be looking for 
water, the most important resource for 
astronauts staying on the Moon for long 
periods. As well as drinking and farming, 
water can be converted into rocket fuel. 
The deep craters near the poles  could 
hold 1.6 billion t of water.  
Secondly, the robots will also try to 
extract rare and precious metals, which 
could yield major profits. Rare earth 
metals such as scandium and tungsten 
and basic metals such as iron and 
aluminium can be used in industry on the 
Moon, so materials for construction won't 
need to be shipped up from Earth, saving 
billions in launch costs.

WATER
Access to 
water is a 
prerequisite 
for long stays on the 
Moon, such as at a 
base. It can be 
drunk and used to 
make food.

contains
major depos-
its of aluminium, 
iron, magnesium, 
and titanium. The 
metals can be used 
to build industry on 
the Moon.
FUEL
Water on the 
moon can 
also be used 
to make rocket fuel. 
Power from solar 
cells can split the 
water into oxygen 
and hydrogen, that 
are placed in tanks.

from the 
Moon have revealed 
rare earth metals 
such as yttrium. 
They can  be mined 
and used for 
industrial purposes.

SPACE TOURISM
In late 2018, US company SpaceX aims 
to send two people around the Moon 
and back to Earth. The trip will last one 
week and will take place aboard the 
Dragon space capsule, which will 
carry out the entire mission on 
autopilot. Each ticket will cost 
$16 million and requires 
perfect health. The body 
must resist huge G-forces 
during take-off and 
landing and be able to

it would be a great advantage, if fuel could be 
produced on site. 
However, the conditions for liquid water on 
the Moon are not immediately ideal. 
Temperatures vary from 123 degrees on the day 
side to minus 153 degrees on the night side, so 
water will either freeze on the surface or 
evaporate into space, because the Moon does not 
have an atmosphere to trap the vapour.
Ever since the 1960s, 
scientists have believed that 
water can be found in deep 
craters by the poles, where 
sunlight will never reach 
it – either as ice or bound 
in moon dust minerals. In 
2010, the proof was 
produced by the Indian 
Chandrayaan-1 satellite, 
which orbited the Moon’s 
poles at an altitude of 100 km. 
The satellite dropped a probe 
into into the major 
Shackleton crater by 
the south pole, and 
when the probe 
hit the bottom, 
Mining robot digs in moon dust
The first privately owned lunar rock will land on

to launch the Dragon. The space tourists will wear 
special spacesuits.

impact craters from metal asteroids also exist 
on Earth, but here, the metals have been spread 
due to geological activity. The Moon does not 
have any plate tectonics, and volcanic activity 
ceased about one billion years ago, so the 
materials remain on the surface.
The Moon Express participates in the 
Google Lunar XPRIZE race with the Lunar 
Scout lander, which is to test its technology in 
a soft landing on the Moon. Next year, the 
company will land near the south pole to 
search for water and minerals in the Lunar 
Outpost mission, and in 2020, the Harvest 
Moon will follow to send samples to Earth.
ASTRONAUTS BUILD MOON VILLAGE
The private American company SpaceX has 
also joined the new space race to the Moon. The 
company has developed the Falcon rockets, 
which can be reused, making launches to the 
Moon, etc., cheaper. SpaceX will use a rocket 
together with the Dragon space capsule to make 
two space tourists orbit the Moon later in 2018. 
If the mission is successful, the world could 
become an attractive new tourist destination – 
but so far, only for very wealthy tourists. 
Based on all the planned Moon missions, 
the European Space Agency, ESA’s, Director 
General Jan Woerner has introduced a vision 
of building an international lunar village, 
where astronauts will extract water, produce 
fuel, carry out mining and industrial activities, 
and observe Earth and space. Moreover, the 
lunar village is to be open to all public and 
private players – such as astronomers, 
the satellite could identify water molecules in 
the cloud of dust and gas caused by the impact. 
Shortly after, the American LCROSS satellite 
repeated the trick in the Cabeus crater near the 
south pole, making the same discovery.
Today, scientists believe that 1.6 billion t of 
water exist in the deep craters surrounding the 
Moon’s poles – plenty to keep astronauts alive 
and make large quantities of rocket fuel. Now, 
the Moon missions only need to find out 
exactly where the largest and most easily 
accessible deposits are.
ROBOTS SCRATCH THE SURFACE 
Several of the future Moon missions will 
extract other valuable raw materials by means 
of mining robots. According to analyses, there 
are plenty to choose from. The Moon's surface 
contains rare earth metals such as scandium, 
which is used in mobile phones, etc., and the 
highlands include large quantities of 
aluminium. Moreover, the major volcanic 
plains contain iron, magnesium, and titanium, 
which can all be used for industrial activities 
on the Moon such as satellite building. 
The American company Moon Express has 
developed mining technology, which is to 
extract resources in the large metal asteroid 
impact craters. Metal asteroids are the central 
elements of large asteroids, which have been 
shattered in space collisions, so only the metal 
cores remain. Apart from lots of iron, such cores 
also include gold, platinum, silver, palladium, 
tungsten, and cobalt. The impact crushed the 
core, so the metals are easily accessible. Ancient 
physicists, doctors, mining companies, and 
space travel agencies – aiming to explore the 
Moon’s opportunities.
The idea of a permanent lunar base is 
supported by the governments of the ESA 
member nations plus India’s, Russia’s, and Japan’s 
space organizations, several private aerospace 
companies, and the nation with the world’s 
most dedicated moon programme: China.
However, NASA is not one of the interested 
parties, as the US space organisation has other 
plans. The agency aims to launch a space 
station into orbit around the Moon, when the 
existing space station, ISS, is pensioned off in 
2024, according to plan. The space station must 
carry out an oblong orbit, by which one end is 
only 1,500 km from the Moon, whereas the 
other reaches 70,000 km into space – further 
away from Earth than any human being has 
ever been. NASA plans to launch the new 
space station’s first module – a machine module 
with steering rockets and power supply – in 
2023, assembling the station in space over the 
following years.
So, the space station will be completed, 
when the new lunar era’s first manned landing 
takes place. China, Russia, and Japan have all 
planned manned Moon missions in the first 
half of the 2030s, and after that, the 
construction of a lunar base can begin.
By then, six decades will have passed since 
the last American astronauts left after a short 
visit. The new missions will be different from 
the Apollo missions in one important way: 
now, they have come to stay.

I 
n 2024 , the International Space Sta-
tion, ISS, will be pensioned off follow-
ing a glorious career, but the American 
space agency has already planned the sta-
tion's successor. NASA aims to build a 
new space station: Deep Space Gateway, 
which is to orbit the Moon. According to 
plan, the space station will be completed 
in the late 2020s. During the first years, 
astronauts in the new space station will 
control robot missions on the Moon and 
send lunar material samples to Earth. 
After 2030, astronauts will also be 
working on the Moon. ESA Director Gen-
eral Jan  Woerner intends to build a space 
base on the Moon, where astronauts will 
extract water, carry out mining activities, 
export raw materials to Earth, make sat-
ellites of lunar materials, and produce 
rocket fuel. From the base, missions are 
also sent deeper into space. The Moon's 
weak gravity makes launches much 
cheaper than on Earth, as craft require 
much less fuel to take off. 
In the 2030s, NASA expects to have 
developed a space bus that can carry 
astronauts and equipment between the 
space station and the lunar base. After a 
mission, the craft is fuelled with fuel 
made on the Moon.

hen Major Andrei 
Durnovtsev drops the 
bomb 10 km above the 
Severny island in the 
Barents Sea from a 
purpose-built plane, he and the crew know that, 
as per the engineers’ calculations, they have a 
50% chance of surviving the test explosion.
Soon after, the mushroom cloud rises 62 km 
into the atmosphere, the light flash can be seen 
almost 1,000 km away, and the pressure wave 
travels around the world several times. It is 30 
October 1961. The Soviet Union has detonated 
Tsar Bomba – a nuclear warhead whose size has 
never been surpassed. 
The crew are lucky and survive, only just. 
Although the plane is more than 40 km away 
when the bomb detonates, the pressure wave 
causes it to drop almost 1000 metres – at a safe 
distance from the fireball, which develops after 
the explosion seconds later. 
In 2011, 50 years after Tsar Bomba, 
Vietnamese Do Quoc Hung is diagnosed with 
incurable lung cancer. Five years later, he is still 
alive, and he has the nuclear bomb to thank for 
that. Radiation treatment using the exact same 
substances that gave Tsar Bomba its destructive 
power kills the cancer cells in his lungs and 
gives him his life back.
Tsar Bomba had a yield of of 50 megatons, 
more than 3,000 times bigger than the atomic 
bomb that killed 135,000 people in the 
Japanese town of Hiroshima in 1945. Five 
million billion billion watts was released when 
Tsar Bomba detonated. A bigger bomb has 
never been built, as it is not required to achieve 
total destruction.
Nuclear weapons are the ultimate killer, 
but have, paradoxically, also led to new sub-
branches of science and technology. The same 
mechanisms that make it possible to build an 
atomic bomb are today used in green energy 
production and climate research. But the 
biggest life-giving advantage of these lethal 
weapons is the fact that they have created a 
whole new area of medicine – nuclear 
medicine. Without the nuclear  arms race, 
which began during WW2, research into 
radioactive substances would never have been 
where it is today, and soon after the war, the 
same rare substances that were created for the 
atomic bombs were put to use for the exact 
opposite purpose.
RADIOACTIVE IODINE CURED PATIENT
One day in 1943, patient “BB” suddenly 
experiences intense pain in his head. Twenty 
years before, his cancerous thyroid gland had 
been removed, and Doctor Sam Seidlin at the 
Montefiore Hospital in New York is now testing 
a new medical procedure: He administers a 
small dose of radioactive iodine to BB. Iodine is 
mainly absorbed by the thyroid gland, and 
using a Geiger counter, it is clear to Seidlin that 
the cancer has spread, as the outgrowth, the 
metastases, absorbs the iodine. Due to his 
condition, the patient has an over-production of 
a specific hormone, but the radioactive iodine 
slows it down. Sam Seidlin has an idea: Is it 
possible to fight the cancer precisely by 
administering a larger dose of radioactive 
iodine? The treatment is a success – BB’s pain 
disappears, and the cancer stops spreading.
Sam Seidlin’s breakthrough was described 
in a famous article from 1946, which was 
instrumental in establishing a completely new 
medical speciality, which is inseparable from 
the development of the nuclear bomb. Nuclear 
bombs function by means of very volatile 
radioactive substances. Some are found in 
small amounts in nature, while others have to 
be produced in nuclear reactors and particle 
accelerators. In 1942, the X-10 reactor was

he original nuclear bomb got all its power from

weapons rated for service are hydrogen bombs. The 
world’s most powerful weapon imitates processes at the 
core of the Sun, where a pressure 250 billion times 
greater than Earth and a temperature of 15 million °C 
fuse hydrogen atoms to helium. The hydrogen bomb 
uses fission to spark the fusion of hydrogen, which 
releases an extreme amount of energy.
Nuclear fission

Polonium-210 
emits alpha radiation,  
causing neutrons to break off 
from the beryllium atoms. 
When they hit the 
plutonium-239 atoms, fission 
occurs, emitting energy and, 
causing a chain reaction 
where all atoms are 
split in a microsecond.

The force of the 
atomic bomb is 
released by a ball of plastic 
explosive. Inside the ball is 
the fuel of the bomb, 
plutonium- 239, and an 
initiator made of beryllium 
and polonium- 210. 
Thepolo nium-210 is 
pressed into the beryllium.
ATOMIC BOMB GETS ITS ENERGY FROM FISSION
PARTICLE RESEARCH IS A 
CHILD OF THE ATOMIC BOMB
In 2012, the European particle re-
search centre CERN discovered the Higgs 
field, which gives all matter mass. The 
discovery may not have been made 
without the atomic bomb and the nu-
clear arms race, which increased our 
knowledge about particle physics and 
resulted in the foundation of CERN.

Bomb Lab Creates
Weapons Against Cancer
T 
he mountains in New Mexico 
are home to the Los Alamos 
lab, where the first atomic bomb 
was built during WW2. The 
laboratory still works on nuclear 
weapons, but the particle 
accelerators, which are 
used to 
produce radioactive substances 
for bombs, also create life-saving 
substances for the treatment of 
cancer. One of most advanced 
substances is actinium-225. The 
substance is combined with the 
body’s own immune cells and 
therefore drawn to the cancer-
affected cells when injected into 
the body. Actinium -225 uses 
almost all of its energy when 
colliding with the cancer cells, 
thereby sparing the healthy 
cells in the body.
Fusion

The extreme 
pressure causes the 
deuterium and tritium to 
fuse to a new element, 
helium, which happens 
constantly at the core of 
the Sun. Fusion releases 
vast amounts of excess 
energy – over four times 
as much as in fission.

The bomb's fusion 
stage uses two types 
of heavy hydrogen: 
deuterium and tritium, 
inside a uranium shell. The 
process is secret, but the 
heat probably makes the 
uranium shell explode, 
which presses the 
hydrogen together.

The nuclear fission 
process emits 
gamma radiation. The 
radiation is contained, 
superheating its centre up 
to some 100 million 
degrees. The extreme

ust under two million lives 
have been spared, as nuclear 
power has replaced polluting 
coal-fired power stations. The 
calculation has been made by 
two NASA researchers, who 
conclude that only 4,900 
humans died as a direct 
consequence of nuclear power in 
the 1971-2009 period. The figure 
debated due to disagreement 
over the number of direct deaths 
from  the Chernobyl accident, 
but even with the highest 
estimates, nuclear energy is less 
dangerous than coal.
Hydrogen Bomb Built 
to Destroy a City
T
he power of a hydrogen 
bomb is so great that one 
bomb alone could destroy a 
city in seconds.
Atomic bombs are usually 
detonated above ground to avoid 
losing energy into the ground, if 
they did not detonate until 
colliding with the ground surface. 
The extreme heat emitted by the 
bomb ignites the air, and the ball 
of fire rises into the air, using the 
same principle as a hot-air 
balloon, and creates the well-
known mushroom cloud. The ball 
of fire is then overtaken by the 
pressure wave, which is emitted 
immediately after, and dust and 
waste rise from the air, forming 
the stem of the mushroom.
Almost half of the bomb’s 
energy is released in the pressure 
wave; between a third and a half 
is heat, while the rest is radiation.
COAL IS 14 TIMES AS DANGEROUS AS NUCLEAR POWER
Of four energy forms, nuclear power is the safest, measured by the 
number of deaths it costs to produce a given amount of electricity.

built at the secret Oak Ridge laboratory in 
Tennessee, USA. X-10 was the first reactor 
made for producing plutonium-239, the “fuel” 
in an ordinary atomic bomb. Here, physicists 
created the volatile substance for the atomic 
bomb by radiating uranium-238 with 
neutrons. While working on various types of 
uranium, the researchers at Oak Ridge 
discovered that iodine-131  could be made by 
fission of uranium-235 – a process that took 
place in the reactor.
In 1946, shortly after the end of the war, 
the American authorities decided that the 
reactor was to focus on medicine rather than 
bombs. As a result, the radioactive iodine that 
Sam Seidlin proved capable of curing cancer 
later that year, could now be produced in large 
quantities. Nuclear medicine had been born.
After WW2, radioactive substances were 
mainly used to diagnose illnesses. The 
substances are useful, as they can be targeted to 
a specific part of the body that the doctors wish 
to examine. Basically, radioactive substances are 
combined with trace elements – substances that 
are known  to be absorbed by specific organs or 
which attach to cells affected by illness. The 
mixture is injected into the body, and when 
certain cells work overtime due to illness, more 
of the substance will attach to them. Using a so-
called gamma camera, the doctors can record 
the radiation and get a detailed picture of an 
illness in a certain part of the body.
Today, the substance most widely used for 
diagnosing is technetium-99m, which is 
particularly suitable because it emits gamma 
rays that are easy to measure, as they have 
almost the same wavelength as ordinary 
x-rays. Also, almost all of the substance in the 
stable substance technetium-99 decays within 
a day, so the body is only exposed to a 
minimum amount of radiation.
COBALT-60 CUTS LIKE A KNIFE
The atomic reactors made it possible to 
produce a large number of radioactive 
substances for medical use. One of them is 
cobalt-60, which is not found in nature, but can 
only be produced in a reactor by bombarding 
cobalt-59 with neutrons. Cobalt-60 paved the 
way for a revolutionary technique called a 
gamma knife. This treatment saved the life of 
Vietnamese Do Quoc Hung in 2011, although 
Las Vegas celebrated tests
The nuclear tests were  exciting, 
and in Las Vegas, only 100 km from 
the test area in the Nevada desert,  
casinos got maximum publicity out of 
the events. The city's choir girls 
performed in costumes inspired by 
the bomb. In 1957, one of them was 
crowned “Miss Atomic Bomb” and 
photographed wearing a cotton wool 
mushroom cloud.
The 1950s saw great 
enthusiasm about the atomic 
bomb and nuclear power, and 
most people were unaware 
about the dangers. Many 
envisaged a golden atomic age 
with nuclear cars and more.
Cars would get reactors
In the late 1950s, many carmakers 
began to design nuclear cars inspired 
by the nuclear ships and subs, which 
were already sailing the seas. Cars 
driven by small nuclear reactors would 
be inexpensive to run and pollution-
free, it was said, but due to the 
apparent risk of dangerous accidents, 
they were never put on the roads.
Bombs to dig canals
The American government planned 
to replace diggers with atomic bombs 
in major excavation projects. One of 
the ideas from the early 1960s was to 
extend the Panama Canal using 
atomic explosions and rename it to 
the Pan-Atomic Canal. Another project 
was to construct a new port in Alaska 
using bombs.
Radiation: 3 km 
50-90 % of those 
closest to the 
detonation site will die 
from radiation. This can 
take anything from a 
few hours to weeks.
Fireball: 4.5 km 
Everything combustible 
within the area covered 
by the bomb's ball of 
fire will catch fire and 
the heat radiation will 
reach even further.
Blast wave: 9 km 
All buildings will be 
destroyed, and most 
small houses within a 
20.5-km radius will 
collapse. Death rate 
close to 100 %.
Burns: 60 km
Many will suffer from 
third-degree burns, 
which can give 
debilitating scars and in 
the worst cases require 
amputation.
NUCLEAR TESTING LED TO 
KNOWLEDGE OF THE BODY
The numerous nuclear tests during the 
1955-1963 period doubled the amount of 
radioactive carbon-14 in the atmosphere. 
The substance is easily absorbed in the 
body, and as its decay time is known, this 
has shown how fast the various cell types 
in the body regenerate.

he had lung cancer, which would previously 
have been hopeless.
The gamma knife technique radiates 
radioactive substances into the body, ensuring 
that they mainly react with the cancer, just as 
if the surgeon had been using an extremely 
precise knife. The active substance in the 
gamma knife emits gamma radiation, a kind of 
extremely short-waved light strong enough to 
make electrons come loose from atoms in the 
cancer-affected cells. This creates radicals – 
atoms, whose one pair of electrons have been 
broken open. The radicals react strongly with 
the surrounding atoms, subsequently killing 
the cancer cells.
The treatment was first tested in 1968 and 
marked the beginning of so-called 
radiosurgery. Over the years, the procedure 
has been refined, and today, doctors often use 
a so-called rotating gamma knife, where the 
radiation source revolves around the patient, 
radiating from different directions. This makes 
the method more precise, reduces radiation of 
healthy tissue and makes it possible to cure 
patients like Do Quoc Hung.
 In the 1970s and 1980s, the radioactive 
substances led to another breakthrough. Using 
modern scanning methods – CT, MR and PET 
scans – which function by means of 
radioactive trace elements, it has, for example, 
become possible to map cancer-affected areas 
in the body in much greater detail. This has 
made radiosurgery even more useful because 
doctors are now able to target with much 
higher precision.
ACCELERATOR TREATS CANCER
This technological development has made 
particle accelerators more widespread, and 
doctors can now produce radiation with a 
higher energy content than in radiosurgery 
used so far, thus killing cancer cells even 
more efficiently.
The most recent innovation in 
radiosurgery is the microbeam radiation 
therapy, which is expected to become very 
important in cancer treatment, as it is 
extremely precise. The technique uses a 
synchrotron, a circular particle accelerator. A 
magnetic field accelerates the particles at an 
increasing speed, and the radiation is increased 
accordingly. The acceleration makes the 
particles emit X-ray radiation, and the 
radiation is focused so that the ray, which is 
sent into the body, measures as little as 10 
micrometres (1/1,000,000 m) in diameter – 
approx.  1/10 of a human hair. With this 
treatment, several small and precise pulses of 
radiation are targeted at the cancer-affected 
cells, minimising damage to healthy cells. The 
microbeam treatment is expected to be used on 
tumours in the central nervous system, which 
have so far been difficult to treat.
The atomic bomb was developed as a 
weapon against military enemies and enabled 
man to destroy the entire Planet. But with the 
doomsday weapon came a technology, which 
is saving lives by fighting enemies inside our 
bodies using extreme precision. 
CLIMATOLOGISTS USE 
NUCLEAR BOMB MODELS
The researchers, who built atomic 
bombs during the cold war, developed 
new calculus to analyse the blast waves 
and calculate the spread of the 
radioactive substances. Today, 
climatologists use the same models to 
study the carbon cycle between the 
atmosphere, the seas and life on Earth.

Our life on Earth is threatened by both 
global warming and collisions from 
space. The power of the atomic bomb 
may help avoid a disaster or create 
a new home for us if we have to 
leave Earth.
NUCLEAR ENGINE QUICKLY 
TAKES US TO MARS
A rocket driven by nuclear 
power can shave up to 18  
months off the journey to Mars. 
Both the Russians and Americans 
are developing a rocket engine, 
which uses the energy from 
nuclear fission to ignite the fuel, 
typically hydrogen. According to 
NASA, the so-called thermal fission 
engine is twice as efficient as a 
traditional chemical rocket engine.
HYDROGEN BOMBS MELT 
THE POLES ON MARS
At present, Mars is 
uninhabitable, but the 
barren planet may be turned into 
a new Earth by means of atomic 
bombs. American inventor Elon 
Musk suggests that hydrogen 
bombs be detonated around the 
planet, thus melting the ice at the 
poles like little suns. This will 
create plenty of liquid water, and 
the newly created seas will release 
CO2 that can rise into the 
atmosphere and create a 
greenhouse effect. This way, the 
ice-cold planet will be warmed up 
to an inhabitable temperature.
NUCLEAR BOMBS SAVES 
EARTH FROM ASTEROIDS
An asteroid can wipe out a 
city in a flash if it collides with 
Earth, but the disaster may be 
averted by launching a rocket with a 
nuclear warhead and blow the 
space rock to pieces. A 1-megaton 
bomb – a little more than 60 times 
the Hiroshima bomb – is enough to 
destroy an asteroid measuring some 
500 m, computer simulations show.
If the ice on Mars melts, the planet 
may be inhabitable.

he first thing I would do was to zoom in on 
the atmosphere and see if it is similar to that 
of Earth, Venus – or something else,” says 
Simona Ciceri from Italy. She has taken a seat 
in the control room of the La Silla 
Observatory in front of a line of monitors, with the 
astronomer’s indispensable companions within reach: 
Coffee and cola. In her hand she has a list with a few 
coordinates scribbled on it. Her “pilot”, the telescope operator, 
will lock on to these during the shift. It is 2100h, and ahead 
of her is a whole night's hunt for exoplanets: Alien worlds 
orbiting a distant sun. 
Ciceri is one of many hundreds of international 
astronomers who go to Chile every year. This is the 
homeland to a number of telescopes owned and operated by 
ESO, the European South Observatory. Today, half of all the 
world’s astronomical data come from new and advanced 
instruments in Chile, and this percentage will increase 
dramatically once ESO’s new giant telescope, known as ELT, 
is ready in a few years. When that happens, the astronomers 
will not only find the answers to some of their burning 
questions about black holes, dark energy and the creation of 
stars, but will also be able to observe alien space objects 
directly. And if Simona Ciceri were in charge, the first things 
she would do were to point ELT’s sensitive instruments at 
the atmosphere of some of the stoney objects outside our 
solar system. If their atmosphere is similar to that of Earth, 
the alien world may even be home to life.
 
EUROPEAN ASTRONOMERS
WENT SOUTH
Chile’s star status among astronomers began with the 
construction of the La Silla Observatory. In the early 1960s, 
all the large reflecting telescopes in the world were placed in 
the northern hemisphere, which only provided a view of the 
northern sky. To study the centre of the Milky Way or the 
Magellanic Clouds, the European astronomers had to go to 
the southern hemisphere. The air in the Chilean Atacama 
Desert is crisp, clean and clear, and here, on average it rains 
just six days every year – making this bone-dry high altitude 
desert the perfect observation post for the southern sky. 
Therefore, six European nations joined forces and 
constructed a large observatory at an elevation of 2,400 m, 
which was given the name La Silla, saddle in Spanish, named 
after the saddle-shaped mountain top of which it was built.
UNIVERSE IS FULL OF
MYSTERIOUS SPACE OBJECTS
When the La Silla Observatory was inaugurated in March 
1969, the astronomers had yet to discover an exoplanet. It 
was not until 1995 that the first certain observation was 
made – a gas planet that looped around its star in a hectic 
four-Earth-day orbit. 
Since then, the family of exoplanets has grown almost 
exponentially, and as we write this the count is 3,671 and 
climbing. These new planets seem to have an almost 
unending variety. One has been named Super Saturn, as it is 
surrounded by 37 rings and has a radius of 90 million km – 
200 times that of Saturn. Another, called Kepler-16b, 
experiences two sunrises a day, as it orbits two stars. A third 
planet, GJ 1214 b, has been named Waterworld, as it consists 
mainly of water in various exotic forms: As plasma, as hot ice 
or in a superliquid state. Imagination appears to be the only 
limit to the worlds out there. 
We have the Kepler telescope to thank for the sudden 
explosion in observations. In 2009, the American space

telescope was sent on a rather dull mission: to stare into the 
same small section of space for four years. Kepler did not focus 
on planets, but on dimming in the light from the 150,000 stars 
present in the section. The indirect measurement method is 
due to the fact that planets are very small and inferior in 
relation to stars. Our own Sun, which is quite average, 
contains 99% of all matter in the Solar system and could house 
Earth 1,300,000 times. If you were 40 light years away and 
looked at our solar system, the Sun would steal the picture 
completely and outshine Earth. But every time Earth passes 
the Sun, it blocks out a little of the sunlight, and that dimming 
could be detected by distant telescopes. So, if the light from a

ASTRONOMERS ON LOOK-OUT
FOR DANCING STARS
The Kepler observations alone, based on this so-called transit 
method, have disclosed 5,000 possible exoplanets so far. And 
the astronomers are far from done churning through the huge 
amounts of data from Kepler. Simona Ciceri’s task on her night 
shift at the La Silla Observatory is precisely to investigate 
some of the exoplanet candidates in detail to classify them 
correctly. She does that by looking for dancing stars.
The light from a star, which is moving towards us, is 
“compressed” and appears to be more blue in colour, while the 
light from a star moving away appears to be more red. This 
phenomenon is called blueshift and redshift, respectively. 
The gravitational pull from a planet in orbit causes its star 
to wobble very slightly in relation to the viewing angle – it is 
dancing. If Ciceri detects a dancing star via blueshift and

Techniques 
Detect Distant 
Space Objects
The astronomers' hunt for small, 
distant planets billions of km away 
requires ultra-precise measurement 
methods. Most planets are 
discovered using space telescopes, 
while specialised 
instruments based on 
Earth are used to 
confirm the find and 
take photos of the 
alien space objects.

redshift, she knows that something is pulling at it, probably 
orbiting planets. On Ciceri’s list of possible candidates are the 
coordinates and the time at night when the exoplanets are in 
a position so that her pilot can lock on to his target.
The radial velocity method, as it is called, is one of the 
planet hunter’s most important tools. And the  HARPS 
instrument at the La Silla Observatory is the most outstanding 
of its kind. The instrument discovered the first Earth-like 
planet outside our solar system in the inhabitable zone – the 
famous Goldilocks zone. 
In the old folktale, Goldilocks eats the Baby Bear’s porridge, 
which is “neither too warm, not too cold”. The same could be 
said about the planets: Those that orbit too far from their star 
are dark, barren and deep-frozen. And if they orbit too close, 
they are transformed into boiling infernos. Both scenarios are 
very inhospitable. The ultimate trophy for planet hunters is 
to find a planet, which offers all conditions for life. Among the 
newly discovered planets, the astronomers are now finding 
an increasing number in Goldilocks zones. 
In 2016, astronomers announced that they had found a 
planet that orbited our nearest star after the Sun, Proxima 
Centauri. And earlier this year, a Belgian team published the 
discovery of a solar system with seven planets in all, orbiting 
a dwarf star. The beer-loving astronomers named the system 
TRAPPIST-1 in celebration of the monastery brew of their 
homeland, and the planets were named after their preferred 
beer brands. As many as three of the planets are similar to 
Earth and offer conditions that could potentially house life.
 IN A GALAXY FAR, FAR AWAY ... 
The Trappist system is 40 light years away, which, according 
to the astronomers, is right next-door. And yet, it is 
incredibly far away. Light holds the speed record in the 
Universe and moves at a speed close to an impressive 
300,000 km/s. This means that a photon can travel from the 
Moon to Earth before we can say exoplanet (but not back 
again). The light from our star, the Sun, reaches us only eight 
minutes after the light particles have left the surface of the 
Sun. And within a year, the light covers a staggering 
9,460,730,472,580.8 km – also called a light year. Most 
systems are several hundred light years away, so it goes 
without saying that delicate gear is required to record the

PLANET BLOCKS THE LIGHT FROM ITS SUN

If a planet is orbiting a star, the starlight will 
be dimmed a little every time the planet is in 
front of the star. The Kepler space telescope 
has found thousands of planets by measuring changes 
in light. When the James Webb telescope is launched  in 
2019, researchers will be able to see even more clearly.

A planet pulls a little at its star, affecting the 
light that we see. When the gravitational force 
of an exoplanet pushes the star towards Earth, 
the light waves are pushed together and become blue in 
colour. The HARPS instrument at the La Silla Observatory 
in Chile can measure these tiny colour variations.

Planets in other solar systems are very difficult 
to see directly, as they drown in the light from 
their star. A so-called coronagraph shuts off all 
direct light from the star, yet lets through the light 
reflected by an exoplanet. In 2017, the SPHERE instrument 
on the VLT telescope took its first direct planet photo.

JAMES BOND VILLAIN LIVES WITH ASTRONOMERS
The VLT observatory has been built in the wilderness of the 
Atacama Desert, far away from light-polluting buildings. And 
far away from everything else. Fresh water has to be brought 
here every day on tankers, and until recently, electricity came 
from their own generator. Even small amounts of light can 
destroy the observations from the sensitive instruments, so 
there are no street lamps here. Cars cannot use their 
headlights, but must make do with indicators and reflectors 
inserted in the road. Pedestrians have to find their way in the 
darkness of the Chilean nights using a small and weak torch, 
which must always be pointed downwards. All windows are 
fitted with heavy blackout curtains to keep daylight out 
when the astronomers sleep during the day – and just as 
important: To keep  light inside during the night so that it does 
not interfere with the measurements. 
The entire residential area, where up to 100 visiting 
astronomers eat and sleep, is built into the rock and blends 
in well with the red ochre colours of the desert. An inside 
atrium completes the futuristic impression and makes the 
building look like something out of a James Bond film – 
which it actually is. In Quantum of Solace, 007 runs around 
the roof of the building, which, in the film, is home to the 
villain, Dominic Greene. 
The VLT telescope consists of four silos that tower 
majestically on a hilltop a few hundred metres from the 
residential area. Every silo contains a telescope with a 
primary mirror, each 8.2 m in diameter. One mirror can take 
snapshots of space objects that are four billion times weaker 
than what can be seen by the human eye. 
When the telescopes are combined in the so-called 
interferometer of the complex, the astronomers can see 
details that are up to 16 times smaller than with the individual 
telescopes. The collected light rays from the telescopes are 
combined using mirrors installed in a labyrinthine 
underground tunnel system, which could be perfect for a 
James Bond film too. Here, the length of the light rays’ orbit 
must be kept within less than a thousandth of a millimetre 
across a distance of over 100 m. It is hardly surprising that the 
underground system is closed country for curious visitors. 
Working together, the four telescope units can make 
measurements that correspond to the astronomers, from 
Earth, being able to see the thread of a screw at the 
International Space Station, which is orbiting 400 km above 
us. Each telescope is attached to new, advanced instruments 
with incomprehensible acronyms such as ESPRESSO and 
SPHERE. Even when explained they do not make much 
sense to the uninitiated – but to the astronomers, they offer 
endless opportunities.

ESPRESSO, for example, is the newest generation of 
spectrometers and is the successor of HARPS, the planet 
hunter. Where HARPS could record changes in the “star 
dance” of 3.5 km/h – a quiet dance – ESPRESSO, with all four 
VLT telescopes working together, will be able to record 
changes of just 0.35 km/h – a very slow waltz. Small planets 
exercise less force on their stars than large ones, so the 
sensitive ESPRESSO will be able to spot the presence of far 
smaller Earth-like planets. 
SPHERE is more direct in its approach. The instrument can 
spot a planet directly, even if the light from it is one million 
times weaker than its star. The instrument functions like 
sunglasses with polarized lenses, which filter out the 
generated starlight. SPHERE has also solved the problem of 
blinking stars, which may excite poets and those in love – but 
not astronomers. The blinking is due to dust particles in the 
atmosphere, which distort the light from the stars. Using 
adaptive optics, SPHERE corrects the starlight 1,200 times/s 
using deformed mirrors. Last year, the astronomers published 
a photo of SPHERE’s first catch: A Jupiter-like planet, orbiting 
a star 365 light years away. 
NEW TELESCOPE BEATS ALL RECORDS
Yet, no instrument is better than the light that the telescope 
is able to receive back on Earth. Anyone who visits Paranal 
has a view of the place only 20 km away, where Earth’s 
biggest eye to the sky is under construction. 
In June 2014, the entire top of the 3,000-m-high mountain 
Cerro Armazones was blown away so that the construction of 
the Extremely Large Telescope, which it is aptly named, could 
commence. ELT will be bigger than all existing reflecting 
telescopes in the world combined and will be able to collect 15 
times as much light as the largest optical telescope today. The 
life nerve of the telescope is four mirrors, which will beat the 
record in precision and functionality. One of them has been 
nicknamed the “rubber mirror” and will be in charge of the 
adaptive optics. It will be 2.6 m in diameter, but only 2 mm 
thick. It will be controlled by up to 8,000 control units, which, 
several thousand times every second, will adjust for 
atmospherics or wind. The other three (primary, secondary 
and tertiary) will collect and focus the light. The secondary 
mirror alone measures 4.2 in diameter and weighs 3.5 tonnes. 
The mirror was cast in Germany, and now has to cool down 
for a year, before French specialists can grind the mirror to a 
precision that only allows for a 15-nanometre margin. This 
corresponds to only allowing a difference in height at the 
surface of the Atlantic Ocean of max. 3.5 cm. The primary 
mirror will also be quite an accomplishment to make – and not 
least coordinate – as it consists of 798 perfectly ground, 
hexagonal mirrors, which each measure 1.4 m in diameter. 
When, in 2024, the mirrors are pointed towards the Chilean 
night sky, Simona Ciceri and the other planet hunters will, for 
the first time, be able to focus on the distant space objects. And 
the list of interesting candidates to zoom in on is constantly 
growing. During her night shift in the command room at the La 
Silla Observatory, Ciceri was able to add yet another one: A 
Saturn-like planet, which orbits its giant star, EPIC 228754001 
with a wobbling motion. At the time of writing these lines, the 
number of confirmed exoplanets is 3,671. By the time you 
actually read these lines, more have probably been added. 
Check it out yourself at www.exoplanet.eu. Happy hunting. 
ELT will be able to collect 
100 m times more light 
than the human eye and 
deliver pictures, which are 
16 times sharper than those 
from the Hubble telescope.

A
white-bellied tiger shark glides 
across a large, rounded hollow 
in the red surface of the 
mountain reef. At five metres, 
it is among the largest sharks 
on the reef off the Dampier Peninsula, WA. But 
this part of the world is not unfamiliar with 
animals of epic proportions. The hollow in the 
reef is an ancient footprint made by a dinosaur, 
whose gigantic body weighed more than ten 
elephants. The print is one of several thousands 
of dinosaur footprints. When the tide falls, the 
remains of a more than 100-km-long main road 
for prehistoric giants emerge along the coast.
Over 130 million years ago, this area was a 
vast floodplain where large herds of plant-
eating dinosaurs and smaller groups of 
predatory dinosaurs moved through the mud to 
drink water, eat green plants or hunt other 
dinosaurs. The flocks counted some of the 
largest terrestrial 
animals that 
h a v e  
e v e r 
existed – long-
necked giants 
called sauropods. But they were not the only 
giants on the floodplain. Two-legged plant 
eaters the size of elephants and armoured 
dinosaurs weighing several tonnes passed each 
other in the mud, chased by fierce predators.
The amazing find is a unique snapshot 
from the world of dinosaurs, and thanks to 
drones and new computer technology, 
researchers are able to map every millimetre of 
the prehistoric scene.
MUD CAPTURES A SNAPSHOT
Prehistoric animal life in the are that tectonic 
forces would one day make the Dampier 
Peninsula was rich and varied, according to 
palaeontologists from the University of 
Queensland and James Cook. They have 
examined the dinosaur prints at 48 sites on the 
once swampy floodplain. So far, they have 
described 150 prints belonging to 21 different 
species from four known groups of dinosaurs. 
Nowhere else in the world are so many 
different footprints been found in one area.
And the many dinosaurs have been close to 
each other. Most of the prints were made within 
a period of a maximum of a few weeks, maybe 
even a few days. The coast thus offers a 
magnificent snapshot from the beginning of the 
Cretaceous Period. 
For palaeontologist Steven Salisbury from 
the University of Queensland, it was a very 
special experience to uncover the footprints: 
“You stand in the middle of an area that 
used to be full of fantastic animals, and some of 
the prints look fresh. It is like a snapshot: You 
can see that this is where they were walking 
and which way they went. As if the animals 
had passed yesterday. To be so close to the live 
animals –  you do not get that when you find 
fossilised bones,” he says. 
The place is called “Australia’s Jurassic Park”, 
and Steven Salisbury compares the area to the 
African Serengeti plain, which is known for its 
varied animal life.
For a period of two years, he and a handful 
of researchers and assistants measured, 
scanned, photographed and made casts of the 
footprints under extremely difficult conditions. 
A total of 400 hours of work on the coast and 
another four years of work at their desks have

hree-dimensional digital versions of 
fossilised footprints let researchers 
see new aspects of the lives of the extinct 
giants. The digital copies can calculate 
three-dimensional conditions based on 
the measurements from several photos. 
Lasers are used to measure differences in 
depth at the surface. 
The researchers use both technologies 
at three different distances from the 
prints. First, close to the prints using a 
hand-held laser and camera on a tripod, 
then further away, where the equipment 
is mounted on a drone, and finally, far 
away with the equipment on board a 
small plane moving slowly over the prints.
Once the data has been collected, 
image processing programmes can create 
3D models at resolutions from less than a 
millimetre to up to several kilometres. 
The models make it possible to quickly 
judge whether it is a dinosaur footprint 
and which type of dinosaur it is from. 
Height differences in the print also 
offer information about the weight and 
gait of the animal, while detailed 
measurements of the distance between 
the individual footprints tell about the 
size of the animal or the speed at which it 
was moving.
Flooding 
Preserved The 
Footprints
The footprints have survived 
for  130 million years, and they 
are keeping well. A number of 
special conditions ensured 
their preservation until today.
At the time of the dinosaurs, the dark reefs off the Dampier Peninsula coast were a muddy floodplain.

scientific article about the fossilised footprints.
LOCALS ASKED FOR HELP
The footprints are located in a remote and 
inaccessible area, so no one has systematically 
mapped them before. Only a few prints are 
described in the scientific literature. Yet, the 
local aborigines have known about the prints 
for centuries and the three-toed prints of 
predatory dinosaurs form part of their 
mythology as the footprint of one of the spirits 
that, in their story of creation, shaped the land. 
In 2008, the sacred footprints were 
endangered as the oil and gas company

Giants Warmed 
Up The Planet
130 m years ago, a dinosaur the size of a 150-passenger 
plane wandered through the Australian mud. Vast amounts 
of plants were fermenting in its stomach, transforming into 
several kilos of greenhouse gas during the day. Thanks to 
skeletons from relatives of the giant, researchers now 
know more about the world's largest terrestrial animal 
than ever before.
Tail bones were hollow
The bones in the tail, back and neck 
were full of air cells, which made them 
lighter and easier to carry.

sauropod. This print is the largest one that has ever been found.
$45b gas works. Following approval, the 
company initiated preliminary investigations at 
James Price Point, close nearby.
At that time, the footprints had only been 
superficially examined by the British 
palaeontologist Tony Tholburn, and the 
Australian authorities were unaware of their 
scientific value. So local indigenous leaders 
approached Steven Salisbury, hoping that he 
would support their knowledge that the area 
was worthy of preservation. 
“I was overwhelmed. After a few days at the 
site, I had seen hundreds of prints. Two or three 
square kilometres are dotted with dinosaur 
impressions,” says the palaeontologist about his 
first visit to the area.

is difficult to work in. Many prints are 
only visible a few hours a day, a 
few months a year when the 
tide falls. Otherwise, they are 10 
m underwater. 
Salisbury set up camp on the coast, and 
every morning at dawn and every after noon at 
low tide, they went out to the reefs, armed with 
measuring tapes, cameras and silicone to 
measure, take pictures and make casts of the 
prints. Due to the tide, they were under extreme 
time pressure.
“We were jumping from rock to rock, but 
often we became so absorbed in the prints that we 
did not notice that the water was coming back. 
We stranded on a small island. And then we had 
to wade back, water up to our chest, to the beach 
with our gear above our heads!”

Busy stomach
A sauropod weighing 
70 tonnes would have to 
eat more than 500 kg of leaves 
every day. Researchers once 
believed that sauropods had to 
swallow stones to digest the 
food inside the stomach, but 
recent research suggests that 
the animals had an efficient 
digestive system.
Long neck made life easy
The dinosaur's neck was nine metres 
long and probably had 14 cervical 
vertebrae – twice as many as a mammal. 
The neck was flexible, allowing the sauropod 
to sweep across a large radius and munch 
on coniferous trees and other green 
plants without using much 
energy to move its body.
Small brain
Even the largest sauropod's head 
was not much bigger than a 
horse's head. The brain weighed only a 
few hundred grammes, and the animal 
was probably not very intelligent.
Teeth tore at trees
Sauropod teeth were 
cylinder-shaped or spoon-
shaped and designed to tear 
and rip leaves and green 
matter from trees 
and bushes. They 
were not for 
chewing.
Egg-laying giant 
Despite the huge size 
of the adult animals, 
their eggs were not much 
larger than an ostrich egg, 
which weighs 1.5 kilo. 
Researchers believe that the 
young sauropods could gain 
up to two tonnes a year.
Gas heated Earth
Researchers have 
calculated that a sauropod 
released two kilograms of 
methane a day, contributing
to global warming.
Bones were solid
The thigh bone was more 
than one metre in 
circumference and solid. This 
was necessary in order to carry 
the huge weight of the animal.

All was well, until they were 
told that one of Australia’s 
infamous salt-water crocodiles had 
been spotted exactly where they had 
waded back to land. Being in the water 
here can be lethal – not least because of the 
many sharks that circle the reefs. 
And the challenges faced by the 
researchers only became bigger when the

Demonstrators attempted to stop the gas

fought to maintain control over the situation. 
The tense atmosphere pushed the researchers 
to speed up.
DRONES MAP THE FOOTPRINTS
The researchers got hold of a few drones and 
equipped them with cameras and laser 
scanners. With their new equipment, they 
were able to quickly map the prints, while 
being on safe land themselves – far away from 
crocodiles and sharks. They also used a small 
plane that could also glide. The silent plane 
flew at a speed of 130 km/h, took pictures and 
scanned the prints across great distances, 
giving an impression of the floodplain with the 
prints as it once was.
The researchers also continued to walk 
around the reefs, measuring, photographing 
and scanning the prints. The combination of 
LARGE PREDATORY DINOSAURS 
PATROLLED THE FLOODPLAIN
The Australian floodplain was a well-filled 
buffet for carnivores. A total of five different 
kinds of predatory dinosaurs hunted for 
herbivores in the area or quenched their thirst 
in the river water. The predators were huge. 
One was medium-sized, while the others were 
up to seven metres long. The three-toed 
footprint of the predators is easy to recognise.
Australia: Full Of
Predators And Vegetarians
More than 20 different types of dinosaurs trampled through the 
Australian mud  within a few days. Never before have researchers found 
such a diverse collection of the extinct giants, especially when evidence 
suggests they were all alive at more-or-less the same time.

the large amount of picture data resulted in 
detailed 3D pictures of both individual prints, 
entire series of prints and the scenery of which 
the prints form part. 
“We could not have made these discoveries 
ten years ago. Technology has changed our 
work fundamentally,” says Steven Salisbury. 
The technology is completely new at every 
step, from the camera to the LIDAR laser 
scanner to the drone, allowing the work to be 
performed faster and more easily, while also 
allowing the researchers to record far more 
details. Even the silicone for making casts of 
the prints has improved. Previously, silicone 
was far more difficult and time-consuming to 
work with. Now, it only takes 20 minutes to 
make a cast.
SENSATION HIDING IN THE ROCKS
Despite the new technology, they almost 
overlooked the area's greatest sensation.
“We almost walked past the print of a giant 
sauropod, as it did not look like a print and was 
larger than any of the others,” says Salisbury. 
Measuring 1.7 m in length, the print is the 
largest footprint ever found. 
The huge print revealed that Australia was 
home to some of the world’s largest dinosaurs, 
and the find won the researchers worldwide 
recognition. In spite of this, Salisbury does not 
think that this was the most important find made 
by the team. To him, it is far more important that

the researchers have now documented prints 
from so many different dinosaurs from a time 
and a place with almost no other dinosaur 
remnants. Thus, the well-trodden floodplain has 
filled a giant hole in the researchers’ knowledge 
about the evolution of life. 
RESEARCHERS CHECK NEW EVIDENCE
As a result of the work performed by the 
palaeontologists, part of the area has been 
preserved as a national cultural heritage site.

GIANTS FLOCKING IN THE MUD
Most of the Australian footprints have 
been made by herbivorous sauropods. The 
prints come from animals of all sizes, but 
many of them are from very large animals, 
up to 40 m long. The largest print, which is 
also the world's largest, measures 1.7 m. 
Researchers expect to find prints from even 
more sauropods on the coast soon.
SMALL AND LARGE HERBIVORES 
ENCOUNTERED EACH OTHER
The river delta also boasted flocks of 
ornithopods. The ornithopods were herbivores 
and mostly walked on their hind legs. The 
Australian mud shows footprints from small 
animals, less than two metres in length, while 
the largest print measures some 80 cm and 
was made by an animal that measured more 
than three metres from hips to the ground.
FIRST STEGOSAURUS

The stegosauri were herbivores with 
rows of spikes or plates along their backs

that the stegosauri also came to Australia.

The researchers continue to document the 
footprints. So far, they have mapped an area 
covering 24 km, but the prints are scattered 
across more than 100 km. Once again, the 
researchers are under time pressure – this time 
the threat to the invaluable prints is the 
construction of a cruise ship marina.
However, their scientific work is not only of 
great importance to the local community. Their 
sensational discoveries show how new 
technology can draw detailed information from 
the footprints that giants of the past have made 
all over the world. The fossilised prints still hold 
invaluable information about the way in which 
the extinct animals moved and behaved, and 
more researchers  than ever are now examining 
them. And the palaeontologists already know 
that our planet offers at least ten times as much 
evidence as bones. A single dinosaur left  only 
one skeleton behind, yet made millions of 
footprints during its lifetime. 
The fossilised mud with the dinosaur 
footprints forms a 100-km-long and thin 
border off the Dampier Peninsula. At the 
time of the dinosaurs, the area was close 
to the coast of a huge continent, which 
also included India  and Antarctica.

Is it a drone? Is it a driverless car? Or is it a Hyperloop train? 
In its new flying car, Airbus combines all three. And with this, 
the French company adds yet another ingenious model to the 
large number of flying cars that could soon be taking off.
THE FLYING CAR 
IS TAKING OFF
Y
our important meeting begins at 
0900h, and the radio reports 
heavy traffic on the motorway 
into town. But you are taking it 
easy. The coffee is brewing, you 
book a Pop.Up on your smartphone, and 
minutes later, the small, self-driving electric car 
rolls up outside your front door. You get in and 
are quickly taken to the nearest drone station 
in your suburb. A drone attaches itself to the 
passenger cabin you are in, and the journey 
continues in the air, high above the chaos of the 
rush-hour traffic. Soon after, you land on top of 
a skyscraper – in time for your meeting and 
without having ever left the cabin. You step 
out, the Pop.Up takes off and finds its way to a 
charger station or the next customer.
This is how Airbus imagines the future 
with their Pop.Up car drone concept. The 
system will combine driving and flying in the 
rapidly growing metropolises, where km-long 
queues on the roads constantly add to transport 
time and pollution. The idea of the flying car is 
anything but new, but only now are several 
models about to become a reality.
TRAFFIC CONGESTION
COSTS TRILLIONS
The purpose of the flying car is to create a 
means of transport that goes directly from A to 
B  and which can be operated by ordinary 
travellers without the need for expensive 
specialist pilot's licensing. And people seem to 
embrace the new airborne transport.
A study conducted by researchers from  the 
University of Michigan reveals that 53 % are 
such great fans of flying cars that they would 
consider buying one. On the condition, 
however, that their new means of transport 
can cover at least 600 km between every refill, 
can take off and land vertically and does not 
cost more than a luxury car. Also, the majority 
of the interested buyers prefer to fly using 
electric power, not petrol. And electric motors 
are being used in several new concept

A passenger cabin. Four wheels. And a drone module. These parts combine 
as needed in the Airbus Pop.Up concept, which always finds the fastest 
route to the destination - and the passengers do not need to get out.
Passenger Cabin Switches
From Wheels to Rotors En Route
DRONE MODULE 
OUTSMARTS WIND 
Eight oppositely directed 
rotors on four electric engines rotate 
to create balance, and thus stability – 
especially in strong headwinds and 
turbulence around buildings. Sensors 
ensure obstacles are avoided.
THE CABIN READS YOUR MOOD
The 2.6-m-long carbon fibre cabin has room 
for two people. Augmented reality technology 
on the windscreen shows information about the 
surroundings as you pass them - as maps and 
photos. You stay in the same seat throughout 
the journey, and artificial intelligence reads your 
mood and sets the cabin light accordingly. 
CAR MODULE GIVES ELECTRCITY
The skateboard-like car module is fitted with 
lithium-ion batteries, which offer power for approx. 
130 km of driving. The passenger cabin changes from 
car to drone at custom-made changing and 
recharging stations, where the car module will stay 
and recharge. Power is transferred from the car 
module via the passenger cabin to the drone module. 
Artiﬁ cial Intelligence 
Finds Fastest Route
Airbus will develop artificial 
intelligence, which will both be able to 
plan the fastest and most comfortable 
route and keep track of the many 
transport units in the system.
YOU BOOK YOUR TRIP ON YOUR PHONE 
In an app, you select destination and arrival 
time. The artificially intelligent system reads the 
traffic on the ground and sends you a number of 
suggestions for routes and transport methods to 
choose from.
STOP 1: COLLECTION BY CAR 
The self-driving car arrives at your address 
after having received a signal from the booking 
system. Your phone notifies you about its 
arrival, and you can get inside the passenger  
cabin and roll off.

vehicles, as they are less expensive to 
operate, less noisy and less polluting. 
Pollution and congestion are precisely what 
make the flying cars so interesting right now. 
The US and EU are plagued by long queues on 
the approach roads in the cities, and every day 
in Los Angeles, drivers are stuck in traffic one 
third of the time. Studies have shown that, in 
2030, congestion will cost the US and EU over 
$400 billion. By then, some 60 % of the world’s 
inhabitants – five billion people – will be living 
in cities, and although not everybody will have 
the option to commute in a flying car, there will 
be a demand and a market for them. 
DRONES AND CARBON PAVE THE WAY
Fortunately, several promising technologies 
have developed rapidly over the past years and 
have given engineers the hope of  flying cars 
within a few years. 
Some of the most important initiatives 
have been taken with the development of 
drones, where rotors and batteries are 
important for the development of realistic, 
flying electric cars. For example, coaxial rotors 
– two rotors opposite each other, which spin in 
opposite directions – offer far better stability in 
strong and unpredictable winds. Thus, 
manoeuvrability in tight spaces, like in the 
airspace of cities, has increased considerably. 
And if you add a multi-rotor system with four 
or more coaxial rotors, the lifting capacity is 
increased several times. This principle is used 
in the passenger drones Pop.Up and the 
Chinese Ehang 184. 
Lithium-ion batteries are also to be credited 
for the emergence of the flying electric car. Of 
all the rechargeable batteries, the lithium-ion 
type has the highest energy density, requires 
the least maintenance and has far lower self-
discharge that other batteries. The newest 
lithium-ion types, for example, are strong 
enough to make a flying electric car with drone 
rotors take off and land vertically. This requires 
a very high energy density for an object the size 
of a car and has only become possible within 
recent years. Energy density expresses the 
amount of energy stored in the battery – often 
as watt hours per kilogramme – and today, the 
best-flying car batteries offer some 250 Wh/kg. 
This is enough power for short flights. 
Before flying electric cars can cover long 
stretches of between 300 and 600 km, the 
energy density needs to be increased to at least 
400 Wh/kg, researchers estimate. With the 
lithium-ion battery, which is currently only 
improved by 5 % every year, this will take some 
time. So researchers are also looking into the 
possibility of fitting flying electric cars with 
lithium-metal or lithium-sulphur batteries, 
which have a higher energy density. In recent 
years, battery developers have reduced the 
teething troubles of frequent short-circuiting 
and high self-discharge in these batteries, and 
many prototypes now deliver an energy 
density of more than 300 Wh/kg. This is plenty 
for trips to work and back, even for passengers 
living in the remotest of city suburbs.
Together with battery technology, the 
emergence of new lightweight materials also 
plays a role for the development of the flying 
car. The lower the weight, the less engine 
power or battery capacity is needed in the 
STOP 4: EXIT
You land and get out. The drone module 
finds its own way back to a charging station and 
may collect new customers on the way back. 
The system works out whether there is enough 
power for another trip.
STOP 2: CHANGE TO HYPERLOOP 
At a train station, the passenger cabin is auto-
matically placed in the superfast Hyperloop train. 
The magnetic train is expected from 2020, and 
will be able to transport passenger cabins at a 
speed of up to  1200 km/h.
STOP 3: CHANGE TO DRONE
Your passenger cabin will be collected by 
a car at the train station and taken to a change 
site. Here, a  drone attaches to your cabin and 
lifts you up – above congestion and other such 
proletarian obstacles. 
craft. As it is precisely the engines and batteries 
that weigh the most in a flying car, this gives a 
cumulative weight advantage. 
Slovakian AeroMobil, for example, which is 
expected to hit the market in 2020, is made of a 
so-called pretensioned carbon composite: The 
carbon material in the flying car, which is 
already strong, has been made even stronger 
by mixing it with a hardened plastic mass 
during production. Highly sensitive machinery 
ensures that the ratio of ingredients is very 
precise, so that the carbon fibres and plastic 
mass are bound closely together and the 
material achieves high strength in relation to 
its low weight. This way, room – or rather 
weight – has been made for airbags and a built-
in ballistic  parachute in the AeroMobil. The 
parachute is pushed out of a small container in 
the hull and opens quickly in case of a crash. 
The safety equipment showed its worth during 
a test flight in 2015, when a prototype crashed 
and was badly damaged – but the pilot escaped 
almost unharmed. 
In recent years, increased safety, together 
with new lightweight materials, improved 
battery power and the fast-growing drone 
technology, have combined to allow the flying 
car to gain momentum. But challenges 
persist,with some of the major ones being 
safety and traffic rules in the airspace of cities. 
Without a highway in the sky, the flying cars 
will never be able to take off. 
NASA WILL MAKE AIRSPACE SAFE
Flying cars will fly lower and closer to each 
other than air traffic as we know it today. The 
proximity to the ground will increase the 
influence from wind and weather, as turbulent 
gusts of wind may form around buildings or 
ridges in the landscape, and densely built-up 
city areas will increase the risk of collisions in 
the air. Accidents involving road users on the 
ground, especially during landings, must also be 
considered. This requires a fine-meshed road 
$433
billion will be the price 
for time wasted in car 
queues in Europe and 
the US by 2030.

system with flight corridors and traffic signals 
to control the airways. 
NASA is currently developing their own 
concept, the Unmanned Traffic Management 
(UTM), which will control class G of the 
airspace, the lower airspace below 365 m. The 
system covers geofenced areas, where GPS 
coordinates define the roads, special traffic 
lights in the air and sensor technology, which 
will keep the airborne craft aware of buildings 
or other craft in the corridors. 
And in 2017, NASA presented a new type 
of course calculator developed with a neural 
network. The neural network was fed a host of 
data about speeds, wind conditions and 
possible deviations to the course. Based on that, 
it was able to predict an unmanned aircraft’s 
course under a range of weather conditions 
with an error margin of just two metres. This 
may be a useful collision defence once the 
airspace over the city is filled with traffic. 
NASA’s traffic system, which is initially 
intended for self-guided drones, is currently 
being tested in the air above sparsely populated 
areas in the US. 
In early 2018, NASA technicians will move 
to more densely populated city areas before, 
according to the plan, the system will be 
presented to the American aviation authorities, 
FAA, in 2019. If approved, the NASA developers 
can begin to incorporate the next logical step of 
air-control: The fully-autonomous and 
therefore idiot-proof flying car.
FLYING TOYOTA TO 
OPEN 2020 OLYMPICS
NASA’s traffic management and the range of 
new technologies and car concepts give 
potential customers reason to be optimistic, 
even if it is unlikely that the flying cars or taxis 
will fill the morning sky, carrying everyday 
commuters, before way into the 2020s. Already 
in 2020, the drone car SkyDrive, which is built 
in Japan, has been planned to light the Olympic 
fire at the Tokyo summer games. Toyota, the 
giant, is behind, and their message is clear: The 
future of the car is flying.

Air Taxi to Fly in

Combined craft are to ensure success of the plan.
A
n initial fleet of 50 flying taxis 
will soon expand to 1,000 
worldwide. This is the ambition of 
the car pool company Uber, which 
will open their first flying taxi service 
in Dallas Airport in 2025. Uber has 
the customers and capital for the 
project, while five partner companies 
have been asked to construct a flying 
car that meets the demands. The 
craft must be electric, able to take off 
and land vertically and able to offer 
three hours of intensive rush-hour 
transport morning and evening. This 
makes demands on speed and energy 
consumption, and the suppliers are 
concentrating on transition or 
combi-craft, which land 
and take off using 
rotors, but fly ahead 
using propellers and

have caused problems. In 2009, the man

20 % of infections occur by 
inhaling virus from a sneeze.
VIRUS ATTACKS 
MUCOSA CELLS
3
The virus enters the 
nose and throat and 
attacks the mucosa cells by 
injecting its genes into 
them. The virus genes 
make the cell produce new 
copies of the virus, causing 
the cell to ultimately burst 
and die and releasing the 
new virus particles.
SNOT RINSES OUT 
THE VIRUS
4
The virus particles find 
their way to new cells, 
which suffer the same fate. 
The nose tries to rinse out 
the virus and dead cells via 
snot, causing the respiratory 
passages to block. The snot 
runs into the stomach or is 
flung out of the mouth 
when you sneeze, spreading 
the infection.

he commuters stand close to each 
other in the bus, and the damp 
oozes from their wet coats. Here 
and there, people take a 
handkerchief out of their 
pockets and rub it against their runny noses. 
Suddenly, a violent sneeze resounds through 
the bus. More than 100,000 cold virus particles 
fly out of the mouth of the sneezing person at 
a speed of approx. 100 km/h. Some of the 
particles land on the posts, which the 
passengers hold on to, and here, they can 
infect anybody who comes into contact with 
them during the next two days.
Only few people make it through the 
winter without suffering from a cold, and 
many of us fall ill two-four times a year. 
Fortunately, it is not that dangerous to catch a 
cold, but unlike many more severe illnesses, a 
common cold cannot be prevented or cured. At 
present, if you are infected, you can only wait 
until the snot stops running out of your nose 
after a few days. 
Now, however, researchers are testing a 
range of promising cold medicines, and if some 
of them live up to the expectations, we will, in 
a few years’ time, be able to take a pill when we 
feel the first itching in the back of the throat, or 
even see our doctor  to be vaccinated against 
most of the virus strains.
200 VIRUSES MAKE 
US CATCH A COLD
The common cold costs society billions every 
year. An American study shows that, on 
average, an adult wastes ten working hours 
every year because of the condition. Only one 
fourth of the time lost is spent under the covers 
at home. Most of the time is wasted when the 
infected people come to work, yet are so snotty 
and weakened by coughing or sore throats that 
they are less productive than normally. 
The common cold is the most widespread 
infectious disease in the world; the reason 
being, among other things, that the condition 
is not caused by one particular virus, but by 
numerous different viruses. If, for example, 
you have fallen ill once due to rhinovirus 
HRV-A67, you have produced antibodies 
against it and will be immune to a subsequent 
attack. Yet, although HRV-A67 can no longer 
make you ill, your body remains completely 
unprepared for an attack by coronavirus 
HCoV-229E or any other of the approx. 200 
common cold viruses that the researchers have 
identified so far. 
Common to the many cold viruses is that 
they infect the cells in the mucosa of the nose 
and throat and develop the typical symptoms, 
such as a runny nose and coughing. But this is 
where the similarities end. Effective 
medication against a cold should therefore not 
target one virus very precisely; rather use a 
scatter-gun approach and target the entire 
gang of cold viruses. This is why there is not 
yet a vaccine against common cold. Vaccines 
target very specifically and must be tailored to 
one single virus. For influenza, doctors can 
pinpoint one virus strain, which will 
probably hit us in the coming winter, 
and develop a vaccine against it. 
However, to effectively protect 
us against cold, the doctors 
would, in principle, need to 
have over 200 vaccines.
Yet, researchers do see 
a light in the darkness, 
since 99 of the known 
cold viruses are closely 
related and belong to 
the group of rhinovirus. 
Together, they are the 
cause of some 40 % of 
a l l  
c a s e s  
o f 
common cold, and 
they are so similar 
that it may be 
possible to develop 
a common cure 
against all of them.

MYTH:
Vitamin C in high doses 
protects against a cold 
Vitamin C deficiency weakens 
the immune system, but very few 
people are suffering from vitamin 
C deficiency. Several studies have 
shown that the effect of vitamin C 
on a cold is no better than placebo, 
or that the effect is very small.

PROMISING VACCINE
WORKS ON MICE
In 2017, Professor of Immunology Rudolf 
Valenta from the Medical University of 
Vienna, Austria, took out a patent on a new 
vaccine, which aims to hit as many of the 99 
rhinoviruses as possible. So far, the vaccine has 
been tested on mice and rabbits and has been 
effective against at least five of the stubborn 
viruses. But much work remains to be done by 
the researcher to optimise the vaccine so that 
it can defeat all of them, and then it has to be 
tested on test subjects. Valenta hopes that, at 
best, the vaccine will be approved for humans 
in 6-8 years.
An effective vaccine will be the ultimate 
cure for a common cold, as it will make people 
immune and prevent the condition from taking 
hold at all. But some people are naturally 

76   |   SCIENCE ILLUSTRATED
almost immune to catching a cold, and now 
researchers are trying to uncover the secret 
behind their invulnerability. 
In 2013, Professor Sheldon Cohen of the 
Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, 
USA, recruited 152 healthy test subjects who 
accepted to have rhinovirus injected directly 
into their noses. In nearly a third, the virus did 
not take hold, and when the researchers 
studied cells from them in a microscope, a clear 
pattern emerged, showing who were infected, 
and who were not.
Cohen focused on the chromosomes, which 
are the carriers of our genes, in the white blood 
cells of the immune system. More precisely, he 
studied the so-called telomeres, which are 
placed at the end of the chromosomes like a 
kind of cap, which can be compared to the hard 
bit at the end of a shoelace. The telomeres in the 
test subjects were not of the same length, and it 
turned out that people with the shortest 
telomeres were at greater risk of catching a cold. 
77 % developed an infection, while only half of 
the persons with the longest telomeres did.
It also appeared that those with the 
shortest telomeres were twice as likely to 
develop actual cold symptoms compared those 
who had the longest ones. Thus, the study 
indicates that immune cells with short 
telomeres are less efficient when it comes to 
fighting cold virus.
NEW MEDICINE ATTACKS THE VIRUS
In addition to a vaccine, researchers are 
working on several promising drugs to 
target cold viruses – mainly rhinovirus 
–  even before it has made its way into the 
cells of the mucosa and started an infection.
When the rhinovirus is to infect a cell, it 
uses a kind of injection needle to inject its 
genetic material into the cell, where it assumes 
control and starts a production of thousands of 
new virus particles. The injection needle is a 
protein called VP4, which is placed inside the 
virus particle behind an-other protein, VP1. 
The VP1 sits in groups of five and makes up 
part of the virus particle. shell. For the injection 
needle to emerge, the five VP1 proteins need to 
slide apart and form an opening. Yet, this may 
be prevented by a new experimental drug, 
WIN 52084. 
Other researchers are developing new 
weapons, which do not attack the rhinovirus, 
until they have entered the cell and are about 
to multiply. The gemcitabine substance 
prevents the formation of new copies of its 
genome inside the cell, and in 2017, South 
Korean researchers showed that this is a 
promising strategy. The researchers infected 
mice with rhinovirus and then injected 
gemcitabine directly into their noses. 
Remarkably, the substance completely 
prevented the infection from taking hold, 
meaning that the rhinovirus could not be 
traced at all in the mouse after eight hours.
INFECTED SNEEZE
ON DOOR HANDLES
When a person suffering from a cold  sneezes, 
thousands of virus particles can hover in the air 
for hours and infect people who inhale them. In 
80 % of the cases, however, the infection is 
transferred via virus particles that attach to e.g. 
door handles, light switches or banisters. 
When touching the virus-infected surfaces, 
we get virus on our hands, which will 
invariably come into contact with our mouths, 
noses or eyes, and from here, the virus can 
make its way in to the respiratory passages. 
An American study has documented that 
the risk of infection can be considerably 
reduced if we wash our hands several times a 
day. In the study, school classes from five 
primary and secondary schools were divided 
into two groups. The pupils in the one group 
were asked to be extra careful about  washing 
their hands, and this simple piece of advice 
halved their number of sick days.
So while the researchers are busy 
developing effective drugs against cold 
viruses, the best piece of advice is to spend 
some of  the waiting time washing your hands 
thoroughly. 
MYTH:
It is easier to catch
a cold if you are cold
The cold virus reproduces best 
when you are cooled down by 2-4°C 
below normal body temperature. 
The main reason for each of us 
catching a cold in the winter, how-
ever, is that we are spending more 
time indoors, close to other people.

4 New Weapons Protect You 
Against The Next Cold
CREATES TENSION IN THE VIRUS
The substance cathelicidin works by 
creating a difference in tension, which 
makes the virus fall apart. Cathelicidin is 
positively charged, while the virus particle is 
negatively charged. In tests, the substance has 
reduced the cold infection by 70 %.
STOPS THE COPYING OF VIRUS
Once the genes of the virus, the RNA 
string, have entered the cell, the string 
begins to copy itself. Yet, the substance 
gemcitabin can stop the copying. The substance is 
similar to one of the building blocks in RNA, but 
prevents RNA from forming. The virus dies.
TRAPS THE VIRUS GENES
Before the cold virus can infect a cell, it has 
to open its shell and eject the VP4 protein. 
The protein works like an injection needle, 
which contains the genes of the virus. However, the 
experimental drug, WIN 52084, places itself like a 
ring on the virus, thereby trapping its genes.
HANDCUFFS THE VIRUS PROTEIN
The cold virus copies itself by making the in-
fected cell form an oblong virus protein. The 
protein must be divided into smaller pieces 
to become a new virus particle, but zinc can attach to 
the protein and prevent the division. So you may get 
a speedier recovery if taking zinc tablets.

The 5 liquids settle in 
layers with the heaviest at 
the bottom and the 
lightest at the top. 
Stack Reveals Density Difference
Microscopic molecules determine the liquid’s weight, 
but you can reveal it with a liquid stack in your own kitchen.
O
ne litre of milk weighs more than one 
litre of olive oil. The milk weighs 
1,030 g, whereas the oil only weighs 930 
g. The cause is not visible from the 
outside, but is hiding in the molecule’s 
shapes and their atomic make-up.
Molecular structure means a lot for 
how many molecules can be included in a 
specific quantity of liquid. And the more 
molecules, the heavier the liquid. It's like 
how a box neatly packed with reams of 
paper would be heavier than a box filled 
with crumpled up paper, as the shape of 
the paper ream allows for more paper to 
be fitted into the box. 
Just as important is the relationship 
between the number of carbon and 
oxygen atoms in the liquid. Oxygen atoms 
are heavier than carbon atoms, so liquids, 
whose molecules contain lots of oxygen, 
are heavier than liquids that mostly 
consist of carbon.
When you mix two liquids, the heavier 
will sink to the bottom of the glass.
CARBON MAKES OIL LIGHT
The molecules in olive oil contain long 
chains of the relatively light substances of 
carbon and hydrogen. The irregular shape 
of the molecules means that they cannot 
be close, and so, the liquid contains 
relatively few molecules.
OXYGEN MAKES HONEY HEAVY
Honey mainly consists of sugar 
molecules, which each contain several 
heavy oxygen atoms. The compact shape of 
the sugar ensures that many of the small 
molecules can be fitted into a relatively 
small quantity of liquid.
Compact shape and heavy atoms increase weight

s far as terrifying spider-faces go, this 
one (main picture) isn’t too bad, is it? 
He almost looks like a stuffed toy of some 
kind with those sweet little beady eyes.
Especially compared to that glaring, 
ogre-like monster, inset. Thing is, both 
images are of the same spider. It’s a net-
casting spider, and that pair of huge eyes 
gives the spider the binocular vision and 
ranging-accuracy it needs to hunt prey. 
Because as a net-caster, Deinopus 
(which means “fearful appearance”) 
doesn’t wait for smaller insects to come 
blundering into a web. Instead, the spider 
weaves a net like a prop from an old 
Gladiator movie. And when something 
tasty trundles by, the spider pounces, 
throwing the net and bundling up the 
prey with alarming speed.
This technique depends on those big 
eyes. The spider is nocturnal (that’s when 
you get all the best beetles) and each night 
it grows a special light-sensitive membrane 
inside each big eye. This gives Deinopus 
better night vision than a cat or an owl.
Weirdly though, the spider destroys 
and reabsorbs the membrane every 
morning. This ensures its rangefinding 
equipment is kept in peak operating 
condition for the hunt. Also, complex 
light-sensitive eyes take a lot of energy 
(even the human retina needs much more 
oxygen than other tissues), so it makes 
sense to cut this cost during the day when 
the eyes aren’t needed.
Successful net-casting requires perfect 
range calculations, and to assist in this, the 
spider will place “faecal dots” on a leaf in 
front of where it hangs waiting. The dots 
help the spider launch the net the right 
distance, since many insects have weird 
shapes or buzz around a lot, which can be 
visually confusing.
This Australian Deinopus 
(photographed in the Blue Mountains) has 
the species name subrufa, which means 
reddish. Females are a rusty red colour, 
and males are striped.
Which makes accuratly identifying 
this grey mottled individual a bit tricky. In 
fact, it’s possible this individual may even 
be a different species, not subrufa at all. 
Work continues on determining if there is 
just a single eastern-Aussie Deinopus or up 
to five different ones.
All we know is, what with the giant eyes 
and the net casting, we’re just glad Deinopus 
subrufa is only about 10cm long.
