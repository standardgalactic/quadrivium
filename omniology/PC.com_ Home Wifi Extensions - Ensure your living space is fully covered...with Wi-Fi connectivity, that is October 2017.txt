EDITOR’S NOTE
A WORD 
FROM
THE 
EDITORIAL 
TEAM
Editor’s Review pg.54
B
OO! October means pumpkins and sweet treats for 
Halloween. PC.com also has many sweet (tech) treats in 
store for you this spooktastic month. 
Featured for our Cover Story this month is a taste of 
IFA Berlin this year. Brands were showing off the latest and greatest 
in their line-up of gadgets, including some sweet, neat goodies from 
LG and Sony. We bring you the best from the showfloor, straight to 
pg. 38. 
Eyeing out for the Note8? Wondering if it’s worth that wallet 
slimming price tag? Wonder no more! We’ve got you covered. Head 
to pg. 54, as we put the Note to the test through a tough run. Also in 
our testing labs this month, we stress tested AMD’s RX Vega 64, to 
see how well it stacks up against other GPUs in the market. 
Ever get annoyed at connections dropping while surfing the 
net? Or generally just getting dead spots at home? We’ve pitted three 
mesh networks head-to-head to see which one gives you the best 
stable connections while you surf at home. That starts from pg. 81.
Looking to get in shape after getting all that sweet treats in 
your belly? We’ve got just the right selection of gizmos for you at pg 
43. With all the latest fitness gears to suit your needs, no worries 
about having that extra chocolate – you deserve it!
Finally, you can’t have Halloween without battling it out with 
friends over some games. In this issue we had a shoot-out with 
Destiny 2, as well as fighting for life and death at PlayerUnknown’s 
Battleground. Combat-filled, adrenaline-pumping action all at pg. 98. 
That and more woooonderfilled goodness, served straight to you!
Have a fun-filled Spooktober!

Yes, you can. All you need is a LAN cable. Make sure both consoles have been updated to the latest system 
software and connect them to the Internet. A screen will appear, asking if you want to start transferring the data 
from your old console to the new one. Connect the LAN cable on both consoles and just choose which data you 
want to transfer.
It’s basically an enhanced version of the Android Nougat, with some new features included. For example, when 
you get a new notification, a dot will appear on the app’s icon rather than a number. When you press the dot, you 
can see what’s new. Not to mention, there is a new picture-in-picture feature with improved battery performance 
and even new emojis.

Which smartphone is more worth it? The S8+ or the Note8? 
Subject 
S8+ or Note8?
It ultimately depends on your needs and preferences. The Note8 comes with a slightly larger screen, dual cameras 
and the S Pen. However, it does have a smaller battery as compared to the S8+. In terms of performance, both 
phones are great in its own right; the price differences also come into play as the Note8 is retailing at RM3,999 
while the S8+ is RM3,699. If you rather have a slightly smaller screen while still being cheaper, the S8 is selling at 
RM3,299.

Wiko’s
Here’s how you can achieve a good balance 
between work and play with Wiko’s help.
ith smartphones becoming more prevalent day by day, it is easy to get lost 
into the world of the Internet and social media. Although smartphones 
have made it much easier to keep in touch with family, friends and loved 
ones, a smartphone’s greatest asset is also its greatest weakness.
As smartphones are integrated into our work life, it essentially means we are 
never truly done with our jobs. Wiko is here to bring balance between your work and 
personal life with the Wiko Upulse. Paired with the Wiko Smart Folio WiBoard, you can 
now keep your smartphone protected while keeping it personalised as to how you see

notifications when it comes to work or even if it’s an important text from a loved one.

of the rest with its Smart Left Page. Swiping left on the home page will bring you your 
most viewed content in one screen. From checking the weather to getting the latest 
updates on current events, the Smart Left Page keeps you updated on the rest of the 
world around you. It also brings you one step closer to your contact, keeping you within 
swiping distance of a loved one.
There always should be a balance in life, especially when it comes to work and 
play. With work all done, what better way to let the people you care about know how 
you’re doing then with a selfie? Thanks to the 8-megapixel front-facing camera with 
f/2.0 aperture and soft light flash, you can now elevate your selfie game. With the help 
of the fingerprint sensor, a simple tap is all that is needed to take a selfie.
To take things a step further, the cameras on the Wiko Upulse can capture time-lapse 
videos to further enhance your cinematography skills. It can be done through the front- and 
rear-camera so it doesn’t matter with which lens you’d prefer to capture that moment 
with. Whether it’s a landscape shot of the city skyline or even by the beach with your 
friends, the Wiko Upulse will make every moment magical.

USE THE RIGHT LIGHT
Avoid ﬂuorescent lights at all costs because selﬁes 
taken under this light don’t compliment your skin 
tone. Take your selﬁes in natural light whenever 
possible, and avoid a strong backlight as it could
cast a shadow over your face. 
When taking selﬁes at night festivals, you should 
avoid having ﬂashing lights or lasers behind you,
as they will interfere with your shot.
HAVE SOMETHING 
EYE-CATCHING BEHIND YOU
People are more likely to pay attention to your 
selﬁes if they also happen to include something 
interesting behind you. After all, a selﬁe behind a 
white wall doesn’t tell much of a story. A selﬁe 
taken in front of a major landmark or amazing view 
is more interesting to strangers.

MASTER A POSE
Ever notice that a lot of Instagram inﬂuencers seem 
to have a signature pose? That’s because they’ve 
gone through the trouble of ﬁnding the angles and 
poses that best suit them. Whether it’s a raised 
eyebrow, duck lips, or a cheeky smile, adding a 
common theme to your signature pose will help give 
your photos a shared identity.

IFA 2017 dazzles attendees yet again
Big On 
Innovation

COVER STORY
he annual technology trade show 
and innovation powerhouse, IFA 
2017 attracted more than 253,000 
visitors to Berlin, Germany this 
year. The power of innovation and brands 
yet again turned the event into the world’s 
most important tradeshow for consumer 
electronics and home appliances – a 
much anticipated event for many tech 
enthusiasts across the globe. 
With more than half of all trade 
visitors coming from abroad, IFA 
Berlin provided a huge boost for both 
manufacturers and retailers in the crucial 
run-up to the holiday period, which runs 
from Thanksgiving in the United States all 
the way to Christmas and the New Year. 
The event was operating at full 
capacity, with 1,805 exhibitors showing 
their latest products and services on 
159,000 square meters of fully booked 
show floor at Messe Berlin. The mood 
among exhibitors was highly optimistic, 
not least given the expected order volume 
of €4.7 billion (bn) achieved during the six 
days of the event. 
Once again, IFA 2017 demonstrated 
that it is a key driving force for both 
brands and retailers. It was also a 
showcase for numerous innovations and 
product launches, which demonstrates 
that “IFA is and remains the ideal 
meeting place and market place for trade 
and industry," said Hans-Joachim Kamp, 
Chairman of the Supervisory Board of 
the IFA organizer, gfu Consumer & Home 
Electronics GmbH.
“IFA has strengthened its role as the 
world's most important trade show in this 
anniversary year, with the tenth edition of 
Home Appliances@IFA. It just shows the 
extraordinary contribution of the event to 
the expected positive development in the 
global market for domestic appliances," 
said Dr. Reinhard Zinkann, Chairman 
of the ZVEI Association for Electric 
Appliances and CECED Presidenzt.
"By bringing together the world´s 
great innovators, brands, technologies, 
products, entrepreneurs and media all 
in one place, IFA is the most efficient 
platform to tell your story worldwide 
– whether you are a start-up or a long-
established brand," said Dr. Christian 
Göke, CEO of Messe Berlin. “We are 
extremely happy with the enthusiasm 
and energy shown by all our exhibitors."

LG Electronics: 
Display Parade 
LG Electronics (LG) introduced two new 
gaming monitors at IFA to meet the needs 
of the burgeoning gamer consumer base 
even better and to deliver some of the 
smoothest gaming experiences possible. 
Its newest 32- and 27-inch GK monitors 
not only offer action enthusiasts a visually 
stunning experience but deliver a winning 
edge in competitive gaming as well.
The GK gaming series implements the 
latest technological breakthroughs, namely 
high refresh rates of 144Hz (overclockable 
to 165Hz) and 240Hz. The 32-inch gaming 
monitor (32GK850G) is the ideal display 
for game enthusiasts who want seamless, 
quick motion gameplay on large screens 
with high picture quality. Featuring fast 
refresh rate, it delivers incredibly fluid 
graphic motion while its NVIDIA G-Sync 
graphic processing technology eliminates 
stuttering and screen tearing when in 
the heat of the action. This monitor will 
handily process all game genres without 
any afterimages while delivering rapid and 
fluid motion at a maximum brightness of 
350 nits on its QHD (2,560 x 1,440) screen.
The 32-inch monitor also enhances 
the gaming experience in a distinct 
way with Sphere Lighting, which uses 
LEDs behind the monitor to create 
soft ambience lighting. 
As for the27-inch GK monitor 
(27GK750F), it also delivers incredibly 
smooth gameplay with the highest refresh 
rate and the fastest response time. The 
more compact monitor is designed to take 
on all gaming needs with enhancements 
to improve the player’s chances of willing, 
such as 240Hz refresh rate, 1ms Motion Blur 
Reduction and AMD FreeSyn technology. 
Features such as Black Stabiliser, Dynamic 
Action Sync and Crosshair – which places 
a target in the centre of the monitor in order 
to enhance accuracy in FPS games – are 
designed to make the gaming experience 
second to none.
The brand also showcased its 
stunning 34-inch UltraWide gaming monitor 
(model 34UC89G) with its expansive 
21:9 aspect ratio display to maximize the 
gaming experience. The immersive effect is 
most evident in racing, RTS or AOS games 
which support 21:9 aspect ratio.
Alongside its gaming displays, LG 
also announces its much-anticipated 
V30 smartphone. The device created 
strong interest at this year’s IFA 2017, 
winning 26 awards, the most for LG at 
the annual trade show. 
To 
best 
deliver 
consumers’ 
preference for big screens in small bodies, 
LG engineers squeezed a 6-inch, 18:9 
FullVision display into a frame that is 
8mm shorter and 3mm narrower than its 
predecessor. Sheathed front and back in 
tempered glass that curls around its edges, 
the V30 won accolades for its exquisite 
look and feel. Weighing in at only 158g, the 
V30 is the lightest smartphone in the 6-inch 
and over smartphone category.

Strobist technique in food photography
Food For ThoughT
T
here has been a growing interest in strobist technique amongst photographers. This is a technique that uses external flash 
with off-shoe flash that is not attached to the body of the camera. It is controlled by radio signal or infrared as a trigger to 
operate the flash.
In various genres of photography, many photographers utilise the external flash to produce better images. Instagram 
and other social media platforms can display beautiful images of food photography. However, many rely on natural or available light 
and that is one of the drawbacks of strobist. Therefore, the photographer must be able to manage the time and location effectively 
in shooting food photography.
There are many benefits of using the strobist technique for food photography. This includes better mobility, efficiency and even 
image quality. The strobist-style type of flash uses battery as the main power, enabling photographers to shoot anywhere without 
the need of an electric outlet.

Strobist technique is ideal for food photography. The light temperature that is produced by the 
external flash is not as high as others. Hence, the texture of the dish will not be affected. Most 
of the time, the higher lighting temperature can alter the physical attributes of the food such as 
the texture. Another benefit is that it is applicable to any type of food. Photographers adopting 
this technique need experience and full understanding in basic photography in order to adjust 
the light to tailor every dish.
Using strobist technique to shoot beverages is not as similar as in food photography. It 
requires extra attention to the amount of light since it can change the colour of the drinks or the 
details of the glass. These will also occur when we do not pair the right accessories with the 
flash. Now I will give you more tips and tricks to use external flash in food photography. 
The advantages in using external flash:
1. Comes with portable and simple design that can be carried in bulk.
2. Uses battery as the main power. No need to worry if the location does not have 
any power outlets.
3. Has lower flash temperature compared to the studio lighting that may not suitable 
for cold dishes
4. Short flash duration can freeze moving object.
5. Able to produce real colour of the object when other lights interfere. For example: 
the room lighting, etc.
6. The accessories in studio lighting equipment can be adopted to our flash if we have 
appropriate flash adapter.

“Strobist is a technique 
that uses handy and simple 
equipment to achieve 
better photos.”
Tips in food photography:
1. White balance and correct colour 
accuracy speaks a lot about the 
dish we captured. Incorrect white 
balance may affect how appetising 
the picture looks.
2. Lighting in food photography differs 
from other types of photography. 
It implements backlighting as the 
main light. We place the light 
behind the object or a little above 
it. When we do this, it will produce 
better texture details.
3. Use the good quality of flash such as 
Canon Speedlite, because it has better 
temperature and other great features.
4. Set the good composition so 
that the POI (Point of Interest) is 
focused on the dish.
In conclusion, strobist is a technique 
that uses handy and simple equipment to 
achieve better photos. You only need to 
be creative and practise more to master 
this technique. Initially, use one flash to 
start. When you are getting familiar with 
it, you can add more elements. Learn 
its characteristic and the accessories 
that can be paired with to produce 
desired effects. External flash in food 
photography affects the details, colour, 
and dimension of the image produced. 
My last tip: your photo is not good if it 
does not elevate one’s appetite.

An ‘Explosive’ Entrance
Samsung Galaxy Note8
Monkey See, Monkey Do
The location of the fingerprint 
scanner is still a design feature that 
irks many. Although it does give 
balance alongside the rear cameras 
and LED flash, its positioning still 
takes some getting used to.
Bluetooth 5.0
Much like the Galaxy S8 and 
S8+, the Note8 comes with 
Bluetooth 5.0, which promises 
double the range and double 
the transfer speed.
Samsung’s Return to Glory
After a disastrous 2016 with the Galaxy 
Note 7, Samsung is looking to put the 
past behind them and have done so in 
spectacular fashion with the Galaxy Note8. 
Featuring an edge-to-edge display with 
state-of-the-art features, Samsung has 
encapsulated what a smartphone needs 
in 2017 and then some. With a price tag 
significantly higher than the Galaxy S8+, 
the Note8 has big shoes to fill and it does 
so very convincingly.
Designed to Impress
The Galaxy Note8 comes with a 6.3-inch 
Quad HD+ Super AMOLED display screen, 
allowing you to reach a maximum screen 
resolution of 2960x1440 (WQHD+.) This 
lets you view more in greater resolution 
and colour reproduction. It even makes 
YouTube videos worth watching as you can 
view it in its original form or fit to screen, 
making full use of its large 18.5:9 aspect 
ratio. Its insanely large screen also makes 
app pairing a breeze, being able to squeeze 
two apps together perfectly while still 
giving enough attention to each of them.
Topping the Charts
With the Exynos 8895 processor alongside 
6GB of RAM, the Galaxy Note8 is a beast 
to work with. Whether it’s breezing through 
social media apps, streaming Spotify and 
YouTube while running Waze or even 
taking down notes in a meeting with the 
audio recorder running, the Note8 is a 
multitasking machine. There have been no 
hiccups in its speed and performance as 
it switches between a multitude of apps 
easily and efficiently.
Write Underwater
While it seems ridiculous to take 
notes underwater because you won’t 
be able to hear anything, the Galaxy 
Note8 alongside the S Pen comes 
with IP68 rating so you can now 
capture images and write down your 
deep thoughts in the shower.
Smudge City
While great to look at from 
afar or in your hands, the glass 
back on the Galaxy Note8 is 
very easily prone to smudging 
so if that vexes you, I’d suggest 
investing in a good cover.

Two Times the Fun
The first of the Note series to feature 
dual cameras at the rear, the Galaxy 
Note8 is one of the top contenders in its 
photo-taking skills. A feature that utilises 
both the telephoto and wide-angle lens 
to great effect is its Live Focus feature, 
which captures a close-up image of 
your subject as well as a wider shot for 
greater diversity. You can even adjust the 
background blur before and after the image 
is captured to suit your liking.
Still Needs Some Work
Samsung has also upped its game in terms 
of security, introducing three different 
security functions to the Galaxy Note8. 
Aside from its questionable fingerprint 
scanner (placement), the Galaxy Note 8 
also comes with an iris scanner as well 
as facial recognition. If you’re wearing 
glasses or contacts, the iris scanner is a 
hit-and-miss as the results of unlocking 
the device with your eyes fluctuate. As 
for the facial recognition, you must be 
in a brightly-lit room and even then, it 
sometimes doesn’t unlock. 
Almost like a Real Pen
The S Pen is extremely accurate 
when it comes to writing and 
highly sensitive as well. Sadly, 
it’s a bit harder for left-handers to 
use as it requires different finger 
positioning to write effectively.

Canon EOS M6 
Interchangeable Lenses 
You can swap out the lenses based 
on what you are shooting. The 
lenses are compact-sized too!
Flip down the EVF 
The EVF can be flipped out 
in different angles, allowing 
you to see what you're 
shooting, even in heights or 
low on the ground.
Compact Wonderkid
Packs a Punch
The Canon M6 mirrorless is a blend 
between DSLR and compact shooters. For 
its size, it could pass as a slightly chunkier 
point-and-shoot; in fact, the quality of 
the shots closely resembles what a DSLR 
is capable of. At 24.2-megapixels, the 
camera produces very clear, sharp shots 
that picks out details in low light. I admit, 
I was sceptical at first but after looking at 
the quality of shots, I’m convinced it can be 
a more portable alternative to my DSLR.
Fast Focus
With Dual Pixel CMOS AF, the camera's 
focus is very fast, making it ideal for taking 
photos during fast paced events. Although 
it works well in situations with plenty of 
light, as with DSLRs, you might need to 
adjust some settings during low light as 
the autofocus might not always be spot 
on. With 5-axis Digital IS, it helps with 
preventing camera shakes while shooting 
on-the-go. In fact, even shooting on a 
moving vehicle, I was able to get some 
pretty clear shots.
Limit on Lenses
While Canon’s flagship line enjoys a 
myriad variation of EF mount lenses, the M 
series uses EF-M mounts, which has less 
variety. While the lenses itself are smaller 
and lighter, the limited choice means 
sometimes you don’t quite get the exact 
type of shot you are after. For an amateur 
or advanced enthusiast photographer, it 
may be sufficient but for anyone looking 
for more technical level quality, it might 
fall a tiny bit short. The kit lens I’ve got 
with the unit is a 15-45mm lens, which 
does well at scenic shots, but falters a 
bit with moving portraits.

On-the-Go
With Wi-Fi and NFC, transferring files are 
easy. No need for cables or removing SD 
cards anymore – just tap and transfer. 
Especially for those who travel, or work 
on-the-go; cables can be a mess and 
swapping cards can be a bother. I brought 
it with me for an overseas assignment and 
not only did it take up little space in my 
bag, transferring files while shooting a few 
events was quick and easy.
60fps Videos
As most smartphones or cameras out 
there, even some mid-range models, starts 
sporting 4K UHD resolution, it was a tad 
bit curious to the lack thereof in EOS M6. 
Having said that, it shoots 1080p Full HD 
videos at 60fps, making it a smooth playback 
experience with minimal ribbon effect for 
movement shots. The stabilisation function 
also helps, so camera shakes is reduced if 
you are shooting freehand with no tripod.

Much of the Same
Huawei nova 2 Plus
Symmetrical Sensor
The fingerprint scanner sits right 
at the centre of the device.
Cool it Down
In under 10 minutes, 
the nova 2 Plus heats 
up really quickly.
Standing Tall
At 5.5-inches, the nova 2 
Plus is great for videos and 
movies.
Minimal as Possible
Moving away from its high-end devices, 
Huawei has recently released its latest 
mid-range smartphone, the Huawei nova 2 
Plus. Design-wise, the nova 2 Plus borrows 
elements from the honor 8 Pro as well as 
the P10. The metallic unibody comes with a 
matte finish, making it great to have in your 
hands while the indent of the fingerprint 
sensor at the rear a lot shallower compared 
to other devices. There’s also very little 
Huawei branding aside from its logo located 
at the rear of the device at the bottom.
A Bit of Everything
While the P10 boasted dual Leica cameras 
and the honor 8 Pro focused on mobile 
gaming, the nova 2 Plus is just your 
everyday mid-range smartphone. Not 
necessarily a good or bad thing, the nova 2 
Plus stands out by not standing out (if that 
makes any sense). With no outstanding 
features, that also implies that it wouldn’t 
cost an arm and a leg, which is what many 
consumers are looking at. You also get 
128GB of internal storage space, making a 
microSD card useless.
Great for Everyone
Using the nova 2 Plus daily brought out a 
great experience overall. The Kirin 659 
processor had a quick step to it without 
any sort of delay and lag, partially thanks 
to the 4GB of RAM. The EMUI 5.1 OS was 
modelled after Android Nougat 7.0 and 
contained very minimal bloatware, which 
was a nice touch. Multitasking between 
day-to-day social media stalking activities 
like Facebook and Instagram soaked up very 
little of the 3,340mAh battery capacity and 
even when streaming videos, it still holds 
itself up well. Like other smartphones, it 
heats up rather quickly when watching 
videos or using the camera for long periods.

How Hot Are You for Vega?
AMD Radeon RX Vega 64
A High-end Radeon At Last 
We have been waiting for this moment; 
Team Red has finally made a worthy 
high-end graphics card and it is called the 
AMD Radeon RX Vega 64. The 64 stands 
for the 64 compute units in the GPU, and 
paired with 8GB High Bandwidth memory 
(HBM) which has a bandwidth of 484 GB/s. 
That is a lot of data being transferred to 
render your game frames.
Multiple Outputs
You get three DisplayPort 
1.4 and one HDMI 2.0 for 
output – enough ports 
for VR set-ups. 
Stock Cooler Design
As of press time, not many 
third-party designs are available 
for the Vega 64, so the stock 
blower-cooler is used instead.
Full-On Gaming Power
Thanks to the new core, the Vega 64 can 
go toe-to-toe with the GTX 1080 with little 
problem, as most AAA games are rendered 
beautifully with the GPU. Most of the titles 
will give you the coveted 60fps gaming 
with no sweat – this is with the resolution 
at 1440p mind you. Pair this with a suitable 
Freesync monitor and see your games run 
buttery smooth on screen. Plus, this card is 
both 4K and VR-ready.
Big Power Draw
Unfortunately, AMD still need to tweak the 
power curves on the Vega 64. In the manual, 
AMD states that you need at least a 750w 
power supply to run this beast, otherwise 
you will experience system crashes. 
Of course, if your system already has a 
1,000W PSU, this is not a problem per se.

Proper Air Circulation 
Needed
It is advisable that your PC has enough 
airflow in the case as the card we reviewed 
did heat up to the touch after intense use. 
As the Vega 64 is one of the more hotter 
cards in the market right now, ample and 
proper air circulation is needed to ensure 
the card does not reach any thermal limit, 
and experiences throttling. Even so, it is at 
the precipice of heat overload is where the 
Vega shines surprisingly. Unfortunately, not 
many third-party designs are available for 
the Vega 64, so the stock blower-cooler 
is used instead. However, if you're into 
VR games, the Vega 64 comes with three 
DisplayPlay 1.4 and one HDMI 2.0 for output. 
This is more than enough for a VR setup.
Crytocurrency Poster Child
While the card is already on the market 
for quite some time, the pricing is still in 
the upper tiers because of cryptocurrency 
miners. They are flocking to the cards at the 
stores, and snapping them up left and right. 
This is why the prices are still astronomical 
in some places – but expect the sticker 
price to come down relatively soon. 
Powerful and Hot 
It is advisable that your 
PC has enough airflow in 
the case as the card we 
reviewed did heat up to the 
touch after intense use.
Finicky Drivers
The DX11 performance of the 
Vega 64 can still be finicky, 
so be prepared to tweak your 
system to find the right spot.

Nokia 6
Mediocre Mid-ranger
A Disappointing Sibling
Having been impressed by the Nokia 5's 
smooth performance, I was expecting 
good things from Nokia. Alas, compared 
to its smaller sibling, the Nokia 6 is 
rather disappointing. Despite running a 
Snapdragon 600 series chip set, compared 
to the 400 series that Nokia 5 was running, 
the performance of the 6 seems to be a tad 
bit slower and less responsive compared 
to the 5. On its own it works pretty well, 
holding up to some abuse from running 
multiple 
applications 
and 
switching 
between apps. I can't help but compare it 
with the 5, which was marketed as an entry 
level device, and feel a bit bummed.
Performance Dragging
If you are running single applications, it 
works perfectly fine. Any prolong use, 
or multitasking and the phone does lag 
significantly. Connections on the phone 
is fast - whether data network or GPS 
signals. However, if you are running several 
applications, and jam it with a few more 
games, it will very slowly give up. On the 
plus side though, the phone doesn't heat 
up as easily as other phones on the market. 
Even when it feels slightly hot, it cools 
down very quickly. When comparing with 
other sub RM1,000 phones in the market, 
though, the Nokia 6 stands out pretty well.
Shooter is the Saving Grace
One thing it does trump over the 5 though, 
is the camera. With a 16-megapixel 
camera, the camera shoots clear, detailed 
photos that works decently in low light. 
While it does take some time for the 
focus to get the right subject, the picture 
quality is impressive. While the colour 
does falter a bit in low light, it still holds up 
decently, with details captured clearly. The 
camera itself doesn't come with as much 
gimmicky functions as well, so it's just 
standard app, which works.
Simplicity
From the use of stock Android 
to its camera app - all the 
functions are basic and non 
gimmicky - it just works.
Sharp Edges
Unlike the Nokia 5, the Nokia 
6 sports sharp corners, making 
it less comfortable to hold 
compared to its cheaper siblings.

While the Nokia 5 was built to be very slim, slick and

design has some edge, not a rounded grip we see in both 
the 5 and the recently launched 8. With the 5.5-inch screen 
HD display, watching videos or playing games on the screen 
is a pleasure. The visuals are crisp and clear. Although if 
compared to the Nokia 8, which I happen to have one at 
the same time, the colours are less vivid. Of course, being a 
mid-range, it wouldn't quite compete with flagships; it does 
have very good display when compared to other phones in

Affordable NAS Performance
The Synology DiskStation DS418j is a 
budget-friendly 4-bay NAS server designed 
for the home or small business user who 
likes to keep a lot of data on tap or requires 
a centralised storage with backup for a 
handful of users. Sporting a new 64-bit 
Realtek dual-core processor at 1.4GHz, 
1GB of DDR4 RAM which allows for a 
whopping 40TB of raw storage in a single 
volume. Synology claims the DS418j has 
a read speed of 112MB/s and write at 
87MB/s in a RAID 5 configuration on a 
Windows machine. This makes for more 
than adequate speed for the home and 
small business user. The case also has a 
single RJ-45 1GbE LAN port and a pair of 
USB3.0 sockets with support for wireless 
access via a dongle.
Simple and Robust 
Architecture
The DS418j operates on DiskStation 
Manager 6.1, the operating system that 
you’ll find across all of Synology’s products. 
You’ll be able to customise your NAS to your 
preference by installing apps to manage 
different aspects of your NAS such as media 
streaming, remote file access and seamless 
integration with your mobile devices. Other 
features include a surveillance solution, 
desktop backup and a full featured file 
management and sharing service. The 
initial setup and configuration of the NAS 
were easily done through the platform.
Effortless Setup
This particular DS418j was configured with 
two Western Digital 10TB Red NAS 3.5-
inch hard disk drives. Set up was a breeze 
with the total time taken from installation 
of drives to having a fully running NAS 
on a RAID 1 setup was under an hour. It’s 
automated RAID management system via 
Synology Hybrid RAID allows novice users 
easier management of your raid so tasks 
such as upscaling and volume management 
effortless. Paired with the mobile apps like 
DS Audio, DS Photo and DS Video, it was 
possible for me to consolidate all my data 
into one central server.

With the numpad excluded, this

If you worry about pressing the wrong keys at the wrong

True Gaming Essence
Another popular gaming brand that needs 
no introduction, Logitech has found itself 
being a household name in the gaming 
peripherals industry. Take the Logitech 
G Pro gaming keyboard for example. Its 
hard plastic body coated in black features 
only the core essentials of the keyboard, 
leaving out the numpad entirely. Unless 
you’re an accountant and a gamer (my hats 
off to you good sir), it’s highly unlikely you 
will find use for the numpad. It’s like how 
Malaysians view the turn signal; we know 
it’s there but we never actually use it.
Doesn’t Taste like Cherry
Keyboard aficionados would almost always 
swear by their Cherry MX switches. The 
same can’t be said when it comes to 
Logitech gaming keyboards. The G Pro 
features Logitech’s very own Romer-G 
mechanical switches with a lifespan of 
up to 70 million clicks. Oddly enough, the 
switches on the Logitech G Pro reminds me 
of the Cherry MX Brown switches, from the 
slightly audible click to having a soft tactile 
feedback. This was slightly infuriating 
as I kept thinking it’s actual Cherry MX 
switches, only to realise it wasn’t.
Multi-functional Cable
The braided USB 2.0 cable for the Logitech 
G Pro measures six feet long and can be 
easily detached to ensure it stays up to 
par when you’re on-the-go. Suited for 
professional gamers who are constantly 
moving from different tournaments, the 
micro USB connector comes with a three-
pronged design to give it added durability 
while it’s easy detachment makes it 
easy to setup. A plus point for the USB 
cable is its versatility; if you’re using the 
Logitech G900 or G403 wireless gaming 
mouse, you can easily hook them up to the 
cable and charge away.

Razer Lancehead Gaming Mouse

VERDICT: 
“The Razer Lancehead is one of the better gaming mice to come out of Razer 
with the focus on its ambidextrous design and wireless features.” - Wi-Liam 
Lefties Rejoice
Boasting an ambidextrous design, the Razer 
Lancehead is designed for all gamers. Its 
symmetrical with rubber grips on both sides 
of its body for a more comfortable thumb 
and pinky grip. Located above both rubber 
grips are the forward and back buttons. 
This is the first gaming mouse that provides 
100% accommodation to both left- and 
right-handed gamers. As a proud owner of 
the Razer DeathAdder, the Lancehead does 
give it a run for its money. If I wasn’t a loyal 
supporter, I would gladly switch over.
Comfort is Key
The Lancehead is great for all sorts of 
gamer types. The main left- and right-click 
buttons comes with a deeper click space, 
great for claw-type gamers. The rubber 
sides are also long enough to accommodate 
both the palm- and fingertip-gamer easily. 
I’ve tried and tested all three types of 
games like Dota 2 and PlayerUnknown’s 
Battlegrounds. I have yet to have any strain 
on my fingers, palm or wrist.
Wired or Wireless?
This has been a hotly contested debate for 
a very long time and Razer has decided to 
put an end to it all with a gaming mouse 
that can do both extremely well. To use 
it wirelessly, the Lancehead comes with 
a 2.4GHz dongle known as Adaptive 
Frequency Technology. This helps to 
manage the wireless connection of the 
Lancehead and it does the job well as I’ve 
used both versions when gaming and there 
is literally no difference in performance. 
Colour in Sync
If you have more than one 
Razer peripheral with the 
Razer Chroma feature, 
you can sync them 
together through Razer 
Synapse programme. 
DPI on-the-fly
Most gaming mice in 
the market feature DPI 
settings up to 12,000 but 
the Lancehead comes with 
up to 16,000. Why anyone 
would want 16,000 DPI 
setting is beyond me.

Designed for Shock & Awe
While most would prefer building their own 
desktop PC, Acer introduces the Aspire GX-
281 for those who would prefer a hassle-
free system that comes with pre-installed 
components at a set price. While RM5,499 
isn’t something to laugh about, the Aspire 
GX-281 does a fine job in making it a well-
rounded device with the help of AMD’s 
latest offerings: the AMD Ryzen 7 1700X 
alongside the AMD Radeon RX480.
Bounce in its Step
The result of the Aspire GX-281 was 
surprising; it breezed through various 
programs and most games with ease. 
Dota 2, Overwatch and PlayerUnknown’s 
Battlegrounds were running smoothly 
with 60 to 70 fps with barely any hiccups. 
Even keeping multiple programs open at 
once didn’t hinder its performance at the 
slightest. One downside of the Aspire 
GX-281 was its size; although only a mid-
tower, it was larger as compared to others 
in the same size bracket. For those looking 
for overcompensation, this is the perfect 
one for you.
Great Value for Money
Considering the current market price of 
both the Ryzen 7 1700X and Radeon RX480 
amounting to almost RM4,000, Acer Aspire 
gives you great value for money with the 
Aspire GX-281. That isn’t even including 
RAM cards, HDD and SSD storage and 
even the operating system. For RM5,499, 
the Aspire GX-281 is a good enough deal 
if you couldn’t be bothered with doing 
extensive research on building your own 
rig. 
The Iconic “Bred” 
Colourway
Taking a page out of many other 
Taiwanese gaming companies, 
the Aspire-GX281 comes in an 
all-black base with red accents 
along its side ventilation panels 
and at the front, which glows 
when turned on.
Larger than Expected
Its rather large footprint means the 
Aspire GX-281 requires more table 
space than most so you might want 
to make some space, especially if 
you don’t want it on the floor.

by them. While I am a fan of all things flashy 
every now and then, Razer does a great job 
in keeping the Tiamat 2.2 different from its 
counterpart, the Tiamat 7.1 V2.
Built for Comfort and 
Precision
The Tiamat 2.2 V2 is undeniably comfortable. 
Its plush leather ear cushions kept my ears 
from getting ho. A bonus is its weight 
distribution. You barely feel the weight on 
your ears nor that annoying constricting 
feeling around your head. It also comes 
with a retractable microphone located on 
the left ear cup. Simply flip it downwards 
and you're good to go. Not particularly 
great, the mic does get the job done.
I Have No Social Life
Gaming with the Tiamat 2.2 V2 is a dream. 
Being able to detect where Bounty Hunter 
was just as he casted Shadow Walk gave 
me all the information I needed; knowing 
where Monkey King was hoping around 
from tree to tree allowed me to cut down 
the trees and kill him, which led to him 
calling me every name under the sun. If 
that’s not enough to convince you, I could 
pick out the sound of Mirana’s arrow casted 
from fog and being able to dodge it and 
survive, all the while tuning out the sound 
of my teammates shouting gibberish in my 
ears. Oh, the whims and woes of Dota 2.

HP Sprocket Photo Printer

VERDICT: 
“If you can get past its price tag, the HP Sprocket is a great and 
reliable portable photo printer.” - Wi-Liam 
Print Your Memories
These days, people are using their 
smartphones to capture their memories 
and upload them onto social media. But 
what if you wanted to print them? That is 
where the HP Sprocket Printer comes in 
handy. Easily the size of your palm, you can 
now bring the Sprocket with you anywhere 
without it being a burden. Connecting it 
to your smartphone is also easy with the 
Sprocket app. Just connect via Bluetooth 
and you're good to go.
In No Time at All
What's great about the Sprocket is the 
speed of which it prints your pictures. 
Although it only prints them in 2x3 inches, 
you can easily peel off the back and stick the 
pictures anywhere. The colour reproduction 
on the Sprocket is pretty average though 
so its best to not get the same amount of 
quality as your smartphoneYou also get 
20 sheets of paper per pack at only RM40, 
which doesn't sound all that bad. Through 
the Sprocket app, you can even customise 
and edit your pictures to give them some 
added flair and creativity. You can even 
take pictures you've already uploaded onto 
Facebook and Instagram and print them 
instantly.
A Worthy Investment?
One downside of the Sprocket is its price 
tag. At RM599, not everyone will be 
convinced it will be a worthy investment. 
Sure, there will be people who will want to 
print their pictures from their smartphone 
instantly, and there will be some who would 
rather just have said pictures uploaded onto 
their Instagram and Facebook accounts. For 
me personally, it is a rather steep price to 
pay for a printer. But, if you're into having 
a physical copy of your pictures and being 
able to let your creative juices flow through 
the app, it is a great new way of keeping 
your memories.

VERDICT: 
“If you are an active person looking for a good pair of earphones 
that will move with you, you've got it.” - Satoko
Simple, Portable
The setup couldn't be easier - turn it on, and 
pair with any Bluetooth enabled devices. 
Simple! Being wireless, you could walk 
around anywhere without worrying about 
getting tangled with wires. It's perfect for 
when you want to do some movement 
intensive activities. Some issues might crop 
up though, if you wander too far away from 
the paired device and walk within proximity 
again. The device might not automatically 
pair with the headphones, so you might 
have to press some buttons again for the 
headphones to work properly. Having handy 
buttons along the wire means answering 
calls and adjusting volume control is just 
a breath away (literally). Although the 
buttons are a bit stiff though.
Sorry, What?
The earbuds are very good for cancelling 
outside noises. The sound quality might 
not be top notch, but for daily use of taking 
phone calls, watching videos and listening 
to music; it works like a dream. The noise 
isolation function means you can focus on 
your task at hand without getting distracted. 
The earphones come with outdoor and 
indoor modes - so you can get some extra 
bass while you're out-and-about. Besides, 
the design of it means the headphones sits 
snugly around your neck, without slipping; 
making it ideal for movement intensive 
activities. The box comes with extra 
earbuds of four different sizes, so you can 
choose which on fits most comfortably.
Hmm...I Can't Hear
While there weren’t any issues with pairing 
with all three laptops that I was testing 
with, I found that the headphones won't 
play media from my phone. I could take 
calls, listen to navigation; but I couldn't 
listen to music from my Spotify or my 
music player at all. My phone screen will 
show the media playing, but I will not be 
able to hear any media sounds from the 
headphones at all. This could be an issue 
with compatibility with older phones. 
Access Granted
Easy access buttons for 
playing music, taking 
calls and switching

It does have a background

quite loud and distracting, 
if you aren't playing any

I've always been a fan of Sennheisers, and 
the Momentum In Ear once again doesn't 
disappoint. I do listen to music with a 
fair bit more bass and do prefer when my 
headphones can give me the satisfaction. 
The Momentum In Ear gives wonderful 
clear audio, strong base, clear trebles and 
an all-round joyous music experience. The 
mid-levels might suffer slightly, but it's 
overall solid in terms of sound quality.
Comfort
The design of the headphones are made 
to fit comfortably. Unlike some earphones 
that tends to hurt after prolonged usage, I 
can comfortably wear these all day while 
working or travelling without feeling it. 
It comes with ear buds of different sizes 
too, so you can choose which fit is most 
comfortable. Being really lightweight, it's 
suited for travelling; additionally, the long 
wire means you aren't constricted either if 
your phone is in the bag or on a pouch.
Cancel out the world
The design of the headphones also isolates 
your surroundings, ideal for moments when 
you need to focus and cut off distractions.  
There's also a 3-button multifunctional 
remote to the side, allowing you to easily 
adjust volume, take calls and play music 
without adjusting settings on your phone 
or laptop. Curiously, the Momentum In Ear 
comes in an iOS version and an Android

and it works perfectly across all platforms

The OnePlus 5 comes equipped with the 
latest in smartphone hardware. Qualcomm’s 
Snapdragon 835 beats at the heart of the 
device with a base mode of 6GB of RAM 
and 64 GB of internal storage. Sadly, 
OnePlus has omitted the use of MicroSD 
cards, which may force some customers 
to purchase the higher end model of 8GB 
of RAM and 128GB of storage space. On 
the plus side, the OS is the latest Android

Optimum Flow
The Cooler Master MasterLiquid Pro 240 is 
an updated AIO liquid cooling solution part 
of their Master/Maker series. Now sporting 
a newer pump design with two separate 
chambers, the MasterLiquid Pro 240 looks 
a lot beefier than its predecessor with 
long-lasting FEP tubing, square fin designed 
radiator and a water block that thankfully, 
will support the newer AM4 sockets with a 
free upgrade kit. There is a strong emphasis 
on lifespan; the Masterliquid Pro 240 has 
a MTTF of 175,000 hours and a L-10 life 
of 50,000 hours. All this revolves around 
what Cooler Master calls its FlowOp 
technology, which optimises the flow of 
liquid to carry heat quickly and efficiently 
away from the CPU while still preserving 
the lifespan of the components.
Install and Let Go
Installation 
of 
the 
cooler 
was 
straightforward, 
with 
most 
sockets 
requiring a universal metal backplate, 
which allows screws to be passed through 
and locked in place with clips. This isn’t the 
best way to do it and I personally fiddled 
around a bit before getting it right. If you’re 
a LGA2011(v3) socket user however, you’re 
in luck as the screws mount directly onto 
the motherboard, not a backplate. Cooler 
Master’s new MasterFan Pro 120 Air 
Balance fans are bundled together with 
this liquid cooler and are designed to strike 
a good balance between airflow and static 
pressure. A rubber gasket is provided for 
extra vibration, dampening and protection 
for the radiator. As an AIO liquid cooler, 
this is an easy fire-and-forget experience 
for users who don’t want to fiddle with a 
cooler too much.
Silent but Average
This unit was mounted onto a LGA1151 
socket with a front mount configuration 
inside a Cooler MasterCase Maker 5t. 
Performance-wise, the MasterLiquid Pro 
240 isn’t the best in world but it does the 
job well enough that you’re not really left 
wanting better cooling. Where this liquid 
cooler shine is how silent it runs under 
normal load and only during full power 
does the sound become noticeable. For 
those worried about not having enough 
performance, there’s a tiny switch mounted 
on the fans that allow you to unleash it's true 
full speeds, but with an increase in noise.

Curvaceous Display
LG 34" 144Hz IPS 21:9 UltraWide Gaming 
Monitor (34UC79G-B)
Wide & Stable
The monitor is quite sturdy and 
stable, despite its size and curved 
display. Chances of it falling over 
is low, thanks to its heavy base. 
External Needed
It does not come with a built-in 
speaker, which is a shame. 
That said, the port layout 
would be different if it did.
An Eagle’s Eye View 
LG has always been known for its displays, 
from monitors to TVs. Thanks to its IPS panel 
technology, The LG 34-inch 144Hz IPS 21:9 
UltraWide Gaming Monitor (34UC79G-B) 
delivers true-to-life colours with amazing 
contrast and detail. Despite being an 
ultrawide monitor, the picture quality 
remained consistently sharp at any angle. 
Easy Access 
This particular gaming display does not 
swivel like many in the market, but it 
does give users the ability to adjust the 
vertical height and tilt angle. The one thing 
I appreciate about the 34UC79G-B is the 
fact that all the ports are easily accessible 
on the back panel. A number of gaming 
monitors I’ve tested had them facing 
downwards at an awkward angle. The 
34UC79G-B eliminated the need for you to 
tilt your head awkwardly to find where the 
ports are located. 
Not for All
Do bear in mind that not all games and 
machines natively support the 21:9 
resolution, such as the Sony PlayStation 
4 Pro.  So you may have to deal with the 
pillar boxes on both sides. The 34UC79G-B 
also supports 144HZ refresh rate – games 
run smoothly without taking much GPU 
power. That said, if you’re running an AMD 
GPU, you’ll stand to benefit more from the 
monitor’s AMD FreeSync feature.

Just 2K
For a 2K monitor, the 34UC79G-B is pricier 
than most gaming monitors offerings out 
there, sans the curved panel, of course. 
That said, when you are comparing the LG 
to its rivals in the curved monitor sphere, 
it loses in terms of value. Just for top-up 
a few hundred Ringgit and you can get 
yourself a 4K curved gaming monitor - of 
the same size and similar features - from 
another brand. The latter is also well-known 
for its gamer-centric offerings. (Hint: We 
reviewed it back in our April 2017 issue). 
No Audio
The 34UC79G-B sounds like a dream for 
those wanting smooth gameplay - thanks 
to its high refresh rate. I would have loved 
to see LG incorporating a built-in speaker in 
its curved gaming monitor. This is, however, 
personal preference. Most gamers would 
prefer plugging in their own headphones. 
That said, the audio-in jack is located at the 
back panel with all the other ports - quite 
awkward to plug in and out of.

The ports are easily accessible; 
I didn't have to guess where 
each of them are located.

RGB Overload
There has been a craze about RGB-

addition to the exhaustive list of RGB-ready 
components is the power supply, specially 
the Thermaltake Smart Pro RGB 650W.
Not a Fan
We were quite interested to see what 
kind of RGB does this PSU offer, but we 
were quickly disappointed. The Smart 
Pro has one RGB equipped fan, and that’s 
about it. It’s not controllable and you can 
only cycle through 5 colour modes. So, 
if you had wanted to combine the PSU 
with your existing RGB ecosystem…
bad news, you can’t. 
Practically Speaking…
RGB aside, the Smart Pro PSU is quite a 
decent PSU. The fan is quite silent. You 
can even enable the Smart Zero Fan, which 
turns off the fan when the PSU is not under 
load. Since it’s modular, cable management 
is a breeze. It also offers flat connector 
cable, where they can be flushed against 
the casing. Rated at 80 Bronze, the PSU is 
made to be efficient, so don’t let the pretty 
colours make you think otherwise.

most of my work, Chromebooks serves 
me very well. Offline Chromebooks aren't 
very useful, though. While you can edit

lightweight and extremely portable, you 
can use it like a regular laptop or like a 
tablet. It is touchscreen enabled, so you can 
easily make annotations, or easily gesture 
the screen to perform some function. 
The device is smart enough to configure 
the screen according to your usage. If 
you choose to flip the keyboard down for 
watching movies, or inverting it to use it as 
a tablet during presentation, the screen will 
change accordingly. The interface is also 
very intuitive, with not much difference 
from a connected smart device.
Work All Day
This is one fast machine, that lasts all day. 
Loading up apps take nearly no time at all. 
The Acer Chromebook R11 runs Android 
apps too, making it really convenient to 
work seamlessly across different devices 
and platforms. Although certain apps will 
have compatibility issues, and might crash 
or not function properly, most that we use 
for work runs like a dream. It does take 
some getting used to, since I am more 
used to Windows OS. After a few hours of 
fiddling around though, I definitely prefer 
working on this compared to my chunky 
laptop - as long as I'm connected, that is.

SHOWDOWN
Are you sick and tired of having an inadequate home Wi-Fi

how you can eliminate that problem
Building a

P
oor wireless connection is often 
one of the biggest complaints a 
user has. Sadly, solutions to the 
problem have been elusive with 
range extenders and multiple Wi-Fi routers 
or access points providing some relief to 
this issue. Essentially a short-term solution 
to a long-term problem, such solutions are 
spotty at best. However, there have been 
recent developments in Wi-Fi technology 
that will eradicate this problem. 
Known as Mesh Wi-Fi or whole 
home Wi-Fi, Mesh brings with it the 
promise of banishing these Wi-Fi gremlins 
and blanketing your home in a wireless 
web. Although the first few Mesh systems 
were from start-ups and non-traditional 
brands, this has now changed with the 
likes of ASUS, Google, Linksys, Netgear 
and TP-Link entering the fray.
So how does Mesh work and what 
makes it different? Mesh wireless systems 
use parts of its wireless networks to talk to 
each station or node and uses an intelligent 
algorithm to ensure optimum connection. 
These Mesh systems are designed from 
the ground up to be consumer friendly, 
unlike traditional networking products 
which, despite its advances in UI and 
UX, still daunts many consumers. For this 
month’s Showdown, we look at three 
prominent systems and put them to the 
test against one another along with the 
range extender traditional systems. 
The showdown will compare Cost 
and design, Setup and Performance.

Range extenders portray oversized wall 
sockets, some of which come with 
external antennas. Meanwhile, the Mesh 
systems look nothing like the conventional 
router or range extender but rather, it looks 
more like high-tech audiovisual equipment 
or art pieces. There are no complicated 
buttons, switches or lights and knobs that 
one could be confused with.
Of the lot, Netgear’s Orbi was the 
first among the three to be launched with 
a router and satellite combination. While 
looking the same, the key difference lies 
in the internet port, which can be found 
on the router and not the satellite unit. 
The Orbi is also the largest unit among 
the three. However, its size isn’t because 
of overcompensation purposes. Quite the 
contrary, the Orbi is chock full of features 
compared to the other two. Featuring more 
than two LAN ports (three on the router 
and four on the satellite), it also comes 
with a USB port.
Linksys’ Velop was launched at CES 
2016 and received great praise, which then 
developed into a strong following around 
the world. One downside, it is not officially 
available here so you would have to head 
down south to get your hands on one. The 
design is minimalistic with all three routers 
in the Velop system sharing identical looks, 
making it interchangeable. The top as well 
as both sides of each router is perforated, 
allowing heat to dissipate quickly. To add 
to its minimalistic factor, a single LED light 
located at the top of the routers give an 
indication that it’s in operation. A plus 
point would be its installation process; the 
network and power cable can neatly slot 
into the Velop via a small gap at the base. 
In terms of connectivity, the Velop only 
comes with two LAN ports.
ASUS’ Lyra is the newest addition 
of the three. Like the Velop, all three 
routers in the Lyra system are identical 
and interchangeable as well as having 
only two LAN ports. Loosely resembling 
a sophisticated smoke detector, the Lyra’s 
Cost and Design
dish-shaped design and size allows it to 
be the only unit that can be wall-mounted. 
Among the three, both the Lyra and the 
Velop were the most aesthetically pleasing 
to the eye. In the end, the Lyra edges out 
a victory, which is mainly due to its wall-
mounting capability.
Traditional range extenders are the 
cheapest of the lot to acquire. Costing 
between RM50 to RM500 depending on 
specifications, the Orbi, Lyra and Velop 
come with a hefty price tag. The reason 
for the stark difference between price tags 
will be made clear once we evaluate the 
performance and technology.

Range extenders usually require web 
browsers during installation and setup 
but the newest ones can be done via 
smartphones. Even setup was limited 
and would likely consist of changing the 
name and password. This time around, 
all three systems follow the most basic 
of steps:
 1. Connect to the network of the system
 2. Open the app
 3. Follow on-screen instructions and be 
connected in minutes.
The Orbi, Velop and Lyra comes with 
its own smartphone app, all of which 
UI/UX & Setup
are available on both Android and iOS 
devices. The common similarity between 
these three devices is that it will utilise 
only one network name and the system 
decides which is the best connection 
type for the devices. Some may find this 
jarring as they will have to leave their 
connectivity decisions to the algorithms 
in the brains of the system. Despite the 
network ports on all three systems, its 
main purpose is to serve as companion 
systems to the main router. However, 
ASUS has since given us an update about 
a firmware update to the Lyra, which will 
enable it to replace your UniFi router.
A great feature in both the Lyra 
and Velop is the ability to access its 
systems from outside the network. This 
is a convenient function which will allow 
users to see what is happening to their 
networks when they’re not home. All 
three apps will show you exactly how 
many devices are connected to the Wi-Fi 
while the ability to change Wi-Fi names 
and passwords on-the-fly are impressive. 
After having a go at all three systems with 
its apps, Linksys’ Velop easily had the 
most intuitive setup and app interface.

Mesh networks have been touted to 
eliminate the troubles of sorting out 
different names for different bands 
while allowing the network to remain 
connected. All that is needed is one Wi-
Fi SSID. This will allow you to use your 
Wi-Fi wherever you are in your house 
without worrying about a dropped signal.
To put them to the test, we used 
one notebook and an MU-MiMO adapter 
to demonstrate the roaming and single 
SSID. The test included downloading a 
10GB file over the network and onto the 
notebook while watching a 4K video over 
YouTube. This was coupled with covering 
every area of the house on every floor 
where the coverage would have to switch 
to the satellite or nodes for connectivity.
Performance
The range extender would not hand 
over as it always stuck to the router 
and vice versa. The file copy and video 
streams would also stop once the router 
or range extender was out of range. 
When connected to the range extender, 
the transfer speeds would be almost half 
of the connection of the main router.
All three systems have performed 
the functions of the Mesh as described 
to a tee. The biggest disadvantage: the 
fluctuating file transfer speeds when 
move from main to node. The Lyra had 
the greatest instabilities in speeds, 
which is then closely followed up by the 
Orbi. The Velop on the other hand, had 
the lowest deviations in transfer speeds.
85
OCT 2017

CONCLUSION
If you want to cover your entire home in Wi-Fi, any one of these systems would get the job done well. Despite the Velop being the 
clear winner, we had to disqualify it mainly because it isn’t officially available in Malaysia. It is available in Singapore, though. 
 With that said, the Orbi is the more practical choice with its multiple LAN ports alongside the USB port. The Lyra also deserves 
a special mention for its flexibility of having three in the package, which is almost the same price as the Orbi (whose third node is 
used for coverage.) More and more of these systems will be made available soon so having bad Wi-Fi at home will soon become 
a thing of the past.

Canon revolutionises commercial digital printing
Unleashing Greatness
I
t’s undeniable that digital technology 
changes the competitive landscape 
of the commercial printing market, 
and companies who fall behind in 
this shift are at risk. Taking the variables 
into consideration, Canon Marketing (M) 
introduces two commercial print line 
devices: the third generation varioPRINT 
DP and imagePRESS product lines. With 
the theme ‘#UnleashPrint - Built for 
Business, Bring It On’, Canon Malaysia 
aims to help customers realise their 
potential, take on new challenges and 
open up new opportunities.
Albert Mah, Head of the Professional 
Printing Products (PPP) Division for Canon 
Marketing (M), explains that the printing 
industry will continue to evolve towards 
digitalisation and that Canon will be there 
to pioneer and revolutionise new markets 
with commercial-use printers to support 
those in the printing industry and beyond.
Both the varioPRINT DP and the 
imagePRESS product line (varioPRINT 
140/130/115 and imagePRESS C850/C750/
Andrew Koh, President and CEO of Canon Marketing (Malaysia) delivers his opening address
C650, respectively) are designed to provide 
the best possible return-on-investment for 
customers, combining time and cost saving 
with revenue generation.
Additionally, Mah also took the 
opportunity to elaborate that the complexity 
is the main reason of print service providers 
(PSPs) moving from their analog devices to 
more productive digital devices. With this 
in mind, the company also introduces its 
Canon PRISMAprepare software controller 
that marries all job functionalities together, 
in order to produce fast high-quality output.
“Regardless if you are printing 
colours or monochrome one at a 
time or simultaneously, our advanced 
PRISMAprepare software makes it easy 
to prepare complex jobs, automate the 
pre-press process and accelerate job 
turnaround,” he shares. 
Albert Mah, Head of Division, Professional Printing Products (PPP), Canon 
Marketing (Malaysia) introduced two commercial print line devices: the third 
generation varioPRINT DP product line (varioPRINT 140/130/115), and the

SPOTLIGHT
PC.COM SPEAKS TO DAMIEN WONG, SENIOR DIRECTOR & GENERAL MANAGER, ASEAN 
AT RED HAT ABOUT OPEN SOURCE-BASED INNOVATIONS
RED HAT: 
PLANNING IS DEAD
By Satoko Omata

93
OCT 2017
C.com: How do you see 
the 
different 
industries 
in Malaysia evolving to 
adopt an agile approach to 
technology?
Damien Wong: Telcos and 5G is a good 
example. For the telcos, 5G is going to 
happen. It’s a matter of time; not if, but 
when it happens. Everyone has been 
talking about the impending move to 5G. 
They are a good example because they are 
a very visible example. The telcos have 
established standards and guidelines; if 
they don’t meet those quality of service 
guidelines they get fined.
As more discussions went on, 
many realised they have to move 
towards network function virtualisation: 
virtualised cloud, virtualised networks. 
And it’s driving them towards software 
defined.
PC.com: How does open source play 
a role in enabling innovations such 
as software defined technologies?
Wong: Open source has become the de 
facto mode for innovation. In fact, all the 
disruptive technologies that we’ve seen 
- including IoT, blockchain - they’ve all 
come up from open source technology. 
These technology that are open source 
in nature are creating brand new value 
chain and business models, threatening 
existing business models. Traditional 
companies are being challenged. If 
a traditional company wants to use 
blockchain, they would have to look at 
open source anyway. If they want to look 
at IoT, I’m going to bet my bottom dollar 
that it’s going to be open source.
PC.com 
As 
you’ve 
mentioned, 
open source plays a huge role in 
innovation. How is the reaction from 
Malaysian businesses? 
Wong: A Forrester study showed 
Malaysian companies viewed open 
source primarily as a cost saving tool, 
which isn’t bad, but most Malaysian 
companies are still at a stage where 
they associated open source as a way to 
reduce cost, as oppose to leveraging it 
for agility and innovation. Nothing wrong 
with that, but we’ve seen other countries 
and companies that have gone through 
that phase, and taken advantage of open 
source to bring cost down but have come 
to the realisation that they are using 
it to drive agility and innovation more 
than anything else. It’s driven by market 
condition and circumstances.
PC.com: What are some of the factors 
hindering the adoption of open 
source?
Wong: Market skill availability and 
competency is always something that is 
a key driver for adoption. Secondly, it’s 
awareness. How aware are companies 
about the development elsewhere. If you 
are a company that is being challenged 
by digital disruptors, it would be fairly 
apparent to you that technology is 
impacting your business. You can either 
ignore it and watch your business continue 
to decline, or respond. It depends on how 
much pressure are they facing? Has the 
pressure reach the point where they have 
to change?
PC.com: Recently a lot of concerns 
revolve 
around 
cybersecurity. 
Especially 
with 
open 
source 
technology, 
there’s 
a 
concern 
amongst companies that it’s less 
secure than proprietary platforms. 
What are your views on this?
Wong: Security is critical. There are a 
lot of threats that exist. We also believe 
that open source is inherently a lot more 
secure and more safe. The fact that you 
expose the code, and the only changes 
that can be made is by distributed peer 
review, means that no one can slip 
something in unnoticed, without other 
people noticing. 
Look at some of the recent malware 
attacks. You notice it targets proprietary 
technology platforms. These technologies 
could’ve been secure, but the fact that it 
was closed sourced and black boxed, 
means that no one knows, except for 
people who wrote the code. That is an 
inherent flaw of proprietary software.
It’s been a misconception that has 
been propagated by many companies for 
a long, long time, for obvious reasons. If 
your business model was threatened by 
open source you’d want people to think 
it’s less secure. 
PC.com: What are some predictions 
you have to how technology will 
evolve and how the market will 
respond to these changes?
Wong: I wished I had a crystal ball 
that could tell me everything. My CEO 
said something that I think is quite 
enlightening. He said planning is dead. 
It’s a bit extreme but to a certain extend 
it’s quite true. Anyone who comes up 
with a 3- or 5-year plan often finds that 
at the end of the period, all their plans 
have been superseded by technologies 
and innovation that have come out from 
nowhere. No one would have predicted 
blockchain prior to it being a major 
disruptor. If you have done your planning 
before blockchain technologies came to 
the forefront, were you going to ignore it 
because it’s not in the plan? The best way 
to respond is to be adaptive and agile.

ransform digitally, or perish. in 
the last few years we’ve been 
constantly reminded of the risks 
of falling into obscurity if we 
don’t take the full advantage of what the 
digital era has to offer. 
Yet 
while 
digital 
transformation 
increasingly appears on business and iT 
leaders’ agendas, many organisations are yet 
to establish what it really entails – making 
the transformation process a bit of a mystery. 
An iT transformation maturity curve study 
commissioned by Dell eMC via the enterprise 
Strategy Group found almost all businesses 
are struggling with the transformation journey 
(95% of those surveyed agreed). 
The main challenge for most 
organisations is that they were not 
started in the digital era. They bring 
legacy systems and operating models 
that have worked well in the past, so iT 
transformation creates a fear of “we don’t 
know what we don’t know”.  At the same 
time, organisations agree that transforming 
legacy iT is essential to winning in the 
future and ensuring competitive advantage 
for the business. 
One thing is clear – no two 
transformations are alike and every 
business, with its own set of challenges and 
strengths, will need guidance and support 
to begin the iT transformation journey. 
And each business will need to demystify 
what this journey will look like for them. 
Based on the research, organisations that 
have experienced benefits and improved 
business outcomes through transformed iT 
have four core truths in common. 
Using 
these, 
and 
through 
collaboration with strategic partners, they 
can better understand the unknowns and 
find a way to optimise their level of iT 
maturity to become fully transformed.  
1. Embracing agile principles 
Key requirements of the digital era include 
agility and a rapid evolution of operational 
processes, new products, and business 
models. increased agility can be achieved 
in a number of ways, for example the 
adoption of software or the automation 
of iT processes. Software is often the key 
to unlocking digital business advantage: 
scalable, 
infrastructure-independent 
development frameworks, combined with 
agile DevOps (development operations) 
processes, dramatically accelerate the 
development of cloud-native applications. 
According 
to 
the 
research,

Taking the mystery out of IT transformation

highest on the maturity curve, outperform 
others in their ability to quickly respond to 
business requests and complete their tasks 
and projects. For these digitally mature 
businesses, automation is a key enabler 
of agility. Transformed organisations are 
more than four times as likely to have 
made excellent progress with automating 
manual iT processes and tasks. Looking 
more closely at software and automation 
are two known and proven steps towards 
successful iT transformation. 
2. Investing in innovation
Organisations 
usually 
consider 
iT 
budgets in two categories: maintaining 
existing infrastructures and investing in 
new projects. For iT transformation, the 
balance and relationship between these 
budgets needs to shift. According to the 
iT transformation maturity curve study, 
transformed organisations that adopted 
innovative iT infrastructures reported 
that an average 46% of their budget was 
freed up and spent on innovation, much 
more than organisations that ranked as 
less advanced. Moreover, organisations 
ranking lower on the maturity curve spend 
around two-thirds of their iT budget on 
maintaining existing systems. 
when 
demystifying 
and 
defining transformation strategy, iT 
leaders need to make sure current 
iT infrastructure is also enabling 
innovation - are legacy technologies 
creating performance bottlenecks, cost 
overruns, slower time-to-market, and 
capability shortfalls? This could be 
holding back transformation if so. 
Transformed iT organisations also 
place strategic bets on a broad array of 
modern data centre technologies, from 
high-performance, easy-to-scale storage 
systems, through pre-packaged, easy-to-
integrate converged and hyperconverged 
systems, 
to 
flexible, 
software-
defined architectures. A successful iT 
transformation involves redefining the 
strategy to have a focus on innovation, 
resulting in the transformed delivery 
and consumption of iT services, as well 
as dramatically reduced operational 
and capital expenditure. 
3. IT aligned with the business
Legacy organisations are often hampered 
by the ‘but it used to work for us in the 
past’ mentality. Such a mindset has no 
place in the digital era. Better knowing 
how iT transformation should take place 
requires iT leaders to establish clearly 
defined milestones and make sure 
that top management has a close 
eye on developments. in fact, when 
respondents working at transformed iT 
organisations were asked to categorise 
how their line of business stakeholders 
feel about the iT organisation, 21% 
(seven times the rate observed among 
legacy organisations) reported that they 
are seen as a competitive differentiator 
and 49% reported they were seen as a 
valued service provider.
Transformed iT organisations keep 
digital transformation efforts on track 
as they ensure alignment with other 
business leaders. Frequent meetings with 
leadership and other stakeholders who 
can provide objective advice and feedback 
on 
meeting 
business 
expectations 
are essential. Such alignment can be 
reinforced with formal reporting structures 
that give CiOs direct access to their CeOs 
and other executive leadership positions. 
4. Skills transformation
Transformed organisations realise that 
as legacy iT evolves, new skills, abilities, 
and ways of thinking about how iT serves 
the business will be essential to success. 
Only a few people in today’s workforce 
already possess required skillsets for the 
digital era. For example, Ge, the 120-year-
old company that has evolved from an 
organisation that was predominantly 
involved in selling industrial equipment 
to one that offers data and analytics 
software services across their products 
portfolio, has recently launched a 
proprietary skills curriculum to train their 
employees for new, highly valuable jobs 
needed in the digital era.
in Malaysia, telecommunications 
company Telekom Malaysia (TM) started 
its digital transformation journey in 2015 
with the launch of a pilot project called 
i-Join for the mass market segment. 
Consumers 
in 
Malaysia 
are 
embracing a digital lifestyle, and TM 
realised that they needed to transform 
digitally to stay relevant. The i-Join project 
enables cross-functional teams such as 
the business and iT sectors to adopt the 
agile way of working thus improving both 
the company’s top and bottom line, but 
above all, deliver an exceptional digital 
experience to its customers.
it’s crucial for iT and business leaders 
to conduct a thorough analysis of its most 
important resource to identify and work to 
eliminate skills gaps that could cripple iT’s 
ability to execute strategic transformation 
initiatives. Organisations might look for 
the guidance outside or develop a skills 
development training program in-house. 
iT transformation is a first step on 
the digital transformation journey. it can 
come in many designs, depending on 
business requirements, yet the target goal 
is the same: an iT organisation that has 
achieved a level of maturity that is agile, 
creates more opportunity for innovation, 
and has a fixed seat at the table with 
business decision makers. 
For many, that journey is filled 
with unknowns. But through a strategic 
focus on these four key areas, and 
collaboration with experienced partners, 
organisations can better understand the 
steps they need to take to define their iT 
transformation future.

artificial 
intelligence 
and 
robots 
replacing 
humans, 
from 
real-world 
worries 
about 
job displacement to dystopian visions 
of subjugation, are going strong. But 
as the world continues to flood with 
data, there’s no reason for designers 
or engineers to panic, and many 
reasons to get excited. Current trends 
in technology - including virtual reality 
(vR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed 
reality (MR) - actually have the potential 
to create stronger connections between 
people and machines.
vR 
(immersing 
yourself 
in 
a completely artificial world), AR 
(overlaying a digital layer of contextual 
information into the built environment), 
and MR (an interactive mix of vR and 
AR) are quickly gathering speed. But 
we’re in the early days. A lot of today’s 
revolutionary devices will eventually look 
like the first mobile phones-big bricks 
with coiled cords, in bulky briefcases. 
A sea change, led by the advancement 
of Ai and other technologies, is poised to 
chart the course of the industrial world. 
This power in computing, graphics, and 
new input interfaces will increase human 
efficiency, productivity, and our ability to 
merge with and better understand the 
information around us.  
imagine a world where construction 
plans or physical prototypes are no longer 
needed to create or understand a design. A 
combination of AR/vR, machine learning, 
Ai, robotics, advanced fabrication, and 
generative design will help humans and 
machines connect digital information 
and the built environment. Designers and 
engineers will gain the ability to interpret 
cumbersome, continuous, and complex 
signals, and distill the information within 
the spatial context of their work. 
Reimagining the Workplace, and 
Jobsite
Designers, 
engineers, 
makers, 
and 
builders are inundated with digital 
information. it’s getting more complex, 
and margins are getting smaller, but the 
nature of work is going to change over 
the next five to 10 years. 
Today, construction is mostly done 
with paper data, and many architects 
still use 2D renderings for plans. But 
when concepts are illustrated in true 
3D - whether as augmented information 
on a jobsite or virtual reality during a 
design review - comprehension of that 
information goes up. 
Once fully immersed into vR or 
AR, people in different disciplines and 
settings can simulate a design that’s 
already built and operating, or they can 
augment a design within the context 
of a job. This increase both efficiency 
and understanding, leading to better-
informed decisions, higher productivity, 
and fewer errors.
For years, architects would look at 
renderings and say, “That’s great!” But if 
they see the same BiM model in vR, they 
may say, “wow, that ceiling’s too low,” or, 
“This doesn’t work.”
AR holds great potential for 
construction sites. Using AR devices such 
as a helmet or glasses (or even a mobile 
phone or tablet), contractors and engineers 
can see the BiM model overlaid onto the 
physical site, walk around and identify 
issues in the built environment, and add 
comments, which are then localised 
automatically to the digital model. 
visualising data in AR and vR gives 
them the ability to see the unseen. For

example, if an engineer performs a finite 
analysis of a load on a structure, in the 
old days, that would take the form of a 
giant spreadsheet. now he or she can 
overlay a gradient map onto a design to 
see parts of the structure that are likely 
to break. This introduces a new feedback 
loop into the process.
Better Prototyping and Training
vR, AR, and MR technology can 
introduce both hard and soft cost savings 
on projects - it’s about producing less. 
For example, car manufacturers make 
clay prototypes. But what could happen 
when engineers build a virtual prototype 
and make decisions based on the vR 
model? instead of engineers reviewing 
physical 
prototypes 
and 
manually 
accommodating data back into designs, 
those decisions would be computable 
and articulated in the model itself. By 
replacing the physical prototype step 
with vR and incorporating it into the 
workflow, manufacturers save material, 
time, and money. 
vR can also streamline architectural 
projects: For example, when an architect 
designs a gantry in a hospital and needs to 
determine the number of steps it takes to 
get from the OR to the eR, an error in that 
calculation could hurt the bottom-line. vR 
could give the architect the ability to better 
understand the outcome of the design 
before anything’s built.  
AR can also be used to train and 
retrain factory or construction workers. 
employees with decades of jobsite 
experience and institutional knowledge 
are nearing retirement, taking that 
valuable 
information 
with 
them. 
Capturing that data now, in a way that 
can used to educate the next generation, 
means a better-trained workforce that 
benefits from hands-on learning.   
Technology in its Infancy
Most people have experienced AR, 
vR, and MR only as a demo or a 
visualisation solution at the end of a 
process; it’s been a spectator sport. 
So how does the technology become 
integrated into the entire process, form 
design to simulation, to training? it’s 
about centralising and connecting data 
in those environments.
when 
computer 
mainframes 
gave way to personal computers, the 
way people worked changed forever. 
Then desktops shifted to mobile PCs, 
and data moved to the cloud. in the 
next wave of computing, devices will 
disappear and the world (or the human 
body) will become the interface and 
display - ushering in new inputs, new 
modalities, new ways of displaying, 
optics, rendering, and new ways that 
high-frequency and low-frequency data 
will flow through future systems. 
As devices disappear, there will 
be a transition from tablet-based AR 
or tethered vR to smaller headsets. 
The form factors will shrink down. it’s 
probably still five to 10 years before there 
will be true immersive holograms. But 
over the next one to two years, there will 
likely be some amazing breakthroughs in 
the enterprise space.
when that happens, designers 
and engineers will be able to peer into 
the lens of the things they care about 
through vR, AR, and MR-and have a 
conversation. each stakeholder will be 
able to prioritise relevant aspects of a 
story (a.k.a. design), and they’ll be able 
to contribute more to the story. 
vR, AR, and MR will give designers, 
engineers, makers, and builders new 
superpowers to see the unseen, take on 
new jobs they’ve never done before, and 
predict outcomes with certainty.

Destiny 2
it’s Finally 
Here
99
OCT 2017

ive months ago, on 28 March, the 
Gods over at Bungie teased us with 
a trailer of a Cayde-6 monologue 
– voiced by the amazing Nathan 
Fillion – as he talks about shooting down 
enemies who destroyed his second 
favourite spicy ramen shop. Two days 
later, the official worldwide reveal trailer 
was released. Titled ‘Rally the Troops’, 
it showed Zavala and Cayde-6 in a rally 
call to gather all former Destiny players 
back into the game; not going to lie, I was 
sold there and then. Partially, it was due 
to Zavala’s inspiring words but mostly, it 
was all because of Cayde-6 when he said, 
“There will be a ton of loot!”
Allow Me to Reacquaint You
Anyone who played the beta early access 
would remember this line very well. 
Although Ghaul’s definition was focused 
towards reacquainting Guardians with 
the fear of death, I took it as a way of 
reconnecting back with Destiny.
As the ruler of the Cabal Empire, 
Ghaul has gained access of the Last City, 
taken The Speaker hostage, destroyed the 
Tower – which plenty of Destiny players 
originally called home – and severed the 
ties between Guardians and the Light by 
locking the Traveller in a containment 
device for his own evil scheme. This sets 
up Destiny 2 players into survival mode as 
it strays away from the first game where 
your Guardian already has the protection 
of the Light.
The game starts you off weakened, 
without any ammo and your Ghost not being 
able to revive you if you were to die. This 
gave the game a very bleak and ominous 
intro, which perfectly illustrated the grave 
dangers the Guardians were facing without 
the Light. As you journey through the game 
trying to find surviving Guardians, you will 
eventually meet up with the OG Fireteam of 
Zavala, Cayde-6 and Ikora.
Another great introduction to 
Destiny 2 are the additions of new 
subclasses in each of the three primary 
classes: Titan, Hunter and Warlock. Each 
class will then come with three different 
subclasses in three primary damage 
sources: Solar, Arc and Void. I stuck 
by my Warlock from Destiny 1, mainly 
because of its Arc-based “Stormcaller” 
subclass with the “Stormtrance” super (I 
was basically Emperor Palpatine.)
My personal favourite was giving you 
new and different dance moves as well as 
interactive motions with other players. My 
Warlock can actually breakdance properly 
now instead of waddling around like a 
duck high on bath salts.
Where the Loot at?
As already mentioned in previous 
statements, the guys over at Bungie 
decided that existing Destiny players 
will be able to port their characters over. 
Sadly, all weapons and armour were 
destroyed when the Cabal attacked 
(which is great motivation for wanting 
to kick their behinds even more.) 
However, Bungie does give existing 
players a nice token of appreciation 
by listing down their accomplishments 
from the first game when you first start 
Destiny 2. I’d showcase mine but sadly, 
I never really accomplished much in 
Destiny so there’s literally nothing for 
me to show (that didn’t sound as sad as 
it did in my head.)
Loot drops in Destiny 2 have been a 
bit easier as compared to its predecessor 
in terms of getting Rares and Uncommons 
but a bit harder when it comes to grinding 
out the Legendary and Exotic items. One 
way to get through this is with Public 
Events that can be found on the available 
planets in the game. To make the most 
F

out of a Public Event, you will have to meet 
certain requirements to turn it into a Heroic 
Event, which will grant you better loot once 
the event is over. Of course, it’s not wise 
to do a Public Event alone unless you’re 
completely sure of your ability, weapons 
and armour (I sure as hell wasn’t.)
The Core Essence of Destiny 2
While the storyline of Destiny 2 is 
compelling, it’s never enough to keep 
the game interesting. That is why the 
story only plays a small yet, somewhat 
significant role into the game. Once 
you’ve finished with the main storyline 
(which will probably take between 10 
to 15 hours, depending on your level of 
dedication), you’ll have enough weapons 
and armour to start on Strikes (co-op 
three-man Fireteam mission) and Raids 
(co-op six-man Fireteam mission.)
I have yet to go through Strikes or 
Raids because most of my friends have 
yet to get Destiny 2. Those that do have 
the game want nothing to do with me 
because I am too low levelled and they 
don’t see the point in having me on their 
team. It’s times like these you value 
who your real friends are (I basically 
unfriended a few of them.)
What’s great about Destiny 2’s 
gameplay mechanics is that it’s not centred 
around its levelling system, which tops out 
at level 20 for all players (you can still fill 
out your EXP bar as every time you do, you 
gain a Bright Engram.) This will probably 
last until the next expansion rolls out. To 
truly determine your worth as a Guardian, 
it’s all up to your Power level, also known 
Light level to older players. Your Power 
level increases when you keep upgrading 
your weapon and armour so the higher the 
damage and defence of a specific item, the 
higher your Power level increases.
Come for the Badassery, Stay for the 
Loot
In all seriousness, Destiny 2 is one of the 
better games I’ve played in 2017. Even 
after completing the main storyline, you 
still have plenty of other side quests to 
accomplish, ensuring the game is almost 
never-ending. What’s great is that there 
will surely be expansions coming out 
soon so there will be more content to look 
forward to from Bungie.

A BAttle for 
the Ages
By Teh Wi-Liam
By Teh Wi-Liam
PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds
ever has a game captured the 
world with such intensity than 
PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds 
(PUBG.) Although still part of 
Steam’s Early Access program, PUBG 
has already gained a healthy following, 
hitting over one million players at 
its peak. PUBG also surpassed other 
popular Valve titles like Dota 2 and 
CS:GO so you know it’s good.
After hearing about all the hype PUBG 
has gained and through various friends and 
streamers, I decided to give PUBG a go, 
even against my better judgment (I hate 
games that are over-hyped.)
In a Nutshell
PUBG is much like your typical 
multiplayer online battle arena game, 
but with an added twist. A survival game 
without any horror but a lot of stress 
and pressure added, PUBG consists of a 
100-player limit battle arena where you 
and 99 other players are fighting to be 
the last man standing.
You can either play it solo or in 
a team of four, which could or could 
not work out in your favour. Set in a 
dystopian island where all 100 players 
will parachute down from to scavenge 
the land for weapons, armour and 
supplies, the objective of PUBG is 
simple: kill or be killed.
With the number of weapons 
scattered around the map (which varies 
each round), I can’t help but wonder if the 
island is located somewhere in America 
with its ultra-lax gun laws (too soon?)
As the entire map is playable and 
explored, this gives off a false sense 
of security. Every few minutes, the 
playable area of the map will shrink, 
which means you must get yourself into 
the zone or die a slow and annoying 
death outsize the zone. This also 
increases your chances of encountering 
other players in the game.
Loot drops will also appear every 
now and then during the duration of the 
game with red smoke billowing from it. The 
good thing about loot drops is the items you 
will get from them as you can’t find them 
anywhere else in the game. The bad part: 
it increases your chances of encountering 
other players or getting shot to death while 
running to it in an open area.
Be Anyone You Want
Much like many other online multiplayer 
games, PUBG comes with its own in-game

currency that can be used to purchase 
cosmetic items for player customisation. 
This has no advantage to your gameplay; 
all it does is make you look either cool 
or stupid, depending on how you want 
to dress yourself.
In-game currency is earned every 
end of the round and the amount depends 
on how long you survived, the number 
of players you killed and the amount of 
damage you managed to inflict.
Anarchy
PUBG’s gameplay is simple: survive. 
The entire objective of PUBG is about 
survivability. In a first-person shooter 
setting, PUBG encourages players to 
camp because that is the safest way for 
you to stay alive.
Of course, you’re more than 
welcomed to just wander around in the 
open; but, that puts your fate in the 
hands of the 99 other players.
My previous few experiences with 
PUBG has taught me a few lessons.
Lesson One: Friends are the best/
worst people to play with, depending 
on how much of a troll they are. I can’t 
count the number of times my friends 
and I found a car to reach the shrinking 
playable area of the map, only to have 
one idiot flip the car on the way there. 
What followed was all four of us slowly 
dying out in the dead zone.
Lesson Two: Never run straight. If 
possible, run in a completely random pattern; 
throw in some zig-zags, circles and jumps in 
your running to make sure the other players 
can’t aim down on you. Unfortunately, I 
learned this a little too late; following in 
Rickon Stark’s footsteps (literally), I died with 
a crossbow arrow to the chest.
Lesson Three: Level three gear is 
the best. Anything else isn’t worth your 
time and weight in gold.
Where do we go from Here?
While games like Dota 2, LoL, CS:GO 
and CoD were the breeding grounds for 
today’s top eSports athletes, it was also 
the place where the birth of salty, raging 
gamers were born.
If that’s the case, PUBG should be 
where gamers from around the world 
compete to see who is the biggest troll of 
them all. With the ability to kill enemies 
with crossbows, frying pans and even 
running them over with a car, there’s no 
end to the amount of trolling one can 
accomplish on PUBG.
Be warned though, while other top 
online games may give you cancer, PUBG 
will probably ruin your sanity for good.

Sonic Mania
gametime reviews
104
OCT 2017

he blue blur is back to celebrate 
the 25th anniversary of the Sonic 
series. Sonic Mania is a fast-paced 
side-scrolling 2D platformer published 
by Sega and developed by Christian White, 
PagodaWest Games and Headcano. They’re 
all known for their work within the Sonic 
fangame community and enhanced ports 
of early Sonic games. This collaboration 
between company and fans was a first 
for Sega but was born out of the fans 
love of classic Sonic 2D platform games.
With a storyline that picks up straight 
after Sonic 3 & Knuckles, Sonic, Tails and 
Knuckles are thrown into the fray again as 
they investigate an anomalous power signal 
on Angel Island (Knuckles’ home and the 
epicentre for the events of Sonic & Knuckles). 
Of course, Dr. Eggman and his 
team of elite robots, the Hard Boiled 
Heavies, intercept Sonic and his 
buddies before they get to the source 
of the signal. Reinvigorated with 
new powers, the evildoers banish the 
heroes to different time periods. Sonic, 
Tails and Knuckles now have to chase 
Eggman thru the eras to stop him from 
fulfilling his nefarious plans. 
The premise sets the game up from 
some very nostalgia inducing visuals as 
you play through some familiar zones 
such as Green Hill Zone and Flying Battery 
Zone. While familiar, the developers 
have taken level design to new heights 
literally with multiple branching routes 
for players to explore. Players annoyed 
by the water levels in the past Sonic 
series can now bypass areas by simply 
taking the higher ground. 
Exploration is rewarded with secret 
areas containing powerups or a Giant 
Ring which transports players to a Sonic 
R inspired special stage which rewards 
the player with a Chaos Emerald upon 
completion. 
Gameplay 
controls 
are 
exactly what you’d expect out of a Sonic 
game from this era. It’s tight, responsive 
and rewarding when a player manages to 
fluidly completely a level. 
When it comes to retro revival 
games, the topic of graphics can be a 
tough debate. Sonic Mania to a certain 
extent suffers from this but comparing 
gameplay 
footage 
from 
the 
last 
Genesis era Sonic game to Sonic Mania 
dispelled any gripes I have as the sprite 
work in this game is certainly detailed. 
In terms of capability, the graphics are 
definitely better than what the Genesis 
was capable off and closer to a late 
generation Sega Saturn game. 
The developers have found a sweet 
spot that brings out the best of sprite based 
graphics while still furiously filling your 
head and heart with nostalgia. Of course, 
if you wanted to have a more authentic 
experience, there are shaders included 
in the graphical options menu to simulate 
scanlines from old CRT televisions. 
I did however find myself wanting 
more original levels as opposed to the 
newer remixed levels because some newer 
level design mechanics were introduced 
which certainly breathed new life to the 
Sonic series. If it was ever possible, Sonic 
is a lot faster in his old age. 
Sonic Mania’s soundscape ends 
up being an afterthought for me only 
because there’s just so much happening 
visually but I did find myself humming 
the music from my favourite zones 
while going about my daily life so it is 
infectious. A lot of work went into giving 
the sound of Sonic full depth and sound 
effects are rich and bountiful as you 
whizz pass the level collecting rings. No 
Sonic soundtrack is complete without 
the constant sound of golden rings being 
collected in the background. 
Sonic Mania is without a doubt a 
welcome addition to the Sonic series and 
a great success story of when fans and 
game companies collaborate on a passion 
project. While it might fall trap to some 
old 90s gaming frustrations such as enemy 
placement, it still manages to be fresh and 
exciting for players, old and new.
This is easily the best Sonic game 
to come out in the past 10 years. Usually 
when developers claim a game was made 
by fans, for fans, it’s just rhetoric. This 
time, it’s larger than life.

fter teasing us on its Twitter 
page, Rockstar Games has just 
dropped the official trailer for Red 
Dead Redemption 2. The game 
will be a prequel to Red Dead Redemption 
and is the third game of the series.
This time around, the focus will be 
placed on Arthur Morgan, a member of the 
Dutch van der Linde gang. If you remember, 
Dutch was one of the central antagonists in 
the first game so it’s safe to say we will be 
seeing more of him soon. We could also see 
John Marston, the protagonist for Red Dead 
Redemption as there is a connection between 
John and Arthur.
Red Dead Redemption 2 is now 
available for pre-sale with a release date 
slated for Spring 2018.

PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds sets an all-time high
All Hail PUBG
ust 
when 
you 
thought 
it 
couldn’t get any more popular, 
PlayerUnknown’s 
Battlegrounds 
sets a record on Steam Games with 
over 1.3 million players. More commonly 
known as PUBG, this increasingly popular 
multiplayer online battle arena even 
surpassed Dota 2 and CS:GO.
Still in Steam’s early access 
program since March 2017, PUBG has 
seen sales of over 10 million copies 
and still growing. The current count of 
PUBG’s all-time peak hits at 1,342,857 
players while Dota 2 comes in at 
1,295,114 players. CS:GO doesn’t even 
hit the one million mark. PUBG will 
be coming out on the Xbox One soon, 
which will probably see the player base 
increase exponentially.
As the name suggests, PUBG 
focuses on survival in a battle royale-
J
style scenario. Accommodating up to 
100 players in one sessions, players 
can choose to play solo or in teams 
of four. The main objective of PUBG is 
to scavenge for weapons, ammo and 
supplies, while fighting your way through 
other players to gain the coveted ‘Winner 
Winner, Chicken Dinner’ title.
