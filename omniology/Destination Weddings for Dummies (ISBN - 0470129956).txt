Author’s Acknowledgments
A tip of the hat to Barb Doyen, the agent who recruited me for this
project, and the team at Wiley for midwifing this baby. Hugs to Dana
and Yuri Daiter for the honor of including me in their ultimate desti-
nation wedding. Props to Scott Kurnit for coming up with the bril-
liant idea for About.com — and a shout-out to the many editors and
other staff members I’ve had the privilege of working with since the
beginning. You’ve given me the opportunity to guide a worldwide
audience to the most wonderful places for couples to experience.
Mille grazie to Mara Urshel of Kleinfeld Bridal and Steve Davis of
Jim’s Formal Wear, who informed me what the well-dressed desti-
nation bride and groom are wearing. Merci to Stephannie Barba for
her charming map. Appreciation also goes to cruise-wedding guru
Valerie Brizuela at The Wedding Experience and master bridal con-
sultant Sue Winner. Representatives of the many land-based desti-
nations and properties mentioned herein also have my gratitude.
But most of all, I would like to thank my husband, Vincent J. Sardone
for the loving kindness, the laughter, and carrying the luggage.
Without you, I might be a spinster with an unstamped passport.
With you, I soar.

Destination Weddings For Dummies

Introduction
A
ah . . . an old-fashioned wedding — the bride in a stiff white
gown, the groom in an equally rigid tuxedo, the attendants
decked out in identical outfits like Motown backup singers, the
strict rules about how invitations must read and who sits where,
the seriousness of it all! Plus don’t forget about the huge price tag
for an event that only lasts four hours. Does it make you wonder
whether a better way to get married is out there? One that’s more
fun, more exciting, and less expensive?
The answer is yes: It’s called a destination wedding. This enlight-
ened style of wedding has convinced millions of smart couples to
run away from home with their nearest and dearest to marry in a
place where they can celebrate for days.
Having planned my own destination wedding without professional
help, been to both plain and fancy weddings away, and traveled
around the world, I saw a need for a book that could take a couple
through the process without making it any more complicated or
costly than it has to be. So if you’re ready for the ultimate wedding
experience, you’ve come to the right place.
About This Book
Unlike other wedding guides that may stress you out with all the
details you’re “supposed” to concern yourself with, this book
shows you how really easy — and how much more affordable — a
destination wedding can be. You can’t find a timeline anywhere in
this book because destination weddings aren’t cookie-cutter affairs. 
Instead, I created this book to be a tool — full of Web sites to check
out, destinations to consider, and fun activities to try — to use at
your leisure and on your timetable. You may choose to dip into only
the chapters you need, but if you want to read the book from cover
to cover, go for it. You can come back to any part when you need it.
When I started researching this book and read critiques of compet-
ing ones that complained, “I could find most of this information
online,” I knew that this book had to be different. I acknowledge
you’re more than likely to use the Web, and I encourage you to do
so. Figures say that 77 percent of couples turn to the Net to plan
their wedding; I think that number is even higher.

Conventions Used in This Book
When writing this book, I included some general conventions that
all For Dummies books use. I use the following:
 I italicize any words you may not be familiar with and provide
a definition.
 I bold all keywords in bulleted lists and the actual steps in
numbered lists.
 All Web sites and e-mail addresses appear in monofont.
Foolish Assumptions
Destination Weddings For Dummies is for brides- and grooms-to-be,
moms and dads, wedding planners interested in extending their
range, and people who want to know more about this trend. In fact,
I carried a picture of you in my head. Here’s what I imagined:
 The two of you have recently decided you want to get married
(congratulations, by the way).
 You’re looking for a way to put your unique stamp on your
wedding or a wedding you’re helping to plan.
 You’re wondering how you can have a great event without
spending a fortune.
 You’re the parents of an engaged couple — and you want to
suggest a way for them to marry that won’t crack your nest egg.
 You’re not too experienced about this destination-wedding
business, but you’re smart.
 You’re not quite engaged yet, but you like to be prepared for
the future.
 You want a book that can explain the basics, and you can take
it from there, using a computer and Internet access.
I can’t tell you whether a destination wedding can meet your
requirements and prevent an insurrection at home. But I can tell
you how to make one as good as it can be — an event that you and
your guests will remember with fondness for years to come.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into five sections, each with several chapters
that illuminate the main topic and assist you in making decisions
and planning your destination wedding.

wedding emergencies in Chapter 19 (what event would be com-
plete without at least one?) and how to save money in Chapter 20.
Icons Used in This Book
Small illustrations in the margin, icons clue you into extra info that
can save you time, money, or aggravation. Here are the icons I use:

Where to Go from Here
If you’re at the very beginning of planning a wedding away, or
aren’t sure yet whether one is right for the two of you, I suggest
you start at the front. Otherwise, dive in wherever you find chap-
ters that apply to the stage you’re in. If you’re not quite sure where
to start, check out the table of contents or index and find a subject
that piques your interest, and then start reading on any page. If
you want to take a mental vacation, go straight to Chapter 6. I also
recommend that you read Part IV early on, so you can begin to pic-
ture yourselves arriving at the destination before your guests do.
The last thing I want to tell you before you start the book is this:
I’ve been there, and you have my word of honor that nothing is
better than a destination wedding for an out-of-this-world experi-
ence. So hang in there, enjoy the journey, and let this book be
your guide.

very marriage begins with a unique love story. If yours also
includes a taste for travel, a passion for adventure, and the com-
mitment to celebrate in your own way, yours can lead to extraordi-
nary places in your journey to marry at a destination wedding.
Today, as many as one in four engaged couples has a destination
wedding. Do you and your fiancé envision yourselves as one of
those couples? If so, this chapter can help you begin, serving as
your jumping-off point into the world of destination weddings —
what they mean, whether a wedding away is right for you, and how
to plan one as the next chapter in your love story.
Defining Destination Weddings
and Why They’re So Popular
A destination wedding is a wedding ceremony and celebration held
in a location away from where the bride or groom live. Basically it’s
your wedding, your way . . . just away. Because a destination wed-
ding always involves travel, more time is allotted for the occasion,
and the wedding becomes a multiday event.
Laid-back beach hotels, mountaintop ski resorts, lush vineyards,
glitzy casino hotels, full-service cruise ships, exotic islands, and
European castles and villas are among the top venues couples
choose because the “destination” part of the equation is as impor-
tant as the “wedding” one.

You may hear a destination wedding referred to as a wedding away
or a weddingmoon. Although most couples do segue from their des-
tination wedding right into the honeymoon, it’s not necessarily
part of the overall plan. Whether you take your honeymoon before,
immediately after, or sometime in the future, Chapter 18 discusses
the advantage of each choice and having the honeymoon you want.
This section gives you a quick overview of destination weddings,
including the main advantages of weddings away and why they’re
becoming the fastest-growing segment of the bridal industry.
Chapter 2 helps you determine whether one is right for you.
Simplifying your wedding
Destination weddings allow you, the couple, to make your own
rules. At hometown weddings, the reception always follows the
ceremony. And a young bride and groom who are heavily influ-
enced by their parents’ taste and budget may be pressured into
having a more traditional or complex wedding than they really
want.
When more-independent couples wed, they’re likely to make
choices that are personally important to them, rather than follow-
ing what others say they “should” have or “should” do at their
wedding. Overall, destination weddings tend to be modest and
casual. The emphasis is on relaxation and shared experiences.
Your ceremony could be followed by guests mounting waiting
horses to take off on a trail ride, or boarding a catamaran for an
afternoon of snorkeling. And in place of a stuffy, old-fashioned
reception, you can have a beach barbecue capped by fireworks.
The fun, ease, convenience, and simplicity of a wedding away are
especially appealing to certain types of couples, especially more-
mature ones. They may have busy careers but a fondness for
travel. Perhaps one or both of them are getting married for the
second or third time, and they want to do something in a com-
pletely different way from an earlier wedding. Or they may not
have the time, taste, or funds for a big, complicated affair.
Paying the price
The expense of a hometown wedding is a strong incentive to make
couples scan the horizon for a cheaper place to tie the knot. On
average, weddings away cost about 40 percent less than traditional
at-home weddings. The price of a nice ceremony in the Caribbean
or Mexico rarely exceeds $10,000 — and many come in at half that
amount or less.
Part I: Marrying Your Way: Away You Go 
8

The average American wedding now runs $27,852, according to a
recent Condé Nast Bridal Group study. And with wedding costs
rising about 8 percent annually, by 2010 the average wedding tab is
likely to approach $35,000. In urban areas that include New York
City; Washington, D.C.; and Los Angeles, that’s already the price
tag for a modest affair.
How much sense does it make to spend money on a wedding that
you could otherwise use to buy a new car, put a down payment on
a house, or take the honeymoon trip of a lifetime? That’s some-
thing you have to decide for yourselves — although many destina-
tion wedding couples already know they would rather put the cash
in their pockets than in a conventional wedding’s coffers.
Choosing quality over quantity
Transporting friends and family to a dream destination to see you
marry can feel like stepping into a fairytale or an adventure film.
Lifting people out of their everyday lives and bringing them to a
place that’s beautiful and exciting has a magical quality to it — a
definite destination wedding appeal.
Weddings away are also popular because you get to invite only the
people you truly want to come. Because not everyone can afford to
travel, guest lists are smaller than those of hometown weddings.
Fewer guests means a more intimate event in an ideal setting to
reunite with those who mean the most to you. (You can find advice
on who to invite in Chapter 12.)
Chapter 1: Destination Weddings 101

The rationale for my wedding away
When I was planning to get married, I interviewed several people in the wedding
industry in New York City. At one hotel, the banquet manager painted this picture:
“Imagine yourself gliding down our 60-foot aisle wearing a long satin gown and
train dotted with rhinestones. Everyone you know (we can fit 400 in our space!)
is gazing up at you. In one corner of the room, a string quartet serenades you
with a work by Beethoven, and the entire space is decorated to resemble a
winter palace, complete with faux hanging icicles.”
Knowing I’d feel dressed for Halloween in that fashion, hating the idea that people
would be staring at me, loathing classical music, and imagining that the budget for
an event decorated that way would approximate the Gross National Product of a
small country, I gulped, ran home as fast as I could, and said, “Honey, we’re going
to Vegas. . . “

The size of a guest list for a destination wedding can range from
zero into the hundreds, but most lists usually don’t exceed 100. 
A typical wedding away involves just 15 to 20 guests, although that
number is expanding as more and more couples get wise to the
advantages of affordable out-of-town weddings.
Although couples can ease their financial burden by having a desti-
nation wedding, guests don’t get off as easily. Their costs of trans-
portation, lodging, and food and activities not covered by the
hosts can easily top $1,000 over the course of a long weekend 
(not to mention a wedding gift). Attendants who are asked to wear
special dresses and accessories or rent tuxedoes have to shell out
even more. Fortunately, the prospect of combining a vacation with
a celebration in a wonderful place helps most guests and wedding-
party members justify the expense.
When it comes down to it, though, all it takes is two to marry —
plus an officiant and witnesses, as required. So if you don’t care to
have guests at all, that’s your prerogative. Plenty of couples who
don’t want any fuss build a wedding into a vacation and comfort-
ably marry without fanfare.
The Differences between Getting
Married Away and at Home
Being aware of the differences between a destination wedding and
an at-home wedding can make it easier to decide which is right for
you. Chapter 2 goes into detail, but you need to know the following
essential points if you’re considering a destination wedding:
 Location, location, location: Destination weddings involve
overnight travel to another place, often selected for its scenic
appeal. If the setting is particularly beautiful, the wedding
couple may be able to save money on certain aspects of the
wedding, such as flowers and decorations.
 More time to celebrate: A conventional hometown wedding
lasts between three and five hours, longer if you have a break
between the ceremony and reception. In general, a destination
wedding takes place over three days or more.
 Lower cost: Despite the longer amount of time involved, desti-
nation weddings are usually cheaper than at-home ones. Find
out about budgeting in Chapter 4 and see the “Paying the
price” section earlier in this chapter for more info.
Part I: Marrying Your Way: Away You Go 
10

 Casual versus traditional celebration: Hometown weddings
are normally traditional affairs, sometimes stodgy and often
predictable due to formulaic agendas. At a destination wed-
ding, you can toss out conventions you don’t like and make
the event as laid back or as formal as you like. Most couples
opt for casual ease.
 Making your own rules: Beyond the necessity of obtaining a
wedding license and being married by a licensed officiant,
destination weddings don’t have any hard-and-fast rules. For
example, you know that one about the groom not seeing the
bride in her dress before the wedding? At a destination wed-
ding, the couple may have checked into their room a couple
of days before the event — and he’s the one to zip up her
dress and tell her she looks beautiful before they head off
together to say their vows at an oceanside gazebo.
 Say good-bye to the home team: Because a destination wed-
ding usually takes place a significant distance from home,
anyone you can’t do without — from your pastor to your 
pedicurist — you have to invite to the wedding and pay for
their time, travel, and services. Otherwise, expect to use a
local officiant and vendors. (For more on gathering your desti-
nation wedding team, see Chapter 5.)
Chapter 1: Destination Weddings 101 11
Understanding how eloping differs 
from a destination wedding
In the past, marrying away from home was synonymous with eloping. That was usu-
ally the only option for young couples who needed parental consent for marriage but
couldn’t obtain it. They’d quietly leave home — often concealed under the cover of
night’s darkness — bound for a place where the legal age for marriage was lower,
and no one would appear to challenge their intent to wed. (Read about Gretna
Green, Scotland — a refuge for lovers for centuries — in Chapter 9.)
When couples of legal age eloped, they often did so to avoid familial conflict over
differences in color or creed. Sometimes, though, couples simply eloped because
it was fast, easy, private, and cheap.
Today the definition of eloping refers to any couple who secretly heads off to another
place to marry. Sometimes the decision is impromptu, but other times, their inten-
tions are planned far in advance. Either way, guests are rarely involved and vows
typically aren’t followed by a reception. The couple either continues on to a honey-
moon or returns to their normal lives right away, announcing the marriage at a time
when they see fit.

Making Your Wedding Legal:
What You Need to Know
In order to become legally married, you need to apply for and
obtain a marriage license and have your vows formalized by an
authorized officiant within a designated time period. When you’re
getting married in a location other than your hometown, you must
follow its laws to ensure that your marriage there is legal. This sec-
tion briefly looks at various locations within the United States and
elsewhere to help you be aware of laws in different destinations.
Marrying in the United States
Marriage license laws and requirements differ from state to state
and locality to locality in the United States. All have a minimum age
requirement, but that varies as well. If you’re getting married in the
U.S., prepare ahead of time by finding out what the laws and
requirements are where you intend to marry. To do so, contact the
town or county clerk in your chosen destination and ask how to
apply for a license.
Different U.S. states permit a wide range of officiants to perform civil
and religious ceremonies. Find a state-by-state list at marriage.
about.com/cs/marriagelicenses/a/officiants.htm. To have
a religious ceremony in a U.S. church, synagogue, mosque, or other
house of worship, contact the local cleric for information.
Getting hitched in another country
A legal overseas marriage license is also legal in the United States,
as long as it doesn’t break any state laws. Exceptions include same-
sex marriages, which are legal in Canada, Belgium, the Netherlands,
South Africa, and Spain, but not in the United States. Only in
Massachusetts can same-sex residents legally marry.
For all couples, countries outside the U.S. have strict guidelines
before issuing a license. These can include residency requirements
and the expense of translating relevant documents into the coun-
try’s official language. To find out more about the legality of an
overseas wedding, check out Chapter 6. You can also find the offi-
cial link to marriage license information for all the locales men-
tioned in this book in Chapters 7, 8, and 9.
To avoid delay and complications when marrying abroad, many
couples opt to first have a private civil ceremony where they live.
Part I: Marrying Your Way: Away You Go 
12

The event that takes place during the destination wedding then
becomes a symbolic ceremony. You can read more about these in
Chapter 6.
If you want to have a religious ceremony abroad, set the wheels in
motion by requesting a meeting with your rabbi, minister, or parish
priest. He can put you in touch with regional headquarters, which
can help you contact overseas prelates.
Don’t allow yourselves to fall in love with the idea of marrying in 
a foreign church simply because its stained-glass windows are
amazing or the architecture is majestic. Some churches and syna-
gogues don’t accommodate the wishes of couples who aren’t 
long-standing congregation members.
Looking at the Most Popular
Locations
When a particular destination is favored by a large number of cou-
ples, you can usually find a good reason for it. (Convenience and
ease of travel are major ones; that’s why, according to statistics,
two-thirds of couples choose the United States.)
Part II helps you explore all the best places for a destination wed-
ding in depth. However, if you can’t wait to find out what they are,
here are the top spots, year after year:
 Las Vegas: Vegas weddings are fast, fun, and can be very
affordable (as long as you don’t blow your stash at the casi-
nos or opt for an over-the-top affair). And nowhere else does a
marriage license bureau stay open until midnight every day.
Chapter 7 helps you plan a Vegas ceremony where the odds
are in your favor.
 Hawaii: Heavenly beaches and resorts dedicated to the 
pursuit of pleasure make these islands (especially Maui) a
popular choice. Explore them in Chapter 7.
 Disneyland and Disney World: Having recently introduced 
opulent couture weddings, Disney’s Fairy Tale Weddings keep
spreading pixie dust on loving couples. For more, see Chapter 7.
 The Caribbean and Mexico: Quintessential beach getaways,
the islands of the Caribbean, the coasts of Mexico — and the
all-inclusive resorts they harbor — have perfected the art of
providing couples with turnkey weddings (where all the ele-
ments are bundled together for your convenience). Dig up the
details in Chapter 8.
Chapter 1: Destination Weddings 101 13

 Canada: As charming as France in the east and as scenic as
the Alps in the west, Canada speaks your language. With an
advantageous exchange rate and legal same-sex marriages,
Canada provides ample reasons to head north of the border.
Find out more in Chapter 7.
 Fiji: This bit of heaven on earth is a long way to go to get 
married (and paradise doesn’t come cheap), but that doesn’t
discourage couples who want an uncommon ceremony in a
lush setting. Refer to Chapter 8.
 Europe: History, romance, scenic beauty, and sophisticated
culture draw couples here. Complex marriage requirements
erect obstacles in some countries such as France, although
others, like Scotland, are more welcoming. See Chapter 9 for
specifics.
 Cruise ships: The price is right, and so is the strategy: Marry
in port, and then sail off on your honeymoon. You can dis-
cover the ceremony, reception, and sail-away options offered
by different cruise lines in Chapter 10.
Answering Some Questions 
You May Have
If you’re seriously considering a destination wedding, you already
may have dozens of questions in mind. This book can answer
many of them and help make your destination wedding a once-in-a-
lifetime experience. The following addresses some of the bigger-
picture questions you may be wondering about:
 With so many amazing places to choose from, how do we
decide where to have the wedding? The short answer is to
find a place that’s in some way meaningful to the two of you.
Chapter 6 can help you blue-sky the possibilities, and the rest
of Part II offers specific recommendations.
 How long should we wait to book the wedding? The sooner,
the better. If you have your hearts set on Santorini in Greece,
you may have to wait two years or longer to nail down a 
date at a preferred place. Saturday nights everywhere book 
up fastest. But you can always get married tomorrow in 
Las Vegas.
 Is it wrong to e-mail save-the-dates? If everyone on your
guest list has e-mail and checks it regularly, go ahead, but that
means forgoing tangible ones that provide a lasting remem-
brance. See Chapter 12 for more info on save-the-dates.
Part I: Marrying Your Way: Away You Go 
14

 How do we handle friends and family with kids if we want
to keep the wedding adults-only? And what do we tell
people who expect to be invited — but aren’t? One of the
advantages of destination weddings is that people expect
them to be smaller than at-home ones, so they usually under-
stand. Read about who to invite and who to leave at home in
Chapter 12 — and how to communicate those decisions grace-
fully in Chapter 16.
 Which last name should be on the bride’s first passport:
maiden or married? You can’t legally change your name until
after you’re married (unless you go to court to do so before-
hand). To avoid confusion, I advise you to keep all ID and
travel documents in the same name until you return. Find out
how to get a passport in Chapter 11.
 Is it tacky to get married in Las Vegas? At the AAA Five-
Diamond Award-winning Bellagio hotel, wedding packages
range in price from $1,500 to $15,000. They’re definitely not
tacky, nor are chapels inside Las Vegas’s other top casino
hotels. Discover the real deal on Vegas weddings in Chapter 7.
 Do we need a wedding planner? If you’re having a small wed-
ding at a hotel or chapel that provides its own wedding coor-
dinator, absolutely not. However, bigger events and ones in
more-remote locations where weddings aren’t an everyday
occurrence require local assistance. See Chapter 5 on assem-
bling your wedding team.
 How important is visiting the destination before the wed-
ding? Checking out your location prior to the festivities can
help set your mind at ease. But as long as you have someone
in the location working on the wedding on your behalf, you
plan to get there ahead of time, and you’re not a control freak,
visiting isn’t essential. Again, the bigger the wedding, the
more advance planning is required, which argues in favor of
having your feet on the ground well before your event.
 How long do we have to entertain wedding guests after the
ceremony? Typically, the reception follows the ceremony and
then a farewell brunch takes place on the last official day of
the wedding. After that, they’re on their own (and so are the
two of you!). Chapter 15 offers tips on entertaining guests
throughout their stay.
 Who pays for what? Couples usually pay for their own desti-
nation weddings, sometimes with assistance from family.
Guests pick up the tab for their travel and lodging. Chapter 4
is dedicated to budgeting, so you can find more answers to
financial questions there.

Seeing stars: Celebrity 
destination weddings
Nearly ten years ago model Cindy Crawford and nightclub impresario Rande Gerber
had a barefoot wedding at a beach resort in the Bahamas. She wore a short white
gown, and he stood up in a white shirt and Armani pants. Photographs of their happy
day attended by a few close friends and family members circulated around the
world, inspiring thousands of other couples to choose an easy, breezy destination
wedding for themselves.
Crawford and Gerber weren’t the first stars to get married away, and they certainly
won’t be the last. But they’re in good company. The following couples also said their
vows far from home:
 Ashley Judd and Dario Franchetti: Skibo Castle, Scotland
 Avril Lavigne and Deryck Whibley: Montecito, California
 Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner: Parrot Cay Resort, Turks & Caicos
 Bill Gates and Melinda French: Four Seasons Lanai, Hawaii
 Brett Hull and Darcie Schollmeyer: Esperanza Resort, Los Cabos, Mexico
 Christiane Amanpour and Jamie Rubin: Odescalchi Castle, Bracciano,Italy
 Christina Aguilera and Jordan Bratman: Staglin Family Vineyards, Napa Valley,
California
 Duke and Duchess of Windsor: Château de Candé, Loire Valley, France
 Eva Longoria and Tony Parker: Paris, France
 Gwen Stefani and Gavin Rossdale: St. Paul’s Church, Covent Garden, England
 Heidi Klum and Seal: Puerto Vallarta, Mexico
 John Lennon and Yoko Ono: Gibraltar
 Liv Tyler and Royston Langdon: private villa, Barbados
 Madonna and Guy Ritchie: Skibo Castle, Scotland
 Pink and Carey Hart: Costa Rica
 Tiger Woods and Elin Nordegren: Sandy Lane Resort, Barbados
 Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes: Odescalchi Castle, Bracciano, Italy
 Tori Spelling and Dean McDermott: Wakaya Island Resort, Fiji
 Reba McEntire and Narbel Blackstock: Lake Tahoe, Nevada
 Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr.: Jalisco, Mexico
 Sylvester Stallone and Jennifer Flavin: Oxfordshire, England

 How can we transport a wedding gown without it getting
completely wrinkled? Tissue paper, tissue paper, and more
tissue paper. Turn to Chapter 14, devoted to wedding wear, for
tips from the pros and selecting a dress that travels well.
 Can the groom still wear shorts if the bride wants to wear a
long gown? Yes — if he’s man enough to bear the scorn and
ridicule of his yet-unborn children when they’re old enough to
view mom and dad’s wedding pictures. For specific advice on
what guys can wear, head for Chapter 14.
 Does the captain marry couples on a cruise ship? Only cap-
tains of Princess ships are permitted to do so. On other cruise
lines, couples are married by a regular officiant when the ship
is in port. Chapter 10 goes into detail on cruise weddings.
 Will we feel as if we’ve missed out on something if we don’t
get married at home? If you define home as the place where
the most important people in the world are, then anywhere
you bring them together will feel like home. Lots of couples
also plan at-home receptions afterwards. Get ideas for those in
Chapter 17, plus ways to include guests who couldn’t attend.
Getting Going: 20 Steps 
to a Destination Wedding
Even the simplest destination weddings require a degree of plan-
ning. If you follow a logical order in doing things, you can feel less
stressed, work more efficiently, and accomplish all the necessary

Las Vegas chapels attract more celebrities and civilians than anywhere else.
Although not all star weddings have stood the test of time, they certainly seemed like
a good idea at the moment. Vegas wedding alumni include:
 Angelina Jolie and Billy Bob Thornton (divorced)
 Britney Spears and Jason Alexander (annulled after 55 hours)
 Demi Moore and Bruce Willis (divorced)
 Elvis Presley and Priscilla Beaulieu
 Jon Bon Jovi and Dorothea Hurley
 Kelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos
 Natalie Maines and Adrian Pasdar
 Paul Newman and Joann Woodward (50 years and still going strong).

tasks on schedule. How much time do you need to set everything
up? That depends entirely on you and how complex the wedding
you have in mind is.
Breaking down the process to 20 steps, these are the major 
milestones:
1. Decide that a destination wedding is right for you.
2. Choose possible dates.
3. Consider where to go.
4. Select a destination.
5. Draw up a guest list.
6. Pick a place to wed and a place to stay.
7. Alert friends and family.

Fortunately, I’ve detailed every one of these steps in this book, so
you needn’t feel overwhelmed. (And if I, a destination bride whose
party-organization skills previously were limited to throwing my
dirty clothes in the closet and opening up a jumbo bag of M&Ms
before guests arrived could pull off an event of this magnitude, so
can you.) By referring to this book’s table of contents, you can find
what you need to know, when you need to know it, and how to
make it all work for you.

Is a Destination Wedding
Right for You?
In This Chapter
 Deciding whether a wedding away suits your needs
 Weighing the pros and cons of a destination wedding
 Building support for your decision
A
lthough a destination wedding can be a wonderful occasion,
not every couple planning to get married is cut out for one:
The bride-to-be who dreamed since she was a little girl of having a
wedding in the family church and the groom who figures he only
needs to walk around the corner, utter “I do,” and can be back in
time to catch the end of the game aren’t prime prospects for this
kind of affair. But if the idea of having a destination wedding
appeals to you, this chapter explains how an out-of-the-ordinary
may suit the two of you.
Why a Wedding Away May 
Work Best for You: The 3F’s
Reasons to have a destination wedding abound. Perhaps you don’t
have the time or inclination to spend the better part of a year plan-
ning a wedding. Or although your budget is small, you want a wed-
ding with style. Or you have family issues that can be eased by
locating the wedding in a neutral place — that just happens to
have a climate you love.
If you’re less concerned with doing what’s conventional and more
with doing what feels right to you personally, being a “runaway”
bride and groom may be as practical a decision for you as it is a
romantic one.

The “3F’s” — freedom, flexibility, and fun — are the greatest incen-
tives to choose a destination wedding. This section takes a closer
look at each of them.
Freedom (from convention)
Whether small or large, casual or less so, a destination wedding
provides you with the freedom to be yourselves and shape your
wedding, your way. How do you know whether a destination 
wedding is right for you? They’re popular with and ideal for:
 Couples who are slightly older: As maturity increases, so
does the desire to have an event that is more a reflection of
your own taste and lifestyle than your parents’. And that’s a
cornerstone of weddings away.
 Couples who have been married before and don’t want to
replicate the white-dress, dad-walks-the-bride-down-the-aisle,
and we-all-eat-rubber-chicken-afterward routine: Anyone
who’s been there and done that may be excited by the prospect
of going someplace new and marrying in a different way.
 Couples with children: Relocating everyone to the neutral ter-
ritory of a family-friendly, all-inclusive resort or cruise for the
wedding is an excellent way to help a blended family bond.
 Couples who value privacy and simplicity above all: Many
who choose a destination wedding invite no guests at all yet
experience a beautiful and meaningful ceremony with simply
the officiant and local witnesses present.
Flexibility (to do it your way)
The most beautiful thing about destination weddings (besides the
surroundings) is that you don’t have to follow hard-and-fast rules
regarding how the wedding looks or feels or how long it lasts.
Simply by inviting guests to a faraway place, they expect some-
thing different. That also means elements you’ve witnessed at
other weddings and don’t particularly like can be tossed away like
the traditional bride’s garter. Instead, you can create your own tra-
ditions. And no one will ever be able to say your wedding was a
cookie-cutter affair. Thanks to a destination wedding’s flexibility,
you aren’t tied down to the old rules. Consider some examples:
 The dress code: Find the idea of wearing Vera Wang or wing-
tips too constricting? Nowhere does it say you can’t don
island gear and flip flops (or go barefoot altogether) to pledge
your love. Chapter 14 looks at stylish options.
Part I: Marrying Your Way: Away You Go 
20

 The convenience of having the ceremony and reception in the
same place, if that appeals to you: Destination weddings that
take place at beach or mountaintop resorts, for example, usually
have an altar or other area dedicated to ceremony space. At
adjacent restaurants, terraces, and elsewhere on the premises,
the entire group can celebrate afterward. Alternatively, if you
want to separate the two events by miles, hours, or even days,
all you need to do is plan it that way. (Check out Chapter 12.)
 The ease of planning: Many hotels in resort areas are experts
in orchestrating the entire event for you — right down to the
food, music, flowers, and decorations. Some offer a free week-
end stay so couples can come and discuss how to customize
the wedding.
Fun (that’s the key)
Although the word wedding may bring a sparkle to your eyes, the
word vacation makes everyone perk up. And that’s basically what a
destination wedding is: The best vacation you can imagine in a
place you’ve hand-picked, in the company of your favorite people,
filled with events you select and activities you enjoy, and capped
by a party that suits your taste, style, and interests.
Pinpointing Destination 
Wedding Delights
If the 3F’s in the previous section don’t convince you to apply for a
passport (find the lowdown on that in Chapter 11) and start pack-
ing, consider the following advantages of having a destination 
wedding may.
Arousing your adventurous side
Do the two of you like the beach? If you haven’t yet tried surfing,
water-skiing, or snorkeling, would you like to? Do you strap on ski
boots and head for the hills as soon as the first snowflakes drop?
Would you relish the idea of horseback riding across rugged ter-
rain? If so, you may want to combine your destination wedding
with a fun-packed weekend of adventure.
Couples who welcome new experiences find destination weddings
to their liking. The adventure can extend from the location you
choose to the places where you hold your ceremony and reception
to the activities you select for yourselves and your guests.
Chapter 2: Is a Destination Wedding Right for You? 21

Planning an active wedding includes organizing activities, so be
sure to choose a destination that offers a lot to do. (You can find
location inspiration in Chapter 6.) If you love the outdoors, lead
your family and friends down to the beach, aboard a sailing ship,
or aloft in a hot-air balloon. Just imagine how extraordinary the
photos will be!
Most beach resorts offer instruction and equipment that enable
guests to try water sports such as windsurfing, paragliding, and
water-skiing as well as snorkeling, scuba diving, canoeing, and
kayaking. Depending on the destination and season, on-land adven-
turers may want to choose a destination that includes horseback
riding, hang gliding, zip lining, mountain hiking, biking, golf, tennis,
or skiing. And with today’s emphasis on wellness, locating a place
that offers power walks, yoga, Pilates instruction, and spa treat-
ments isn’t difficult.
Combining your wedding 
and honeymoon
When time and money are important considerations (and when
aren’t they?), having a destination wedding as a prelude to a hon-
eymoon is one of the most cost-effective planning choices a couple
can make.
Whether you’re so in love with your destination that you intend 
to remain there after your guests clear out, or it’s the first of one
(or multiple) locations you plan to visit on your honeymoon, as 
Mr. and Mrs. you’re already packed and in travel mode. Chapter 18
has specific honeymoon-planning advice.
Sharing the fun with your 
friends and family
When was the last time you spent a long weekend — not just a
quick cup of coffee or a dinner meal — catching up with the people
you love most? If the answer is “too long ago” or “I don’t remem-
ber,” a wedding away presents the perfect time to rendezvous.
Combining your wedding with a gathering of family or close college
friends in a setting where people are at ease and in a celebratory
frame of mind is an event both you and your guests will cherish.
And after everyone arrives, group events — picnics, beach parties,
hot tubbing, and simply banding together to watch the sunset or
the stars come out — make indelible memories.

Earning perks and upgrades 
because you’re in love
If you’re planning a wedding or honeymoon, announce it to the
world — not simply because everyone loves a lover, but because
you’re entitled to benefits you may not even know about. These
benefits can include VIP treatment at hotels, especially when you
can reserve a block of rooms for your guests. In fact, hotels offer
perks and upgrades for one smart reason: to build customer loy-
alty. They want you to come back again for your anniversary, with
your kids, and on your next vacation.
Perks start becoming valuable when the length of your stay or the
size of your guest list grows. If you can gather ten people or more
to take the same flight together, most airlines extend a discounted
rate to all. In some cases, they upgrade you from coach to business
or first class. Each airline has its own rules. Although you may be
able to find the benefits listed on an airline’s Web site, you nor-
mally have to phone a representative to activate the offer. Turn to
Chapter 11 for more about planning group travel and taking advan-
tage of these perks.
Hotels operate in much the same way as airlines when it comes to
discounts. If your guests can occupy a minimum of ten rooms,
inform the property. Ask for a volume discount so that guests in
each room pay less than if they would have booked individually.
This price difference could be the deciding factor between a trip
that’s affordable for a guest and one that isn’t.
In addition to a hotel offering a group discount, the management
may also be willing to upgrade your quarters to larger ones, throw
in a complimentary hospitality suite, or waive the fee for your cere-
mony space — even if the two of you are traveling alone. In all
instances, asking nicely for the added value never hurts.
To receive special treatment, ask about romance packages when
you book your room. A hotel that’s really on the ball delivers a
fruit basket, perhaps sparkling wine, or even strawberries dipped
in chocolate to rooms of wedding and honeymoon couples without
asking them in advance or charging extra. Some hotels may even
surprise you with rose petals on your bed when you return from
dinner. To ensure you receive such amenities, you may have to
request them in advance and pay an additional fee, though.
Chapter 2: Is a Destination Wedding Right for You? 23

Other advantages
In addition to the preceding benefits of a having a wedding away,
you can also consider these selling points:
 Saves time: Many destination weddings are turnkey affairs: You
pick a hotel or resort, you connect with the property’s free on-
site wedding coordinator, and you can set up your entire cere-
mony, reception, and accommodations via phone or e-mail.
 Obsessive planning not required: You can pull together 
a small wedding quickly in plenty of places (including 
Las Vegas, Hawaii, and the Bahamas).
 Less stress: If the idea of going from place to place to sample
menus and listen to musicians and meet with photographers
drives you mad, avoid it by opting for a wedding package
where choices are limited and everything is provided.
 Money goes further: Even after factoring in the cost of airfare
and lodging, a destination wedding can be cheaper than one
at home.
 Choose your climate: You can have a sizzling ceremony in
January or chill in August; having a perfect wedding is just a
matter of picking a place where the weather’s fine (turn to
Chapter 6 for help on selecting a location).
 Nature does the decorating: No need to splurge on flowers or
other decorations in a gloriously scenic setting.
 Cultural exchange: A wedding in a different country enables
you to integrate local foods, flowers, and customs.
 Mixed-marriage solution: A civil marriage away from home
provides an ideal solution for interfaith couples.
What a Destination Wedding 
Isn’t: The Downsides
Yes, you can find many wonderful reasons to plan a wedding away.
But be aware there are negatives, too. Understand both sides
before you arrive at a decision. This list includes many of the
downsides. Be aware of them before you make your decision about
whether a destination wedding is right for you.
 Few familiar touchstones: Those who’ve always imagined
marrying in their hometown, or carrying flowers from a
friend’s garden, or even having their hair done by the one styl-
ist who knows how to manage it forfeit the comforts of home.
Part I: Marrying Your Way: Away You Go 
24

 Guest expenses: Weddings away are more costly for wedding-
party members and guests to attend than a wedding at home.
 Requires crowd control: To stay within budget, you may have
to trim the size of your guest list (although for some couples,
this is a major plus). Guests usually assume the costs of their
travel and lodging, but you’ll be expected to pick up other
expenses — including paying for them at the reception (cater-
ers charge a per-person rate), excursions you organize, and
perhaps their rehearsal dinner meal and bar tabs.
 Inconvenience: Not everyone you want to celebrate with will
be willing and able to travel during the time your event is
scheduled. A wedding away requires guests to spend more
time away from home and work and may conflict with planned
vacations or business meetings.
 Long-distance planning: Even if you make one or more 
trips to the destination before the wedding, you still need to
do a fair amount of planning from home, which can lead to
misunderstandings.
 Local marriage laws: Some municipalities make it simple for
nonresident couples to marry. Others require a long residency
period or only allow marriages between citizens. Symbolic wed-
dings (see Chapter 6) are one way to overcome this challenge.
Are You a Destination Wedding
Kind of Couple? A Checklist
If you haven’t already decided whether a destination wedding is
right for you, see how many of the following describe you. Answer
“yes” to a majority, and you most likely will be happy with a 
wedding away.
❑We’re on a tight budget.
❑We like to travel.
❑We hope to keep our wedding intimate.
❑We want our wedding to take place in an unusual setting.
❑We think of ourselves as more casual than formal.
❑We have friends and family scattered across the country.
❑We believe that our closest friends and family want to 
celebrate with us wherever we hold the wedding.
❑We’re willing to have a wedding in a place we haven’t visited
before or have only seen once or twice.
Chapter 2: Is a Destination Wedding Right for You? 25

❑We aren’t control freaks: We realize that we may not be able to
manage all the details of a destination wedding as hands-on as
we would at one at home.
❑We appreciate cultural differences.
❑We want a wedding that enables us to combine our wedding
and honeymoon trips or simply start our honeymoon sooner.
❑We aren’t sentimental about the past; we want to create new
traditions.
If this checklist clarifies that you’re cut out to be a destination
wedding type of couple, now the fun really begins. Chapter 6 can
help you determine a destination that’s right for you.
Dealing with Doubts and Doubters
Even when you’re 100 percent convinced that a destination wed-
ding is right, your other half may still be on the fence. He may have
a preconceived notion about a destination wedding, or she may
not like the idea of getting married in a strange place. Forcing an
opinion on someone else is never a good idea, but by understand-
ing the obstacles, you may be able to reach an accord. This section
helps you handle a doubter.
When your partner still isn’t certain
As couples begin talking about the kind of wedding they want, dif-
ferences of opinion emerge. That’s natural, so don’t be surprised if
you both don’t automatically agree on having a destination wed-
ding. Ultimately, though, both of you must be in agreement about
having a wedding away before taking further steps.
If your other half is teetering and not quite sure, discuss both sides
and see what elements of a wedding away you can agree upon —
consider it good practice for marriage. Another suggestion —
which may sound crazy at first — is to switch roles. Have the one
who doesn’t want the destination wedding provide reasons to do
it, and have the destination wedding fan voice all the objections.
By articulating one another’s concerns, you may both become
more aware and more comfortable with whether or not you should
embark on a wedding away.
Part I: Marrying Your Way: Away You Go 
26

Is your other half dead set against a destination wedding? Then
don’t force it. Or if making a nontraditional choice makes either of
you uncomfortable, get married at home. Nothing is worse than
traveling to a place where you don’t want to be — or feeling as if
you’ve dragged the person you love there unwillingly.
Preparing for pushback
Although every couple hopes people will be supportive of their
decision to have a wedding away, the idea of traveling a consider-
able distance for a wedding may alarm some guests. So you may be
in for a surprise when you start sharing your intentions with your
nearest and dearest.
Chapter 2: Is a Destination Wedding Right for You? 27
Flying — and those who fear it
You may hear the strongest objections to having a destination wedding from people
who resist boarding an airplane. Some may have never flown, while others may
have flown and had a bad experience either in the air or delayed at an airport.
Whatever the reason for such feelings, respect them. Travel, even the prospect of it,
stresses some people out. Nonetheless, other people’s travel trepidations shouldn’t
deter you from planning a wedding away. When you or your guests truly want to
celebrate your marriage away from home, but need some encouragement, these
suggestions may help ease the journey:
 If the bride or groom is afraid, don’t select a destination you can only get to by
flying — that location isn’t for you.
 Pick a destination that can be reached multiple ways (such as by car, train, 
private rented van or motor coach, and so on).
 Call the local airport and ask for a referral to a fear-of-flying desensitization
course.
 Ask a physician to prescribe anti-anxiety medication to take before boarding.
 Have a drink to relax you before boarding the plane (unless on medication).
 Choose direct flights whenever possible, so that you’ll spend less time in the air
and avoid the confusion of switching planes.
 Fly at off times, including midweek and very early in the day; those times are
known to have fewer delays to stress out nervous travelers.
 Buy a business- or first-class ticket or ask a frequent flyer you know to sell or
donate mileage to you in order to get an upgrade. A better seat and more atten-
tion from the flight crew can ease your mind.

Will they say you’re running away? Maybe. But look at it more like
you’re running toward something — the start of a life together, doing
things your way. In the event you encounter resistance from family
and friends and feel you need to defend your decision, Table 2-1

 Understanding why organization is important
 Organizing your destination wedding planning digitally
 Working with plans you can hold in your hands
W
hen you enter the planning stage of a destination wedding,
a funny thing happens: The possibility that you actually can
pull off this incredible event starts to feel real. It’s exciting.
Intoxicating. And it can also seem overwhelming.
In addition to all the major decisions an engaged couple needs to
make — when to have the wedding, who to invite, what to wear,
and so on — you also need to research locations and work out
travel plans. That adds a level of complication.
Does that mean you require the global knowledge of a geography
teacher, the booking ability of a travel agent, the negotiating skills
of a lawyer, and the organizational expertise of an executive assis-
tant to successfully plan an out-of-town wedding? Absolutely not!
But it does mean that you need to solicit information, categorize it,
and be willing to devote time to evaluating the different options.
Despite the decisions awaiting you, you can pull this off — 
especially if you start by getting organized. The reward will be an
event that is beautiful, well-coordinated, and to your taste. This
chapter covers the importance of being organized and options to
get you there to make your destination wedding everything you
wish.

The Importance of Being Organized
and Where to Start
Every wedding is the result of hundreds of details and decisions
large and small, which can at times challenge the brightest bride’s
wits and the most buttoned-down groom’s memory.
Which place offers a free wedding when you pay for a weeklong 
honeymoon: Is it in Jamaica . . . or Antigua? Where did I see the ad
for those shell-embossed invitations? How much did the musicians
say they would charge if we book them for both the rehearsal dinner
and the reception?
Questions like these can keep a bride- and groom-to-be awake at
nights. But if you get organized at the beginning of the destination
wedding planning process, you can access the information when
you need it — and sleep more peacefully.
What’s the danger of throwing everything you receive into a manila
folder or keeping it stacked somewhere at home? Doing so wastes
your valuable time when you have to rifle through the same mate-
rial every instance you need to find something. Worse, data can get
misplaced or lost.
To keep your pre-wedding stress to a minimum, commit to keeping
all the info you solicit organized. Not only can you find it when you
need it, but you also show your spouse-to-be that you’re someone
who can be counted on to come through with the goods. This sec-
tion can help you get started.
Leading with your strengths: 
The division of labor
Which of you should be responsible for doing most of the planning
for the destination wedding? Although couples often make the big
decisions mutually, someone still has to “keep the books.”
One of you may be a natural event planner and know right away
how to start organizing your destination wedding. If that’s you, go
for it. If you’re both novice party planners, decide which of you has
the most available time, the better organizational ability, and the
greatest affinity for the task.

Doing all the organizing yourself 
or strictly relying on a pro
Invitations! Food! Music! Overnight hotels! Rehearsals! Contracts!
Logistics! If the thought of organizing all the details for your desti-
nation wedding seems too much to handle, you may want to hire a
professional wedding planner. Although you’re the ultimate organ-
izer for your wedding, a wedding planner can coordinate the vari-
ous elements that you want and ensure they operate in harmony.
These individuals, who are experienced in organizing parties, wed-
ding ceremonies, receptions, and travel arrangements, can be
found locally where you live, online, and on the ground in the place
where you want to hold the wedding. One online resource is www.
theweddingexperience.com, a company that specializes in desti-
nation weddings and offers a free consultation.
Another option to consider is calling upon a wedding coordinator at
a hotel or resort where you’d like to host your event. Services pro-
vided by these women (and 99 percent are female) are typically free
to customers and extend from the initial planning stage through the
expediting of marriage documents all the way to the reception. You
can expect a staff planner at these places to present a ready-made
menu of choices you can make to personalize your event.
If you do hire a planner, make sure that you feel comfortable with
her at your initial meeting and understand the terms of her fee
upfront. Part of having a good working relationship includes trust-
ing a planner to understand your taste and the level of involvement
you want to have in the decision-making process. (Check out
Chapter 5 for how to hire a planner.)
Choosing an organizational 
system that works for you
Are you someone whose laptop is never far away, and you keep the
most important details of your life on it? Or are you more of an I-
need-to-see-it-to-believe-it, hold-it-in-my-hands type of info gath-
erer? Perhaps you’re a bit of both. Either way, you need to figure
out a method to stay organized that is best for the two of you.
You basically have the following two choices of how to organize
your destination wedding:
 The digital route: This method depends on computer-based
record-keeping. A digital planner is best if
Chapter 3: Organizing Your Wedding Away 31

• You both have personal computers and fast and reliable
Internet access.
• You can easily create folders and file documents on a
computer.
• You’re familiar with and can open common types of files,
including documents (.doc), spreadsheets (.xls), music
(.mp3), and pictures (.jpg).
 The hard-copy, paper route: This approach uses an old-
fashioned filing system. A paper organizer is best if
• You’re both tactile, and you like to see and touch every-
thing, from contracts to invitation copy.
• You don’t mind regularly updating a three-ring binder or
accordion folder.
• You want to circulate brochures and other documents to
family members who aren’t computer savvy.
• You like to use a large piece of paper to work out ele-
ments like seating charts; it helps you to visualize things.
• You plan to hold on to pieces you receive to create a
wedding scrapbook in the future.
Regardless of what route you take, you may still need to use a com-
bination of each. For example, the hotel may e-mail you an invoice,
but a local vendor may give you a hard-copy written receipt. You
need to organize some info in your computer and some in a paper
organizer. Just remember to cross-reference when you file some-
thing in each format.
Decide early on in what format you primarily want to collect desti-
nation wedding information. That way you have time to establish a
system before the flow of info turns into a deluge — and you know
just where to file it after it starts to spill into your real or electronic
mailbox.
To determine whether you ought to rely more heavily on digital or
manual organizing, ask yourself the following questions:
 What will be the easiest way to share info with my partner
and provide a way for him or her to add to and comment on
it? Make this decision together. It’s good practice for marriage!
 Do we see each other almost every day? If so, then either
system will work for you. If not, and you’re both online, go the
digital route.
 Are my partner and I most likely to call, e-mail, text, or send
an instant message when we have something to tell each
Part I: Marrying Your Way: Away You Go 
32

other? If you prefer the electronic methods of communication,
go digital. Otherwise you’ll be more comfortable establishing
a paper trail.
The bottom line: Whether you decide to coordinate your wedding
primarily on your computer or in a paper planner, stay organized.
The rest of this chapter looks more specifically at these two
options to help you keep track of your destination wedding.
Love in the Computer Age:
Digitally Organizing
According to a recent statistic, more than three-quarters of couples
research their wedding online. So if you’re a tech-savvy duo about to
plan a destination wedding, you already know that a personal com-
puter can be your best tool and the Internet your best resource.
This section focuses on steps to organize your wedding digitally,
including setting up and keeping track of all the details on your per-
sonal computer and using the Web to research your wedding.
If you’re not ready to go digital, don’t despair. You have ways to get
around that and still harness the power of the Web to help you find
potential vendors and locations. Check out “Organizing Your
Wedding with a Paper Trail,” later in this chapter for more info.
Create a destination wedding folder
To begin digitally organizing, you must first designate a central
place where you can keep all the important info. The best place for
you to keep any wedding info is in a new destination wedding folder
that you create on your (or your partner’s) computer or online.
One program that helps you manage your info is Microsoft Excel.
This powerful spreadsheet program can help you to organize wed-
ding planning, maintain your budget, keep an eye on your invita-
tion list and record RSVPs, and compare offerings from a variety 
of vendors. (Check out Chapter 4 for more on how you can use
Excel to track key info, including your budget.) If you’re somewhat
familiar with Excel but just need a refresher, check out http://
spreadsheets.about.com, which offers free tutorials and inspira-
tion for different ways to slice and dice your data. These sections
outline where and how to set up your wedding folder.
Chapter 3: Organizing Your Wedding Away 33

Keep your info on your personal computer
If you each have your own computer, you can store and send files
online (see the next section). If you’re not comfortable doing that,
get a portable flash drive (a small, inexpensive extra storage device
you can plug into any computer’s USB port). You can copy the
entire destination wedding folder or just selected folders onto it,
and pass the drive back and forth.
Don’t risk losing hours of research and important contacts. Back
up your destination wedding folder to a CD or a portable flash
drive on a regular basis; don’t depend on a backup copy on the
personal computer where the original folder lives. The only crash-
ing you want to do is when the wedding is over!
Store files online
You can share files by storing them online so that they’re accessi-
ble at any time by either one of you. Here are some ways that your
entire wedding folder can live in cyberspace and you can jointly
access it from any location:
 If you have an Apple computer, you can sign up and pay for a
Mac account (www.apple.com/dotmac). You can use this
account to transfer, open, work on, and retrieve files online.
 PC users can take advantage of www.youos.com, which is a
free file-sharing site.

Getting an e-mail account 
just for wedding details
Changing your e-mail address before the wedding — at least when using it for 
wedding-related communications — is a good idea. As an engaged couple, you’re
a prime target for vendors eager to sell you everything from attendants’ gifts to xylo-
phone rentals. Every time you sign up for something or request information, your
e-mail address may be compiled on a list, sold to others, and soon you may be 
deluged with unsolicited pitches.
So instead of cluttering up your regular e-mail address, get a new one. Free e-mail
accounts are available from Yahoo!, MSN (Hotmail), Google, and AOL. Just remem-
ber to check yours regularly after you set it up and save important e-mails in the
proper folder (see the section “Create a destination wedding folder”). After the 
wedding, you can decide to keep or abandon the account, depending on whether
or not spammers are targeting it.

 On www.foldershare.com, users of both Mac and PC operat-
ing systems can view the same personal info from two differ-
ent online locations.
Organize your folders and files
Even before you have information to file away, you ought to set up
subcategories within your destination wedding folder. That way,
you can house all your information logically and thematically. For
example, you can place all your top picks for wedding ceremony
sites in a Potential Destinations folder, put spreadsheets in a
Budget folder, and so on.
Create as many folders as you like. Figure 3-1 shows what your
folders and files can look like after you label them.
Folders can hold every kind of file you receive. In this multimedia
world, you can view JPEGs of locations, choose music based on
MP3s, and watch a digital video of another couple’s wedding. You
can then save and store these files in folders along with important
e-mails, Web pages, Word documents, and other digital files.
Figure 3-1: A sample destination wedding 
folder setup.
At any point, add new folders and subfolders as needed. Just don’t
throw anything important out. Instead, create a new folder for it —
call it Discards — and store unwanted files there instead. You never
know when you’re going to want to go back and re-examine some-
thing you found weeks earlier.

Use the Web to your advantage
Connecting to the Internet is one of the best things about having a
computer at your fingertips. For a couple who has decided to wed
far from home, you have no easier means than Web-surfing to
locate potential vendors and places for your event.
By being as specific as possible, you can get to information you
want more quickly, and you aren’t plagued by the prospect of
having to choose from millions of potential Web sites whose legiti-
macy can’t be proven until verified. (Check out the nearby sidebar,
“Surfer beware,” for more info.)
For example, searches on Google and Yahoo! can bring a world of
possibilities to your desktop. When you’re searching, try to narrow
down the search by adding specific keywords. For example, if I
searched with the keywords sarasota florida wedding, Google reduced
the possibilities to a still-overwhelming 1,290,000 pages. But sarasota
florida wedding florist affordable boutonnière found only 126 pages.
Bookmark Web pages
Whenever you come across a Web site that has info you think you
can use, bookmark it. Perhaps you find the homepage of a destina-
tion wedding planner, or the specific marriage requirements of a
country you hope to marry in, or a bridesmaid gown you want
your attendants to view. When you have the Web page stored, you
can access it at will.
You can bookmark a Web page in the following ways:
Part I: Marrying Your Way: Away You Go 
36
Surfer beware
When you’re using the Web to organize your wedding, approach what you find with
a degree of healthy skepticism. Commercial Web sites that promote wedding loca-
tions and services are designed to appear tantalizing and generate sales. You mean
big business to them!
One of the best ways to find out what a place is really like is by reading up on it at
an opinions Web site. For hotel-related information, www.tripadvisor.com is
my favorite because previous guests post firsthand reviews, positive and negative.
By skimming a variety of posts, you can get a more accurate picture of a property
than you would in a brochure prepared by the hotel.

 Use your browser. Make a new bookmark folder called Wedding.
If you don’t know how to do this, use the Help menu in Internet
Explorer, Safari, Firefox, or whichever browser you use and
search for “add bookmark folder” to get instructions. File the
bookmarked page in a Wedding folder in your browser. You can
make subfolders for additional topics within the Wedding folder
as needed.
Bookmarks only exist on the computer where they’re created.
You can’t access your bookmarks from your partner’s com-
puter if the bookmarked site is only on your computer. But
copying the URL and e-mailing it to your partner is easy
enough.
 Save the Web page in your desktop Wedding folder. Doing
so allows you to download the full contents of a page.
However, a URL may disappear or become garbled, and the
Web page only exists on the computer where it’s saved.
To save a Web page into your folder, Go to File ➪Save As, 
navigate to your Wedding folder, and send to the appropriate
subfolder.
 Use a social bookmarking site. A social bookmarking site,
which is a free service for storing, sharing, and discovering
Web bookmarks online, is what I recommend because it lets
you view pages from any computer. By using the search box
on the bookmarking site, you also have the opportunity to 
discover related Web sites real people find valuable.
The most popular social bookmarking site is del.icio.us, 
(pronounced “delicious”). To use this site, do the following:
1. Go to http://del.icio.us and use the prompts to set
up a free account.
2. Follow directions to install the Post to Delicious and
My Delicious buttons on your browser.
3. When you find a Web page worth saving, click on Post
to Delicious.
4. Use the tags Delicious recommends or tag the page
with your own keywords, such as Wedding Invitations
Themes.
Del.icio.us stores all your bookmarked URLs. You can access
your bookmarks from any computer, anywhere. Just be sure
to share your username and password with your partner.
Also, save newspaper articles, which tend to expire, as 
Web-page files rather than on del.icio.us. (I learned this the
hard way.)
Chapter 3: Organizing Your Wedding Away 37

Establish your own destination 
wedding Web site
One of the most creative and memorable ways to start things off
with a splash — to say to family and friends “this is going to be a
wedding you won’t want to miss!” is to create your own destination
wedding Web site (also known as a wedsite).
Having your own wedsite is an efficient way to communicate infor-
mation about the event to friends and family. They may have a mil-
lion questions — when and where is it taking place? Who else is
coming? How do we get there? What should we pack?
You can anticipate those questions and answer them for one and
all on your own wedsite that reflects your personalities. After your
site is live, you can send a mass e-mail to notify family and friends
to visit and then again when you post important updates. If you’re
interested in a destination wedding Web site, this section looks at
the three ways to create one.
Buy a domain
You can actually buy a specific domain name, a Web address or
URL, such as susanandvince.com. Having your own domain
allows you to emphasize your identity as a couple and show off
your personal style. The site can be as simple or as complex as
you want. You can also restrict access to the site to people you
know by requiring a password to enter.
Buying the domain does have its disadvantages. It can be expen-
sive and the setup can be time consuming. Furthermore, you need
some knowledge of Web design and HTML coding.
However, if you’re interested in purchasing a domain and setting
up your own destination wedsite, you can do the following:
1. Choose a unique name (URL) for your site (sorry, “our-
destinationwedding.com” is already taken) and register it
with an online registrar.
Although many online companies sell domain names, 
the most established place to register is www.network
solutions.com. Any domain registrar can tell you whether
the name you want is available and offer alternatives if it
isn’t. After you have a name for your Web site — and you
find that it is available — you can buy it immediately.
Part I: Marrying Your Way: Away You Go 
38

Just for fun, Google your names — such as “jenandmike” or
“lindaandpaul.” Chances are some creative couple already
has the URL, but you can always swipe ideas from them.
2. Find a company to host your domain.
Your Web site will need a place to live online. That’s its
domain. Network Solutions offers that service, but I prefer
www.earthlink.net because it has tools and templates
that can make the site-building process simpler. Another
popular low-cost hosting service is www.godaddy.com.
3. Choose domain options that meet your destination 
wedsite needs.
Other services that you can choose include multiple e-mail
accounts and design help.
Sign up with a wedding Web-site provider
Couples who don’t want to devote time to Web-page design and all
the techy stuff required to develop their own wedding domain can
still have a great-looking wedsite. Numerous online companies
allow you to use their tools and bandwidth to make a site.
Signing up with a wedding Web-site provider is easy. Just follow the
directions on the site. Most provide thorough step-by-step direc-
tions to help you customize your own Web site. You can take
advantage of different tools, including online RSVPs, e-mail
newsletters, and registry links. To protect your privacy, most
require that your guests use a password to access the site.
A wedding Web-site provider isn’t for everyone, though. Pages
from bridal sites tend to have a cookie-cutter look, so take time to
personalize yours with rich details and photos. Also, expect to
receive numerous upsell e-mails from the host. Some charge a fee.
The following are among the best-known and most-reliable compa-
nies where you can sign up for a wedding Web site:
 www.weddingwindow.com
 www.theknot.com
 www.brides.com
 www.blueskiesanddaisies.com
 www.ewedding.com
 www.weddingsolutions.com
Chapter 3: Organizing Your Wedding Away 39

Create a wedding blog
A blog, also known as a web log, is a personal online journal similar
to a diary that you share with the world. You can create a blog with
the specific objective of sharing your thoughts and plans about
your upcoming destination wedding with friends and family. Keep
in mind that a blog is only as good as you make it. If you don’t have
the time to regularly update it, your blog will appear stale.
To set up a blog, follow the directions on the blog setup site. Many
blog setup sites are easy to use and allow you to embed links and
RSS feeds to related sites. (An RSS feed is like a news bulletin from
another Web site that automatically updates itself when new con-
tent is posted.)
My personal favorite site for creating a blog is www.blogger.com
because the service is free and easy to use. And check out www.
weddingbee.com and http://manolobrides.com as examples of
wedding blogs to get a feel for what they look like and how they
work.
What to include on your wedsite
Whether you set up a unique Web domain, use a wedding Web-site
provider, or create a blog, provide your guests with the essential
info they need. Use your wedding Web site to announce the good
news and post details of the upcoming event. The following are
some topics you may want to cover:
 Save the date
 How we met
 Photo gallery
 The proposal
 Our wedding
 Date and location
 Attendants’ photos with IDs
 Guests’ travel information
 Getting there
• Maps and directions
• Places to stay
• Car rental info
• What to see and do in. . .
 Destination wedding schedule (check out Figure 3-2 for an
example of a schedule)

In addition to content you create on your own, include links to
other sites that your guests may find useful, such as www.trip
advisor.com to provide guests with a list of hotels rated by travel-
ers. There are also many useful local sites, such as www.vegas.
com, which provides Vegas-bound guests with information on
shows and buying tickets online.
Join the conversation
As you start making wedding plans, many questions arise. Often
there’s nothing better than talking to another bride-to-be or groom-
to-be — to get recommendations, to help you weigh the pros and
cons of a decision, or simply to send some empathy your way. The
following are different ways you can converse with others.
Meet destination couples online
One of the best places to go for answers, support, and ideas are
free online forums. A forum is a bulletin board where you can ask
and answer questions. You won’t necessarily get a response the
same day, but if the board is active, you will get feedback.
My two recommended forums are on www.brides.com and www.
theknot.com because both have separate areas devoted to desti-
nation wedding discussions. You can also go outside those areas,
of course, to get info on topics of interest to all couples ranging
from food and drinks to honeymoon plans.
As with all forums, lurking for a while is smart. If you have a partic-
ular question, use the search box to see whether it’s already been
answered. If not, register for permission to post, and put your mes-
sage up on the board.
Send group e-mails to friends and family
Are you having a big wedding with lots of attendants, or want to
keep a certain circle in the loop? Then create a group in your
e-mail account in order to (judiciously) send mass e-mails. (That
way, you don’t have to waste time typing in every single person’s
e-mail address every time you send an e-mail.) 
For example, you can send a group e-mail that reads like this:
Hi everyone.
I never thought so many of our friends would agree to join us for
our wedding in Mexico. Tom and I are so thrilled that we aren’t
going to be entering Mexico — or our marriage — alone.
Because there are plenty of details involved and I know you’ll
Part I: Marrying Your Way: Away You Go 
42

need to work out your schedule to make celebrating with us 
possible, I’m starting this wedding e-mail group to keep you
updated. Feel free to ask me any questions by just hitting
“reply”; if it’s something for the group to know or discuss, hit
“reply all.” And to prove that I’m not turning into a bridezilla,
you can unsubscribe from this list at any time. You’ll still be wel-
come at the wedding.
Love,
Stacy (and Tim)
To set up a group, use the Help menu in your e-mail program. After
you’ve created and named the group, drag or enter the e-mail
addresses of everyone you want onto the list. Then save it.
Whenever you want to contact the group, simply type in the
group’s name in the To: box and the e-mail goes to the entire group.
When you send your first e-mail to the group list, introduce it, tell
your gang what to expect, and let people know how to unsubscribe
if they wish. Encourage recipients to reply with questions and com-
ments about the upcoming event.
Chat with friends and family
Don’t save all the good news for the wedding day: On the Web, you
can chat with those who enthusiastically want to anticipate and
help plan the event along with you.
To schedule an online chat with Web-savvy guests, pick a mutually
convenient day and time and invite list members to attend. During
the chat, your guests can ask you any questions they have, and
you can let everyone know the answers, all at one time.
AOL introduced instant messaging and anyone can register for a
free account and use this service. Yahoo! Messenger offers similar
functionality. Whichever you use, you can continue to e-mail during
the chat, even sending images for everyone to see and comment on.
Using the Web When You 
Don’t Have a Computer
The Web is a truly invaluable resource for planning a wedding in a
distant location. Even if you don’t have a computer of your own,
you can still do online research and send e-mail by accessing a
computer in the following locations:
Chapter 3: Organizing Your Wedding Away 43

 Visit the library. Just about every library has at least one
public computer available. If you live in that municipality, you
usually qualify for a library card, which allows you free access
to the library’s computers.
 Log on at an Internet cafe. Usage fees are typically calculated
by the minute, but you often can buy a block of time to save
money.
 Borrow a buddy’s computer. Your friend may be willing to let
you surf the Web when he or she isn’t using the computer.
 Go to a 24-hour FedExKinko’s. Locations that are open around
the clock have Windows and Macintosh workstations with
Internet access that you can rent and use on the premises.
 Use your work computer. Many companies may frown upon
using your work computer for personal use, but face it, most
people do it. Web-surfing a few minutes a day during your
break time usually isn’t a problem. (Ask your boss if you’re
concerned.)
Because you can’t bookmark important sites on someone else’s
computer, print out Web pages you need when you come across
them and file them later in your paper organizer.
Organizing Your Wedding 
with a Paper Trail
Something about using the old-fashioned method of keeping wed-
ding materials in a paper file is still satisfying. Whenever you want,
you can pull out what you need and compare photographs, con-
tracts, and other printed material side by side.
In every bookstore’s Weddings section, you can find a shelf filled
with a variety of organizers you can buy. Some are elaborate,
ribbon-tied affairs as thick as the Manhattan phone book. Some
open to a giant tabbed accordion folder. Others are notebooks
where you can write in information. Still others are three-ring
binders that you can add to as your data pile grows. This section
can help you organize with a paper trail.
Customizing a paper 
wedding planner
Because your wedding isn’t that different from a hometown wed-
ding in that you still need to choose a dress, invitations, flowers,
Part I: Marrying Your Way: Away You Go 
44

food, photography and all the other elements that differentiate a
wedding from, say, a NASCAR race, I’ll leave it to the paper wedding
planner you select to help maintain organization in those areas.
Most store-bought wedding organizers are missing one critical cat-
egory: Travel! Even those that allow a few pages for honeymoon
details aren’t built to accommodate the bulk of info a destination
wedding couple is going to amass. So if you opt for a paper organ-
izer, choose an expandable three-ring binder model. You can pick
up extra dividers, tabs, and pages with pockets to insert in the
book. And don’t hesitate to throw away any preprinted topic you
don’t need; your book will fill up with necessary info soon enough.
To start, I suggest you add these main folders to a standard ring-
binder wedding organizer to transform it into a unit that is destina-
tion wedding friendly:
 Transportation: Whether you and your guests travel by plane,
train, or automobile, you need to keep schedules, tickets, and
transportation resources together in this section.
 Ceremony: Use this folder to hold info that you gather on
potential sites, officiants, and decorations.
 Rentals: If you’re doing it yourself, or at least partly, keep tabs
on where to get tables, chairs, tenting, and so on here.
 Reception options: You may end up having the ceremony and
reception in the same place. If not, stash reception data —
including locations, caterers, food and drink menus, and wed-
ding cake ideas — in this section.
 Accommodations: Where will you, your wedding party, and
your guests stay overnight? Keep all the possibilities under
one roof here.
 Weekend plans: Setting the agenda is up to you. Do you need
to arrange for a rehearsal, rehearsal dinner, and optional
excursions from the destination? File ideas and plans here.
You can also keep track of items you want to include in
guests’ welcome bags, make notes for a printed weekend
agenda, and stash tearsheets from magazines that inspire you.
The larger your destination wedding, the more details you have to
manage and coordinate. As each travel folder grows, subdivide it
as needed so that you remain well organized.
Keep business cards you collect in one place: A vinyl pencil pouch
in the front of your wedding organizer can be a safe place to save
them; you can also buy dedicated business-card holders made for
binders.
Chapter 3: Organizing Your Wedding Away 45

Making your own destination 
wedding organizer
Because you need to customize any store-bought wedding organ-
izer to meet your destination wedding planning needs, does it
make more sense to simply create your own? That’s entirely up to
you. Keep in mind that any money you save can go into creating an
organizer better suited to your needs and style.
To do so, head to the office supply store, pick up a sturdy three-ring
binder, a three-hole punch, a package of dividers, and manila fold-
ers slightly smaller than the binder. You can cut off the tops of
those folders and hole-punch them to create usable pockets. Label
each section accordingly and use the dividers for different sections.
To keep your homemade destination wedding organizer from look-
ing like a high school notebook, do a little decorating at the start.
Here are some fun and inexpensive ideas to dress it up:
 Wrap it: Buy some pretty wedding wrapping paper and cover
the front and back of the binder with it. Laminate the paper
with plastic film to keep it from getting dirty or fraying.
 Decoupage it: Soon enough, you’ll be inundated with travel
brochures. Instead of throwing out the ones you don’t want,
cut out pictures that appeal and decoupage them to the cover.
 Scrapbook it: Your local craft store is likely to have an aisle
with scrapbook supplies that you can adapt to your planning
needs. In addition to finding background sheets that you can
use to staple receipts and other small pieces of paper onto,
wedding-themed stickers, and even rubber stamps, you can
purchase quality three-ring scrapbook binders that outclass
standard ones. And after the wedding, you’ll be ahead of the
game in creating a book of memories.
If you go the all-paper route, you need to keep guests in the loop as
your plans evolve. See Chapter 12 for info on creating timely save-
the-dates, invitations, and wedding newsletters.

Chapter 4
Budgeting for a 
Destination Wedding
In This Chapter
 Considering why and how to construct a budget
 Knowing who pays and finding the funds you need
 Comparing prices and negotiating costs with vendors
 Staying within your means versus going for broke
A
nyone who plans a wedding is bound to come across “The
Number” sooner or later. In case you’ve started here, I pro-
vide it: The average cost of a wedding in the United States today is
in excess of $25,000 dollars. That’s a lot of money — especially for
an event that’s over before you have a chance to sit down, catch
your breath, and savor a piece of your own wedding cake.
When you realize that you could have a destination wedding that
lasts days rather than hours for less than that amount, the notion
of getting on a plane and traveling to a gorgeous location becomes
even more appealing. In fact, you may very likely save money by
leaving home. If you marry at an all-inclusive resort or on a cruise,
for example, you aren’t charged for the ceremony location and you
probably won’t need rental equipment. And the bouquet, cake, and
other extras may be included in one reasonably priced package.
Even though a destination wedding package may be less expensive
than if you paid for a wedding and all the accoutrements at home,
you still need to have a good grasp on how much you plan to
spend. This chapter helps you develop a budget for your destina-
tion wedding and then stick to it.

Understanding Budgeting Basics
(And Why They’re Vital)
Unless you have unlimited funds or simply plan to charge every-
thing and ignore the damages until your credit card bills come in
(not a good idea!), having a budget number in mind for the maxi-
mum amount you can afford to spend on your wedding is wise. You
don’t want to be surprised — and you don’t want to start your
marriage off deeply in debt, either. This section discusses how
budgeting can differ between the two types of weddings and what
you need to do to budget.
How budgeting differs: A destination
wedding versus a traditional one
Although no two weddings are alike and only you can decide what
you can afford to spend based on your own current financial situa-
tion, the way you budget for a destination wedding does differ
slightly from a traditional wedding. (To get a feel for what a typical
wedding would cost where you live, type your zip code into the
calculator at www.costofwedding.com.)
As with any wedding, you have certain basic and unavoidable
costs: The marriage license, officiant’s fee, and wedding rings are
all necessary expenses. What a destination wedding adds to the
mix is the cost of transportation and lodging. The good news is
that most destination weddings still cost less than that daunting
$25,000-or-more figure. So whether you opt for a turnkey event or
one that’s a more complex production, you can likely have a wed-
ding you want, where you want, and at a price you can afford.
Knowing how much to budget
So how can you determine what you can afford and how much you
want to budget for your destination wedding? These suggestions
can help make the process easier:
 Spend time researching real-world prices. Doing so helps
you to know how much to apportion to individual elements or
in total. Make sure you take into consideration costs for items
at your destination. (For example, a bunch of roses may cost
only $20 at the local florist, but flying them to your destina-
tion and having them arranged can cost ten times as much.)
Part I: Marrying Your Way: Away You Go 
48

 Discuss what’s most important to you. Is it having a drop-
dead gorgeous designer wedding gown? As many friends and
family as possible in attendance? A four- or five-star hotel for
the reception and overnights? In advance of obtaining actual
estimates, prioritize how you’ll spend your budget.
Having a budget instills a kind of discipline that forces you to
conserve funds in one area if you want to indulge in another.
After you begin to get an idea of current prices, you can then
decide what the most important elements are and look for
ways to scale back on others.
 Determine which costs are essential and where you can cut
corners. With a destination wedding, travel and lodging can
take up a big chunk of your budget. As a result, you may need
to rejigger what you spend on other aspects of the wedding.
For example, in a hometown wedding, the reception itself typi-
cally eats up 50 percent of the budget. Then flowers, fashion,
photography, and music each account for approximately 
10 percent of the total, leaving the remainder for stationery
and miscellaneous expenses.
You need to add a few more slices to the budget pie to account for
what you spend on transportation, lodging, and perhaps the fee to
rent and set up your ceremony space — and that means the exist-
ing slices will have to shrink as a percentage of your total budget.
Having a Wedding at Any Cost
The type of destination wedding you choose reflects not only your
budget but also your taste. Throughout the process, keep sight of
the fact that you control the purse strings and are the ones who
can best decide whether you’re most comfortable making modest
choices or spending lavishly.
Whatever your final bill adds up to, the experience and memories
of your wedding are likely to be priceless. If you find yourselves
stuck and wondering how you can afford the wedding you want,
consider contacting a financial planner or wedding consultant for
advice. You can find out more about services in Chapter 5.
I believe that you can have a destination wedding just about any-
where you want that can still fit within your budget; it’s just a
matter of determining what your spending priorities are and

Chipping In for a Destination
Wedding
One of the earliest discussions to have regarding the wedding is
about who’s footing the bill. Unlike traditional at-home weddings,
where parents typically play a large part, the couple usually picks
up much, if not all, of the tab at destination weddings. And that’s a
good thing, because whoever controls the purse strings controls
the wedding to a significant degree.
Figuring out who pays for what during a destination wedding can
be a touchy issue, but it doesn’t have to be. You may be wonder-
ing: How much money do you need upfront? Do guests pay their
own way? This section helps you understand these financial issues
without much discomfort.
Finding ways to cover costs
Not many couples have thousands of dollars lying around to fund a
destination wedding. The money has to come from somewhere. If
your lottery tickets don’t pay off, expect to draw on these sources:
 Savings: After you get engaged, establish joint checking and
savings accounts so you can both access them to pay upcom-
ing wedding expenses.
If your wedding date is far enough away, consider having a set
amount automatically deducted from your paychecks each
month and diverted into a new joint account.
 Loan: No collateral is necessary for you to get an unsecured
loan or line of credit from a bank. However, going into debt at
a high rate of interest for the wedding isn’t worth it if you
anticipate struggling to pay the loan off.
 Credit cards: Get a set of credit cards you can both use to pay
wedding expenses. When making payments, using credit cards
is preferable to writing checks because cards provide a third
party to take a dispute to should trouble arise with a vendor.
 Parents: A destination wedding is unlike an at-home one,
where parents’ friends and business associates are typically
invited — so they may be less eager to fund your event.
Depending on your relationship with them, though, it’s worth
having a conversation to ask them if they’re willing to con-
tribute or float you a loan.
Chapter 4: Budgeting for a Destination Wedding 51

Keeping tabs on guests
Regardless of who pays for the ceremony and reception, guests
and attendants at a destination wedding are responsible for their
own room and transportation expenses.
That doesn’t leave you off the hook entirely, though. As soon as
you look into the costs of a destination wedding, you find many
more budget items than plane tickets, lodging, a ceremony, and a
reception to consider. You, rather than your guests, are expected
to pay for the extras, so be sure to factor them into your budget:
 Adding on events or gifts: Gracious touches that make a des-
tination wedding more memorable for everyone involved can
include a welcome or rehearsal dinner, a fun attendants’
event, a generous welcome goody bag, group tours or activi-
ties, and a farewell brunch. But be prepared to cover the costs
of these yourselves.
 Lending a helping hand: Another expense to consider is subsi-
dized travel. Do you have a friend or family member you want
at your wedding who can’t swing the cost? If you can afford to
pay their way, discreetly offer to do so. (See Chapter 18 for how
to let your guests know who pays for what, so that any unap-
proved guest expenses don’t appear on your bill.)
Knowing What to Include 
in Your Budget
During the budgeting process, you may start to wish you’d taken
accounting courses in school (or paid more attention if you did).
Actually, if your eyes glaze over at the sight of numbers, you ought
to involve someone who’s good with them to guide you through
this part. This section helps you keep your budget info organized
with a spreadsheet. It also discusses how you gather bids for dif-
ferent items and what you need to know when you price different
elements.
You can create a spreadsheet in Excel (refer to Figure 4-1) to help
identify potential costs. Because prices vary widely from place to
taste, only you can determine the correct amount to allot.
When you make your own spreadsheet, feel free to use Figure 4-1
as an example to adapt for your own needs. To create and cus-
tomize your own spreadsheet, follow these steps:
Part I: Marrying Your Way: Away You Go 
52

1. Open a new spreadsheet.
2. Save your spreadsheet as “Wedding Budget” to your des-
tination wedding file folder, but keep it open so you can
set up your budget worksheet.
3. Add as many rows as you need with all the potential
expenses.
In Figure 4-1, my list of expenses takes into account every
major possible expense; don’t let it overwhelm you because
it’s unlikely you’ll need them all. The spreadsheet is simply a
guide, and perhaps many of the items listed aren’t necessary
for your own wedding. So add and delete items as needed.
4. Label the first column following each item “guesstimate.”
A guesstimate is where you write down what you hope to
spend. Coming up with these initial cost estimates can help
to clarify where you want your dollars to go and what you
imagine you can spend on the different elements — but
don’t count on the real costs matching. Until you start
speaking to vendors and can insert actual estimates into
the next column, you can’t have a reliable idea of what the
wedding will cost.
5. Label the second column “vendor estimate.”
Vendors’ prices invariably exceed expectations. Even then,
you may want to add a 10-percent cushion that allows for
tax and overages.
As you begin communicating with vendors and receiving
bids, insert actual estimates into the second column. You
can add additional columns to keep track of details such as
your contact person for each item, when the contract is
signed and mailed, the agreed-upon time for delivery or
arrival, and so forth.
6. Label the third column “actual cost.”
This column is something you won’t be able to total until
after the wedding.
After you return home, compare the real costs to the esti-
mates. If it turns out that you’re within 10 percent, congrat-
ulate yourselves for sticking to your budget.
You also may want to add or create a separate spreadsheet to track
deposits that you make, balances, due dates for final payments, and
other expenditures. If you don’t like the spreadsheet format, use a
table in Word, a blank budgeting book, or another record-keeping
method that is more comfortable for you. The important thing is to
watch the bottom line so you can avoid overstepping it.
Chapter 4: Budgeting for a Destination Wedding 53

Bidding and Buying
Requesting bids from at least three vendors before selecting one is
a standard practice in the world of business and is a smart policy
for a couple who is organizing a destination wedding without the
help of a coordinator or consultant to assume this task.
So that you have a solid basis of comparison, send out the same
request for a proposal to each vendor in a category. Provide as
much information as you have, such as the time and location
where you require delivery and make yourself available for 
Part I: Marrying Your Way: Away You Go 
54

follow-up questions (which are always a good sign that someone
truly wants your business and is paying attention).
For example, suppose that you’re requesting bids for a cake. Let
potential vendors know what flavor, filling, and icing you want and
how many people it will need to feed. Tell them whether there’s a
special theme or colors you have in mind and whether you want
them to supply a topper and cake stand. Send a picture of a sample
if you have one.
Pricing the elements
As bids come in, the range of prices you encounter may vary widely
and the features may not be identical, so you need to closely exam-
ine and compare what each vendor offers. During your review,
double-check what vendors offer. If a vendor offers something dif-
ferent than another vendor, ask why she’s suggesting it.
Although you may not think that you need an element that a
vendor recommends, the vendor knows the destination. And in the
long run, it may enhance the day or weekend. For example, having
chilled water bottles available for guests at your ceremony site in
the Caribbean may not have occurred to you, but an experienced
vendor knows thirsty guests will appreciate it.
If one vendor has added on extras that you simply don’t want, ask
her to reprice the bid without the frills. When you have everything
in hand, compare bids side by side and weigh the options you do
want. Be sure to check out the next section on negotiating.
Negotiating wisely
Negotiating during the bidding process is important because you
don’t want to pay more than you have to, and some vendors gross
up their estimate because they assume you’ll ask for a discount.
Keep a couple things in mind as you navigate the bidding and 
purchasing process:
 You may have stars in your eyes, but vendors always see
dollar signs. In the United States alone, weddings represent a
$50 billion annual for-profit industry. All those people whose
talents come into play to help you pull off an extraordinary
event expect to be paid — and the more, the better, as far as
they’re concerned. So no matter how much vendors feed your
fantasy or pressure you, remember the bottom line and don’t
get suckered into paying for more than you want.
Chapter 4: Budgeting for a Destination Wedding 55

 Everything is negotiable. Because the wedding business is so
lucrative, it’s also very competitive. So consider the initial
estimates you receive simply as starting points in negotia-
tions. Don’t be afraid to nicely ask early on, “Can you do a
little bit better on the price?” More often than not, a vendor
responds affirmatively.
 Ask for everything in writing. Be sure that every vendor
writes down his offer, including refund and cancellation poli-
cies, because in a dispute you’ll need to produce the specifics.
You can read more about dealing with vendors in Chapter 5.
Cutting costs
How much you spend on the individual parts of the wedding is
entirely up to you. If you start to feel as if you can’t negotiate or
control costs, take a deep breath. Walk away from the situation
briefly and gather your thoughts. Minor changes in plans can have
a major effect on reducing the bottom line. (You can also check out
Chapter 12 for more on all of these topics in this section.)
The cost of every element in a destination wedding can be adjusted
up or down. For example, you may have to change vendors, or turn
to family or friends to lend a hand, or forego an inessential, but
never forget that you hold the power and the purse strings. The 
following shows how you can save money on major expenses.
Stationery
When you realize how many items accompany announcing, inviting,
informing, and directing people to your wedding, you may feel as if
you’re about to generate more paper than an unabridged edition of
War and Peace. Communications are essential, though, especially
for a destination wedding. Yes, you can easily spend hundreds of
dollars on an expensive printer to produce all your stationery. Or
you can save lots of money and do much of the work on your own.
For example, if you’re creative and have the time or a talented friend
who’s willing to help you out, make your own invitations. Many
office supply stores sell blank wedding invitations that you can
simply run through a computer printer. You can also create your
own newsletter in a predesigned template in a word-processing 
program and print out hard copies or e-mail it to guests.
Flowers
Destination wedding couples have tons of options when buying
flowers. Unfortunately, live flowers can be very expensive. If you’re
Part I: Marrying Your Way: Away You Go 
56

looking to save some money and stay within your floral budget
while still having a beautiful and colorful ceremony, consider the
following suggestions:
 If your wedding is set in a scenic location, such as a gazebo
overlooking the ocean, adding foliage is unnecessary. Rely
on the natural beauty around you to “decorate” your wedding.
 Forego bouquets for the attendants or corsages for the moth-
ers. Although it’s traditional for the bride to carry a bouquet
(because it gives her something to do with nervous hands)
and the groom to don a boutonniere, if you’re looking to save
money, ask yourself if these others really need flowers.
 Choose in-season, locally grown live flowers. These flowers
are cheaper because you don’t have to pay to import them.
Music
Before and after the ceremony and at the reception, music
enhances the occasion. Whether you want to go all-out depends
both on your budget and how important live sounds are to you.
The following suggestions are inexpensive ways to surround your-
selves in sound:
 Supply your own CDs and use the facility’s sound system.
 Download a customized iTunes mix to your iPod, supply your
own speakers, and ask a friend to be the DJ.
 Hire a group from a music conservatory, which is cheaper
than hiring a band.
 Use the house band at a hotel, or perhaps just one or two
players from it, rather than bringing in outside musicians.
Reception
Depending on how many guests attend your destination wedding,
the cost of your reception may rival, if not exceed, that of your
own travel and accommodations. There are mouths to feed! And if
you’re like most couples, you have definite tastes in food and you
want to please and impress those guests, yet you don’t want to
spend a fortune on the meal. Some ways to accomplish that follow.
For example, the day and time when you schedule the party to take
place and the type of meal you serve make a significant cost differ-
ence. Saturday night has always been the most desirable time to
hold a destination wedding ceremony. But nothing keeps you from
having a Friday night event or a Sunday brunch. Investigate to find
out how much a difference a change of day can make.
Chapter 4: Budgeting for a Destination Wedding 57

You may also want to consider changing the type of reception you
have. A more formal reception means more dollar signs, but you
can adjust the menu to meet your budget. For example, instead of
having a seven-course, sit-down meal, you may opt for a festive
dinner buffet. If the amount that you allot can’t fund the event you
envision, then you need to make some tough choices, such as
dropping names from your guest list, scaling back your expecta-
tions, or increasing your budget.
Dealing with deposits
After you accept a bid from a provider, as a show of good faith, the
vendor you select expects to receive a deposit by a certain date,
which should be stipulated in the contract the two of you sign.
Most vendors have a set percentage that they require as a deposit,
such as 25 percent. Paying by credit card is preferable, in case a
dispute arises. Whatever method of payment you use, get a
detailed receipt and keep it in a safe place.
Most deposits are nonrefundable, but if you can convince your
vendor to add a refund policy into the contract, you add a layer of
protection. If not, try to make your deposit as small as possible
and the due date for final payment as far away as you can. Don’t be
surprised if you’re expected to pay in full before the wedding;
that’s typical of event providers.
Part I: Marrying Your Way: Away You Go 
58
Budgeting with foreign currency
If you travel to a place where U.S. dollars aren’t the prevailing currency, you’ll need
to acquaint yourselves with the exchange rate. Use the Universal Currency
Converter (www.xe.com/ucc) to quickly calculate conversions. A bank that deals
in foreign currency can also tell you what the exchange rate is (these rates vary
daily), and you can use a PDA or portable calculator to figure out what a particular
amount is equal to in U.S. dollars. Big luggage stores also sell handheld currency
convertors.
When dealing with foreign vendors, confirm whether their estimates are in local
currency or U.S. dollars. To avoid price fluctuations, encourage them to deal in U.S.
dollars. To get pocket cash that you will need for tips and incidentals, wait until you
arrive at the airport to receive the best exchange rate. Pass up manned foreign cur-
rency desks and exchanges in favor of using an ATM; they have the best rates. Just
make sure that your PIN number is only four digits; longer ones don’t work in all
overseas ATMs. And don’t use your anniversary date; that’s too easy to guess!

B
ack when brides and grooms married at younger ages and wed-
dings were simple affairs held at home or nearby, planning the
wedding was traditionally the job of the bride’s mother. Today
unless Mom is a travel agent or wedding planner with available time,
a couple typically organizes their wedding with help from friends,
family, or professionals — or some combination of the three.
A destination wedding adds a layer of complexity to plans; dis-
tance and time changes can cause confusion, yet you have only
one opportunity to get it all right. So don’t hesitate to reach out for
help and create a team that’s on your side all the way.
To make the event and the months leading up to it less stressful,
delegate as much as possible to qualified people you can trust.
You’re the bride and groom. That’s your job. This chapter can help
alleviate some of your angst about picking the right people for
your destination wedding team.
Identifying the Wedding 
Services You May Need
Destination weddings can be simple one-stop affairs or elaborate
productions. How much help you need depends on where 
you want to wed, the facilities, your budget, and how much 

hand-holding you require. After you know the answers to these
details, you can then turn to the appropriate people for help.
The following list gives you an idea of the major elements involved
in a destination wedding. Seeing this long list of services may drive
home how time-consuming planning a destination wedding can be.
As a result, you may want to consider a turnkey destination wed-
ding package, where just about everything is taken care of for you.
Or if you want certain people to help with specific details, this list
can help you decide which areas you need help with:
 Establishing a budget
 Setting a timetable
 Shopping for and selecting the bride’s and groom’s clothing
 Searching for destinations and unique venues
 Learning and meeting your locale’s marriage requirements
 Booking travel and hotel arrangements
 Deciding on a ceremony space
 Scouting reception sites
 Planning the honeymoon
 Wrangling the officiant and managing the processional
 Tracking invitations and RSVPs
 Conceiving decor, table-top, floral, and lighting design
 Knowing and following etiquette and traditions
 Hiring and supervising a photographer and videographer
 Finding a reception caterer and choosing a menu
 Organizing a rehearsal and rehearsal dinner
 Designing your seating plan
 Ordering a wedding cake
 Choosing musicians and music selections
 Locating on-site hair and makeup stylists
 Coordinating wedding-guest activities
 Organizing wedding-day and guest departure transportation
 Shipping supplies and favors
Part I: Marrying Your Way: Away You Go 
60

Determine which tasks are best left to someone else and those you
would rather handle yourself. Whenever you assign one, try to
make your wishes clearly known and your requests specific — and
keep track of who you asked to do what.
Before you reach out to anyone to help organize your wedding,
make sure you name your budget. Every professional you come in
contact with wants to know this info immediately. If you haven’t
yet decided on a number, using descriptions such as inexpensive,
moderate, or luxurious can start the conversation. (Check out
Chapter 4 for info on establishing a budget.)
Exploring Your Dream 
Team Options
With so much hinging on having a great event, you need to know
who you want helping to plan and execute your wedding away. Are
you the type of couple who is more comfortable calling upon
friends and family for help and support? Or are you most confident
turning over the management of your wedding to a professional?
In many destination weddings, couples cull help from multiple
sources to avoid making costly mistakes and etiquette faux pas. So
your decision doesn’t have to be either/or. But understanding the
skills, advantages, and limitations of the human resources avail-
able to you is valuable.
Using friends and family
Couples naturally turn first to family and friends for help. Sharing
the experience with someone close can make the journey more fun
and less daunting. Anyone you consider asking to take part in the
wedding should be a person you know to be 100 percent depend-
able and flexible enough to put your ideas first.
Before you consider asking friends and family to help, keep the 
following in mind. Using folks you’re close to
 Provides a personal touch.
 Saves money and fees.
 Adds one-of-a-kind accents.
 Allows you to work with people who love you.
 Perpetuates family traditions.
Chapter 5: Gathering Your Destination Wedding Team 61

Using friends and family does have drawbacks:
 Emotions run high, and you can’t fire friends and family 
without repercussions.
 Your loved ones may lack the skill level of a pro.
 They may be more casual than you want about timing and
details.
 Jobs and kids may prevent them from traveling with you on
advance scouting trips to potential destinations.
 Compensation issues can get sticky. (Should you pay them?
Yes — you should offer, and certainly pick up expenses.)
 You may be uncomfortable when you need to address them as
vendors.
 Involving friends and family can curtail their enjoyment of the
wedding as a guest.
 People who you don’t ask to participate may feel left out.
Going with professional planners
You may not have friends or family members who are capable or
available to help plan a wedding away. Or you may want to have
complete control over your wedding and don’t want those folks
offering you their opinions. If so, a professional wedding planner
can help you plan and execute your perfect destination wedding.
Going with professionals also has pros and cons. On the positive
side, destination wedding pros
 Are experienced in producing weddings and comfortable 
handling multiple small details.
 Save you time.
 Can suggest different venues and products that conform to
your ideas and budget.
 Have access to network of vendors and can find new ones
easily.
 Assist in the selection of vendors and coordinate their activities.
 Are willing to travel to your destination on scouting trips and
be present on your wedding day.
Part I: Marrying Your Way: Away You Go 
62

 Can save money by reviewing budget and contracts, making
recommendations, and using negotiating skills.
 Adhere to a code of ethics if they’re members of the
Association of Bridal Consultants (www.bridalassn.com) or
Association of Wedding Professionals (http://afwpi.com).
 Can act as a problem solver and a buffer between family mem-
bers when necessary.
 Are dedicated to bringing your vision to life.
Disadvantages of using professionals include the following:
 Hiring pros can be expensive.
 They often have other clients to juggle.
 Efforts may be duplicated by a property’s free on-site wedding
coordinator.
 A pro’s requests may make you feel as if you as a couple are
late, underfunded, or otherwise inadequate.
Destination Wedding Pros: 
Who Are Your Choices?
Your wedding is (one hopes) a once-in-a-lifetime event; a pro has
been involved with perhaps hundreds and applies her knowledge
of travel, event management, and wedding protocol to help you
make the right decisions.
When it comes to wedding help, there are four major types of
providers who can consult, coordinate, and direct the event: 
wedding planners, travel agents, on-site coordinators, and event
producers. To add to the confusion, you’re likely to see the terms
bridal and wedding, planner and coordinator used everywhere inter-
changeably. This section explains them.
Using a wedding planner
A wedding (or bridal) planner is intended to be your advocate. 
A wedding planner manages the details, the vendors, the event,
and your expectations. When you find one you feel comfortable
with, bring her in as early in the process as possible. These sec-
tions can help you know what to expect.
Chapter 5: Gathering Your Destination Wedding Team 63

Discovering what a wedding planner can do for you
If you simply need someone to help you get started, ask for pre-
wedding planning, which normally involves the development of a
budget and referrals on destinations, sites, and vendors. Whether
you meet with your planner once to get a crash course in organizing
or hire her to coordinate the whole event, a planner should serve to
put you on track and tell you how to stay within your means.
Avoid wedding planners who are paid a commission on the amount
of your money they spend because they only push you to order
more. The best bridal planners charge a fee and work hard to
extract the most value from your budget.
Finding a reputable wedding planner
If you decide to use a wedding planner, the best way to find a good
one is through word of mouth: Do you know a recent couple who
had a destination wedding? Ask if they had a planner and were
happy with her. You can also contact the Association of Bridal
Consultants (www.bridalassn.com) or Association of Wedding
Professionals (http://afwpi.com). If you want a wedding planner
on the ground at your destination, contact the tourism bureau or
local hotels for recommendations. 
Before you hire anyone, ask for three recent recommendations,
and check them, asking what were the planner’s strengths and
weaknesses and how close she stayed to their budget.
Share your vision in terms of decorations, cuisine, music, and so
on with the wedding planner. This is your wedding. And it should
be organized so that you get what you want, just the way you 
picture it. When you look back in 20 years, your fond memories
should be of an event that reflects your taste, not someone else’s.
Enlisting a travel agent
A travel agent has the broadest knowledge of destinations and
resort facilities that can hold a wedding and accommodate guests.
Travel agents are savvy about hotels and can help you and your
entire guest list make the most direct air connections. They ought
to know which beachfront resort is undergoing renovations and
which one just switched from adults-only to family friendly. Agents
may be more effective than you in negotiating prices and benefits.
For the greatest peace of mind, work with a travel agent who has
professional credentials. Agents belonging to the American Society
of Travel Agents (ASTA) follow a code of ethics. Agents who are
experienced in planning destination weddings, such as the pros at
Part I: Marrying Your Way: Away You Go

DestinationWeddings.com (destinationweddings.com), are also
knowledgeable about marriage license and residency requirements
in different places and can help you to navigate the process. 
Chapter 5: Gathering Your Destination Wedding Team 65
Advice from a professional 
destination wedding planner
Would you like to use a professional wedding planner to make your destination wed-
ding run smoothly but are concerned about cost? Although the gold standard is
having your own, full-service destination wedding planner, not every couple needs
or can afford one for the duration. Hiring someone just for those parts of the wed-
ding you don’t want to handle and paying a day or hourly rate may work for you.
Even if you can’t afford to go all out with a full-time wedding planner, you can still
use their sage advice.
According to master bridal consultant Sue Winner (www.suewinnerweddings.
com), any couple considering a destination wedding needs to remember the 
following important points. Winner, who is based in Atlanta, has organized close to
700 weddings. She is a member of the Association of Bridal Consultants.
 Find out what the marriage laws are where you want to have the wedding, and
then determine whether you meet the criteria and can comply. Check out
Chapter 1 for more specific details about local criteria.
 Visit your destination to meet with potential vendors — and do it during the
week. The best vendors are booked on weekends and may not be able to make
time for you. If you can’t visit your destination, send your planner.
 Select the vendor who can provide the greatest value for your dollar. Instead
of making your first question to a vendor “What do you charge?”, ask what you
will receive for you money.
 Have a backup plan. An outdoor wedding on the beach sounds incredibly
romantic, but you can’t predict Mother Nature. Heat is as much an issue as rain.
 Don’t invite more guests than you can afford. Expecting people to RSVP “not
able to attend” is a dangerous game. You may be surprised by how many people
want to attend.
 Plan an activity for the groom and his wedding party the morning of the wed-
ding. The guys will have nervous energy to spare, so have them use that time
for a quick round of golf or basketball game, but don’t send them so far away
that it makes the bride a nervous wreck.
 If guests are booking their own hotel rooms, make sure they mention that
they’re members of your wedding party. Many hotels provide a complimentary
hospitality suite and bridal suite to parties that book a minimum of 20 rooms.
However, if guests don’t mention being a part of your wedding, you may not get
the free suites.

Travel agents normally don’t charge a fee; instead, they receive
commissions from the airlines and hotels they book on your
behalf. So you won’t pay more; as industry members, they pay less
when buying travel on your behalf. If a travel agent urges you to
choose a resort that doesn’t seem quite right for you, he may likely
receive a higher commission from that place; don’t feel pressured,
and find another travel agent. (Refer to Chapter 11 for specific
advice about making travel arrangements.)
Using an on-site coordinator
An on-site coordinator is based at a destination and is familiar with
the local professionals. She has a working relationship with the
hotel’s staff and food and beverage manager as well as local
florists, musicians, and others who regularly turn a wedding into a
celebration at a facility. 
Many hotels and resorts, especially in Las Vegas, the Caribbean,
and Hawaii, have in-house wedding coordinators who are thor-
oughly familiar with the property. They have experience in helping
couples choose the setting and menu and oversee the day at no
extra cost. In the following sections, I provide advice for how to
identify a good on-site coordinator and how best to work with one.
Working with an on-site coordinator
If you want to choose a hotel with an on-site coordinator, ask poten-
tial hotels what services its coordinator provides and meet with her,
if only by phone or e-mail, before committing to having a wedding at
that location. Your assessment is important, and it can be more of
an impression than a battery of questions. You want someone with a
good command of English, someone who responds to you quickly,
someone who uses e-mail and checks it daily, and someone who
doesn’t sound like she’s half alive. Make sure the on-site coordinator
will be available to you and willing to propose a variety of settings
around the resort to hold the ceremony and reception. She should
also show enthusiasm for her job and interest in you as a couple.
If her hotel offers customizable wedding packages, ask the coordi-
nator to present them to you and go over the options. Is she — and
the property she represents — as flexible and responsive as you
need them to be? If not, choose another hotel or hire your own
coordinator.
What to remember when working with a coordinator
When you work with a resort’s coordinator, yours may not be her
only wedding taking place. If your hotel schedules multiple wed-
dings on the same day, don’t expect the same level of care as if
Part I: Marrying Your Way: Away You Go 
66

yours were the only affair of the day or evening. To ensure that
your needs can be met, book a specific time with the coordinator
and get her assurance that you’ll have her undivided attention
during that period.
If you believe that your coordinator’s time will be divided on the
wedding day or you aren’t confident in her vision for your wedding
but still like the resort, consider bringing in a paid local event plan-
ner to tend specifically to your needs. 
In an ideal situation, you introduce your new local planner to the
on-site planner, and they work collaboratively. If you find that you
can’t work with the planner at all, her supervisor, or her supervi-
sor’s supervisor should know about it. You’ll need to have the
reception staff and other vendor information turned over to your
own person. And if it were me, I would tell the highest-ranking
person at the hotel that I expect to have the bill reduced because
promised services weren’t delivered.
Making use of an event planner
An event planner (also called an event producer) takes responsibil-
ity for orchestrating what takes place from the moment of arrival
to the start of your honeymoon. His focus tends to be on the look,
decor, and ambience of the event. The rehearsal dinner, ceremony,
and reception plus all the vendors who contribute to those events
are under his wing. Because his emphasis is on the visual and sen-
sory aspects of a wedding, request evidence of previous events he
planned. Ask for photos and references. And watch out for over-
the-top prima donnas.
These artistic pros usually work independently or through compa-
nies. A tourism office can help you locate one who is experienced
in working with couples who aren’t from that location. For exam-
ple, couples who want to rent an Italian villa for the ceremony and
reception and who need everything from dishes to a dance floor
need an event planner who speaks the language and can deal with
local regulations and vendors.
Dealing with multiple vendors
Standing behind every destination wedding’s bridal planner, travel
agent, local on-site coordinator, and event planner is a troupe of
specialized vendors who apply their skills to bring your event to
life. By understanding their different functions, you can choose
who to turn to if you want particular help.
Chapter 5: Gathering Your Destination Wedding Team 67

Can you skip the middleman and work with them directly?
Absolutely. The advantage is that you get to select those you like
best, rather than working with someone else’s preferred vendors.
On the other hand, doing it on your own takes more of your time to
recruit, interview, negotiate, and hire individual vendors. And
unless boundaries and the hierarchy of decision makers are clear
(you should always be at the top), it can create task overlap, a
costly and unproductive duplication of efforts. Hopefully whatever
team you assemble can work together harmoniously. Only the
bride is allowed to play the part of the diva!
If you want to deal with individual vendors, the following sections
are a few examples of typical vendors that couples need. As always,
experience and quality count. Better providers function above and
beyond their titles to coordinate all aspects of their area of expert-
ise. If you want to know how to talk to a vendor, check out the sec-
tion “Finding Good Help Far Away,” later in this chapter, for more
info. To find an actual vendor, check out Chapter 12.
Food service
If the hotel where you’re holding the reception doesn’t have an 
on-site coordinator, the banquet or catering manager is usually in
charge of the food service. To plan a reception in a space that
doesn’t normally operate as a restaurant or hotel, you need a
caterer.
A good banquet manager or caterer can help you with the following:
 The menu: If you don’t already know what you want to serve
at the wedding, the banquet or catering manager should be
able to present you with a variety of options at different price
points. And if you’re serving wine with the meal, he should be
able to recommend appropriate whites and reds within your
budget.
 Wait staff: The banquet manager or caterer hires and directs
the wait staff. Depending on how many guests and how elabo-
rate your reception is, he may need to call in a maître d’ and
headwaiter as well. Often the bartender is included in the
price of the package, but tax and gratuities are additional.
Officiant
People authorized to marry you legally fall into three categories:
 Religious: Priest, rabbi, or minister
 Official: Judges
 Civic: Notary publics or court clerks
Part I: Marrying Your Way: Away You Go 
68

A facility that holds weddings generally has a relationship with an
officiant and calls upon him regularly.
Don’t have time to meet the officiant in advance but still want to
discuss the ceremony? You can audition an officiant over the
phone (see Chapter 15 for more details). I asked ours, Reverend
Judy, to tell us what she would say — and she recited the entire
service over the phone. That turned me into a believer.
Some couples prefer to have a close friend or relative conduct the
ceremony. Rose Ministries (www.openordination.org) provides
nondenominational ordination to men and women by mail so they
can legally officiate at weddings within many states of the United
States. Check with the county clerk and the tourism bureau else-
where to find out whether such officiants have legal status to
marry you before booking one.
Finding Good Help Far Away
Locating reputable help for a destination wedding can be more diffi-
cult than gathering a team for an at-home wedding because often-
times you’re far away from your destination. However, this distance
doesn’t have to prevent you from finding the right people for your
festivities.
If your wedding plans are fairly elaborate, either you or your wed-
ding planner should make at least one trip well in advance of the
wedding to schedule a site inspection. Traveling to your destina-
tion also gives you the opportunity to screen and hire local ven-
dors in time to make adjustments, if necessary. And the best way
to know whether vendors are right for you is by observing them in
action.
Not all brides and grooms can take the time or afford to visit their
site in advance. Couples who don’t have an opportunity to meet
vendors in person before the wedding needn’t fret over it, though.
This section helps you find reliable on-site vendors when you’re far
away, including how to verify references, what to ask potential ven-
dors, and how to close the deal.
Hiring reliable local vendors
Despite the distance, hiring a vendor who you like and can trust is
essential. You should feel that he not only understands your needs
but also has your best interests at heart.
Chapter 5: Gathering Your Destination Wedding Team 69

Fortunately, you have ways to locate good vendors from afar, dis-
cover what other clients have said about them, remain in contact
with them, communicate what you expect at your wedding, and
gain a thorough understanding of what they will deliver.
If you don’t already have a local planner on the job and don’t
intend to hire one, the best way to locate skilled, reliable vendors
is through referrals. Personal recommendations from friends and
others who have experienced their services is always best. When
that’s not available, use the following:
 Ask the wedding venue to furnish a list of its top service
providers.
 If you already have one vendor selected, such as the photog-
rapher, ask her to recommend colleagues.
 Call or e-mail the local tourist bureau.
 Search online. One price-competitive source for vendors in
the United States is www.clienty.com. Post what you’re look-
ing for, and vendors submit bids for the job. Wedding Wire
(www.weddingwire.com) has recommendations of U.S. 
vendors from real brides.
Verifying references
Before you hire any on-site vendor, make sure you check on the
vendor’s past work and whether previous clients were pleased.
Keep the following points in mind when verifying references:
 Ask potential vendors to supply names and contact informa-
tion for at least three references. Ideally, you want to speak
to couples who are in the United States and whose wedding
took place fairly recently.
 Call references as soon as possible and ask as many ques-
tions as you can about the vendor’s services. Ask what the
vendor’s strong and weak points were, and whether they
would have had the vendor handle anything differently. Also
ask how closely the vendor’s estimate and final bill matched.
 To be on the safe side, do some other investigating. If you’re
researching a U.S. vendor, check with the Better Business
Bureau (www.bbb.com) to see whether any complaints are
lodged against the vendor. For overseas vendors, get in touch
with the tourism office and ask their advice in checking out
the company or independent vendor.
Part I: Marrying Your Way: Away You Go 
70

Asking the right questions
Although just about every vendor vouches that he brings taste,
style, and creativity to events, posing certain questions can give
you an idea of who you’re really dealing with. Good questions to
ask potential vendors include
 What is your range of services?
 How many weddings have you done?
 When was the last one, and can you tell me about it?
 Can you show me photographs of prior work?
 Are you experienced handling a wedding of my size?
 Have you worked at my reception spot before?
 Are you the one who shows up on my wedding day, or will
someone else from your company be there?
 What happens if you’re ill or can’t make it?
 Can you send me a sample contract?
 Do you understand my budget and can you work within it?
 Do you have any suggestions on how I can save money?
 How do you charge, and what is your fee? Do you accept pay-
ment in U.S. dollars or the local currency?
 When do you need a deposit, and how much is required?
 When is the balance due?
 When is the best time of day for me to reach you?
 Do you anticipate any problems?
Be wary of vendors who start out overpromising; they may pro-
ceed to underdeliver. Trusting your instincts and switching to
another vendor early in the process is better than being yoked to
one who will disappoint.
Communicating successfully with your team
When you can’t be there in person, keeping in touch with your ven-
dors is important. You want vendors who have voice mail or e-mail
and who check it regularly. You’ll have questions throughout the
destination-wedding-planning process, and you want someone who
provides prompt, clear answers.
When you work with a vendor who’s e-mail savvy, you have the
advantage of sending JPEGs and URLs for them to look at and under-
stand your style. And if they can send back photo samples, that’s
Chapter 5: Gathering Your Destination Wedding Team 71

helpful. When you’re considering a faraway band, for instance, ask to
have a DVD or CD mailed to you, or sample MP3 files e-mailed to you.
Closing the deal with distant vendors
Try to compare several vendors before selecting one. You don’t
necessarily have to be present to do so. For example, if you want
to decide between several caterers, ask all of them to prepare and
photograph the same three-course dinner (specify the appetizers
and entrees you’d like). Then have them estimate what they would
charge for the meal. It’s only fair to offer to compensate them for
the cost of ingredients when you ask them to go to such trouble.
The tricky part is that the vendor who bids lowest may not best be
able to fulfill your expectations. Nor can the highest-priced one nec-
essarily concoct the finest repast. That’s why speaking to references
can help you decide. After you’ve interviewed several vendors and
selected the one you’re confident is right for your wedding, you’re
almost ready to sign the contract and get things under way.
Negotiating ’til you sign on the dotted line
Before you take pen to paper, remember that almost everything is
negotiable, even how a vendor structures his fee. Most vendors
have a standard contract, but its provisions may be negotiable, too.
Certainly cross out any sections that don’t apply to your situation.
You can read more about budgets and negotiating in Chapter 4.
Going to contract
Double-check to make sure that everything you asked for is in writ-
ing and there are no hidden costs added in before you sign any-
thing. Read the fine print and ask questions if something looks
fishy. If you’re willing to bear the expense of having a lawyer
review the contract, do so at this point.
If everything checks out, sign on the dotted line. If, on the other
hand, you find something disturbing in the revised contract, ques-
tion the vendor. If the answer is satisfactory, authorize the con-
tract. If not, you haven’t found the right vendor and don’t sign.
Expect the vendor to ask for a good-faith deposit upfront, and
don’t overlook where the contract says nonrefundable (even that
may be negotiable).
If you expect to be going to contract with several distant vendors,
consider getting a fax machine if you don’t already have one. Some
still use this method rather than sending contracts via e-mails and
PDF files.

Picking a
Destination for Your
Wedding

In this part . . .
A
fter picking the right partner, choosing the right loca-
tion for your destination wedding is one of the most
important decisions you make (and also one of the most
fun). In this part, I help you brainstorm potential places
that ﬁt your needs, taste, and budget and help lead you to
a decision. The rest of this part takes a closer look at spe-
ciﬁc locations worth considering — from places in the
United States and Canada to exotic tropical islands to chic
European cities. I even tell you what you can expect if
you’re thinking of sailing into matrimony on a cruise ship.
So get ready for some globe-trotting armchair travel.

I
f you’ve decided to have a destination wedding, congratula-
tions. You’re embarking on an experience you won’t ever forget.
Now the big question looms: Where?
Before you start the decision-making process, understand that a
destination wedding location consists of three parts, all of which
you need to line up. Normally the process follows this order,
drilling down from general to specific:
1. Choose a destination.
Decide on the geographical location where your wedding will
take place, such as Las Vegas, Mexico, Italy, or elsewhere.
2. Select the property.
Finding the place that hosts your wedding — whether a
resort, state park, private villa — is the essential next step.
3. Pick the site.
The site is the physical space where you’ll speak your
vows, such as in a chapel, on the beach, or on a terrace.

This chapter presents ideas to help you identify settings appropriate
to your taste and budget. After you decide on the type of location
that suits you, Chapters 7, 8, 9, and 10 offer information and details
about specific locales.
Exploring Where to Go
Weddings take place in every country and culture in the world. If
you haven’t yet settled on a particular destination, get ahold of a
globe, atlas, or map to start. A visual aid stimulates the conversa-
tion about how far you’re willing to travel from home and the types
of places that are special to the two of you. When you’re ready,
start drawing up a list of potential destinations. To help you build
that list, this section provides insights into the many different
types of locations worth considering.
Pursuing places of the heart
When faced with a world of possibilities, narrowing down where to
have your wedding can seem like a daunting task. Fortunately, you
can use several ways to find suitable locations.
Discussing places that have been personally meaningful to you
throughout your lives, and their viability as wedding locations, is a
good way to come up with potential venues for your list. The fol-
lowing suggestions include more ways to help you identify your
“happy place”:
 Revisit a childhood home. According to the last United States
Census, about one in six families moves every year. If you
have lived in more than one place, which holds the best mem-
ories? Was it a place where you felt especially connected to
friends, family, or the community? Can you see yourself
returning to it for a celebration? Then add this location to
your list.
 Consider the land of your ancestors. America is comprised of
many different ethnic groups, and some couples have a yearn-
ing to return to the place their parents or grandparents came
from. Whether an older relative passed on stories of a county
in Ireland, a pueblo in Mexico, a city in Asia — or if you simply
feel drawn to a place that echoes your family history — con-
sider ancestral stomping grounds as a destination.
 Remember vacation sensations. Ever take a trip somewhere
and promise yourself, “One day I will return”? Your wedding
could be the right time to fulfill that promise.
Part II: Picking a Destination for Your Wedding 
76

 Look at destinations you’ve always wanted to visit. If you
haven’t traveled much, you can still come up with ideas. Have
you ever watched a movie set in an appealing location and said
to yourself, “That’s where I want to go!”? Put it on your list.
 Opt for romantic getaways. People associate many places
around the world with love and romance — Paris, of course,
along with Provence and the French Riviera, and all of Italy,
from golden Tuscany to Venice to the Amalfi coast. In the
United States, the Hawaiian islands, Wine Country, and even
Rocky Mountain retreats bring out starry-eyed smiles.
Because these destinations all are well-established, they offer
couples extensive properties in which to hold a wedding.
 Do some research. Every bookstore has a travel section, filled
with guides and picture books that transport armchair travel-
ers to appealing places. Other media — magazines, travel
posters, the Internet, and even ads — can also provide desti-
nation inspiration that sets you on a path to your wedding
spot. As you research, take note of the destinations that you
linger over — one of those may prove to be your wedding
wonderland.
About.com Travel (about.com/travel) has more than 50
guides, real people who are experts on different destinations.
Not only can you research cities, countries, and entire conti-
nents on the site, but you can e-mail guides directly with a
question.
Reveling in a climate you love
Weather can play a huge role in selecting potential locales for your
destination wedding. What’s your ideal outdoor temperature? Are
you in your glory when the thermometer reads in the torrid 80s
and sizzling 90s? Or do you prefer more temperate surroundings?
Perhaps you think nothing is as invigorating as winter’s chill, espe-
cially now that you have someone to cuddle with. Even if you
intend to hold your wedding indoors, you’ll be spending a signifi-
cant portion of time outdoors during your stay. So deciding where
you’ll be most comfortable is important.
Everyone wants good weather on his or her wedding day; however,
you can only gamble, but not depend, on Mother Nature. That’s
why scheduling your wedding during months when the weather is
most likely to cooperate can help the odds. Table 6-1 features pop-
ular destinations and optimal times to hold a wedding in them.

Eyeing travel expenses
As you compose a list of potential destinations for your wedding,
think about how much you want to spend and how much your guests
can afford to pay to travel (for more on budgeting, see Chapter 4). As
a general rule, the farther away you go, the more expensive trans-
portation is and the longer it takes for people to reach the place,
making it less likely that everyone you want to attend will be able to
make the trip. Yet if you propose guests meet you in a warm destina-
tion in February or embark on a wedding cruise with you in August,
you may find the enticement of travel makes distance no obstacle.
Staying in the U.S. or going abroad
When compiling your list of potential destinations, also consider
how getting married in the United States versus abroad affects you
and your guests. On one hand, traveling to an exotic place where
you can marry and continue the festivities for days is thrilling and
fascinating.
What’s the downside? Traveling to destinations outside of the
United States requires a passport for you and every guest who
RSVPs. And if you don’t speak the language or understand the cur-
rency, you may encounter frustration, not just during travel but
when dealing with wedding vendors as you plan your wedding
away. Furthermore, when you get married abroad, you have to con-
tend with differing and sometimes confusing rules and regulations
to make your ceremony legal (see the last section in this chapter).
Identifying destinations to avoid
Not every country is a wedding paradise. Destinations to strike
from your list include regions that have war, civil unrest, a high
crime rate, unpotable water, poor sanitation, dependably bad
weather, lingering effects from a natural disaster, or a significant
lack of facilities to hold a wedding. And because of the potential for
bureaucratic delays, think twice about holding a legal ceremony in
a place where weddings of foreign nationals (in this case, that
would be you) aren’t fairly routine.
Check the U.S. Department of State Web site (www.travel.state.
gov) to read Travel Warnings and Consular Information Sheets for
any countries that you’re considering traveling to. These info
sheets provide a steely-eyed assessment of characteristics of
places that travel brochures ignore, such as the incidence of crime
and disease.
Chapter 6: Finding the Right Destination: There’s a Place for You 79

Looking at Locales
The vast majority of couples who have a destination wedding
choose a traditional property such as a hotel or resort. Such vaca-
tion lodgings usually have both the facilities and staff to host a
destination wedding, which makes it easier and less stressful on a
couple organizing a wedding in an unfamiliar setting from a dis-
tance. And by holding the ceremony and reception in the same
location, you save on party rentals and transportation.
Nonetheless, for a variety of reasons, couples sometimes rely on a
hotel strictly for lodging and look elsewhere for ceremony and
reception venues. (I did the opposite: My wedding took place in a
hotel’s chapel, and we held the reception in an off-premise restau-
rant.) Properties other than hotels may provide something unusual
and picturesque that guests can’t find in their hometowns, and a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to enjoy them. They may also pro-
vide lower-cost settings than commercial venues.
Checking in on hotel and 
all-inclusive resorts
Couples with active, love-to-party guests may find an all-inclusive
resort the most cost-efficient option for their tribe. Not only can
guests eat, drink, and play to their heart’s content, their revelry
remains safely within the perimeter of a protected property. The
appeal of an all-inclusive is that you pay one price that covers
food, drinks, lodging, sports, and entertainment during your stay.
Spa treatments and excursions are normally extra.
To make their facilities even more enticing, some all-inclusive
resorts offer a free basic wedding package to couples who commit
to spending a minimum number of honeymoon days there after the
ceremony.
Mexico and the Caribbean are home to the majority of all-inclusive
resorts that promote wedding packages ranging from modest to
spectacular. Nearly every one offers the choice of setting the wed-
ding on the beach or in a gazebo, chapel, or tropical garden. (See
Figure 6-1 for an example of a better all-inclusive resort.)

Figure 6-1: The beach at sunset provides a glorious setting for a wedding.
Find out more about the major all-inclusive resort groups that have
free and upgraded wedding packages by visiting the following sites
or speaking to a travel agent (more on travel agents in Chapter 11):
 Sandals (www.sandals.com)
 Beaches (www.beaches.com)
 SuperClubs (www.superclubs.com)
 Couples (www.couples.com)
 Iberostar (www.iberostar.com)
 Palace (www.palaceresorts.com)

 Riu (www.weddingsbyriu.com)
 Occidental (www.occidentalhotels.com)
 Barceló (www.barcelo.com)
 Karisma (www.karismahotels.com)
If you decide to hold the wedding at an all-inclusive but some of
your guests stay elsewhere, find out whether your hotel offers day
(and night) passes. That way, nonguests can use the facilities and
participate in on-property activities you arrange. Note: “Free” wed-
dings only refer to the ceremony itself. It costs extra to have a
catered reception, the price of which is figured on a per-person cost.

All-inclusives aren’t the only hotels that aim to attract wedding
parties. Although major hotel groups’ city properties draw home-
town weddings, their resort facilities are set up to host and accom-
modate destination wedding groups. Many of the best-known hotel
brands dangle extras to induce couples to choose their facilities.

Part II: Picking a Destination for Your Wedding 
82

Although major hotel and resort groups are well-equipped to pro-
vide the venue and services you need to pull off a destination wed-
ding, many smaller and more intimate properties are up to the task
as well. Wherever you choose to base your event, understand that
the vast majority of hotels and resorts can make a wedding really
easy for you to plan when you choose a standard package.
Understanding the basic wedding package
Most hotels feature a standard wedding package that consists of a
list of services and amenities the property provides at a set price.
By bundling together those essentials, such as an officiant’s serv-
ices and flowers for the bride and groom, a property offers the con-
venience of a turnkey wedding where a couple need not fret over
customizing every aspect, instead opting to use the tried-and-true
elements provided. Couples who want to customize their wedding
package, adding or changing options from a standard list the hotel
provides, can still have a turnkey wedding, but should expect to
pay a bit more.
A standard package can be ideal for a small, low-budget wedding.
That’s the kind of wedding we had, and it also included a well-lit
makeup room for the bride and attendants, fresh floral arrange-
ments in the chapel, and a wedding video. The following features
are among those you’re likely to find in a standard low-cost wed-
ding package. This basic deal doesn’t include the price of the
reception, travel, or accommodations:
 Consultation with on-site wedding coordinator
 Assistance with document preparation
 Services of officiant
 Use of chapel or other scenic venue for the ceremony
 Small bouquet for bride and boutonnière for groom
 Sparkling wine and small, one-tier wedding cake
 Services of photographer (photographs may be extra)
 Prerecorded musical selections played
 Wedding certificate
 Inexpensive gift (such as T-shirts or keepsake glasses)
If you want to add something to the standard package, notify the
property in advance of the wedding. Doing so allows you time to
scrutinize and approve revised charges. Romantic add-ons to pack-
ages can include a post-wedding candlelight dinner, in-room spa
massages for two, breakfast in bed, and other trip sweeteners.
Chapter 6: Finding the Right Destination: There’s a Place for You 83

Upgrading a basic package
Couples who are having a larger wedding or want something more
elaborate can add to a basic package or request pricing on one
they create. Typically hotels and resorts can provide a couple with
a menu of services to choose from. If you have an idea for some-
thing unusual — whether it’s setting up a fully furnished outdoor
living room for cocktails before the ceremony or building a life-size
sand castle for you to marry beside — put in a request with the
wedding coordinator to find out whether the property can provide
it and the cost.
Keeping to your budget and planning a modest wedding with a
small guest list can leave you with money to splurge in some areas.
Options to enrich the experience are vast and include the following:
 Add extra names to your guest list.
 Help out attendants and guests who have limited funds by
subsidizing a portion of their travel costs.
 Treat yourselves to first- or business-class airfare.
 Upgrade from a standard guest room to a deluxe one or a
suite.
 Arrange for limousine service to the marriage license bureau
or to the reception site (if it differs from the ceremony loca-
tion).
 Order a bigger bouquet or more elaborate wedding cake.
 Dress up your ceremony and reception spaces with more flow-
ers and decorations.
 Book more time with the photographer or buy more shots.
 Fly in hair and makeup stylists from home.
 Add a cocktail hour.
 Include more gourmet items on the reception menu.
 Trade up from sparkling wine to genuine French Champagne.
 Plan a longer honeymoon or one at a more distant location.
Splurging on a designer destination wedding
Expanding on the popularity of their free and low-cost weddings,
the two leading all-inclusive brands, Sandals and SuperClubs, have
introduced more lavish wedding packages. Certain added frills cost
a few thousand dollars, while elaborate packages can top $50,000,
making some events twice as expensive as a typical hometown
wedding.

Although over-the-top affairs obliterate the advantage of having an
affordable destination wedding, I’d be remiss without telling you
about some options if you do have cash to burn. Obviously the
resorts are offering these types of glamorous destination weddings
because some couples are willing to spend the money. If you crave
a designer wedding, your first point of contact is still the wedding
coordinator at either a Sandals or SuperClubs resort.
 Preston Bailey Signature WeddingMoons at Sandals Resorts:
A floral and event designer who creates opulent party envi-
ronments for celebrities, Bailey has conceived four preset
wedding themes for couples marrying at Sandals and Beaches
resorts. Each consists of an elaborately decorated setting.
Gazebos swirled with silk, flower-panel screens, satin-and-tulle
chair covers, topiary centerpieces, and conch shells brim-
ming with orchids are among the elements Bailey styled to
prettify his namesake parties. These decorative enhance-
ments (see Figure 6-2) range from under $2,000 up to $5,000.
Appealing to brides with a penchant for brand names, other
Sandals temptations include wedding accessories (unity 
candles, photo albums, cake toppers, and barefoot jewelry) by
Beverly Clark; cakes designed by Sylvia Weinstock; a line of 
destination wedding gowns; and Waterford crystal and china
gifts. Sandals and Bailey can also conjure caviar-budget wedding
packages featuring transportation via private jet, a musical con-
cert by a well-known performer, and other extraordinary perks.

 “Wedding Bliss” and Sasha Souza “Oceans of Love” pack-
ages at SuperClubs: Similar to Sandals, SuperClubs offers
themed nuptial add-ons. These “Wedding Bliss” à la carte
packages, which are upgrades to the free wedding offer, range
from a sexy saxophone serenade for aisle walkers to a butter-
fly release to a newlyweds’ sunset massage.
A West Coast wedding consultant and destination wedding
planner, Sasha Souza designed her sky’s-the-limit “Oceans of
Love” package for SuperClubs’ Grand Lido resorts that starts
at $50,000 and includes everything from a honeymoon suite
with Jacuzzi for five nights and six days, a spa package, pri-
vate limo transfers for everyone, a live reggae band, a pool
party, and a fireworks display.
Pondering the pleasures and 
perils of public places
Public places, such as a beach or park, allow you to save money on
a ceremony spot that can be quite beautiful. Public doesn’t necessar-
ily mean free. And even in a public place, you may still need permis-
sion to use it for your wedding. Know that a facilities fee or permit
may be required, or you may run into strict regulations about the
number of people who can assemble there, putting up temporary
structures, curfews, limits on amplified music, and other rules.
To find out whether you can stage your ceremony on public prop-
erty, locate the person responsible for the space. The local munici-
pality should be able to provide a name and contact number.
Beach weddings
Casual and romantic, beach weddings seem as if they couldn’t be
simpler: the two of you, an officiant, the crashing waves, an after-
wedding run along the beach, or dive into the surf. The moment
can be heavenly . . . or it can rain.
Still, lots of couples refuse to settle for anything other than a
casual, toes-in-the-sand affair and are undeterred by passing show-
ers. And to avoid hopping around on super-heated midday sand,
they schedule early-morning or sunset weddings, which as an
added benefit yield prettier pictures.
If you’re thinking of a public beach wedding, plan ahead and pre-
pare for uncooperative weather (both heat and rain). According to
bridal planner Sue Winner, fewer than 15 percent of beach wed-
dings she’s been involved with actually ended up taking place on
the (hot) sand.

Weddings in a park or garden
The scent of flowers in bloom and their vivid colors in a public park
or garden can provide a picture-perfect setting for a wedding — as
long as you can establish some privacy.
Getting married in a public park or garden does have its drawbacks.
Think twice before holding the wedding in a highly trafficked public
place that is subject to the arrival of onlookers. Without private
security guards, distinctive stanchions, and eagle-eyed staffers to
steer away uninvited guests, you may end up having a bigger wed-
ding than planned.
Chapter 6: Finding the Right Destination: There’s a Place for You 87
Buying out a property for your wedding
Movie stars and millionaires aren’t the only people who buy out a place for a long
weekend and convert it into a uniquely luxurious setting for an unforgettable party.
Depending on the facility you select, the number of guests you invite, and the level
of amenities, cuisine, and entertainment you provide, having a place all to your-
selves may be within your reach. Taking over a multi-bedroom villa or an entire small
inn or resort with your family and friends as its sole occupants can be the ultimate
private pleasure.
Your planner or event director, working in concert with competent, agreeable staff,
can customize every aspect of a wedding weekend at a place that provides 24-7
service, daily gourmet meals, and flowing cocktails for the duration of your stay.
Imagine this scenario: The two of you arrive on a Thursday. After unpacking, you
savor a candlelight dinner on the beach. You sleep in on Friday. In the afternoon,
you greet arriving guests, sunbathe by your private swimming pool, and then linger
over your catered rehearsal dinner that night. The next day, while guests are off
golfing or sightseeing, you prepare for the Saturday-night wedding.
Perhaps you’re married poolside, its perimeter illuminated with candles. Then the
entire party moves to your private terrace (overlooking the water, of course!) for a
multicourse dinner prepared by the house chef. Much, much later that evening,
when you return to your room, transformed now into a bridal suite with a path of
rose petals that leads from the door to the bed, you sleep peacefully, knowing that
your wedding was everything you hoped for.
Wimco (www.wimco.com) is a well-known company that arranges villa rentals in
the Caribbean, Italy, the French Riviera, Greece, and Morocco. Also, hotels such as
Half Moon in Jamaica (www.halfmoonroyalvillas.com) feature separate,
fully staffed villa accommodations with access to the resort’s facilities, including
the spa, beachfront, and restaurants.

In addition, pipes and electrical cables may have to be run over the
grass, and bathrooms cleaned and upgraded with candles, flowers,
and amenities. Plus a crew may be necessary to comb the grass
and bushes beforehand, clearing out trash and even animal waste.
Picking a private property
Couples who want a wedding in a more exclusive place where they
can celebrate without prying eyes should look to a private prop-
erty, of which you can find many different kinds. For example, golf
and country clubs, thanks to their bucolic settings, are popular
options to consider; even if you aren’t a member, some clubs make
their event spaces available for a fee.
Although a private facility’s location or distinctive architecture
may be very tempting, keep in mind that not all are equipped for a
ceremony or reception and that many things that bring a party to
life have to be rented.
If you’re interested in a space that normally is used for parties and
events, ask whether they keep a list of preferred vendors, which
can make tracking down suppliers easier for you or your wedding
planner. This section points out a few options for private property
settings you may want to consider for your wedding.
College campuses
Many campuses have a chapel that can be used for a ceremony as
well as banquet facilities and meeting spaces you can use for the
reception. A majority of colleges also have parks or gardens or
meadows on the grounds — great for photo ops.
Having your ceremony on campus may take several rounds of nego-
tiations to persuade a school that had previously never allowed a
private social event to take place there to host a wedding. But as
long as one of you is an alum, you may have an advantage.
Offbeat opportunities
If you’re looking for something even more nontraditional, consider
the following types of properties for your destination wedding:
 Historic sites: A donation is usually expected, either in lieu of
or addition to a facilities fee.
 Art galleries: For the right price, a gallery can close early or
permit an after-hours event.
 Aquariums and zoos: These locations are fun, as long as they
can provide a separate area for your party.
Part II: Picking a Destination for Your Wedding 
88

 Private estates, country barns, and castles: Event designers’
dream venues, these sites allow for imaginative decorations.
 Photography studios: Open, well-lit spaces are perfect for pic-
ture taking and circulating.
 Restaurants and nightclubs: Taste the food, meet the chef,
ask whether a private party room is available. If you’re happy
with everything, this location could end your search.
Nuzzling in natural settings
Perhaps you and your other half love spending time outdoors. If
so, a wedding in a natural setting may be the obvious choice.
Backdrops blessed with natural beauty require fewer flowers and
less decoration to create a genuinely festive ambiance. This sec-
tion looks at a couple of options. If you find one that interests you,
contact the property directly or have your planner make the call.
Wedding in a winery
Wineries that are open to the public and have on-site restaurants are
best equipped to host sit-down dinners, buffets, champagne recep-
tions, and cake-cutting ceremonies where vintages from the facility
flow. Because wineries cover many acres, you can stage different
parts of your event in different spots, such as preceremony drinks
and hors d’oeuvres on a terrace, the ceremony in the orchard, and
then dinner under a tent. Many wineries have guest houses that the
bridal party can use for the day, and others are full-service inns.
Given the choice between a hilltop setting and a flat one, go for the
higher ground because it will be cooler in the summer and the pho-
tographs will be more dramatic.
Marrying atop a mountain
Normally couples feel on top of the world on their wedding day.
And when they marry on a mountainside — where the air is fresher
and the unobstructed views are thrilling — the experience can be
literally breath-taking. (Check out Figure 6-3 for an example.)
Getting married atop a mountain may not be for everyone. Couples
and guests who aren’t acclimated may become light-headed, dizzy,
and experience difficulty breathing in extremely high elevations.
Winter is prime time at ski resorts, so couples who schedule their
wedding for after the season can expect to pay lower rates.
Chapter 6: Finding the Right Destination: There’s a Place for You 89

Pursuing active passions
Did an activity bring you together? If so, you may be able to stage
your ceremony in a place that reflects the love you have for the
pastime as well as each other. This section looks at a few options.
Sports venue weddings
Are the two of you absolutely crazy about a professional or semi-
professional sports team? If so, why not get married at home plate,
center court, or center ice? Couples are tying the knot everywhere
from baseball diamonds to hockey rinks to scenic race tracks.
(Figure 6-4 shows an example.)
Although you can’t use a facility while play is underway, you may
be able to rent it before the season or after the game. Some cou-
ples carry out the theme by sending invitations in the form of
admission tickets and having their vows simulcast on the arena’s
electronic billboard.

like these two fanatical hockey fans.
Theme parks
Perhaps the two of you are head over heels (literally) for roller
coasters, thrill rides, and other theme park attractions. If so, why
not consider getting married at an amusement park?
Wedding fantasies come to life at Disney parks (yes, Cinderella,
you can arrive at the chapel in a horse-drawn pumpkin). Disney
FairyTale Weddings (www.disneyweddings.go.com), at both 
the Anaheim and Orlando properties as well as at Hong Kong
Disneyland, feature intimate (18 guests or fewer) and custom 
wedding (minimum of ten guests) packages, as well as cruise 
weddings aboard Disney ships. If you want a Disney wedding,
check out Chapter 7 for in-depth info.
Popular theme parks where couples with kids and the young at
heart can hold a wedding also include Busch Gardens (www.
buschgardens.com), Knott’s Berry Farm (www.knotts.com), 
and Sea World (www.seaworld.com). And at the indoor Great 
Wolf waterparks (www.greatwolf.com), neither seasons nor
weather put a damper on events. As with other destination 
weddings, guests at theme-park weddings are expected to pick 
up their own travel costs, but you should plan on covering 
admissions charges.

Going the cruise ship route
It’s usually smooth sailing for couples who marry aboard a cruise
ship or in port. Not only are cruise weddings fun and affordable,
with all the services and amenities you need already provisioned;
they also send you off on your honeymoon without skipping a
beat. Read about getting married on a ship in Chapter 10.
Making Your Destination Choice:
The Actual How-To
You may be thinking, “So many locations and so little time!” And
you really don’t know where to start. Worrying is normal: You’re
planning one of the biggest days in your life.
To make your final destination decision, follow these helpful steps:
1. List all the prospective locations you’re considering.
Don’t judge the locations now. Just brainstorm. Refer to the
“Exploring Where to Go” section earlier in this chapter to
inspire the list.
2. After you have a list, start narrowing it down.
Assign a number, low to high, of how strongly you want a
wedding in each location and how practical it is for you to
go there.
3. Focus on your top three choices.
With these three choices, do the following:
1. Visit the destination’s official Web site to get the facts
on marrying there and potential accommodations.
2. Contact hotels you’re interested in by phone or
e-mail.
Ask whether wedding packages are available, what
they include, the extras available, and complete costs.
If you want an on-site reception, request menu options.
And if you intend to honeymoon at the resort afterward, let
it know that you’re also interested in what the romance
packages entail.
4. Complete your research; now you’re ready to decide
where to hold the wedding.
Part II: Picking a Destination for Your Wedding

Review your list of potential places and see how many of
the items that follow you can check off. The one that
receives the highest number of marks is likely to be the
best place to seal your vows.
❑We have no major objections to the destination, prop-
erty, and ceremony and reception sites.
❑Our wedding date is available.
❑The site can handle a wedding our size.
❑We’re satisfied with the local services.
❑We will have an officiant who can conduct the cere-
mony the way we want it.
❑The cost is within our budget.
❑The amount of time it takes to travel to the place and
the connections required are reasonable.
❑We like the accommodations for ourselves and our
guests.
❑There’s plenty to do and see nearby.
❑We have dealt with people who are helpful and who
we trust to help create the wedding we envision.
Test-Driving Your Destination
Wedding Site
Have you narrowed your options down to a couple of places and are
not quite sure yet which one is right for you? Or are you concerned
that a place that looks great on paper or online won’t impress in
person? You could take a trip to inspect potential destination wed-
ding locations to help you make your final decision. Some couples
schedule a series of long weekends to a variety of places before
making their final decision. Others rely on their wedding planner to
do the legwork. Still others take advantage of test-drive packages,
which provide a quick overview but are primarily sales pitches.
If every detail — food, flowers, ceremony and reception spaces,
accommodations, and so on — must be just so in order for you to
feel comfortable with the wedding plans, then personally checking
out a destination and making the major decisions well in advance
of the wedding is imperative. When you have a big and elaborate
wedding in mind, you simply can’t find a substitute for showing up
ahead of time (and as far in advance as possible) in order to suss
out whether a spot is right for you.
Chapter 6: Finding the Right Destination: There’s a Place for You 93

However, if you’re more easy-going and trust serendipity and the
experienced wedding providers you’ve hired at a distance to
deliver what they promise, save your money. Many twosomes who
organize a small, turnkey wedding don’t show up until the event or
a few days before. (I was one of such brides. The entire wedding
had been planned remotely, and everything went smoothly.)
What to look for during 
an inspection
As soon as you arrive at a destination, a series of impressions will
bombard you. Everything from the distance of the airport to the
property to the way the hotel staff greets you is important, so keep
a notebook handy to write down your observations.
Be on the lookout for four key atmospherics at any site you inspect.
When any of the following are missing, seriously consider moving
on to the next place or vendor on your list:
 Cleanliness: Is every area you visit spotless, from the floors 
to the restrooms? Presumably you’ve given the property
advance warning that you were coming. If they didn’t clean 
up in anticipation of your visit, the place will unlikely sparkle
on your wedding day.
 Attentiveness: Were you greeted politely within moments of
your arrival? Was it clear a staff member was expecting you?
Did he begin to discuss your tour, and ask whether you
wanted to be shown anything in particular? Answering “yes”
to these questions are all good signs that a facility wants your
business, is professionally managed, and will work to make
your experience positive.
 Flexibility: Unless you’re 100 percent delighted with the layout
of the place and the particulars of the wedding package, ask
what it would involve to make a specific change such as an
alternate site, time, or menu. You can gauge how amenable they
are as hosts by their reactions. If every change you propose is
cause for an additional fee, do some tough negotiating before
signing anything.
 Helpfulness: Did the property’s tour guide take an active or
passive role? Was she basically a note-taker, or did she pres-
ent you with a reasonable number of options? She knows the
place better than you, so you should be able to count on her
to make suggestions where appropriate.
Part II: Picking a Destination for Your Wedding 
94

Seeing the sites
The most efficient way to check out specific sites and interview as
many vendors as possible is by having a car and driver at your dis-
posal. You can set this up in advance through your hotel or the
local tourism office. Although airport taxi drivers sometimes offer
their services for an entire day at a fixed rate, you have no way of
knowing how trustworthy or reliable one is.
After you arrive at a destination, check out the following to ensure
the locale is right for your wedding:
 Potential ceremony and reception locations: These site
visits are the most important because they’re where the main
events take place. If you plan an outdoor wedding, ask what
options are available in case of rain, heat, insects, or other
environmental issues. Ideally, a facility will reserve both an
indoor and outdoor space for you, and you should be able to
decide to use either one with same-day notice.
Ask how many people each space you’re shown can accom-
modate. You don’t want to crowd people in, nor do you want
them in a room that overwhelms. You can fit more people in
an area set up for a cocktail event than a sit-down dinner.
If the party space is undecorated, request to be shown pic-
tures of what it looks like when dressed for a wedding. Be sure
you understand what is provided at no additional cost and
what requires a fee.
 Accommodations: Knowing that friends and family will be
bunking at the resort, ask to see a range of rooms, from the
cheapest accommodations to the more expensive suites. Are
some guests traveling with young children? They may need
quarters that include kitchen facilities to store snacks or
warm a bottle. If handicap accessibility is an issue, make sure
that the ceremony and reception sites are compliant as well
as the rooms.
 Private party spaces: Find out what choices you have for
holding a rehearsal dinner on-site and whether you can have a
private space to yourselves.
 Recreational areas: Is there a pool, a beach, a spa, hiking trails,
or a sports or fitness center on the premises? The more facilities
on-site and the better their condition, the fewer reasons you’ll
have to leave.
Chapter 6: Finding the Right Destination: There’s a Place for You 95

Asking the right questions
Come prepared to ask as many questions of your host or wedding
planner as you need to during your inspection. Receiving straight
and clear answers is both desirable and reasonable. The following
questions are relevant to ask:
 Is the date we want for our wedding available? Does the price
change based on the time of day or other variables?
 How many weddings take place here in an average month? On
a typical day?
 Do you have on-site wedding coordinators? What does she
do? Is there a fee for her services?
 Can we count on assistance acquiring a marriage license?
 How many different types of guest rooms do you have, and
can we see one of each category?
 What amenities does a bridal couple receive?
 Can you accommodate all our guests on that date and the
day(s) before and after? Is a group discount available?
 If you don’t have enough rooms for our guests, where are the
closest places they can stay?
 What kind of wedding ceremony and reception packages are
offered, what do they include, and how’re they priced?
 Do you charge a facility-usage fee?
 What are our options for ceremony and reception locations?
 How far apart are the ceremony and reception spaces we
prefer? If our ceremony and reception sites are beyond walk-
ing distance, what are the transportation options?
 Can we use a caterer, florist, musicians, and officiant of our
choice, or are we obligated to work with your vendors?
 How are the spaces normally decorated? Are there particular
themes available? What is the price range?
 Do you have a curfew or volume restriction on music?
 What types of activities can our guests participate in before
and after the wedding?
 Are children permitted at the resort? If so, what facilities exist
for them?
Part II: Picking a Destination for Your Wedding 
96

 Has the property been hit by bad weather recently and 
suffered any damages?
 Are any renovations planned, and if so, will noise disturb the
festivities?
 Does the property carry liability insurance? Is it necessary for
us to buy additional event insurance?
 Who would be our primary contact person if we decide to
book our wedding here? Can we meet with him before we go?
 How much of a deposit is required, under what circumstances
is it refundable, and when is the final payment due?
 How soon should we plan on arriving before the wedding?
Getting direct answers that you’re comfortable with can confirm that
you’ve come to the right place to hold your destination wedding.
Visiting with vendors
Schedule time during your trip to meet with potential vendors,
such as the florist, caterer, and so on. If they’re located on-site at a
hotel or resort, it will certainly save you travel time getting to
them. Regardless of where they do business, when making an
appointment, let potential vendors know that you intend to do
more than chat when you encounter them face to face: You want to
sample their wares and get their input. For more information on
choosing vendors, check out Chapter 5.
For many couples, the quality of food served at their wedding is
paramount. So you need to taste everything that may be served.
Even though you may have your heart set on one menu, ask to try
the chef’s specialty. It may be so delicious that you decide to sub-
stitute it for some standard fare.
Florists can be expected to prepare a sample bouquet for a nomi-
nal fee along with photos of their previous work. And if you plan to
have your wedding hair and makeup done locally, put those styl-
ists through their paces, bringing along a photo or tear sheet from
a magazine to show the look you want them to emulate.
Toward the end of any vendor meeting, pose an open-ended ques-
tion, such as “Is there anything I haven’t asked you about that
could make my wedding even more special?” You never know what
someone may propose.
Chapter 6: Finding the Right Destination: There’s a Place for You 97

Selecting a Destination Where 
You Can Legally Marry
When you’re deciding on a destination, one of the most important
points to consider is whether you can get legally married there.
Follow these steps to ensure your destination wedding will be
valid:
1. Meet the area requirements to obtain a marriage license.
2. Show up together in person and acquire the license.
3. Participate in a ceremony led by an officiant whose cre-
dentials are accepted where the wedding is held.
Afterwards, the officiant signs, stamps, or notarizes your
license.
The reason to concern yourself with this is that destinations out-
side the United States have their own rules and regulations in
order for a wedding to be legal. That’s why you need to contact the
local office that issues marriage licenses to determine whether you
can meet a destination’s specific requirements before making wed-
ding or travel plans. Don’t depend on unofficial Web sites for this
information, because license requirements can change.
If you find that overseas wedding laws are too restrictive or bur-
densome to comply with, consider quietly taking care of the legali-
ties with a private civil ceremony before you travel. You can then
go ahead with any kind of destination wedding you like, seal your
vows with a kiss, and your guests need not be any wiser that your
“first” wedding took place in your hometown courthouse.
This section takes a general look at the requirements for getting
married both inside and outside the United States to emphasize
how requirements differ. Specific legal requirements may cause
you to rethink a destination. Chapters 7–10 provide more detailed
info about locations and their specific marriage license laws.
Tying the knot in the United States
Every municipality in the United States is entitled to have its own
set of requirements that must be met before it issues a marriage
license. Most places don’t require U.S. citizens to be residents of
the wedding destination. Furthermore, states recognize weddings
between members of the opposite sex performed in other states.
Part II: Picking a Destination for Your Wedding 
98

To find out what the specific regulations are and where to apply for
a license, contact the clerk of the city or county you want to marry
in. Typically you’ll need to bring proof of age, identity, citizenship,
and your social security card. A U.S. marriage license is normally
valid for a few months after it is issued.
If you want to have a religious ceremony away from home but still
in the United States, contact the church or synagogue office at
your wedding destination to inquire about the possibilities.
Religious leaders may be reticent about conducting ceremonies for
couples who don’t belong to their congregation. They may require
regular attendance for a period of time, premarital counseling, or
other programs before agreeing to solemnize your marriage.
Getting married in another country
As a general rule, marriages that are performed legally abroad are
also valid in the United States as long as they adhere to the laws of
the country where the marriage is performed. However, acquiring a
marriage license overseas can be more difficult than getting one at
home. Each country has its own rules and requirements, and in the
strictest nations, only a couple who are citizens of the country may
marry there.
The place to start, if you haven’t yet left home, is with the coun-
try’s tourism bureau or consulate. If you’re already in the country
where you want to wed, the U.S. embassy can also provide guid-
ance. Neither a consulate nor an embassy official is authorized to
perform marriages in foreign countries. However, their offices are
the best place to find the appropriate source to contact.
Offices that process marriage licenses in other countries typically
require a variety of documents from a couple. You may be
expected to produce the following items in order to obtain a
license to wed:
 Proof of identity (such as an original birth certificate or one
with a raised seal, a passport, or a driver’s license)
 Divorce decree or death certificate, if this isn’t a first marriage
 Filing and paperwork fee, which may be required in cash
In addition, some localities also require some of the following:
 Blood test
 Residency requirement
 Proof of citizenship (your passport suffices)
Chapter 6: Finding the Right Destination: There’s a Place for You 99

 Tourist card, visa, or other proof of arrival in the country
 Parental authorization for couples under 18
 Premarital counseling
 Waiting period
 Witnesses and copies of their passports
 Posting of banns (wedding notice)
 Paperwork processing time
 Document translation

W
hen a couple first begins to think about having a destination
wedding, they often picture themselves in a faraway place
such as a sophisticated city, a pristine mountaintop, or a secluded
island. In reality, they may not have to go that far to reach the type
of setting they dream of. With venues of almost every kind in the
United States and Canada, staying relatively close to home may
make sense for you. That way, you can spend more of your funds on
the wedding and reception and less on airfare to distant points.
Keep in mind when shopping around for destinations that the less
expensive the cost of travel is, the more likely guests will accept
your invitation.
Friends and neighbors, Canada and the United States are both
excellent choices for a destination wedding. In addition to sharing
a common border and language, they both have a high standard of
living and low crime rates in the locations I recommend. This chap-
ter looks at some of the more popular destinations in the United
States and Canada. Transportation between the two is efficient and
easy, and you don’t need a passport until mid-2009 at least.

Considering the Hot Picks 
in the United States
Did you know that almost two-thirds of U.S. couples who have a
destination wedding stay inside the country to marry? The United
States is so vast that every state, not to mention every major city,
attraction, and hotel, has its own Web site filled with information
to convince you that it’s the perfect place for your wedding. One of
them may well be.
Because I don’t have enough room in this chapter to include all the
great U.S. destinations, I encourage you to continue researching on
your own if you don’t see the perfect place on these pages. To find
additional wedding locations in the United States, pick up one of
the big U.S.A. guidebooks. If you prefer to use the Web, check out
www.seeamerica.org, which links to state tourism offices or use
Google (www.google.com) or a destination-focused site such as
About.com Travel (www.about.com/travel), simply pairing the
name of the destination you want with the word weddings.
Living it up in Las Vegas
Saying “I do” in Las Vegas is so easy, affordable, and fun that more
than 100,000 couples do it annually, making it America’s number-
one spot for destination weddings. Any time of year, you can wit-
ness couples of all ages and sizes, garbed in all styles of wedding
apparel, on the Las Vegas Strip. You also find them inside casinos,
restaurants, hotels, and streaming in and out of the Clark County
marriage license bureau downtown.
Your options are vast in Vegas. Whether you and your other half
dream of a traditional or a quickie wedding, a Honeymoon in Vegas
scenario, or a helicopter ceremony, contact the facility you’re
interested in by phone or e-mail. Just about every Vegas chapel on
the Strip and in its casino hotels explains its wedding packages on
its Web site and also provides a toll-free phone number and e-mail
address that put you in touch with a representative from the wed-
ding department. Although many couples choose freestanding
chapels for cost, convenience, and kitsch, hotel and theme wed-
dings are eclipsing quickie Strip weddings in popularity.

Chapter 7: Staying Close to Home: The United States and Canada 103
Las Vegas wedding basics
If you’re wondering what’s involved in getting married here, it’s
pretty simple. Just follow these steps:
1. Pick up a license.
The Las Vegas Marriage Bureau is open daily from 8 a.m.
until midnight at 201 Clark Avenue, which is in downtown
Las Vegas, three blocks off the Strip. Applications can 
be downloaded online (www.co.clark.nv.us/clerk/
Marriage_Information.htm) but must be submitted 
in person. You can contact the bureau at 702-671-0600.
To get to the Marriage Bureau, catch a taxi in front of any
hotel or take a bus down the Strip. If you prefer to travel in
style, look for a wedding facility that offers limo service to
and from the Marriage Bureau as part of a wedding package.
2. Choose a chapel.
When selecting a Vegas chapel, you have two types of
options:
• Freestanding chapels on the Strip: Most people asso-
ciate getting married in Las Vegas with these chapels
where you can show up at 4 a.m., get married by an
Elvis impersonator (check out Figure 7-1), and even
drive through. A wedding here won’t cost a lot of
money (as long as you have a small, brief ceremony
and resist buying the upsells).
Figure 7-1: Viva Las Vegas! You can have an elegant wedding in a fine hotel
chapel or a kitschy one on the Strip with an Elvis impersonator.
© A Elvis Chapel, Las Vegas, www.elvischapel.com

Fun, old-fashioned Strip facilities include the Little
White Wedding Chapel (www.littlewhitechapel.
com; 800-545-8111), Little Chapel of the Flowers (www.
littlechapel.com; 800-843-2410), Viva Las Vegas
Wedding Chapels (www.vivalasvegasweddings.com;
800-574-4450), and Graceland Wedding Chapel (www.
gracelandchapel.com; 800-824-5732). Most of them
have built-in Webcams, and you can e-mail nonattending
guests the time to log on to the chapel’s Web address to
watch your ceremony. (For more info on Webcams and
your wedding, check out Chapter 15.)
Although you may be able to walk into one of these
wedding chapels on the Strip without a reservation, I
recommend reserving the time, the specific chapel,
and the package in advance to get what you want.
• Chapels inside hotel-casinos: Couples who believe
that a wedding ought to be a refined and dignified
occasion, regardless of where it’s held, will prefer the
decorum as well as the decor of a hotel chapel. Not
only are these chapels newer than their Strip com-
petitors, but they also make a real effort to provide
couples with a tasteful ceremony.
Chapels both on the Strip and in casino hotels have wedding coor-
dinators, and they’re responsible for helping you pick the package
that you want, scheduling the wedding, notifying the officiant,
wrangling the witnesses (if necessary), and making sure that all the
elements you signed up for are provided.
Theme weddings in Las Vegas
Because every Las Vegas casino hotel has a theme, ranging from
ancient Rome (Caesars Palace) to urban mash-up (New York New
York), couples can easily slip into one of these virtual worlds for a
pre-wedding, wedding, or post-wedding celebration that extends
the theme. Although conventional weddings are the rule at casino-
hotel chapels, tempting fun themes include
 Gondola wedding: Held at The Venetian hotel (for info, con-
tact via www.venetianweddings.com or call 866-548-1807). No
need to travel to Venice, when you can be serenaded on this
hotel’s Grand Canal.
 Disco wedding: Marry inside the Forever Grand Chapel in the
MGM Grand and celebrate afterwards in its Studio 54 night-
club. You can find details at www.mgmgrand.com or by calling
800-646-5530.

 Star Trek wedding: The Trekkie Wedding at Las Vegas’ Star
Trek: The Experience inside the Las Vegas Hilton takes place
on a replica of the Star Ship Enterprise bridge. A Klingon can

ceremony officiated by a minister dressed in a Starfleet uni-
form. Beam yourselves over to www.startrekexp.com or call
702-697-8750.
 Roller-coaster wedding: Experience the thrill of the Sahara

wedding to remember.
 Paris romance wedding: Say your vows atop the Eiffel Tower
in the Paris Las Vegas hotel. Go to www.parislasvegas.com
or call 877-650-5021 if you’re interested in Las Vegas l’amour.
Elegant weddings in Las Vegas
Traditional-minded couples and those who want a formal, dignified
affair can find many pretty, romantic spots that can suit their
needs in Las Vegas. The best casino hotels in town (see the follow-
ing list) have beautiful wedding chapels and offer packages that
start at affordable and go to sky’s-the-limit:
 Mandalay Bay: Its chapel design is sleek and sophisticated,
with garden views. See for yourself at www.mandalaybay.com,
or call 877-632-7701.
 Bellagio: This casino hotel has two chapels that can accom-
modate 30 and 130 guests, and locations throughout the 
hotel provide Tuscan-like backdrops for photos. Go to
www.bellagio.com or call 888-987-3344 for more info.
 Caesars Palace: Offering a choice of five indoor and outdoor
settings that can fit from 35 to 196 guests, Caesars offers a
menu of “unforgettables” that include invitations and gown
and tuxedo rentals. To check it out, visit the Web site
(www.caesars.com) or call 877-279-3334.
 Wynn Las Vegas: The top of the line, Wynn Las Vegas is the
world’s only five-star, five-diamond casino hotel. Its three wed-
ding salons have upholstered pews and flattering lighting and
can accommodate from 65 to 120 guests. Browse its Web site
(www.wynnlasvegas.com) or call 877-770-7077.
Just because you want an elegant wedding in Vegas doesn’t mean
you have to go into debt, take out a loan, or get a second job. If you
want to get an idea of what things cost and compare a low-budget
and a luxurious destination wedding, refer to Chapter 4.
Chapter 7: Staying Close to Home: The United States and Canada 105

Vegas yes, Strip no
The fastest-growing city in America, Las Vegas features more wed-
ding places beyond its famed Strip. Two fairly new hotels that have
upped the ante in luxury also boast facilities that can accommo-
date larger weddings. Both properties are a short cab ride from
The Strip, so you can marry in their chapels and luxuriate in their
beautiful surroundings, then head to the action for great gambling
and restaurants:
 JW Marriott Las Vegas: Large rooms, lush grounds, indoor
and outdoor ceremony venues, and all-inclusive wedding
packages await couples. Go online to www.jwlasvegas
resort.com or call 702-869-7034 for info.
 Ritz-Carlton Lake Las Vegas: Whether you choose an intimate
or extravagant wedding here, the settings are Vegas’s most
romantic. See www.ritzcarlton.com/resorts/lake_las_
vegas or call 702-567-4700.
Restaurant receptions
Las Vegas has recently turned into a foodie city, with many of the
world’s best chefs opening high-end restaurants inside hotels. 
You and your party can dine at desert outposts of Los Angeles’s
Spago and Nobu, New York’s Rao’s and Aureole, New Orleans’s
Commander’s Palace, and even Paris’s L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon.
Fortunately, the city also has a wide selection of affordable off-
Strip restaurants for receptions. Two favorites are Carluccio’s
Tivoli Gardens (702-795-3236), an old-fashioned Italian restaurant,
and Pamplemousse (www.pamplemousserestaurant.com;
702-733-2066), a Rat Pack–era French eatery with exceptional food
and service.
Check out a listing of Las Vegas eateries at www.vegas.com/
restaurant, where you can make reservations.
Getting hitched in Hawaii
America’s 50th state and number-one honeymoon destination,
Hawaii (www.gohawaii.com; 800-464-2924) is also a prime wedding
spot for couples — especially those coming from the West Coast
who can fly direct in about five hours. Exquisite sunsets, gorgeous
Pacific ocean views, and residents born of the gentle Polynesian
culture all add to the loveliness of Hawaii (see Figure 7-2). Visitors
also eat well here, tempted by everything from fresh fish to succu-
lent pineapples, piquant Maui onions to rich Kona coffee.

Figure 7-2: Orchid leis, a tropical bouquet, and a kahu officiant add authenticity
to a Hawaiian wedding. 
Thanks to dependably warm and sunny days cooled year-round by
trade winds and astoundingly beautiful Hawaiian sunsets, outdoor
weddings are very popular. All it takes to arrange a ceremony on
one of the state’s clean and wide public beaches or parks is secur-
ing an available date and a paid special-use permit. Receptions
aren’t normally allowed.
If you want to marry on a secluded beach, hiring an island wedding
planner who can direct you to places that only locals know about
is your best option (see Chapter 4 for more on wedding planners).
And if you’re bringing a group of 20 or more to Hawaii, look into
Hawaiian Airlines’ (www.hawaiianair.com) Wedding Wings pro-
gram 60 days ahead of the wedding to request an upgrade for the
two of you.
For information on getting a marriage license valid throughout the
state, go to http://www.hawaii.gov/health/vital-records/
vital-records/marriage/index.html.
Maui
The highest percentage of destination weddings takes place on
Maui, consistently voted “best island in the world” by readers of 
a leading travel magazine. Maui (www.gohawaii.com/maui;
800-464-2924) has four areas where its best hotels are located:
Kaanapali Beach, Kapalua, Wailea, and Hana.

Part II: Picking a Destination for Your Wedding 
108 Part II: Picking a Destination for Your Wedding 
Thanks to the island’s dramatic geography, you can find ample
sites beyond hotel ballrooms, terraces, and their adjacent beach-
fronts to get “Maui’d.” Check out the following options:
 Pause at the lush Maui Tropical Plantation (www.mauitropical
plantation.com; 800-451-6805), where exotic flowers and the
spectacular West Maui mountain range serve as a backdrop.
 Stop beside a remote waterfall on the drive to heavenly Hana.
The 52-mile-long road to Hana traverses some 600 curves and
dozens of bridges. Around each bend, the scenery delights
and surprises. Search Google Images (images.google.com)
for hana waterfalls to see what this looks like.
 Feast at the Old Lahaina Luau (www.oldlahainaluau.com;
800-248-5828); wedding chants and fare evoke old Hawaii here.
 Ascend to a sunrise ceremony atop dormant, 10,000-foot
Mount Haleakala volcano. Trips via tour bus and helicopter
are available through www.viator.com, along with bicycle-
down adventures.
Borrowing local Hawaiian traditions
Whether you crave a formal ceremony or barefoot beach affair, you can get married
your way in Hawaii. Couples who want to give their event a stronger sense of place
may adapt local traditions. The following are a few examples of what you can do:
 Some ceremonies begin with a wedding chant initiated by a kahu (nondenomina-
tional officiant) who subsequently blows a conch shell to signify the bride’s entrance.
He may lead the wedding party down to the water’s edge to be honored with a hula
and blessed with a gentle sprinkling of sea water before beginning the vows.
 A husband and wife can do an orchid lei exchange at the beginning or the end
of the ceremony to represent their unity and commitment to one another.
 Some couples integrate a sand ceremony, where two different shades of sand,
symbolizing bride and groom, are blended together to fill a keepsake vessel.
 Flower circles on the vast beach mark a distinct space for a marrying couple to
stand inside. Bamboo tiki torches often surround them.
 Instead of a traditional recessional, everyone walks to the edge of the beach
and throws flower petals into the ocean following a blessing by the minister.
 Hawaiian love songs or instrumentals played on a super-resonant Hawaiian lap
steel guitar provide an authentic serenade before and after the ceremony.
To incorporate any of these traditions into your Hawaiian wedding, discuss it with
your wedding planner. If you don’t have one, talk it over with the officiant.

Oahu
The most crowded and commercial of the Hawaiian Islands, Oahu
(www.gohawaii.com/oahu; 800-464-2924) is also home to Waikiki
Beach, ringed by hotels overlooking the crescent shore. Each hotel
can serve as a ceremony venue and provide reception space.
The largest hotel in the state, Hilton Hawaiian Village (www.hilton
hawaiianvillage.com) recently added the Ocean Crystal Chapel.
Set in a tropical garden, the chapel can seat up to 70. Smaller
venues are also available on the 22-acre, waterfront property.
Thanks to its popularity, Oahu also offers unique spots to tie the
knot in. Among them are
 The Polynesian Culture Center: A tropical setting that offers
entertainment for family members of all ages. Visit www.
polynesia.com or call 800-367-7060.
 Byodo-In Buddhist Temple: A tranquil, photogenic setting
with lovely Japanese gardens. See it at www.hawaiiweb.com/
oahu/sites_to_see/byodo-in_temple.htm.
 Haiku Gardens: Features an over-water gazebo that serves as
an open-air chapel. Check out www.haikugardens.com or call
808-247-0605 for more info.
Other options include working with a wedding planner to stage a
wedding in one of Oahu’s five botanical gardens, taking guests on a
sunset cruise, or gaining access to a private estate or golf course.
The Big Island
The largest and least-crowded Hawaiian island, the Big Island
(www.bigisland.org/romance; 800-464-2924) is a nature-lover’s
paradise that has remained relatively unspoiled. Black-lava beaches;
tumbling, blue waterfalls; verdant tropical gardens; and the flame-
orange Kileaua Volcano exhibit the color and energy of the island.
The size of the Big Island is comparable to the state of
Connecticut, so deciding on which side to hold your wedding is
important. Although you can drive to all parts of the island, select-
ing the nearest airport (Kona or Hilo) as your starting point is the
most time-efficient method. Kona has some luxurious hotels:
 Kona Village Resort (www.konavillage.com; 808-325-4372),
whose unique black sands remind visitors of the island’s
origin. Accommodations are luxurious thatched-roof huts.
Chapter 7: Staying Close to Home: The United States and Canada 109

 Immensely beautiful and renowned for superlative service, the
3,200-acre, oceanfront Mauna Lani Resort (www.maunalani.
com; 800-367-2323) has a dedicated weddings and romance
director.
Other options on the Big Island for your wedding include
 Outdoor venues: Weddings also can be held outdoors at
Hulihee Palace (808-329-1877) and Puuhonua O Honaunau
National Historical Park. Check out www.nps.gov/puho or call
808-328-2288.
 Parker Ranch: The 225,000-acre Parker Ranch (www.parker
ranch.com) is one of the oldest and biggest ranches in the
country and offers numerous wedding locations, including
gardenia and rose gardens, a lavender arch, a koi pond, and a
formal dining room. You can visit the Web site or call
808-885-5898 for more info.
 Hawaii Tropical Botanical Garden: Considered one of the
most beautiful spots in the islands, the Hawaii Tropical
Botanical Garden (http://htbg.com) on the Hamakua Coast
(fly into Hilo) has a wedding site overlooking Onomea Bay. Its
wedding package includes a minister, tropical bouquet for the
bride and lei for the groom, a golf cart to ferry the couple and
parents to the site, CD of digital pictures, and more. For more
details, check out the Web site or call 808-964-5233.
Kauai
The oldest and most verdant of the Hawaiian islands, Kauai
(www.gohawaii.com/kauai; 800-464-2924) is a wonderful place for
an outdoor wedding. Many claim it has the best beaches in the
state. Couples can dig their toes into the sand from the broad,
sandy, uncrowded swaths of Shipwreck Beach on the south shore’s
Keoniloa Bay (conveniently located near a Hyatt hotel) to those
beside sheltered Hanalei Bay on the north side. Afterward, a pri-
vate luau or a sail along the breathtakingly beautiful Napali Coast
can cap an utterly romantic wedding.
In addition to Kauai’s beaches, coves, hotels, and restaurants,
other appealing wedding sites that a local planner can hook you up
with include
 Fern Grotto: A very popular natural amphitheater beside the
Wailua River, Fern Grotto is a unique setting for a scenic desti-
nation wedding. It takes 40 minutes to reach it via riverboat,
and after a short walk on pavement to the grotto, couples
marry at this Eden-like spot where tropical vegetation covers
volcanic rocks.
Part II: Picking a Destination for Your Wedding 
110

 Ninini Point Lighthouse: This site is open sporadically, but
the building and grounds provide a picturesque setting and
excellent views of Nawiliwili Harbor.
 Na ‘∑ina Kai Botanical Gardens: If you’re looking for a beach,
waterfall, Japanese teahouse, or lake settings, this location
has them all. Check out www.naainakai.org or call
808-828-0525.
 Waioli Huiia Church: In Hanalei, Waioli Huiia Church, built by
Christian missionaries, has stained-glass windows, and water-
falls surround it.
Couples need not stand still to pledge their vows on Kauai. For an
action-packed ceremony, consider marrying beside a waterfall you
reach via horseback, hopping aboard an ATV, and roaring up a
mountainside. Or you can mouth the words “I do” over the noise of
a helicopter that sweeps over Waimea, known as the Grand Canyon
of the Pacific. A local tour company, resort concierge, or wedding
planner can help you turn these fantasies into reality.
Finding the magic in Florida
Florida’s tropical weather and azure waters, its variety of natural
and manmade wonders, and the availability of cheap, direct flights
from many domestic airports all make this state a prime place for
destination weddings. No wonder that nearly 30 percent of couples
who marry within the state of Florida aren’t residents.
Prices for everything from bridal bouquets to wedding cakes vary
widely and are likely to be highest along the Gold Coast, stretching
from Palm Beach down to Miami, and in Disney World. However,
you don’t have to bring a pot of gold to get married there. The fol-
lowing looks at some options for a Florida wedding.
Florida for the frugal
If you’ve dreamed of getting married in sunny Florida and you 
want to stay on a budget, you’re not out luck. Fortunately, many 
of Florida’s state parks (www.floridastateparks.org) include
beach frontage, perfect for informal and inexpensive weddings. To
arrange one, first contact the park manager to request permission.
Another option: Way down the coast, in the Florida Keys, edged by
the Atlantic on one side and the Caribbean on the other, water
plays a large part in inspiring couples as to where to tie the knot.
You can take your vows on the beach at sunset, and then invite up
to 30 guests to board a paddlewheeler that plies the waters off Key
Largo for a reception. And for something different, marry at a

dolphin facility with the friendly mammals as your witnesses. Visit
Florida Keys tourism site at www.fla-keys.com or call 800-358-5937.
Weddings in Walt Disney World
Young-at-heart couples and ones with children in tow can’t help
but get excited by the prospect of marrying inside Disney World
(www.disneyweddings.com; 321-939-4610). The Orlando park goes
all out to make events the stuff of magic. However, if your guest list
favors sophisticated and child-free couples, Disney isn’t the place
for you.
What makes a Disney wedding desirable? Check out some of the
following perks:
 Classic Disney magic: The bride can be delivered to the wed-
ding pavilion in Cinderella’s glass coach driven by two foot-
men and pulled by six Welsh ponies. Or you can have your
ceremony end with a white dove release or invite Disney char-
acters to dance at the reception. And Disney recently debuted
its own Fairy Tale Wedding Dress collection, so a bride can
walk down the aisle looking like a princess.
Neither Mickey nor Minnie Mouse is permitted to officiate, but
couples can arrange for the characters to mingle with guests
at the reception, pose for pictures, and “cut in” on the first
dance.
 On-site wedding coordinator: In addition to booking your 
ceremony time and space and helping to customize the event,
a Disney coordinator can present options for post-wedding
celebrations.
 Couture weddings. Couples who want elaborate decorations
(crystal chandeliers, gilt mirrors) at their Disney wedding and
reception can opt for one of four dramatic looks conceived by
designer David Tutura.
 Personalized wedding Web site: Couples who book a Disney
wedding receive a wedding Web site where they can fill in all
the details they want guests to know. After your big day, your
wedding pictures are posted to the site.
 Lodging: One advantage of inviting friends and family to cele-
brate with you is the wide choice of accommodations. Budget-
conscious guests can stay in the park’s value or moderate
resorts. Those who can afford to splurge can choose a deluxe
hotel such as the retro Grand Floridian (407-824-3000), which
has honeymoon suites, or the new Animal Kingdom Lodge
(407-938-3000). You can find complete information and rates
on accommodations by clicking on “Resorts” at www.disney
world.com.

 Theme park access: What’s the point of a Disney World wed-
ding without a visit to the Magic Kingdom, EPCOT, Disney-MGM
Studios, the Animal Kingdom Park, and then Downtown Disney
at night? You can hit them all on a wedding-and-honeymoon
combo, visiting the hot spots with your guests or on your own.
Four nights is the minimum length of time required for a couple to
stay in order to purchase a Disney World wedding package. But
with two water parks (Typhoon Lagoon and Blizzard Beach), four
theme parks (Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Disney-MGM Studios, and
Animal Kingdom), golf courses, and spas, few couples consider
that requirement a deterrent.
You can book Disney weddings up to a year in advance, although
last-minute couples who want a small wedding may be accommo-
dated (if the date is available) as soon as 21 days in advance.
Wedding in Wine Country
Surrounded by natural beauty, wineries make ideal venues for out-
door destination weddings. Perhaps the best-known Wine Country
destinations, Sonoma County (www.sonomawine.com) and Napa
Valley (www.napavintners.com) north of San Francisco are home
to hundreds of wineries. Ones open to the public have tasting
rooms, and those where weddings are routinely held feature more-
extensive facilities such as banquet halls.
In addition to California, a number of other states, as you can see
in the following list, have wine-growing regions with wineries avail-
able for celebrations:
 New York (www.newyorkwines.org): Several regions of the
state, including the East End of Long Island, the Finger Lakes,
and the Western tier produce award-winning wines.
 Oregon (www.oregonwine.org): Small-production wineries
offer intimate spaces for weddings.
 Pennsylvania (bvwinetrail.com): Lodgings in Brandywine
Valley are mostly limited to B&Bs.
 Texas (www.texaswinetrail.com): Hill Country also has
plenty of spas, art galleries, and even cooking classes to enter-
tain wine-loving wedding parties.
 Virginia (www.virginiawines.org): Boutique wineries in this
state stretch from near Washington, DC, to Richmond.
 Washington (www.washingtonwine.org): Only California sur-
passes this state in the number of wineries.

If tying the knot in a winery sounds idyllic to you, look for wineries
with on-premise restaurants that prepare food conceived to com-
plement the house vintages. Even more convenient are wineries
with an inn on the premises or nearby that can house your guests.
Exploring more U.S. locations
Spanning the 3,200 miles from northern Maine to southern
California are countless other places well-suited for a destination
wedding. Whether your taste runs to the charming, the luxurious,
or the unusual, you can find a wonderful place to wed.
Churches, synagogues, catering halls, restaurants, and hotels win
the lion’s share of wedding business (you can find them in almost
any city; check the Yellow Pages), but many more options are avail-
able for couples who want something different or want guaranteed-
gorgeous wedding photos. Imagine a backdrop of a national or
state park, outside a lighthouse, on a ferry or riverboat, on horse-
back at a dude ranch, or in a private estate or mansion. The
choices are endless, depending on your own tastes and budget.
Southern charms
Weddings in a southern location can take you back in time. Often
the focus is on tradition and heritage, and “good old Southern
cooking” invariably delights wedding guests. Outside the big cities,
weddings in the South tend to be less expensive than in other
parts of the country. A few of my top southern picks include
 Sevier County, Tennessee: Dotted with wedding chapels 
and home to Dollywood, Gatlinburg, and Pigeon Forge, this
affordable mountainous destination (www.smokymountain-
guide.com) is the only county in the United States where 
a couple can pre-apply for their marriage license online
(https://sevier-tn.mygovonline.com/clerk/modules/
marriagelicense) and pick it up at the courthouse after they
arrive.
 Asheville, North Carolina: Comfortable even in summer, this
city (www.exploreasheville.com; 828-258-6101) is surrounded
by the Blue Ridge Mountains (in other words, you have to make
an effort to get a bad wedding picture outdoors), and Asheville
activities range from hiking to gallery-hopping.
Mountaintop marriage
Winter is prime time for ski resorts, and nothing is as beautiful or
exhilarating as boarding a gondola with your guests (or even leading

the way from a chairlift), arriving at a specially prepared perch, and
reciting your vows surrounded by snow-capped mountains.
If you want to marry atop a major mountain and don’t have a
favorite one, visit www.skiusa.com or call 800-754-7669 to research
the possibilities, which are organized by state. After you have a ski
resort in mind, find and visit its Web site. Then call or e-mail to ask
to speak for someone who can provide wedding information.
The downside to a winter mountaintop wedding (aside from the
big chill) is this: During the short snowy season, couples may find
getting the full attention of vendors frustrating. Not only are ski
resorts more crowded then, but many outdoor venues aren’t even
open in winter. So you have fewer choices, bigger crowds, and
higher prices.
The largest ski resort in the United States, Vail, Colorado, has a
Web site for summer visitors with a section devoted to weddings
(vail.snow.com/summerhome.asp). Vail presents summer lovers
with a choice of venues on the mountain, in the village, and in
nearby places such as ranches, parks, and other outdoor locations.
Ski resorts are eager for business during the warmer months,
which is when the majority of weddings take place. Some ski
resorts are open only for a short summer season that extends from
just before Independence Day until right after Labor Day. To attract
vacationers, they add all kinds of activities, from mountain biking
and bungee jumping to horseback riding and hot-air ballooning.
Be sure to find out when a particular resort has the best wedding
weather (and is open for business) before deciding on that 
destination. Depending on the region, ski season starts as early 
as Thanksgiving and stretches (out West at least) into early 
spring. The biggest crowds come for the holidays — Thanksgiving,
Christmas, New Year’s — when hotel prices soar and availability
drops. So if you have your heart set on a winter wedding, January
and anytime up until winter break will be most affordable and least
crowded.
Coastal capers
Having your wedding in a quaint coastal town may be your fantasy.
If so, the best place I can think of is Newport, Rhode Island
(www.gonewport.com).
This small city on the New England seacoast seems custom-made
for romance, and has a dedicated Web site to help you plan a wed-
ding (www.yournewportwedding.com). In America’s sailing capital,
you can choose a beach wedding, a picnic reception in Fort Adams
Chapter 7: Staying Close to Home: The United States and Canada 115

State Park in full view of the harbor, or even a ceremony and 
reception inside a turn-of-the-century mansion (www.newport
mansions.org).
You take Manhattan
New York City is drawing an increasing number of couples to tie the
knot, primarily because this booming metropolis is such a fascinat-
ing place for a honeymoon. Broadway theater, the best shopping,
museums that hold the world’s treasures, superior restaurants in
every price range, great hotels, authentic ethnic enclaves, and land-
marks that include the Statue of Liberty, the Empire State Building,
and the United Nations make New York a must-see at some point 
in every couple’s life. Both http://gonyc.about.com and www.
nycvisit.com can guide you around the city.
Some New York options include
 Museums and more museums: New York is home to museums
grand and small, and many of them make spaces available for
wedding celebrations. Find a list with approximate rental fees
at http://nymag.com/weddings/listings/locations.
 Puck Building: At the edge of New York’s SoHo neighborhood,
the landmark Puck Building (www.thepuckbuilding.com) is
on the National Historic Register and a favorite with couples
who want to create a unique environment starting from the
bare walls.
 The Waldorf Astoria Hotel: The gold standard for a New York
wedding is the Waldorf Astoria (www.weddingatthewaldorf.
com). It contains more than three-dozen gilded banquet rooms
that can accommodate parties ranging in size from 20 to 2,000
under glittering chandeliers.
Contrary to the ultra-high costs of most weddings in Manhattan,
you do have a modest option: the private, nondenominational
chapel of the City Clerk’s office (nycmarriagebureau.com). On a
typical day, about 40 couples tie the knot there at a cost of $40 for
the license plus $25 for the civil ceremony.
Following a downtown ceremony, frugal folks can head for the
nearby Brooklyn Bridge walkway. On the bridge you can pose for
dramatic pictures against the East River and city skyline. To keep
the event low-cost, either head back into Manhattan’s Chinatown
or cross over to the Brooklyn side and walk to Atlantic Avenue for
a Middle Eastern wedding feast.

Coupling in Canada
Ranked as the world’s best country in which to live by the United
Nations, Canada is a clean, safe, progressive nation whose natural
beauty stretches from coast to coast. Add to that a favorable
exchange rate, cosmopolitan cities as charming and cultured as
many in Europe, and a polyglot society that reflects the country’s
English, French, and Native American roots, and you’ve got a coun-
try to marry in that’s both foreign and familiar.
Each province has its own set of regulations that must be met to
obtain a marriage license. Weddings are conducted as civil cere-
monies. Following that service, couples can also be blessed by a
religious officiant. Although seven out of ten Canadians identify
themselves as either Roman Catholic or Protestant, Canada is a
multicultural nation where many different spiritual beliefs are fol-
lowed and respected.
On July 20, 2005, Canada’s Equal Marriage Bill was proclaimed into
law in Canada, making it legal for same-sex couples to exchange
vows there. Since then, Canada has emerged as a favored destina-
tion for gay and lesbian weddings. However, the U.S. doesn’t legally
recognize marriages of gay U.S. citizens in Canada.
On the following pages, you can read about what entices couples to
marry in Canada’s leading cities and get links to official tourism
sites. For general information, you may find these resources helpful:
 Canada tourism online: The main Web site for gathering infor-
mation on Canada online is www.explore.canada.travel.
Every province, territory, and mid-to-big city also has its own
dedicated Web site.
 Air Canada discounts: Group Express is the name of Air
Canada’s reduced-fare program for ten people or more travel-
ing together. To find out how to arrange a trip for your group,
go to www.aircanada.com or call 800-268-0024.
If you or any members of your wedding party are traveling
between the United States and Canada, be sure to carry and pres-
ent a valid passport. For more info on passports, see Chapter 11.
Weddings with a French accent
Canada’s Québec province offers many of the same charms as
France — fine food, historic treasures, Paris chic, joie de vivre —
Chapter 7: Staying Close to Home: The United States and Canada 117

without the obstacles of marrying in that country. In its two major
cities, Montreal and Québec City, you’re as liable to hear French
spoken as English. Both are ports along the Saint Lawrence
Seaway, accessible via car, bus, train, air, and even cruise ship. 
To find out what it takes to get legally married in Québec, go to
www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/english/publications/generale/
maria-a.htm.
When you call a phone number in Quebec, you’ll first hear French
spoken. Start speaking in English, and the person on the other end
will respond in English.
Marrying in Montreal
The French-speaking capital of Canada, Montreal (www.tourisme-
montreal.org; 877-266-5687) is a sophisticated metropolis with a
vibrant historic district that overlooks the waterfront.
In addition to private rooms in Montreal’s excellent hotels and
restaurants serving the finest cuisine this side of the Left Bank,
couples can get married in
 A casino shaped like an ocean liner (www.casino-de-
montreal.com/montreal/nav/en/home)
 Montreal Botanical Garden (www2.ville.montreal.qc.ca/
jardin/en/menu.htm)
 A riverboat (www.bateau-mouche.com)
 Chapel of the Sacred Heart in the 1672 Notre Dame Church
(Catholics only) (www.montreal.com/tourism/churches.
html)
And the ceremony and reception sites aren’t the only places that
are uncommonly charming. Montreal has abundant spots for a
wedding party to explore before and after the main event. From the
top of Mount Royal to La Ronde amusement park, from the horse-
drawn caleches that clip-clop along cobblestone streets to the fun
of a bateau-mouche river cruise, this is a city to love.
If you’re interested in getting married in Montreal, contact the
tourism office to request a recommendation for a local wedding
planner or work with a coordinator at a local hotel.
Ambling down l’aisle in Québec City
Québec City (www.quebecregion.com/e/mar-index.asp;
877-783-1608), capital of the province of Québec, presents the per-
fect backdrop for utterly romantic weddings. This city is the heart

of French civilization in North America, and couples have long
been drawn to its ancient walled center, where narrow, winding
streets date back four centuries to the city’s 1608 founding.
Civil ceremonies and receptions in Québec City are typically held
indoors at restaurants and aboard riverboats. The city is also
home to many beautiful churches, and its wedding office
(418-649-3501) can recommend specific venues.
The hotel that towers above the St. Lawrence River and overlooks
the old city is the castle-like Le Château Frontenac (www.fairmont.
com/frontenac; 418-692-3861), which has hosted many wedding
over the years, ranging from small parties in suites to major fetes
in its Grand Ballroom. (See Figure 7-3.)
Figure 7-3: A romantic setting in front of the Frontenac in Québec City.
Québec winters can get very cold, but hearty couples may still
want to consider scheduling their destination wedding to coincide
with the city’s annual winter carnival, the biggest in the world. For
carnival dates and info, check out www.carnaval.qc.ca.
Another amazing place to chill is Québec’s Ice Hotel (www.ice
hotel-canada.com; 877-505-0423), which has a dedicated chapel
and several wedding packages to choose from. Its season extends
usually from early January to April 1. The ceremony takes place
within the hotel, and a bar is available for a cocktail reception.
Afterward a couple can repair to a wedding-night suite, snuggling
into a sleeping bag or under a heavy fur blanket and keeping each
other warm until morning.

Saying vows in Vancouver
Year after year named “best city in the Americas” by a leading
travel magazine, vibrant, multicultural Vancouver (www.tourism
vancouver.com; 604-683-2000) lies between the Coast Mountains
and the Pacific Ocean and offers couples an impressive array of
facilities and activities. Here you can find sites just right for a 
destination wedding — both out in nature and in the comfortable
indoors. The place to look for information on marrying in British
Columbia is www.vs.gov.bc.ca/marriage/index.html.
Couples who don’t feel like choosing between indoors and out-
doors ought to consider marrying aboard one of the boats that
cruise Vancouver harbor (www.boatcruises.com; 604-688-7246).
Catered wedding packages provide food and drink for four-hour
receptions.
The great outdoors
Thanks to Vancouver’s mild weather (snow is rare and fresh ocean
breezes keep the sunniest summer days comfortable), well-kept
parks, and public access to most waterfronts and beaches, oppor-
tunities to marry outdoors abound.
Thousand-acre Stanley Park, the second largest in North America,
extends from the city’s downtown to the water’s edge. The park
has a number of breathtaking settings where couples hold wedding
ceremonies. Groups up to 50 can use many of the city’s fresh-air
locations without prior permission. However, no chairs, tents,
awnings, tables, decorations, alcohol, rice, or confetti are allowed.
If an outdoor ceremony followed by a picnic is your style and 
your group is larger than 50, you can reserve a site at www.city.
vancouver.bc.ca/parks/info/picnic/index.htm.
Unique adventures for you and your guests await before and after
the wedding. Guests can go on a guided kayaking trip, take a tree-
tops hike 100 feet above the forest floor (www.capbridge.com),
golf, snowboard on Grouse Mountain, join a whale-watching expe-
dition, or simply detox inside a seaweed wrap. (For more info,
check out Vancouver’s tourism Web site, mentioned at the begin-
ning of this section.)
Inside story
Vancouver has several top hotels alongside its waterfront that
boast extraordinary views from their reception spaces and guest
rooms.
Part II: Picking a Destination for Your Wedding 
120

 Herons at the Fairmont Waterfront: This hotel (www.
fairmont.com/waterfront; 800-257-7544) has two-story,
floor-to-ceiling windows with panoramic harbor views of the
mountains, Stanley Park, and cruise ships gliding into port. The
hotel’s catering team is super-experienced in orchestrating
weddings large and small.
 The Pan Pacific Vancouver: This hotel (www.panpacific.
com/Vancouver; 800-937-1515) boasts equally stunning views
and 20 different event rooms to cater to weddings of all sizes.
Other indoor venues include the Stanley Park Pavilion (www.
stanleyparkpavilion.com; 604-602-3088), adjacent to the park’s
gorgeous Rose Gardens. Because the facility offers all services —
catering in your choice of cuisine, floral arrangements, horse and
carriage tours in the park, photo and video, music, wedding cake —
it’s convenient for out-of-town couples to have a turnkey reception
here. With its sparkling chandeliers, raised altar, and private bride’s
room, the Chapel at Stanley Park (www.thechapelatstanleypark.
com; 604-688-0770) is a compatible setting for the ceremony.
This multicultural city also boasts more than 5,000 restaurants,
including ones that specialize in French, Asian, Greek, and Italian,
as well as Afghan, Lebanese, and Malaysian fare. So whatever your
culinary tastes, you can find a restaurant to hold a reception in. Go
to www.vancouver.com/restaurants for a list. When you find
ones that appeal to you, call to ask whether they have a private
dining room to host a wedding, what menu options they offer, the
prices, and date availability.
Athletes and spectators from all over the world will converge in
Vancouver for the 2010 Winter Olympics, so think twice before
scheduling a wedding there for the second half of February 2010.
Investigating other 
Canadian locations
Although you can find a variety of wedding destinations in
Montreal, Québec City, and Vancouver (see previous sections),
Canada has so much more to offer (I could probably write a book
on Canada wedding destinations alone). And this discussion
wouldn’t be complete without taking a look at what Toronto and
Niagara Falls have to offer.
Info on marrying in Ontario, the province that contains both
Toronto and the Niagara region, is available at www.cbs.gov.on.
ca/MCBS/ENGLISH/marriages.htm.
Chapter 7: Staying Close to Home: The United States and Canada 121

Tying the knot in Toronto
Even if you haven’t visited Toronto (www.torontotourism.com;
800-499-2514), you’ve probably seen it on film. Toronto has
appeared in countless movies that needed a clean, affordable
urban location. And thanks to the favorable exchange rate, prices
for wedding parties are as reasonable as they are for film crews.
Toronto has all the amenities one would expect in a major city
(excellent hotels as well as a wide range of fine and ethnic restau-
rants). The city has a vital waterfront and Paramount Canada’s
Wonderland (www3.paramountparks.com/canadaswonderland;
905-832-8131), the largest and most popular theme park in the
country. You can also give diverse, progressive Toronto its props
for being the first North American city to legalize weddings for gay
couples, including nonresidents.
Niagara nuptials
There are two cities named Niagara Falls: one in Canada and one in
New York State, across the river from each other. Facilities on the
Canadian side are more extensive and better tended than those of
their U.S. neighbor, so it’s worth crossing the border.
Less than a two-hour drive from Toronto, the iconic honeymoon
spot and natural wonder that is Niagara Falls (www.niagarafalls
tourism.com; 800-563-2557) makes a memorable wedding destina-
tion or an entertaining day trip from Toronto or Buffalo, New York,
for you and your guests. Couples can be married in wedding
chapels and gardens near the Falls, overlooking the Falls, and hov-
ering atop the Falls in a helicopter. You can even get hitched in the
wedding chapel inside Niagara Fallsview Casino (www.niagara
fallsviewcasinoresort.com; 866-789-8697).
If you bring your own officiant, you can get married on a Maid of
the Mist riverboat (www.maidofthemist.com), which comes
thrillingly close to the Horseshoe Falls (no reservations accepted).
Afterward, you can grab a bite at one of the Fallsview hotel restau-
rants, avoiding the tourist traps clogging the waterway.
Just a 20-minute drive north of the Falls, but a world apart,
Niagara-on-the-Lake (www.niagaraonthelake.com; 905-468-1950)
is a scenic village resplendent with gazebos and gardens perfect
for romantic summer weddings. The town center is one of
Canada’s National Historic Sites. Niagara-on-the-Lake is also home
to a large number of wineries and small inns, many of which pro-
vide sylvan settings for weddings and fine fare for receptions.

Heading to the Tropics 
and Islands
In This Chapter
 Considering a warm-weather destination wedding
 Cavorting in the Caribbean
 Traveling to Mexico and Central America
 Picking a Pacific Ocean island
T
ropical fantasies captivate many an engaged couple as they
picture themselves running away from it all to avoid an over-
priced, overproduced at-home wedding. Yet it need not be a fan-
tasy; having a destination wedding in the tropics is a real
possibility. Brides and grooms in search of great beaches, crystal-
clear waters, and weddings that are both easy-going and easy to
organize are choosing island getaways in record numbers.
Deciding on a tropical location requires an understanding of the
different features these destinations offer. Caribbean islands such
as Jamaica offer a wide choice of all-inclusives where weddings are
an everyday occurrence. Resorts along the coasts of Mexico add
spice to a tropical wedding. So if you’re tempted by tropical
locales, this chapter introduces you to the major ones where 
couples wed.
The Truth about Tropical
Destination Weddings
More than anywhere else, the tropics attract couples who want to
situate their wedding in a warm place where they can take advan-
tage of a full-service hotel and its amenities, soft-sand beaches,
outdoor sports, and romantic nights under starry skies.

Pondering the pros of a tropical 
wedding away
If the idea of transporting yourselves alone or with guests to marry
in a sun-drenched setting with an endless supply of frosty tropical
drinks appeals to you, look at both the advantages and disadvan-
tages before investing in an industrial-size tube of SPF30. Here are
the pros.
In addition to the it’s-a-wedding-and-a-beach-vacation-rolled-into-
one aspect and all the fun you can have, you can also count on:
 The ease of a turnkey wedding. The majority of destination
weddings are turnkey affairs, which means you can get mar-
ried with a minimum of fuss, especially if your guest list is
small and you’re basically okay with the standard options
included in a wedding package. Just about every good resort
in the tropics has played host to a wedding, if not hundreds or
even thousands of them. If it doesn’t have a coordinator on-
site, the resort can put you in touch with vendors it recom-
mends. And if your guest list expands — or if you’d rather be
on the beach than bargaining with a caterer — bring down
your own wedding planner or hire a local one. Wedding plan-
ners can also advise you as to the best ceremony spots and
wedding packages.
 The exhilaration of outdoor activities. Water lovers can
snorkel around reefs and wrecks, take boat tours, wind surf,
scuba dive, fish, and sail. On land, couples and guests can
spend time golfing, horseback riding, and unwinding in a spa.
 The flavor of foreign fare. Even in the most remote spots,
you can find familiar Continental fare, such as steak and
seafood dishes. Couples who want to spice things up can
choose authentic local dishes at restaurants and receptions.
 The charm of new people and cultures. Similar to tropical
temperatures, people of the tropics tend to be warm, too.
They’re proud of their surroundings and respond to you with
warmth and friendliness when you put out that vibe to them.
Considering the cons of getting 
married where it’s hot, hot, hot
Is there trouble in paradise? Could be. So it’s wise to approach a
wedding in the tropics with eyes open. Here are some cons:
Part II: Picking a Destination for Your Wedding 
124

 Passports required: With the exception of Puerto Rico and
the United States Virgin Islands (which I discuss later in this
chapter), you’ll be required to carry a passport by mid-2009.
Find out how to get a passport in Chapter 11.
 Heat: You have to love heat and not mind humidity if you
choose to marry in most torrid climes, although breezes and
ascents to higher elevations can mitigate those concerns.
Mold can also be a problem in hotel rooms in humid locales,
which makes a preliminary visit to sniff around a good idea.
 Bugs: Tropical winds keep insects away from beach areas, but
if you’re going to be spending time in a jungle or rainforest,
don’t say I didn’t warn you. You can find bugs the size of
cocker spaniels in those places. Okay, I exaggerate. But bring
bug spray. And a leash.
 “Island time”: Vendors who operate with an unhurried don’t-
worry-be-happy attitude aren’t for control-freak couples.
Everything gets done in time — but on their schedule.
 Evidence of poverty: Many tropical nations don’t enjoy the
same standard of living as the United States. You may
encounter people whose lives are hard as you travel around.
In some Caribbean and Mexican areas, crime rates are high.
Check out the situation in your destination by reading its
Consular Information Sheet at travel.state.gov.
Contemplating Your Choices 
for a Caribbean Wedding
Centuries ago, explorers brought back news of the treasures of the
Caribbean: A sultry climate fanned by trade winds, trees bearing
luscious fruit, miles of pristine beaches, and warm crystalline
waters the color of blue jewels. Today couples are still drawn to
the region for those same natural wonders, enhanced by a variety
of vivid cultures, myriad land and water activities, extraordinary
cuisines, and carefree weddings.
Hurricane season in the Caribbean stretches from (June 1–
November 30). Risk-aversive couples ought not book weddings
during that period. However, experienced travelers know that most
island days will be hot and sunny during that period. And if it
rains, the weather is more likely to bring just a passing shower.
Chapter 8: Heading to the Tropics and Islands 125

If you’re hesitant about having a tropical wedding because you
don’t think you can afford one in the Caribbean, you have options.
The Web site www.nofrillswedding.com, for instance, links to
planners on Jamaica, Antigua, St. Lucia, Nevis, and St. Kitts who
arrange beach weddings for couples on a tight budget. Information
on the most popular islands for destination weddings follows,
along with suggestions for other alluring spots.
Loving it up in Jamaica
One of couples’ favorite places for a destination wedding — thanks
to its numerous beaches, countless waterfalls, and multitude of all-
inclusive resorts (read about the advantages of all-inclusive wed-
dings in Chapter 6) — Jamaica has a soul and spirit all its own.
The rhythms of reggae infuse Jamaica, one of the biggest islands 
in the Caribbean. With 200 miles of sandy shores, nearly every
coastal Jamaican resort has a private beach. Visitors willing to tear
themselves away can fit in a trip to Dunn’s River Falls and the Bob
Marley Museum. Uncommon adventures beyond those range from
ATV safaris to river tubing to horseback rides that start up at the
cliffs and end with hooves splashing in warm, shallow waters.
To get married in Jamaica, apply for a license before leaving home
and wait 24 to 48 hours after arrival (hotels require the extra day)
to hold the ceremony. Full details are at www.visitjamaica.
com/vacation_themes/weddings_and_honeymoons/getting_
married_in_jamaica.aspx.
Weddings at all-inclusives and other resorts
In Jamaica, all-inclusive hotels and resorts are popular places to
get married in. Leading all-inclusive resorts you may want to check
out include the following:
 Sandals: Jamaica is where Sandals (www.sandals.com), origi-
nator of the weddingmoon (wedding-honeymoon combo) con-
cept, got its start. Couples can choose from seven different
locations on this island, including the newest, Sandals
Whitehouse, designed to resemble a European village.
Basic weddings at all Sandals properties (refer to Figure 8-1) are
free for couples who stay for at least seven nights. If that’s more
sun ’n’ fun than you can handle, weddings (complete with free
consultant services) start at $750. With add-ons such as a $1,200
photo package, a bride’s personal dressing assistant ($75), and
even a destination wedding dress ($500) that you can buy on the
premises, the total cost can spike. To work out the details for
your wedding, check out Sandals’ Web site or call 888-SANDALS.
Part II: Picking a Destination for Your Wedding 
126

Figure 8-1: Sandals Resorts’ free weddings (with a weeklong stay) are simple
affairs.
If you’re bringing children along to the wedding, you can stage
a weddingmoon at Sandals’ family-friendly sibling, Beaches
resorts (www.beaches.com). Together, the two host more
than 15,000 weddings a year in Caribbean locations.
 SuperClubs: Another adults-only all-inclusive, SuperClubs
(www.superclubs.com or 877-467-8737) also has a kid-friendly
brand, Breezes (www.superclubs.com/brand_breezes/
specials.asp). Similar to Sandals and other all-inclusives,
these resorts are considered by some couples to be “mills”
that conduct weddings all day long — but you can’t beat the
price when it’s free.
 Couples Resorts: Exclusively for grown-ups (topless bathing
permitted), Couples Resorts offers free basic wedding deals
like the other all-inclusives mentioned. Visitors to the Couples
Resorts Web site (www.couples.com) can reserve a wedding
date and time online, or you can call 800-268-7537.
Regular Jamaican resorts, where you pay separately for food and
drinks and that are known for hosting great weddings, include
 Royal Plantation: Run by the daughter of Sandals’ owner, this
next-generation property (www.royalplantation.com) is
more intimate and upscale than dad’s digs. Its small beach-
side gazebo provides a lovely setting for an intimate wedding.
Chapter 8: Heading to the Tropics and Islands 127

 Jake’s: Casual beachfront weddings at this hip Negril hide-
away (www.islandoutpost.com) start at around $1,000.
Reception menus offer grilled lobster and bananas flambé.
 Half Moon: For more than half a century, couples have had
weddings alongside Half Moon’s (www.halfmoon.com) crescent
beach. Following a wedding here, some couples plant a tree on
the grounds, and then return to visit on their anniversary.
Uniquely Jamaica
Ceremonies in Jamaica aren’t limited to resorts and all-inclusives.
Alternate venues, which you can learn more about at www.visit
jamaica.com include these scenic spots:
 The Blue Lagoon in Port Antonio
 Lover’s Leap at the South Coast
 Cliffs of Negril
 Gardens in Ocho Rios
 Former Plantation Great House in Montego Bay
Although Jamaica has many charms, couples should be aware that
this country has problems with crime and poverty outside resort
areas. And insistent vendors, offering to sell you everything from
hair braiding to ganja (marijuana), congregate in public areas at
the edges of vacation spots. You can brush off most of them with a
simple, “No thanks.”
Island-hopping in the Bahamas
A short 35-minute flight from Miami, the Bahamas (www.
bahamas.com) are the closest tropical islands to the U.S. mainland.
Quintessential beach getaways, the Bahamas consist of 700 islands
with soft, coral-sand beaches.
Just 20 of the islands are inhabited, and most of the action takes
place on New Providence, which includes Nassau and Paradise
Island. Because many of the islands are fairly close to one another,
couples sometimes marry on one that provides a wide array of
wedding services and then island-hop via ferry or small plane to
another that is more remote for their honeymoon.
Wherever you stay in the Bahamas, getting married is relatively
hassle-free. The Ministry of Tourism maintains a Weddings and
Honeymoon Unit to answer questions and make recommendations.

Major island resorts
So what are your options? More than nine out of ten couples who
wed in the Bahamas do so at a resort hotel because everything you
need is at your command: ceremony sites, connections to officiants,
coordinators to do your bidding. Some of my top picks include
 Atlantis: The biggest resort in the Caribbean, action-packed
Atlantis (www.atlantis.com) keeps adding more reasons to
get you there. The latest are Aquaventure, a 63-acre water
park, and The Cove, an adults-only retreat (those with kids are
welcome in three other towers). On-site wedding specialists
handle arrangements, and outdoor events have a designated
alternative area in case of rain.
 Sandals Royal Bahamian: A honeymoon haven with four-
poster beds, lavish bathrooms, and upgrades to suites with
private plunge pools and butler service, the resort offers
Sandals’ stay-seven-nights-get-a-free-wedding deal (www.
sandals.com/general/wedding.cfm).
 Pelican Bay at Lucaya: This resort can accommodate parties
of up to 80 people and has a just-for-two wedding package
priced under $3,000. Pelican Bay’s Web site (www.pelican
bayhotel.com/weddings/realweddings.asp) displays sto-
ries and photos from actual on-site weddings.
Although the majority of people do marry at a resort hotel, do-it-
yourselfers can tie the knot at two public beaches on New
Providence, Goodman’s Bay and Cabbage Beach. For local flavor at
the reception, include delicacies like frosty Bahama Mamas and
the fruits of the sea, including lobster, crab, conch chowder, and
fritters.
Although public sands are regularly groomed, seaweed washes up
overnight. At a hotel, you can be confident that the beach will be
swept before your wedding — and if it isn’t, there’s always some-
one on-site to address your concerns.
Off the beaten path
If you want a more intimate Bahamian experience, you have plenty
of choices. Pure, scenic, and uncrowded, Bahamas Out Islands
(www.myoutislands.com) offer miles of empty beaches and a scat-
tering of small towns. Places where weddings are most memorable
include the following:
Chapter 8: Heading to the Tropics and Islands 129

 Abaco Beach Resort: Set beside crystal-clear turquoise
waters on Abaco Island, basic weddings start at $645. You can
find a form to check wedding-date availability and room rates
on the Web site (www.abacobeachresort.com).
 Fernandez Bay Village: This family-friendly, Cat Island resort
(www.fernandezbayvillage.com) hosts informal sunset tiki-
torch ceremonies on the beach or atop Mount Alvernia with
bridal bouquets composed of flowers picked in its garden.
 Four Seasons Resort: The magnificent Emerald Bay Beach, a
tropical garden, and a stone church atop a bluff on Great
Exuma are among the settings this luxury resort’s wedding
specialists can arrange. Access the Web site at (www.
fourseasons.com/greatexuma).
Beachcombing in Barbados
Among the southernmost islands in the Caribbean and the one that
lies farthest to the east, Barbados is at the outer edge of the hurri-
cane belt. Although it remains susceptible during the rainy season,
Barbados has been more fortunate weather-wise than many neigh-
bors to the north.
Barbados is the most popular spot in the Caribbean for British
couples in search of warmth and sun and also is welcoming to
sophisticated Americans. A member of the Commonwealth,
Barbados maintains a distinct British accent and visitors note that
this island is a bit more formal and reserved than other islands.
For example, jackets are required for men at the island’s smartest
restaurants at dinner.
You can find marriage requirements along with links to local 
wedding planners and other vendors at www.barbados.org/
weddings.htm.
Couples can wed in Barbados the day they arrive, although you
may want to spend time first exploring the island. Barbados has a
lot to offer, keeping you and your guests occupied with activities
that can include seaside horseback rides, ocean sails, tours of 
historic plantation houses, visits to flower forests and wildlife 
preserves, and the excitement of attending a cricket, polo, or
rugby match. Taking a driving tour that encircles the island, from
its western Caribbean shore to its rugged northern coast to the
eastern beaches pounded by the Atlantic is also great fun — 
especially if you stop off for a sampling at a rum distillery.

Flying fish — you can actually see them leap out of the water — are
a Bajan delicacy. Other local seafood to enhance a reception meal
include freshly caught lobster, swordfish, and snapper.
Scenic ceremony settings
In Barbados, you have a choice of picturesque places to hold your
wedding. Ceremony venues that local planners can book include
churches, sunset cruises, plantation estates, under the shade of a
flamboyant tree, beside a cliff, on the beach, as well as the follow-
ing locations. Each has its own staff, so you don’t necessarily have
to work with a planner to wed there:
 Flower Forest: A 50-acre preserve with a gazebo used for 
weddings that is surrounded by colorful blossoms.
 Orchid World: Six acres abloom with 20,000 vivid specimens.
 Harrison’s Cave: Underwater waterfalls and rock formations
create an otherworldly ambiance.
Checking out the resorts
Couples who come to Barbados to marry tend to stay in one of its
resorts. Many of these resorts offer first-class accommodations,
beautiful settings, and standard wedding packages that can be
embellished to suit your needs. Places well-equipped include
 Almond Beach Club: This all-inclusive (www.almondresorts.
com/Resorts/AlmondClub) has standard rooms and luxury
suites. The basic $400 wedding package includes breakfast in
bed the morning after your wedding.
 Cobblers Cove: A beachfront hotel (www.cobblerscove.com)
reminiscent of an English estate, Cobblers’ $900 wedding
package includes the basics plus transportation to acquire
your marriage license.
 Crane Beach Hotel: The extraordinary cliff-top setting of
Barbados’ first hotel (www.thecrane.com) overlooks the
beach way down below. A basic wedding package starts at
$600.
 Fairmont Royal Pavilion: Weddings are completely customized
at this stunningly romantic beach resort (www.fairmont.com/
royalpavilion), which is child-free from November through
April.
 Little Arches: This charming, ten-room, adults-only hotel
(www.littlearches.com) has a private wedding garden that
can accommodate 40 guests.

Making waves in Bermuda
Way out in the Atlantic Ocean, 600 miles off the coast of North
Carolina, Bermuda has been a favorite destination of wedding and
honeymoon couples for generations. Unlike the Caribbean islands,
its climate isn’t tropical year-round; winters can get nippy. But that
doesn’t stop couples who like to golf, sail, and tool around pretty
Bermuda on rental mopeds from visiting during the cooler months.
Bermuda’s British tradition and high standard of living also differ-
entiate it from most neighbors to the south. You don’t see grinding
poverty here. In fact, prices are on par with the United States, and
even modest accommodations can be pricey. In the following sec-
tions, I suggest some lovely Bermuda locations.
Marrying in Bermuda isn’t complicated but does require advanced
planning because the law insists that a Notice of Intended Marriage
be published in local papers 15 days prior to the wedding. For
more info, go to www.bermudatourism.com/weddings/pdf/
Marriage.pdf. Check out the dedicated Bermuda weddings Web
site (www.bermudatourism.com/weddings) to find local planners
and download a free wedding brochure.
Discovering where love’s in bloom
Come summer, Bermuda is at its peak with flowers everywhere and
waters warm enough to swim in. Although most couples choose to
marry at their hotel (usually beside its beach or on a terrace over-
looking the water), other popular spots that a local wedding plan-
ner can help arrange include churches, gardens, cliff tops above
the sea, aboard sailboats, and the following locations (for info on
hiring a wedding planner to help, see Chapter 5):
 Astwood Cove: A beachfront park with a stone stairway that
leads down to the water’s edge
 Horseshoe Bay Beach: A wide crescent beach with pink sands
 Gibb’s Hill Lighthouse: A timeless backdrop for photos
You may also want to get married or at least have your picture
taken under Bermuda’s romantic moongates (see Figure 8-2). You
can find these round archways across the island. Legend has it that
a couple who kisses under one (no time limit posted) will have a
long, happy life together.
Part II: Picking a Destination for Your Wedding 
132

Figure 8-2: Pose under a moongate for
luck if you wed in Bermuda.
Accommodating your desires
Lodgings on Bermuda that are well-equipped to handle wedding
parties range from small inns to cottage colonies that hug the
shore to large resort hotels. My faves include
 Ariel Sands: This collection of cottages (www.arielsands.
com) is anchored by a hip main building with a restaurant
overlooking the ocean and decorated with personal photos of
its owner, actor Michael Douglas. Many couples opt to marry
on the beach here, arriving via horse-drawn carriage. The
resort can put you in touch with the outside planner they use.
 Pink Beach Club: Bermuda’s legendary pink sand adds to the
allure of this charming cottage colony (www.pinkbeach.com)
that even has its own moongate.
Sporting times
A haven for golfers, Bermuda boasts the highest concentration of
golf courses per square mile in the world. Other activities a desti-
nation wedding party may enjoy include visiting the Royal Naval
Dockyard (crafty types can paint commemorative wedding plates
at Bermuda Clayworks), a snorkel safari, and kayak tours.
Bermuda’s gorgeous beaches, with their countless romantic coves
and inlets, are a delight for swimmers and smoochers.
Want to go “semiformal” to your wedding? For the groom that can
mean wearing a tuxedo jacket . . . and Bermuda shorts! It looks per-
fectly appropriate here, even when the bride dons a long gown.

Exploring other Caribbean locales
With a total of 28 territories and more than 7,000 islands in the
Caribbean, the area’s appeal is vast. For an overview, pick up a
copy of Caribbean For Dummies by Darwin Porter and Danforth
Prince (Wiley). To start researching on your own, look into these
other contenders for a wedding away:
 Antigua: Proud of its 365 beaches, breezy Antigua (www.
antigua-barbuda.org) has secluded spots for weddings as
well as full-service resorts that offer complete packages.
 Aruba: Lying outside the hurricane zone, beachy, Dutch-
accented Aruba (www.aruba.com) hosts weddings year-round.
 Dominican Republic: Affordable all-inclusive resorts that
cater to families dot the country’s rapidly expanding Punta
Cana region. Explore it at www.dominicanrepublic.com.
 St. Lucia: Pretty St. Lucia (www.stlucia.org) makes it easy
to get married on the day of arrival. Local planners (check out
www.aweddinginstlucia.com) can even work with cruise
ship passengers to arrange in-port weddings.
 Turks & Caicos: The next great place and under major devel-
opment now, T&C (www.turksandcaicostourism.com) is
growing in popularity, thanks to the vast, untouched beaches
on its 40 tranquil islands.
Going to the Caribbean 
without a Passport
Because both Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands
(USVI) enjoy the status of U.S. territories, no passports are
required to travel in or out of these islands. However, if you do
have a passport, bring it. Otherwise you need to present a certified
birth certificate and photo ID to apply for a marriage license. I go
into more detail about these territories in the following sections.
Preferring Puerto Rico
The prospect of land and water adventures, getting lucky at a
casino or golf course, and staying in a big full-service resort or 
a small inn that offers personal attention entices couples to wed 
in Puerto Rico (find out more and explore attractions at www.
gotopuertorico.com).
Part II: Picking a Destination for Your Wedding 
134

Judges or clergy perform legal marriages in Puerto Rico. For com-
plete details on requirements, which include a blood test, call the
Demographic Registry (787-767-9120) before plunging into the
island’s turquoise waters and icy piña coladas.
Tying the knot at resorts and hotels
Capital city and site of the international airport, San Juan has the
island’s biggest, splashiest casino hotels and outposts of Hilton,
Marriott, InterContinental, Sheraton, and Radisson hotel brands.
Have you been saving up frequent-guest points or frequent-mileage
rewards? Consider exchanging them for free hotel nights in San
Juan to curtail wedding costs.
Some of the most romantic spots to marry in San Juan include
 El Convento Hotel: A former nunnery in the center of charming
Old San Juan, El Convento (www.elconvento.com; 800-468-
2779) works with designated local planners plus its in-house
events team to produce weddings anywhere from the original
chapel of the Carmelite convent to its outdoor restaurant patio
and romantic hotel ballroom.
 The Horned Dorset Primavera: Two hours east of San Juan
Airport, the Horned Dorset (www.horneddorset.com;
800-633-1857) is a Relais et Châteaux property, which means
every aspect of a wedding there is custom-tailored.
 Ritz-Carlton, San Juan: Reception spots at the elegant Ritz-
Carlton (www.ritzcarlton.com/en/Properties/SanJuan;
787-253-1700) range from an intimate private dining room to
the ballroom, which has a capacity of 500 guests.
For those on a budget who like to get close to nature and want to
experience less-urban Puerto Rico, family-run paradores (www.
gotoparadores.com) are small country inns in picturesque loca-
tions. Spanish is the first language, so having a local planner is an
asset. Ask the tourism bureau for recommendations.
Hanging loose and having fun
Because Puerto Rico is a relatively small island, just 100 miles wide
and 35 miles from north to south, you can experience the following
highlights during a stay regardless of where you hold the wedding
and spend nights:
 Old San Juan: Windswept El Morro fort overlooks San Juan
Bay. Across the water from it, the Bacardi Rum Distillery
offers tours and samplings of its world-famous rums.
Chapter 8: Heading to the Tropics and Islands 135

 El Yunque Rainforest: Waterfalls rush beside hiking trails,
and you can swim in natural pools while el coquí, Puerto
Rico’s tree frogs, serenade.
 Río Camuy Cave Park: The world’s only tropical cavern with
an underground river, Río Camuy has trams and trolleys that
lead deep into a dramatically illuminated 170-foot-deep cave.
Uncovering the pleasures 
of the USVI
Couples who appreciate the familiarity of the United States, the fun
of water sports, and the relaxation of beach resorts flock to the
U.S. Virgin Islands (www.usvitourism.vi), which consists of three
main islands: St. Thomas, St. Croix, and St. John.
St. Thomas, the most developed of the islands, is a magnet for
shoppers as well as a beautiful beach location. St. Croix is home to
Buck Island National Monument, which has a unique underwater
nature trail with live coral grottoes and resplendently hued fish.
Most of St. John is a U.S. National Park, so its pristine protected
areas are plentiful.
To download a USVI wedding and honeymoon brochure that 
recommends wedding planners and other vendors, go to www.
usvitourism.vi/en/pdfs/wedding_guide_MECH.pdf. You can
retrieve a marriage information fact sheet as well as the marriage
license requirements and application at www.usvitourism.vi/
en/pdfs/marriage_app.pdf.
Top resorts for romance include the following:
 The Buccaneer (www.thebuccaneer.com; 800-255-3881) on St.
Croix gets top marks from couples for ceremony locations,
catering, and vendors. Services of a wedding coordinator are
included in packages. (See Figure 8-3.)
 Caneel Bay (www.caneelbay.com; 888-767-3966) on St. John is
upscale and unplugged. Weddings, organized by the on-site
team, are held overlooking Turtle Bay Beach.
 The Ritz-Carlton, St. Thomas (www.ritzcarlton.com/
en/Properties/StThomas; 340-775-3333) has a wedding 
advisor on the property who sets up events ranging from a
beachfront wedding for two to a ceremony for up to 49 aboard
the hotel’s own catamaran.
Part II: Picking a Destination for Your Wedding 
136

Figure 8-3: A simple floral arch marks this wedding spot at The Buccaneer
Resort in the U.S. Virgin Islands.
 Frenchman’s Reef & Morning Star Marriott Beach Resort
(http://marriott.com/hotels/travel/sttfr-
frenchmans-reef-and-morning-star-marriott-beach-
resort; 340-776-8500) is a big St. Thomas family-oriented
resort that includes a Webcast in its four wedding packages
(priced $850 to $2,650).
In addition to those traditional resorts, the USVI also has very
affordable, environmentally sustainable places to wed. Mount
Victory Camp (www.mtvictorycamp.com) on St. Croix consists of
platform dwellings and bungalows. The entire camp sleeps 22 and
can be booked for under $500 nightly, depending on the season. 
On St. John, Maho Bay Camps (www.maho.org) has tent cottages
overlooking the Caribbean. Barbecue areas and fresh water are
available at nearby hiking trails and plantation ruins.
Marrying in Mexico
Exotic yet close, Mexico has long been a favorite destination of
travelers from the United States. Sunny, hot, and affordable, this
country offers couples a choice of venues that range from all-
inclusive resorts with free weddings, to places of rare charm and
natural beauty, to historic sites and ancient ruins. With so much 
to savor (not to mention that zesty cuisine and those thirst-
quenching margaritas), Mexico (www.visitmexico.com) makes 
a great case for combining both a wedding and honeymoon.
Chapter 8: Heading to the Tropics and Islands 137

Mexico is almost as vast as the United States. To save flying time,
couples who live near the U.S. East Coast tend to set their south-of-
the-border weddings in places along Mexico’s Caribbean coast.
Those who reside closer to California and the West choose destina-
tions along Mexico’s Pacific coastline. Midwesterners take their
pick of both.
Marriage laws in Mexico vary from state to state, just as in the
United States. The office of the Registro Civil (civil registry) in the
jurisdiction where you plan to marry can supply complete details
about the requirements. Be advised that in some locales a blood
test and a chest X-ray (that you get after arrival) are necessary.
Results must be in Spanish, and foreign documents must be trans-
lated into that language. Learn more at www.mexperience.com/
guide/weddings/getting_married.htm.
Getting married at an all-inclusive
Similar to the Caribbean, Mexico is home to many all-inclusive
resorts. If you plan on vacationing in this country for a specified
number of days, you can take advantage of free basic wedding
packages or pay for upgraded affairs at them. Each of the following
hotel groups has properties on both Mexican coasts. As you look
into them, you can find family-friendly all-inclusives and adults-
only ones. Many are quite lavish, yet cost considerably less than
similar resorts in the United States and the Caribbean.
 Barcelo Hotels (www.barcelo.com)
 Palace Resorts (www.palaceresorts.com)
 Dreams Resorts & Spas (www.dreamsresorts.com)
 Occidental Hotels & Resorts (www.occidentalhotels.com)
 Sol Meliá Hotels & Resorts (www.solmelia.com)
Checking out the Caribbean coast
Beaches and bath-warm waters have made Mexico’s Yucatan
Peninsula the country’s biggest tourist draw. Most of the action
takes place along the Riviera Maya, a 75-mile-long coastal stretch
that includes Cancun, the island of Cozumel, and Playa del Carmen
across from Cozumel.
The Riviera Maya (www.rivieramaya.com) has more all-inclusive
resorts than anywhere else in Mexico. Check out the preceding
section for a list of resorts in both eastern and western Mexico.
Part II: Picking a Destination for Your Wedding 
138

Resorts belonging to the following groups are exclusive to the
Caribbean coast, provide free on-site coordinators, and offer free
basic weddings as well as more-elaborate affairs.
 Iberostar Hotels & Resorts (www.iberostar.com)
 Karisma Hotels & Resorts (www.karismahotels.com)
 Secrets Resorts (www.secretsresorts.com)
Not all Riviera Maya weddings take place in hotels, of course.
Those who want a unique historic experience can marry at a bare-
foot Mayan Indian ceremony (www.weddingsinplaya.com/
weddings_mayan.html) performed by a shaman.
Couples who are their most amorous in aquatic settings can marry
at the Occidental Grand Cozumel Hotel (www.grandcozumel.com).
This property’s underwater wedding package includes boat rental,
diving equipment, ceremony, flowers, cake, and champagne. The
latter three are to be savored above sea level.
Picking Mexico’s Pacific coast
The warm Sea of Cortez meets the Pacific Ocean in Los Cabos at
the southernmost tip of the Baja California peninsula. One of
Mexico’s most popular resort areas, Los Cabos gets 350 days of
sunshine a year and is home to the resort towns of Cabo San Lucas
and San José del Cabo, separated by 20 miles.
Chapter 8: Heading to the Tropics and Islands 139
Spicing up your Mexican wedding
For a wedding that reflects Mexico’s color and cultures, consider adding these ele-
ments to your fiesta:
 Dress: Guayabera shirt for him and cotton Mexican wedding dress for her
 Decorations: Colorful loteria playing cards, Talavera ceramics, and papel picado
banners
 Special events: Tequila tastings and tours of ruins
 Hors d’oeuvres: Tiny, filled tortillas
 Tableware: Hand-blown Mexican glassware and painted pottery at the reception
 Music: Mariachi band or acoustic guitarist
 Wedding cake: A traditional sweet tres leches

All-inclusive fans can find upscale resorts in Los Cabos. But by
searching for the term Los Cabos hotels on www.tripadvisor.com,
you can identify alternate accommodations with low prices and
high ratings. For example, the admired ten-room Bungalows Hotel
(www.cabobungalows.com) can host up to 50 people for a wedding.
Because your upcoming wedding is (one hopes) a once-in-a-lifetime
affair, don’t overlook Los Cabos’ luxury lodgings. Even if you can’t
afford to overnight in them for long, you may want to arrange a pre-
wedding meal or spa event on their premises. If this idea sounds
good to you, be sure to check out the following, and should you
want advice, get in touch with their on-site wedding coordinators.
 Marquis Los Cabos: Here (www.marquisloscabos.com) you
can experience the only Torah in Baja California, which is
meaningful to Jewish couples.
 One & Only Palmilla: This resort (www.oneandonly
resorts.com) has a traditional, white-washed Mexican chapel
on the premises where you can hold your wedding ceremony.
(Check out Figure 8-4.)
 Las Ventanas al Paraiso: You can work with a dedicated
Director of Romance here (www.lasventanas.com), who can
customize every aspect of the wedding.
Figure 8-4: A traditional Mexican chapel at One & Only Palmilla.

Other Pacific coast cities worth considering for their settings 
and breadth of hotels and wedding facilities are Puerto Vallarta
(www.visitpuertovallarta.com) where cobblestone streets and
the broad malecon invite post-wedding processions, and Ixtapa-
Zihuatanejo (www.ixtapa-zihuatanejo.com), which lures visitors.
You can research this topic more in depth in Mexico’s Beach
Resorts For Dummies by Lynne Bairstow and David Baird (Wiley).
Hitting the Rain Forest
Do you and your other half have a true affinity for the environment
and want to visit places where few tourists have visited? Do you
enjoy being outdoors trekking off the beaten path, encountering
wildlife in their natural environment, and getting to know residents
in a capacity other than as people hired to serve you? Then lush
Central America may fulfill your desires.
Tourism has become increasingly important to the following
peaceful Central American countries, yet they haven’t become
overdeveloped. You can still find bargain accommodations and
pristine natural beauty.
Diving into Belize
On the Caribbean Sea between Mexico to the north and Guatemala
below, English-speaking Belize (www.travelbelize.org) boasts
the largest barrier reef in the Western Hemisphere. It also has
abundant wildlife, Mayan temples, miles of unspoiled coastline,
and a jungle filled with chattering toucans.
Belize weddings can take place on an island, in the rainforest, and
at resorts, where packages include rooms, license, minister, cake,
and flowers. At Belizean receptions, tacos made with roasted pig
add a local delicacy. Fish lovers can feast on freshly caught shrimp,
lobster, and snapper. Belize, which requires a three-day residency,
makes it relatively easy to get married in the country. You can find
wedding requirements online at belize.usembassy.gov/getting_
married_in_belize.html.
If you envision a large, grand-scale destination wedding complete
with a gushing fountains of chocolate and a 30-piece orchestra,
Belize isn’t right for you. Because this country doesn’t have any
major hotel chains and accommodations max out at about 50
rooms, Belize appeals to couples who want an intimate, modest,
and casual getaway. Most lodgings are very affordable, with rates
that seem from an earlier time. One thing you don’t want to forego
is air conditioning, though; it’s a jungle out there.
Chapter 8: Heading to the Tropics and Islands 141

Accommodations options include the following. Contact the hotels
directly for help planning a wedding.
 Five Sisters Lodge: As part of its wedding package, Five
Sisters Lodge (www.fivesisterslodge.com) accompanies a
couple’s first kiss with a release of iridescent blue morpho
butterflies.
 Kanantik Reef and Jungle Resort: This resort (www.kanantik.
com) has a 7-night/8-day wedding-and-honeymoon package fea-
turing roundtrip flights from Belize City to Kanantik’s private
airstrip, meals, three tours, room service, a candlelight dinner
on the beach, plus marriage license, officiant, bridal bouquet,
photographer, videographer, wedding cake, and a chilled
bottle of champagne for $2,465.
 Placencia Hotel: At the (relatively) high end of the spectrum,
Placencia Hotel (www.theplacencia.com) features beachfront
villas and an on-site wedding chapel.
Choosing Costa Rica
The opportunity to get really close to nature on kayaks, whitewater
rafts, surfboards, canopy tours, and horseback attracts active 
couples to Costa Rica (www.visitcostarica.com). Biologically
diverse, this country’s varied terrain includes ocean and jungle,
hot springs, waterfalls, and lagoons. Although much of Costa Rica
is hot year-round, highland locations can be cool and comfortable.
To tie the knot anywhere in Costa Rica, you need to involve a local
lawyer. Some attorneys insist on a document that attests both of
you’re single, which must be translated into Spanish. Papers have
to be in order at least a month before the wedding. Find complete
details and a lawyer to assist you at usembassy.or.cr/consfaq.
html#marriage.
Hotels provide the settings for most weddings, and they’re your
best resources for wedding planning services. I recommend these:
 Four Seasons Costa Rica at Peninsula Papagayo: At the coun-
try’s top hotel (www.fourseasons.com/costarica), couples
can marry aboard a catamaran, just one wedding option.
 Los Altos de Eros: Staff at this intimate boutique hotel
(www.losaltosdeeros.com) with only five guestrooms, per-
sonally arrange all aspects of a destination wedding.
Part II: Picking a Destination for Your Wedding 
142

 Paradisus Playa Conchal: This family-friendly luxury resort
(www.paradisusplayaconchal.travel) has banquet rooms
that can hold wedding parties that range in size from 50 to 400.
You can also find plenty of unique places to say “I do,” including
the following:
 Arenal Volcano: Couples with fiery temperaments may want
to consider a wedding at the edge of this volcano. Costa Rica
Weddings in Paradise (www.costarica-weddings.com/
volcano-weddings.htm) can assist with planning, secure 
the site, and provide legal assistance.
 La Paz Waterfall Gardens: A magical site (www.waterfall
gardens.com) equipped with viewing platforms and estab-
lished trails. Both stateside and on-site coordinators are 
available.
Opting for an Oceania Paradise
Secluded and remote, the island nations of the Pacific Ocean appeal
to couples with a strong desire to marry in an exotic place as close
to paradise and as far away from civilization as anywhere on earth.
Romantic over-water bungalows built just for two, pristine beaches
without another soul or structure in sight, and ancient cultures that
invite you to share their traditions are all part of the appeal of
having a destination wedding in this part of the world.
Getting to these islands involves considerable flying time. Direct
flights from Los Angeles to Papeete’s Faa’a Airport in French
Polynesia, serviced by Air New Zealand, Air France, and Air Tahiti
Nui, take about 7 1/2 hours. From New York’s JFK Airport, Air Tahiti
Nui flies to Papeete in 13 hours. Flights to Fiji, the Cook Islands,
and the Maldives are even lengthier and may involve additional
short flights to reach even more distant spots.
Chapter 8: Heading to the Tropics and Islands 143
Marriage, Fijian style
At a Fijian wedding, the bride can make her entrance on a bilibili, a bamboo raft that
glides under palm trees, escorted to the altar beside the sea by a fully costumed
warrior. After the vows, a choir serenades the couple and is followed by a group of
ceremonial meke dancers decked in garlands of flowers. Then you take part in the
lovo feast, featuring meat roasted underground, and finally a sacred kava ceremony,
where the community honors the couple.

Journeying to Fiji
Consisting of more than 330 small islands in the South Pacific, Fiji
is a remote destination where the food, customs, and even the
architecture are unfamiliar. Colorful wedding customs, good-
natured residents who treat visitors with kindness, and places of
spectacular beauty and privacy inspire couples to marry at either
a traditional white wedding or one that integrates local rituals.
A range of accommodations, from moderately priced hotels with
wedding packages to private-island resorts, is listed at www.
bulafiji.com/index.cfm?go=main.wedding. Lodgings in Fiji
often consists of traditional bures, thatched-roof huts that have
been updated with modern conveniences.
Marrying in Fiji is easy. (See the requirements at travel.state.
gov/law/citizenship/citizenship_771.html.) You don’t have
a waiting period or minimum stay. Do note, though, that Fiji doesn’t
have any nondenominational ministers.

Keeping the law on your side: Tropical
marriage requirements
Every region has its own set of regulations to issue a marriage license, and they do
change from time to time. Regardless of the specifics of a destination, each loca-
tion typically requires you to produce the following:
 Your passports
 Official birth certificates
 Proof of divorce or death certificate if this isn’t a first marriage
 Parents’ written consent for underage couples (the definition of underage varies
by country)
 Registration fee
In most locales, you’re expected to show up in person together to apply for the
license, and you may have a waiting period before it is issued. In some cases, you
may need to pay to have documents translated into an island’s official language or
take a blood test that checks for HIV or venereal disease.
To find current official island requirements, use the link or phone number provided
for each location in this chapter.

Picking Polynesia
The two best-known destinations in Polynesia are the Cook Islands,
which belong to New Zealand, and Tahiti, a French territory.
Surrounded by pristine waters, both spots are ideal for couples
who want a wedding event that includes extraordinary water
sports — from underwater spear fishing to paddling outrigger
canoes to deep-sea diving among some of earth’s most exotic
species in living, breathing, still-growing reefs. Read the following
to find out more about what these islands have to offer:
 The Cook Islands: This location consists of 15 peaceful
islands. Rarotonga, the capital, is encircled by white beaches
fringed by palm trees. A short flight north, the even less popu-
lous Aitutaki Island is sheltered by a vast coral reef teeming
with marine life.
Lovers are welcomed on these islands, and you’ll have few
impediments to marriage as long as you apply to the Registrar
of Marriages for your license three days before the wedding.
Visit www.cook-islands.com for further details and lodging
info.
 Tahiti: Gorgeous Tahiti invites you to honeymoon there but
makes it difficult to legally marry. This location has a one-
month residency requirement, impractical for all but residents
and bazillionaire beachcombers. But don’t let that stop you.
You can marry before leaving home and have a symbolic wed-
ding here (see an example in Figure 8-5). To find out more info
about marrying in Tahiti and to check out accommodations,
go to www.tahiti-tourisme.com.
A traditional Polynesian wedding celebration, which can be
arranged by your hotel with advance notice, can take place at
the Tiki Village Theater (www.tikivillage.fr/mariage/en)
on Tahiti’s neighboring island of Moorea. A village chief with
his high priest in attendance conducts the service. Both bride
and groom don leis and crowns of flowers. After the ceremony,
the couple can board a royal canoe and sail toward the sunset,
serenaded into the night by local musicians.
How far from civilization do you want to go? Motu (small islands)
off the larger islands have no roads or restaurants. For complete
seclusion, arrange a motu wedding or a daylong escape with your
hotel.

Wowing and Vowing 
in Europe
In This Chapter
 Choosing whether to tie the knot on the Continent
 Exploring the United Kingdom
 Focusing on France
 Scoping out Spain
 Going to Greece
 Idylling in Italy
 Looking to Eastern Europe
T
he Grand Tour of Europe was long considered to be the proper
initiation into adult society for newlyweds. Those who experi-
enced it returned home with a mark of culture, an appreciation for
the Continent’s fine food and wine, a deeper understanding of art
and architecture, and a broader definition of the good life.
Today’s couples now look to Europe not only as a honeymoon des-
tination but also as the ultimate place to hold a wedding. I devote
the majority of this chapter to Western Europe’s most popular
countries for weddings abroad — the United Kingdom, France,
Spain, Greece, and Italy — and also recommend two of Eastern
Europe’s hottest spots to marry in.
Considering a European Wedding:
The Pros and Cons
Europe, where wedding traditions have evolved over centuries, is
the number-one destination choice of sophisticated couples. For

generations, couples in love have pledged their vows everywhere
from the Continent’s ancient town halls to its enchanting castles to
holy places such as the Vatican.
If you don’t mind traveling far from home, appreciate foreign cul-
tures, and can afford Europe, no place else on earth is as enchant-
ing. But before you pull out your passports (information on
obtaining them is in Chapter 11), consider the pros and cons of
marrying in Europe.
Pondering the pluses
Couples can find unique advantages to marrying in Europe.
Regardless of the country you choose, the following distinguish a
destination wedding in Europe:
 Culture: From the Louvre in Paris to the West End theaters of
London, from La Scala Opera House in Milan to the bold Gaudí
structures of Barcelona, Europe is considered the apogee of
culture. Its magnificent art, architecture, music, and theater
represent the highest accomplishments of civilization.
 Cuisine: French and Italian chefs are the undisputed leaders
in world cuisine, and you can sample their mastery on native
soil. You also have the gustatory delight of complementing
fine European cuisine at your reception and other wedding
events with equally refined European wines.
 History: Ancient castles, cityscapes dominated by age-old
stone churches, lush vineyards, mature gardens, vast fields of
lavender and heather, and cliffs overlooking the timeless sea
provide inspiring settings to begin celebrating a future
together.
 Romance: The most romantic figures in history — Romeo and
Juliet, King Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, Abelard and Heloise —
didn’t hail from Ohio. They came from Europe, where the land
is infused with a drama and beauty that inspire eternal love.
 Tradition: Thousands of years of European history have
forged customs that today’s couples can borrow to add mean-
ing to their own ceremony. In some small villages in France,
children stretch white ribbons across the bride’s path, which
she must clip to reach her intended. In Italy, newlyweds lead a
procession to the town plaza accompanied by friends, family,
and local well-wishers. And following a Greek ceremony, the
best man places gold crowns or orange-blossom wreaths
linked by a silk ribbon on the bride’s and groom’s heads, iden-
tifying them as the king and queen of the day.

Considering the cons
The best approach to a wedding away is with eyes wide open. By
understanding the obstacles that may present themselves, you
may either decide to marry elsewhere or make adjustments in your
plans to accommodate differences.
 Strict marriage requirements: At the end of each country in
this chapter is a link to its specific marriage requirements.
Several require a lengthy residency period before issuing a
license, making it simpler to have your legal wedding at home
and a symbolic one in Europe.
 Language differences: In countries outside the United
Kingdom, English isn’t the first language. Although many
people in big cities speak English, not all do. A local planner
who speaks English can help you search for appropriate
venues and vendors and communicate your wishes; an inter-
preter can help couples who are planning on their own.
To obtain a local planner in Europe, contact the country or
city tourism office to ask for a recommendation, or ask a local
planner where you live for a referral, search online, or ask a
facility or vendor in the destination.
 Difficulties with documents: Even in countries where non-
citizens can marry, the process of securing (and, in non-
English-speaking countries, translating) required documents
can be lengthy.
 August vacation: Europeans have more vacation time than
Americans do. Every August, people take the month off. This
lengthy break comes at the same time when tourism soars. So
don’t count on top service and attention this month.
 Weather: Recent summers have seen alarming heat waves,
and winters can be cold and miserable. But balladeers sing of
“April in Paris” for a reason (check out the section on Paris
later in this chapter for more info).
 Cost: Western European countries have a high standard of
living, and prices for everything from food to flowers in some
locales are steeper than at home. Prices also vary daily,
depending on the current exchange rate. Add to that the cost
of travel, and a European wedding can be pricey. You can find
out more about dealing with overseas currency in Chapter 4.
Not every European wedding costs a fortune. Couples marry
inexpensively in historic town halls across the Continent,
many with magnificent architecture. If this is what you want,
advance reservations usually are needed.
Chapter 9: Wowing and Vowing in Europe 149

 Distance: Considering the flying time involved from North
America to Europe, a weekend wedding is impractical (the jet
lag alone could have guests nodding out just when you’re
ready to say your vows). But if your party consists of the two
of you alone, Europe is a spectacular place to combine a 
wedding and honeymoon.
Jumping the Pond to the U.K.
In England, Scotland, and Ireland, the locals’ accents are charming,
and they’re speaking your language. That’s the good news. The bad
news: The average wedding in urban areas costs as much or more
than an average one this side of the Atlantic. However, Ireland and
Scotland remain more affordable than England.
Online resources for couples who hope to marry in Great Britain are
plentiful. The www.weddingplanner.co.uk site lets you search for
planners and vendors by major city or the county in England and
Scotland in which they operate. Another site, www.confetti.co.uk,
helps couples find wedding venues and other necessities in those
countries. You can use www.irishweddingsonline.com to access
locations and helpers in Ireland. This section breaks down the
United Kingdom to provide info on having a destination wedding in
England, Ireland, or Scotland.
England
England (www.visitbritain.com) offers couples a vast choice of
wedding locations that include cosmopolitan London, the scenic
Cotswolds, ancient Canterbury, prehistoric Stonehenge, the Roman
town of Bath, the Victorian Keswick in the Lake District,
Shakespeare’s Stratford-upon-Avon, the Beatles’ Liverpool, and the
world-renowned university towns of Cambridge and Oxford.
Within these places are a myriad of potential sites to hold a wed-
ding: parks, gardens, museums, hotels, restaurants, pubs, country
inns, private homes, and even castles. In England, only licensed
venues can hold weddings, and they run the gamut from traditional
to unusual. As with any destination you aren’t familiar with, I
advise you to hire a local planner who can present a suitable
choice of venues and also secure necessary permissions.
The following highlight a few English locations you may want to
consider:
Part II: Picking a Destination for Your Wedding 
150

 London (www.visitlondon.com), England’s sophisticated
capital, is also one of the world’s most expensive cities. So
planning an affordable wedding here and also choosing among
the city’s many hotels is a wallet-stretching challenge. Find
help at www.visitlondon.com/city_guide/weddings/
planning.html. Nontraditional venues registered to hold 
weddings include the following:
• London Eye’s capsule (www.londoneye.com), 440 
feet over the city, is specially decorated and offers a
champagne toast.
• The Chelsea Town Hall (www.rbkc.gov.uk/venues
chelsea/general), located on King’s Road, is a 
charming setting for civil weddings.
• Madame Tussauds (www.madame-tussauds.co.uk), the
original wax museum, can provide the setting for melting
moments.
• London Zoo (www.zsl.org/zsl-london-zoo) opens its
doors for private events, although it doesn’t cost
peanuts.
• Ironmongers’ Hall (www.ironhall.co.uk) is a historic
guild with a hall for hire.
• Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre (www.shakespeares-
globe.org) rents space and can also provide catering
and entertainment.
 Bath (http://visitbath.co.uk/lovebath) is a World
Heritage site and one of Britain’s most romantic cities, thanks
to its Georgian architecture, hot springs, rolling hills, and inti-
mate scale. More than half the weddings that take place here
are for nonresidents. Country houses, hotels, the Pump Room
(cited in Jane Austen novels), and the famous Roman Baths
are among the town’s 30 venues that hold wedding licenses.
 Cotswolds (www.the-cotswolds.org) is England’s prettiest
countryside, featuring classic gardens resplendent with roses,
welcoming pubs, and historic houses and cottages. Stonehouse
Court Hotel (http://stonehousecourt.co.uk) is a 17th-
century manor with an outdoor license to host weddings of 10
to 150 people. It also has 36 bedrooms for overnight guests.
If you’re considering getting married in England, make sure you’re
aware of the banns. Required by the Church of England, the banns
refers to the public announcement of an intended marriage three
weeks before the wedding. Similar notice must be displayed in a reg-
ister office 15 days prior to civil marriages in England and Wales. Legal
marriages in England also require a week of residency. You can find
full requirements at www.gro.gov.uk/gro/content/marriages.
Chapter 9: Wowing and Vowing in Europe 151

Ireland
Green and welcoming Ireland (www.discoverireland.com)
appeals to couples with a love of the outdoors and a taste for fine
spirits. Its many castles and gardens, the mystical fog that
envelops the land, and the magical incantations of home-grown
crooner Van Morrison all contribute to the beauty and romance of
the Emerald Isle. Outdoor enthusiasts choose Ireland for its abun-
dance of destination wedding activities, including golf, fishing,
hiking, and horseback riding. History lovers want to spend time
exploring Ireland’s castles and ancient monuments, perhaps
searching for their own Irish roots.
Ireland’s major cities — Dublin, Galway, and Belfast — continually
refresh themselves, adding to or upgrading their many hotels that
provide shelter and sustenance to wedding parties. Tops in each:
 Shelbourne in Dublin: Landmark 182-year-old city-center hotel
(marriott.co.uk/Channels/hotels-uk/hotels/travel/
dubbr-the-shelbourne) with a grand ballroom (holds 360)
and smaller suites for intimate weddings.
 g hotel in Galway: Chic and au courant, the g (www.the
ghotel.ie) has six event suites and can accommodate 
parties of up to 100.
 Ten Square in Belfast: Boutique hotel (www.tensquare.
co.uk) with opulent event space.

Irish traditions for lovers
The Irish definitely have an affinity for traditional symbols of love. If you’re planning
on an Irish wedding, you may want to add some authentic romance to your visit.
The following are a few examples of Irish culture:
 Ireland’s iconic claddagh ring — consisting of two hands holding a single 
heart — can be a lifelong reminder of an Emerald Isle wedding. Used as a 
marriage ring or given in friendship, it makes a unique wedding-party gift.
 Engraved Celtic rings feature an endless spiral, the symbol of an enduring 
marriage.
 Stop kissing one another long enough to plant one on the Blarney Stone in
County Cork, said to confer the gift of eloquence.

Working with a local planner, couples can save on a site by arrang-
ing to have a wedding outdoors or away from a major city. Check
out the following options:
 Belle Isle: This site (www.belleisle-estate.com) is a work-
ing farm in Northern Ireland that also happens to include a
castle that hosts civil weddings. Its lodgings range from a
coach house to private cottages.
 Castle Oaks House Hotel: On Limerick’s River Shannon banks,
this hotel (www.castleoaks.ie) has 25 years’ experience
hosting weddings.
 St. Stephens Green: Dublin’s 27-acre St. Stephens Green is
popular with wedding parties and provides beautiful back-
drops of flowers and water fountains.
Irish weddings require three months’ notice of the intended 
event. Complete details are at www.groireland.ie/getting_
married.htm.
Scotland
Today one out of four couples who marry in Scotland (www.visit
scotland.com) are visitors, and many choose the village of Gretna
Green (http://weddings.gretnagreen.co.uk). Couples can still
wed in its Old Blacksmith’s Shop, now a tourist attraction (the origi-
nal proprietor doubled as a minister). Some combine it with a
reception at the adjacent Smiths Hotel (www.smithsgretnagreen.
com). Elsewhere in Scotland, couples tie the knot in castles and
churches, on golf courses and country estates, and in hotels in 
the Highlands and the two major cities, Edinburgh and Glasgow.
By using the form on the Destination Scotland Web site (at
www.destinationscotland.com/romance/venue.asp), you can
describe your needs and receive recommendations on where to
marry. Scotland’s unique and charming venues include
 Eala Bhan: If you’re not worried about the Loch Ness monster
showing up as an uninvited guest, consider marrying aboard
this wooden sailboat that plies the waters of the Scottish
Highlands and sleeps 12 (www.highlandvoyages.co.uk).
 Glencorse Old Kirk: Couples can marry outside of Edinburgh
in the woodland setting author Robert Louis Stevenson
described as “the finest spot on earth” or in the ancient stone
church where he worshiped (www.glencorsehouse.com).

Romancing at a castle wedding
To feel like royalty on your wedding day, consider marrying in a castle. These fairy-
tale settings promise a “happily-ever-after” event in authentically historic sur-
roundings. Beyond a castle’s turreted structure often lie formal gardens with mature
plantings; large, open lawns; and waterways where swans glide by — all of which
present magnificent backgrounds for wedding photos. Inside you can anticipate a
wealth of antiques, walls covered with tapestries, and beamed ceilings wrought by
hand centuries ago.
Many castles that host weddings today have been restored with modern facilities
added. Although they aren’t cheap to rent, you can still spend less on a small wed-
ding in a castle than a large one at home. Following is a sampling of European cas-
tles that proffer the keys to the kingdom . . . if only for a day or a weekend.
English castles
 Amberley (www.amberleycastle.co.uk) has stood in the English 
countryside for nine centuries.
 Leeds (www.leeds-castle.com) is located on an island accessible by car. It
has 20 bedrooms for guests, its own florist, a wine cellar, and hot-air balloon flights.
 Swinton Park (www.swintonpark.com), which dates from the 1600s, is oper-
ated as a 30-bedroom hotel and has won numerous hospitality awards. Swinton
Park is the ancestral home of the Earl of Swinton and is a licensed wedding
venue surrounded by a 200-acre estate (see the following photo).
Irish castles
 Ashford (www.ashford.ie/weddings.html) is a 13th-century lakeside
estate outside of Galway.
 Crom Castle (www.cromcastle.com) in Northern Ireland is a good option for
smaller weddings. It can sleep 12 people and fit up to 35 for a ceremony in its
conservatory.

Chapter 9: Wowing and Vowing in Europe 155
 Dromoland (www.dromoland.ie) is a castle hotel outside of Shannon.
 Knappogue (www.shannonheritage.com/Knappogue_Wed.htm) is a
15th-century tower with a medieval-style banquet hall near Shannon.
Scottish castles
 Blair Castle (www.blaircastleweddings.co.uk), dating in part from
1269, is conveniently located close to a railway station. Its indoor sites include
an intimate library, Georgian dining room, and ballroom for 40 to 445 guests.
 Guthrie Castle (www.guthriecastle.com) is located between Edinburgh
and Aberdeen. This circa-1468 castle hosts weddings ranging in size from 2 to
360. Up to 22 guests can overnight here.
 Wedderburn Castle
(www.wedderburn-castle.co.uk) outside of
Edinburgh has 14 bedrooms and can accommodate up to 50 for a reception.
Find an expanded list of Scottish castles, along with information on their lodgings
and features, at www.castles.org/Chatelaine/weddings.htm.
French châteaux
 Château d’Esclimont (www.jpmoser.com/chateau_d_esclimont.
html), built in 1543 and on 150 acres, is close to Versailles and Paris.
 Château Rayssee (www.chateaudordogne.com) in the Dordogne region
features a medieval castle, two swimming pools, seven bedrooms, and 20 acres.
 Château de la Chèvre d’Or (www.chevredor.com) is set high on a promon-
tory in the ancient village of Eze overlooking the Mediterranean. It has 33 bed-
rooms, a heated pool, and a private room for weddings.
Italian castles
 Castello 7 (www.rentvillas.com/PropertyDetail.aspx?Catalog=
3247) outside Florence proves that not all castles are hulking or expensive.
This one sleeps only four and doesn’t have catering facilities, but what you save
on lodging you can apply to an outside reception.
 Odescalchi Castle (www.odescalchi.it/first.htm) was the site of the
Tom Cruise–Katie Holmes wedding seen ’round the world.
 Sicilian Castle (www.5stardestinations.com/sitepages/property
1758.php) from the 15th century stands on the waterfront, has a private
beach, contains nine bedrooms, and is equipped with a chef and a housekeeper.

Include Scottish customs in your wedding: Grooms who want to
look authentic can rent a kilt rather than a tuxedo. For luck, a bride
can tuck a sixpence in her shoe and add a sprig of heather to her
bouquet. And up in Shetland, having a “second night” after the
wedding, dedicated to drinking and dancing, is traditional.
Although a residency period isn’t required for couples who want to
marry in Scotland, prior notice of at least three weeks is needed.

Affirming L’amour in France
You would think that the country that touts itself as the world’s
most romantic would make it easier for couples to marry there.
But no. France (www.francetourism.com) insists outsiders fulfill a
40-day residency requirement to acquire a marriage license. So I
advise having a civil ceremony at home first and bringing your
marriage certificate to France.
Whether you decide simply to have a symbolic wedding or put
down roots in France for more than a month, you can find incred-
ibly romantic places to say “I do.” In fact, more than 20,000 hotels,
inns, and other lodgings in the country, government-rated accord-
ing to five comfort levels, are available. The most romantic ones
offer perks such as champagne breakfast in bed, bouquets of 
flowers, petits fours, limousine rides, and more.
If you’re determined to wed in France, you can find marriage rules
at www.info-france-usa.org/visitingfrance/marriage.asp.
Paris
Chic Paris (www.parisinfo.com) is a magnet for romantics. Views
of the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre; the Arc de Triomphe and Notre-
Dame Cathedral; Paris’ seductive cuisine and street-corner cafés;
splendid architecture; world-renowned theaters, cabarets, and
opera; and the indelible style of Parisians are enough to seduce
any visiting couple to want to marry on the spot. You can’t right
away, but you can set plans in motion.
Paris For Dummies by Cheryl A. Pientka and Joseph Alexiou (Wiley)
can help you sort out the city’s neighborhoods and evaluate its
hotels. Alternative venues include the following:
Part II: Picking a Destination for Your Wedding 
156

 Bateau-mouche: These slender boats (www.bateauxdeparis.
com/paris-wedding.php) ply the River Seine, and several
feature lunch and dinner cruises and dramatic nighttime sails.
 Dali Museum: If the entire notion of getting married seems
surreal, no place in Paris is more apropos than the Dali
Museum (www.daliparis.com), which rents out reception
rooms.
 La Mairie: Civil ceremonies (the only ones recognized by law)
are conducted in town halls, including the stately one in
Paris’s 7th Arrondissement.
Elsewhere in France
France also has plenty of charming and scenic locales for a desti-
nation wedding outside its capital. The country is divided into 22
tourism regions, each with its charms. Highlights include
 Western France: Beaches and gardens, parks and cathedrals,
Loire Valley vineyards and châteaux, and Disneyland Paris all
lure lovers to France’s Atlantic coast.
 Eastern France: At the medieval crossroads of Europe, Alsace,
Burgundy, and Champagne-Ardenne contain storybook villages.
 Southern France: Stretching from the Atlantic down to 
Spain, the region includes Biarritz and Bordeaux, center of
winemaking.
 Provence and the French Riviera: Ancient villages overlook-
ing the Mediterranean and renowned resort towns such as
Nice, Cannes, and St. Tropez draw lovers to the sea. And
Provence’s lavender-scented fields, cuisine, and Roman ruins
bring out the romantic in everyone.
A local planner is necessary to effect wedding arrangements, and
you can locate one through www.weddingsinfrance.com. Venues
throughout France include hotels and historic monuments, chapels
and nightclubs, private homes, and rented yachts.
Saying “I Do” in Spain
Similar to France (see preceding section), weddings in Spain
(www.spain.info) require at least a month in residence, making it
a logical destination for a symbolic ceremony. Both religious and
Chapter 9: Wowing and Vowing in Europe 157

nonreligious ones can be held in a multitude of venues, unlike legal
ceremonies that have specific rules about locations. You can find
information on requirements to marry in Spain at travel.state.
gov/law/citizenship/citizenship_763.html.
Growing ever more fashionable as a vacation destination, Spain’s
sophisticated cities and scenic regions provide distinctive loca-
tions for weddings. The country’s wealth of castles and historic
buildings, beaches and gardens, as well as haciendas and luxury
hotels can all serve as settings for destination wedding parties.
Because I don’t have room to cover every city, here are a few of my
favorites:
 Barcelona: Artistic and sophisticated Barcelona (www.
barcelonaturisme.com), home of Gaudí’s architectural 
masterpieces, is also a major Mediterranean port. As Spain’s
most cosmopolitan urban center, its local wedding planners
have access to churches with English-speaking priests, plus
photographers and other vendors who understand the 
language.
 Marbella: On Spain’s Costa del Sol, Marbella (www.andalucia.
com/marbella) wedding venues range from castles in the
foothills of the Sierra Nevada to seaside hotels and private
homes, golf courses, and the beach itself.
 Seville: Charming and historic Seville (www.exploreseville.
com), scented with orange blossoms, was the home of the
immortal lover Don Juan. In nearby Granada, couples can
marry in the Alhambra Palace’s tiny chapel.
Paradores are one-of-a-kind, government-sanctioned inns where
couples can hold a ceremony and reception and also lodge guests
overnight. They include converted monasteries, former palaces,
and other upgraded historic places. Some feature pools and spas,
and serving regional food and wine to company is a matter of
pride. For more info on paradores or to locate one in a specific
region, go to www.parador.es/english.
Becoming a Couple in Greece
The movie My Big Fat Greek Wedding was set in Chicago, but the
joyous spirit of celebration it portrayed originated in sun-bleached
Greece (www.gnto.gr). This island nation’s warm climate, rain-free
days, sea breezes, relaxed atmosphere, tasty cuisine, and long 
Part II: Picking a Destination for Your Wedding 
158

history — plus the ease in which marriages can legally take place
(there’s no residency requirement) — make it one of Europe’s
premier places for destination weddings.
To find a wedding planner in Greece, contact the tourism bureau 
or ask for a recommendation at a hotel that you might consider
getting married in. To find out what the marriage license require-
ments are in Greece, go to www.usembassy.gr/us_citizen/
ac_marriage.htm.
Athens
Ancient and modern life exist side by side in Athens, regarded as
the birthplace of civilization. Its skyline is dominated by the rocky
Acropolis plateau crowned by the Parthenon, sacred temple of the
goddess Athena. Historic districts, vibrant street life, cafés, and
tavernas that stay open till the wee hours all add to wedding fun.
Hotel options include:
 Athens Atrium Hotel: This traditional hotel (www.athens
atrium.gr) has a ballroom that holds 200 guests.
 Economy Hotel: Aptly named, this modest hotel (www.economy
hotel.gr) is well-regarded for its staff and affordability.
 Fresh Hotel: This hip hostelry (www.freshhotel.gr) has an
outdoor rooftop lounge with a view of the Acropolis and
reception rooms that can hold 40 to 140 people.
The Cyclades
This group of 56 islands — the most notable of which are Andros,
Mykonos, Naxos, and Santorini — lies in the Aegean Sea south of
Athens. Groves of olive trees, a blazing sun that sparkles off aqua
waters, and exquisite sunsets behind whitewashed limestone
buildings are the quintessential picture of Greece.
Santorini (www.santonet.gr), which stands on the rim of a vol-
cano with the sea 1,000 feet below, is one of the world’s most beau-
tiful islands on which to wed (see Figure 9-1). Venues range from
the Byzantine Chapel of Saint Irene to private hotel terraces and
decks of vintage sailing ships, spectacular settings for sunset cere-
monies. All are in high demand, so reserve a spot well in advance.
Chapter 9: Wowing and Vowing in Europe 159

Figure 9-1: Wedding on a Santorini terrace overlooking the Aegean Sea.
Sporades
This archipelago consists of 700 islands north of Athens. Skiathos
(www.skiathos.gr/html/tourismos/en/index.html), with
more than 60 beaches, lures sun-and-sea lovers. Thanks to its pop-
ularity, it has many hotels and their prices are competitive.
Magic Hotel (www.magic-hotel.com) offers couples the option of
using its wedding consultant or simply providing vendor recom-
mendations. Another perk of having a destination wedding in
Skiathos: Every major beach has a watersports center, a launching
point for water-skiing, jetskiing, windsurfing, and parasailing
adventures. Wedding parties who rent a boat for a day can sail to
an uninhabited island, drop anchor, and swim to a secluded beach.
Singing “That’s Amore” in Italy
Revel together in the romance of Italy (www.italiantourism.com) —
the food, the wine, the art — in world-renowned cities such as
Rome, Florence, and Venice as well as dazzling coastal communities
along the Mediterranean and villages that stretch up to the Alps.
Couples who hope to wed here need to know that Italy can get very
crowded during the peak summer season and is fairly expensive.
Nonetheless, you’d be hard pressed to find lovelier settings to
marry in from the tip of “the boot” to the northern Lake District.

Many town halls in Italy date back centuries, are ornately deco-
rated, and provide exquisite settings for civil weddings. Other
options include hotels, private villas (see Figure 9-2), farmhouses,
castles, or even the Holy See. There is no residency requirement to

Applying for a Vatican wedding
For Roman Catholic couples, getting married in St. Peter’s Basilica is a high honor and
blessing reserved for the truly religious. The process must begin with the couple
meeting with their own parish priest, who informs them of requirements they must
satisfy. Home of the American Catholic Church in Rome, the Church of Santa Susanna
(www.santasusanna.org/weddingsRome/stPeters.html) conducts wed-
dings in English and is also the source for information on Vatican weddings.

 Hotel Luna Convento: The private chapel of Hotel Luna
Convento (www.lunahotel.it), a former 12th-century
monastery on the Amalfi coast, echoes with timeless love.
 Grand Hotel Gardone Riviera: Beside Lake Garda in northern
Italy, Grand Hotel Gardone Riviera (www.grangardone.it)
has a lakeside promenade above its private beach.
 Palazzo Cavalli: Serenaded by an operatic gondolier, couples
can sail to Palazzo Cavalli on the Grand Canal, the most
famous wedding hall in Italy and property of the city of Venice.
 Red Hall: Opulent is the only way to describe Red Hall in the
13th-century Palazzo Vecchio of Florence; this location was
once a Medici residence but is now used for civil weddings.
 Verona: From around the world, couples flock to Verona to
marry in Guarienti Hall near the tomb of Juliet, Shakespeare’s
most tragic heroine.
Work with a local wedding planner to marry in any of these sites;

Eyeing the Eastern Options
More affordable than their neighbors to the west, some Eastern
European countries have become smart destinations for couples
on the cutting edge. Several better hotel groups have opened prop-
erties in major cities throughout this part of Europe. However, in
smaller towns, the lack of English-speaking wedding vendors can
be an obstacle to those who don’t know the local language. Two of
the most popular locations include
 Czech Republic: Lively and charming Prague, spa towns that
date from the 15th century, and 2,000-plus castles across the
country are attracting couples to situate their destination wed-
ding in the Czech Republic (www.czechtourism.com). Fifty of
those castles have been converted to hotels, so brides and
grooms can house guests as well as have a ceremony conducted
in those magical spots. You can find the requirements for marry-
ing in the Czech Republic at prague.usembassy.gov/getting_
married_in_the_czech_republic.html.
 Croatia: The long coastline of Croatia (www.croatia.hr)
faces the Adriatic Sea, making it appealing to those who want
to wed in a sunny Mediterranean climate. Visitors liken it to
Greece, Tuscany, even the French Riviera — but without big
crowds and steep costs. (To find information on marrying in
Croatia, go to www.usembassy.hr/acs/marriage.htm.)

 Hosting shipboard and portside weddings
 Obeying marriage laws where you sail
 Celebrating your honeymoon on the water
P
icture yourself and your honey exchanging rings on a cruise
ship deck as your closest friends and family stand nearby. The
breeze blows in your hair, and you smell the saltwater. What could
be more romantic?
Getting married at sea is one of the simplest ways to have an
affordable destination wedding. This fact alone may convince you
to get on board: The average cost of a shipboard wedding with a
two-hour reception for 100 guests on a premium cruise line is
$7,000. The average cost of a land-based hometown wedding for
the same number of guests is close to $27,000.
In addition to being cost-effective, a shipboard wedding allows cou-
ples to combine their ceremony and reception with a cruise honey-
moon. (In fact, a bridal couple must sail if they want a cruise-hosted
wedding.) Are you tempted to board a cruise ship for your wed-
ding? If so, this chapter reveals what you need to know.
Sailing into Matrimony: The
Benefits of a Cruise Wedding
Cruise weddings range in size from intimate ceremonies with bride,
groom, officiant, and witnesses to parties of, well, titanic proportions.

In addition to the affordability of cruise ship weddings, this type of
destination wedding also offers marrying couples the following:
 Extensive amenities. On the newest ships, amenities are
equal to those of fine resorts: spas that pamper, swimming
pools, and even concierge and butler service. In ports of call,
you can participate in land and water sports, tackle an
extreme adventure, tour historical and cultural points of inter-
est, and shop for duty-free goods.
On sea days, ships offer activities to engage people of all ages —
unless you prefer to simply gaze at the ocean from deck chairs,
holding hands as you watch the world go by. At night, you can
sip cocktails on the deck under moonlit skies, dance to live
music, see a Broadway-style show, and try your luck in a casino.
And with satellite telephone service and 24-hour Internet
access, a couple can stay connected with friends and family at
home — or cut loose completely.
 Extraordinary value. All-inclusive pricing covers meals (but
not liquor or soft drinks), accommodations, and entertain-
ment so a couple knows in advance what a trip will cost
(although shore excursions, specialty restaurants, spa treat-
ments — and the wedding itself — add to the bottom line).
 Professional help from an experienced cruise wedding coor-
dinator at no charge. And because cruises are already staffed
with expert florists, chefs, bakers, photographers, and musi-
cians, you have access to the help you need to produce an
event that meets your specifications at a party that lasts for
four days (or longer!), rather than four hours.
Booking and Coordinating 
a Cruise Wedding
Does a cruise wedding sound right for you? If so, you need to first
find out whether the cruise ship has the number of cabins avail-
able that your party requires (work with a travel agent on this),
then book your event, calling upon the ship’s wedding coordinator.
Even if you desire the most basic ceremony and supply your own
officiant and a bouquet of silk flowers, you still need to go through
the coordinator, who is responsible for scheduling all onboard pas-
senger weddings. This section helps you determine some of the
details, such as who to invite, how much you can expect to spend,
how to coordinate and customize your cruise ship destination
wedding, and how to book your cruise.

Chapter 10: Cruising on a Love Boat 165
Setting sail with friends and family
One of the biggest considerations a couple must make when decid-
ing whether to have a cruise wedding is how much to include guests
in the celebration. Many brides and grooms fear that they will have
little alone time when Aunt Patty is knocking on their door every 30
minutes to make sure they save a seat for her at bingo. However,
other couples find the idea of spending the entire cruise with the
people they love the most ideal honeymoon vacation. Before book-
ing your cruise wedding, you must decide what’s preferable to you.
Couples have three options when deciding how to include family
and friends in their destination wedding at sea:
 Let them board as nonsailing guests for the ceremony. To
accomplish this, you hold the wedding aboard the ship either
when it’s in the embarkation port or in another port where the
majority of guests can join you. A wedding like this is similar
to a traditional wedding in that it lasts only a few hours — but
it takes place on a ship. (No stowaways allowed!)
 Welcome your guests to join the festivities in port. Here
again, you need to choose a port convenient to most guests
and then book a nearby site such as a hotel or restaurant for
them to come celebrate with you. There’s more coordination
required for an affair like this because it may call for trans-
portation from the ship to the venue. Outside catering and
decoration decisions can add to the bottom line as well.
 Invite them to cruise along with you. When you ask guests to
sail with you, you can stage the ceremony at any point during
the journey, and in any port as well. You also can plan it as a
trip that turns into a family reunion and multigenerational vaca-
tion, providing quality time with guests. You can share meals,
go sightseeing as a group, and sit by the pool or in a hot tub
together. Some ships provide a private meeting room during
the cruise for you to gather in, or you can schedule a private
cocktail party and perhaps even get the captain to pop in.
The choice is up to you. Just remember that at sea as on land,
you’re not responsible for picking up the tab for the cruise portion
of the trip for wedding guests who want to sail along with you. And
you may engender some hurt feelings if you invite some people to
come along, but not others.
Cruise ship wedding packages
Cruise wedding prices start at around $1,000 for the most basic
package. The cost typically includes the ceremony on the ship with

an officiant, bride’s bouquet and groom’s boutonnière, champagne, a
small wedding cake, and the services of a photographer. Carnival’s
package, which starts at $750, is the cheapest among major cruise
lines that sail from the United States. For most couples, though, the
basic package is just the starting point.
Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines recently introduced its Explorer
Weddings program, which enables couples to marry in uncommon
settings beyond the chapel. New onboard venues include the ship’s
surf simulator, its miniature golf course, and even the ice-skating
rink. Explorer Weddings coordinators also can organize weddings in
port, with experiences that range from saying vows undersea to
tying the knot atop an Alaskan glacier.
The top cruise lines in Table 10-1 all host weddings. Prices reflect
the minimum for a basic ceremony only; license and registration
fees and reception costs are extra.

Finalizing the details
Cruise ship vacations are becoming more and more popular, so
booking in advance is very important. If you have a particular ship
and sailing date in mind, don’t delay. At minimum, start planning
three months ahead of time; many experienced cruising couples
actually book their next cruise a year or more in advance.
Travel arrangements for a cruise wedding can be complex, involv-
ing flights and overnight hotel stays on either end of the voyage itself
if you don’t leave from and return to a port within driving distance
of where you and your guests live. So I suggest you turn to a travel
agent to make your reservations. See Chapter 11 for how travel
agents can help plan your wedding.
Before you contact an agent and book a cruise wedding, ask your-
selves these questions. Doing so can make it easier for the agent to
tailor recommendations based on your needs.
Part II: Picking a Destination for Your Wedding 
168
Will it float? Try before you buy
Two cruise lines, Celebrity and Royal Caribbean, offer a Testing the Waters package
that allows a couple to inspect a ship before committing to having a wedding on it.
For under $200 (more if extra people tag along), you can get a tour of the pier, port,
and ship led by a wedding coordinator, view potential reception and ceremony
venues, discuss photography and decorations, and have a buffet lunch in the ship’s
café.

 Who is sailing with us? Do we expect family and friends to
join us on the cruise? If so, the travel agent may be able to
secure a group discount. You may even get a free cabin for
yourselves if you meet the cruise line’s definition of a group.
 What is our budget? Knowing what you can spend helps iden-
tify the most affordable cruise lines for you. Keep in mind that
the cost of the cruise is separate from that of the wedding.
 Where do we want to sail? Caribbean itineraries are popular
with Easterners and Midwesterners. Cruises to Alaska,
Mexico’s Pacific coast, and within Hawaii are most convenient
for West Coast residents. But that needn’t affect your deci-
sion. If you’ve always dreamed of sailing to Tahiti or through
the Panama Canal, go for it!
 When do we want to sail? Although cruises leave from ports
year-round, summer is prime sailing season, and you have the
widest choice of ships and itineraries at that time of year.
 How long a cruise should we take? Budget is a factor in the
length of any cruise. The more you can spend, the longer you
can sail. Itineraries range from overnight cruises “to nowhere”
to 100-plus days at sea on a round-the-world cruise. Most voy-
ages are in the five- to eleven-day range.
Working with the pros
Cruise weddings are as close to a turnkey affair as a couple can
get, yet a lot of planning still goes into the simplest affairs. Having
a wedding coordinator onboard can make you grateful to have
someone to help guide you through the process.
Look to your coordinator to handle all the wedding details from
booking to bon voyage. The responsibilities that fall to the wed-
ding coordinator include
 Answering your questions
 Informing you of the legal requirements, helping you to get
required documents, and making sure that your ceremony will
be valid in the port you choose
 Reserving a place and time for the ceremony and reception
 Arranging preboarding for you and your guests
 Securing the officiant
 Coordinating with the ship’s florist, baker, photographer, and
other providers who are crew members
 Communicating the catering order
Chapter 10: Cruising on a Love Boat 169

 Making sure your spaces are clean and well lit
 Being available for last-minute changes and emergencies
 Handling transportation to a port location, if required
To get started planning your destination cruise wedding, contact the
cruise line and ask to speak to a wedding coordinator (find phone
numbers for the major cruise lines earlier in this chapter). As with
any wedding vendor, your coordinator should strike you as some-
one you can count on and can call with questions and concerns.
Cruise wedding coordinators only manage the wedding portion of
your trip. Your coordinator can help you figure out what type of
cruise ship wedding package you want to purchase (check out the
next section). You’ll still need to work with a travel agent to book
cabins and such.
Customizing your ship wedding
If you want to personalize aspects of the wedding, give your coor-
dinator (she is your point person throughout) ample time before
you board to produce those elements to your liking. You may be
perfectly happy with what’s included in your onboard wedding
package or you may still want a few extras to enhance your cruise
wedding. I cover some of the options in the following sections.
Ceremony enhancements
Not all ships offer the same elements, but the following are widely
available:
 Decorations: Think a silk canopy or tulle-wrapped archway
adds the perfect touch? Add it to your list.
 Flowers: Love a particular kind of flower or want a special
type of bouquet? Most likely, your wedding coordinator can
help you get what you want.
 Photography: On some ships, basic wedding packages include
the services of the photographer only — and photos themselves
cost extra. Other packages include a limited number of photos.
Choose photo options in advance to avoid being surprised.
 Religious elements: Ships that contain wedding chapels usu-
ally have a podium for the officiant and a table next to it. If
you want an altar to take communion or kneeling benches, or
a chuppah for a Jewish wedding, request this in advance.
Part II: Picking a Destination for Your Wedding 
170

 Tuxedo rental: Ships that have formal nights usually have a
place on board where you can rent a tuxedo, which is more
convenient than having to pack one and return it after the trip.
 Videography and Webcam transmission: Not part of a basic
package, video and Webcam pictures help to share the memo-
ries with those who aren’t with you. (Check out Chapter 17 for
how a Webcam can transmit your ceremony.)
Reception elements
Some couples think that a big, festive reception is the best part of
an onboard wedding, even though it escalates the affair into another
budget bracket. Most basic wedding packages include a small cake
and domestic champagne toast afterwards. The following are a few
reception upgrades you may want to consider:
 Premium cake and Champagne: To make the after-ceremony
even sweeter, trade up to French Champagne and a two-tier cake.
 Catering: You can choose from a buffet table, hors d’oeuvres
and cocktails, or a four-course sit-down dinner. Specialty
restaurants on ships, which are smaller than main dining
rooms, make good reception spots because they can be
closed for your private party.
 Dining-room decorations: Beautify surroundings with flowers
on the tables, a fountain that gushes champagne, garnished and
carved fruit and marzipan, or an ice sculpture with your initials
on it.
 Music and entertainment: CDs are fine, but true music fans
with guests who like to dance appreciate the services of a DJ,
piano or keyboard player, vocalist, or the ship’s own live band.
 Sound and lighting: Music needs to be amplified, and you and
the entertainment deserve to spend time in the spotlight.
If you’re spending a substantial amount on the wedding, don’t be
shy about asking to have a few extra perks included gratis. And get
the price of each component in writing beforehand. You don’t want
the honeymoon ruined by a tariff that takes you by surprise.
Finding Locations on Land and Sea
Although cruise weddings typically take place while the ship is in
port, you need to choose in advance whether to have your wed-
ding onboard the docked ship or at a nearby land location. Whether
your wedding guests join you just for the day or sail along with you
Chapter 10: Cruising on a Love Boat 171

may help you decide whether getting married on the ship or in
port is a better choice. This section looks at your options on where
you can tie the knot on a cruise wedding.
Saying “I do” onboard the ship
Couples who marry onboard have the choice of different areas in
which to hold the ceremony and reception. Depending on the ship,
you may have your ceremony in the wedding chapel, on deck, in a
lounge, library, restaurant, your private suite, or elsewhere.
Weddings are often scheduled between noon and 2 p.m. because
the majority of ships leave port around 5 p.m. The ceremony itself
lasts about half an hour, leaving two hours for a reception.
A ship’s wedding chapel is the obvious choice because it’s dedi-
cated to that purpose and can be decorated according to a couple’s
wishes. (See the section “Customizing your ship wedding,” earlier
in this chapter, for more info).
The newest ships launched by Princess, Royal Caribbean, Norwegian,
and Carnival cruise lines all feature dedicated wedding chapels.
These intimate indoor spaces are usually located on a top deck to
allow sunlight to stream in during the day. (Check out Figure 10-1
for an example.)
Princess Cruises’ Golden Princess and Grand Princess both have a
Webcam in their wedding chapel, making it possible for nonsailing
guests to witness the wedding in real time. Remember: Webcams
don’t record images, so request videography if you want a moving
visual record of the wedding.
Figure 10-1: Royal Caribbean’s Freedom of Seas wedding chapel.

To facilitate embarkation, your cruise wedding coordinator arranges
priority check-in and boarding for you and your guests before the
rest of the passengers. She also makes sure all nonsailing members
of the wedding disembark half an hour prior to departure.
Marrying in port
Today nearly 40 percent of the United States population resides
within a half day’s driving distance of a port. If you and most of your
guests live near Miami, New York, Boston, Baltimore, Charleston,
Galveston, Tampa, San Francisco, Seattle, or New Orleans, where
many ships sail from, a cruise wedding is especially convenient for
friends and family who prefer not to fly.
If you decide to get married in port, you can ask your cruise wed-
ding coordinator to help with the details or put you in touch with a
professional at the location. Can you pull off a port-side ceremony
and reception yourselves? If you’re willing to handle a slew of details
without help from an experienced hand, yes — just remember to get
back on board before the ship sails.
For many cruise lines, the cost of a wedding varies by port and is
based on demand and local economic conditions. Whether most of
your wedding guests are traveling with you — or your wedding
party includes just the two of you — you have a wealth of scenic
and romantic harborside locations to choose from on all seven
continents. Some popular shore destinations include the following:
 Alaska: May through September, outdoor cruise weddings can
take place against magnificent backdrops. With assistance from
the ship’s excursions desk, your coordinator can help to organ-
ize a ceremony for you amidst scenic Tongass National Forest or
another protected wildlife environment; invite guests to a
salmon bake followed by panning for gold; be surrounded (and
perhaps serenaded) by canine athletes at a sled dog and
musher’s camp; or fly to the top of a glacier and pledge your
troth in an icy, pristine wilderness (see Figure 10-2).
 Europe: European ports open up another world of possibilities
for an on-shore ceremony that your wedding coordinator can
help to arrange. Parks and gardens, castles and private estates,
chapels and former monasteries are all potential venues.
(Check out Chapter 9 for more on European destinations.)
Chapter 10: Cruising on a Love Boat 173

Figure 10-2: Royal Caribbean’s 
Explorer Weddings can whisk 
couples off to exotic spots like the
top of a glacier for a ceremony 
while in port. 
 The Caribbean: Many cruise ships call at Caribbean ports,
where wedding locations in those countries range from wide
public beaches to hotel terraces that overlook the sea, to 
private suites and big ballrooms. One resort, Half Moon (www.
halfmoon.com) in Jamaica, now offers cruising couples who
sail into Montego Bay a quickie one-day wedding package
complete with roundtrip transportation to the pier. (For more
info, see Chapter 8.)
 New Orleans: The port was closed following Hurricane Katrina
and recently reopened. Now it’s the least-expensive port to
marry in, remains popular with Southerners, and passengers
can enjoy the city’s famed cuisine before and after sailing.
Although weddings in port have their good points, you may want
to consider how such weddings differ from onboard ones (other
than the location):
 Cost: Shore weddings are more expensive than shipboard
ones because transportation to the venue must be factored in
and you also may have to pay to rent a venue. Some ports are
barren, industrial places, so if you’re planning a wedding on
shore, you may need a space elsewhere.
 Time: Any minutes spent getting to and from a location
shorten the amount of time for the ceremony and reception.

Vowing to Be Legal Onboard
After a ship enters the waters of a sovereign territory, any wed-
dings conducted onboard or in port must conform to the laws of
that territory in order for the marriage to be legally recognized.
That includes obtaining a license from that location, having the
Chapter 10: Cruising on a Love Boat 175
Getting hitched on a private island
Several cruise lines that regularly sail Caribbean itineraries — including Holland
America, Royal Caribbean, NCL, and Disney — have their own private island that
only their ships call at. These private-island locations provide good settings for
casual, toes-in-the-sand weddings, the sun high above and a steel band drumming
in the background.
Holland America’s unspoiled Half Moon Cay has a beautiful, white-washed wed-
ding chapel on the island as well as a trolley that can help to transport less-mobile
guests to the location (see the following photo). This traditional Bahamanian chapel
stands in a garden overlooking the sea. Guests often wear tropical attire, and cham-
pagne and cake are served following the ceremony.
Only ship passengers have access to ships’ private islands, which makes this option
best for couples who are traveling with their entire wedding party.

ceremony conducted by a person authorized to sanction a marriage
in that territory, and in some cases requiring specified language to
be included in the vows.
As a result, some couples decide that getting a wedding license at
home, before they sail, followed by a small courthouse ceremony
is easier, cheaper, and more convenient. On the ship or in port, the
couple can then proceed with a symbolic wedding ceremony com-
plete with officiant and spoken vows.
The need to attend to legal details underscores the value of work-
ing with an experienced cruise wedding coordinator. She is able to
tell you what the rules and regulations for that territory are; what
paperwork, documentation, and fees are necessary; and what
forms you can file in person versus through the mail. Be sure to
work out these details with her well in advance.
The officiant a ship supplies may be a religious, nondenomina-
tional, or authorized civil representative. Civil authorities are gen-
erally justices of the peace or notaries. Holland America always
has a priest onboard, and a minister and rabbi sail during holidays
as well. Couples who prefer to be married by a specific person
must arrange in advance to bring the individual onboard and pay
for that person’s services separately.
Many people have a misconception that a ship’s captain can perform
wedding ceremonies. You can find only one exception: Princess Cruises,
which is registered in Bermuda, can issue a Bermudian license in
international waters — and Princess captains can marry a couple on-
board while the ship is at sea. Weddings on all other cruise ships can
only take place when the ship is docked, and couples must abide by
the laws of the location unless they have a purely symbolic wedding.

Hiring a private boat and captain
The ultimate in luxury, a private yacht allows you to truly set your own course. And
renting a yacht isn’t as expensive as you may think. More and more couples, groups
of friends, and families are chipping in to spend their vacation flying to a warm des-
tination such as the Caribbean, where they meet the boat. They sail in and out of
secluded coves, swim in warm turquoise waters, head into port for some sightsee-
ing and shopping, and yes, find time to get married either by bringing an officiant
onboard or having the ceremony in port.
To do the coordinating yourself, start by contacting a company such as The
Moorings (www.moorings.com), which arranges yacht charters all over the
world.

Overcoming Your Fears
If you’ve never cruised, one or both of you may have some ques-
tions or feel anxious about the cruising experience and having a
wedding at sea. Relax. Millions of people cruise annually without
incident. Here I address some of the common concerns that
newbie couples have about cruising to help put your mind at rest.
 What if our entire wedding party gets seasick? That’s highly
unlikely, because most weddings take place when the ship is
docked. Also, modern ships have stabilizers that keep things
rolling smoothly. If you hit rough waters, your cabin steward or
the ship’s doctor can supply something to calm your stomach.
 What if a guest misses the boat? Weddings that take place
onboard are scheduled for hours before the ship sails. If you
plan to be married after departure, your guests can fly and
meet you at the next port.
 Will we be bored after the wedding? You won’t have time to
sample all the activities on sea days. In port, you can choose
from a variety of excursions and adventures, ranging from
swimming with dolphins to hiking on the edge of a volcano.
 Will we gain weight? Maybe — but hey, you’ll be married by
then. Cruise food is plentiful, always available, and scrump-
tious. To counter its effects, you can go swimming, use the
jogging track and fitness center, take yoga and aerobics
classes, and call upon a personal trainer. Vegetarian and
healthy selections are served at every meal.
 Can we catch the Norwalk virus? After the epidemics a few
years ago, ships became much more conscientious about sani-
tation. Now many cruise lines provide antibacterial hand soap
for passengers to use before each boarding. To find out a par-
ticular vessel’s sanitation rating, see www.cdc.gov/nceh/vsp.
 Will we be surrounded by older people? Yes — and young
people. And parents with kids. And couples in love. Fact is,
different cruise lines have different features that attract differ-
ent types of passengers. A smart travel agent can steer you to
a ship that’s right for the two of you.
 Do we have to eat meals with strangers? Most ship dining
rooms have a majority of tables that accommodate six to eight
people, and passengers are assigned to their tables for the length
of the cruise — which is perfect if you’re traveling with a small
group. If you prefer to eat by yourselves, ask your travel agent
to request a table for two or choose a Princess or Norwegian
ship, where diners choose a different table each night. Specialty
restaurants on ships are also a good option for dining à deux.

After the Wedding: Creating a
Honeymoon Haven at Sea
Whether you’re sailing on alone or with your wedding party, you’re
entitled to some private honeymoon time on your journey. You’ll
find that cruising can be incredibly romantic, whether it’s the two
of you on deck at night under the stars, kissing on your private bal-
cony, steeping in a Jacuzzi after everyone else has gone to bed,
slow dancing to live music in one of the lounges, or indulging in a
spa massage for two.
Any travel agent who’s on the ball will notify the ship that it’s your
honeymoon, and you may get special treatment. Some ships host a
special cocktail party for newlyweds, but don’t leave all the honey-
moon planning up to them. If you can afford it, book a stateroom
with a queen- or king-size bed and private balcony. Want to really
splurge? Trade up to a suite with a butler or concierge, and have
them deliver room-service meals with champagne!

Getting the
Destination Wedding
You Want

In this part . . .
When the time comes to focus on the nitty-gritty of plan-
ning your destination wedding, this part drills down to the
details. Chapter 11 helps you navigate the travel aspect,
whether you work with a travel agent or on your own, and
steers you toward getting the best rates for yourselves
and your guests. You also ﬁnd information on securing a
passport if you’re leaving the country.
Chapter 12 gives you the inside scoop on how to pull
together the party elements — invitations, food and drink,
music, ﬂowers, photography, plus welcome-bag essentials
for guests. In Chapter 13, I lead you to the altar and show
you how to get it looking great for your ceremony. Chapter
14 does the same for the two of you, with advice from
fashion insiders on what the well-dressed destination
bride and groom should wear, plus how to transport your
wedding gear so it looks as fresh as it did when you ﬁrst
tried it on.

Making Travel Arrangements
In This Chapter
 Discovering how your wedding date can affect travel costs
 Acting as your own trip planner
 Knowing when to use a travel agent
 Keeping guests apprised of travel plans
 Arranging transportation at your destination
P
art II discusses many locations you and your other half may
want to consider for your destination wedding. After you
decide on a place, the next step is to ensure that you and your
wedding party arrive there safely and on time.
Before you begin making any travel arrangements, be reassured
that your job is to be the bride or groom, not double as a travel
agent. Your responsibility is neither to make all your guests’
arrangements nor pay for their trip. However, you’re expected to
scout possibilities and inform friends and family of travel and lodg-
ing options. Whether you’re experienced travelers or first-timers,
this chapter can help to lay the groundwork so that saying “I will
attend” is a no-brainer for attendants, family, and guests.
What You Need to Know Before
Making Travel Plans
Before jumping in to plan your wedding travel, it’s important to
make some preliminary decisions so that you can communicate
productively with travel sellers and get what you want from them.

Part III: Getting the Destination Wedding You Want 
182
Whether you assume trip planning yourselves or are assisted by a
travel agent, you need to focus on the following:
 Know your dates. Decide on the optimal day and time you
want to go. If you’re flexible and willing to travel earlier or later,
better rates may be available. (See the next section, “Choose
Wisely: How a Date Can Influence How Much You Pay”.)
 Keep good notes. Even if you know your destination well, you
may not yet have decided on the hotel where you want to stay
or the ideal flights. As you research or your travel agent sug-
gests locations, keep track of the most appealing places and
offers.
 Choose refundable or nonrefundable rates. Nonrefundable,
nonexchangeable rates are cheapest but more restrictive.
Choose refundable rates if cancellations are a possibility.
 Consider buying travel insurance. Normally I don’t recommend
travel insurance, but with so much at stake for a wedding, insur-
ance can protect you and your investment should trouble occur.
To compare policies, visit www.insuremytrip.com. Read the
small print on any policy you consider because coverage varies.
Choose Wisely: How a Date Can
Influence How Much You Pay
After deciding to get married and then choosing to have your wed-
ding out of town, selecting a date is the next most important deci-
sion you need to make. It can influence how much you pay for
travel services and even affect who from your group can attend.
The further in advance your group buys airline tickets and reserves
hotel rooms, the less likely you are to be disappointed and shut out
of what you really want — and the less you generally have to pay.
On the flip side, if you wait until six weeks beforehand to make any
travel arrangements, don’t be surprised if you don’t get the hotel or
flight you really want or if you have to pay a hefty premium.
Looking at seasonal rates
Have you heard the term high season or low season? They refer to
the rates at hotels when a destination is most popular with tourists
(high season) and when rates are most affordable (low season).
Knowing what these terms mean can help you understand price
variations that can affect your budget.

Chapter 11: Making Travel Arrangements 183
Hotels in many vacation areas adjust their rates based on the
season. For example, rates in the Caribbean, Florida, and southern
cities traditionally go down when low season begins April 15. They
dip even more when hurricane season begins on June 1. Rates start
to rise again around Thanksgiving, peak at Christmas, and then
decline again in the spring. The same generally holds true for ski
resorts. In Europe, summer is high season; rates soar and many
nationalities consider the entire month of August vacation time,
leaving hotels and restaurants short-staffed.
Although weather may not be ideal during a low season, holding a
wedding after the crowds are gone yields cost savings; plus, planes
are usually less full, hotel rooms are easier to get, service people
are less overwhelmed, and special requests are more easily met.
Considering holidays and 
guests’ schedules
Should you hold your destination wedding over a long holiday
weekend, such as the Fourth of July or Labor Day? Although doing
so seems like a good idea — most people have time off from work,
so they aren’t likely to lose pay — it may not be. You need to take
into account the extra traffic and higher hotel and airline prices
surrounding major holidays.
Check the calendar of events for any destination you’re consider-
ing. Anything from a national holiday to a major convention can
affect your plans, hotel prices, the availability of venues, and the
level of service you receive.
You know your friends and family best. Do they always spend the
holiday the same way or with the same people? Then breaking with
tradition may disturb them. If they’re more free-spirited, they may
look to a holiday wedding as the best way to spend a long weekend.
Be ultrasensitive to the schedules of people whose presence you
consider essential to your wedding. That way, you can avoid
scheduling your wedding at a time that conflicts with their own
important personal days, such as a pregnancy due date, a child’s
birthday, or even the day that a long-labored-over project is due.
Planning the Trip Yourselves
Although a bride and groom can personally arrange travel itiner-
aries for members of their party, doing so would add many more
responsibilities to manage. Besides, you already have a wedding to

plan! However, if you’re a do-it-yourself type of couple, the best
scenario is when you have a very small group to organize or it’s
just the two of you traveling together.
Before you start making reservations, be prepared. Do the primary
travel research yourself using current travel guidebooks and the
Web. I find Frommer’s destination titles (published by Wiley) 
especially helpful and user-friendly, because they provide literally
hundreds of ideas for wedding settings and long-weekend stays.
If your guest list is sizeable or you haven’t done much traveling,
consider using a professional to handle the actual booking. Some
travel agents don’t charge a fee, and with their expertise, they can
save you time, money, and worry. (Check out “Using an Online or
Offline Agent” later for more info.)
This section provides the necessary info to help you plan the trip
on your own, including how to take advantage of airline deals and
how to work directly with a hotel or resort.
Grasping group travel discounts
If you’re arranging your own travel plans, be aware that you may be
entitled to a group travel discount. Many hotels, airlines, and cruise
lines welcome parties traveling together and often have a special
department that handles buying tickets and organizing itineraries.
Depending on the size of your group, you may be able to pick up a
good deal. Because selling a dozen plane tickets or rooms is more
efficient for hotels, airlines, and cruise ships than selling a single
one, they often pass on reduced rates or other incentives to group
members. If the party you assemble is large enough and books
through the same company, you may actually get a free flight or
your accommodations at no cost as the bride and groom.
Scoring airline group discounts
Depending on the airline, you may be able to earn a special deal if
your group travels from point A to point B together. The following
are some typical offers a wedding party might use:
 American Airlines: Discounts are available to groups of ten or
more people traveling together to the same airport.
 Hawaiian Airlines: When 20 guests or more book online using
a special code number (assigned when you register at www.
hawaiianair.com), a couple can get a one-way, first-class
upgrade.
Part III: Getting the Destination Wedding You Want 
184

To arrange a discount, call an airline directly and tell the reserva-
tionist that you want information on group travel rates. You can
access a list of airline phone numbers at http://airtravel.
about.com/cs/airlines/a/phonenumbers.htm. Airline prices,
although not negotiable, fluctuate day by day and hour by hour, so
you ought to “test the waters” for a few days, checking several times
to see what the range of rates is and buying when they’re lowest.
To save additional money, look beyond the major airlines for trans-
portation. Low-cost airlines, such as Southwest (www.southwest.
com; 800-433-5368) and jetBlue (www.jetblue.com; 800-538-2583) in
the United States and Ryanair (www.ryanair.com) and EasyJet
(www.easyjet.com) in Europe, offer good deals. For example,
Southwest offers discounts of 5 to 10 percent to groups of ten or
more and awards one free ticket if your group exceeds 40 people.
JetBlue extends its lowest fares available to groups of 15 or more
and flies to dozens of domestic cities as well as these popular 
wedding destinations: Bermuda, Puerto Rico, the Bahamas, and
Cancun. In Europe, Ryanair and EasyJet fares are downright cheap.
For all your wedding purchases, use a special credit card that
accrues travel points. I like The Knot Credit Card from American
Express (check it out at http://weddings.theknot.com/amex)
because this card is designed for brides and grooms and provides
a free wedding planning kit. If you buy enough stuff before you fly,
you can apply points to an upgrade certificate or even redeem
them for a free ticket on a choice of airlines.
Working directly with a hotel
After you find a hotel or resort you’re interested in, initiate direct
contact with an on-site representative. Ask to speak to the manager.
Chapter 11: Making Travel Arrangements 185
Flying first class isn’t as easy as it used to
be for the bride and groom
At one time, all flyers had to do to get upgraded to roomier business or first-class
seats was to tell the reservationist that they were en route to their wedding or
honeymoon. Alas, this has become rare. If you’re determined to sit up front, you’ll
have to buy a ticket either with cash or airline points.
One way to fly free as a bird and high in the skies: If you know any frequent fliers with
extra mileage, they may be willing to donate them to you in lieu of a wedding gift so
that you can get free seats or an upgrade.

If she isn’t the proper person to assist you, ask to be directed to
someone who will. If you aren’t helped, or are given the runaround,
look elsewhere: A property that can’t manage incoming calls is one
you don’t want to trust with your wedding party.
The Web can be a tremendous help in giving you an idea of what
things cost. By going to a hotel’s Web site and plugging in the dates
you want to stay there, you can see the rack rate — the highest
published rate. Consider it a starting point; when you contact a
human you should be able to get the room for less by asking for
the best available rate.
Always book hotel rooms by phone, rather than online. And when-
ever possible, call the direct number of the hotel, not the toll-free
one. The latter usually takes you to a centralized reservation
center, and reservationists may not be aware of the latest and
lowest local rates.
When you call directly, let the representative know you’re consid-
ering booking a destination wedding group with rooms for your-
selves and your guests (if you’ve invited some) and possibly party
space. The following questions are key to establishing whether a
place is right for you and your gang:
 How many rooms does the hotel have, and how many are
available for the days you want? The answer to this question
tells you whether your hotel is intimate (under 100 rooms),
medium-size (under 250 rooms), or large — and consequently
what percentage of it your guests will fill.
 What types of guest rooms are available? Usually hotels
have a combination of single rooms and suites with a separate
living room and bedroom. If families are traveling together,
they may need these bigger rooms or adjoining ones. Some
resorts have private villas with multiple bedrooms, which can
be ideal for a small destination wedding party.
 What facilities does the hotel or resort have for a wedding?
Are there scenic areas, an outdoor terrace, an indoor ball-
room, or special suites for smaller parties? Do they cater ban-
quet meals?
 Does the hotel or resort have a standard wedding package?
Can it be customized? Do you have an on-site coordinator?
 What recreational facilities are on-site? Is there a swimming
pool? Golf course? Spa? What about tours of area attractions?
Does the hotel arrange them? You may favor a resort that offers
guests a variety of recreational activities during their stay.
Part III: Getting the Destination Wedding You Want 
186

 What are the best rates available for a party of your size?
Ask the hotel whether it offers a group discount or special
accommodations for the bride and groom.
 Does the hotel hold a reservation? Hotels will set aside a
group of rooms for your guests to book by an established
date. However, the hotel only holds those rooms for so long,
so you need to find out the date by which guests must book to
secure a room, when is a deposit required, and how much.
 What is the cancellation policy? What if some guests pull
out? What if the event has to be postponed or cancelled? You
need to know what costs you may incur if your plans change.
 What is unique about your property? This question gives the
hotel or resort rep an opportunity to bring out points that you
may not have been aware of and can help you in making your
ultimate decision about where to stay.
Don’t make the mistake of selecting a hotel based only on price.
And always negotiate. When hotels put their first offer on the table,
responding with “Can you do better?” never hurts. You may be sur-
prised by how much better they can do. A hotel that truly wants
your business should tempt you with a menu of amenities, dis-
counts, and freebies. Some resorts offer a sweetheart deal to cou-
ples who return on their anniversary.
If your wedding is in a destination that has multiple hotels nearby,
give guests a choice of places to stay at different price points and
designate one as the main meeting place. This plan makes sense
for bigger groups. If you’re using a travel agent, ask her to propose
a few choices.
Snagging a group deal on a cruise
Travel agents can be extremely helpful in securing cabins for you
and your wedding party on a cruise and at an advantageous rate. If
a cruise wedding is something you’re considering, see Chapter 10.
Using an Online or Offline Agent
Turning to experts for help in planning travel is smart — especially
if you can get their services for free. Travel agents receive dis-
counted rates from hotels, airlines, and cruises, and then charge
customers the same rates as they would pay if they booked a trip
themselves.
Chapter 11: Making Travel Arrangements 187

If your destination wedding includes more than just a few people, a
travel agent can
 Organize everyone’s travel plans. Although buying one flight
online or over the phone is simple enough for an individual,
the job of coordinating multiple schedules for people flying in
from different cities, at different times, and with different lodg-
ing requirements calls for help from a pro.
 Handle travel-related problems. If you use a travel agent, you
have someone to contact when something — a cancelled flight,
a messed-up reservation, a car rental overcharge — goes wrong.
If you have enough on your mind just trying to plan your wedding
and don’t want to hassle with making any travel arrangements, this
section discusses how an online or offline travel agent can help
relieve at least a bit of stress.
Making arrangements online
Have you ever booked a hotel or bought an airline ticket online? If
so, you know how simple and convenient the process is. Wonder
whether you can use them to book your wedding travel online, too?
Expedia (www.expedia.com; 800-397-3342) and Travelocity (www.
travelocity.com; 888-872-8356) make their agents available by
phone — but they only book air travel for wedding parties up to
six persons.
Destinationweddings.com (www.destinationweddings.com) offers
services to plan, coordinate, and arrange travel to a wedding away
from home. Although the company specializes in booking weddings
at Sandals resorts, it can arrange travel to just about any place you
want. What’s more, the site’s travel specialists are familiar with coun-
tries’ marriage requirements. Destinationweddings.com also has a
network of on-site wedding coordinators it refers customers to, 
provides tools ranging from a free wedding Web site to save-the-
date e-mails, and offers payment plans that help make travel
expenses more manageable.
Don’t buy travel from any site or agent without comparing prices
first. FareCompare (www.farecompare.com) and Kayak (www.
kayak.com/buzz) are comparison sites that look at low airfares
across the Web. TripAdvisor (www.tripadvisor.com) enables
users to search multiple hotel sites for costs.
Part III: Getting the Destination Wedding You Want 
188

Dealing with a corner travel agent
Establishing a face-to-face, personal connection with a reputable
local travel agent can help ease the stress of planning a destination
wedding. If you haven’t worked with a travel agent before, the very
best way to find one is through a personal recommendation. You
can also search the Web sites of American Express Travel (www.
americanexpress.com/travel) and the American Society of
Travel Agents (www.astanet.com) to find an agent by zip code. If
none of that works, pick up the Sunday newspaper and check the
ads in the travel section for contacts.
To get the most out of a consultation, be prepared to share this
information with any agent that you visit:
 The dream: Do you have a vision of what your wedding looks
like? Describe the setting in as much detail as you can conjure
so that the agent can understand your expectations.
 Date: When do you want to hold the wedding? And how many
days do you expect the entire event to last?
 Place: Where you want to go? Do you have a specific destina-
tion in mind? Do you know what hotel or facility you want, or
do you need recommendations?
 Budget: How much money can you afford to spend to travel?
Who is paying? Are you picking up any travel expenses other
than your own?
Chapter 11: Making Travel Arrangements 189
Using an online social travel planner
If the two of you are MySpace–type users who are comfortable interacting online,
you should know about two relatively new sites that help you organize your group
travels. As of this writing, neither site had booking functionality.
 TripHub (www.triphub.com) offers free organizing tools, can clue you in
about group bookings, and lets you collaborate online with invitees. This site
also has links to group reservations pages for major hotels.
 Triporama (triporama.com) lets you store, organize, and share travel
research with your group.
Follow instructions on these sites to get optimal results from them, and invite all
your Web-savvy friends to participate by sending them the URLs in an e-mail and
scheduling a time when they can join you online.

 Guest list: How many people are traveling, and do you want to
help set up their itineraries?
 Extras: Are there side trips or excursions you want to include?
Is additional transportation, such as airport transfers and
rental cars, required?
 Honeymoon: Do you plan to celebrate your marriage in the
same place and immediately after the wedding, or do you
want to visit another destination?
When you begin dealing with a travel agent, he is likely to have a
number of questions as well, all designed to help you narrow down
your choices. When you settle on the likeliest ideas, ask for a
couple of different options so that you can compare prices and
other variables such as location and amenities.
Because travel agents work on commission, you may find one
encouraging you to choose a specific hotel or cruise line that
rewards her more than others. If that offer isn’t what you want, 
say so — and walk out if you feel pressured.
Sending Guests in the 
Right Direction
Although the personal touch is lovely and appropriate when dealing
with older friends and relatives who aren’t Web-savvy, the Internet is
now the best way to communicate travel info to your guests.
Put travel information directly in an e-mail or direct guests to visit
your wedding Web site (check out Chapter 3 for info on creating
and using a “wedsite”) after travel plans are finalized and you have
updated the information they need. You’ll need to notify guests
and family members who don’t use a computer, either by phone or
creating a travel info sheet and mailing it to them.
The following list includes major details guests need to know:
 Dates: They already may have circled the exact date of your
wedding on their calendar, but now they need to know when
to arrive and the day to check out.
 Locations: Announce your destination and provide Web links
to appropriate tourism sites. Also note the location of the
wedding ceremony itself, the reception, and the main hotel
where you will be staying, with links and the phone numbers.
Part III: Getting the Destination Wedding You Want 
190

 Travel arrangements: If you’ve set up a group travel deal,
post the contact information and code to use (if applicable).
Let guests know whether they have a choice of hotels to stay
in, and send a link to the individual properties. If everyone is
expected to make plans independently, recommend airlines
with the most direct routes to your destination.
 Schedule of events: This info can be a work-in-progress. Even
if you don’t have all the details, you can let guests know
you’re planning pre-wedding activities, dinner, and opportuni-
ties to tour, play beach volleyball, golf, and so on. You can
include the final schedule in a newsletter you prepare for
them to get when they arrive (check out Chapter 15 to see a
sample).
 Passport and visa info: Leaving the country for your wed-
ding? Guests need a passport and possibly a visa. (Review the
sidebar “Securing passports, visas, and more.”)
 Currency exchange: If the U.S. dollar isn’t accepted as cur-
rency where you’re heading, alert guests (and tell them the
best place to exchange money is at an airport ATM after
arrival). Chapter 4 tells you more.
 Proposed packing list: Although you may have been mentally
packing (and unpacking) your suitcase for months, guests
may need some reminding of what to bring (and reassurance
of what’s appropriate to wear). Guide them.
In your correspondence with your guests, ask them to e-mail you
their travel arrangements. You can keep an eye on everyone by 
setting up a spreadsheet that tracks their travel plans (refer to
Figure 11-1).
Figure 11-1: A guest-tracker spreadsheet allows you to know your guests’ travel
arrangements.
Chapter 11: Making Travel Arrangements 191

This tool will be useful to turn over to any travel agent, on-site
wedding planner, or event coordinator. By knowing your guests’
arrival times, you can better schedule events. And if you, the plan-
ner, or someone at the hotel is managing transportation for their
departures, it’s important to know when they will check out.
You’re the bride or groom, not a camp counselor. Still, someone
needs to look after guests to make sure none feel emotionally or
physically lost after making the trek to witness your wedding. For
more info on how to do this, see Chapter 15.
Planning the Ground Transportation
The two of you aren’t the only ones on the move during your
event. Guests will be arriving, perhaps taking excursions, attending
the wedding, and then making their way home. Even if the spot
where you’re having the ceremony and where you’re all staying is
the same, you still need to consider ground transportation to and
from the airport. Travel agencies often offer package deals includ-
ing airfare, hotel, and transfers from the airport to the hotel and
back to the airport. You’ll also find that many resorts provide this
service at no extra charge. This section can help you square away
the details.
Part III: Getting the Destination Wedding You Want 
192
Securing passports, visas, and more
If you intend to leave the United States for your wedding after June 2009, you’re
likely to need a passport. A visa and vaccinations may also be required; the rules
vary from nation to nation. If you don’t already have a passport or need to renew
one, start by visiting the U.S. Department of State Web site (http://travel.
state.gov). You can also go to a Passport Acceptance Facility; major post offices
and other municipal offices are so designated and can be found on the U.S.
Department of State site, too. You can also use the customer service line
(877-487-2778) to help you navigate the travel documents process.
Allow the passport office at least six weeks to process your application. Expedited
service, which is more expensive, delivers your passport in about two weeks.
Private companies promise even quicker turnaround at exorbitant prices.
You can find visa information online at http://usembassy.state.gov. Click
on the name of the country you intend to visit to find out whether a visa is required
and how to obtain one. To determine whether vaccinations are necessary for visi-
tors to your destination, go to www.cdc.gov/travel/vaccinat.htm.

Getting the happy couple to
and from the wedding site
How do you plan to arrive at your destination wedding? Jumping
off a ski lift holding hands? Rowed in an outrigger canoe by a Fijian
in full warrior dress? In a carriage pulled by white steeds? In a
rented Rolls-Royce or other classic car?
If your plans involve a “sand” blast, your conveyance can be as infor-
mal as the setting. A convertible can be lots of fun, and an antique
boat that docks at the shoreline definitely makes a statement. Just
want to get there in time? Line up a golf cart or an entire caravan of
them for the wedding party; less-able guests will appreciate it.
Daunted by the expense of renting wedding transportation or
having to plan one more thing? Arrive the way European couples do
in the Continent’s most charming villages: Walk there arm in arm.
To arrange your “special delivery,” speak with your wedding coor-
dinator or the hotel’s transportation chief. The mode of trans-
portation you choose is only limited by what’s available, the cost,
and your imagination.
Shuttling guests around
In addition to arranging their own on-site transportation, many cou-
ples also pick up some guests’ transportation costs. Often the most
confusing and distressing part of arriving in a new place is getting off
the plane and wondering where to go next. You can cut down on
guests’ anxiety by working with your hotel to arrange for a shuttle to
bring guests from the airport to your location. Imagine how relieved
people will be to spot a sign that has your names and the words wed-
ding party held by a driver right outside baggage claim or immigration.
Whether you help out or not with ground transportation costs,
encourage guests to make the trip together to save energy and
money. By referencing your guest tracker (check out the “Sending
Guests in the Right Direction” section earlier), you can see who is
arriving around the same time, and you can notify them to be on
the lookout for one another and share a ride.
Lugging Around Luggage
The worst thing about traveling for a length of time is having to
schlep luggage from place to place. And when you’re having a 
Chapter 11: Making Travel Arrangements 193

wedding away, you aren’t merely packing vacation wear. You have
all your wedding gear plus the additional items you may want to
import for the wedding, plus attendants’ gifts, plus favors for
guests. Are your arms tired yet?
Although both of you should carry your wedding garments, medi-
cations, and eyeglasses with you, consider sending other items on
ahead. For example, you don’t need to carry objects you intend to
include in guests’ welcome bags. Not only is shipping items con-
venient (and ensures that no one will have back strain on the wed-
ding night), it saves you from spending even more time at the
airport, clearing security and then customs when traveling back
into the country. You also need to be aware of what you can and
can’t take onboard. (Check out the nearby sidebar “Following TSA
and airline rules” for specifics.)
Using a company such as FedEx (www.fedex.com), Virtual Bellhop
(www.virtualbellhop.com), or The Luggage Club (www.the
luggageclub.com), your luggage and other parcels can be picked
up at home, delivered to your destination before you arrive, and
returned back home when you end your trip. The cost can run into
the hundreds of dollars depending on the package weight, but that
may be a small price to pay for the aggravation it saves.

Following TSA and airline rules
The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has strict rules pertaining to what
can be brought onboard an airplane. Your carry-on bag can contain one quart-size,
clear-plastic bag that holds three-ounce (or smaller) containers of liquids or gels.
Because TSA rules are known to change, check www.tsa.gov for the latest
updates before you begin to pack.
Be sure to secure your airline luggage with TSA-approved locks, sold online and in
luggage stores. These locks can be opened only by you and officials with a master
key. Otherwise, inspectors have the right to break locks. Also check with your air-
line to determine the size of carry-on you may bring. On American Airlines, for exam-
ple, the length plus width plus height of the bag can’t total more than 45 inches.
eBags (www.ebags.com) sells a garment bag that measures 60” x 22” x 3”, a size
that accommodates most destination wedding gowns. To bring yours aboard, you
need to temporarily fold it in thirds (pack with lots of tissue paper), and then ask the
flight attendant to hang it up as soon as you board.

fter you decide where to hold your destination wedding (refer
to Part II for help if you haven’t already made that choice) and
after travel arrangements are underway (see Chapter 11), it’s time
to visualize your wedding style, notify guests, and pull together the
elements you need to make the event a reality. Ideally you can com-
plete as many of these tasks as possible before leaving home.
Planning a wedding, at home or away, can be a stressful event. I
hope I can ease a bit of your stress with the info in this chapter,
which provides info on invitations, the rehearsal (and rehearsal
dinner), the caterer, decorations, photography, music, and more.
As you go through this chapter, notice that I focus on how these
topics relate to destination weddings. If it’s a matter of plain old
wedding info you need, I recommend you pick up a copy of
Wedding Planning For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Marcy Blum and
Laura Fisher Kaiser (Wiley).

First Things First: Choosing 
Colors for Your Wedding
If you didn’t select colors when you were shopping for wedding
wear, do it now. Everything from your invitations to your table
linens will have a consistent look when you use the same shades.
Because your wedding is taking place in a very special location,
why not pick colors that complement it? For example:
 Tropical wedding: Lemon, lime, tangerine, hot pink, turquoise
 Garden wedding: Yellow, pink, lavender, bright green, white
 Mountain wedding: Sky blue, silver, evergreen
 Vegas wedding: Red, black, white, silver
 Winery wedding: Burgundy, brown, green, gold
Deciding How Many Days to
Schedule for Your Event
During the early planning process, you need to look at how many
days you want to ask guests to share your wedding experience —
and how many days the two of you need to spend in the location
before and after. Ample advance warning enables friends and
family to adjust their schedules and book rooms and flights while
they’re available.
Furthermore, by getting to the destination ahead of time, the two
of you can ensure that all systems are go before people arrive, and
then when they do, you can truly enjoy their company (for more
on arriving ahead of time, head to Chapter 13). This section
explains how to determine your schedule for your wedding get-
away and what to consider when planning all the events.
Keeping the main events in mind
The typical destination wedding lasts three to four days over a
weekend. You may want to shorten or extend the length of time,
depending on the distance people have to travel, how much guests
can afford to spend on extra nights’ lodging, and how long you want
to entertain them before or after the wedding. (Individuals who stay
on after your honeymoon officially begins are on their own.)

Chapter 12: Before You Go: Putting Your Wedding Plans in Place 197
Most couples invite guests to follow a schedule similar to this:
 Thursday/Friday: Arrive and check into hotel.
 Friday day: Relax and explore the surroundings.
 Friday night: Attend the rehearsal dinner.
 Saturday morning: Participate in a group activity with the
wedding couple.
 Saturday afternoon. Join a second group activity (without the
couple) or take advantage of some free time.
 Saturday evening: Take part in the ceremony and reception.
 Sunday: Attend a farewell brunch, check out, and depart.
Don’t feel as if you have to follow the standard destination wed-
ding schedule. No rule says you can’t have the ceremony midweek
(when rates are usually lower), plan for your wedding to take place
at the beginning of a ten-day cruise, or even organize a villa-to-villa
group bike tour that concludes with a midnight ceremony in a con-
verted castle in Tuscany a week later. It’s up to you.
Factoring in travel time
If flying to your destination involves many hours and major time
changes, I advise adding a day or two to the beginning of a trip to
allow guests (and yourselves) time to recover from the flight and
adjust their body clocks.
Sending Invitations
How do you announce your intentions to friends and family and let
them know you have something unique planned for your wedding?
That’s the job of invitations, and because your wedding will take
guests away from home, you have additional considerations to
take into account. This section gives you the quick lowdown.
Determining your guest list
Although almost every bride and groom struggles with the issue of
who to invite and who to leave at home, destination couples usu-
ally have an “out.” Because these weddings are typically smaller
and require a substantial commitment of time and money on the
part of guests, most people who are tangential to your life, such as

co-workers and distant relatives, seem to understand if they’re not
invited. Keep in mind that your guest list should not exceed the
number of people your venue holds.
After you make up your individual guest lists, review them
together, asking yourselves these questions about each name:
 Is this someone we’d enjoy spending part of a vacation with?
 Can she afford the wedding travel expenses? If not, should we
offer to subsidize?
 Is this person healthy enough to travel? Can we depend on
him to get to our destination without help or will he need
assistance?
 Will this person be comfortable in the location we’ve picked?
 If the guest is single, should we invite her “plus one”?
 Does this person suffer from fear of flying?
 Does our friend have special medical or dietary needs our
facility can’t satisfy?
 Will this person need to bring a child or children along?
One of the biggest dilemmas destination wedding couples face
when deciding on their guest list is to invite or not to invite chil-
dren. Kids can play one of two parts in a wedding: as guests or as
participants in the ceremony. If you’re planning on a pint-size
flower girl or ring bearer, youngsters should be integrated into the
festivities (no question). If not, you need to decide whether you
want to allow children at all.
Consider welcoming children to your destination wedding if
 They’re your own kids, and you can’t imagine a wedding with-
out them.
 You’re happy to have them, especially because your caterer
doesn’t charge for guests under a certain age.
 You have someone on-site who’s mature, trustworthy, and
available to provide childcare when necessary.
 You choose a family-friendly resort as your destination.
You probably want to leave kids at home if
 You simply don’t want them there. It’s your wedding, and no
excuses are necessary.
 Space is limited.
Part III: Getting the Destination Wedding You Want 
198

 You’ve selected a resort to marry at that doesn’t allow guests
under a certain age.
 You’re on a tight budget, and every head counts.
 You’ve planned a sophisticated event and are aiming for 
perfection.
 The idea of finding small fingerprints smeared across your
dress or on the wedding cake leaves you faint.
 Even their folks would rather travel without them.
Whatever policy you decide about kids, apply it to every guest. As
soon as you make an exception for one, another guest who isn’t
granted the same may not forgive you.
Starting with a save-the-date notice
Save-the-date cards inform people well in advance to expect an invi-
tation to a future event, allowing them to block out time on their
schedules. If your wedding invitations are printed and ready to go,
you don’t need this item. But because many couples pin down the
place and date of their wedding before they think about ordering
invitations, save-the-date cards (see Figure 12-1) fill the gap.
Figure 12-1: Save-the-date cards let guests know they’re in for 
something special at the destination you’ve chosen.

Some wedding guides tell you that a year, six months, or ten weeks
in advance is the proper length of time to send a save-the-date
notice. I say, send it out not so far in the future that you forget why
you wanted that person at your wedding, and not so late that the
only lodgings left will be a cot in your bridal suite.
Whether you distribute a formal, funky, or e-mail save-the-date
card, that’s up to you. Lots of stationers have preprinted cards
designed expressly for this purpose. If you want to spread the
word in a more memorable way, consider the following:
 Writing the info on the back of a postcard that shows your
wedding destination
 Mailing a luggage tag with your info tucked behind the clear
plastic portion
 Creating your own card with a picture of the two of you by
using Shutterfly (www.shutterfly.com)
 Purchasing a passport holder for each guest and slipping your
info into the sleeve
 Sending a pretty washcloth with a teasing note that explains
they’ll get the rest of the beach towel at your wedding
 Asking a friend who’s good with graphics to turn a travel
poster into a JPEG that’s e-mailed with your information on it
It doesn’t matter what form your save-the-date takes as long as it
includes your names, the dates of the event, and the fact that
you’re having a destination wedding.
Figuring out what kind of invitation
is right for your wedding
The type of invitation you send says a lot about you and your 
wedding. You want to pick an invitation that reflects your style.
Although traditionalists still go for engraved lettering on white or
ecru stock, as a destination-wedding couple you can be as casual
or as formal as you like.
Depending on your budget, you can choose from the following,
which are organized from the most expensive to the least:
 Custom invitations: These types of invites are often the most
beautiful. Tiny seashells, pine cones, or even crystal snowflakes
attached to paper provide guests with an enchanting preview
of what’s to come. Allow plenty of time for printing, plus more
Part III: Getting the Destination Wedding You Want

weeks for custom calligraphy. To be inspired by top-of-the-line
design, see Red Bliss (www.redbliss.com).
 Stationery store invitations: Because as many as 25 percent
of weddings today are to destinations, you can likely find a
selection of off-the-rack invitations that symbolize your loca-
tion at a stationery store. You can also look through sample
books. If you want the info on a sample invitation to be per-
sonalized, allow several weeks for delivery.
 Online invitations: The advantage of buying from a vendor
such as Jean M (www.myjeanm.com) is that you can set up sta-
tionery to your specifications, see examples of invitation
wording, choose your colors and font, and proofread cards —
all online.
 Do-it-yourself invitations: Office-supply stores sell blank note
cards, and you can also find ones intended as wedding invita-
tions. Using your own computer printer and a pretty font, you
can save a bundle.
 Hotel-supplied invitations: In some instances, hotels and
resorts include in a wedding package a specified number of
blank announcements for you to customize as part of a package.
 E-mail invitations: You wouldn’t be the first couple who
invited guests to your wedding through e-mail, but you ought
to think twice about it — especially if you’re sending a text-
filled e-mail rather than graphical one. Evite (www.evite.com)
features free wedding invitation templates that you can cus-
tomize. Still, you and your guests may prefer to treasure a real
invitation you can hold in your hands.
 Text invitations: u2 won’t r8 w guests if u do this.
Turning to whichever source you use for invitations to supply all
your other wedding stationery needs is definitely convenient, and
that way, everything matches. So as you order invitations, also
consider your needs for table cards, menus, personalized napkins,
matchbooks, wedding announcements (for guests who couldn’t
make it and others you want to notify), and thank-you notes.
Sending travel info
After you choose a type of invitation (see the preceding section),
make sure you provide guests with the essential info about your cer-
emony and activities. Because your guests will be traveling a long
distance (compared to if you were getting married at a neighborhood
Chapter 12: Before You Go: Putting Your Wedding Plans in Place 201

church), you want to spell out the following (you can mail this info
in a packet with the invitation or under separate cover):
 Destination information: Start with a cover sheet that
describes the destination. If your destination has a tourism
Web site, include that URL and encourage guests to visit it to
discover more about the location. You can also put in a cus-
tomized map (see Figure 12-2) and travel guide to the area.
 Hotel information: If you want to give people a choice of
hotels, provide Web addresses, price ranges, and reservation
numbers. If all are expected to stay at the same resort, let
them know whether you’ve arranged a discount rate and how
to request it.
 Flight information: Provide the names, URLs, and phone num-
bers of recommended carriers and info on how to arrange a
discounted flight.
 Daily itinerary: State what time major events — checkin,
rehearsal dinner, group activities, ceremony, reception,
farewell brunch, and checkout — are scheduled.
 Airport transportation: Tell guests how they can reach hotels.
Do you recommend a shuttle, public transportation, taxi, or
rental car? Supply phone numbers if guests need to arrange
their own transportation after arriving at your destination.
Figure 12-2: Adding a map to 
your info packet, such as this 
fanciful one from www.
stephanniebarba.com, 
helps guests understand your 
location.
Part III: Getting the Destination Wedding You Want 
202

 Climate: Give average high and low, day and evening tempera-
tures to help them decide how to dress.
 Suggested packing list: Inform your guests what types of
items to bring and wear before, during, and after the wedding.
 Passport reminder: Unless the wedding is in the United
States, Puerto Rico, or the United States Virgin Islands, guests
need their passports as ID.
Assembling the Rehearsal
Having a run-through of your ceremony allows the two of you, your
attendants, and your family members an opportunity to walk down
the aisle and understand their place in the ceremony as well as the
sequence of events. After you practice everything, you’ll also want
an opportunity to thank those people who are closely involved in
your ceremony and to celebrate during a rehearsal dinner.
However, you can’t throw these details together at the last minute.
This section identifies what you need to do to plan your rehearsal
and your rehearsal dinner so everyone is ready for the big event.
Chapter 12: Before You Go: Putting Your Wedding Plans in Place 203
How to personalize your invitations
The Web is a terrific resource for finding proper and alternative wedding invitation
wording. To research the options, Google the phrases wedding invitation language,
wedding invitation etiquette, and wedding invitation samples.
Because many destination wedding couples pay for the event themselves, their invi-
tations need not be formal (or obligatorily credit parents who are footing the bill).
Feel free to have fun with your invitation language (as long as it includes the who,
what, where, and when of the event). Some phrases you can start off with are:
 “Come away with us.”
 “Grandma went to Florida, and all we got were lousy T-shirts. We’re going to
the Bahamas, and you’re going to get a tan.”
 “What would Italy (Jamaica, Savannah, or so on) be without you?”
 “He’s a prince. She’s a princess. So they’re getting married in a castle — and
your presence is commanded.”
 “Salut! You’re invited to toast our upcoming wedding in a winery.”
 “Lucky in love! We’re getting married in Las Vegas, and you’re invited.”

Arranging the final walk-through:
Your rehearsal
Most destination wedding rehearsals are brief, informal affairs that
take place a day or a few hours before the main event. Again, as
with all things destination wedding–specific, the rehearsal is no big
deal; it’s just instruction on who walks down the aisle, and in what
order. (I didn’t even have a rehearsal for my wedding; the coordina-
tor basically directed my husband to stand at the altar and then
pushed me out the door when my processional music came on.)
Planning your rehearsal doesn’t take much, but just make sure that
your ceremony space is available for your “practice” day and time
and that you have someone to lead the rehearsal. Everything else
you can worry about after you arrive at your destination.
As you try to decide when to hold your rehearsal, consider that
wrangling everyone on Saturday afternoon, especially if they’ve
been out in the sun all morning, may be tough. Holding the
rehearsal Friday before or after dinner, or Saturday right after
breakfast, can increase attendance.
Planning a rehearsal dinner
Traditional rehearsal dinners are limited to immediate family and
other members of the wedding party. At a destination wedding, the
rehearsal dinner is more of a casual first-night get-together than a
formal occasion. Friends and family have converged from near and
far, and most couples want to use the time to meet, greet, and revel
with all of them the night before the wedding.
Resolving where to hold the dinner: On-site or off?
If you and your guests are all staying at the same resort and it has
multiple restaurants, you’ve got built-in choices as to where to
hold the rehearsal dinner. On the other hand, if you want to experi-
ence the local flavor with your whole crew, the rehearsal dinner is
the best opportunity to do so.
Check guidebooks or ask someone at your hotel who’s earned your
trust — perhaps a concierge, a front-desk clerk, or even the savvy
lady who cleans your room — what restaurant she recommends
for an authentic experience. Just make sure that whatever place
you pick can accommodate your size group and will hold a table
for you.
Part III: Getting the Destination Wedding You Want 
204

Untreated water in some Mexico destinations and other tropical
countries can carry bacteria that causes gastrointestinal illness. If
you have any question about your destination, check that restau-
rants and resorts you select have a water purification system. In
case of doubt, stick to bottled water, don’t use ice cubes, and avoid
salad and other foods rinsed with local water.
Making your dinner fun
Any way you look at it, your first night together ought to be fun.
Old friends are reunited, and new ones are introduced. Everyone
will have a story about getting to the destination or settling in.
However, if you want to kick things up a notch at your rehearsal
dinner, consider the following:
 Give it a theme (such as Pirates of the Sea or Lucky in Love).
 Hold the dinner in an unconventional space, such as an
amusement park, miniature golf course, or bowling alley.
 Use the location to its best advantage (such as a beach barbe-
cue, clambake, or winery cheese-and-wine tasting).
 Thank each person individually for coming by sharing your
connection to each guest.
The groom’s parents traditionally pick up the check at the
rehearsal dinner. If no representative from his side is there, the
groom himself, or both members of the couple, pay for everyone’s
dinners.
If your guest list is so large that a rehearsal dinner creates too
much expense, gather everyone for drinks instead — and then
head off with intimates for a private dinner afterward.
Settling on the Food
As any experienced party-giver knows, good food and drink are
essential to the success of a celebration. And you want your desti-
nation wedding reception to have that, right? Part of a wedding
coordinator’s job at a hotel or aboard a ship is to act as liaison to
the food and beverage, banquet, or restaurant manager. If you
aren’t working with a coordinator, you need to directly deal with
the individual in charge of the food and beverages. This section
can help you settle on a reputable caterer. You can also find info on
how to choose a menu for your destination wedding reception and
pick the perfect wedding cake (and find the guy to make it).
Chapter 12: Before You Go: Putting Your Wedding Plans in Place 205

Connecting with a caterer
Selecting a caterer you’ll be happy with is essential if you want
your reception to go off without a hitch. To make life easy on your-
selves, plan to have your reception in a place that is experienced
in providing good food. How can you know the food is good? Keep
these tips in mind:
 Sample the food beforehand. Ask to try a range of items, 
tasting just a small portion of each. (Check out the “Tasting
samples” section, later in this chapter.)
 Rely on recommendations. Turn to a local source such as
your hotel or other travelers. Or go online and look for
starred reviews at www.restaurants.com.
 Subscribe to an online service. For example, the recommen-
dations at Zagat Survey (www.zagat.com) can be helpful if
they cover the area you’re visiting.
If you want to hold your reception in a place where food must be
brought, you or your wedding planner need to work with a local
restaurateur or caterer to ensure that not only will your guests be
fed, but also everything from glassware to tables to servers is pro-
vided. Professional caterers should be able to furnish these items.
Ordering a menu that makes sense
Planning your wedding menu is literally an opportunity to show-
case your taste and style. With people more sophisticated about
cuisine these days, your menu is also an opportunity to be inven-
tive with both food and its presentation.
How many weddings have you been to where you looked down at
your plate and saw a piece of chicken covered in an unidentifiable
sauce? Hopefully, not too many. Chicken is a bland and boring
choice. And as a destination wedding couple, that’s simply not you.
You want your guests to look back on your wedding dinner and
have a memorable experience, right? If so, keep in mind the sug-
gestions in the following sections.
The type of meal affects the menu
The time of day you schedule for the reception influences the type
of meal you serve and the cost. (See Chapter 4 for more on budget-
ing.) For example, serving brunch after a morning ceremony or a
picnic lunch following a beach wedding isn’t uncommon. However,
because people stay the night at a destination wedding, dinner is
Part III: Getting the Destination Wedding You Want 
206

the meal most guests expect to share with you. So even if your 
ceremony takes place in daylight, plan to nourish guests when
darkness falls.
When you deal with a caterer, he can give you guidance on appro-
priate foods to serve at whatever time of day your reception takes
place.
How food is presented is also a choice you need to make. You can
have your guests serve themselves at a buffet line or have a wait
staff serve them. The choice depends on you, your budget, and the
type of meal you’re having. For example, if you schedule a formal
dinner and your plans involve a seating chart, you want table serv-
ice so guests stay put. Less-formal affairs, and meals in outdoor
settings, lend themselves to buffet service.
Tasting samples
Scheduling a tasting is one of the most fun parts of planning a wed-
ding. Its purpose can be to help you decide on either a caterer or a
menu or both. During the tasting is when you understand what
type of food the caterer can supply for your event. You can tell
when a caterer turns it into a bit of a celebration with flair that it’s
likely he will also bring that spirit to your event. To get the most
out of a tasting:
 Give the caterer ample time to prepare for the tasting.
 Review menus in advance, and specify items you want to
sample.
 Inform the caterer if you won’t consider certain items such as
milk-fed veal or foie gras, and ask for vegetarian options if you
have guests who don’t eat meat.
 Ask the chef to include your favorites, regional specialties,
and his signature dishes.
 Request that she use local ingredients whenever possible;
they’ll be fresher and cost less than importing them.
 Schedule a specific time for the tasting (you’re likeliest to get
his full attention midday and midweek).
 Request to have wine matched with each course.
 Eat and drink in moderation in order to sample everything
(and don’t feel as if you must finish it all — sometimes one
bite will do).
 Make notes after each item, rating how much you liked it.
 Based on your preferences, ask the caterer to submit a final
menu afterward for your approval.
Chapter 12: Before You Go: Putting Your Wedding Plans in Place 207

During the tasting, the caterer can provide you with a variety of
menu items to choose. Do make your preferences known. If you
don’t see a dish but would like to include it or you want the jerk
chicken at your wedding to conform to your Aunt Sherese’s recipe,
ask whether the chef is willing to cooperate.
Toasting with champagne or a custom cocktail
During the reception, toasting with champagne is traditional. The
best man begins the toasting, followed by family members and
then close friends. Having the groom toast the bride and vice versa
is a new trend that couples find especially meaningful. Make sure
you work directly with the caterer or your planner and order a bev-
erage of your choice for your toast.
Some wedding packages include a bottle of the bubbly, along with
a pair of keepsake flutes. Champagne (especially the real stuff,
imported from France) is expensive, so you may want to allot two
servings per guest for the toast and then switch to pouring wine
and nonalcoholic beverages.
If you’re not a champagne type of couple, you may want to tie the
toasting drink to your location. For example, tropical drinks such
as margaritas and piña coladas never go out of style in warm-
weather destinations. And thanks to the martini revival, lots of des-
tination weddings are also offering guests cosmopolitans, mojitos,
caipirinhas, and custom drinks.
Choosing a cake that stands
No reception feels complete without something sweet at the end.
Although a caterer may be able to supply a wedding cake — or it
may even come as part of a wedding package — the cake is often a
separate item that has to be special ordered from a bakery. Again,
a wedding coordinator can help you locate a baker, and the baker
can advise you on the size cake you need for the number of guests
you have.
Although the cake is traditionally displayed in the reception area
throughout the meal, if your guests are eating outdoors in the heat
or in a tent that isn’t air-conditioned, instruct servers to keep the
cake under wraps until right before cutting into it.
Many bakers are adept at packing and shipping wedding cakes;
however, this can be expensive and impractical if you’re marrying
far from home. You can trim costs by using a local bakery instead.
Part III: Getting the Destination Wedding You Want 
208

Even if you’re not getting married in Las Vegas, you can find inspi-
ration and wedding cake pictures at www.freedsbakery.com/
weddings-frameset.html. (Don’t look if you’re hungry!) If you
see something you like, print out the picture or save the Web page
and show it to your local coordinator to see whether she can have
it reproduced at your location.
Picking Flowers and Decor
Flowers are traditionally one of the major expenses of a wedding.
Yet I have some good news: Because you’re not having a traditional
wedding, you may not need to buy flowers to decorate at all. For
example, if you’re having your ceremony in a garden setting or on a
beach, recreating a floral wonderland is unnecessary. Couples who
opt for a wedding package at a hotel or on a ship may find that
flowers are included, especially if you’re to be married in a popu-
lar, multi-use chapel, such as the one in Las Vegas where I was wed.
It was already decked out with huge bouquets of fresh flowers so
all I had to concern myself with was the bouquet and boutonnière.
If you do want to add some flowers or other decorations to your
destination wedding, check with your hotel coordinator or your
wedding planner. This section can also give you a few ideas if
you’re a do-it-yourselfer (DIY).
Saving money with native flowers
Although some brides (and grooms) may have their hearts set on
using traditional wedding flowers, those flowers may not be readily
available at your location, and you may have to pay for them to be
imported. One way to save money with flowers is to choose from
indigenous blooms for the bouquet, boutonnière, and decorations
to keep costs down. Particularly if you’re getting married in a tropi-
cal locale, you don’t have to worry about their availability.
For example, orchids, hibiscus, birds of paradise, anthuriums, pink
ginger, pikake, protea, and frangipani are among the flowers that
bloom in humid climates and can enhance a bridal bouquet. Figure
12-3 illustrates some examples.
To get a feel for other examples of tropical bouquets, type the
phrase tropical bouquet into an Internet search engine and then
click on Images to view a variety of arrangements.
Chapter 12: Before You Go: Putting Your Wedding Plans in Place 209

Figure 12-3: Tropical flowers are beautiful. 
This bouquet mixes roses and red anthurium.
At a destination wedding, you also have the freedom to be more
informal and be imaginative with the style bouquet and comple-
mentary boutonnière you select. For example, hand-tied bouquets
wrapped with wired ribbon have a casual air that lends itself to
destination weddings. They can be augmented with wildflowers
and berries and streamers or glammed up with the addition of
crystals or pearls.
Embellishing your space
If you do decide to use flowers for your decorations and you aren’t
using a wedding planner, you need to work directly with a florist.
The following do’s and don’ts can help you make the most of your
surroundings while spending the least:
 Do look for an all-purpose florist. One who can supply vases
and props, rather than adding to your cost to rent them, is
ideal.
 Do consider the view. What will guests be looking at (besides
the two of you) during the ceremony? Devote the most atten-
tion to decorating that area.
 Don’t pick wildflowers. Unless you want to spend your wed-
ding night in jail, hands off the blooms. Picking wildflowers is
prohibited in most places.
 Don’t go overboard prettying up the scenery. If your setting
is already gorgeous, leave well enough alone.

Considering alternative decorations
If you don’t have a planner and are a DIY type of couple, you can
use the extra room in your suitcase to pack a few rolls of wide
white ribbon. Inexpensive yet pretty, ribbon bows and trailers 
can be used as pew markers, stream from an altar, and be woven
through a trellis. You can buy supplies online from www.
weddingflowersandmore.com or at a local craft-supply store.
At the reception, you aren’t limited to floral centerpieces (or cen-
terpieces at all). But if tables and surroundings look naked without
decoration, consider sprucing things up with these alternatives:
 Light: Stationary and floating candles, candelabra, lanterns,
sparkle lights, and luminaries cast a romantic glow.
 Fruit: Tropical fruit grows in mouth-watering colors. Carve
fruit baskets out of watermelons and fill with pineapples, man-
goes, limes, kiwis, and bananas.
 Paper: Tissue-paper garlands (or beautiful Mexican papel
picado cut-outs) are inexpensive to buy and easy to hang.
 Shells: They’re a natural for beach weddings. In addition to
the real thing, you can also find shell-shaped candles.
 Fabric: Tulle, mesh, swags, and draping go a long way in cov-
ering up spots that are plain or ugly.
 Leaves: Combine leaves in an eye-pleasing pattern or tie
smaller sprays with satin ribbon, arrange them on the tables,
and voilà!
Chapter 12: Before You Go: Putting Your Wedding Plans in Place 211
Floral headpieces and getting lei’d
Some destination couples decide to do away with traditional flowers entirely, opting
for a floral headpiece for the bride in place of a veil or tiara and a lei for the groom
instead of a boutonnière.
These options look and smell great. Just keep in mind that flowers are delicate and
can bruise or turn brown if over-handled. Transport and store yours inside a foam-
padded container with gel ice until you use them.
Remember that brides carry bouquets for a reason: It gives them something to do
with their hands. Women who fidget when nervous may want both a floral head-
piece and a bouquet. (And hey, it’s your wedding. If you want a lei as well, who’s to
argue?)

At hometown weddings, guests often vie to take the centerpieces
when they leave. Because your friends and family are traveling
after the event (and some countries ban the import of foreign plant
material), you’re freer to use uncommon centerpieces with fragile
blooms that needn’t last beyond the reception.
Working with a Photographer
Pictures provide a lasting memory of a wedding. When you’re get-
ting married in a glorious setting, you want a record of it. That’s
why having a reputable photographer is key. Professional photog-
raphers know the most flattering angles and pleasing compositions
to shoot. The pictures won’t be too dark or too light, red-eye will
be banished, and you’ll end up with an album that you enjoy
paging through rather than a pile or file of images that don’t quite
capture the moment. (Friends at a wedding armed with disposable
cameras may be as unlikely to create a masterpiece as monkeys in
a room banging on typewriters.)
To choose a quality photographer far from your home, look for:
 An easy-to-navigate professional Web site for you to preview
her work
 A gallery of photos that reflect a distinctive style (or styles)
 Someone who is easy to reach and accessible by phone or e-mail
 A photographer who doesn’t book more than one wedding 
a day
 A businessperson who is clear about what various photo-
graphic elements cost, and the options available to you
At resorts and on cruise ships that provide photography as part of
a wedding package, you may not have a say in who photographs
your event. But meeting with the photographer in advance is
worth your while so that you can then communicate your prefer-
ences and expectations.
To help prepare your photographer to take the best pictures, supply
him with a timeline and a shot list (including special moments and
people) in advance that states where the two of you can be found
(along with when you don’t want to be found!) during the festivities.
Most good wedding photographers can provide such a list in advance
that allows you to make amendments specific to your wedding.
Because you may be at your destination longer than the hours of
the ceremony and reception, consider bringing your photographer
Part III: Getting the Destination Wedding You Want 
212

in for an extra day so that he can add scenic images and casual
guest pictures to your portfolio.
Whether your wedding photographer is a professional or one of
your guests, keep these things in mind:
 You may not need a shooting schedule if you instruct your
photographer to simply chronicle the natural flow of events.
 You can get creative with portraits by using outdoor settings
and taking plenty of pictures that provide a sense of place.
 Using natural light is ideal (but never shoot facing into the sun).
 Trees or buildings can cast members of the wedding in the
shadows, so try to avoid them.
 If you want pictures of the dress rehearsal, rehearsal dinner,
hellos, and farewells in addition to the ceremony and reception,
prepare to pay more or ask guests to shoot during those events.
 For night weddings, make sure you have more candles than
you need to adequately light the space.
 Think multimedia: In addition to a bound wedding album, ask
about having a wedding CD and slide show (accompanied by
your wedding songs) created.
The Wedding Photojournalist Association (www.wpja.com) can
refer you to photographers who take a photojournalistic approach
to wedding photography and work around the world.
Counting on your guests to take pictures? Pack a portable printer
that reads digital cameras’ memory cards: HP and Canon both
manufacture models that enable users to print out digital photos
on the spot. You can then bring along small, colorful paper frames
or mats, and you have sweet wedding favors.
If you want your video photography to say something, consider a
videographer. A videographer uses a video camera to capture
motion pictures of wedding events. Because paging through a wed-
ding album is much easier than loading a tape into a VCR or a DVD
into a computer or DVD player, many couples decide to forego a
videographer to save money.
If you’re determined to have a video record of the wedding, invest
time screening samples from different video companies. Look for
well-composed, in-focus scenes and listen for clear sound and 
well-edited music that matches the shots. Videographers who use
at least two professional-quality cameras can cover more and yield
a more finished-looking product. In the contract, make sure the
number of copies and format (HD-DVD, Blu-ray Disc, DVD, or VHS)
Chapter 12: Before You Go: Putting Your Wedding Plans in Place 213

is specified. And as you want to do with the photographer, deter-
mine whether you can afford him for a longer period of time to cap-
ture all the fun of your event.
Facing the Music
To have a lively wedding, feature music. Soft music, loud music,
fast music, slow music, dreamy music, dance music: Offer some-
thing to appeal to everyone. After food and drink, music is what
keeps guests from slipping away too early.
Although some destination wedding couples hire live orchestras,
multipiece bands, or DJs, the majority use recorded sound at the
event. At any wedding, music enhances several occasions:
 The rehearsal dinner: Something soft and jazzy works well as
background music so conversations can be heard.
 The prelude: As guests arrive for the ceremony.
 The processional: When the bride, groom, and others in the
wedding party walk down the aisle.
 The recessional: What’s played after the vows are spoken,
and the couple leaves together.
 Cocktail hour: Lively sounds encourage mingling.
 Reception dinner: Music starts low in the background so guests
can converse; as people finish eating, dance music comes on.
At the ceremony, classical music is the norm, but by no means the
rule. If that’s what you’d like to hear and you want prerecorded
sound, search for wedding music on www.amazon.com or iTunes.
You can hear snippets of songs on those sites and buy what suits
your taste. This section helps you find the right music match for
you and your destination wedding, whether you’re having live
musicians or bringing your own playlist.
Hiring musicians
Couples who book a destination resort where music is part of the
ambiance may be treated to anything from a reggae group to a steel
drum band to Hawaiian choristers to Fijian “warriors” chanting sere-
nades. If you buy a wedding package from a resort or hotel, the music
is usually included. If you’re more of a do-it-yourself type of person
and want to be in charge of your music and hiring the musicians,
you can ask the hotel where you’re staying or ask vendors for
recommendations.
Part III: Getting the Destination Wedding You Want 
214

To hire your own band or figure out what to expect from the
house’s, demo their music. Computer users should ask potential
musicians to e-mail MP3 music files to hear a sample. Otherwise,
request cassettes or CDs. As with sampling food, a small taste is
often enough to tell whether or not you like something.
Burning a destination wedding 
CD or creating a playlist
Technology has made it so much cheaper and simpler to have
great music wherever you go. You can save some money and skip
having live musicians or a DJ and bring some CDs or an iPod. To
make sure that you can listen to sounds you love at your wedding,
speak with the coordinator or banquet manager to determine the
kind of sound system available.
Just about every place has a CD player and speakers. To be on the
safe side, plan to bring that format with you. If you want to play a
mix of tunes, you need to use a computer to burn them onto a
custom CD beforehand. Otherwise, use a padded CD-holder to pro-
tect the individual disks you select to pack.
If you want to create a destination wedding playlist on your iPod,
choose music that tells your love story. Whether your taste runs to
modern or traditional, these romantic songs — all with a travel
theme — can get you and your guests out of their seats and onto
the dance floor. The easiest way to catalogue and transport songs
is by creating a playlist in your iPod. To connect your iPod to
speakers, acquire a stereo link cable (under $20). Tune into Table
12-1 for a destination wedding playlist.

Filling Wedding Welcome Bags
Even destination couples who are on the fence about distributing
wedding favors rarely debate about providing welcome bags. A wed-
ding welcome bag (see Figure 12-4) contains a combination of fun,
frivolous, and functional items that you reward friends and family for
coming to celebrate with you. These welcome bags can be either wait-
ing in the room upon a guest’s arrival or delivered shortly thereafter.
Figure 12-4: Treat your guests to a welcome bag that rewards them 
for making the journey.
This section identifies the kind of bags you can buy for these 
welcome bags and what types of items you can insert in them.
Holding it all together
The first thing you need in assembling a welcome bag is the bag
itself. Most couples choose some variation on an open or zippered
tote bag or miniature duffle that can double as a beach or around-
town bag. Small backpacks are a good idea if scenic walks, picnics,
and hikes are on your itinerary.
LL Bean (www.llbean.com) offers more than a dozen inexpensive
totes that can be monogrammed. (Guests will be happier with their
own monograms rather than yours.) As an alternative in the trop-
ics, pick up inexpensive bags at a local straw market.
Don’t choose a bag that is so big it will be difficult for guests to
transport later or that you can only fill halfway (although crum-
pled tissue at the base helps in a pinch).

Adding treats for treasured guests
What belongs in your welcome bags? Items that reflect your loca-
tion and your personal taste plus things that can be useful during
or after group activities. For example:
 Welcome note
 Daily activities program or newsletter (see Chapter 15 for
more info)
 Bottled water
 Local map
 Destination guidebook
 Beach towel
 Snorkel set
 Disposable underwater camera or single-use video camcorder
 Sunscreen and aloe gel
 Casino chips and gaming guide
 Bubble bath
 Candy, crackers, popcorn, or other wrapped treats
 Hangover cure
 Hotel spa gift certificate
 Luggage tags
 Travel candle
 Bottle of local spirits or wine and a corkscrew
Order great-looking hang tags you can customize for welcome 
bags (and bottled water, CDs, wine bottles, and more) at www.
myownlabels.com/weddings.asp.
How much you put in a welcome bag and how much you spend on
the contents is entirely up to you. Even if your budget is small,
though, it’s important to have something for guests to receive
upon arrival that communicates how glad you are to have them
with you.

Chapter 13
Setting the Stage: Your
Ceremony and Reception
In This Chapter
 Designing your destination wedding ceremony
 Weathering the elements
 Readying yourselves for the reception
T
he crowning moment of every wedding is when the bride and
groom stand at the altar to recite their vows. That’s when all
eyes are on you, and you want that moment to be as beautiful and
perfect as possible. This chapter tells you about the major ele-
ments involved in creating such a scene. As you read, you can
decide whether you want to incorporate any of these suggestions. If
so, you can request assistance from your wedding planner, florist,
or the venue directly. You can also find info on your reception.
When you’re having a wedding away, expecting to do major con-
struction without a major budget, an event planner, and a contrac-
tor is impractical. Aside from simple decorations, do-it-yourselfers
may not have much to do, either (this is a wedding, not a barn rais-
ing!). So it’s best to choose a spot that is scenic, or well furnished,
to begin with or one where you have access to vendors who can
create the environment you envision.
Stepping into an Altared State
Prior to setting the stage for your wedding ceremony, you need to
have a clear concept of where you’re hosting it and how its location
impacts the style you choose. Chapter 6 helps you choose the right
destination. Within that destination, your ceremony’s actual setting
is important. The two types of settings are

Part III: Getting the Destination Wedding You Want 
220
 Fixed: Fixed settings tend to be indoors. In fixed settings, such
as chapels, where you stand or kneel is predetermined. Often
you can have a hand in floral arrangements and other décor.
 Adjustable: This type of setting tends to be outdoors.
Adjustable settings such as beach and garden locations,
courtyards and wineries, and outdoor hotel venues may fur-
nish some of the elements that turn a bare space into a cere-
monial one. You need to rent, borrow, or buy everything else.
With an adjustable setting, deciding on both the aesthetics
and the logistics, along with how simple or elaborate you
want the setting to look, is up to you, the on-site coordinator,
or your own wedding or event planner.
Knowing the stage you have to work with is essential before
making decisions about your ceremony’s style and decorations.
After you get a good feel for the type of setting, start thinking
about its potential and consider the pointers in the next sections
about setting the stage the way you want it.
Styling Your Ceremony
Your ceremony is where you express your love for each other in
the presence of all your guests. You want the experience to be
unforgettable for you and everyone else, right?
Before you start to take specific steps to create your ceremony’s
style, keep the following general points in mind so that everyone
enjoys themselves:
 When you have a choice of spots within a location, select the
one with maximum eye appeal. Examples include beside a
waterfall, under a spreading tree, inside a gazebo surrounded
by landscaping, or on a lawn facing the ocean. If the location is
already beautiful, you’ll need to do little to transform it into a
ceremonial space and even less to decorate it.
 Allow the natural beauty of the surroundings draw eyes,
and concentrate more on lighting, acoustics, and guests’
comfort. Inspecting the spot as close to 24 hours in advance
if you can is a good idea; you want to see it at the same time
of day your wedding is scheduled for. At that time, check
to see whether you can be heard. If not, is a quieter spot
available, or should you have a microphone and speakers
set up?

Chapter 13: Setting the Stage: Your Ceremony and Reception 221
 Check to see whether the sun will be in your or your guests’
eyes during your ceremony. You don’t want guests having to
squint and miss what they traveled all this way to witness. A
change of angle or holding the wedding an hour later or ear-
lier can fix that.
If you’re having a hard time envisioning how to decorate, ask the
person in charge of the site if she has photos of previous events
held there. Also, whenever you see an environment you like in a
magazine, tear out the page and keep it in a file. Bring it with you
to use as reference. This section can also help.
Going to the altar
The wedding altar is the sacred space where you speak your vows. It
can be a fixed structure, as in a church, or a piece of furniture, typi-
cally a table, and it may or may not be elevated on a step or tier.
Sometimes the altar is a podium that the officiant stands behind, or
it can simply be the three of you standing amidst a natural setting.
If your setting doesn’t come with a fixed altar, you can do without
one, create a natural one (in Hawaii, couples and the officiant are
sometimes encircled by flower petals on the beach), or arrange to
have a podium or table delivered. Ask a planner for help with the
latter two ideas.
If you decide to use a table altar, it can look small and lonely without
some form of decoration. Although much of the décor can be pro-
vided by the surroundings, you may feel enhancements are still nec-
essary. For example, you can sheathe table legs with white fabric or
in a shade that matches the wedding colors. And if wind is likely to
kick up the table skirt, use double-stick tape to affix fabric to the
legs. (The bride may be tempted to do the same with her gown!)
No matter what kind of altar you use, think of decorations on both
sides of the altar as bookends. By keeping them symmetrical, they
lead peoples’ eyes to the center. Altar enhancements include
 Candles
 Fresh or silk flowers in a vase or basket
 Floral wreaths and garland
 Satin ribbons and bows
 Tulle or fabric table underskirt

Larger decorations and architectural pieces that some florists
make available for rental to enhance the visual effect include
 Candelabra
 Easels to hold artwork or framed photos of the couple
 Pedestals and columns
 Potted plants or topiary
 Tall vases or amphorae (graceful two-handled jars)
Adding arches and aisles
Deciding to include decorative touches like arches and an aisle
runner can instill glamour that a plainer space will benefit from. In
outdoor settings, an altar often is accompanied by an arch, which
acts as a frame to the scene. When a couple passes under it after
the ceremony, it visually symbolizes their emergence as husband
and wife. Arches can be left plain or decorated with garlands, tulle
swags, satin ribbons, or even balloons. 
When you decorate an arch, remember that you don’t want to
draw too much attention away from yourselves. That’s why sheer
fabrics and pale flowers are popular elements.
To add visual interest, you may also want to create a beautiful and
accessible aisle. Ideally, the aisle is wide enough for the maximum
number of wedding party participants who will be walking down it
together without having to squeeze.
An aisle runner — the equivalent of a Hollywood red carpet for the
bridal party — is another decorative option. Keep the following
pointers in mind when choosing a runner:
 Aisle runners can dress up an interior space as long as
safety comes first. Insist that any aisle runner is skid- and
puncture-proof before okaying it (you don’t want high heels
piercing it).
 Aisle runners may be an impediment on outside ground
that’s not perfectly level. If there’s any chance an aisle runner
may tear or trip someone, simply do without one.
Scattering organic materials up to the altar (see Figure 13-1) —
flower petals, pine needles — is preferable, especially ones that
perfume the air. Lining both sides of the aisle with shells is a nice
touch at beach weddings.
Part III: Getting the Destination Wedding You Want 
222

The task of decorating needn’t fall to you; leave it to your florist 
or coordinator to render the arch and aisle according to your 
specifications.
Figure 13-1: A trail of flower petals leads the eye to a simple, symmetrical altar
where the couple is the focus of attention.
Including religious and sentimental
accompaniments
You may be able to customize and enhance your wedding cere-
mony by adding religious and sentimental accompaniments. A few
examples include
 Religious elements: Catholic couples may request a kneeling
bench; Jewish couples adhere to the tradition of breaking a
glass wrapped in a napkin after the ceremony. In any case,
inform the officiant and coordinator of specific requests for
such items ahead of time.
 Your own vows: Chances are, an officiant supplied by a resort
or destination has preset vows he speaks every time he mar-
ries a couple. If you want to add something special to be
recited, let the officiant know, and make clear who is expected
to deliver the additional material.
Go ahead and write your own vows if you like. Just keep in
mind that in some destinations an officiant must follow certain
guidelines about what he must say during the ceremony in
order for the marriage to be legal there. One online resource
where you can get inspiration is www.beliefnet.com./UExp/
Wedding_Ceremony_Search.asp, which is an interactive tool
that suggests vow language for everyone from Zoroastrians to

atheists. Remember to keep to the point. Your guests will appre-
ciate it.
 The unity candle: A thick pillar candle lit by tapers that the
bride and groom hold over its wick is a popular part of some
ceremonies. Because many destination weddings aren’t first
marriages, and one or both members of the couple may have
children already, the merging of the flames serves as a mean-
ingful symbol of two lives and two families becoming one.
Be sure to notify whoever is helping you set up the ceremony
regarding all your specific needs in advance.
Putting Guests at Ease
Long after guests forget what colors you decorated with or how the
chairs at your ceremony were set up, they’ll remember whether
they were uncomfortable. As hosts, part of your job is to ensure
there are no physical hurdles to challenge or frustrate them. This
section helps you make guests’ experience a smooth one.
Guaranteeing easy access for guests
Keep in mind that your guests travel a distance to celebrate with
you, possibly at some physical discomfort, so choosing locations
that are navigable so each person can fully participate in the wed-
ding is essential.
Is there a friend or family member attending who has disability
issues? If so, you must accommodate that person. Explain the situ-
ation to the appropriate staffers in advance so guests with disabili-
ties can have access. Ask pointed questions such as how far is the
walk to the seating area from the hotel or parking lot, and are there
any steps involved or ramps available?
Attending to the bottom line:
Seating for guests
As you strive to make everyone relaxed and comfortable, making
sure your guests are seated comfortably is important. The length
of your ceremony can determine whether you require seating at
all. Provide chairs for any event that will be longer than 20 minutes
or if you have guests who are elderly or suffer from a disability or
illness. If you’re only placing a few chairs, reserve the spots for
guests who need them by putting their names on the chairs.
Part III: Getting the Destination Wedding You Want 
224

Tradition holds that the bride’s family sits on the left and the
groom’s on the right, but you needn’t stick to that, especially if your
gathering is small. At such weddings, arranging chairs or standing
in a circle or semicircle around the altar fosters an intimate feeling.
Everyone needs a restroom
No matter whether you’re marrying on a remote beach, the deck of
a cruise ship, or in a park setting, you want to make sure restroom
facilities are nearby for you, your wedding party, and your guests.
Plan ahead by having your coordinator speak with the facilities
manager so that you can map out the nearest locations. Ushers,
bridesmaids, and anyone else in the wedding party who may be
asked where bathrooms are should be apprised in advance where
to find them.
Chapter 13: Setting the Stage: Your Ceremony and Reception 225
Spicing up your ceremony: 
Rentals checklist
Depending on your requirements and what your site provides, you may need to aug-
ment it with rental items. Use the following checklist to determine what you want to
add:
❑Canopy
❑Candles (table, unity, candelabra)
❑Chairs for guests
❑Table for altar
❑Table linen
❑Tents or umbrellas
❑Stand to hold guest book
❑Gift table
❑Lighting for sunset and evening ceremonies
❑Sound equipment and speakers
❑Heating or air-conditioning units
❑Back-up generator
If you’re dealing directly with a rental house, ask that delivery, setup, breakdown,
and return fees are included in price estimates.

At an outdoor wedding, the restroom may be in a nearby building
or even a portable toilet. Although no one in wedding finery ever
looks forward to having to use a portable bathroom, it’s still better
than nothing. If your ceremony is going to be lengthy and held in a
remote spot, out of consideration make one of these units available
for each 25 guests.
Considering Mother Nature
The weather and other environmental factors can affect your destina-
tion wedding. However, you don’t have to obsess about it. Indoor
spaces, such as heated and air-conditioned chapels, restaurants, and
hotels are safe from all but the most damaging weather. Holding your
ceremony inside means one less thing to worry about. Yet many des-
tination wedding couples still want to marry in a natural setting.
If you’re getting married outdoors, hope for the best, plan for the
worst, and then focus on making your outdoor setting as comfort-
able as possible for your party. That can include offering cool
drinks and handing out fans or umbrellas when temperatures
spike. At small weddings, a nearby gazebo or covered patio or
porch (see Figure 13-2) may provide all the shelter you need.
Figure 13-2: A gazebo like this shelters the wedding party from 
rain yet provides an open-air setting.

Flowers wilt from the heat just like people. Local varieties that can
handle high temperatures and humidity hold up better than hot-
house imports. In any case, keep floral arrangements, bouquets,
boutonnières, and humans in the shade until the ceremony.
In the tropics, you also have to prepare for unwanted pests at your
wedding — and I’m not talking about the brother-in-law you didn’t
want to invite in the first place. For a ceremony that’s bug-free, eco-
sensitive, and nontoxic to humans, place citronella candles around
the perimeter and light them 20 minutes before people are due.
Moving to the Reception
After you’re confident the ceremony space will be decorated to
your satisfaction, you can then focus on the reception area. How
you get there is a logistical issue you need to work out in advance.
Will it be as easy as walking back from the beach at a resort to a
terrace where hors d’oeuvres and cold drinks await? Or do you
need to arrange transportation for everyone? This section covers
how you, the wedding party, and guests get to the reception. It also
looks at the pros and cons of having a break between the service
and reception.
Determining whether you 
need transportation
How you travel from your ceremony to the reception can be partic-
ularly an issue with a wedding away. Most travelers won’t have
cars, so they can’t drive themselves to the reception. However, the
transportation issue doesn’t need to be stressful.
Although it’s traditional for a bride and her dad to travel together
to the ceremony and the bride and groom to travel back from it
later in the same conveyance, as a destination wedding couple, you
aren’t expected to necessarily follow tradition. In fact, you can start
your own or adapt ones from your host country or another roman-
tic spot. For example, the Italian tradition of a processional walking
through the village after the wedding is very charming. It can be
adapted to a group beach walk or garden stroll, depending on your
location. Ever hear of second line? That’s a New Orleans tradition,
where the newlyweds, holding parasols and accompanied by a few
musicians, lead their party through the street to the reception spot.
Chapter 13: Setting the Stage: Your Ceremony and Reception 227

Then there’s the matter of transporting the wedding party and
guests. Hotel shuttles, rented vans, and other multiperson 
conveyances are the most efficient and affordable way to move
numbers of guests from one place to another. For more info on
transportation, flip over to Chapter 11.
Whatever you do, don’t rent a car to drive yourselves to the recep-
tion. That’s what we did. My husband and I got stuck ferrying four
of our relatives around in the 101-degree heat of Las Vegas after
our reception. So our honeymoon had to wait. . . .
Rolling right into the reception
versus taking a breather
At a wedding away, you don’t have to pack the ceremony and
reception into a few short hours — unless you want to. Remaining
in your wedding finery and repairing to a nearby reception area
directly afterwards is certainly convenient. Of course, that may feel
too much like a hometown wedding for you.
As with all aspects of destination weddings, you can’t find hard-
and-fast rules when it comes to deciding whether to have a recep-
tion right away or delay it for a period of time. You get to choose
what makes the two of you happiest and most comfortable. (Come
to think of it, that’s a pretty good rule for your life together.)
Plenty of couples deliberately schedule an early morning (or even a
sunrise) ceremony followed by a quick change of clothes and then a
group adventure, whether it’s a catamaran cruise in the Caribbean or
a horseback riding jaunt through the Rockies (box lunches provided).
Hours later, after everyone’s had time for a nap and a shower, the fes-
tivities heat up at sunset and continue long into the night. Your
reception can be as far from formal as you like. Destination-authentic
parties, such as luaus in Hawaii and reggae receptions in Jamaica,
provide wedding guests with even more reasons to celebrate.
If you decide to go the formal route with a catered dinner, organize
seating arrangements in advance and hand over your seating chart
to your coordinator. And if you need to cut corners or simply
prefer an informal midday meal, you can still reconvene in the
evening at your hotel bar for drinks or gather around a late-night
bonfire on the beach.

Dressing and Grooming for a
Destination Wedding
In This Chapter
 Choosing a formal, semiformal, or informal look
 Discovering beautiful destination wedding attire for brides
 Determining your attendants’ wedding wardrobe
 Deciding what the groom and groomsmen should wear
 Focusing on skin, hair, and makeup
A
s you begin to shop for wedding wear, you quickly find abun-
dant choices — but not all of them are appropriate for a desti-
nation wedding. Your wedding’s location and the logistics of
transporting fancy duds are likely to play a major role in determin-
ing what you wear.
Whether you’re getting married on the beach or a mountaintop, in
a church or a city, you can find clothing and accessories compat-
ible with the setting and the style of your wedding. When they fit
perfectly, convey your vision, and are within budget, you feel and
look wonderful. This chapter helps you select clothing that will be
right for you and for your destination.
Setting Your Dress Code
Before you run out and buy (or rent) wedding garb, consider your
wedding style — which should be inspired by the location and the
type of wedding you want there. Decide from among the three fol-
lowing dress codes for weddings early on:
 Formal: Same as black tie, formal dressing means a tuxedo on
the groom and a long dress on the bride. Most formal weddings
are evening ceremonies or held indoors in a religious location.

 Semiformal: No tux or long dress is required; a suit and party
dress will do. Daytime semiformal events traditionally call for
a suit for him and short dress or good suit for her.
Nighttime semiformal dictates that the groom’s suit is a dark
color and the bride wear a cocktail-length dress. But if you
want to interpret semiformal to mean a traditional wedding
gown for the bride and a dark- or light-colored suit for the
groom, you’ll be dressed in a style that many destination wed-
ding couples are taking to the altar.
 Informal: Open to broad interpretation, informal wedding
wear can range from semiformal to completely casual outfits.
The next section helps you define your own dress code, which will
influence what you and your attendants wear. And as for your
guests, well, unless you specify “formal,” “semiformal,” or “casual”
on the invitations and remind them before they leave, you can
expect them to show up dressed comfortably and informally.
Embracing the bride’s style
Ultimately, one person designates a couple’s destination wedding
style: the bride. Deciding to wear anything from a traditional wed-
ding gown with a cathedral-length train to a sequined bikini top
with a sarong skirt is up to her.
As soon as the bride sets the tone with her choice of dress, the
groom and the rest of the wedding party will have an idea how
formal or casual their outfits should be.
Bearing your budget in mind
How much wedding wear costs depends on the style and fabric of
clothing the bride chooses, its provenance (designer label at a spe-
cialty store versus markdown at a bridal outlet), and how elabo-
rate the dress is. Couples who are pressed for cash but want that
wedding look may even opt to rent clothing for the day.
Considering your destination
Along with the bride’s style and budget, the location of the wed-
ding can strongly influence your wedding’s dress code. If, for exam-
ple, you’re getting married on a cruise ship, you may opt for
something more informal and comfortable compared to if you’re
getting married in a centuries-old cathedral, where formal wear is
appropriate.
Part III: Getting the Destination Wedding You Want 
230

The setting isn’t the only part of the location that matters, how-
ever. Climate also plays a big role. What works in a cool cathedral
won’t do well on a Caribbean beach. No one wants to faint from the
heat. Check out “Considering more than just style: Fabric, color,
and size,” later in this chapter, for more info.
Dressing the Bride
“The bridal dress is the third item in the food chain,” says Mara
Urshel, owner and president of Kleinfeld (www.kleinfeldbridal.
com), the largest bridal emporium of designer merchandise in the
United States and possibly in the world. “First you get the ring,
then you pick the venue, and then you buy the dress.”
Urshel estimates that 25 to 30 percent of her customers intend to
have a destination wedding, and that number “is growing every
day.” “The destinations have expanded,” she adds, “although most
couples choose warm-weather places such as the Caribbean.”
Start looking for bridal attire as soon as you decide on the venue.
Many manufacturers require three to four months to custom make
a dress, and some have even longer lead times. Fittings and alter-
ations can add another one to two months to the process.
Knowing your options
When selected to be worn outdoors under a hot sun, destination
wedding dresses tend to be less formal than traditional wedding
gowns.
More and more destination brides are turning away from heavily
beaded dresses with full ball-gown skirts that brush the floor in
favor of softer and easier-to-pack fabrics, slim silhouettes, strap-
less bodices, and unfussy details. To make a decision you’ll be
happy with, explore your options for bridal attire.
Wedding dresses tend to fall into a few main categories, although
some borrow elements from more than one. See which description
fits you best to determine the look of bridal wear that you’ll feel
most comfortable in. However, you may find something that doesn’t
fit into any of these categories but feels right for you. You can also
refer to Figure 14-1 to see examples of some destination wedding
dresses.
Chapter 14: Dressing and Grooming for a Destination Wedding 231

Figure 14-1: Cool and comfortable bridal wear for a destination wedding.
 Traditional: These wedding dresses are long and white, time-
less and elegant, and very feminine-looking. Think princess
bride. At Kleinfeld, where prices start at $2,500, customers
“want long dresses,” Urshel maintains. “There is something
romantic about running on the sand in a long dress with the
veil blowing in the wind. Imagine the photographs.”
Some brides can imagine a different photograph, one that
depicts the hem of a dress dragging through wet sand or
imprinted with grass stains. For many destination weddings,
dresses with trains, unless they can be detached, are imprac-
tical. An alternative that still provides a long silhouette with-
out too much drag is a trumpet hem, which ends at the top of
the shoe in the front of the dress and extends 4 to 5 inches in
the back.
The more casual a destination wedding dress is, the likelier
the dress will be short. Popular short hemlines are ballerina
length (at the ankle), tea length (8 to 10 inches off the floor),
and above the knee.
 Something nontraditional: Nowhere is it written that a desti-
nation bride must wear a wedding dress, or a dress at all. A
crisp, white poplin pants suit can look chic. A short cocktail
dress in white (or any color that flatters the bride) is a cool,
leg-baring option.

232

On the Web, you can find many sites selling festive and inex-
pensive clothing suitable for a casual wedding. Tropic Bride
(www.tropicbride.com) custom makes tea- and full-length
chiffon dresses in colorful, lightweight tropical prints.
 Beach wear: How daring can you get? Some brides look great
in a midriff-baring, rhinestone-and-pearl bikini top with a long
silk skirt or sarong. Even if you decide to get married wearing
nothing more than a white bikini and flip flops, you won’t be
the first bride to do so. And if you happen to be in the best
shape of your life and the groom thinks it’s a hoot, why not?
Chapter 14: Dressing and Grooming for a Destination Wedding 233
Wearing a dress designed 
for your destination
Destination gowns have become a separate entity in the wedding dress category.
What defines them as destination dresses is that they travel well yet allow the bride
to express her own personality and style. (A bride anywhere may prefer to wear
this look.) Well-known bridal design houses now offer styles specifically created
for destination brides that are lighter, easier to wear, and closer to the body than
formal gowns.
Brands and collections of destination wedding gowns include the following:
 Alfred Angelo’s “Destiny” dresses (www.alfredangelo.com) are lacy, 
feminine designs that are priced to be affordable.
 Demetrios’ “Destination Romance” line (www.demetriosbride.com)
includes many slinky, white, strapless gowns with minimal decoration.
 Amy Michelson (www.amymichelson.com), a California designer whose
fashions are featured at Kleinfeld, also focuses on the destination bride. Her
line features sexy, flowing column and sheath silhouettes.
 Sandals Resorts, which hosts many beach weddings, has its own line of fluid,
modern, and affordable dresses (prices start at around $500) designed with the
Caribbean climate in mind (www.sandalsdresses.com). Dresses are made
of lightweight fabrics and have stretch-knit linings.
 Recently debuted Disney Wedding Dresses are gowns based on Disney
princesses. (See samples at http://honeymoons.about.com/od/
destinationweddingwear/ss/disney_dresses.htm.)

Considering more than just style:
Fabric, color, and size
From the clothing on her back to the shoes on her feet, the materi-
als that a bride wears on her wedding day are far from immaterial.
When selecting the bride’s attire for a wedding away, consider:
 The season and average temperature range of the destination
affects which fabrics are best for a wedding dress. Linen, 
chiffon, tulle, lace, and organza are all lightweight and comfort-
able to wear in warm spots. (If nights get cool, a bride can add
a velvet wrap, pashmina shawl, or bolero jacket.) Taffeta,
velvet, and satin are among the heavier fabrics that keep a
bride warm in cooler climates.
To remain as cool as possible, skip the slip. A slip adds an
extra layer of warmth and weight and may be unnecessary in
a lined dress (satin linings are preferable). Just make sure
your dress isn’t see-through in the sunlight.
 White isn’t always right. When the destination wedding isn’t
the bride’s first trip down the aisle (or even if she thinks white
Part III: Getting the Destination Wedding You Want 
234
Packing and unpacking a wedding dress
Brides who buy a wedding dress from a bridal salon usually receive the finished
item on a hanger in a garment bag. A molded bust form typically fills out the top of
the gown. If the dress isn’t new from the store, a professional dry cleaner can stuff
and pack a gown for travel.
Despite post-9/11 security and carry-on regulation changes, most major airlines still
allow brides to carry their dress aboard and hand it over to a flight attendant to stow
in the coat closet for the duration of the flight. To be on the safe side, call and check
with your airline beforehand.
If it turns out that you need to transport the dress inside a suitcase and your dress
isn’t already salon-packed, you can do it yourself by using generous amounts of
tissue paper to line the case, stuff the bodice, and place between each layer of
fabric and with every fold over.
After you reach your destination, shake out the dress and hang it up. Ideally, you
can find a place that offers professional pressing. If not, your room may have an
iron and ironing board, but use it with caution. If your dress is made of a delicate
fabric, then using a steamer is safer; bring a portable one if your location can’t fur-
nish it. Alternatively, hang the dress in the bathroom, turn on the hot water in the
shower, close the door, and let the hot vapors do their job.

does nothing for her complexion), dresses with color — from
the palest pink to fire-engine red — may be preferred over a
traditional white or ivory wedding dress.
 Wedding gown sizes aren’t sized accurately. In an act of
incomprehensible cruelty, bridal gown sizes are uniformly
inflated. Even a sylph of a size 4 may find herself incapable of
zipping up any dress smaller than a 10. Every bride must deal
with this sizing issue, so don’t be discouraged. So when you
shop for a dress, look for style, not size, and let the sales-
person deal with the number on the tag.
Selecting the right (and left) shoes
Wedding shoes traditionally match the style and shade of the
dress. But when the dress or destination is anything but tradi-
tional, consider where you’ll be walking before deciding what to
wear on your feet.
Just as with your clothing options, your shoe choices for a wed-
ding away are endless. The following tips may help you settle on a
pair you’ll want to dance in all night (Figure 14-2 shows some
examples of footwear for a destination wedding):
Figure 14-2: Select footwear that fits your taste, your style of dress, your loca-
tion, and most importantly, your feet.
 Choosing location-appropriate shoes: If both the ceremony
and reception take place indoors, select footwear that catches
your fancy. Uneven ground outside, however, is a tripping
hazard. When part of the wedding is slated to take place out-
doors on a rugged surface, think about the ground cover
before choosing shoes. Gardens are lovely, but if you’re going
to be walking on grass anywhere, high heels will sink into the
loam, forcing an awkward gait and staining your shoes.
If you have your heart set on wearing a gravity-defying pair of
shoes, ask about having a runner, platform, or moveable floor
installed to level off irregular areas.
 Going barefoot: If you’re getting married on a beach, you may
consider going barefoot. The idea of sinking your toes into the
sand at a beachfront wedding may sound wonderfully sensual.
Chapter 14: Dressing and Grooming for a Destination Wedding 235

Going barefoot isn’t always practical. In fact, you may want to
stamp out the idea because you can run into the following
problems:
• Unless a beach area is thoroughly raked and graded
beforehand, you run the risk of cutting feet on anything
from a sharp seashell to a rusty nail.
• Sand gets hot in the middle of the day. Very hot. If your
wedding is scheduled for noon, the last thing you want
to do is hop from foot to foot throughout the vows
because your soles are afire.
 Toeing the line: Some destination brides favor feminine flat-
heeled shoes over pumps and stilettos. When the wedding
style is informal, wearing sandals or flip-flops to both the cere-
mony and the reception is an increasingly popular option for
brides, grooms, and their attendants.
Sandal-wearers should make appointments for pedicures no
more than a week before the wedding. You don’t want toenails
that look like you can climb the nearest palm tree.
Color is another factor brides can consider when purchasing
footwear. For example, if all-white isn’t all right, you can dye shoes
to match the wedding’s color scheme or the natural surroundings.
Outfitting the Attendants
The bride’s attire sets the tone for what the rest of the wedding
party wears, but the rules may be relaxed at a destination wedding.
Should the bride opt to wear a traditional long gown, attendants’
dresses still may not require a cloned look. As with all weddings, if
the bride asks attendants to purchase special outfits, they are
expected to bear the cost for them.
When trying to determine what the attendants will wear for your
wedding away, these pointers may help:
 Keep attendants’ attire as simple as or simpler than the
bride’s. Short- and tea-length bridesmaid dresses are espe-
cially popular for weddings on location. That means a bride is
likely to find a good selection of such styles to choose from.
Some of these dresses are available in white as well as colors,
so a bride can buy a typical bridesmaid’s dress for herself for
less than she’d pay for a traditional wedding gown.
Part III: Getting the Destination Wedding You Want 
236

 Indulge attendants’ personal tastes . . . to a point. To avoid
an insurrection among female attendants who express definite
opinions on what they will or won’t wear, brides simply can
inform them of the color and fabric to shop for, or encourage
them to pick a style within a collection they find.
David’s Bridal offers a free, interactive Dress Your Wedding tool
(www.davidsbridal.com/dress_your_wedding.jsp) that enables
users to digitally try fashions on the entire bridal party. Another
good resource for colorful, casual, lightweight gear for the entire
wedding party is Island Importer (www.islandimporter.com).
Garbing the Groom and His Men
Traditionally (even in the most untraditional weddings), the
groom’s gear is chosen to match the bride’s. Whether the two of
you decide to take your vows in clothing that is formal, semifor-
mal, or informal, you’ll look best if your clothes are as compatible
as possible, and that includes shoes.
The groomsmen’s choice of attire is then quite simple: They take
their cue from the groom. Groomsmen are expected to wear outfits
that conform to the dress style in the colors the couple request.
For more on picking groomsmen’s outfits and accessories, check
out Wedding Planning For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Marcy Blum
and Laura Fisher Kaiser (Wiley).
This section looks at the different options for clothing the groom at
a wedding away and covers important stuff to consider when
choosing what the groom and groomsmen wear.
Checking out your choices
Because brides have such variety and flexibility in dressing for a
destination wedding, grooms do, too. When deciding on the
groom’s clothing, the following represent some choices. This list
doesn’t cover every single choice but does give you an idea of the
array you have. Refer to Figure 14-3 for some examples.
 Classic: Plenty of destination grooms still don a classic black
tuxedo for the wedding. A white or ivory dinner jacket (when
the bride’s gown is white or ivory), black trousers, and a black
bowtie are equally elegant and appropriate for after-dark 
weddings.
Chapter 14: Dressing and Grooming for a Destination Wedding 237

Figure 14-3: The choices for what a groom wears in a destination wedding are
nearly as diverse as what a bride wears.
 Fashionable alternatives to a tux: Many destination grooms
opt for suitable suits instead of a tuxedo. The nontraditional
style of many destination weddings opens the door for
grooms to be more flexible in their choice of clothing.
Fashion-conscious men who wear designer clothing during
work want wedding wear that reflects the same level of taste.
The following looks can be comfortable and stylish (and if you
choose any of them, you won’t commit a fashion faux pas):
• Navy blue, charcoal, or black tropical wool suit with a
white shirt and dark tie
• Linen or cotton poplin dress suit in beige or another
light color with a white shirt
• Seersucker suit with edgy accessories (see the later 
section on accessories for more info)
• Blue blazer with khakis or light-colored trousers and
crisp white shirt (tie optional)
• Neutral monochromatic outfit with same-color shirt, tie
(optional), jacket, and trousers
Part III: Getting the Destination Wedding You Want 
238

 Tying the knot without wearing a tie: Even at the most infor-
mal destination weddings where they don’t wear a tie, grooms
are still concerned with style. For the ultimate in comfort in
warm-weather destinations, consider these options:
• White linen shirt with dark trousers
• Solid-color shirt with linen, cotton, or raw-silk drawstring
pants
• Neutral-color, natural-fiber Bermuda shorts with a solid-
color shirt
• Bathing trunks to match her bikini (no Speedos, please)
Will wearing shorts on your wedding day still give you a chuckle
when you look back in 20 years, or will you have wished you opted
for a more classic look? Answering that question can help a man
determine how to dress on his wedding day.
Because so many destination weddings take place in hot, tropical
settings, picking clothing that keeps a groom and his backup team
cool and comfortable is important. To ensure that he doesn’t break
into a sweat at the ceremony (at least not from what he’s wearing),
breathable, natural-fiber clothing is best. Natural fabrics don’t trap
sweat like synthetics. Ideal garments are made from linen, cotton,
raw silk, and even lightweight wool.
Accessorizing isn’t just for women
Donning accessories gives the groom and his groomsmen a way to
stand out from the crowd and from each other. Small accents also
help coordinate the men’s clothing with the women’s even further,
making your bridal party look put together (and pretty snazzy, if
you ask me).
According to Steve Davis, vice president of marketing for Jim’s
Formalwear, the accessories men use to outfit their attire are usu-
ally the same as for an at-home wedding. Davis says that many des-
tination wedding couples opt for these accents for men:
 A black tuxedo with sand-colored accessories for a beach
wedding
 Pink or spring-green accessories for a garden wedding
 Accessories that match the bride’s flowers, attendants’
dresses, or the surroundings
Chapter 14: Dressing and Grooming for a Destination Wedding 239

In hot climates, choose an adjustable-back vest rather than a full-
back vest. It’s cooler and more comfortable to wear.
Looking Great on the Big Day
Everyone wants to look their best when they get married, espe-
cially because wedding pictures stick around forever. In the big pic-
ture (as well as wallet-sized ones), hair, skin, and makeup are all
important. So, when you’re tying the knot far from home, you need
to take into account how a change in environment may affect your
skin and hair.
Before you leave, do the prep work. Many couples have facials a
month before the wedding and conscientiously schedule dermatol-
ogist appointments, hair highlights, brow grooming, personal train-
ing, nutrition consultations, teeth whitening, and cosmetic
procedures in anticipation of a day when they know they’ll be pho-
tographed from every angle.
After your arrival, a great way to relax and look refreshed is by
having an individual or couples massage before the main event. No
matter what you do, this section gives you the lowdown on how a
bride and groom can look great on their destination wedding day.
Getting that wedding glow
When you look at your wedding photos years later, you want to see
a happy couple smiling, right? Make sure you prepare beforehand
by following these tips to help you and your skin look its best:
 Use an SPF-15 (or higher) lotion at all times. Couples whose
weddings are set in a sunny climate need to protect them-
selves from the rays, and that includes the days before the
actual ceremony. Because no one wants to walk down the
aisle beet red and tingling with sunburn, pack, use, and fre-
quently apply sunblock before going outside.
 If you sunbathe, do so evenly. Brides who sunbathe before
the wedding need to consider their shoulders. Tan lines don’t
flatter a strapless gown.
 If you don’t sunbathe, you can still add color. Tanning salons
are unhealthy places to get bronzed. Instead, use tinted mois-
turizer, find a sunless tanning product, or opt for salon air-
brushing. Have the last application before you leave home; you
don’t want anything to stain wedding wear. And remember:
Face, neck, and body should all match.
Part III: Getting the Destination Wedding You Want 
240

What if, despite reminders, you’ve been having too much fun to
slather on the sunblock and you got sunburned? Take aspirin and
treat sunburn with cool, nonirritating balms. Anything from mois-
turizer to refrigerated plain yogurt can lessen the sting.
Making up
I made the mistake of using new products on my wedding day; in
fact, I spent more money on cosmetics than on my wedding gown.
Still, those weren’t tears of joy streaming down my cheeks. No, my
eyeballs stung from irritation.
So take it from me: Try out everything you intend to put on your
face long before leaving home. High-def wedding photography and
videography exposes pores and flaws. A cosmetologist can recom-
mend products to minimize them.
Brides who schedule a wedding-day makeup appointment with
attendants should put themselves first on the list; times can get
backed up, and having to wait adds stress. And your wedding day
is no time to experiment. You should also bring along your own
products and ask the makeup artist to use them exclusively.
Chapter 14: Dressing and Grooming for a Destination Wedding 241
Considering renting clothes
Couples who want to deck themselves out formally but experience sticker shock
after pricing wedding gear have the option of renting. Tuxedo rental shops are more
prevalent than those offering gowns. Tuxedo rentals are available in many different
styles. A rental company with locations in all 50 states, Jim’s Formalwear
(www.jimsformalwear.com) also enables customers to order a tux online by
submitting measurements. If the groom and his men have rental tuxedoes, appoint
the most responsible one in the crowd to collect and return them on time after the
wedding to avoid late fees.
If there is a store nearby that rents wedding gowns, a bride-to-be can expect to pay
about 25 percent of the retail cost — as long as she doesn’t tear, permanently stain,
or lose the dress. Before signing a rental agreement, ask about alterations, dry
cleaning, and extra charges if the gown is returned after the deadline.
Should a bride count on renting a dress after she gets to her destination? With the
exception of Las Vegas, which is well-equipped to outfit last-minute couples (quite
hastily), trying to locate a perfect rental gown elsewhere is likely to take too much time.

Consider the following suggestions when you’re choosing makeup
for your big day:
 Use products that don’t require frequent touch-ups.
Waterproof mascara and long-lasting lip color that will look
good in pictures are best. In steamy surroundings, use powder
rather than cream-based eye shadow, and keep translucent
face powder nearby for shine control.
 Consider your surroundings before applying perfume or
cologne. Marrying outdoors in the tropics? Skip the perfume.
Unless trade winds carry them away, insects are attracted by
fragrance.
Keeping your hair apparent
Hair that looks fine at home can rebel in a distant dry or humid cli-
mate. Dry air can attract static, making someone look as if they’ve
stuck a finger in a light socket. Humidity can turn straight hair lank
and curly hair frizzy. So before you leave for the wedding, discuss
with your regular hairstylist what products and treatments to use
to help hair maintain its normal appearance during your travels.
The following tips can ensure you have a good hair day:
 If you have long hair, consider wearing it up. Brides with
long hair find it much cooler to wear an updo, and a pretty
shell hair accessory at a beach wedding extends the theme.
 If you need a haircut before the wedding, do so about two
weeks before the event. That way if the stylist makes a mis-
take, you still have a little time for it to grow back in.
 Hold hometown style tryouts even if you’re planning to
have wedding-day hair styled by a new, on-site beautician.
Photograph the styles you like best and show them to your
on-site stylist so he can recreate the look.

ferent hairstyles, join www.thehairstyler.com. By uploading a

 Taking care of last-minute tasks
 Making time for yourselves
 Greeting and entertaining your guests
T
he moment you reach your destination, the prospect of getting
married starts to feel real and very exciting. Whether you have
a lot of work to do before guests arrive or plenty of time for fun,
walking through the event both physically and mentally is a good
idea.
What can you do to prepare for the main event? The list may seem
endless, but don’t worry. If you can visit key locations — sample a
guest room, look at the rehearsal dinner location, and see the cere-
mony space and reception area — you’ll have the main tasks cov-
ered. Introduce yourselves as you go, and let staff members in
these places know how much you’re looking forward to having
them be a part of your wedding.
Fortunately, many destination weddings are turnkey affairs where
everything you need is assembled for you so you may not have to
do much checking or choosing. Couples having more-elaborate
weddings normally have a coordinator to supervise the details.
Still, you’re bound to have some details to oversee, if only to put
your mind at ease. This chapter offers suggestions for the produc-
tive and fun ways to spend the time before your wedding.
Finalizing All the Details On-Site
Whether you’re on your own, have a planner in tow, or a mother
hen is clucking around you, you still have tasks on your to-do list.

Are you wondering where to start with this list after you arrive at
your destination? This section covers the major details to finalize
so that everything goes as hoped.
Acquiring a marriage license
Step one in getting a license — familiarizing yourselves with the
requirements to make sure you can get legally married — needs to
be done long before you leave home (see Chapter 6 for back-
ground). Arriving with proper paperwork and ready to meet those
requirements, your first order of business — the one all others
depend on — is obtaining the marriage license. On-site wedding
coordinators at resorts typically help couples deal with the paper-
work, and some escort them to the license facility.
Places that issue marriage licenses and hotel zones aren’t always in
proximity to one another. If you’re going on your own, ask the clerk
at your hotel’s front desk to recommend the best way to reach the
issuing office. Don’t forget to check its hours (and days) of operation
and get the address. And find out before you go whether you need
to pay with local currency and how much the license costs.
Doing the front-desk drill
Before guests arrive, visit the concierge or hotel manager to go
over last-minute details. If the property has an on-site wedding
coordinator, connect with her first; some of these responsibilities
can be borne by her. Whether you’re on your own or she lends a
hand, the to-do list will likely include most of the following:
 Provide your credit card. Allow the clerk to take an imprint.
Give clear instructions on who may charge to your account
and what expenses should be billed to guests. Specify a cut-off
date after which only the two of you are allowed to charge.
 Confirm guest rooms. Double-check not just the number but
also the location. At larger resorts, having your party’s rooms
clustered on the same floor or wing is preferable. Also check
on any handicap-accessible rooms you may have reserved;
make sure they’re available, close to an elevator, and have the
necessary facilities.
 Double-check rehearsal dinner plans. Confirm the time your
party will arrive at the dinner and the number of people
attending. If you’ve requested a private room or special menu,
remind your contact. And if you’re planning an informal out-
door event such as a luau, clambake, or barbecue, check the
weather report in case you need to make adjustments.

Chapter 15: After You Arrive: Leading Up to the Big Day 247
 Book excursions. Want to take the gang on a sunset cruise or
a jeep tour of the surroundings? (Check out the section
“Promoting Activities to Keep Everyone Busy,” later in this
chapter, for some ideas.) If you haven’t made reservations in
advance, visit your hotel’s activities desk now. If the hotel
doesn’t offer activities, ask the front desk clerk who provides
such services.
 Set up transportation. Do you need rides to the rehearsal
dinner venue? From the ceremony to the reception and back?
Airport pickup and delivery? Tours? Book it all at once to save
time. (Refer to Chapter 11 for more on transportation concerns.)
Inspecting your ceremony space
Are you seeing your ceremony space for the first time, or do you
need to choose between a few potential sites? Take a good look
around. Ask yourself the following types of questions:
 Is the site as private as you would like? Or is it accessible to
public traffic and views? If so, you may be able to mark off the
space with temporary stanchions or screens, which have to be
rented, delivered, and retrieved after the ceremony. Consult
with the facilities manager or your planner for guidance.
 Is the site groomed and trash-free? Focus on cleanliness
during your walk-through of the ceremony and reception areas.
If not, ask the property manager when they plan on tidying up.
Also discuss with the planner or facilities manager how you want
seating set up, the proximity of nearby restrooms, where guests
can retreat for shade if needed, the time that decorations will be
delivered and in place, and whether you must abide by any sound,
curfew, or photography restrictions.
If you’re hoping to have a confetti-like send-off, make sure guests
will be supplied with birdseed, rice, butterflies, blossoms, jars of
soap bubbles, or the projectiles of your choice. An attendant or
planner can assist with this.
Rehearsing with or without 
your officiant
Resorts that host many weddings often have an officiant they regu-
larly call upon. He may or may not be available to be a part of your
rehearsal. If he’s not around, the on-site coordinator or a local
planner can put your group through its paces.

Before your rehearsal, be sure to give your crew a few repetitions
of the time and place to meet for the rehearsal, but don’t expect
military precision after they’re in vacation mode. (In fact, it’s not
unusual for at least one member of the wedding party who’s hung
over from having too much fun to blow off the rehearsal entirely.)
During the rehearsal, you can handle these tasks:
 Confirm whether you need witnesses. If so, recruit guests or
attendants, or round up staff members who are willing to sign
your wedding certificate.
 Reiterate requests to personalize the ceremony with the
officiant. If you want to use your own spoken vows, a poem,
music, include the lighting of candles, or ask to have a few
words said to honor people who aren’t with you, make sure
you share this info with the officiant so she can plan on incor-
porating them into the service.
Even if the officiant isn’t at your rehearsal, and you can’t
speak to her in advance to put in requests, you’ll still have a
chance to meet her before the actual ceremony, if only very
briefly. Talk to her at that time.
At even the most casual rehearsal, you still ought to make sure the
person leading the rehearsal accomplishes the following:
 Makes sure the wedding party knows when to walk in and
walk out and where to stand.
 Goes over the schedule for the day of the ceremony.
 Reminds you to double-check that you have the right shoes.
At a beach wedding, it’s better to wear flats or even flip-flops
than struggle with high heels.
If you purchased a wedding package, you need not pay the officiant
(although tips are usually appreciated). However, if you didn’t buy a
package, officiants are normally compensated for their services by a
donation from the groom or a designated member of his team.
Amounts vary from $50 to $500, usually depending on the size of the
wedding. Officiants also should be compensated for travel expenses.
Readying for the reception
Key elements to every successful reception are intelligent seating,
pleasant décor, tasty food, and entertainment that guests appreciate.
Ideally, you’ve organized all these details before you left home.
(Check out Chapter 12 to make sure your reception is planned
accordingly.)
Part IV: Sharing the Joy at Your Wedding, Now and Later 
248

When refining your choices, use this time for the following:
 Check your seating chart. If your party is large and you have
a seating chart, how does it work in the actual room?
Anything from the location of windows and air conditioners to
the proximity of tables from the music or food to the two
guests who just stopped speaking to one another, may inspire
you to tweak the chart.
 Inspect and approve table settings. If you’ve selected specific
colors, are you happy after seeing them in person? Reception
halls may have a stock of table linens in standard colors.
Should all else fail, switch to all white — you can’t go wrong
with that.
 Taste what’s on your menu, remind the staff if you or your
guests have any dietary restrictions, and check on the wed-
ding cake. Obviously you can’t taste your actual cake in
advance, but the baker could provide you with a sample of
the cake and frosting. When you contact her, make sure to
remind her of the delivery time for the cake and who will
receive it.
If your time on the ground is limited, or you simply don’t have the
inclination to sweat every detail, you may not end up overseeing
these decisions. If that’s one of the reasons you decided to have a
destination wedding in the first place, then just go with the flow.
Focusing on perfect pictures
You want photos that you can look at and recall how wonderful
your wedding was, right? After you arrive, devote a little time to
address photography issues. Some destination wedding couples
don’t get to see their venue until they arrive for the wedding. In
those instances, decisions about photography and videography
may need to be made on the spot. Either the coordinator or a
member of the wedding party can take on the responsibility of com-
municating with the lensmen, making sure they know the VIPs who
need to be photographed. (Check out Chapter 12 for more info.)
Watching the Webcam
If your facility guaranteed Webcam coverage of your wedding, now
is a good time to investigate the setup. (A Webcam is a camera that
captures images and sends them over the Internet in real time;
refer to Chapter 17 for info on Webcams at weddings.)
Chapter 15: After You Arrive: Leading Up to the Big Day 249

1. Ask at the facility whether a human operates the Webcam
or whether it’s attached to a fixed place, such as a wall or
beam, and is trained on the spot where the couple is
expected to stand.
2. Depending on the answer, verify the camera is positioned
correctly.
If a human is behind the controls, you can request that cer-
tain people and parts of the ceremony are covered the way
you want. You can also request that the cam operator focus
on your best angles.
If the Webcam is in a fixed position, here’s what to do: Use
a stand-in to preview the angle of the camera frame. That
way, you know what mark to hit, or you can adjust your
wedding party’s positions until you approve of the view.
3. Confirm how the video of the event will be archived and
ask for a copy.
Because you’re the stars of the live Webcam show, you’ll
certainly want to view it afterward, so ask the operator
about your archiving options. You may be able to arrange
for the facility to e-mail the broadcast to you as a
RealPlayer or QuickTime file or burn it onto a CD or DVD so
that you have a permanent copy.
Via e-mail, notify friends and family of the hour your wedding will
take place (take time differences into account) and include the
Web address where they can view it live.
Surveying the small details
Lesser details, especially ones that show your taste and personali-
ties, are what make your wedding a real reflection of who you are.
You can do the following tasks yourselves, ask one of your atten-
dants to help out, or hand them off to your wedding planner:
 Music: Using the house band? Make sure they know your
favorite songs. If you’re supplying your own CDs or MP3
player for the ceremony and/or reception, deliver them to the
person in charge with a written note describing what’s on the
playlist and the order you want followed. And don’t forget to
stress what you want to hear for your first dance. See Chapter
12 for a great destination wedding playlist.
If bringing a homemade CD, test the CD on the equipment
beforehand. Don’t hand over your CDs to anyone without first
clearly marking at which point in the wedding each disc and
selection is to be played. Write instructions directly onto the
Part IV: Sharing the Joy at Your Wedding, Now and Later 
250

CD with a marker and provide a detailed schedule of events to
the person you put charge of the music.
 Hair and makeup: Has the bride booked salon time for herself
at a salon on or off the premises? Confirm it, along with trans-
portation, if needed. If your whole group is getting beautified,
make sure the bride goes first.
 Flowers: Sometimes couples don’t choose flowers until the
last minute because that’s when they find out what’s in season
and in stock. View sample arrangements, make your choices,
and confirm prices, quantity (if centerpieces are needed), and
delivery time. (Check out Chapter 12 for more info.)
 Wedding rings: Were you hoping to buy your rings at your des-
tination? If so, purchase from an established jeweler who gives
you a money-back guarantee, and hold on to the receipt. Keep
the rings on you, with a trusted guest, or locked in the room
safe until the wedding. If your room doesn’t have a safe, ask the
front desk to store the rings in the hotel’s safe. Get a receipt.
 Wherever bag: Because unexpected things can happen at a
wedding, especially a wedding away, having a fix-all bag
nearby is a good idea. Pack the following items and keep the
bag nearby at the ceremony: water, tissues, safety pins/sewing
kit, tampons, deodorant, comb, toothpaste and brush, floss,
mints, aspirin, and local currency.
Scheduling Time for Yourselves
As the wedding gets closer, you may start to feel tension build. That’s
natural. But you also owe it to yourself and your partner to make the
effort to stay calm. Trust the people you’ve chosen — your atten-
dants, the officiant, vendors, the people at your facility — to rise to
the occasion and do their jobs. For better or worse, they will.
The following activities can help you to relax and de-stress:
 Exercise. Go for a walk, a run, or a swim, or use the gym in
your hotel.
 Get massages. Arrange in-room or in-spa treatments by set-
ting up an appointment with the hotel spa.
 Take a drive. Don’t have a car? Hire a cab by negotiating an
hourly rate, and explore your surroundings.
 Start on thank-you notes. Addressing envelopes can be a per-
fect task because it requires concentration without taxing the
brain.
Chapter 15: After You Arrive: Leading Up to the Big Day 251

 Reflect on your love. You’re on the cusp of a great life change
together; the time is perfect to express what you value and
love in one another.
Later, after your quality time alone together, you’ll feel refreshed
and ready to meet your guests as they arrive.
Welcoming Guests (And Keeping
Them Out of Your Hair)
Although travel sounds glamorous, it can be grueling and expen-
sive. Your guests may have come a long distance to celebrate with
you, and they most likely want to unpack and freshen up. They
also want to feel welcomed and get their bearings. This section
explains how you can make guests feel welcome and keep them
occupied without blowing them off.
Ideally, you or someone from your wedding party can be present to
greet and help orient arrivals. Otherwise, alert the front desk as to
who is expected. Ask that your friends and family members be
shown to their rooms quickly.
Appointing a second-in-command
You can’t do it all — nor should you. Having a second-in-command
who can meet and greet guests when they arrive can give you more
time to wrap up last-minute details and relax before the ceremony.
You can call on anyone who you trust and is reliable. Ask one of
the dads, moms, the maid of honor, or a close friend who is quali-
fied to be your proxy. That person can keep their eyes on things,
hold onto your valuables, and communicate your wishes with the
photographer or musicians. If you have a wedding coordinator, you
can also lean on her.
Arranging a hospitality suite
Consider booking a hospitality suite at your hotel for guests to
gather in. The advantage of these spaces — usually a meeting room
or empty guestroom — is that friends and family have a central
place to gather, mingle, and leave messages. If yours are staying at
multiple hotels, such a spot can be especially useful.
Part IV: Sharing the Joy at Your Wedding, Now and Later 
252

Normally refreshments such as cold sodas, bottled water, and
cookies and brownies are furnished. You can order healthier items
and specialties by making arrangements with room service or the
banquet staff.
Notifying guests of optional 
and required events
Deciding how loose or structured you want the wedding weekend
to be, and which events require optional or mandatory attendance,
is up to you. (See the section “Promoting Activities to Keep
Everyone Busy,” later in this chapter, for activity ideas.) What you
need to do is make sure your guests are informed about the events.
To keep everyone in the loop, provide an itinerary in your wedding
newsletter (see Figure 15-1). A wedding newsletter is a document
with an agenda that’s typically included in a guest’s welcome bag
or separately delivered to their room. Leave extra copies in the
hospitality suite (see preceding section) and at the front desk so
guests are never at a loss for what to do or where to find you.
Figure 15-1: A sample wedding guest newsletter.
Giving gifts and thanks
It’s customary for the bride and groom to receive wedding gifts.
And it’s also customary at a destination wedding for the couple to
give gifts to each other, to their attendants, to their parents, and

We’re thrilled you could 
join us this weekend in 
Mexico. One of the 
reasons we chose 
Mexico was because we 
liked the idea that there 
was something for 
everyone here. 
On our first visit, back in 
November, we fell in love 
with this place – and we 
thought that you would, 
too.  If this is your first 
time, or you haven’t 
visited in a while, you 
should definitely check 
out the beach.
 
Also swim with the 
dolphins and enjoy a 
Piñata.  Just don’t forget 
to come to our wedding!   
You know us:  We like 
to eat! And there are so 
many great places to  
do just that here (not to 
mention room service). 
Mike’s folks are hosting 
the Friday night cocktails 
and rehearsal dinner. 
Sunday night is on us. 
Between then, when 
Amanda & Mike (we’re in the Honeymoon Suite x 3728) • Front Desk 10 • Hospitality 12 • Maid of Honor

you get hungry, these 
are some of the places 
you might want to hit: 
 
Blue Bar & Grill –

sun, you can do it here.
WATER SPORTS
Check in at the Guest 
Services Desk on the lower 
level if you need equipment 
or  instruction in:
• Snorkeling
• Hobie cats
• Windsurfers
• Parasailing
• Water skiing
ON LAND
• Yoga (9am daily in fitness center)
• Tennis (4 lit courts)
• Golf (your first round is on us!)
We realize that your trip 
here is part vacation, 
part celebration.
 
On Saturday morning we 
have two events planned, 
but attendance is strictly 
optional.
Basketball Event
Join Mike, Bill, and the 
rest of the guys (and 
girls) to shoot hoops 
and shoot the breeze, 
starting at 10 am at the 
Sports Center. 
Spa/Salon Event
Or join Amanda, Laura, 
and the moms at the 
Spa at 11am for 
mani-pedis, makeup, and 
a light spa lunch.
Wonder what’s nearby? We did some scouting around for you, and think these 
are a few of the things worth exploring:
The Market — This is a short walk from the hotel. Turn right outside the 
entrance gate, and walk for about 5 minutes, staying to the right. You can’t miss it. 
And be sure to haggle: Offer 50% of the asking price to start!
The Aquarium — Some weird looking fish definitely live in these waters! And 
the eels… yikes! Catch a cab outside the hotel to get here ($10 with tip). The 
Aquarium is down by the waterfront, and you can buy a shaved ice outside and 
walk along the beach afterwards.
Best Beach — The locals say Paradise Beach is the best beach around. We liked 
it because it has secluded coves. To get here, you’ll need to take a cab – just make 
sure that you tell the driver to come back to get you later. Otherwise, you may 
have to wait a while for one to show up. Or catch the local bus (50 cents)  back 
to the hotel.
Dutyfree Shopping — Most of the stores are clustered around King Street 
downtown (either take a cab or use the hotel shuttle). A ton of jewelry stores, 
plus lots that sell perfumes and cameras. We didn’t think the prices were great, 
but you might be able to haggle your way into a deal if you show a 
take-it-or-leave-it attitude.
Hotel Facilities
Chapter 15: After You Arrive: Leading Up to the Big Day 253

even to guests. (Check out Chapter 16 about gift-giving etiquette.)
So when do you hand out the goods? This section gives you the
scoop.
Guest welcome bags
When your guests arrive, have welcome bags ready for them.
(Chapter 12 deals with selecting appropriate contents.) If you’ve
planned well, you’ve already shipped the bulk of the goodies and
the bags to contain them.
Your coordinator or attendants can handle filling guest bags. If nei-
ther is available, offer to compensate staff members to help. It’s
best to work at a long table in a room that can be locked. Line up
bags, followed by items in the order they need to be placed inside.
Use paper (or real luggage) tags to identify the guest and room
number for each bag delivery. After the welcome bags are packed
and labeled, you can arrange delivery with the bell or service desk.
Wedding-party gifts
If you’ve brought a gift meant to be used at the wedding, such as a
fine new watch for the groom, pearl earrings for the bride, silver
bracelets for the bridesmaids, or money clips for the groomsmen,
distribute them before the wedding so they can use them at the
ceremony. A good time to distribute gifts is at the rehearsal dinner
or any other occasion before the wedding when attendants are
present — as long as everyone receives something.
Promoting Activities to 
Keep Everyone Busy
Scheduling group events helps guests bond before the wedding. If
you have a crowd that’s up for just about anything, suggest a vari-
ety of events and then allow things to take their course.
Weekend wedding activities that involve physical activities are
especially good at getting guests to relax, have fun, and interact.
Beach volleyball games and team events like scavenger hunts and
destination wedding “Olympics” with a series of competitions
(with gag prizes for winners) are usually a blast.
Adventures that the two of you participate in with your guests —
group kayaking trips, shopping expeditions, winery tours — are
bound to become memorable experiences for all. So you definitely
should set up at least one or two such events. Realize that differ-
ences in age, interests, and energy levels may cause guests to split
Part IV: Sharing the Joy at Your Wedding, Now and Later 
254

into smaller groups. This section provides some ideas to keep
everyone busy.
Who pays for these extra activities? No strict rules here. But in
general, picking up the cost of group activities that at least one of
you attends is good form. Individual guests usually bear the cost of
sports and activities they pursue on their own. (Check out Chapter
4 for more info on what guests are responsible for.)
Having fun with the guys
When pre-wedding tension mounts, the sexes may prefer different
ways to let off steam. Guys appreciate having an activity to burn
off energy. Rigorous land and water sports are a good idea.
Horseback riding, paintball, snorkeling, golf, and windsurfing may
be options. Check with your hotel’s activities desk for ideas.
Scheduling spa sessions for the gals
Females who prefer pampering, a massage, facial, body wrap, or
hydrotherapy treatment can leach away stress in a spa. Some facili-
ties also offer yoga and meditation classes. These activities are
always more fun when you do them together (and a couple of guys
come along)!
Whether or not you’re picking up the bill for salon and spa visits,
request in advance that a group discount price be applied to the
cost of services for your guests.
Individual pursuits
If your guest list consists of individualists, suggest ways for them
to entertain themselves while you attend to wedding business (or
slip off to join them).
Present activity options in your newsletter or include brochures
with details in the welcome bag. You’ll also want to inform guests
about who to talk to in order to get more info or make arrange-
ments. Because this is free time for your guests, you aren’t respon-
sible for doing the planning.
Your friends, the individualists, can be inspired to participate in
 Activities for early risers: Your hotel may schedule a morning
hike or personal training session; sometimes these activities
are posted in the lobby.
Chapter 15: After You Arrive: Leading Up to the Big Day 255

 Sports: Snorkeling excursions and golf and tennis tourna-
ments are good ways for sports enthusiasts to dive into the
action.
 Zip-lining: Whizzing from treetop to treetop platform while
securely rigged to a zipline is thrilling in tropical jungle areas.
 Reaching for the sky: Flight-seeing and sunrise champagne
balloon flights are pricey but unforgettable experiences.
For cultured guests, the following activities may be fun:
 Guided tour: Historic sites, museums, and landmarks are a
big draw.
 Tastings: Propose a sampling at a local winery.
Laid-back guests may enjoy these types of activities:
 Cooking class: If one of the chefs on staff at your hotel appre-
ciates an audience, you may be able to press him into service
to share the secrets of his specialty.
 Shopping expedition: Have the concierge or front desk pro-
vide directions and arrange transportation to the local market
or shopping area if it isn’t within walking distance.
 Cruise to nowhere: Some resorts have boats that ferry guests
to nearby islands to swim and sun. Let your group know
where they can sign up and get a picnic lunch.
Late-night lovers can have fun doing the following:
 Take a gamble. Las Vegas, many islands in the Caribbean, and
several European capitals have casinos (for more on these
locations, see Part II). Texas Hold’Em poker is an increasingly
popular game where lots of people can fit around a table. So
ask the casino manager whether a dealer can give your group
instruction. And don’t forget the Cuban cigars: Outside the
United States, they’re perfectly legal to smoke.
 Make music. No live professionals around? Find out where to
rent a karaoke machine. Or hire a local band and hand out
extra tambourines, bongos, and other music-makers for an
outdoor concert. Otherwise just kick back and enjoy the
music the pros make.
 Create sparks. Send guests off after evening meals with
lanterns or sparklers, build a beach bonfire, or even arrange
for fireworks.

Minding Your Manners:
Destination Wedding
Etiquette
In This Chapter
 Being on your best behavior
 Dealing with guests
 Celebrating with bridal showers and pre-wedding parties
 Taking on the responsibility of the destination wedding hosts
 Knowing who and how much to tip
 Giving and receiving gifts
 Handling bad behavior at your destination wedding
W
hether it’s the fancy new clothing you’re wearing, the
scrutiny of family and friends who have traveled to cele-
brate with you, or just the disorientation of being away from home,
something about destination weddings makes a couple wonder
whether behavior that they’ve considered perfectly acceptable all
along suddenly isn’t good enough for such a special occasion.
Although certain rules of behavior are best left unchallenged (no
matter what, tell the bride she looks beautiful, no fighting in the
aisle, and send a timely thank-you note for every gift), destination
weddings tend to be more informal than those at home, so the rules
are more flexible. Because destination weddings are still a fairly
new phenomenon, there are few set-in-stone ways to behave. That
said, you’re the hosts of this event, and as such it’s part of your
responsibility to make sure your guests are comfortable and don’t
regret the time, effort, and money they spend traveling on your
behalf. This chapter focuses on some of the major issues that arise
around a destination wedding and smart ways to handle them.

Inviting Guests but Not Disaster
One of the touchiest topics in planning any wedding is deciding
who to invite. For a destination wedding, it’s a little different,
which can work to your advantage. In fact, crowd control is one
reason couples opt for a destination wedding (for more reasons,
see Chapter 2).
Most people perceive destination weddings as smaller events, lim-
ited to your nearest and dearest, so they understand that your
guest list is limited. Most people also realize travel expenses are
involved. So you need not mask your excitement at work: Your co-
workers aren’t likely to expect an invitation.
However, most people isn’t all people. Inviting guests (or uninviting
them) can become an exhausting task — if you let it. This section
explains how to handle uninvited guests, how to persuade guests
to leave the kids at home, and how to deal with guests who can’t
afford to come. (Chapter 12 takes a closer look at creating the invi-
tations and figuring out who to invite.)
Dealing with unwanted guests
An unwanted guest may be your partner’s ex, an obnoxious uncle,
or the best friend from childhood that you no longer have anything
in common with. For whatever reason, you can’t imagine hosting
this person at your wedding. An unwanted guest can also be some-
one you genuinely like but aren’t close enough with to want to
spend a significant amount of time together.
What to do? The simple answer is, don’t invite him or her. If you’re
footing the bill for the wedding, that should put an end to the dis-
cussion. However, if your parents are helping to fund it and insist
on Aunt Buzzkill coming along, put your foot down: Your destina-
tion wedding isn’t an event that will be over in five hours. It’s more
like going on vacation with someone. If you explain it that way, it’s
likely you can keep unwanted guests off your list.
What if someone who hasn’t been invited to your wedding rudely
confronts you with “I’ve always wanted to see Jamaica (or Italy or
wherever) and this will be the perfect time!”? Or even politely asks
whether they can come? Rather than make apologies, inform the
person that your guest list is set and the travel arrangements have
been completed. If they press the issue, politely but firmly stick to
your guns. Ask your significant other for backup if you feel you
need it. But keep your eyes on the prize: This is your wedding, and
you deserve to have it your way.

Chapter 16: Minding Your Manners: Destination Wedding Etiquette 259
Confession: When we got married, we wanted to keep it small, and
we hoped that certain people wouldn’t make it to our wedding. As
we anticipated, choosing Las Vegas as our destination successfully
kept them on the East Coast, far from our celebration.
A difficult decision to make for any wedding, but especially a desti-
nation wedding, is whether or not to include that “and Guest” on
the envelope of your single friends’ and family members’ invita-
tions. Try to remember that not all your single friends will be com-
fortable traveling alone. Because most hotels charge the same rate
for a single or double room, let those friends know it’s fine to bring
a plus-one if you can afford to host the companion at your recep-
tion and related events. But what if you aren’t crazy about your
friend’s “plus one?” Then you have to take a calculated risk: Invite
the friend alone, and realize that she may not want to travel by her-
self and may decide not to attend.
How to graciously not invite kids
Allowing children at a hometown wedding is somewhat common;
parents can easily remove rambunctious ones from a chapel or a
reception to prevent them from disturbing the event and take them
home if necessary. But when a family is hundreds or thousands of
miles away from home at a destination wedding and kids get sick
or act out, it’s not so easy.
If you have children of your own or know others that you couldn’t
imagine a wedding being complete without, by all means include
them. However, if you decide you’d rather not have children pres-
ent, that’s your prerogative. Because keeping children off your
guest list can be a touchy issue, a couple needs to handle it diplo-
matically, so apply the same rules to everyone.
In the past, it was considered bad manners to include a line on an
invitation such as “Adults only, please.” However, I wouldn’t trust
anything as subtle as not including “and family” on the envelope to
get the message across these days. By being straightforward and
apprising guests of your decision in advance, you allow parents
who want to attend ample time to make babysitting arrangements.
Addressing guests who want 
to come but can’t afford to
Send an invitation to everyone you want at your wedding, even if you
know they may not be able to attend. If it’s a matter of cost and you

can afford to subsidize someone’s travel, let him know how important
he is to you and offer to help. For more about this, see Chapter 17.
If that person declines to come, let him know whether he has other
options to celebrate with you, whether it’s watching your wedding
on a Webcam (read Chapter 3 for more on this) or attending an at-
home reception planned after your return.
Holding Showers and Other 
Pre-Wedding Celebrations
Destination brides- and grooms-to-be who are planning a small,
out-of-town affair may wonder whether they’re entitled to the tradi-
tional parties that surround weddings held closer to home. Will
friends and family members who either weren’t invited to the wed-
ding or can’t attend resent having to participate beforehand?
You have one way to find out: Ask. You may be surprised to find
out that although everyone in your circle won’t be at the wedding,
most still would be glad to celebrate with you beforehand.
Your wedding may be small but 
your shower doesn’t have to be
Typically the responsibility of arranging the bridal shower falls to
the maid of honor. Have her contact key people (your friends and
family) to see how they feel about coming to a party.
If your wedding is going to be so small that you don’t have atten-
dants, then a close friend may be willing to host your shower. (It’s
considered bad form for a family member to do so because that
can be interpreted as shilling for gifts.) And just because your wed-
ding will be small doesn’t mean you have to limit the number of
guests invited to your shower.
To make it clear that your bridal shower isn’t a ploy to extract gifts
from people who won’t be attending your wedding, you can ask
whoever is sending invitations to include a line such as “Your pres-
ence — but not your presents — is requested.”
At my bridal shower, which I asked a friend to hold in her apartment,
none of the women who came were invited to my tiny wedding. (And
most of them were relieved I didn’t expect them to travel to Las
Vegas for the event!) Yet they graciously sent me off in style.

Bachelor and bachelorette parties
Bachelor and bachelorette parties have become a rite of passage, a
night (or weekend) of revelry that marks your transition from sin-
glehood to marriage. Typically no gifts are exchanged at these
events, so even less pressure is on guests.
Although it’s acceptable to have a bachelor or bachelorette party
at your destination wedding location, it’s a better idea to do the
celebrating before you leave. That way, people need not spend
more time away, and the pre-wedding event won’t overshadow the
main one. Plus, you can include friends from home who aren’t
attending the wedding.
If you decide to have it on-site, avoid scheduling it for the night
before the wedding. The last thing you want to be is hung over when
you stand up to get married. Instead, plan your pre-wedding blast
around an activity, whether it’s on the slopes, at sea, or at a spa.
Playing the Host
In addition to the myriad details and concerns you have about
your own role as bride or groom, you’re also the co-host of your
destination wedding event. The most important responsibility as
host is taking steps to put guests at ease from the time the first
ones arrive until you leave for your honeymoon.
You want friends and family to have a wonderful time, so take time
to consider each guest’s comfort level and what you can do to
keep it high. A few things to focus on to make your guests feel wel-
come and comfortable include the following:
 Provide full details about traveling to the destination well in
advance, plus contact numbers to call for questions.
 E-mail an annotated guest list a week or so before the event
(for example: Jen Smith, my college roommate; Mark
Goodstein, our first boss at the company where we met).
 Make introductions after guests arrive. Although you know
everyone, they may not.
 Distribute an agenda that informs guests when and where
they need to be during their stay so they don’t miss the main
event or any fun activities.
 Place in their rooms a fun and practical welcome bag (find
ideas to fill it in Chapter 12) with a copy of your agenda.
Chapter 16: Minding Your Manners: Destination Wedding Etiquette 261

The job as greeter need not fall squarely upon you. Check out
Chapter 15 for more info on appointing a second-in-command. The
bottom line is that no one who travels to your wedding should
suffer the discomfort of feeling lost, out of place, or disconnected
to the festivities.
Tipping Points
At home, adding a 15 to 20 percent tip to a bill is customary. At a
destination wedding, giving tips to certain service providers is also
expected. For instance, the officiant is entitled to an honorarium or
a donation. A minimum of $100 is considered appropriate. If the
officiant has spent significant time with you or traveled a long dis-
tance, giving more is fair.
Some of the helpers you may encounter expect a tip for good serv-
ice, as you can see in the following list. The amounts reflect the
minimum. Inflate these amounts in big cities, at four- and five-star
hotels, or for people who go out of their way for you.
 Bellboy: $2 per bag
 Cab or limo driver: 15 percent
 Parking valet: $1 per car
 Chambermaid: $2 per a day
 Restroom attendant: $.50 per visit or $1 per guest
 Rental setup hands: $5 each
If you’ve worked with an on-site wedding coordinator who is paid
by your hotel but has gone above and beyond the call of duty for
you, she deserves to be acknowledged. Thank her for her service
with a tip or a send a personal gift with a thank-you note after you
return home.
Before you leave a tip (or hand cash to Dad or the best man in
labeled envelopes to take care of this for you), make sure a service
charge isn’t already included in the bill. Anyone who receives a
negotiated fee doesn’t require a tip. Adding an amount beyond the
fee for superior service is strictly at your discretion.
Overseas tipping customs vary. In general, people don’t expect to
be as highly rewarded for service as in the United States. To avoid
making a faux pas, ask a local representative or contact the tourism
office of the country to ask what percentage is appropriate.

Gifts You Give and Gifts You Get
I had this dream before my destination wedding: I was seated on a
bench next to my best friend. We were surrounded by hundreds of
people bearing exquisitely wrapped and beribboned presents.
Over the loudspeaker, a voice repeated: “Please! Step up to the
transom, deposit your gift, and step aside. . . .”
Although my wedding didn’t play out that way, weddings can
engender a frenzy of gift-buying and gift-giving. Traditionally and
realistically, weddings of all kinds are an occasion to give and
receive, and it is thoughtful, considerate, and good etiquette to
thank everyone who makes the effort to acknowledge your union.
This section covers basic gift etiquette.
Attending to your attendants
Rewarding the friends and family members who come to stand up for
you at your wedding is good form. Not only do they provide moral
support and make a destination feel more pleasant, they also typically
bear the expense of their trip and buy a special outfit for the occasion.
Bridesmaids, moms, and honor attendants — especially ones who
have traveled a distance — deserve big thanks from the bride,
which is why it’s traditional to give them a gift before the wedding.
If time and funds allow, host an all-girls lunch and present gifts at
that event. Because everyone is traveling and no one likes to add
weight to her luggage, something lightweight and compact (such as
a pendant, earrings, or a small leather item) is usually appreciated.
Brides having a wedding at a resort with a spa may opt to gather
the wedding party and treat them to treatments. In addition to it
being a female bonding experience, they’ll look rested and glowing
at the ceremony and in photographs. The groom also needs to take
care of the best man and ushers. While the females are in the spa,
he can treat his buddies to a round of golf or a half-day chartered
fishing expedition. Great guy-to-guy thank-you gifts that are small
and light include engraved silver luggage tags, flasks, and money
clips. At informal destination weddings, you can give something
local, such as a bottle of bay rum aftershave or a box of Jamaican
jerk spice seasonings to be used at barbecues at home.
Thanking everyone for their gifts
No matter what presents you receive for your wedding, every gift
merits a thank-you note. Make sure you budget for thank-you notes
Chapter 16: Minding Your Manners: Destination Wedding Etiquette 263

when buying wedding stationery. And although guests have up to a
year to send a present, don’t let more than three months pass
before responding to their generosity.
Dealing with Bad Behavior
What can you do if you anticipate that one of your guests will act
out and put a damper on the celebration? The simple answer: Don’t
invite that person. Of course, it’s not that easy when the offending
party is a parent or a close friend. If, say, divorced parents remain
enemies, you need to speak to them in advance and let them know
that you’re counting on them to be civil. Seat them as far away from
one another as possible, and have someone keep an eye on them.
What if you have a friend or family member who drinks too much?
Some people consider a wedding at a resort where everyone stays
overnight and no one has to drive an invitation to overindulge. To
avoid a drunken scene, you can do a couple of things:
 Don’t have an open bar. Set specified times, such as during a
cocktail hour, when the bar will be open.
 Limit drinks to beer, wine, and champagne. Provide low-
alcohol-content beverages rather than hard liquor.
 Offer nonalcoholic alternatives. Piña coladas and other
fruity tropical drinks are still delicious without rum, and hot
coffee should always be available.
 Get the bartender on your side. An alert bartender can be
your best ally: Ask her to keep a close eye on anyone who’s
starting to get sloppy, halt service at a certain hour, and stop
pouring drinks for any person who is obviously inebriated.
Service like this merits a tip beyond the caterer’s fee.
The last thing you want is to have something occur at your wed-
ding away that would merit an embarrassing cameo on one of
those wedding-disaster TV shows. In case no one’s told you this
yet, you can’t control every aspect of your wedding, nor are you
obliged to. But you can take precautions.
If a guest has the bad manners to start feuding with another or
becomes an obnoxious drunk, ask someone in the wedding party
to handle the situation. Don’t attempt to engage them or rectify the
situation yourself. If you’re at a resort, call security. If you’re at a
different location or don’t have security nearby, know in advance
how to reach police, firefighters, and emergency medical assis-
tance. Just in case. Find out more about dealing with emergencies
in Chapter 19.

O
ne of the realities of having a destination wedding is that not
everyone you want to celebrate with may be able to make the
trip. Fortunately, you can use different means to involve the people
who are separated from you by distance. This chapter tells you how
to use the Internet to span the miles while you’re away, what you can
do to transport the essence of your destination home to loved ones,
and how to share the joy when you arrive home after the wedding.
Staying in Touch in Real Time
All brides and grooms are stars on their wedding day and those cou-
ples who want to share their performance can use technology to
enable people they know in faraway places to witness the event as it
happens. (As long as those folks have a computer and Web access.)
This section explains how you can keep in touch by using a Webcam
and a guest blogger so loved ones at home don’t feel left out.
Putting your wedding on a Webcam
The Webcam (a digital camera that streams live video over the
Internet) is one of the biggest boons to hit destination weddings,
reducing any residual guilt a couple may have over getting married
far away. From a facility that has a Webcam, your friends and
family (and perhaps an ex who just happens to stumble across it)
can watch your ceremony on the Internet.

Part IV: Sharing the Joy at Your Wedding, Now and Later 
266
Places that host many destination weddings every year — ranging
from the Viva Las Vegas Wedding Chapel on the Las Vegas Strip to
Princess Cruises’ Golden Princess at sea to Frenchman’s Reef &
Morning Star Marriott Beach Resort in the Caribbean — have
Webcams built into their chapels that couples can employ to trans-
mit pictures of their weddings in real time anywhere in the world.
When you decide where you’ll marry, ask the wedding coordinator
whether a Webcam is available. If the answer is yes, sometimes
there will be a fee; other times it is part of a wedding package.
Typically a wedding Webcast is hosted on the facility’s Web site for
at least a month, and you can request to have a copy for your-
selves burned onto a DVD or CD.
To help guide people how to watch your wedding on a Webcam, you
need to e-mail them a link to the Web page that hosts the images and
tell them what time to click on the link to watch your wedding live.
If your destination wedding location doesn’t have a Webcam, you
can take advantage of the technology by contracting with an out-
side company to provide this service. Ask a local planner for a rec-
ommendation. Prices start at about $400 for the Webcast plus 30
days of access to view your wedding on a company’s site.
Getting geeky with a guest blogger
A blog, also known as a Web log, is a personal online journal.
(Check out Chapter 3 for more specifics on how to use a blog.) You
can have a close friend or family member live-blog during the cere-
mony, so folks at home can follow the event play by play, as in the
following example:
“. . . the flower girl just started down the aisle. Lisa’s grand-
mother is crying, but her grandfather is laughing. A couple of
wedding guests just tried to sneak in late and unnoticed. HEY
Chris and Ashley! Where were you two?? . . .”
If you want to have your ceremony live-blogged, pick someone who
can type quickly (and coherently) and has a reporter’s eye. She
needs to have started a blog in advance plus that person will need a
portable computer with a wireless card, a good line of vision, and a
place to sit and input observations. (Just make sure that the prop-
erty has Wi-Fi range that extends to where the blogger is seated.)
If you’re including live-blogging at your destination wedding, notify
people well in advance to save the time, and be sure to inform
guests in absentia of the specific URL they need to log onto in
order to read in real time.

Chapter 17: Making Friends and Family Feel As If They Were There 267
Collecting Memories Before 
You Depart
Even those who couldn’t celebrate with you still may want to see and
hear all about the location, the ceremony, and the activities. Being
able to share memories of your wedding away (along with your own
desire to later revisit the experience) provides impetus to collect and
capture mementos before you head home. This section helps you
gather ideas for photographs, scrapbook items, and souvenirs so you
can share them with friends and family who couldn’t attend.
Shooting stars
Pictures of the two of you, dressed for your wedding and dressed
for fun, guest gatherings, meals and excursions, even your room
and the place where you stay deserve to be captured on film.
At a typical hometown wedding, a photographer is booked for a
limited number of hours during the ceremony and reception.
However, because your destination wedding may last a couple of
days — and different events (his attendants’ kayaking expedition,
her bridesmaids’ mani-pedi session) may take place at the same
time — one pro can’t possibly capture the complete destination
wedding experience and the price could be stratospheric.
To solve this dilemma, ask friends to bring their cameras and shoot
even if you have a photographer booked for the formal part of your
event. You can never have enough pictures of your own wedding. If
friends’ cameras are digital, ask them to burn the shots onto a CD
or e-mail them to you right after the wedding. If not, offer to pay for
a duplicate set of prints or ask for copies of the negatives.
You can also distribute one-time-use video cameras or disposable
waterproof cameras (with postage-paid returns to you) in guests’
welcome bags, along with a request to take memorable pictures of
their experiences. After you have a chance to go through all the
photos, choose the best ones and upload them to your wedding
Web site and make prints for your photo album as well as for
people who couldn’t attend. (Framing and sending one great shot
to each guest who did come as thanks is a nice touch.)
Collecting scrapbook-worthy items
Photographs and postcards aren’t the only mementos of a destina-
tion wedding worth collecting. If you intend to create a digital or

paper scrapbook or if you want to compile a keepsake box to hold
meaningful items, gathering the following can help to revive memo-
ries in years to come:
 From your wedding stationery: Save copies of your wedding
invitation and announcements.
 From the front desk: After the wedding, stash a copy of the
hotel brochure and other brochures that describe activities
your guests took part in.
 From the bar: Pick up matchbooks, napkins, and anything
else that has the property’s name on them . . . except the bar-
tender’s uniform. (At least not while he’s still in it.)
 From your hotel room: Many resorts issue nonreturnable
plastic room keys with a pretty design or picture of the hotel
on the front. And don’t forget to nab the Do Not Disturb sign.
 From your welcome packet: Did you prepare an agenda, pro-
gram, or newsletter for guests? Keep a few copies.
 From pre-wedding events: Admission tickets, postcards, even
promotional materials may be worth saving.
 From the ceremony: If you issue a program, include this. And
preserve some petals from the bride’s bouquet.
 From your guests: You want to save all the wedding gift and
greeting cards you receive from well-wishers. Also put aside
any silly notes and doodles guests may leave you during the
trip. (See Figure 17-1 for some examples.)
Figure 17-1: Don’t forget to include notes from 
wedding guests in your scrapbook.
As soon as you get home, scan in all important paper and flat
objects for your digital scrapbook before they have a chance to be
misplaced. After you’ve gathered all the items, check out the
“Creating your own look book” section, later in this chapter, for
tips on putting everything together.

Shopping for meaningful souvenirs
If you shop for souvenirs during your time away, consider picking
up small gifts for the dearest friends and family members who
couldn’t attend. Gifts needn’t be expensive or showy; just select
something that shows you know what they like.
Choosing a gift that is unique to your wedding location is a good
idea. If your destination wedding takes place in Jamaica or Hawaii,
for example, a container of homegrown coffee is a natural choice.
Taking your vows in Vegas? Play up the kitsch with an Elvis-related
goody, or please people with a box of sweets from the city’s own
Ethel M. Chocolates.
Traveling home from Europe? If you splurged on gifts for your-
selves and others there, make sure to gather up your VAT (value-
added tax) receipts and turn them in for a refund at the designated
spot in the airport.
Spreading Cheer After 
You Return Home
Although the wedding may be over, opportunities to celebrate
your marriage with friends and family members who couldn’t
attend need not be. This section highlights a few ways to reach out
to them and share memories.
Making the big announcement
If you didn’t have destination wedding announcements printed up
beforehand and mailed from the location after the ceremony, con-
sider doing so now. They’re a gracious way of telling folks that the
event took place. Depending on your taste, announcements’ fonts,
design, and language can be formal sounding, folksy, fun, or funky.
Mail the announcements from your destination or as close to your
arrival home as possible.
Announcements go out after the wedding and are primarily for
people you didn’t invite (like business associates, co-workers, and
distant relatives) and those who you did invite but who didn’t attend.
Chapter 17: Making Friends and Family Feel As If They Were There 269

Be sure to include the following information in your wedding
announcement (refer to Figure 17-2 for some destination wedding
announcements):
 Your names
 Where you were married
 The date you were wed
Figure 17-2: You can send a destination wedding announcement to anyone you
think would be pleased by the news after you return home.
Creating your own look book
Pictures are worth a thousand words, and nothing tells the story of
a wedding better than a beautiful and well-organized book or digi-
tal document that tracks your event from beginning to end.
After you have all your wedding photos and scrapbook items gath-
ered from the different sources contributing them, decide how you
want to present and preserve them for your own enjoyment and
that of your circle. This section shows you a few options. (Check
out Scrapbooking For Dummies and Digital Scrapbooking For
Dummies, both by Jeanne Wines-Reed and Joan Wines [Wiley].)
Getting an album to have and to hold
Most couples prefer to have a physical wedding album. If your pho-
tography package didn’t include one, or you’d like to upgrade, con-
sider purchasing a photo album and putting it together. You can
find a variety of styles at camera and gift stores as well as at
www.weddingalbumdepot.com.

Going for a digital display
The advantage of making wedding pictures and mementos avail-
able online is that regardless of how far away friends and family
are, they can access your treasures after you put them online.
Some photographers include an online album in their services that
can be accessed via password, and photos can be purchased
directly online or downloaded for the user to print herself. If this
applies to you, let people know it’s available to them by e-mailing
the link and password to them.
If you’re the one posting your photos online, consider the following
options:
 Use a free photo-sharing site, such as www.flickr.com or
www.kodakgallery.com. Choosing this method is a simple
way to get your digital wedding pictures seen quickly. After
images are posted, all you need to do is send out an e-mail
with the address of your site and invite friends to take a look
at your photos and register so that they can leave comments.
 Try Microsoft PowerPoint. This program isn’t only for busi-
ness presentations. You can use it to create a wedding album
or slideshow by importing a sequence of images and adding
headlines and comments. To make sure the widest number of
guests and nonguests who have a computer can easily view it,
save your PowerPoint album as a PDF file and then e-mail it to
them as an attachment.
Going from pixels to a printed book
There’s nothing like having a rich-looking photo album that you
can hold in your hands — especially when you want to point out
particular pictures to a couple of friends at your side.
Here’s good news: You can have your pictures preserved both digi-
tally and printed. iPhoto software, which is bundled with all new
Apple computers, enables you to organize your best photos into a
great-looking photo album that can be professionally printed.
Picaboo (www.picaboo.com) enables Windows XP users by allow-
ing you to download the appropriate software to do the same. And
you can buy multiple copies of the album or share it online for free.
Updating your wedsite
If you created a wedding Web site, known as a wedsite (turn to
Chapter 3), updating it when you get home from your wedding is
worth the effort. Even if you never touch the site again (and many
Chapter 17: Making Friends and Family Feel As If They Were There 271

couples do abandon theirs after the wedding), your words and pic-
tures that describe the ceremony, reception, and related events
can create a satisfying conclusion to the first chapter of your mar-
ried life together.
Additional elements that you may want to include are links to
related Web sites that show off where you traveled to and photos
of the wedding. If you spent your honeymoon elsewhere, include
photos and a narrative of that trip on your wedsite as well. If your
wedding was captured on video, you may want to post some of it
on your site. Ask your videographer to provide you with a digitized
version that you can upload.
Holding an at-home reception
You can’t find a rule that says couples who have a small destination
wedding can’t still host a celebration at home. In fact, many newly-
weds do just that. Having a post-wedding celebration is a great way
to let friends and family who couldn’t travel witness you now as a
married couple. No one expects a re-creation of the wedding
(although that’s what some couples attempt). Because you pick up
the tab, you can keep your event modest and still be comfortable.
When should you schedule the party? Again, nothing is written in
stone. Most couples aim to have their party within a month of their
return, while memories are still fresh (as long as their pictures are
back from the photogapher by then). But if you had a winter wed-
ding away, you can wait until summer and throw a backyard barbe-
cue then. If funds are tight, you can even wait for your first
anniversary to roll around.
At one point during the event, invite guests to gather in front of
your TV or a screen you rent for the occasion. Arrange to have
your best man, maid of honor, or another person run a slide show
or video while the two of you sneak away until he or she
announces, “Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to
introduce to you. . . .” And then the two of you can make an
entrance, even wearing your wedding attire if you like.
To help your hometown wedding reception feel different from an
ordinary party, enhance it by giving the event a destination theme
that’s carried through to the drinks and decorations. Be sure to have
your look book (see the section “Creating your own look book”)
available for viewing. Consider blowing up some of your favorite
photos, framing them, and arranging them in a wall gallery for party
guests to admire as you tell about your amazing wedding trip.

Chapter 18
Beginning the Honeymoon
In This Chapter
 Deciding where and when to go
 Choosing a honeymoon or romance package that suits you
 Knowing what to pack
 Guaranteeing your privacy as Mr. and Mrs.
I
n the storybook fantasy, a honeymoon begins that moment after
the wedding when a couple disappears into the sunset, and they
live happily ever after. In reality, honeymoon happiness takes a bit
of planning for that to occur. Traditionally it was the groom’s
responsibility to organize the honeymoon. Because your wedding
and honeymoon may be rolled into one extended getaway, you
likely will want to decide together where to go.
Whether you make your honeymoon part of the destination wed-
ding or take it at another time, this chapter can help you to plan a
first vacation together as Mr. and Mrs. that is as rapturous as the
fantasy.
The Best Is Yet to Come
Having a wedding away is fabulous, but for some couples the cere-
mony’s merely the prelude to an even bigger thrill: going on the
honeymoon. If you intend to take a post-wedding twirl, you have
three choices: Stay on in the place where you wed, head some-
place else directly after the wedding, or return home and take your
honeymoon at another time.
Deciding whether to go or stay
When figuring out your honeymoon plans, remember that remaining
in one place has certain advantages:

Part IV: Sharing the Joy at Your Wedding, Now and Later 
274
 You’re likely to find pricing deals that make it tempting to 
stay put.
 You can immediately start to relax after the wedding and not
have to deal with making additional travel connections.
 You don’t have to pack or unpack.
 If you want to vacation with your wedding party, staying put
makes it easy.
The majority of couples who have a destination wedding at an all-
inclusive resort combine it with a honeymoon at the same spot or one
in close proximity. For example, Sandals Resorts, which coined the
term weddingmoon (a combination wedding and honeymoon) offers
honeymooners at its Jamaican properties privileges to use facilities
at other Sandals on the island, which can add variety to a getaway.
On the other hand, a property that worked wonderfully for a wed-
ding may not be as desirable as a honeymoon spot. Or perhaps
you’ve got a touch of wanderlust and would prefer to visit more
than one destination during your time away from home. Whatever
the case, investigating different options before you make a commit-
ment is worth the effort.
Going on close calls
Some of the smartest destination weddings and honeymoons com-
bine two different types of trips within close proximity to one
another. That way, not much traveling is involved, but you have
the excitement of visiting a fresh venue.
If you want a slightly different experience with your honeymoon
than you did with your wedding, look to the surrounding areas.
When you make the plans, consider nearby locations that would
make a great getaway but don’t require much travel time. Many
travel guidebooks feature info on day trips from the primary desti-
nation. Or you can simply eyeball a map to see what’s nearby. But
before making plans, find out what type of transportation is avail-
able from Point A to Point B.
Taking the honeymoon later
Not every couple goes on their honeymoon directly following the
wedding, and you may find advantages to postponing yours.
Perhaps you don’t have much extra money after paying for your
wedding, or your work schedule just doesn’t allow for you to take
an extra week for your honeymoon.

Rather than rushing through or skimping on your honeymoon, you
can find good reasons to justify taking a honeymoon later:
 You can spread out the fun. Go home and relax after the wed-
ding, savor the memories, and then take your honeymoon
when you really need a break.
 You can save up. Maybe you always dreamed of a honeymoon
in Paris, or on safari in Africa, or even a cross-country drive.
After funding the wedding, you may not have the money for
that dream honeymoon.
 You can head off in another direction. Winter-wed couples
can warm up by honeymooning on a tropical island; summer
ones can hit the slopes. City couples may enjoy active out-
door adventures.
 You can take “mini-moons.” Instead of having just one honey-
moon, plan for a year of them, taking off on a series of long
weekends that lead to a variety of places and experiences.
Having the Honeymoon You Want
Just as with the wedding, you probably harbor an image of what
your honeymoon should be like and where you want it to take
place. What makes this more than an ordinary vacation is that two
of you, with two different visions, need to communicate and com-
promise so that your post-wedding getaway fulfills as many of both
of your desires as possible.
Don’t think you can afford a honeymoon? If you’d rather receive
travel gifts in lieu of household items, consider signing up with a
honeymoon registry service, such as www.giftpile.com. Guests
can contribute any amount they want, which can be applied to
your airfare, accommodations, tours, special dinners, and other
honeymoon delights.
In order to have a honeymoon that you both remember fondly, this
section helps you identify some different types so you can cus-
tomize yours. Whether you remain at the destination wedding site
or take your honeymoon at a different time than the wedding,
knowing your honeymoon “personality” as a couple will lead you
to select a place where you can be happiest. And there’s nothing
wrong with picking a honeymoon destination first . . . and after-
ward determining a suitable spot to hold a wedding there.
Chapter 18: Beginning the Honeymoon 275

Knowing your honeymoon type
Where you go on your honeymoon should reflect the kind of
couple you are and what you like to do on vacation. These cat-
egories can help point you in the right direction and provide 
some ideas.
For the active, sports-minded couple
Are you and your betrothed constantly on the go, playing golf or
tennis, skiing, sailing, biking — you name it? You can find resorts
throughout the United States and the rest of the world to concen-
trate on that activity to your heart’s content. Keep in mind that a
nearby spa is a good complement to vacation exertion.
Consider the following honeymoons if you’re active:
 A golf or tennis getaway: Florida is the state with the most
golf courses (California comes next), and tennis courts are
plentiful. Full-service resorts offer play time, instruction, and
other activities.
 A ski trip: For great skiing, consider the Rocky Mountain and
New England states, Canada’s Laurentians, or Argentina’s
slopes in summer.
 A sailing tour: Sailors appreciate the world-class experience
of Newport, Rhode Island, as well as in the British Virgin
Islands, only reachable by boat. You can skipper your own
skiff or rent one with a crew and relax.
 A bike trek: Like to bike? Riding around on bicycles is a great
way to see a country. For example, Switzerland rents bicycles
at all major train stations and allows renters to bring bikes
aboard.
For the sophisticated couple
Dynamic cities appeal to stylish couples. Look for destinations that
primarily appeal to adults (casino resorts are one option) and have
nightlife and good entertainment available. Consider these options:
 New York City: If you’ve never been to New York, Gotham is a
terrific place to honeymoon. World-class theater, shopping,
restaurants, and hotels all draw lovers.
 Santa Fe: Out West in New Mexico, Santa Fe’s laid-back vibe,
spicy Southwestern fare, and vital art scene make it a favorite
with romantics.
Part IV: Sharing the Joy at Your Wedding, Now and Later 
276

 Paris: A honeymoon in France is still the gold standard for
some couples. You can also combine it with side trips to
romantic Bruges, Belgium, and heady Amsterdam.
 Eastern Europe: Although Western Europe is expensive,
Eastern Europe is less so. Emerging countries such as Croatia
and the Czech Republic have excellent hotels and spas.
For the couple with kids
Even if children are along, your getaway should still feel like a
honeymoon and allow you time alone. Look for family-friendly
resorts and all-inclusives that have children’s programs and
babysitting services. Also, you may want to consider a cruise on
one of the Disney ships because they’re geared to youngsters but
also have spas and some adult-oriented activities.
For the couple who simply wants to kick back
Go ahead. Pamper yourselves: You’ve earned it. If you don’t feel
like doing more than lifting a finger to summon a waiter to bring
another margarita, who’s to say no? Find honeymoon bliss on holi-
days like these:
 Caribbean islands: Surrounded by the sand, baked by the
sun, and cooled by the sea, you’ll get back in touch with your
senses in the tropics. Younger couples and inexperienced
travelers appreciate the security of all-inclusive resorts; older
ones may find other places where they are less cut off from
the local culture more appealing. (Check out Chapter 8.)
 Cruises: The original no-stress vacation, a cruise takes you
from port to port without the hassle of repacking. And all the
major costs are paid upfront, which makes it easier to stick to
a budget. (Chapter 10 has more info.)
 Spas: Sleep right through the optional 6 a.m. hike and head
out after breakfast for a bike ride or dual hot-stone massages.
Look for spa resorts that have a menu of couples’ services
that you can enjoy together in a couples treatment room; out-
doors in a private, shady spot; or en suite.
Honeymoon romance packages:
What you can expect
Reveling in the amenities in a romance package can make a honey-
moon feel blissfully different from a typical vacation. Typically the
package cost is in addition to the daily room rate, although it may
be bundled together. Goodies in such packages, like the following
treats, vary from place to place, but often include
Chapter 18: Beginning the Honeymoon 277

 Room upgrade
 Champagne, flowers, and/or fruit basket upon arrival
 Couples massage
 Candlelight dinner
 Rose-petal turndown
 Breakfast in bed
 Late checkout
Hotels and resorts that truly cater to honeymooners often have a
dedicated staff person, such as a romance concierge or butler, who
you can call upon to orchestrate extraordinary experiences such
as a sunrise hot-air balloon ride, a gourmet picnic at a secluded
spot, and a moonlight cruise.
Packing for Your Honeymoon
How much you need to pack for a honeymoon depends on how
long you will be gone from home and the type of honeymoon you
plan to take. Some brides plan to wear a different outfit for every
day, plus different sexy lingerie every night (and sometimes in
between). Other couples like to travel as light as possible, espe-
cially if they will be carrying their own bags and visiting multiple
destinations.
Should you take one big suitcase or two smaller ones? Everyone
has a different packing style. If each of you is doing your own pack-
ing, you may be happiest to have one suitcase apiece. To be on the
safe side, though, tuck a day’s underwear and socks into one
another’s bags. And putting a layer of tissue paper or plastic
between items cuts down on wrinkling.
You can find a comprehensive honeymoon packing list on my
Honeymoons/Romantic Getaways from About.com site at http://
honeymoons.about.com/cs/travelplanner/a/Packing_List.
htm. In addition to travel documents and whatever clothing you
bring along with you, consider the following essentials:
Sundries
❑Medications
❑Sunscreen with SPF
❑Travel toothbrush with toothpaste and floss
Part IV: Sharing the Joy at Your Wedding, Now and Later 
278

❑Birth control
❑Personal lubricant
Miscellaneous
❑Quart-size, zip-top plastic bags
❑Daypack
❑Cell phone (check coverage area) with charger
❑Current-converter plug (if traveling overseas)
❑Custom-fitted sports gear
❑Extra contacts or eyeglasses
❑Address list to send postcards
❑Scented travel candle
What you leave at home can be as important as what you travel with
if you experience a loss. Before you go, make photocopies of your
passport and all your credit cards (back and front) and leave them
with a trusted friend or family member. If you’re using traveler’s
checks, give that person the serial numbers too. Keep a copy of
everything with you as well, in a different place from the originals.
Bidding Guests Good-Bye
Joy-filled days surround a destination wedding, but sooner or later
the party is over. If you’re staying on at the destination, it’s
thoughtful to appear at the send-off to personally say good-bye to
everyone who attended and thank them for coming. When guests
decide to stay on after the wedding (after all, you picked a blissful
spot for them to travel to), you have two choices — spend time
with them or make a graceful exit. This section examines those
options.
How to make a great escape
The wedding festivities are over, and the two of you now want to
relax at your destination. However, some of your loved ones have
decided to also stay at the destination for a couple of days. No
matter where you go — to the pool, to the spa, or to dinner — you
keep running into your sister and her new boyfriend.
Chapter 18: Beginning the Honeymoon 279

If you want to spend some time with them, then communicate to
them when you’re available. Focus on something you want to do
anyway — take out kayaks, try a new restaurant — and invite them
to come along for an activity that has a clear beginning and end.
That way you can have quality time together and won’t be impolite
when you take your leave.
If after the festivities you don’t want to be bothered, how can you
let hangers-on know when it’s time to give you privacy? Mention on
the agenda tucked into their welcome bag at what point you’ll be
going into seclusion, hang a do-not-disturb sign on your door, and
instruct the operator not to put any calls through to your room. If
you have a persistent family member who’s just not catching on,
you can change rooms, switch to a nearby hotel, or simply take off
on an excursion and return when the coast is clear.
The buck stops here
After the wedding is officially over and guests remain, charges may
still accrue. Who pays for guests’ food and drinks then? In two
words: They do.
To clarify that message, you can include a small area on your wed-
ding Web site, in a travel-info mailing, or on the welcome-bag
agenda that spells things out. For example:
We are thrilled to have you as our wedding guests. The rehearsal
dinner and drinks, everything at the reception, the trail ride, and
the farewell brunch are all complimentary, our gift to you.
Unfortunately, we cannot fund additional meals, activities with
fees, and airport transportation; they will be charged to your
credit card.
Confirm that the front desk has taken a credit card imprint from
each guest. Make clear to management whether anyone besides
the two of you may add to your tab after the wedding. And before
the first guest leaves, give your own bill the once-over to make
sure there are no unauthorized or misappropriated charges.
As you’re checking out, if you notice extra fees, such as your Uncle
Harry’s back waxing from the spa on your bill, direct the front desk
to reassign the charge to the correct account; they’ll still have
Harry’s card on file.

practical suggestions designed to help and inspire
you. Chapter 19 covers what to do when unexpected
emergencies arise (closing your eyes and counting to ten

saving ideas that can help you spend less on airfare and

Ten Emergencies You May
Face and How to Handle ’Em
In This Chapter
 Celebrating in sickness and in health
 Dealing with natural and unnatural disasters
 Finding suitable substitutes for missing elements
R
are is the destination wedding that goes off without a single
hitch. Although brides and grooms don’t go looking for trou-
ble, it can still show up like an unwanted guest. Fortunately, most
wedding emergencies are temporary and manageable.
Expect the unexpected — and prepare as best you can by following
my four “S” system for handling unforeseen problems:
 Stress safety. Whatever the situation, put people’s safety first.
 Stay calm. People look to you in a crisis. Act confidently and
decisively, even if you have to fake it initially.
 Show sensitivity. It’s your day, but everyone involved — from
your guests to the serving staff — wants it to turn out well.
Appreciate their efforts and understand that cultural differ-
ences can cause confusion. The words please and thank you in
any language go a long way toward maintaining harmony.
 Smile. A situation can seem like a disaster at the moment, but
in retrospect, you may be able to laugh about it. Should it con-
tinue to hurt forever after, at least you’ll be smiling in the wed-
ding pictures.
Although anything can happen at a wedding, this chapter covers
some common disasters large and small that couples fear most
and how to handle them.

Someone Gets Sick
The number-one destination wedding fear couples have is some-
one getting sick. Buying insurance can contribute peace of mind
(so can packing all necessary medications and carrying them with
you). Wedding insurance can cover the cost of postponing the event
if key people can’t attend due to sickness or injury. Trip insurance
extends your health insurance coverage to another country and
can fund emergency transportation home or to a reputable local
medical facility. Talk to an insurance agent to get more info on these
types of policies or visit www.wedsafe.com or www.insuremytrip.
com on the Web.
If the bride or groom is ailing (or another member of the wedding
party), as long as she or he can stand and speak, go through with
the ceremony and deal with the situation afterward.
Mother Nature Doesn’t Cooperate
Skies can open even in the sunniest venues, so if you’re planning a
beach, garden, or other outdoor wedding, think ahead and have an
indoor space or tented area available as a backup. If minor show-
ers are expected, ask one of the staff or wedding-party members to
round up enough umbrellas for everyone.
If you’re trying to decide whether to move the ceremony indoors,
my rule of thumb is this: If the weather is going to seriously detract
or distract from the wedding, you need to go indoors.
Luggage Is Lost
To avoid having your most important items lost in transit, be sure
to carry your wedding gear with you. Everything else is replace-
able. (Check out Chapters 11 and 18 for more info about packing.)
If your luggage goes AWOL, fill out and submit a claim form at the
airline’s baggage service desk before you leave the airport and
hold onto your claim tags. Understand that most airlines endeavor
to return missing bags within 24 hours, so make sure your carrier
knows where you can be reached if the address is different from
the one on your luggage tag.

Chapter 19: Ten Emergencies You May Face and How to Handle 'Em 285
A Fashion Disaster Occurs
Sometimes the fashion gods aren’t on your side. What do you do if
someone steps on your dress and it tears or you spill a little red
wine on your guayabera shirt? No worries.
Every bride and groom needs an emergency kit that includes safety
pins, needle and thread, and stain remover. If a wardrobe malfunc-
tion is beyond help, go to your room and change — and encourage
everyone else to take a break and get comfortable, too.
Vendors Are No-Shows
Aside from the two of you, everyone else at your wedding is
replaceable — and the show must go on. What happens, though, if
the following people don’t show?
 Your officiant MIA? Seek out a civil authority to conduct the
ceremony.
 No musicians? CDs can serve as backup.
 Caterers kaput? In a pinch, pick up takeout.
The key word is improvise.
Uninvited Guests Arrive
Hotels and resorts all have security details, which is a good thing
since the movie Wedding Crashers gave some people the wrong
idea. If you spot a stranger helping himself to the crab dip or hit-
ting on the bridesmaids, notify security and ask to have that indi-
vidual escorted away from the party.
At a public facility such as a beach or park, couples are more vul-
nerable and need to depend on the persuasive powers of a dad or
the best man to keep riff-raff away. You may also consider hiring an
off-duty policeman to work security.
A Fight Breaks Out
What happens if the groom’s cousin Mel starts fighting with the new
boyfriend of his ex-girlfriend? No bride or groom should have to be
put in the position of a referee. One way to limit the possibility of
this happening is by keeping feuding friends and family members

off the guest list. Should tempers nonetheless flare, have someone
separate and isolate the party poopers. And don’t fan the flames
with more alcohol; stop serving drinks.
The Ceremony Is Interrupted
Some things you can plan for — others you can’t. However, you
can take steps to ensure that your ceremony isn’t interrupted by
certain distractions, such as the following:
 Sirens: To avoid the blaring sound of sirens, don’t stage the
ceremony within hearing distance of a hospital, firehouse, or
police station.
 Public announcements: Outdoors on a ship, ask that loud-
speaker announcements be postponed until after the ceremony.
 Construction noises: At a hotel or public spot, find out
whether construction is taking place nearby. If it is, request
from the person in charge that the noise abate during a spe-
cific time (a gift of cash can make such a request that much
more urgent) or try to juggle the ceremony schedule to co-
incide with lunch hour or after quitting time.
In the case of unanticipated interruptions, allow a short time to
pass until everyone regains their composure and continue with the
ceremony as planned.
The Wedding Ring Is Missing
What if the groom or best man can’t locate the wedding bands?
This emergency is easy to solve (at least for the ceremony):
Borrow a ring from a married guest. Afterwards you can take the
necessary steps to find the missing ring.
The Cake Collapses
Someone jolts the table holding the wedding cake, and the cake
falls over in slow motion while everyone gasps. Or the whipped
cream topping or buttercream frosting doesn’t hold up under
extreme temperature and starts to melt. Instead of an elegant cake,
you’ve got . . . mush. What should you do? Salvage and serve what
you can. If a bakery or supermarket is nearby, send someone to
buy a substitute cake. And if all else fails, remember that everyone
loves ice cream for dessert.

Chapter 20
Ten Ways to Save Money on
Your Destination Wedding
In This Chapter
 Getting the most out of a destination
 Saving money without sacrificing style
 Flying, dressing, and dining smart
You may find it mind-boggling that the typical wedding costs as
much as a new car. But it doesn’t have to. By controlling the
size of your guest list, buying locally, and forgoing some unneces-
sary frills, you can pull off a fabulous destination wedding at a frac-
tion of that cost.
Don’t lose sight of the fact that destination weddings are big busi-
ness: It should come as no surprise that as soon as wedding is
affixed to a product’s description — as in wedding invitation or
wedding favor — another 25 percent or so gets tacked onto the
price. Counter that by assuming everything is negotiable.
Subsidizing the wedding industry or paying more than your fair
share to have a memorable event certainly isn’t your responsibil-
ity. Of course, no one wants an event where corners obviously
have been cut and guests can’t fully enjoy themselves (example:
the cash bar). On the other hand, being clever about destination
wedding costs can ensure that you, like your money, go farther
than you ever dreamed. This short chapter can help you save
money without sacrificing.
Book a Location Off-Season
Destinations have popular and not-so-popular seasons. For exam-
ple, every April 15, hotel rates in the Caribbean plummet, and
come summer, you can find bargains at mountaintop ski resorts,

too. By choosing to hold your wedding in a place out of season,
you can avoid both crowds and higher prices. What’s more, you’re
likely to receive more personal attention when staff isn’t harried
and overworked.
In addition to traveling off-season, consider adjusting the day of the
week and time of day for the wedding. Saturday night is prime time;
everything else is cheaper. And an event that takes place in daytime
hours is less expensive than one that begins at or after sunset. (For
more info on booking a location, check out Chapter 11.)
Invite Fewer Guests
More guests means higher expenses. Scrutinize your list for people
who aren’t essential. Do all your work colleagues need to be
invited? What about the best friend you had when you were 7
years old and promised you’d go to each other’s weddings but only
exchange Christmas cards with now?
As you consider each name, ask yourselves, “Is this someone we
not only want at our wedding but would also like to spend our
vacation with?” (Refer to Chapter 12 for figuring out who to invite.)
Skip the Paid Wedding Planner
Keep the wedding small and simple, and you can do the planning
and organizing yourselves. Have confidence that the pros you hire
can operate without being supervised by a middleman: It’s more
than likely that your recommended printer understands what a
deadline means; your florist knows how to acquire, arrange, and
deliver bouquets to the right place and on time; and your baker
has made more than a few wedding cakes in her day. (See Chapter
3 for how you can organize a memorable event.)
Depending on where you hold the wedding, you may be entitled to
use a wedding coordinator at no cost. If you choose a hotel that
maintains an on-site coordinator, her planning services are typi-
cally included in the wedding package price.
Save on Airfare
Look beyond the major airlines for transportation. Low-cost air-
lines, such as Southwest and jetBlue in the United States and
Ryanair and EasyJet in Europe, offer great deals. For example, you
Part V: The Part of Tens 
288

won’t find Southwest on Expedia or Travelocity; the airline only
sells flights online from its Web site (www.southwest.com).
Also, if you know any frequent fliers with extra mileage, they may
be willing to donate them to you in lieu of a gift (another great
money-saving alternative).
Get Dressed for Less
You have many alternatives to paying retail when dressing for a
destination wedding. Keep the following suggestions in mind:
 Look for sales and discounts. Small-size brides can score big
at sample sales. Brides of all sizes can find deals online at
eBay (search for wedding gowns that are “NWT” — new with
tags), www.preownedweddingdresses.com, and Craigslist
(www.craigslist.com).
 Check the newspaper’s classified section and keep an eye
out for local bridal shows. Vendors may offer a discount to
brides who buy that day.
 Wear a used dress. If you don’t mind something preworn,
borrow from a friend, haunt upscale thrift shops, or consider
retailoring your mother’s wedding dress.
Frugality doesn’t have to end with the dress. Carry a silk rather than
a live-flower bouquet. (It will look the same in pictures, and you can
treasure it forever.) And make your own bridal veil, which consists
of little more than tulle and a comb or headband. Anyone who can
sew a button on neatly is qualified to create one of these. Find com-
plete free instructions at www.wegotgame.net/jen/veils.html.
Employ the Talents of 
Friends and Family
Do you have an artistic friend who can design invitations? Who
takes the most interesting (and in-focus) photographs in your
group? Can someone arrange flowers elegantly? By engaging the
skills that amateur but able friends and relatives have, you can
save money and have a wedding in which those guests take special
pride. (For more tips on collaborating with friends and family, see
Chapter 5.)
Chapter 20: Ten Ways to Save Money on Your Destination Wedding 289

If you’re crafty yourself, adding the prefix DIY (do it yourself) to
what you want to make in the Google search box can yield free
advice on how to create everything from DIY invitations to DIY
centerpieces to DIY wedding favors.
Buy Locally Rather than 
Bring It with You
Purchasing wedding supplies locally is cheaper and more ecologi-
cally sensitive than bringing everything with you. Plus, using any-
thing from indigenous flowers to local musical talent underscores a
destination wedding’s sense of place while supporting the local
economy.
Celebrate in a Restaurant
Scout out the best family-owned restaurants at your destination.
Having a reception at a place with the owner on the premises and
that is 100 percent dedicated to serving food means you don’t have
to deal with caterers, rentals, and basically reinvent the wheel. Try
to schedule at least one tasting, and consider places that specialize
in regional cuisine. Many eateries have private rooms for parties,
and smaller ones may close their doors to host your party.
Forgo the Program and Favors
If your wedding is small, you don’t need a program to identify the
players and spell out the scenario. Those details can go in a wel-
come-bag newsletter. As for favors, either make something by hand
or skip them entirely. Put things guests will really use and appreci-
ate in the welcome bag. (Check out Chapter 12 for more info.)
Sacrifice Extra Desserts
Of course you want a wedding cake. (Although you can save by
having a small one for show and another that’s a sheet cake, cut
and plated in the kitchen.) No one will think less of you if you don’t
have a Viennese table or sweet little cookies to send them off —
especially if you’re all gathering for breakfast the next day.
