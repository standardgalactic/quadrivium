Introduction
This book is intended to provide an introduction to the exciting and emerging world of 
IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN (WLAN) technology. This technology continues to expand at 
a phenomenal pace, with constant improvements in speed, performance, reliability, and 
security. This book will teach you the fundamentals of IEEE 802.11 standards-based wire-
less technology, giving you an overview of the terminology, hardware and software com-
ponents, radio frequency (RF) communication principles, and support and maintenance 
associated with WLAN technology, commonly referred to as Wi-Fi™.
In addition to providing an overview of the technology, this book will help you prepare 
for the Certified Wireless Technology Specialist (CWTS) certification exam, the Certified 
Wireless Specialist (CWS) certification exam, and the Certified Wireless Technician (CWT) 
certification exam, which are all available from the Certified Wireless Network Professional 
(CWNP) program.
CWTS is an entry-level enterprise WLAN certification and is recommended as prepara-
tion for the Certified Wireless Network Administrator (CWNA) certification. This certifi-
cation is geared specifically toward WLAN support staff, sales and marketing personnel, or 
anyone who wants to become more familiar with the enterprise WLAN industry.
CWS is targeted for those who need to be able to explain basic features and capabilities 
of WLAN solutions, including access points, controllers, WLAN management solutions, 
and 802.11 networks. It also helps you assist in selecting the best equipment for a deploy-
ment or communicate well with those who are responsible for such decisions. The CWS 
is not responsible for the configuration and management of the WLAN but must have the 
ability to gather information to determine requirements and match technologies to those 
requirements for a deployment.
CWT is geared toward the individual who can install access points based on a design 
document, configure access points for initial operations, and ensure connectivity. The 
CWT can troubleshoot basic problems and assist users in-person or through remote com-
munications in problem resolution. The ability to configure a WLAN client for connectiv-
ity is paramount and includes an understanding of the configuration process for service 
set identifiers (SSIDs), security settings, and other client adapter settings. The CWT is not 
responsible for WLAN design, analysis, or security design; however, the CWT should be 
able to gather information from a design specification document to properly configure an 
access point and troubleshoot individual connection issues. The CWT may not be aware 
of the actual WLAN architectural design, the RF design, or the full feature set in use to 
implement the WLAN.
In addition to helping you prepare for all three certification exams, this book will give 
you the fundamental knowledge, tools, and terminology to more effectively sell and sup-
port enterprise IEEE 802.11 WLAN technologies. The main goal of this book is for you to 
learn “what it is,” not “how it works.” The “how” part comes later, in other Study Guides 
and instructor-led courses. After reading this book and completing all the available prac-
tice exam tools included, you will have the knowledge needed to take the CWTS, CWS, or 
CWT certification exams.

it is,” not “how it works.” The exam objectives were designed based on the skill set the 
intended audience should need in order to perform their job functions or roles in an organi-
zation. One thing to keep in mind is that this book will introduce and teach you a technol-
ogy, a combination of computer LAN and RF technology.
If you follow the exam objectives, perform the hands-on exercises, and utilize all the 
available exam questions and practice exams at the book’s companion website (www.wiley 
.com/go/sybextestprep) and at www.cwnp.com, you should be prepared to pass the certi-
fication exams. This book will also serve as a stepping-stone to more advanced books that 
teach the technology in more depth, as well as a reference guide for the technology.
How to Use This Book and the Companion Website
Several testing features are in this book, and an exam engine that contains flashcards and 
additional practice exams is available on the book’s companion website (www.wiley.com/
go/sybextestprep). These are designed to test your knowledge of the information you have 
learned from reading the book and performing the exercises. Although there is no guaran-
tee you will pass the certification exam if you use this book and the additional online mate-
rial, you will have all the tools necessary that effectively prepare you to do so.

Introduction 
xxiii    
Before You Begin    At the beginning of the book (right after this introduction) is an assess-
ment test you can use to check your readiness for the certification exams. Take this test 
before you start reading the book; it will help you determine the areas you may need to 
brush up on. The answers to the assessment test appear on a separate page after the last 
question of the test. Each answer includes an explanation, shows a chapter reference, and 
describes why the other options are incorrect.
Chapter Review Questions    To test your knowledge as you progress through this book, 
there are review questions at the end of each chapter. As you finish each chapter, answer the 
review questions and then check your answers. The correct answers appear in an appendix 
at the back of the book. You can go back and revisit the section that deals with each ques-
tion you answered wrong to ensure that you understand the material and answer correctly 
the next time you are tested on that topic.
Electronic Flashcards    You will find flashcard questions on the book’s companion website 
(www.wiley.com/go/sybextestprep). These are short questions and answers, just like other 
flashcards you may be familiar with and have used in the past. You can answer them on 
your PC or download them onto a tablet, smartphone, or other client device for quick and 
convenient reviewing.
Test Engine    The book’s companion website (www.wiley.com/go/sybextestprep) also 
contains the Sybex Test Engine. With this custom test engine, you can identify weak areas 
up front and then develop a solid studying strategy that includes each of the robust testing 
features described previously. The readme file will walk you through the quick, easy instal-
lation process.
In addition to the assessment test and the chapter review questions, you will find two bonus 
exams. Use the test engine to take these practice exams just as if you were taking an actual 
exam (without any reference material). When you have finished the first exam, move on to 
the next one to solidify your test-taking skills. Getting a high percentage of the answers 
correct is an indication you are ready to take the actual certification exams.
Labs and Exercises    Several chapters in this book have lab exercises that use evaluation 
software that is downloadable from the manufacturer’s website. These exercises will  
provide you with a broader learning experience by providing hands-on experience and  
step-by-step problem solving.
The Certification Exams Are Based on the Exam Objectives
It is important to note that in order to pass the certification exam, you should study from 
the currently posted exam objectives. Use this book as a learning aid to understand the 
exam objectives. For the most up-to-date certification exam objectives, visit the CWNP 
website at www.cwnp.com.

Introduction    
CWNP Exam Terminology
The CWNP program uses specific terminology when phrasing the questions on any of the 
CWNP exams. The terminology used most often mirrors the language that is used in the 
IEEE 802.11 standard. While technically correct, the terminology used in the exam ques-
tions often is not the same as the marketing terminology that is used by the Wi-Fi Alliance 
or the manufacturers of WLAN equipment.
As of this writing, the most current IEEE version of the 802.11 standard is the IEEE 
802.11-2016 document, which includes all the amendments that have been ratified since the 
IEEE 802.11-2012 standard. Standards bodies such as the IEEE often create several amend-
ments to a standard before “rolling up” the ratified amendments (finalized or approved ver-
sions) into a new standard.
For example, you might already be familiar with the term 802.11g, which is a rati-
fied amendment that has now been integrated into the IEEE 802.11-2016 standard. The 
technology that was originally defined by the 802.11g amendment is called Extended 
Rate Physical (ERP). Although the name 802.11g effectively remains the more commonly 
used marketing terminology, exam questions may use the technical term ERP instead of 
802.11g. A document with exam terms is available from the CWNP website. At the time of 
this writing, the URL to access this document is www.cwnp.com/uploads/misc/cwnp_exam_
terms.pdf.
CWTS, CWS, and CWT Exam Objectives
The CWTS, CWS, and CWT certifications, covering the current objectives, will certify that 
successful candidates know the fundamentals of RF behavior, can describe the features and 
functions of wireless components, and have the skills needed to understand and/or install 
and configure wireless network hardware components. A typical CWTS candidate should 
have a basic understanding of data networking concepts.
The skills and knowledge measured by this examination are derived from a survey of 
wireless networking experts and professionals. The results of this survey were used in 
weighing the subject areas and ensuring that the weighting is representative of the relative 
importance of the content.
CWTS, CWS, and CWT Complete Study Guide has been written to cover every exam 
objective at a level appropriate to its exam weighting. The following sections provide a 
breakdown of this book’s exam coverage, showing you the weight of each section.

Answers to Assessment Test
1.	
B, D.  A device driver allows the computer operating system to control the wireless network 
adapter and must be installed in order for the adapter to function. Client utility software 
allows a user to configure the adapter with network specific settings, such as the SSID and 
security settings. Client utility software may be part of the computer operating system or 
third-party software provided by the manufacturer of the adapter. Site survey software and 
signal strength software may be part of the client utility software. AutoConfig is a service 
that runs on a Microsoft Windows computer. For more information, see Chapter 3.
2.	
A, B.  IEEE 802.11 WLAN technology operates at the Layer 1 (Physical) and Layer 2  
(Data Link) layers of the OSI model. The Network layer is responsible for addressing and 
routing of frames and is where IP addresses are used. The Transport layer is responsible for 
connection-oriented or connectionless protocols, and the Application layer is the “interface 
to the user.” For more information, see Chapter 1.
3.	
D.  Local regulatory authorities manage the RF spectrum used in both unlicensed and 
licensed applications. The IEEE creates standards, and the Wi-Fi Alliance certifies devices 
for interoperability. Wireless Ethernet Compatibility Alliance is the former name of the 
Wi-Fi Alliance. For more information, see Chapter 2.
4.	
C.  Controller-managed access points can be centrally managed by a hardware controller. 
Autonomous access points are considered stand-alone devices and require individual man-
agement. Mesh access points require at least two paths for every access point. Controller-
managed access points are not legacy technology, are implemented in very large networks, 
and do not require a separate radio for management functions. For more information, see 
Chapter 3.
5.	
A.  A wireless repeater—which in most cases is a function of an access point—will extend 
the RF cell to allow users at a greater distance to connect. This will have an impact on 
throughput for users connected to the repeater, and this solution is recommended only 
when necessary. For more information, see Chapter 3.
6.	
A.  Some wireless personal networks (WPANs), such as Bluetooth, use FHSS for commu-
nications. This will potentially interfere with IEEE 802.11 wireless networks. DSSS, HR/
DSSS, and ERP-OFDM are all used in WLANs. HR/FHSS does not exist. For more infor-
mation, see Chapter 7.
7.	
A, D.  Passive and active are the two modes in which a manual site survey can be per-
formed. Passive mode monitors all RF, and active mode requires a client association. For 
more information, see Chapter 9.
8.	
C.  Third-party client utilities such as Microsoft’s AutoConfig can be used in either SOHO 
or enterprise implementations. Because this utility is built into the Microsoft Windows 
operating system, it is very common in both types of installations. See Chapter 3 for more 
information.

A, B, C.  The number of devices, applications both hardware and software, and other IEEE 
802.11 wireless networks are technical areas that must be known for a new IEEE 802.11 
WLAN installation. The cost of the equipment does not fall under the technical category. 
For more information, see Chapter 9.
10.	 A.  Most manufacturers that offer utilities for WLAN adapters allow for additional con-
figuration above and beyond the settings that are included with an operating system. Manu-
facturer utilities are not required for the adapter to operate, because some settings can be 
made in the device driver or a third-party client utility. Unless it is specialty client software, 
the utility is usually included with the adapter and is not subject to additional fee. Manufac-
turers’ client software utilities are unique to only those adapters and will not work across 
manufacturers. See Chapter 3 for more information.
11.	 A.  An independent basic service set (IBSS) is an ad hoc network that is used for peer-to-
peer communications. No access points are used in an IBSS implementation. For more 
information, see Chapter 6.
12.	 E.  An omnidirectional antenna has a horizontal radiation pattern of 360 degrees. The 
vertical radiation pattern will vary based on the gain of the antenna. This measurement is 
known as the beamwidth and is used for both horizontal and vertical radiation patterns. 
Beamwidth is measured at the –3dB or half-power point. For more information, see  
Chapter 5.
13.	 E.  802.11n/ac with MIMO can use up to four radios in the 2.4 GHz ISM band (802.11n) 
and up to eight radios the 5 GHz UNII band (802.11ac). 802.11a/g uses one radio per band 
but can use two antennas for diversity. 802.11h is for spectrum management. For more 
information, see Chapter 7.
14.	 C.  The IEEE 802.11g amendment and the 802.11a amendment both support up to 54 Mbps 
maximum data rates. Of the two amendments, however, only 802.11g operates in the  
2.4 GHz ISM band. 802.11b also operates in the 2.4 GHz ISM band but only supports a 
maximum data rate of 11 Mbps. The IEEE 802.11n/ac amendment allows support of up to 
600 Mbps for devices operating in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. IEEE 802.11ac is 5 GHz only. 
For more information, see Chapter 2.
15.	 D.  Both DSSS and HR/DSSS channels are 22 MHz wide. 2.412 GHz and 5.160 GHz is the 
center frequency of some channels used. For more information, see Chapter 7.
16.	 B.  IEEE 802.11g/n networks operate in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. 802.11a networks operate 
in the 5 GHz UNII band. IEEE 802.11ah networks, also known as sub-1G wireless net-
works, will allow for use in the 900 MHz ISM band. For more information, see Chapter 4.
17.	 A.  A local area network (LAN) is usually contained in the same physical area and typically 
bounded by the perimeter of a building. A campus area network (CAN) includes a set of 
interconnected LANs within an office or school campus and is usually within a limited 
geographical area. A wide area network (WAN) mostly consists of point-to-point or point-
to-multipoint connections between two or more LANs. A metropolitan area network 
(MAN) consists of networks that may span from several blocks of buildings to entire cities.

18.	 A, D, G.  SSID hiding, WEP, and MAC filtering are legacy security mechanisms for IEEE 
802.11 wireless networks and should not be used. WPA and WPA 2.0 are Wi-Fi certifica-
tions and are more advanced. Virtual private network (VPN) is a Layer 3 security solution 
typically used for remote access. RBAC is role-based access control. For more information, 
see Chapter 8.
19.	 C, F.  In the 2.4 GHz ISM band, 25 MHz or 5 channels of separation is considered non-
overlapping. Based on the IEEE 802.11-2016 Standard Clause 17, HR/DSSS channels must 
be separated by 25 MHz or greater in order to be considered nonoverlapping. For more 
information, see Chapter 4.
20.	 C.  The number of associated users will affect the capacity of an access point. The fre-
quency range will affect the propagation as well as the output power. Reflections will cause 
multipath in IEEE 802.11a/g networks, but 802.11n/ac networks can benefit from mul-
tipath. For more information, see Chapter 4.
21.	 B.  Low throughput may occur when too many client devices are associated to an access 
point and cause overloading. Load balancing would help to solve this problem. Because of 
DRS, the closer the client device is to an access point, the better the throughput. For more 
information, see Chapter 11.
22.	 B.  An impedance mismatch between connections in a WLAN system will cause VSWR. 
The gain of an antenna is a relative value that has to do with the size or shape of the RF 
pattern emitted. Attenuation of cable adds to the overall loss of the system. For more infor-
mation, see Chapter 5.
23.	 D.  Open system authentication is addressed in the original IEEE 802.11 standard and 
allows a wireless client device to perform an IEEE 802.11 authentication to an access point 
in order to allow an IEEE 802.11 association. Shared-key authentication is legacy and 
flawed, and either cannot or should not be used. Open system authentication is a “null” 
authentication, is automatic and not secure but is required for a client device to connect to 
an access point. For more information, see Chapter 6.
24.	 A.  The SSID is the name that identifies a wireless network. The MAC address of the access 
point radio is the BSSID. For more information, see Chapter 6.
25.	 B.  802.1X is for port-based access control, and the terminology for the access point is 
authenticator. The RADIUS server is the authentication server, and the client device is a sup-
plicant. The RAS server is the predecessor to RADIUS. For more information, see Chapter 8.
26.	 C.  A virtual private network (VPN) solution is a Layer 3 (Network) security solution and is 
commonly used for remote access connectivity from unsecured networks, such as hotspots. 
For more information, see Chapter 8.
27.	 B.  A predictive modeling site survey will minimize the time required on-site for testing 
and analysis. This site survey will be accurate if the information about the location input is 
accurate. A manual site survey requires a walkthrough of the area and can be time consum-
ing. For more information, see Chapter 9.

28.	 B, D.  The number of associated devices is an important determining factor in the number 
of access points required for a WLAN deployment as well as the software and hardware 
applications that may be used. The type and manufacturer of devices are not concerns. For 
more information, see Chapter 9.
29.	 C.  A protocol analyzer will help identify existing IEEE 802.11 WLANs in an area and 
provide other information about these networks that can be used in the RF site survey/
design process. An RF analysis is performed by a spectrum analyzer, which will also help 
locate sources of RF interference. A protocol analyzer can help identify security-related 
issues from existing wireless networks but will not describe security requirements of a new 
WLAN. For more information, see Chapter 9.
30.	 A.  The received signal strength represents how much of a transmitted signal is being 
received. If this signal is weak, the difference between the signal and noise may not be 
high enough to recover the data. If the power on an access point is high, it would provide 
more received signal. A signal-to-noise ratio of 35 dB and RSSI of –60 dBm is more than 
adequate. If the radio on the client were disabled, it would not be able to connect at all. For 
more information, see Chapter 11.
31.	 A, B, D.  WLAN technology operates and is specified at Layer 1 (Physical) and Layer 
2 (Data Link) of the OSI model. The Session layer opens, closes, and manages sessions 
between end-user application processes. The Network layer is responsible for addressing 
and routing functions of data. The Application layer is the interface to the user. For more 
information, see Chapter 1.
32.	 A, E.  The SNR is the difference between the received signal and the noise floor. The com-
mon noise floor value is –95 dBm, and an acceptable receive signal is –65 dBm. Therefore, 
the SNR is 30 dB. The RF channel is a specified frequency a WLAN operates in. The Fres-
nel zone consists of a number of concentric ellipsoidal volumes that surround the direct, RF 
line of sight between two points, such as an RF transmitter and receiver. For more informa-
tion, see Chapter 4.
33.	 A.  Most enterprise-level autonomous access points have the capability to operate in root, 
repeater, or bridge modes. Root mode is the most common. Root mode allows devices to 
authenticate, associate, and access network resources and services. For more information, 
see Chapter 3.
34.	 E.  Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA 2.0) requires CCMP/AES. TKIP/RC4 is optional. WEP/
RC4 is legacy and should not be used; it cannot be used with a robust secure network. RC5 
is a stream cipher and not used with IEEE 802.11 WLANs. CCMP uses AES, not RC4. For 
more information, see Chapter 2.
35.	 D.  CSMA/CA stands for Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance and is used 
as an access method for WLANs to share the communication medium, which is the air. 
CSMA/CD is Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection and is used with Eth-
ernet networks. FHSS/CCK and HR/DSSS are spread-spectrum technologies used with 
some standards or amendments. CSMA/DSSS does not exist. For more information, see 
Chapter 7.

36.	 B.  The technical term for the horizontal radiation pattern is azimuth. The elevation is the 
vertical radiation pattern. For more information, see Chapter 5.
37.	 B.  A beacon frame is a management frame and is used to advertise information about the 
WLAN. For more information, see Chapter 6.
38.	 B.  A consumer-grade Wi-Fi router is a combination of a router and a Wi-Fi access point, 
two different functions contained in the same physical device. Both consumer-grade Wi-Fi 
routers and access points will allow for peer-to-peer communications between the devices 
that are connected to the same access point. Consumer-grade Wi-Fi routers do not offer 
better security options than access points; however, enterprise-grade access points will offer 
more extensive security options, and consumer-grade Wi-Fi routers are usually not able to 
operate with WLAN controllers. For more information, see Chapter 3.
39.	 C.  The best location to install an omnidirectional antenna is in the center of the RF cover-
age area. Access points installed at the perimeter of an RF coverage area would be used for 
location services. A patch/panel antenna would be best installed at one end of the RF cov-
erage area. It is best to avoid hallway installations unless they are justified by the WLAN 
design. For more information, see Chapter 5.
40.	 D.  A spectrum analyzer is used to view RF coverage and interference from non–Wi-Fi 
devices. A protocol analyzer is a tool that can be used to troubleshoot 802.11 WLAN 
problems. Predictive modeling software is used to aid in the design of a WLAN. A voltage 
standing wave ratio (VSWR) meter is used to measure the impedance mismatch of a system. 
Network discovery software is used to find information about 802.11 devices in an area.

✓1.4  Explain the role of Wi-Fi as a network access 
technology

 It is important to have an understanding of basic computer 
networking concepts before you begin exploring the world of 
over-the-air (wireless) networking technology, wireless termi-
nology, and mobility. This chapter looks at various topics surrounding foundational com-
puter networking, including computer network types, computer topologies, the OSI model, 
and network device addressing. It is intended to provide an overview of basic computer 
networking concepts as an introduction for those who need to gain a basic understanding 
or for those already familiar with this technology and want a review of these concepts. 
 You will learn about the various types of wireless networks—including wireless personal 
area networks (WPANs), wireless local area networks (WLANs), wireless metropolitan 
area networks (WMANs), and wireless wide area networks (WWANs)—in Chapter  2 , 
“Wireless Local Area Networking, Standards, and Certifi cations.” 
 Network Types 
 Computer networking technology has evolved at a tremendous pace over the past couple of 
decades, and many people across the world now have some type of exposure to the technol-
ogy. Initially, personal computers were connected, or networked, to share fi les and printers 
and to provide central access to the users’ data. This type of network was usually confi ned 
to a few rooms or within a single building and required some type of cabled  physical infra-
structure. As the need for this technology continued to grow, so did the types of networks. 
Computer networking started with the local area network (LAN) and grew on to bigger and 
better types, including wide area networks (WANs), metropolitan area networks (MANs), 
and others. The following are some of the common networking types in use today: 
 
■
 Local area networks (LANs) 
 
■
 Wide area networks (WANs) 
 
■
 Metropolitan area networks (MANs) 
 
■
 Campus area networks (CANs) 
 
■
 Personal area networks (PANs) 
 
 You may also come across the term  storage area network (SAN) . The SAN 
is basically a separate subnet for offloading large amounts of data used 
within an enterprise network. High-speed connections are used, so the data 
is easily accessible because it appears to be part of the network. The con-
nections are commonly Fibre Channel or iSCSI utilizing the TCP/IP protocol.  

Network Types

Most computer networks today contain some type of wireless connectivity or may 
­consist of mostly wireless connectivity. The need for wireless networking and mobility con-
tinues to be in great demand and is growing at a rapid pace.
The Local Area Network
A local area network (LAN) can be defined as a group of devices connected in a spe-
cific arrangement called a topology. The topology used depends on where the network is 
installed. Some common legacy topologies (such as the bus and ring) and more modern 
topologies (such as the star and mesh) are discussed later in this chapter. LANs are con-
tained in the same physical area and usually are bounded by the perimeter of a room or 
building. In some cases, however, a LAN may span a group of buildings in close proximity 
that share a common physical connection.
Early LANs were used primarily for file and print services. File services enabled users 
to store data securely and provided a centralized location of data for accessibility even 
when the user was physically away from the LAN. This central storage of data also gave 
a network administrator the ability to back up and archive all the saved data for disaster 
recovery purposes. As for print services, it was not cost effective to have a physical printer 
at every desk or for every user, so LANs allowed the use of shared printers for any user 
connected to the LAN. Figure 1.1 illustrates a LAN that includes both wired and wireless 
networking devices.

The Wide Area Network
As computer networking continued to evolve, many businesses and organizations that 
used this type of technology needed to expand the LAN beyond the physical limits of a 
single room or building. These networks covered a larger geographical area and became 
known as wide area networks (WANs). As illustrated in Figure 1.2, WAN connectivity

Chapter 1  ■  Computer Networking Fundamentals  
mostly consists of point-to-point or point-to-multipoint connections between two or more 
LANs. The LANs may span a relatively large geographical area. (Point-to-point and point-
to-multipoint connections are discussed later in this chapter.) The WAN has allowed users 
and organizations to share data files and other resources with a much larger audience than 
a single LAN would.

WANs can use leased lines from telecommunication providers (commonly known as telcos), 
fiber connections, and even wireless connections. The use of wireless for bridging LANs is 
growing at a fast pace because it can often be a cost-effective solution for connecting LANs.
The Metropolitan Area Network
The metropolitan area network (MAN) interconnects devices for access to computer 
resources in a region or area larger than that covered by LANs but yet smaller than the areas 
covered by WANs. A MAN consists of networks that are geographically separated and can 
span from several blocks of buildings to entire cities (see Figure 1.3). MANs include fast

ity that is capable of longer distances and higher capacity than those in a LAN.

MANs allow for connections to outside larger networks such as the Internet. They 
may include cable television, streaming video, and telephone services. Devices and con-
nectivity used with MANs may be owned by a town, county, or other locality, and may 
also include the property of individual companies. Wireless MANs are also becom-
ing a common way to connect the same type of areas but without the physical cabling 
limitations.
The Campus Area Network
A campus area network (CAN) includes a set of interconnected LANs that basically form 
a smaller version of a WAN within a limited geographical area, usually an office or school 
campus. Each building within the campus generally has a separate LAN. The LANs are often 
connected using fiber-optic cable, which provides a greater distance than copper wiring using 
IEEE 802.3 Ethernet technology. However, using wireless connections between the buildings 
in a CAN is an increasingly common way to connect the individual LANs. These wireless 
connections or wireless bridges provide a quick, cost-effective way to connect buildings in a 
university campus, as shown in Figure 1.4.

Fiber optics for network connections
In a university campus environment, a CAN may link many buildings, including all the 
various colleges—such as the College of Business, College of Law, College of Engineering, 
and so on—as well as the university library, administration buildings, and even residence 
halls. Wireless LAN deployments are now commonplace in university residence halls. With 
the rapidly increasing number of wireless mobile devices on university campuses, the num-
ber of wireless access points and the capacity of each need to be considered.
As in the university campus environment, a corporate office CAN may connect all the 
various building LANs that are part of the organization. This type of network will have 
the characteristics of a WAN but be confined to the internal resources of the corporation 
or organization. Many organizations are deploying wireless networks within the corporate 
CAN as a way to connect various parts of the business. As with the university CAN, in 
the corporate world a wireless CAN is a quick, cost-effective way to provide connectivity 
between buildings and departments.
All the physical connection mediums and devices are the property of the office or school 
campus, and responsibility for the maintenance of the equipment lies with the office or 
campus as well.
The Personal Area Network
Personal area networks (PANs) are networks that connect devices within the immediate 
area of individual people. PANs may consist of wired connections, wireless connections, 
or both. On the wired side, this includes universal serial bus (USB) devices such as print-
ers, keyboards, and computer mice that may be connected with a USB hub. With wireless

technology, PANs are short-range computer networks and in many cases use Bluetooth 
wireless technology. Wireless Bluetooth technology is specified by the IEEE 802.15 stan-
dard and is not IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN technology. Bluetooth will be discussed in more 
detail in Chapter 2. Like wired PANs, wireless PANs are commonly used in connecting an 
individual’s wireless personal communication accessories, such as phones, headsets, com-
puter mice, keyboards, tablets, and printers, and are centered on the individual personal 
workspace without the need for physical cabling. Figure 1.5 illustrates a typical wireless 
PAN configuration.

Network Topologies
A computer’s physical network topology is the actual layout or physical design and inter-
connection of a computer network. A topology includes the cabling and devices that are 
part of the network. In the following sections you will learn about several different types of 
network topologies:
■
■
Bus
■
■
Ring
■
■
Star
■
■
Mesh
■
■
Ad hoc
■
■

Chapter 1  ■  Computer Networking Fundamentals  
The bus, ring, star, mesh, and ad hoc topologies are typically what make up the LAN 
you learned about previously. Point-to-point and point-to-multipoint topologies can be 
commonly used for connecting LANs but are mostly used for WAN connections. The size 
of your network will determine which topologies will apply. If your network is a single 
building and not part of a larger corporate network, the LAN topologies may be the extent 
of the technologies used. Once that LAN connects to a different LAN, however, you are 
moving up and scaling to a WAN.
The Bus Topology
A bus topology consists of multiple devices connected along a single shared medium with 
two defined endpoints. It is sometimes referred to as a high-speed linear bus and is a 
single collision domain in which all devices on the bus network receive all messages. Both 
endpoints of a bus topology have a 50-ohm termination device, usually a Bayonet Neill-
Concelman (BNC) connector with a 50-ohm termination resistor. The bus topology was 
commonly used with early LANs but is now considered a legacy design.
One disadvantage to the bus topology is that if any point along the cable is discon-
nected, damaged, or broken, the entire LAN will cease to function. This is because the two 
endpoints communicate only across the single shared medium; there is no alternative route 
for them to use in the event of a problem.
Troubleshooting a bus network is performed by a technique known as the half-split 
method. A network engineer “breaks” or separates the link at about the halfway point 
and measures the resistance of the link on both ends. If the segment measures 50 ohms of 
resistance, there is a good chance that side of the LAN segment is functioning correctly. If 
the resistance measurement is not 50 ohms, it signals a problem with that part of the LAN 
segment. The engineer continues with this method until the exact location of the problem is 
identified. Depending on the length of the segment and the type of installation, this can be 
a time-consuming and tedious process.
Figure 1.6 illustrates an example of the bus topology.

Troubleshooting the Bus Topology
Many years ago I was called to troubleshoot a problem on a small LAN using a bus topol-
ogy. The network consisted of a network file server, about 20 client stations, and a few 
network printers. The users complained of intermittent connection problems with the 
network. After spending some time looking over the network, I decided to test the bus 
using the half-split method and checked to verify that the cable was reporting the correct 
resistance using a volt-ohm-milliammeter (VOM) meter. Sure enough, one side of the 
network cable reported the correct resistance reading, but the other side was giving  
intermittent results.
After spending some time repeating the troubleshooting method, I was able to determine 
the problem. Someone had run the coax (bus) cable underneath a heavy plastic office 
chair mat, and one of the little pegs used to protect the flooring was causing the intermit-
tent connection as it struck the cable when the user moved their chair around the mat. 
I quickly replaced and rerouted the section of cable in question. It is a good thing I was 
there during the normal business operating hours when the person was moving around 
in the chair, or I might have never found the problem. Ah, the joys of troubleshooting a 
bus topology.
The Ring Topology
In the ring topology, each device connects to two other devices, forming a logical ring 
pattern. The ring topology is rarely used with LANs today, but it is still widely used by 
Internet service providers (ISPs) for high-speed, resilient backhaul connections over fiber-
optic links.
Ring topologies in LANs may use a token-passing access method in which data travels 
around the ring in one direction. Only one device at a time will have the opportunity to 
transmit data. Because this access method travels in one direction, it does not need to use 
collision detection and often outperforms the bus topology, achieving higher data transfer 
rates than are possible using a collision detection access method. Each computer on the ring 
topology can act as a repeater, a capacity that allows for a much stronger signal.
The IEEE standard for LANs is IEEE 802.5, specifying Token Ring technology. IEEE 
802.5 Token Ring technology used in LANs was a very efficient method used to connect 
devices, but it was usually more expensive than the bus or star topologies. Because of the 
token-passing method used, early 4 Mbps Token Ring networks could sometimes outper-
form a 10 Mbps IEEE 802.3 collision-based Ethernet network. Token Ring technology 
speeds increased to 16 Mbps but decreased in popularity as Ethernet speeds increased. Even 
though this is a ring topology, devices are connected through a central device and appear to 
be similar to devices on an Ethernet hub or switch. Figure 1.7 shows an example of the ring 
topology.

The Star Topology
The star topology, as shown in Figure 1.8, is the most commonly used method of connecting 
devices on a LAN today. It consists of multiple devices connected by a central connection device. 
Hubs, switches, and wireless access points are all common central connection devices, although 
hubs are rarely used today. The hub provides a single collision domain similar to a bus topology. 
However, the Ethernet switch and wireless access point both have more intelligence—the capa-
bility to decide which port specific network traffic can be sent to. Note that in Figure 1.8, the 
wireless star topology includes an Ethernet switch, which could also have extended devices con-
nected to it with wires. In that sense, it is possible to have a wired/wireless hybrid topology.
A big advantage to the star over the bus and some ring topologies is that if a connection 
is broken or damaged, the entire network does not cease to function; only a single device 
in the star topology is affected. The central connection device, such as a switch or wireless 
access point, can be considered a potential central point of failure.
The Mesh Topology
A device in a mesh network will process its own data as well as serving as a communication 
point for other mesh devices. Each device in a mesh topology (see Figure 1.9) has one or 
more connections to other devices that are part of the mesh network. This approach pro-
vides both network resilience in case of link or device failure and a cost savings compared 
to full redundancy. Mesh technology can operate with both wired and wireless infrastruc-
ture network devices. Wireless mesh networks continue to grow in popularity because of 
the potential uses in various deployment models and the cost savings they provide.

From an IEEE 802.11 wireless perspective, wireless mesh technology has now been 
standardized, although most manufacturers continue to use their proprietary methods. The 
amendment to the IEEE 802.11 standard for mesh networking is 802.11s. This amendment 
was ratified in 2011 and is now part of the latest wireless LAN standard, IEEE 802.11-2016. 
In addition to IEEE 802.11 networks, mesh is also standardized in IEEE 802.15 personal

area networks for use with Zigbee and IEEE 802.16 wireless MAN networks. Wireless 
standards will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 2.
As mentioned earlier, IEEE 802.11 wireless device manufacturers commonly use pro-
prietary Layer 2 routing protocols, forming a self-healing wireless infrastructure (mesh) 
in which edge devices can communicate. Manufacturers of enterprise wireless networking 
infrastructure devices provide support for mesh access points (APs) such that the mesh APs 
connect back to APs that are directly wired into the network backbone infrastructure. The 
APs, wireless LAN controllers or software-based cloud solutions in this case, are used to 
configure both the wired and mesh APs.
Ad Hoc Connections
In the terms of computer networking, the ad hoc network is a collection of devices con-
nected without a design or a plan for the purpose of sharing information or resources. 
Another term for an ad hoc network is peer-to-peer network.
In a wired peer-to-peer network, all computing devices are of equal status. In other 
words, no server manages the access to network resources. All peers can either share their 
own resources or access the resources of their devices on the network.
An ad hoc wireless network is one that does not contain a distribution system, 
which means no wireless access point is contained in the system to provide centralized 
communications.
Figure 1.10 shows an example of a wired peer-to-peer network and a wireless ad hoc 
network.

Point-to-Point Connections
When at least two LANs are connected, it is known as a point-to-point connection 
or link (see Figure 1.11). The connection can be made using either wired or wire-
less network infrastructure devices and can include bridges, wireless access points, 
and routers. Wireless point-to-point links can sometimes extend very long distances 
depending on terrain and other local conditions. Point-to-point links provide a con-
nection between LANs, allowing users from one LAN to access resources on the other 
connected LAN.

Wired point-to-point links consist of fiber-optic connections or leased lines from local 
telecommunication providers. Wireless point-to-point links usually call for semi-directional 
or highly directional antennas. Wireless point-to-point links include directional antennas and 
encryption to protect the wireless data as it propagates through the air from one network to 
the other. With some regulatory domains such as the Federal Communications Commission 
(FCC), when an omnidirectional antenna is used in this configuration it is considered a spe-
cial case, called a point-to-multipoint link.
Point-to-Multipoint Connections
A network infrastructure connecting more than two LANs is known as a point-to-
multipoint connection or link (see Figure 1.12). When used with wireless, this configuration 
usually consists of one omnidirectional antenna and multiple semi-directional or highly

directional antennas. Point-to-multipoint links are often used in campus-style deployments, 
where connections to multiple buildings or locations may be required. Like point-to-point 
connections, wired point-to-multipoint connections can use either direct wired connec-
tions such as fiber-optic cables or leased line connectivity available from telecommunication 
providers.

The OSI Model
Before we continue with other mobility topics, you should have some background on com-
puter networking theory. The basics of a computer networking discussion start with the 
Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, a conceptual seven-layer model. The OSI model 
has been around for decades. It came about in the late 1970s and early 1980s, being pub-
lished in 1984, and was developed by the International Organization for Standardization 
(ISO). The ISO is a worldwide organization that creates standards on an international scale. 
The OSI model describes the basic concept of communications in the computer network 
environment. Be careful not to confuse the two.
There are seven layers to the OSI model. Each layer is made up of many protocols and 
serves a specific function. You will take a quick look at all seven layers of the OSI model. 
Figure 1.13 illustrates the seven layers of the conceptual OSI model.

The following sections describe how each layer is used.
Layer 1 – The Physical Layer
The Physical layer (sometimes referred as the PHY) is the lowest layer in the OSI model. 
The PHY consists of bit-level data streams and computer network hardware connecting 
the devices together. The hardware that connects devices includes network interface cards, 
cables, Ethernet switches, wireless access points, and bridges. Keep in mind that some of 
these hardware devices, such as Ethernet switches and bridges, actually have Data Link 
layer (Layer 2) functionally and operate at that layer but also make up the actual physi-
cal connections. In the case of wireless networking, radio frequency (RF) uses air as the 
medium for wireless communications. With respect to wireless networking, the Physical 
layer consists of two sublayers:
■
■
Physical Layer Convergence Protocol (PLCP)
■
■
Physical Medium Dependent (PMD)
The PLCP, the higher of the two layers, is the interface between the PMD and Media 
Access Control (MAC) sublayer of the Data Link layer. This is where the Physical layer 
header is added to the data. The PMD is the lower sublayer at the bottom of the protocol 
stack and is responsible for transmitting the data onto the wireless medium. Figure 1.14 
shows the two sublayers that make up the Physical layer.

Layer 2 – The Data Link Layer
The Data Link layer is responsible for organizing the bit-level data for communication 
between devices on a network and detecting and correcting Physical layer errors. This layer 
consists of two sublayers:
■
■
Logical Link Control (LLC)
■
■
Media Access Control (MAC)
The bit-level communication is accomplished through Media Access Control (MAC) 
addressing. A MAC address is a unique identifier of each device on the computer network 
and is known as the physical address or sometimes referred to as the hardware address. 
(MAC addresses are discussed later in this chapter.) Figure 1.15 illustrates the two sublay-
ers of the Data Link layer, Layer 2.

Layer 3 – The Network Layer
The Network layer is responsible for addressing and routing data by determining the best 
route to take based on what it has learned or been assigned. The Internet Protocol (IP) 
resides at the Network layer. An IP address is defined as a numerical identifier or logical 
address assigned to a network device. The IP address can be static, manually assigned by 
a user, or dynamically assigned from a server using Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol 
(DHCP). (IP addresses are discussed later in this chapter.) Figure 1.16 illustrates the Layer 2 
MAC address translation to a Layer 3 IP address.

Layer 4 – The Transport Layer
The Transport layer consists of both connection-oriented and connectionless protocols 
providing communications between devices on a computer network. Although several 
protocols operate at this layer, you should be familiar with two commonly used Layer 4 
protocols:
■
■
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
■
■
User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
TCP is a connection-oriented protocol and is used for communications that require reli-
ability, analogous to a circuit-switched telephone call.
UDP is a connectionless protocol and is used for simple communications requiring  
efficiency, analogous to sending a postcard through a mail service. You would not know if 
the postcard was received or not. UDP and TCP port numbers are assigned to applications 
for flow control and error recovery. Figure 1.17 represents the relationship between the 
Transport layer protocols TCP and UDP.

Layer 5 – The Session Layer
The Session layer opens, closes, and manages communications sessions between end-user 
application processes located on different network devices. The following protocols are 
examples of Session layer protocols:
■
■
Network File System (NFS)
■
■
Apple Filing Protocol (AFP)
■
■
Remote Procedure Call Protocol (RPC)
Layer 6 – The Presentation Layer
The Presentation layer provides delivery and formatting of information for processing and 
display. This allows for information that is sent from one device on a network (the source) 
to be understood by another device (the destination) on the network.
Layer 7 – The Application Layer
The Application layer can be considered the interface to the user. Application is another 
term for a program that runs on a computer or other networking device, and that is not 
what we are looking at here. Protocols at this layer are for network operations such as 
transferring files, browsing web pages, and sending email. The following list includes some 
of the more common examples of Application layer protocols we use daily:
■
■
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) for transferring data
■
■
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) for web browsing
■
■
Post Office Protocol v3 (POP3) for email
How the Layers Work Together
In order for computers and other network devices to communicate with one another using 
the OSI model, a communication infrastructure of some type is necessary. In a wired 

The OSI Model 
19  
network, such an infrastructure consists of cables, repeaters, bridges, and Layer 2 switches. 
In a wireless network, the infrastructure consists of access points, bridges, repeaters, radio 
frequency, and the open air. Some of these devices will be discussed in more detail in 
Chapter 3, “Infrastructure and Client Devices Used with Wireless Networking.”
Wireless network technology operates at the two lowest layers of the OSI model, Layer 
1 (Physical) and Layer 2 (Data Link). However, to some degree Layer 3 (Network) plays a 
role as well, generally for the TCP/IP protocol capabilities. It is also important to note that 
wireless networking technology does use all seven layers for certain functionality.
OSI Model Memorization Tip
One common method you can use to remember the seven layers of the OSI model from 
top to bottom is to memorize the following sentence: All people seem to need data pro-
cessing. Take the first letter from each word and that will give you an easy way to remem-
ber the first letter that pertains to each layer of the OSI model.

Peer-Layer Communication
Peer layers communicate with other layers in the OSI model, and the layers underneath are 
their support systems. Peer-layer communication is the “horizontal” link between devices on 
the network. Figure 1.18 shows three examples of peer-layer communication. Keep in mind, 
however, that this principle applies to all seven layers of the OSI model. This allows for the 
layers to communicate with the layer to which a device is sending or receiving information.

The purpose of encapsulation is to allow Application layer data communication between 
two stations on a network using the lower layers as a support system. As data moves down 
the OSI model from the source to the destination, it is encapsulated. As data moves back 
up the OSI model from the source to the destination, it is de-encapsulated. Some layers 
will add a header and/or trailer when information is being transmitted and remove it when 
information is being received. Encapsulation is the method in which lower layers support 
upper layers. Figure 1.19 illustrates this process.

Device Addressing 
21  
Device Addressing
Every device on a network requires unique identification. This can be accomplished in a 
couple of ways:
■
■
Physical addresses
■
■
Logical addresses
The physical address of a network adapter is also known as the Media Access Control 
(MAC) address. As shown in Figure 1.20, every device on a network (like every street 
address in a city) must have a unique address. The physical address is required in order for 
a device to send or receive information (data). An analogy to this is sending a package to be 
delivered via a courier service. Before handing over the package to the courier, you would 
write the name and physical street address of the recipient on the package. This ensures that 
the package is delivered correctly to the recipient.
F i g u r e  1. 2 0    The MAC address is analogous to the address of buildings on a street.
Main Street = LAN 2

Unique Address = 123
10 Main Street
Unique Address = 10
20 Main Street
Unique Address = 20
120 2nd Street
Unique Address = 120
The streets shown—1st, Main, and 2nd—represent local area networks.
The numbers 10, 20, 123, 131, and 120 represent the unique address of each
structure on the streets just as MAC addresses would represent devices on a LAN.
131 2nd Street
Unique Address = 131
1st Street = LAN 1
2nd Street = LAN 3
The logical address is also known as the Internet Protocol (IP) address. Each device on a 
Layer 3 network or subnet must have a unique IP address (like every city’s zip code). The IP 
address can be mapped to the physical address by using the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP).
The streets shown in Figure 1.20—1st, Main, and 2nd—represent LAN subnets. The street 
addresses—10, 20, and so on—represent the unique address of each structure on a street as 
a MAC address would a device on a LAN.

22 
Chapter 1  ■  Computer Networking Fundamentals  
Physical Addressing
The physical address of a network device is called a MAC address because the MAC sub-
layer of the Data Link layer handles media access control. The MAC address is a 6-byte 
(12-character) hexadecimal address in the format AB:CD:EF:12:34:56. The first 3 bytes 
(or octets) of a MAC address are called the organizationally unique identifier (OUI). Some 
manufacturers produce many network devices and therefore require several OUIs. A table 
of all OUIs is freely available from the IEEE Standards Association website at
http://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/oui/oui.txt
MAC addresses are globally unique; an example is shown in Figure 1.21. The first 3 
bytes or octets (6 characters) are issued to manufacturers by the IEEE. The last 3 bytes or 
octets (6 characters) are incrementally assigned to devices by the manufacturer.

The MAC address of a device is usually stamped or printed somewhere on the device. This 
allows the device to be physically identified by the MAC address. By typing the simple com-
mand ipconfig /all in the command-line interface of some operating systems, you can view 
the physical address of the network adapter. Figure 1.22 shows an example of the information 
displayed by using this command-line utility in the Microsoft Windows operating system.

Logical Addressing
Network devices can also be identified by a logical address, known as the Internet Protocol 
(IP) address. The Layer 3 IP protocol works with a Layer 4 transport protocol, either 
User Datagram Protocol (UDP) or Transport layer Protocol (TCP). You learned earlier in 
this chapter that UDP is a connectionless protocol and using it is analogous to sending a 
postcard through the mail. The sender has no way of knowing if the card was received by 
the intended recipient. TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, used for communications 
analogous to a telephone call, and provides guaranteed delivery of data through acknowl-
edgements. During a telephone conversation, communication between two people will be 
confirmed to be intact, with the users acknowledging the conversation. Routable logical 
addresses such as TCP/IP addresses became more popular with the evolution of the Internet 
and the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) that is used with the World Wide Web 
(WWW) service. IP moves data through an internetwork such as the Internet one router (or 
hop) at a time. Each router decides where to send the data based on the logical IP address. 
Figure 1.23 shows a basic network utilizing Layer 3 data traffic.

the form www.xxx.yyy.zzz. Figure 1.24 illustrates an example of a logical Class C, 32-bit 
IP address. Each of the four parts is a byte, or 8 digital bits. There are two main IP address 
types: private addresses and public addresses. Private addresses are unique to an internal 
network, and public addresses are unique to the Internet. These addresses consist of two 
main parts: the network (subnet) and the host (device). Logical addresses also require a 
subnet mask and may have a gateway address depending on whether the network is routed. 
IPv4 addresses fall under three classes: Class A addresses, Class B addresses, and Class C 
addresses.

 The logical IP addresses you just learned about are known as  IPv4 
addresses . Newer addresses, called  IPv6 addresses , also exist and are dis-
cussed in the following section, “Network Address Translation.” 
 Unlike a MAC address, an  IP address is logical and can be either specifi ed as a static address 
assigned to the device manually by the user or dynamically assigned by a server. However, the 
same command-line utility used to identify the physical address of a device can be used to iden-
tify the logical address of a device. Typing  ipconfig at a command prompt displays the logi-
cal address, including the IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway (router) of the device. 
The  ipconfig /all command, illustrated earlier in the chapter, yields additional information, 
including the physical or MAC address of the device’s network adapter. This command is for a 
computer using the Microsoft Windows operating system. For some Apple and Linux devices, 
the  ifconfig command will yield similar information. Figure  1.25 shows the  ipconfig utility 
displaying the logical address information, including the IP address and subnet mask.

 In Exercise 1.1, you will use the  ipconfig utility from a command prompt on a com-
puter using the Microsoft Windows operating system. This will allow you to see the 
address information for any available network adapters within the device. 
 
 Exercise 1.1 was written using a computer with the Microsoft Windows 
10 operating system. If you’re using a different version of the operating 
system, the steps may vary slightly. Keep in mind that there are many dif-
ferent shortcuts and ways to get to a command prompt in the Microsoft 
operating systems. The steps in this exercise use one common method.

 Network Address Translation 
 In the mid-1990s, the use of the Internet along with the TCP/IP protocols was fueled by the 
release of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and the World Wide Web. The heavily 
used Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) of assigning IP addresses was in jeopardy because 

26 
Chapter 1  ■  Computer Networking Fundamentals  
of the increased use of TCP/IP networks. Because the IPv4 mechanism has a finite number 
of addresses, there was a possibility of running out of IP addresses. Table 1.1 shows the 
­number of IPV4 addresses available based on the IP address class.

Newer technology, Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6), was the answer to the IPv4 
address limitation issue. As you learned earlier in this chapter, IPv4 uses 32-bit binary 
addresses; there is a limit to the number of possible public addresses, as shown in Table 1.1. 
Keep in mind that all the Class A addresses were reserved by organizations and companies 
early on and therefore not available to the general public. The IPv6 method of addressing 
new IP technology is what was going to solve the problem of IP address exhaustion. IPv6 
uses 128 bits (2128), which equates to a potential 3.4 × 1038 IP addresses. That’s a lot of 
IP addresses. The switch to IPv6 would not be an easy task. Computer operating systems, 
servers, and network infrastructure hardware lacked support for IPv6, causing delays in the 
implementation.
So why all this discussion about IP addresses or potential lack thereof? Well, this is 
where Network Address Translation (NAT) technology comes into action. NAT allows 
the use of a private IP address network for internal use and mapping it to a single public 
IP address connected to the Internet. This is accomplished by modifying the header in the 
IPv4 packet, which is where the term address translation comes in. NAT allows for a home 
network, a very small organization, or even a very large organization to be represented by 
a single public IP address on the Internet. It is addressed in RFC 2663 and allowed for the 
continued use of IPv4 addresses. NAT consists of different implementations. The following 
are two common implementations:
■
■
One-to-one NAT
■
■
One-to-many NAT
One-to-one NAT will map an IP address on the outside to an IP address on the inside. 
This can be accomplished through either a static assignment or a dynamic assignment. The 
static NAT entry is a permanent entry and needs to change manually. The dynamic pro-
cess is useful when there are a limited number of addresses and the one-to-one assignment 
occurs when needed.
One-to-many NAT allows for the translation of one single public IP address on the out-
side of a network to service many devices with private IP addresses on the inside network. 

Summary 
27  
This is accomplished by modifying the information in the IP packet. Figure 1.26 shows 
how NAT on a DSL router or cable modem will provide IP address translation. Notice 
that the private IP addresses on the private side of the router in this example are in the 
192.168.0.X range. These private IP addresses will be translated to the single public IP 
address 172.10.5.20 on the public-facing side.

The next fundamental networking concept discussed was computer network topologies. 
You learned about network topologies ranging from the legacy high-speed linear bus and 
ring to the current star topology, the most common topology used today with both wired 
and wireless networks. You looked at the following various topologies:
■
■
Bus
■
■
Ring
■
■
Star
■
■
Mesh
■
■
Ad hoc
■
■
Point-to-point
■
■
Point-to-multipoint
You then reviewed the basics and different layers of the OSI model, including a brief 
overview of each layer illustrating the different protocols and sublayers where applicable. 
Then the chapter discussed the basics of peer communications and data encapsulation.
The chapter’s final topic was device addressing. You explored the concepts of physical 
(MAC sublayer) and logical (Network layer) addressing, including the IP address and sub-
net mask. A simple exercise using a computer with the Microsoft Windows operating sys-
tem showed how to view device addressing information.
Exam Essentials
Understand the components of a local area network (LAN).    A LAN is a group of comput-
ers connected by a physical medium in a specific arrangement called a topology.
Know the different types of networks.    The basic networks types are LAN, WAN, CAN, 
MAN, and PAN.
Become familiar with various networking topologies.    Bus, star, ring, mesh, and ad hoc 
are some of the topologies used in computer networking. Bus is considered a legacy topol-
ogy, whereas star is one of the most common topologies in use today.
Understand point-to-point and point-to-multipoint connections.    These connect two or 
more LANs and can consist of both wired and wireless connections.
Understand the basics of the OSI model.    Know that each of the seven layers of the OSI 
model serves a specific function.

Exam Essentials 
29  
Remember the details of the lower two layers of the OSI model.    The Physical layer and 
Data Link layer are the two lowest layers of the OSI model. Wireless networking technol-
ogy operates at these layers. The Data Link layer consists of two sublayers: the Logical 
Link Control (LLC) sublayer and the Media Access Control (MAC) sublayer. The Physical 
Layer consists of two sublayers: the Physical Layer Convergence Protocol (PLCP) sublayer 
and the Physical Medium Dependent (PMD) sublayer.
Understand device addressing.    Devices are assigned a unique physical address by the 
manufacturer. This address is known as the MAC address. MAC addresses consist of two 
parts, the organizationally unique identifier (OUI) and the unique physical address. A logi-
cal address may also be assigned at the Network layer to identify devices on different inter-
networks using the Internet Protocol (IP).

IEEE 802.11 wireless computer networking continues to take 
computer communication to a new level. This communica-
tion technology is the combination of computer local area 
networking (LAN) and radio frequency (RF) technology. By combining these two technolo-
gies, computer users have the opportunity to access and share information in ways that 
would seem unattainable not too many years ago.
This chapter will examine various ways in which wireless local networks are used and 
deployed. We will also cover organizations that determine the use of RF and those responsible 
for creating and managing WLAN standards. We’ll look in detail at the IEEE 802.11 standard 
and its amendments, illustrating the communications and functional aspects. Finally, we will 
discuss interoperability certifications for IEEE 802.11 wireless networks for communications, 
quality of service (QoS), and security that are available from the Wi-Fi Alliance.
The Wireless Computer Network
The main objective of this book is to provide an introduction to IEEE 802.11-based 
wireless computer networking, following the “what it is not how it works” philosophy. 
However, it is important to understand the various ways in which wireless fits with com-
puter networking in general and the various physical applications. In this section, we will 
take a look at how wireless technology allows users to connect to and use resources in a 
wireless networking environment. Wireless networks come in a variety of types and sizes 
and include the following wireless topologies:
■
■
Wireless personal area network (WPAN)
■
■
Wireless local area network (WLAN)
■
■
Wireless metropolitan area network (WMAN)
■
■
Wireless wide area network (WWAN)
In Chapter 1, “Computer Networking Fundamentals,” you learned about the different 
types of computer networks. You will now look at some of these network types from a 
wireless perspective.
The Wireless Personal Area Network
The personal area network (PAN) is a network that connects devices within the immedi-
ate area of individual people, as you saw in Chapter 1. With the use of wireless technology, 
PANs have evolved into the wireless personal area network (WPAN). This type of network 

The Wireless Computer Network 
37  
allows users to connect various devices wirelessly to their own personal area network, 
including but not limited to computer keyboards, mice, and headsets.
Bluetooth technology is the most popular type of WPAN and uses frequency-hopping 
spread spectrum (FHSS) for communications. Bluetooth falls under the IEEE 802.15 stan-
dard, which specifies the WPAN standards. Bluetooth devices operate in the unlicensed 
2.4 GHz Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) band, as do WLANs. The effects of 
FHSS and Bluetooth on a WLAN will be discussed further in Chapter 7, “Modulation 
Technology for Wireless Networking.”
WPANs may also use infrared technology, which uses near-visible light in the 850 nano-
meters to 950 nanometers range for communications. Infrared technology was specified in 
the original 802.11 standard, was considered obsolete in the 2012 version of the standard, 
and has since been removed from the latest version of the standard, IEEE 802.11-2016.
The Wireless Local Area Network
As you learned in Chapter 1, local area networks (LANs) can be defined as a group of 
computers connected by a physical medium in a specific arrangement called a topology. 
LANs are contained in the same physical area and usually are bounded by the perimeter 
of a building or a group of buildings. Wireless local area networks (WLANs) fall under 
the same description as a LAN but do not require a physical wire to connect devices 
together. WLANs have been in existence for many years, even prior to IEEE 802.11 
standards-based technology, and mostly included proprietary technology or government 
deployments.
Since the IEEE released the original 802.11 standard in 1997, WLAN technology 
has continued to excel and is becoming a major component of every computer network. 
WLANs can operate in either the licensed or unlicensed RF spectrum. The most com-
monly used frequency spectra for WLANs are the unlicensed 2.4 GHz ISM band and 
the unlicensed 5 GHz Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure (UNII) band. The 
frequency bands used with IEEE 802.11 wireless networking are discussed in this chap-
ter in the “RF Regulatory Domain Governing Bodies and Local Regulatory Authorities” 
section.
The Wireless Metropolitan Area Network
Metropolitan area networks (MANs) consist of networks that may span from several 
blocks of buildings to entire cities, and interconnect devices for access to computer 
resources in a region or area larger than that covered by LANs but smaller than the areas 
covered by WANs. You learned about this network type in Chapter 1. You can expand on 
this technology and add much flexibility to MANs by incorporating wireless technology 
and creating a wireless metropolitan area network (WMAN). The IEEE 802.16 standard 
was developed to address this type of wireless network. This technology may fall under the 
Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) category and addresses differ-
ent technologies. The WMAN may include a combination of public and private entities that 
encompass town services such as police, fire, and public utility access.

 WiMAX has had its share of ups and downs. One major provider, Clearwire 
Inc., was a major player in the US market and was working on large-scale 
deployments throughout the United States. Although they previously had 
part ownership, Sprint acquired 100 percent of Clearwire in June 2013. 
Since that time, Sprint has been shifting from the WiMAX side in favor of 
building its own LTE network or fail-back to 3G. In November 2015 Sprint 
ceased operations of the Sprint 4G (WiMAX) network. The use of WiMAX 
networks worldwide have been decreasing since that time. 
 The Wireless Wide Area Network 
 You know from Chapter  1 that a WAN consists of point-to-point or point-to-multipoint 
connections between two or more LANs. WANs can extend very long distances through 
the use of fi ber-optic connections or leased lines from telecommunications providers. When 
it comes to the wireless wide area network (WWAN), this extends beyond the point of con-
necting LANs together. The WWAN will encompass very large geographical areas and may 
include different wireless technologies, including cellular. 
 The WWAN also provides wireless broadband communications for Internet access 
through the use of special external adapters or even adapters built into notebook computers 
or other mobile devices, including smart phone technology. Because of the technology used, 
performance such as data rates will be lower than that expected and realized with IEEE 
802.11 wireless networking. 
 Building-to-Building Connectivity Using 
Wireless LAN Technology 
 Connecting two or more wired LANs together over some distance is often necessary in 
computer networking. Depending on the topology, this can be an expensive and time- 
consuming task. WLAN technology is often used as an alternative to copper cable, fi ber 
optics, or leased line connectivity between buildings. Whether connecting two or multiple 
locations together, point-to-point or point-to-multipoint links can be a quick and cost-
effective solution for building-to-building connectivity. 
 Antenna selection plays an important role in this type of connectivity and will be discussed 
further in Chapter  5 , “Antenna Technology for Wireless Networking.” Other factors to con-
sider in either point-to-point or point-to-multipoint connections are the RF band used and the 
distance, both of which will determine whether a link is feasible for a wireless connection.  
 Wireless Point-to-Point Connections 
 As discussed in Chapter  1 , connecting at least two wired LANs together is known as a  point-
to-point connection . Wireless point-to-point connections can provide long-range coverage

depending on terrain and other local conditions. These links can serve both wired and wire-
less users on the connected LANs. Wireless point-to-point connections typically call for 
semi-directional or highly directional antennas. With some regulatory agencies, when an 
omnidirectional antenna is used in this configuration, it is considered a special case, called a 
point-to-multipoint connection. Correct antenna selection is important and will be discussed 
in more detail in Chapter 5. Figure 2.1 shows a wireless point-to-point connection.

Wireless Point-to-Multipoint Connections
As you learned in Chapter 1, a network connecting more than two LANs together is 
known as a point-to-multipoint connection. With wireless networking, this configuration 
usually consists of one omnidirectional antenna and multiple semi- or highly directional 
antennas (see Figure 2.2). Point-to-multipoint connections are often used in campus-style 
deployments where connections to multiple buildings or locations may be required.

Wireless point-to-point and point-to-multipoint connections are becoming more com-
mon with many IEEE 802.11 WLAN deployments, thanks to the low cost of the equipment 
and the ease of installation. The installation time for a wireless point-to-point connection 
can be as little as a few hours.

 Radio Frequency Regulatory Domain 
Governing Bodies and Local Regulatory 
Authorities 
 Wireless networks use radio frequency (RF) to communicate. The RF spectrum needs to 
be regulated in order to ensure correct use of the allocated frequency bands. At the global 
level, the International Telecommunication Union-Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R) 
is responsible for global management of RF spectrum, in addition to satellite orbits. This 
organization currently has more than 700 private sector members and 70 academia mem-
bers from more than 190 member states. It manages three different administrative regions 
around the globe. 
 Figure  2.3 shows the three administration regions and the geographic area they 
encompass.

 United States: Federal Communications Commission 
 The  local regulatory authority that manages RF spectrum for the United States is the 
Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The FCC, founded in 1934, is (along with 
other local regulatory authorities) responsible for regulating the licensed and unlicensed 
RF spectrum. IEEE 802.11 wireless networks may use licensed or unlicensed frequencies 
for communication between devices. A benefi t of using unlicensed RF spectrum is no cost 
to the end user. The IEEE commonly uses two of three unlicensed RF bands allowed by 
the FCC: 
 
■
 2.4 GHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band 
 
■
 5 GHz Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure (UNII) band 
 I will further discuss this and other technical details of standards-based wireless 
communications in Chapter  6 , “Communication for Wireless Networking.” 
 
 The FCC also allows the use of the unlicensed 900 MHz ISM band, but it is 
currently not used with IEEE 802.11 wireless networking. The 902-928 MHz 
ISM unlicensed band is not available worldwide and is only available in 
Region 2 (the Americas), with a few exceptions. Therefore, it was not 
specified for use with IEEE 802.11 wireless networking. However, this will 
soon change with the recent ratification of the IEEE 802.11ah amendment, 
which will allow WLAN use in what is also known as the Sub 1 GHz band. 
 Licensed RF Bands Used with IEEE 802.11 
 The following two licensed bands can be used with IEEE 802.11 networking: 
 
■
 3.650-3.700 GHz band 
 
■
 4.940-4.990 GHz public safety band 
 In 2008 the IEEE ratifi ed the IEEE 802.11y amendment to the standard. This amend-
ment allows for the use of high-powered WLAN equipment to operate in the 3.650-3.700 
GHz band. Within the United States this is a licensed band that requires the user to pay 
some type of licensing fees. 

42 
Chapter 2 ■ Wireless Local Area Networking, Standards, and Certifications
 The IEEE 802.11-2016 standard also specifi es the use of the 4.940-4.990 GHz public 
safety band for use within the United States, consisting of 5 MHz-, 10 MHz-, and 
20 MHz-wide channels with both high and low power limits. This is a carry-over from 
the previous version of the standard.

 Europe: European Telecommunications 
Standards Institute 
 The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) is responsible for produc-
ing standards for information and communications technologies, including fi xed, mobile, 
radio, converged, broadcast, and Internet technologies in Europe. ETSI was created by the 
European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT) in 1988. 
 In Europe, RF use is managed by CEPT, which develops guidelines and provides 
national administrations with tools for coordinated European RF spectrum management. 
 The IEEE 
 The  IEEE (originally known as the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers), pro-
nounced “eye triple E,” is a nonprofi t organization responsible for generating a variety of 
technology standards, including those related to information technology. According to the 
mission statement on the IEEE’s website, its core purpose is to foster technological innova-
tion and excellence for the benefi t of humanity. The IEEE is the world’s largest technical 
professional society. 
 Since 1997 the IEEE has released a series of standards related to wireless local area net-
working. These standards are all named IEEE 802 followed by combinations of numbers 
and letters to defi ne specifi c standards and amendments. 
 The IEEE consists of working groups that are made up of individual members and 
experts in the fi eld. With respect to wireless technology, the IEEE working groups are as 
follows: 
 
■
 IEEE 802.11 – Wireless local area networking 
 
■
 IEEE 802.15 – Wireless personal area networking 
 
■
 IEEE 802.16 – Broadband wireless metropolitan area networks 
 
■
 IEEE 802.20 – Mobile broadband wireless access 
 
■
 IEEE 802.22 – Wireless regional area networks 
 The main focus of this book is related to IEEE 802.11 wireless local area networking.

 The following section describes the IEEE wireless networking standard and the 
amendments in the order in which they were ratifi ed and released. The IEEE wireless 
networking standard and its amendments that identify advancements in the technol-
ogy defi ne the power, range, and speed of RF and WLAN technology. The IEEE 802.11 
standard specifi es the maximum amount of RF transmit power, the allowed RF spectrum 
(which is related to the range), and the allowed data rates or speed. All ratifi ed IEEE 
802.11 amendments have been incorporated into the IEEE 802.11-2016 standard, includ-
ing the most recent amendments IEEE 802.11ac, IEEE 802.11ad, and a few others. Even 
though some are now legacy amendments, it is important to understand the foundation 
and advancements in standards-based wireless technology that have developed into the 
current system.  
 The IEEE 802.11 Standard 
 The  IEEE 802.11 standard, released in 1997, is what initially defi ned the WLAN communi-
cation standards. The data rates used in this original standard (1 and 2 Mbps) are considered 
slow compared to today’s technology. 
 
 As of this writing, the IEEE 802.11-2016 standard is the most current ratified 
IEEE 802.11 standard. This latest version combines into one document the 
more recent versions, including the IEEE 802.11-2012 and IEEE 802.11-2007 
standards, and outstanding amendments at the time of ratification, such as 
IEEE 802.11k/n/p/r/s/u/v/w/y/z, and now also IEEE 802.11aa/ac/ad/ae/af/ah. Many 
in the industry, however, still refer to the original names of the amend-
ments: 802.11b, 802.11a, 802.11g, 802.11n, and so on. The IEEE considers 
all the previously published amendments and revisions retired as a result 
of the release of the IEEE 802.11-2016 standard. Device and application 
requirements for IEEE 802.11 are discussed in Chapter  4 , “Radio Frequency 
Fundamentals for Wireless Networking.” 
 Here are the frequency range, spread spectrum/Physical layer (PHY) technologies, and 
data rates for the IEEE 802.11-1997 standard: 
 
■
 2.4 GHz ISM band 
 
■
 Frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) 
 
■
 Direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) 
 
■
 Infrared (IR) 
 
■
 1 and 2 Mbps 

44 
Chapter 2 ■ Wireless Local Area Networking, Standards, and Certifications
 FHSS is considered obsolete technology with regard to IEEE 802.11 wireless network-
ing; however, it is still used in other wireless technologies, such as IEEE 802.15 Bluetooth 
devices, other wireless devices, and wireless cordless public switched telephone network 
(PSTN) telephones. References to FHSS were removed from the IEEE 802.11-2016 ver-
sion of the standard. You will learn more about these Physical layer technologies in 
Chapter  7 .

ments, visit the Official IEEE 802.11 Working Group Project Timelines web 
page at  www.ieee802.org/11/Reports/802.11_Timelines.htm. 
 
 The abbreviations described in this section—such as FHSS, DSSS, HR/DSSS, 
OFDM, ERP, HT, and VHT—are defined to help explain the details of each 
amendment to the standard. You will learn more about each of these 
Physical layer technologies in Chapter  7 . 
 The IEEE 802.11a Amendment 
 This amendment to the IEEE 802.11 standard defi ned operation in the 5 GHz UNII band. 
(UNII stands for Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure.) Released in 1999, this 
amendment originally defi ned three frequency ranges in three bands: UNII-1, UNII-2, and 
UNII-3. The UNII-1 band is intended for indoor use only; the UNII-2 band is for indoor 
or outdoor use; and the UNII-3 band may be used indoors or outdoors but was most com-
monly used outdoors. The data rates for IEEE 802.11a are up to 54 Mbps using orthogonal 
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). OFDM and other Physical layer technologies will 
be discussed in Chapter  7 . Although this amendment was released in 1999, devices were not 
widely available until 2001. 
 Following are the frequency ranges, PHY technology, and data rates as specifi ed in the 
original  IEEE 802.11a amendment. (Keep in mind that due to relaxed local regulatory 
requirements, different data rates are often used and accepted.)

Data Rates
 A benefi t to using the 5 GHz UNII band is that more bandwidth is available compared to 
the 2.4 GHz ISM band and there is less interference because not all wireless devices support 
operation in this band. The 5 GHz UNII band supports up to 25 non-overlapping 20 MHz-
wide channels compared to only three non-overlapping channels in the 2.4 GHz ISM band, 
thus providing more available and usable 5 GHz frequency. Currently, fewer devices use the 
5 GHz UNII license-free band than use the 2.4 GHz ISM license-free band, including non-
802.11 devices. However, the number of wireless devices that operate in the 5 GHz band is 
always increasing. Fewer devices using the band means less interference, which allows for 
increased performance and reliability. With the introduction of the IEEE 802.11ac amend-
ment, the number of devices using the 5 GHz band will continue to grow, because this is the 
only band supported for that technology. IEEE 802.11ac is discussed later in this chapter. 
 
 Since the IEEE 802.11a amendment was ratified, some changes have been 
implemented and are now addressed in the IEEE 802.11-2016 standard and 
previously the 802.11-2012 standard. They include a new frequency range 
(5.470-5.725 GHz) that is allowed by some local regulatory agencies and 
is known as the  UNII-2e band . This extra frequency space allows for 11 
additional 20 MHz-wide non-overlapping channels. The new IEEE 802.11ac 
amendment added one more channel (channel number 144) to the 5 GHz 
UNII band, which now provides a total of 25 non-overlapping channels, 
including channel number 165 (Americas only), which was previously iden-
tified as an ISM channel. 
 The IEEE 802.11b Amendment 
 The IEEE 802.11b amendment to the 802.11 standard works in the 2.4-2.5 GHz ISM band. 
This amendment, released in 1999, specifi es high rate DSSS (HR/DSSS) for 5.5 and 11 Mbps. 

46 
Chapter 2 ■ Wireless Local Area Networking, Standards, and Certifications
 
 The IEEE 802.11b amendment was released before the IEEE 802.11a 
amendment, although both were released in 1999. 
 Here are the frequency range, Physical layer (PHY) technology, spread spectrum technology, 
and data rates for the  IEEE 802.11b amendment: 
 
■
 2.4 GHz ISM band 
 
■
 2.4 GHz-2.4835 GHz in North America, China, and Europe (excluding Spain and 
France) 
 
■
 Direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) 
 
■
 High rate-direct sequence spread spectrum (HR/DSSS) 
 
■
 5.5 and 11 Mbps 
 
■
 Backward compatible to 802.11 DSSS for 1 and 2 Mbps 
 With the release of the IEEE 802.11b amendment, WLAN technology became more 
affordable and mainstream. This amendment introduced two higher-rate data speeds, 
5.5 and 11 Mbps, making the technology more desirable. Today, wireless infrastructure 
device manufacturers still support IEEE 802.11b wireless technology; however, it is highly 
unlikely you would be able to purchase any new devices that support only IEEE 802.11b 
technology. As wireless technologies continue to evolve, it is doubtful that there are any 
IEEE 802.11b-only networks, and many organizations are no longer supporting this legacy 
technology at all and are disabling the capability within their systems. Devices sold today 
that operate in the 2.4 GHz ISM band will support IEEE 802.11b/g/n and may be marketed 
as such or as IEEE 802.11g/n, which implies support for IEEE 802.11b. 
 The IEEE 802.11g Amendment 
 This amendment to the IEEE 802.11 standard was released in 2003. Like 802.11 and 
802.11b, it operates in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. This amendment addresses extended data 
rates with OFDM technology and is backward-compatible to 802.11 and 802.11b. 
 Here are the frequency range, PHY technology, spread spectrum technology, and data 
rates for the  IEEE 802.11g amendment: 
 
■
 2.4 GHz ISM band 
 
■
 2.4 GHz-2.4835 GHz in North America, China, and Europe (excluding Spain and France) 
 
■
 Direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) 
 
■
 High rate-direct sequence spread spectrum (HR/DSSS) 
 
■
 Extended rate physical-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (ERP-OFDM) 
 
■

■
 1 and 2 Mbps (compatible with DSSS) 
 
■
 5.5 and 11 Mbps complementary code keying (CCK; compatible with HR/DSSS) 
 
■
 6, 12, 24 Mbps OFDM required data rates 
 
■
 9, 18, 36, 48, and 54 Mbps OFDM data rates supported but not required

IEEE 802.11b/g
Data Rates
 IEEE 802.11g is backward-compatible to 802.11 and 802.11b because it operates in the 
same 2.4 GHz ISM license-free band and supports the same access methods or technology 
as 802.11b. One benefi t of IEEE 802.11g compatibility was that many established network 
infrastructures and devices have used 802.11 and 802.11b for years. This allowed them to 
continue to operate as normal with upgrades or replacement as appropriate or necessary. 
 
 To allow the slower DSSS and HR/DSSS data rates of 1, 2, 5.5, and 11 Mbps 
to operate in an IEEE 802.11g/n network, the amendment addresses the use 
of “protection mechanisms.” These protection mechanisms will decrease 
the throughput of IEEE 802.11g/n clients to some degree when IEEE 802.11b 
radios are present in the basic service area (BSA). This is because when 
802.11b and 802.11g/n devices are connected to the same access point, RTS 
and CTS or CTS-to-self-control frames are used to lessen the chances of 
data collisions by reserving the medium for a specific period of time. 
 Many organizations have dropped support for IEEE 802.11b devices completely. This 
is accomplished by disabling the 802.11b data rates on the infrastructure devices—access 
points, controllers, cloud managed solutions, and so on. They do this to minimize per-
formance issues such as throughput when IEEE 802.11b devices are present in the IEEE 
802.11g/n BSA. In some deployment scenarios, such as public wireless hotspots or areas 
with wireless guest networks, it would be diffi cult to disallow the use of IEEE 802.11b 
devices. However, this is becoming more common and strictly a decision to be made by the 
organization and information technology staff.

Chapter 2  ■  Wireless Local Area Networking, Standards, and Certifications  
Maximizing Throughput in an IEEE 802.11g/n Network
In certain cases, the only way to maximize the throughput of an 802.11g/n network is to 
set the data rates of the access points to support 802.11g/n data rates only. The trade-off 
is that 802.11b devices will not be able to connect to the network, because the access 
point will not recognize the 802.11b data rates. With the newer technology available 
today, turning off support for 802.11b is becoming less of a concern. This would work 
well where backward compatibility to 802.11b is not required and all equipment in use 
supports 802.11g/n. An analogy would be a group of individuals all speaking one lan-
guage. They all understand the same language, so they have no need to accommodate a 
second language.
Because of protection mechanisms defined in the 802.11g amendment, throughput will 
degrade in an 802.11b/g/n mixed mode environment when 802.11b devices are present. 
The 802.11b devices have a maximum data rate of 11 Mbps (HR/DSSS), and they share 
the medium with the 802.11g/n devices that have a maximum data rate of 54 Mbps (ERP-
OFDM) or higher. Think of the language analogy. If a group of individuals is speaking two 
different languages, a translator may be required for complete communication. A discus-
sion among the group would take longer, because the translator would need to translate 
the languages. Likewise, protection mechanisms will have an impact on the throughput 
for the 802.11g/n devices, since the 2.4 GHz medium is shared. If there are no 802.11b 
devices in the radio range of an access point in an 802.11b/g/n mixed mode environment, 
protection mechanisms should not affect throughput since the access point will not have 
to share the medium with the two different technologies, ERP-OFDM and HR/DSSS.
If you do not have any 802.11b devices on your network, you can set your access point to 
802.11g/n mode by disabling the 802.11b data rates. In this configuration, your 802.11g/n 
devices will perform better, because protection mechanisms will not be enabled. How-
ever, if there are any 802.11b devices that don’t belong to your network in the “listening” 
range of the access point, data collisions will increase at the access point. This is because 
802.11b and 802.11g/n operate in the same RF range, and the 802.11g/n (ERP-OFDM) 
access point would stop listening to the 802.11b (HR/DSSS) transmissions. (It would sim-
ply see them as RF noise.) In this configuration, overall throughput will still exceed that 
of an access point set to 802.11b/g/n mixed mode in the presence of 802.11b devices. The 
access point will hear the 802.11b transmissions, but they will not be serviced since they 
are only seen as RF noise; thus, they will have less impact on throughput. Also, when an 
802.11g/n access point “hears” beacon management frames from a neighboring access 
point that is either an 802.11b access point or 802.11g/n access point in protection mode, it 
will cause the access point to also enter a protection mode state. This is because a “non-
member” protection mode caused by neighboring access points on the same RF channel 
containing the protection mode requirements in their beacon frames will force the access 
point to also be in a protection mode state.

The IEEE 802.11n Amendment
After several years of drafts, the IEEE 802.11n amendment was finally approved in 
September 2009. The release of this document opened the doors for manufacturers of  
IEEE 802.11 WLAN equipment, giving them the opportunity to move forward with new 
technology that allows for better performance, higher throughput, and several other ben-
efits. Wi-Fi certified devices under 802.11n draft 2.0 were available for several years prior 
to the ratification of IEEE 802.11n. Most if not all enterprise manufacturers had at least 
one wireless infrastructure device certified under draft 2.0 by the Wi-Fi Alliance prior to 
the release of the new amendment.
Here are the frequency ranges, PHY technologies, data rates, and other details for the 
IEEE 802.11n amendment:
■
■
2.4 GHz ISM band
■
■
5 GHz UNII band
■
■
Multiple-input multiple-output technology (MIMO)

Chapter 2  ■  Wireless Local Area Networking, Standards, and Certifications  
IEEE 802.11n devices are capable of operating in both unlicensed frequency bands, the 
2.4 GHz ISM band and the 5 GHz UNII band. This means that they must be backward-
compatible with previous technologies, such as IEEE 802.11b/g devices that operate in the 
2.4 GHz ISM band and IEEE 802.11a devices that operate in the 5 GHz UNII band.
Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is a big part of what makes IEEE 802.11n such 
an amazing technology. Prior to 802.11n, IEEE 802.11a/b/g devices used a single radio to 
transmit and receive radio signals. This is known as single-input single-output (SISO) tech-
nology. MIMO uses multiple radios or “radio chains” to transmit and receive radio signals. 
SISO systems are subject to a phenomenon called multipath, in which several wavefronts of 
a signal would be received out of phase because of reflections. This is a problem for IEEE 
802.11a/b/g systems, whereas MIMO actually uses the reflections from either a transmitter 
or a receiver to help enhance the performance and throughput using several radio chains in 
802.11n. Multipath is discussed in more detail in Chapter 5. MIMO consists of several types 
of new technologies that include the following among others:
■
■
Transmit beamforming (TxBF)
■
■
Maximal ratio combining (MRC)
■
■
Spatial multiplexing (SM)
■
■
Space-time block coding (STBC)
It is best to check with the specific manufacturers of the wireless equipment to determine 
how they implement MIMO technology. The details of the types of MIMO technologies 
listed here are beyond the scope of the objectives of this book but can be found in other 
CWNP study guides and training materials.
IEEE 802.11n provides many enhancements to the Physical Layer 1, including the following:
■
■
40 MHz channels through the use of channel bonding
■
■
More subcarriers for higher data rates
■
■
Optional short guard intervals to provide more potential throughput in less reflective 
environments
■
■
Varying modulation types for data rates of up to 600 Mbps
The Media Access Control (MAC) sublayer of the Data Link layer also provides 
enhancements to improve performance and throughput with IEEE 802.11n. These include 
but are not limited to the following:
■
■
Frame aggregation for less 802.11 overhead
■
■
Block acknowledgments (block ACKs)
■
■
Reduced interframe spacing (RIFS)
■
■
Spatial multiplexing power save (SMPS) to help conserve the battery life of the receiver
■
■
Power save multi-poll (PSMP) for devices enabled for QoS devices
The IEEE 802.11ac Amendment
The IEEE 802.11ac amendment is an exciting step forward with standards-based WLAN 
technology. This new gigabit wireless networking technology is used with wireless local 
area networking for both home and enterprise applications. As technology continues to 

The IEEE 
51
advance, the users of the connected devices want more data, they want it faster, and they 
want it available everywhere. Like the IEEE 802.11a amendment to the standard, 802.11ac 
technology operates in the 5 GHz band only and is a Physical layer extension of IEEE 
802.11n, providing backward compatibility with that technology in the 5 GHz frequency 
band. IEEE 802.11ac brings the following enhancements: 
Data Rates up to 6.93 Gbps  IEEE 802.11ac, Very High Throughput (VHT), provides the 
capability of up to 6.93 Gbps of aggregate throughput. The actual amount of throughput 
will vary and can be affected by several factors, including the number of radio chains/ 
spatial streams and antennas. 
 256-QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation)  The modulation and coding scheme 
(MCS) concept was introduced with the IEEE 802.11n amendment. Basically, MCS is a 
way to represent the data transfer rates with the newer, more sophisticated technology. 
The MCS index will vary based on the technology in place, such as the number of spatial 
streams, the channel width, and the short guard interval. IEEE 802.11ac allows for 256-
QAM up from 64-QAM in 802.11n. 
Wider Channels  Bandwidth with respect to RF can be considered to be a range of fre-
quencies used for a specifi c application. IEEE 802.11n increased the RF channel width from 
20 MHz to 40 MHz. This newest amendment to the standard allows for 80 MHz- and 
even 160 MHz-wide channels. Wider channels mean more bandwidth per channel and 
therefore higher throughput. 
More Spatial Streams  The IEEE 802.11n amendment allowed for a possible maximum of 
four spatial streams; however, most manufacturers utilized only three. IEEE 802.11ac will 
allow for up to eight spatial streams. More spatial streams means a higher data rate, and 
this will parlay into higher throughput. 
Multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO)  Until now, IEEE 802.11 technology was based on uni-
cast communication between two stations, such as a client device and an access point, 
or broadcast/multicast communication, such as an access point to many or all connected 
stations. IEEE 802.11ac provides multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) for communication. 
MU-MIMO will allow different stations (client devices) to send or receive independent data 
streams simultaneously using multiple antennas/radio chains. 
 IEEE 802.11ac is backward-compatible with devices operating in the 5 GHz band only 
and will be benefi cial for certain types of applications, such as streaming video and/or 
areas that may need additional capacity, and for minimizing issues in high-density deploy-
ments. One thing that is often overlooked is the actual physical wired infrastructure in 
which the wireless access points are connected. It is important to be certain that the wired 
infrastructure capacity is available to handle these faster speeds. 
 
 The IEEE 802.11ad amendment (Very High Throughput 60 GHz) was ratified 
in December 2012. This technology operates in the unlicensed 60 GHz 
frequency band and is not backward-compatible with IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n/
ac technology. Because 802.11ad operates at such a high frequency, it has 
many limitations and does not propagate well, and communications may 
be limited to a very small physical space, such as a single room. There are 

52 
Chapter 2 ■ Wireless Local Area Networking, Standards, and Certifications
a limited number of IEEE 802.11ad chipsets available that will provide this 
technology. However, they currently are not big within the WLAN market 
or widely available. Some manufacturers produce network adapters that 
will work within the 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 60 GHz frequency ranges, but 
it is important to understand that even though these adapters will work 
in all three frequency ranges, the 802.11ad technology is not backward- 
compatible with 802.11a/b/g/n/ac. The use of 802.11ad wireless technology 
includes peer-to-peer or ad hoc communications for streaming video and 
other multimedia type uses within a smaller physical area. 
 
 The IEEE 802.11ah amendment allows for wireless LAN operation in fre-
quency bands below 1 GHz (also called the Sub 1 GHz band), allowing for 
long-range, low-power connections using unlicensed frequency, including 
the 900 MHz frequency band. The driving force behind this amendment is 
the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. 
 Summary of IEEE 802.11 Communications

ogies, and data rates for all the IEEE 802.11 standards and amendments mentioned in this

technology. Table  2.2 provides a summary and comparison of the currently released IEEE

Additional IEEE 802.11 Amendments
In addition to communications, the IEEE creates amendments defining specific functional-
ity, including QoS and security. We will look at those functions next.
The IEEE 802.11e Amendment
The original IEEE 802.11 standard lacked QoS functionality features. In the original IEEE 
802.11 standard, point coordination function (PCF) mode provided some level of QoS. PCF 
mode is a function of the access point and allows for polling of connected client devices. This 
creates a contention-free period for data transmissions and provides QoS-like functionality. 
However, few if any 802.11 wireless manufacturers implemented this mode of operation.
The IEEE 802.11e amendment defined enhancements for QoS in WLANs. 802.11e 
introduced a new coordination function, the hybrid coordination function (HCF). HCF 
defines traffic classes and assigns a priority to the information to be transmitted. For exam-
ple, voice traffic is given a higher priority than data traffic, such as information being sent 
to a printer. The IEEE 802.11e amendment was incorporated into the IEEE 802.11-2007 
standard and is now part of the IEEE 802.11-2016 standard. The Wi-Fi Alliance created a 
proactive interoperability certification for 802.11e called Wi-Fi Multimedia (WMM). The 
Wi-Fi Alliance and interoperability certifications are discussed later in this chapter.
The IEEE 802.11i Amendment
The IEEE 802.11i amendment addresses advanced security solutions for WLANs, since the 
original IEEE 802.11 standard was known for security weaknesses. Manufacturers of IEEE 
802.11 WLAN equipment addressed the following:
■
■
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)
■
■
Service set identifier (SSID) hiding
■
■
Media access control (MAC) address filtering

54 
Chapter 2  ■  Wireless Local Area Networking, Standards, and Certifications  
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) was defined by the IEEE 802.11 (1999) standard 
intended to prevent casual eavesdropping. WEP was compromised early on, mak-
ing WLANs vulnerable to intrusion and providing little if any security. This issue was 
addressed by stronger security mechanisms (mainly CCMP/AES, which stands for Counter 
Mode with Cipher-Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol /Advanced 
Encryption Standard) that became available with the introduction of the IEEE 802.11i 
amendment to the standard.
Service set identifier (SSID) hiding and media access control (MAC) address filtering are 
both manufacturer-implemented features that may be used by some for “pseudo” security. 
It is important to understand that neither of these provides any kind of security for an IEEE 
802.11 wireless network. MAC address filtering provided a user the ability to allow or disal-
low device access to a wireless network based on the assigned Layer 2 address of the device.
WEP, SSID hiding, and MAC filtering all have known security vulnerabilities, allowing 
for security weaknesses in IEEE 802.11 WLANs. The IEEE 802.11i amendment addressed 
security weaknesses with WLANS by including several enhancements, all of which will 
be discussed in Chapter 8, “Security Fundamentals for Wireless Networking.” The IEEE 
802.11i amendment was incorporated into the IEEE 802.11-2007 standard and is now part 
of the IEEE 802.11-2016 standard.
The IEEE 802.11r Amendment
The IEEE 802.11r amendment was approved in May 2008. The 802.11r amendment speci-
fies fast secure roaming or fast transition (FT) technology. The IEEE 802.11 standard did 
not address standards-based transition (roaming) mechanisms, so manufacturers used 
proprietary methods. The IEEE attempted to standardize transition techniques for WLAN 
technology with the ratification of a recommended practice, IEEE 802.11F. This recom-
mended practice was never implemented by many (if any) manufacturers and was eventu-
ally withdrawn by the IEEE.
The main goal of IEEE 802.11r was to provide fast transition for voice over IP (VoIP) 
with WLAN technology. Although this amendment has been ratified for some time and 
most enterprise equipment manufacturers support it, they still rely on the use of proprietary 
methods for fast transition. This is partly because there was no interoperability certification 
from the Wi-Fi Alliance until recently. Additionally, there are other technical requirements 
such as support on both infrastructure and the client device sides for this technology to 
operate correctly. The IEEE 802.11r amendment was incorporated into the IEEE 802.11-
2012 standard and is now part of the IEEE 802.11-2016 standard.
The IEEE 802.11k Amendment
IEEE 802.11k is the amendment to the IEEE 802.11 standard that addresses radio resource 
management. This amendment was approved in May 2008, the same day as the IEEE 
802.11r amendment. 802.11k and 802.11r work together to form fast, secure basic service 
set (BSS) transition for mobile devices. IEEE 802.11k aids the wireless device in locating 
the best access point to transition to, by defining the technology to be used to manage the 
RF. The IEEE 802.11k amendment was incorporated into the IEEE 802.11-2012 standard 
and is now part of the IEEE 80211-2016 standard.

The IEEE 802.11v amendment, now part of IEEE 802.11-2016 standard, addresses man-
agement of devices that are connected to a wireless network and are part of a basic service 
set. Along with IEEE 802.11r and IEEE 802.11k, IEEE 802.11v is required by the Wi-Fi 
Alliance to qualify for Wi-Fi certified voice certifications. It is also important to note both 
the access point and client device need to be Wi-Fi certified for voice in order to benefit 
from the technology.
The IEEE 802.11w Amendment
WLAN management frames—such as the 802.11 authentication frames and 802.11 asso-
ciation frames used in IEEE 802.11 WLANs—are susceptible to intrusion and can cause 
security issues. This is because the IEEE 802.11 standard did not provide any protection for 
management frame information that traverses the air. With some basic knowledge of the 
technology and the correct software tools, an intruder can perform a denial-of-service (DoS) 
or hijacking attack. When implemented, technology specified in the IEEE 802.11w amend-
ment helps to mitigate these types of attacks or security issues. This technology is still not 
yet implemented by most organizations mostly due to the requirements and other technical 
issues such as the effect on wireless intrusion prevention systems (WIPS) mitigation features. 
The IEEE 802.11w amendment was incorporated into the IEEE 802.11-2012 standard and 
is now part of the IEEE 802.11-2016 standard.
The IEEE 802.11s Amendment
The IEEE 802.11s amendment specifies wireless mesh networking. Mesh networking with 
wired networking has been available for many years. Wireless mesh networking started with 
military deployments but has evolved into the public sector. Mesh networking allows infra-
structure devices such as wireless access points or mesh routers to create a self-forming, self-
healing and intelligent network infrastructure. A wireless mesh network is sometimes referred 
to as a wireless distribution system (WDS). Most manufacturers of enterprise wireless equip-
ment have been using mesh technology for years with proprietary protocols. Although the 
IEEE has ratified the standard for this technology, most manufacturers still use proprietary 
methods. Mesh technology will be discussed further in Chapter 3, “Infrastructure and Client 
Devices for Wireless Networking.” The IEEE 802.11s amendment was incorporated into the 
IEEE 802.11-2012 standard and is now part of the IEEE 802.11-2016 standard.
Interoperability Certifications
By creating standards, the IEEE is encouraging technological progress. Manufacturers 
often implement wireless devices and networks in a proprietary manner, within or outside 
the standard. The proprietary approach often leads to a lack of interoperability among 
devices. In the wireless community, such practices are not widely accepted. Users want all 
their devices to function well together. The combination of proprietary implementations 
and user dissatisfaction fostered the creation of interoperability testing and certifications.

Chapter 2 ■ Wireless Local Area Networking, Standards, and Certifications
 This section discusses manufacturer interoperability certifi cations related to IEEE 
802.11 standards-based WLAN equipment. These certifi cations address communications, 
QoS, and security. 
 The Wi-Fi Alliance 
 The IEEE is responsible for creating the standards for wireless networking. Equipment 
manufacturers, however, are not required to provide proof that their equipment is compli-
ant with the standards. Starting with the release of the IEEE 802.11b amendment, several 
early WLAN equipment manufacturers—including Symbol Systems, Aironet, and Lucent—
formed an organization known as  Wireless Ethernet Compatibility Alliance (WECA) to 
promote the technology and to provide interoperability testing of WLAN equipment manu-
factured by these and other companies. In 2000, WECA was renamed the  Wi-Fi Alliance . 
The term  Wi-Fi represents a certifi cation and is often misused by people in the industry. 
Wi-Fi is a registered trademark, originally registered in 1999 by WECA and now registered 
to the Wi-Fi Alliance. People often use the term Wi-Fi synonymously with WLAN technol-
ogy; in fact it means wireless technology certifi ed to be interoperable. 
 
 For additional information about the Wi-Fi Alliance, visit  www.wi-fi.org 
or  www.wi-fi.com . 
 Figure  2.7 shows an example of a Wi-Fi certifi ed logo, showing the device has met the 
interoperability testing criteria.

 The Wi-Fi Protected Access Certification 
 The  Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) certifi cation was developed by the Wi-Fi Alliance 
because security in the original IEEE 802.11 standard was weak and had vulnerabilities. 
This certifi cation was designed as an interim solution until an amendment to the IEEE 
802.11 standard addressing security improvements was released. The IEEE 802.11i amend-
ment addressed security for the IEEE 802.11 family of standards. The bottom line is that 
WPA is a pre-802.11i certifi cation, introducing more advanced security solutions such as 
Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP), passphrase, and 802.1X/EAP. 

Interoperability Certifications 
57  
This pre-802.11i certification addressed two options for WLAN security: personal mode and 
enterprise mode. Personal mode is intended for small office/home office (SOHO) and home users. 
Enterprise mode is intended for larger deployments. Personal mode allows for a user to enter 
an 8- to 63-character passphrase (password) on either the access point or another infrastructure 
device, such as a WLAN controller and all the devices that are connected to the infrastructure 
device. Enterprise mode, on the other hand, provides user-based authentication utilizing 
802.1X/EAP. Both personal and enterprise modes are discussed in more detail in Chapter 8.
The Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 Certification
The WPA certification by the Wi-Fi Alliance worked out so well that the alliance decided to 
certify WLAN hardware after the IEEE 802.11i amendment was released. This new certifi-
cation, known as Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA 2.0), is a post-802.11i certification. Like 
WPA, WPA 2.0 addresses two options for WLAN security: personal mode and enterprise 
mode. This certification addresses more advanced security solutions and is backward-­
compatible with WPA. The following is a preview of its key points; we will look at both 
WPA and WPA 2.0 in more detail in Chapter 8.
■
■
The personal mode security mechanism uses a passphrase for authentication, which is 
intended for SOHO and personal use. The use of a passphrase to generate a 256-bit 
pre-shared key provides strong security. Personal mode may also be identified as pre-
shared key (PSK).
■
■
The enterprise mode security mechanism uses 802.1X/EAP for user-based authentication, 
which is port-based authentication and is designed for enterprise implementations. 802.1X/
EAP provides strong security using external authentication and Extensible Authentication 
Protocol (EAP). 802.1X/EAP uses an authentication server for the user authentication. 
Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) is a common authentication server. 
This works well as a replacement for legacy IEEE 802.11 security solutions.
Table 2.3 provides a high-level description of the WPA and WPA 2.0 certifications.

 Encryption mechanisms and ciphers will be discussed further in Chapter  8 . 
 The Wi-Fi Multimedia Certification 
 The  Wi-Fi Multimedia (WMM) certifi cation was designed as a proactive certifi cation for 
the IEEE 802.11e amendment to the 802.11 standard. The 802.11e amendment addresses 
QoS in WLANs. The WMM certifi cation verifi es the validity of features of the 802.11e 
amendment and allows for a manufacturer-neutral approach to QoS. 
 QoS is needed to ensure delivery of information for time-sensitive, time-bounded appli-
cations, such as voice and real-time streaming video. If a wireless network user were to 
send a fi le to a printer or save a fi le to a server, it is unlikely they would notice any minor 
delay, or latency. However, in an application that is tuned to the human senses such as 
hearing or eyesight, latency would more likely be noticeable. 
 Wi-Fi Multimedia Power Save Certification 
Wi-Fi Multimedia Power Save (WMM-PS) is designed for mobile battery-powered devices 
and specifi c uses of WLAN technology that require advanced power-save mechanisms 
for extended battery life. Here are some of these devices and technology that benefi t from 
WMM-PS: 
 
■
 Voice over IP (VoIP) phones 
 
■
 Notebook computers 
 
■
 Tablet devices 
 Power-save mechanisms allow devices to conserve battery power by “dozing” for short 
periods of time. Depending on the application, performance could suffer to some degree 
with power-save features enabled. WMM-PS consumes less power by allowing devices to 
spend more time in a “dozing” state—an improvement over legacy power save mode that 
at the same time improves performance by minimizing transmission latency. Unlike the 
early standard-based power save mode, which uses a scheduled timing process to doze, 
a device that is WMM PS-enabled will doze based on whether it needs to send or receive 
data frames. This is known as a trigger and delivery method where the client device will 
be in an “awake” state as needed to either send or receive data frames to and from an 
access point.  
 Wi-Fi Protected Setup Certification Overview 
 Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) was defi ned because SOHO users wanted a simple way to 
provide the best security possible for their installations without the need for extensive 
technical knowledge of wireless networking. WPS provides strong out-of-the-box setup 
adequate for many SOHO implementations. 

Common Wireless Local Area Network Deployment Scenarios 
59  
The WPS certification requires support for two types of authentication that enable 
users to automatically configure network names and strong WPA2 data encryption and 
authentication:
■
■
Push-button configuration (PBC)
■
■
PIN-based configuration, based on a personal identification number
Support for both PIN and PBC configurations is required for access points; client devices 
at a minimum must support PIN. A third, optional method, near field communication 
(NFC) tokens, is also supported.
Security Hole with WPS
In December 2011 a security flaw was reported with WPS. This allegedly allowed an 
intruder to recover the personal identification number (PIN) used to create the 256-bit 
pre-shared key. Acquiring the PIN would allow access to the wireless network. Wherever 
possible, it is recommended that users disable certain features in the wireless router 
or access point that allow this to happen. A firmware update may also be available to 
provide adequate protection. Keep in mind that this solution to the issue may only be 
possible with newer-model wireless routers. You should check with the manufacturer 
to determine if a solution (either a software setting or firmware upgrade) is available 
for a specific device. Otherwise, consider a different method such as WPA2.0 to secure 
the wireless router. Upgrading to a newer wireless router is another  
possible solution.
Common Wireless Local Area Network 
Deployment Scenarios
The availability and technology enhancements of IEEE 802.11 wireless networking have 
increased while the cost continues to decrease, making WLANs a viable solution for many 
business models, including personal use, home offices, small offices, and enterprise organi-
zations. This section looks at various scenarios in which this type of wireless networking is 
used. We’ll explore some of the following more common deployment scenarios that utilize 
WLANs:
■
■
Small office/home office (SOHO)
■
■
Enterprise deployments: corporate data access and end-user mobility
■
■
Extension of existing networks into remote locations

Small Office/Home Office
Many small office/home office (SOHO) businesses have the same needs as those of larger 
businesses with regard to technology, computer networking, and communication. These com-
mon needs, regardless of the network size, include access to a common infrastructure for 
resources such as computer data (files), printers, databases, other networks, and the Internet. 
Computer networking technology is common regardless of the size of the business. Whether 
there are 1 or 100 employees, many are categorized as small businesses. WLANs now play a 
major role in small businesses. Many of these locations have a high-speed Internet connection 
such as DSL (digital subscriber line) or cable modem for access outside the LAN.
With the number of work-at-home professionals continuing to grow at a very high rate, 
the need for wireless networking in this environment is also continuing to grow. The same 
goes for the small office environment. Deployments such as these typically involve a smaller 
number of users. Therefore, the equipment used may be consumer models sold in consumer 
electronics department stores and online retailers.
In addition, many companies or organizations now allow for employees to work 
remotely part or full time. In these cases the company network is now extended to the 
remote location, which, whether it is a home office or other location, may be considered 
a branch office of the company’s corporate network. When WLAN technology is used 
at a remote location, new concerns arise, such as data security and network availability. 
Depending on the size of the small office/home office and the number of potential users and 
devices, a WLAN RF site survey may be required. A site survey will help determine areas 
of RF coverage and interference as well as the number and placement of access points. Even 
if the small office/home office will only require a single access point, it is still beneficial to 
know what other wireless networks or devices are in the same coverage area that may cause 
RF interference.

service provider allowing access to the necessary network/Internet resources.

Enterprise Deployments: Corporate Data Access  
and End-User Mobility
Enterprise organizations have used wired LAN technology for decades. With the increased 
need for mobility, WLANs within enterprise organizations have also increased in popular-
ity. In earlier years, due to lack of interoperability and security features, many enterprise 
organizations limited WLAN deployments to extensions of networks where wired connec-
tivity was either not feasible or too costly. Because of advancements in WLAN technology 
over the recent years, IEEE 802.11 deployments in enterprise organizations are continuing 
to grow at a rapid pace.
WLANs in the enterprise are used with—but not limited to—client workstation con-
nectivity (desktop, notebook, and tablet devices), printers, barcode scanners, voice hand-
sets, and location services. The cost of this technology has decreased, whereas capabilities, 
performance, speed, and security have increased, making wireless an attractive solution for 
many enterprise organizations. The cost savings over hardwired solutions such as Ethernet 
are enormous, adding to the attractiveness. Finally, wireless connectivity is the only option 
in some cases, such as mobile Voice over Wi-Fi handsets for voice communications.
Figure 2.9 shows a floor plan drawing of an office area that may include a wireless 
deployment. Each individual or shared office would contain one or two networked desktop 
computers and phones, and many would also have laptops. Printers might be located in 
centrally located common areas accessible to the individuals who have permissions to use 
them. The conference room might contain a videoconferencing system and an access point 
depending on the number of available seats, and the reception area might have wireless 
guest access for vendors or other visitors not belonging to the company or organization. 
Connecting all these networked devices to each other and the outside world are the wireless

ity for all wireless devices.

WLAN technology
Extension of Existing Networks into Remote Locations
In its early days, wireless networking technology was typically deployed as an extension of 
an existing wired network infrastructure. For example, some users who required access to 
the computer network were farther than the physical limit of 100 meters that the IEEE 802.3 
Ethernet standard allows for a copper-wired connection, so other solutions were needed to 
provide this connectivity. Other wired technology, such as fiber optics and leased lines, was 
sometimes cost-prohibitive or not logistically feasible. WLANs were an excellent alternative.
Now IEEE 802.11 WLANs are a major part of every network, including home, cor-
porate, and branch/remote locations. Remote network locations may include the SOHO, 
branch office locations, public wireless hotspots, and wireless Internet service providers 
(WISPs). When a user connects to a corporate office network from any of these scenarios, 
the network is basically being extended to a remote location. This extension should be 
treated as such with regard to network, security, availability, and performance. This chap-
ter discusses each of these deployment scenarios in more detail.
Public Wireless Hotspots (Public Wi-Fi) and Hospitality
Portability and mobility are major benefits of wireless networking. Portability allows users to 
access information from a variety of locations, either public or private. Mobility allows the con-
tinuous connection to a wireless network while a device is on the move. One example of por-
tability is the wireless hotspot. In today’s world, it is rare to visit any public location, whether a 
restaurant, hotel, coffee shop, or airport, and not be able to find a public wireless hotspot.
A wireless hotspot is defined as a location that offers wireless network connectivity for 
free or for-profit public or patron services. It allows a variety of mobile devices (computers, 

Common Wireless Local Area Network Deployment Scenarios 
63  
tablets, smart phones, and so on) to connect to and access public Internet and private net-
work resources. Many users work from remote locations and require Internet access as part 
of their job. This can include access from a wireless hotspot.
A typical wireless hotspot will be configured with at least one WLAN router connected 
to an ISP. In some cases, this setup could be as simple as a location offering free Wi-Fi 
Internet access for its customers. More sophisticated hotspots will have several wireless 
access points or a complete wireless infrastructure and will be connected to a remote bill-
ing server that is responsible for collecting revenue from the user.
In many cases, when a user connects to the hotspot router, they will be prompted with a 
web page for authentication. At this point they might be asked to enter information such as 
an account number, username and password, or a credit card number to allow usage for a 
limited period of time. In the case of a free hotspot, typically this web page lists terms and 
conditions the user agrees to prior to accessing the Internet. This type of web page configura-
tion is known as a captive portal. Captive portals are discussed in more detail in Chapter 8.
Wireless hotspots can raise security concerns for the user. Without a secure connection 
in place, information is passed in cleartext through the air via RF, potentially allowing an 
intruder to capture usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, or other information that 
could lead to identity theft. Most hotspots do not have the capability to provide a secure 
wireless connection from the user’s computer or wireless device to the wireless router or 
network. The secure connection then becomes the responsibility of the user. Since many 
corporations allow employees to work remotely from wireless hotspot connections, extra 
security measures need to be explored and implemented. In this case, usually a virtual pri-
vate network (VPN) is used to ensure security. A VPN creates a secure tunnel between the 
user and the corporate network, allowing for a secure encrypted connection for the user 
from the wireless hotspot to their corporate network over the Internet or public network.
For users who connect to wireless hotspots, it is very important for their wireless devices 
to be secured with the appropriate antivirus software, firewall software, and up-to-date 
operating system patches or service packs. Following these guidelines can help protect the 
user from attacks when they are connected to and using a wireless hotspot.

Office (Carpeted) Deployments
Computer networking in traditional office space (or “carpeted offices”) now relies on wire-
less technology to a large extent. This is for several reasons:
■
■
Cost
■
■
Portability
■
■
Mobility
■
■
Convenience
Many offices have an existing wired network infrastructure, and I do not expect that to 
go away any time soon. In most cases copper wire for Ethernet connectivity is already in 
place and is adequate for the intended use. However, the cost to upgrade the copper wir-
ing or install new wired network drops can be expensive. Therefore, WLAN technology 
is an attractive alternative to wired networks in many office deployment scenarios. What 
we are now seeing in the enterprise is a new era of wireless networks by default and wired 
networks only as required. Depending on the use of the network—that is, the types of soft-
ware applications and the number of devices requiring connectivity—wireless may be the 
best solution simply because of the cost.
Without trying to set firm limits, it is common to connect as many as 20–25 users/
devices to a single wireless access point. However, the maximum size depends on the soft-
ware or other applications and the number of devices connected. A major benefit of IEEE 
802.11 WLAN technology is that an access point will require only a single Ethernet drop 
to support all the devices or users. Of course, don’t forget that an access point is part of a 
shared medium for everything that connects, and performance and throughput can be an 
issue if proper design practices are not used.
Again, remember the difference between portability and mobility. Portability allows users 
to access information from a variety of set locations, and mobility allows a continuous con-
nection to a wireless network while the device is moving. Carpeted offices may have a need 
to provide support for both portability and mobility. For the user who moves from an office 
cubicle to a conference room to attend a meeting, portability will be sufficient. In this situa-
tion they will probably shut down their mobile device, such as a laptop computer, and carry 
it to a conference room for the meeting. Restarting the computer will then require the device 
to reconnect to the wireless network—hence, portability.
Devices such as mobile phones using VoIP or tablet devices usually require continu-
ous connectivity to the wireless network while the user/device is in motion. This mobility 
feature allows uninterrupted communications and a pleasant experience for the user. Both 
portability and mobility provide the convenience network that people desire. Figure 2.11 
shows a common office scenario.
Educational Institution Deployments
Educational institutions can benefit from wireless networking in many ways. WLAN 
deployments are common in elementary and high schools both public and private. 
Universities deploy campus-wide WLANs amounting to thousands of access points servic-
ing tens of thousands of users on a single campus.

Common Wireless Local Area Network Deployment Scenarios 
65  
WLAN technology allows for increased mobility in the educational environment, 
providing huge cost savings when technology needs to be refreshed. Mobile carts with 
notebook computers are one example. A high school can deploy wireless infrastructure 
devices such as access points in classrooms and purchase several mobile carts with note-
book or tablet computers to be used when and where needed. This is beneficial since it 
will save on supplying many classrooms with computers when continuous need for the 
computers or devices may be low. Some school buildings may be older or historic build-
ings and installing cabling is impossible or cost-prohibitive. Wireless provides the solu-
tion. The architecture of many school buildings may also pose concerns that need to be

addressed with many wireless network deployments. These include building materials, 
such as the following:
■
■
Brick and concrete walls
■
■
Lath and plaster walls
■
■
Inconsistent materials due to building additions
These materials may cause issues because the RF may not propagate well depending on 
the density and composition of the building materials. This means potentially additional 
wireless access points and extra design considerations.
In addition, there may be modular or temporary classrooms; the issue with these is the 
density of devices and users, which will affect the wireless network capacity and may result 
in performance issues. Also, the location and distance from the main building should be 
taken into consideration because this equates to a point-to-multipoint connection, and line 
of sight needs be taken into account.
Some educational institutions are implementing a “one-to-one” initiative—in other 
words, the goal is to have one Internet-accessible device for every one student. This type 
of initiative will introduce density concerns because of the potentially high number of stu-
dents in a single classroom. Educational institutions, whether an elementary school, a high 
school, or a college campus, should always consider starting with an RF wireless site survey 
and follow best practices from the equipment manufacturer to ensure a successful deploy-
ment. Figure 2.12 shows a typical small school environment.

Common Wireless Local Area Network Deployment Scenarios 
67  
Industrial Deployments
Some industrial organizations have been using WLAN technology for many years, even 
prior to the development of IEEE 802.11 wireless standards-based solutions. Examples 
of these deployments include barcode and scanning solutions for manufacturing, ware-
housing, inventory, and retail. Although this type of deployment may not be very dense, 
coverage is very important. Many businesses of this type include the following building 
characteristics:
■
■
High ceilings
■
■
Tall storage racks
■
■
Large inventory of product
■
■
Forklifts
These building characteristics can cause issues with wireless networks because of the 
way RF propagates. With high ceilings, various antennas will need to be tested and cover-
age verified throughout the facility. Tall storage racks may have varying levels of inventory 
or product, resulting in poor propagation. Depending on what the products are made of, 
this will have a direct impact on the RF behavior. For example, a high density of water 
products and paper products will absorb RF. In many cases, forklifts will be outfitted with 
wireless barcode scanners or other mobile devices that require the ability for fast secure 
transition capabilities.
In this type of environment, it is important to understand that RF will behave in ways 
that could impact the performance of the wireless network. Chapter 4 will explain the 
behaviors of RF in more detail. These behaviors can lead to coverage issues for the devices 
in use. Careful evaluation of this type of environment is essential, and an RF site survey is 
highly recommended to ensure proper RF coverage.
The physical characteristics of this type of environment are fairly static, although 
additional racks or shelving may occasionally be added. However, product inventory 
is dynamic and may change constantly. Moreover, forklifts and other product-moving 
equipment are constantly moving and in different locations. These are some of the fac-
tors that must be taken into consideration when deploying wireless networking in an 
industrial environment. Figure 2.13 shows a typical warehouse facility with 35-foot-high 
ceilings.
Healthcare Deployments
The growth of WLAN deployments in the healthcare industry is quite impressive. Today, 
healthcare is one of the fastest-growing sectors of the U.S. economy. Healthcare envi-
ronments pose many challenges for the design, deployment, and support of wireless 
networking.

68 
Chapter 2  ■  Wireless Local Area Networking, Standards, and Certifications  
Hospitals in most cases run 24 × 7 × 365 days a year. WLANs have numerous applications 
in hospitals, including these:
■
■
Patient registration
■
■
Patient charting
■
■
Prescription automation
■
■
Treatment verification
■
■
Inventory tracking
■
■
Electronic medical records
■
■
Location services
■
■
Electronic imaging
■
■
Voice (VoWLAN)
■
■
Patient monitoring devices
One of the obstacles to take into consideration for wireless networking is interference. 
Hospitals use many devices that operate in the unlicensed ISM RF band. This can create chal-
lenges for design and reliability of the wireless network. Licensed and unlicensed RF bands 
are discussed in the “Licensed RF Bands Used with IEEE 802.11” section in this chapter. 
Other potential issues for healthcare deployments to be aware of include the following:
■
■
Building materials that can hinder RF propagation, such as lead-lined walls used in 
radiology areas to protect people from X-rays
■
■
Identical floor layouts above and below, which leads to stacking access point issues
■
■
Limited accessibility to areas such as surgery and patient care rooms
■
■
Aesthetics of the installed equipment

Compliance with legislation such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 
Act of 1996 (HIPAA) also needs to be taken into consideration when designing wireless 
installations for healthcare. Security concerns and different legislations will be discussed in

Last-Mile Data Delivery: Wireless ISP
Last-mile data delivery is a term commonly used in telecommunications to describe the 
connection from a provider to an endpoint such as a home or business. (Last-mile is not 
necessarily a mile in distance.) This can be a costly solution in many applications, since 
each endpoint needs a separate physical connection. Wireless technology provides a more 
cost-effective solution for last-mile data delivery.
Some communication technologies, such as DSL, have physical limitations that prohibit 
connections in some cases. It may not be cost-effective for telecommunication service pro-
viders to supply connections in rural or semi-rural areas. WLANs can service areas that 
may not be part of a last-mile run. Providing Internet access from a wireless ISP is one 
application. Things to consider for feasibility are line of sight, obstacles, and RF interfer-
ence. Figure 2.15 shows an example of wireless last-mile data delivery.

In December 2009, the 802.11 task group TGaf was formed to define the 802.11af 
amendment (not to be confused with IEEE 802.3af for Power over Ethernet). This amend-
ment to the 802.11 standard addresses the use of “TV White Space” frequency bands for 
use with wireless networking technology. These lower frequencies propagate well over lon-
ger distances and may be ideal to provide Internet connectivity for rural or semi-rural areas 
as well as other types of wireless technology innovation.
High-Density Deployments Including Conference Centers
What does the term “high-density Wi-Fi deployment” really mean? People have differing 
opinions on this, as it can be subjective. Some industry experts claim that in the next few 
years the number of installed wireless devices will exceed the number of installed wired 
devices. When you think about it, this projection may be realistic. Take a moment and 
count the number of wireless devices that you have in your possession, at your home, the 
classroom, and the office. This includes notebook computers, smart phones, tablets, and 
broadband Internet devices. The average person may have between one and five separate 
wireless devices, many of which include IEEE 802.11 wireless technology. This gives an 
idea of how the density of WLAN devices in all environments—home, office, education, 
and industrial—will continue to increase in the coming years.
Some high-density deployments have been discussed in this chapter and include educa-
tional institutions and medical facilities such as hospital environments. Issues to consider in 
this type of environment are the frequency band to use, co-channel interference, cell sizing, 
and access point capacity.
A future amendment to the standard (IEEE 802.11ax) is intended for high density 
deployments and will allow for better performance and higher signaling rates to provide 
faster data transfers and higher throughput using 1024-QAM technology.

Summary

Municipal, Law Enforcement, and Transportation Networks
WLANs are valuable technology in the industrial, municipal, and law enforcement fields, 
and in transportation networks.
Federal and local law enforcement agencies frequently maintain state-of-the-art technol-
ogy utilizing computer forensics and WLAN technology. Technologies that use 19.2 Kbps 
connectivity are obsolete because of their slower data transfer rates. Municipal deploy-
ments, which include police, fire, utilities, and city or town services, are often all connected 
to a common WLAN.
Transportation networks are no exception. WLAN installations are becoming more 
common in places like commuter buses, trains, airplanes, and automobiles. Users can con-
nect for free or by paying a nominal fee. This type of connectivity now allows a user to 
better employ idle time. This is especially helpful to the mobile user or “road warrior” who 
needs to make the best use of available time.
Summary

(WPAN), the wireless local area network (WLAN), the wireless metropolitan area network 
(WMAN), and the wireless wide area network (WWAN), showing the many ways wireless 
networks can be implemented.

Choosing the correct network infrastructure devices to be 
installed as part of a computer network (both wired and 
wireless) is a critical element of a successful wireless LAN 
(WLAN) deployment. In this chapter, we will look at a variety of infrastructure devices, 
including wireless access points, wireless bridges, wireless repeaters/range extend-
ers, WLAN controllers, and cloud-managed wireless systems. Cloud-managed WLAN 
deployments are growing at a fast pace in all markets. Whereas some manufacturers 
specialize in only cloud-managed solutions, most manufacturers of enterprise wireless 
equipment utilize cloud-managed access points to some extent. You will learn about the 
features and benefits of these and other wireless network infrastructure devices. Power 
over Ethernet (PoE) is an extension to the IEEE 802.3 Ethernet standard that allows 
direct current (DC) voltage to be supplied over Ethernet cable to wireless access points, 
VoIP telephones, Ethernet security cameras, and other PoE-capable devices. PoE consists 
of two ratified amendments and is heavily used in enterprise WLAN deployments. This 
chapter will discuss the concepts involved in PoE, including both of its amendments to 
the IEEE 802.3 standard.
Client devices were often thought of as computers—either desktop or notebook—­
connected to a computer network. Now many other devices, both wired and wireless, 
however, can connect to a network. WLAN client devices include various types of 
computers, tablets, smartphones, scanners, print servers, cameras, and other devices 
that are used to send data across the network. This chapter will look at the features of 
various WLAN client adapter types and the software for configuration and manage-
ment of these devices.
Devices that connect to wireless networks use various types of adapters. Which adapter 
is used depends on the device that it connects to. You can connect wireless adapters 
to such devices as a notebook computer, tablet, desktop computer, or barcode scanner. 
WLAN adapters are available in various types, both external and internal to the device. 
External adapters will connect to an available interface in the device, such as a USB port. 
Some devices use internal adapters that may require some level of disassembly or removal 
of a cover panel prior to the installation. Examples of internal adapter types are PCI, Mini-
PCI, Full Mini-PCIe, and Half Mini-PCIe.
WLAN client adapters differ from other networking adapters (such as Ethernet adapters) 
because they contain radio hardware and use radio frequency (RF) to send the computer 
data over the air. Chapter 4, “Radio Frequency Fundamentals for Wireless Networking,” 
will discuss RF fundamentals in more detail. A WLAN design should be partly based on 
the needs of the client applications, client device types to be supported, and the environ-
ment where they will be used.

Chapter 3 ■ Infrastructure and Client Devices Used with Wireless Networking
 The Wireless Access Point 
 The  wireless access point is an integral component of a WLAN infrastructure. Wireless 
access points allow a variety of wireless client devices access to any network resources 
that the device or user may have permissions for. The access point provides computers, 
VoWLAN phones, smartphones, tablets, and other wireless client devices access to a 
WLAN, using radio frequency (RF) as the communication mechanism and free space (air) 
as the communication medium. 
 Wireless access points are available in three common types: autonomous, controller-
managed, and cloud-managed (or “controller-less”). Autonomous access points are 
self-contained units and can function as independent network infrastructure devices. 
Controller-managed access points, by contrast, function in conjunction with a hardware 
WLAN controller. Cloud-managed access points provide a wireless network infrastructure 
without the use of a hardware controller and are software-managed devices. 
 
 One manufacturer of cloud-managed solutions (Aerohive Networks) 
pioneered a technology known as  cooperative control architecture , which 
is used with their cloud-managed infrastructure devices. 
 When a wireless device is connected to an access point, it is known to be in  infrastruc-
ture mode . In this operation mode, all wireless data traffi c is passed through the access 
point to the intended destination, whether that is a fi le server, a printer, the Internet, 
another wireless client device, or anything else capable of receiving network data. 
 An access point can operate as a stand-alone network device, confi gured independently 
to allow wireless devices to connect. It can also operate as part of a larger wireless network 
by sharing some of the same parameters, such as the service set identifi er (SSID). The SSID 
is the logical name, or identifi er, of the WLAN; all wireless client devices connected to an 
access point will share the same SSID setting. Figure  3.1 shows an example of an access 
point connected to an Ethernet network with several wireless network client devices. 
 In addition to providing access through a shared medium, wireless access points are 
 half-duplex devices. Half-duplex is defi ned as two-way communication that occurs in 
only one direction at a time. (By contrast,  full-duplex , the other communication method 
used in computer networking, allows two-way communication to occur between devices 
simultaneously.) Communication only one way at a time means less data throughput for 
the connected device. An access point is a network infrastructure device that can con-
nect to a distribution system (DS)—typically an Ethernet segment or Ethernet cable—and 
allow wireless devices to access network resources with the appropriate access permissions. 
According to the IEEE 802.11 standard, all wireless devices, including access points, are 
considered stations (abbreviated  STA ). However, per the standard, an access point is identi-
fi ed as AP/STA (access point station). In a completely Ethernet-switched network, devices 
will communicate directly with the Ethernet switch. Figure  3.2 illustrates half-duplex com-
munication using a wireless access point.

Chapter 3 ■ Infrastructure and Client Devices Used with Wireless Networking
 Autonomous Access Points 
Autonomous access points are self-contained units with all the intelligence necessary 
to provide devices with wireless access to a wired network infrastructure, and access to 
the resources the devices have permission to use. There are three popular types of autono-
mous access points: consumer-grade; small offi ce, home offi ce-grade (SOHO-grade); and 
 enterprise-grade. Not surprisingly, the enterprise type generally offers the most robust 
feature set. The autonomous access point is best suited for small networks with only a few 
access points or wireless hotspots, because they must be managed independently, and there-
fore the scalability is somewhat limited. 
 
 The industry terminology for access points is not clearly defined. What 
might be considered a consumer-grade or SOHO-grade access point from 
one vendor might be considered the opposite from another vendor. In fact, 
some access points might even be considered both consumer-grade and 
SOHO-grade access points. 
 The Consumer-Grade Access Point 
Consumer-grade access points , or home broadband wireless routers, are usually 
equipped with an Internet port, several ports for Ethernet connections, and a wire-
less access point. The routers are confi gured through a web browser using either the 
HTTP or HTTPS protocol. Confi guration of the devices is fairly simple for the novice 
user using a web browser via a built-in web server. In most cases, a broadband wireless 
router connects to either a cable modem or a digital subscriber line (DSL) connection, 
available from an Internet service provider (ISP). In this confi guration, a router is able to 
accept wired and wireless connections for computers and other devices, providing them 
with access to the LAN or the Internet. A wireless broadband router usually includes the 
following features: 
 
■
 Network Address Translation (NAT) 
 
■
 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server 
 
■
 Internet Protocol (IP) routing 
 
■
 Domain Name System (DNS) services 
 
■
 Built-in firewall 
 A wireless broadband router has many of the same features a SOHO-grade access 
point has. Although consumer-grade access points contain a number of features, they 
do not have the same hardware capabilities that the more expensive enterprise-grade 
access points contain, such as processing power and random access memory (RAM). 
Therefore, they usually support a lesser number of associated client stations. An 
example of an IEEE 802.11ac dual-band Gigabit wireless broadband router is shown 
in Figure  3.3 .

The SOHO-Grade Access Point
Although they are powerful devices, SOHO-grade access points usually have a less 
extensive feature set than enterprise-grade access points. However, all newer-model 
consumer-grade, SOHO-grade, and enterprise-grade access points now support the high-
est standards-based security options available, including IEEE 802.11i or Wi-Fi Protected 
Access 2.0 (WPA 2.0) certifications. SOHO-grade access points are best used in the SOHO 
or home environment and usually have a limited number of connections for computers and 
devices. SOHO-grade access points typically have the following features:
■
■
IEEE 802.11 standards support
■
■
Wi-Fi Alliance interoperability certifications
■
■
Removable antennas
■
■

Figure 3.4 shows an example of a SOHO-grade access point. You will notice that one 
difference between a SOHO-grade access point and a consumer-grade wireless broadband 
router is the available connection ports. Whereas the broadband router is usually equipped 
with an Internet port and several ports for Ethernet connections, the SOHO-grade access 
point typically has only one Ethernet port to connect to a LAN.

In Figure 3.4, notice that unlike the consumer-grade access point, this device has only a 
single PoE-capable Ethernet connection and no Internet WAN connection or USB port.
IEEE 802.11 Standards Support
All later-model SOHO-grade access points support the current IEEE 802.11 standard. 
Some older devices may not have firmware updates available, which can cause implemen-
tation challenges where interoperability between newer and legacy devices is required. In 
this case, I recommend replacing older equipment with the most current, state-of-the art 
models. The 802.11 standard and amendments that are supported will vary based on sev-
eral factors, including the cost and complexity of the unit. The most common consumer-
grade and SOHO-grade access points support the IEEE 802.11b, IEEE 802.11g, IEEE 
802.11n, and now IEEE 802.11ac communication amendments. Most equipment manu-
facturers make dual-band models, but the cost is normally higher than single-band (IEEE 
802.11b/g/n) access points. See Chapter 2, “Wireless Local Area Networking, Standards, 
and Certifications,” if you need to review these 802.11 amendments to the standard.

 Interoperability certifi cations from the Wi-Fi Alliance are a common feature of SOHO-
grade access points. As mentioned in Chapter  2 , these certifi cations include WPA/WPA 2.0 
and WPS for security, and WMM and WMM-PS for QoS (Quality of Service). Selecting a 
SOHO-grade access point that is Wi-Fi certifi ed ensures compliance with IEEE standards 
and interoperability with other IEEE 802.11 wireless devices. 
 
 In December 2011, a security flaw was reported with WPS and should be 
considered before using this feature. See the warning in the section “Wi-Fi 
Protected Setup Certification Overview” in Chapter  2 and check the device 
manufacturer’s website for more information. 
 Removable Antennas 
 Some SOHO-grade access points are equipped with removable antennas. This allows the 
end user to change to a larger (higher-gain) antenna, thereby allowing an RF to cover a 
wider area. Conversely, connecting a smaller (lower-gain) antenna will decrease the cover-
age area. Many SOHO-grade access points have fi xed or non-removable antennas, so you 
cannot add a higher-gain antenna. 
 
 The RF coverage area of an access point can be increased by adding a 
higher-gain antenna to the access point. For more information on this and 
other antenna-related information, see Chapter  5 , “Antenna Technology for 
Wireless Networking.” 
 Static Output Transmit Power 
 Occasionally an end user will have the ability to adjust the transmit output power in a 
SOHO-grade access point. If this is available, the settings are usually very basic, such as 
low, medium, and high. With enterprise access points, you can change the power in incre-
ments of a milliwatt (mW) or a decibel milliwatt (dBm). The transmit output power of the 
access point will determine in part the area of RF coverage, also known as the  RF cell or 
basic service area (BSA). A cell is the area of RF coverage of the transmitter—in most cases, 
a wireless access point. The typical RF transmit power of a SOHO-grade access point is 
about 15 dBm, or 32 mW, although this will vary with the manufacturer. An access point 
model with static output power settings cannot be adjusted, which will limit your ability to 
decrease or increase the size of the RF cell. Changing the RF cell size will allow the access 
point to cover a larger area in the home or small offi ce where the device is installed. In this 
case, the only way to change the RF cell size is to change the gain of the antenna in models 
that have the removable antenna feature. Note that replacing the antenna will also change 
the vertical and horizontal beamwidths, which is the electromagnetic radiation pattern that 
propagates away from it.

Advanced Security Options
All newer-model SOHO-grade access points support the highest security features, includ-
ing the IEEE 802.11i amendment and WPA 2.0 personal and enterprise operation modes. 
These security features give users with limited technical knowledge the ability to provide the 
most up-to-date security for their wireless network. For those users who have greater technical 
know-how, SOHO-grade access points also provide more advanced security features, such 
as user-based authentication IEEE 802.1X/EAP and VPN pass-through. Users can find 
more information about these advanced features in most user guides provided with the 
access point or online at the device manufacturers’ websites.
Wireless Bridge Functionality
SOHO-grade access points can sometimes be configured in wireless bridge mode. Both 
point-to-point and point-to-multipoint settings are available. This enables administra-
tors to connect two or more wired LANs together wirelessly using IEEE 802.11 equip-
ment. You learned about point-to-point and point-to-multipoint settings in Chapter 1, 
“Computer Networking Fundamentals.” Wireless bridging is discussed later in this 
chapter.
Wireless Repeater Functionality
Some SOHO-grade access points can be configured to function as wireless repeaters. 
Configuring an access point as a repeater enables administrators to extend the size of the 
RF cell so that devices not in hearing range of an access point can connect to the wireless 
network. The cost, however, is reduced throughput for other devices accessing the network 
through a wireless repeater, in addition to more contention. Wireless repeaters are dis-
cussed later in this chapter.
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Server
It is also common for SOHO-grade access points to be able to act as DHCP servers. A 
DHCP server will automatically issue an IP address (logical address) to allow upper-
layer communication between devices on the network. IP addresses are a function of 
Layer 3 of the OSI model, as outlined in Chapter 1. A built-in DHCP server will ease 
the installation and support of the access point, providing a much better overall user 
experience.
Configuration and Settings Options
SOHO-grade access points are configured via a web browser, using either HTTP 
(Hypertext Transfer Protocol) or HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure). This type 
of browser-based configuration is an easy way for the novice administrator to make all 
the necessary settings based on the application in which the access point will be used. 
SOHO-grade access points rarely offer configuration from the command-line interface 
(CLI), which allows for more extensive configuration parameters. Figure 3.5 shows an 
example of a configuration page from a SOHO-grade access point.

The Wireless Access Point

 For security reasons, it is best practice to confi gure access points from the wired side of 
the network infrastructure whenever possible. Confi guration of an access point should only 
be done wirelessly if absolutely necessary. If confi guring this device from the wireless side 
of the network is the only option, a secure connection such as HTTPS or SSH2 should be 
in place to prevent potential compromise of administration user credentials and unauthor-
ized access of the wireless device. 
 
 Some manufacturers of consumer-grade and SOHO-grade wireless equip-
ment have online emulators that allow customers to view a sample of the 
configuration process for a device. This allows users to sample the configura-
tion settings and become familiar with the device before making a purchase.  
 The Enterprise-Grade Access Point 
Enterprise-grade access points typically have a much more extensive feature set than the 
previously mentioned SOHO-grade access points. Taking this into consideration, the price 

88 
Chapter 3  ■  Infrastructure and Client Devices Used with Wireless Networking  
point can be significantly higher for enterprise-grade access points. Figure 3.6 shows an 
example of an enterprise-grade access point.
F i g u r e  3 .6    The Aruba Networks 220 series IEEE 802.11ac dual-band access point
Enterprise-grade access points can include the following features:
■
■
IEEE 802.11 standards support
■
■
Wi-Fi Alliance interoperability certifications
■
■
Removable or expandable antennas
■
■
Adjustable output transmit power
■
■
Advanced security options
■
■
Multiple operation modes, including root access point, wireless bridge, wireless 
repeater, and mesh capabilities
■
■
Graphical user interface (GUI) and command-line interface configurations
In addition to the items listed here, enterprise-grade access points have various other 
features that put them a notch above consumer-grade and SOHO-grade access points. 
Some of these features are outdoor use, plenum ratings, industrial environment ratings, 
more memory, and faster processors to help handle the load and various environmental 
conditions.
IEEE 802.11 Standards Support
Like the other access point types discussed in this chapter, enterprise-grade access points 
support IEEE standards. Enterprise-grade access points have a more extensive feature set 
than SOHO-grade access points and, depending on the manufacturer and model, will 
support all communication standards by using the 5 GHz IEEE 802.11a/n/ac and the 
2.4 GHz IEEE 802.11b/g/n dual-band radios. Enterprise-grade access points can include 
support for some amendments to the standard not supported by SOHO-grade access 
points. Examples include support for IEEE 802.11e QoS, Wi-Fi multimedia certifications, 
IEEE 802.11r fast BSS transition (FT), and IEEE 802.11w for the security of management 
frames, to name a few.

The Wireless Access Point 
89  
Wi-Fi Alliance Interoperability Certifications
Certifications by the Wi-Fi Alliance are an important feature of enterprise-grade access 
points. These certifications include WPA/WPA 2.0 for security and WMM and WMM-PS 
for QoS. Selecting an enterprise-grade access point that is Wi-Fi certified ensures compli-
ance with IEEE standards and interoperability with other IEEE 802.11-compliant devices.
Removable or Expandable Antennas
Many enterprise-grade access points have removable or expandable antenna capabilities. 
These antenna configurations provide a lot of flexibility, because an installer can choose the 
appropriate antenna based on the deployment scenario. Omnidirectional, semi-directional, 
and highly directional antennas are all types of antennas commonly used in the enterprise 
environment. Enterprise-grade access points that use internal antennas can offer options 
for connecting external antennas, should they be required for the specific installation. 
Antennas will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 5.
Adjustable Output Transmit Power
Unlike consumer-grade and some SOHO-grade access points, the RF output power of the 
radio can be adjusted with enterprise-grade access points. This feature allows an installer 
to select the correct amount of transmit power based on the installation needs of the access 
point. One benefit of having adjustable output power is that an installer can adapt to the 
environment in which the access point is installed. If the RF dynamics of an area change, 
the ability to change access point settings such as output transmit power without physical 
intervention is beneficial.
Advanced Security Options
Compared to access points used in the consumer and SOHO environments, enterprise-
grade access points typically have more advanced security features. In addition to IEEE 
802.11i, WPA/WPA 2.0, passphrase and user-based authentication, and IEEE 802.1X/EAP 
modes, features such as a built-in user database for local Remote Authentication Dial-In 
User Service (RADIUS) authentication are included. Local RADIUS authentication allows 
small- to medium-sized businesses to provide their own advanced authentication features 
without the need of external RADIUS authentication services. This reduces costs and low-
ers administration overhead.
RADIUS is just one example of the more advanced security features available in enterprise-
grade access points. Another advanced security feature that may be available is some level 
of a wireless intrusion prevention system (WIPS). A WIPS will help determine and have the 
potential to mitigate certain levels of wireless intrusions or attacks on the network. One 
example is the detection of a rogue (unknown) access point.
Advanced security features are discussed in more detail in Chapter 8, “Security 
Fundamentals for Wireless Networking.” Some of the common configuration options avail-
able for one model of enterprise access point are shown in Figure 3.7.

Multiple Operation Modes
In addition to the features just discussed, enterprise-grade access points typically have sev-
eral operation modes:
Root Access Point Mode (the most common configuration)    What some in the industry 
refer to as root access point mode is typically the default operation mode in which an 
enterprise-grade access point operates. Root access point mode involves connecting the 
access point to a distribution system (DS), such as an Ethernet segment or a network  
infrastructure of some sort. This mode allows computers and other wireless devices to  
connect to the access point and use network resources based on the assigned permissions  
of the user, computer, or other wireless device.
Wireless Bridge Mode (for connecting LANs together)    This configuration allows an 
access point to be set in bridge mode for wireless point-to-point or point-to-multipoint con-
figurations connecting two or more LANs. Benefits of using wireless access points to bridge 
LANs together include cost savings and high data transfer rates compared to some other 
wired connectivity options.
Wireless Repeater Mode (to extend the RF cell)    An access point configured in wireless 
repeater mode can act to extend the RF cell. This allows wireless client devices outside the 

The Wireless Access Point 
91
radio hearing range of an access point to still be able to connect to the network and access 
network resources via the wireless repeater. This operation mode does have the downside 
of reduced throughput and should be used only if justifi ed because of no wired connectivity 
that allows the access point/repeater to connect to the network. 
Mesh Mode (for connecting access points together wirelessly)  If an access point has mesh 
capability, it can be confi gured to connect access points together without using a wired 
infrastructure. This is useful in areas where the physical distance from the network seg-
ment to the access points exceeds the 328-foot or 100-meter limitation. This is what was 
formerly known as a  wireless distribution system (WDS). The term WDS is now considered 
obsolete and has been removed from the latest revision of the IEEE 802.11 standard. 
 
 If an enterprise-grade access point is configured for an operation mode 
other than an access point, it is no longer considered an access point. 
Typically an access point can be configured to operate in only one mode 
at any one time. Also, if an enterprise-grade access point is dual-band 
capable, it may be possible to configure each band (radio) as a different 
operation mode. 
 Access Point Configuration Methods 
 Enterprise-grade access points can commonly be confi gured, or “staged,” two different ways: 
Graphical User Interface (GUI) Configuration  Enterprise-grade access points can be 
confi gured using a GUI confi guration from a web browser using HTTP or HTTPS. This 
is a convenient way to confi gure and change settings on the access point using a common 
graphical interface tool, a web browser. If the access point is confi gured using a wireless 
connection, using HTTPS is recommended for security at a minimum, but an SSH or IPsec 
VPN connection is highly recommended. 
 Command-Line Interface (CLI) Configuration  Most if not all enterprise-grade access 
points have  command-line interface (CLI) capabilities to allow extensive and detailed 
confi guration of the device. In some cases, the CLI command set provides higher-level com-
mands that allow an administrator to perform additional confi guration tasks that aren’t 
available using the web browser method. This allows consistency in confi guring other 
network infrastructure devices, because many manufacturers share common commands 
among devices. CLI capabilities vary depending on the manufacturer, but most enterprise 
models have an extensive set of commands. Access points with CLI capabilities may have 
a special console port on the device, allowing a direct serial connection to a computer to 
access for confi guration purposes. 
 Controller-Managed Access Points 
Controller-managed access points differ from autonomous access points in that they are 
used with hardware WLAN controllers, not as stand-alone devices. An autonomous access 

92 
Chapter 3  ■  Infrastructure and Client Devices Used with Wireless Networking  
point is a self-contained unit that has all the intelligence needed to provide computer and 
device access to a wireless network. In contrast, controller-managed access points have 
shifted some of the intelligence to the hardware WLAN controller. Since a controller-
managed access point may contain less intelligence than an autonomous access point, the 
cost of a controller-managed access point may be lower, depending on the local MAC 
capabilities.
Controller-managed access points are centrally managed from the hardware WLAN 
controller. The extent of how this is accomplished depends on the type of architecture that 
is in use: local MAC, split-MAC, or remote-MAC. Split-MAC is the most commonly used 
architecture, with the controller handling the management and control planes and the 
access point taking care of the real-time MAC functionality and the Physical layer com-
munications. How manufacturers implement the technology varies. Typically, communica-
tion between the access point and the controller is handled by an IP or proprietary tunnel 
that is built from the access point to the controller. Depending on the manufacturer, they 
may have a more extensive feature set than autonomous access points, while also including 
many of the features of those devices. Figure 3.8 shows front and rear views of a controller-
managed access point.

The Wireless Access Point 
93  
The benefits of controller-managed access points are similar to those of autonomous 
access points, including RF management, security, and QoS. With remote MAC controller-
managed access points, very little or no intelligence is contained within the devices. 
Controller-managed access points are PoE capable for ease of deployment in either mid-
sized or large organizations. One thing to keep in mind is that if a controller-managed 
access point is unable to communicate with the WLAN controller for some reason,  
the access point may be able to still provide communications to the associated client 
devices. How this is achieved widely varies, based on how the manufacturer implements  
the technology.
Cloud-Managed Access Points
Cloud-managed access point technology provides another solution for deploying WLAN 
infrastructures. The architecture for networks that use this type of access point is some-
times referred to as a “controller-less” architecture, because the device intelligence has been 
pushed back out to or distributed to the access point edge, similar to that of the autono-
mous access point, but with much more intelligence and capabilities. The access points are 
managed through a “cloud” software configuration tool, eliminating the need for a hard-
ware controller. This type of management tool can be accessed from any computer with an 
Internet connection, assuming the user has appropriate permissions to manage the devices. 
Some manufacturers also have “software appliances,” eliminating the reliance on the cloud 
server because the software is contained locally with the organization’s datacenter network. 
Figure 3.9 shows an example of a cloud-managed access point.
F i g u r e  3 . 9    ADTRAN/Bluesocket 2030 IEEE 802.11ac (3x3:3) indoor access point
Cloud-managed access points provide many of the same benefits and features of a WLAN con-
troller solution without the need and extra expense of a hardware controller. This technology is 

94 
Chapter 3  ■  Infrastructure and Client Devices Used with Wireless Networking  
 scalable and performs well without relying on a “tunnel” from the access point to a controller 
through which some or all of the network traffic can be forwarded. This distributed intelligence 
allows the cloud-managed access point to make decisions about how frames traverse both the 
wired and wireless network without relying on the hardware controller.
Some manufacturers of controller-managed solutions provide a variant of the cloud 
technology by allowing autonomous access points to be “adopted” by a controller in a large 
enterprise environment. These access points are then site survivable, meaning they will still 
be able to function on their own should connectivity with the controller be temporarily 
lost. The description of this technology includes the term adaptive access point.
Wireless Branch Router/Remote Access Point
A wireless branch router, or remote access point, can be used to extend a corporate net-
work to a remote location, such as a home, conference room, or branch office, through 
a secure connection using a WAN or the Internet. This type of device typically has three 
interfaces available:
■
■
Ethernet port(s) to connect to a LAN
■
■
Internet port to connect to the WAN or to an Internet connection
■
■
Wireless port to allow IEEE 802.11 computers and devices to connect to a network 
through a wireless connection
Wireless branch routers are usually compact and lightweight, making them easy for 
sales representatives and other corporate employees to travel with. They also have a more 
extensive feature set than wireless broadband routers, including the capability of building 
a Layer 3 VPN tunnel between devices in which the router on each side will act as a VPN 
endpoint. They can also be configured as a VPN pass-through device, allowing another 
device on the network, such as a VPN concentrator, to act as the VPN endpoint. They also 
include these features:
■
■
Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)
■
■
Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol/Internet Protocol Security (L2TP/IPsec)
■
■
SSH2
■
■

Wireless Mesh 
95  
Wireless Mesh
Wireless mesh networking continues to grow at a steady pace. The concept of mesh net-
working has been in existence for many years. In a full mesh network, all nodes connect 
together with at least two paths for every node. This allows for reliable communication in 
the event of a device or path failure.
Wireless mesh networking is popular in the outdoor market space. Most outdoor mesh infra-
structure devices provide the highest levels of wireless security and are usually inside a rugged 
weatherproof enclosure for protection from the elements. Wireless mesh networks are currently 
utilized in places such as metropolitan areas, university campuses, and amphitheaters, as well as 
for applications used with public safety, transportation, and government organizations.
Currently, many WLAN manufacturers use proprietary mechanisms and protocols for wire-
less mesh networking. IEEE 802.11s is an amendment to the IEEE 802.11 standard to include 
wireless mesh networking and was ratified in 2011. Many enterprise-grade access points have 
the ability to operate in mesh mode, whereas others have a dedicated mesh function.
Wireless mesh networking for indoor deployments is starting to appear as a viable solu-
tion for some WLAN infrastructure deployments.
Manufacturers commonly recommend using two unlicensed RF bands for a wireless 
mesh operation. One common solution is to use the 2.4 GHz ISM band for wireless client 
device access and the 5 GHz UNII band for mesh device infrastructure connectivity. The 
use of a third radio may be an option in some cases. Using two different RF bands reduces 
contention on a single band and increases the overall performance of the network.
Mesh can also be used in the event of Ethernet loss to an access point. Some cloud-­
managed access points are able to automatically mesh together when they suffer an 
Ethernet loss. By default, they typically support clients in both bands, but they can mesh 
in 5 GHz if an Ethernet connection fails.
Figure 3.11 illustrates mesh access points connected to a wired infrastructure.

Chapter 3 ■ Infrastructure and Client Devices Used with Wireless Networking
 
 Some manufacturers may provide as many as four radios in a mesh access 
point. The fourth radio could utilize the 4.94–4.99 GHz licensed band, 
which is restricted to public safety use only (in the United States). 
 Wireless Bridges 
Wireless bridges connect two or more wired LANs. As discussed in Chapter  1 , typically 
there are two confi gurations for wireless bridges: point-to-point and point-to-multipoint. A 
wireless bridge is a dedicated device that functions in much the same way as an access point 
in bridge mode. Wireless bridges have many of the same features as enterprise-grade access 
points, including removable antennas and selectable power levels. 
 Connecting locations together using wireless bridging has many benefi ts, including fast 
installation, cost savings, and high data transfer rates. Depending on the circumstances, 
a wireless bridge can be installed in as little as one day or even several hours. Cost sav-
ings can be enormous compared to installing and maintaining a physical wired connection 
between locations, whether it is copper, fi ber optics, or a leased line from a service provider. 
 Most wireless bridges can work in either the 2.4 GHz ISM or 5 GHz UNII unlicensed 
band. Keep in mind, however, that bridges using wireless technology can also consist of 
proprietary technology using licensed frequency bands, which may be capable of greater 
distances and faster speeds than wireless bridges that use IEEE 802.11 devices. The connec-
tion can span long distances, so it is important to take security and environmental condi-
tions into consideration, as well as the proper antenna selection. 
 Figure  3.12 illustrates wireless bridges connecting two LANs in two separate buildings.

 When LANs are connected using wireless bridges, the bridges must be set 
to the same RF channel and have the same SSID. 

Wireless Repeaters/Range Extenders 
97  
Wireless Repeaters/Range Extenders
Wireless repeaters are used to extend the RF cell. In a wired Ethernet network, repeaters 
function at Layer 1 of the OSI model to extend the Ethernet segment. An Ethernet repeater 
lacks intelligence—that is, it cannot determine data traffic types and simply passes all data 
traffic across the device. Since wireless infrastructure devices, including repeaters, are  
Layer 2 devices, they have more intelligence than Ethernet repeaters.
An Ethernet segment has a maximum distance for successful data transmission, and 
WLANs do as well. This distance depends on several factors, including the transmit power 
of the access point and the gain of the antenna. Like an access point, the wireless client 
device is also a transmitter and a receiver and will have an RF range limited by the transmit 
power and gain of the antenna. A wireless repeater provides the capability for computers 
and other devices to connect to a WLAN even when outside the normal hearing range of 
the access point connected to the network. Figure 3.13 illustrates how a wireless repeater 
can extend the range of a wireless network.
F i g u r e  3 .13    A wireless repeater extends the range of a wireless network.
Layer 2 Switch
Access Point
Repeater
Wireless Client
As illustrated, the wireless client device is not within hearing range of the access point, 
so adequate communication is not possible between these devices. In order for WLAN 
devices to communicate effectively with an access point, the transmitter must be able to 
hear the receiver, and the receiver must be able to hear the transmitter. It is a two-way 
radio communication. A wireless repeater will allow this communication to occur where 
the wireless client is outside the RF cell or BSA of the access point. The wireless client will 
send information, or frames, to the repeater, and the repeater will forward them to the 

98 
Chapter 3  ■  Infrastructure and Client Devices Used with Wireless Networking  
access point, and vice versa. The downside of this configuration is that it will reduce the 
overall throughput. The wireless repeater may be named differently by the manufacturer 
and include the term wireless range extender.
Using Wireless Repeaters Reduces Throughput
Before using a wireless repeater, consider whether it would be the best solution. Since 
WLANs are half-duplex (two-way communication but only one way at a time), data 
throughput will suffer when repeaters are used. When data traverses a wireless link 
between devices that are set to the same RF channel, the data throughput can be reduced 
by up to 50 percent. If a physical wired connection is available, it should be used for an 
access point connection rather than a wireless repeater. For security purposes, the Ether-
net port on a wireless repeater should be disabled because it is not connected to a wired 
network infrastructure.
Wireless LAN Controllers and Cloud-
Managed Architectures
The WLAN hardware controller is a main component in many WLAN deployments. 
WLAN controllers range from branch office models with a few controller-managed access 
points to large-scale enterprise devices with hundreds or even thousands of controller-­
managed access points. The branch office models are typically used in remote office instal-
lations or small/medium business (SMB) applications with a limited number of access 
points. The controller-less, or cloud-managed, architecture is growing at a fast pace and 
provides another option for enterprise WLAN deployments. The following sections discuss 
some of the many benefits and features available on both WLAN controllers and cloud-
managed controller-less solutions:

Centralized Administration
WLAN controllers and cloud-managed, controller-less solutions provide centralized admin-
istration and give an administrator complete control over the wireless network from a sin-
gle physical location. Unlike autonomous access points, which require intervention at each 
device for configuration, these solutions can be a “one-stop shop” for configuration and 
management of the wireless network. A wireless network management system (WNMS) 
can be used as a centralized tool to manage WLAN infrastructures. A WNMS can be used 
to help scale the access point architecture as well but is not required.
Virtual Local Area Networks
According to the IEEE 802.1Q standard, VLANs define broadcast domains in a Layer 
2 network by inserting VLAN membership information into Ethernet frames. Layer 2 
Ethernet switches can create broadcast domains based on how the switch is configured, 
by using VLAN technology. This allows an administrator to separate physical ports into 
logical networks to organize traffic according to the use of the VLAN for security profiles, 
QoS, or other applications. The concept of a Layer 2 wired VLAN is extended to IEEE 
802.11 WLANs. Both hardware controller and controller-less solutions have the ability 
to configure broadcast domains and segregate broadcast and multicast traffic between 
VLANs.
Power over Ethernet Capability
WLAN controllers and cloud-managed solutions support PoE, allowing DC voltage and 
computer data to be sent over the same cable. (The details of PoE are discussed later in this 
chapter, in the section “Power over Ethernet.”) Some hardware controllers provide direct 
access point connectivity to the controller at the device connection layer and will provide the 
PoE. For hardware controllers that do not support direct connectivity and cloud-­managed 
solutions, the access points will receive their PoE from the Layer 2 Ethernet switch.

100 
Chapter 3 ■ Infrastructure and Client Devices Used with Wireless Networking
 Improved Mobile Device Transition 
 Fast, seamless Layer 2 and Layer 3  transitioning or  roaming between access points is 
another common feature of hardware wireless controllers and cloud-managed solutions. 
This feature makes it possible for computers and other wireless devices connected to the 
WLAN to maintain a connection while physically moving throughout the wireless net-
work. The IEEE 802.11r amendment specifi es fast transition (FT), and the IEEE 802.11k 
helps with this functionality. Transitioning is more often than not an enterprise network 
requirement and exists in very few SOHO deployments. 
 Wireless LAN Profiles and Virtual Wireless LANs 
 Both the WLAN controller and controller-less cloud-managed solutions can give network 
administrators the ability to create a variety of confi guration profi les. These profi les can 
work in conjunction with VLANs to allow or deny access based on requirements for the 
computer, device, or user. Profi les can be confi gured for various situations, including dif-
ferent SSIDs for guest, corporate, and voice networks; security confi gurations; and QoS 
support. Each WLAN profi le will create a virtual access point with its own BSSID and will 
act as though it is a separate physical device. This includes all the wireless management 
traffi c that works with WLAN technology. 
 
 Although Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is now rare and not recom-
mended to be used in any WLAN, it may still exist in deployments that use 
legacy devices, such as wireless bar code scanners or wireless print serv-
ers. Using WLAN profiles, you can allow this type of legacy device to be 
located on a separate wireless VLAN without compromising the security of 
the entire network. However, if WEP is still used, I highly recommend mov-
ing away from it as soon as possible by upgrading legacy devices. 
 Advanced Security Features 
 Like autonomous access points, hardware wireless controller and cloud-managed solutions 
provide advanced security options. These include security options based on IEEE 802.11i 
and WPA/WPA 2.0, with both passphrase and enterprise confi guration capabilities, allow-
ing for the most secure mechanisms available for WLAN technology, including IEEE 
802.1X/EAP, RADIUS, and certifi cates as used in most enterprise deployments. 
 Captive Web Portals 
 Captive web portal capability is a common feature in hardware WLAN controllers and 
cloud-managed systems. A  captive web portal will intercept a user’s attempt to access the 
network by redirecting them to a web page for authorization of some sort. This web page 
may request account credentials, payment information from a user, or a simple agreement 
to terms and conditions before granting access to the wireless network. One common 

Wireless LAN Controllers and Cloud-Managed Architectures 
101  
example of where you will see a captive portal is in a paid or free wireless hotspot. The  
captive portal can be hosted by an outside service provider, by an autonomous access point, 
by a hardware wireless controller, and in a cloud-managed system on the access point. It 
is important to note that some mobile devices may experience issues while connecting to a 
wireless network with captive web portal technology enabled.
Built-in RADIUS Services
Another common feature of WLAN controllers and cloud-managed systems is RADIUS 
services for 802.1X/EAP authentication, which is supported by WPA and WPA 2.0. 
Built-in RADIUS allows a network administrator to utilize the most advanced security 
features available today to secure the wireless network. Built-in RADIUS servers typically 
limit the number of users that can be created in the user database, which means that built-
in RADIUS is a good solution for SMB or remote office locations but not for very large 
organizations. Larger networks can use external RADIUS services for scalability.  
See www.gnu.org/software/radius for more about this server.
Predictive Modeling Site Survey Tools
Predictive modeling site survey tools assist in the placement of access points and other 
wireless infrastructure devices. These tools are sometimes a feature of a hardware WLAN 
controller. Performing a predictive modeling site survey will assist in planning to determine 
coverage and capacity for data and voice for both indoor and outdoor deployments. Some 
manufacturers of cloud-managed enterprise solutions have web-based online predictive 
modeling site survey tools. Aerohive is one example of a manufacturer that provides these 
online wireless network planning tools. Visit the following website for more information 
and instructions on how to access this tool:
www.aerohive.com/planner
Radio Frequency Spectrum Management
Keeping an eye on the RF environment is another responsibility of the wireless network 
administrator. RF spectrum management consists of adjusting RF parameters such as the 
RF channel (frequency) and the RF transmit power after deployment. This allows the net-
work to adapt to changes in the environment and assist in the event of hardware failures.
Firewalls
An integrated stateful firewall feature helps protect a network from unauthorized Internet 
traffic but still allows authorized traffic. Firewalls can be hardware-based, software-based, 
or a combination of the two. Stateful firewalls, which keep records of all connections passing 
through them, help protect against broadcast storms, rogue DHCP server attacks, Address 
Resolution Protocol (ARP) poisoning, and other potential attacks against the WLAN.

Quality of Service
QoS features help time-critical applications, such as voice and video communications, min-
imize latency and allow for traffic prioritization. With the continual expansion of voice and 
video technology in the WLAN arena, QoS is becoming an increasingly important compo-
nent in the wireless network.
Infrastructure Device Redundancy
Infrastructure device redundancy allows for fault-tolerant deployments and provides unin-
terrupted access in the event an access point or WLAN controller fails. Complete redun-
dancy will prevent a major outage caused by hardware failure for mission-critical or other 
deployments. Coverage is maintained by alternating access points between the redundant 
infrastructure devices, minimizing interruption for user access in the event of a hardware 
failure. Cloud-managed systems eliminate the need of redundant hardware WLAN control-
lers, and the technology allows for redundancy in the event of an access point failure.
Wireless Intrusion Prevention System
A WIPS monitors all activity across the wireless network for potential intrusion and mali-
cious activities. A WIPS can take appropriate action to mitigate an attack based on the type 
of intrusion. WIPS will be discussed further in Chapter 8.
Direct and Distributed Access Point Connectivity
Connecting access points that are not directly plugged into a port on the WLAN control-
ler is a feature known as distributed access point connectivity. It’s beneficial in large-scale 
deployments, and almost all manufacturers support it. Direct access point connectivity is 
defined as a direct connection to ports on the switch and is typically used with device con-
nection layer hardware wireless controllers.
Layer 2 and Layer 3 Access Point Connectivity
Early wireless network implementations were built with dedicated Layer 2 connectivity, 
which meant limited wireless mobility. Layer 2 transition (roaming) occurs when a com-
puter or other wireless client device moves out of the radio cell of the currently associated 
access point and connects to a different access point maintaining Layer 2 connectivity.
As wireless networking technology evolved, so did the need for Layer 3 connectivity and 
transition. IP addresses are logical Layer 3 addresses that identify devices on a network. 
All IP devices on the same network or subnet are considered to be in the same IP boundary. 
Layer 3 roaming occurs when a client moves to an access point that covers a different IP 
subnet. After a transition, the client will no longer have a valid IP address from the original 

Wireless LAN Controllers and Cloud-Managed Architectures 
103  
subnet, and the device will be issued an IP address from the new subnet while maintaining 
Layer 3 connectivity.
Figure 3.14 illustrates Layer 2 and Layer 3 connectivity and wireless transition.

Distributed and Centralized Data Forwarding
WLAN controller solutions consist of two common types of architectures: centralized and 
distributed. Early WLAN controller solutions supported the centralized architecture (split-
MAC architecture). This design separated the intelligence from the access point and placed it 
into the wireless controller to allow for centralized management and control of the wireless 
network. The access point, for the most part, was just a radio and antenna, and traffic deci-
sions were sent to the controller through an Ethernet cable. This technique is also known as 
centralized data forwarding. Depending on where the controller was placed, it could cause 
bottlenecks and other issues in the case of an overloaded or poorly designed network infra-
structure. With the data rates possible with IEEE 802.11n and now IEEE 802.11ac, the aggre-
gate throughput could be too much for the network to handle, resulting in poor performance.
Distributed data forwarding reduces the amount of infrastructure traffic because the 
controller-managed access point is able to make more decisions, taking some of the load 
away from the wireless controller. Moving some of the intelligence back to the edge (the 
wireless access point) minimizes the bottlenecks and other potential issues such as latency. 
This is also true in a cloud-managed or controller-less architecture, thus eliminating the 
need for the data to be sent to the controller for handling.
Most enterprise WLAN equipment manufacturers now support both the centralized and 
distributed WLAN architectures.

Power over Ethernet
PoE sends DC voltage and computer data over the same Ethernet cable, enabling a device to 
receive DC power and computer data simultaneously. This eliminates the need for an exter-
nal alternating current (AC) power source to be near the Ethernet device.
An Ethernet cable has four copper wire pairs, or eight copper wires. Depending on the 
technology in use, either two or all four wired pairs may be used to carry data traffic. 
Figure 3.15 shows an example of a standard Ethernet cable pin assignment.

PoE now consists of two ratified amendments to the IEEE 802.3 standard. They are 
defined in 802.3-2012 Clause 33, also known as IEEE 802.3af, and IEEE 802.3at, some-
times called PoE+. These amendments define the specifications for devices used in wired or 
wireless networking to receive DC power from the Ethernet connection without the need 
for an external DC power source. The PoE amendments to the Ethernet standard allow 
electrical power to be supplied in one of two ways, either over the same wired pairs that  
carry computer data or over the wired pairs that do not carry data. 10BaseT and 100BaseT 
(Fast Ethernet) implementations use only two wired pairs (four wires) to carry data. 1000BaseT 
(Gigabit Ethernet) may use all four pairs (eight wires) to carry computer data. The standard 
defines which wire pairs are allowed to carry the DC power based on whether the  
network is 10BaseT, 100BaseT, or 1000BaseT, and whether the power is sourced from an 
endpoint or midspan injector. Both midspan and endpoint injectors are explained later in 
this chapter.
The nominal voltage for PoE is 48 volts of direct current (VDC), but the amendments 
allow for a range of 44 to 57 VDC at the power source. The PoE amendments address 
two types of devices: power sourcing equipment (PSE), the device that provides of the DC 
power, and the powered device (PD), the device that receives the DC power.

Power over Ethernet 
105
 
 Before PoE was standardized, some manufacturers used proprietary imple-
mentations. These solutions used various voltages, polarities, and pin 
assignments and may still be on the market today. I recommend that you 
verify PoE standard compliance before using this technology to prevent 
potential hardware or device failures. 
 The IEEE 802.3-2012 Clause 33 (802.3af) amendment was released in 2003 and allo-
cates 15.4 watts (W) of power maximum per port. This amendment has been incorporated 
into the IEEE 802.3-2012 standard. The IEEE 802.3at amendment, PoE+, was released 
in 2009 and includes changes to add to the capabilities of the IEEE 802.3-2008 standard, 
with higher power levels and improved power management information. IEEE 802.3at 
allows for 34.2 W of power per port maximum, a big increase over IEEE 802.3af, which 
allowed for 15.4 W per port. IEEE 802.3af PoE will work with access points from all man-
ufacturers of enterprise-grade IEEE 802.11n access points. Using IEEE 802.3af will make it 
easier for organizations to transition from older-model access points to the newer 802.11n 
technology, which will improve their client service and provide overall better performance 
without having to immediately upgrade their PoE infrastructure to IEEE 802.3at. 
 Power Sourcing Equipment 
 The  power sourcing equipment (PSE) is the device that supplies the DC voltage to the end 
devices that receive the DC power. The DC voltage (power) can be delivered to the device in 
one of two ways: 
 
■
 An  endpoint injector (usually a WLAN controller or a Layer 2 Ethernet switch) 
delivers DC power directly over the same wire pairs that carry data over the unused 
wire pairs. 
 
■
 A  midspan injector (usually a single-port or multiple-port injector) injects DC power 
into the Ethernet cable over the unused wire pairs or over the data pairs, depending on 
the version of the standard in use. 
 Midspan Injectors 
 Midspan PoE injectors provide the required DC voltage (48 VDC) into the Ethernet cable, 
allowing the access point, bridge, or other PD to receive electrical power and computer 
data. There are two types of midspan devices: single-port injectors and multiport injectors. 
A single-port injector supplies power to a single device. This is useful in an implementation 
that may have only a few PoE devices. A single-port injector is an in-line device that adds 
DC power to the Ethernet cable. A multiport injector can supply DC power to many devices 
simultaneously. It is an in-line device that functions like a patch panel. Two ports on this 
device are required to supply both DC power and computer data to a single PD, such as an 
access point, bridge, or IP camera. Therefore, a 24-port injector will allow connectivity for 
only 12 devices. 

106 
Chapter 3  ■  Infrastructure and Client Devices Used with Wireless Networking  
Endpoint Injectors
Endpoint PoE injectors supply DC power and computer data directly at the Ethernet port, 
rather than relying on an intermediate device to supply the power. WLAN controllers and 
Ethernet switches are examples of endpoint devices. A benefit of endpoint PoE is that no 
intermediate adapter to inject power is necessary.
Powered Devices and Classification Signatures
The powered device (PD) is defined as the device receiving DC power, such as a wireless 
access point, wireless bridge, IP camera, IP phone, and so on. The IEEE 802.3 standard 
defines the maximum cable length of an Ethernet cable to be 328 feet, or 100 meters. 
Because of line loss, the standard specifies less maximum power than what is available at 
the port. Table 3.1 shows the maximum power allowed for both the PSE and the PD.

Equipment manufacturers have the option of defining a classification signature. The 
classification signature determines the maximum amount of power a device requires, 
thereby allowing the PSE to better manage the amount of power delivered to a specific port.  
The PoE amendments make five classes of powered device available (class 0 through class 4). 
Table 3.2 shows the available classes and the amount of power in watts for each class for 
IEEE 802.3-2012 Clause 33 devices.

 It is important to note that the “power budget” of the power source 
equipment must be considered. The total amount of DC current a PSE 
can supply will determine how many devices that draw the power can be 
connected to the power source. This may cause some design constraints, 
and you may not have enough DC power to supply to all of the connected 
devices. Understand that each device will draw the required amount of 
DC power for it to operate. For example, all dual-band, enterprise-grade 
802.11n access points can now operate in 3x3:3 MIMO mode using 802.3af 
power, which allows a maximum of 15.4 watts per port. However, the 
access points may only draw approximately 12 watts of power. If the total 
maximum amount of power available in a 24-port switch is 185 watts (the 
power budget), that would allow only 12 access points to be connected, 
assuming the ports are allowing 15.4 watts each. Twelve ports multiplied 
by 15.4 watts each is 184.8 watts of available power. IEEE 802.3at PoE can 
be used for devices that may require more DC power, such as some IEEE 
802.11ac access points, which would qualify as Class 4 devices, shown in 
Table 3.2.

 Benefits of PoE 
 There are many benefi ts to using devices that support PoE, including cost savings and con-
venience. The IEEE 802.3 standard (Ethernet) specifi es a maximum distance of 100 meters, 
or 328 feet, for unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) Ethernet cable. PoE enables a PoE device to 
receive DC power and computer data at this distance without the need for electrical power 
at the point where the device is installed or located. This can amount to a big cost savings 
if a voltage source is not available where the device is located, because there is no need to 
install electrical power at that point.

Chapter 3  ■  Infrastructure and Client Devices Used with Wireless Networking  
Radio Hardware Used with Wireless 
LAN Technology
WLAN client devices require some type of radio hardware or chipset to send the digital 
data (all the ones and zeros) across the air using RF. It is important to understand that 
based on the IEEE 802.11 standard, every addressable unit used in a WLAN is considered 
a station (STA). This includes both client devices that connect to the network and wireless 
access points that allow devices to connect to and use network resources.
Another point to consider is that with the recent advancements in WLAN technology, 
including the release of the IEEE 802.11n/ac amendments, client device selection will need 
to be carefully considered. Although it is beneficial to use 802.11n/ac-capable client devices 
along with the newer 802.11n/ac multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) access points, 
radio technology used in 802.11a/b/g devices may benefit from MIMO technology as well. 
Selecting the correct wireless adapter will allow a user to take advantage of the newest 
WLAN technology available.
Many organizations now have to deal with the Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) subject. 
This is a trend in which employees bring their own personal electronic wireless devices, 
such as tablets and Wi-Fi-enabled smartphones, to the office or place of business. These 
devices will then have access to company resources, including email services, file servers, 
computer data, and printers. This may create problems for technical support and security 
issues. BYOD is forcing organizations to address this in corporate policies.
USB 1.0, USB 1.1, USB 2.0, and USB 3.0
Introduced in 1995, the Universal Serial Bus (USB 1.0) standard was designed as a replace-
ment for legacy serial and parallel connections.
Serial communication is the process of transmitting one data bit at a time. Parallel com-
munication has the capability of transmitting several data bits at a time. Imagine a single-
lane road compared to a four-lane highway. On a single-lane road, only one car at a time 
can travel, whereas on a four-lane highway, many cars can traverse the same path at the 
same time.
USB allows connectivity for various devices that once used serial and parallel data con-
nection ports. These devices include but are not limited to the following:
■
■
Keyboard
■
■
Mouse
■
■
Digital camera
■
■
Printer
■
■
Computer networking adapter
■
■
HDMI video using a converter adapter

USB 1.0, USB 1.1, USB 2.0, and USB 3.0 
109
 USB 1.0 specifi ed data rates from 1.5 Mbps to 12 and was replaced by USB 1.1 in 1998. 
Devices using this version of the standard were more common in the market. 
 USB standards are implemented by the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF). This organi-
zation consists of companies from the computer and electronics industries, including Intel, 
Microsoft, NEC, and HP. 
 The  USB 2 . 0 specifi cation was released in April 2000. The fi rst revision appeared in 
December 2000, and the standard has been revised several times since. USB 2.0 incorpo-
rates several changes, including connector types. Data rates now allow for a maximum 
speed of up to 480 Mbps. (USB 1.0 supported a maximum of 12 Mbps.) 
 Figure  3.17 shows an example of a USB 2.0 port. 
 f I g U r e   3 .17    USB 2.0 port on notebook computer panel 
USB 2.0 port
 USB 3.0 technology was introduced in early 2010 and is commonly available to the point 
of being included on newer system boards. USB 3.0 devices have faster transfer rates and 
use a wider bandwidth, and they allow multiple logical streams and improved bus use with 
asynchronous readiness notifi cation without polling. USB 3.0 greatly increases the transmis-
sion speed from the 480 Mbps of USB 2.0 up to 4.8 Gbps. This is more than 10 times that of 
the earlier standard, and as a result USB 3.0 is known as  SuperSpeed . In addition to speed, 
the new USB 3.0 specifi cation addresses improvements to the technology, including band-
width, by using bidirectional data paths, power management, and improved bus utilization. 
 Features of USB 
 USB uses a standard connector that replaces 9-pin serial, 25-pin parallel, and various other 
connector types. External confi guration allows the user to plug in the USB device and 
power it with a single USB port. The computer operating system will guide the user through 
the device driver installation process. External installation minimizes the need to open up 
a computer case and make adjustments within the computer, such as switch or jumper set-
tings. USB also supports hot-swapping of devices, allowing connection and disconnection 
without the need to power down the device or the computer. In some cases, USB allows for 
power to be delivered to the peripheral device, eliminating the need for an external power 
supply. Rarely will you see a device with PC card or ExpressCard interfaces, and most use 
only USB ports for adding peripheral devices.

 Peripheral Component Interconnect 
 PCI is the acronym for  Peripheral  Component  Interconnect , a standard for computer inter-
face cards that was developed by Intel. A PCI card is inserted into a slot in the main board 
or motherboard of a desktop computer, allowing for the attachment of peripheral devices. 
Installing a PCI card may require basic tools such as a screwdriver, and the installer usu-
ally will need to remove the cover from the desktop computer case. Figure  3.18 shows an 
example of an IEEE 802.11 wireless PCI card. 
 f I g U r e   3 .18    NETGEAR WG311T IEEE 802.11g wireless PCI adapter 
 Features of PCI 
 A PCI adapter connects to what is known as a  data  bus in a desktop computer. In basic 
terms, a data bus allows connection of devices to the computer’s processor or “brain.” In 
the early days of personal computers, many devices used a data bus. These devices included 
video, hard disks, serial ports, Ethernet adapters, and parallel ports for printers. These 
interfaces connected to what is known as an  Industry  Standard  Architecture (ISA) bus. 
 Modern computers have integrated many of these interfaces directly into the mother-
board, system board, or main board. As PC technology evolved, so did the data bus archi-
tecture, going to 32-bit and now 64-bit bus. Wireless networks are no strangers to PCI. Even 
though wireless is often thought of as portable or mobile, in many cases stationary desktop 
computers can utilize WLAN connectivity through the use of wireless PCI interface cards.

Installation and Configuration of PCI Cards
Back in 1995, Microsoft introduced a feature in the Windows 95 operating system called 
Plug and Play (PnP). This new feature accelerated the interest in PCI. PnP made install-
ing a PCI card a snap. All that was required was for the installer to plug the card into 
the motherboard, and it would be recognized and automatically work with the operating 
system. However, this process still required user intervention to open the case in order to 
physically install the card. Exercise 3.2 describes the steps for installing a PCI card in a 
desktop computer.

Mini-PCI is a variation of the PCI standard, designed for laptops and other small-footprint 
computer systems. One common example of a Mini-PCI card is the IEEE 802.11 Mini-PCI 
adapter shown in Figure 3.19.

cards are used in access points and client devices such as laptop or notebook computers.
Mini-PCI Express (Mini-PCIe) cards are a replacement for the Mini-PCI card and are 
based on PCI Express.

Chapter 3 ■ Infrastructure and Client Devices Used with Wireless Networking
 
 Many notebook and portable computers with built-in WLAN use 
either Mini-PCI or Mini-PCIe or now Half Mini-PCIe cards for wireless 
IEEE 802.11 WLAN connectivity. 
 Features of Mini-PCI, Mini-PCIe, 
and Half Mini-PCIe Cards 
 Mini-PCI cards are available in three types: Type I, Type II, and Type III. Types I and 
II cards use a 100-pin stacking connector. Type III cards use a 124-pin edge connector. 
Type II cards have RJ11 and RJ45 connectors for telephone and Ethernet network connec-
tions. These cards are commonly located at the edge of the computer or docking station so 
that the connectors can be mounted for external access, such as to a modem or computer 
network. 
 Mini-PCIe cards are 30 mm × 56 mm and have a 52-pin edge connector, consisting of

 Installation and Configuration of Mini-PCI, Full 
Mini-PCIe, and Half Mini-PCIe Cards 
 As with the PCI card installation process, Mini-PCI and Mini-PCIe installation may 
require the user to physically install hardware in the computer. Location of the Mini-PCI or 
Mini-PCIe interface varies depending on the computer manufacturer. On some computers, 
you just have to remove a cover panel on the bottom of the notebook. On others, you need 
to disassemble the computer case. Exercise 3.3 describes the typical installation steps.

Installing mini-pCI and mini-pCIe Cards 
 The following steps are typical for the installation of a Mini-PCI and Mini-PCIe WLAN card 
on a notebook computer. Exact installation steps are specifi c to the manufacturer, and I 
recommend that you follow the manufacturer’s setup instructions. 
 1. 
 Shut down the computer. Verify that the computer is not in Hibernation mode. If it is, 
turn on the computer and perform a complete shutdown. 
 2. 
 Disconnect the AC power cord from the wall jack. 
 3. 
 Disconnect all connected peripherals and remove the battery pack. 

118 
Chapter 3  ■  Infrastructure and Client Devices Used with Wireless Networking  
4.	
Remove the panel covering the Mini-PCI—Mini-PCIe compartment. (Details of this 
step will depend on the computer model.)
5.	
Insert the Mini-PCI or Mini-PCIe card into the correct slot. Note the correct pin  
orientation.
6.	
Connect the wireless antenna cables to the Mini-PCI or Mini-PCIe card.
7.	
Replace the panel for the Mini-PCI—Mini-PCIe compartment.
8.	
Replace all peripheral devices and battery pack. Plug in the AC power cord to the  
wall jack.
9.	
Visit the manufacturer’s support website to get the most current installation files and 
device driver. You can search the support website by entering the model number of the 
adapter into the search bar. If an Internet connection is not available, you can use the 
setup CD that comes with the adapter to install the client utility. Power on the computer 
and execute the setup program you downloaded or insert the Setup CD-ROM into 
the CD-ROM drive. The program should start automatically, and a welcome or Auto-
run screen may appear. When the screen appears, click Install Drivers and follow the 
onscreen instructions to install and configure the wireless Mini-PCI or Mini-PCIe card.
Always read the manufacturer’s manual regarding installation and safety before  
attempting installation.
Replacing a Full Mini-PCIe with Half Mini-PCIe Adapter
Upgrading an IEEE 802.11g wireless Full Mini-PCIe card to a newer IEEE 802.11n/ac Half-
Mini PCIe card may require the use of a special adapter or bracket. Keep in mind that the 
Half Mini-PCIe card is about half the length of the Full card, and you may not be able to 
install the card securely. Therefore, you may need to purchase a special bracket in order 
for the new Half Mini-PCIe card to be securely mounted in the notebook computer or 
other device where the card is to be installed.
Wireless Workgroup Bridges
A wireless workgroup bridge (WWB), also known as a wireless client bridge, is a wireless 
device acting as a client device that will allow potentially several Ethernet devices on an 
Ethernet segment (devices connected to a common Physical layer boundary) to connect to 
E x e r c i s e 3 . 3  (c o n t i n u e d)

Wireless Workgroup Bridges

an infrastructure through a wireless access point. This is accomplished without the need to 
upgrade each wired device on the Ethernet segment to wireless. Figure 3.21 illustrates an 
application of a WWB.
F i g u r e  3 . 21    Typical application for an enterprise WWB
Features of Wireless Workgroup Bridges
The WWB can be used in a variety of business or SOHO applications, including enterprise, 
medical, retail, education, and warehouse. Supported devices include computers, printers, 
scales, medical equipment, barcode readers, and point-of-sale machines, such as cash regis-
ters. Although the WWB may have the appearance and features of an infrastructure device, 
such as a wireless access point, it is considered a client device. A WWB will allow for a 
limited number of wired client devices to connect to and use network resources. A wireless 
access point sees a WWB as a single station even if several wired stations are connected, 
because the WWB multiplexes the signal to a single wireless connection. In other words, it 
is basically a multiplex device.
WWBs may include the following features:
■
■
Fixed or detachable antennas
■
■
Advanced security features
■
■
Web browser and/or command-line interface management utilities
■
■
MAC filtering options
■
■
Multiple connectivity modes
■
■
PoE
■
■
Support for connection of a limited number of client devices

120 
Chapter 3 ■ Infrastructure and Client Devices Used with Wireless Networking
 Installation and Configuration of Wireless 
Workgroup Bridges 
 The following are the steps usually necessary for installing and confi guring a WWB: 
 1. 
 Connect the WWB to the Ethernet segment that needs to have a wireless connection. 
 2. 
 If PoE is not a feature of the device, connect the bridge power adapter to the wall jack. 
 3. 
 Using a web browser, connect to the assigned IP address. In some cases it may be nec-
essary to assign an IP address to the WWB from a CLI prior to configuring the bridge. 
 4. 
 From the web management interface, assign the correct SSID and RF channel in order 
to associate to the correct access point. 
 5. 
 Configure the correct security settings, either WPA or WPA2 and Personal or Enter-
prise mode. 
 6. 
 Verify association of the WWB to the desired access point. 
 
 Always read the manufacturer’s manual regarding installation and safety 
before attempting installation. 
 Another form of WWB is one that is designed to allow a variety of single Ethernet 
devices, not just computers, to connect to and use wireless networks. These devices will have 
an Ethernet port but are not wireless-capable. This type of client bridge also has character-
istics similar to some infrastructure devices, such as wireless access points. One benefi t is 
that in most cases no software is required—that is, you will not have to install device driver 
or client utility software on the client Ethernet device. These devices are seen by the access 
point as a single wireless client. Devices that can benefi t from this type of client bridge are 
printers, DVD/media players, and game consoles. Figure  3.22 shows a wireless client bridge.

Client Utility Software 
121  
Client Device Drivers
All devices connected to a computer require a device driver. Components requiring drivers 
include keyboards, mice, video cards, USB ports, printers, wired network interface cards, 
IEEE 802.11 WLAN cards, and many others. The device driver is software that allows the 
installed device to communicate with or take instructions from the computer operating sys-
tem in order to provide correct functionality.
It is important to verify the latest revision of the device driver from the client device 
manufacturer. Having the latest revision installed will ensure correct operation and 
sometimes add additional features. Figure 3.23 shows a device listing in the Windows 10 
Professional operating system.
F i g u r e  3 . 2 3     Microsoft Windows 10 Professional Device Manager utility
Client Utility Software
All IEEE 802.11 WLAN cards require configuration in order to connect to a wireless net-
work. The configuration capabilities of device drivers are usually very limited. Therefore, a 
user needs additional configuration software. The user can choose from either manufacturer-
specific utilities or third-party client utilities built into some operating systems.  

122 
Chapter 3  ■  Infrastructure and Client Devices Used with Wireless Networking  
When IEEE 802.1X port-based authentication is used, the client device is known as the 
supplicant. The supplicant will provide authentication credentials to the authenticator, 
which in wireless networking is the access point. 802.1X authentication will be discussed 
in more detail in Chapter 8. Regardless of the client utility installed, a user has the capa-
bility to create a profile that will retain the connection/session parameters. A profile will 
contain information regarding a specific connection, including network name or SSID and 
security settings.
Manufacturer-Specific Client Utilities
Most manufacturers of WLAN adapters provide a software client utility for the wireless 
adapter. The features of the utility depend on whether the client is SOHO-grade or 
­enterprise-grade. SOHO-grade client utilities have basic connection and security 
­parameters. The client software installation usually is part of the adapter install process 
and is typically performed through a setup wizard. Figure 3.24 shows a screenshot from a 
SOHO-grade client utility.
F i g u r e  3 . 2 4     Linksys Dual-Band Wireless-N USB client utility
Enterprise-grade client utilities may have a more advanced feature set, including con-
nection statistics and site survey. Typically, a user can install the device driver and client 
utility simultaneously or will be able to choose separate installation procedures. In most 
enterprise-grade client utilities, profile setup is a manual process requiring a user to have 
a basic understanding of the adapter’s capabilities as well as the network configuration. 
Figure 3.25 shows an enterprise-grade client utility.

Third-Party Client Utilities
Another option for a WLAN adapter client utility is a third-party utility built into a com-
puter operating system. Recent versions of the Microsoft Windows operating system—
Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 10, for example—have a client utility built in and 
running as a service.
In later versions, such as Windows 10, the service is now called the WLAN AutoConfig. 
After the wireless adapter is installed, a user may select a wireless network to connect to 
and supply security parameters if required. Figure 3.26 shows the Windows 10 Professional 
client utility using the Microsoft AutoConfig service.

Chapter 3  ■  Infrastructure and Client Devices Used with Wireless Networking  
Summary
This chapter discussed network infrastructure devices, which are commonly used to pro-
vide wireless connectivity to a computer network for computers and other wireless client 
devices. The infrastructure devices include the access point (an integral part of the WLAN 
and available as a self-contained intelligent, or autonomous, device), a controller-managed 
device for use with hardware WLAN controllers, and a cloud-managed access point that 
provides user and client device access to network resources. Other infrastructure devices 
include wireless broadband routers for SOHO or home use, wireless bridges for connecting 
LANs together, and wireless repeaters for extending an RF cell.
This chapter also explored some of the features, benefits, and applications of these 
infrastructure devices. In addition, we took a look at the two PoE amendments (IEEE 
802.3-2012 Clause 33, also referred to as 802.3af, and IEEE 802.3at), components, the DC 
voltage and amount of DC power supplied to devices (in watts), and how the power may be 
delivered to a PD.
Many types of WLAN client devices are used in various applications. These device types 
include desktop and notebook computers, printers, and barcode scanners, to name a few. A 
wireless client adapter uses radio hardware or chipset to send the digital data (all the ones 
and zeros) across the air using RF. This chapter looked at some of the various IEEE 802.11 
WLAN adapter types, explaining the features, common hardware, software, and configu-
ration procedures. External adapters with WLAN functionality include the following:
■
■
USB 2.0
■
■
USB 3.0
WLAN adapters are also available as internal adapters. These adapters may require 
some disassembly or removal of a panel for installation. Internal adapter types include the 
following:
■
■
PCI
■
■
Mini-PCI
■
■
Full Mini-PCIe
■
■
Half Mini-PCIe
WLAN adapters require a device driver in order to communicate with the operating 
system, and in most cases software utilities may be installed and/or configured in order to 
connect the wireless network. This chapter described several installation scenarios for vari-
ous types of WLAN adapters, including USB and PCI. We also looked at how a WWB can 
be used to connect computers and other devices on an Ethernet segment to a network by 
connecting to an access point.
Finally, this chapter showed how WLAN client utilities simplify the process of connect-
ing to a wireless network. Client utilities are sometimes supplied by the manufacturer of the 
adapter or may part of the operating system. WLAN AutoConfig (Windows 10) is a com-
monly used operating system client utility.

Radio frequency (RF) plays an essential role in wireless LAN 
(WLAN) technology. Radio waves are passed through the air 
(which is the medium) and are used to get information from 
one wireless device to another. Technically speaking, with respect to WLANs, RF consists 
of high-frequency alternating current (AC) signals passing over a copper cable connected 
to an antenna. The antenna then transforms the signal into radio waves, which propagate 
through the air from a transmitter to a receiver.
Unlike wired devices, which use physical cable to communicate, WLANs use the radio 
waves and the air to communicate. This chapter will discuss the characteristics of RF and 
explain how far a radio signal will travel depending on various factors, the area covered 
by the RF propagation, and some of the factors determining how many clients or devices 
can use the RF signals for data communications. This chapter will also explain the range 
and speed of RF transmissions. Range (how far radio waves will travel) and speed can be 
affected by several environmental conditions or behaviors, such as reflection and refraction. 
Additionally, this chapter will examine some of the conditions that affect the transmission 
of information across the air, including interference.
Understanding RF units of measure, such as watts (W), milliwatts (mW), and decibels 
(dB), is important to RF work, just as understanding denominations of money is an impor-
tant part of daily life. We will discuss RF signal measurements, including receiver sensitiv-
ity, received signal strength indicator (RSSI), and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
Understanding Radio Frequency
Radio frequency (RF) waves are used in a wide range of communications, including radio, 
television, cordless phones, WLANs, and satellite communications. RF is around everyone 
and everything, and comes in many forms. RF energy is emitted from the numerous devices 
that use it for various types of communications. For the most part, it is invisible to humans. 
There is so much of it around that if you could actually see RF, it would probably scare 
you. Don’t let it scare you, however, because the amount of regulated RF power transmit-
ted from the devices used with wireless computer networking is harmless. Figure 4.1 shows 
some of the many ways RF is used. Studies have shown that the amount of power emitted 
from many of these devices, such as cordless telephones or wireless network adapters, will 
not cause any physical harm if the devices are manufactured not to exceed the maximum 
regulated power allowed for the device.

Remember, RF consists of high-frequency alternating current (AC) signals passing over a 
copper cable connected to an antenna. This antenna will then transform the received signal 
into radio waves that propagate through the air. The most basic AC signal is a  
sine wave, which is the result of an electrical current varying uniformly in voltage over a 
period of time. This sine wave cycle will repeat a specific number of times (cycles) over a 
period of one second. The number of cycles per second will result in different frequencies. 
Figure 4.2 shows a basic sine wave.
Successful radio transmissions consist of a minimum of two components, a transmit-
ter and receiver (see Figure 4.3). With IEEE 802.11 wireless networking, a wireless sta-
tion can transmit and receive and is known as a transceiver. These two components work 
together: For every radio transmitter, there must be one or more radio receivers. It is 
important to understand the basic characteristics of RF transmissions. These characteris-
tics work together to form AC signals and include the wavelength, frequency, amplitude, 
and phase. The antenna will transform these signals into radio waves that travel through 
the air carrying information from the transmitter to the receiver. This is accomplished in 
different ways, depending on the wireless technology in use. This theory will be discussed 
more in Chapter 5, “Antenna Technology for Wireless Networking.”

 The IEEE 802.11ah amendment (also known as  Wi-Fi HaLOW ) allows 
for WLAN operation in frequency bands below 1 GHz (also called the 
Sub 1 GHz band , or S1G). This allows for long-range, low-power connec-
tions using an unlicensed frequency, including the 900 MHz frequency band. 
The actual frequency ranges used vary based on regulatory domains. The 
driving force behind this amendment is the Internet of Things (IoT) devices.  
 Frequency in Wireless LANs 
Frequency is defi ned as the number of complete cycles in one second. Low frequencies cor-
respond to long waves, and high frequencies to short waves; so, the higher the frequency, 
the shorter the wavelength (range). From a WLAN perspective, if all things were equal, 
such as radio transmit power and antenna gain, the range of a 2.4 GHz signal would be 
approximately twice as far as a 5 GHz signal because of the difference in wavelengths. In 
formulas, frequency is typically identifi ed by the lowercase letter  f . 
 Figure  4.5 shows an example of frequency.

 how Far Can a Signal Travel? 
 A few years back, 900 MHz cordless telephones were very popular. Cordless telephones 
were introduced in the 1970s, and in 1990 the FCC opened the 900 MHz range for these 
telephones. With a 900 MHz phone, you could hypothetically go up to 500 feet away from 
the cordless phone’s base station before losing the signal and no longer being able to 
make a phone call. In the past few years, higher-frequency phones have increased in pop-
ularity. After upgrading to a 2.4 GHz phone, you may have noticed you can get only about 
250 feet away (half the distance compared to a 900 MHz phone) in the same environment 
before losing the signal. This is because the 2.4 GHz wavelength is about half the distance 
of a 900 MHz wavelength, assuming both phones are operating at the same output power. 
With 5.8 GHz cordless telephones, the range is still less, assuming the same amount of 
transmit power.

Chapter 4  ■  Radio Frequency Fundamentals for Wireless Networking  
IEEE 802.11 WLANs work in several unlicensed frequency ranges. The unlicensed 
ranges used for WLANs are from 2.4 GHz to 2.5 GHz and from 5.15 GHz to 5.875 GHz. 
There are some areas in the 5.15 GHz to 5.875 GHz range that are not used for standards-
based wireless networking. With respect to wireless networking, think of the wavelength 
and frequency as the range or distance a signal will propagate.
Amplitude in Wireless LANs
From a WLAN perspective, the amplitude is the strength or the amount of power of an RF 
signal. This is calculated from the height (in a two-dimensional view), on the y-axis of the 
sine wave, representing the voltage. A basic sine wave is a change in voltage over a period 
of time. Using a formula, the voltage at the peak of the signal can be used to calculate the 
amount of RF power. So an increase in amplitude is equal to an increase in RF power. An 
increase in power is also known as gain. Conversely, any decrease in amplitude will be a 
decrease in power. A decrease in power is known as loss. If a transmitter outputs a certain 
amount of RF power (for example, 100 mW0, then it has a specific amplitude of some 
value. As this signal travels through an RF cable, it will have a specific level of loss based 
on the type and length of cable in use, resulting in attenuation. Therefore, the result will be 
less amplitude at the end of the cable due to the loss value of the cable.
Figure 4.6 shows two signals operating at the same frequency with different amplitudes. 
The signal with the higher amplitude (Signal A) is more powerful than the signal with the 
lower amplitude (Signal B). With respect to wireless networking, think of the amplitude as 
the amount of transmitted or received RF power.

Phase in Wireless LANs
Phase is the difference in degrees at a particular point in the time of a cycle, measured from 
some arbitrary zero and expressed as an angle. For example, if a second sine wave starts a 
quarter of a wavelength after the first sine wave, it is considered to be 90° out of phase with 
the first sine wave. Figure 4.7 shows an example of the phase relationship between two 
AC signals. Two radio waves that have the same frequency but start at different times are 
known to have a phase difference and are considered out of phase with one another. The 
amount of the phase difference is typically measured in degrees, ranging from 0° to 360°.

Waves that arrive at a receiver out of phase will experience some level of distortion, 
which will cause corruption in a single radio system. This is known as multipath. The dif-
ference in time of arrival of the main signal and a reflected signal that causes the multipath 
problem is called the delay spread. If two waves arrive at a receiver 180° out of phase, this 
will usually result in a cancellation effect or nullify the two signals. Conversely, two waves 
that arrive in phase are additive, and this will result in an increase in signal strength known 
as upfade. Keep in mind, however, that the amplitude of the waves that experience the 
upfade effect will never be higher than the wave transmitted. With respect to wireless net-
working, think of the signal phase as it pertains to interference (multipath) and the modula-
tion of an RF signal.
Radio Frequency Used in Wireless LANs
As discussed in Chapter 2, “Wireless Local Area Networking, Standards and 
Certifications,” RF spectrum is governed by local regulatory agencies. The country where 
the RF is used determines the regulations, such as frequency use and maximum power. 
Table 4.2 illustrates examples of local RF regulations.

 U.S. (FCC) Unlicensed Frequency Bands 
 In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is the local 
regulatory agency responsible for regulating licensed and unlicensed radio spectrum. 
Listed are the unlicensed RF bands available in the United States for use with wireless 
communications: 
 
■
 ISM (Industrial, Scientific, and Medical): 
 
■
 902−928 MHz 
 
■
 2.400−2.4835 GHz 
 
■

■
 5.25−5.35 GHz: UNII-2, lower middle 
 
■
 5.470−5.725 GHz: UNII-2e, upper middle 
 
■
 5.725−5.825 GHz: UNII-3, upper 
 
 The 5.725−5.875 GHz UNII band is used in the United States for a single 
channel (165). The IEEE 802.11-2016 Standard Clause 17 section 17.3.8.4.1 
reads, “The OFDM PHY shall not operate in frequency bands not allocated 
by a regulatory body in its operational region. Regulatory requirements for 
a given frequency band are set by the regulatory authority responsible for 
spectrum management in a given geographic region or domain.” The FCC 
allows this frequency for IEEE 802.11 wireless networking. It is important 
to note that as of April 2014, the FCC rules changed and channel 165 (5.825 
GHz), which was previously categorized as an ISM channel, now falls under 
the UNII band.

 The IEEE 802.11 standard addresses the 2.4 GHz ISM band and the 5 GHz UNII band. 
In the United States, the 2.4 GHz ISM band allows for 11 of 14 total channels to be used 
for WLAN communications. The 5 GHz UNII band consists of four bands utilizing four 
frequency ranges: UNII-1, the lower band; UNII-2 and UNII-2e, the middle bands; and 
UNII-3, the upper band. Table  4.3 shows unlicensed frequency bands and channels used 
by IEEE 802.11 WLAN technology. Keep in mind that the 5.725−5.875 GHz UNII band is 
used where allowed by the regulatory agency.

 Radio Frequency Channels 
 As you have seen, RF is divided into bands. These bands can be further separated into 
channels . A channel is a smaller allocation of a RF band. One familiar application in 
which this is accomplished is television. Until over-the-air television became available in 
digital format, television was allocated certain frequency ranges. Common television 
channels operated in the very high frequency (VHF) band—for example, channels 2 through 
13 operated from 54 through 216 MHz. This frequency range was divided into 12 channels, 
allowing optimal use of the frequency range for the application—in this case, television 
signals. 
 A viewer can change channels on a television to watch different programs running 
simultaneously. Only one program can be viewed at any one time, however, depending 
on which channel is currently selected. (Picture-in-picture televisions can show two or 
more channels at once on the screen, but each picture is still being received on a different 
channel.) 

142 
Chapter 4  ■  Radio Frequency Fundamentals for Wireless Networking  
WLANs use channels in the same way. Certain unlicensed frequency ranges are allo-
cated for wireless networking, and those frequency ranges are subdivided into channels. 
In order for a transmitter and receiver to communicate with one another, they must be on 
the same channel. The 2.4 GHz ISM band has a total of 14 channels available for wireless 
networking. The locale where they are used will determine which of the 14 channels can be 
legally used for wireless networking. In the United States, IEEE 802.11b/g/n wireless net-
works use 11 of the 14 channels available in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. Each of these 11 chan-
nels for DSSS or HR/DSSS technology is 22 MHz wide, and for OFDM technology it is 
20 MHz wide. Understand that these channels are further defined by their center frequency; 
for example, Channel 1 in the 2.4 GHz ISM band has the center frequency at 2.412 GHz. 
Simple arithmetic shows there will be overlap in order to accommodate all of the 20 MHz 
or 22 MHz wide channels in this frequency range. Table 4.4 shows the 14 available chan-
nels in the 2.4 GHz range.

The 5 GHz UNII band is also divided into channels. This band consists of four bands—
lower, lower middle, upper middle, and upper. These four bands consist of four different 
frequency ranges. Since there are fewer channels in the same amount of space, channels in 
the UNII band do not overlap. In the 5 GHz UNII band, channels are 20  MHz wide.  
Table 4.5 shows the 5 GHz UNII band for the FCC and ETSI locales.

Radio Frequency Range
RF range for WLANs is based on the wavelength or distance of a single cycle—the higher 
the RF, the shorter the range of the signal; and the lower the frequency, the longer the 
range of the signal. At the same output power level (amplitude), a 2.4 GHz signal will 
travel almost twice as far as a 5 GHz signal. If the transmit power of a 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz 
device were increased or decreased, the range of the signal would also be affected. If a net-
work design is planning to use dual-band access points, range will need to be considered 
to ensure proper coverage for both the 2.4 GHz ISM and 5 GHz UNII bands. A wireless 
site survey will help determine the usable range an access point will produce. A survey can 
involve physically walking around the proposed space and/or predictive modeling using one 
of many software programs. This process is discussed further in Chapter 9, “Design for 
Wireless Networking.”
Wireless LAN Coverage and Capacity
Coverage and capacity are two key factors to take into consideration when designing and 
implementing an IEEE 802.11 WLAN. During the design phase of an IEEE 802.3 wired 
network, the design engineer will take capacity into account, verifying and validating that 
there are enough capacity switches, ports, and so on, for the user base of the network. The 
same is true for a wireless network. The number of devices/users connected to an access 
point and the applications they perform need to be carefully considered. The fact that wire-
less networks use a shared medium is an issue, because the more devices that are connected 
to an access point, the lower the performance may be, depending on what the devices are 

144 
Chapter 4 ■ Radio Frequency Fundamentals for Wireless Networking
doing. This capacity consideration will ensure satisfi ed end users and excellent network 
performance—proof of a successful wireless network design and deployment. 
 In wireless networks, coverage also needs to be considered. Coverage is determined by 
the RF cell size. In IEEE 802.11 wireless networks, a cell is the area of RF coverage of the 
radio transmitter—in most cases, an access point. Depending on implementation, wide 
coverage or large cell size may not be the best solution. A large space covered by a single 
access point could result in less than adequate network performance based on factors such 
as the user’s distance from the access point. The farther away from an access point, the less 
throughput a device or user will experience. This is because a weaker received signal will 
use a lower signaling rate due to the ability of a receiver to effectively demodulate the sig-
nal. The proprietary dynamic rate switching (DRS) process will allow an associated wire-
less device to adapt to the RF signal strength and signal quality in a particular location of 
the basic service area. As a wireless device moves away from an access point, the amount 
of received signal will decrease because of the free space path loss. When this occurs, the 
modulation type will change because the RF signal quality is less and thus a lower data rate 
will be realized. If users will be scattered throughout a large space, it will be best to have 
several access points covering the space to allow for optimal performance. 
 
 The term  cell has several different meanings, depending on the context. In 
the world of IEEE 802.11 wireless networks, a cell is the radio coverage area 
for a transmitter such as an access point or a client device. 
 Wireless LAN Coverage 
 The term  coverage has different meanings, depending on the context in which it used. For 
example, if you buy a gallon of paint, the label will specify the approximate coverage area 
in square feet (sq ft). If one gallon of paint covers 300  sq ft and the room you wish to 
paint is 900 sq ft, simple arithmetic shows at least three gallons of paint would be needed 
to effectively cover the room. 
 The concept is similar in IEEE 802.11 wireless networking. Unlike with paint, however, 
there is no simple rule that determines how much space an access point will cover with the 
RF energy it is transmitting. This coverage will depend on many factors, some of which 
include: 
 
■
 Physical size of the area 
 
■
 Bandwidth-intensive software applications in use or hardware applications, which may 
negatively impact the performance, thereby requiring smaller RF coverage cells 
 
■
 Obstacles, including building materials and propagation (the way radio waves spread 
through an area) 
 
■
 RF range 
 
■
 WLAN hardware in use, which affects coverage because higher frequencies, such as 
5 GHz, do not travel as far as lower frequencies, such as 2.4 GHz 
 
■
 Transmitter output power 

Wireless LAN Coverage and Capacity 
145  
You might initially assume that you want the RF signal to propagate over the largest 
area possible. But this may not be the best solution. A very large cell may allow too many 
devices to connect to a single access point, causing a decrease in overall performance. For 
those client devices connected at a greater distance, the performance will be lower than for 
stations closer to the access point. Figure 4.8 shows a large coverage area, approximately 
11,250  sq ft (1,046 sq m) covered with a single access point. This is an example of too large 
an area for a single access point.

will have lower performance.
Physical Size of the Area
Rarely, if at all, will a manufacturer of enterprise-grade IEEE 802.11 WLAN hardware 
commit to the amount of area an access point will cover. There are too many variables to 
take into consideration, which makes it difficult to specify an exact number. Some manu-
facturers, however, may estimate the effective range of the device or access point. A site 
survey of the area will help determine the coverage area of an access point. A manual sur-
vey will allow for testing to verify the distance a signal will travel. A predictive site survey 
will model the environment and determine the signal propagation. Chapter 9 discusses this 
concept further.
Applications in Use
The application types in use—either software or hardware—can affect the bandwidth of 
an access point. If the devices connected to an access point use bandwidth-intensive appli-
cations, such as a computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) 

146 
Chapter 4  ■  Radio Frequency Fundamentals for Wireless Networking  
application, it could result in poor throughput for all devices or users connected to that 
access point due to device contention and the shared medium. This is another example of 
where more access points, with each covering a smaller area, could be a better solution 
than a single access point covering a large area. Multiple access points could allow the 
high-bandwidth users to be separated from other parts of the network, increasing overall 
performance of the network.
Obstacles, Building Materials, Propagation,  
and Radio Frequency Range
Obstacles in an area, including building materials such as walls, doors, windows, and fur-
nishings, as well as the physical properties of these obstacles—thickness of the walls and 
doors, density of the windows, and type of furnishings—can also affect coverage. The RF 
used, either 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz, will determine how well a signal will propagate and handle 
an obstacle.
For example, a wall made from sheetrock or drywall materials may have an attenua-
tion value of about 3 dB to 4 dB, whereas a wall made of concrete may have an attenuation 
value of about 12 dB. Keep in mind that a 3 dB loss is actually one half of the amount of 
RF power. Therefore, the sheetrock wall would have less impact on the RF propagation 
than the concrete wall. Partitions, walls, and other obstacles will also determine the cover-
age pattern of an access point because of the way RF behaves as it travels through the air. 
Behaviors of RF will be discussed later in this chapter in the section “Environment: Radio 
Frequency Behavior.”
Wireless LAN Hardware and Output Power
The WLAN hardware in use can also have an impact on the coverage area. Examples 
include the antenna type, antenna orientation, and gain of the antenna. The higher the 
gain of an antenna, the greater the coverage area can be; conversely, the lower the gain of 
an antenna, the smaller the coverage area. The polarization of an antenna (horizontal vs. 
vertical) will also have an effect on the coverage area because of the different shapes of the 
radiation patterns. The output power of the transmitter or access point will also have an 
effect on coverage. The higher the RF transmit power, the greater distance a signal will 
propagate. A higher power signal will provide more coverage. Most enterprise-grade access 
points provide the capability to control or adjust the output power.
Wireless LAN Capacity
One definition of capacity is the maximum amount that can be received or contained. 
An example of this would be an elevator in a building. An elevator typically will have a 
maximum number of people or amount of weight it can hold; this is usually stated on a 
panel within the elevator. To ensure safety, the elevator may have a safety mechanism to 
prevent overloading. Likewise, a restaurant has a certain number of chairs to hold custom-
ers; therefore, they would have a maximum capacity of customers who can be served at any 
one time. Does this mean that when a restaurant fills its seats to capacity, the doors close 

Wireless LAN Coverage and Capacity 
147  
and no other customers can enter the building? Not necessarily. In some cases, a restaurant 
could have customers standing and waiting to be seated.
Just as an elevator or a restaurant has a limited number of people they can accommodate 
comfortably, wireless access points also have a limited number of devices and bandwidth 
they can handle, known as capacity. The capacity of an access point is how many devices 
or users the AP can service effectively, offering the best performance. This capacity depends 
on several factors, including:
■
■
Software and hardware applications in use
■
■
Desired throughput or performance
■
■
Number of devices/users
The following sections discuss how these factors affect the capacity of an access point.
What Happens When an Access Point Is Overloaded?
If the capacity of a single access point has exceeded the maximum number of users or 
devices based on the performance metrics, access points may need to be added. If a 
wireless network is installed correctly, an access point will not be overloaded with an 
excessive number of users. An overloaded access point will result in poor performance 
and therefore unhappy users.
Consider the restaurant example. If a restaurant seats 20 customers and all 20 seats are 
taken, the restaurant has reached its capacity. Let’s say the restaurant is short-staffed 
because two servers did not show up for work. The servers who did show up will have to 
work extra hard to handle the customers. This may cause delays in service because the 
servers need to handle more than their normal number of tables. The delays may result in 
unhappy customers.
The same is true for wireless access points. If a wireless access point has reached its 
capacity, it could get overloaded. This would result in its taking longer to handle any indi-
vidual request for access. The delays may result in unhappy users. This situation could 
justify adding another access point in the area to handle the additional users. Just as a 
restaurant will not close its doors when all seats are taken, an access point will continue 
to accept users to connect unless restrictions, such as load balancing, are implemented.
Software and Hardware Applications in Use
The software and hardware applications in use may affect the capacity of an access point. 
Some applications are more bandwidth-intensive than others. For example, word process-
ing applications may not require much bandwidth, whereas database or CAD/CAM appli-
cations may require much more bandwidth than other applications. If high-bandwidth 

148 
Chapter 4  ■  Radio Frequency Fundamentals for Wireless Networking  
applications are in use, the contention among the connected users will increase because 
they are using a shared medium (air and RF). Therefore, performance will potentially be 
reduced for all users connected to the access point. The access point is providing the same 
amount of bandwidth, but the overall performance has been decreased for the connected 
users because the software applications are all using a lot of bandwidth.
The use of Voice over Wireless LAN (VoWLAN) technology continues to increase in 
many wireless network deployments. This is an example of a hardware application. Voice 
technology on wireless networks is subject to latency. Therefore, depending on the num-
ber of voice client devices connecting to an access point, the network must be carefully 
planned. Capacity planning and quality of service (QoS) features are important when it 
comes to deploying voice technology on wireless networks.
Desired Throughput or Performance
The desired throughput or performance can also affect capacity. A large number of users con-
nected to an access point using a bandwidth-intensive application will cause poor performance. 
Therefore, it may be necessary to limit the capacity to a certain number of users to give the 
connected users the best performance possible. Any software application that is bandwidth-
intensive, such as CAD/CAM, streaming video, or File Transfer Protocol (FTP) downloads, 
can affect overall performance. One way to help resolve this would be to use a load-balancing 
method to limit the number of users who can connect to an access point. Another way would 
be to create RF cells with smaller coverage areas and add more access points.
Number of Devices/Users
The number of connected devices in an area will also affect the access point capacity. A single 
access point covering a large area will potentially allow for a large number of devices con-
necting to the access point. For example, an office of 8,000 sq ft may consist of 100 people, 
each with their own wireless device. This is an example of wide coverage and large capacity. 
The software applications in use on the wireless network will have an impact on the overall 
performance. If all 100 devices connected are using a CAD/CAM application, which is a 
bandwidth-intensive application, the overall performance will be poor because this type of 
application requires a lot of resources. Therefore, more access points, each covering less space 
and less capacity, would parlay into better overall performance for all of the users.
Wide coverage in a densely populated area may allow too many devices to connect to a 
single access point, resulting in poor performance overall. WLANs use what is known as 
a shared medium. In other words, all devices users connected to an access point will share 
the available bandwidth. Too many devices using powerful applications will overload the 
access point, adding to the poor performance issues. This scenario is considered a capacity 
issue. In this situation, more access points with each AP covering a smaller area and a lower 
number of devices or less capacity would be a better solution. As you learned in Chapter 3, 
“Infrastructure and Client Devices Used with Wireless Networking,” many organizations 
now have to deal with the “bring your own device” (BYOD) issue.
In addition to potential problems with technical support and security, WLAN capacity 
is also a major concern. The BYOD expansion of Wi-Fi devices is causing a wireless client 

Wireless LAN Coverage and Capacity

device density issue within the enterprise market. If a company’s corporate policy allows 
employees to bring their own wireless capable devices, then WLAN capacity needs to be 
carefully evaluated to address this potential issue. 
 Radio Frequency Channel Reuse and Device Co-location 
 The 2.4 GHz ISM band has a total of three nonoverlapping channels. In the U.S. FCC 
implementation of this band, the three nonoverlapping channels are 1, 6, and 11. This 
means there must be a separation of fi ve channels in order for them to be considered non-
overlapping. In the 2.4 GHz ISM band, channels are separated by 5 MHz on center. Taking 
this into consideration, channels must be separated by 25  MHz or greater in order to be 
considered nonoverlapping (IEEE 802.11-2016, Clause 16). This is calculated from fi ve 
channels of separation multiplied by 5  MHz on center (5 × 5 = 25). With deployments 
larger than a few access points, a channel plan may be necessary. A channel plan will mini-
mize the chance of interference caused by two transmitters (access points) set to the same 
or adjacent overlapping channels. 
 
 The IEEE 802.11-2016 Clause 15 specifies 30  MHz or greater of separation 
to be considered nonoverlapping: “Adjacent channel rejection is defined 
between any two channels with ≥ 30 MHz separation in each channel group 
defined in 15.4.4.3.” Keep in mind that this specification is for 802.11 DSSS. 
For HR/DSSS (IEEE 802.11-2016, Clause 16), channels must be separated by 
25  MHz or greater in order to be considered nonoverlapping. 
 Figure  4.9 illustrates a 2.4 GHz deployment with no channel planning. Users in the 
areas where the circles overlap will experience interference. This interference will result in 
lower overall throughput for the connected users because of the Physical layer (PHY) tech-
nologies that WLANs use. This interference basically has the same effect as collisions in an 
Ethernet network, resulting in retransmissions of data. 
 F i g u R e   4 . 9    Users of these access points will experience overlapping channel 
interference in a multichannel architecture because they are all set to the same channel.

A correct channel plan will implement channel reuse and ensure that overlapping cells will 
not use overlapping channels. Channel reuse is using nonoverlapping channels—for example 
1, 6, and 11 in the 2.4 GHz range—in such a way that the overlapping cells are on differ-
ent RF channels. Figure 4.10 shows a 2.4 GHz deployment utilizing proper channel reuse. 
Channel reuse may be accomplished by mapping out the access points on a floor plan and 
minimizing the chances that the RF cells propagated by the access points do not overlap on 
the same RF channels. This type of channel plan can be done manually or with site survey 
software applications. Site survey applications will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 9. 
In parts of the world where the regulatory agency allows WLAN use of channels 12, 13, 
and 14 in the 2.4 GHz ISM band it may be possible to utilize four channels (1, 5, 9, and 13) 
instead of the more common three non-overlapping channels of 1, 6, and 11.

Radio Frequency Range and Speed
How far and fast a RF signal travels depends on a variety of factors, including line of sight, 
RF interference, and the types of materials within the environment. This section discusses 
these factors.
Line of Sight in Wireless Networking
RF communication between devices in 802.11 wireless networking uses different types 
of line of sight. There are two types of line of sight to take into account when planning, 
designing, and installing wireless networks:
■
■
Visual line of sight
■
■
Direct link RF line of sight
Visual line of sight is when a transmitter and receiver can “see” each other. In order 
for wireless networking direct link communication to be successful in an outdoor wireless 
link, there should be a clear, unobstructed view between the transmitter and receiver. An 

Radio Frequency Range and Speed 
151  
unobstructed line of sight means few or no obstacles blocking the RF signal between these 
devices.
In an outdoor WLAN installation, direct link RF line of sight is an unobstructed line 
between a radio transmitter and receiver. This line will be surrounded by an area of RF 
transmissions known as the Fresnel zone. The Fresnel zone consists of a number of concen-
tric ellipsoidal volumes that surround the direct RF line of sight between two points, such 
as an RF transmitter and receiver or two wireless bridges.
In outdoor WLAN installations, the RF line of sight, and therefore the radio transmis-
sions between a transmitter and receiver, could be affected if the total area of the Fresnel 
zone is blocked by more than 40 percent. This blockage can come from a variety of sources, 
such as trees, buildings, terrain, or other obstacles, including the curvature of the earth 
over a distance of 7 miles (11.2 km) or greater. Figure 4.11 illustrates a Fresnel zone.
F i g u r e  4 .11     The oval area represents the Fresnel zone RF coverage area between a 
transmitter and receiver, two wireless bridges in a point-to-point connection.
One way to think about line of sight is by the analogy of two people looking at each 
other. If two people about the same height standing some distance apart are making direct 
eye contact, they have a good visual line of sight. In addition to being able to see directly in 
front of them, people have peripheral vision. This peripheral vision gives people the ability 
to see movement and objects outside of their direct line of sight or direct eye contact. This 
peripheral vision or side vision is analogous to the Fresnel zone theory. Exercise 4.1 pro-
vides a fun way to conceptualize a Fresnel zone on your own.
E x e r c i s e  4 .1
Demonstrating Fresnel Zone and Blockage
Here is one way to demonstrate the Fresnel zone. Focus your eyes at a location on a wall. 
Make sure there are obstacles or movement off to both left and right sides of your view. 
Hold your hands down to your sides. Continue to focus your eyes for a minute or so, and 
then take your right, left, or both hands and slowly raise them from your sides toward the 
side of your head while blocking your peripheral vision. You’ll notice as your hands get 
closer to the side of your head, the view of the objects or movement to the sides will be 
blocked by your hands. This is an example of a blocked Fresnel zone.

152 
Chapter 4 ■ Radio Frequency Fundamentals for Wireless Networking
 
 Sixty percent at a minimum of the total area of the Fresnel zone must be 
clear of obstacles in order to have RF line of sight. 
 Because of the low transmit and receive power and the short distance, a visual line of 
sight is not required for an indoor WLAN deployment. An indoor access point may cover 
areas that are divided by walls, ceilings, and other obstacles. With this short range and if 
the RF is able to penetrate the obstacles, wireless communication between a transmitter 
and a receiver will be successful even when the devices do not have a visual line of sight. 
 Wi-Fi and Non–Wi-Fi Interference 
 Interference, from a RF point of view, occurs when a receiver hears two different signals 
on the same or close frequency.  Interference causes received RF signals to be distorted. In 
WLANs, this interference can have a severe impact on the quality of signal received by a 
wireless device. This distorted or corrupted signal will decrease the amount of data a device 
can effectively receive, thereby causing less data throughput. 
 A WLAN receiver has similar characteristics to the human ear. Both can hear a range of 
frequencies. If one person is speaking and a number of people are listening, that is analo-
gous to a single transmitter and multiple receivers. If a second person started to speak at 
the exact same time, people listening might not be able to understand either speaker. In a 
sense, they are experiencing interference. 
 An IEEE 802.11 wireless network may use the unlicensed 2.4 GHz industrial, scientifi c, 
and medical (ISM) band. This band is also used for many other devices, including: 
 
■
 Cordless phones 
 
■
 Microwave ovens 
 
■
 Medical devices 
 
■
 Industrial devices 
 
■
 Baby monitors 
 
■
 Other IEEE 802.11 wireless networks 
 
■
 Some IEEE 802.15 devices 
 Because these devices also use RF to operate and the frequency is in the same unli-
censed band as IEEE 802.11 wireless networks, they have the potential to interfere with 
one another. Although they may coexist in the same RF space, the interference factor needs 
to be taken into consideration. This can be done as part of the site survey process. 
 Adjacent Channel and Co-channel Interference 
 Adjacent channel and co-channel interference occurs when two devices in the same physi-
cal area are tuned to close RF channels or the same channel. For example, an access point 
on channel 1 and another access point on channel 2 in close or hearing range of each other 

Wi-Fi and Non–Wi-Fi Interference 
153
will experience adjacent channel interference. Some of the symptoms of adjacent channel 
interference are reduced throughput and the equivalent of collisions causing data retrans-
missions. Co-channel interference is when two or more independently coordinated access 
point radios are providing RF coverage to the same physical area using the same 802.11 
channel such as Channel 1 and Channel 1. Another term used for co-channel interference 
is “co-channel cooperation,” since it is not really interference but rather an increase in the 
size of the contention domain. 
 
 Co-channel interference is defined as two different radio transmitters 
using the same frequency. The IEEE 802.11-2016 standard, however, 
defines interference between channels 1 and 2 as co-channel interference 
caused by overlapping channels. According to the standard, adjacent chan-
nel interference for HR/DSSS and ERP in the 2.4 GHz ISM band is caused 
by frequencies of greater than or equal to 25  MHz separation, such as 
channels 1 and 6. The terms  co-channel and  adjacent are used loosely in 
the WLAN industry. Please consult specific manufacturers’ documentation 
for their definition. The CWNP program complies with the IEEE standards 
definition. 
 Overlapping interference is defi ned as two devices (such as access points) on the same 
frequency overlapping one another. For example, two access points on the 2.4 GHz ISM 
band in close proximity to each other, one on channel 1 and the other on channel 3, might 
interfere with each other. 
 Both adjacent channel interference and co-channel channel interference will cause poor 
performance and throughput on a wireless network. In a wireless network, co-channel or 
adjacent channel interference can have the same impact. Figure  4.12 shows that 2.4 GHz 
ISM band channel 4 and channel 6 overlap.

 A properly designed WLAN will have overlapping RF cells. Overlapping cells provide 
continuous coverage and channel reuse for the entire area where the access points are placed. 

154 
Chapter 4  ■  Radio Frequency Fundamentals for Wireless Networking  
Overlapping cells allow devices to move from one access point to another and maintain a 
constant connection. A well-designed WLAN will also minimize or eliminate overlapping 
and co-channel interference. This design includes assigning nonoverlapping RF channels 
to cells that do overlap with each other. In practice, an overlapping cell design will include 
approximately a 20 percent overlap to encourage better transitioning for the connected 
devices. Wireless repeaters require a 50 percent overlap to be effective. The frequency in  
use is determined by how many nonoverlapping channels are available in the band. 
For example, in the United States, the 2.4 GHz band used for 802.11b/g/n has three 
­nonoverlapping channels: 1, 6, and 11. Figure 4.13 shows 2.4 GHz ISM band with these 
three nonoverlapping channels.

WLAN/WPAN Interference
The performance of IEEE 802.11 wireless networks can be affected when they are co-
located with IEEE 802.15 wireless personal area networks (WPANs). Bluetooth is an  
example of a WPAN. Like 802.11, Bluetooth devices operate in the 2.4 GHz frequency 
range and use frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) technology. This functionality 
in older Bluetooth devices could potentially interfere with IEEE 802.11 wireless networks. 
Newer versions of Bluetooth that use adaptive frequency hopping (AFH) have less chance  
of interfering with other wireless networks, including 802.11 wireless networks. AFH 
allows devices such as Bluetooth to adapt to the RF environment by seeking areas of  
interference and not operating in those specific frequency ranges. This will lessen the 
chances of 802.15 WPAN devices interfering with 802.11 WLAN devices. This newer 
technology is proven such that WLAN 802.11 and WPAN 802.15 Bluetooth devices may 
coexist in the same physical radio chipset. Keep in mind, however, that a high density of 
Bluetooth-enabled devices may still cause interference with IEEE 802.11 wireless networks 
in the 2.4 GHz ISM band.

 Environment: Radio Frequency Behavior 
 In addition to various types of RF interference, the interaction between RF and the sur-
rounding environment can also affect the performance of IEEE 802.11 wireless networks. 
RF behavior is the result of environmental conditions, including: 
 
■
 Reflection 
 
■
 Refraction 
 
■
 Diffraction 
 
■
 Scattering 
 
■
 Absorption 
 
■
 Diffusion 
 Reflection 
Refl ection occurs when an RF signal bounces off a smooth, nonabsorptive surface, such 
as a tabletop, and changes direction. Refl ections can affect indoor WLAN installations 
fairly signifi cantly in certain cases. Depending on the interior of the building—such as the 
type of walls, fl oors, or furnishings—there could be a large number of refl ected signals. If 
not properly handled, refl ections could cause a decrease in throughput and poor network 
performance in IEEE 802.11a/b/g (non-MIMO) wireless networks. Furnishings, metal 
beams, walls, ceilings, shelving, and roofi ng can all cause refl ections. Figure  4.14 illus-
trates refl ection.

 When it comes to reflection, think of a ping-pong game. When a ping-pong 
ball is served or hit, it comes in contact with the table—a smooth, hard 
 surface—and bounces off in a different direction. This is similar to how 
reflection works with radio frequency.

Chapter 4  ■  Radio Frequency Fundamentals for Wireless Networking  
Refraction
When an RF signal passes between mediums of different densities, it may change speeds 
and also bend. This behavior of RF is called refraction. Glass is an example of material that 
may cause refraction. When an RF signal comes in contact with an obstacle such as glass, 
the signal is refracted (bent) as it passes through, and some of the signal is lost. The amount 
of loss depends on the type of glass, its thickness, and other properties. Figure 4.15 shows 
refraction.

Diffraction
When an RF signal passes an obstacle, the wave changes direction by bending around the 
obstacle. This RF behavior is called diffraction. A building or other tall structure could 
cause diffraction, as could a column in a large open area or conference hall. When the 
signal bends around a column, building, or other obstacle, the signal weakens, resulting in 
some level of loss. Figure 4.16 illustrates diffraction.

Demonstrating Diffraction: A Rock in a Pond
You can demonstrate diffraction by using a pond of still water. Place a large object, such 
as a two-by-four piece of lumber, in a pond of still water. After the water settles, try to 
drop a pebble or small rock off to the side of the piece of lumber. Watch closely and you 
will see the ripple of the water bend around the lumber, resulting in a diffraction effect. 
It is easy to confuse the term diffraction with diffusion. Note that diffusion is the natural 
widening (spreading) of an RF signal as it leaves an antenna element. This is the premise 
of free space path loss (FSPL), which is discussed further in the “Diffusion” section.
Scattering
When an RF signal strikes an uneven surface, wavefronts of the signal will reflect off the 
uneven surface in several directions. This is known as scattering. Scattering, illustrated in 
Figure 4.17, is another form of loss that may severely degrade the RF signal. The differ-
ence between scattering and reflection is the surface with which the RF comes in contact. 
As with reflection, furnishings, metal beams, walls, ceilings, shelving, and roofing all can 
cause scattering.

Absorption
Absorption is the conversion of the RF signal energy into heat. This occurs because the 
molecules in the medium through which the RF signal is passing do not travel as fast as the 
RF waves, resulting in a loss of signal. There are many materials to consider with absorp-
tion, including brick, concrete, windows, doors, water, drywall, wood, and people. When 
material absorbs an RF signal, it may significantly affect the signal as it penetrates through 
the material. One example of absorption is the human body, which has a high liquid con-
tent and will absorb RF signals. This type of absorption can be a problem for wireless 
network deployments in certain environments. Absorption should be considered when 
designing a WLAN for densely populated areas such as stadiums, airports, and conference 
halls. Figure 4.18 shows absorption.

Diffusion
Diffusion occurs when the RF signal naturally widens as it leaves an antenna element. As 
a result of this widening effect, the transmitted RF signal will decrease in amplitude and 
be less powerful at any distance from the antenna. This is known as free space path loss 
(FSPL). FSPL is the greatest form of loss factor in a RF link. FSPL is calculated using fre-
quency and distance as variables and entered into a mathematical formula. The receiving 
antenna is only able to receive a small amount of the transmitted signal because of this 
widening effect of the diffused signal as it propagates through the air. Any signal that is not 
received by the intended device is considered loss.
Basic Units of Radio Frequency 
Measurement
If a person were given a dollar bill, they would be one dollar richer. If this person were 
given 100 cents, they would still be one dollar richer. From this example, we see 1 dollar 
= 100 cents, and 1 cent = 1/100th of a dollar. One dollar and 100 cents are the same net 
amount, but a cent and a dollar are different units of currency.
The same is true for RF measures of power. The basic unit of measure for RF is the watt 
(W). A wireless access point may be set to an output of 30  mW (milliwatts) of power. A 
milliwatt is 1/1000 of a watt. Just as in currency cents and dollars are both denominations 
of money, watts and milliwatts are measurements of RF power. Other units of measure-
ment for RF are dB, dBi, dBd, and dBm.
Absolute Measurements of Radio Frequency Power
The amount of power leaving a wireless access point is one example of an absolute mea-
sure of power. This is an actual power measurement, not a ratio or a relative value. In 
other words, this is a measurable amount of power and can be determined with the proper 

Basic Units of Radio Frequency Measurement 
159
instrument, such as a watt meter. A typical maximum amount of transmit output power 
from an access point is 100 mW. 
 The measure of AC power can be calculated using the following basic formula:
 P = E × I 
 Power (P) equals voltage (E) multiplied by current (I). 
 A simple example would be to calculate the power from 1 volt and 1 amp. Using the 
given variables, the formula is as follows:
 P = 1 volt × 1 amp 
 The answer would be power = 1 watt. 
 
 The formula P = E × I is shown here for reference only to demonstrate the 
calculation of RF power. You will not need to know this formula for any of 
the associated certification exams. 
 Watt 
 The  watt (W) is a basic unit of power measurement. It is an absolute value, which is a mea-
surable amount of power. Most indoor wireless networks function in the milliwatt range. 
Power level in watts is a common measurement in long distance point-to-point and point-
to-multipoint connections. 
 Milliwatt 
 One milliwatt (mW) is 1/1000 of a watt. This is a common value used in RF work and 
indoor IEEE 802.11 WLAN deployments. The output power of an access point typically 
ranges from 1  mW to 100 mW. Most enterprise-grade access points allow you to change 
the output power. Most SOHO-grade access points have a fi xed output power, typically 
about 30 mW. The milliwatt is also an absolute unit of power measurement. 
 Decibel Relative to a Milliwatt 
 dBm is the power level compared to 1 milliwatt. This is based on a logarithmic function. A 
good rule to remember is 0 dBm = 1 mW. This value is considered as absolute zero. Using 
a formula or basic RF calculation rules, you can easily convert any milliwatt value to deci-
bels: 100  mW = 20 dBm, for example. 
 The dBm is also an absolute unit of power measurement. A dB is an example of a change 
in power or relative measurement of power where dBm is measured power referenced to 
1 milliwatt or an absolute measure of power. The next section discusses relative measure-
ments of power. 
 
 Remember, absolute values are measurable values of power, such as watt, 
milliwatt, and decibel milliwatt. 

160 
Chapter 4  ■  Radio Frequency Fundamentals for Wireless Networking  
Relative Measurements of Radio Frequency Power
Changes in RF power are known as relative. dB and dBi are relative measurements of 
power. An example would be an RF amplifier. If the input power to an amplifier is 10  mW 
and the output power is 100 mW, the gain of the amplifier is 10 dB—a change in power.
If the input RF power to an antenna is 100  mW and the theoretical amount of RF out-
put power is 200 mW, the gain of the antenna is 3 dBi—a change in power. Both of these 
are examples of changes in power and are known as relative expressions of RF power.
Decibel
The decibel (dB) is a ratio of two different power levels caused by a change in power. 
Figure 4.19 shows how an amplifier will provide an increase or change in power.

Basic RF Math: The 3s and 10s Rule
This section is beyond the scope of the exam objectives and is for informational purposes 
only.
There is a simple way to perform any RF math calculation without having to use loga-
rithms and mathematical formulas. This method is known as the 3s and 10s Rule (or 
sometimes referred to as the 10s and 3s Rule). If you remember five basic steps, you can 
perform any RF math calculation. The five basic steps are as follows:
■
■
0 dBm = 1  mW (starting point)
■
■
Increase by 3 dBm and power in mW doubles or × 2
■
■
Decrease by 3 dBm and power in mW is cut in half or ÷ 2
■
■
Increase by 10 dBm and power in mW is multiplied by 10 or × 10
■
■
Decrease by 10 dBm and power in mW is divided by 10 or ÷ 10
Decibel Isotropic
Decibel isotropic (dBi) is the unit that represents the gain or increase in signal strength 
of an antenna. The term isotropic in the RF world means energy broadcast equally in all 

Basic Units of Radio Frequency Measurement

directions in a spherical fashion. An imaginary, perfect antenna is known as an  isotropic 
radiator . This is a theoretical concept and is used as a reference and in calculations. dBi 
will be discussed and used in more detail in Chapter  5 . Table  4.6 shows a summary of 
absolute and relative power measurements.

 Remember, relative values are changes in power from one value to another 
value. dB, dBi, and dBd measure relative power. 
 Decibel Dipole 
 The gain of some antennas may be measured in decibel dipole ( dBd ). This unit of measure-
ment refers to the antenna gain with respect to a reference dipole antenna. The gain of most 
antennas used in WLANs is measured in decibel isotropic (dBi); however, some manufac-
turers may reference the gain of an antenna in dBd. The following simple formula derives 
the dBi value from the dBd value:
 dBi = dBd + 2.14 
 This formula converts from dBi to dBd:
 dBd = dBi − 2.14 
 dbd vs. dbi 
 You are a procurement agent working for a manufacturing company. An engineer orders 
some antennas to be used in a WLAN deployment. The part number you received from 
the engineer on the bill of materials is for antennas that are currently out of stock at your 
normal supplier. The order has to be placed as soon as possible, but technical support for 
the vendor is gone for the day, and you are not able to get any assistance. 

162 
Chapter 4  ■  Radio Frequency Fundamentals for Wireless Networking  
You found what appears to be a reasonable alternative for the requested antennas. How-
ever, the gain of the antennas does not exactly match what the engineer documented on 
the bill of materials. The engineer requested omnidirectional antennas with a gain of 6 dBi. 
You found what appears to be a comparable alternate with a gain of 6 dBd. It will be neces-
sary for you to determine whether these antennas will work. Not quite understanding the 
difference, you do some research to determine the difference between dBd and dBi. After 
searching various websites, you find a formula to convert the two different units:
dBi = dBd + 2.14
Using your calculator, you enter the value from the specification sheet for the alternate 
antennas:
6 dBd + 2.14 = 8.14 dBi
Unfortunately, the antennas found will not be good alternates in this example. Back to the 
drawing board!
Radio Frequency Signal Measurements
It is important to understand the various signal measurements of RF used in WLAN tech-
nology. Using tools like a wireless adapter client utility or a spectrum analyzer will allow 
you to view different statistics that pertain to a wireless network. Some of these statistics are
■
■
Receiver sensitivity
■
■
RF noise
■
■
Received signal strength indicator (RSSI)
■
■
Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
Receiver Sensitivity
The basic definition of receiver sensitivity is the measurable amount of RF signal usable by 
a receiver. More complex modulation and coding types will require better signals and are 
directly related to which signaling rate will be used to transfer the data. This is also deter-
mined by how much RF noise is in the area of the radio receiver. Figure 4.20 shows a data 
sheet of a wireless access point that displays the minimum receiver sensitivity required to 
achieve a specific data rate.
It is important to note that data sheets from wireless equipment manufacturers show the 
minimum amount of receive signal to achieve the listed data rates. You can see in Figure 4.20 
that this specific access point requires a minimum of −75 dBm receiver sensitivity in order 
to get the data rate of 54 Mbps. Most industry best practices recommend a minimum of 
−65 dBm to −67 dBm in order to achieve the highest data rate and best possible perfor-
mance. There is a lack of industry standards for calculating the RSSI value. Manufacturers 

Basic Units of Radio Frequency Measurement

may derive the same or similar values but use different proprietary calculations to do so. 
Two devices from different manufacturers having equal distance from the transmitting 
device and subjected to the same interference sources may calculate different RSSI values. 
So, when conducting a physical site survey, if possible it is recommended to use the same 
type of wireless devices that will be deployed in the environment to sample RSSI and SNR 
values.

Radio Frequency Noise
Radio frequency noise is the term for RF signals from sources other than the transmit-
ter and receiver that are in communication. Here is an analogy to help explain. You and 
a guest are in a crowded open-space restaurant for dinner. There are many unrelated 
conversations occurring at the same time at the various tables throughout the restaurant. 
If you and your dinner guest momentarily paused in your conversation, you would hear 
these other conversations, as well as the noise from equipment, telephones, and tables 
that are being cleared. This would be the restaurant equivalent of RF noise, as shown in 
Figure 4.21.
In a WLAN environment, several RF devices may be operating in the same physical 
space as the wireless transmitter (access point) and receiver (client device). Depending on 
the level of this RF noise, it may be difficult for the transmitter and receiver to under-
stand each other because the signal level may be too close to the noise floor and the 
receiver will have a difficult time determining the difference between signal and the RF 
noise. In Figure 4.22, a screen capture from a spectrum analyzer utility shows a wireless 
basic service set on channel 161 in the 5 GHz UNII-3 band. Also shown is the RF noise 
floor of about −98 dBm.

Received Signal Strength Indicator
Received signal strength indicator (RSSI) is an arbitrary number assigned by the radio 
chipset or device manufacturer, and it will not be comparable between devices from differ-
ent manufacturers. As stated in the standard, the RSSI may be averaged over time using a 
vendor-specific smoothing function. The calculation of the RSSI value is done in a propri-
etary manner, and a wireless device from one manufacturer may indicate different signal 
strength than that indicated by another, even though they both are receiving the exact same 
signal and at the same actual amount of RF power. This value is a key determinant of how 
well the WLAN device will perform. How the device is used with the network will deter-
mine the required levels of signal for optimal connectivity. Most wireless client device man-
ufacturers allow their chipsets to access the higher data rates as long as they are getting a 
−70 dBm signal or stronger. Wireless VoIP manufacturers recommend deploying so that the 
client devices can receive a −67 dBm or better signal from the access point, a strength that 
is double the −70 dBm required for higher data rate use due to the need for better signaling 
in QoS communications.
Signal-to-Noise Ratio
The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is the difference between the amount of received signal  
and the noise floor. Looking back at the restaurant analogy, if you were to continue your  
conversation and the tables surrounding yours were all speaking at higher volumes, you  
might not be able to hear your dinner guest very well because of the amount of noise cre-
ated in the open area of your table. Looking at this from a WLAN perspective, if a client  
device records a received signal of −85 dBm and the noise floor is −95 dBm, the SNR will  
be 10 dB. This value is calculated by subtracting the received signal from the noise. In this  
case −85 dBm − (−95 dBm) = 10 dB. This would not be an adequate SNR, because the  
receiver would have a difficult time determining the difference between the wanted RF  
signal and the surrounding RF noise. On the other hand, if the received signal is −65 dBm 
and the noise floor is −95 dBm, then the SNR will be 30 dB. This value again is calculated 
by subtracting the received signal from the noise—in this case, −65 dBm − (−95 dBm) = 30 dB. 
This would be an excellent SNR because the receiver would easily be able to determine the 
intended RF signal from the surrounding RF noise. The SNR is a very important metric 
used with WLAN design. This value is used to determine the minimum received signal 
strength required for optimal performance of a WLAN system. Current best practices rec-
ommend a minimum SNR of 25 dB. Figure 4.23 illustrates the SNR as seen in a spectrum 
analyzer tool.

Summary
This chapter explored RF basics and the essential role RF plays in the world of IEEE 
802.11 wireless networking. You learned the definition of RF as it pertains to wireless net-
working and the basic characteristics or properties of RF, including:
■
■
Wavelength
■
■
Frequency
■
■
Amplitude
■
■
Phase
Then we described devices such as transmitters and receivers and how they communi-
cate. In WLAN technology, an example of a transmitter and receiver is an access point  
and client device. We also discussed the unlicensed RF bands and channels used in the  
2.4 GHz ISM and 5 GHz UNII ranges for WLAN communications, as well as other  
frequency ranges that may be allowed for use with IEEE 80211 wireless networking 
depending on the local regulatory agency. RF coverage and capacity are two important 
areas that should be considered closely to ensure that a wireless deployment will offer  
reliable connectivity and perform well for the user base.
We then explained correct channel reuse to minimize interference from the co-location 
of access points. This chapter explored the cause and effect of co-channel interference 
from sources other than wireless networks operating in the ISM and UNII bands. We also 
looked at RF behaviors such as reflection, refraction, and absorption, and the impact of

Antennas are an essential part of a successful wireless LAN 
(WLAN) deployment. From the transmitter perspective, an 
antenna takes the modulated RF energy from the transmis-
sion system, transforms it into radio waves, and propagates it through the free air. From 
the receiver perspective, an antenna performs the opposite task—it receives the modulated 
radio waves, transforms them back to AC signals, and, finally, sends the information to a 
computer or other wireless device.
Many factors are involved in determining the proper antenna to be used in an applica-
tion or deployment of a WLAN. These factors include

Basic Radio Frequency Antenna 
Concepts
It is important to understand some of the basic theory, characteristics, and terminology 
associated with antennas prior to learning how they operate. Becoming familiar with this 
will help in making decisions when it comes to sales and support of antennas and WLAN 
systems. Some of the terminology for characteristics of antennas is listed here:
■
■
Radio frequency lobes: Shape of the radiation patterns
■
■
Beamwidth: Horizontal and vertical angles

Radio Frequency Lobes
The term lobe has many meanings, depending on the context in which it is used. Typically, 
it is used to define the projecting part of an object. In anatomical terms, an example would 
be part of the human ear known as the ear lobe. In botanical terms, a lobe is the divided 
part of a leaf. As an RF antenna technology term, lobe refers to the shape of the RF energy 
emitted from an antenna element. RF lobes are determined by the physical design of the 
antenna. The antenna design also determines how the lobes project from an antenna 
element.
The effect of antenna design, particularly the shape of the RF lobes, is one reason why 
choosing the correct antenna is a critical part of a WLAN design. Antennas may project 
many lobes of RF signal, some of which are not intended to be usable areas of coverage. 
The RF lobes that are not part of the main or intended lobe coverage—that is, the rear and  
side lobes—contain usable RF but are not intended to be used to provide coverage for the WLAN 
cell. They are, for the most part, unintentional coverage areas and are not part of a good 
WLAN design and planned coverage area. The type of antenna utilized—omnidirectional, 
semidirectional, or highly directional—will determine the usable lobes. These antennas as 
well as the RF radiation patterns they project will be discussed in more detail later in this 
chapter. Figure 5.1 shows an example of RF lobes emitted from an antenna element. The 
“main signal” is the lobe intended to be used.

an antenna.

Antenna Beamwidth
The design of an antenna will determine how RFs propagate and the specific patterns 
in which the RF energy propagates from an antenna element. As mentioned earlier, 
the patterns of energy emitted from an antenna are known as lobes. For antennas, the 

174 
Chapter 5  ■  Antenna Technology for Wireless Networking  
beamwidth is the angle of measurement of the main RF lobe measured at what is called 
the half-power point, or − or power. This is where the RF power decreases by 50 percent. 
Antenna beamwidth is measured both horizontally and vertically, in degrees. It is 
important to understand that antennas shape the RF coverage or isotropic energy that 
radiates from the antenna element. Changing types or remaining with the same type 
of antenna but changing the gain will also change the coverage area provided by the 
WLAN system.
Documents or antenna specifications are available to illustrate the horizontal and vertical 
beamwidths. Azimuth and elevation charts available from the antenna manufacturer will 
show the beamwidth angles.
The azimuth refers to the horizontal RF coverage pattern, and the elevation is 
the vertical RF coverage pattern. The azimuth is the view from above, or the “bird’s-
eye view” of the RF pattern; in some cases it will be 360°. Think of the elevation as a 
side view. If you were to look at a mountain from the side view, it would have a certain 
height or elevation measured in feet or meters. For example, Pikes Peak, a mountain 
in the front range of the Rocky Mountains, has an elevation of 14,115′ (4,302 meters). 
Figure 5.2 shows a representation of horizontal and vertical beamwidths. Some predic-
tive modeling site survey software programs will allow the WLAN designer to adjust the 
azimuth and elevation of the antennas used in the predictive modeling design to more 
closely depict the real-world coverage of the WLAN system. WLAN site surveys and 
predictive modeling will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 9, “Design for Wireless 
Networking.”

Reading Azimuth and Elevation Charts
Understanding how to read an azimuth and elevation chart is useful from a technical 
sales, design, or integration perspective. Knowing these patterns will help when making 
hardware recommendations for customers based on needed coverage and device use. 
These charts show the angles of RF propagation from both the azimuth (horizontal or 
looking down, top view) and the elevation (vertical or side view). They give a general idea 
of the shape of the RF propagation lobe based on antenna design.
Antenna manufacturers test antenna designs in a laboratory. Using the correct instru-
ments, an engineer is able to create the azimuth and elevation charts. These charts show 
only approximate coverage area based on the readings taken during laboratory testing 
and do not take into consideration any environmental conditions such as obstacles or 
interference. The following image shows an example of an azimuth and elevation chart 
for a semidirectional antenna.

Understanding how to read one of these charts is not complicated. Notice that the chart 
is a circular pattern with readings from 0° to 360°, and there are many rings within these 
charts. The outermost ring shows the strongest signal from the testing process of this 
antenna. The inner rings show measurements and dB ratings less than the strongest 
measured signal from the outside ring. A good chart will show the most accurate read-
ings from the testing process. A sales or technical support professional can use these 
charts to get an idea of how the radiation pattern would look based on a specific antenna 
type and model.

Chapter 5  ■  Antenna Technology for Wireless Networking  
Antenna Gain
The gain of an antenna provides a change in a coverage pattern that is a result of the 
antenna focusing the area of RF propagation. This gain is produced from the physical 
design of the antenna element. In Chapter 4, “Radio Frequency Fundamentals for Wireless 
Networking,” we looked at various characteristics of RF. One of these characteristics is 
amplitude, which is defined as the height (voltage level) or the amount of power of a sine 
wave. The amplitude is created by varying voltage over a period of time and is measured 
at the peaks of the signal from top to bottom. Amplification of an RF signal will result 
in gain. An antenna is a device that can change the RF coverage area, thus propagat-
ing an RF signal further. Antenna gain is measured in decibels isotropic (dBi), which is a 
change in intensity as a result of increasing the isotropic energy. Isotropic energy is defined 
as energy emitted equally in all directions. The sun is a good example of isotropic energy, 
emitting energy in a spherical fashion equally in all directions. Figure 5.3 illustrates energy 
being emitted from an isotropic radiator.
F i g u r e  5 . 3    A perfect isotropic radiator emits energy equally in all directions.
Passive Gain
It’s quite intriguing how an antenna can provide passive gain, a change in coverage with-
out the use of an external power source. Because of their design, antennas focus isotropic 
energy into a specific radiation pattern. Focusing this energy increases coverage in a partic-
ular direction. A common example used to describe passive gain is a magnifying glass. If a 
person is standing outside on a beautiful sunny day, the sun’s energy is not intense because 
it is being diffused across the entire earth’s hemisphere. Thus, there is not enough concen-
trated energy to cause any harm or damage in a short period of time. If this person were 
to point one side of a magnifying glass toward the sun and the other side toward a piece of 
paper, however, more than likely the paper would start to heat quickly. This is because the 
convex shape of the magnifying glass focuses, or concentrates, the sun’s energy into one 
specific area, thus increasing the amount of heat to that area.

Basic Radio Frequency Antenna Concepts 
177
 Antennas are designed to function in the same way by focusing the energy they receive 
from a signal source into a specifi c RF radiation pattern. Depending on the design of the 
antenna element, as the gain of an antenna increases, both the horizontal and vertical 
radiation patterns (beamwidths) will decrease or create narrower beamwidths. Conversely, 
as the gain of an antenna decreases, the beamwidths will increase, making a larger radia-
tion pattern. One exception to this behavior is the omnidirectional antenna. This type of 
antenna has a horizontal beamwidth of 360°. When the gain is increased or decreased, the 
beamwidth will remain 360° but the size of this coverage area will increase or decrease 
depending on the change in the gain. Omnidirectional antennas are discussed in more 
detail later in this chapter. Figure  5.4 shows a drawing of a WLAN system with 25 mW 
(milliwatts) of RF power at the antenna. Because of passive gain, the antenna has the effect 
of emitting 250 mW of RF power.

 It is important to understand that many local RF regulatory domains or 
agencies restrict the amount of RF power that can be emitted from an 
unlicensed RF system. This “system” includes all the components certified 
by the local regulatory agency and may include the transmitter (access 
point), the connectors, and the antenna. Changing and increasing the gain 
of an antenna will increase the amount of effective RF energy leaving the 
antenna and may violate the regulations set forth by the local regulatory 
agency and void the certification. The Federal Communications Commis-
sion (FCC) has modified what it allows several times, to the point of much 
confusion for installers trying to remain compliant with the regulations. 
Additionally, altering the original design in any way may require the entire 
system to be recertified based on the regulations in each RF agency and 
that agency’s interpretation of the term licensed system. 

178 
Chapter 5  ■  Antenna Technology for Wireless Networking  
Exercise 5.1 provides a simple way to demonstrate passive gain.
E x e r c i s e  5 .1
Demonstrating Passive Gain
You can demonstrate passive gain by using a standard 8.5″ × 11.0″ piece of notebook 
paper or cardstock.
1.	
Roll a piece of paper into a cone or funnel shape.
2.	
Speak at your normal volume and notice the sound of your voice as it propagates 
through the air.
3.	
Hold the cone-shaped paper in front of your mouth.
4.	
Speak at the same volume.
5.	
Notice that the sound of your voice is louder. This occurs because the sound is now 
focused into a specific area or radiation pattern, and passive gain occurs.
Active Gain
Active gain will also provide an increase in signal strength. In a WLAN system, active gain 
is accomplished by providing an external power source to an installed device. An example 
of such a device is an amplifier. An amplifier is placed in series in the WLAN system and 
will increase the signal strength based on how much gain it provides.
If an amplifier is used in a WLAN system, certain regulatory domains require that the 
amplifier be certified as part of the system. It is best to carefully consider whether an ampli-
fier is necessary before using such a device in an IEEE 802.11 WLAN system. Using an 
amplifier may nullify the system’s certification and potentially exceed the allowed RF limit. 
Therefore, it is important to stay within the rules of the regulatory agency that governs the 
use of RF when adding amplifiers, changing antennas, or changing transmit power settings 
in any WLAN deployment.
Antenna Polarization
Antenna polarization describes how a wave is emitted from an antenna and the orientation 
of the electrical component or electric field of the waveform. To maximize RF signals, the 
transmitting and receiving antennas should be polarized in the same direction or as closely 
as possible. Antennas polarized the same way ensure the best possible RF signal.
If the polarization of the transmitter and receiver are different, the power of the RF sig-
nal will decrease depending how different the polarization is. Figure 5.5 shows an example 
of horizontal and vertical polarized antennas.

(Vertical Beam)
Vertically Polarized Antennas
(Horizontal Beam)
With the large number of WLAN devices available, it is a challenging task to accomplish 
the same polarization for all devices on the network. Performing a WLAN site survey will 
show signal strength based on several factors, including polarization of access point anten-
nas. This survey will help determine the received signal strength of the WLAN devices. Site 
surveys and antenna polarization are discussed in more detail in Chapter 9.
Antenna Polarization Example
It is fairly simple to demonstrate antenna polarization with a notebook computer or other 
WLAN device and either a wireless network adapter client utility or other third-party  
software that shows signal strength and/or signal-to-noise ratio. One such utility  
is Acrylic WiFi Home, a free Wi-Fi network scanning utility for various operating  
systems. You can download and install the program from the Acrylic WiFi website, at 
https://www.acrylicwifi.com/en/wlan-software/wlan-scanner-acrylic-wifi-free. 
Acrylic WiFi Home displays the received signal strength from the access points in the 
receiver area.
You can visualize polarization by performing the following steps. This experiment should 
be performed using a notebook computer or mobile device within close proximity to an 
access point.
1.	
Verify that you have a supported wireless network adapter.
2.	
Install and launch the Acrylic WiFi Home program or other utility that shows signal 
strength.

180 
Chapter 5  ■  Antenna Technology for Wireless Networking  
3.	
Monitor the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) value.
4.	
While monitoring the RSSI value, change the orientation of the notebook computer.
5.	
Notice the change in the RSSI value (either an increase or decrease) when the orien-
tation of the computer changes with respect to the access point.
This demonstrates how polarity can affect the received signal of a device.
Wireless LAN Antenna Types
The type of antenna that is best for a particular installation or application will depend 
on the desired RF coverage pattern. Making the correct choice is part of a good WLAN 
design. Using the wrong type of antenna can cause undesirable results, such as interference 
to neighboring systems, poor signal strength, or incorrect coverage pattern for your design.
The following are three common types of antennas for use with WLANs:
■
■
Omnidirectional/half wave dipole antennas
■
■
Semidirectional antennas
■
■
Highly directional antennas
This section describes each type of antenna in more detail and provides specifications 
and installation or configuration information about these antennas.
Omnidirectional Antennas
Omnidirectional antennas are common on most access points of either SOHO (Small Office 
Home Office) or enterprise grade. An omnidirectional antenna has a horizontal beamwidth 
(azimuth) of 360°. This means that when the antenna is vertically polarized (perpendicular 
to the earth’s surface), the horizontal radiation pattern is 360° and will propagate RF energy 
in every direction horizontally. The vertical beamwidth (elevation) will vary depending on 
the antenna’s gain. As the gain of the antenna increases, the horizontal radiation pattern will 
increase, providing more horizontal coverage. Keep in mind the beamwidth is still 360°, but 
it will be a larger 360° area that is covered because of the higher gain of the antenna. The 
vertical radiation pattern will decrease, however, thus providing less vertical coverage.
The shape of the radiation pattern from an omnidirectional antenna looks like a donut 
and is known as a torus. Figure 5.6 shows an example of the toroidal radiation pattern of 
an omnidirectional antenna.
Omnidirectional antennas are one of the most common types of antenna for indoor 
WLAN deployments. Most access points use omnidirectional antennas. Access points come 
with fixed, removable, or integrated antennas. If the antenna is removable, the installer can 
replace it with one of different gain. Enterprise-grade access points typically have remov-
able antennas that are sold separately.
Some regulatory domains require the use of proprietary connectors with respect to 
antennas. These connectors limit access points to the specific antennas tested with the 
system. Therefore, it is best to consult with the manufacturer of the access point or other 
WLAN transmitting device to determine which antennas may be used with the system.

Wireless LAN Antenna Types 
181  
F i g u r e  5 .6    The omnidirectional radiation pattern has a toroidal shape.
The most common type of omnidirectional antenna used indoors is known as the rub-
ber duck antenna. This type of antenna typically has a low gain of 2 dBi to 3 dBi and con-
nects directly to an access point. Rubber duck antennas usually have a pivot point so the 
polarization can be adjusted vertically or horizontally regardless of how the access point is 
mounted.
Some antennas will operate in both the 2.4 GHz ISM band and the 5 GHz UNII band 
and can thus work with a multiband wireless device.
Figure 5.7 shows a dual-band rubber duck omnidirectional antenna.

Semidirectional Antennas
Semidirectional antennas take RF power from the transmitting system and focus it into a 
more specific pattern than an omnidirectional antenna offers. Semidirectional antennas are 
available in various types, including patch, panel, sector, and Yagi. These antennas, manu-
factured for either indoor or outdoor use, are designed to provide more specific coverage 
by focusing the horizontal radiation pattern to a value of less than 360°. A semidirectional 
antenna will allow the WLAN designer to provide RF coverage to a specific area within a 
deployment. This coverage area may consist of rooms or areas in which an omnidirectional 
antenna might not be the perfect solution. For indoor installations, such areas include 
rectangular rooms or offices, hallways, and long corridors. For outdoor deployments, they 
include point-to-point and point-to-multipoint bridging installations.
Patch/Panel Antennas
In the WLAN world, the terms patch and panel are commonly used to describe the same 
type of antenna. The intended use will affect the choice of patch/panel antenna to be used 
in a specific application. Choosing the correct patch/panel antenna will require knowing the 
dimensions of the physical area to be covered as well as the amount of gain required. A patch/
panel antenna can have a horizontal beamwidth of as high as 180°, but usually the horizontal 
beamwidth is between 35° and 60°. The vertical beamwidth usually ranges between 30° and 
80°. Figure 5.10 shows a 2.4 GHz MIMO/802.11n flat panel antenna. Sector antennas are a 
type of semidirectional antenna that can be configured in an array to provide omnidirectional 
coverage. Sector antennas are covered in more detail later in this chapter.

Appropriate Use of a Semidirectional Antenna
A small business consultant is tasked with providing WLAN access to several offices in 
a multi-tenant building. The client wants to provide adequate coverage for the offices 
but would like to minimize the number of access points. The client wishes to use access 
points and antennas that are aesthetically pleasing, since these offices allow public 
access. The areas to be covered are rectangular, as shown here:
One solution would be to provide several access points using low-gain omnidirectional 
antennas. The following image illustrates how several access points could be used to pro-
vide coverage to this area.
The consultant believes, however, that if low-gain rubber duck omnidirectional antennas 
were used, an access point with significant output power would be required to cover the 
length of the rooms. In addition, the client wants to minimize the number of access points 
and make the installation aesthetically pleasing.
An alternate solution is to use a patch antenna on both sides of the office, thereby pro-
viding adequate coverage and minimizing the use of access points. The following image

coverage area of both antennas.
Patch/Panel Antenna Specifications
The specifications for semidirectional antennas such as patch or panel vary based on the 
design of the antenna. Semidirectional antennas are available in single- or dual-band capa-
bility. Semidirectional antennas may be used indoors or outdoors, depending on the appli-
cation. Table 5.2 is an example of a specification sheet for a 2.4 GHz flat patch antenna.

Sector Antennas
Sector antennas can be used to create omnidirectional radiation patterns using semidirec-
tional antennas. These antennas are often used for base station connectivity for point-to-
multipoint connectivity. Sector antennas have an azimuth that varies from 90° to 180°. 
These are typically configured to offer a total azimuth of 360°. For example, using sector 
antennas with an azimuth of 120° each would require three antennas in order to get omni-
directional or 360° coverage. This is a common configuration used with cellular phone 
technology. Figure 5.12 shows a sector panel antenna.

Sector Antenna Specifications
As mentioned earlier, sector antennas are commonly configured in an array to allow 
semidirectional antennas to provide omnidirectional coverage. This is useful in a campus 
environment or community arrangement to provide WLAN access such as Internet access. 
Sector antennas will usually have wide horizontal beamwidth (azimuth) and a narrow verti-
cal beamwidth (elevation). Table 5.3 is an example of a specification sheet for a dual-band

Yagi Antennas
Yagi antennas are designed to be used indoors in long hallways and corridors, or outdoors 
for short-range bridging (typically less than two miles). Yagi antennas have vertical and 
horizontal beamwidths ranging from 25° to 65°. The radiation pattern may look like a fun-
nel or a cone. As the signal propagates away from the antenna, the RF coverage naturally 
widens (diffuses). The aperture of the receiving antenna is much narrower than the signal 
at that point. This is a result of diffusion, which is the biggest form of loss in an RF link. 
Figure 5.14 shows a Yagi antenna.

Outdoor Installation of Yagi Antennas
A Yagi antenna may be in a weatherproof enclosure. This is not required but may be use-
ful in outdoor installations. The weatherproof enclosure will prevent collection of certain 
elements such as snow and ice. Radome covers are available for parabolic dish antennas 
for the same purpose.
Highly Directional Antennas
Highly directional antennas are typically parabolic dish antennas used for long-range 
point-to-point bridge connections. These antennas are available with a solid reflector or 
a grid. Some manufacturers of parabolic dish antennas advertise long ranges depending 
on the gain and the environmental conditions. Parabolic dish antennas have very narrow 
horizontal and vertical beamwidths. This beamwidth can range from 3° to 15° and has 
a radiation pattern similar to that of a Yagi, with the appearance of a funnel. The beam-
width starts very narrow at the antenna element and naturally widens because of diffu-
sion. Because these antennas are designed for outdoor use, they need to be manufactured 
to withstand certain environmental conditions, including a wind rating and appropriate 
mounting. Grid antennas can provide similar coverage and are less susceptible to wind 
loading. Figure 5.16 shows a parabolic dish antenna.

Shipping a Parabolic Dish Antenna
One thing to consider regarding the sale and procurement of a highly directional para-
bolic dish antenna is the size and shipping weight. Since these antennas are much larger 
and heavier than other antennas used in WLANs, shipping cost may be a factor. Some 
specification sheets will detail shipping information for this reason.
Radio Frequency Cables and Connectors
Radio frequency cables play a role in various WLAN deployment situations. For example, 
cables may be used to connect access points and client devices to antennas or to connect 
other devices that may be used in wireless networking. Several factors need to be taken into 
consideration when using cables in a WLAN system, including these:
■
■
Type of cable
■
■
Length of cable
■
■
Cost of cable
■
■
Impedance rating

196 
Chapter 5  ■  Antenna Technology for Wireless Networking  
Choosing the correct cable for use in WLAN systems is an important part of a success-
ful WLAN deployment. The right cable for the right job will help ensure that signal loss—a 
decrease in signal strength—is minimized and performance is maximized.
Radio Frequency Cable Types
The type of cable used will depend on the application. Many systems use cables to extend 
from the wireless device such as an access point to an antenna located outside of a building. 
It is important to choose the correct type of cable in order to optimize the performance of 
the WLAN system. Cables vary in diameter, and the application will determine the type 
of cable to use. For example, connecting a WLAN adapter on a notebook computer to an 
external antenna requires a specific type of cable that should be short and flexible. Thick, 
rigid cables are best used for longer runs.
The RF range in which the cable will be used also is important to consider. Where the 
cable is used will determine the RF rating of the cable. For example, WLANs use cable 
rated at 50 ohms, whereas television (such as satellite and cable) use cable rated at 75 ohms. 
Using cable with the correct rating will minimize voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR), a 
phenomenon discussed in the section “Impedance and VSWR.” Figure 5.18 shows a spool 
of high-quality 50 ohm cable.
F i g u r e  5 .18    L-com spool of low-loss 400-series coaxial bulk cable
Image provided by www.L-com.com.
Radio Frequency Cable Length
The length of a cable used in a WLAN system is another factor to consider. A cable of 
even a very short length will have some level of attenuation or loss. As a reminder, loss is a 
decrease in signal strength. This decrease in signal strength means less overall performance 
and throughput for users of the WLAN. Professionally manufactured cables typically are 

Radio Frequency Cables and Connectors 
197  
available in many standard common lengths. Best practices recommend using the correct 
length and minimizing connections. For example, if a run from an access point to an exter-
nal antenna is 27′, it would be best to use a single cable as close to that length as possible. 
Connecting two or more pieces of cable together will increase the loss to the system. One 
might be tempted to use a longer piece, such as 50′, but this is not recommended since the 
extra length will add loss to the system.
Figure 5.19 shows a short length of cable, known as a pigtail, used to connect a stan-
dard cable to a proprietary cable. If an RF cable is used or extended, the attenuation that 
is introduced can be offset with the use of an amplifier or with a higher-gain antenna. An 
amplifier will provide active gain, and an antenna will provide passive gain. Keep in mind 
that using an incorrect amplifier may void the system certification and that using a higher-
gain antenna may exceed the rules set by the local RF regulatory agency.
F i g u r e  5 .19    Short pigtail adapter cable

Radio Frequency Cable Cost
Cable cost may also play a role in the type of cable to be used. The old saying “you get 
what you pay for” is true with cables as well. I recommend using high-quality name-brand 
RF cables to optimize the performance of your system. Premium cables may come at a 
higher price, but the benefit of better quality signal is the main advantage.
Impedance and VSWR
Impedance is the measurement of alternating current (AC) resistance. It is normal to have 
some level of impedance mismatch in a WLAN system, but the impedances of all com-
ponents should be matched as closely as possible in order to optimize performance of the 
system. Impedance mismatches can result in what is called voltage standing wave ratio 
(VSWR). A large impedance mismatch can cause higher than desired levels of VSWR and 
will have an impact on the WLAN system and transmitted or received signal.
Electrical resistance is measured in ohms. IEEE 802.11 WLAN devices have an imped-
ance of 50 ohms. This includes antennas, cables, connectors, and other accessories.

198 
Chapter 5  ■  Antenna Technology for Wireless Networking  
Radio Frequency Connectors
In a WLAN system, RF connectors are used to join devices together, allowing the RF sig-
nal to transfer between the devices. These devices may connect access point to antenna, 
antenna to cable, cable to cable, or various other components to each other. RF connectors 
also cause an impedance mismatch to some degree and increase the level of VSWR. To 
minimize the effects of VSWR, best practices suggest keeping the use of connectors to a 
minimum. Using connectors can also result in insertion loss. Insertion loss is usually minor 
by itself, but it can contribute to overall loss in a system, thereby resulting in less RF signal 
and less throughput.
Using Proprietary Connectors for Regulatory Domain Compliance
Some regulatory domains require the use of proprietary connectors on antennas and 
antenna connections in WLAN systems. These proprietary connectors prevent an 
installer or integrator from unintentionally using an antenna that might exceed the maxi-
mum amount of power allowed for the transmission system. Although these connectors 
are considered proprietary, many manufacturers share proprietary connectors.
Standard RF connectors may be used in WLAN systems to connect devices that are not 
part of the point connecting to the antenna. For example, an access point connecting to a 
length of cable that is then connected to an amplifier could use a standard RF connector. 
The cable connecting the amplifier to the antenna would require a proprietary connector. 
Figure 5.20 shows examples of common RF connectors.

Factors in Antenna Installation 
199  
Factors in Antenna Installation
Several factors are important to consider when you are planning to install an antenna in a 
WLAN environment. These include earth curvature, multipath, and RF line of sight. This 
section includes information about how to take these factors into account when planning a 
wireless installation.
Addressing the Effects of Earth Curvature
Beyond seven miles (11.2 km), the curvature of the earth will have an impact on point-to-
point or point-to-multipoint WLAN connections. Therefore, it is important to add height 
to the antenna in order to compensate for the earth curvature, sometimes referred to as 
earth bulge. A formula is used to calculate the additional height of antennas when a link 
exceeds seven miles. However, this is beyond the scope of the exam objectives and is not 
discussed in this book.
Antenna Placement
The installation location and placement of antennas depend on the type of antenna and 
application in which it will be used. When installing antennas, consider both the placement 
based on the design of the WLAN and the intended use of the antenna. When antennas 
are used outdoors, lightning arrestors, grounding, and adherence to local codes, laws, and 
government regulations must be followed, as well as good RF design. Increasingly, local 
ordinances dictate how or if outdoor antennas can be mounted for looks as well as safety. 
Lightning arrestors and grounding methods are discussed later in this section.
Omnidirectional Antenna Placement
Placement of an omnidirectional antenna will depend on the intended use. Some omnidirec-
tional antennas can be connected directly to an access point or may be integrated within the 
access point. The installation is fairly straightforward; it involves simply attaching the antenna 
to the access point or using the integrated antenna. Omnidirectional antennas are usually 
placed in the center of the intended coverage area. High-gain omnidirectional antennas are 
typically used in outdoor installations for point-to-multipoint configurations. This configura-
tion is more complex because more than likely it requires mast or tower mounting. The exact 
placement depends on the intended coverage area as well as the gain of the antenna.
Semidirectional Antenna Placement
Semidirectional antennas may be used for either outdoor or indoor installations. When 
mounted indoors, a patch/panel antenna typically will be mounted flat on a wall, with 
the connector upward for connections to a cable or directly to an access point. A template 
with the mounting hole placement may be included for ease of installation. These antennas 

200 
Chapter 5  ■  Antenna Technology for Wireless Networking  
usually will use four mounting holes (one in each corner) to fasten the antenna to the wall 
securely. Yagi antennas can also be mounted either indoors or outdoors. The most common 
installation is outdoors for short-range point-to-point or point-to-multipoint bridging solu-
tions. This will require a mounting bracket such as a tilt and swivel for wall mounting or 
U-bolts and plate for mast or pole mounting.
Highly Directional Antenna Placement
Highly directional antennas such as a parabolic dish are almost always used exclusively in 
outdoor installations. This type of antenna is used mostly for long-range point-to-point bridg-
ing links and will require installation on building rooftops or antenna towers. Alignment 
for long-range links is critical for reliable communications. Software and hardware tools are 
available for the installer to use for accurate alignment. As with other outdoor installations, 
secure mounting is essential in order to maintain safety and link reliability.
Minimizing the Effects of Multipath 
Using Antenna Diversity
In Chapter 4, we discussed some of the behaviors of RF, including reflection, refraction, 
scattering, and diffraction. To review, reflection is caused by an RF signal bouncing off a 
smooth, nonabsorptive surface and changing direction. Indoor environments are areas that 
are prone to reflections. Reflections are caused by the RF signal bouncing off walls, ceil-
ings, floors, and furniture; thus, some installations will suffer from reflection more than 
others. The effect of reflection will be a decrease in signal strength due to a phenomenon 
called multipath. Multipath is the result of several wavefronts of the same transmission 
signal received out of phase at slightly different times. This can cause the receiver to be con-
fused about the received signals. The result is corrupted signal and less overall throughput. 
Figure 5.21 illustrates multipath.

 Think of multipath as an echo. If you were to stand near a canyon and 
speak to somebody at a high volume some distance away, the other per-
son would notice an echo. This echo is due to the fact that the sound of 
your voice is reflecting off the canyon walls. Therefore, the other person is 
hearing variations of your voice at slightly different times—as with RF mul-
tipath, several wavefronts of the same signal are arriving out of phase. 
 Antenna diversity is one way to help reduce the effects of multipath.  Antenna diversity 
is a technology used in IEEE 802.11a/b/g WLANs; a station (access point or client device) 
will utilize two antennas combined with one radio to decrease the effects of multipath. 
Using multiple antennas and some additional electronic intelligence, the receiver will be 
able to determine which antenna will receive and send the best signal. In diversity systems, 
two antennas are spaced at least one wavelength apart. This allows the receiver to use 
the antenna with the best signal to transmit and receive. With respect to RF diversity, the 
antennas are required to be of the same design, frequency, gain, and so on. Newer IEEE 
802.11 technologies (802.11n and 802.11ac, for example) are capable of high throughput 
(HT) multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO), which uses radio chains to transmit and 
receive radio signals. IEEE 802.11a/b/g devices used a single radio to transmit and receive 
radio signals, which is known as  single-input, single-output (SISO) technology. SISO sys-
tems are subject to multipath. This is a problem for IEEE 802.11a/b/g systems, whereas 
MIMO actually uses the refl ections (multipath) to help enhance the performance and 
throughput using several radio chains and additional electronics in newer WLAN technol-
ogy. You can read more about MIMO in Chapter  2 , “Wireless Local Area Networking, 
Standards, and Certifi cations,” in the section “The IEEE 802.11n Amendment.” 
 diversity Antenna orientation 
 When you are using a diversity system such as an access point, it is important to have 
both antennas oriented the same way. They cannot be used to cover different areas. 
Using diversity antennas in an attempt to provide coverage for different areas will defeat 
the purpose of the diversity design. 
 Combating Effects of Wind and 
Lightning in Wireless LAN Installations 
 Weather conditions such as rain, snow, and sleet typically do not affect WLAN commu-
nications unless the conditions are extreme or snow and sleet collect on antenna elements. 
However, some weather conditions that can affect wireless communication are wind and 
lightning.

Chapter 5  ■  Antenna Technology for Wireless Networking  
Most outdoor antennas that can be affected by wind will have wind-loading data in the 
specification sheet. Wind loading is the result of wind blowing at high speeds and causing 
the antenna to move.
Lightning can destroy components connected to a network if the antenna takes either a 
direct or an indirect lightning strike. A properly grounded lightning arrestor will help pro-
tect WLAN and other networking equipment from indirect lightning strikes.
Lightning Arrestors
Transient or induced electrical currents are the result of an indirect lightning strike in the 
area of a WLAN antenna system. Lightning arrestors are an in-series device installed after 
the antenna and prior to the transmitter/receiver. Although this device will not provide 
protection from a direct lightning strike, it will help protect against an indirect lightning 
strike, which can damage electronics at distances away from the source of the strike. 
When the induced electrical currents from a lightning strike travel to the antenna, a light-
ning arrestor shunts this excess current to ground, protecting the system from damage. 
Figure 5.22 shows a lightning arrestor.

Antenna Mounting 
203
 Grounding Rods 
 A  grounding rod is a metal shaft used for grounding a device, such as an antenna used in 
wireless networking. The rod should be driven into the ground at least 8′ deep. Grounding 
rods are available in various types of steel, including stainless, galvanized, and copper clad. 
They are also available in a variety of diameters and lengths. Depending on the local elec-
trical code, the grounding system should measure resistance between 5 and 25 ohms. Local 
code should also be consulted regarding material, diameter, and length of grounding rods. 
You should not share grounding rods with other equipment because interference or damage 
may occur. 
 
 It is imperative to install a grounding rod properly to ensure correct opera-
tion. If installing a grounding rod and other lightning protection equipment 
is beyond the knowledge level of the wireless engineer or installer, it is 
best to have a professional contractor perform the job. 
 Installation Safety 
 Professional contractors should be considered in the event you are not comfortable with 
performing the installation of a WLAN antenna yourself. Installing antennas may require 
bonded or certifi ed technicians. Be sure to check local building codes prior to perform-
ing any installation of a WLAN antenna. Never underestimate safety when installing or 
mounting antennas. All safety precautions must be adhered to while performing an instal-
lation. The following are some general guidelines and precautions to be considered for a 
WLAN antenna installation: 
 
■
 Read the installation manual from the manufacturer. 
 
■
 Always avoid power lines. Contact with power lines can result in death. 
 
■
 Always use the correct safety equipment when working at heights. 
 
■
 Correctly install and use grounding rods when appropriate. 
 
■
 Comply with regulations for use in the area and for the use of towers. 
 Antenna Mounting 
 In addition to choosing the correct antenna to be used with a WLAN system, you must 
take into account the antenna mounting. The required antenna mounting fi xture will 
depend on the antenna type, whether it will be used indoors or outdoors, and whether it 
will be used for device/client access or bridging solutions such as point-to-point or point-to-
multipoint. It is best to consult with the antenna or device manufacturer to determine 

204 
Chapter 5 ■ Antenna Technology for Wireless Networking
which mounting fi xture is appropriate for use based on the intended deployment scenario. 
The following are several mounting types that may be used for a WLAN antenna solution: 
 
■
 Internal and external (to the access point) antennas 
 
■
 Pole/mast mount 
 
■
 Ceiling mount 
 
■
 Wall mount 
 Internal and External (to the Access Point) Antennas 
 Some wireless access points allow the use of either integrated or external antennas. Most 
modern controller-managed and cloud-managed access points provide integrated antennas, 
and some have connectors to allow for the use of external antennas. Integrated antennas 
may be a better solution, mostly to match the aesthetics requirements of the organization 
where the access point will be used. Integrated antennas make an access point less notice-
able if it is hanging from a standard 8′−10′ high ceiling. Integrating them will also prevent 
individuals from tampering with antennas that if external might be within a person’s reach. 
Tampering could be an issue in areas that are accessible to the general public, such as 
installations in educational, library, and medical environments. 
 It is important to take the mounting orientation into consideration when using access 
points with integrated antennas. The access point may be designed to be mounted on a 
ceiling. If you were to mount this type of access point on a wall, the radiation patterns 
would change, and this might create a coverage problem, especially with omnidirectional 
antennas. 
 One disadvantage of access points with integrated antennas is that the antennas cannot 
be changed to any other type. Basically you would be committed to using the antennas that 
are part of the access point and would be unable to add an antenna with higher gain or a 
different radiation pattern. Access points that have external antenna connectors allow the 
user to add different antennas that may be better suited to the environment or installation 
location. The external antennas will allow for a higher gain and possibly a different radia-
tion pattern. Using an external antenna usually requires a software confi guration that will 
disable the integrated antenna when external antennas are installed. You should not be able 
to use both the integrated and external antennas simultaneously. Many indoor access point 
models that use internal antennas offer the same coverage as their external antenna model 
counterparts This, however, will vary based on the manufacturer. 
 
 When using wireless access points with integrated antennas, it is impor-
tant to take the mounting into consideration. Some access points of this 
style are intended to be mounted on a ceiling or a wall, possibly both. 
Mounting an antenna in a way it is not designed for will produce undesir-
able results, including RF coverage problems.

Pole/Mast Mount
Pole/mast mounts typically consist of a mounting bracket and U-bolt mounting hardware. 
The mounting bracket is commonly L-shaped. One side of the bracket has a hole to mount 
an omnidirectional or similar antenna. The other side of the bracket has predrilled holes 
for fastening the bracket to a pole using U-bolts. Figure 5.23 shows an example of a mast 
mount bracket.

Exercise 5.2 describes the basic steps for installing an omnidirectional antenna using a 
mast mount adapter.
E x e r c i s e 5 . 2
Installing a Pole/Mast Mount
1.	
Attach the mounting bracket to the mast using the supplied hardware.
2.	
Remove the antenna mounting bolt and washer from the base of the antenna.
3.	
Insert the antenna into the hole in the top of the mounting bracket. Without overtight-
ening, securely fasten the antenna to the mounting bracket using the washer and 
antenna mounting bolt.
4.	
For outdoor installations, remember to use the proper sealant for weatherproofing 
when connecting the cable to the antenna.

Chapter 5  ■  Antenna Technology for Wireless Networking  
Ceiling Mount
It may be necessary to mount certain antennas or access points with attached or inte-
grated antennas from a ceiling. Many antennas can be mounted directly to a hard ceiling 
made from concrete, drywall, or similar material. Another possibility is a drop ceiling 
with acoustic tiles. Regardless of the type of ceiling in question, follow the manufacturer’s 
instructions on the appropriate fixture to be used for mounting and detailed instructions 
for ceiling mounts. Figure 5.24 shows an example of a ceiling mount antenna.

Wall Mount
Antennas or access points with attached antennas may need to be mounted to a wall based 
on the use or site survey results. Just as with a ceiling mount, follow the manufacturer’s 
instructions on the appropriate fixture for wall mounting. When mounting an antenna 
to the wall, consider the polarization of the antenna. Keep in mind that some antennas 
are designed to be mounted on the ceiling; these types should not be mounted on a wall. 
This is especially true for access points with integrated antennas. It is best to try to match 
the polarization of the access points and the wireless client devices. In other words, if the 
access point’s antennas are vertically polarized, the wireless client devices should be polar-
ized in the same manner to promote better connectivity. With the wide variety of newer 
wireless client devices available, however, this is getting harder to achieve. Choosing the 
correct antenna and mounting position is typically part of a WLAN site survey. Site surveys 
will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 9.
Maintaining Clear Communications
Several factors affect whether two wireless devices can communicate with each other. 
These factors include line of sight (both visual and RF) and Fresnel zone. Indoor WLAN 
installations use a low amount of RF transmit power, usually around 30 mW to 50 mW, 

Maintaining Clear Communications 
207  
and will be able to communicate effectively even if the client device does not have a line of 
sight with an access point. This is because the RF will be able to penetrate obstacles such as 
walls, windows, and doors. Outdoor installations usually use a much higher output trans-
mit power and will require an RF line of sight for effective communication.
Visual Line of Sight
Visual line of sight (LoS) is defined as the capability of two points to have an unobstructed 
view of one another. A visual LoS is usually not necessary for communications using indoor 
IEEE 802.11 WLAN systems; it is implied with RF LoS. If a WLAN engineer were plan-
ning to connect two buildings together using WLAN technology, one of the first things the 
engineer would do is to verify that there is a clear, unobstructed view between the planned 
locations in order to provide an RF LoS.
Radio Frequency LoS
For two devices to communicate successfully at a distance via RF, including a point-to-
point or point-to-multipoint connection, a clear path for the RF energy to travel between 
the two points is necessary. This clear path is called RF LoS. This RF LoS is the premise  
of the Fresnel zone.
Fresnel Zone
The Fresnel zone for an RF signal is the area of RF coverage surrounding the visual  
LoS. The width or area of the Fresnel zone will depend on the specific RF used as well as 
the length or distance of the signal path. There is a formula used to calculate the width  
of the Fresnel zone at the widest point; however, that is beyond the scope of the exam 
objectives and is not shown in this book.
In an outdoor point-to-point or point-to-multipoint installation, it is important 
for the Fresnel zone to be clear of obstructions for successful communications to take 
place between a RF transmitter and receiver. Best practices recommend maintaining an 
obstruction-free clearance of the least 60 percent for the Fresnel zone in order to have 
acceptable RF LoS. Maintaining a clear RF LoS becomes more difficult as the distance 
between two points increases. Obstructions can cause the Fresnel zone to be blocked 
enough for communications to suffer between a transmitter and receiver. Such obstruc-
tions include
■
■
Trees
■
■
Buildings or other structures
■
■
Earth curvature
■
■
Natural elements such as hills and mountains

Fresnel Zone
In order for your antennas to stay clear of obstructions, carefully plan their placement 
and height. Keep in mind that a WLAN link may cross public areas in which an integrator 
or installer will have no control over the environment. There is a possibility, depending on 
the environmental conditions, that an IEEE 802.11 WLAN link may not be a feasible solu-
tion due to the inability to maintain an RF LoS. You should perform an outdoor site survey 
prior to the procurement and installation of WLAN hardware to ensure the installation 
and operation of the WLAN will be successful.
Summary
Antennas are a critical component in a successful operation of a WLAN. In this chapter, 
you learned about RF signal characteristics and basic RF antenna concepts, including the 
following:
■
■
RF lobes
■
■
Beamwidth (horizontal and vertical measurements)
■
■
Passive and active gain
■
■
Horizontal and vertical polarization of antennas
By understanding these characteristics and concepts, a sales engineer, integrator, or 
other WLAN professional can help choose the best antenna to be used for a specific use.

Exam Essentials 
209  
Understanding the RF propagation patterns of various antenna types as well as the rec-
ommended use of an antenna will assist in deciding which antenna is best suited for the 
desired application. As discussed in this chapter, antennas are available in various types:
■
■
Omnidirectional
■
■
Semidirectional
■
■
Patch/panel
■
■
Sector
■
■
Yagi
■
■
Highly directional
■
■
Parabolic dish
Omnidirectional antennas are one of the most common types of antenna used for indoor 
applications of wireless networking. Omnidirectional antennas provide a horizontal radia-
tion pattern of 360°. Other antennas, such as patch/panel, Yagi, or parabolic dish, can be 
used if justified by the intended use. You learned about the radiation patterns of each of 
these types of antennas as well as how each may be used.
A proper mounting fixture is required to ensure safety and correct operation of the 
antenna and wireless network. This chapter looked at various methods for mounting 
antennas, including integrated and external (to the access point), pole/mast mount, ceiling 
mount, and wall mount.
Finally, you learned about the following other factors to be considered when choosing 
and installing an antenna for use with WLANs:
■
■
Visual line of sight
■
■
RF line of sight
■
■
Fresnel zone
Understanding these concepts will help you achieve more successful deployment, opera-
tion, and use of antennas in WLANs.

This chapter will look at terminology and basic communica-
tion used in 802.11 wireless networking. IEEE 802.11 wireless 
LANs (WLANs) can be configured in one of two operation 
methods: ad hoc or infrastructure mode. We will discuss both of these methods, as well as 
how the technology is applied and its advantages and disadvantages. In addition, we will 
examine some of the technical aspects, such as naming the WLAN and identifying the 
devices through Layer 2 MAC addressing or logical names. You will also learn about the 
methodologies a WLAN device or client station uses to locate and connect to the wireless 
network. (These include passive and active scanning as well as the authentication and  
association processes.)
It is important to know how IEEE 802.11 WLAN infrastructure devices such as access 
points are connected using a common distribution system. This distribution system allows 
access points to communicate with each other and enables the associated and connected 
WLAN devices to roam or move between access points and maintain consistent connectiv-
ity across the WLAN.
Other WLAN technology factors are important to understand when studying IEEE 
802.11 wireless networking. This chapter will discuss the differences between data rates, 
modulation, coding schemes, and throughput. A sales or technical support specialist should 
be able to understand and explain why, for example, an IEEE 802.11ac access point adver-
tises a maximum aggregate signaling rate of up to 6,933.3 Mbps (6.93 Gbps), but in many 
cases the data transfers are much less than the advertised rate.
Finally, we will look in depth at IEEE 802.11 protection mechanisms and explain why they 
are needed for backward compatibility and the effect they may have on the data transfer rate.
Some of the topics you will see in this chapter have been briefly touched on in earlier 
chapters. One of the objectives of this chapter is to tie the terminology and topics together. 
It can be somewhat challenging to cover certain parts of the WLAN technology without 
touching lightly on some other topics. This chapter will tie some of the loose ends together 
and help you to better understand how IEEE 802.11 wireless networks operate.
Wireless LAN Operation Methods
WLANs can be configured to operate in different modes for device and user access. Two 
common modes for access are ad hoc mode and infrastructure mode. These two modes can 
be broken down into the following three different configuration sets:
■
■
Independent basic service set (IBSS)
■
■
Basic service set (BSS)
■
■
Extended service set (ESS)

Wireless LAN Operation Methods 
217  
Each of these configurations will be discussed in more detail in this chapter. The appli-
cation/deployment scenario for a WLAN is the determining factor for the best mode to use. 
The IBSS configuration does not require the use of an access point and, unless specifically 
justified, is not commonly used in enterprise WLAN deployments. In addition, if not prop-
erly implemented, the IBSS can introduce security vulnerabilities, such as potentially bridg-
ing the wired network infrastructure to an unsecured wireless network. The most common 
configuration for an IEEE 802.11 WLAN is infrastructure mode, which uses at least one 
access point. Infrastructure mode requires a minimum of one access point but can consist 
of up to thousands of access points. The access points are connected by a common medium 
known as the distribution system (DS). We will look at each of these modes and the details 
of how they are configured.
The Independent Basic Service Set
It is important to understand what the independent basic service set (IBSS) is, how it works, 
and its potential uses, advantages, and disadvantages. An IBSS network is also known as 
an ad hoc or peer-to-peer network. This WLAN operation mode uses no access points and 
consists of only wireless devices or client computers. Communication occurs only among 
devices that are part of the same IBSS. Unlike an access point, this mode has no centralized 
control or manageable security or accounting features. Figure 6.1 shows devices in an IBSS.
F i g u r e  6 .1    Example of an independent basic service set (IBSS)

Certain parameters must be set on the devices that wish to participate in an IBSS. These 
parameters must be the same on all the devices in order for them to effectively commu-
nicate with one another. The following are three common parameters set on devices that 
belong to the same IBSS:
■
■
Service set identifier (SSID)
■
■
Radio frequency (RF) channel
■
■
Security configuration

218 
Chapter 6  ■  Communication for Wireless Networking  
The Service Set Identifier
The service set identifier (SSID) is a common parameter used in all WLAN operation 
configurations. Although it is discussed here, it also pertains to the other configurations 
discussed later in this chapter, such as the basic service set (BSS) and extended service set 
(ESS). The SSID is the logical name of the service set used to identify the wireless network. 
The SSID is used by devices to select a wireless network to join. This is accomplished 
through processes that are known collectively as the discovery phase and include passive 
and active scanning, both of which will be discussed later in this chapter.
In some cases, naming a wireless network can be a tough decision. Organizations that 
deploy a wireless network may already have a naming convention in place for such scenar-
ios. If not, a decision will need to be made regarding the wireless network names (SSIDs) 
used for access points and other devices to identify the WLAN.
Every device that wishes to be part of the same WLAN IBSS, BSS, or ESS will use a 
common network name, the SSID. (See Figure 6.2 for an IBSS example.) For infrastructure 
devices such as access points, the SSID parameter is manually set on the access point. From 
the client access side, the SSID is a user-configurable parameter that can be set manually  
in the wireless client software utility or received automatically from networks that broadcast 
this information element.

The SSID name should be unique and should not divulge who you are or the location of the 
WLAN devices, unless you are trying to create a wireless hotspot or a public accessible IEEE 
802.11 wireless network. For example, if a fictitious bank by the name of ABC Bank used an 
SSID that included ABC_Bank, it would tell an intruder where the wireless network is and 
could be a potential security threat because a financial institution is a target. It is important 
to understand if the proper WLAN security is enabled, the SSID name should not be an issue, 
but there is no point in broadcasting certain types of information. Rather than using the bank 
name in the SSID, consider a unique name that does not describe the business or location.
The SSID is case sensitive, must consist of at least one ASCII character, and has a maxi-
mum limit of 32 characters or, as specified in the IEEE 802.11 standard, 32 octets.

Wireless LAN Operation Methods 
219  
SSID Hiding
Most manufacturers of small office, home office (SOHO) and enterprise-grade access 
points allow the SSID to be hidden from view for devices attempting to locate a wireless 
network. In this case, a client device would need to know and specify the SSID in the client 
utility profile in order to connect to the network. Even though this is not an effective way 
to secure a wireless network and should not be used to do so, it is a practice some choose 
to use for various reasons. Some disadvantages to not broadcasting the SSID are that 
it may cause an increase in roaming times in an enterprise deployment, and in a SOHO 
deployment cause neighbors to deploy on the same channel that you are using because 
they are unable to see your network. SSID hiding (also known as a closed network) will be 
discussed in more detail in Chapter 8, “Security Fundamentals for Wireless Networking.”

Chapter 6 ■ Communication for Wireless Networking
 
 Microsoft Windows operating systems after version 8.1 no longer allow for 
an ad hoc network to be created from the graphical user interface. How-
ever, there are some command-line settings that can be used to allow 
wireless ad hoc connections from other devices. 
 The Radio Frequency Channel 
 The IBSS wireless network confi guration requires a user to set the specifi c RF channel that 
will be used by all devices that are part of the same IBSS network. This is accomplished 
in the client utility software for the network adapter. Some client software utilities set this 
automatically, in which case the IBSS will use the channel automatically specifi ed. You may 
also be able to specify the RF channel in the advanced properties of the wireless network 
adapter device driver properties. 
 It is important to understand that all wireless devices in any common IBSS must be 
communicating on the same RF channel. If the client utility does allow a channel to be set, 
the channel chosen is up to the user but based on the local regulatory domain in which the 
network is used. Additional devices wishing to join the IBSS must do so by scanning, either 
passively or by use of active scanning. Figure  6.4 shows an example of setting the RF chan-
nel on a notebook computer.

IBSS Security
With IBSS networks, there is no centralized control and no security management features. 
Security is left up to the individual user or wireless device. If a user inadvertently shares a 
resource, it could expose sensitive information and pose security threats. This can be a con-
cern for many enterprise installations, and therefore the use of an IBSS is against corporate 
security policy in many organizations.
IBSS Terminology
The WLAN industry uses several different terms to identify an IBSS. The term used is up to 
the manufacturer or a specific implementation. An IBSS is usually identified by one of fol-
lowing three terms:
■
■
Independent basic service set (IBSS)
■
■
Ad hoc
■
■
Peer-to-peer
Regardless of the terminology used—IBSS, ad hoc, or peer-to-peer—it comes down 
to WLAN devices connecting to each other without the use of an access point or other 
wireless infrastructure device. All devices in an IBSS network work independently of one 
another, and there is no centralized management or administration capability. This type of 
connection may be useful in homes or small offices for ease of installation but is rarely if at 
all used with enterprise or corporate wireless networks.
Advantages and Disadvantages of an IBSS
The advantages and disadvantages of an IBSS network will vary depending on the 
application.
Some of the advantages of IBSS are as follows:
Easy to Configure    To create an IBSS, the user only needs to specify an SSID, set the RF 
channel, and enable the security settings.
No Investment in Access Point Hardware    An IBSS can be created with the IEEE 802.11 
WLAN adapter that is built into the wireless computer or other device. No infrastructure 
device such as an access point is required to connect the WLAN devices together.
Some disadvantages of IBSS are as follows:
Limited Radio Frequency Range and Interference    Because radio communications is two-
way, all devices need to be in a mutual communication range of one another in order to 
operate effectively. Interference may also be an issue if the RF channel is not configured 
correctly.
No Centralized Administration Capability    In many large or enterprise deployments, IBSS 
connectivity is against corporate security policy because it is impossible to manage such 
networks centrally.

222 
Chapter 6 ■ Communication for Wireless Networking
Not Scalable  There is no set maximum number of devices that can be part of an IBSS net-
work, but the capacity of such networks is low compared to other types of networks. 
 Difficult to Secure  Some computer operating systems have made the setup of an IBSS 
wireless network very easy for any type of user. These users may inadvertently share or 
allow access to sensitive or proprietary information. This security threat is worse if an IBSS 
wireless network is also physically connected to a wired network and provides a connec-
tion from an unsecured or unmanaged wireless network to a company’s wired network 
infrastructure. 
 
 A WLAN device such as a notebook computer configured as an IBSS 
device can be a potential security threat if it is also connected to a wired 
network infrastructure. It could provide a bridge for unsecured wireless 
access to the company’s wired network. In this configuration, potential 
intruders would have access to information from a corporate network by 
connecting to the unsecured ad hoc network. For this reason, this type 
of configuration is against written corporate security policies of many 
organizations and is strictly enforced. Organizations may use wireless 
intrusion prevention systems to detect and shut down wireless ad hoc 
networks. It is important to inform visitors and contractors who may 
be physically connected to the company’s infrastructure when ad hoc 
networks are against the corporate security policy to prevent potential 
security issues.  
 
 Setting up an IBSS network is similar to setting up a workgroup for an 
operating system such as Microsoft Windows. All devices with the same 
workgroup name will be able to communicate with each other sharing 
resources such as files, printers, and so on. 
 The Basic Service Set 
 The  basic service set (BSS) is the foundation of the wireless network. This mode consists of 
an access point connected to a network infrastructure and its associated wireless devices. 
This is considered the foundation because it may be one of many access points that form a 
wireless network. With a BSS setup, each access point is connected to a network infrastruc-
ture, also known as the  distribution system (DS), which allows connected WLAN devices 
to access network resources based on the appropriate permissions the wireless device or 
user has access to. The RF area of coverage, known as the  basic service area (BSA), depends 
on several factors, such as the antenna gain and RF output power settings. Any IEEE 
802.11 wireless device in radio range and part of the BSA with the correct confi guration 
parameters, including the SSID and security settings, will be able to connect to the access 
point. Figure  6.5 shows an example of a BSS.

Infrastructure mode consists of a wireless access point connected to a DS. The BSS con-
sisting of one access point is a common implementation in many homes, SOHO, or small 
to medium businesses (SMBs). The decision to use a single access point depends on several 
factors, among them the size of the location, how the wireless network is used, and how 
many wireless devices will be connected.
Just as in an IBSS configuration, several parameters need to be configured for a BSS. 
These include the SSID or name of the network, the RF channel to be used, and any  
security parameters that are set on the BSS. The access point will broadcast these and  
other parameters about the wireless network to devices that want to connect to the BSS, 
thus requiring minimal configuration on the wireless client side. Unlike the IBSS, in a BSS 
the RF channel is set on the access point and not on the wireless client device.
Advantages and Disadvantages of a BSS
A BSS has many benefits, advantages, and disadvantages. Some of the advantages are as 
follows:
■
■
Uses intelligent devices with a large feature set to provide users with consistent,  
reliable, and secure communications to a wireless network.
■
■
Useful in a variety of situations: homes, SOHO, and small to large businesses.
■
■
Very scalable; you can increase the coverage and capacity of a BSS by adding more 
access points.
■
■
Centralized administration and control.
■
■
Security parameters and specific access can be set centrally.

224 
Chapter 6  ■  Communication for Wireless Networking  
Some of the disadvantages of a BSS are as follows:
■
■
Incurs additional hardware costs compared to IBSS.
■
■
Usually will require a site survey to determine RF coverage and capacity requirements.
■
■
Must be connected to a network infrastructure known as the distribution system, 
either wired or wireless mesh.
■
■
Requires additional knowledge for configuration and deployment.

The Extended Service Set
As stated in the IEEE 802.11-2016 standard, an extended service set (ESS) is defined as 
a “set of one or more interconnected basic service sets (BSSs) that appears as a single BSS 
to the Logical Link Control (LLC) layer at any station (STA) associated with one of those 
BSSs.” In basic terms, this can be one or more access points connected to a common wired 
or wireless DS. An ESS is a common configuration in most WLAN deployments for small 
to medium businesses as well as large enterprise organizations.

Wireless LAN Operation Methods 
225  
In most cases, an ESS would be used to provide consistent and complete coverage across 
an entire organization. An ESS can be thought of as several basic service sets (BSSs) that 
must have matching parameters, such as SSID and security settings. If the SSIDs of two 
access points do not match, then they are considered separate BSSs, even though they are 
connected by a common network infrastructure. It is the DS connecting these together and 
a common network name (SSID) that makes up the ESS. In most if not all cases, the BSA 
for each BSS will overlap to allow transition (roaming) from one BSS to another. Figure 6.7 
shows an example of an ESS.

Wireless Clients
Roaming between access points is a critical component of WLAN technology in most 
modern wireless network deployments. This is because the WLAN is now a major part of 
every corporate network. Many envision a complete wireless network for all communica-
tions, including data, voice, and video. Roaming is so important that the IEEE added the 
802.11r amendment to provide a standardized methodology for client station roaming and 
fast secure transition within the WLAN. Recall that roaming within an IEEE 802.11 WLAN 
is always decided by the client device with the exception of single channel architecture (SCA). 
IEEE 802.11r provides the fast secure transition between access points. Keep in mind that IEEE 
802.11k and IEEE 802,11v work with IEEE 802.11r to provide more information to the wire-
less device so it can make a more intelligent roaming decision based on the RF environment.
The Basic Service Area
The basic service area (BSA) is the area of RF coverage or the RF cell that encompasses a 
wireless access point and its associated stations. A wireless client device will be contained 
in the BSA as long as it has enough required receive signal strength to maintain an associa-
tion state with the wireless access point.

Chapter 6  ■  Communication for Wireless Networking  
Know Your Abbreviations: SSID vs. ESSID vs. BSSID 
It is easy to confuse the abbreviations for several of the WLAN terms we have learned. 
This sidebar summarizes the differences.
SSID (Service Set Identifier)
SSID (service set identifier) is the network name and provides some segmentation of the 
wireless network.
ESSID (Extended Service Set Identifier)
Although not defined by the IEEE 802.11 standard or amendments, extended service set 
identifier (ESSID) is a term that some manufacturers use in place of SSID. For the most 
part, ESSID and SSID are synonymous terms for the name or segmentation of a wireless 
network. The term used will vary among manufacturers. The term ESSID was adopted 
by some manufacturers because it implies more than one access point is using the same 
SSID and security settings connected to a common DS.
BSSID (Basic Service Set Identifier)
It is sometimes easy to confuse the basic service set identifier (BSSID) with the SSID or 
name of the network. The BSSID is defined as the unique identifier, Media Access Control 
(MAC) address of the basic service set. It is important to note that some manufactur-
ers may allow for several BSSIDs to be connected to a single access point radio or for a 
single common BSSID to be shared among many access points.
To review, the MAC address is the unique identifier of a network adapter or what is known 
as the hardware address. The radio in an access point is also a network adapter. The dif-
ference between a wired and a wireless network adapter is simply that no Ethernet jack is 
available on a wireless adapter. Instead, a radio is used for Layer 1 communications.
The MAC address is a 48-bit, IEEE 802 format address that uniquely identifies the network 
interface adapter—or, in this case, radio. The format of the BSSID is XX:XX:XX:YY:YY:YY, 
where X is the number assigned to a manufacturer, and Y is the unique hardware address 
of the device.
Although the BSSID uniquely identifies the access point’s radio using a MAC address, the 
SSID is broadcast as the name of the network in order to allow devices to connect. Some 
devices allow for multiple SSIDs, which use multiple BSSIDs for a single radio. This lets a 
single access point connected to a wired infrastructure provide multiple WLANs.
In an ad hoc or IBSS network there is no access point for centralized communication. 
Instead, WLAN devices communicate directly with each other. Because there is no access 
point in this configuration, the BSSID is a randomly generated number that has the same for-
mat as the 802 MAC address and is generated by the first ad hoc wireless device at startup.

Connecting to an IEEE 802.11 
Wireless Network
In order for a device to successfully connect to a wireless network, several different frame 
exchanges must take place. Various frame types allow for specific functions to occur. They 
include the authentication and association process, reserving the medium, exchanging data, 
and power save functions. The following section introduces some of the frame types and 
the roles they play in wireless networking.
IEEE 802.11 Frame Types
As discussed in Chapter 4, “Radio Frequency Fundamentals for Wireless Networking,” 
devices communicate by sending RF waves to each other through the air. These RF waves 
carry the digital data from one device to another. At this stage, the information traveling 
through the air is organized into what are known as frames. These frame types play vari-
ous roles depending on the information being sent. WLANs use three different frame types.
Management Frames
Management frames are used to manage the network. Management frames assist WLAN 
devices in finding and connecting to a wireless network. This includes advertising the capa-
bilities of the WLAN and allowing connections by the authentication and association pro-
cess. Management frames are exchanged only between immediate wireless devices, such as 
an access point and client device, and never cross the Data Link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI 
model. It is important to understand that management frames are always transmitted at 
the lowest mandatory data rate of the service set so that all stations on the same RF chan-
nel in the BSA can understand them. The following are examples of common management 
frames:
■
■
Beacon
■
■
Probe request
■
■
Probe response
■
■
Authentication

Control Frames
Control frames are used to control access to the wireless medium by allowing devices to 
reserve the medium and acknowledge data. In addition, some control frames are used  
to request data from the access point after returning from a power save state and with  

228 
Chapter 6  ■  Communication for Wireless Networking  
IEEE 802.11 protection mechanisms to allow wireless device coexistence. Some examples 
of control frames are as follows:
■
■
RTS
■
■
CTS
■
■
CTS to Self
■
■
PS-Poll
■
■
ACK
Data Frames
As their name implies, data frames are used to carry data payload or Layer 3 information 
between wireless devices.
A special type of data frame is the null data, or null function, frame, which helps imple-
ment power save features and is not used to carry any data payload. There is also a variant 
of the null frame called the QoS null frame, which is used with quality of service power 
save mode. The following are examples of data frames:
■
■
Data
■
■
QoS data
■
■
Null data
The details of the specific functions of each of these frame types are beyond the scope 
of this book and the exam objectives; however, some of these frames needed to be briefly 
introduced in order to explain upcoming topics. These include a wireless device “listening” 
for a network to join, supplying the appropriate credentials, and finally connecting to send 
data to the network infrastructure.
Wireless Network Discovery
Wireless network discovery is the process of a client device scanning for wireless networks 
and identifying the parameters of the network, including the SSID, supported data rates, 
and security settings. The discovery phase consists of the passive scanning and active scan-
ning processes. Wireless network discovery prepares a wireless client device to perform an 
IEEE 802.11 authentication and association, which will allow a device access to the wire-
less network.
Passive Scanning
The first part of the discovery phase in IEEE 802.11 wireless networking is known as pas-
sive scanning. This process allows WLAN devices to “listen” for information about wire-
less networks in the radio receiving area of the wireless network or the BSA. During the 
passive scanning process, WLAN devices will listen for specific information to make them 
aware of networks in the area. An analogy to this process would be using an FM radio 
tuner to scan through the entire band listening for a station to tune in to. The radio will 
scan through the band listening for different stations. Once a desired station is heard, the 
person listening can stop on that specific radio station.

229  
Management frames assist WLAN devices in finding and connecting to a wireless net-
work. An example of a management frame that works in the discovery phase or passive 
scanning is a beacon frame. This frame, for the most part, is an advertisement of the wire-
less network. It carries specific information about the access point or basic service set such 
as the SSID, the RF channel that it is operating on, the available data rates it is configured 
for, the security parameters, and much more. During the passive scanning phase, wireless 
devices listen for beacons advertising the details about the wireless networks in the area or 
radio range of the client device. WLAN devices are constantly listening for beacon frames. 
Figure 6.8 shows a WLAN client passively scanning and listening for an access point to 
connect with.

By default, beacons for most access points broadcast at about 10 times a second. This 
value is actually 1024 microseconds and is identified as the target beacon transmission time 
(TBTT). Although this interval can be changed, it is recommended to do so only if neces-
sary or recommended by the manufacturer. In some cases, manufacturers may suggest spe-
cific timing intervals for such frames as beacons.

Chapter 6  ■  Communication for Wireless Networking  
Active Scanning
Active scanning is the second part of the WLAN discovery phase. In active scanning, 
WLAN devices wishing to connect to a network send out a management frame known as 
a probe request. The function of this management frame is to find a specific wireless access 
point to connect with. Depending on the wireless client utility software used, if an SSID is 
specified in the client utility software active profile, the device will join only a network with 
the matching SSID that is specified. An exception to this is a probe request that contains a 
“wildcard SSID” or a “null SSID.” The IEEE 802.11 standard requires all access points to 
respond to a broadcast probe request that contains a null SSID value. This type of probe 
request frame will not specify an SSID value and will rely on the access points to provide 
the SSID in the probe response frame.
Access points constantly listen for probe request frames. Any access point within hear-
ing range of the wireless device and having a matching SSID sends out a probe response 
frame to the wireless device. If more than one access point responds, the device selects the 
“best” access point to connect with based on certain factors, such as signal strength and 
signal quality. Figure 6.10 illustrates the active scanning process.

Frames Used for Active Scanning
During the active scanning process, two frames are exchanged between the device and 
the access point.
1.	
The WLAN device sends a broadcast probe request frame to all devices, including 
access points within radio range.
2.	
The access point(s) sends a probe response frame to the device so that it can identify 
the parameters of the network before joining.

 The IEEE 802.11 standard requires access points to respond to devices that 
are sending a null or blank SSID. The standard refers to this as a wildcard 
SSID. It is important not to confuse this with disabling the SSID broad-
cast on an access point. Most wireless equipment manufacturers provide 
the capability to set the access point not to respond to a probe request 
with a null or wildcard SSID. If the AP is set not to respond to such probe 
requests, the wireless device is required to have the SSID specified in the 
client utility in order to connect to the BSS. 
 IEEE 802.11 Authentication 
 Authentication in general is defi ned as verifying or confi rming an identity. We use a vari-
ety of authentication mechanisms in our daily lives, such as logging onto a computer or 
network at home or at the offi ce, accessing secure sites on the Internet, using an ATM 
machine, or showing an identifi cation badge to get access to a building. 
 IEEE 802.11 devices must use an “authentication process” in order to access network 
resources. This IEEE 802.11 authentication process differs from conventional authentication 
methods such as providing credentials, such as a username and password, to gain access to 
a network. The  authentication discussed here is wireless device or IEEE 802.11 authentication, 
required in order for the device to become part of the wireless network and participate in 
exchanging data frames by creating a connection to the access point. (Providing credentials 
such as a username and password or a preshared key is a different type of authentication, 
to be discussed in Chapter  8 .) The IEEE 802.11 standard addresses two types of IEEE 
802.11 authentication methods: open system and shared-key. 
 IEEE 802.11 Open System Authentication 
 This 802.11 authentication method is defi ned by the IEEE 802.11 standard as a null 
authentication algorithm and is a two-step authentication process. Two management 
frames are exchanged between the device and the access point during open system 
authentication. For the most part, open system authentication cannot fail unless other 
security measures such as MAC address fi ltering are put in place that will prevent the 
device from accessing the network. Keep in mind that IEEE 802.11 open system authen-
tication always exists, even with the most secure WLANs. It is used to allow the wireless 
station to connect to the access point and then after association use additional credentials 
such as a passphrase or username and password pair for authentication. If the wireless 
station did not perform an open system authentication and association fi rst, there would 
be no way to use additional security mechanisms. IEEE 802.11 open system authen-
tication is the only valid authentication process allowed with newer WLAN security 

232 
Chapter 6 ■ Communication for Wireless Networking
amendments and interoperability certifi cations for the network to be considered a robust 
security network (RSN). 
 Open system authentication is a very simple process. A WLAN device will ask an access 
point, “Can I be a part of this network?” and the access point will respond, “Sure, come 
join the party.” So there really is no validation of identity. Open system authentication is 
considered a two-way frame exchange because two authentication frames are sent during 
this process. It is not a request and response situation; it is authentication and success. 
 Figure  6.12 illustrates open system authentication.

 Open system authentication does not provide any type of data encryption. 
With open system authentication, optional security solutions can be used 
for data encryption as required. Wireless security solutions will be dis-
cussed in more detail in Chapter  8 . 
 Two steps are used for open system authentication. One management frame is sent in 
each step. 
 1. 
 The WLAN device wanting to authenticate sends an authentication frame to the access 
point. This frame is acknowledged by the access point. 
 2. 
 The access point accepting the authentication sends a successful authentication frame 
back to the device. This frame is acknowledged by the authenticating device. 
 Figure  6.13 shows a packet capture of the two-way, open system authentication frame 
exchange.

 IEEE 802.11 Shared-Key Authentication 
 IEEE 802.11 shared-key is another authentication method defi ned by the 1997 release of 
the original IEEE 802.11 standard. It is a little more complex than open system authen-
tication. This IEEE 802.11 authentication method is a four-way frame exchange. During 
shared-key authentication , four management frames are sent between the wireless device 
wanting to join the wireless network and the access point. Shared-key authentication differs 
from open system authentication in that shared-key authentication is used for both IEEE 
802.11 authentication and data encryption. 
 
 It is important not to confuse the IEEE 802.11 standard shared-key authen-
tication described here with newer authentication and encryption methods 
defined in the IEEE 802.11i amendment to the standard, which includes 
passphrase/pre-shared key authentication. IEEE 802.11i, WPA/WPA2 
pre-shared key authentication, will be discussed further in Chapter  8 . 
 IEEE 802.11 shared-key authentication is considered fl awed because information is sent 
across the air in cleartext that relates to the authentication key and therefore the encryp-
tion key that is used and could be captured by an intruder. If an intruder were to capture 
the four wireless frames used during the IEEE 802.11 shared-key authentication process, 
they would be able to use this information with the appropriate software and extract the 
security (WEP) key. The original IEEE 802.11 shared-key authentication requires the use of 
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) for both wireless device authentication and data encryp-
tion. Because WEP is mandatory with IEEE 802.11 shared-key authentication, an intruder 
could potentially identify the WEP key used for the network by capturing the authenti-
cation process using a wireless protocol analyzer. Shared-key authentication, therefore, 
should always be avoided and is not allowed when using newer IEEE 802.11i, WPA, or 
WPA2 security methods. 
 
 Some manufacturers have removed the option to set IEEE 802.11 shared-
key authentication, both in infrastructure devices such as access points 
and bridges and in client software utilities. If legacy devices are in use on 
the network and still use shared-key authentication as the only authentica-
tion option, steps need to be taken to protect the integrity of the network 
and also to identify an appropriate upgrade path for the devices using this 
authentication.

Authentication
Because WEP is mandatory with IEEE 802.11 shared-key authentication, it makes a 
system vulnerable to intrusion. Therefore, open system authentication is considered more 
secure than shared-key authentication when WEP was used with open system authentica-
tion. This is because WEP was used to encrypt the data only and not used for the IEEE 
802.11 authentication process. WEP was designed as a way to protect wireless networking 
users from casual eavesdropping. The IEEE 802.11-2016 standard states, “The use of WEP 
for confidentiality, authentication, or access control is deprecated. The WEP algorithm is 
unsuitable for the purposes of this standard.”
Frames Used for Shared-Key Authentication
An 802.11 wireless device must perform an IEEE 802.11 authentication to the wireless net-
work prior to associating according to the 802.11 standard. The following steps show the 
four-way frame exchange used for shared-key authentication. This method should not be 
used but is shown here to illustrate the process.
1.	
The WLAN device wanting to authenticate sends an authentication frame to the 
access point. This frame is acknowledged by the access point.
2.	
The access point sends a frame back to the WLAN device that contains a challenge 
text. This frame is acknowledged by the WLAN device.
3.	
The WLAN device sends a frame back to the access point containing an encrypted 
response to the challenge text. The response is encrypted using the device’s WEP 
key. This frame is acknowledged by the access point.
4.	
After verifying the encrypted response, the access point accepts the authentication 
and sends a “successful authentication” frame back to the device. This final frame is 
acknowledged by the device.

IEEE 802.11 Association
IEEE 802.11 association takes place after a wireless device has been successfully 802.11 
authenticated either by open system authentication or by shared-key authentication. In the 
association state, the authenticated device can pass traffic across the access point to the net-
work infrastructure or other associated wireless devices, allowing access to resources that 
the device or user has permissions to access. After a device is authenticated and associated, 
it is considered to be part of the BSS. A device must be 802.11 authenticated before it can 
be associated. Figure 6.16 illustrates the association process, and Figure 6.17 shows frames 
used during the association process.

After successful association, the IEEE 802.11 authentication and association process

system authentication or WEP for authentication and encryption. After this process is

complete, more advanced authentication mechanisms, such as IEEE 802.1X/EAP (which 
provides user-based authentication) or preshared key (passphrase), can be used to secure 
the wireless network. These and other security components will be discussed in more detail 
in Chapter 8.
Frames Used for IEEE 802.11 Association
After a successful 802.11 authentication, the association process will begin. Association 
allows a wireless device to send information across the access point to the network infra-
structure or other wireless devices connected to the access point.
1.	
A WLAN device sends an association request frame to the access point. This frame is 
acknowledged by the access point.
2.	
The access point sends an association response frame to the device. This frame is 
acknowledged by the associating device.
IEEE 802.11 Deauthentication and Disassociation
It is worthwhile to understand that the opposite of authentication and association can 
occur in a WLAN. These events are known as deauthentication and disassociation. 
Deauthentication occurs when an existing authentication is no longer valid. This can be 
caused by a WLAN device logging off from the current connection or transitioning to a 
different BSS. A disassociation occurs when an association to an access point is terminated. 
This may occur when the associated WLAN device roams from one BSS to another. Both 
deauthentication and disassociation are notifications, not requests. Since neither can be 
refused by either side, they are both considered automatically successful from the sender’s 
perspective. Unless IEEE 802.11w (management frame protection) is implemented, deau-
thentication can also be a security issue. These frames can be used for denial of service 
(DoS) attacks or to hijack a wireless device. Both deauthentication and disassociation 
frames are management frames. Figure 6.18 shows how disassociation and deauthentica-
tion frames would look on a protocol analyzer.

The Distribution System 
237
 
 Tools are available that will continuously send deauthentication frames 
to a device. Use of this type of tool can be considered a DoS attack. An 
intruder may also use a deauthentication frame to force a device to reau-
thenticate to an access point, causing the device to be hijacked. This as 
well as other possible intrusion techniques will be discussed in Chapter  8 . 
The 802.11w amendment provides enhancements to the IEEE 802.11 stan-
dard that enables data integrity, data origin authenticity, replay protection, 
and data confidentiality for selected IEEE 802.11 management frames, 
including authentication and association. 
 The Distribution System 
 In WLAN technology, the  distribution system (DS) is the common network infrastructure 
to which wireless access points are connected; it can be wired or wireless mesh. In most 
cases this would be an Ethernet segment. In this capacity, the access point acts like a Layer 
2 translational bridge. A  translational bridge is defi ned as a device used to connect two or 
more dissimilar types of LANs together, such as wireless (IEEE 802.11) and Ethernet (IEEE 
802.3). From a receiver’s perspective, this allows an access point to take information from 
the air (the communication medium in wireless networking) and make a decision either 
to send it back out to the same wireless radio or to forward it across to the DS. An access 
point can do this because it has enough intelligence to determine if a data frame is destined 
to be sent to the DS or if it should stay on the originating wireless side of the network. 
This is possible because the access point knows whether a device is part of the WLAN side 
through the authentication and association methods mentioned earlier. Figure  6.19 shows 
an example of a DS.

Chapter 6  ■  Communication for Wireless Networking  
The DS is a network segment that consists of one or more connected basic service 
sets. According to the original IEEE 802.11 standard, one or more interconnected 
basic service sets make up an ESS. The DS allows WLAN devices to communicate with 
resources on a wired network infrastructure or to communicate with each other through 
the wireless medium. Either way, all wireless frame transmissions will traverse through 
an access point.
In some cases it may be feasible and justified to use a wireless mesh distribution sys-
tem. Unlike the wired distribution system, a wireless mesh will connect basic service sets 
together using WLAN technology. Typically the best way to use a wireless mesh is to use 
two different radio technologies in the same access point. For example, using the 2.4 GHz 
band for wireless client device access and the 5 GHz band for the wireless mesh will limit 
contention and provide associated devices a better experience because one radio is used for 
device access and the other creates the mesh network. Figure 6.20 shows an example of a 
wireless DS.

Data Rates
The speed at which wireless devices are designed to exchange information is known as the 
data rate. As you will see in Chapter 7, “Modulation Technology for Wireless Networking,” 
these rates will differ depending on the wireless standard, amendment, spread spectrum 
type, or Physical layer technology in use. Table 6.1 shows data rates for various WLAN 
technologies. Data rates do not accurately represent the amount of information that is 
actually being transferred between devices and a wireless network. Figure 6.21 shows an

Throughput
Unlike data rate (the maximum amount of information theoretically capable of being sent), 
throughput is the amount of information actually being correctly received or transmitted. 
Many variables affect the throughput of information being sent. Some of these include
■
■
Spread spectrum or Physical layer technology type in use
■
■
RF interference
■
■
Number of wireless devices connected to an access point
An 802.11a/g/n wireless access point, for example, has a theoretical maximum signal-
ing rate of 600 Mbps, depending on the data rate or modulation and coding scheme in use. 
With one user connected to this access point, chances are the best throughput that could be 
expected is less than 50 percent of the maximum advertised rate. If more users connect to 
the same access point, the throughput for each user would be even less, because of the con-
tention between users sharing the same wireless medium. Figure 6.22 shows an example of 
actual throughput for an 802.11a/g/n WLAN adapter.

Packing and Shipping Data: A Throughput Analogy
Packing and shipping an item in a cardboard box is a way of looking at data rate versus 
throughput. You have a cardboard box that is rated to have a maximum capacity of two 
cubic feet. You want to send a fragile item such as a vase to somebody else. The vase, 
if measured, would really take only about one cubic foot of space. This is a very fragile 
item, however, and you want to make sure it gets to the destination without any dam-
age. Rather than just put the vase by itself in a box with a capacity of one cubic foot, you 
want to protect it with some packing material, such as bubble wrap. Wrapping the vase in 
bubble wrap will take an additional one cubic foot of space.
The data rate is analogous to the box capable of holding two cubic feet of material. The 
one-cubic-foot vase is analogous to the actual data being sent. The packing material is 
analogous to the contention management and other overhead that causes the throughput 
to be less than the theoretical capacity of the WLAN device.
In Exercise 6.1 you will measure the throughput of your own wireless network.

Measuring Throughput of a Wireless Network
In this activity, you will measure throughput of a wireless network. If you have the proper 
equipment, it is not too difficult. If you already have an existing wireless network set up 
with a computer connected to the wired side or DS, you have a good part of the setup 
done. This exercise uses the JPerf software program for Microsoft Windows. JPerf is a 
graphical front-end program for IPerf from SourceForge. JPerf does require that Java 
be installed on the computer. The following step-by-step instructions assume a wireless 
access point already configured with TCP/IP settings as well as SSID. To perform this 
exercise, you will need the following equipment:
■

Dynamic Rate Switching
When a wireless device moves through the BSA or as the distance from the access point 
increases, the data rate will decrease. Conversely, as the wireless device moves closer to the 
access point, the data rate can increase. This is called dynamic rate switching (DRS), also 
known as dynamic rate shifting and even dynamic rate selection. This process allows an 
associated wireless device to adapt to the RF signal strength and signal quality in a particu-
lar location of the BSA. DRS typically is accomplished through proprietary mechanisms 
set by the manufacturer of the wireless device. The main goal of DRS is to improve per-
formance for the wireless device connected to an access point. As a wireless device moves 
away from an access point, the amount of received signal will decrease because of the free 
space path loss. When this occurs, the modulation type will change because the RF signal 
quality is less, and thus a lower data rate will be realized.

Wireless LAN Transitioning/Roaming 
247  
You will see in Chapter 7 that different data rates use different modulation technologies. 
Using a less complex modulation type at a lower data rate will provide better overall per-
formance as the station moves away from the access point. Figure 6.23 illustrates how DRS 
works. As the wireless device moves away from the access point, the data rate will decrease. 
Keep in mind the opposite is true as well. As a wireless device moves closer to an access 
point, the data rate will increase.

Wireless LAN Transitioning/Roaming
In WLAN technology, transitioning (also referred to as roaming) is the term for what hap-
pens when a wireless device moves from one BSS or access point to another. Standards-
based transitioning was not addressed in the original IEEE 802.11 standard but was 
specified in later amendments. This process is typically accomplished in a proprietary man-
ner based on how the manufacturer chooses to implement it. Manufacturers use different 
criteria to initiate roaming from one access point to another. There was an amendment 
to the IEEE 802.11 standard (IEEE 802.11F, Inter-Access Point Protocol) that was rati-
fied in June 2003 as a recommended practice intended to address multivendor access point 
interoperability. This recommended practice was implemented by few if any manufacturers, 
however, and was withdrawn by the IEEE 802 Executive Committee in February 2006. 
The next attempt to standardize transitioning between access points was IEEE 802.11r, 
which was ratified in 2008. The driving force behind this amendment to the standard was 
to allow for fast secure transition with voice devices over a wireless network. Keep in mind 
that IEEE 802.11r is used in conjunction with IEEE 802.1X/EAP and requires CCMP/AES 
support for both the infrastructure and client devices.

248 
Chapter 6  ■  Communication for Wireless Networking  
When a WLAN device moves through a BSA and receives a signal from another access 
point, it needs to decide whether to stay associated with the current access point or to reas-
sociate with the new access point. This decision when to roam is proprietary and based on 
specific manufacturer criteria. Some of these criteria manufacturers use include
■
■
Signal strength
■
■
Signal-to-noise ratio
■
■
Error rate
■
■
Number of currently associated devices
The most common metric used is received signal strength. When a WLAN device chooses 
to reassociate to a new access point, the original access point will hand off the association to 
the new access point as requested from the new access point. Keep in mind it is the wireless 
client device that initiates the move to a new access point. This move is done over the wired 
network or DS based on how the manufacturer implemented the roaming criteria. Figure 6.24 
illustrates a notebook computer roaming from one access point to a new access point.

Frames Used for Reassociation (Roaming)
When a device transitions or “roams” to a new access point, it needs to associate to the 
new access point. Because the device is already associated, in order to connect to the 
new access point it must complete a reassociation process.
1.	
A WLAN device sends a reassociation request frame to the new access point. This 
frame is acknowledged by the new access point.
2.	
The new access point sends a reassociation response frame to the wireless device 
after handoff across the DS from the original access point has occurred. This frame is 
acknowledged by the reassociating wireless device.

 The 802.11r amendment to the standard was ratified in 2008 and is now 
part of the IEEE 802.11-2016 standard. This amendment specifies fast BSS 
transition (FT) and allows for fast secure roaming for devices between 
basic service sets. The main objective of this amendment is to support 
wireless voice over IP (VoIP) technology allowing for a consistent secure 
connection to the wireless network. 
 IEEE 802.11 Power Save Operations 
 Many WLAN devices are portable and use DC battery power to some degree. A wireless 
network adapter uses DC power to operate, and in some cases this could be a signifi cant 
drain on the battery in the device. This is especially true with newer IEEE 802.11n/ac wire-
less adapters that support MIMO technology. The original IEEE 802.11 standard addresses 
a power save operation designed to allow a WLAN radio to enter a dozing state in order 
to conserve DC power and extend battery life. If the WLAN device is plugged into a con-
sistent power source such as an AC outlet, there is no reason to implement power save fea-
tures. However, portable devices that are mobile and may not have access to an AC power 
source should consider using power save operations. The original IEEE 802.11 standard 
specifi ed two different power save modes: active mode (AM) and power save (PS) mode. 
The PS mode is considered legacy because the IEEE 802.11e amendment for quality of ser-
vice addresses new, more effi cient power save mechanisms. Although the original PS mode 
may be considered legacy, it still may be used in some devices. As mentioned earlier in this 
chapter, in the section “IEEE 802.11 Frame Types,” a data frame known as a  null function 
frame is used with power management and does not carry any data but is used to inform 
the access point of a change in power state. This is a non-standard variant that is more effi -
cient than the original power save mode because it does not use a PS-Poll frame to retrieve 
buffered data frames from an access point. 
 Active Mode 
 In  active mode (AM) a WLAN device or station (STA) may receive frames at any time 
and is always in an “awake” state. In this case, the WLAN device is not relying on battery 
power; thus, there is no reason for the device to assume a low power state, and it will never 
doze. Some manufacturers refer to active mode as  continuous aware mode (CAM). 

250 
Chapter 6  ■  Communication for Wireless Networking  
Power Save Mode
In power save (PS) mode, the WLAN device or station (STA) will doze or enter a low 
power state for very short periods of times. At specific time intervals, the device will “lis-
ten” for selected beacons and determine if any data is waiting for it (buffered) at the access 
point. The beacon frame contains information for associated devices regarding power save. 
When a WLAN device associates to an access point, the device receives what is known as 
an association ID (AID). The AID is a value that will represent that device in various func-
tions, including PS mode. The beacon frame contains an indicator for each AID associated 
device to let wireless devices know whether they have data waiting for them or buffered at 
the access point. If it is determined that the access point does have data buffered for a spe-
cific device, the device will send a control frame message (PS-Poll frame) to the access point 
to request the buffered data. Figure 6.26 shows where power save mode can be set in the 
advanced settings of the wireless adapter device driver.
F i g u r e  6 . 2 6     The driver settings for a wireless adapter in a laptop computer and 
power save mode setting
Power save mode may cause some amount of overhead for the WLAN device, and 
there is a trade-off in performance. With power save mode enabled, the battery life will 
be extended; however, performance will suffer to some degree because the device will not 
be available to receive data continuously. The device will be able to receive buffered data 
only during the “awake” state. Power save mode is common in applications where battery 
conservation is important, such as barcode scanners, voice over Wi-Fi-enabled phones, and 
other handheld devices.

IEEE 802.11 Protection Mechanisms 
251  
Use of Power Save Mode in Barcode Scanners
Organizations such as retail, manufacturing, and warehousing have been using 802.11 
WLAN technologies for many years. Many of these businesses use WLAN devices such 
as barcode scanners in addition to notebook computers and other portable devices. 
Barcode scanners are used heavily for inventory and asset tracking purposes. These 
devices must run for many hours at a time, typically in 8- or 10-hour shifts for individuals 
who may be using them. Applications such as this greatly benefit from using IEEE 802.11 
power save features and extending battery life of WLAN devices. This minimizes down-
time because batteries in these devices don’t have to be changed or recharged as often 
during a work shift.
Automatic Power Save Delivery
The IEEE 802.11e Quality of Service amendment to the standard fueled the need for more 
efficient power save mechanisms in wireless networking. Depending on the implementa-
tion and requirements, legacy power save modes may not be efficient enough to work with 
applications that use QoS, such as voice and video. Automatic power save delivery (APSD) 
differs from the original power save mode in that a trigger frame will wake a device in 
order to receive data. APSD is a more efficient way of performing power save functions.  
It works well with time-bound applications that are subject to latency, such as voice and 
real-time video.
IEEE 802.11 Protection Mechanisms
In order to allow newer, faster WLAN technology such as 802.11g and 802.11n devices to 
communicate with older, slower wireless devices, technology called protection mechanisms 
was designed to allow for backward compatibility. The mechanisms available depend on 
which amendment to the standard is used. Protection mechanisms will provide the back-
ward compatibility needed to allow different technologies to coexist in the same RF space.
There are two broad categories of protection mechanism:
■
■
Extended rate physical (ERP) protection mechanism for IEEE 802.11g networks
■
■
High-throughput (HT) protection mechanism for IEEE 802.11n networks
Each category includes several modes for specific situations.

252 
Chapter 6  ■  Communication for Wireless Networking  
IEEE 802.11g Extended Rate Physical Protection 
Mechanisms
In order for IEEE 802.11g and IEEE 802.11b devices to coexist in the same BSA, the wire-
less access point must use extended rate physical (ERP) protection. Most manufacturers 
of IEEE 802.11 WLAN equipment will provide options when it comes to coexistence. 
These options usually include the capability to set an access point to one of three operation 
modes:
■
■
IEEE 802.11b-only mode: DSSS and HR/DSSS
■
■
IEEE 802.11g-only mode: ERP-OFDM
■
■
IEEE 802.11b/g/n mixed mode: DSSS, HR/DSSS, and ERP-OFDM
IEEE 802.11b-Only Mode
This operation mode requires setting an access point to operate in 802.11b-only mode. This 
involves disabling all the IEEE 802.11g ERP-OFDM data rates of 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 
and 54 Mbps and allowing only DSSS data rates of 1 and 2 Mbps and HR/DSSS rates of 
5.5 and 11 Mbps. Enabling this mode limits the maximum data rate to 11 Mbps. Setting an 
access point to this mode has limited applications, such as using legacy IEEE 802.11b-only 
capable devices.
IEEE 802.11g-Only Mode
This operation mode is the opposite of 802.11b-only mode. It disables all of the IEEE 
802.11b DSSS and HR/DSSS data rates of 1, 2, 5.5, and 11 Mbps, and it allows the IEEE 
802.11g ERP-OFDM data rates of 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 54 Mbps. This operation 
mode is useful in an environment where backward compatibility to 802.11b is not required, 
such as an environment where all devices connecting have IEEE 802.11g capability, and the 
throughput needs to be maximized; thus, there are no IEEE 802.11b devices in use.
IEEE 802.11b/g/n Mixed Mode
Most deployments in the 2.4 GHz ISM band use this mode for communications. This 
allows devices that support the IEEE 802.11g/n amendments and IEEE 802.11b devices to 
operate together in the same BSA and be associated to the same access point. As mentioned 
in Chapter 2, “Wireless Local Area Networking, Standards, and Certifications,” through-
put will decrease when IEEE 802.11b devices and IEEE 802.11g/n devices are both associ-
ated to the same access point.
Extended Rate Physical (ERP) mixed mode uses control frames to reserve the wireless 
medium. Two options are available:
Request to Send/Clear to Send (RTS/CTS)    One option of control frames that are used as 
a protection mechanism to reserve the RF medium.
Clear to Send (CTS) to Self    A single frame used as a protection mechanism. This is a 
common implementation used by WLAN equipment manufacturers. A benefit of using this 
frame is less overhead than the RTS/CTS process.

IEEE 802.11 Protection Mechanisms 
253
 Both RTS/CTS and CTS-to-Self control frames allow wireless devices using different 
Physical layer technologies to share the wireless medium and help to avoid collisions. These 
control frames specify how much time is needed for a frame exchange between the trans-
mitter and a receiver to complete. This time value is processed by all devices in the BSA 
that are not part of the frame exchange. Once this time has expired, the wireless medium is 
considered clear. 
 
 Although administrators of many wireless networks now disable IEEE 
802.11b functionality, it is important to note that in some industries this 
operation mode is still required for legacy device support. This is most 
common in warehousing, manufacturing, and retail environments. 
 IEEE 802.11n High-Throughput Protection Mechanisms 
 IEEE 802.11n devices operate in either the 2.4 GHz or the 5 GHz band. Backward com-
patibility for IEEE 802.11a/b/g devices needs to be taken into consideration. The IEEE 
802.11n amendment identifi es several different modes for high-throughput (HT) protection 
mechanisms. These mechanisms, known as  HT protection modes , are a set of rules that 
devices and access points will use for backward compatibility: 
 
■
 Mode 0–No protection mode 
 
■
 Mode 1–HT nonmember protection mode 
 
■
 Mode 2–HT 20 MHz protection mode 
 
■
 Mode 3–Non-HT mixed mode 
 These modes are constantly changing based on the RF environment and associated 
wireless devices. The goal with IEEE 802.11n wireless networks is to get to Mode 0 (no 
protection mode). With today’s wireless networks and WLAN technology, we are more 
than likely at Mode 3 (non-HT mixed mode) or possibly even one of the other two modes 
in most cases. 
 Mode 0–No Protection (AKA Greenfield) Mode 
 Mode 0, or  no protection mode , allows for HT devices only. These HT devices must also 
share operational functionality and they must match; for example, they must all support 
20 MHz or 20/40 MHz channels only. If an IEEE 802.11n (HT) access point is set to 
20/40 MHz channel width and a client capable of only 20 MHz wide channels associ-
ates, the connection is not considered no protection mode. Mode 0 does not allow IEEE 
802.11a/b/g devices using the same RF channel. IEEE 802.11a/b/g devices will not be able 
to communicate with an access point in Mode 0. Transmissions from these devices will 
cause collisions at the access point, causing some degradation in throughput because it is 
seen by the HT system as RF interference. 
 Mode 1–HT Nonmember Protection Mode 
 All devices in Mode 1, or  HT nonmember protection mode , must be HT-capable. When 
a non-HT device—that is, an IEEE 802.11a/b/g access point or wireless client device—is 

254 
Chapter 6  ■  Communication for Wireless Networking  
within the hearing range of the HT access point and on the same 20 MHz channel or one 
of the 20/40 MHz wide channels, this protection mode will be activated.
Mode 2–HT 20 MHz Protection Mode
All devices in Mode 2, or HT 20 MHz protection mode, must be HT-capable as well. The 
operation of this protection mode is based on the fact that 802.11n devices can use 20 
MHz or 20/40 MHz wide channels. Mode 2 means that at least one 20 MHz HT station is 
associated with the HT 20/40 MHz access point and that the access point provides compat-
ibility for 20 MHz devices.
Mode 3–Non-HT Mixed Mode
Mode 3, or non-HT mixed mode, is used if one or more non-HT stations are associated in 
the BSS. This mode allows backward compatibility with non-802.11n or IEEE 802.11a/b/g 
wireless devices. This is the likely the most common mode for IEEE 802.11n HT networks 
today because of the need for backward compatibility and the legacy IEEE 802.11 wireless 
devices that are still in use on most wireless networks.
Additional HT Protection Modes
Two other HT protection modes are also available:
■
■
Dual CTS is a Layer 2 protection mechanism that is used for backward compatibility 
between IEEE 802.11n HT and IEEE 802.11a/b/g devices.
■
■
Phased coexistence operation (PCO) is an optional BSS mode with alternating 20 MHz 
and 20/40 MHz phases controlled by a PCO-capable access point.
Summary
WLANs can operate in one of two methods: either ad hoc mode, which means no access 
points are used, or infrastructure mode, where an access point provides a central point of 
communication for the WLAN devices. In this chapter, we looked at these modes of opera-
tion as well as the service sets IEEE 802.11 networks use. We looked at the following three 
configurations for WLANs:
■
■
Independent basic service set (IBSS)
■
■
Basic service set (BSS)
■
■
Extended service set (ESS)
We explained the configuration of each, along with some of the advantages and dis-
advantages of each configuration—from an IBSS, which uses no access points, to a BSS 
or ESS, which uses one or many access points. Some of the configuration parameters, 
such as SSID and RF channel, and how they are used were also explained. Some of these

abbreviations are very close in spelling and sound similar when spoken. It is important to 
understand the differences among the following abbreviations:
■
■
Service set identifier (SSID)
■
■
Extended service set identifier (ESSID)
■
■
Basic service set identifier (BSSID)
■
■
Independent basic service set (IBSS)
■
■
Basic service set (BSS)
■
■
Extended service set (ESS)
■
■
Basic service area (BSA)
For example, SSID is the name of the wireless network, and the BSSID is the unique 
identifier MAC address of the AP radio.
In addition to explaining the different configurations and terminology used, we looked 
at the processes wireless devices use to connect to and become part of a WLAN, including:
■
■
Wireless discovery
■
■
Passive scanning
■
■
Active scanning
■
■
IEEE 802.11 authentication
■
■
IEEE 802.11 association
The discovery processes of passive scanning (listening for beacons) and active scanning 
(joining a WLAN) are important parts of starting the connection process. This continues 
with 802.11 authentication—in most cases open system—and the 802.11 association pro-
cess. Once these processes are complete, the device finally becomes part of the wireless net-
work, enabling it to pass traffic across to the access point to the network infrastructure.
You also learned about the components and technology that play a role with IEEE 
802.11 wireless networks, such as:
■
■
Distribution system (DS)
■
■
Data rate (what is advertised)
■
■
Throughput (what is actual)
Both a wired DS, in most cases Ethernet, and a wireless DS using radios and access 
points provide connectivity for wireless infrastructure. We looked at the differences 
between data rate and throughput. It is important to understand that an access point may 
have a data rate of 54 Mbps or even up to 6933.3 Mbps, but throughput (the actual data 
transmission rate) is typically less than half of the data rate. Because WLANs are conten-
tion based, data throughput will be even less when more devices connect to the network.
Dynamic rate switching (DRS)—a client transferring more or less data depending on 
the proximity from an access point as well as roaming or moving through the BSAs and 
being able to maintain connectivity—was also discussed in this chapter. Finally, the chapter 
covered the important topics of power save mode and protection mechanisms. With power 

256 
Chapter 6  ■  Communication for Wireless Networking  
save mode, a WLAN device is able to extend battery life by entering into a low-power state 
or “doze” for very short periods of time. This permits the device to consume less battery 
power, therefore allowing connectivity for longer periods of time without changing or 
recharging the battery. The modes discussed were
■
■
Active mode
■
■
Power save mode (PS)
■
■
Automatic power save delivery (APSD)
It is beneficial to understand the differences in power save capabilities among these 
modes.
Lastly, we discussed the following IEEE 802.11 protection mechanisms and the impor-
tance of these methods to provide backward compatibility and coexistence to older technol-
ogy devices:
■
■
Extended rate physical (ERP) protection for IEEE 802.11g
■
■
High-throughput (HT) protection for IEEE 802.11n
We looked at some highlights of both protection mechanism technologies for IEEE 
802.11g and 802.11n networks.

 In computer networking it is important to understand how digital 
data is sent from one device to another. Whether on a wired net-
work or a wireless network, an  access method is used to transfer 
this type of electronic information. Two common access methods are CSMA/CD and CSMA/
CA. The type of medium in use—wired or wireless—will determine which of these two access 
methods is best suited for the application. You saw in previous chapters that wireless LANs 
(WLANs) use radio frequencies (RFs) with air as the communication medium. This chapter will 
discuss the various techniques and methods used to get digital computer data from one device 
to another using spread-spectrum and other Physical layer modulation technologies. 
 It is important to understand that different WLAN spread-spectrum technologies such 
as DSSS HR/DSSS will allow for various data rates. The spread-spectrum or other Physical 
layer technology in use, such as orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) or 
high throughput orthogonal frequency division multiplexing HT-OFDM, will determine 
the maximum amount of data transfer as well as the resilience to noise and other interfer-
ing sources. We will look at the 802.11 channels, the number of channels available, channel 
spacing, and frequencies of the unlicensed RF bands used with wireless networking. We 
will also discuss the implications of overlapping channels and interference. Finally, this 
chapter will discuss co-location of different technologies used in various amendments to the 
standard as well as interference from WLANs and other sources, including WPANs. 
 
 The IEEE 802.11-2016 standard has been officially released. This standard 
includes all communication amendments that were outstanding or part of 
the IEEE 802.11-2012 standard, including IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n/ac. Even though 
these amendments are incorporated into the newest version of the stan-
dard, we will discuss the technology using the original amendment names, 
802.11b, 802.11a, and so on, because these names are still commonly used 
in the industry. 
 Network Access Methods 
Network access methods enable devices connected to a common infrastructure to commu-
nicate and transmit data across a network medium from one device to another. Several dif-
ferent types of network access methods are used in computer networks. The following two 
types are discussed in this chapter: 
 
■
 Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) 
 
■
 Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) 

Network Access Methods 
263  
Because Ethernet networks use a bounded wired medium and have the capabil-
ity to detect collisions, 802.3 Ethernet networks use CSMA/CD as the access method. 
Devices on a WLAN do not have the capability to detect collisions due to the use of an 
unbounded medium; therefore, 802.11 WLANs use CSMA/CA for the access method. 
Since multiple wireless devices can use an access point at the same time, wireless devices 
that connect to an access point are competing to share the medium; therefore, it is impor-
tant to control the medium in order to minimize collisions. The CSMA/CA process  
provides this control.
Detecting Network Traffic Collisions with CSMA/CD
802.3 Ethernet networks use CSMA/CD to share the medium. The name of this access 
method describes how it functions.
The abbreviation CSMA/CD is broken down as follows:
■
■
Carrier Sense—Devices sense the medium (in this case, Ethernet cable) to see if it is 
clear (no data being transmitted).
■
■
Multiple Access—Many devices accessing the medium at the same time.
■
■
Collision Detection—Detecting collisions that occur on the medium during the trans-
mission of data.
CSMA/CD is a contention-based media access control method that Ethernet devices use 
to share the medium. This method allows only one device to transmit at any one time.
In computing terminology, contention is defined as multiple devices competing for a 
chance to send data on the network. CSMA/CD functions like this:
1.	
A device with data to transmit checks whether any data is being transmitted on the 
Ethernet cable (sensing).
2.	
If the device senses that the medium is clear and no data is being transmitted, it trans-
mits its own data.
3.	
If more than one device transmits simultaneously, a collision occurs and the data is 
lost. The devices detect the collision and each will back off for a random amount of 
time.
4.	
After the random amount of time expires, the device checks the cable and attempts to 
send the data again.
This contention of the Ethernet segment is one reason for decreased data throughput of 
the transmitting devices. Figure 7.1 demonstrates CSMA/CD with desktop computers con-
nected to an Ethernet segment.

Conversation as a Form of CSMA/CD
An analogy for CSMA/CD is a conversation among a group of people in which all the 
individuals in the group would like a chance to speak. Everyone is listening to each other 
(sensing the medium). Only one person at a time gets a chance to say something. This is 
an example of a multiple access (MA) shared medium. If there is a pause in the conversa-
tion, two or more people listening may notice the opportunity and may say something at 
the exact same time, in which case neither may be heard by the rest of the group. This is 
an example of a collision. At this point, the collision is detected (CD), and those involved 
in the failed communication wait a few seconds and attempt to speak again later—hence, 
CSMA/CD.
Avoiding Network Traffic Collisions with CSMA/CA
WLANs use CSMA/CA to share the medium. The main difference from CSMA/CD is the 
CA—collision avoidance. Just as in CSMA/CD, the abbreviation CSMA/CA gives an idea 
of how it functions:
■
■
Carrier Sense—Sensing the medium, in this case the air
■
■
Multiple Access—Many devices accessing the medium at the same time
■
■
Collision Avoidance—Avoiding collisions that may occur on the medium during  
transmission
Because WLAN devices have no way to detect collisions, the CSMA/CD access method 
is not an adequate solution for WLAN communications. If WLANs were to use CSMA/
CD, collisions would occur at the wireless access point, and all data would be lost. At this 
point, a transmitting device would not know that it should retransmit the information, 
because the receiving device would be unaware that a collision occurred; the result would 
be very poor performance.

Network Access Methods 
265  
Instead of detecting transmission collisions, CSMA/CA uses mechanisms that attempt 
to avoid collisions. Although these mechanisms impose some overhead, the overall benefit 
is better data throughput because data collisions are minimized. This overhead occurs 
because devices use “countdown timers” that require them to wait for periods of time 
before they are able to transmit again. This helps to avoid data collisions.
Lecture Q&A as a Form of CSMA/CA
An analogy for CSMA/CA is the question-and-answer period following a lecture. The 
lecture hall is filled with many people (multiple access). A presenter has finished giving a 
speech, and it is now question-and-answer time. The presenter shouts out, “Does anyone 
have a question?” An attendee named Marvin listens (sensing the carrier). He does not 
hear anyone speaking, so he yells out a question. Although many people are in the room 
(again, multiple access), they can hear that Marvin has the floor and this time is dedicated 
to him. So they defer and do not ask their question until Marvin’s question has been 
answered by the speaker (collision avoidance); hence, CSMA/CA.
Reserving Time for Data Transmission Using  
Distributed Coordination Function
One of the access methods WLAN devices use to communicate is known as distributed 
coordination function (DCF). This method of access employs a contention period for 
devices competing to send data on the network. This collision avoidance mechanism is part 
of a detailed process requiring certain criteria to be met in order for a frame (a Layer 2 
digital transmission unit) to be transmitted across the medium. In the case of WLAN tech-
nology, this medium is the air, using RFs. The IEEE 802.11 standard requires all service set 
types to support the DCF mode of operation.
To avoid collisions, the devices are required to
■
■
Detect the RF energy of other devices transmitting, a technique known as Clear Chan-
nel Assessment (CCA), which is the physical carrier sense.
■
■
Announce how much time is required for the frame exchange to occur, allowing other 
stations to read the duration field and set their Network Allocation Vector (NAV), 
which is the virtual carrier sense.
■
■
Wait for a predetermined period of time between frames, a technique known as inter-
frame spacing.
■
■
Back off and retry if the medium is busy, a technique known as the random backoff 
timer via the contention window.
In short, these devices are reserving the medium so that transmissions can take  
place and avoid collisions. Figure 7.2 illustrates WLAN devices using CSMA/CA for an 
access method.

 The 802.11 standard also specifies two other access methods used 
with wireless networking.  Point coordination function (PCF) mode is a 
contention-free mode that works by polling stations and giving them an 
opportunity to send information without contending with other devices. 
PCF mode was optional and never implemented by any manufacturers. 
The IEEE 802.11-2016 standard states, “The PCF mechanism is obsolete. 
Consequently, this subclause might be removed in a later revision of 
the standard.” Another access method,  Hybrid coordination function  
(HCF) mode, was introduced with 802.11e for quality of service (QoS) 
technology.  
 Effects of Half-Duplex on Wireless Throughput 
 As discussed in Chapter  3  , “Infrastructure and Client Devices Used with Wireless 
Networking,” WLANs use half-duplex communication. To review,  half-duplex in com-
puter terminology is defi ned as two-way communication that occurs in only one direction 
at a time. Communication only one way at a time means less data throughput for the 
connected device(s). Half-duplex communication is part of the reason why in WLANs 
the amount of data being transferred is sometimes less than half of the advertised data 
rate; collisions and additional overhead are other factors to consider. An 802.11b/g/n 
device may only get 95 Mbps or less data transfer even though this technology is rated 
at 195 Mbps, assuming a 3×3:3 multiple input/multiple output (MIMO) 802.11n access 
point using a 20 MHz–wide channel. On a good day, devices will also average less than 
half of the advertised data rates due to the associated overhead and the use of half-duplex 
shared medium technology. 

Network Access Methods 
267  
Figure 7.3 shows the half-duplex communication method and some of the effect it has 
on throughput. The data rate in this example is 450 Mbps, but the throughput is less than 
half of that, about 225 Mbps. The newest IEEE standards-based technology, 802.11ac, 
uses MIMO technology and has a potential maximum signaling rate of up to 6933.3 
Mbps. However, many of the client devices available today are capable of a maximum  
of about 450–866.7 Mbps. The actual throughput can be much less than the advertised 
signaling rate.

Narrowband vs. Spread-Spectrum Communication
Narrowband and spread-spectrum are two examples of how devices can communicate 
using RF.
One example of narrowband communication is an FM radio station. FM radio stations 
use licensed frequency ranges that are tuned to a specific RF in the FM band. A radio sta-
tion can transmit a signal at a high power of tens of thousands of watts in a very narrow 
frequency. Depending on the conditions, a receiver can hear the station for tens or even 
possibly hundreds of miles.
Figure 7.4 shows the high amount of output power over a narrowband frequency of a 
potential FM radio station.
In contrast, spread-spectrum technology uses low power over a wider range of fre-
quency. Figure 7.5 illustrates how a spread spectrum–capable access point uses low power 
over a wide frequency range.

 Spread-spectrum communication is similar to what happens when the same audience 
breaks out into small groups in which each member is communicating only with other 
members of that group. These groups of individuals will be speaking at a much lower 
volume without the help of a high-power microphone, and the conversation volume will 
not exceed the area in which this group is contained. 
 Spread-Spectrum Technology 
 Two types of  spread-spectrum technology were specifi ed in the original IEEE 802.11 
WLAN standard ratifi ed in 1997: 
 
■
 Frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) 
 
■
 Direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) 
 These spread-spectrum technologies communicate in the 2.4 GHz industrial, scientifi c, 
and medical (ISM) frequency range. There are advantages and disadvantages to each of 
these spread-spectrum types. 
 Spread-spectrum technologies take the digital information generated by a computer 
(ones and zeros) and, through the use of modulation technologies, send it across the air 
between devices using RF. 
 In order for devices to communicate effectively and understand one another, they 
must be using the same spread-spectrum and modulation technology. This would be 
analogous to two people trying to talk with each other. If the two people don’t know the 
same language, they will not be able to understand each other and a conversation could 
not take place. 
 Frequency-Hopping Spread Spectrum 
 Frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) is used in a variety of devices in computer 
technology and communications. FHSS was used by many early adopters of wireless net-
working, including computers, barcode scanners, and other handheld or portable devices. 
Although defi ned in the original IEEE 802.11 standard, this technology is considered 
obsolete in IEEE 802.11 wireless networking. However, FHSS is still used in devices such 
as cordless telephones and IEEE 802.15 wireless personal area networks (WPANs), includ-
ing Bluetooth mice, cameras, phones, and wireless headsets. 
 
 FHSS is now considered obsolete with respect to 802.11 wireless 
networking and has formally been removed from the newest version of 
the standard (IEEE 802.11-2016). However, it is important to understand 
that some other wireless technologies still use FHSS as a communication 
mechanism and may cause interference with WLAN devices that use the 
same 2.4–2.5 GHz ISM frequency band.

Chapter 7 ■ Modulation Technology for Wireless Networking
 802.11 Direct-Sequence Spread Spectrum 
Direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) is a spread-spectrum technology used with 
WLANs and defi ned by the original IEEE 802.11 standard. DSSS supports data rates of 
1 and 2 Mbps and is considered very slow by today’s computer networking requirements. 
 DSSS uses special techniques to transmit digital data (ones and zeros) across the air 
using RF. This is accomplished by modulating or modifying the RF characteristics, such 
as phase, amplitude, and frequency (see Chapter  4 , “Radio Frequency Fundamentals for 
Wireless Networking”). 
 In addition to modulation, DSSS uses technology known as a  spreading code to provide 
redundancy of the digital data as it traverses through the air. The spreading code transmits 
information on multiple  subcarriers , and the redundancy helps the receiver detect transmis-
sion errors due to interference. Subcarriers are smaller segments of the RF channel that is 
in use. This spreading of information across the 22 MHz–wide RF channel is what helps 
makes DSSS resilient to interference. This spreading code technology allows the receiver 
to determine if a single bit of digital data (symbol) received is a binary 0 or binary 1. 
Depending on the data rate, the transmitter and receiver understand the spreading code in 
use and therefore are able to communicate. 
 An example of a coding technique is Barker code. Barker code is used as the spreading 
code for DSSS at the data rates of 1 and 2 Mbps. IEEE 802.11 WLANs can use this 11 
“chip” spreading code for communications. Each digital data bit (binary 1 or 0) is com-
bined with the set Barker code through what is called an  exclusive OR (XOR) process. 
XOR is a way of combining binary data bits in digital electronics. The result then spreads 
the binary 0 or 1 over a 22 MHz–wide channel, helping to make it resilient to RF interfer-
ence. Since both the transmitter and receiver understand the same code, they would be able 
to determine the information that was sent across the air. 
 DSSS operates within a range of RF frequency also known as a  channel . The channel 
is defi ned by its center frequency; that is, Channel 1 is 2.412 GHz on center, Channel 2 is 
2.417 GHz on center, and so on. Each channel in the 2.4 GHz ISM band is separated by 
5 MHz on center. Unlike narrowband communication, which operates on a single narrow 
frequency, a DSSS channel is 22 MHz wide and is one of 14 channels in the 2.4 GHz to 
2.5 GHz ISM band. The country and location of the device will determine which of the 
14 channels are available for use in that specifi c area. 
 Figure  7.6 shows that channel 6 is 22 MHz wide in the ISM unlicensed RF band. 
 
 FHSS and DSSS both operate in the same frequency range. If devices that 
use both technologies are occupying the same physical area, the devices 
may encounter some interference. Therefore, RF interference may occur 
from either IEEE 802.11 WLAN devices using the same channel or non-IEEE 
802.11 WLAN devices that are using the same RF channel. This includes 
anything wireless that does not adhere to the IEEE 802.11 protocol rules 
but is operating in the same frequency range, such as 2.4 GHz wireless 
cameras, 2-way radios or radio monitors, and even microwave ovens.

802.11b High Rate/Direct-Sequence Spread Spectrum
High rate/direct-sequence spread spectrum (HR/DSSS) was defined in the IEEE 802.11b 
amendment to the IEEE 802.11 standard. HR/DSSS (802.11b) introduced higher data rates 
of 5.5 and 11 Mbps. At the time the amendment was released, because of the higher data 
rates this technology helped fuel the acceleration of IEEE standards based on WLAN tech-
nology. The desire for 802.11 technology grew as the availability became greater and the 
cost decreased.
Like DSSS, HR/DSSS uses one of fourteen 22 MHz–wide channels to transmit and 
receive digital computer data. The main difference between these two technologies is that 
HR/DSSS supports higher data rates of 5.5 Mbps and 11 Mbps.
HR/DSSS (802.11b) also uses a different spreading code or an encoding technique from 
DSSS. HR/DSSS uses complementary code keying (CCK) for transmitting data at 5.5 and 
11 Mbps. The detailed operation of CCK is beyond the scope of this book.
IEEE 802.11 DSSS and HR/DSSS Channels
DSSS and HR/DSSS operate in the 2.4 GHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) license 
free band. This band has 14 available channels. Depending on the country and location, all 
14 channels may not be available. Table 7.1 shows the 14 available channels in the 2.4 GHz 
ISM band for a few different countries.

Of these 14 channels, mathematically there are only 3 adjacent nonoverlapping channels, 
with the exception of channel 14. According to the IEEE 802.11-2016 standard, “Channel 
14 shall be designated specifically for operation in Japan.” Channel 14 is separated by 
12 MHz on center from Channel 13, whereas Channels 1–13 are separated by 5 MHz on 
center of each channel. There are 3 MHz of separation where the RF of one channel ends 
and the next adjacent nonoverlapping channel begins. For example, Channel 1 and Channel 
6 are adjacent nonoverlapping channels. Channel 1 ends at 2.423 GHz, and Channel 6 
begins at 2.426 GHz. Mathematically this is a separation of 3 MHz. This means that three 
access points can be co-located in the same physical space without overlapping channel 
interference. However, there is still theoretically a small amount of overlapping RF or har-
monics between these two channels. This small level of overlap is not large enough to cause 
any real interference issues because the signal becomes weaker as it spreads further away 
from the channel’s center frequency. Figure 7.8 illustrates 3 of the first 14 channels that do 
not overlap in the 2.4 GHz ISM band.

Each DSSS channel is 22 MHz wide. Using spread-spectrum technology, a 22 MHz–
wide channel helps add resiliency to interference for data transmissions and gives the 
capability to move large amounts of data with a small amount of RF power. Some early 
IEEE 802.11 devices included barcode scanners, and they worked with limited battery life. 
Using a spreading technology instead of narrowband technology (which would be higher 
RF transmit power) helped to conserve battery life and increased the use of IEEE 802.11 
devices as a whole.
IEEE 802.11g Extended Rate Physical
The IEEE 802.11g amendment was released in 2003 and introduced technology that 
allowed for higher data rates for devices and operation in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. The 
objective of this amendment was to allow for these higher data rates (up to 54 Mbps) 
using orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) and still maintain backward

compatibility with existing 802.11b technology and devices. This technology, known 
as Extended Rate Physical (ERP), builds on the data rates of 1, 2 Mbps DSSS (802.11) 
and 5.5, 11 Mbps HR/DSSS (802.11b). The 802.11g amendment introduced several 
compatibility operation modes:
■
■
ERP-DSSS
■
■
ERP-CCK
■
■
ERP-DSSS/CCK
■
■
ERP-OFDM
The 802.11g amendment required support for ERP-DSSS/CCK and ERP-OFDM. This 
allowed for both the 802.11b data rates of 1, 2, 5.5, and 11 Mbps and the newer OFDM 
data rates of 6, 9,12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 54 Mbps. Manufacturers of WLAN equipment 
implement this in various ways. In a graphical user interface, there may be a drop-down 
menu that allows a user to select a specific operation mode, such as mixed mode, b/g mode, 
b-only mode, and so on. Another possibility is to select the individual data rates using radio 
buttons. For manufacturers that provide a command-line interface (CLI) option, the appro-
priate commands would need to be executed in order to enable or disable the desired data 
rates. Figure 7.9 illustrates an example of how manufacturers allow a user to select the ERP 
operation mode on an access point.

 IEEE 802.11n High Throughput 
 The IEEE 802.11n amendment was ratifi ed in September 2009. This high throughput (HT) 
Physical layer (PHY) technology is based on the OFDM (PHY) in Clause 17 (802.11a) 
PHY. 802.11n HT allows extensibility of up to four spatial streams, using a channel width 
of 20 MHz. Also, transmission using one to four spatial streams is defi ned for operation 
in 20/40 MHz channel width mode. This technology is capable of supporting data rates 
up to 600 Mbps using four spatial streams with a 20/40 MHz channel. IEEE 802.11n HT 
provides features that can support a throughput of 100 Mbps and greater. Other optional 
features on both the transmit and receive sides include but are not limited to the following: 
 
■
 HT No Protection (also known as  greenfield mode ) 
 
■
 Optional short guard interval (GI), 400 ns 
 
■
 Transmit beamforming (TxBF) 
 
■
 Space-time block coding (STBC) 
 The  802.11n amendment allows for operation in both the 2.4 GHz ISM and 5 GHz 
Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure (UNII) bands with either 20 MHz– or 
40 MHz–wide channels. Although 40 MHz–wide channels are allowed in the 2.4 GHz 
ISM band, best practices recommend against it. Using a 40 MHz channel in this band 
would only equate to a single channel without any channel overlap. 
 
 It is important to understand the difference between data rate and 
throughput. Data rates are what a station is capable of exchanging 
information, whereas throughput is the rate at which the information is 
actually moving. Data rate and throughput are compared in more detail in 
Chapter  6 , “Communication for Wireless Networking.” 
 IEEE 802.11a, 802.11g, 802.11n, and 
802.11ac OFDM 
 Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is used by the IEEE 802.11a 
(OFDM), IEEE 802.11g Extended Rate Physical Orthogonal Frequency-Division 
Multiplexing (ERP-OFDM), IEEE 802.11n High Throughput (HT-OFDM), and IEEE 
802.11ac Very High Throughput (VHT) amendments to the IEEE 802.11 standard. OFDM 
allows for much higher data rate transfers than DSSS and HR/DSSS, up to 54 Mbps for 
802.11a and 802.11g, potentially up to 600 Mbps for 802.11n, and theoretically up to 
6.933 Gbps for 802.11ac. 
 OFDM is a technology designed to transmit many signals simultaneously over one trans-
mission path in a shared medium and is used in wireless and other transmission systems. 

276 
Chapter 7  ■  Modulation Technology for Wireless Networking  
Every signal travels within its own unique frequency subcarrier (a separate signal carried on 
a main RF transmission). IEEE 802.11a and 802.11g OFDM distribute computer data over 
52 subcarriers equally spaced apart, and 4 of the 52 subcarriers do not carry data and are 
used as pilot channels. IEEE 802.11n/ac allows for 56 subcarriers of which 52 are usable 
for data with a 20 MHz–wide channel, and 114 subcarriers of which 108 are usable for 
data with a 40 MHz–wide channel. Having many subcarriers allows for high data rates in 
WLAN IEEE 802.11a and IEEE 802.11g devices. 802.11n/ac devices (HT-OFDM) may use 
a MIMO technology known as spatial multiplexing (SM), which uses several radio chains 
to transmit different pieces of the same information simultaneously, greatly increasing 
throughput. In addition to high data rates, OFDM helps provide resiliency to interference 
from other wireless devices.
IEEE 802.11a, 802.11g, 802.11n, and  
802.11ac OFDM Channels
OFDM functions in either the 2.4 GHz ISM or the 5 GHz UNII bands. The channel 
width is smaller than DSSS or HR/DSSS. The width of an OFDM channel is only 20 MHz 
compared to 22 MHz for DSSS. Figure 7.10 shows a representation of a 20 MHz–wide 
OFDM channel.

Like DSSS, when OFDM is used in the 2.4 GHz ISM band there are at most, in the same 
physical area, only three non-overlapping adjacent channels for use. This will limit the use 
of “bonded” channels (20/40 MHz–wide channels) in IEEE 802.11n (HT-OFDM) deploy-
ments that are located in the same RF physical area. In the 5 GHz UNII bands, the channel 
spacing is such that there is no overlap. The frequency range used will determine how many 
nonoverlapping channels are available for use. In the lower UNII band, 4 non-overlapping

channels are available. With the ratification of IEEE 802.11ac, the middle UNII band now 
has a possible16 nonoverlapping channels available. The upper UNII band now provides a 
possible 5 non-overlapping channels. All UNII band channels are 20 MHz wide and sepa-
rated by 20 MHz from the center frequencies of each channel. Certain regulatory domains, 
including the United States Federal Communication Commission (FCC) and the European 
Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), require the use of dynamic frequency selec-
tion (DFS) support for wireless devices such as access points that operate in the middle 
5 GHz (5.250 GHz–5.725 GHz) UNII band. DFS will allow an access point to change the 
RF channel it is operating on in order to avoid interfering with certain type of radar sys-
tems. Table 7.2 shows the 25 available channels, center frequency, and channel number in 
the 5 GHz UNII band. Also displayed is a single 5 GHz ISM channel that is available by 
some regulatory agencies for use with wireless networking.

 Some regulatory agencies allow the use of the 5.725–5.850 GHz band 
for wireless networking, including but not limited to the United States, 
Europe, Singapore, and China. This frequency range is specified in the 
IEEE 802.11-2016 standard for use with WLAN technology. The use of 
this frequency range is regulated separately with some similarities to 
the 2.4 GHz ISM band and allows for the use of more devices such as 
cordless telephones. 
 IEEE 802.11n/ac Multiple Input/Multiple 
Output Technology 
Multiple input/multiple output (MIMO) is a technology used by IEEE 802.11n and 
802.11ac devices. MIMO technology is capable of signaling rates up to 600 Mbps for 
802.11n devices and 6,933.3 Mbps (6.93 Gbps) for 802.11ac devices. MIMO provides 
users with a better overall experience for data, voice, and video communications with 
throughput faster than 802.11 a/g,  single input/single output (SISO) networks. 
 SISO is the most basic wireless antenna technology used in a WLAN system. One 
antenna is used at the transmitter to transmit data, and one antenna is used at the receiver 
to receive the data. Some SISO systems support a technology known as  diversity , which 
uses two antennas with a single radio. Diversity technology will help to lessen the effects 
of multipath, which is caused by refl ections. Diversity and multipath are discussed in more 
detail in Chapter  5 , “Antenna Technology for Wireless Networking.” Coverage is more 
predictable and consistent with MIMO networks because devices using this technology 
are able to utilize refl ected signals, which are a problem for wireless networks using other 
WLAN technologies. 
 MIMO also allows 802.11n/ac networks better throughput than DSSS or OFDM-based 
networks at the same distance. IEEE 802.11n MIMO-based networks offer backward 
compatibility with 802.11a/b/g networks and devices in both the 2.4 GHz ISM and the 
5 GHz UNII bands, allowing for deployments to continue using their existing hardware. 
IEEE 802.11ac MIMO-based networks offer backward compatibility with 802.11a/n

networks and devices because 802.11ac technology is designed to operate only in the 
5 GHz UNII band.
Some of the benefits of 802.11n/ac MIMO networks include throughput, reliability, and 
predictability:
■
■
More throughput than SISO technology
■
■
Enhanced file transfer and download speeds for large files
■
■
More reliable performance than SISO technology
■
■
Lower latency for mobile communications
■
■
More predictable coverage compared to SISO technology
■
■
More consistent coverage and throughput for mobile applications compared to SISO 
technology
Unlike IEEE 802.11b (HR/DSSS) and IEEE 802.11a/g (OFDM) access points, 
MIMO access points use multiple radios with multiple antennas. The multiple radio 
chains and some additional intelligence are what give 802.11n/ac MIMO access points 
the capability to process reflected signals. Since 802.11n MIMO works with both the 
2.4 GHz ISM and the 5 GHZ UNII bands, a dual-band IEEE 802.11n MIMO access 
point will have up to eight radio chains (four for 2.4 GHz and four for 5 GHz) and 
eight antennas (one for each radio) for data rates of up to 600 Mbps. Keep in mind 
that 802.11n MIMO technology is capable of up to four radio chains in a single band; 
however, until the release of 802.11ac technology, no enterprise equipment manu-
facturer produced such a device. Dual-band 802.11n/ac devices may provide 4×4:4 
technologies in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. 802.11ac devices are capable of up to eight 
radio chains in the 5 GHz band, but current devices support up to four radio chains. 
Figure 7.11 shows that MIMO uses multiple radio chains and multiple antennas to 
transmit and receive data.
802.11n/ac systems use MIMO technology. They have more receivers and are much 
more sensitive than the average 802.11a or 802.11g radio. The following techniques are 
what allow for better performance and much higher data rates up to 450 Mbps with  
3×3:3 IEEE 802.11n MIMO and up to 600 Mbps with 4×4:4 IEEE 802.11ac MIMO:

■
■
Transmit beamforming (TxBF)
■
■
Spatial multiplexing (SM)
■
■
Multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO)
802.11a/b/g networks are known as single input/single output (SISO) systems, which 
means that performance can degrade as a result of multipath, poor reception because of 
obstacles, and RF interference sources. 802.11n/ac MIMO networks can take advantage of 
multipath to help increase throughput at a given range, providing much higher throughput 
at the same range.

IEEE 802.11n/ac MIMO Channels
IEEE 802.11n MIMO networks can operate in both the 2.4 GHz ISM and 5 GHz UNII 
bands and are capable of either 20 or 20/40 MHz–wide channels. Even while 802.11n 
MIMO networks are operating in 20/40 MHz channel width mode, many frames such as 
beacon management frames are still transmitted with a 20 MHz channel width. The 20 
and 20/40 MHz channel widths are defined by the IEEE for the transmission of OFDM 
modulated data. As you would expect, wider channels mean more data can be transmit-
ted over the RF medium simultaneously. Therefore, wider channels allow higher data

throughput. Think of this like cars traveling on a two-lane or a four-lane highway. A 
20 MHz–wide channel can be looked at as the two-lane highway, and a 40 MHz–wide 
channel as the four-lane highway. More cars can pass through four lanes in the same 
amount of time than can pass through two lanes. Figure  7.12 illustrates this point. 
 f i g u r e   7.12    More lanes, more cars—wider channels, more data 
A 40 MHz wide channel is like moving from 2 to 4 lanes.
 The 20 MHz or 20/40 MHz channels can be used in either the 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz 
frequency ranges. Because of the limited amount of frequency space in the 2.4 GHz ISM 
band, there is only one 20/40 MHz–wide channel without any adjacent-channel overlap. 
Figure  7.13 shows a 40 MHz–wide channel as specifi ed in the 802.11 standard. 
 
 Although most enterprise-grade access points support bonded (20/40 
MHz–wide) channels, there are still some wireless client devices, both 
new and legacy, that do not support this technology. To achieve the higher 
data rates that IEEE 802.11n offers, both the client and the access point 
must support the newer technologies. If the wireless client device does 
not support the bonded channels, the access point will be able to adapt, 
allowing for coexistence.

Chapter 7  ■  Modulation Technology for Wireless Networking  
In addition to the 20 MHz or 20/40 MHz channel widths that are available with 
802.11n MIMO, 802.11ac allows for additional channel widths, 80 MHz– and 160 
MHz–wide channels in the 5 GHZ UNII band. Although using wider channels will allow 
for much higher data rates and throughput, the use of such channels should be carefully 
considered. Using wider channels will lessen the number of available non-overlapping chan-
nels and will limit the types of networks that will be able to utilize the wider channel plan 
deployments. In many cases, higher-density deployment scenarios such as stadium venues 
will benefit from more channels with smaller 20 MHz channel widths. Home and small 
office deployments may benefit from using the wider 80 MHz or 160 MHz channel widths.
Co-location of IEEE 802.11b HR/DSSS and  
IEEE 802.11a/g/n OFDM Systems
Now we will look at the co-location of different 802.11a/b/g/n/ac devices. One thing to 
understand is that many consider 802.11b systems to be legacy devices that are on the 
verge of becoming obsolete. However, this may not be the case in all installations. Mostly 
because of legacy hardware and depending on the type of WLAN installation (typically 
public guest networks and the retail environment), support for 802.11b networks may still 
be required. Additionally, the latest revision of the 802.11 standard (IEEE 802.11-2016) 
still addresses this technology, and therefore it is important to understand the implications 
of co-location of 802.11b devices.
All IEEE-based WLANs can be co-located—that is, they can function in the same 
RF space. The technologies that the devices use determine how well they work together. 
Both HR/DSSS (802.11b) and ERP-OFDM (802.11g/n) networks operate in the 2.4 GHz 
frequency range ISM band. 802.11g-compliant devices are backward compatible with 
802.11b-compliant devices. However, this backward compatibility comes at a price: 
reduced data throughput. Because of protection mechanisms, ERP-OFDM devices used 
in 802.11g/n will suffer in performance when an HR/DSSS device is in the same radio or 
hearing range of the ERP-OFDM device.
HR/DSSS and ERP-OFDM systems have many common features:
■
■
Both operate in the 2.4 GHz ISM band.
■
■
Both have three nonoverlapping channels.
■
■
Both are subject to interference from other devices operating in the same frequency 
range.
HR/DSSS and ERP-OFDM (802.11b-compliant and 802.11g/n-compliant) devices 
are backward compatible. ERP-OFDM is rated at 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 54 Mbps. 
Actual throughput in an environment relatively free of interference will be about 15 to 
24 Mbps. If a DSSS or HR/DSSS device is introduced in the radio range of the ERP-OFDM 
device, the throughput will decrease significantly because of protection mechanisms. How 
much of an impact this makes depends on many factors in the environment. Typically, the 
decrease in throughput is about 25 percent to 30 percent. It is important to understand 
that this is not just limited to a single wireless access point or the basic service area. If an 

IEEE 802.11a, 802.11g, 802.11n, and 802.11ac OFDM 
283  
802.11g/n access point can “hear” another 802.11g/n access point on the same RF channel 
that is in ERP protection mode, then that access point will also enter a protection mode 
state. This is known as what some call the ripple effect. The same holds true for access 
points that support 802.11n technology in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. With the higher data 
rates of potentially up to 600 Mbps using a 4×4:4 MIMO system, any 802.11b device 
introduced into the basic service set will have an adverse effect on the amount of data 
throughput for the 802.11n network.
Just as co-location of 802.11b/g/n EPR-OFDM systems needs to be taken into consid-
eration, the same holds true with 802.11a/n/ac OFDM systems. The real difference is the 
frequency band that 802.11a/n/ac systems operate in. IEEE 802.11 devices operate in the 
5 GHz UNII band. The IEEE 802.11n High Throughput (HT) amendment to the standard 
addresses different protection mechanisms. This is because 802.11n devices can operate in 
both the 2.4 GHz ISM and 5 GHZ UNII bands. Therefore, an 802.11n/ac access point will 
need to allow 802.11a/n devices to utilize the network along with 802.11ac devices, both 
types in the 5 GHz UNII band.
802.11a OFDM, 802.11n HT-OFDM, and 802.11ac VHT systems have several common 
features:
■
■
All operate in the 5 GHz UNII band.
■
■
They have up to 25 nonoverlapping channels (depending on the regulatory agency and 
whether 802.11ac is supported).
■
■
All are subject to interference from other devices operating in the same frequency range.
802.11n HT networks offer various protection mechanisms to ensure interoperability 
and co-location.
OFDM, HT-OFDM, and VHT (802.11n/ac-compliant and 802.11a-compliant) devices 
are backward compatible. OFDM is rated at 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 54 Mbps. Actual 
throughput in an environment relatively free of interference may be a little higher than an 
802.11g/n environment, about 18 to 26 Mbps. Networks that operate in the 5 GHz UNII 
band are not subject to co-location issues with DSSS or HR/DSSS, because they operate 
in different frequency ranges. The 802.11n amendment introduced a new concept called 
the modulation and coding scheme (MCS). This is a different way to represent the data 
rates that are available with 802.11n technology. Previously, the IEEE 802.11 standard 
and amendments specified data rates as individual values—1 Mbps, 2 Mbps, 5.5 Mbps, 
and 11 Mbps in IEEE 802.11b technology, for example. The IEEE 802.11n amendment to 
the standard refers to this as the modulation and coding scheme (MCS). This is because 
depending on the technology enabled or used, a single MCS may support multiple data 
rates. For example, an MCS Index 7 will support either 65.0 Mbps or 72.2 Mbps, depend-
ing on whether short guard interval is enabled. The same is true with 802.11 ac devices.
802.11n devices have a maximum data rate or MCS of up to 600 Mbps. Just as devices 
that operate in the 2.4 GHz ISM band must be able to coexist, devices that operate in the 
5 GHz band must be able to coexist as well. Co-location of 802.11a/n/ac devices is possible 
through the use of additional protection mechanisms. (ERP and HT protection mechanisms 
will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 6.) Figure 7.14 illustrates co-location of various 
802.11 technologies.

Adjacent-Channel and Co-channel Interference
Adjacent-channel and co-channel interference (two or more RF signals interacting with 
each other and causing a degradation of performance) are concerns in the design, devel-
opment, and deployment of IEEE 802.11-based wireless networks. This is because the 
wireless devices are contending to use the medium rather than just being seen as RF noise 
to each other. These types of interference will have an impact on the amount of actual 
throughput between devices over a wireless network. The definition of adjacent-channel 
interference is when two or more access point radios are providing RF coverage to the 
same physical area using overlapping frequencies, such as Channel 1 and Channel 3. 
Co-channel interference is when two or more independently coordinated access point 
radios are providing RF coverage to the same physical area using the same 802.11 chan-
nel, such as Channel 1 and Channel 1. The 2.4 GHz ISM band has only three nonover­
lapping channels. Careful channel planning is required when designing or implementing  
a wireless network. This type of planning will minimize issues such as poor throughput 
as a result of adjacent-channel and co-channel interference. Channel planning involves 
designing wireless networks so that overlapping RF cells are on different (nonoverlapping) 
channels—for example, channels 1, 6, and 11 in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. This will help 
optimize performance and minimize degradation of throughput because of adjacent-­
channel and co-channel interference.
With the advancements in 802.11 technologies, channel planning is more “automated” 
by the use of spectrum management technology and the IEEE 802.11 standard. It is still 
important, however, to understand the concept of channel planning. RF energy propa-
gates in several directions simultaneously. A well-designed wireless network will account

285  
for a three-dimensional propagation. In other words, in a three-story building, the RF 
from an access point on the second floor building may pass through to the first and third 
floors; therefore, interference could be an issue if the network is not planned properly.

2.4 GHz ISM band.

Chanalyzer. The “Data” access point is on channel 1, and the “Guest” access point is on

WLAN/WPAN Coexistence
Wireless personal networks (WPANs) typically consist of portable devices such as per-
sonal digital assistants (PDAs), cell phones, headsets, computer keyboards, mice, and 
now tablet devices. In Chapter 4, you saw how the performance of IEEE 802.11 WLANs 
can be affected when co-located with WPAN devices. The IEEE 802.15 standard 
addresses WPANs and includes Bluetooth and Zigbee networks. Bluetooth is one of the 
most popular WPAN network technologies and operates in the 2.4 GHz ISM band using 
FHSS technology.

286 
Chapter 7  ■  Modulation Technology for Wireless Networking  
Early Bluetooth devices could cause significant interference while operating in close 
proximity to IEEE 802.11 WLANs. Bluetooth was designed to hop at a rate of 1,600 times 
per second across the entire 2.4 GHz band, potentially causing significant interference 
with 802.11 wireless networks. Bluetooth-capable devices now use adaptive frequency hop-
ping (AFH) and thus are less likely to interfere with IEEE 802.11 wireless networks, even 
though they still operate in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. Devices that use AFH will try to avoid 
using the same frequencies, decreasing the chance of interference. Since these devices oper-
ate at low power, most WPANs communicate in small, close-range, peer-to-peer networks.
Taking Adjacent-Channel and Co-Channel Interference into Consideration 
When Planning a New Wireless Network
As a wireless network engineer, you are tasked with deploying a new wireless network in 
a multitenant building. The area to be covered is approximately 50,000 square feet.
Your first task, prior to the procurement and deployment of the wireless network, should 
be to perform a spectrum analysis and site survey. This will help determine the best  
frequency and channels to be used in the new deployment.
A survey reveals that tenants on the floors above and below where the new deployment 
is to be installed are also using IEEE 802.11b/g/n networks, with many access points on 
channels across the entire 2.4 GHz ISM band. A situation such as this may make the 
deployment difficult. There is an increased possibility of adjacent-channel and  
co-channel interference.
Upon further evaluation, it is determined that the lower band of the 5 GHz UNII band 
is not being utilized to any large extent. Since this is a new deployment, you have the 
opportunity to purchase equipment that will utilize the 5 GHz UNII band as well as the 
2.4 GHz ISM band. The following are some of the questions that need to be evaluated:
■
■
Are any devices limited to 802.11b/g/n capability only?
■
■
Does the network require backward compatibility to 802.11b/g/n?
■
■
Does the network need to support guest access?
■
■
What impact would a network using only 5 GHz 802.11a/n/ac have on the business?
■
■
Is it possible to utilize both frequency bands in this deployment to maximize  
throughput while limiting interference?
■
■
Is a single channel architecture (SCA) technology system that will allow for backward 
compatibility to existing wireless client devices a possible solution?
These are just some questions that need to be considered prior to making any final  
decisions on the network to be installed and the equipment to be purchased.

Summary
In this chapter, we looked at access methods used to get data from one device to another 
when multiple users share the medium. These access methods consist of collision avoidance 
and collision detection:
■
■
CSMA/CD—Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection
■
■
CSMA/CA—Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance
WLANs have no way of detecting collisions, so they must use collision avoidance 
(CSMA/CA). WLANs use half-duplex communication, which limits the communication for 
a data transfer.
This chapter also looked at the spread-spectrum and Physical layer (PHY) technolo-
gies used with WLANs and the differences among them. The IEEE standard and various 
amendments use different spread-spectrum and PHY technologies and unlicensed radio 
spectrum allowing for data rates up to 6,933.3 Mbps. These Physical layer (PHY) technolo-
gies include:
■
■
DSSS—For data rates of 1 and 2 Mbps
■
■
HR/DSSS—For data rates of 5.5 and 11 Mbps
■
■
OFDM—For data rates up to 54 Mbps
■
■
HT-OFDM—For data rates of up to 600 Mbps
■
■
VHT-OFDM—For a theoretical maximum of up to 6,933.3 Mbps
Even though FHSS is now an obsolete technology for WLANs, it is still important to 
understand some of the basics of this technology since it is still in use today in many indus-
tries in various types of wireless technologies, including IEEE 802.15 personal area net-
working (PAN), Bluetooth, and cordless telephones.
We looked at the different channel sets used with 802.11 wireless networks and some of 
the co-location considerations.
Some of the Physical layer technologies discussed in this chapter are more susceptible to 
interference than others. This can make installations in some industries challenging. We also 
looked at co-location of HR/DSSS and ERP-OFDM systems and some of the challenges it 
can pose. Finally, this chapter discussed the coexistence of WPANs and WLANs and the vari-
ous devices and technology that can cause interference when working in the same RF space.

Security in many ways means defining your level of acceptable 
risk and protecting yourself to at least that level. This can vary 
greatly based on industry, budget, and the types and ages of 
devices supported. Security is a very important part of wireless networking, just as it is in 
any other type of computer networking or information technology. When the IEEE 802.11 
standard was first ratified back in 1997, it addressed a basic security concept called Wired 
Equivalent Privacy (WEP). However, this security solution was considered weak and was 
easily compromised early on. In this chapter, we will look at some of what are considered 
legacy wireless LAN (WLAN) security technologies used with standards-based wireless 
networking, including the following:
■
■
Service set identifier (SSID) hiding
■
■
Media access control (MAC) address filtering
■
■
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)
We will also take a look at some of the vulnerabilities of these legacy technologies and why 
they should not be used for securing a WLAN. You will learn about some of the newer 
security methods available based on the IEEE 802.11i amendment and included in the IEEE 
802.11-2016 standard. These security methods are also part of the Wi-Fi Alliance certifica-
tions, WPA and WPA 2.0. We will explore small office/home office (SOHO) security solu-
tions and enterprise-level security solutions. These include the following:
■
■
Preshared key/passphrase
■
■
User-based authentication
■
■
IEEE 802.1X/EAP
■
■
Remote Access Dial-In User Service (RADIUS)
■
■
Authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA)
In Chapter 2, “Wireless Local Area Networking, Standards, and Certifications,” we dis-
cussed some of the certifications available from the Wi-Fi Alliance that pertain to WLAN 
security. This chapter will explore further some of the concepts of passphrase, preshared 
key, and 802.1X/EAP. Also explained will be encryption methods such as Temporal Key 
Integrity Protocol (TKIP) and Cipher-Block Chaining Message Authentication Code 
Protocol (CCMP), which are ways to scramble computer data and are used with WLANs.
One thing that is often overlooked is security from a remote location, such as a wireless 
hotspot. In this chapter, you will learn about virtual private networking (VPN) solutions 
and how they can be used to secure wireless connections for users connecting to the cor-
porate network from a remote wireless network. Wireless intrusion prevention systems

(WIPS) are also part of the technology used in today’s WLAN world. If a WIPS is imple-
mented correctly, it can provide a wealth of information as well as protection for your 
network infrastructure and wireless devices. Finally, we will look at basic functions and 
implementation best practices for role-based access control (RBAC), captive portals, and 
network management and monitoring systems.
Introducing IEEE 802.11 Wireless 
LAN Security
The importance of computer network security is often underestimated, and WLAN 
security is no different. “I don’t understand why I need to secure my access point.” “I 
don’t have anything on my computer that would be of interest to anyone else.” “I tried to 
enable security on my wireless but couldn’t get it to work, so I just turned it off.” These 
are some of the common excuses many technical support engineers or consultants heard 
from people when it came to wireless security. In the early days of IEEE 802.11 wireless 
networking, security was weak. This led to much vulnerability, which in turn made wire-
less networking not a very attractive solution for many enterprise deployments, especially 
those concerned about security.
With the improvements in standards-based WLAN security, partly thanks to the Wi-Fi 
Alliance certifications as well as the IEEE 802.11i amendment to the standard, WLANs 
have become a major part of many enterprise networks in all industries and businesses. 
Because wireless networks are inherently unbounded, it is possible to have more security 
protecting wireless communication than what is used to secure most wired LANs. This is 
the case in many WLAN implementations.

Computer networks have always been the target of various types of intrusion techniques. 
Wireless networks are no different—in fact, wireless networks are more vulnerable to 
intrusion because the communication is not bounded by any physical media, such as an 
Ethernet cable. This key vulnerability in wireless networking is the use of the air, a shared 
unbounded medium. The level of security applied to a wireless network will depend on the 
following factors:
■
■
What are you trying to protect?
■
■
What are you trying to prevent?
There are many security concerns related to wireless networking. Some of these concerns 
arise because WLANs use radio frequency (RF) for communication and the open air as the

medium. Others are a threat to either wired or wireless networks. The following list identi-
fies some of these concerns and threats:

rity solutions such as wireless intrusion prevention systems (WIPS) are available to help 
discover and mitigate some of them. Figure 8.1 illustrates some of the vulnerabilities with

Locking the Door of Your Automobile
Let’s take a quick look at an analogy that may make network security easier to under-
stand. You need to run some errands on a Saturday afternoon and decide to go to the 
market to pick up some supplies. When you arrive at your destination, you leave your 
automobile but do not lock the door. Who could potentially enter your vehicle? The 

IEEE 802.11 Standard Security 
297  
answer is anybody who attempts to open the door. Locking the door of your vehicle will 
prevent the casual intruder from being able to enter through the door. Therefore, the lock 
on your door is one layer of security that could be used to prevent a potential intruder 
from entering your vehicle.
So, with the door locked, now who could potentially get into your vehicle? The answer 
is two different individuals: first, you (because you have the key to the door); second, a 
potential intruder who could compromise the lock on the door. As you can see, locking 
the door provides a layer of security and will prevent the casual intruder from entering 
your vehicle, but it will not prevent a determined intruder.
Now let’s add a second layer of security. In addition to locking the door you set an alarm 
on your vehicle. You now have two layers of security: the door lock and the alarm. For 
an intruder to gain access to your vehicle, they would now need to have the knowledge 
and the ability to overcome two layers of security. First, they would need the ability to 
compromise the lock on the door, and then they would need the knowledge to disable the 
alarm, both without being noticed. The number of potential intruders has decreased sig-
nificantly, from those who can just open the unlocked door to those who have the knowl-
edge to not only compromise the door lock but also disable the alarm.
IEEE 802.11 Standard Security
Even though WLAN security has greatly increased over the years, it is important to under-
stand the original IEEE 802.11 standard as it relates to WLAN security. It is important to 
be aware of some of the basics or building blocks prior to getting into more sophisticated 
areas of security. From a security viewpoint, the original standard addressed two areas of 
security: authentication and data privacy. Both of these are common components of com-
puter network security. In computer networking, authentication is defined as a way of con-
firming an identity; basically, it determines that you are who you say you are. Data privacy 
is ensuring that information or data is understandable only by the individuals or groups 
it is intended for, the sender and the intended receiver.
One way many people may think of authentication is to supply a username and 
password in order to log onto a computer. Another would be to supply the appropriate 
logon before performing an activity like Internet banking. To review from Chapter 6, 
“Communication for Wireless Networking,” the original IEEE 802.11 standard 
addresses two types of authentication: IEEE 802.11 open system authentication and 
IEEE 802.11 shared-key authentication. IEEE 802.11 authentication is performed by 
the WLAN protocol and, except for IEEE 802.11 shared-key authentication, does not 
require user intervention. It is important not to confuse IEEE 802.11 shared-key authen-
tication with preshared-key authentication, as defined in the IEEE 802.11i amendment 
to the standard.

298 
Chapter 8  ■  Security Fundamentals for Wireless Networking  
IEEE 802.11 Open System Authentication
To review from Chapter 6, open system authentication is a two-step process, a two-frame 
exchange, and is one of the simplest ways to provide an authentication process. IEEE 802.11 
open system authentication cannot fail except for circumstances such as a network adapter 
having a bad device driver. This authentication is what is known as a null authentication, 
which for the most part means it doesn’t really authenticate anything at all. For example, if a 
wireless client device such as a notebook computer wants to join the wireless network, it will 
“ask” the access point if it can authenticate, and the access point will always accept.
IEEE 802.11 Shared-Key Authentication
Also discussed in Chapter 6, IEEE 802.11 shared-key authentication is a four-step pro-
cess, not to be confused with IEEE 802.11i, WPA, or WPA2 personal mode, which uses a 
256-bit preshared key for authentication. The main difference between IEEE 802.11 open 
system and IEEE 802.11 shared-key authentication is that with shared-key authentication, 
WEP is required in order for it to function correctly. This is because IEEE 802.11 shared-
key authentication uses WEP for both 802.11 authentication and for data payload encryp-
tion. But WEP is not secure, so it makes shared-key authentication weak and vulnerable to 
intrusion. WEP was intended only to protect wireless network users against casual eaves-
dropping and for authentication that is used with shared key.
Early Wireless LAN Security Methods
Because of the way security was defined in the original IEEE 802.11 standard, manufactur-
ers of WLAN equipment were able to design different ways a user could secure a WLAN. 
But even though these methods looked good on paper, they did not do much to provide a 
good security solution. This section discusses the following common WLAN security meth-
ods and legacy security solutions:
■
■
Service set identifier (SSID) hiding (closed network)
■
■
Media access control (MAC) address filtering
■
■
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)
If some of these are considered legacy WLAN security methods, why is it important to 
discuss them? You need to understand these solutions because there are still some wireless 
network implementations that may use some or all of them as part of a wireless security 
solution. Because standards-based WLAN technology has been around for two decades, 
many early adopters had no choice but to use these security techniques. Over the years, 
WLAN security has improved tremendously; however, it is a fact that some of these early 
adopters still have legacy wireless devices that will not support the latest and greatest secu-
rity technology, such as WPA2. Therefore, these solutions may still currently play a role in 
the wireless network infrastructure.

Early Wireless LAN Security Methods 
299  
The Service Set Identifier
As you’ll recall from Chapter 6, the service set identifier (SSID) is a logical name for the 
wireless network and was designed to be used for wireless device segmentation. The SSID 
allows WLAN-capable devices to identify and connect to a WLAN using the discovery 
phase, which includes the passive and active scanning processes. There are a couple of 
ways this connection can be accomplished. Passive scanning occurs when the wireless cli-
ent device listens for beacons frames. The SSID is specified in a beacon frame in the SSID 
information element. As discussed in Chapter 6, the beacon frame is an advertisement of 
the wireless network. The beacon frame by default is set to broadcast at about 10 times 
a second. The beacon frame will advertise the SSID of the wireless network during this 
interval.
You can specify that the SSID of the WLAN be joined in the wireless client software 
utility of the connecting wireless device. In this case, a wireless client will send a probe 
request frame with the intent of joining that particular network. The IEEE 802.11 stan-
dard requires access points to respond to all probe requests that have a matching SSID 
or what is known as a wildcard SSID (an SSID with a value of 0), also referred to as a 
null SSID. A wildcard SSID is used when a client device does not specify the SSID in 
the wireless client software utility. If a wireless client device is scanning or looking for 
a wireless network to join, it will see the wireless network because the beacon frame is 
broadcasting the SSID. Most manufacturers of SOHO and enterprise access points pro-
vide the option not to broadcast the SSID in beacon frames. This is commonly known as 
disabling the SSID broadcast, SSID hiding, or a closed network, and is discussed in the 
next section.
SSID Hiding
Manufacturers of IEEE 802.11 WLAN equipment provide the capability to disable SSID 
broadcasting, as shown in Figure 8.2. Another term for this process is SSID hiding. 
SSID hiding allows a user to remove the SSID that would normally appear in broadcast 
beacon frames. If the SSID is not being broadcast, the wireless network will not be seen 
by the wireless client devices that do not have that wireless network’s SSID specified in 
their client software utility. If somebody knows the SSID, they would be able to enter 
it into their wireless client device software and then be able to connect to the wireless 
network.
In the early days of wireless networking, people would hide the SSID, believing that 
would secure the network because it was not visible to devices passively scanning for a  
network to join. This was a misconception, because even though the SSID is not being 
broadcast in these beacon frames, it can still be identified in other wireless frames, such  
as the probe request frames, probe response frames, association request frames, and  
re-association request frames. This means that anyone with a wireless scanning utility, such 
as a packet analyzer, would be able to determine the SSID of a wireless network by moni-
toring the frames that are sent through the air. Therefore, hiding the SSID should not be 
used as a way to secure a wireless network.

Hiding the SSID is sometimes used to prevent the wireless network from being seen by 
those who should not be connecting to it. Many organizations will hide the SSIDs of all the 
wireless networks except for the open guest network. This is sometimes done to help reduce 
unnecessary technical support calls from someone who may try to connect to a WLAN 
that they do not have access to. However, this method is not intended to secure the wireless 
network.
The Media Access Control Address
To review, the media access control (MAC) address is a unique hardware identifier of a 
computer network device. This 6-byte address is the Layer 2 address that allows frames to 
be sent to and received from a device. Figure 8.3 shows the MAC address of a wireless net-
work adapter viewed with ipconfig.exe. An important point here is that the MAC address 
is unique, and no two network devices should ever have the same Layer 2 MAC address. 
In a wireless network, MAC addresses are easily visible to anyone using a wireless packet 
analyzer or wireless network scanning software utility. These addresses are required for a 
network device to send and receive information; therefore, they cannot be encrypted and 
are visible to anyone with the knowledge to view them.

MAC Address Filtering
Since IEEE 802.11 WLAN device technology operates at the lowest two layers of the OSI 
model, the Physical layer and the Data Link layer, the MAC address plays a big role in 
wireless networking. Manufacturers of WLAN equipment provide a feature known as 
MAC address filtering. Its purpose is to either allow or disallow access to the wireless net-
work by restricting which MAC addresses can IEEE 802.11 authenticate and associate to 
a wireless network. Figure 8.4 is an example of how to apply a MAC address filter on an 
access point.

Chapter 8  ■  Security Fundamentals for Wireless Networking  
This looks great on paper but is a weak security feature, because it can be easily com-
promised. Remember, wireless networks use the air as their access medium to communi-
cate, and RF is what exchanges the information between devices. So if someone were to 
monitor the air with a tool such as a wireless packet analyzer or wireless scanning utility 
software program, they would be able to see all the wireless traffic within hearing range 
of their wireless device. Because WLAN devices communicate with each other using MAC 
addressing, all of these addresses would be visible to whoever wants to see them.
MAC Address Spoofing
Because MAC addresses are visible to anyone who wants to take the time to see them by 
using the correct software utility, they create a potential problem for those who imple-
mented MAC address filtering. An intruder can easily perform a task called MAC address 
spoofing. This involves tricking the wireless device into thinking its unique MAC address is 
something other than what is encoded in the actual network card.
There are several ways for an intruder to accomplish MAC address spoofing. It can be 
done with software programs, such as SMAC, or within the computer operating system—
for example, in the Microsoft Windows Registry. All options and configuration settings 
in the Windows operating system are stored in this hierarchical database known as the 
Windows Registry. If someone wanted to spoof the MAC address of a wireless network 
adapter using this database, they might (depending on the adapter) be able to enter a new 
MAC address value in the device driver’s configuration, which would then be stored in the 
Windows Registry. Another option is to change the Windows Registry value directly using 
the Registry Editor tool built into Windows. This would be considered a modifiable MAC 
address. MAC addresses may also be stored in a configuration file, and in nonvolatile mem-
ory. Keep in mind that changing the MAC address in the Registry or in a configuration file 
changes only the software reference that the operating system sees and uses. It does not 
change what is known as the burned-in address (BIA) or the hard-coded address, which is 
unmodifiable.
IEEE 802.11 Authentication and 
Data Encryption
Authentication is defined as validating an identity. Authentication also gives the capability 
to control access to a system. In the original IEEE 802.11 standard, this is accomplished 
by using either IEEE 802.11 open system or shared-key authentication. Since open system 
authentication is a null authentication method and, except for special circumstances, can-
not fail, the wireless device will always authenticate. IEEE 802.11 shared-key authentica-
tion, on the other hand, uses WEP for wireless device authentication as well as for data 
payload encryption. Encryption is the process of modifying information from its original 

IEEE 802.11 Authentication and Data Encryption 
303
form to make it unreadable except by those who know the technique or the method in 
which the data was modifi ed. In the original IEEE 802.11 standard, data encryption was 
accomplished by using WEP. In order for a device to pass information across an access 
point, it must fi rst IEEE 802.11 authenticate and then associate. 
 About Wired Equivalent Privacy 
 From a security perspective, one major drawback to any wireless network is the fact that 
all information, including data payload, travels through the air from one device to another. 
This makes WLANs vulnerable to eavesdropping and inherently less secure than bounded 
networking using other networking technology, such as Ethernet. With IEEE 802.11 open 
system authentication, all information is broadcast through the air in plain text after a con-
nection to the wireless access point is created. This means that anyone with knowledge of 
how to use a wireless packet analyzer or other wireless scanning software program can eas-
ily see all the information that is passing between devices through the air. 
 WEP was designed as a way to protect wireless networking from casual eavesdropping. 
The original IEEE 802.11 standard states that the use of WEP is optional. The manufac-
turer supplies the capability, but it was up to the user of the wireless device to implement it. 
 In WLANs, WEP can be used in one of two ways: with IEEE 802.11 open system 
authentication to encrypt the data only or with shared-key authentication, which is used for 
wireless device authentication and for data encryption. The original standard specifi ed only 
64-bit WEP, which consists of a 40-bit key plus 24-bit WEP initialization vector (IV). 
 How Wired Equivalent Privacy Was Used 
 WEP was fairly simple to implement. It requires all wireless devices to have the same WEP 
key. The WEP key can be either 64-bit or 128-bit; however, the standard required only 
64-bit WEP. One disadvantage to WEP is that it uses static keys, which means all wireless 
devices—access points, bridges, and client stations—must have the same key and the key 
must be manually entered into them. Any time the key is changed, it must be changed on 
all the wireless devices that are on the same SSID. No matter which you use, 64-bit WEP or 
128-bit WEP, you are still only using a 24-bit IV. 64-bit WEP uses a 40-bit secret key and 
a 24-bit IV. 128-bit WEP uses a 104-bit secret key but still only the 24-bit IV, making both 
vulnerable to the same attacks. Gathering a number of these IVs allows an attacker to crack 
your key in very little time. 
 
 Some governing bodies no longer allow the use of WEP. Payment Card 
Industry (PCI), for example, no longer allows the use of WEP for securing 
wireless networks. If you are still using WEP, it should be a high priority to 
move away from this legacy security technology as quickly as possible. 
 Table  8.1 describes the characteristics of the two types of WEP keys.

 One major disadvantage of using WEP is that it was compromised early on and is there-
fore not secure. It is easy to capture data using a wireless packet analyzer; with a little 
knowledge and correct software utilities, cracking a WEP key is a simple feat. This made 
WEP a weak security solution, but it was pretty much the only solution available at the 
time of early IEEE 802.11 wireless networking. 
 With today’s newer and more sophisticated software tools and technology, WEP can 
be cracked easily and quickly. WEP will be discussed in more detail in the section “IEEE 
802.11 Encryption Methods” later in this chapter. 
 IEEE 802.11 SOHO and Enterprise 
Security Technologies 
 The IEEE 802.11i amendment to the standard provided much improvement in the ways 
WLANs can be secured. Enterprise-based WLANs are now capable of the most up-to-date 
security solutions available in the industry. This amendment to the standard introduced 
what is known as the  Robust Security Network (RSN). In order for WLAN equipment to 
create an RSN, it must be RSN capable or 802.11i compliant, which means it will option-
ally support Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) and it must also support Counter 
Mode with Cipher-Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol (CCMP). The 
Wi-Fi Alliance released several certifi cations that pertain to wireless networking: WPA and 
WPA 2.0 for SOHO and enterprise deployments, and WPS for the home user. 
 
 The following section discusses Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS). This topic 
is not included in the exam objectives but is explained here for your 
reference. 
 Wi-Fi Protected Setup PIN-Based or Push-Button 
Configuration Wireless Security 
 Many manufacturers of SOHO-grade WLAN equipment have adopted either PIN-based 
or push-button wireless security. Both of these solutions simplify the process of securing a 

IEEE 802.11 SOHO and Enterprise Security Technologies 
305
wireless network either for the SOHO environment or for home-based users. As discussed 
in Chapter  2 , the Wi-Fi Alliance has branded a certifi cation for push-button and PIN-
based security called  Wi-Fi Protected Setup . The Wi-Fi Protected Setup certifi cation (WPS) 
addresses both of these solutions. 
 
 In December 2011 a security flaw was reported with WPS. This alleg-
edly allowed an intruder to recover the personal identification number 
(PIN) used to create the 256-bit preshared key. Disabling certain features 
or a firmware update may be available to provide adequate protection. 
Keep in mind that these solutions to the issue may only be possible with 
newer-model wireless routers. You should check with the manufacturer to 
determine if a solution (either a software setting or firmware upgrade) is 
available for a specific device. 
 PIN-Based Security 
 Personal identifi cation number functionality is required in order for a wireless device to be 
WPS certifi ed. PIN-based security requires a unique PIN to be entered on all devices that 
will be part of the same secure wireless network. A PIN will come as either a fi xed label 
or sticker on a device, or it can be dynamically generated in the setup utility and shown 
on the computer screen. It is important to understand the difference between a PIN and 
a passphrase, password, shared key, or preshared key. A PIN is a number; the acronym 
spelled out means “personal identifi cation number.” Therefore, a PIN will consist only of 
numbers. Passphrases and the others may contain combinations of numbers, letters, and 
special characters. The registrar device in the case of a WLAN is the access point. The 
access point will detect when a new wireless device that supports WPS is in radio range. 
When this device tries to join the network, the registrar will prompt the user to enter the 
unique PIN. Once the PIN is entered, the process authenticates the device and encrypts 
the network data sent to and from the device. Figure  8.5 shows an example of PIN-based 
wireless security.

Chapter 8  ■  Security Fundamentals for Wireless Networking  
Push-Button Configuration Security
Push-button security or push-button configuration (PBC) allows users to configure WLAN 
security with “the push of a button,” making setting up wireless security a simple process. 
When a user pushes a hardware button on the wireless router and clicks a software button in 
the software utility for the network adapter installed in the client device wanting to associ-
ate, push-button security creates a connection between the devices, configures the network’s 
SSID, and turns on security. This allows a secure connection among all devices that are part 
of the wireless network. Figure 8.6 shows an example of WPS push-button security.
F i g u r e  8 .6    D-Link wireless router with push-button security
WPS Push
Button Security
In order to use push-button security, all devices—including the wireless router and the 
wireless client adapters—must support the feature. First a button is pushed on the wireless 
router; then a button (a software setting in the wireless client utility) is clicked on the wire-
less device(s). Usually in less than a minute the process is complete and all devices have a 
secure connection. Only those devices that are within RF hearing range and are participat-
ing in the process will become part of the secure network.
Support for both PIN and PBC configurations is required for access points; client devices 
at a minimum must support PIN. A third, optional method, near field communication 
(NFC) tokens, is also supported. A USB flash drive (memory card or solid-state storage 
drive with a USB interface) may be used to store and transfer credentials. Many SOHO 
equipment manufacturers have WPS-certified devices on the market today. Some include 
the following:

 Wi-Fi Protected Access and WPA2 
Personal Security 
 Passphrase-based security was designed with the SOHO or home-based user in mind. This 
type of security allows a user to create a very secure WLAN solution without the experi-
ence or knowledge necessary to confi gure enterprise-level components such as an 802.1X/
EAP and a RADIUS server. Passphrase-based security requires all wireless devices that are 
part of the same wireless network to have the same 256-bit preshared key (PSK) in order 
to securely communicate. The capability to derive a secure key of this length would be a 
daunting task; to ease the burden of having to create a long secure key, the passphrase was 
introduced. This works by requiring the user to enter a strong passphrase on all wireless 
devices that are part of the same WLAN to be secured. The benefi t of a passphrase is it 
can be a sequence of words or other text that is memorable only to the user who created 
it. After the passphrase is entered into the device, with the help of an electronic algorithm 
from the IEEE 802.11i amendment, it will create a 256-bit preshared key. 
 Passphrase Characteristics 
 The characteristics of the passphrase are as follows: 
 
■
 It consists of 8 to 63 ASCII (case sensitive) or 64 hexadecimal characters. 
 
■
 It creates a 256-bit preshared key. 
 
■
 The longer and more random the passphrase, the more secure it will be. 
 
■
 Weak passphrases can be compromised. 
 
 Several software programs and websites have random password genera-
tors to aid in the generation of strong passphrases. One such website 
is Gibson Research Corporation. Their Ultra High Security Password 
 Generator can be found at  www.grc.com/passwords.htm . 
 Figure  8.7 shows how to confi gure a passphrase on a SOHO access point.

WPA and WPA2 Enterprise Security
Concerned about problems connected with MAC address filtering and WEP, the industry drove 
the development of additional, improved wireless security solutions. One of these solutions also 
operates at Layer 2 and is an IEEE standard. This advanced enterprise-level solution is known 
as IEEE 802.1X (also called user-based security). User-based security allows an administrator 
to restrict access to a wireless network and its resources by creating users in a centralized data-
base. Anyone trying to join the network will be required to authenticate as one of the users by 
supplying a valid username and password. After successful authentication, the user will be able 
to gain access to resources for which they have permissions. This type of mutual authentication 
is more secure than the previously mentioned passphrase security method.
IEEE 802.1X/EAP
IEEE 802.1X/EAP consists of two different components used together to form an enter-
prise computer network security solution. IEEE 802.1X/EAP is defined in the IEEE 802.11-
2016 standard but was originally part of the IEEE 802.11i amendment. We’ll first discuss 
the IEEE 802.1X standard and then Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP). Then we’ll 
combine the technology and terms to form IEEE 802.1X/EAP.

IEEE 802.1X/EAP 
309  
IEEE 802.1X
IEEE 802.1X is a port-based access control method designed to work with IEEE 802.3 
Ethernet wired networks. However, this standard was adapted into the wireless world as an 
alternative, more powerful solution to legacy 802.11 WLAN security technologies. Wireless 
devices that use 802.1X technology are identified using different terminology from that 
used in IEEE 802.11 standards-based wireless networking:
■
■
Supplicant (wireless client device)
■
■
Authenticator (wireless access point)
■
■
Authentication server (RADIUS or AAA)
Figure 8.8 illustrates the 802.1X/EAP process for a WLAN.

Supplicant    The supplicant is another name for the wireless client device attempting to 
connect to the wireless network. This typically is the software security component of the 
wireless client device and the IEEE 802.1X terminology.
Authenticator    The authenticator is the IEEE 802.1X term for the wireless access point 
or WLAN controller. The authenticator acts as a middleman between the wireless sup-
plicant and the authentication server. When the supplicant requests to join the wire-
less network, the authenticator passes the authentication information between the two 
devices.
Authentication Server    The term “authentication server” is used by the IEEE 802.1X stan-
dard to identify the server that will authenticate the wireless supplicant. The authentication 
server receives all information from the authenticator. The authentication server may be an 
AAA or a RADIUS server; both are explained later in this chapter.

Chapter 8 ■ Security Fundamentals for Wireless Networking
 Extensible Authentication Protocol 
 IEEE 802.1X is a framework that allows for an authentication process. The authentication 
process used with IEEE 802.1X is  Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP). The IEEE 
802.1X standard will employ some EAP type to complete this process. Many types of EAP 
that can be used with IEEE 802.11 WLANs are available in the industry. These vary from 
proprietary solutions to very secure standard solutions. Following are some popular exam-
ples of EAP types: 
 
■
 EAP-TLS 
 
■
 TTLS (EAP-MSCHAPv2) 
 
■
 PEAP (EAP-MSCHAPv2) 
 
■
 EAP-FAST 
 These and other EAP types allow a user to authenticate to a wireless network in 
several ways, including credentials such as username/password or certifi cate-based 
authentication. 
 
 The details of EAP and how it works are beyond the scope of the exam 
objectives. For more information, refer to other CWNP materials. 
 IEEE 802.1X and EAP Together: IEEE 802.1X/EAP 
 Now it is time to put these two parts together to form the IEEE 802.1X/EAP authentica-
tion process. This authentication process is typically used for enterprise-level security but 
can be and is sometimes used in smaller wireless installations. A variety of EAP types that 
work very well with IEEE 802.11 WLAN deployments are available. The EAP type chosen 
will depend on the environment in which the WLAN is used. EAP types vary in specifi ca-
tions, costs, and complexity. Figure  8.9 shows IEEE 802.1X/EAP confi guration on a cloud-
based wireless network management system. 
 Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service 
Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) is a networking service that pro-
vides centralized authentication and administration of users. RADIUS started as a way to 
authenticate and authorize dial-up networking users. A remote user would dial up to a net-
work using the public switched telephone network (PSTN) and a modem. A modem from a 
modem pool on the receiver side would answer the call. The user would then be prompted 
by a remote access server to enter a username and password in order to authenticate. Once 
the credentials were validated, the user would then have access to any resources for which 
they had permissions. Figure  8.10 illustrates the remote access service authentication 
mechanism.

In this example, the remote access client would be the computer dialing into the net-
work, and the remote access server would be the one performing the authentication for the 
dial-up user. As computer networks grew in size and complexity and remote access technol-
ogy improved, there was a need to optimize the process on the remote access server side. 
This is where RADIUS provides a solution. RADIUS combined decentralized remote access 
services databases into one central location, allowing for centralized user administration and 
centralized management. It eased the burden of having to manage several databases and opti-
mized administration of remote access services.
A company does not need a large number of RADIUS servers. For a small to medium-
sized company, one RADIUS server should be sufficient (with a backup, if possible). Larger 
enterprise organizations may need several RADIUS servers across the entire wide area net-
work. In wireless networking, the wireless access point can act as a RADIUS client, which 
means it will have the capability to accept requests from wireless client devices and forward 
them to the RADIUS server for authentication. Figure 8.11 shows this configuration.

As Figure 8.11 shows, the remote access client is now the wireless access point. The 
wireless client device is authorized as a user in the database of the RADIUS server.  
The RADIUS server is the authenticating server or database. A RADIUS server may also  
be known as an authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) server. In this  
configuration, it will authenticate users and provide access to the resources for which they 
have permissions. In addition, it will keep track of all transactions by accounting.
Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting
The Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) protocol provides a framework 
to allow secure access and authorization as well as keep track of the user’s activities on a 

IEEE 802.11 Encryption Methods 
313  
computer network including wireless networks. AAA is commonly part of a RADIUS serv-
er’s functionality. The three components that work together in the AAA protocol are:
■
■
Authentication
■
■
Authorization
■
■
Accounting
The First Part of AAA—Authentication    Authentication is defined as a way of confirming 
or validating an identity. Basically, it validates that you are who you say you are. Enterprise 
IEEE 802.11 wireless networks commonly use IEEE 802.1X/EAP or user-based authentica-
tion technology. In addition to username and passwords, wireless networks may also use 
other authentication methods, including digital certificates and smart cards, to name a few.
The Second Part of AAA—Authorization    For wireless networking, authorization provides 
access to network resources that a wireless device or user has the appropriate permissions 
or rights to use. These permissions could be tied to an individual user object but can also 
be tied to a group object. After a user authenticates, the AAA protocol will then allow for 
the authorization process. Authorization can be on a per-user or per-group basis. In IEEE 
wireless networking technology, authorization is commonly used for WLAN functional-
ity, including bandwidth controls, time restrictions/controls, and quality of service (QoS) 
policies.
The Third Part of AAA—Accounting    Accounting is the last part or third “A” in the AAA 
protocol. Accounting will keep track of every place on the network a user visits or every-
thing done on the network. Basically, it monitors all network activity. This can be used for 
something as simple as tracking resource usage for software or hardware upgrade purposes 
or for technology budgeting purposes. Accounting can be used to determine what technol-
ogy different areas of the organization are using and how they will be able to contribute to 
the cost of this technology.
IEEE 802.11 Encryption Methods
In the most basic sense, encryption consists of taking information and scrambling it so only 
the sender and intended recipient that know the encryption method are able to decipher the 
encrypted information. In addition to authenticating and verifying an identity, encryption 
also needs to be considered for wireless networking. In the IEEE 802.11 standard, the fol-
lowing three encryption mechanisms could be used on a wireless network to protect data 
traffic:
■
■
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)
■
■
Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP)
■
■
Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol 
(CCMP)

314 
Chapter 8  ■  Security Fundamentals for Wireless Networking  
Wired Equivalent Privacy
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) was an optional encryption method specified in the 
original IEEE 802.11 standard. WEP was only intended to protect wireless network users 
against casual eavesdropping and for IEEE 802.11 shared-key authentication. As discussed 
previously, this encryption method is considered legacy and was compromised early on, 
making it a weak solution to use with modern wireless networks. With early deployments 
of standards-based wireless networking, WEP was the only solution available, which made 
it very popular. At that time, the capability to crack WEP was available, but that did not 
mean anyone could do it. Initially, cracking WEP required a large amount of data, some 
knowledge of the process, and usually a software program to extract the WEP key. Newer 
technology has made cracking WEP a simple process. WEP can be cracked in minutes 
rather than hours, days, or weeks, and almost anyone can do it. The fact that WEP is 
available in two key lengths—64-bit or 128-bit—makes no difference to the experienced 
intruder. WEP uses the RC4 stream cipher for bit-level encryption. The problem with WEP 
does not lie in RC4 but in how it was used in the encryption process. One reason WEP is 
vulnerable to intrusion is because of something called an initialization vector (IV). The 
24-bit IV is broadcast in the clear or unencrypted. This being the case, it exposes a weak-
ness in the way WEP was designed, thereby allowing it to be compromised.
Is WEP Still Used?
WEP is weak and its vulnerabilities can be cracked, so it is not a recommended solution 
to secure wireless computer data. Many countries have not fallen under PCI’s scrutiny yet 
and still use WEP to protect wireless networks. Older voice over Wi-Fi phones and bar-
code scanners may still use WEP.
As a general rule, it is best not to use WEP as a security measure for protection of a wire-
less network and its users. However, there are still some deployments that use devices 
with wireless networking that have limited capabilities when it comes to security. WEP 
may be the only security option they have. If upgrading the devices to something that 
supports higher-level security is not an option, the organization may have no choice but 
to use WEP. If this is the case, it is important for the network administrator to use appro-
priate device segmentation for the WEP-enabled devices in order to not compromise the 
entire network infrastructure. One way to do this is to consider the use of a virtual local 
area network (VLAN). This enables the administrator to separate wireless devices that 
may be potentially compromised because of WEP from other devices that are capable of 
more advanced security solutions.
Many software programs are available to allow someone with limited knowledge to be 
able to crack WEP. Newer, more sophisticated tools allow WEP to be cracked in minutes. 
If a wireless network has the capability of more advanced security, such as 802.11i or WPA 
2.0, one of those should be used instead of WEP. An appropriate device upgrade path should 
be evaluated in order to eliminate the use of WEP in any capacity on the wireless network.

IEEE 802.11 Encryption Methods 
315  
Temporal Key Integrity Protocol
Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) was designed as a firmware upgrade to WEP. 
TKIP added several enhancements to the WEP algorithm and was the foundation for the 
Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) certification from the Wi-Fi Alliance. These enhancements 
include the following:
■
■
Per-packet key mixing of the IV to separate IVs from weak keys
■
■
A dynamic rekeying mechanism to change encryption and integrity keys
■
■
48-bit IV and IV sequence counter to prevent replay attacks
■
■
Message Integrity Check (MIC) to prevent forgery attacks
■
■
Use of the RC4 stream cipher, thereby allowing backward compatibility with WEP
Configuring a wireless network to use TKIP was a fairly straightforward process. It 
can be accomplished either by using the web interface available on most SOHO access 
points or by using the web interface or command-line interface for enterprise-level access 
points. For the wireless client devices, TKIP will be configured through the client soft-
ware utility. Some older wireless hardware devices may not support TKIP. If this is the 
case, replacement of the hardware will be necessary in order to take advantage of newer 
security solutions. Figure 8.12 shows how to configure TKIP using WPA on a WLAN 
controller.

Chapter 8 ■ Security Fundamentals for Wireless Networking
 
 TKIP/RC4 uses a 48-bit IV and can be compromised in the same way as 
WEP if a weak key is used. Using a stronger technique such as CCMP/AES 
is a better solution. It is also important to note that if TKIP is implemented, 
IEEE 802.11n/ac MCS rates will not be utilized. In other words, the highest 
data rate achievable will be only 54 Mbps if TKIP is in use. 
 Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message 
Authentication Code Protocol 
Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol 
(CCMP) is a mandatory part of the IEEE 801.11i amendment and is in the IEEE 802.11-
2016 standard and part of Wi-Fi Protected Access 2.0 (WPA2) certifi cation from the 
Wi-Fi Alliance. CCMP uses the  Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm block 
cipher. CCMP is mandatory for RSN compliance. If an RSN is required to comply with 
an industry or governmental regulation, CCMP must be used. CCMP is also intended as 
a replacement to TKIP. Because of the strong encryption CCMP provides, it may require 
replacement of legacy hardware. In some cases, it may use a separate chip to perform 
computation-intensive AES ciphering. 
 Confi guration of CCMP is similar to that of TKIP, discussed earlier. The main differ-
ence with CCMP is that older hardware may not support it and it is a stronger encryption 
solution. Figure  8.13 shows confi guring the CCMP method using WPA2.

Role-Based Access Control 
317  
Upgrading the Firmware on Wireless LAN Devices
In some cases, it may be necessary to upgrade the device firmware in order to get either 
TKIP or CCMP capability. It is important to follow the manufacturer’s instructions when 
upgrading firmware to prevent damage to the device. Improper firmware upgrades or a 
loss of power during the upgrade process may render the device unusable or require the 
device to be sent back to the manufacturer for repair.
Some of the security technologies we just discussed are part of the Wi-Fi Alliance 
interoperability testing for standards-based WLAN equipment. As mentioned in Chapter 2, 
equipment certified for both WPA and WPA2 can function in either personal or enterprise 
modes. Table 8.2 shows the details of both WPA and WPA 2 certifications.

Role-Based Access Control
Role-based access control (RBAC) is a way of restricting access to only authorized users. 
This access is from authentication based on specific roles rather than user identities. It was 
designed to ease the task of security administration on large networks. RBAC has char-
acteristics similar to those of a common network administration practice: the creation of 
users and groups. RBAC may also fit well under the authorization part of AAA because it 
has very similar characteristics.
To give a user on a computer network access to a network resource, best practices rec-
ommend creating a group object, assigning the group permissions to the resource, and then 
adding the user object to the group. This method allows any user who is a member of the 
group to be granted access to the resource. RBAC can be used for various activities users 
may perform while connected to a WLAN, including limiting the amount of throughput, 
enforcing time restrictions, or controlling access to specific resources such as the Internet.
Let’s look at an example. Your organization consists of several departments that use 
resources available on the wireless network. The departments are sales, engineering, and 

318 
Chapter 8  ■  Security Fundamentals for Wireless Networking  
accounting. Each department has specific requirements for what and when they need to 
access from the WLAN. This is where RBAC would be a great fit. If the network adminis-
trator wanted to restrict access to the WLAN for the sales department from 8 a.m. to  
5 p.m., she could create a role using this feature. If the engineering department was using 
too much bandwidth, a role could be created to restrict throughput for that department. 
These are a couple of examples where RBAC can work with a WLAN.
Virtual Private Networking
Virtual private networking (VPN) is the capability to create private communications over a 
public network infrastructure such as the Internet. The security solutions discussed earlier 
in this chapter are Layer 2 security solutions—that is, all such solutions work at Layer 2 
of the OSI model. By contrast, VPNs are Internet Protocol-based; they typically operate at 
Layer 3 of the OSI model but some will work at Layer 2. Figure 8.14 illustrates VPN tech-
nology in relationship to the OSI model.

Layer 2
Prior to the ratification of the IEEE 802.11i amendment to the standard, VPN technol-
ogy was prevalent in enterprise deployments as well as in remote access security. Since 
Layer 2 security solutions have become stronger (mostly thanks to the 802.11i amendment 
and the Wi-Fi Alliance WPA and WPA2 certifications), VPN technology is not as widely 
used within enterprise LANs. However, VPN still remains a powerful security solution for 
remote access in both wired and wireless networking.
VPNs consist of two parts: tunneling and encryption. Figure 8.15 illustrates a VPN tun-
nel using the Internet. A standalone VPN tunnel does not provide data encryption, and 
VPN tunnels are created across IP networks. In a very basic sense, VPNs use encapsulation 
methods where one IP frame is encapsulated within a second IP frame. The encryption of 
VPNs is performed as a separate function.

Shipping a Crate Using VPN Technology
An analogy for the VPN process is shipping a locked crate from one location to another. 
You are a technical support engineer for the headquarters office of a company that has 
five offices in different locations around the world. You get a telephone call from a co-
worker at one of the remote offices. She needs to replace an access point with a newer 
model at the remote office. You need to ship the preconfigured replacement access point 
to her using a common carrier. You want to ensure that the access point arrives at the 
destination location without coming into physical contact with anybody other than the 
intended recipient.
The access point is analogous to the IP frame. You put the access point into a crate that 
has a combination lock to secure it. This crate containing the access point is analogous to 
the second IP frame, or the one that encapsulates the original IP frame.
You ship the crate to the destination using a common carrier, which would be analogous 
to the public infrastructure over which the encrypted data is sent. Many other packages 
are shipped by this common carrier, but no one will be able to see the contents of the 
crate because they do not know the combination to the lock (the encryption method).
When the access point arrives at the destination, the recipient (the technical support engi-
neer for the remote office) must know the combination of the lock on the crate in order to 
open it to retrieve the access point. So you tell her the combination over the telephone. 
This is analogous to the encryption method. Over a secure telephone line, only you (the 
sender) and she (the recipient) know the combination to the lock. The tech support engi-
neer will be able to unlock the crate using the combination you supplied her, and she will 
be able to retrieve the access point.
The following are two common types of VPN protocols:
■
■
Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)
■
■
Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP)

320 
Chapter 8 ■ Security Fundamentals for Wireless Networking
 Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol 
 Developed by a vendor consortium that included Microsoft,  Point-to-Point Tunneling 
Protocol (PPTP) was very popular because of its ease of confi guration and was included in 
all Microsoft Windows operating systems starting with Windows 95. PPTP uses Microsoft 
Point-to-Point Encryption (MPPE-128) Protocol for encryption. This process provides both 
tunneling and encryption capabilities for the user’s data. 
 
 If the PPTP configuration uses MS-CHAP version 2 for user authentication 
on a wireless network, it can be a security issue. This authentication pro-
cess can be captured using a wireless protocol analyzer or other scanning 
software program and potentially allow someone to perform a dictionary 
attack, enabling them to acquire a user’s credentials and eventually giving 
them the capability to log on to the network. A dictionary attack is per-
formed by software that challenges the encrypted password against com-
mon words or phrases in a text file (dictionary). Therefore, using PPTP on a 
wireless network should be avoided. Keep in mind that the security vulner-
ability is not PPTP itself; it is that the authentication frames on a WLAN can 
be captured by an intruder, who can then acquire user credentials (user-
name and password) and be able to gain access to the VPN. 
 Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol 
 Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) is the combination of two different tunneling protocols: 
Cisco’s Layer 2 Forwarding (L2F) and Microsoft’s Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP). 
L2TP defi nes the tunneling process, which requires some level of encryption in order to func-
tion. With L2TP, a popular choice of encryption is Internet Protocol Security (IPSec), which 
provides authentication and encryption for each IP packet in a data stream. Since L2TP was 
published in 1999 as a proposed standard and because it is more secure than PPTP, L2TP 
has gained much popularity and for the most part is a replacement for PPTP. L2TP/IPSec is a 
very common VPN solution in use today. PPTP should not be used when L2TP is available.  
 Components of a VPN Solution 
 A VPN solution consists of the following three components: 
 
■
 Client side (endpoint) 
 
■
 Network infrastructure (public or private) 
 
■
 Server side (endpoint) 
 In many cases, both the client side and server side are known as VPN endpoints. The 
infrastructure often is a public access network, such as the Internet. Some fi rewall manu-
facturers’ security solutions allow the application of advanced security policies, such as 
web content fi ltering, anti-virus, botnet detection, and other security features to be applied 
directly to wireless traffi c. This enables VPNs to secure various types of network traffi c 
very easily for both wireless client devices and access points to wireless controller connec-
tions. The client-side endpoint typically consists of software, allowing it to be confi gured 
for the VPN. This software is available at a nominal cost from a variety of manufacturers.

The Wireless Intrusion Prevention 
System
In wireless networking, a wireless intrusion prevention system (WIPS) is a software/ 
hardware solution that monitors the radio waves and, using a wireless hardware sensor, can 
report captured information to software to be recorded in a server database. (This differs 
from other network monitoring and management systems discussed later in this chapter.) 
The WIPS solution will then be able to take the appropriate countermeasures to prevent 
wireless network intrusions. These countermeasures are based on identifying the intrusion 
by comparing the captured information to an intrusion signature database within the WIPS 
server. Figure 8.18 shows a WIPS dashboard that displays a Layer 1 RF jamming DoS 
attack that was recorded.

330 
Chapter 8  ■  Security Fundamentals for Wireless Networking  
Let’s look at these in a little more detail.
24/7/365 Monitoring    With a WIPS, monitoring of the wireless network can be accom-
plished 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to help identify potential attacks, including DoS, 
either from Layer 1 RF or from Layer 2 software such as a deauthentication storm. A WIPS 
also finds rogue (unauthorized) access points and misconfigured wireless devices.
Detection and Mitigation    Unlike many wireless intrusion detection systems (WIDS), 
WIPS has the capability to detect and react. WIPS solutions will automatically respond to 
threats against a WLAN by stopping the device or process that contains the threat before it 
has a chance to cause any damage to the wireless network.
Notification of Threats    WIPS solutions have the capability to provide notifications to net-
work administrators based on alerts and alarms of potential threats that the WIPS encoun-
ters during monitoring. These notifications can be provided in a variety of ways, such as 
email or pager.
Integrated Spectrum Analysis    This feature allows an administrator to view the state of a 
remote radio environment at a branch office or remote location. This allows the accurate 
diagnosis of radio spectrum problems, including Layer 1 DoS attacks.
Elaborate Reporting Systems    In addition to standard reports, most WIPS solutions allow 
network administrators to create their own customized reports in a short period of time. 
These reports will enable an organization to meet the specific requirements of audit groups, 
either internal or external to the organization.
Regulatory Policy Compliance    A WIPS will have the capability to help ensure that an 
organization maintains the necessary legislative compliance. Compliance requirements 
include Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Payment Card 
Industry (PCI).
Retains Data for Forensics    Many WIPS solutions can retain data that may be used in 
forensics investigations. The WIPS will provide the documented proof an organization 
may require to take the appropriate action based on events recorded. WIPS solutions will 
require fine-tuning to some degree to eliminate misrepresentation of the threat signatures 
the system will detect. This starts with a baseline of the environment, allowing the admin-
istrator to gauge the levels of detection and reaction.
Uses Hardware Sensors for Monitoring    WIPS solutions will use either dedicated hardware 
sensors or share the sensor functionality with access points. These sensors will collect data 
by monitoring the air 24×7 and allowing information to be reported to a server database.
WIPS Configuration and Maintenance
Although a WIPS solution is a valuable tool to use for WLAN monitoring and detection/
mitigation of wireless intrusions, it needs to be set up, configured, and maintained cor-
rectly. Installing a WIPS system without setting the appropriate thresholds and baselines 
may result in unreliable or unusable collections of information. For example, if an orga-
nization is concerned about deauthentication attacks, such as forcing a “deauthentication

storm” (sending many consecutive deauthentication frames), this setting will need to be 
enabled on the WIPS system with the appropriate threshold setting in order to be detected. 
Remember from Chapter 6 that deauthentication occurs when an existing authentication is 
no longer valid, and it can be caused by a WLAN device logging off from the current con-
nection or roaming to a different basic service set (BSS). If an intruder sends just a couple of 
deauthentication frames to a wireless device in an attempt to force them to reauthenticate, 
and thus perform a hijack attack, the activity may fall under the threshold set for the deau-
thentication frames that are monitored and could be missed. The bottom line is that proper 
setup, configuration, and maintenance of a WIPS system all need to be carefully consid-
ered. Figure 8.19 shows the policy setup screen for a WIPS.

Overlay and Integrated WIPS Technology
A WIPS requires hardware sensors for monitoring and sending the data to the WIPS server. 
These sensors can be dedicated devices (only used for monitoring) or they can share func-
tionality with the wireless access points. The terminology used for these WIPS sensors is

Overlay WIPS Sensors
Overlay WIPS sensors are dedicated wireless devices that have physical characteristics 
similar to those of wireless access points but are only used for scanning the air and sending 
data to a WIPS server. These devices are passive and will not interfere with other WLAN 
devices such as access points. This type of sensor does not need to be implemented on a 
1:1 deployment. In other words, you do not need one WIPS sensor with every access point. 
WIPS sensors are commonly installed in a 1:3 or 1:4 ratio. Figure 8.20 shows how a WIPS 
overlay solution uses dedicated sensors.

It is best to check with the WIPS manufacturer to determine the recommended number 
of dedicated sensors. Some wireless site survey software tools will specify the number and 
locations of the sensors required, based on the wireless network design. One disadvantage 
to the overlay solution is the extra cost for the dedicated sensors. Some manufacturers 
allow a wireless access point to run as a dedicated sensor; for these, the cost would be the 
same as the wireless access point.
Integrated WIPS Sensors
Integrated WIPS sensors are part of a wireless access point’s functionality. An integrated 
sensor may have a dedicated radio for full-time WIPS monitoring, or it may share a radio 
with the access point for part-time WIPS monitoring. A dedicated WIPS radio that is 
built into the wireless access point will be able to monitor the air and send data directly 
to the WIPS server full time. This would be the radio’s only function. One benefit to 
this type of sensor is that the cost will be less than that of the overlay system, because 
it does not requires separate dedicated WIPS sensors. However, the cost may be a little 
higher than if it were only an access point because of the additional radio for the WIPS 
capability. The other type of integrated WIPS sensor is the one that shares a radio with 
the access point. The downside to this is that the WIPS monitoring will only be part-time

and will not be able to capture everything that is going on. Figure 8.21 shows a WIPS 
integrated solution, consisting of a WIPS sensor and access point in the same device 
(wireless access point).

Integrated WIPS Sensor Analogy
Think about this analogy. An after-hours security officer is sitting at a desk watching the 
security monitors for any unauthorized access or other activities that could be a secu-
rity violation. The officer hears a noise down the hall and leaves his post to investigate. 
Because he has stepped away from the desk, he cannot be watching the security moni-
tors at the same time; therefore, an unauthorized person may be able to enter the area 
without being noticed by the security officer. This is similar to the way an access point 
that is a part-time integrated WIPS sensor and that is servicing wireless client devices 
may not be able to see and detect potential WIPS violations. For example, if the wireless 
access point is providing voice over wireless access, because of QoS features the access 
point will prioritize the wireless voice frames and may forgo the WIPS monitoring. This 
will result in the WIPS server not being able to capture potential wireless intrusions or 
other wireless security violations.
The decision to use an overlay or integrated WIPS can be a tough one. It may come 
down to what you are trying to prevent and what you are trying to protect. It may also 
come down to cost. The bottom line is this: If you are planning to install a WIPS, evaluate 
the advantages and disadvantages of each type carefully. One of the main goals of a WIPS 
is to enforce functional (technical) corporate security policy 24/7/365.

Chapter 8  ■  Security Fundamentals for Wireless Networking  
The Captive Portal
A captive portal is a process that redirects a user to an authentication source of some type 
before they will be allowed wireless network access. This authentication source in the 
form of a web page will require a user to “authenticate” in some way and may include the 
following:
■
■
Enter user credentials (username and password).
■
■
Input payment information.
■
■
Agree to terms and conditions.
When one or more of these methods is complete, a wireless device will then be able to 
access the network and use whatever resources they have permission to access. Most if not 
all public access wireless networks should have some type of captive portal enabled. This 
will help to protect both the provider (host) and the user of the wireless network. At a mini-
mum, requiring the user to agree to terms and conditions via a captive portal should be 
implemented.
Most enterprise-grade wireless access points, including cooperative access points and 
WLAN controllers, have built-in captive portal capabilities that are fairly straightforward 
to implement.
Wireless Network Management 
and Monitoring Systems
Wireless network management and monitoring systems are software- or hardware-based 
solutions that allow a wireless network engineer to both control and administer wireless 
infrastructure devices and collect information that may be used to troubleshoot and resolve 
WLAN issues. The information collected may consist of either Physical layer information 
(RF) or Data Link layer information (WLAN frames).
In the early days of standards-based IEEE 802.11 wireless networking, only autonomous 
access points for the most part were available; there was no centralized management or 
control. (Autonomous access points are discussed in Chapter 3, “Infrastructure and Client 
Devices Used with Wireless Networking.”) To manage these infrastructure devices, you 
would need to configure each device separately. This could be done by connecting either 
through the command-line interface or a web-based interface, and individual configuration 
worked well if only a few infrastructure devices were installed.
As the need for WLAN technology grew, however, so did the number of devices or 
access points. Managing a large number of infrastructure devices manually was not  
feasible. This is where the wireless network management system (WNMS) evolved.  

Wireless Network Management and Monitoring Systems 
335  
The WNMS is a centralized solution that was originally available in either software form 
to run on a server or hardware form to run as a standalone network appliance. (We’ll look 
at a third option, cloud-based WNMS solutions, next.) A WNMS would allow a network 
engineer to manage and control the entire WLAN centrally. These centralized manage-
ment systems are available from many manufacturers for use with their own infrastructure 
devices and are available as vendor-neutral solutions to work with many different manufac-
turers’ equipment. A WNMS may also incorporate WIPS technology for a complete wire-
less network management, monitoring, and security solution. Figure 8.22 shows a WNMS 
dashboard.

WNMS: Software, Hardware, or Cloud?
As you just learned, a WNMS is available in different forms: software that will run on a 
server, hardware that will run on a dedicated appliance, and now cloud-based WNMS solu-
tions. This newest option is growing in popularity. With the evolution of standards-based 
WLAN technology, the WLAN controller worked as a substitute for WNMS, offering con-
trol and management of the complete WLAN infrastructure. However, as the wireless net-
works continued to grow, so did the need for a WNMS. Figure 8.23 shows a cloud-based 
wireless network management system.

Wireless Network Management and Monitoring Systems 
337  
Keep in mind that some manufacturers allow management of both wireless and wired 
infrastructures from one platform, creating a “unified” management of the entire network.
Wireless Network Monitoring
In addition to wireless network management solutions, you need to understand wireless 
network monitoring solutions. These monitoring solutions are in addition to the WIPS you 
learned about earlier in this chapter. They allow a wireless network engineer to monitor the 
performance of a wireless network at the Physical layer and the Data Link layer for both 
troubleshooting and security information gathering purposes.
Physical Layer Monitoring
Physical layer monitoring allows the wireless network engineer to see what is happening in 
the air as it relates to RF. This is usually accomplished with the use of a spectrum analyzer, 
which allows an engineer to “see” the RF and thus detect potential interference issues and 
also security issues. Interference from both WLAN devices and other wireless devices such 
as two-way radios or microwave ovens will be visible with the help of a spectrum analyzer. 
The spectrum analyzer will also detect Layer 1 security issues such as a narrow-band or 
wide-band RF DoS attack. Figure 8.24 shows how a spectrum analyzer can see the Physical 
layer information and detect potential security threats.

Data Link Layer Monitoring
Data Link layer monitoring means looking at the Layer 2 information; it allows a network 
engineer to view the WLAN frames that traverse the air and provides the opportunity to view 
both potential performance and security issues. Protocol analysis tools allow the engineer 
to view both frame exchanges and frame decoding by expanding on the captured wireless 
frames. From a security point of view, these tools can provide valuable wireless network 
information for both the wireless network engineer as well as a potential intruder. The wire-
less network engineer will be able to find potential security configuration issues that could 
open the door to intruders. If an intruder were to capture wireless frames, such as the pre-
shared key 4-way handshake, they might (depending on how strong the passphrase is) be able 
to use a dictionary attack software program and determine the passphrase. This would allow 
them to gain access to the wireless network and potentially see a user’s encrypted data.
Some WLAN analyzers are able to capture and reconstruct TCP/IP frames and reconstruct a 
session and allow web pages to be seen or email messages to be read directly from the captured 
wireless frames. Keep in mind that this is possible on an open wireless network or one on which 
the intruder has been able to capture the frames that allow them to access the WLAN and to 
decode the data frames. Table 8.5 provides some common WLAN protocol analyzers.

 Some of these packet analyzers (among others) will perform WLAN analysis and work 
with wired LANs. 
 
 Many manufacturers of WLAN packet analyzers offer trial versions of their 
software to allow you to “try before you buy.” Visit the manufacturers’ 
websites for more information on how to obtain a trial version of their 
software. 
 
 The topic of regulatory compliance, discussed next, is not included in the 
exam objectives but is explained here for your own reference. 
 Industry Regulatory Compliance 
 It is very important for companies, organizations, and businesses that collect private or 
personal information from individuals to secure that information appropriately. In recent 
years, there have been several legislative regulations that various businesses are required 
to conform to. This legislation regulates how data is handled for businesses such as health 
care, retail, fi nancial, and others. Plans for complying with them are known as  legisla-
tive compliances . When using wireless networks, companies must verify any additional 
requirements from a security perspective that may be needed when dealing with regulatory 
compliance. This section briefl y describes some of the more popular legislative compliance 
requirements. 
 PCI Compliance 
 PCI stands for Payment Card Industry and is a regulation requiring companies to adhere to 
security standards created to protect card information pertaining to fi nancial transactions. 
According to the PCI Security Standards Council, in order to be PCI-compliant a company 
must meet the following six requirements: 
 
■
 Build and maintain a secure network. 
 
■
 Protect cardholder data. 
 
■
 Maintain a vulnerability management program. 
 
■
 Implement strong access control measures. 
 
■
 Regularly monitor and test networks. 
 
■
 Maintain an information security policy.

site at  www.pcisecuritystandards.org .

 HIPAA Compliance 
 HIPAA is the abbreviation for the United States Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act of 1996. The goal of HIPAA is to provide standardized mechanisms for 
electronic data exchange, security, and confi dentiality of all health care-related computer 
information and data. HIPAA consists of two parts: 
 
■
 HIPAA, Title I 
 
■
 HIPAA, Title II 
 If someone loses or changes their job, Title I of HIPAA protects their health insurance 
coverage. 
 In the information technology industries, Title II is what most people mean when they 
refer to HIPAA. It establishes mandatory regulations that require extensive changes to the 
way that health-care providers conduct business by securing computer information and 
data.

Human Services website at  www.hhs.gov/ocr/hipaa . 
 Summary 
 In this chapter, we briefl y discussed network intrusion and the impact it can have on a 
WLAN. We also took a look at IEEE 802.11 security methods and a quick review from 
Chapter  6 of the authentication types defi ned in the IEEE 802.11 standard: open system and 
shared key. We explored some of the IEEE 802.11 WLAN security technologies, including: 
 
■
 SSID hiding 
 
■
 MAC address filtering 
 
■
 WEP 
 We discussed the vulnerabilities in each of these solutions. We showed an example of 
how the SSID could be hidden from view and also discussed why this is not a good security 
method—because other wireless frames contain the SSID, and it can be found even though 
it is removed from a beacon frame. You saw how MAC address fi ltering can be spoofed 
using freeware utilities downloadable from the Internet or through the computer operating 
system. We also looked at the last of three security solutions, WEP, and illustrated how it 
could be compromised; as you learned, it is a weak wireless security solution. 
 In addition to the legacy security solutions, we explored some of the more modern 
solutions: 
 SOHO and home-based solutions 
 
■
 Passphrase/preshared key 
 
■
 Push-button or PIN-based configuration 

Exam Essentials

Enterprise-based solutions
■
■
802.1X/EAP
■
■
RADIUS and AAA
You learned that encryption consists of taking information and scrambling it so that 
only the sender and the intended recipient, who know the algorithm, will be able to 
decipher the data. We looked at three types of encryption used in IEEE 802.11 wireless 
networking:
■
■
WEP
■
■
TKIP
■
■
CCMP
Role-based access control (RBAC) is a component for administration of wireless net-
works that allows access and authorization based on individual groups and users and other 
parameters.
We also discussed virtual private networking (VPN), commonly a Layer 3 solution that 
provides a secure connection over a public infrastructure such as the Internet. You saw 
how VPN technology can be a solution for wireless network users from a remote loca-
tion to access corporate or other networks from a hotspot or other unsecured WLAN. We 
also compared PPTP and L2TP and discussed the differences between them. PPTP using 
MS-CHAP version 2 is not a good security solution for WLANs, because the authentica-
tion can be captured and potentially compromised through a dictionary attack.
You saw how a captive portal can be used to redirect a user to a web authentication page 
requiring authentication or an agreement of terms and conditions prior to getting network 
access.
Products are available for enterprise WLANs that will monitor the airwaves 24/7 and 
record all activity detected by the wireless sensors. We discussed these solutions, known 
as a wireless intrusion prevention system (WIPS), which have the capability to detect and 
react to a potential intrusion on the wireless network. You learned that WIPS sensors are 
available in an overlay or integrated technology. Wireless network management systems 
(WNMS) are available in software-, hardware-, or cloud-based solutions. A WNMS will 
allow for centralized management and control of the wireless and possibly wired infra-
structure. A WNMS may have some WIPS capability. We also addressed the functionality 
and features of these solutions.
Finally, we discussed regulatory compliances, including the Health Insurance Portability 
and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Payment Card Industry (PCI), and the importance of 
securing computer data for industries such as health care, retail, and financial.

This chapter discusses the details of WLAN design and site 
surveys for IEEE 802.11 wireless networking. We will explore 
site survey planning and the business aspects related to a 
wireless network site survey, including gathering business requirements, interviewing the 
appropriate people, and gathering additional information about the location in which the 
network will be installed.
You will learn about site survey requirements, such as understanding the business 
requirements for the intended use of the WLAN and asking plenty of questions by inter-
viewing department managers and users to help determine the applications and security 
requirements for the proposed network. Gathering information is a major part of a site 
­survey to ensure a successful deployment.
You will also learn about the importance of documenting every step, from the design 
to the installation, and the importance of validating the wireless network, a process com-
monly known as a post survey. It is important to have all the necessary groundwork prior 
to starting a physical wireless radio frequency (RF) site survey. Having all the correct infor-
mation in hand will allow for a complete and thorough survey, which in turn will result in 
a successful wireless network deployment.
In this chapter, you will see some of the components of performing an RF wireless site 
survey, including determining areas of RF coverage and interference by using a spectrum 
analyzer. Considering both Wi-Fi and non–Wi-Fi interference sources and understanding 
how this interference will affect the deployment are also important parts of performing a 
site survey. We will also look at different types of site surveys, both manual and predictive 
modeling. You will learn about the two types of manual site surveys, passive and active, 
and see the advantages and disadvantages of both. Understanding the steps involved and 
the details of each site survey type will help a wireless engineer determine the best meth-
odology to use. You will see some of the tools that may be used in a wireless site survey, 
including spectrum analyzers, wireless protocol analyzers, and wireless scanners.
Finally, we will look at the two different types of channel architecture and best practices 
for hardware placement, including access points and antennas, as well as some of the limi-
tations you may encounter during the physical site survey process.
Wireless Site Surveys
Early WLAN deployments in many cases required only a one-time site survey. This is 
because wireless networking technology was fairly static and the RF dynamics of the loca-
tions in which these networks were installed did not change much. The main goal for early 

350 
Chapter 9 ■ Design for Wireless Networking
deployments was to provide adequate RF coverage. Thanks to the rapid pace at which 
wireless technology is growing and the increasing use of other devices that use unlicensed 
RF, however, site surveys can be an ongoing process for the areas where these wireless net-
works are installed. Although there are no set rules about when or how wireless site surveys 
should be performed, many manufacturers suggest guidelines based on the deployment sce-
narios for wireless networks using their equipment. Best practices and experience also play 
a role in the site survey process. 
 The term  wireless site survey can be subjective. A site survey may include walking an 
area to check for RF coverage and interference, planning for network capacity, and design-
ing the wireless network. A wireless site survey includes the following main objectives: 
 
■
 Evaluate areas for RF coverage. 
 
■
 Locate and mitigate any sources of RF interference. 
 
■
 Determine wireless network capacity requirements. 
 
■
 Decide on locations for hardware infrastructure devices. 
 
■
 Identify the antenna types to be used.
 
■
Evaluate the environmental conditions including RF propagation and attenuation. 
 
 It is important to understand that an RF site survey is not WLAN design, 
and WLAN design is not an RF site survey. A wireless RF site survey is a 
combination of processes and procedures used to create a WLAN design. 
 Site surveys vary in complexity, depending on the type of business or location in which 
a wireless network will be used. Many organizations are now designing wireless networks 
based on an average of three to four wireless mobile devices per user. The devices may 
include computers, smartphones, tablets, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices and can have 
a major impact on capacity planning. 
 Although there is no specifi c set of rules that must be followed, many manufacturers of 
wireless networking equipment have guidelines and suggestions when it comes to a wireless 
site survey and where this survey will fi t into the process of the design and implementation 
of a wireless network. 
 Knowing and understanding the expectations of the client or business in regard to a 
wireless installation is a critical part of a successful deployment. To understand client 
expectations, you have to gather much information. This means you will need to partici-
pate in interviews and meetings with all those who will be affected by the installation of 
the wireless network, which, in most cases, encompasses nearly all departments of the 
company. 
 The scope of the wireless site survey, capacity planning, and wireless network design is 
dependent on many factors, including the following: 
 
■
 Size of the physical location 
 
■
 Intended use of the wireless network

Size of the Physical Location
Depending on the size of the physical location where the wireless network will be installed, 
a complete wireless site survey may not be necessary, and the design will be straightforward. 
For example, a small sandwich shop wants to offer free wireless Internet access (a hotspot) 
as a convenience for its patrons. This sandwich shop is approximately 1,200 square feet 
(111 square meters), has seating for about 15 people, and is located in a small retail mall. In 
this case, a single access point would more than likely be sufficient for the number of users 
who access the wireless network at any one time and the type of data being sent across the 
access point to the Internet.
Although a full-blown physical site survey determining areas of RF interference, cover-
age, and capacity would more than likely not be required, it would still be beneficial to visit 
the location and determine the best place for the access point. In a situation like this, what 
could be called a “site survey lite” may be all that is necessary. This would include per-
forming some simple tests to determine the best RF channel to use as well as access point 
mounting, consideration of aesthetics, and connecting to the wired network for access to 
the Internet.
A larger installation will require a much more extensive site survey and may include 
either a manual RF site survey or a predictive modeling site survey using elaborate soft-
ware. Manual and predictive modeling site survey software will be discussed in more detail 
later in this chapter.
Intended Use of the Wireless Network
Looking at the sandwich shop scenario again, chances are the intended use of this wireless 
network will consist of patrons staying online for short periods of time and browsing the 
Internet, interacting with social media, or checking email. It is unlikely that many users 
would be performing any high-end or bandwidth-intensive applications on this type of con-
nection. Therefore, the single-access point model would be sufficient for this deployment, 
providing adequate wireless access and capacity. With larger installations, the use of the net-
work may include bandwidth-intensive applications, such as electronic imaging, computer-
aided design, graphics design, and database programs, which would impact the number of 

352 
Chapter 9  ■  Design for Wireless Networking  
access points required to provide adequate performance. Although not bandwidth-intensive, 
a Voice over Wireless LAN (VoWLAN) application may also have an impact on the number 
of access points because of the type of wireless traffic that is sent and received.
Number of Wireless Devices
The number of users and their wireless devices that will be accessing a wireless network 
is also a big factor in determining the number of access points required, which in turn 
will determine the scope of a site survey and will have an impact on the WLAN design. 
Many organizations plan on three to five wireless devices per user, including computers, 
smartphones, tablets, and others. It has already been established that in our sandwich shop 
example a single access point would be sufficient based on the size of the location and the 
intended use of the network. However, as the number of actual wireless-enabled devices 
increases and because of the added capacity requirements, the need for additional access 
points will also increase. When more than one access point is required, a more extensive 
wireless site survey is also required.
Wireless Client Device Capabilities
In addition to the number of users and their wireless client devices, it is important to under-
stand the type of client devices that will be connected to the wireless network and what 
those device capabilities are. For example, notebook computers or handheld devices, such 
as tablets and smartphones, all have specific functionality and will need to meet certain 
network requirements. Some client devices are multifunctional and include capabilities such 
as cellular voice, 3G, 4G, LTE, and Wi-Fi, which will need to be taken into consideration. 
The devices could be performing tasks as simple as basic web browsing or checking email. 
Other possible device types include Wi-Fi–enabled voice handsets that may need a dedi-
cated SSID for QoS functionality and may operate in the 5 GHz UNII bands, or even bar 
code scanners that will be keeping track of product inventory. With the advancements in 
wireless networking technology, such as the IEEE 802.11ac amendment, the device capa-
bilities including 5 GHz functionality must be closely evaluated.
Part of the wireless site survey planning process is to question the appropriate people 
regarding the types and capabilities of the wireless devices in use, to ensure that expecta-
tions of the users will be met. The following device capabilities are among those that need 
to be considered:
■
■
IEEE 802.11b/g/n, 2.4 GHz only
■
■
IEEE 802.11a or dual band, 2.4 GHz/5 GHz capable
■
■
IEEE 802.11n capable and the number of transmit and receive radio chains (for exam-
ple, 2x2 MIMO)
■
■
IEEE 802.11ac capable and the extended features 802.11ac technology provides
■
■
MIMO capabilities, such as the number of spatial streams, channel width, transmit 
beamforming, or multiuser MIMO

Future mobile device types that will be used with the wireless network must also be 
evaluated. Keep in mind that more devices are becoming dual band capable and in order to 
take advantage of newer technology such as IEEE 802.11ac, infrastructure support for the 
5 GHz band is mandatory. Expansion of the wireless network, new technology types that 
may be introduced based on the business model, and BYOD acceptance and use should be 
considered. Even so, some wireless devices, regardless of how new they are, may not have  
5 GHz capability and therefore will not operate in the 5 GHz U-NII bands. This is especially 
true with less expensive consumer-grade devices.
The Environment
Understanding the environment in which the wireless network will be installed and the 
wireless mobile devices that will be used within the environment are important factors that 
are sometimes overlooked. Different environments will have different concerns. For exam-
ple, areas that may have excess RF noise, areas with harsh environmental conditions (such 
as temperature fluctuations), or industrial areas have their own set of challenges. Different 
environments may have distinct types of challenges:
■
■
General office spaces: Walls and attenuation values
■
■
Office cube farms: User and device density
■
■
Health-care environments: Wireless medical and other interfering devices
■
■
Industrial areas: Reflections and machine shop equipment
■
■
Educational environments: High quantity of mobile devices
These are a few examples of different environments that may use IEEE 802.11 wireless 
networks and the challenges that will need to be considered as part of the wireless site 
survey. In Chapter 2, “Wireless Local Area Networking, Standards, and Certifications,” 
you learned about some of the various deployment scenarios for common wireless 
network types.
Performance Expectations
Keep in mind that IEEE 802.11 wireless networks are half-duplex, shared medium, and 
contention-based and that many factors will affect the performance of a wireless network, 
including the number and capabilities of wireless and mobile client devices, types of soft-
ware and hardware applications used, location, and the number of infrastructure devices 
providing access. These infrastructure devices include wireless access points and bridges. 
Part of a wireless site survey involves defining what the customer expects for performance of 
the network. A mutual understanding of the factors that affect performance as well as how 
they will be dealt with is imperative from the beginning of the wireless site survey process.

Bring Your Own Device Acceptance
With the number of IEEE 802.11–enabled wireless mobile devices continually growing, the 
need for increased wireless network capacity is a major concern. Bring your own device 
(BYOD) describes the recent increase in company employees bringing their own personal 
IEEE 802.11–capable mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, to their place of 
work and using these devices to access company resources, including the Internet, printers, 
software applications, and file servers. Take a moment and think about the number of IEEE 
802.11–enabled mobile devices you may have in your office or home. Any of the following 
devices would qualify:
■
■
Notebook computers
■
■
Smartphones
■
■
Tablet devices
■
■
Wireless printers
■
■
Wireless video cameras
■
■
Wireless household appliances
■
■
DVD or Blu-ray players
■
■
Wireless-capable gaming devices
■
■
Wireless-capable televisions
These are just some of the devices that are used daily and are now IEEE 802.11 wireless 
capable. A family of four people may have as many as 20 wireless devices in the home, and 
this number will likely increase as wireless technology continues to advance due to devel-
opments such as IEEE 802.11ah, IoT, and so on. When companies or organizations allow 
employees to bring their personal wireless devices to the office or place of work, that opens 
up an entire set of potential issues, including security, technical support, and wireless infra-
structure capacity concerns.
If employees are allowed to bring their own devices to their place of business, you must 
take this into consideration when performing an RF site survey and designing a wireless 
network. Because IEEE 802.11 wireless networks are contention based and use a shared 
medium, the added number of devices will impact the performance if the network is not 
properly designed. Higher density and wireless networks that support BYOD may require 
smaller RF cells and additional wireless access points in order to offer adequate perfor-
mance for the number of connected devices. In addition to the load factor, the types of 
technology used—IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n and IEEE 802.11ac—will have an impact on the 
need for backward compatibility. Figure 9.1 shows how a number of personal devices can 
have an impact on the capacity of a wireless network.

Building Age and Construction Materials
It is important to identify the age of the building and the materials that were used for its 
construction. RF propagation is required for adequate coverage and desired signal strength. 
In older buildings it may be difficult to determine what materials the walls consist of based 
on the building practices at the time of construction. If an RF signal does not propagate 
sufficiently, additional access points may be required for adequate coverage and capac-
ity requirements. Newer buildings will have lighter and thinner yet stronger construction 
materials that may make it easier for an RF signal to penetrate. In addition, covering an 
office with open space and cubicles will be easier than covering a hotel or enclosed areas 
with many rooms and walls. Coverage is just one part of the equation. Network capacity 
must also be considered and is discussed later in this chapter.
Network Infrastructure Devices
It is important to factor in network infrastructure devices, such as Ethernet switches. For 
example, installing 500 access points in a hospital will require 500 Ethernet switch ports to 
connect the access points. It is unlikely that a hospital or any organization for that matter 
will have 500 open and available Ethernet ports and therefore will not be capable of sup-
porting the required wired network capacity needed for the wireless network installation. 

356 
Chapter 9  ■  Design for Wireless Networking  
Also, considering the access points will be installed throughout the building, it is important 
to note where the wiring closets are and how many Ethernet switches and ports will be 
required per wiring closet. When you’re running twisted-pair Ethernet cabling, the access 
point must be within 100 meters (328 feet) of the wiring closet. The access points will be 
powered using Power over Ethernet (PoE), so choosing a proper PoE source is critical. In 
addition, it is important to ensure that the wiring closets have adequate supply power to sup-
port additional Ethernet switches and the PoE they will provide to the connected devices.
A wireless engineer conducting a wireless site survey will also work with the wired 
network engineers. Adding 500 access points and many additional wireless mobile client 
devices will increase traffic to and from the WAN and Internet. The network infrastruc-
ture devices will need the capacity to handle to additional traffic.
Gathering Business Requirements
Gathering information is typically the first step of wireless network design and implementa-
tion. The business model or type of business where the wireless network will be deployed 
is a major part of deciding the level of a wireless site survey. The type of business will 
determine the needs and use of a wireless network. Knowing the applications used—both 
hardware (such as VoWLAN) and software (such as accessing a database)—is a critical part 
of a wireless deployment because this will affect recommendations, such as the number 
and locations of access points. Expectations can make or break a wireless deployment. The 
expectations of the wireless network must be discussed, evaluated, and documented up 
front. To completely understand what the customer expects, you will need to gather infor-
mation from various areas of the business. A high-quality site survey requires many ques-
tions to be asked and answered, including the following:
Bandwidth and Capacity Needs    How much bandwidth will users of the wireless network 
require? The types of applications in use will have an impact on this. How many wireless 
devices per user? Most manufacturers have wireless design guides that you can reference for 
various deployment scenarios.
Coverage Area    In what rooms or areas of the buildings is wireless coverage expected? Is 
coverage limited to indoors only, or will outdoor coverage also be required? Many busi-
nesses want coverage over the entire location.
Applications Used    What types of applications—either hardware or software—are used at 
the facility? How will the applications affect the performance? This may include computer-
aided design, digital imaging, databases, and VoWLAN.
Wireless Devices Used    What types of wireless client devices will be used? Are the devices 
multifunctional? These include notebook computers, handheld scanners, smartphones, 
­tablets, and other devices, both company owned and employee owned (BYOD).
Desired IEEE 802.11 Technologies    What type of IEEE 802.11 infrastructure devices 
(IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n, IEEE 802.11ac, and IEEE 802.11ah) would be best suited to the 
­specific environment and deployment?

Gathering Business Requirements 
357  
IEEE 802.11 wireless networks were once primarily used as extensions of wired net-
works, providing access to a few users in areas exceeding the physical distance of an 
Ethernet or other wired medium. IEEE 802.11 wireless technology continues to evolve 
and is now a major part of every area in a business, corporation, or company’s com-
puter network infrastructure. It is difficult to find any business or organization that 
does not provide some type of IEEE 802.11 wireless network access. Fully understand-
ing the business requirements is part of a successful wireless network site survey and 
deployment.
General Office/Enterprise
Office buildings and other enterprise installation locations may consist of walled offices or 
open spaces with many cubicles. This type of installation usually will require infrastructure 
devices to aesthetically fit the environment and may require antennas to be mounted to 
drop ceilings with the access points located out of sight. Figure 9.2 shows an example of a 
floor plan for a small office deployment.
F i g u r e  9. 2     A small office wireless network installation using omnidirectional 
antennas
Some installations may have a high density of wireless mobile devices and therefore 
require more access points to handle the number of wireless devices connected to the net-
work. The software and hardware applications used in these environments will need to be 
closely evaluated to ensure optimal performance for the user base. Chances are that inter-
ference sources in this type of deployment would be limited mostly to computer network-
ing, and RF challenges may be limited.

Chapter 9  ■  Design for Wireless Networking  
Interviewing Stakeholders
Understanding the intended use of a wireless network is a critical part of a successful 
deployment. And who better to explain what the wireless network will be used for than 
those who will be using it? Those performing a site survey may not necessarily understand 
the functional aspects of a certain type of business, so it is critical to get input from every-
one who will be using the wireless network. Department managers, business unit manag-
ers, and team leaders usually know the function of their specific areas of the organization 
the best. Therefore, they will also know the needs and requirements of users of the wireless 
network and how a successful deployment will help increase job productivity.
We recommend that you create some type of checklist or formal site survey question-
naire to use during the interview process. This will ensure that specific details about the 
business and proposed wireless deployment are not missed. The use of such forms helps 
ensure uniform, repeatable interviews. The forms can also become part of the documenta-
tion and final deliverable that will be presented to the customer. Although there are some 
general questions that can be asked, there will be more specific questions based on the busi-
ness model of the organization or the wireless network to be installed. Figure 9.3 shows an 
example of notes that can be taken during the information gathering stage and the wireless 
site survey specifics.
F i g u r e  9. 3    Sample checklist showing some information collected for a wireless 
site survey
The following list includes some generic interview questions that will pertain to most 
wireless network installations:
Has a site survey ever been performed in the past?    It is good to know whether a site sur-
vey has previously been performed at a location. Although the previous site survey is only 
as good as the people who performed it, it may be beneficial and a timesaver to have some 

Interviewing Stakeholders 
359  
information available. Depending on when it was performed, a previous site survey report 
may not be accurate because, for example, physical changes to the location may have taken 
place, such as additions of rooms or walls or changes to the interior design.
Are blueprints, floor plans, or any other site-specific documentation available?     
Blueprints, floor plans, or other documentation about the location are critical in perform-
ing an RF wireless site survey. If this information is not available, it may have to be created, 
which in turn would create an additional expense for the company or customer. The accu-
racy of these documents needs to be considered in order to provide ideal site survey results.
How many wireless mobile devices and users will be using the wireless network? What 
are the bandwidth and capacity requirements?    The number of devices expected to be on 
the wireless network is valuable information to have. Knowing the number of devices and 
users will help determine the amount of infrastructure equipment, such as access points 
and wireless bridges, that will be required for the deployment. Discussing with department 
managers the number of devices and users on the network as well as the number of work-
ing shifts will help provide adequate planning. It will also be beneficial to know whether 
users are allowed to bring their own devices.
Will guest access be required?    If guest access to the wireless network is required, that will 
potentially affect the number of infrastructure devices such as access points required for the 
deployment. Depending on the type of access, network capacity will need to be considered. 
In addition to the equipment, you should take into account security, the captive portal, and 
backward compatibility.
Is there any preference for a specific manufacturer’s equipment?    It is a recommended 
practice for a site survey to be performed with the same manufacturer’s equipment that will 
be used in the deployment. Therefore, customer preference for equipment manufacturers 
must be determined at the initial phases of the site survey. This will ensure good results 
based on the design of the wireless network.
What is the coverage area?    The intended coverage area of the facility also needs to be 
addressed. This helps provide a surveyor with information to accurately estimate how long 
a physical site survey may take and roughly estimate the amount of hardware required. 
Knowing the coverage area will also help determine any unexpected obstacles that may 
occur as part of the site survey process.
Is an existing IEEE 802.11 wireless network in place?    If an existing IEEE 802.11 wireless 
network is in place, it needs to be addressed as part of the site survey process. The follow-
ing questions need to be asked:
■
■
Which technology is currently in use, IEEE 802.11a, IEEE 802.11b/g, IEEE 
802.11n, or IEEE 802.11ac?
■
■
How many wireless devices and users does the network currently support?
■
■
Where are the existing access points located?
■
■
Are the existing access points and external antennas installed correctly?
■
■
What is the wireless network used for?

360 
Chapter 9  ■  Design for Wireless Networking  
Knowing the answers to these and other questions will help determine the role, if any, that 
the existing IEEE 802.11 wireless network will play in the new deployment. Keep in mind 
that some organizations may have quite an extensive existing wireless network and may be 
in the process of upgrading to newer or different technology. If this is the case, it will need 
to be determined whether any of the existing network components can or will be used with 
the new deployment. Photographs of existing equipment used in a deployment are always 
useful. Figure 9.4 shows a photograph of an existing IEEE 802.11a/b/g access point with an 
incorrect installation of diversity antennas. If this were a new or updated installation and 
external antennas were used, the antennas would need to be set to the proper spacing based 
on the technology in use such as IEEE 802.11n/ac.

Are there any known areas of RF interference?    Information regarding known areas of RF 
interference is useful in a site survey. It will save time if previous knowledge of RF interfer-
ence is made available as part of the site survey process. Keep in mind that interference 
may change and can be detected only at the time of testing or when a manual site survey is 
performed.
Are there any known areas that may lack RF coverage?    Just as previous knowledge of 
areas affected by RF interference is valuable, the lack of RF coverage in specific areas is 
also good to know. This will help a surveyor determine any special situations that may 
be addressed during the site survey process. Testing of various types of antennas may be 
required to help provide RF coverage in areas that are currently lacking. Available coverage 
maps may also be useful.

Interviewing Stakeholders 
361  
What type of applications will be used?    It is important to know the types of applications 
that will be used. Applications—either software or hardware—will affect the load and 
number of access points or other infrastructure devices required. These applications 
include bandwidth-intensive software, VoWLAN, and so on. The surveyor should also 
become familiar with any special circumstances that may be required to support these 
applications—for example, the frequency or IEEE 802.11 technology that may be required 
for the wireless devices to operate.
Will VoWi-Fi or other real-time applications that require QoS be used?    If applications 
(such as VoWi-Fi handsets) are planned for the location, they will have an impact on the 
site survey and design of the wireless network. Because this type of application has greater 
requirements for signal quality, signal strength, and fast transition, this will need to be 
taken into consideration during the site survey. Additional density and more access points 
may be required.
Real-time video communications, such as a videoconference calls over a wireless network 
connection, is another application that may require QoS. Like voice, real-time video is sub-
ject to latency and may involve special design requirements. Real-time video over a wireless 
connection is used in applications ranging from sports venues to security surveillance and 
monitoring.
Is wireless transition (roaming) required?    In most cases, with newer technology, the 
answer to this question is yes. This is especially true with networks that will be using 
Wi-Fi-capable voice handsets. Voice handsets are among the most commonly used wireless 
mobile devices that require seamless roaming and secure transition capabilities. Although 
notebook computers and tablets may require transitioning, real-time voice and video appli-
cations are subject to latency issues. Fast, secure transitions may also be required for roam-
ing. If so, the amount of overlap between RF cells would need to be closely looked at to 
ensure reliable sessions for the devices connected to the network.
Is PoE required?    In all medium-to-large installations, the answer to this question is yes. 
Understanding the PoE requirements is another essential part of the wireless site survey. The 
capabilities of the network devices as well as the number of devices expected to use PoE—
including wireless access points, hardwired Ethernet IP phones, and security cameras—will 
play a role in the design and types of equipment used in the wireless network.
What are the wireless security requirements?    Although security is not necessarily part of 
an RF site survey or design, as much information as possible on the security requirements is 
helpful with the design of the wireless network. Some security solutions may require addi-
tional hardware, such as sensors that are used with a wireless intrusion prevention system 
(WIPS) or software that would have to be taken into account for the network design.
Will an escort and ID badge be required?    In many cases, people are not allowed to roam 
freely throughout a business. An escort might be and usually is needed to walk through a 
location with an outside contract site surveyor. In addition, the escort and surveyor will 
need access to areas that may be locked or secure, such as wiring closets and computer 
rooms. Escorts may be from various parts of the company, hospital, or organization, 

362 
Chapter 9  ■  Design for Wireless Networking  
including facilities, information technology, medical staff, and security. Depending on 
the organization, proper paperwork for access may need to be submitted ahead of time to 
allow for adequate processing time. For example, you don’t want to show up on a Monday 
morning only to find out it will take hours or even days to process the paperwork needed to 
get an ID badge for access.
Are there any compliance requirements?    Depending on the type of business in which the 
wireless network will be installed, there may be legislative or other compliance require-
ments. For example, medical institutions may have to meet HIPAA requirements, and retail 
establishments may require PCI compliance. These need to be taken into consideration as 
part of a wireless site survey and deployment.
Are you following corporate policies?    If one exists, you should use a written corporate 
policy as a guideline or offer suggestions for changes in the policy to accommodate other 
wireless requirements. The wireless site survey questioning process should bring any policy-
related issues to light for discussion and/or change if needed.
Manufacturer Guidelines and Deployment Guides
The information just presented includes some types of questions that need to be addressed 
during the site survey process. Keep in mind that the actual questions and details depend 
on the business model and the implementation of the wireless network. For site survey and 
deployment guides, check with the manufacturer of the equipment that you will use. These 
guides will provide additional helpful information for generating a list of questions and 
concerns that will need to be addressed.
Gathering Site-Specific Documentation
Documentation for the location where a wireless network will be installed will make a sur-
veyor’s job much easier and result in a smoother overall deployment. Drawings and other 
documentation pertaining to the following items can provide valuable information:
■
■
Floor plans
■
■
Blueprints
■
■
Proposed location of furnishings

Floor Plans and Blueprints
Gathering any site-specific documentation that exists, such as floor plans or blueprints, is 
extremely helpful for a site survey. This documentation is useful to a variety of individuals 
who will be participating in a wireless network design and deployment. The documentation

can be used during a physical or predictive RF site survey and spectrum analysis to note 
areas of importance and concerns. Having floor plans and blueprints available allows a sur-
veyor to document specific parts of a site survey, such as the location of access points and 
other wireless devices. If a predictive modeling site survey is used, an electronic version of a 
floor plan can be imported into the software program to help streamline the surveyor’s job. 
The standard formats for floor plan (map) files vary from product to product for most mod-
eling software, but they typically include DWG, PDF, JPG, PNG, GIF, and TIF. Figure 9.5 
shows a site survey software program that allows for various file formats to be imported.

Blueprints or floor plans will also help those who install cable and mount hardware and 
can be provided to electricians for AC power installation, if necessary.
Furnishings
The proposed types and location of furnishings or other items that may affect RF signal 
propagation or penetration are also good to know. This will help during the design and 
site survey phase to determine access point locations and pinpoint other things that may 
affect RF signals, such as reflection, refraction, diffraction, and absorption. Unfortunately, 
most floor plan documents do not specify this kind of information, because in many cases 
furnishings are not permanent fixtures and can change. Some organizations will have this 

364 
Chapter 9  ■  Design for Wireless Networking  
information stored in asset documentation using spreadsheets or databases. Many times it 
will be up to the surveyor to determine where the furnishings or equipment are located and 
the effect it may have on the RF.
Keep the following in mind when gathering information about the types and location of 
furnishings:
■
■
In an office or enterprise environment, furnishings may consist of desks, cabinets, 
chairs, and other items.
■
■
In warehousing and retail environments, furnishings will include storage racks and 
shelving as well as product inventories.
■
■
In manufacturing environments, information should be gathered about the location of 
industrial equipment used in the manufacturing process and about equipment used to 
move products throughout the factory.
■
■
In medical environments, furnishings or equipment will include devices that may cause 
interference and operate in the same RF range as the proposed wireless network. Stor-
age of items used within the hospital or medical environment for patients and employ-
ees may also affect RF coverage.
■
■
In educational environments, the location of lockers and internal windows is important 
to note, as are the types of materials used in the walls, such as concrete blocks with 
and/or without sound dampening material inside. All these factors will have an effect 
on the RF propagation.
These are just some examples of the types of furnishings and other items that may affect 
a wireless network deployment and are factors to consider.
Electrical Specifications
Documentation of the electrical specifications of the environment is helpful in determin-
ing whether the current electrical implementation will be sufficient to handle the proposed 
wireless network deployment. This will allow the site survey process to determine whether 
any upgrades need to be made to support devices that may be using PoE or whether the 
existing infrastructure is sufficient. It is best to gather information regarding electrical 
power sources, electrical panels, existing wiring, and the locations of electrical outlets.
Existing Network Characteristics
Documentation is a major part of any business, including documentation of computer 
networks. In order to have a successful deployment of a wireless network, it is critical to 
know the details of the existing network infrastructure as well as future implementations, 
upgrades, and modifications. These existing infrastructures may include a wired or wire-
less network already in place and functioning that may be upgraded or in a new deploy-
ment. Figure 9.6 shows a floor plan with an existing wireless deployment of only two access 
points providing wireless access for the conference rooms. This information can be used as 
part of the new wireless site survey and network design.

The following list includes some of the questions that you should take into consideration 
when performing a wireless site survey:
■
■
In what RF range will the new wireless network operate?
■
■
Are there any existing IEEE 802.11 wireless networks in the same RF space?
■
■
Will all or part of the existing wireless network be used in the new deployment?
■
■
What effect will the neighboring wireless networks have on this deployment?
Ignoring existing IEEE 802.11 wireless networks will have a significant impact on how a 
new wireless network will operate and result in poor performance for the clients or devices 
that will be connecting.

366 
Chapter 9  ■  Design for Wireless Networking  
Documentation of networks is usually the responsibility of the IT department. Some 
organizations may lack good documentation of the existing network infrastructure. If this 
is the case, additional work may be required prior to starting a wireless site survey.
Existing IEEE 802.11 Wireless Networks    The scope of any existing wireless networks 
must be determined during the interview process. If a wireless network does exist (as it 
often does), it will need to be dealt with during the site survey and design procedure. The 
questions that are asked regarding the existing wireless network will help determine the 
role it is going to play. If the existing network is going to remain in place, understanding 
its technical details and how to work it into the design of the new or upgraded deployment 
will help you create a successful and productive wireless network deployment.
Existing IEEE 802.3 or Other Wired Networks    In addition to knowing of any existing 
wireless networks, you should know about the wired network infrastructure. Existing 
documentation on the wired network infrastructure will help streamline the process for 
connecting the IEEE 802.11 wireless components of the network. The wired infrastructure 
is discussed in more detail in the next section of this chapter.
Existing wireless networks play a big role in a new wireless network deployment. 
Understanding the current location of infrastructure and other wireless network devices is 
an important part of a wireless site survey. One way to see devices that are part of a wireless 
network is to use a protocol analyzer. Other programs, such as MetaGeek inSSIDer or Xirrus 
Wi-Fi Inspector, will also be able to view existing wireless networks. In some cases, these 
programs may be adequate based on the complexity and size of the site survey. But they typi-
cally do not have the extensive feature set that many protocol analyzer packages have.
Identifying Infrastructure Connectivity 
and Power Requirements
Why are there so many wires in wireless networking? Wireless networks require some type 
of wired infrastructure for many reasons, including connecting access points together, 
allowing wireless device and user access to network resources, providing access to a  
WAN, allowing Internet connectivity, and supplying electrical power.
Network infrastructure connectivity plays a big role in wireless networking. A wireless 
site survey will require additional information about the network infrastructure and power 
requirements. In a sense, a wireless site survey also requires a wired or infrastructure survey. 
A wireless site survey should include information about the wired network, including the 
location of the wiring closet, the wired infrastructure network devices in use, the connection 
speed between sites, and the electrical power requirement:
Location of Wiring Closets    A wiring closet is a room (usually secured) containing electri-
cal power and cabling for voice and data and that is terminated and connected to infra-
structure devices, such as switches and routers. In most cases, these locations are noted on 

Identifying Infrastructure Connectivity and Power Requirements 
367  
the floor plan or blueprint documents, but that may not always be the case, and you will 
need to find them if they are not noted. When deploying a wireless network, you should 
know not only the physical locations of wiring closets but also the capacity of existing 
infrastructure devices. This is important because wired connections, such as IEEE 802.3 
Ethernet, have specific limits for cable lengths, and infrastructure devices, such as access 
points and bridges, will have to be placed within these physical limits of infrastructure con-
nectivity. For example, the IEEE 802.3 Ethernet standard has a physical maximum cable 
length of 328 feet (or 100 meters) for unshielded twisted-pair wiring.
In addition to cable length, the feasibility of running the Ethernet cable from the wiring 
closet to the desired location must be considered. For example, the intended location for 
an access point may be on a ceiling without any access from above. In this case, the lack 
of accessibility could pose a problem for the installation of the Ethernet cabling from the 
­wiring closet and/or AC power to the devices.
Wired Infrastructure Network Devices in Use    The wired infrastructure devices in use 
may have an impact on a successful deployment of a wireless network. An evaluation of the 
infrastructure devices by a WLAN site surveyor or a network infrastructure professional 
may be required to determine if any additional hardware is needed or if changes must be 
made prior to deploying a WLAN. If the infrastructure devices, such as Layer 2 switches 
and routers, are not adequate to support a new wireless deployment, additional hardware 
may need to be purchased.
Connection Speed between Sites    The connection speeds and type of connections between 
sites should be evaluated to determine if there are any bottlenecks that could affect the 
overall network performance. The placement of authentication servers and other network 
resources may be affected by the speed of these links.
Electrical Power    Since all wireless network infrastructure devices, including access points, 
bridges, and wireless switches, require an AC power source, and because these devices may 
be supplying PoE to the infrastructure devices, verification of an adequate AC power supply 
must be performed. The AC power sources are sometimes taken for granted or not taken 
into consideration, which could pose a problem during the installation phase. It is also 
important to determine what local ordinances may apply and what they allow you to do for 
a wireless network installation.
Because PoE is used not only in infrastructure devices but also with IP telephones, secu-
rity cameras, and user devices, it may be necessary to perform calculations and verify that 
the power supply to the wiring closet will be adequate to support the powered infrastruc-
ture (including the PoE devices). Electrical components of a wiring closet may need to be 
upgraded to support a new wireless network deployment. Newer wireless networking tech-
nologies, such as 802.11ac MIMO systems, may require more DC power than is available 
with the IEEE 802.3af PoE amendment to the Ethernet standard.
If these technologies will be used, the power requirements will need to be carefully con-
sidered to verify that enough DC power will be available to the endpoint powered devices. 
Manufacturers now provide IEEE 802.3at (with new PoE capabilities) endpoint or midspan 

368 
Chapter 9  ■  Design for Wireless Networking  
devices to provide the necessary amount of DC voltage for certain PoE-capable devices. 
All manufacturers of enterprise dual-band IEEE 802.11n wireless access points claim 
their equipment will operate with standard 802.3af power. You should read the specifica-
tion data sheet for the access point, WIPS sensor, or other wireless infrastructure device 
to determine the type of PoE required and whether IEEE 802.3af or IEEE 802.3at will be 
required to provide DC power to the device.
It is important to understand that wireless infrastructure devices require some sort of 
wired connectivity for data and electrical power. Data access will usually come by way 
of an Ethernet connection from a wired network infrastructure or backbone. As stated 
in the IEEE 802.3 Ethernet standard, the maximum length for unshielded twisted-pair 
Ethernet cable is 328 feet, or 100 meters. This limitation may have an impact on how and 
where access points and other infrastructure devices are placed.
During the wireless site survey process, the surveyor will need access to wiring closets. 
This will allow the surveyor to evaluate and perform a survey of the wired network infra-
structure as well.
Another consideration is electrical power requirements. Infrastructure devices need 
electrical power as well as data connectivity to operate. If the electrical power is decen-
tralized and located at each device, an electrician will need to evaluate and determine the 
requirements.
PoE is an option for supplying electrical power to infrastructure devices. This technol-
ogy is now very common and is supported by all enterprise device manufacturers. A survey 
of the wired infrastructure and devices is almost always required to determine if the infra-
structure will be capable of handling the new PoE devices that will be installed. Keep in 
mind that zoning and building regulations, electrical contractors, and labor union require-
ments may add to the overall cost of wireless deployment. PoE was discussed in Chapter 3, 
“Infrastructure and Client Devices Used with Wireless Networking.”
Understanding Application Requirements
Understanding the requirements for software applications is another important part of a 
successful wireless deployment. The types and number of applications used will affect the 
performance and the capacity of an IEEE 802.11 wireless network. Some software applica-
tions are very bandwidth intensive and will require more resources than others to perform 
effectively as designed. Examples of these applications are streaming video, computer-aided 
design (CAD), and database programs. By contrast, applications used for email, social 
media (if policy allows), and casual Internet browsing are not bandwidth intensive.
Because digital imaging, graphic design, CAD, and database applications can have a 
tremendous effect on the performance of a wireless network, they require special attention 
when the network is designed. The infrastructure resources that will be impacted include 
the processing power and memory capacity of the wireless access points, and the speed  
of the wired infrastructure itself, such as 100 Mbps or 1,000 Mbps (gigabit).

Client Connectivity Requirements 
369  
This, in turn, will affect the site survey and network design. The wireless site survey will 
be impacted because the location where the wireless network is installed may require more 
infrastructure devices or access points. Other applications, such as VoWLAN, may introduce 
another entire set of issues. This type of deployment may use only the 5 GHz band for wire-
less voice technology, and therefore the wireless site survey must be performed accordingly.
Understanding Radio Frequency 
Coverage and Capacity Requirements
A major aspect of a wireless site survey is to understand and verify the RF coverage and 
capacity requirements based on the network design. A wireless network site surveyor will 
need to verify these requirements as part of the site survey. This can be accomplished either 
manually or automatically through a predictive modeling process, both of which will be 
discussed in more detail later in this chapter.
To review, the wireless coverage and capacity requirements depend on the following 
factors:
■
■
Physical size of the area to be covered
■
■
Number of users or devices accessing the wireless network, including BYOD users
■
■
Software or hardware applications in use
■
■
Obstacles and propagation factors based on the environment
■
■
RF range of the network to be installed
■
■
Wireless network hardware to be used
■
■
Output RF power of the transmitters
■
■
Receive sensitivity of the receivers
In addition to an RF coverage analysis, an RF spectrum analysis will be beneficial. An 
RF spectrum analysis allows a site surveyor to view areas of RF coverage as well as inter-
ference sources and non-IEEE 802.11 wireless devices. This topic will be discussed later in 
this chapter. Although a spectrum analysis is not required, it does allow a site surveyor to 
view sources of RF in the locations where a wireless network will be deployed.
Client Connectivity Requirements
The wireless client devices that will be connecting to the wireless network also need to be 
considered as part of a site survey. This includes knowing the radio type, antenna type, 
gain, orientation, portability, and mobility of the devices. Keep in mind that a wireless cli-
ent device is both an RF transmitter and a receiver. The client (receiver) must be able to 

370 
Chapter 9  ■  Design for Wireless Networking  
hear the transmitter, and the transmitter must be able to hear the client. The RF cell size 
will vary from device to device. It is beneficial to survey with the type of devices that will 
be used with the wireless network whenever possible. Understanding the type and function 
of client devices will have an impact on the design of the wireless network. The following 
wireless client devices are commonly used in a wireless network:
■
■
Notebook computers
■
■
Tablets
■
■
Pocket computers
■
■
Smartphones
■
■
Bar code scanners
■
■
Point-of-sale devices
■
■
Voice handsets
Other wireless devices used in various wireless applications include but are not limited 
to the following:
■
■
Desktop computers
■
■
Printers and print servers
■
■
Manufacturing equipment
■
■
IEEE 802.11–friendly video cameras
Many environments have both desktop and notebook computers as wireless client 
devices. These devices may or may not require roaming capability. Office and enterprise 
deployments commonly use handsets for voice communications. Although it is fairly dif-
ficult to take all potential wireless client devices into consideration, it is best to understand 
the types of devices that will be used. This information can be obtained through the inter-
view process and the information gathering stage of the site survey.
Antenna Use Considerations
Chapter 4, “Radio Frequency Fundamentals for Wireless Networking,” discussed various 
types of antennas and accessories. The antenna used in any wireless network installation 
will depend on the specific scenario. As part of the site survey, various antenna types may 
need to be used for testing purposes to determine the best antenna for a specific applica-
tion. In some cases, the customer may want a specific type of antenna, such as an omnidi-
rectional antenna mounted directly to the access points. Others may be using access points 
without external antenna capabilities.
Some businesses are concerned about aesthetics and are particular about the appearance 
of an antenna and the mounting location. The proper antenna selection will ensure correct 
coverage as intended by the design and site survey of the wireless network. The antenna 
type used will determine the propagation pattern of the RF and is a significant part of a 

Antenna Use Considerations 
371  
successful wireless deployment. The antenna used in various deployments will depend on 
the business model in which the network is installed:
General Office/Enterprise    General office/enterprise solutions usually require complete 
coverage throughout the entire location. In many cases, this type of installation will require 
access points mounted out of sight and aesthetically pleasing antennas. This could be an 
omnidirectional antenna mounted to a ceiling tile or integrated within an access point.
Manufacturing    Manufacturing environments are usually industrial facilities with high 
ceilings and various types of manufacturing and industrial equipment. These environments 
may use a combination of omnidirectional and semidirectional antennas due to the physical 
architecture of the buildings. The antennas also may need to withstand harsh environmen-
tal conditions such as extreme temperature fluctuations and dirt.
Warehousing    Warehousing implementations have some characteristics in common with 
manufacturing. The buildings that house this type of business are in many cases large open 
areas with high ceilings to allow the storage of large volumes of product and equipment. 
Antenna mounting needs to be looked at very closely to ensure that equipment such as fork-
lifts used to move product do not come in contact and damage antennas. Warehousing also 
may use a combination of omnidirectional and semidirectional antennas for proper cover-
age. Figure 9.7 shows a sample floor plan for a combination small office/warehouse deploy-
ment using a combination of omnidirectional and semidirectional antennas.
F i g u r e  9.7     Small office/warehouse floor plan showing RF coverage using different 
antenna types
Retail/Point-of-Sale    Retail/point-of-sale (PoS) installations may have to accommodate 
publicly accessible areas as well as warehousing and storage in the back of the buildings. In 
this type of installation, antennas will be a combination of omnidirectional and semidirec-
tional. The devices may consist of computers as well as other handhelds, such as wireless 
bar code scanners or portable wireless devices. Appropriate antenna selection and gain 

372 
Chapter 9 ■ Design for Wireless Networking
need to be considered to ensure that the devices have good signal connectivity to the infra-
structure. In many cases, the public areas will require aesthetics to be taken into account 
in antenna selection. In the storage part of the building, antennas are similar to those 
described in “Warehousing.” 
Health Care and Medical  Many health-care and medical deployments are publicly acces-
sible, so aesthetics and security are both important. Antenna types that fi t the environment 
and are not accessible to the public are commonly used. Some health-care facilities, such 
as hospitals, may require the use of only omnidirectional antennas mounted to the autono-
mous access point or integrated into an access point. Others may allow semidirectional 
antennas, such as a Yagi, to cover long hallways and corridors. 
 Government and Military  Government and military wireless environments are usually not 
publicly accessible and in many cases are campus-based deployments that require outdoor as 
well as indoor solutions. In these installations, antennas mounted directly to an access point 
or semidirectional antennas may well fi t the environment. For outdoor point-to-point or 
point-to-multipoint, highly directional antennas, such as parabolic dishes, may be required. 
 Education  Education deployments are typically campus-based deployments and may 
require the use of outdoor antennas to connect buildings together. However, for indoor 
solutions, ensuring that the antennas will fi t the environment and not be tampered with is 
important. These deployments may use a combination of omnidirectional and semidirec-
tional antenna types. Some locations may require the use of enclosures for the infrastruc-
ture devices to ensure security of the physical devices. In these cases, special connectors and 
antenna adapters may be required. 
 Public Access, Hotspot, and Hospitality  Public access, hotspot, and hospitality sites are 
publicly accessible locations that will require aesthetics and security when it comes to 
antenna selection, as with some of the previous examples. These deployments can use a 
combination of omnidirectional, semidirectional, and highly directional antennas. 
 
 Another consideration when choosing an antenna is that the wireless 
system must comply with the rules set forth by the local regulatory 
agency. Before installing an antenna, verify that it will not violate any RF 
regulations. 
 Typical Steps used in a Wireless Site Survey 
 Here are some basic steps to provide an overview of the wireless site survey process. 
Keep in mind that these steps may vary slightly based on the location and the type of 
wireless network deployment. 
 1. 
 Gathering Information and Discussing Business Requirements: Determine the need 
and intended use of the wireless network and interview appropriate individuals. 

Antenna Use Considerations 
373  
Explain the site survey process and provide an overview of wireless networking. 
Doing so will help minimize unnecessary delays caused by people who are not 
included in the process but should have been and are unaware of the wireless 
network and site survey.
2.	
Project Timeline and Planning: Understand and document the extent and estimated 
timeline of the survey process and deployment. This will include all stages of the 
wireless site survey from start to finish, such as design, deployment, and verification. 
Because the wireless site survey may include people from many different areas, such 
as facilities, IT, engineering, and so on, everyone must be on the same track.
3.	
Site Visit and Pre-design Audit: It is a good idea to make a visit to the location to get 
an idea of any issues that may not be visible on a blueprint or floor plan. This will 
also allow for checking the RF propagation with a test access point if feasible. Per-
forming a wireless site survey without a site visit—especially a predictive modeling 
survey—can be done, but that will come with some risks. Knowing what you are deal-
ing with will minimize mistakes caused by not knowing the environment and there-
fore possibly making inaccurate assumptions.
4.	
Wireless Network Design: Determine areas of RF coverage and interference as well 
as potential placement of access points and other infrastructure devices. This will be 
done with an onsite manual site survey, a predictive modeling site survey, or a com-
bination of both. An RF spectrum analyzer can be used to view the air to determine 
the areas of RF interference.
5.	
RF Spectrum Analysis and RF Testing: Perform testing of the proposed design 
and verify RF sources of interference. Also verify coverage and lack of coverage. 
Although an RF spectrum analysis is not a required part of the wireless site survey 
process, it is highly recommended. Knowing the potential RF interference may 
impact the wireless network design as a whole. It will be much easier to deal with 
potential RF issues up front rather than after the wireless network is deployed. Test-
ing specific areas or audit points with an access point will allow the surveyor to 
determine the coverage and how the RF propagates from the access point.
6.	
Deployment of Infrastructure Devices: Install the infrastructure devices as described 
by the design. This may or may not be done by the same person who performed the 
wireless site survey, and in many cases it is not. This means that clear, concise docu-
mentation and instructions must be provided to the installer. This will reduce the risk 
of having to make unnecessary visits back to the location for corrections or adjust-
ments because of mistakes that could have been avoided.
7.	
Verification of RF Coverage: Perform verification testing and spot checks of RF cover-
age per the design. Make necessary adjustments based on the results of RF testing. 
Verification testing may consist of spot checks in key areas (audit points) or could 
include the entire facility. It is important to be certain the wireless network will oper-
ate as designed. Sometimes cost or budget may not allow for a verification of the 
entire location, but I recommend it whenever possible. If the entire area cannot be 

374 
Chapter 9  ■  Design for Wireless Networking  
checked, determining the audit points should be done carefully and should be com-
pleted in the early stages of the site survey. If needed, make adjustments to allow the 
wireless network to operate as designed.
8.	
Support: Provide technical support for wireless network deployment. This involves 
maintaining the wireless network infrastructure and includes RF spectrum monitor-
ing and making the necessary adjustments to adapt to the dynamics of environment. 
This can be done manually or automatically, depending on the capabilities of the 
technology that is deployed.
The Physical Radio Frequency Site 
Survey Process
After all the up-front work is completed, such as gathering information (including the busi-
ness requirements and site-specific documentation), defining physical and data security 
requirements, and interviewing managers and users, it is time to start the physical RF site 
survey process and the wireless network design. This is one of the most important parts of 
a successful wireless network deployment. This process includes locating areas and sources 
of RF interference as well as RF coverage (or lack thereof) and determining the locations of 
access points, bridges, sensors, and other infrastructure devices that will be used with the 
wireless network. Capacity planning is another important part of the process, to ensure that 
optimal performance is achieved. The following steps detail the entire physical wireless site 
survey process and guidelines. The RF physical site survey is subjective, and people have dif-
ferent opinions on how the entire process works. In many cases, the process can be tailored 
based on the individual needs or requirements of the location where the wireless network 
will be installed. The following steps should be viewed as recommendations or guidelines:
1.	
Arrange a walk-through of the entire location, which may often require being escorted 
by an authorized person.
2.	
Take thorough notes and digital photographs, as needed.
3.	
Perform an RF spectrum analysis.
4.	
Determine the preliminary placement of infrastructure devices.
5.	
Perform onsite testing to verify the design.
6.	
Determine the actual placement of infrastructure devices.
7.	
Install infrastructure hardware as specified.
8.	
Perform onsite verification testing and make adjustments to verify that the design 
meets the specifications.
9.	
Deliver the final site survey report.
In today’s wireless world, an RF site survey can be considered an ongoing process. Just a 
few years ago, not nearly as many wireless networks existed as do today, so the interference 

Radio Frequency Spectrum Analysis 
375  
factor was not as significant. With the RF dynamics constantly changing and more devices 
using RF for communications, it is up to the network engineer to take into consideration 
that site requirements may also be constantly changing. Therefore, the RF site survey may 
need to be updated periodically.
Radio Frequency Spectrum Analysis
The wireless site survey includes finding areas of RF coverage and RF interference as well 
as locations for hardware, such as access points, bridges, and other infrastructure devices. 
Although RF is not visible to the human eye, some tools are available to “see” a visual rep-
resentation of the RF. One common tool is the RF spectrum analyzer. How the analyzer 
will be used will determine the type of equipment you will need for the job. RF is used as a 
communications mechanism for many different types of technology:
■
■
Radio
■
■
Television
■
■
Computing
■
■
Cellular voice
In Chapter 4 you learned about the fundamentals, characteristics, and behaviors of RF 
technology, including various antenna types. You also saw some of the common frequency 
bands that are used for various types of wireless technologies. Using the correct spectrum 
analyzer for the job is a key element to collect the data you need. Spectrum analyzers are 
available in various form factors, and some are designed for a specific purpose, such as 
wireless networking technology, whereas others can be used for a larger part of the RF 
spectrum. These tools can be PC based or dedicated instrumentation devices. The follow-
ing section explores spectrum analysis for IEEE 802.11 wireless networks.
Spectrum Analysis for IEEE 802.11 Wireless Networks
A spectrum analyzer used with IEEE 802.11 wireless networking can be limited to the spe-
cific RF bands used with wireless networking. This includes the 2.4 GHz ISM band and the 
5 GHz U-NII bands. Figure 9.8 shows a spectrum analyzer view of the 2.4 GHz ISM band 
with the access points on various channels. Spectrum analyzers vary in cost and complex-
ity, depending on the frequency ranges they are designed to work with.
The spectrum analyzers that are designed specifically for the wireless market usually 
work only in the license-free radio bands. They are typically less expensive because of spec-
trum limitations. Spectrum analyzers allow you to view the Physical layer of communica-
tion between devices used in wireless networking. Spectrum analyzers that work with IEEE 
802.11 wireless networking technology are available in devices that attach to a USB port 
on the computer and instrumentation-style devices that can be used for applications other 
than wireless networking. Legacy solutions are PC card–based models, which may still be 
available in some markets. Figure 9.9 shows an example of a wireless network spectrum 
analyzer that connects to a USB port on a computer.

Some manufacturers of wireless network equipment integrate spectrum analyzer tools 
into devices such as wireless access points or WLAN controllers for constant monitoring 
of the RF. This feature is used for troubleshooting and allows a network administrator to 
monitor the RF in any part of the company. Some manufacturers offer stand-alone prod-
ucts that can be used to monitor more specific areas. Here are some manufacturers of wire-
less network spectrum analyzers:

The ability to analyze the RF allows a site surveyor to find areas that lack coverage, 
also known as dead spots, as well as interference caused by other devices and other IEEE 
802.11 wireless networks that operate in the same RF range. Although a spectrum analysis 
is not a requirement for a wireless site survey, it is beneficial in most medium- to large-scale 
deployments of wireless networks. Because of the vast number of devices that use unli-
censed radio bands, spectrum analysis can be considered an ongoing process. Performing 
regular spectrum analysis enables wireless network engineers to monitor the area in which 
wireless devices are located for RF interference and other issues. Figure 9.10 shows a screen 
capture of an RF scan using a USB-based spectrum analyzer designed for IEEE 802.11 
wireless networks.

Wi-Fi and Non–Wi-Fi Interference Sources
The performance of a wireless network can be significantly affected by various types of 
interference sources. Interference may be either intentional or unintentional and caused 
both by IEEE 802.11 wireless networks and by other devices that also operate in the  
2.4 GHz ISM or 5 GHz U-NII band. The use of portable and mobile devices that employ 
RF for communication continues to rise, so interference from these devices is also more 
prevalent. These interfering devices typically operate in the unlicensed radio spectrum  
2.4 GHz ISM band. Other sources of interference from the Industrial, Medical, and 
Scientific (ISM) communities will also affect the amount of interference. Non–Wi-Fi 
­interference in the ISM band can be caused by devices such as these:
■
■
Microwave ovens
■
■
Cordless telephones
■
■
Medical equipment
■
■
Manufacturing or industrial equipment
■
■
Wireless video cameras
■
■
Radar systems (5 GHz bands)
This is by no means a complete list, but it does contain some of the devices used daily 
that may cause some level of interference in the world of wireless networking. Figure 9.11 
shows an example of interference caused by a microwave oven. Microwave ovens operate in 
the 2.4 GHz frequency range and, depending on the unit, may cause interference with IEEE 
802.11 wireless networks.

power. These typically create a mountain-like shape, as shown in the waterfall view.

Chapter 9 ■ Design for Wireless Networking
 Wi-Fi Interference 
Wi-Fi interference is caused by IEEE 802.11 wireless network devices (also known as  sta-
tions [STA], per the IEEE 802.11 standard) that operate in the 2.4 GHz ISM or 5 GHz 
U-NII bands. In some cases, this is the largest source of interference for wireless networks. 
There are two types of Wi-Fi interference: co-channel interference (other devices on the 
same channel) and adjacent channel interference (other devices on overlapping channels). 
The following network types will cause Wi-Fi interference: 
 
■
 FHSS networks: 2.4 GHz (obsolete for IEEE 802.11) 
 
■
 DSSS networks: 2.4 GHz 
 
■
 ERP-OFDM networks: 2.4 GHz 
 
■
 OFDM: 5 GHz 
 
■
 HT-OFDM: 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz (802.11n) 
 
■
 VHT-OFDM: 5 GHz (802.11ac) 
 Wi-Fi devices that cause interference can be operating in either infrastructure mode or 
ad hoc mode. The number of devices that are part of the wireless network will also deter-
mine the extent of the interference. In Chapter  7 , “Modulation Technology for Wireless 
Networking,” we discussed different types of spread spectrum technologies that wireless 
networks use to communicate. FHSS, DSSS, ERP-OFDM, OFDM, HT-OFDM, and VHT-
OFDM are technologies used for IEEE 802.11 wireless networking in the 2.4 GHz and 
5 GHz bands. However, some of these technologies are used in non–wireless-network devices 
as well. For example, Bluetooth devices operating in the 2.4 GHz ISM band also use FHSS 
technology for communication. Zigbee devices operate in the 2.4 GHz band and use 
DSSS technology for communication. Depending on the manufacturer, 2.4 GHz cordless 
phones may use either FHSS or DSSS. Performing an RF spectrum analysis is one way you can 
determine the source of this type of interference. If an instrumentation spectrum analyzer (a 
calibrated device that has the capability to view entire radio spectrums) is used, it will be nec-
essary to understand how to interpret the data collected as well as how to operate the device. 
 
 It is important to note that IEEE 802.11 FHSS WLANs are obsolete networks 
and unlikely to be found with today’s wireless installations. All references 
to FHSS have officially been removed from the IEEE 802.11-2016 standard. 
We mention this here because FHSS is used with other wireless technolo-
gies, such as Bluetooth devices and cordless telephones. 
 Standards vs. industry Defi nitions of interference 
 The 802.11 standard loosely defi nes an adjacent channel as any channel with nonover-
lapping frequencies for the DSSS and HR/DSSS PHYs. With ERP and OFDM, the stan-
dard loosely defi nes an adjacent channel as the fi rst channel with a nonoverlapping 
frequency space. 

Received Signal Strength 
385  
This contradicts how the term adjacent channel interference is typically used in the 
marketplace. Most Wi-Fi manufacturers use this term to loosely mean both interference 
resulting from overlapping cells and interference resulting from the use of overlapping 
frequency space. For example, manufacturers typically use this term in a case where AP-1 
(channel 1) is located near AP-2 (channel 2).
Adjacent channel interference is a performance condition that occurs when two or more 
access point radios are providing RF coverage to the same physical area using overlap-
ping frequencies. Simultaneous RF transmissions by two or more of these access point 
radios in the same physical area can result in corrupted 802.11 frames because of the 
frequency overlap. Corrupted 802.11 frames cause retransmissions, which result in both 
throughput degradation and latency.
Co-channel interference is a performance condition that occurs when two or more 
independently coordinated access point radios are providing RF coverage to the same 
physical area using the same 802.11 channel. Additional RF medium contention overhead 
occurs for all radios using this channel in this physical area, resulting in throughput deg-
radation and latency.
Received Signal Strength
The main objective of a wireless network is to provide access to computer network 
resources and services for wireless devices that are connected to the network. This 
means it is essential for wireless client devices to have reliable connectivity to the wire-
less network infrastructure. To provide this connectivity, the wireless site survey process 
should include testing to verify that the received signal is adequate for the application of 
the device.
Devices that communicate wirelessly require two-way communications in order to 
operate correctly. This means the receiver must be able to receive enough of the signal to 
determine the data that was sent from the transmitter. Wireless client devices use what 
is known as the received signal strength to show the amount of power received from 
a transmission. Figure 9.12 shows a client utility that displays specifics regarding the 
received signal.
The amount of received signal strength required will be determined by the type or 
application of the wireless device as well as the amount of RF noise in the area. RF noise 
consists of extraneous undesired radio signals in the area emitted by a variety of devices 
other than the transmitter. You should check with the device manufacturer to determine 
the minimum amount of received signal that is acceptable for a specific application. Some 
applications will require more received signal than others. For example, the manufacturer 
of a voice handset used with a Wi-Fi network may recommend a minimum of –65 dBm to 
–67 dBm, whereas a computer network card may require a minimum of –70 dBm.

386 
Chapter 9 ■ Design for Wireless Networking
 f i g u r e   9.12    A wireless client utility showing signal, noise, and data rate
 
 The  signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is the difference between the received signal and the 
noise fl oor. For example, if the received signal is –65 dBm and the noise fl oor is –95 dBm, 
then the SNR will be 30 dB. This value is calculated by subtracting the received signal from 
the noise. In this case, –65 dBm – (–95 dBm) = 30 dB.   
 
 Most best practices recommend the SNR for wireless networks to be a 
minimum of 25 dB. 
 
 In wireless network technology, the received signal strength indicator 
(RSSI) value is an arbitrary number assigned by the device manufacturer. 
There is no standard for this value, and it will not be comparable between 
devices from different manufacturers. When performing a site survey, 
whenever possible it is beneficial to survey with the same network adapter 
model that will be used in the deployment. This will provide more accurate 
results for the client devices using the network. 

Performing a Manual Radio Frequency Wireless Site Survey 
387  
Performing a Manual Radio Frequency 
Wireless Site Survey
A manual RF site survey can provide some of the most accurate results when it comes to 
obtaining certain information. A manual site survey requires a physical walk-through of 
the area, recording information to determine the performance of clients and devices that 
will be connected to the wireless network. This type of site survey can be very accurate 
because the surveyor is recording actual statistics, such as the following:
■
■
Signal strength
■
■
SNR
■
■
Data rate of connected devices
■
■
RF interference
These measurements are recorded while the site surveyor is physically moving through 
the facility or location. Recommended received signal strength and SNR values were 
discussed earlier in this chapter. Small-scale manual site surveys can be performed inex-
pensively by using a wireless client adapter with site survey functionality, one of several 
freeware/shareware utilities, or commercial software designed specifically for this type of 
application. Figure 9.13 shows an example of a free site survey software program that can 
be used for very basic measurements.
F i g u r e  9.13    Ekahau HeatMapper, a Wi-Fi coverage mapping site survey software 
utility, is a free download from Ekahau.

388 
Chapter 9 ■ Design for Wireless Networking
 The manual site survey process can be used for recording measurements to determine the 
actual placement of hardware infrastructure devices and for spot checking, locating other 
IEEE 802.11 wireless networks, or verifi cation after a predictive site survey has determined the 
placement of these devices. Not too long ago this manual process was the only way to perform 
a wireless site survey. The main advantage of the manual process is accuracy. One disadvan-
tage is that it can be very time consuming, depending on the extent of the installation. 
 The process for a manual RF site survey will vary depending on the individual who is 
performing the survey. However, there are some common components and considerations 
that may be included: 
 
■
 Obtaining a floor plan or blueprint 
 
■
 Identifying existing wireless networks 
 
■
 Testing access point placement 
 
■
 Analyzing the results 
 
■
 Considering the advantages and disadvantages of manual site surveys 
 
■
 Performing a software-assisted manual site survey 
 
■
 Using a manual site survey toolkit 
 Understanding each of these components will help provide a more accurate site survey 
and successful wireless network deployment. 
 Obtaining a Floor Plan or Blueprint 
 The fi rst step in a manual site survey is to review a fl oor plan or blueprint of the location. Many 
in the industry refer to a fl oor plan as a map. This could be a simple sketch and is required to 
note access point placement as well as readings. The readings to note on the fl oor plan include 
signal strength and SNR values from client devices. Figure  9.14 shows a basic fl oor plan of a 
small offi ce building. The fl oor plan should be marked with approximate access point locations. 
In some cases, a fl oor plan or CAD drawing of the location may not be available. Depending on 
the size of the location, a fi re evacuation plan could be photographed or scanned in and used as 
a starting point to create a drawing and may be adequate for the site survey.  
 
 The floor plan and approximate access point locations used in these exam-
ples are for illustration purposes only. 
 Identifying Existing Wireless Networks 
 As part of a manual site survey, you should identify existing wireless networks in the area, 
noting locations that include possible sources of RF interference and may have an impact 
on the wireless network that will be installed. Using a device or software program designed 
specifi cally for wireless networks would be ideal. However, freeware or shareware pro-
grams may be satisfactory. Figure  9.15 shows an example of a software program that can 
be used to fi nd existing IEEE 802.11 wireless networks.

Chapter 9  ■  Design for Wireless Networking  
Testing Access Point Placement
Once you have identified potential locations for access points, you can start testing the 
proposed access point placement. This can be done by temporarily mounting an access 
point at the desired location to get the most accurate results. In some cases, a tool or fixture 
made specifically for wireless site surveys or even a tall ladder could be used as a temporary 
mounting solution. Refer to the documentation that was created prior to going on site  
for mounting locations.
It is always best to use test access points from the same manufacturer and, if possible, 
the same model that will be used in the actual deployment during the pre- and post-
deployment manual site survey process. This practice will yield a better outcome than using 
generic access points during testing. Figure 9.16 shows an example of a temporary mount-
ing solution.
F i g u r e  9.16    Access point temporarily mounted using an expandable light pole
Using one or possibly two temporarily mounted access points, document the results of 
the testing while moving around the facility. One testing method is the active survey pro-
cess and requires the client device used for the survey to perform an IEEE 802.11 authenti-
cation and association to the test access points. This will provide the active connection. The 
passive survey process (listening to all access points in the area) may also be used for this  
type of site survey. The area to be tested should include a reasonable proximity around the 
temporarily mounted access point. The extent should be the desired minimum received 
signal threshold (for example, –67 dBm). The information recorded and documented will 

Performing a Manual Radio Frequency Wireless Site Survey

depend on the surveyor but commonly includes signal strength and SNR. It may be neces-
sary to make adjustments to access point mounting during the testing process, based on the 
results of the onsite testing process. It would be benefi cial to test an actual wireless client 
device and software application that will be used with the network to see if the perfor-
mance meets expectations. Software-assisted surveys, as described later in this chapter, are 
commonly used for a site survey of any size in today’s wireless deployments. 
 Analyzing the Results 
 Once all the testing is complete, it is necessary to perform an offl ine analysis to determine 
the fi nal placement of access points or other infrastructure devices that may be used in the 
wireless deployment. This may include making adjustments from the original plan or add-
ing and removing access points. The use of various antennas may also need to be analyzed 
and documented. 
 Considering the Advantages and Disadvantages of 
Manual Site Surveys 
 There are several advantages and disadvantages to the manual site survey process: 
 
■
 Advantages 
 
■
 It is accurate because it is based on actual readings. 
 
■
 Characteristics (attenuation values) of the building are physically tested. 
 
■
 It allows verification of actual RF signal coverage and interference. 
 
■
 It allows marking exact installation locations of infrastructure hardware while 
onsite. 
 
■
 Disadvantages 
 
■
 It can be time consuming. 
 
■
 Usually only one access point is used for testing, so readings will need to be 
merged. 
 
■
 It requires a physical walk-through of entire location. 
 
■
 Many areas require an escort and special clearances for access. 
 
 WLAN infrastructure equipment used in a manual site survey should be 
from the same manufacturer as the hardware that will be installed in the 
actual deployment. Although in some cases it may be difficult to accom-
plish, using a site survey client device to replicate what will be used in the 
actual environment is always recommended. This will minimize any poten-
tial issues from variations between manufacturers’ devices. 

392 
Chapter 9  ■  Design for Wireless Networking  
Performing a Software-Assisted Manual Site Survey
The manual site survey technique discussed earlier may be adequate for smaller deploy-
ments or for organizations that have limited resources and budget. Manual site surveys can 
also be accomplished with the aid of commercial software programs designed specifically 
for this process. These programs vary in cost, complexity, and features, and contain many 
advanced features:
■
■
Capability to perform both passive and active surveys
■
■
Capability to import floor plans with support for many graphic formats, including 
JPG, BMP, and CAD
■
■
Capability to record critical data, such as signal and SNR
■
■
Visual representation of RF signal propagation of surveyed areas
■
■
Post-survey offline analysis of collected data
The Passive Wireless Site Survey
A passive site survey consists of monitoring the air and recording the RF information from 
all wireless access points and wireless client stations or devices in the “hearing range” 
of the surveying station, and includes RF information from your own and neighboring 
devices. This type of site survey does not require an IEEE 802.11 authentication and asso-
ciation to an access point, and no traffic is passed between the survey station and the access 
point. A passive site survey will provide an overall snapshot of the RF in use in or around 
the location, including RF noise and other IEEE 802.11 wireless networks in the area. It 
is used to get an overall picture of the wireless network access points that are transmitting 
within the area being surveyed. Figure 9.17 shows an example of a commercial site survey 
application in passive mode.
Since passive site surveys do not require an association to an access point, all RFs will be 
detected, displayed, and recorded. Most commercial software applications with this func-
tionality will have the capability to filter the coverage map on specific access points from 
the information that was recorded.
The Active Site Wireless Survey
An active site survey consists of a survey device, such as a notebook computer, associating 
to an access point prior to taking readings and collecting the data. Some claim this type 
of manual survey will provide more accurate results because of this direct IEEE 802.11 
authentication and association to an access point. The association of the survey device to 
an access point will actively send and receive some basic RF information to and from the 
access point, allowing the information about signal strength and noise levels to be recorded. 
Figure 9.18 shows a commercial site survey performing an active site survey.
Performing either a passive or active site survey using software involves many of the 
same steps discussed in the section “Performing a Manual Radio Frequency Wireless Site 
Survey” earlier in this chapter. The main difference is the features and capabilities that are 
available in these commercial software packages. These elaborate features will eliminate 
the need to manually document and record all the information obtained while walking the 
area, because the program handles this task for the surveyor.

Using a Manual Site Survey Toolkit
To perform a manual site survey, you need a toolkit containing essential components. A 
floor plan or blueprint is required to record data collected during a manual site survey. 
If a software program is used, both an electronic version of the floor plan and a paper 
printout are necessary. Site survey toolkits will vary in complexity and cost. Planning 
the equipment and tools you will need for a manual site survey is very important. We 
recommend you take everything you will need and not take items you will not need. 
Taking items you do not need creates an unnecessary burden. Many times you may be 
the only person performing the physical survey, and therefore you need to realize your 
physical and time limitations. You can create your own site survey kit based on what 
you will need, or you can purchase from a manufacturer a kit that is built specifically 
for this purpose.
A variety of items might be included in a wireless site survey kit. Now take a look at 
some of the most common items, and keep in mind that the kit will vary based on the site 
survey and the person performing the site survey.
Spectrum Analyzer (Optional)    A spectrum analyzer is an optional but recommended item 
that may be used in an RF wireless site survey. This device will sweep the area to look for 
devices that may cause interference with the deployment and locate all the RF information 
in the area. Spectrum analyzers vary in cost and features. Although optional, this tool is 
highly recommended.
Wireless Access Points    One or two access points are needed to take signal measurements 
during the manual site survey process. It is important to use access points from the same 
manufacturer, and if possible the same model that will be installed, to simulate what will 
be used in the actual installation. If this cannot be achieved, try to get an access point that 
is as close as possible to those that will be used in the deployment.

 We recommend that you set the test access points’ output power level 
at about 50 percent or less during the site survey. This usually requires 
lowering the default power, which in many cases is set at maximum. This 
will allow for adjustments after installation to help compensate for poten-
tial differences from when the space was originally surveyed. The output 
power settings used will be determined by the individual performing the 
site survey. It is also important to keep in mind that if you are performing a 
site survey for both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands, the amount of RF transmit 
power as well as the gain of the antennas must be taken into consideration 
because of the difference in wavelength, which will in turn affect the range.  
Wireless Client Device  A device to take measurements from the client side is an important 
component of the site survey kit. This can be a Wi-Fi–enabled notebook computer, smart-
phone, or tablet with appropriate software to take signal measurements. Size and weight 
should be considered as well. A Wi-Fi, VoIP handset may also be used for locations that are 
considering VoIP capabilities. It is best to try to match the survey client devices with those 
that will actually be used in the wireless devices connecting to the wireless network; how-
ever, this is not required. 
 Portable Battery Packs or Extension Cords  Portable battery packs to temporarily power 
the wireless access points are highly recommended. If these are not available, extension 
cords are a good substitute. The disadvantage of extension cords is that they require acces-
sible AC power outlets, which might not be available at all sites. Also, they may be diffi cult 
to use and can be cumbersome. An extra battery pack for the survey device is also recom-
mended. Battery packs specifi cally designed for wireless site surveys are available from a 
variety of manufacturers. Most battery packs will last longer than the surveyor. 
 Various Antennas (If Required)  If antennas other than those mounted directly to an 
access point will be used in the deployment, a variety of them should be on hand for testing 
during the site survey process. If 802.11n technology will be tested during the site survey, 
appropriate 802.11n antennas will be required as part of the site survey kit. If you do not 
plan to use different antennas, there is no value in taking them along during the survey. 
 Temporary Mounting Hardware  Mounting hardware for temporarily mounting access 
points and antennas should also be considered, including expandable poles, brackets, tape, 
and nylon tie straps. You may have to be creative when it comes to temporary mounting. It 
is critical to make safety a number-one priority when performing this task. 
 Measuring Device, Either Tape or Wheel  A measuring tape or wheel is recommended 
for measuring distance to wiring closets and distance between access points and any other 
areas where distance is important. Laser measuring tools are also available, but many are 
capable of only short distances. If possible, it would be benefi cial to have both a tape (or 
wheel) and a laser measuring device.

Chapter 9 ■ Design for Wireless Networking
Digital Camera  As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words. Using a digital cam-
era to take photographs of situations that may be diffi cult to explain in writing is a great 
help. This also adds quality to wireless site survey reports. Digital camera technology is 
now inexpensive, and most smartphones and tablets have this capability built in. We rec-
ommend taking many digital photographs when possible, especially in areas that may be 
diffi cult to describe in writing. It is better to have the photographs if the need arises than 
to wish you had them. Photographs of potential access point locations are valuable should 
physical limitations of the facility come into question. Also, photographs of existing devices 
are useful to determine if they are damaged or poorly deployed and need to be revisited as 
part of the new device deployment. 
 Pens, Pencils, Markers, and Paper  Documentation is a critical part of wireless site surveys 
as well as all other areas of the network. Keeping thorough and accurate notes will allow 
the surveyor to document areas of importance. Even with the advanced portable technol-
ogy you have in your possession, it is always a good idea to have paper and writing utensils. 
Markers can also be used to identify the locations where access points will be installed. 
Ladders or Lifts  Ladders or lifts are required for mounting temporary access points and 
antennas. The height of the ladder or lift will depend on the mounting locations for the 
access points. Keep in mind that the surveyor may not be allowed to use a ladder or lift at 
certain locations or in some areas. You may have to work with the facility manager to get 
someone who will be able to perform this task. 
 
 If heavy equipment is required to install an access point in the final loca-
tion, several items should be considered. What is the cost of the equip-
ment, and does this cost fit into the budget? Will the equipment physically 
fit into the area where the access point needs to be installed? Will any spe-
cial training be required to operate the equipment, or do you need to fac-
tor in the cost to hire an experienced operator? In some cases an alternate 
location to mount the access point may be a more cost-effective solution. 
Movable Cart  A movable cart or dolly to move all equipment used for the site survey will 
ease the burden of getting the equipment moved safely around the facility. Depending on 
the amount of site survey equipment and the number of access points, batteries, poles, lad-
ders, and so on, it can be a cumbersome task to move all this around. This is especially true 
in larger facilities, and carts make this task much easier. 
 Performing a Predictive Modeling 
Site Survey 
 A predictive modeling site survey can be an accurate way to design a wireless network 
without having to spend time on site performing a physical walk-through and testing of the 
entire location. A  predictive modeling site survey is a software-based site survey in which a 

Performing a Predictive Modeling Site Survey  
401  
floor plan (map) or drawing of the area to be surveyed is imported into a software program. 
The program then simulates the RF propagation from access points by using the attenua-
tion properties of various structural components, and provides a coverage map based on 
the information that was input into the program. The surveyor can trace over walls, win-
dows, doors, and other elements of the physical location in order to estimate the RF attenu-
ation and show how the RF propagates based on the environment. This type of site survey 
can be performed in several different ways depending on the equipment used. You can use a 
stand-alone commercial software program designed specifically for this purpose, or in some 
cases, manufacturers build this site survey functionality directly into a wireless controller. 
Some manufacturers now have Internet-based wireless site survey programs, and the design 
is performed online. You will see more information on Internet-based survey tools later in 
this chapter.
A predictive modeling site survey requires the wireless engineer or surveyor to input a 
floor plan drawing of the facility, such as a CAD, JPEG, BMP (or other format) file, directly 
into the software program, in the controller, or to the online program. Then, details such 
as the attenuation values of the facility are added. The details can include the following 
information:
■
■
Type of walls, such as drywall, brick, or poured concrete
■
■
Thickness of walls
■
■
Types of windows, including glass, thickness, and coating
■
■
Type of doors, such as hollow core, solid core, fire doors, wood, or steel
■
■
Location of certain types of furnishings, such as cubicle offices
■
■
Height of the ceiling
One thing to keep in mind about a predictive modeling site survey is that the accuracy 
and final results are only as good as the information that was input into the program. 
Basically it equates to “garbage in, garbage out.” It is essential for the surveyor to use 
accurate information about the location, including the attenuation value of all the building 
materials.
Here are some the advantages and disadvantages of using the predictive modeling site 
survey process:
■
■
Advantages
■
■
It requires limited time on site.
■
■
It does not require a complete physical walk-through for testing, though a visit to 
the site is recommended.
■
■
It allows for easy adjustment of access point locations and settings.
■
■
It can model different scenarios.
■
■
Disadvantages
■
■
The surveyor may be unfamiliar with the location’s physical characteristics.
■
■
The accuracy is limited to the data input into the software program.
■
■
It requires extensive knowledge of physical properties of the installation area, 
including attenuation values.

Internet-Based Predictive Modeling Site Survey
Some manufacturers of wireless network equipment offer Internet- or web-based predictive 
modeling wireless site survey programs. The manufacturers of these programs assume you 
will be using their equipment in your wireless deployment. The programs are robust and 
free to access, and some also provide free online training. The process to use these tools 
is fairly straightforward. You need to request access or create an account on the manufac-
turer’s website. You will then be able to log in and upload a floor plan map to the website 
program. Here is a list of such programs:

Hybrid Approach to Wireless Site Surveys
A surveyor can also use a hybrid approach to wireless site surveys. The hybrid method 
combines both the physical manual site survey and the predictive model site survey. This 
method can give “the best of both worlds” and enables the surveyor to check the physi-
cal installation location, make notes, place an access point to take signal readings in key 
areas, and get some spectrum analysis data. The surveyor can then apply the information 
collected to a predictive model to get more accurate results.

Protocol Analysis 
403  
Performing a Post-Deployment Site Survey
Regardless of which survey method is used for the RF wireless site survey, you should 
conduct a final post-deployment validation site survey. This task should be included in the 
initial scope of work. The post-site survey can be a walk-through where you make a spot-
check of the coverage and signal strength. You should test known or suspected problem 
areas. This will give you a snapshot of the overall wireless installation. A better and more 
thorough method would be to do a complete walk-through in every area, checking and 
recording the coverage and providing a coverage map. Using one of the software-based site 
survey programs previously discussed will allow you to do a passive, active, or predictive 
site survey and give you an accurate footprint of the overall wireless coverage. A post-
deployment site survey will allow you to test the roaming capabilities of different wireless 
clients and mobile devices that may be used in the actual wireless installation. This type of 
survey may be time consuming on a large facility, but it will give you not only a footprint 
of RF coverage but also a baseline for ongoing monitoring and troubleshooting.
When performing a post-deployment site survey, use the same devices used to perform the 
initial manual site survey. Include a walkabout on the exterior perimeter of the building in order 
to record the RF signal around the building. During the post-deployment site survey, not only 
can you record the RSSI and SNR of the RF signal, you can detect and record any dead spots or 
areas of RF interference to validate the design. The goal of the post-deployment site survey is to 
ensure that the signal level meets the design goal. Most industry experts recommend a threshold 
of –65 dBm to –67 dBm as a minimum for best performance for both data and voice.
Protocol Analysis
Wireless network protocol analyzers are becoming common tools; many network administra-
tors have one as part of their wireless network toolkit. A protocol analyzer allows a network 
administrator or engineer to view all wireless frames that are traversing across the air within 
the hearing range of the analysis device. At one time, performing a protocol analysis was a 
specialty task, and without extensive training few people had the skills to perform it. Along 
with the evolution of wireless networking technology in recent years, protocol analyzers are 
becoming more mainstream, more affordable, and easier to use. Many variations of analyzers 
are available in the market today. Here are some of the manufacturers and their products:

Chapter 9 ■ Design for Wireless Networking
 
 Most wireless protocol analyzers require the use of certain network 
adapters and, in many cases, a special device driver. We recommend that 
you verify that you have access to an adapter supported by the protocol 
analyzer’s manufacturer. 
 Protocol analyzers are available in software programs that can be installed on a note-
book computer, and they are also available in specialty dedicated handheld devices. Many 
analyzers are feature rich, with the capability to view security information, perform legisla-
tive compliance analysis and reporting, and generate a variety of reports, in addition to per-
forming protocol analysis or frame decoding. Figure  9.19 shows an example of a wireless 
network protocol analyzer. Some manufacturers of enterprise wireless equipment provide 
remote packet analysis capability that allows protocol analysis from any location. Most 
wireless intrusion prevention system (WIPS) sensors also have this capability.

 The main goals of a wireless network analyzer, or any protocol analyzer, are to trou-
bleshoot network problems, gather information about security issues, and optimize the 
network’s performance. When it comes to wireless site surveys, a protocol analyzer is a 
valuable tool for evaluating which wireless devices are currently in the same RF space 
where the proposed wireless network will be deployed. They can also be used to view 
the signal strength, security implementations, network name or SSID, and the channels

Chapter 9  ■  Design for Wireless Networking  
RF Coverage Planning
One goal of a wireless site survey is to determine areas of RF coverage and RF interference. 
The details of the required coverage and capacity in any wireless network are part of the 
wireless network design, which involves determining the need, use, and business require-
ments of the network. This was discussed earlier in this chapter. The following factors need 
to be taken into consideration during a physical site survey:
■
■
Purpose of wireless network: data, voice, video and/or location services
■
■
Size of the physical location
■
■
Number of users and wireless devices, including BYOD users
■
■
Obstacles that may impact RF signal propagation
■
■
RF range
■
■
Bandwidth requirements of applications to be used
■
■
Selected RF of wireless network hardware
The planning process will provide some of the answers, whereas a site visit and onsite 
testing will determine others, such as obstacles, signal propagation, and RF range.
Infrastructure Hardware Selection 
and Placement
In addition to identifying areas of RF coverage and interference, a site survey will deter-
mine the best locations for wireless access points and other infrastructure devices. The cor-
rect placement of these devices is important in order to allow clients and devices to benefit 
fully from the deployment of the wireless network. The location of these devices is tradi-
tionally based on the following criteria:
■
■
Desired RF coverage
■
■
Required bandwidth
■
■
Aesthetics requirements
■
■
Applications, both hardware and software
■
■
RF cell overlap
■
■
Channel reuse patterns
Mapping out the infrastructure device placement is considered part of the planning and 
design process. Manual, software-assisted, or predictive modeling site survey processes will 
help identify the proper locations based on the items mentioned. In most cases, a prelimi-
nary visit to the location is highly recommended, regardless of the size and the site survey 
method that will be used. Knowing the physical location will benefit the entire site survey 
process because it will help identify areas of concern.

Testing Different Antennas 
411  
Testing Different Antennas
Chapter 5, “Antenna Technology for Wireless Networking,” discussed the characteristics, 
features, and best uses of various types of antennas, including omnidirectional, semidi-
rectional, and highly directional models. Here we’ll consider how best to conduct antenna 
testing in a wireless site survey.
As part of a manual site survey, it may be necessary to test different antennas to deter-
mine the best RF coverage. This usually requires the surveyor to connect and temporarily 
mount various types of antennas to access points in order to determine the proper radiation 
pattern and to verify RF coverage within the desired area. Some predictive modeling site 
survey programs will allow you to change different antennas so you can see how that will 
change the RF propagation pattern. A temporary antenna mounting example is shown in 
Figure 9.20.
F i g u r e  9. 2 0     Expandable light pole used for temporary mounting and testing of Yagi 
and patch antennas
Testing Multiple Antenna Types
If different antennas will be used in the deployment, it is important for the surveyor to have 
several types of antennas as part of the site survey kit. Some organizations that deploy wire-
less networks are extremely concerned about aesthetics; they will allow only specific types 
of antennas to be used. For example, if access points with removable antennas are used, in 
many cases the only type allowed will be omnidirectional antennas that are attached directly 
to the access point with a gain of about 2 or 3 dBi. Other deployments may use access points 
in which antennas are permanently attached and cannot be removed or changed.

412 
Chapter 9 ■ Design for Wireless Networking
 
 Polarization of antennas must be taken into consideration during a manual 
site survey. Polarization of antennas for infrastructure devices is criti-
cal, and tests should mimic as closely as possible what will actually be 
installed. With the variety of wireless client devices that may be used in 
a wireless network, it is a challenge to predict the polarization of all the 
devices that might be used. However, it is advisable for the surveyor to 
take this into consideration during the site survey. 
 Choosing the Correct Antennas 
 Choosing the correct antenna to be used in a specifi c deployment is part of the wireless design 
and site survey process. Many factors play a role in determining which antenna will be best 
for the application. Some locations have strict requirements about the type of antenna that 
may be used. Therefore, the surveyor may have to work with specifi c antennas to ensure 
proper RF coverage. Take the following factors into consideration when choosing antennas: 
Manufacturer’s Recommendations  The manufacturer of an access point may recommend 
only a specifi c type of antenna. If this is the case, it is important to perform the site survey 
with the same type of antenna. 
Customer Requirements  A customer may require that only specifi c types of antennas be 
used. In this case, the survey should be performed with the type of antenna required by the 
customer. For example, a deployment consisting of walled offi ces may require the use of thin 
access points. Usually this type of access point uses an omnidirectional internal antenna. 
 Environmental Conditions  The environment where the wireless network is installed may 
also determine the type of antenna to be used. If the location is a factory with harsh envi-
ronmental conditions, that could have an impact on the type of antenna and may also call 
for an enclosure for the access point. 
 Aesthetics  Many organizations are sensitive to the type of devices that are seen by cus-
tomers and clients. Therefore, aesthetically pleasing antennas may be required by the 
customer in order to be a good fi t for the location in which they will be used. 
 Required Coverage  The required RF coverage and the gain of the antenna will affect the 
choice of antenna. For example, a large offi ce area may require the use of omnidirectional 
antennas that are physically attached to access points. A manufacturing facility may require 
semidirectional antennas to cover areas of the manufacturing fl oor. Keep in mind that in 
addition to being passive bidirectional amplifi ers, antennas shape the coverage by either an 
increase or decrease in antenna gain. 
 Number of Wireless Access Points  The number of access points to be installed in a loca-
tion will also be a determining factor in the type of antenna to be used. An offi ce build-
ing with a combination of walled offi ces and cubicles may have a dense deployment of 
access points with a limited number of users connecting to any particular access point. 
Omnidirectional antennas connected directly to the access point may be an adequate solu-
tion for this type of deployment. The purpose of the wireless network also affects the 
number of access points. For example, a wireless network that will support voice clients 

Wireless Channel Architectures 
413  
will typically require more access points than a network supporting only data. If the wire-
less network will support location services such as RFID tracking or wireless intrusion pre-
vention mitigation, additional access points with semidirectional antennas may be required 
due to the design aspects of the technology.
Physical Geometry of Location    The attributes of the physical location will have an effect 
on the type of antenna to be installed and therefore should be tested during the site survey. 
This includes propagation of the signal and attenuation of obstacles. If a building has long 
hallways or corridors, a Yagi antenna would be a good candidate for a solution.
Regulatory Agency and Local Codes    When selecting antennas, both indoors and out-
doors, it is important to completely understand any RF limits or regulations that apply 
from the governing body or regulatory agency or any local codes that exist. In addition to 
the RF codes, these may include, for example, height limitations and proximity to airports. 
Violations of any of these may result in large fines or other penalties.
Wireless Channel Architectures
In wireless technology, channel architecture is the design, layout, or channel plan in use. 
Two common types of channel architectures that pertain to IEEE 802.11 wireless network-
ing are available today: multiple-channel architecture (MCA) and single-channel architec-
ture (SCA). In the 2.4 GHz band, for example, the use of nonoverlapping channels 1, 6, 
and 11 would be considered MCA.
Multiple-Channel Architecture
Most wireless network deployments today use multiple-channel architecture (MCA). This 
type of installation will use access points set to different RF channels to avoid overlapping 
channel interference, as shown in Figure 9.21. A channel plan may be used with access 
points set to specific channels, or in many cases automatic channel selection allows the 
devices to choose the best channel in which to operate.

Chapter 9  ■  Design for Wireless Networking  
Single-Channel Architecture
Single-channel architecture (SCA) is a wireless networking technology available from only 
a couple of manufacturers. SCA allows all access points to communicate on the same RF 
channel. The controller that the access points are connected to manages these access points 
and helps to avoid co-channel interference. In SCA deployments, not all access points are 
transmitting at the same time. The controller will determine which access points can trans-
mit simultaneously based on the wireless devices that are in a specific area. A wireless site 
survey for SCA equates to providing RF coverage based on the access point placements as 
the wireless controller manages all the RF.
There are a few terms you should know with respect to SCA: stacking, spanning, and 
blanketing. They all refer to a means of adding capacity in an SCA network.
For example, let’s look at a three-story building. Each floor in the building may be 
assigned a channel to use; with SCA architecture, this is known as stacking. The first floor  
would be set to channel 1; the second floor would be set to channel 6; and the third  
floor would be set to channel 11. Since all access points on the same floor are set to  
the same RF channel, co-channel interference or overlapping channel interference is not  
a significant issue, because of how the SCA technology works.
Using SCA may help save some time when it comes to the site survey. It is best to follow 
the manufacturer’s recommendations for deployment for this type of system. Figure 9.22 
shows an example of an SCA deployment.

Wireless Device Installation Limitations
The installation limitations of any device that will be installed and used on the wireless net-
work need to be evaluated. Sometimes things look great on paper, but when it comes time 
to actually perform the installation, it may be a little different. Various wireless devices 
may have the following installation limitations:
Wireless Access Points    An installer may run into limitations when it comes to mount-
ing access points or other infrastructure devices. For this reason, the surveyor must pay

close attention to the location where these devices will be mounted. The type of ceiling and 
mounting hardware needs to be considered. A wireless site survey should include a physical 
walk-through evaluation of the proposed mounting locations to observe any issues that may 
affect where access points, bridges, or repeaters can be mounted.
Antennas    If antennas other than those designed to be connected directly to an access 
point are used, special circumstances may need to be taken into account:
■
■
Mounting issues
■
■
Cabling issues
■
■
Aesthetics
■
■
Height restrictions
Ethernet/PoE    The maximum distance an Ethernet unshielded twisted-pair cable can 
run is 328 feet, or 100 meters, per the IEEE 802.3 standard. Part of the wireless site sur-
vey process includes verification of the distance infrastructure devices will be mounted 
from the wiring closet to be certain they do not exceed the maximum. The capabilities 
of the Ethernet system must also be evaluated to verify the capacity of the wiring system. 
This will ensure that there is adequate connectivity for the new wireless infrastructure 
devices.
If PoE will be used, it is important to verify that the infrastructure will be able to sup-
port the number of devices that require DC power from the PoE infrastructure devices. If 
the current wired infrastructure is not PoE compliant, the infrastructure may need to be 
upgraded prior to wireless deployment. If an upgrade is not feasible, an alternate solution, 
such as single port power injectors or patch panels, may be required.
Local Code Restrictions    In some cases, local codes or regulations will not allow devices 
to be installed in places like elevator shafts and stairwells. This must be identified up front 
for expectation purposes, especially where VoWLAN is used, so that users are aware of the 
limitations that may be beyond the surveyor’s or installer’s control. Also, it is important to 
be aware of the fact that some fire codes may require plenum-rated (fire-retardant) cable 
and devices in certain places where wireless networks will be installed.
Site Survey Report
The survey report should be a complete document itemizing all components of the  
wireless site survey. This includes the business aspects of the wireless site survey as well 
as the physical aspects. This report should include but not be limited to notes, charts, 
graphs, photos, test results, and any other pertinent data that will have an effect on the 
wireless network deployment. Most reports will be customized based on the individual 
needs and requirements of the customer. Most commercial site survey application pro-
grams have built-in reporting features that can be included in the site survey report. 
Figure 9.23 shows a sample page from a commercial site survey application with report-
generation features.

Summary 
417  
The RF dynamics of many environments are constantly changing, as more devices using 
RF for communications become a part of the wireless network or share the same RF space. 
It is a wireless network engineer’s responsibility to understand that site requirements may 
also be constantly changing. Therefore, the RF site survey is becoming an ongoing process, 
and the site survey report can be seen as a living document.
Summary
This chapter discussed the business aspects of wireless network site surveys. The objective 
of a site survey is to find areas of RF coverage and interference, understand capacity plan-
ning, and determine hardware installation locations. We explored some of the factors that 
determine the complexity of a site survey.
You saw the importance of gathering information as well as the types of information 
required to successfully perform a wireless site survey and design a wireless network. 
Anyone designing a wireless network needs to understand completely the expectations of 
how the network will perform in the environment before deploying the network. These 
expectations will be met by asking the right questions of the right people—managers and 
users of the wireless network—because they are the ones who will be using it. Having the 
appropriate documentation is a key element to a successful deployment. Accurate docu-
mentation will also help streamline some of the site survey process and the deployment of 
wireless networking hardware. Accurate documentation will help with the installation of 
cabling and access points and minimize questions about the installation.
It is essential to know the location and type of existing networks, both wired and wire-
less. If existing wireless networks are in place, you must determine what role, if any, they 
will play in the new deployment or upgrade.
You learned about RF coverage and capacity requirements and the factors to be taken 
into consideration to ensure proper coverage throughout the location where the wireless 
network is installed. Client connectivity requirements and other considerations were dis-
cussed. The types of wireless client devices that will be used, such as notebook computer, 
tablet, or bar-code scanner, must be determined. Antenna orientation to ensure correct 
polarization will need to be considered during the site survey process. We also looked at the 
type of antennas commonly used in a particular deployment scenario.
The wireless site survey process is one of the most important components of a successful 
wireless deployment. Many areas need to be considered, including an RF spectrum analysis 
to determine RF interference sources that may affect the wireless deployment. Although a 
spectrum analysis can be considered optional, it is advisable to complete one whenever pos-
sible. Spectrum analyzers are available in various types, such as instrumentation devices 
and USB adapters, and now may be part of the wireless access point.
We compared Wi-Fi and non–Wi-Fi sources of interference, both of which can have an 
effect on the performance of a wireless network installation.
We looked at the various types of wireless site surveys that can be performed, including 
manual and predictive modeling. We also explored the two types of manual site surveys, 

418 
Chapter 9  ■  Design for Wireless Networking  
passive and active. You saw some of the items that may be included in a survey toolkit as 
well as temporary mounting examples for access points and antennas. We looked at the use 
of a protocol analyzer in a wireless site survey and how one could be used to identify exist-
ing wireless networks in the area of concern.
Finally, you learned about both multiple-channel architecture (MCA) and single-channel 
architecture (SCA) and the differences between them. Best practices for hardware place-
ment were also reviewed, including access points and antennas, as well as some of the limi-
tations that may be encountered during the wireless network site survey process.
Exam Essentials
Understand the business requirements of a wireless network.    Be familiar with the busi-
ness information required for a successful wireless network site survey. These business 
requirements include bandwidth needs, expected coverage area, and hardware and soft-
ware applications used (for the devices and the different technologies). Understand that the 
site survey process will vary based on the business model in which a wireless network is 
deployed. These will include enterprise, manufacturing, health care, and public access, to 
name a few.
Understand the interview process.    Know whom you should interview and the type of 
questions to ask during the site survey and design process. This will help ensure a more suc-
cessful wireless network deployment.
Identify the importance of site-specific documentation.    Know the various types of docu-
mentation required based on the business model for the wireless network site survey. This 
includes blueprints and floor plans as well as other important documentation.
Know the importance of identifying existing networks.    Understand the details of existing 
wired and wireless networks and be able to define the characteristics of both, such as wir-
ing closet location and power requirements.
Understand the application requirements for the wireless network.    Know that different 
applications, both software and hardware applications, will have an effect on the wireless 
network design, and the site survey must take this factor into consideration.
Understand RF coverage and capacity requirements.    Know the factors involved with pro-
viding adequate RF coverage within a wireless network deployment. Understand that with 
a wireless site survey, capacity requirements must be met to ensure acceptable performance.
Understand the need for an RF spectrum analysis and how to locate sources of interference.     
An RF spectrum analysis will allow you to “see” RF in an area proposed for a wireless network. 
Identify different types of RF interference that can have an effect on a wireless network.
Know the differences between manual and predictive modeling site surveys.    A manual 
site survey typically requires a complete walk-through and testing throughout the proposed 
area where a wireless network will be deployed. A predictive modeling site survey may 
require minimal time on site and is a software-based analysis solution.

Exam Essentials 
419  
Identify two different types of manual site surveys.    Know that manual site surveys can be 
passive or active and understand the differences between each.
Know how a protocol analyzer can be used as part of wireless network site survey.

Chapter 
10

Over the past several years we have seen the influx of mobile 
device technology and the concept of bring your own device 
(BYOD) within the corporate world. This has created some-
thing of an administrative challenge for the information technology professional. While 
some organizations embrace this concept, others are skeptical of the adoption for various 
reasons, including network capacity, technical support, and security concerns.
This chapter will explore the basics of mobile device management (MDM) options, 
including both on-premises and cloud-managed Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions. 
MDM solutions provide the capability to manage mobile devices of various platform types 
that connect to the corporate network. This includes access to digital applications (apps) 
via online stores. You will see that with MDM solutions, you will require special permis-
sions to perform specific tasks on mobile devices. We will explore how mobile apps and 
other device information can be pushed to devices. You will also see that devices can be 
grouped based on management requirements and why high availability is an important 
­feature of MDM.
Geo-fencing (building a virtual electronic boundary) and geo-location (the ability to 
locate a device physically) are two components of the mobile location services you will 
learn about. A captive portal allows network administrators to restrict access to a network 
until authentication has occurred or terms and conditions have been accepted. This pre-
vents users from accessing resources or services without proper authorization. Self-service 
portal solutions enable users to register their devices to the network, allowing for quick 
access to the network without the need to open a service ticket or contact the help desk for 
technical support. We will take a look at both the captive portal and self-service portal.
With respect to mobile computing, a policy is documentation that defines rules, restric-
tions, acceptable use, liability, and more. We will look at some of the basic components of a 
network security policy. The technology user must have a clear understanding of the policy 
and how to adhere to it in order to effectively use the network and services it provides. The 
contents of a policy will vary based on the business model or the organization type; there is 
really no one-size-fits-all policy.
This chapter provides a basic outline of some of the more common policy components 
that are part of the framework for most organizations. If a policy is too strict, it may ham-
per the ability for a user to perform the needed tasks while using the network; therefore, 
the appropriate balance between security and usability is important. Policies exist for many 
areas of mobile technology, including passwords/passcodes, remote access, data backup 
and restoration, and more. You will see an overview of and the importance of a backup and 
restore policy. Knowing how the mobile device’s operating system can affect the adherence 
to policy is another topic we will explore. Changes to the mobile operating system may also 
be limited based on the network security policy. We will explore profiles, which allow a

device to connect to a network and follow specific configurations, requirements, or settings 
for the connected session and how applying grouping concepts will help streamline mobile 
device administration. Finally, we will look at testing and pilot programs as they pertain to 
validating technology and changes within an existing network environment.
Mobile Device Management Solutions
The extensive increase in the number of multifunction wireless mobile devices gives users 
the opportunity to access information of all types from anyplace that provides infrastruc-
ture network access via technology such as cellular connections and WLANs (Wi-Fi). This 
includes the home, public venues, and the workplace. Although convenient and popular, 
this emerging mobile technology may create something of a challenge for the enterprise and 
corporate IT services professional and help desk support personnel. This is where MDM 
solutions stand out. MDM allows network managers, administrators, engineers, and other 
information technology personnel to manage, control, and secure multiplatform device 
environments that may be used on the network.
Choosing the correct MDM solution for your networking requirements involves some 
contemplation. The correct solution must meet the needs of the organization and will 
require careful consideration to validate it does so. When it comes to MDM, two main 
options exist. In-house (on-premises) solutions or cloud-managed solutions, which are 
provided as Software as a Service (SaaS) technology, are widely available. MDM solutions 
include, but are not limited to, the following features:
■
■
Application distribution (push technology)
■
■
Compliance reporting
■
■
Content management
■
■
Device registration (self-service portal)
■
■
Location-based services
■
■
Multiplatform management and support
■
■
Password control
■
■
Policy enforcement
■
■
Remote lock
■
■
Remote wipe
■
■
Remote unlock
■
■
Secure communications (VPN)
■
■
Telecommunications expense management
Many MDM solutions are available on the market today. If your organization allows 
employees, contractors, vendors, and others to use their own personal devices or company-
owned devices to access your network, you will need to ensure that the platforms are sup-
ported in order to lessen support calls and other associated costs.

428 
Chapter 10 ■ Mobile Device Management and BYOD Fundamentals
 
 Most, if not all, MDM providers offer a free trial period or will set up dem-
onstrations over the Internet for you to evaluate their software solutions 
and packages. We highly recommend you try these products prior to 
purchasing a specific provider’s solution. It is best to know that the solu-
tion you choose will meet your specific needs. There is no “one size fits 
all” when it comes to MDM solutions. Choosing the correct solution will 
depend on many factors, including business model, number of employees 
and devices, and company policy requirements. 
 You will now see an overview of both cloud-managed (SaaS) and on-premises solutions 
and how each has its own distinct advantages and disadvantages. 
 The Software as a Service Solution 
 When it comes to information technology services, the term  cloud seems to be the new-
est buzzword. Cloud-managed solutions are commonly known as  Software as a Service 
(SaaS) solutions and are not limited to MDM. In many cases, the SaaS MDM solution is a 
virtual on-premises solution that has many if not all of the same features but without the 
extra administration overhead and costs that go with the on-premises model. (On-premises 
MDM are discussed in the next section.) Other SaaS solutions include products that are 
truly managed services provided from certain software manufacturers. 
 Some of the advantages and disadvantages of a cloud-managed solution are as follows: 
 
■
 Advantages 
 
■
 Hardware investment is not required. 
 
■
 Installation and setup time is minimal compared to an on-premises solution. 
 
■
 Less administration overhead and potentially better availability compared to an 
on-premises solution. 
 
■
 Can be administered from any location where an Internet connection is available. 
 
■
 Disadvantages 
 
■
 Recurring monthly subscription fees. 
 
■
 Internet connection is required for all management and control. 
 
■
 Concerns for unauthorized access of data stored on cloud provider’s server if not 
properly secured. 
 Depending on the environment where it is deployed, the SaaS MDM solution will be a 
great fi t in many cases. We recommend additional research and reviewing the advantages 
and disadvantages to determine the best solution. 
 The On-Premises Solution 
 Many network managers and administrators have a certain comfort level with the idea of 
an on-premises MDM solution as with other on-premises technology. This is because these 

Mobile Device Management Solutions 
429  
solutions provide direct access and more control with the installed products. Some of the 
advantages and disadvantages of an on-premises solution are as follows:
■
■
Advantages
■
■
Can be maintained within the organization’s data center.
■
■
No recurring monthly subscription fees.
■
■
Internet connection is not required for management and control.
■
■
Ownership of the investment including associated hardware and software.
■
■
Disadvantages
■
■
Initial investment with required hardware and software.
■
■
Installation requires setup time and may require additional resources.
■
■
Administration overhead, backup solution, and technical support.
■
■
May require additional setup resources and administration from outside the 
­organization.
Choosing either a SaaS (cloud-managed) solution or an on-premises solution requires 
considering many factors, such as corporate policy, security concerns, and cost. It is best to 
compare all features, advantages, and disadvantages prior to purchasing any one specific 
solution. Following are some MDM solution providers that offer on-premises solutions, 
cloud-managed solutions, or both.

Common Mobile Device Operating 
System Platforms
There have been many mobile device operating systems over the past decade. Some have 
come and gone, and others have survived. For the corporate or enterprise mobile device 
user, there are still four main players in the current market: Android, BlackBerry, iOS, and 
Windows Phone.
Android    Android is an operating system based on Linux and designed for smartphones 
and tablet devices that are mostly touchscreen capable. This operating system was  
originally developed by Android, Inc., and was acquired by Google in 2005. The Open  
Handset Alliance (OHA) continues to update the operating system. The OHA  
(www.openhandsetalliance.com) is a consortium of approximately 84 firms that was  
created to develop open standards for mobile devices. According to a report published in 
early 2014 by Good Technology, enterprise Android activations were at about 26 percent 
compared to 72 percent for Apple iOS during the fourth quarter of 2013. More recent  
numbers in the fourth quarter of 2016 show Android dominated the market with an  
81.7 percent market share.
(continued)

The Mobile Application Store 
431  
BlackBerry    The first BlackBerry operating system was released in 1999 for the  
Pager 580. This operating system was designed by BlackBerry Limited and is propri-
etary to BlackBerry mobile devices. Synchronization of various corporate email services 
is where the BlackBerry operating system rose in popularity. BlackBerry 10 is the most 
recent release of the operating system. Although it has had its share of ups and downs, 
BlackBerry still continues to be a popular operating system in the corporate world for 
existing adoptions.
iOS    In 2007 Apple Inc. introduced the iOS mobile operating system for the iPhone.  
This operating system is now incorporated into other Apple devices, including iPod  
Touch, iPad, iPad Mini, and Apple TV devices. According to a report from The Verge  
(www.theverge.com/tech), the 2016 fourth quarter Apple iOS market share was  
17.9 percent, up slightly from 17.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Windows Phone    Microsoft released its proprietary mobile operating system,  
Windows Phone, also known as WP, in the fourth quarter of 2010. Windows Phone 
replaced Windows Mobile (last updated in February 2010); however, it is not backward 
­compatible with Windows Mobile. According to The Verge report, the Windows Phone 
operating system market share was about 0.3 percent over the fourth quarter of 2016, a 
very small ­number compared to Android and Apple iOS.
Mobile device multiplatform support must be considered prior to purchasing and imple-
menting an MDM solution. The type of business in which the solution will be deployed and 
whether employee-owned devices are allowed are factors that must be considered in the 
selection.
The Mobile Application Store
The mobile application store, or more commonly, app store, is a digital distribution 
platform consisting of different websites that allow users to obtain applications (apps) 
for their mobile devices. These apps may be available at no charge or may be fee-based. 
App stores fall under two different categories: enterprise app stores and consumer app 
stores.
The Enterprise Mobile App Store    The enterprise app store is a site that allows employees 
of an organization to visit for company-standard mobile apps. The enterprise mobile app 
store helps an organization to control and regulate the apps that are used within its envi-
ronment. The development of an on-premises app store can be involved and expensive, and 
therefore organizations that may not have the resources or funds for an on-premises solu-
tion can create their own store by using an online provider.
The Consumer Mobile App Store    The consumer mobile app store is intended for the com-
mon user to download or purchase commercial, off-the-shelf mobile apps. The following

 The use of mobile apps continues to grow at a very fast pace. As people become more 
dependent on mobile device technology, the need and variety of apps are constantly 
expanding. 
 
 As of March 2017, the Android Google Play Store had officially reached 
more than 2.8 million apps, compared to 1 million apps in July of 2013. 
 An emulator can be a valuable tool for testing prior to deploying MDM policies, applica-
tions, or other content. Exercise 10.1 shows you how to install a free emulator that you can 
use for a trial period.

Although using actual devices is a great technique for development and testing, emula-
tors of any type can be valuable tools for many aspects of technology. Computer-based 
Android and other mobile device emulators aid in software development, debugging, pilot 
test beds, and troubleshooting.
Pushing Content to Mobile Devices
Pushing content to mobile devices is a common requirement in enterprise device deploy-
ments. MDM solutions allow for corporate and other applications to be pushed to all speci-
fied mobile devices that connect to the corporate network, regardless of whether the device 
is a company-owned asset or an employee-owned personal device. This lessens the burden 
of requiring employees to visit the enterprise app store and download a specific app. In 
addition to apps, the following information can be pushed to mobile devices (among other 
types of information):
■
■
Operating systems and updates
■
■
Configuration information, such as Wi-Fi profiles and settings
■
■
Security information and updates
■
■
Videos
■
■
Email configurations

436 
Chapter 10  ■  Mobile Device Management and BYOD Fundamentals  
Some mobile device operating systems include platform-dependent native push services, 
such as the Apple Push Notification Service (APNS), which is required for Apple device 
MDM enrollments.
Mobile Device Management 
Administrative Permissions
You need to have the proper privileges to manage mobile devices from a corporate network, 
depending on the action to be performed. This is really no different than common day-to-day 
network administration tasks that are usually defined with the corporate network policy.
Mobile devices used to access corporate network resources may not be a corporate-owned 
asset and may be personal property of the employees. You may need special privileges, or 
administrative permissions, to use MDM solutions to perform the following actions:
■
■
Creating and maintaining mobile device policies
■
■
Grouping devices with the correct policy
■
■
Allowing for remote wipe, remote lock, remote unlock, and password control
The privileges will be defined as part of the network policy, and that task may be delegated 
to the organization responsible for computer network administration. Assigning administra-
tive permissions can be accomplished in different ways, depending on the MDM solution you 
choose. In the case of BYOD solutions, device owners will need to be familiar with the corpo-
rate policies regarding the use and administration of employee-owned devices. The end-user 
license agreement (EULA) process and how it is accepted will need to be defined for several 
reasons, including for legal purposes. The EULA and additional pertinent information will be 
discussed in more detail in the “End-User License Agreement” section later in this chapter.
Understanding Mobile Device 
Management High Availability  
and Redundancy
One important component of MDM services is to ensure that access will always be readily 
available. Consistent or high availability for any type of networking service is commonly 
accomplished by redundancy of some type and is not a new concept. Computer networking 
services redundancy dates back to the early days of local area networking. At that time, it 
was important to ensure that various types of data were always readily available and not 
just accessible from a data backup solution. This was handled in a variety of ways, includ-
ing hard drive storage failure protection by disk mirroring or using RAID technology. 
RAID is an acronym that is spelled out a couple of different ways, including Redundant 

Mobile Device Management Device Groups  
437  
Array of Inexpensive Disks. In the event of a hard drive or disk storage failure, the file 
server would be able to continue to operate and provide access to any stored data. Without 
this type of fault tolerance, the hardware would need to be repaired or replaced and the 
data restored from a backup, resulting in potentially significant network downtime.
File server redundancy, including grouping, or “clustering,” servers together for fault 
tolerance purposes is another method that would allow for high availability. The cost for 
this type of redundancy is higher because you would need to have completely redundant 
servers in the event of a catastrophic hardware failure. The benefit of this type of solution is 
100 percent uptime for the network services—hence, a higher cost.
The requirement for information to be always available with no downtime is becoming 
more common and will be part of a company’s best practice policies. MDM solutions are no 
different from other networking services, such as email and the reliable storage of informa-
tion. Therefore, redundancy will need to be considered to ensure the availability of appropri-
ate services. This is something that should be considered when evaluating an MDM solution 
for your organization and is more of a concern with on-premises MDM solutions. With 
SaaS, or cloud-managed, MDM solutions, the service provider will be responsible for the 
redundancy by providing redundant data centers, an uninterruptible power source (UPS), and 
redundant Internet connectivity, in addition to other common redundancy best practices.
Mobile Device Management  
Device Groups
Creating device groups within your MDM solution will help to streamline administration. 
Creating groups will allow the MDM administrator to identify profiles, applications, and 
other content that will need to be made available to the device user. This concept is similar 
to computer network administration. Organizing device groups will simplify management 
by providing common access to devices based on the requirements of the organization. 
Different options are available for an administrator to create device groups, which will 
depend on the specific network operating system and the directory service in use. The  
following directory service implementations are common:
■
■
Microsoft Windows Active Directory
■
■
Red Hat Directory Server
■
■
Novell eDirectory
■
■
Apple’s Open Directory
These directory services can be queried using Lightweight Directory Access Protocol 
(LDAP) and will aid in the simplification of the administration process.
Group management with MDM is an important component of the entire practice of 
MDM. Improper group development and assignments will potentially lead to many techni-
cal support incidents and troubleshooting issues. You can also create pilot and test groups 
that can be used prior to a large-scale deployment for policies, mobile apps, and other con-
figuration information.

Chapter 10  ■  Mobile Device Management and BYOD Fundamentals  
Location-Based Services
Location-based services (LBS) can be used in many ways. One use of LBS allows for vari-
ous types of assets and devices and even people to be geographically located by differ-
ent methods of radio frequency (RF) technology. These methods include radio frequency 
identification (RFID), Global Positioning System (GPS), and WLAN (Wi-Fi) technology. 
When it comes to mobility and mobile device technology, LBS is widely used with social 
media and mapping services to help identify the location of a mobile device for various 
purposes, including personal, work, and entertainment. The following sections provide a 
brief overview of LBS technology that is used with mobile device technology and a focus on 
geo-fencing and geo-location. LBS solutions can be software-based, hardware-based, or a 
combination of both.
Geo-fencing
A fence provides an enclosure at the perimeter of an area. This enclosure is designed to 
keep items from leaving and entering an area and to know what is contained within an 
area. Geo-fencing from a mobile computing perspective is taking this concept to an entire 
new level. This virtual electronic boundary allows network administrators to identify when 
specific mobile devices enter or leave an area. With the explosion of the number of mobile 
devices that are now used, keeping private company information within the boundary of 
the organization is critical. This is just one example of how geo-fencing is used. Figure 10.1 
shows how geo-fencing is a boundary surrounding a specific geographic area.
F i g u r e  10 .1    Geo-fencing example

Location-Based Services 
439  
Commonly used with GPS or WLAN technology, geo-fencing–enabled devices can be 
managed from within the MDM solution. Tasks include managing device features, activat-
ing/deactivating devices, restricting access to specific apps such as games and social media, 
and protecting private company information. Disabling the use of other device features, 
such as built-in cameras, can also be accomplished with MDM.
From the consumer side, geo-fencing is also popular with social media applications. These 
applications allow a user to notify their friends or colleagues when they leave a specific loca-
tion or when they arrive at a new location. The opportunities are endless as to how this can 
be used, including intentionally informing someone of a location, iOS reminders (which are 
intended to provide an alert when arriving at or leaving a specific location), and even shopping.
Geo-location
Geo-location technology allows for many different device types to be geographically 
located. The following devices are among those that can use this technology:
■
■
Smartphones
■
■
Tablets
■
■
Computers
With geo-location, different methods can be used to locate a device. One example is time 
difference of arrival (TDoA), which is a multilateration technology technique. TDoA will 
measure the difference in distance between two stations from known locations. This provides 
an accurate method for locating a device. Another method of identifying the physical loca-
tion is by using the device’s assigned IP address to provide specific information about the 
physical location of the connected device. Figure 10.2 shows how geo-location can pinpoint 
a device at a precise location.
F i g u r e  10 . 2    Geo-location can identify the physical location of a device.

440 
Chapter 10  ■  Mobile Device Management and BYOD Fundamentals  
The use of geo-location technology covers a wide range of applications. Although with 
consumer mobile devices, the user has the capability to disable geo-location technology, 
many opt not to do so. This is because either they are not aware that the technology exists 
and is enabled or they plan to use it for social media purposes. Geo-location technology 
can be used for marketing, social media, and enterprise device security.
Mobile Device Telecommunications 
Expense Management
Managing expenses for mobile device technology can be a daunting task. Many MDM solu-
tions, either on-premises or cloud-managed SaaS, offer telecommunications expense manage-
ment features. One common concern with mobile device technology is that users exceed the 
amount of data communications available to their device or their data plan. Unlimited data 
plans are becoming a thing of the past, and data use will need to be strictly managed. This is 
where telecommunications expense management plays a role. Enabled devices allow MDM 
systems to handle data plan management and other tasks, including invoicing, identifying 
excessive roaming, and disabling data capability for lost or underutilized devices. While many 
carriers are doing away with unlimited data plans, some are increasing the data cap allowed 
for customers while keeping the price the same. Therefore, the battle to retain or get new cus-
tomers continues to build amongst the wireless carriers. Some will even pay an early termina-
tion fee to try to get subscribers to change to their company. Carriers continue to build out 
their wireless network infrastructure, providing the ability to handle the increased data usage.
Captive and Self-Service Portals
The following sections compare two different methods that mobile devices can use to access 
resources on a network, including wireless networks: captive portals and self-service portals.
Captive Portals
A captive portal, sometimes called a walled garden, is a web page redirection that a wire-
less device user is presented with after performing an IEEE 802.11 open system authentica-
tion and IEEE 802.11 association when connecting to a wireless (Wi-Fi) network. Captive 
portals are not limited to Wi-Fi networks, but this is one network type where they are often 
used. In order for the user to access permitted resources or gain wireless network access, a 
web page will require them to authenticate in some way, which may include the following:
■
■
Entering user credentials (username and password)
■
■
Inputting payment information
■
■
Agreeing to terms and conditions

Captive and Self-Service Portals 
441  
When one or more of these methods is used, the wireless device will be able to access 
the network and use whatever resources they have permissions to use. Most public access 
wireless networks have some type of captive portal enabled. This includes networks at pub-
lic venues such as hotels, coffeehouses, restaurants, and airports. This will help to protect 
both the provider (host) and the user of the wireless network. Private corporate networks 
also use captive portals when a user connects to the guest service set identifier (SSID). Using 
captive portal authentication with enterprise guest networks will ensure that a user is con-
necting to an authorized company access point and not a potential rogue access point. 
Most enterprise-grade wireless access points, including cloud-managed access points and 
WLAN controllers, have built-in captive portal capabilities that are fairly straightforward 
and easy to implement.
Keep in mind that a captive portal does not offer security of any data and only provides 
a way for network infrastructure devices to restrict device and user access to a network 
until some type of successful authentication has been provided. This “authentication” could 
be as simple as agreeing to a “Terms and Conditions” web page. After a user connects to 
a wireless network through a captive portal, additional security measures should be put in 
place. For public networks, this includes options such as VPN connections or using a secure 
protocol like HTTPS, at a minimum. With a corporate network, additional authentication 
may include WPA2 passphrase authentication or IEEE 802.1X/EAP user/certificate-based 
authentication. Security concepts are discussed in Chapter 8, “Security Fundamentals for 
Wireless Networking.”
Self-Service Portals
MDM platforms often include self-service portal functionality to allow mobile device users 
to register their devices and connect to a network. With the concept of BYOD continuing to 
grow and more personal devices being allowed to connect to a corporate network, a self-
service portal will help by requiring less administration overhead and therefore providing 
a cost savings to the organization. The MDM platform that is used will determine which 
management features the user will have access to.
A self-service portal is a method of on-boarding a device and allowing it to comply with 
the appropriate company/device policy. The way these portals operate will vary based on 
how each MDM platform incorporates the technology. If a user already has a user logon 
account such as a Microsoft Windows Active Directory account, it may be as simple as 
entering their credentials to start the on-boarding process. If they are a guest or new user, 
they will need to have an account created.
Here is one example of the self-service portal process.
1.	
Create an account for the device user. This is usually done from an administrative  
console page.
2.	
A username, first and last name, email address, and phone number is usually required.
3.	
An email will be sent to the user with information regarding the device registration.
4.	
The user will then access the self-service portal web page logon screen, which requires 
them to accept any terms and conditions or specific device policies.

442 
Chapter 10 ■ Mobile Device Management and BYOD Fundamentals
 5. 
 The user will then select their device type (iOS, Android, or other). 
 6. 
 Depending on the use of device, a guest network or company network will determine 
the capabilities and policies. 
 7. 
 A text message will be sent to the device with a password or PIN, which will then 
allow the user to access to the network. 
 The preceding steps represent a generic process, and it is important to understand that 
the steps and processes will vary depending on the MDM platform you are using. 
 
 Users may also be able to use their company credentials to log on to a 
guest network portal. If the company has an agreement with the provider 
or wireless carrier, the credentials may be transferable. For example, when 
the user enters an area that charges for Wi-Fi service with which their com-
pany has an agreement, instead of paying for access, the user can log on 
using their company credentials. Many users may not even be aware such 
agreements exist. 
 Many benefi ts are available to the user of the device that is now being managed, includ-
ing but not limited to the following: 
 
■
 Locating a device 
 
■
 Locking a device 
 
■
 Requesting information from a device 
 
■
 Remotely wiping a device 
 One example where these features will prove helpful is when a device is lost or stolen; 
these features can help protect the integrity of the information contained within the device. 
 General Technology Network 
and Security Policy 
 The defi nition of the term  policy will vary based on its specifi c use. For example, an auto-
mobile insurance policy is a contract between an insurance provider and an individual 
known as the policyholder. The insurance policy identifi es details about specifi c agreements 
concerning what the policy covers and the responsibility of the provider if a claim is fi led 
by the policyholder. With regards to technology, a security policy defi nes an agreement 
between a corporation or the technology provider and the technology user. This agreement 
defi nes the specifi c use as well as the terms and conditions with which the user will comply 
while using the provider’s network and services. 
 The specifi c use of the network or services will determine the type of policy and the 
specifi cs that are contained within. For example, companies that work within the medical 

Information Technology and Security Policy Implementation and Adherence 
443
fi eld will need to understand compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) in addition to the general policy framework. Another com-
mon example is that organizations that process, store, or transmit credit card information 
must comply with the Payment Card Industry (PCI) standards. You learned about these and 
other industry regulatory compliance considerations in Chapter  8 . 
 Security Policy Framework 
 Keep in mind that a network security policy’s contents will vary based on the specifi c type 
of business or application in which it is applied. For example, the policy for an organization 
that handles fi nancial information will be different from the policy for a manufacturing 
company. Most policies, however, are based on a general framework. Using this framework 
will enable you to build a policy that will meet the needs of the organization. 
 Typically, a computer network security policy consists of two main parts: general policy 
components and functional, or technical, components. The general policy components 
consist of the policy purpose and business justifi cation, management approval, policy defi -
nition and documentation processes, training policies, revision processes, violations and 
response, legal concerns, and potential threat assessment. The functional, or technical, 
side commonly consists of administrator and user training, monitoring, auditing, response 
and forensics, defi ning acceptable use, and security requirements, including authentication, 
encryption, and passcode and password policies. Keep in mind this is a general framework 
that can be used as a guide to assist in developing an actual security policy. 
 
 The best way to learn the components and features of MDM solutions, 
including defining profiles to help enforce security policy, is to actually eval-
uate one and use it. Earlier in this chapter you saw several manufacturers of 
MDM solutions. Most of these companies provide evaluation or trial periods 
of their products. Here we will be using examples from Windows Intune, a 
cloud-managed management solution from Microsoft. You can register for a 
free trial to evaluate this product at  www.microsoft.com/intune .  
 Information Technology and Security 
Policy Implementation and Adherence 
 Every company or organization that provides technology resources of any type should 
already have an information technology and security policy in place for its computer net-
work. If this is not the case, then it should be a very high priority to get one in place as 
quickly as possible. Given that various wireless technologies are becoming a major part of 
all networks, it is critical for wireless and mobility technology to be part of this security 
policy. 

444 
Chapter 10  ■  Mobile Device Management and BYOD Fundamentals  
If a security policy already exists, adding the wireless technologies that are used will be 
a fairly straightforward process. Getting the right people involved is essential for the imple-
mentation and success of a security policy. This includes the information technology group 
as well as the management team.
A well-designed policy is critical in order for network security to be successful, balanced, and 
maintained. Because wireless networks use the RF spectrum for communications, the legal use 
of unlicensed and licensed RF bands will also need to be understood to ensure compliance with 
the local governing regulating bodies and the appropriate authorities. The wireless communica-
tions/network portion of the security policy should include, at a minimum, sections defining the 
purpose, scope, policy details, enforcement information, and revisions/maintenance.
Purpose    This section should provide an overview of why the policy has been put in place 
and define the importance of compliance. This ensures that everyone understands that mis-
use could result in severe interference with the intended use of the network and may put the 
organization and users at serious security risks.
Scope    The scope should provide an overview of whom the policy will apply to, the use of 
the wireless spectrum, the acceptable use policy, and the importance of compliance.
Policy Details    This section should contain a basic overview of the wireless technology 
that will be used, including the allowed RF spectrum and the wireless technology and 
devices that can or cannot be used. This section should also identify some of the more 
technical aspects, such as user authentication and data encryption, the tolerance for specific 
types of network traffic and RF interference, and acceptable applications.
Policy Enforcement    This section should define any actions, potentially including poten-
tial, that will be taken against those who are not in compliance.
Revisions/Maintenance    With the frequent changes in technology, a security policy can 
be somewhat of a moving target. Revisions and maintenance, including a change record 
or revision history page, should be documented. Figure 10.3 shows an example of a cloud-
managed MDM program that can be used to create device profiles based on policy and 
provide policy enforcement.

Backup, Restore, and Recovery Policies 
445  
Acceptable Use Policy
One of the most basic, common, and important policies for computer networking is an 
acceptable use policy. This is typically a policy that the user must comply with in order to 
access and use any computer network resources or services. At a minimum, the acceptable 
use policy will outline the rules regarding what a user can and cannot do. In most cases this 
is an abbreviated version of the complete policy that the user will be referred to and have 
access to if further detail or clarification is needed. Most organizations require all users 
to sign and agree to this policy. This could be in the form of a physical document or in an 
electronic format. For the mobile wireless guest user, the acceptable use policy may come 
in the form of a web-based captive portal and usually includes restrictions and limitations. 
You learned about captive and self-service portals in Chapter 8 and earlier in this chapter.
Balancing Security and Usability
When it comes to policy, the ability to maintain a good balance between security and 
usability is a key factor. Some people believe that you can have too much of a good thing. 
If a policy is too tight, it may limit productivity or a user’s ability to utilize their devices 
correctly and to get their job done. On the other hand, if a policy is too loose, it could 
potentially compromise the security and integrity of the corporate network. Therefore, an 
accurate balance between the two must be closely evaluated. A poorly balanced security 
policy is directly proportional to a policy failure. One example is a passcode or password 
policy. Most industry best practices agree that the longer and more complex a passcode is, 
the more secure it will be. However, if it is too long or complex, a user may have difficulty 
remembering it, or depending on the device, it may be a challenge to type it in. Another 
example is what exactly the user of the device is allowed to do. Can they install and remove 
apps? Can they modify the system’s or device’s settings? All options must be carefully con-
sidered in order to maintain a good balance. Much of this will also depend on the type of 
organization where the device is used. Finding the correct balance will be a challenge and 
is contingent on understanding what you are trying to protect and what you are trying to 
prevent.
Backup, Restore, and Recovery Policies
Regardless of whether a device is a company asset or is employee-owned, the importance 
of backup, restore, and recovery policies cannot be overestimated. A well-written backup 
policy that can be easily understood and implemented will make what is usually considered 
an unpleasant or often ignored task much easier to comply with. Mobile devices that are 
used to store corporate data and intellectual property information such as trade secrets 
must correctly implement and adhere to the specified policy. Automating this task as much 
as possible will lessen the reliance on the device’s user interaction and allow for a better 
chance of policy compliance.

446 
Chapter 10  ■  Mobile Device Management and BYOD Fundamentals  
Many may think of device backup as only something that is used for recovering data 
that may be lost because of device failure or unintentionally deleted. With mobile devices, 
you must also take into consideration that a device can be stolen or lost, which will then 
put all information that is stored on that device at risk if the device falls into the wrong 
hands. In such a situation, a network administrator can use an MDM solution to easily 
locate the device over the Internet using location services and remotely back up the data 
stored on the device to a corporate file server or cloud-managed storage network. After a 
backup is complete, the device can be securely locked or even remotely wiped to provide 
additional security.
Operating System Modifications  
and Customization
Mobile device operating systems are designed to offer specific features and capabilities. 
This allows for consistent functionality and operation of the devices that run the operating 
systems. However, many hardware device manufacturers customize the device to operate 
with some of their specific features and to include their company branding. In addition, the 
owner of the device may be able to add their own customizations, which may include:
■
■
Fonts
■
■
Home screens
■
■
Ring tones
■
■
Wallpaper
■
■
Widgets
The fact that some operating systems, such as Android, are open source provides many 
opportunities for the device manufacturer or the owner to add their own unique flair.
Manufacturers of mobile device technology usually have certain features “locked 
down,” which means they cannot be changed. However, some devices may be “rooted” or 
“jailbroken” to remove the manufacturer’s restrictions. Android rooting and iOS jailbreaking 
can void the device manufacturer’s warranty and cause other issues.
Operating System Vendors
Earlier in this chapter, we explored some of the popular mobile device operating systems, 
including Android, BlackBerry, Apple iOS, and Windows Phone. Chances are very high 
that organizations that allow employee-owned devices to access the company network 
will have a mix of these and other various devices with different operating system ven-
dor platforms. The ability to integrate the various devices and operating systems into the 
environment may come with certain challenges that limit capabilities among the different 

Operating System Modifications and Customization  
447  
vendors. These capabilities include the remote management of the devices, general sup-
port for different operating systems features, and specific technology capabilities, such as 
passwords and resets.
Because of the diverse number of devices and available operating systems installed, the 
MDM administrator should be proactive with keeping up to date with any technology 
changes. Some of the methods an administrator can use to stay current with mobile tech-
nology changes include:
■
■
Social media
■
■
Subscribing to available services from the manufacturers
■
■
Rich Site Summary (RSS) services or feeds
■
■
Online webinars and training sessions
The proactive approach will allow the administrator to prevent potential issues or 
problems from occurring by becoming familiar with various limitations between the 
mobile device operating systems in use.
Original Equipment Manufacturer
The definition of original equipment manufacturer (OEM) may vary depending on the con-
text in which it is used. In the automobile industry, the term “OEM part” is a replacement 
part that is manufactured by the same company that made the original part. This gives the 
buyer confidence that the part will be an exact replacement and will work as designed.
With regards to mobile technology, one definition is when a company purchases the rights 
to resell a product under its own brand name. One example is the ability for different manu-
facturers to sell smart phones that run the Android operating system. Integrating directory 
services into an MDM solution may allow an administrator to use an existing directory  
database to help streamline user/device authentication and enrollments and can help to 
gather information from the managed device and the connected user.
Vendor-Default Device Applications
Mobile device operating systems often have default applications that are installed by the 
manufacturer. These applications may include Internet browsers, email applications, 
video, audio/music, documents viewers, and others. The type of file that is accessed will 
determine which application is launched to manage or open that file. Users of Android 
devices can select which application they want to use to complete a task. Users can use the 
selected program to “always” open future files that are of that same type, or they can spec-
ify to open the file “just once.” If users choose the latter option, they will be presented with 
the option again when a file of the same type is opened. If a user changes their mind and 
later wants to use a different application, they can easily reset the default application. In 
Exercise 10.2 you will reset the default application for a device that is running the Android 
operating system.

Resetting the Default Application—Android
This short exercise demonstrates one way to reset the default applications on a device 
using the Android operating system. Keep in mind these steps may vary based on the 
operating system and the version that is in use.
1.	
Select the Android Settings icon.
2.	
Select Applications.
3.	
Select the application that is currently set to open the file type you would like to 
change.
4.	
Scroll down to launch by default and tap Clear Defaults.
5.	
You will be prompted to select an application type the next time that file type is 
launched.
Technology Profiles
Profiles are used in wireless networking to provide configuration or settings information 
and to help with security policy compliance. Saving this information within a profile helps 
to lessen the overhead of entering specific information every time you wish to connect to a 
network or access a network resource. Profiles can be used in a variety of scenarios—for 
example, with IEEE 802.11 wireless networking client devices or connecting to a VPN 
from a client to a VPN concentrator. Mobile device profiles using MDM will simplify and 
streamline access to an infrastructure and device management. You learned about VPN 
technology in Chapter 8.
Mobile Device Profiles
A profile is a set of parameters or instructions that will provide a device the ability to 
connect to a network and follow specific requirements or settings for the connected ses-
sion. These profiles will define specific settings and configuration information in addition 
to restrictions based on the device itself and who is using the device. The profiles can be 
assigned for operating systems, individuals, and groups. Profiles may contain configuration 
information for the following:
■
■
Email access
■
■
Internet access
■
■
Network configuration information

■
■
Wi-Fi access

VPN configuration information
In addition to configuration and settings, a profile will help maintain security policy 
compliance. Figure 10.4 is an example of a cloud-managed MDM software application that 
can be used to set password policy enforcement.

Directory Services Integration
From a computer networking perspective, a directory service is similar to that of a database 
where information about specific objects can be created, stored, and retrieved. An analogy 
is a simple address book contained within a smartphone. You could enter specific informa-
tion about contacts, such as their name, various phone numbers, an email address, and 
much more. Searching a person by name will provide any additional information that is 
documented about that contact.
Microsoft Windows Active Directory and Novell eDirectory are examples of computer 
network directory services. These are X.500-compliant directory services and are used to 
centrally manage users, groups, devices, and other resources. A network administrator can 
create user and group objects and allow them access to various network resources, such as a 
shared folder on a file server or a network printer. Integrating directory services allows a net-
work administrator to assign mobile device applications, user and device profiles, and other 
data that can be associated with their directory services group membership. Depending on 
the MDM solution that is used, you can also synchronize any changes that are made to the 
directory database to the mobile device policy that it is connected to. This will include any 
changes that are made to the user, device, or group object that the device is associated with. 
Deleting a user object in the directory services database will allow the MDM software to 
take the appropriate designated action.

Chapter 10  ■  Mobile Device Management and BYOD Fundamentals  
Issuing Digital Certificates
A digital certificate can be used as an access control method for various mobile devices, 
computers, and other devices and will ensure that only valid authorized users will gain 
access to the corporate network infrastructure. Certificates are one method of access con-
trol used to confirm that a person is who they say they are. This will help to restrict access 
to a system or resource only to those who are entitled to the access. Digital certificates can 
use a security concept known as a public key infrastructure (PKI). In a full PKI deploy-
ment, digital certificates are required on the RADIUS server and the client device. Installing 
digital certificates can be streamlined using MDM software to issue the certificates auto-
matically without relying on any input from the user of the device.
End-User License Agreement
When a user installs proprietary software on a device, they must agree to and comply 
with the EULA. This is basically an agreement between the creator of the software pack-
age and the organization or person who purchased the software. Most software programs 
used within the mobility environment include a screen that provides specifics regarding the 
EULA and is usually shown at the beginning of the installation process. This will include 
some basic information that the user must agree to before continuing.
It is very important that the organization understands the EULA for legal and liability 
management regarding mobile device technology and employee-owned devices. In most cases 
these are customized by the legal department to ensure the EULA complies with the company 
objectives and covers the specific use of the software. Keep in mind that in many cases this is a 
scaled-down version of a more complete document that defines all the specifics in more detail.
Figure 10.5 shows an example of a cloud-managed MDM administration console used 
to create a license agreement.

Understanding Group Profiles 
451  
Notice in Figure 10.5 that this program allows an administrator to enter the license name, 
software publisher, product title, license count, and start and end dates. When a user connects 
to the portal, they will be able to agree to the license agreement and install the program.
Understanding Group Profiles
For anyone who has performed basic computer network administration tasks, understand-
ing group profiles should be fairly straightforward. Managing a network and access to its 
resources is much easier and streamlined when using a grouping methodology. See the case 
study to examine one specific scenario.
Assigning Access to Network Resources Using the Group Technique
You are a network administrator and have three departments in the company that each requires 
access to specific resources located within the computer network. The departments are sales 
(10 members), engineering (3 members), and consultants (2 members). The sales department 
requires access to a marketing database; the engineering department must be able to access 
product technical specifications; and the consultants department requires access to specific 
company briefings. There are two ways to approach this. One would be to explicitly assign 
permissions to the resources to the members of each department. The second way would be 
to create a group object for each department, add the members to each group, and assign the 
groups access to the resources. If a user no longer requires access to the network service or 
resource in which they have permissions via the group membership, the administrator can 
remove them from the group, thereby removing their access. Using groups helps to streamline 
the administration process of mobile devices by reducing repetitive administrator work in main-
taining policy compliance and allowing access to network resources and services.

452 
Chapter 10  ■  Mobile Device Management and BYOD Fundamentals  
The first option is an inefficient method of administration because any changes are made 
on an individual per-user basis and would require potentially extra administration and 
overhead. The second option is more efficient because any changes are on a per-group 
basis.
The case study described here is very similar to the concept of creating profiles for 
devices within an MDM environment. The needs of the individual, whether the device 
is company-owned, and departments the user of the device belongs to will be factors in 
determining the capabilities of the device and the user. Some common profiles for specific 
devices and users with MDM techniques include the following:
■
■
Corporate-owned devices
■
■
Employee-owned devices (BYOD)
■
■
Outside consultants’ and visitors’ devices
Corporate-Owned Mobile Device Profiles
Issuing corporate-owned mobile devices to employees provides a network administrator 
with much-needed control over how the device is managed. Unlike with employee-owned 
mobile device profiles (discussed next), there is less concern about the type of applica-
tions or data that is used or stored on the device, because the network administrator can 
have complete control over ensuring that applications and profiles that are installed on the 
device comply with corporate security policy. Something to consider is whether personal 
applications and data will be allowed on a corporate-owned device. The corporate security 
policy will need to define exactly how this is handled.
Employee-Owned Mobile Device Profiles
Devices that are employee-owned will require special consideration as to what exactly a 
user can or cannot do with the device once it is connected to the corporate wireless net-
work. The continued growth of the BYOD concept has raised concerns regarding security 
and network capacity. However, the benefits of BYOD must also be considered. A company, 
organization, or school can leverage employee-owned or personal devices to provide a cost 
savings by allowing these devices to be used on the company network.
In cases such as this, the correct provisioning and policy compliance will need to be 
closely evaluated. If employee-owned devices are allowed to be used on the corporate 
network, containerization of applications and data should be considered. This will allow 
corporate applications and data to be stored, maintained, and managed separate from the 
employee’s own personal data. In the event a device is lost, stolen, or unaccounted for, the 
MDM software program can take the appropriate action to mitigate any potential security 

Policy and Profile Pilot Testing 
453  
concerns by performing a device lockdown or remote wipe of the corporate data installed 
on the device. The owner of the device that is used on the organization’s network must be 
made aware that with certain security threats the appropriate action will be taken in order 
to secure the device and protect any confidential company data.
MDM providers offer different mechanisms or processes using containerization technol-
ogy. It is recommended as part of the software evaluation and trial period that you take a 
close look at how the manufacturer deals with this concept and try to determine whether 
their way would be a good fit for your organization.
The practice of companies allowing employee-owned devices on the corporate net-
work will continue to grow. Gartner, Inc., estimates that by the end of 2017 more than  
50 percent of companies will require that employees supply their own devices for use on  
the corporate network, helping to justify the use of MDM solutions and technology.
Outside Consultants’ and Visitors’  
Mobile Device Profiles
Depending on the business model or organization type, providing network access to outside 
consultants and visitors can be considered somewhat of a challenge. In many cases, con-
necting to the organization’s network, wired or wireless, is not allowed under any circum-
stances. In such situations, it is not uncommon for the organization to provide a third-party 
service, such as a cable modem or digital subscriber line (DSL) connection from an Internet 
Service Provider (ISP), to allow outside Internet access for the guest user. A benefit of this 
scenario is that the outside consultants will in no way be connected to the organization’s 
network infrastructure, which may be a requirement in the network security policy. If this 
type of service is not provided or allowed, then the only option a consultant will have is to 
use a cellular data connection, such as 3G, 4G, or LTE, to get outside access.
For various reasons, including security, many organizations allow physical wired access 
to a network only to its employees but will allow wireless network access via a connection to 
the guest wireless network. This guest network is typically on a completely separate virtual 
local area network (VLAN) to ensure it meets the requirements of the network security 
policy. In this situation, it is important to define how the outside devices will be able to 
connect and what exactly they will be able to do once they are connected. Defining require-
ments such as content filtering, the amount of bandwidth, and time restrictions are some 
examples of the limitations guest networks may be subject to. Most of these restrictions can 
be achieved through the use of an MDM profile.
Policy and Profile Pilot Testing
Before any new technology, software, or changes are deployed, it is beneficial to perform 
pilot testing within key areas of the organization in order to validate that the technology 
will work as specified and designed. This is a concept that is true with various types of 

454 
Chapter 10  ■  Mobile Device Management and BYOD Fundamentals  
technology, including but not limited to Voice over Wi-Fi (VoWi-Fi) handsets, client device 
deployments, firmware updates, software patches, fixes and upgrades, and, of course, 
mobile device policy and profiles. Although some consider this an option rather than a 
requirement, this process must be carefully considered, as it is best to find any issues that 
may arise on a smaller scale rather than after a full deployment or upgrade. The pilot pro-
gram process will vary depending on how and where the technology is used, the scale of 
the deployment, the type of technology, and who is performing the testing. Some common 
steps that may be used as part of pilot program testing include the following:
■
■
Selecting the individuals or groups to be part of the test
■
■
Soliciting feedback and monitoring the testing phase
■
■
Making adjustments or changes as needed based on the results
■
■
Getting proper approval from change management
■
■
Implementing full deployment throughout the organization
It is also important to monitor the devices and users after the implementation has 
occurred and to solicit feedback in order to identify any issues that were not identified dur-
ing the pilot program testing.
Summary
In this chapter you learned about how the influx of mobile device technology and the con-
cept of BYOD create administrative challenges and how these challenges can be addressed 
by implementing an MDM solution. We explored the basics of MDM solutions, including 
both cloud-managed (SaaS) and on-premises solutions. You saw that various platforms 
can be managed using an MDM solution, and the management options included access 
to applications (apps) via online stores. As with computer network administration, MDM 
solutions require special permissions to perform specific tasks on a mobile device.
We also explored the pushing of content to mobile devices. Devices can be grouped 
based on management requirements. By grouping servers, you can provide a high availabil-
ity solution to help ensure maximum uptime for the services provided. We looked at how 
location-based services, including geo-fencing and geo-location, allow a virtual electronic 
boundary to be built or a device’s location to be pinpointed within a specific area. Finally, 
we explored the concepts of both the captive portal and the self-service portal. You saw 
that how policies are defined will depend on the organization in which they are used. You 
learned about the basic components of a network security policy, which include the pur-
pose, scope, details, enforcement, and maintaining changes. We explained the importance 
of an acceptable use policy and that most organizations require employees and guests to 
agree to the terms and conditions of this type of policy. You saw the importance of balanc-
ing security and usability and looked at some common networking policies, such as device 
backup, restore, and recovery. In addition to policies, you learned about device technology 
profiles, which contain configuration or settings information for the device based on the

user and that can also incorporate specific profiles. Finally, you saw the importance of test-
ing technology, mobile device profiles, and policies by using pilot programs and validating 
any potential implementation issues prior to a full-scale deployment.
Exam Essentials

Troubleshooting and maintenance are important parts of a 
successful IEEE 802.11 WLAN deployment. Wireless net-
works, like most areas of technology, do require support and 
maintenance. The extent of this will depend on the size and complexity of the network. 
Troubleshooting problems is a key component in the maintenance, reliability, and operation 
of an IEEE 802.11 wireless network. A WLAN technical support engineer will encounter all 
the same problems that occur with regular networking as well as additional problems because 
this technology uses radio frequency (RF) for communication and to exchange information.
In this chapter, you will learn about common problems associated with standards-based 
IEEE 802.11 wireless networking, how to identify problems based on the symptoms, and how 
to determine whether they are global (affecting many) or isolated (affecting an individual). These 
problems range in complexity and magnitude, and many times are associated with the following:
■
■
Wireless connectivity
■
■
RF received signal strength
■
■
WLAN throughput
■
■
Wireless infrastructure and client device upgrades
Troubleshooting is not something that can be learned overnight or from reading a book. 
Troubleshooting is an acquired skill that requires many hours of hard work and is some-
times learned from the “school of hard knocks.” This is true with any type of troubleshoot-
ing, not just computer networking. Becoming a good mechanic, for example, takes years of 
working with automobiles to learn how to diagnose and perform the necessary repairs.
The steps involved in troubleshooting a wireless networking problem will vary, and they 
depend on the complexity of the network and the environment. In this chapter, you will 
learn about causes and solutions associated with throughput, connectivity, signal strength, 
and upgrades. We will also explore procedures used for optimizing a wireless network. 
Some of these topics may sound familiar because they are also related to site surveys; how-
ever, you may have to make changes to accommodate physical environment conditions that 
have an impact on a WLAN installation. Finally, we will review multipath and the effect it 
has on an IEEE 802.11 WLAN and look at different types of hidden node problems, which 
are a very common issue associated with wireless networks.
Identifying Wireless LAN Problems
A first step in troubleshooting WLAN problems is to identify whether an issue is 
global or isolated. Global issues often include wired and wireless infrastructure devices 
and components. A global problem usually involves many client devices or groups of 

Identifying Wireless LAN Problems

devices. Some of the wireless devices that can be related to a global problem include the 
following:
■
■
Wireless access points
■
■
Wireless bridges
■
■
WLAN controllers
■
■
Wired infrastructure devices
In addition to wireless infrastructure devices like access points, wired infrastructure 
components like Ethernet switches or Layer 3 routers can also be a potential source of 
global problems. Keep in mind that wireless client devices nearly always require a wired 
infrastructure in order to pass information between infrastructure devices or outside the 
wireless network. Devices and components that can contribute to wired infrastructure 
problems include the following:
■
■
Ethernet cabling
■
■
Ethernet switches
■
■
Layer 3 routers
■
■
Wide area network (WAN) connectivity
■
■
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) issues
The point is to take into consideration the wired side of a wireless network. As shown 
in Figure 11.1, many components can be the source of problems associated with wireless 
networking.

Chapter 11  ■  Troubleshooting for Wireless Networking  
Once it has been determined whether the problem is global or isolated, appropriate steps 
are necessary to determine the solution. Before we look at common problems associated 
with IEEE 802.11 wireless networking, however, it is important to understand a little more 
detail about how WLAN technology functions. This includes understanding the compo-
nents used to send and receive RF information:
■
■
RF transmitters
■
■
RF receivers
Radio Frequency Transmitters and Receivers
IEEE 802.11 wireless networks use RF to send and receive data. This is possible because 
all wireless devices have transmitter and/or receiver capability. Unlike a television or 
FM radio you may have in your home, both of which are only receivers, all IEEE 802.11 
WLAN devices have the capability to act as either a transmitter or a receiver (also known 
as a transceiver). The following sections explain transmitter and receiver functionality in 
order to provide the groundwork necessary to diagnose and resolve IEEE 802.11 wireless 
networking problems.
Radio Transmitters
In wireless networking, a transmitter combines binary digital computer data (all the 1s and 
0s) with high-frequency alternating current (AC) signals to prepare it to be sent across the 
air. This is known as modulation. The connected antenna then transforms this signal into 
radio waves (electromagnetic energy) and propagates them through the air. The frequency 
of the signal depends on the technology in use. With IEEE 802.11 standards-based wireless 
networking, there are a few select frequency ranges.
Radio Receivers
A receiver collects the propagated signal from the air using an antenna and reverses the process 
by transforming the received signal back into an alternating current signal. Through the 
use of a demodulation process, the digital data is recovered. The modulation/demodulation 
technology used depends on the wireless standard or amendment with which the device is 
compliant. For example, an IEEE 802.11g/n WLAN will use 64QAM (quadrature ampli-
tude modulation) when transmitting data at up to 600 Mbps. Figure 11.2 illustrates this 
entire process. Keep in mind that WLAN devices are transceivers, so they have the capa-
bility of performing either task. In this figure, the access point is the transmitter, and the 
client device is the receiver. The details of modulation technologies are beyond the scope of 
the exam objectives and are not covered in this book.
Figure 11.2 sums up the entire process of IEEE 802.11 WLAN communications dis-
cussed throughout this book and is an introduction to understanding the process of 
troubleshooting.

Many factors can cause connectivity problems in IEEE 802.11 WLANs. Wired computer

have connection issues unless the physical medium (cable) is damaged or broken. With 
wireless communications there is no bounded medium, because the air is used to carry the 
data using RF.
No Wireless Connectivity
Several components of a network can cause WLAN connectivity issues. Keep in mind that 
WLANs are not bound by a physical medium such as Ethernet cable; therefore, issues other 
than wiring may result in either no connectivity or intermittent connection problems.
Let’s review some of the OSI model information discussed in Chapter 1, “Computer 
Networking Fundamentals.” The Physical layer provides the medium for connectivity (the 
air) in a wireless network and is used to carry RF information that contains the computer 
data. This layer also includes components such as network adapter cards, which provide an 
interface to the wireless computer or other wireless device. Layer 1 connectivity provides 
the capability to transfer information that is sent between devices. Figure 11.3 illustrates the 
Physical layer and wireless connectivity.

No Wireless Connectivity on the Client Side
IEEE 802.11 wireless networks require Physical layer connectivity in order to provide suc-
cessful communications. Several potential connectivity issues are associated with client-side 
wireless devices. In many cases, no connectivity on the client side is an isolated issue that 
will not affect a large number of devices or users. Problems that can cause client-side lack 
of connectivity include the following:
■
■
Disabled radio or wireless network adapter
■
■
Device driver fails to initialize correctly
■
■
Misconfigured wireless client utility
■
■
Microsoft Windows WLAN AutoConfig service not running or not configured ­correctly
■
■
Protective supplicants (wireless client device side) that can disable the radio in response 
to specific policy violations
A disabled radio or client adapter in a wireless client device can cause a lack of connec-
tivity. Many devices, such as notebook computers, have physical switches or a combination 
of keys that can disable a radio. In many cases, a user does not even realize they turned off 
the physical switch for the WLAN radio. A disabled radio cannot provide RF communi-
cation between the client device and the wireless infrastructure, such as an access point. 
Figure 11.4 shows the icon for a disabled wireless adapter and the window explaining that 
the Microsoft WLAN AutoConfig service is not started on a notebook computer with 
Microsoft Windows. Keep in mind that the wireless functionality of certain devices such 
as laptop computers may have the capability to be enabled and disabled in the Basic Input/
Output System (BIOS) or system setup of the device—something that is often overlooked.
With Microsoft Windows operating systems, there are built-in diagnostics and trouble-
shooting that may help with some WLAN connectivity issues. Figure 11.5 shows the wire-
less connection dialog box as “Not connected.” If you click the Diagnose link, Windows 
will go through a series of steps to try to resolve the issue. In this case, the Windows wire-
less service was not running, and Microsoft was able to determine this and identified the

problem. Another frequently occurring problem for wireless client devices regarding the 
device driver is failure of the driver to initialize properly. Disabling and re-enabling the 
adapter usually solves this type of problem without having to reboot the device.

Chapter 11 ■ Troubleshooting for Wireless Networking
 If a client utility is misconfi gured—for example, an incorrect service set identifi er (SSID) 
is specifi ed—it would cause a lack of connectivity for the wireless client device. Client 
utilities have the capability to specify the SSID as a parameter. If the client does not see 
an access point with the specifi ed SSID, it will not be able to connect to the IEEE 802.11 
WLAN. This feature in a client device is often set by a selection to connect to a preferred 
SSID only by using a specifi c profi le. 
 
 Remember that the network name SSID is case-sensitive and has a maxi-
mum length of 32 characters or 32 octets as defined in the IEEE 802.11 
standard. Incorrect use of case in the SSID can lead to a lack of connectiv-
ity, because the SSID will not match. Uppercase and lowercase letters are 
different ASCII characters. This can also lead to unnecessary help desk 
calls. Client devices will not connect to the WLAN if they have an incorrect 
SSID specified in the wireless client utility profile. This could be uninten-
tional (accidental) or in some cases intentional, such as for the purpose of 
getting around a firewall or other SSID restriction. 
 The Microsoft Windows built-in wireless client utility is a very popular client util-
ity for connecting to IEEE 802.11 wireless networks. The Microsoft Windows WLAN 
AutoConfi g service runs as a service or background process in the Microsoft Windows 
operating systems. If this service is not running or if the client device is not confi gured 
correctly to use Windows wireless services, the wireless client device will not be able to 
connect to the wireless network unless a third-party client utility from the adapter manu-
facturer is used. Figure  11.6 illustrates some of these potential issues from a wireless client 
device that may cause a lack of connectivity to the wireless network infrastructure.

Other Wireless Connectivity Issues
Connectivity issues can also arise if a misconfigured client utility has incorrect WLAN 
security settings or client IP address issues. Both will prevent a wireless client device from 
successfully completing the connection process and will prevent the transfer of computer 
data. Even though the Physical layer (Layer 1) and Data Link layer (Layer 2) connection 
may have been successful, the Layer 3 process would not be complete, and therefore data 
would not be transferred.
Before we discuss incorrect security settings further, it is important to have a better 
understanding of how an IP address (a logical address for a network interface) may have an 
impact on a successful connection and some of the issues associated with TCP/IP.
IP Address Connectivity Issues
Although wireless networks operate at Layer 1 and Layer 2 of the OSI model, Layer 3 
and IP addressing also play a role because TCP/IP is used in most of today’s computer  
networks. (Feel free to refer to the discussion of the seven layers of the OSI model in 
Chapter 1.) Early computer networks used various proprietary protocols to communicate 
with one another, such as Novell’s IPX/SPX or Microsoft’s NetBEUI. (A protocol is a set of 
rules that defines data communication between devices.) Since the growth of local area net-
works (LANs), expanding to WANs and the World Wide Web (WWW) service becoming 
available in the mid-1990s, TCP/IP has become the standard protocol used in virtually all 
computer networks. Remember that Layer 3 and Layer 4 of the OSI model are responsible 
for addressing and routing both information and the session connection using the TCP/IP 
protocol. Figure 11.7 illustrates the two layers responsible for the TCP/IP protocol and the 
function of each.

Chapter 11  ■  Troubleshooting for Wireless Networking  
Misconfigured IP address information can cause connectivity issues in an IEEE 802.11 
WLAN. Most wireless networks, both SOHO and enterprise, have the capability to use 
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). DHCP is a service that issues IP addresses 
and other TCP/IP parameters to connected computer network client devices. This service 
eliminates the need to manually assign logical Layer 3 IP addresses to all devices on the 
network. In IEEE 802.11 wireless networking, this DHCP service is provided directly from 
an access point, a wireless router, and a WLAN controller or from a server running DHCP 
services on the wired LAN. Many client device issues related to Layer 3 or above can cause 
the failure to obtain a valid IP address. This problem is often blamed on the wireless net-
work, even though a successful IEEE 802.11 authentication and association have occurred. 
Figure 11.8 shows an example of DHCP services using a wireless residential gateway/router.

To ISP
A cable or digital subscriber line (DSL) modem device connected to the ISP service will 
receive a DHCP address from the ISP. This modem will then issue IP addresses to wireless 
client devices or intermediary devices such as the IEEE 802.11 wireless router. If DHCP 
services are not running or are not operating correctly on the wireless router, the connected 
wireless client devices will not be able to obtain a valid IP address and will not be able to 
communicate above Layer 2.
The computer operating system in use will determine what action the client device 
takes if an IP address cannot be obtained from a DHCP server. Windows uses a service 
that became available starting way back with Windows 98 and is now available in all ver-
sions of Windows, called Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA). APIPA is designed to 

Wireless LAN Connectivity—Coverage and Capacity Problems 
471  
provide an IP address automatically to any computer network device requesting one that 
is connected to a common LAN. APIPA does not require the use of a DHCP server. It also 
eliminates the need for users to manually set up IP addressing on all the devices. An APIPA 
address will be in the 169.254.X.X (169.254.0.1 through 169.254.255.254) range, with a 
default class B subnet mask of 255.255.0.0. For example, a device such as a notebook com-
puter may have an APIPA such as 169.254.100.20. If DHCP services are running on the  
LAN and a device cannot obtain an address from the server or if DHCP services are not 
available, an APIPA will be issued. Figure 11.9 shows the ipconfig command displaying an 
IP address from Microsoft’s APIPA.
F i g u r e  11. 9    Microsoft Windows APIPA address displayed using the ipconfig 
command
If a wireless access point or wireless router is connected to an IP subnet other than the 
one that uses automatic addresses, the wireless client device will require a valid IP address 
from the DHCP service in order to complete a network connection. If a valid IP address 
cannot be obtained from the DHCP service, the client will not have a valid TCP/IP connec-
tion to the access point or wireless router and instead will obtain an IP address from the 
169.254.X.X range. This was much easier to identify in the earlier versions of the Microsoft 
Windows operating system. If this is the case, the wireless connection icon will show a 
“Limited or no connectivity” message and exclamation point, as shown in Figure 11.10.

Chapter 11 ■ Troubleshooting for Wireless Networking
 With the newer Microsoft Windows operating systems (basically from Windows 7 onward), 
you need to look a little further to make the determination, as shown in Figure  11.11 .

 It is always a good idea to simply restart the wireless client network 
adapter, which will often correct some wireless client device connectivity 
issues. 
 Wireless Security Settings 
 Incorrect security settings can also cause connectivity issues. Although you may get a 
Layer 2 wireless connection to the access point even with incorrect security settings on 
a wireless client device, you will not get a valid Layer 3 TCP/IP address from the DHCP 
server. For example, assume an access point is using WPA 2.0 personal mode, which uses 
a 256-bit preshared key for security. If a wireless client device has the wrong passphrase or 
preshared key entered, it will not complete the additional authentication that occurs after 
the IEEE 802.11 authentication and association process and will not have a valid Layer 3 
TCP/IP address. In the Microsoft Windows 7 operating system, the network adapter would 
show “Attempting to authenticate” in the network adapter status. The error message in 
Microsoft Windows 10 reads, “The network security key isn’t correct. Please try again.”

Intermittent Wireless Connectivity Problems
Intermittent problems of any type are often the most difficult to diagnose and repair. You 
may have had the experience of an intermittent problem with your car. For example, at a 
stoplight the car may start to idle roughly and stall. There is not really any rhyme or reason 
as to when this happens—it could be in the morning; it could be in the afternoon. You take 
your car to the mechanic for repair and, of course, the problem does not occur. Therefore, 
the mechanic may have to keep your car for a period of time to try to duplicate the problem.
Intermittent problems with computers and networking are no different; they are difficult 
to diagnose if they can’t be reliably reproduced. In many cases using a protocol analyzer  
to capture frames is invaluable. Frame traces allow you to see what is happening between 
the wireless transmitter and the receiver. You learned about protocol analyzers for IEEE 
802.11 wireless networks and their use in Chapter 9, “Design for Wireless Networking.”
Most intermittent connectivity issues in IEEE 802.11 WLANs are associated with the 
amount of received signal strength. If nothing else has changed (for example, a security set-
ting or any type of device upgrade) and the wireless client device was working before, there 
is a good possibility the problem is associated with the amount of received signal.
Understanding the Received Signal Strength
One of the main concerns associated with IEEE 802.11 wireless networking is how much 
of the transmitted signal is identified as usable signal by the wireless client device. This is 
known as the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) value. RSSI is an arbitrary number 
assigned by the device manufacturer. There is no standard for this value, and it will not 

474 
Chapter 11  ■  Troubleshooting for Wireless Networking  
be comparable between devices from different manufacturers. The calculation of the RSSI 
value is done in a proprietary manner, and a wireless device from one manufacturer may 
indicate a different received signal strength from that indicated by another, even though 
they both are receiving the exact same signal and at the same actual signal strength. This 
value is a key determinant of how well the WLAN device will perform. How the device is 
used with the network will determine the required levels of signal for optimal connectivity. 
Two WLAN client devices that are equal distance from the access point may display differ-
ent RSSI values. Some client software utilities display this information in signal level bars 
to represent the amount of signal received—the more bars, the better the signal—others 
may show the value in dBm (decibel-milliwatts). Wireless network engineers and support 
personnel should be able to know what the bars or numbers reveal and what they do not.
The actual recommended signal strength will vary based on the manufacturer, but some 
general numbers do exist. In order to get the maximum data rate, and depending on the 
application (either voice or data), most best practices recommend a range of –65 dBm to 
–67 dBm of received signal strength. With newer technologies such as IEEE 802.11ac, this 
value may be even more aggressive in order to demodulate a signal modulated at 256QAM. 
Keep in mind, the closer the number is to zero, the better the received signal, and –65 dBm 
is closer to zero than –67 dBm. Figure 11.13 shows an example of an access point with 
an output power of 50 mW (–60 dBm) and the wireless client receiving a fraction of that 
amount, or 0.000001 mW (–60 dBm). Although the wireless client device is receiving only 
a fraction of the transmitted power output, it is still able to move data at the highest data 
rate. Amazing!

 Testing the Received Signal Strength 
 So what does this mean? It means the lower the amount of RF signal that is received by the 
receiver, the lower the data rate will be. Several tools are available that will allow a techni-
cal support specialist to see the received signal strength. These tools include: 
 
■
 Acrylic WiFi (Microsoft Windows), free for non-commercial use 
 
■
 AirGrab WiFi Radar (Mac OS X), free 
 
■
 MetaGeek InSSIDer 
 
■
 Wireless network adapter client utilities 
 
■
 Spectrum analyzer utility 
 
■
 Xirrus Wi-Fi Inspector (Microsoft Windows), free 
 Any of these tools can be used to check the received signal strength by a wireless client 
device or at an end user’s location to determine how much signal is being received, which 
will relate to the rate they should be transferring computer data. 
 Figure  11.14 shows the Microsoft Windows wireless client utility with bars representing 
the amount of received signal strength and the current data transfer rate.

Chapter 11  ■  Troubleshooting for Wireless Networking  
Weak, Low, or No Radio Frequency Signal
Weak, low, or no RF signal is typically an indication that the WLAN client device is too 
far away from a wireless access point or is experiencing some level of RF interference. 
This could also be the result of some obstruction either blocking or severely attenuating 
the RF signal. This is most often the result of a poor or nonexistent WLAN site survey or 
significant environmental changes. (You learned about performing a WLAN site survey in 
Chapter 9.) In order for a client device to operate correctly, the signal needs to be strong 
enough to connect to an access point and maintain the connection. A wireless client device 
will have a difficult time distinguishing between the RF received signal and the RF noise if 
the signal level is too close to the noise floor.
To review, the signal-to-noise ratio is the difference between the amount of received signal 
and the noise floor level in the area where the wireless client device is located. (Chapter 9 
discussed the noise floor and signal-to-noise ratio in more detail.) Figure 11.15 shows a 
Microsoft Windows wireless client utility and several wireless access points in the vicinity. 
Notice that the client device shows different received signal levels for the access points, as 
indicated by each one’s number of bars. The Guest and CWTS SSIDs show a high received 
signal, but Data and Voice show only two bars, which represents lower received signal 
strength.

Other wireless client utilities may show a more elaborate view of the signal strength 
and the noise level in an area. These are represented by dBm values rather than bar levels. 
In addition to client utilities, third-party utilities, such as MetaGeek InSSIDer, will show 
received signal strength or noise levels, or possibly both.

Wireless LAN Throughput
Papa User says, “Someone’s been taking my throughput!” Mama User says, “Someone’s 
been taking my throughput!” Baby User says, “Someone’s been taking my throughput and 
that someone still is!” Sound familiar? Receiving and maintaining enough throughput can 
be a tough chore in today’s world of IEEE 802.11 wireless networking. Users just can’t 
seem to have enough.
It is important to understand the difference between data rate and throughput. 
Throughput is the rate at which data is being transferred. It seems there is never enough to 
go around. When it comes to throughput, expectations are a key factor. It is important for 
users to realize that the actual throughput will always be lower than the advertised data 
rate. For example, in an IEEE 802.11n MIMO network, the maximum data signaling rate 
is up to 600 Mbps, but the actual throughput will be between 30 and 300 Mbps, much less 
than half of the advertised data rate. IEEE 802.11ac has a theoretical maximum signaling 
rate of 6933.3 Mbps aggregate. Keep in mind that these numbers will vary based on many 
factors, including the environment and the IEEE 802.11n/ac technology features that are 
enabled such as channel width, the number of spatial streams, and whether the optional 
short guard interval of 400ns is enabled.
Maximizing throughput is part of overall network design. A well-designed WLAN and 
site survey will yield excellent results. However, several factors may affect the throughput 
the users are receiving, including the following:
■
■
The wireless client device distance from an access point
■
■
The RF transmit output power of an access point
■
■
The number of wireless devices associated to the access point
The Wireless Client Device Distance from an Access Point
As the wireless client’s distance from an access point increases, the RF received signal 
strength decreases, thereby providing less average overall throughput. The type of wire-
less client device in use—computer, VoIP handset, handheld device, tablet, or barcode 
scanner—will determine the acceptable levels of data throughput. Most wireless client 
utilities will show that the expected data rate is based on the received signal strength. It is 
important to remember that the expected data rate is not actual throughput. Figure 11.16 
illustrates this point by showing two different throughput sessions, both connected to 
the same access point. Session 1 is in close proximity, approximately 15–20 feet from the 
access point. Session 2 shows the throughput at a greater distance, approximately  
45 feet from the access point. Since there are many variables that will have an effect on 
IEEE 802.11n/ac (including channel widths, number of spatial streams, and optional 
short guard interval), this testing was performed using IEEE 802.11g devices to help 
­illustrate the concept.

The Radio Frequency Transmit Output Power of an Access Point
The amount of RF transmit output power being sent from the wireless access point will 
also determine RF signal strength for the connected wireless client devices. This is because 
the higher the RF power, the farther an RF signal will travel or propagate. If a wireless 

Wireless LAN Connectivity—Coverage and Capacity Problems 
479  
client device is receiving a low RF signal and adding an additional access point is not an 
option, increasing the output power of the access point may do the trick. Keep in mind, 
however, that this needs to be evaluated closely as more RF transmit power is not always 
the best option.
If a physical wireless RF site survey is performed, we recommend that you have the 
access points set to less than the full available transmit output power. What the transmit 
output power level is set to during a site survey will depend on the engineer who performs 
the survey or the manufacturer recommendations. If an access point is not set to full power, 
it will be possible to make adjustments to compensate and potentially correct problems 
such as a wireless client device experiencing low throughput because of a low received  
signal strength value.
Access Point Loading
Because WLANs use the air as a shared medium, the more wireless client devices that 
associate to the wireless access point, the less throughput each device will be able to 
receive. The type of hardware can also affect the throughput based on the number of 
associated users. For example, if 25 devices are associated to an access point using wire-
less barcode scanners that typically transfer small amounts of information, they may 
have better performance than 5 devices using bandwidth-intensive applications such as 
digital imaging or engineering programs such as CAD/CAM on notebook computers. 
Load balancing of devices between access points can help limit the number of associated 
wireless client devices. Co-channel interference can cause the same issue, because wireless 
devices on the same or a close channel, associated or not, are part of the same contention 
domain.
Solutions to Low Wireless LAN Throughput
There are several possible solutions to low throughput problems clients may be experienc-
ing. The appropriate solution will depend on the specific situation. If an RF site survey was 
performed correctly and thoroughly, additional access points should not be needed unless 
there have been environmental or capacity changes in the area since the original survey was 
performed. Solutions to low-throughput problems include the following:
■
■
Adding more access points
■
■
Increasing output power of access points (depending on the situation)
■
■
Increasing antenna gain
■
■
Enabling load-balancing solutions on access points
One or more of these solutions may help increase the throughput for users connected to 
a wireless network. Figure 11.17 shows a before-and-after scenario based on output power 
of an access point.
Of the solutions just discussed, no particular one is better than the others. Which solu-
tion you choose will depend on several factors, including the number of wireless client 
devices, the number of access points, budget constraints, and potential interference issues.

Chapter 11 ■ Troubleshooting for Wireless Networking

 Increasing the output power of an access point will also increase the cell 
size and potentially allow for more wireless client devices to associate. 
This will, in turn, increase the load or number of associated devices on 
the access point and may contribute to interference in other areas. It may 
also lead to an increase in the hidden node problem (discussed later in this 
chapter) and cause the overall capacity of a cell to decrease. More power 
is not always the best choice. If the budget allows, adding more access 
points as needed to reduce collision domain size (RF cell) is usually a better 
solution, with the proper design considerations. 
 Application Performance Problems 
 As you now know, IEEE 802.11 wireless networks are a major part of every computer 
network in all industries and homes. Many different types of applications, both software 
and hardware, want to take advantage of the wireless network capabilities. Therefore, it is 
important to understand the various types of applications your IEEE 802.11 WLAN may 
use and how to prevent problems that can arise from the use of these applications. Some of 
the common applications that are used via WLANs include the following:

This is not a complete list, but for the most part every resource or application that is 
used in the wired network is also a candidate for the wireless network. Many of the prob-
lems that are experienced with a wired network will be even more common on a wireless 
network. We have all the same potential problems as we do in a wired network, but more 
because it is wireless. Remember that IEEE 802.11 WLANs use an unbounded shared 
medium (the air) and are contention based, which will create both interference and capacity 
problems. Using the appropriate tools, such as a wireless packet analyzer and RF spectrum 
analyzer, will help to identify and resolve these problems. The following sections describe 
how to identify and resolve these problems.
Wireless Device Software and Hardware Upgrades
Software and hardware upgrades play a role in the maintenance and support of any WLAN 
deployment. Many problems arise from outdated or corrupt device drivers. Having the 
latest device drivers or software client utilities will help improve performance and solve 
problems associated with software-related issues. Firmware also needs to be updated peri-
odically to ensure new features are applied to the devices, such as access points or WLAN 
controllers.
Client Device Software Upgrades
Upgrading the software related to WLAN technology has many benefits that may help 
resolve performance or operation issues. Technical support or network engineers should 
find time to stay up-to-date with the latest software versions available for the hardware in 
their network. This can be done by looking at the manufacturer’s website or subscribing to 
a service that will announce changes and updates. Software upgrades for wireless networks 
commonly fall under the following areas:
■
■
Device drivers
■
■
Client device adapter utilities
■
■
Device firmware and BIOS updates
Software upgrades on any of these components will help enhance the performance of the 
client devices. These upgrades can come as a fix for a problem with the software or poten-
tially provide new features for a client device. In Chapter 3, “Infrastructure and Client 
Devices Used with Wireless Networking,” you learned about some of the software compo-
nents required in order for a client device to connect to an IEEE 802.11 wireless network. 
The following sections focus on the process of upgrading the software associated with these 
devices.

Device Drivers
Device drivers are the software components that allow a hardware device to function with 
a computer operating system. This is accomplished by the software providing an instruc-
tion set for all devices that connect to a computer, tablet, handheld, or any other device 
that runs with an operating system. The following list is a sampling of the devices that will 
require a software device driver:
■
■
Hard drive
■
■
Video card
■
■
Keyboard
■
■
Mouse
■
■
USB ports

■
Network adapters
With wireless networking, the device driver that is of most concern is the one used for 
the wireless network adapter. This adapter is what allows a computer or other client device 
to connect to a wireless network in either infrastructure or ad hoc mode. Figure 11.18 
shows an example of viewing the device driver properties for a wireless network adapter in 
the Microsoft Windows operating system.

ing system startup problems. With today’s sophisticated computer operating systems and

features, such as plug-and-play, having to worry about the physical settings of a device 
is less common than it was a few years ago. Upgrading or replacing a device driver in 
Windows operating systems is a fairly straightforward process. Exercise 11.1 steps you 
through upgrading a device driver for your wireless network adapter.
E x e r c i s e  11 .1
Upgrading a Device Driver 
In this exercise, we will look at the process of upgrading a device driver for a wireless net-
work adapter. This process is based on using the Broadcom 802.11g Network Adapter.
Downloading a Driver Package from a Website
1.	
With the help of a web browser, connect to the appropriate website to search for the 
latest version of the device driver—in this case, www.broadcom.com.
2.	
In most cases, you will look for either a Support or Downloads link to find the loca-
tion for software such as drivers. The current link on this site is Support. Click the 
appropriate link.
3.	
You may need to create an account that will allow you to log in and search for the 
correct software. You then should be able to search by model number for the driver 
you need. Download the correct device driver. This may come in the form of an indi-
vidual file or possibly an entire software client utility program.
4.	
In this case, an update for this wireless adapter is not available from the adapter 
manufacturer, and because the adapter is integrated into a notebook computer, it will 
be necessary to visit the website for the computer in which this adapter is installed. 
This is a very common way to get driver updates. It is important to note that for client 
devices with integrated adapters it is best to visit the website of the manufacturer for 
the device—in this case, www.lenovo.com.
5.	
This website has links for support and downloads. Click the Support link  
(http://support.lenovo.com/en_US/) and search by product name, serial  
number, or machine type.
6.	
Browse for the correct driver based on the installed adapter.
7.	
In this case, you will have to download an entire package (approximately 78 MB). Run 
the downloaded program to install the latest device driver file.
Manually Upgrading a Driver
These next steps show how you would manually upgrade a device driver using an indi-
vidual file. Keep in mind that the steps will vary based on the operating system and ver-
sion in use. This example is for the Microsoft Windows 7 operating system.
1.	
Click Start and the Control Panel icon. Double-click the System icon, and the System 
Properties dialog box appears.

Select the Hardware tab and then click the Device Manager button. The Device Man-
ager dialog box appears.
3.	
Expand the Network Adapters item and double-click the correct network adapter. 
The Network Adapter Properties dialog box appears.
4.	
Select the Driver tab and then click the Update Driver button. The Hardware Update 
­Wizard launches. Select the Install From A List Or Specific Location (Advanced) radio  
button. A new screen (called Please Choose Your Search And Installation Options) appears.

Click the Don’t Search, I Will Choose The Driver To Install radio button, and then  
click Next.
6.	
Click the Have Disk button and browse to the folder where the driver is located. 
Select the driver and then click Open. At the Install From Disk screen, click OK. The 
Select Network Adapter screen appears.
7.	
Click Next to continue. The update will process. Click Finish to complete the device 
driver upgrade.
Automatically Upgrading a Driver
Some manufacturers are making it easy to upgrade a device driver for your wireless net-
work adapters. They do this by creating an executable program that does everything for 
you automatically. All you need to do is download a file from the manufacturer’s website 
and execute the program. Everything from that point is automatic.
Client Device Adapter Utilities
Client adapter utilities may need to be upgraded occasionally. By upgrading the client 
adapter utility, you will usually add new features or settings to enhance the performance 
and function of the utility.
The Microsoft Windows wireless client utility is usually upgraded either from a service 
pack or a hotfix available from the Microsoft website.
Device Firmware
Device firmware is the instruction set that allows hardware to operate based on its 
design. Firmware is simply software that remains in memory when the power is removed. 
Firmware tends to be hardware oriented, but not all firmware involves the control of hard-
ware. Many Layer 7 user interfaces and agents are implemented as firmware burned into 
read-only memory devices (ROMs).

486 
Chapter 11 ■ Troubleshooting for Wireless Networking
 Conversely, there are many examples of software directly controlling hardware. Most 
drivers for hardware devices are software (loaded into volatile memory only when power is 
present) and not fi rmware (always resident in static memory regardless of power). Firmware 
upgrades are common support tasks that need to be done periodically, either to fi x issues 
with the way the hardware is operating or to provide new features for the hardware. For 
example, updating the BIOS of a laptop computer might also solve specifi c problems such 
as wireless connectivity. In many cases, the BIOS contains information about the WLAN 
adapter that is installed or embedded within the wireless device. 
 All infrastructure devices, either SOHO-grade or enterprise-grade, allow you to upgrade 
the fi rmware. In enterprise environments, fi rmware upgrades can be performed either man-
ually or automatically with the aid of a WLAN management system software or appliance. 
 
 Many manufacturers of enterprise-grade equipment require you to pur-
chase a support contact or service agreement in order to download firm-
ware for wireless infrastructure devices.   
 Most infrastructure devices have several options for performing upgrades. These 
upgrade options include

Upgrading Firmware Warning
It is imperative to follow the manufacturer’s instructions when performing a firmware 
upgrade. Failure to do so may result in the device becoming unusable or needing to be 
returned to the manufacturer for repair. Several items are very important when you are 
performing a firmware upgrade on any device:
■
■
Always verify that you have the correct firmware file for the device to be upgraded 
prior to performing the upgrade.
■
■
Always read the release notes that come with the firmware.
■
■
Never upgrade firmware on a device that is running on battery power.
■
■
Never power down the device while the firmware upgrade is in process.
The firmware in enterprise-grade access points and wireless controllers can usually be 
upgraded using the command-line interface instead of the GUI, if desired.
Wireless Infrastructure and Client Device Hardware Upgrades
There may be various reasons to upgrade hardware for both infrastructure and client-
side devices. Hardware upgrades are a part of the ongoing maintenance process with all 
­networking devices, including WLANs.
Wireless Infrastructure Devices
Upgrading wireless infrastructure devices can be an expensive and time-consuming task. 
Justifying these infrastructure device upgrades may require preparing reports that include 
performance of the WLAN infrastructure and client devices, as well as documentation that 
shows how an upgrade will enhance the end-user performance and make users more pro-
ductive in their job functions.
Upgrading wireless infrastructure devices such as access points can enable an organiza-
tion to enhance the performance of the wireless network by increasing the speed or reliabil-
ity of the WLAN. The hardware currently in use helps determine the extent of an upgrade. 
Some upgrades may only require the installation of a new or additional radio. Some access 
points are modular and provide this capability. One example of a wireless infrastructure 
upgrade is moving from IEEE 802.11b/g to IEEE 802.11n/ac and MIMO technology.
Antennas
Unless the physical characteristics of the area where the WLAN is deployed have changed 
since the site survey, chances are that antennas will not need to be upgraded. If charac-
teristics such as additional walls or types of furnishings or other physical attributes have 
changed, antennas with different propagation patterns or higher gain may be required. 
Another situation where antennas may need to be upgraded or changed is if the initial site 

488 
Chapter 11  ■  Troubleshooting for Wireless Networking  
survey was not performed thoroughly or correctly. In some cases where external antennas 
are used on an access point, they may have been struck and accidentally moved, changing 
the polarity. A physical inspection of the deployed infrastructure devices should be part of 
routine WLAN administration or support to locate and correct such issues.
Wireless Client Device Upgrades
Client device upgrades can be automatic if the technology refresh for devices has taken 
place. For example, if a company replaces 50 notebook computers with newer models, the 
new notebooks will probably have WLAN adapters that are capable of IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n/
ac. The capabilities of these new notebooks may be more advanced than the wireless infra-
structure that is currently deployed.
Another situation where wireless client devices may need upgrading is one in which the 
infrastructure changes to different hardware or technology. If a company upgrades access 
points from IEEE 802.11b/g to IEEE 802.11n/ac and the clients only support 802.11b/g, 
the client devices may need to be upgraded in order to take full advantage of the new IEEE 
802.11n/ac wireless infrastructure.
Optimizing Wireless Networks
Making changes to an IEEE 802.11 WLAN installation may be required in order to pro-
vide optimal performance for the devices that will be connecting. In some cases, a WLAN 
site design is considered an ongoing process due to the dynamics of RF and changes in 
technology. This being the case, an existing WLAN deployment may have to be resurveyed 
and the design modified to provide optimal performance for the users. Here are some of the 
factors that you need to consider when optimizing a WLAN:
■
■
Wireless infrastructure hardware selection and placement
■
■
RF interference sources
■
■
Client device load balancing
■
■
Access point capacity and utilization
■
■
Minimizing multipath
■
■
Understanding hidden node problems
Wireless Infrastructure Hardware Selection and Placement
Wireless infrastructure hardware selection and placement are typically part of the WLAN 
site survey and design process. Occasionally, however, you may need to reevaluate after 
the WLAN has been installed. Although the objective of a site survey is to assist in the 
design of the network, find locations and sources of interference, and decide on locations 

Optimizing Wireless Networks 
489
for infrastructure devices, you may have to make some adjustments to allow for optimal 
performance. These adjustments may include minor relocation of access points as well as 
RF adjustments, including channel and output power settings. These adjustments would 
ensure that clients have maximum signal strength, throughput, and roaming capabilities. 
Applications—both hardware and software—and user requirements could also change, 
requiring an optimization or resurvey of the wireless network. 
 Identifying, Locating, and Removing Sources of Wi-Fi 
and Non-Wi-Fi Interference 
 Identifying areas of RF coverage and Wi-Fi and non-Wi-Fi interference usually is part of 
the WLAN site survey process. The best way to identify sources of interference is with an 
RF spectrum analyzer. This could be in the form of an instrumentation device or a USB–
based spectrum analyzer designed specifi cally for wireless networking. 
 During this wireless site survey process, interference sources should be identifi ed. 
However, changes to the environment where the network is installed may introduce new 
sources of RF interference. Also, keep in mind that a walkthrough spectrum analysis of an 
area will record only the RF it sees at that instant in time. If a new piece of equipment is 
introduced into an area, it may cause interference with the wireless network that would not 
have been present during the RF site survey spectrum analysis process. Businesses or orga-
nizations that use WLANs where this could be a factor include 
 
■
 Healthcare deployments 
 
■
 Warehouse/retail deployments 
 
■
 Manufacturing deployments 
 
■
 Industrial deployments 
 Therefore, an ongoing spectrum analysis may be required to identify and if possible 
remove the sources of interference. If these new sources of interference are there to stay, it 
will be necessary to make appropriate adjustments for the network to operate as designed. 
The number-one source of interference in a wireless network is other wireless devices. 
 
 Enterprise-grade access points contain spectrum analysis capabilities 
integrated with the access point. This allows an administrator or network 
engineer to connect to the access point and view the RF in the area without 
having to visit the location. 
 Figure  11.20 shows an example of a USB-enabled spectrum analyzer that can be used to 
perform a spectrum analysis to help locate new sources of RF interference after a WLAN 
has been deployed.

Wireless Client Device Load Balancing and Infrastructure 
Device Redundancy
Client load balancing is a mechanism that prevents wireless client devices from associat-
ing to an access point that has already reached the maximum number of client devices 
for optimal performance. There are a variety of ways this can be accomplished, typically 
proprietary to the manufacturer. Parameters for load balancing can be set on the access 
points, WLAN management software, cloud-managed solutions, or hardware WLAN 
controllers. Load balancing will allow optimal use of all access points in a specific area 
by preventing too many devices from connecting to a single access point and overloading 
the access point, which in turn would cause poor performance for all associated devices. 
Band steering is now implemented by many wireless equipment manufacturers. Band steer-
ing will encourage wireless client devices that are 5 GHz capable to use the 5 GHz band 
rather than the 2.4 GHz band. Figure 11.21 illustrates the load-balancing process for 
WLAN access points.
The ways in which load balancing is implemented depend on the manufacturer of the 
WLAN equipment. One solution is a settable parameter in an access point specifying a 
maximum number of devices allowed to connect at any one time. Once the access point 
has reached its capacity, a client device wanting to associate will be presented with an error 
message and will not be allowed to complete the process. Some manufacturers will direct 
the wireless client device to an access point that will be able to accept the connection rather 
than deny the connection.

Wireless Infrastructure Device Redundancy
Designing for WLAN redundancy is an important factor in most enterprise WLAN deploy-
ments. In both WLAN controller-based implementations and wireless access points imple-
mentations, it is critical to eliminate any potential single point of failure in the WLAN.
Wireless LAN Controller Redundancy    If you were to have only a single WLAN 
­controller and that controller failed, the entire wireless network would be down for  
any controller-based access point. Therefore, a redundant controller should be considered 
to eliminate the single point of failure. Some manufacturers offer zero license controllers 
at a decent price that would only be used in the event of a wireless infrastructure control-
ler failure. For example, if you have 24 controller-based access points, that would require 
24 access point licenses. You would have two controllers of 24 ports each for a total of  
48 ports. However, this would only allow for 24 licensed access points to be used at any 
one time. The second, which is sometimes referred to as a zero license controller, would be 
for failover purposes only.

492 
Chapter 11 ■ Troubleshooting for Wireless Networking
Autonomous or Cloud Access Point Redundancy  Autonomous and cloud-managed access 
points do not require a WLAN controller to operate. An autonomous access point operates 
as a standalone device, requiring each device to be managed individually or with the help 
of WLAN management software solutions. Cloud access points are cloud based and do not 
require the use of a WLAN controller, as they have their own management software that 
does not rely on a dedicated controller. If one of these access points were to fail, only those 
wireless client devices that were part of that basic service area might lose a connection to 
the network. 
 Depending on the design of the WLAN, the surrounding autonomous or cloud-managed 
access points may be able to increase their RF power to compensate for the failed access 
point, allowing the wireless client devices that were connected to it to still maintain a con-
nection to the network. This should only be a temporary solution, and the failed access 
point should be replaced immediately. In a single-access-point installation, if the access 
point did fail, that would be a single point of failure. For both enterprise and SOHO 
deployments, we recommend a spare access point be kept on hand in the event of a failure. 
Another possible solution for this situation using cloud-managed access points is to auto-
matically mesh with another access point, which will continue to allow a connection to the 
Internet for device access and management capabilities. 
 Analyzing Wireless Infrastructure Capacity 
and Utilization 
 It is important to have a baseline for the performance of your WLAN. This baseline will 
show the average utilization and capacity of the connected infrastructure devices at vari-
ous times during the company’s business hours. Continuous monitoring of the wireless 
network is similar to that of a wired network. Performance metrics will be needed to gauge 
the use of the WLAN and infrastructure devices and show how well the system performs. 
These metrics will also show areas that are lacking in performance, including bottlenecks 
or overutilized access points. Using these performance metrics will show which infrastruc-
ture devices need attention. This may include moving or adding access points for additional 
capacity or to allow for higher utilization. Changes to the environment, such as the addi-
tion of users, may justify the need for additional access points. 
 
 Using IEEE 802.11e or WMM-compliant devices combined with the cor-
responding QoS settings can improve overall performance for real time 
applications that are subject to latency, such as wireless devices used for 
voice and real-time video. 
 Radio Frequency Performance Problems: Multipath 
 With IEEE 802.11a/b/g systems, poor throughput can be the result of corrupted data, 
which may be caused by multipath.  Multipath is various RF wavefronts of the same signal 
being received at slightly different times. Multipath is caused by RF refl ections based on the 

Optimizing Wireless Networks 
493  
physical attributes where an access point is placed. Antenna diversity will help minimize 
the problems for IEEE 802.11a/b/g systems caused by multipath.
It is important to understand that although multipath is a hindrance in most IEEE 
802.11a/b/g WLAN implementations, it is beneficial for IEEE 802.11n/ac systems. 
MIMO technology used with 802.11n/ac is designed to take advantage of multipath 
and increase throughput by using the effects of multipath as an advantage. Unlike IEEE 
802.11a/b/g SISO systems, IEEE 802.11n/ac MIMO access points use multiple radios 
with multiple antennas. The multiple radio chains and some additional intelligence are 
what give 802.11n/ac MIMO access points the capability to process reflected signals. 
Because IEEE 802.11n MIMO works with both the 2.4 GHz ISM and 5 GHz UNII 
bands, a dual-band IEEE 802.11n/ac MIMO access point may have up to eight radio 
chains—four for 2.4 GHz (802.11n) and four for 5 GHz (802.11n/ac)—and eight anten-
nas (one for each radio) for data rates of up to 600 Mbps for 802.11n and 6933.3 Mbps 
aggregate for 802.11ac.
If you are experiencing performance problems where multipath may be a potential 
issue, you will need to evaluate your environment to determine if this is contributing 
to the issues. Using the proper diversity technology for IEEE 802.11a/b/g systems and 
upgrading to IEEE 802.11n/ac systems are some of the options. If you are using diversity-
capable access points with integrated antennas, spacing between antennas will be correct. 
If you are using external antennas, keep in mind that the spacing between the antennas 
should be in multiples of the wavelength for the frequency that is used. Check with the 
manufacturer of the access points you are using to determine how diversity antennas 
should be installed.
Radio Frequency Performance Problems: Hidden Node
More IEEE 802.11 WLAN installations experience hidden node problems than you would 
probably imagine. Hidden node is the result of wireless client devices connected to an 
access point and not able to “hear” each other prior to starting a transmission. This will 
result in data collisions at the access point and the loss of data. As discussed in Chapter 7, 
“Modulation Technology for Wireless Networking,” the CSMA/CA process is designed to 
avoid collisions between devices sharing the same medium. This process includes the use of 
a mechanism called clear channel assessment (CCA), which detects RF energy from other 
IEEE 802.11 wireless client devices in the same RF space and understands that the medium 
is busy; therefore, that wireless client device will not attempt to complete the transmission 
process until it detects the medium is clear.
Three causes of the hidden node problem are as follows:
■
■
Hidden node obstacle (obstructions)
■
■
Hidden node distance (signal strength)
■
■
Hidden node technology (signaling methods)
There are both hardware solutions and software solutions to resolving hidden node 
problems. The following sections describe hidden node problems and solutions in more 
detail.

494 
Chapter 11  ■  Troubleshooting for Wireless Networking  
Hidden Node Obstruction
Hidden node obstruction is caused by two or more client devices connecting to an access 
point in which access point–to–client device RF communication is clear, but client device–
to–client device RF communication is blocked. Figure 11.22 illustrates an example of 
­hidden node obstruction.

Wireless Client
There are several physical solutions to the hidden node obstruction problem. Any of these 
solutions should allow for the correct RF communication between access points and wireless 
client devices. Some of the physical solutions to hidden node obstruction include the following:
Removing the Obstruction    Removing any obstructions that do not allow for clear RF 
communication between client devices will solve the hidden node problem. In most cases, 
however, removing obstructions is not feasible. If this type of hidden node problem does 
exist, a good reason could be poor network design or an inadequate WLAN site survey.
Adding Access Points    Adding more access points will help resolve issues caused by hid-
den node where obstacles are a factor. This will allow for clear RF communication between 
access points and clients as well as between client devices connected to the same access 
point. Keep in mind, however, that careful planning must be taken into consideration when 
adding access points. Too many access points or access points that are too close together 
can cause other problems, such as co-channel interference. This is where a software-
assisted (predictive modeling) WLAN site survey program comes in handy. You can use a 
program like this to perform a passive RF site survey by walking the area and gathering RF 
data. You saw various manufacturers of software-assisted WLAN site survey programs and 
learned about passive site surveys in Chapter 9.

Hidden Node Distance or Signal Strength
With hidden node distance or hidden node signal strength problems, client device–to–client 
device RF communication cannot occur because the client devices are too far apart and 
not in radio range of each other. Access point–to–client device RF communication does 
take place, however, because these devices are within radio range. Figure 11.23 shows an 
example of hidden node distance/signal strength.

Just as in hidden node obstruction problems, physical solutions exist for the hidden node 
distance problem. These physical solutions provide adequate RF communication for access 
point–to–wireless client device and for client device–to–client device. The following are 
examples of solutions for hidden node distance:
Increasing the Output Power of Client Devices    Increasing the RF output power of client 
devices allows them a larger radio range. This enables wireless client devices to hear each 
other and therefore know whether the medium is clear prior to starting a transmission.
Moving the Client Devices Closer Together    Moving the wireless client devices closer 
together allows the devices to hear the RF communication between each other. In this situ-
ation they are able to detect whether the RF medium is clear prior to starting a transmis-
sion to the access point. This is a better solution than increasing the transmit power.
Adding More Access Points    Another solution is to add more access points. This would 
allow wireless client devices to detect a clear RF medium. More access points mean a 
smaller basic service area for each access point on the network. This allows client devices to 
associate with an access point in close range, and they will not be required to contend for 
the same access point with other wireless devices at a distance. Adding more access points 
needs to be carefully considered.

496 
Chapter 11  ■  Troubleshooting for Wireless Networking  
Hidden Node Physical Layer Technology or Signaling Methods
Hidden node technology problems occur when access points experience excessive collisions 
because of different spread spectrum or Physical layer communication technologies that 
are sharing the same RF medium. This can happen when, for example, an access point has 
to share transmissions between 802.11b (HR/DSSS) and 802.11g/n (ERP-OFDM) client 
devices. Figure 11.24 illustrates the hidden node problem due to different Physical layer 
technologies in use.

In this example, the only physical solution to the hidden node technology problem is to 
allow either 802.11b or 802.11g/n devices to communicate with the access point, but not 
both. In most cases, this is not a realistic solution, because allowing only one of the tech-
nologies to communicate with an access point prevents devices using the other technology 
from using the network. In other words, giving only 802.11g/n (ERP-OFDM) devices the 
capability to use the network would prevent 802.11b (HR/DSSS) devices from using the 
network resources, or vice versa.
The IEEE 802.11n, amendment and now part of the IEEE 802.11-2016 standard, con-
sists of four protection modes. The same potential hidden node problems will exist with 
802.11n devices but even more so because 802.11n is capable of operating in both the  
2.4 GHz ISM and 5 GHz UNII bands. These modes are known as High Throughput (HT) 
protection modes and are a set of rules client devices and access points will use for  
backward compatibility. You learned in Chapter 6, “Communication for Wireless 
Networking,” that these modes are constantly changing based on the RF environment and 
associated wireless client devices.

The Software Solution to Hidden Node Problems
Although not commonly used, there is a software configuration solution for the hidden 
node problems just described. This software configuration solution is known as a process 
called request to send/clear to send, or RTS/CTS. The RTS/CTS process allows devices to 
reserve the medium for a specified period of time, enabling a device to complete a frame 
exchange and avoid collisions. RTS/CTS frames are also used with protection mechanisms 
to allow different IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n technologies to interoperate. You learned about pro-
tection mechanisms and mixed mode in Chapter 6. The RTS/CTS process was discussed 
briefly in Chapter 6 but is beyond the scope of the exam objectives and therefore is not 
­discussed in detail in this book.
Quality of Service Considerations
Certain types of network traffic require special attention based on how they are used, 
whereas other types of traffic do not. Consider network printing, for example. When a user 
sends a file to a network printer, speed is not a major concern. In many cases, there may 
be one printer for many users of a LAN. The printers are usually in a central location and 
easily accessible to all the users. After a user sends a document to the printer, they will need 
to get up from their desk and walk over to the printer to retrieve the print job. In a busy 
environment, there may be several print jobs queued up that were sent by different users. 
Depending on the urgency, the user may not retrieve the print job for several minutes or 
even hours. The point is that this kind of traffic usually has a low priority.
Conversely, other types of network traffic may have a high priority, such as real-time 
applications like voice, real-time video conferencing, and some streaming content. Using 
VoIP is becoming more common with enterprise networks, both wired and wireless. The 
same is true for certain types of video communications. This type of traffic requires special 
attention and priority in order to provide the user with a good networking experience. As 
the name implies, quality of service (QoS) will provide a better quality of network com-
munications for traffic such as voice and video. Unlike sending a file to a printer or saving a 
document to a network file server, using voice and video technology involves human senses 
such as hearing and sight. If you are having a telephone conversation with another person, 
you want good, reliable communication. The same goes for attending a live, real-time 
videoconference. The best way to accomplish this is to incorporate QoS with the network 
communications.
Both voice and video communications are subject to issues such as latency and jitter.
Latency    Voice and video communication are two types of networking applications that 
are subject to latency. Latency is basically a delay in the communications from the source 
device to a destination device. The latency is measured as the time value for a frame to get 
to a destination device. Most network engineers try to achieve a total one-way, end-to-end 
delay for voice communications of less than 150 milliseconds (ms). High latency can result 
in poor voice or real-time video communications.

Chapter 11 ■ Troubleshooting for Wireless Networking
Jitter   Jitter is the variation in the delay or latency of frames received by a destination 
device. Jitter can be controlled by using something known as a  jitter buffer . Buffering of 
information will allow for the data frames to be received as a steady stream of informa-
tion by the receiving device. Jitter buffers may add 30 to 50 ms to the latency to reduce the 
effects of jitter. Excessive jitter can cause poor quality VoIP calls and video delays. 
 Providing end-to-end QoS on a network is not necessarily a simple task, and depending 
on the device types, number of devices, and network infrastructure, it may be quite com-
plex. QoS is a complex topic, and the technical details are beyond the scope of the exam 
objectives and this book. 
 
 The Wi-Fi Alliance requires support of Wi-Fi Multimedia (WMM) in order 
for a MIMO device to be Wi-Fi certified. You should not disable WMM on 
any IEEE 802.11n or 802.11ac access point even if you are not using any 
QoS features. Disabling WMM on an access point will not use modulation 
coding scheme (MCS) data rates and will limit you to only 54 Mbps of sig-
naling rate and therefore have a negative effect on your throughput. 
 Summary 
 In this chapter, we looked at troubleshooting and maintenance concerns that may involve 
wireless networking. This included identifying WLAN problems as both global (many) and 
isolated (individual) and the process for troubleshooting these problems. Global problems 
may include wireless infrastructure devices, such as: 
 
■
 Wireless access points 
 
■
 Wireless bridges 
 
■
 WLAN controllers 
 Isolated problems usually include a single WLAN client device or computer that could 
be experiencing connectivity or data transfer issues. We also looked at basic RF com-
munications using a transmitter and receiver and how these devices operate in a WLAN. 
We examined connectivity issues, including no connectivity or weak connectivity, and the 
problems that can be associated with connectivity issues. No connectivity on the client side 
could be something as simple as a network adapter not enabled or could be related to some-
thing more in depth, including: 
 
■
 Upper layer TCP/IP issues 
 
■
 Security configurations 
 In this chapter, you learned about received signal strength and the difference between a 
strong signal and a weak signal, as well as some of the reasons why a wireless client device 
may experience weak or no signal. Throughput is another area we explored that involves 
client-side performance. We discussed some of the factors that could cause low throughput 
and how to solve these issues.

Upgrading software is another area that needs be taken into consideration with WLANs 
from the client side, upgrading device drivers or client software utilities, as well as the 
infrastructure side, which includes upgrading firmware. All of these areas are important 
parts of WLAN maintenance and support.
Finally, you saw how to optimize wireless networks and some of the areas that should 
be considered for this optimization, which may include making the necessary adjustments 
from the original wireless site survey. These adjustments could be a result of changes to the 
environment, such as walls, doors, windows, or other physical attributes of the location. 
Other important factors include client load balancing, multipath, hidden node issues, and 
QoS considerations.

are determined by the locale.
13.	 B.  The wavelength is the measurement of one complete cycle of an RF signal. The higher 
the frequency, the shorter the wavelength—therefore, the shorter the range. Frequency is 
the number of times an RF signal cycles in one second, amplitude is the height from a 2D 
perspective, and phase is a shift.
14.	 B.  Obstacles affect the RF line of sight. Phase and amplitude are characteristics of radio 
frequency, and interference affects the throughput.
15.	 C.  There are now 12 channels available for WLAN use in the unlicensed UNII-2e band as 
a result of the 802.11ac addition to the standard. Channel 144 is now available for use. Two 
of the other three 5 GHz bands have only 4 channels each, and depending on where it is 
used, the UNII-3 band now allows for up to 5 channels with the reclassification of channel 
165 to the UNII band.
16.	 A.  The amplitude is the height of an RF signal. The length of one cycle is the wavelength, 
the shift is phase, and width is not a valid factor.
17.	 B.  A 2.4 GHz 802.11b signal is 22 MHz wide. 25 MHz is the distance required to be con-
sidered nonoverlapping.
18.	 B.  An RF signal that bounces off a smooth surface is reflection. Refraction passes through, 
diffraction bends around, and scattering bounces off a non-smooth surface.
19.	 C.  The gain of an antenna is measured in dBi. This is a relative measure of power.
20.	 D.  Diffraction passes or bends around an obstacle. Reflection bounces off a smooth sur-
face, refraction passes through, and scattering bounces off an uneven surface.
Chapter 5: Antenna Technology for 
Wireless Networking
1.	
D.  Omnidirectional antennas have a horizontal beamwidth of 360°. The vertical beam-
width will vary depending on the design and the gain of the antenna.
2.	
B.  Antennas provide an increase in RF coverage by means of passive gain. Passive gain 
occurs when isotropic RF energy is focused into a specific radiation pattern. Active gain 
requires the use of an external power source.

Chapter 5: Antenna Technology for Wireless Networking 
513  
3.	
A.  Horizontal beamwidth is parallel to the earth’s surface. This is based on how the E-field 
propagates away from the antenna element. Vertical beamwidth is perpendicular to the 
earth’s surface.
4.	
B.  An IEEE 802.11a or IEEE 802.11b/g access point will require two antennas for diversity. 
Although there are two antennas, a single input/single output access point will have only 
one radio. The access point provides additional intelligence to determine which antenna 
to use. Other WLAN technologies, such as IEEE 802.11ac MIMO, may use multiple 
antennas.
5.	
B.  A lightning arrestor is used to protect a WLAN system from an indirect lightning strike. 
A lightning arrestor will direct transient or induced electrical current to earth ground as a 
result of a lightning strike.
6.	
A.  Active gain requires an external power source to provide an increase in signal strength. 
An amplifier is an example of a device that uses active gain. Antennas provide an increase 
in strength by using passive gain.
7.	
C.  Highly directional antennas are typically used for long-range point-to-point connectiv-
ity, such as bridge links. Omnidirectional antennas are used as part of an access point sys-
tem or to provide point-to-multipoint links.
8.	
A.  Changing the orientation of a device or antenna will change the polarization and affect 
the received signal strength. The signal strength may either increase or decrease depending 
on how the polarization is changed from the original position. Wavelength, frequency, and 
phase are characteristics of RF.
9.	
A, C.  Point-to-point and point-to-multipoint both require RF line of sight to be able to 
effectively communicate. Scattering, reflection, and refraction are all behaviors of RF.
10.	 C, D.  Cables and connectors can both result in a loss of signal strength. Antennas and 
amplifiers will add gain or increase signal strength. A transmitter outputs an absolute 
amount of power.
11.	 A.  802.11g access points require only one antenna to function. Systems that support 
antenna diversity will require two antennas to correctly operate.
12.	 B.  802.11a access points can use antenna diversity. Gain and polarization are considered 
RF concepts.
13.	 A.  The image is an example of an omnidirectional antenna. This type of antenna provides 
a horizontal radiation pattern of 360°.
14.	 C.  Of the answers listed, wind would have the biggest impact on a WLAN system. Rain, 
snow, and hail do not affect wireless transmission unless the weather is severe. In this case, 
the collection of the elements may have an impact on the WLAN signal transmitted or 
received.
15.	 C.  WLAN cables and devices are rated at 50 ohms impedance. Cable and satellite television 
is rated at 75 ohms.

514 
Appendix  ■  Answers to Review Questions
16.	 B.  The curvature of the earth or earth bulge will have an impact on a WLAN signal after 
seven miles. If the signal needs to travel farther than seven miles, the antenna will have to 
be installed in a higher location.
17.	 A.  A patch antenna provides semidirectional coverage. The amount of coverage depends on 
the design and gain of the antenna. Parabolic dishes are highly directional.
18.	 B.  The horizontal RF radiation pattern of an antenna is displayed using an azimuth chart. 
The vertical radiation pattern is displayed using an elevation chart.
19.	 D.  It is recommended that at least 60 percent of the Fresnel zone be free of obstruction in 
order to have acceptable RF line of sight. Up to 40 percent of the zone can be blocked by 
obstructions without affecting the signal.
20.	 D.  The image shows a patch antenna. This is an example of a semidirectional antenna.
Chapter 6: Communication for Wireless 
Networking
1.	
B.  When a wireless client device listens for beacons, it is performing passive scanning. 
Active scanning is sending a probe request. Authentication occurs after the probe phase. 
Power save puts the device into a low power state.
2.	
C.  Dynamic rate switching (also called dynamic rate selection) allows a WLAN device to 
adjust data rates based on received signal. Dynamic frequency selection allows an access 
point to pick the best frequency to operate on based on the environment. Transmit power 
control automatically adjusts output power. Transmit save mode does not exist.
3.	
A.  An IBSS uses no access points and is also known as peer-to-peer or ad hoc networking. 
A BSS uses one access point.
4.	
C.  If a device is part of a peer-to-peer network, it will connect to other like devices. An 
access point and a wireless switch are both infrastructure networking devices and will be 
part of either a BSS or ESS.
5.	
A.  The data rate decreases as a WLAN device moves away from an access point. The data 
rates increase as a WLAN device moves closer to one access point. The output power does 
not change based on the location of the wireless device in the radio range of the access 
point.
6.	
C.  An SSID can be a maximum of 32 characters or octets and is also case-sensitive.
7.	
B.  If access points on the same DS are set with different SSIDs, the client will lose the con-
nection while roaming unless all SSIDs are set in the client utility. The channel is set by the 
access point, and the BSSID is the MAC address of the AP radio.
8.	
C.  Beacons are management frames and are used in the passive scanning process. Data 
frames carry data payload. Control frames reserve the medium and acknowledgment 
frames. Detail frames do not exist.

Chapter 6: Communication for Wireless Networking 
515  
9.	
B.  The client must authenticate to an access point before it can associate. After both 
authentication and association have been completed, the client is considered to be part of 
the BSS.
10.	 B.  Moving throughout a location will cause a wireless client to roam from one access point 
to another. As part of the roaming process a client sometimes, but not always, needs to 
reauthenticate.
11.	 A, C.  To successfully set up an ad hoc network, a user must know two parameters: the 
SSID and the RF channel it will be operating on. The BSSID is automatically generated in 
an ad hoc network. The BSSID is the MAC address of an AP radio; APs are not used in ad 
hoc networks. Protection mode does not apply to the situation.
12.	 B.  Open system authentication uses two frames. The first frame is from the client to the 
access point, and the second frame is from the access point back to the client. Shared-key 
authentication uses four frames.
13.	 C.  In 802.11b/g/n and mixed mode environments, throughput will be affected because of 
ERP protection mechanisms. Association and authentication are normal frames exchanged 
and do not affect throughput. HT protection mode is for 802.11n.
14.	 A, C.  An SSID has a maximum of 32 characters or octets. SSIDs are case sensitive.
15.	 A.  The BSSID is the unique identifying MAC address of the access point’s radio network 
adapter. This abbreviation is sometimes confused with SSID, which is a network name. The 
other MAC addresses are used in networking but are not representative of the BSSID.
16.	 B.  A network consisting only of wireless client stations is an independent basic service set 
(IBSS). Other terms for this type of network are ad hoc and peer-to-peer. Infrastructure 
mode is a term used with a basic service set that consists of a single access point. Active and 
passive are scanning modes in which wireless devices connect to a wireless network.
17.	 C.  Because the computer is almost always plugged into an AC power source, it is unneces-
sary to have the device perform power save functions. Therefore, active mode (sometimes 
referred to as continuous aware mode) is the best solution. Power save mode would work 
well for a device that is on battery power and will help extend the battery life. Association 
and passive mode do not pertain to power save.
18.	 A.  An ESS, as stated in the IEEE 802.11 standard, is one or more interconnected basic 
­service sets.
19.	 A.  In order for a wireless client to become part of a basic service set, it must first authenti-
cate and then associate. The distribution system is the network in which the access point is 
physically connected. Deauthentication and reauthentication occur when a client either logs 
off the wireless network or roams from one access point to another.
20.	 B.  A BSS consists of only one access point. An IBSS has zero access points. A network with 
more than one access point would be considered an ESS.

Appendix  ■  Answers to Review Questions
Chapter 7: Modulation Technology for 
Wireless Networking
1.	
C.  IEEE WLAN devices use half-duplex communication. Half-duplex is defined as two-
way communication only one way at a time. Wired LANs can use full-duplex communica-
tion, which is two-way communication transmitting in both directions simultaneously. An 
example of duplex is to combine signals from two different frequencies into a single  
transmitter/receiver.
2.	
A.  DSSS devices operate in the 2.4 to 2.5 GHz ISM band. OFDM devices operate in the  
5 GHz UNII bands.
3.	
B.  IEEE 802.11g/n operates in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. A total of three access points can be 
co-located before interference becomes an issue.
4.	
D, E.  The IEEE 802.11n and 802.11ac amendment devices use MIMO, multiple radio 
chains, and antennas to operate. IEEE 802.11a/b/g devices use one radio and may use mul-
tiple antennas for diversity.
5.	
C.  Spread-spectrum technology sends data over many subcarrier frequencies. Narrowband 
technology is not used in IEEE-based WLANs but is used in other technology, such as radio 
and TV. Wireless broadband provides high-speed wireless data communications and wire-
less Internet over a WAN. Wideband uses a wide range of frequencies, and spectral mask 
refers to the signal levels of the RF.
6.	
B, C, D.  802.11b channels need to be separated by at least five channels or 25 MHz to be 
considered non-overlapping. Channels 3 and 9 are separated by six channels; channels 6 
and 11 are separated by five channels; and channels 2 and 8 are separated by six channels. 
All of these scenarios are nonoverlapping channels.
7.	
A.  CSMA/CA uses collision avoidance. CSMA/CD uses collision detection. CSMA/CR and 
CSMA/DSSS do not exist.
8.	
A.  DSSS uses Barker code at 1 Mbps. CCK is for 5.5 Mbps. DBPSK and DQPSK are modu-
lation technologies, not spreading codes.
9.	
A.  FM radio stations use narrowband communication, which is high power and  
narrow frequency. WLANs use spread-spectrum technology, which is low power  
and wide frequency.
10.	 D.  HR/DSSS channels are 22 MHz wide. FHSS uses 1 MHz subcarrier frequencies. OFDM, 
ERP-OFDM, and HT-OFDM use 20 MHz–wide channels, and HT-OFDM can also use  
40 MHz–wide channels.
11.	 D.  Bluetooth operates in the 2.4 GHz band and can cause interference with WLAN devices 
that operate in the 2.4 GHz band, including FHSS, DSSS, and OFDM.

Chapter 8: Security Fundamentals for Wireless Networking 
517  
12.	 D.  OFDM can be used in 802.11a or ERP-OFDM used in 802.11g and supports a maxi-
mum data rate of 54 Mbps. 802.11b supports a maximum data rate of 11 Mbps. OFDM is 
also used with 802.11n devices, but the maximum data rate is 600 Mbps.
13.	 C.  HT-OFDM used in IEEE 802.11n can support data rates as high as 600 Mbps, OFDM 
used in 802.11a supports a maximum of 54 Mbps, and DSSS supports a maximum of 11 
Mbps. Ethernet is not a WLAN technology.
14.	 C, D.  IEEE 802.11a WLANs operate in the 5 GHz UNII bands. 802.11b/g WLANs oper-
ate in the 2.4 GHz ISM band.
15.	 D.  IEEE 802.11b and 802.11g amendments are interoperable. 802.11a networks operate in 
the 5 GHz UNII bands and therefore are incompatible with 802.11b/g.
16.	 D.  802.11b/g/n operates in the 2.4 GHz ISM band and will allow for 14 channels. The 
channels that can be used will depend on where the WLAN is located.
17.	 B.  OFDM uses a 20–MHz wide channel to transfer data. 22 MHz–wide, 40 MHz–wide, 
and 80 MHz–wide channels are used with other technologies.
18.	 B.  The IEEE 802.11b amendment specifies data rates of 5.5 and 11 Mbps. OFDM allows 
for data rates up to 54 Mbps and is used in IEEE 802.11a and IEEE 802.11g amendments.
19.	 C.  VHT-OFDM, defined in the IEEE 802.11ac amendment to the standard, allows for 20 
MHz–, 40 MHz–, 80 MHz–, and 160 MHz–wide channels for transmitting and receiving 
data. DSSS uses a 22 MHz–wide channel, and OFDM and ERP-OFDM use only 20 MHz–
wide channels to transmit and receive data.
20.	 D.  Current MIMO technology allows for up to 600 Mbps in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. One 
way this is accomplished is by using multipath as a benefit rather than a hindrance.
Chapter 8: Security Fundamentals for 
Wireless Networking
1.	
A, B, E.  WPA Enterprise, WEP, and MAC filtering can all be used to secure 802.11a/b/g 
access points. PPTP is a Layer 3 security solution that consists of both tunneling and 
encryption. IPSec is a Layer 3 VPN encryption mechanism. RBAC stands for role-based 
access control and is a way of restricting access to only authorized users.
2.	
A, D.  Both WPA2 Personal and WEP support shared key security. The WPA2 Personal 
algorithm creates a 256-bit preshared key. WEP can be used with either a 64-bit or 128-bit 
key. WPA Enterprise, 802.1X/EAP, and WPA2 Enterprise all use the 802.1X process to cre-
ate a key.

518 
Appendix  ■  Answers to Review Questions
3.	
B.  Passphrases are available for use with WPA Personal or WPA2 Personal and are capable 
of providing strong security for the home user or small office. SSID hiding should not be 
used for security because the SSID can be found in frames other than beacons. MAC filters 
are considered legacy solutions and can be easily spoofed using software downloadable 
from the Internet. 128-bit WEP can be cracked very quickly using software tools and is 
therefore not a secure solution.
4.	
C.  In order to provide a secure connection between your laptop and the office network, a 
Layer 3 VPN solution would be the best choice. Passphrase security and WEP require the 
access point to be configured, and this typically is not the case in public hotspots. 802.1X/
EAP is enterprise security and usually does not apply to public hotspots.
5.	
E.  A MAC filter is used to allow or deny WLAN devices access to a wireless access point. 
WEP is a shared key security mechanism. IPSec encryption is used in Layer 3 VPNs. SSIDs 
are used as a network name and for segmentation. RF is radio frequency and cannot be 
filtered.
6.	
B.  The IEEE 802.11i amendment to the standard requires CCMP. WEP is an optional 
authentication/encryption method defined in the original 802.11 standard. TKIP is an 
enhancement to WEP that usually was accomplished as a firmware upgrade for older equip-
ment. PPTP and VPN are both Layer 3 solutions and not defined in any IEEE wireless 
amendment.
7.	
A.  A VPN is a Layer 3 security solution that provides secure data transmissions over a pub-
lic network infrastructure such as the Internet. WEP, WPA, 802.1X/EAP, and WPA 2.0 are 
examples of Layer 2 security solutions.
8.	
A.  RBAC is a method used to restrict access only to authorized users. RBAC assigns per-
missions or access to roles to which users can be added.
9.	
D.  If the SSID of the wireless network is hidden, the user will need knowledge of the SSID 
in order to connect to the wireless network. The SSID broadcast is only enabled on an 
access point or WLAN controller/switch. Getting a new password from the help desk will 
not provide the SSID of the wireless network. Entering a username and password is user-
based authentication.
10.	 C.  RADIUS is a centralized authentication method that is used to authenticate users on a 
wireless network. Accessing a corporate network using a modem is a function of remote 
access services. Making a call to the help desk and requesting a username and password 
is not a function of RADIUS; however, the help desk may be able to assist with username 
and password issues. Requesting remote assistance to help solve a software problem is more 
related to troubleshooting and not a function of RADIUS.
11.	 B.  In 802.1X networking, the access point is also known as the authenticator. The suppli-
cant is another term for the client device, and the authentication server can be a RADIUS or 
AAA authentication source.
12.	 D.  The original IEEE 802.11 standard identifies WEP as an optional authentication/
encryption method. AES and CCMP are addressed in the 802.11i amendment to the stan-
dard. TKIP is an enhancement to WEP and not identified in the original standard. EAP 
provides an authentication process and is used with 802.1X networks.

Chapter 9: Design for Wireless Networking 
519  
13.	 A, C.  Higher levels of RF activity reported by an intrusion prevention system could mean 
an RF DoS attack is underway or could be misrepresented as interference from a neighbor-
ing access point. A deauthentication storm or encryption attack would be identified differ-
ently in a wireless intrusion prevention system. A misconfigured client workstation would 
not cause this type of alert.
14.	 C.  WEP is typically 64-bit or 128-bit encryption. The numbers 5, 10, 13, and 26 are 
related to the number of characters the WEP key can be in either ASCII or hexadecimal.
15.	 B.  PIN-based security is mandatory for both access points and client devices in order to be 
considered Wi-Fi Protected Setup certified. PBC or push-button configuration is optional 
for client devices in this certification. WPA is a pre-802.11i certification that addresses 
TKIP and is used in either SOHO or enterprise-based wireless networks. Wi-Fi Protected 
Setup is not intended for enterprise WLAN deployments.
16.	 B.  A WIPS will automatically monitor the network for signatures that match potential 
intrusion techniques. An intrusion prevention system has the capability to automatically 
shut down a rogue access point. An intrusion detection system requires a manual shutdown. 
A WIPS will not notify a network administrator of a recent firmware upgrade.
17.	 B.  If WEP must be used on a wireless network, the devices that use WEP should be sepa-
rated using VLANs. This will protect the rest of the network from being compromised. 
Voice transmissions can be seen with the correct tools. CCMP/AES is available in newer 
devices that support the latest wireless security methods but is not available in older 
devices.
18.	 B.  An intruder can spoof a MAC address in order to circumvent the MAC filter and gain 
access to the wireless network. Encryption cracking is a different form of intrusion that 
also could possibly allow an intruder to steal a user’s authentication credentials. An RF DoS 
attack is caused by transmitting high-energy RF to prevent access to the wireless network.
19.	 C.  PIN-based security is usually used with SOHO brand wireless devices that support WPS 
certification. The devices are typically used in SOHO installations or by home-based users. 
WPA 2.0 solutions can use either passphrase or 802.1X/EAP.
20.	 A.  L2TP commonly uses IPSec for encryption. PPTP is another VPN method that uses 
MPPE 128-bit encryption. AES and WEP are used with Layer 2 802.11-based wireless 
networks.
Chapter 9: Design for Wireless 
Networking
1.	
A, C. The main objectives of a wireless site survey are to determine areas of RF interfer-
ence and RF coverage as well as locations of access points and other infrastructure devices. 
The applications used have more to do with capacity planning. Wiring closet locations and 
security implantations are factors that need to be taken into account but are not the main 
objectives.

520 
Appendix  ■  Answers to Review Questions
2.	
D.  Because of RF propagation, site surveys are really three-dimensional. Therefore, in a 
three-story building all floors need to be taken into consideration. Omnidirectional anten-
nas may be polarized either vertically or horizontally. Single-channel architectures use the 
same channel for multiple floors.
3.	
A, B.  A spectrum analyzer and a tool that passively scans for wireless networks, such as 
NetStumbler, can be used for a manual site survey. The other options’ association and 
authentication can be viewed using a protocol analyzer and are not “standalone” tools.
4.	
A, C.  Manual site surveys can be either passive or active. Scanning is a method of locating 
WLANs. A spectrum analyzer will allow you to see the RF. A packet is information that 
carries computer data from one device to another.
5.	
B, D.  Non–Wi-Fi interference is interference by anything other than WLANs that oper-
ates in the same frequency range. AM radios and digital TV systems do not operate in the 
license-free bands. 802.11b interference is WLAN interference. Radar systems operate in 
the 5 GHz U-NII band.
6.	
C.  Recommended received signal strength for voice applications in the 2.4 GHz ISM band 
at a data rate of 54 Mbps is about –67 dBm. A recommended SNR is more than 20 to 25 dB.
7.	
C.  A predictive modeling site survey is software-based and takes the attenuation values of 
the building and other materials into consideration. Active and passive are forms of manual 
site surveys and record actual information about the site.
8.	
B.  OFDM networks operate in the 5 GHz U-NII band and would not affect an 802.11g/n 
network that operates in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. FHSS, DSSS, and ERP-OFDM all operate 
in the 2.4 GHz ISM band and could cause interference with an 802.11g network.
9.	
A, B.  The signal strength and SNR are two important values to record during the manual 
site survey process. Signal loss and propagation loss have different effects, and packet 
retries are more of an issue with dynamic rate selection.
10.	 C.  Manual site surveys can be very accurate because actual readings are taken at the site 
using test access points and a wireless client. This can take quite some time to complete 
depending on the size of the location. Wireless hardware is required to perform the site sur-
vey, and access to the whole facility is required.
11.	 A.  A spectrum analyzer can be used to view RF. Wireless packets, data rates, and associa-
tion frames can be viewed with a protocol analyzer.
12.	 B.  Since new hardware will be purchased and backward compatibility is not required, you 
could recommend using wireless network hardware that works in the 5 GHz band. This 
will eliminate interference from the other tenants that are using the 2.4 GHz ISM band. 
Automatic channel selection, spectrum analysis, and predictive modeling site survey will 
not help, because surrounding access points already use the entire band.
13.	 B.  A predictive modeling site survey will take less time than a passive survey, because a 
passive survey requires a manual analysis. Onsite protocol analysis or scanning utility will 
determine areas of RF interference from WLANs. The predictive modeling survey does not 
help you choose manufacturers’ equipment to be used in a deployment.

Chapter 10: Mobile Device Management and BYOD Fundamentals 
521  
14.	 D.  A verification of the predictive survey should be performed to verify that the survey 
meets the customer’s requirements. Although not required, it should be considered.
15.	 D.  Dead spots (areas that lack RF coverage) should be identified on floor plans or blue-
prints. This is part of standard documentation practices. Marking them with tape, taking 
a photograph, and showing the site manager in person are not the best ways to document 
dead spots.
16.	 B.  An active site survey requires the survey device to associate to an access point. A passive 
site survey monitors all access points in the area. A predictive modeling site survey does not 
involve associating to an access point. Associating to an access point is not a required part 
of manual testing.
17.	 D.  A semidirectional antenna such as a Yagi is a good choice for an application requiring 
coverage down a long hallway or corridor. Low- or high-gain omnidirectional antennas will 
provide 360-degree horizontal coverage. Parabolic dish antennas are typically used for out-
door, long-range bridging.
18.	 D.  In this situation, correct antenna selection is important to provide optimal coverage as 
well as proper aesthetics. In this example, a spectrum analysis or protocol analysis could 
be performed but is not required. Environmental conditions are typically not an issue in a 
small office deployment.
19.	 A.  Co-channel interference is caused by two access points operating on the same RF 
channel. Access points operating on channels 1 and 2 may cause adjacent channel interfer-
ence. Channels 1, 6, and 11 are nonoverlapping channels and will not interfere with one 
another.
20.	 A, E.  A walk-through of the location and spectrum analysis are both recommended 
guidelines when performing a manual site survey. Equipment purchase and client device 
configuration are additional factors to consider but are not part of the manual site survey. 
A predictive analysis is a software-based site survey solution that does not require manual 
testing.

B, C.  Software as a Service (SaaS) is a type of MDM solution that is cloud-managed and 
does not require a hardware investment for the organization. This type of solution can be 
can be used anywhere there is an active Internet connection. On-premises technology is 
an MDM solution that requires the organization supply all hardware and software com-
ponents and may require a significant investment. Centralized management and control 
is a method used with managing networks. Controller-based technology is used by some 
WLAN manufacturers to provide centralized management and control of the wireless net-
work infrastructure.

D.  The enterprise app store helps an organization control and regulate the apps that are 
used within its environment, including custom- or purpose-built apps. The consumer 
mobile app store is intended for the common user to download or purchase commercial, 
off-the-shelf (COTS) mobile apps. Native and hybrid apps can actually be accessed from 
either a consumer or enterprise app store.
3.	
B.  Geo-location can use different methods to locate a device. One example is time differ-
ence of arrival (TDoA), which is a multilateration technology technique. TDoA measures 
the difference in distance between two stations from known locations. Geo-fencing, from 
a mobile computing perspective, is a virtual electronic boundary that allows network 
administrators to identify when specific mobile devices enter or leave an area. On-boarding 
is the process of connecting a device to a wireless network for the first time and allowing a 
user to register it in order to gain access to the company and other network resources. Off-
boarding or de-provisioning is the opposite; a device is removed from the network.
4.	
C.  A profile is a set of parameters or instructions that will provide a device with the ability 
to connect to a network and follow specific requirements or settings for the connected ses-
sion. The EULA is an agreement between the creator of the software package and the orga-
nization or person that purchased the software. Geo-location technology allows for many 
different device types to be geographically located using different techniques. A mobile 
device digital certificate can be used as an access control method and will ensure that only 
valid, authorized users can gain access to the corporate network infrastructure.

sion. Disabling or changing a profile can cause a variety of technical issues. Typically, an app 
installation or operating system update would not cause this type of problem. Assigning a 
static IP address should not be a problem as long as the address is on the correct IP subnet.
6.	
C.  Location services will need to be enabled on the physical device in order to physically 
locate it and to benefit from geo-location and geo-fencing. Geo-fencing technology can 
work on a variety of mobile devices, including Android devices. An application program-
ming interface (API) is a set of programming instructions and standards used within soft-
ware development. A revoked certificate would prevent a device from authenticating to the 
network.
7.	
A.  On-boarding is the process of connecting a device to a wireless network for the first 
time and allowing a user to register it to gain access to the company and other network 
resources. Devices that contain cellular capabilities will require some type of activation 
process in order to be used on the wireless carrier network. Tethering a smartphone using a 
USB cable or Bluetooth technology will allow a device to have wireless broadband capabili-
ties, usually for an additional fee. With regard to technology, a security policy defines an 
agreement between a corporation or the technology provider and the technology user.
8.	
B, C.  Both access permissions and data encryption will limit the access of information to 
authorized users. Data encryption methods will ensure that the information is secure in 
transit. Secure SSID is another term for SSID hiding and is not a recommended security 
practice. Location services will allow for geo-fencing and geo-location services to track 
devices. MAC address filtering will allow or deny device access to a wireless access point 
based on its MAC address.

9.	
A.  A digital certificate can be used as an access control method and will ensure that only 
valid, authorized users can gain access to the corporate network infrastructure. Digital 
rights management is a method of controlling access to copyrighted material for many dif-
ferent electronic digital formats. Both WPA and WPA2 are methods used to control access; 
however, the encryption of TKIP is weak compared to CCMP.
10.	 D.  The Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) uses a native push notification technol-
ogy and allows an iOS device to receive information even when the destination app is 
not open or running. GCM (Google Cloud Messaging) is a push notification service that 
allows for data to be sent from a server to Android-based devices. Dynamic Host Con-
figuration Protocol (DHCP) is a networking protocol/service that provides the dynamic 
mapping and assignments of logical Layer 3 IP addresses of a network device to the 
physical Layer 2 MAC addresses of a network device. Simple Mail Transfer Protocol 
(SMTP) is the Internet standard that electronic mail services use to send and receive 
email messages.
11.	 B.  Pushing content is a method to allow operating systems and updates, configuration set-
tings, and more to be sent to mobile devices. This is a common requirement in enterprise 
device deployments. MDM solutions allow for information to be pushed out to all specified 
mobile devices that connect to the corporate network. Content update is a process in which 
information is changed on servers that will be accessed via an Internet browser or used to 
provide updates to devices. An update server is a machine used to provide the content for 
devices, and distributed edge is a technology that provides intelligent devices such as wire-
less access points the ability to handle specific functions without the aid of a centralized 
control point.
12.	 C.  Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is used to query an X.500 directory ser-
vice database, which will authenticate users or devices based on their credentials. Directory 
services objects are users and group objects that are created in a database to allow access 
to network resources. Directory service database replication is a method of duplicating a 
network database to provide redundancy and fault tolerance. Assigning permissions to user 
objects allows the user to gain access to any resource it is granted access to.
13.	 B.  Telecommunications expense management defines managing expenses for mobile device 
technology, such as managing the amount of data communications available to a device 
or data plan. Defining the corporate budget for departmental expenses is unrelated to the 
actual expense management and falls under those responsible for budgetary tasks. Limits 
for the number of devices supported by MDM are based on the number of licenses pur-
chased for the MDM solution. The ROI for SaaS vs. on-premises MDM solutions is per-
formed prior to any purchasing or implementation of on MDM solution.
14.	 C.  A walled garden is another term used to describe a captive web portal, which is a web 
page redirection. The EULA is an agreement between the creator of the software package 
and the organization or person that purchased the software. PKI is an enterprise security 
solution that requires a certificate-based implementation for user and device authentication. 
A VPN will create private secure communications over a public network infrastructure, 
such as the Internet.

524 
Appendix  ■  Answers to Review Questions
15.	 B.  A self-service portal is a method of onboarding a device for corporate policy com-
pliance, which gives users the ability to register their devices to the network, enabling 
quick access to the network without the need to open a service ticket or contact the help 
desk for technical support. Enabling devices to allow MDM systems to handle a data 
plan management falls under telecommunications expense management. Multilateration 
technology is a technique for device location utilizing time difference of arrival (TDoA) 
with geo-location. Creating device groups for ease of access is part of a directory service 
administration task.
16.	 A, C.  General policy and functional policy are two of the main parts of a corporate secu-
rity policy. The general policy components consist of the policy purpose and business jus-
tification, management approval, policy definition and documentation processes, training 
policies, revision processes, violations and response, legal concerns, and potential threat 
assessment. The functional, or technical, side commonly consists of administrator and user 
training, monitoring, auditing, response and forensics, defining acceptable use, and security 
requirements, including authentication, encryption, and passcode and password policies. 
OEM is the definition for original equipment manufacturer and with regards to mobile 
technology defines when a company purchases the rights to resell a product under its own 
brand name. A termination policy is used to disconnect devices from a network based on a 
specific policy violation.
17.	 C.  The digital certificate is commonly used as an access control method by validating a 
user or device identity based on the criteria on which a certificate was issued. A policy is 
used to define specific settings and configuration information based on the user or device 
type connecting to a network. A directory service database—such as Microsoft Active 
Directory, Novell eDirectory, or Red Hat Directory Server—is used to manage users, 
groups, devices, and other resources. LBS is a method used for locating devices over the 
Internet.
18.	 B, C.  Software as a Service (SaaS) and on-premises are two common placements for an 
MDM solution. The EULA is an agreement between the creator of the software package 
and the organization or person that purchased the software. A walled garden is another 
term used to describe a captive web portal, which is a web page redirection. A self-service 
portal is a method of on-boarding a device for corporate policy compliance.
19.	 B.  An acceptable use policy a technology method to ensure a user will comply with corpo-
rate policy in order to access and use any computer network resources or services. EULA is 
an agreement between the creator of the software package and the organization or person 
that purchased the software. A content-filtering policy is used to identify how content may 
be accessed based on the device or user that connects to a network. A pilot program enables 
a network administrator to validate that technology will work as specified and designed 
prior to a full deployment.
20.	 C, E.  User group assignments and an MDM policy are two items that could make a device 
unable to access a company’s intranet website. The EULA is used an agreement between 
the creator of the software package and the organization or person who purchased the 
software. A PKI installation is an enterprise security method that uses digital certificates to 
validate a user’s identity. The correct Wi-Fi settings will enable a device to connect to a net-
work; incorrect settings would not allow any type of connectivity.

Chapter 11: Troubleshooting for Wireless 
Networking
1.	
D.  Multipath is caused by reflected signals arriving at the receiver at slightly different times 
(delay spread). Refraction is an RF behavior caused by passing through an object of differ-
ent density, resulting in a change of the signal strength. Absorption is the result of a signal 
not reflecting or bending or passing around an obstacle.
2.	
B.  A wireless client device showing a low received signal strength value could be too far 
away from an access point. Of the answers listed, an additional access point would be the 
best solution. Upgrading the client device or the firmware would not help the situation. 
Multipath is caused by reflections and cannot be eliminated.
3.	
B.  A user experiencing a slow connection could be too far away from an access point to get 
a strong enough signal to move data at the highest rate. A 5.8 GHz phone is operating at a 
different frequency and would not cause interference with an 802.11g/n 2.4 GHz WLAN. 
A MAC filter is set on an access point and will either allow or disallow a client connection. 
If a firmware upgrade were causing a problem for an access point, it would affect all users.
4.	
A.  Increasing the output power of the access point will result in a higher received signal at 
the wireless client device. Enabling load balancing will not improve signal strength but will 
limit the number of devices that associate with an access point and may improve through-
put. Upgrading the ISP service to faster data rates will not improve signal strength for the 
wireless client. Enabling security such as WPA 2.0 will not increase the signal strength seen 
by the client but is recommended to secure the transmission.
5.	
C.  Incorrect security parameters such as a WPA passphrase will prevent a wireless client 
device from completing a Layer 2 connection and obtaining an IP address from a DHCP 
service. If the client device is different technology like 802.11a, the device would not have 
been able to connect. If a static IP address is used, it will not display all zeros. Although a 
computer virus can create problems for the client device, it would not prevent the device 
from obtaining an IP address after connecting to the wireless network.
6.	
B.  A sudden change in performance might occur if an access point for a new tenant is set 
to the same RF channel as your client’s access point. This could cause interference, which 
would degrade performance. A firmware upgrade on the access point usually fixes problems 
or provides enhancements. Received signal strength is typically an issue based on distance 
from an access point. Diversity antennas would help minimize the problems associated with 
multipath and in most cases would improve performance rather than degrade it.
7.	
A.  A hidden node problem caused by obstructions could be resolved by adding another 
access point so that wireless client devices would not be subject to clear channel assessment 
issues. Setting an access point to mixed mode will allow both 802.11b and 802.11g/n client 
devices to connect to the network. Increasing the distance between the access point and the 
clients will not improve the situation but will actually make it worse. Adjusting the received 
signal strength on the client would improve performance for that client but would not nec-
essarily solve the hidden node problem.

526 
Appendix  ■  Answers to Review Questions
8.	
B.  The WLAN client device would be mostly affected by weak signal strength. An infra-
structure device such as an access point generates the signal received by the client. Mul-
tipath is a phenomenon that is a result of several wavefronts of the same signal reaching a 
receiver at different times. A transmitter device is responsible for sending an RF signal.
9.	
A.  A passphrase or preshared key will be validated after an 802.11 authentication and 
association. In order for the client device to get a valid IP address, a successful authentica-
tion, association, and passphrase would have to occur. A deauthentication will end the 
authentication state, and a disassociation will no longer allow a device to pass traffic across 
the access point.
10.	 C.  Two factors that may have an impact on throughput in a WLAN are distance from the 
access point or the output power level of an access point. The IP address and MAC address 
identify the device on the network and would not affect throughput. The output power of 
the client device has more to do with its transmitting capabilities than the receiver’s capa-
bilities.
11.	 A.  The device driver is a required component that allows the wireless network adapter card 
to interface with the operating system. A device driver neither provides security nor identi-
fies the network.
12.	 A.  Hidden node caused by different technology types is the result of the access point not 
being able to differentiate between spread-spectrum technologies. An access point set to 
mixed mode will understand both HR/DSSS and ERP-OFDM, which will solve the prob-
lem. Adding another access point or increasing output power would not solve the problem, 
although such actions could be solutions for other hidden node scenarios. Removing an 
obstacle is a valid solution for a different hidden node problem.
13.	 D.  A corrupt device driver may cause the network adapter card in a wireless client device  
to operate incorrectly or to malfunction. A terminated Internet connection would be a 
global problem and would affect all users. An upgrade or incorrect firmware would not 
cause the problem for only a single user.
14.	 A.  Layer 1 provides the physical connectivity between devices, which use the air as the 
medium to carry the RF. Layers 3 and 4 are responsible for TCP/IP. Layer 7 is the interface 
to the user, also known as the Application layer.
15.	 C.  Windows 98 and later are designed to use the Automatic Private IP Address service. 
This service will provide an IP address to client devices in the range of 169.254.x.x. This 
will allow local connectivity for any devices that are connected to a common LAN.
16.	 A.  The distance from an access point could affect the received signal strength for a wireless 
client device. The distance from other clients has no impact on devices that are connected 
to an access point. The distance from an Ethernet switch or from the wiring closet has no 
impact on a wireless client.
17.	 B.  The signal-to-noise ratio represents the difference between the received signal strength 
and the level of the noise floor. A good signal-to-noise ratio will enable a client to distin-
guish between signal and noise and allow it to recover data that was transmitted.

Chapter 11: Troubleshooting for Wireless Networking 
527  
18.	 D.  802.11n/ac takes advantage of multipath, which is typically a problem for other WLAN 
technologies. By using multipath, 802.11n/ac devices will have better throughput than 
802.11b/g devices. Received signal strength means the same thing across technologies. 
DHCP is a service that provides IP addresses automatically. Hidden node is a problem that 
may degrade throughput for connected devices.
19.	 A.  Adding access points can help increase the throughput for a WLAN client device. This 
is possible because additional access points would allow for load-balancing features and 
therefore provide less contention at that access point. Upgrading the client software to full-
duplex mode is not an option, and if the RF noise were increased, throughput would be 
less. Hiding the SSID has no impact on throughput.
20.	 C.  Increasing the gain of an antenna will provide a larger RF coverage cell, thereby provid-
ing more received signal at the same distance for a wireless client device. Upgrading the 
wireless client will not improve the received signal strength. Load balancing will help with 
throughput, and Microsoft Windows WLAN AutoConfig service is an example of a built-in 
client utility.
