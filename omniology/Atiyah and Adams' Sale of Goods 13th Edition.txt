Preface to the Thirteenth Edition
Since the last edition of this book was published, there have been a number of significant 
developments. The most immediate one is that the editor of several previous editions, 
Professor John N Adams, sadly passed away suddenly on 14 April 2012, and so this 
edition has been prepared by two new editors (Christian Twigg-Flesner and Rick 
Canavan), with the continuing involvement for this edition of Hector MacQueen. We 
were both delighted and daunted in equal measure by this task: this book is a well-
established and highly regarded text on the sale of goods, and so we were honoured to 
be asked to assume responsibility for updating the text to prepare this edition. This has 
proven quite challenging: updating a text written by somebody else is a very different 
task from updating one’s own work, but we have tried to do so with care so as to ensure 
new and updated material slots into the existing text as neatly as possible. For that 
reason, we have generally limited any updating to adding important cases only, and 
deleting material which had become out of date. As a result, much of the text of this 
edition should be familiar to those who have read previous editions. However, there are 
two noticeable differences from previous editions: the first is that we have started to 
consolidate some of the smaller chapters, and this has resulted in a reduction of the 
overall number of chapters. Also, some of the sequencing has changed, which, we hope, 
has made the overall arrangement of the chapters more logical. The second change is 
more obvious: a new part on ‘Consumer Sales’ has been created. Since the last edition 
was published, there have been major changes to the consumer law landscape in the 
United Kingdom, following the implementation of the Consumer Rights Directive 
into domestic law, and the enactment of the Consumer Rights Act 2015. The latter, in 
particular, is very significant because it has resulted in the removal of all the consumer-
specific provisions from the Sale of Goods Act 1979, and only a few provisions in the 1979 
Act remain relevant to consumer sales contracts (for now). The new Act is considered in 
some detail in Chapter 22, together with other major new developments. There are likely 
to be further developments in the not too distant future: although the proposal for a 
Common European Sales Law (made in October 2011) was eventually abandoned in late 
2014, there are proposals for new contract law measures in the context of the European 
Union’s ‘Digital Agenda’ programme.
It might be useful to set out how we distributed the task of updating the chapters 
between us. Rick Canavan was responsible for Chapters 1–4, 6–10, 13, 14 and 16, and 
Christian Twigg-Flesner dealt with Chapters 5, 11, 12, 15, 17–21, 23 and 24, as well as 
writing the new Chapter 22 on consumer sales contracts. As with recent editions, Hector 
MacQueen added relevant developments in Scots law to all of the chapters.
As noted, the change of editorship was brought about by the sudden passing of 
John Adams. Both the new editors have a strong connection with Sheffield Law School, 
where John Adams worked for many years (we both completed undergraduate and 

postgraduate degrees there, and Christian Twigg-Flesner spent two years there as a Lec-
turer, with Rick Canavan enjoying his tutorials in Commercial Law). There was fur-
ther sad news for both editors as we were preparing this edition, when Professor Robert 
Bradgate, who taught Commercial Law at Sheffield for many years (and inspired both of 
us to focus on Commercial Law in our careers), died on 12 April 2014. It seems fitting to 
dedicate this edition to the memory of both John Adams and Rob Bradgate.
Rick Canavan 
Christian Twigg-Flesner
In what will be my final effort as Scots law editor of this book, it is with both sadness 
and pleasure that I join in the dedication of the work to the memories of John Adams 
and Rob Bradgate. Both were good friends to me over many years and their loss so close 
together is really irreparable. I am very grateful, however, to Christian Twigg-Flesner 
and Rick Canavan for their enthusiasm in picking up John’s banner, and for following 
his example of support for providing the book with a Scottish dimension. I look forward 
to seeing it develop further in future under their tutelage as still the leading student text 
on sale of goods.

Sources of the law of sale of goods
The Sale of Goods Act 1979
The focus of this book is the domestic law of sale of goods with a particular focus on 
sales of goods between non-consumers. The latter distinction has for many years been 
of some importance as a discrete approach to consumer transactions was constructed 
piecemeal within the Sale of Goods Act 1979. However, with the passing into law of 
the Consumer Rights Act 2015, a largely discrete body of law in relation to consumer 
sales has now emerged,1 although its origins in and relationship with the old law are 
clear. As will be discussed in this text, many of the amendments made to the Sale of 
Goods Act 1979 will be reversed in due course, ‘peeled away’ to create for the first time, 
a body of law applicable to the particular needs of ‘consumers’. The Consumer Rights 
Act itself is considered fully in Chapter 22. The effect of the amendments made by this 
Act will be considered where applicable throughout the text.
The domestic law of sale of goods, as it applies to non-consumers, is still to be found 
in four main sources. The first, and still by far the most important, is the Sale of Goods 
Act 1979, which consolidates (with some additional amendments) the original Sale of 
Goods Act of 1893 and amendments to it made prior to 1979. That Act has in turn been 
amended by the Sale and Supply of Goods Act 1994, the Sale of Goods (Amendment) 
Act 1994 and the Sale of Goods (Amendment) Act 1995. A range of European Directives, 
in particular that on sale of consumer goods and associated guarantees,2 required fur-
ther amendments to the Sale of Goods Act and subordinate legislation, although, as 
noted above, many of these will now take effect in the Consumer Rights Act.
Secondly, there are a number of other statutory provisions, of varying importance, 
some of which pre-date the Act of 1893 (such as the Factors Act 1889), but others of 
more recent origin, such as the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 and the Contracts 
(Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999. Thirdly, there is a considerable mass of case law 
interpreting the Act of 1893, much of which remains relevant to the interpretation of 
the Act of 1979 and, of course, there is now substantial case law on the 1979 Act itself. 
Additionally, there are some decisions of the European Court of Justice interpreting 
the various Directives and Conventions in the field. This jurisprudence is likely to grow 
in the future. Fourthly, there is still a certain amount of relevant case law which pre-
dates the Act of 1893. The importance of the old case law on points actually dealt with  
by the Act has, however, been declining for many years. The Act of 1893 was a codifying

Rights Act 2015 invokes the rules on the passing of property found in the Sale of Goods Act.
	2	 99/44/EC, OJ L171, 7/7/99 initially implemented by SI 2002/3045, which amended the Sale of Goods Act.

	
4	 Nature and formation of the contract of sale 
statute, and the proper method of interpreting such a statute was laid down by Lord 
Herschell in Bank of England v Vagliano Bros.3
I think the proper course is in the first instance to examine the language of the statute and to ask 
what is its natural meaning, uninfluenced by any considerations derived from the previous state 
of the law, and not to start with inquiring how the law previously stood, and then, assuming 
that it was probably intended to leave it unaltered, to see if the words of the enactment will 
bear an interpretation in conformity with this view. If a statute, intended to embody in a code a 
particular branch of the law, is to be treated in this fashion, it appears to me that its utility will 
be almost entirely destroyed, and the very object with which it was enacted will be frustrated. 
The purpose of such a statute surely was that on any point specifically dealt with by it, the law 
should be ascertained by interpreting the language used instead of, as before, by roaming over 
a vast number of authorities in order to discover what the law was, extracting it by a minute 
critical examination of the prior decisions.
Lord Herschell then went on to observe that in exceptional cases, reference to earlier 
decisions may still be permissible. First, where the provisions of the Act are ambiguous, 
earlier cases may help to resolve the ambiguity; and, secondly, where a term has acquired 
a technical meaning, previous cases may be cited to illustrate this meaning. It is scarcely 
necessary to add that where a point is not covered by the Act, older decisions are still 
binding and must be followed.
Despite this warning and its subsequent repetition in later cases, it cannot be said that 
it has always been taken to heart by courts or writers. Indeed, there are indications in the 
speeches in the House of Lords in Ashington Piggeries Ltd v Christopher Hill Ltd4 that 
Lord Herschell’s remarks may now need qualification. In particular, in the interpretation 
of provisions of the Act relating to implied terms, Lord Diplock said that the Act ‘ought 
not to be construed so narrowly as to force on parties to contracts for the sale of goods 
promises and consequences different from what they must reasonably have intended’.5 
More generally, it may be said that the courts have tended to treat the provisions of the 
Act as though they were part of the common law, and have not generally treated cases 
under the Act as though they were ordinary exercises in statutory interpretation.
The application of Lord Herschell’s approach in some areas is, however, more contro-
versial. For example, in the case of the former implied condition that the goods were to 
be of ‘merchantable quality’ the 1979 Act (unlike the original Act) professed to define the 
term ‘merchantable quality’,6 but the definition appeared merely to provide a framework 
or skeleton in which the normal processes of case law development might continue; thus 
it might have been thought that the meaning of the term ‘merchantable quality’ would 
continue to be found in the case law and there were indeed many cases which proceeded 
on this basis. But (as we shall see) the Court of Appeal in Rogers v Parish (Scarborough) 
Ltd7 insisted that this mass of case law should be jettisoned, and the words of the 1979 
Act alone looked to in the decision of cases on the meaning of the term ‘merchantable

they apply to all codifying statutes alike.

quality’. The merchantable quality warranty was replaced in 1994 by a new requirement 
that goods are to be of ‘satisfactory quality’8 and the question of whether this change 
justified once again a fresh start was raised. For reasons given later, it seems an approach 
which ignores the previous case law whether on the old merchantable quality provisions 
or on other parts of the Act is likely to produce arbitrary and unpredictable decisions, 
and any attempt to apply Lord Herschell’s approach literally must at least take account 
of the variety of reasons which may inspire the legislature to codify different provisions 
of the common law.9
Another problem arising from Lord Herschell’s approach is that this method of 
interpretation is not sufficiently adaptable to be used in the interpretation of legisla-
tion which clearly departs from general common law principles. This means that every 
statutory amendment of the law of sale of goods either opens up a wedge between the 
law of sale and the law applicable to closely analogous contracts, or it has to be followed 
by or accompanied by parallel legislation applicable to these other contracts. But if, 
when this new legislation is proposed, there are second thoughts about the earlier legis-
lation amending the law of sale, the result is likely to be yet further amendments to the 
law of sale. The result is that the law of sale and the law of similar contracts are engaged 
in a sort of leap-frog exercise which sometimes makes it troublesome to identify the pre-
cise effect of modern legislation at any given moment. And it also means that arbitrary 
distinctions sometimes have to be drawn between cases according to the precise type 
of contract involved – sale of goods contracts sometimes being affected by legislation 
which does not apply to other closely similar transactions.
In addition to the law of sale of goods in the strict sense, there is, of course, the 
general body of the law against which a codifying statute has to be understood and, in 
particular, the general law of contract. The Sale of Goods Act makes no attempt to cod-
ify the general principles of contract law. Indeed, it expressly leaves them untouched, for 
s. 62(2) enacts that:
The rules of the common law, including the law merchant except in so far as they are 
inconsistent with the provisions of this Act and in particular the rules relating to the law of 
principal and agent and the effect of fraud, misrepresentation, duress or coercion, mistake, or 
other invalidating cause, apply to contracts for the sale of goods.
Despite this section, no exposition of this subject would be complete without some 
account of the general rules of the law of contract insofar as they have some special 
bearing on the law of sale of goods.
The Sale of Goods Act was made applicable to Scotland in 1893 as a result of pres-
sure in some commercial and legal quarters for the creation of a more uniform law of 
sale in the United Kingdom.10 This was achieved with the addition of only a very few 
sections to the English codification statute as originally drafted. The Act is thus not a

	9	 These different approaches were thoroughly canvassed in the Law Commissions’ Joint Working Paper 
No. 85, Sale and Supply of Goods (1983) which explored various proposals for altering the definition of 
‘merchantable quality’. The Final Report of the Law Commissions, Sale and Supply of Goods (Law Com. 
No. 160, Scot. Law Com. No. 104, 1987, Cm. 137), appeared to retreat somewhat from the position arrived 
at in the Working Paper.

codification in any sense of the pre-existing Scots common law, but was rather a very sig-
nificant change, given the Roman law roots of that law. This was particularly the case in 
respect of the transfer of property and, albeit to a less fundamental extent, the duties of 
the seller and the remedies of the buyer.11 The Act’s English terminology also caused dif-
ficulties in Scotland, although these have mostly been removed by the reforms of the Sale 
and Supply of Goods Act 1994, in which the Scottish Law Commission played a large 
part. A distinguished Scottish commentator once argued that ‘the task of the Scots courts 
is . . . to bring the statutory provisions into harmony with the principles of our common 
law’;12 but this has not been the approach of the judges or of other writers in Scotland, 
who have preferred generally to start with the text of the statute, imperfect and sometimes 
difficult to understand though it may be from the perspective of Scots law.
As will appear during the course of this book, the Sale of Goods Act has not proved 
one of the more successful pieces of codification undertaken by Parliament towards the 
end of the nineteenth century.13 The principal reason for this may well be that there has 
been a change in the type of sale of goods cases coming before the courts, and the types 
of cases, more generally, coming to legal attention. The nineteenth-century cases on 
which the Act was based were, in the main, sales between businessmen or organisations, 
that is, sales by manufacturers and suppliers. Since the passing of the 1893 Act, how-
ever, a large proportion of the cases coming before the courts appear to be concerned 
with sales by retailers to the consuming public. The passing of the Consumer Rights Act 
2015 (which extends to Scotland) will now stem this flow and in any case, the volume 
was never great as the value of these transactions often made litigation unwarranted.14 
Even still, the increasingly vociferous demands of consumers and consumer groups have 
had an impact on the shape of the Act and the judicial understanding of it. Not least in 
highlighting that the term ‘merchantable quality’ was not an appropriate one, and one 
ultimately cast aside by Sale and Supply of Goods Act 1994.
The status of the ‘consumer’ case law which accrued prior to the Consumer Rights 
Act may now be the subject of question; however, it would seem unlikely that it would 
be cast aside. The standards which a consumer buyer might expect of a car are unlikely 
to be different to those expected by a commercial buyer, irrespective of whether the com-
mercial buyer is buying for the purposes of re-sale or not.
Finally it should be noted that at the beginning of 2009, the Draft Common Frame of 
Reference (DCFR) was published. The text was the result of the work of a broad range of 
private law scholars from the member states of the European Union, and it presents itself 
as an ‘academic’ document, committed to the precepts of scholarship rather than politics. 
Notwithstanding its unwieldy name, the text is nothing less than the draft of the central 
components of a European Civil Code. The sales law aspect of the DCFR was derived 
in no small part from the Vienna Convention on International Sales of Goods (CISG), 
which is dealt with in Chapter 17. The sales law aspect of the DCFR emerged as the

ous potential difficulties of a single market with such a plurality of sales law systems. At 
the time of writing, however, and despite agreement amongst MEPs, without the support 
of the Council of Ministers, the proposal has now been withdrawn with a fresh consul-
tation on a revised proposal focusing on online transactions due to follow. It is expected 
that it will build upon the CESL but will better address the challenges posed by online, 
cross-border sales, as well as the issues raised by the European Parliament. Whatever its 
fate, it seems likely that at some point, in some form, most likely on an ‘opt-in’ basis, 
some form of EU-wide sales law will be promulgated.

The contract of sale
Definition
Section 2(1) of the Act defines a contract of sale of goods as:
a contract by which the seller transfers or agrees to transfer the property in goods to the buyer 
for a money consideration, called the price.
Subsections (3) and (4) give different names to two transactions:
(3)	 Where under a contract of sale the property in the goods is transferred from the seller to 
the buyer the contract is called a sale.
(4)	 Where under a contract of sale the transfer of the property in the goods is to take place 
at a future time or subject to some condition later to be fulfilled the contract is called an 
agreement to sell.
Sale distinguished from other contracts
A contract of sale of goods must be distinguished from several other transactions which 
are normally quite different from a sale of goods but which, in particular circumstances, 
may closely resemble such a contract,1 namely (1) a contract of barter or exchange, (2) a 
gift, (3) a contract of bailment, (4) a contract of hire-purchase, (5) a contract of loan on 
the security of goods, (6) a contract for the supply of services, (7) a contract of agency, 
and (8) licences of intellectual property such as ‘sales’ of computer software.2 These dis-
tinctions were at one time of importance mainly in connection with s. 4 of the 1893 Act. 
This section, which was originally part of s. 17 of the Statute of Frauds 1677 and was 
not applicable in Scotland, required contracts of sale of goods of the value of £10 and 
upwards to be evidenced in writing, whereas for the other types of contract listed above 
there was no such requirement. Since the repeal of s. 4 by the Law Reform (Enforcement 
of Contracts) Act 1954, this particular point has ceased to be of importance in relation 
to domestic sales of goods3 because no written formalities are now required in general 
	1	 In early editions of this book, a contract for the transfer of a possessory interest in a chattel was also 
distinguished from a sale of goods. As a result of amendments first made by the Supply of Goods (Implied 
Terms) Act 1973, such a contract should be treated as a sale of goods – see below, p. 91.
	2	 Which are usually licences of the copyright in the software and are independent of the media in which 
the software is embedded – see below, pp. 53–58. The distinction between sales and licences of intellectual 
property, such as computer software, is dealt with in Chapter 3.
	3	 An equivalent provision is still to be found in many of the Commonwealth statutes based on the 1893 Act, however, 
as well as in the Uniform Commercial Code Art. 2-201. When it exists, this requirement presents a problem when 
contracts are effected by e-mail – see Chapter 22. The Vienna Convention 1980, Arts 12 and 96, permit a state to 
require formalities where any party has his place of business in such a state – see Chapter 17.

	
	 	
The contract of sale	 9
for any of the above kinds of contracts.4 But it may still be necessary to decide whether 
a contract is a contract of sale of goods for one of a number of other reasons. In par-
ticular, of course, the provisions of the Sale of Goods Act apply only to such contracts. 
Given that the original Act of 1893 was largely a codifying Act, however, and given the 
tendency to construe the Act as though it were a part of the common law, it will often be 
immaterial whether a particular contract is labelled a contract of sale or a contract of a 
different character. In particular, when a question of implication of terms arises, the law 
may well be the same whether or not the Act applies. Indeed, there has been a noticeable 
tendency, first for the courts and then for Parliament, to model the common law con-
tracts on the Sale of Goods Act and, in particular, to imply terms in these contracts very 
similar to those implied by the Act.5
In Young & Marten Ltd v McManus Childs Ltd,6 the House of Lords expressed 
strong views on the undesirability of drawing unnecessary ­distinctions between 
different classes of contract. However, the structure of particular commercial 
transactions, as well as the legislative structure of the law sometimes makes this 
an inescapable result.
In respect of the latter, as we shall see later,7 there are, for example, a number of pro-
visions in the Sale of Goods Act (originating in the Factors Act 1889) enabling a person, 
subject to various conditions, to pass a good title to goods even if he does not own them, 
provided that he has agreed to buy them. This legislative formula clearly excludes cases 
in which the contract involves the acquisition of the goods without an agreement to buy. 
And we shall see recent examples of cases in which this distinction is critical to the result 
of a legal dispute.
Moreover, as noted above, even the most recent (notwithstanding the Consumer 
Rights Act 2015) legislation applicable to sales and other contracts is not always, at 
any given moment, identical because sometimes the law applicable to one type of con-
tract (usually sale) is amended first and the others at a later date. In any case, since the 
changes made by these Acts and subordinate legislation are clearly not declaratory, it 
is difficult to see how the courts could modify the law relating to these other contracts 
to keep them in line with contracts of sale. However, care has been taken in the most 
recent legislation to treat contracts of sale of goods and other similar transactions in 
the same way, subject only to necessary modifications. It is, therefore, probable that 
the distinction between the different types of contract will only be of practical impor-
tance in relatively unusual circumstances.
In cases under s. 4, it was necessary to draw a firm line between contracts of sale and 
other types of contract, but for other purposes, there seems no reason why it should 
not sometimes be possible to hold that a contract is partly a contract of sale and partly 
	4	 Assignments, though not licences, of copyright, e.g., in software, must, however, be evidenced in writing – 
Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, s. 90(3) (and the same is true for registered intellectual property 
rights). Hire-purchase contracts must comply with the statutory formalities now to be found in the 
Consumer Credit Act 1974 and its subordinate legislation.

something else.8 Thus a contract for the provision of a meal in a hotel is apparently a 
contract of sale,9 and so is a contract for the construction of machinery.10 Yet such con-
tracts in some sense also involve the provision of services, and it seems clear that the 
law relating to the goods and the law relating to the services aspects of such a contract 
may differ. For instance, under the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982 the supplier’s 
duties as regards any goods supplied under the contract will normally be strict (i.e. it 
will be liable for defects in the goods even if it has not been negligent), whereas its lia-
bility in respect of services may be a liability, in effect, for negligence only. As will be 
seen later, this problem of distinguishing between sales and supplies of goods on the one 
hand, and supplies of services on the other, has historically given rise to considerable dif-
ficulties in relation to contracts for the provision of computer software,11 now partially 
remedied by Consumer Rights Act 2015,12 and there are problems relating to contracts 
for the supply and installation of goods in relation to the sale of consumer goods and 
associated guarantees directive.13
Before considering the distinction between contracts of sale and the other types of 
contract mentioned above, it must be emphasised that a contract of sale must first and 
foremost be a contract, and that the concept of a contract under the various legislation 
is the same as the concept understood in the law at large, that is, a consensual transac-
tion based on an agreement to buy and an agreement to sell.14 Thus, for example, where 
an out-patient at a hospital obtains drugs at the hospital dispensary, even on payment 
of a statutory prescription charge, this is not a contract of sale at all. The patient has a 
statutory right to receive the drug and the hospital a statutory obligation to supply it.15 
It seems the position is the same with respect to drugs and other medical appliances 
supplied by a pharmacist under the National Health Service.16 Since the transaction is 
not a sale of goods, the Sale of Goods Act cannot apply; and since it is not a contract at 
all, it presumably follows that the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982 also does not 
apply.17 But it is possible that the courts might still be willing to imply terms as to quality 
	8	 See, e.g., Hyundai Heavy Industries Co Ltd v Papadopoulos [1980] 1 WLR 1129, discussed below, where 
this possibility is clearly recognised by the House of Lords (contract for manufacture of ship may be both 
contract of sale of goods and contract for services). See also Watson v Buckley [1940] 1 All ER 174; Stocznia 
Gdanska SA v Latvian Shipping Co [1998] UKHL 9; Costigan v Cook t/a World of Heat, The Fireplace 2005 
GWD 34-637 (Sheriff W. L. Holligan).

one of services, but a take-away meal as a supply of goods. In Martin v Thomson Tour Operators Current 
Law, August 1999, it was held that the duty of a tour operator to a consumer poisoned by food supplied 
under the contract was merely to exercise reasonable care and skill. This decision is almost certainly wrong 
because a contract for a package holiday including meals is surely a contract for the transfer of goods 
within Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982, s. 4? As to the liability of an agent where the identity of the 
principal is not disclosed (as will usually be the case in package holiday contracts) see 2(1) Halsbury’s Laws

and fitness in such a transaction,18 though this could open up an anomalous result. It 
would mean that an out-patient who is supplied with a drug, like a patient who obtains 
a National Health Service drug from a pharmacist, would be able to sue if the drug 
was defective even if the supplier was not guilty of negligence. On the other hand, an 
in-patient who is supplied with a drug as an incident to the hospital’s supply of services 
(whether a paying patient or an NHS patient) might not be able to sue in the absence of 
negligence.19 It must be noted, however, that an injured patient might well have a remedy 
in such cases under the Consumer Protection Act 1987.20
Sale and exchange
The fact that the consideration must be in money, and that the term ‘goods’ is defined 
by s. 61 so as to exclude money, serves to distinguish a sale from a contract of barter or 
exchange in the ordinary case. But a coin which is a collector’s item may be ‘goods’ even 
though it is legal tender, and there may be a sale of such a coin. In such an event, the coin 
does not possess the usual negotiable qualities of money, and if the sale is by a thief he 
cannot pass a good title to it.21
The position is less clear where goods on the one hand are exchanged for goods plus 
money on the other, as is commonly the case when a used car is traded in part exchange 
for a new one. Is this a contract of sale or of exchange? In Aldridge v Johnson22 a con-
tract for the exchange of 52 bullocks with 100 quarters of barley, the difference in value 
to be made up in money, was treated without argument as a contract of sale, but the 
case was fought on an entirely different point.23 One view is that the answer depends upon 
whether the money or the goods is the substantial consideration. The decision in Rob-
inson v Graves24 lays down an elastic test of this nature for distinguishing contracts of 
sale from contracts for skill and labour, and a similar approach may sometimes be justi-
fied here. It should be noted, however, that in relation to the implied warranties,25 Part I 
of the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982 (applied to Scotland under the Sale and 
Supply of Goods Act 1994) renders the distinction largely of academic importance,26 
and there is an alternative to barter as a way of analysing the used car trade-in type of 
transaction.27

	 12	 Nature and formation of the contract of sale
However, the proper characterisation of a contract depends, in the last resort, on the 
intention of the parties so long only as they do not include provisions manifestly incon-
sistent with the intended nature of the transaction.28 So, it may well be that, if the parties 
envisage the transaction as a sale and use terminology more appropriate to a sale, the 
contract would be held to be such even if the substantial consideration is supplied in 
goods rather than money. In the motor trade, for example, it is a common occurrence for 
a person to ‘trade in’ an old car in part-exchange for a new one and, if the transaction 
relating to the new car is treated by the parties as a sale, it is improbable that the courts 
would treat it as anything else, even if the dealer’s ‘allowance’ for the traded-in car does 
not fall far short of the price of the new one.29 It seems that the transaction relating to 
the old car would also amount to a sale even though no money actually passes if, as is 
usual, the parties fix a notional price which is set off against the price of the new car. But 
it has been held in the Republic of Ireland that if no price is allocated to the old car, the 
whole transaction is one of barter, or exchange, and not sale.30
As noted above, a contract of exchange of goods for goods (or even of goods for some 
other consideration such as shares or land) is a contract for the transfer of goods within the 
Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982.31 This Act incorporates into such a contract terms 
almost identical to those applying to a contract of sale; so if the question is one concerning 
the quality or fitness of goods supplied, it will in future be of very little importance whether 
the goods are supplied under a contract of sale or a contract of exchange.
Sale and gift
Usually, there is no difficulty in distinguishing between a sale and a gift. A gift is a trans-
fer of property without any consideration and as such it is, of course, not binding while 
it remains executory unless made by deed.32 But difficulty may sometimes arise with 
regard to transactions in which a ‘free’ gift is offered on the condition of entering into 
some other transaction. In Esso Petroleum Ltd v Commissioners of Customs & Excise,33 
garages selling petrol advertised a ‘free’ gift of a coin (bearing a likeness of a footballer) 
to anyone buying four gallons. It was held by the House of Lords that, although the 
transaction was not a gift, inasmuch as the garage was contractually bound to supply 
28	 See Street v Mountford [1985] AC 809 and A G Securities v Vaughan [1988] 3 All ER 1058 where the House 
of Lords settled the approach to be adopted in the analogous case of an agreement designed to be a lease but 
dressed up to look like a licence.

30	 Flynn v Mackin [1974] IR 101, criticised in a note in (1976) 39 MLR 589. The reason why the distinction was 
of practical importance in this case was that it was assumed that the property passes at different times in the 
two transactions. But if the contract is so close to the border between two classes of contract, it would seem 
absurd if such consequences were held to depend on the label attached to the contract, though sometimes 
this may be inevitable.

The contract of sale	 13
the coin to anyone buying four gallons of petrol, it was not a sale of goods either. The 
transaction was characterised by Lord Simon and Lord Wilberforce as one in which the 
garage promised to supply a coin in consideration of a customer buying the petrol. It 
was thus, in substance, a collateral contract existing alongside the contract for the sale 
of the petrol.34 On this analysis, it would presumably be a contract for the transfer of 
goods within the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982, which is dealt with later.
An unsolicited offer to sell goods, accompanied by a delivery of those goods to the 
offeree, may be treated as a gift in the circumstances laid down in the Unsolicited Goods 
and Services Act 1971. This deemed gift now takes place immediately and the rights of 
the sender are extinguished.35
Sale and bailment
A bailment is a transaction under which goods are delivered by one party (the bailor) to 
another (the bailee) on terms which normally require the bailee to hold the goods and ulti-
mately to redeliver them to the bailor or in accordance with his directions. The property in the 
goods is not intended to and does not pass on delivery, though it may sometimes be the inten-
tion of the parties that it should pass in due course, as in the case of the ordinary hire-pur-
chase contract. But where goods are delivered to another on terms which indicate that the 
property is to pass at once, the contract must be one of sale and not bailment. In Chapman 
Bros v Verco Bros & Co Ltd,36 farmers delivered bags of wheat to a company carrying on 
business as millers and wheat merchants. The wheat was delivered in unidentified bags which 
were identical to those in which other farmers delivered wheat to the company. The terms of 
the transaction required the company to buy and pay for the wheat on request by the farmer 
or failing such a request, on a specified date, to return an equal quantity of wheat of the same 
type; but there was no obligation to return the identical bags. Although the contract referred 
to the company as ‘storers’, it was held by the Australian High Court that this transaction was 
necessarily one of sale as the property passed to the company on delivery.
Similarly, if the nature of the transaction is such that the property must pass (even if 
not at once) the transaction seems inconsistent with the possibility of a bailment. It will 
be an ‘agreement to sell’ within s. 2(5) of the Act. If the goods are delivered to the buyer 
before the property passes, he will be a ‘buyer in possession’ rather than a mere bailee.
Scots law does not know the terminology of bailment but speaks rather of the contract of 
deposit, under which the owner of an item places it in the custody of another, imposing on 
that other obligations to provide a secure place of custody and to exercise due care to prevent 
the loss of or damage to the property. Deposit is usually contrasted with hire and loan, under 
which the possessor has the use of the article hired or lent, and not just custody.37

	 14	 Nature and formation of the contract of sale
As a result of the widespread use of Romalpa38 (or retention of title) clauses in contracts 
for the supply of goods, the distinction between a sale and a bailment has gained renewed 
importance. These clauses take a variety of forms, but their purpose is always to allow a 
seller of goods to treat the goods as his property even after they have been delivered, as a 
sort of security for the payment of the price. In substance, these are contracts of sale in 
which, however, the seller claims that the delivery of the goods is, in the first instance, by 
way of bailment only. In some cases, the clauses go further and provide that even though 
the ‘buyer’ may deal with the goods (for instance, by using them in a process of manufac-
ture, or by reselling them), the original supplier is to be entitled to (or to a charge upon) 
any goods manufactured with the goods supplied, or to (or to a charge on) the proceeds of 
resale when received by the ‘buyer’. These clauses continue to give rise to some legal diffi-
culty and are considered at greater length later.39 Here it is enough to say that any bailment 
will be limited to the actual goods delivered. An attempt to extend the seller’s security 
interest into goods manufactured using the goods delivered is liable to give rise to a charge 
registrable under the Companies Act 2006, s. 860,40 as where resin was supplied for use in 
the manufacture of chipboard.41 The result of this is that, prima facie at least, the seller 
can have no right to trace the goods supplied when they have once been used or resold. On 
the other hand, if the contract involves a true bailment,42 the seller probably has rights over 
any goods made with the goods supplied, or over the proceeds of the sale, where they have 
been resold, although even this is not entirely free from doubt.43
A contract of hire is one species of bailment;44 such contracts are readily distinguish-
able from sales since there is no intention that property should pass in a hiring contract. 
The Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982 contains implied terms applicable to a con-
tract of hire which are similar to, though not identical with, those in a contract of sale; 
it is also possible to exclude these terms by contrary agreement so long as they com-
ply with the ‘reasonableness’ requirement under the Unfair Contracts Terms Act 1977, 
although this is not always possible in contracts of sale.45
Sale and hire-purchase
Contracts of hire-purchase resemble contracts of sale very closely, and, indeed, in prac-
tically all cases of hire-purchase the ultimate sale of the goods is (in a popular sense) 
the real object of the transaction. Nonetheless, for present purposes, the legal distinc-
tion is clear and important, though its importance has greatly diminished since the 
Sale of Goods (Implied Terms) Act 1973,46 and the Consumer Credit Act 1974. A sale

purchase contracts and those in sales of goods. The relevant provisions of this Act were replaced by the

Act 1974, Sch. 4 and the Sale and Supply of Goods Act 1994) and see p. 18–19 below.

	
	 	
The contract of sale	 15
is a contract whereby the seller ‘transfers or agrees to transfer’ the property in goods 
to the buyer; that is to say, as soon as the contract is made the ultimate destination of 
the goods is determined even though the property is not to pass for some considerable 
time; for example, until all the instalments of the price have been paid. A contract of 
hire-purchase, on the other hand, is a bailment of the goods coupled with an option to 
purchase them, which may or may not be exercised. Only if and when the option is exer-
cised will there be a contract of sale.
The similarity between the two transactions is accentuated by the artificial nature of 
most hire-purchase agreements. This is brought out by consideration of three points. 
First, as already observed, the real object of a contract of hire-purchase is almost invar-
iably the ultimate sale of the goods to the hirer. Secondly, the amount which the hirer is 
bound to pay under the contract is usually far in excess of that which he would have had 
to pay if he were really hiring the goods.47 And thirdly, the legal purchase price for which 
the hirer has the option to buy the goods is frequently nominal only and, in fact, is some-
times not exacted in practice. Moreover, for the purposes of the hirer claiming capital 
allowances, hire-purchase transactions in respect of machinery or plant are treated in the 
same way as outright purchases.48
There is a further practical complication about hire-purchase contracts which often 
makes them different from contracts of sale. A transaction under which a person ‘buys’ 
goods on hire-purchase is often, and in the motor trade is usually, a complex transaction 
involving three and not two parties. Many retailers have no wish to act as financiers 
themselves supplying credit to consumers. So a hire-purchase transaction often involves, 
first, a sale, under which the retailer sells the goods to a finance company, and then, 
secondly, a hire-purchase contract, under which the finance company lets the goods on 
hire-purchase terms to the ‘buyer’. It follows that the ‘buyer’ has no contractual relations 
with the seller and this sometimes has important legal consequences, although the reality 
is that ‘the identity or even existence of the finance company is a matter (to customers) 
of indifference; they look to the dealer, or his representative, as the person who fixes the 
payment terms and makes all the necessary arrangements’.49 Nevertheless, it means, for 
instance, that the seller cannot be sued on the terms implied by the Sale of Goods Act, 
which create liability even in the absence of negligence,50 although he may sometimes be 
liable in tort if negligence can be proved against him.51 And if the seller gives an express 
warranty to the ‘buyer’, in consideration of which the latter enters into the contract of 
hire-purchase with the finance company to which the seller has sold the goods, then the 
seller can be held liable on this separate contract of guarantee.52 The finance company

may also be liable on the terms implied by the Supply of Goods Act 1973. Since the Con-
sumer Credit Act 1974, it would be more correct to refer to the hirer as the debtor and to 
the seller as the supplier, but the principles themselves are not changed.53
Hire-purchase contracts were developed in England and Wales towards the end of the 
nineteenth century, and it is impossible to understand why they came into existence with-
out an appreciation of the legal context which already existed. There was clearly a need 
for a form of contract of sale of goods on credit, under which the seller could reserve 
some security right to the goods. Consumers wanted to buy on credit, and financiers 
who were willing to supply the credit wanted security. Two obstacles existed to achieving 
this desired end through the most obvious legal methods. One obvious method would 
have been for the seller simply to sell and deliver the goods on credit while expressly 
stipulating that the property in the goods should remain his until the buyer had paid the 
price. This is a conditional sale, and it does give the seller some security: it protects him 
against the possibility of the buyer’s insolvency. But it does not protect him against the 
possibility that the buyer may sell the goods to a third party before he has paid the whole 
price. Even though the seller has reserved the property in the goods, s. 25(1) of the Sale 
of Goods Act enables a person who has ‘bought or agreed to buy goods’ to pass a good 
title to a third party. In Lee v Butler,54 the Court of Appeal held that the equivalent of 
this provision55 clearly applied where the buyer was in possession of the goods under an 
agreement to buy the goods and pay the price in instalments. So, this obvious method of 
selling goods on credit failed to give the seller adequate security.
A second obvious method of achieving the desired result was for the seller to sell and 
deliver the goods outright to the buyer but to require the buyer to grant him a mortgage, 
or charge, or a right to repossess the goods in the event of the buyer’s failure to pay the 
instalments. At common law, it was possible to create a charge of this nature on goods 
which would be binding even on third parties. Most probably, a legal arrangement of 
this nature would still have been caught by s. 25 of the Sale of Goods Act, but there was 
a more fundamental objection to this device. The whole essence of this scheme is that 
one person, the buyer (A), should have the possession of goods and be entitled to the use 
of them as though he were the owner, while another person, the financier (B), should 
actually have a charge or mortgage on the goods. Now this kind of transaction is one 
which is frowned upon by the law because third parties may be induced to do business 
with, or give credit to, A in the belief that he is the unencumbered owner of the goods in 
question. And if A becomes insolvent, they will then find that B has a prior claim to the 
goods. It is generally thought to be unfair that B should be able to do this unless he has 
in some way publicised his transaction with A. Accordingly, in England the Bills of Sale 
Acts of 1878 and 1882 require a transaction of this kind to be made by a written instru-
ment, called a bill of sale, which is required to be registered under the Acts.
The Bills of Sale Acts had two great disadvantages. First, they required some degree 
of publicity – that was their whole purpose, of course – and many borrowers disliked 
this requirement. But secondly, they rapidly attracted a body of extremely technical case 
53	 The effect of s. 56 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 is that in regulated agreements the supplier is the agent 
of the finance house for all purposes connected with the transaction.

The contract of sale	 17
law, and it became easy to fall foul of the Acts by accident so that the security granted 
(and in some cases the right to interest also) might become void.56
The result of these difficulties was a search for a legal form of sale which enabled the 
seller to retain security in the goods without falling foul of the Bills of Sale Acts and 
which also gave protection against bona fide purchasers from the buyer. The contract of 
hire-purchase was the answer, and its efficacy was upheld by the House of Lords in two 
cases in 1895. In Helby v Matthews,57 it was held that a person in possession of goods 
under a hire-purchase agreement had not ‘bought or agreed to buy’ them within the 
meaning of s. 25(2) (now s. 25(1)) of the Sale of Goods Act. This meant that the buyer, 
or the ‘hirer’ as it now became more correct to call him, could not dispose of the goods 
to a third party in contravention of the agreement, and the seller’s (or ‘owner’s’) secu-
rity was thus fully protected. And in McEntire v Crossley Bros58 it was also held that a 
hire-purchase contract did not fall within the Bills of Sale Acts; those Acts, it was held, 
applied only where an owner of goods granted a charge, or right to seize the goods, to 
another party, while in the hire-purchase contract the hirer was not owner at the time he 
granted the right to seize the goods.
With the blessing of the House of Lords to the legal arrangements, the way was paved 
for the great commercial expansion of the use of hire-purchase contracts. For the next 
40 years, the use of the contract spread throughout the entire field of consumer purchas-
ing of goods, other than purely consumable or perishable goods; and it also began to be 
used in some commercial situations.
As time went on, it became increasingly obvious that the contract of hire-purchase 
was being used as a form (in effect) of secured sale. Instead of borrowing the money to 
buy the goods and mortgaging the goods to the lender as a security, the consumer entered 
into a hire-purchase contract with the financier. While this achieved similar results from 
the financier’s point of view, at least in the sense that it gave it the security it wanted, it 
created a good deal of difficulty because the legal form of the transaction did not reflect 
the fact that, as a sort of mortgagor (though not, of course, in strict law), the hirer had 
an ‘equity’ in the goods. In land law, it has for centuries been recognised that a mortgage 
is a security device (no matter what its form) and that the mortgagor has an ‘equity’ in 
the land mortgaged. This ‘equity’ means that for most purposes the mortgagor is treated 
as owner of the land and the mortgagee’s interests are confined to using the land as a 
security for repayment of the loan. So long as the mortgagee obtains repayment, plus 
interest, the mortgagor is always entitled to the residuary ‘equity’. These familiar princi-
ples of the land law were never recognised as applicable to hire-purchase contracts; and 
so long as total freedom of contract prevailed, much hardship to the consumer resulted. 
For example, if the hirer paid nine-tenths of the price and defaulted in payment of the 
final instalment, the finance company might seize the goods and resell them, retaining 
the proceeds for itself.
Abuses of this kind led to the gradual legislative recognition of the hirer’s equity, 
though not by that term, nor by the same methods as equity had brought to bear on 
56	 The Crowther Committee 1971 (Cmnd 4596) recommended their abolition, along with the Hire-Purchase 
Acts and other measures, and replacement by a Lending and Security Act – see below, p. 18.

mortgages of land. These reforms began with the Hire-Purchase Act 1938, and were 
greatly extended and strengthened in the Hire-Purchase Acts of 1964 and 1965. But 
these reforms did not touch one basic problem, that the form of the hire-purchase con-
tract was recognised as creating a sharp difference between a hire-purchase and a sale 
of goods. The law distinguished between the legal rights and duties of a consumer who 
borrowed money to buy goods, and one who bought them on credit, or acquired them 
under a hire-purchase contract.
A movement for reform began to attract support under which hire-purchase con-
tracts, as a separate legal contract, would be abolished. If a person wanted to buy goods 
by instalments he would, in law, buy those goods under a contract of sale of goods; if 
he did not have the cash to pay the full price down, he could borrow the money from 
a third party (such as a finance company or a bank) or, alternatively, he could buy on 
credit from the actual seller. If necessary, the law could then provide some simple process 
to enable the buyer to ‘mortgage’ the goods to the lender by way of security. This move-
ment for reform began to grow after the general adoption throughout the United States 
of the Uniform Commercial Code, Article 9 of which proceeded along these lines. Then 
in 1971, the Crowther Committee on Consumer Credit examined this problem at length 
as part of a general inquiry into the whole field of consumer credit.59 This Committee 
proposed the abolition of hire-purchase contracts and the enactment of legislation along 
lines similar to those of the American Uniform Commercial Code. This recommenda-
tion was not wholly accepted by the government. Partly because there was some disa-
greement with the idea that a hire-purchase agreement was always based on a ‘fiction’, 
and partly because the public and the trade were familiar with the concept, it was felt to 
be going too far to abolish the contract altogether. Consequently, the Consumer Credit 
Act 1974 retained the hire-purchase contract.
It is, however, very important to appreciate that, although the name and form of 
hire-purchase as a distinct contract have been retained, the substance of the matter is 
very different. The Hire-Purchase Acts have been almost entirely repealed by the Con-
sumer Credit Act, and the rights and duties of the parties involved in a hire-purchase 
contract now differ hardly at all from those of parties to a sale of goods in which the 
consumer has obtained credit, whether from the seller or a third party. The principal 
remaining differences are those noted at the beginning of this section.60
The Crowther Committee’s recommendations as to the law relating to the use of 
chattels as security have never been implemented, though further examination by the 
government did take place.61 In the meantime, a contract of hire-purchase (or of con-
ditional sale) remains the principal method by which a financier or seller can reserve a 
security interest in the goods sold; a sale on credit, without any reservation of property, 
means that the seller retains no security rights in the goods.

The contract of sale	 19
by instalments62 is, for most purposes, assimilated to a hire-purchase agreement, with 
the result that a ‘sale’ of goods in which the price is payable by instalments can now take 
only one of two forms.
1	 The contract may be a genuine contract of sale in which the buyer is bound to buy 
and to pay the whole price, and the seller is bound to sell. The property in the goods 
will pass at once with a purely personal obligation to pay the price in instalments. 
In this case, there is an absolute contract of sale, and obviously the buyer can pass a 
good title to a third party; and, should he go bankrupt, the seller has no claim to the 
goods. The seller has no security right to the goods themselves.
2	 Alternatively, the passing of the property may be made conditional on the payment of a 
number of instalments. Under the Hire-Purchase Act 1965, it made virtually no differ-
ence whether this transaction was drafted as a sale or in the traditional form of a con-
tract of hire, together with an option to purchase. Since the Supply of Goods (Implied 
Terms) Act 1973, this has no longer been wholly true. Today the sections in the 1979 Act 
dealing with sales, and not those in the 197363 Act dealing with hire-purchase, apply to 
conditional sales. But this is of little moment because the wording of the two sets of pro-
visions is virtually identical. It therefore remains true to say that for most purposes there 
is now no distinction between a conditional sale and a hire-purchase contract. In either 
event, the agreement takes effect as a hire-purchase agreement and the ‘buyer’ is unable 
to pass a good title to the goods should he purport to sell them before the property has 
vested in him. The exception for motor vehicles also applies in both cases.64 Again, in 
either event, the property remains in the seller (in the one case, until the condition is sat-
isfied; in the other, till the option is exercised) and the seller would be able to claim the 
goods should the buyer become bankrupt before the property has vested in him.
As mentioned above, it is now quite common to find reservation of title clauses in 
sales made to commercial bodies (as distinct from consumer sales) and these clauses 
are, in some respects, similar (at least in general purpose though not in legal form) to 
hire-purchase contracts. They are similar in that their purpose is to give the seller some 
security where the goods are delivered before the price has been paid; this security is not 
as extensive as that obtained by a hire-purchase contract because it only protects the 
seller against the risk of the buyer’s insolvency. As seen above, it does not protect the 
seller against the risk that the buyer may resell the goods without authority. Reservation 
of title clauses also differ from hire-purchase agreements in that the latter do contem-
plate some sort of hiring arrangement under which the hirer will be allowed to use the 
goods. Reservation of title clauses do not involve any element of hiring, though they do 
often contemplate that the buyer may use the goods in a different sense, that is, may use 
them in the course of manufacture; for example, may use leather to make handbags or 
may use resin to make chipboard.65
62	 But not a sale where title is reserved against payment of the price in one instalment – Consumer Credit Act 
1974, Sch. 4, para. 4 – see below.
63	 In fact the relevant sections derive from Sch. 4 to the Consumer Credit Act 1974, which amends the 1973 
Act, and further amendments effected by the Sale and Supply of Goods Act 1994.

	 20	 Nature and formation of the contract of sale
Sale and loan on security
Parties sometimes enter into, or go through the motions of entering into, a contract to 
sell goods with the intention of using the goods as a security for a loan of money. If 
the owner of goods (A) wishes to borrow money on the security of the goods, he may 
charge or mortgage them to B on the understanding that (1) A will retain possession of 
the goods, (2) A will repay B what he or she has borrowed together with interest, and 
(3) B will have a right to take the goods from A if and only if A fails to repay the loan 
or interest at the agreed time. Such a transaction differs from a hire-purchase contract, 
which is designed to enable a person to acquire goods on credit. A loan on security is 
designed to enable someone who already owns goods to borrow money on the security of 
the goods.
Partly in order to evade the Bills of Sale Acts, but partly for other reasons, parties 
sometimes enter into this kind of transaction in the form of a sale – thus A can ‘sell’ his 
or her goods to B, though retaining possession of them and only giving B the right to 
seize them in certain events. In modern times, this kind of transaction is almost invaria-
bly reinforced with a hire-purchase agreement, or (in commercial transactions) a ‘lease-
back’. A ‘sells’ the goods (usually a motor vehicle) to B for a cash price and then B lets 
the same vehicle back to A under a hire-purchase contract. Or a manufacturing com-
pany may ‘sell’ plant or machinery to a finance company which then ‘leases’ the goods 
back to the manufacturers. Under s. 62(4) of the Sale of Goods Act:
The provisions of this Act about contracts of sale do not apply to a transaction in the form of 
a contract of sale which is intended to operate by way of mortgage, pledge, charge or other 
security.
In analysing a transaction of this nature, the courts have always insisted that the sub-
stance of the transaction and not merely its form must be examined. If the transaction 
is ‘really’ a loan on the security of the goods the Bills of Sale Acts will apply, and if it is 
unregistered (as it nearly always is) the contract is void and the chargee will be unable to 
seize the goods or even to recover the agreed interest, though the actual loan itself will be 
recoverable in a restitutionary claim, formerly known as the action for money had and 
received.66 If, on the other hand, the parties ‘really’ intend the transaction to be a genu-
ine ‘sale’ followed by a genuine hire-purchase or leaseback contract, the transaction will 
be valid and the two contracts will take effect according to their terms. For instance, in 
Kingsley v Sterling Industrial Securities Ltd,67 Winn LJ said:
In my definite view the sole or entirely dominant question upon that part of the appeal to which 
I have so far adverted is whether in reality and upon a true analysis of the transactions and each 
of them, and having regard in particular to the intention of the parties, they constituted loans or 
sales. It is clear upon the authorities that if a transaction is in reality a loan of money intended to 
be secured by, for example, a sale and hiring agreement, the document or documents embodying 
the arrangement will be within the Bills of Sale Acts; it is equally clear that each case must be 
determined according to the proper inference to be drawn from the facts and whatever the form 
the transaction may take the court will decide according to its real substance.

The contract of sale	 21
It might have been thought that such an approach would usually lead to the trans-
action being struck down since in most such cases the parties do not ‘really’ intend the 
goods to be ‘sold’.68 This is borne out by the fact that the sale price will rarely be fixed 
by the market price of the goods but will depend on the amount of the loan the seller 
wishes to raise, though doubtless the market price will normally represent at least the 
maximum which the buyer will pay or lend. Moreover, there is never any intention in 
such transactions for the possession of the goods to be given unless the seller defaults 
in payment of the hire-purchase rental; hence the implied conditions under the Sale of 
Goods Act would be absurdly inappropriate. Nevertheless, the modern tendency has 
been to uphold the genuineness of these transactions, though judicial disagreements 
have been frequent.69 The difficulty is to formulate any criterion by which the ‘real inten-
tion’ of the parties may be judged. In practice, there is rarely any problem about com-
mercial sales and leasebacks, but more difficulty has often arisen with sales followed by 
hire-purchase contracts.
In Scots law, where the Bills of Sale Acts do not apply, the interpretation of s. 62(4) 
has caused some difficulties against the background of the general principle that the cre-
ation of a security in moveables requires that the creditor be in possession of the security 
subjects. Thus the ‘buyer’ in the transaction has no security. The disapplication of the 
Sale of Goods Act also means that the pre-1893 rules on transfer of property apply, with 
the effect that the ‘buyer’ in the transaction cannot be the owner of the goods unless 
there has been delivery. As in England, the Scottish courts have emphasised the need to 
investigate the substance of the transaction and the true intention of the parties.70 If the 
evidence shows that the aim of the transaction was to raise finance by means of a secu-
rity, then there is no sale.71
The courts tend to take at their face value the intention of the parties as expressed 
in the written documents which they have executed. The argument that these docu-
ments are ‘shams’ because they do not express the ‘real intention’ of the parties has 
been rejected unless it is shown that both parties do not intend the documents to operate 
according to their terms. Thus in Snook v London and West Riding Investments Ltd, 
Diplock LJ said:
As regards the contention of the [plaintiff] that the transactions between himself, Auto 
Finance and the defendants were a ‘sham’, it is, I think, necessary to consider what, if any, 
legal concept is involved in the use of this popular and pejorative word. I apprehend that, if 
it has any meaning in law, it means acts done or documents executed by the parties to the 
‘sham’ which are intended by them to give to third parties or to the court the appearance of 
creating between the parties legal rights and obligations different from the actual legal rights 
and obligations (if any) which the parties intend to create. But one thing, I think, is clear in 
legal principle, morality and the authorities (see Yorkshire Railway Wagon Co v Maclure[72] and 
68	 See Fitzpatrick [1969] J Bus Law 211.

SLT 891 (HL)).

	 22	 Nature and formation of the contract of sale
Stoneleigh Finance Ltd v Phillips[73], that for acts or documents to be a ‘sham’, with whatever 
legal consequences follow from this, all the parties thereto must have a common intention 
that the acts or documents are not to create the legal rights and obligations which they give 
the appearance of creating. No unexpressed intentions of a ‘shammer’ affect the rights of a 
party whom he deceived. There is an express finding in this case that the defendants were not 
parties to the alleged ‘sham’. So this contention fails.74
These refinancing transactions are not prohibited by the Consumer Credit Act 1974, 
although that Act has the result of conferring upon the ‘seller’ the protection of the gen-
eral provisions relating to the provision of credit. It is possible, however, that the Unfair 
Contract Terms Act 1977 may indirectly affect the situation. Because of the restrictions 
on the right of the parties to contract out of the terms as to quality and fitness imposed 
by that Act,75 financiers may become more reluctant to enter into a transaction of this 
nature. What is more, absurd consequences could follow if the ‘seller’ was held entitled 
to complain of defects in the very goods he has himself sold and taken back on hire- 
purchase. So the courts may be more inclined now to hold that such transactions are not 
genuine sales, but fall within the Bills of Sale Acts.
The question has also arisen as to whether an arrangement under which the supplier 
of goods to a customer acts as agent of a finance house to sell goods to the customer, 
and then to resell them to the finance house, creates a charge over the supplier company’s 
assets.76 It has been held that it does not.77
Sale of goods and supply of services
Traditionally, the law has distinguished between contracts for sale of goods and con-
tracts for the supply of services – the distinction persists in relation to the non-consumer 
sales today. In older law, contracts for the supply of services were often subdivided, 
for instance, into contracts for skill and labour, or contracts for labour and materials, 
according to whether the supplier was providing services only, or materials as well. It 
was, however, generally assumed that in a contract for services the law applicable was 
not the law of sale of goods even though some goods might incidentally be supplied. For 
example, it was always said that a contract for the services of a solicitor was a contract 
for services, even though the solicitor might be expected to draft some document and 
deliver it to the client so that it would become the client’s property.78
The first question that needs to be asked is when does it matter whether a contract is for 
the sale of goods or for supply of services? In many cases it will not matter at all; the appli-
cable law will be the same. But there are some cases in which it has mattered in the past, and

ER 1058, above, n. 26, and Re Curtain Dream plc [1990] BCLC 925.
75	 There were, of course, similar restrictions in the previous Hire-Purchase Acts. But the new Act makes no 
specific provision, as the old one did, for second-hand goods. It is, therefore, more likely that a refinancing 
transaction could involve the finance company in liability for the quality and fitness of the goods if 
transactions are held valid according to their terms.

The contract of sale	 23
yet others in which it may still matter. First, as we have seen, in England until 1954 the law 
required that contracts for the sale of goods of the value of £10 or more should be evidenced 
in writing. No such requirement applied to contracts for the supply of services. This differ-
ence between the two kinds of contract disappeared with the repeal of the requirement of 
writing, but older authorities on the distinction which may still be cited today were often 
concerned with this requirement. Secondly, a contract in which a person is to manufacture 
goods and then supply them, or in which a person is to supply and install materials in a 
house or other building, may also differ from a simple contract of sale of goods in some 
important respects. For example, the time at which the property in the goods is to pass from 
the supplier to the buyer or client may differ in the two cases.79 Thirdly, in the case of goods 
to be manufactured by the seller, there may sometimes be a difference between a contract 
under which the seller simply contracts for a result, and cases in which it actually contracts to 
manufacture and deliver the goods. In the former case, the contract is one of sale and nothing 
else, while in the latter case the contract is both for services and for the sale of goods. Impor-
tant results may sometimes turn upon whether the contract falls into one class or the other. 
For example, a buyer who pays part of the price in advance, and then defaults, may be enti-
tled to recover his advance payment (subject of course to the seller’s claim for damages for 
the default) if the contract is a pure contract of sale,80 while it seems that he cannot recover 
any such advance payment if the contract is one for manufacture and sale.81
The reason for this apparently arbitrary distinction is that if the contract is a pure sale, 
the whole consideration for the buyer’s price is the transfer of the property in the goods to 
the buyer: hence it is inconsistent for the seller at one and the same time to claim that he need 
no longer transfer the goods to the buyer because of the buyer’s default, and yet that he may 
retain the buyer’s advance payment, which is simply the consideration for that transfer of the 
goods. On the other hand, where the contract is for the manufacture and supply of the goods, 
the manufacture of the goods is itself part of the consideration for the price; if the seller has 
devoted time and money to making the goods, any advance payment can be considered as a 
payment towards the manufacture as much as a payment towards the actual transfer of the 
goods. Hence, the mere fact that as a result of the buyer’s default the goods will no longer be 
transferred to him at all does not mean that the consideration for the advance payment has 
wholly failed. However, despite this element of logicality, the result is far from satisfactory, and 
the law remains in a somewhat uncertain state.82
A more general reason why it may be necessary to distinguish between a contract 
of sale of goods and a contract for services is simply that the provisions of the Sale of 
Goods Act do not in general apply to contracts for services. And although in some situ-
ations there is corresponding legislation governing contracts of services – in particular, 
79	 See Pritchett and Gold and Electrical Power Storage Co v Currie [1916] 2 Ch 515 – see below, p. 262.

case [1943] AC 32, where nobody seems to have had any doubt that there was a total failure of consideration 
when a contract to manufacture machinery was frustrated before any of it was delivered. The effect of the 
developing law of restitution in this area should be noted, however. In British Steel Corp v Cleveland Bridge 
Engineering [1984] 1 All ER 504, the defendants were held liable to pay a reasonable sum to the plaintiffs for 
work done at their request, though no contract had been entered into. See also Jaffey [1998] NILQ 107. It is 
not clear that Scots law would draw these distinctions. See further, below, p. 493–4.
82	 See below, p. 493–4.

	 24	 Nature and formation of the contract of sale
the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982 – there are other situations in which no cor-
responding legislation applies. In particular situations, this may make a critical differ-
ence to the outcome of a case.83 In the case of consumer transactions, the legal position 
with regard to goods to be manufactured or produced, or sold and installed, is now in 
principle affected by the sale of consumer goods and associated guarantees directive,84 
but implementation of these provisions is problematic as will be seen later.85
Another reason why it may be important to distinguish between a contract of sale 
of goods and a contract for the supply of services concerns the implied duties of the 
seller or supplier as to the quality and fitness of the goods or services supplied. Until 
the enactment of the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982, the position was, roughly 
speaking, as follows in England & Wales86:
1	 If the contract was a sale of goods, the implied duties under the Sale of Goods Act 
were incorporated in the contract, and these duties were, and remain, prima facie 
duties of strict liability, that is to say, the seller is responsible for defects in the goods, 
even in the absence of negligence.
2	 If the contract was for the supply of services, then, insofar as the services themselves 
were concerned, the supplier’s duties were generally duties of due care only; but 
where goods were supplied incidentally as a part of such a contract, it was generally 
held that the supplier’s duties as regards the goods so supplied were strict, at any rate 
in a transaction for commercial (as opposed to professional) services.87 Although the 
implied terms in the Sale of Goods Act did not apply to goods supplied in the course 
of a contract for services the courts tended to imply terms at common law, which 
were more or less identical with those implied under the Act.
The Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982 in effect enacts the position as set out in 
paragraph 2 above. Under this Act, implied conditions as to quality and fitness, almost 
identical to those implied under the Sale of Goods Act, are incorporated in all con-
tracts for the ‘transfer of goods’ other than contracts of sale and hire-purchase, which 
are already covered by other statutes.88 So, also, restrictions on contracting out of these 
implied conditions are imposed, closely analogous to those governing contracts of sale 
of goods.89 A contract for the transfer of goods which thus falls within the 1982 Act is 
defined by s. 1(1) of that Act as a contract under which ‘one person transfers or agrees to 
transfer to another the property in goods’ (other than the excepted contracts, which are 
covered elsewhere) and s. 1(3) makes it clear that these contracts fall within the 1982 Act

87	 See, e.g., Myers v Brent Cross Service Co [1934] 1 KB 46; Watson v Buckley [1940] 1 All ER 174.
88	 There are a number of other exceptions of minor importance, e.g., a gift (even if made by deed) is not 
covered: s. 1(1)(d) of the 1982 Act. The Law Commissions’ Final Report on Sale and Supply of Goods, 
which is discussed in Chapter 9, proposed a number of important amendments to the law of sale which are 
also applied to other contracts for the supply of goods by the Sale and Supply of Goods Act 1994. This Act 
also applies to Scotland the provisions of the 1982 Act about contracts for the transfer of goods.
89	 See s. 7 of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977, as amended by the 1982 Act, below, p. 208.

	
	 	
The contract of sale	 25
even if services are also provided under the contract. Then ss. 12–16 of the 1982 Act deal 
with contracts for the supply of services, and it is made clear that these sections apply 
even if goods are also to be transferred under the contract.90 The implied terms under 
these sections, however, only impose a requirement to carry out the services with reason-
able care and skill (s. 13) and do not impose strict liability.91
Thus, the 1982 Act appears to simplify and clarify the law. Where a contract might 
be classified as a contract of sale of goods or a contract for the supply of services, the 
new Act will often make it quite immaterial how the contract is classified. Insofar as 
goods are supplied under the contract, the seller’s (or supplier’s) duties will normally 
be strict and excludable only in the limited circumstances provided for contracts for 
sale or supply of goods, while insofar as the contract concerns services, the supplier’s 
duties will be duties of care, which will be excludable subject to the reasonableness 
requirement of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977. Unfortunately, the 1982 Act does 
not wholly succeed in separating out duties regarding goods and duties regarding 
services. Although the position prior to the Act was (as stated above) that normally 
the supplier was strictly liable as regards the goods, and only liable for negligence as 
regards services, there were many exceptions to this position. On the one hand, there 
were some cases in which goods were supplied as an incident to a contract for services 
in which the seller’s or supplier’s duties were not strict, but only duties of care; and on 
the other hand, there were also a number of cases (rather more in this situation than 
the previous one) in which the supplier’s duties as regards the services were held to be 
strict and not just duties of care.
The first group of cases concerns contracts for professional services. These are plainly 
contracts for services, but in the course of some transactions of this general nature 
materials of a certain kind may be supplied which would perhaps not be thought of as 
‘goods’ in the ordinary way. For instance, it has never been suggested in England that 
a doctor or hospital which supplied drugs to a patient (even a paying patient) could be 
held liable if the drugs, despite all reasonable care, turned out to be unfit for their pur-
pose; nor has it ever been suggested that a patient inoculated with some contaminated 
vaccine could sue for breach of an implied warranty of fitness, as opposed to suing for 
negligence.92 Similarly, it has never been suggested that a patient who receives a trans-
fusion of contaminated blood could sue the supplier (even if he is a paying patient and 
a contract can be established) on the basis of implied warranties. In America, this pos-
sibility was specifically rejected by the decision of the New York Court of Appeals in 
Perlmutter v Beth David Hospital93 in which the plaintiff was given a blood transfusion 
in the defendants’ hospital. The blood was contaminated with jaundice viruses which, 
according to the expert evidence, were not detectable by any scientific tests at the time, 
and the plaintiff suffered injury in consequence. The plaintiff was a paying patient at the 
90	 But these provisions do not apply in Scotland, where (apart from the Consumer Rights Act 2015) the 
supplier of services still has only the common law duty of care (McBryde, Contract, paras 9.37-9.39).
91	 Though under Arts 1(4) and 2(5) of the sale of consumer goods and associated guarantees directive they 
may do so – see chapter 22 et seq.
92	 See, e.g., Roe v Minister of Health [1954] 2 QB 66.
93	 123 NE 2d 792 (1954). Not all US states follow this approach, but in most states where warranty liability has 
been recognised at common law, the result has been reversed by statute.

	 26	 Nature and formation of the contract of sale
hospital and in the account rendered to him he was charged a separate sum for the cost 
of the blood itself. The plaintiff claimed that the blood had been ‘sold’ to him and that 
the defendants were therefore liable for ‘defects’ on the basis of implied warranties.94 But 
the majority of the court held that the transaction was one of services only and that the 
supply of the blood was merely incidental to those services, and an English court would 
almost certainly concur with this decision.95
On the other hand, in Dodd v Wilson,96 the plaintiff contracted with a veterinary sur-
geon to inoculate his cattle with a serum, which the surgeon did, using vaccine which he 
had himself bought from suppliers of vaccine. It was held that this was not a contract of 
sale but that, nevertheless, the surgeon impliedly warranted the vaccine to be fit for the 
purpose for which it was supplied. Hence he was liable, despite the fact that he was not 
himself guilty of any negligence.
It is by no means easy to distinguish these cases. Perhaps what underlies the dis-
tinction is that human blood for transfusion is not ordinarily thought of as the sub-
ject of commerce which is bought and sold,97 whereas cattle serum clearly is ordinarily 
the subject of contracts of sale. And although in Dodd v Wilson the contract between 
the plaintiff and the surgeon was not one of sale, the judge evidently did not wish to 
deprive the plaintiff of the remedy which he would undoubtedly have had if he had 
himself bought the serum and merely obtained the services of the defendant to inoc-
ulate his cattle with the serum. In fact, the surgeon brought in his suppliers as third 
parties to the case and they brought in the manufacturers as fourth parties. Since the 
transactions between these parties, and between the surgeon and his suppliers, were 
clearly contracts of sale, the liability was passed down the line to the manufacturers.
The effect of the 1982 Act on these problems is unclear.98 A literal approach would 
suggest that strict duties as to the quality and fitness of the goods would now apply in 
all these cases on the ground that they involve the transfer of goods even as an incident 
to a contract for services, but a court might still strive to avoid this result by holding 
(for instance) that human blood for transfusion is not ‘goods’ at all.99 The case would 
be even stronger with organ transplants100 but, on the other hand, manufactured objects 
which are implanted in a body (such as heart pacemakers or artificial heart valves or hip 
joints) would presumably be ‘goods’ and so could attract the strict duties of quality and 
fitness.101 Similarly, the contract in Dodd v Wilson would now seem clearly to fall within 
the 1982 Act.

101	 It seems that at one time it was intended that items implanted under the NHS should remain the property 
of the NHS, but this suggestion was vetoed by Ministers (see former Health Minister Edwina Currie in  
The Sunday Times, 22 October 1989, p. C2), so it must be assumed that the property in an implanted object 
is intended to pass to the patient. Problems may well arise in relation to implants under the Consumer 
Protection Act 1987 – see below, p. 543 et seq. Of course, the transaction under which these articles were 
implanted would have to be a consensual one, which might create an indefensible distinction between 
private and NHS patients – see p. 10.

	
	 	
The contract of sale	 27
A similar problem arises with other goods transferred as a minor incident to a 
contract for services. Reference has been made above to the case of a contract 
with a solicitor for the drafting of a legal document which is thereupon supplied 
to the client and plainly becomes his property. Again, literal construction of the 
1982 Act would suggest that the solicitor might now become strictly liable if the 
document fails of its purpose, even if the solicitor has taken all due care; again, it 
does not seem likely that this result was actually intended by the Act, and a court 
would presumably strive to avoid it.102 A possible distinction which might be made is 
between the legal document as goods, that is, as paper and ink, and the legal effect 
it is intended to produce which is entirely dependent on the legal framework within 
which it operates.103 An analogous distinction is between the medium upon which a 
painting is painted, which becomes the property of the purchaser, and the copyright 
in the painting, which remains vested in the artist until he assigns it. A related prob-
lem arises in relation to computer software which is specially written for a customer. 
This question is dealt with in Chapter 3.
The second main problem raised by the 1982 Act’s attempt to separate out the legal 
treatment of implied conditions regarding goods on the one hand and services on the 
other is, in a sense, the converse of the first. Prior to the Act there were some circum-
stances in which services were supplied as an incident to a contract for the sale (or 
transfer) of goods and in which the seller, or supplier, was held to the strict standard 
appropriate for the quality and fitness of goods, both for the goods and the services 
themselves. This would normally have been the case (whatever the nature of the con-
tract) if the seller or supplier contracted to produce a result. For instance, a seller who 
contracted to make and deliver a machine would not normally have been able to escape 
liability for the machine’s failure to meet the specified (or implied) quality or fitness 
required under the contract by pleading that he took all due care and that the resulting 
failure was not because the goods (or parts) were in any way defective, but because they 
had been defectively put together in some way not due to his negligence. Similarly, a 
repairer who subcontracted part of the work to competent subcontractors might have 
been liable for the negligence of the subcontractors on the ground that he impliedly war-
ranted that the work under the contract would be fit for the purpose required – not just 
that he would do the work with due care.104 Although the 1982 Act only implies a duty 
of reasonable care with regard to services (whether or not they are supplied under a 
contract which also involves a transfer of goods), it seems probable that the same result

103	 In Winter v G P Putnam’s Sons 938 F 2d 1033, 9th Cir. (1991) the plaintiffs, relying on erroneous information 
in a reference book, ate poisonous mushrooms and suffered serious physical injury. The court refused 
to hold the publishers liable on products liability theory, on the ground that the expressions and ideas 
contained in the book were intangible, and products liability theory is concerned with tangibles. It must 
be borne in mind, however, that American courts are concerned not to place restrictions on the unfettered 
exchange of ideas, which might run into problems with the First Amendment to the Constitution. The 
court distinguished the case of Fluor Corp v Jeppesen & Co 216 Cal Rptr 68 (Cal Ct of App 1985) in which 
the defendants were held liable on products liability theory in respect of a defective aeronautical chart. For 
a discussion of the question of the liability of sellers of books containing erroneous information see Lloyd 
[1993] JBL 48 – and see p. 543 et seq. below.
104	 See, e.g., Stewart v Reavell’s Garage [1953] 2 QB 545.

	 28	 Nature and formation of the contract of sale
would still be arrived at because of s. 16(3) of the 1982 Act. This section leaves open the 
possibility of a court implying terms which are stricter than those of due care, so that, 
in effect, the implied duty that services are to be performed with reasonable care must be 
taken as a minimum legal requirement (subject to the possibility of valid exclusion), and 
not as excluding the possibility of a higher duty.
It is thus clear that the distinction between goods and services will often remain of 
some importance in the law, and it will still occasionally be necessary to distinguish 
between a contract of sale of goods and a contract for the supply of services. The test 
for deciding whether a contract falls into the one category or the other is to ask what is 
‘the substance’ of the contract.105 If the substance of the contract is the skill and labour 
of the supplier, then the contract is one for services, whereas if the real substance of the 
contract is the ultimate result – the goods to be provided – then the contract is one of 
sale of goods. Hence a contract for the painting of a picture is a contract for services – 
the skill of the artist is clearly more important than the incidental fact that the property 
in the completed picture (though not the copyright in it) will pass to the client.106 A 
fortiori, on this test a contract with a professional person such as a lawyer or an account-
ant is a contract for services even though documents may be prepared and passed to the 
client so as to become his property.107 On the other hand, a contract for the construction 
of two ships’ propellers was held by the House of Lords in Cammell Laird & Co Ltd v 
Manganese Bronze and Brass Co Ltd108 to be unquestionably a contract for the sale of 
goods. Similarly, a contract for the manufacture of a ship is a contract of sale of goods, 
but it is not necessarily a pure contract of sale:109 if the process of manufacture itself 
forms part of the contract, the contract in effect consists of two sub-parts, (1) a contract 
under which the supplier is to make the ship – which is a contract for services – and (2) a 
contract under which the supplier agrees to sell the completed ship – in effect, a contract 
of sale of goods. A contract for the supply of a meal in a restaurant, as previously noted, 
seems to be a contract of sale of goods.110
Sale and agency
It may, at first sight, seem a little odd that it is thought necessary to distinguish a con-
tract of sale of goods from a contract of agency, but in a certain type of case the distinc-
tion may well be a fine one by no means easy to draw. Where, for example, A asks B, a 
commission agent, to obtain goods for him from a supplier or from any other source, 
and B complies by sending the goods to A, it may well be a fine point whether this is a 
contract under which B sells the goods to A, or is a contract under which B acts as A’s 
agent to obtain the required goods from other sources.

The contract of sale	 29
It is important to distinguish between the two transactions for a number of reasons. In 
the first place, the Commercial Agency Regulations111 apply to many agency contracts,112 
and regulate the rights and duties of the parties in certain respects. Furthermore, if the 
transaction is an agency contract there may be privity of contract between the buyer 
and the agent’s supplier which will enable action to be brought between them.113 On 
the other hand, if it is a sale, there will be no privity between the buyer and the seller’s 
own supplier. Other reasons for distinguishing the relationship of agent and seller may 
be that the duties of a commission agent are less stringent than those of a seller and, in 
the event of a breach of contract, the measure of damages may also be different. Thus 
if a seller delivers less than he is bound to under the contract, the buyer can reject the 
whole;114 but if, despite his best endeavours, a commission agent delivers less than his 
principal has ordered he has committed no breach of contract and the principal is bound 
to accept whatever is delivered.115 Again, should the commission agent deliver goods of 
the wrong quality he will only have to pay as damages the actual loss suffered by the 
buyer.116 On the other hand, should a seller be guilty of such a breach he may have to pay 
as damages the buyer’s probable loss of profit. So, also, an agent who merely introduces 
a seller to a buyer is not necessarily warranting the seller’s title to sell, whereas if he is 
himself buying and reselling, such a warranty is invariably implied.117
In Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Addison118 Moore-Bick J left open whether petrol sta-
tion franchisees who provided customers with ‘gifts’119 in return for tokens, furnished the 
gifts as agents for Esso or on their own account.120
Where one person contracts to manufacture goods for another out of materials to be 
supplied by that other, it may again be doubtful whether the manufacturer is a seller or 
an agent.121
In the converse position, where a person contracts to dispose of the goods of another, 
it is again necessary to decide whether the relationship between the parties is that of 
buyer and seller or principal and agent. In the latter case, the agent is not in precisely 
the same position as a buyer and, for instance, cannot pass a good title to a third party 
without the principal’s actual or apparent authority.122 Again, where a person contracts 
to dispose of another’s goods, it may be important to decide whether he is a buyer or

an agent if he receives any payment from a third party as a result of disposing of the goods. 
If he is a buyer, such payment will discharge the third party, wholly or pro tanto. But if he is 
an agent and he fails to account to his principal for the money, the third party will only be 
discharged if the agent was authorised to receive the money.123 The relationship between the 
principal and the agent depends, of course, on the terms, express or implied, of the contract 
between them; but in some cases where goods have been delivered to an agent for sale, the 
agent will have the goods on ‘sale or return’ or similar terms, in which case, although the 
transaction is not strictly a sale, some provisions of the Sale of Goods Act may apply.124
Number of parties
It has been decided that the requirement that the property be transferred from one party 
to another means that there must be two distinct parties to a contract of sale. In Graff 
v Evans,125 decided in 1882, 11 years before the original Act was passed, it was held that 
the transfer of intoxicating liquor by the manager of an unincorporated club to a mem-
ber for money was not a ‘sale’ within the Licensing Act, but merely a transfer of special 
property. The basis of the decision was that the member was himself a part owner of 
the liquor and that consequently the transaction was a release of the rights of the other 
members to the ‘purchaser’. It might have been thought, therefore, that when s. 1(1) 
(now s. 2(2)) of the Act specifically enacted that:
There may be a contract of sale between one part owner and another
the basis of Graff v Evans had been swept away. But in Davies v Burnett,126 a divisional 
court followed the earlier case and the Sale of Goods Act was not even referred to. This 
view of the law has now been accepted for so long that it is unlikely to be upset by a 
higher court.127 Scots law appears also to accept this position in principle.128
Although the Act contemplates two distinct parties to the contract, namely a buyer 
and a seller, it does not follow that the buyer cannot already be the owner of the goods, 
for the seller may be a person having legal authority to sell them; for example, a sheriff

otherwise.

The contract of sale	 31
the seller, it seems clear that he can recover any price paid on the ground of total failure 
of consideration. A fortiori if he has not yet paid the price, the seller cannot sue him for 
it. This does not mean that such a contract is necessarily void, though it may be in some 
circumstances.130
The price
Section 8 of the Act is as follows:
(1)	 The price in a contract of sale may be fixed by the contract, or may be left to be fixed in a 
manner agreed by the contract, or may be determined by the course of dealing between the 
parties.
(2)	 Where the price is not determined as mentioned in subsection (1) above the buyer must pay 
a reasonable price.
(3)	 What is a reasonable price is a question of fact dependent on the circumstances of each 
particular case.
We have already seen that the consideration must be paid in money and that, strictly 
speaking, the contract will not be a contract of sale of goods if the consideration is in 
some other form.131
Section 8 has given rise to more difficulty than might have been thought. The section 
assumes that a contract has been made by the parties and then proceeds to explain the 
methods by which the price can be ascertained. But the first point which must be con-
sidered in an action on the sale is whether a contract has in fact been finally agreed upon 
by the parties, and the absence of an agreement as to the price (or even as to the mode 
in which the price is to be paid)132 may show that the parties have not yet reached a con-
cluded contract.
Another problem concerns the question whether the parties can make a binding con-
tract in which they agree to fix the price at some future date. When s. 8 says that the price 
can be ‘left to be fixed in a manner agreed’, does this exclude the possibility that ‘the 
manner’ may simply require the parties to agree on the price? One view is that the par-
ties simply cannot make a binding contract for the sale of goods at prices ‘to be agreed’, 
and that s. 8 does not apply to such a case because under that section the buyer would  
have to pay a reasonable price, that is, a price fixed by a judge (or arbitrator) which is 
not the same thing as a price agreed between the parties.
There is undoubtedly some support for this view in the difficult case of May & 
Butcher v The King.133 The House of Lords here held that an agreement for the sale of 
goods at a price to be later fixed by the parties was not, in the circumstances of the case, 
130	 In Cooper v Phibbs (1867) LR 2 HL 149 the House of Lords held that a contract for the lease of a fishery 
which turned out already to belong to the lessee was voidable. It is probable, however, that it should have 
been held void – see Bell v Lever Bros [1932] AC 161, 218.
131	 There are dicta in Koppel v Koppel [1966] 1 WLR 802, 811, indicating that a contract to transfer goods in 
return for services is a sale of goods, but these seem to have been per incuriam.

	 32	 Nature and formation of the contract of sale
a concluded contract; but the later case of Hillas & Co Ltd v Arcos Ltd134 shows that we 
cannot regard the earlier case as laying down any general rule and that that case is best 
regarded as one where the parties had not in the circumstances arrived at a concluded 
agreement.135 In Foley v Classique Coaches Ltd,136 the Court of Appeal held that an 
agreement to supply petrol ‘at a price to be agreed by the parties’ was a binding contract 
as the parties had clearly evinced an intention to be bound, and the contract contained, 
in the form of an arbitration clause, under which a reasonable price could be fixed in the 
event of disagreement, providing a means by which the uncertainty could be resolved.
On the other hand, in a number of modern decisions, the courts have reiterated the 
old (but not strictly accurate) view that the law does not recognise ‘an agreement to 
agree’ as a binding contract. So in Courtney & Fairbairn Ltd v Tolaini Bros (Hotels) 
Ltd the Court of Appeal refused recognition of a contract at a price ‘to be agreed’.137 
Of course, an arbitration clause to determine the price or the relevant terms would alter 
the case.138 In the Australian High Court, suggestions have also been made that s. 8 is 
‘anomalous’ and is not to be extended,139 and it has also been suggested in the same 
case that the section only applies where the goods have been delivered and accepted, and 
that it has no application to a purely executory contract.140 These dicta have not been 
followed, even in Australia,141 but there does seem to be good sense in distinguishing 
between executed and executory contracts for this purpose. If the parties have already 
begun to carry out the contract, it is more seemingly contrary to prevailing commercial 
reality as well as more unjust to declare the transaction void altogether.142
In Sudbrook Trading Estate Ltd v Eggleton143 the House of Lords reviewed some 
similar problems which have arisen in contracts for the sale of land, which are, of 
course, governed by common law and equitable rules and not by the Sale of Goods Act. 
The case did not involve anything in the nature of an ‘agreement to agree’ although it 
did involve an option to a lessee to buy the freehold of the leased premises at a price 
to be fixed by valuers appointed by the two parties or, in default of agreement by the 
valuers, at a price to be fixed by an umpire appointed by the valuers. It was held that 
the failure of the lessor to appoint a valuer could not be allowed to deprive the lessee 
of his right to a decree of specific performance once he had exercised his option to 
buy. The court could direct an inquiry to ascertain the reasonable price to be paid as 
the lessor had waived his right to appoint a valuer. The decision does not strictly have 
anything to do with s. 8 of the Sale of Goods Act, but there are dicta indicating that

The contract of sale	 33
where an agreement has been partly performed, the court will strain to find some way 
of enforcing the intended arrangements even in the absence of agreement on a term 
which might have been fatal if the whole agreement had remained executory. It seems 
possible, therefore, that where parties agree on a sale of goods at prices to be agreed in 
the future, and the goods are actually delivered and accepted, or the agreement is oth-
erwise partly performed, the courts may now be more willing to treat this as a binding 
contract to sell at reasonable prices, and to provide machinery for the ascertainment of 
such reasonable prices, even in the absence of a provision such as an arbitration clause 
by which this could be done under the contract itself.
This is perhaps borne out by two Court of Appeal decisions (though these did not 
involve price terms) in which it was stressed that in commercial cases, it is the intention 
of the parties which is decisive.144 A failure to agree even on relatively important terms is 
not necessarily fatal; indeed, it cannot even be said that a failure to agree on the ‘essen-
tial’ terms is fatal. Provided that the parties intend to be bound, and that the agreement 
is sufficiently complete to be enforced as a contract, it is immaterial that they have failed 
to agree on some term which might appear, objectively speaking, to be important or even 
essential.145
The most recent authority in this area is the important House of Lords decision in 
Walford v Miles.146 Again, this was not a sale of goods case, but the principles are appli-
cable. The plaintiffs who were negotiating to buy a photographic processing business 
from the defendant entered into what allegedly amounted to a ‘lock out’ agreement 
according to which the defendant agreed to terminate negotiations with third parties 
and not to consider alternative offers. The agreement did not specify for how long the 
defendant was bound, but the plaintiffs asserted that it provided the parties with an 
exclusive opportunity to try to come to terms with the defendant. The defendant sold to 
a third party, and the plaintiff sued for breach. It was argued that the agreement implied a 
duty to negotiate in good faith with the plaintiffs, and that it should endure for a reason-
able time, which was such time as was necessary to permit good faith negotiations either 
to come to fruition, or to fail. However, the House of Lords, following Courtney &  
Fairbairn Ltd v Tolaini, held that an agreement to negotiate was not enforceable, and 
was not persuaded that the argument was improved by glossing a bare agreement to 
negotiate with a duty to negotiate in good faith.147 In Lord Ackner’s view, the plain-
tiff’s argument was fundamentally at odds with the adversarial ethic of contract law. 
Although this appears to have settled the matter in England and Wales for the time 
being, it must be noted that the experience of other jurisdictions suggests that Walford 
v Miles is unlikely to be the last word on the subject.148 It must also be noted that Lord

147	 The House of Lords rejected the view that a duty to use ‘best endeavours’ and to negotiate in good faith 
amount to the same thing, but how they differ is not clear.

Faith in Contract and Property (1999, Hart Publishing, Oxford), and note also McCall’s Entertainments 
(Ayr) Ltd v South Ayrshire Council (No. 1) 1998 SLT 1403, in which Walford v Miles was cited, but not 
discussed.

	 34	 Nature and formation of the contract of sale
Ackner expressly recognised the possibility of a valid ‘lock out’ agreement.149 Such an 
agreement does not lock the parties into negotiations; what the agreement achieves is to 
‘lock out’ one party from negotiations with third parties for a certain period,150 in order 
to give the other party an opportunity to try to come to terms.151
Section 9 runs as follows:
(1)	 Where there is an agreement to sell goods on the terms that the price is to be fixed by the 
valuation of a third party, and he cannot or does not make the valuation, the agreement is 
avoided; but if the goods or any part of them have been delivered to and appropriated by 
the buyer he must pay a reasonable price for them.
(2)	 Where the third party is prevented from making the valuation by the fault of the seller or 
buyer, the party not at fault may maintain an action for damages against the party at fault.
An agreement for the sale of goods at a valuation to be made by a third party must be 
distinguished from an agreement for sale at a valuation without naming any third party 
who is to make the valuation. In the former event, s. 9 applies, and if the third party does 
not make the valuation the contract is avoided, subject to the effect of s. 9(2). But in the 
latter event (e.g. a sale of stock ‘at valuation’), the agreement is in effect an agreement 
for sale at a reasonable price and, if no valuer is agreed and the parties otherwise fail to 
come to some arrangement for valuation, the contract will stand as a contract for sale at 
a reasonable price under s. 8.152
The sort of situation which is probably envisaged by s. 9(2) is, for example, a refusal 
by the seller to allow the valuer access to the goods, thereby preventing him obtaining 
the necessary material for making his valuation. It is a little difficult to imagine circum-
stances in which the buyer could prevent the valuer making his valuation, but no doubt 
this was inserted ex abundanti cautela to meet all possible contingencies. It is, perhaps, 
not entirely clear whether s. 9(2) envisages a sort of action for breach of a duty of good 
faith, or whether it envisages that in the circumstances postulated there would be an 
actual contract of sale. The measure of damages could perhaps differ according to the 
correct answer to that question.
Where a sale at a valuation is agreed upon and a valuation is subsequently made, 
it cannot be upset merely on the ground that the valuer has been negligent or has set 
about the valuation in an incorrect manner. As Lord Denning MR said in Campbell v 
Edwards:153
It is simply the law of contract. If two persons agree that the price of property should be fixed 
by a valuer on whom they agree, and he gives that valuation honestly, they are bound by it. If 
there were fraud or collusion, of course, it would be very different.
149	 At p. 119.
150	 It is difficult to understand why the specification of a time seems to have been considered so important. 
Since the object of the contract is to give the parties time to reach a valuation, there seems to be no good 
reason why a contract giving a reasonable time for the parties to effect that object should not be upheld.
151	 See Pitt v PHH Asset Management [1993] 4 All ER 961.
152	 F & G Sykes (Wessex) Ltd v Fine Fare, n. 140, above. But it may be that as a result of the Sudbrook Trading 
Estate case, p. 32 above, even the failure of a named third party to make a valuation will only avoid the 
contract if his identity was essential to the arrangements. Otherwise it may be held that the contract is 
really for sale at a reasonable price, and the naming of the third party is simply machinery which can be 
replaced by the court.

The contract of sale	 35
It is now clear, however, that the valuer himself will normally be liable for negligence 
if it can be shown that he has adopted a wholly incorrect basis for his valuation.154 As 
Lord Denning made clear in the above-cited passage, the valuation can be upset if there 
has been fraud or collusion. There are also some first-instance decisions holding that a 
valuation which sets out the basis on which it is arrived at may be open to challenge on 
the ground that the method disclosed is unsound in law.155 But it cannot be assumed that 
the party aggrieved will always have a remedy if the valuation is made on an incorrect 
basis because if the basis for the valuation is not disclosed and it was made in accord-
ance with a permissible (though wrong) professional judgment, the valuation will stand 
and the valuer will not be liable for negligence.
Conveyancing effect of the contract
Some comment must be made here on the words ‘A contract of sale of goods is a con-
tract by which the seller transfers … the property in goods’ in s. 2(1). As is clearly appar-
ent from these words, the actual contract may suffice to transfer the property in the 
goods, that is to say, it may operate both as a conveyance and a contract. Attention is 
frequently drawn to this as though it were a remarkable rule, and a contrast is often 
made with the corresponding provisions of Roman law in which a sharp line was drawn 
between the contract and the conveyance. There is some point in this contrast, which is 
important in Scotland,156 but a note of caution should be sounded against pursuing it 
too far, for remarkably few results follow in English law from the transfer of property by 
the mere agreement, which would not in any event follow from the transfer of property 
by delivery. This topic will be more fully examined later.157
It is possible that these words in s. 2(1) may also have the effect of bringing a 
transaction within the scope of a contract of sale even though it would be difficult to 
say that the object of the transaction was the transfer of the property in any goods. For 
example, if a person organises a party, for which he sells tickets entitling a purchaser to 
help himself to drinks, it seems that a sale takes place when this happens, although it 
would be difficult to say that there was a contract of sale of goods arising from the mere 
sale of the ticket.158 On the other hand, the courts have shown little inclination to make 
use of this analysis in civil cases. Thus in the case of a contract for work and materials, 
the courts have not said that there is a contract of sale within the Act when property 
in the materials eventually passes to the party ordering the work and materials.159 And 
since the passing of the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982, a court is perhaps more 
likely to hold that such a transaction is a contract for the transfer of goods rather than a 
contract for the sale of goods. But it would only be a matter of practical importance in 
very special circumstances.

	 36	 Nature and formation of the contract of sale
Conversely, circumstances may arise as a result of the way in which a transaction is 
financed, such as those in the recent decision in PST Energy 7 Shipping LLC v OW Bun-
ker Malta Ltd,160 where a contract for the sale of bunker (in a largely standard form and 
on standard terms), categorically a contract under which it was intended that property 
in the goods would ultimately transfer, was, as a result of the repeated sub-contracting 
of the obligation to supply, with a corresponding series of retention of title clauses, the 
assignment of the right to be paid to the original seller’s bank and the consumption of 
the goods (and thus of property in the goods) before became payment due, construed 
merely as ‘bunker supply contract’ outside of the scope of s. 2.
Formation of the contract
Offer and acceptance
Part II of the Act is entitled ‘Formation of the Contract’; however, with the exception 
of s. 57 in Part VII governing the sale of goods by auction, there is nothing in it which 
regulates the actual formation of the contract of sale of goods.
As a result, we are left to infer from s. 62(2) that a contract of sale of goods is formed 
according to the ordinary principles of the common law of England and Scotland, that 
is to say, by offer and acceptance. As there is nothing in these rules of special significance 
in the law of sale of goods, this subject need not be enlarged upon here.
Apart from the Act’s (and some other) provisions on auction sales,161 only two other 
matters relating to formation need be dealt with here, namely the doctrine of mistake 
in offer and acceptance, and the special provisions relating to contracts concluded away 
from business premises, that is, the provisions designed to safeguard consumers against 
the consequences of ‘doorstep selling’.
Auction sales
The first two subsections of s. 57 are as follows:
(1)	 Where the goods are put up for sale by auction in lots, each lot is prima facie deemed to be 
the subject of a separate contract of sale.
(2)	 A sale by auction is complete when the auctioneer announces its completion by the fall of 
the hammer, or in other customary manner, and until the announcement is made any bid-
der may retract his bid.
These two subsections restate the common law rules governing auction sales. Under 
these rules it is quite clear that the bidder is the offeror, that the auctioneer is entitled 
to accept or to refuse any bid,162 and that the contract is made on the fall of the ham-
mer. As each bidder may retract, the offeree may withdraw the article from sale even 
after bidding has commenced.163 But, in practice, many auction sales are conducted 
160	 [2015] EWHC 2022.
161	 But in Scotland the common law may be that a bid cannot be retracted unless it is refused or a higher bid is 
made: Cree v Durie, 1 December 1810 (FC).
162	 See, e.g., British Car Auctions v Wright [1972] 3 All ER 462.
163	 Fenwick v Macdonald Fraser & Co (1904) 6 F 850.

	
	 	
The contract of sale	 37
under special ‘Conditions of Sale’ and these may sometimes affect the application of s. 57. 
For example, a condition justifying the auctioneer in re-opening the bidding in the event of 
a dispute has been applied even where the auctioneer intended to knock the goods down to 
the person who intended to buy them.164
The next four subsections give rise to more difficulty:
(3)	 A sale by auction may be notified to be subject to a reserve or upset price, and a right to 
bid may also be reserved expressly by or on behalf of the seller.
(4)	 Where a sale by auction is not notified to be subject to a right to bid on behalf of the seller, 
it is not lawful for the seller to bid himself or to employ any person to bid at the sale, or for 
the auctioneer knowingly to take any bid from the seller or any such person.
(5)	 A sale contravening subsection (4) above may be treated as fraudulent by the buyer.
(6)	 Where, in respect of a sale by auction, a right to bid is expressly reserved (but not other-
wise) the seller, or any one person on his behalf, may bid at the auction.
The effect of these subsections may be considered under three heads.
Auction sale expressly subject to reserve price or right to bid
First, where the auction is expressly advertised subject to a reserve price or to the right of 
the seller to bid, subss. (3) and (6) preserve the seller’s right not to sell below the reserve 
price, or to bid himself or to employ one (but not more than one) person to bid on his 
behalf, as the case may be. But as we have seen, subs. (2) preserves the common law rule 
that no contract of sale comes into existence until the seller accepts a bid. Subsection (3) 
therefore has independent force only where the auctioneer knocks the goods down below 
the reserve price by mistake. The effect of such a mistake was discussed in McManus v 
Fortescue.165 In that case, the printed catalogue at an auction sale stated that each lot was 
subject to a reserve price, but the auctioneer knocked the goods down to the plaintiff for 
less than the reserve price by mistake. Recollecting the reserve price, the auctioneer then 
refused to sign a memorandum of sale.166 It was held by the Court of Appeal that an 
action against the auctioneer must fail. Since the sale was expressly subject to a reserve 
price, the auctioneer could not be made liable for breach of warranty of authority. An 
action against the owner would presumably also have failed as the auctioneer’s authority 
was known to be limited and was in fact exceeded. It is a fair inference that had the sale 
not been notified to the public as being subject to a reserve price, the seller would have 
been liable as the buyer would have been able to rely upon the auctioneer’s apparent 
authority.
Auction sale with no express statement as to reserve price or right to bid
Where nothing is said about any reserve price or right of the owner to bid, a distinction 
must be drawn between the two cases. In the former case, the effect of s. 57(2) is that the 
auctioneer is still entitled to decline to accept any bid. In the latter case, however, subs.

166	 If he had signed, it seems he would have been liable – see Fay v Miller [1941] 2 All ER 18.

	 38	 Nature and formation of the contract of sale
(4) applies and the buyer may set the contract aside, or presumably may sue for damages. 
Even where a reserve price is notified, the owner is still not entitled to bid unless this 
right also is expressly reserved; and if he does so bid and the reserve price is reached, the 
contract may be treated as fraudulent by the buyer. If the reserve price is not reached, 
however, although the seller may have wrongly bid himself, no one will have suffered 
damage so as to entitle him to sue the seller.
Auction sale expressly advertised without reserve
The effect of an express notification that the sale will be without reserve is left obscure 
by the Act. It is at any rate clear that s. 57(2) prevents any contract of sale coming into 
existence if the auctioneer refuses to accept a bid. There remains the possibility that the 
auctioneer may be held liable on the basis that he has contracted to sell the goods to the 
highest bidder, a device sanctioned by the Court of Exchequer Chamber in Warlow v 
Harrison.167 The difficulties of this case have been explored by two learned writers.168 
Put briefly, these are (a) the fact that the highest bidder cannot be identified until the 
hammer has fallen, and we are postulating a case where the auctioneer has not accepted 
any bid and (b) the apparent lack of consideration for the auctioneer’s promise. Neither 
of these seems to be a fatal objection, for the person who had made the highest bid when 
the goods were withdrawn should prima facie be able to claim that he was the highest 
bidder, and a rather generous approach to the requirement of consideration is a feature 
common to most cases of breach of warranty of authority by an agent, as, for example, 
in Collen v Wright.169 In Scotland consideration is not required in any event. Moreover, 
the decision in Warlow v Harrison has been affirmed by the Court of Appeal in Barry v 
Heathcote Ball & Co (Commercial Auctions) Ltd.170
Bidding agreements
Certain undesirable auction practices by buyers are dealt with by the Auctions (Bidding 
Agreements) Act 1969. The purpose of this Act (and the earlier Act of 1927 of the same 
name) is to prevent dealers from agreeing to abstain from bidding at a sale so that goods 
may be purchased at less than their true value if no other party is interested in bidding. 
Section 3 of the 1969 Act provides that where such an agreement is made the seller may 
avoid the contract and recover the goods or, in default, any loss he has suffered (namely 
the difference between the sale price and the true or fair price) from any party to the 
agreement. It is, however, difficult in practice to control these bidders’ ‘rings’ because 
of problems of proof. Moreover, the Act does not prohibit a genuine agreement to buy 
the goods on joint account and, in practice, it may well be difficult to distinguish such

Mistake in the offer or acceptance
English law
Certain kinds of mistake, although traditionally treated as part of the generic subject 
‘mistake’ (as they were in the first edition of this book), are today often treated as part 
of the law of offer and acceptance. These cases, usually referred to nowadays as cases of 
‘mutual’ and ‘unilateral’ mistake, involve a denial by one of the parties that an agreement 
has ever been reached on the ground that the intentions of the parties, judged objectively 
or subjectively as the case may be, never coincided. However, the expressions ‘mutual 
mistake’ and ‘unilateral mistake’ are somewhat misleading. The important question is 
not whether a mistake is one-sided or two-sided, but whether or not the mistake has pre-
vented an agreement from coming into existence. In deciding whether the parties have 
in fact agreed, or must be taken in law to have agreed, the first thing to determine is 
whether it is a case where the parties’ intentions are to be judged objectively or subjec-
tively, for until this is done it is obviously impossible to say whether the intentions are the 
same, and hence whether the parties have agreed.
Where neither party is aware of the other party’s real intentions, the law is clear that 
the offeree is entitled to judge the offeror’s intentions objectively. If, so judged, the inten-
tions coincide, then there is an agreement, and, if the other requirements of the law are 
satisfied, a contract. For example, in Tamplin v James,172 the defendant agreed to buy a 
public house under a mistaken impression that a certain field was included in the sale. 
There was nothing in the sale which should have led the buyer to make this mistake, and 
the seller was unaware of it. Applying the objective, reasonable man test, the Court of 
Appeal held that the buyer was liable on the contract for the sale of the public house 
without the field. The objective test in these cases means no more than that the parties 
are bound by what a reasonable man would have regarded as their intentions.
It may happen that even on the application of the objective test it is still not possi-
ble to spell out any definite contractual agreement between the parties and in such a 
case there is no contract. For example, in Raffles v Wichelhaus,173 the plaintiff agreed 
to sell and the defendant agreed to buy a consignment of cotton ex Peerless from 
Bombay. In fact, there were two ships of that name, one leaving Bombay in October 
and the other in December. The plaintiff shipped by the one leaving in December. It

	 40	 Nature and formation of the contract of sale
was pleaded by the defendant that the ship mentioned in the agreement and intended 
by the defendant was the one which sailed in October. The plaintiff demurred to this 
plea, thereby admitting the ambiguity as to which ship was intended by the agreement, 
and the court held that the buyer was not liable for refusing to accept the consignment 
arriving in the later ship.
In such circumstances, the main practical reason for holding that there is no contract 
is that the ‘agreement’ is incapable of being enforced by the courts because its meaning is 
not sufficiently certain. The requirement of certainty, while it may for reasons of conven-
ience be treated independently, is really no more than a requirement that an offer must 
be certain in order to be capable of being converted into a contract by acceptance.174
It only remains to add that cases in which the contract will be held void on these 
grounds are necessarily rare for the application of the objective test will usually produce 
a definite result. The contract will nearly always be held binding on the terms intended 
by one party or the other. This is not always a wholly reasonable or fair result because, 
in the case of a genuine misunderstanding, there is something to be said for compromis-
ing on the terms intended by the parties.175 But the courts rarely regard themselves free to 
achieve such results.176
Where, on the other hand, one party is aware, or ought reasonably to be aware, that 
the other party’s intentions are not the same as his own, the mistaken party’s intentions 
cannot be judged objectively and the party who is not mistaken cannot hold the other to 
a contract on the terms intended by him. There is no justification for permitting a per-
son to assume that the other meant what he said where the former knows that the latter 
did not mean what he said. Thus in the famous case of Smith v Hughes,177 the defendant 
bought some oats from the plaintiff but refused to take delivery on the grounds that 
the oats were not old, as he had thought, but new oats. The judge left to the jury the 
question as to whether the plaintiff had believed the defendant to believe that he was 
contracting for old oats, and directed them that if they answered that question affirm-
atively, they should find for the defendant.178 In ordering a new trial on the ground of 
misdirection, the court drew a distinction between these two possibilities:
1	 If the defendant mistakenly thought that the goods were old then, in the absence of 
warranty by the plaintiff, the defendant would be bound by the contract even though 
the plaintiff was aware of the mistake.
2	 On the other hand, if the defendant mistakenly thought that the plaintiff was offering 
to sell him the oats as old oats, and the plaintiff was aware of the mistake, then the 
defendant would not be liable for refusing to accept the oats.
174	 In Scriven v Hindley [1913] 3 KB 564, another case of sale of goods, hemp and tow was sold at an auction 
by the plaintiffs in bales bearing identical markings. The defendants bid an extravagant price for a lot of 
tow, believing it was hemp. It was held that the supposed sale could not be enforced against them.

178	 This complicated question is really only a reflection of the proposition that promises should be enforced in 
the sense in which the promisor understands the promisee to take them – Paley’s Moral Philosophy (1809 
edn), p. 106 et seq. Paley cites the case of the tyrant Temores (Tamberlance), who, having promised the 
inhabitants of Sebastia that if they surrendered to him no blood would be shed, buried them alive.

	
	 	
The contract of sale	 41
Precisely why he would not have been liable is more difficult to say. One explanation 
would be that, in this event, there would have been a binding contract to sell old oats 
and, the oats not being old, the defendant would have been entitled to reject them. But 
another possibility is that in this event the agreement really would have been void.
Similar uncertainty surrounds the decision in Hartog v Colin & Shields179 where the 
plaintiff snapped up an offer to sell hare skins at so much per pound when he must have 
known that the offeror really meant to offer to sell at that price per piece. It was held 
that the plaintiff could not sue on a contract at the per pound price, but it is not certain 
what would have happened if the offeror had tried to sue on a contract at the per piece 
price. The answer would presumably depend on whether the offeror had reasonably 
understood the offeree to be accepting his intended offer, as opposed to the erroneous 
offer actually stated, or written.
The principle to be applied in cases of mistake as to the person is exactly the same, 
although the application of this principle in this case is more likely to make the contract 
void. First, a person cannot accept an offer which he knows is not intended for him, but 
for some third person.180 And, secondly, a person cannot hold another to an acceptance 
when he knows that that other was intending to accept an offer not made by him, but 
by some third person.181 Knowledge of the mistake by the one party is essential if the 
contract is to be held void. It cannot be said that one party is simply unable to accept an 
offer not intended for him, for a person can accept an offer not intended for him if he 
reasonably thinks it was so intended.182
It is also essential that there should be some identifiable third person for whom the 
offer or acceptance was intended if the contract is to be held void.183 For if there is no 
such third person, the usual analysis is that the mistaken party does intend to contract 
with the other party although he is mistaken as to his attributes.184
These principles all go back to the late nineteenth century, if not earlier, and are 
well illustrated by two leading cases from that period which have caused trouble ever 
since. In Cundy v Lindsay,185 a swindler named Blenkarn ordered some goods from the 
plaintiffs in a letter in which he signed his name so as to resemble that of Blenkiron & 
Co, a firm known to the plaintiffs. Although the address of Blenkarn was not the same 
as that of Blenkiron & Co, they were both in the same street. The plaintiffs, without 
noticing the discrepancy in the street number, despatched the goods to Blenkarn, who 
promptly disposed of them to the defendants, who bought in good faith and for value. 
It was held by the House of Lords that no contract existed between the plaintiffs and 
Blenkarn, and the case had to be decided as though Blenkarn had stolen the goods; at 
no stage had the plaintiffs voluntarily decided to entrust the possession of their goods

to Blenkarn. On the other hand, in King’s Norton Metal Co v Edridge,186 a swindler 
ordered goods under a false name, which was not that of any identified third party, and 
the plaintiffs despatched these goods on credit on the strength of the order. Once again 
the swindler disposed of the goods to the defendants. The Court of Appeal rejected the 
plaintiffs’ claim on the ground that this was a simple case of a contract voidable for 
fraud and not a contract wholly void. And it is, of course, old and well-established law 
that goods obtained under a voidable title and resold to a bona fide purchaser cannot 
be claimed back by the original owner. The bona fide purchaser obtains a good title, 
and the original owner is left to pursue his remedy against the fraudulent party, for 
what that is worth – which is usually very little. The distinction between these two 
famous cases was considered by the House of Lords in Shogun Finance Ltd v Hudson,187 
discussed below.
The application of these cases to situations where parties have dealt with each other 
face to face has proved particularly troublesome. In Phillips v Brooks,188 a swindler 
bought some jewellery in a shop by representing himself to be ‘Sir George Bullough’, 
a real third person known by name, but not personally, to the jeweller. It was held 
that there was a voidable contract. On the other hand, in Ingram v Little,189 a different 
result was arrived at. Here, a swindler (H) representing himself to be a certain PGMH 
of Caterham, a real person not known personally to the plaintiffs, bought a car from 
them. The Court of Appeal (Devlin LJ dissenting) held that there was no contract at 
all between the plaintiffs and H. Sellers LJ summarised the views of the learned judge 
below, with which he agreed, as follows:
The judge, treating the plaintiffs as the offerors and the rogue H as the offeree, found that 
the plaintiffs, in making their offer to sell the car not for cash but for a cheque … were 
under the belief that they were dealing with, and therefore making their offer to, the honest 
Mr PGMH of Caterham, who they had reason to believe was a man of substance and 
standing. H, the offeree, knew precisely what was in the minds of the two ladies [i.e. the 
plaintiffs] for he had put it there, and he knew that their offer was intended for Mr PGMH 
of Caterham, and that they were making no offer to, and had no intention to contract with 
him, as he was. There was no offer which he, H, could accept, and therefore there was no 
contract.190
However, in Lewis v Averay,191 yet another case of a similar nature in which a swin-
dler bought a car in return for a cheque by representing himself to be a well-known 
television star, the Court of Appeal threw doubt on Ingram v Little. In this case, the 
court emphasised that where parties are dealing with each other face to face there is a 
strong presumption that there is a contract between them. But only Lord Denning MR 
suggested that Ingram v Little was wrongly decided. It was also said to be surprising if 
the result of such cases was to turn, as suggested by Sellers LJ in Ingram v Little, on the 
swindler’s state of mind.

The contract of sale	 43
The distinctions drawn in some of these cases are very fine ones; for instance, Ingram 
v Little is scarcely distinguishable from Phillips v Brooks and Lewis v Averay. So too, 
Cundy v Lindsay is barely distinguishable from King’s Norton Metal Co v Edridge. Of 
course, fine distinctions do not necessarily mean that the distinctions are inherently 
unsound. It is the business of the law to draw distinctions and fine distinctions are often 
a necessary consequence. But these cases involve fine distinctions which are based on 
abstract concepts rather than on real social or commercial distinctions. It is, of course, 
clear that the only purpose of drawing these distinctions is to decide whether the con-
tract is void or voidable and hence whether or not a bona fide purchaser should be pro-
tected. But whether or not the bona fide purchaser should be protected should depend 
on more substantial considerations than those which decide these cases. It is true that 
distinctions can be drawn between these cases which to some degree are more real than 
those which the courts drew. For instance, in Phillips v Brooks, the plaintiff was a shop-
keeper who dealt in jewellery, whereas in Ingram v Little, the plaintiffs were two private 
sellers. Plainly, a shopkeeper who sells goods on credit to someone not known to him 
by sight and accepts a cheque in return is, in many respects, in a very different situation 
from a private seller. On the other hand, the plaintiff in Lewis v Averay was also a pri-
vate seller and yet he was held not protected. Equally, in comparing Cundy v Lindsay 
with the King’s Norton case, it is clear that the sellers in the latter case consciously took 
a much greater commercial risk than the sellers in the former case. In the King’s Norton 
case, the sellers fulfilled an order by delivering goods on credit to a company of whom 
they had never heard and without any attempt to secure payment in advance. In Cundy 
v Lindsay, the sellers did at least think they were dealing with buyers known to them 
by repute. These distinctions may well be valid and they may even have influenced the 
actual decisions, but they are not the distinctions drawn by the courts.192
These cases were reviewed by the House of Lords in Shogun Finance Ltd v Hudson,193 
in which the authority of Cundy v Lindsay194 was affirmed in a majority decision. In 
that case, a rogue, who had stolen the identity of a real person, a Mr Patel, purported 
to enter into a hire-purchase agreement in Mr Patel’s name to finance the purchase of a 
motor car, with the plaintiff finance company. The plaintiffs carried out the usual credit 
status checks on Mr Patel, and accepted the purported proposal of Mr Patel. The dealer 
then allowed the rogue to take possession of the vehicle, and the rogue sold it to the 
defendant, who bought it in good faith and without notice. It was held by the majority 
that there was no contract between the rogue and the finance company; the only agree-
ment that could have been in existence was the purported one between the finance com-
pany and Mr Patel. Accordingly, the defendant could not acquire title under s. 27 of the 
Hire-Purchase Act 1964.195 Lord Nicholls and Lord Millett delivered strong dissenting 
speeches, and considered the decisions in Phillips v Brooks Ltd and Lewis v Averay pref-
erable to that in Cundy v Lindsay. Lord Millett would have been prepared to overrule  
192	 The HL decision in Shogun Finance v Hudson n. 27 above has scarcely improved matters. Though it does 
seem that Lewis v Averay may have been wrongly decided as Cundy v Lindsay (a HL decision) was not 
cited.

	 44	 Nature and formation of the contract of sale
Cundy v Lindsay, Ingram v Little and the rather unsatisfactory decision in Hector v 
Lyons.196 The result of the majority holding is that the law of mistake in England and 
Wales requires a distinction to be drawn between dealings in writing, and face-to-face 
dealings.
Proposals were made to abolish the distinction between void and voidable contracts, 
and to protect the bona fide purchaser in both cases alike.197 But these proposals were 
not implemented, and, even if they had been, it is not clear that they would wholly dis-
pose of the difficulties. So long as a person from whom goods are stolen is to be enti-
tled to recover his goods even from a bona fide purchaser to whom the thief may resell 
them, it will be necessary to distinguish between cases where the goods have been so 
stolen and cases where the original owner has been deprived of the goods by fraud or 
deception of some kind. Frauds and deceptions take a very large variety of forms, and 
it will almost certainly remain necessary to draw fine distinctions between fraud which 
does not, and fraud which does, totally negative the owner’s consent to parting with the 
goods. It is true that the line between the cases could be drawn a little beyond where it is 
now drawn; it could (for instance) be so drawn that a bona fide purchaser obtains title 
where the owner has voluntarily entrusted the goods to the swindler, or where he has 
voluntarily parted with the possession of them. The second formulation would probably 
be wide enough to protect the third party in a Cundy v Lindsay situation, though the 
first might not. But it will remain necessary to distinguish cases of voluntary parting 
with possession from cases of fraud or deception so great that the owner is deprived of 
his possession without really consenting at all. Thus fine distinctions will almost inevita-
bly remain here unless the law is so drastically reformed that even a bona fide purchaser 
from an actual thief is allowed protection, and that raises many doubts. It has never been 
proposed as a serious suggestion here.198
Scots law
As with the law in England and Wales, the objective approach to questions of agreement lim-
its the scope for pleas of error in Scots law, so that, for example, when parties differed over 
whether a contract for the supply of a piano was one of sale or hire-purchase, it was held to 
be the former, applying an objective approach to the words used, rather than to be void for 
dissensus. Lord President Dunedin let fall a famous dictum: ‘Commercial contracts cannot 
be arranged by what people think in their inmost minds. Commercial contracts are made 
according to what people say.’199 But at common law error and fraud are grounds of invalid-
ity for any contract entered into as a result of either. On one view, fraud has been subsumed 
196	 Unsatisfactory because the facts were unclear. The best explanation for the decision would have been the 
maxim ‘He who comes to equity must come with clean hands’ as the plaintiff, who was seeking specific 
performance of a contract for the purchase of a house, had forged his son’s signature – see Shogun Finance 
Ltd v Hudson n. 185 above per Lord Walker at [192].
197	 See the Twelfth Report of the Law Reform Committee, discussed below, p. 340.
198	 But see criticism of the Sale of Goods (Amendment) Act 1994, p. 381 et seq., and there is something to be

Hudson (above) by Lord Millett at [84].

The contract of sale	 45
in error as a ground for invalidating a contract.200 Conventional wisdom, however, sees fraud 
as an independent ground making a contract annullable (or voidable).201 The effect of error is 
one of the great unresolved controversies of Scots law. Mutual error is recognised: so where 
in a sale of coping stone where the price was 1s. 9d ‘per foot’, and the seller believed this to 
require measurement by superficial foot, while the buyer thought it meant lineal foot, the 
court held that there was no contract.202
Unilateral error has been more difficult. The conventional view is that error induced 
by another party’s misrepresentation causing the first party to enter the contract, gen-
erally makes the resultant contract annullable (or voidable), but that where the error is 
‘essential’ or ‘in the substantials’ – for example, an error as to the identity of the party 
with whom one is contracting where that identity is of the essence of the contract – it 
is absolutely null (or void).203 Where a party enters a contract under such essential error 
induced by fraud, the contract may be absolutely null (or void).204 But the late T. B. Smith 
propounded the view that even essential error in this sense did not necessarily render the 
contract null or void, but only annullable or voidable.205
Uninduced or unilateral error in general does not give rise to any invalidity: ‘there must 
be “error plus”, that is error with some other factor’ (e.g., misrepresentation by the other 
party, innocent or fraudulent).206 However, there is some authority that, if a negotiating party 
knows that the other is in error and takes advantage of that to procure a better bargain for 
himself, then the contract is reducible.207 The limits on this, which must exist,208 may perhaps 
be found in concepts of the risks accepted by reasonable persons in the circumstances, or 
of good and bad faith.209 The classic example is the second-hand book which is much more 
valuable than the seller’s price. The buyer is entitled to the book at the marked price because 
the loss is one of the risks of the second-hand book trade falling squarely on the seller; in 
using superior knowledge, the buyer is not in bad faith.
Another view is that uninduced error only has effect if it is in transaction, that is, 
relates to the provisions of the contract or to the context which has produced the con-
tract.210 Thus, if a contract for the sale of a painting provides that the seller-artist is 
Picasso, and he is not, so that at least one of the parties must be in error on the ­matter, 
that party can have the contract annulled.211 But if one party simply bought in the belief

that the seller-artist was Picasso, without that having been the subject of negotiation 
between the parties or a term of the contract, then the contract is valid despite the 
buyer’s error, which is merely in motive and thus requires misrepresentation by the other 
to have effect. Again, if party A knows from negotiations that B will not sell her painting 
for under £10,000, and B by slip of the pen offers to sell for £1,000, the latter can reduce 
or annul the contract produced by A’s acceptance of that offer; whereas if A offered 
£1,000, knowing, as B did not, that the painting was worth £10,000, the contract would 
stand.212 Similarly, if B offered her painting for sale at £1,000, and A knew it was worth 
£10,000, B could not subsequently challenge the sale at the former figure; A is entitled in 
the circumstances to assume that B would sell at that price.
Error as to identity and fraud have become important in practice again as a result of 
the growth of buying on the Internet, where, famously, you can be the person you want 
to be and nobody knows you are a dog.213 Since the success of e-commerce is probably 
even more dependent than its real-time, hard-copy counterpart on mutual trust and con-
fidence between the contracting parties, the freedom of identity in cyberspace presents 
significant difficulties.
How would Shogun Finance v Hudson be decided under the doctrines of fraud and 
error in the Scots law of contract? As we have seen, while fraud generally makes a con-
tract annullable or voidable, many think it capable of making a contract null or void if it 
gives rise to error in the essentials or substantials of the contract, which may include the 
identity of the other party to the contract. The classic case is Morrisson v Robertson,214 
where the rogue Telford represented to Morrisson, the seller of cows, that he (T) was 
the son of Wilson of Bonnyrigg, a creditworthy figure, and wished to buy the cows on 
Wilson’s behalf. Having obtained possession of the cows on credit, T sold and delivered 
them to Robertson, who was in good faith. It was held in a case between M and R that 
the contract between M and T was void for error of identity and that accordingly R had 
no title to retain the cows against M.
Morrisson v Robertson is, however, controversial and has never been followed. It 
was approved, but distinguished, in MacLeod v Kerr,215 which in some ways is equiva-
lent to the English cases such as Ingram v Little and Lewis v Averay. Kerr sold his car 
to a rogue who paid with a bouncing cheque. By the time Kerr discovered the fraud, 
the rogue had sold the car to a good faith third party. Here the contract between the 
seller and the rogue was held to be merely voidable, and the third party acquired good 
title under s. 23 of the Sale of Goods Act. Where in Morrisson the real identity of 
the rogue had been material to the contract (no sale would have taken place had the 
true identity been known), in MacLeod the seller intended to sell to whoever was in 
front of him, and the actual identity was not material. The distinction is somewhat 
thin, and the court was clearly moved by a preference for the third party as against

T. B. Smith launched a fundamental re-analysis of Morrisson v Robertson, in 
order to remove it as an obstacle to his contention that essential error generally 
made a contract annullable or voidable, rather than null or void. In Smith’s argu-
ment, M got his cows back, not because his contract with T was void, but because 
he had never ceased to be owner of them. He had intended to make Wilson of Bonn-
yrigg the owner, and T was therefore no more than a thief, having been an agent for 
their delivery to W.216 Since the cows in T’s hands were stolen goods, a vitium reale 
attached to them and prevented T transferring ownership to R. The result was to be 
explained by the law of property rather than the law of contract. Smith developed 
a further argument, fundamentally distinguishing between the validity of a contract 
of sale and the validity of a transfer of property under or following the contract. 
Unlike English law, the nullity of the underlying contract did not automatically 
entail the nullity of a conveyance of ownership. Thus property might be transferred 
despite the nullity or voidness of the underlying contract, because the transferee as 
possessor even if the contract is null is presumed to be the owner. Traditionibus non 
nudis pactis dominia rerum transferuntur.217 It should be noted, however, that not all 
have been persuaded by this argument.218
Applying these analyses to the facts of Shogun v Hudson, or e-commerce cases 
where a rogue uses the identity of another to obtain goods on credit, the transaction 
between the supplier and the rogue is at least annullable for fraud and perhaps error, 
and may even be null if the error as to identity is found to be essential or in the sub-
stantials. Possibly which of these is the outcome matters less if we can, as Smith and 
others have argued, separate the validity of the transfer between the rogue and the 
third party from the validity of the contract between the rogue and his supplier. At 
least in Shogun Lord Hobhouse thought the rogue was a thief; certainly he had appro-
priated goods which he knew the owner intended to transfer to someone else. Many 
Scots lawyers, however, would have greater sympathy with the dissenting positions of 
Lords Nicholls and Millett on the invalidity of the contract, and think Scots law closer 
to the lax continental systems excoriated by Lord Hobhouse than to English law. In 
the particular context this would have meant that the rogue was the debtor under the 
Hire-Purchase Act 1964, and, presumably, someone who could transfer the creditor’s 
title to the goods to a good faith private purchaser. If more generally the validity of 
contract and conveyance are interdependent in Scots law, then the general policy of 
favouring the good faith third party over the deceived seller seems preferable, if only 
to promote the flow of commerce. It is worth noting that the German law praised by 
216	 Smith was able to prove that T had been convicted of theft (see (1967) 12 JLSS 206), thus refuting Lord 
President Clyde in MacLeod v Kerr when he criticised the argument that T was a thief.

	 48	 Nature and formation of the contract of sale
Lord Millett reaches his preferred result by separating contract from transfer of own-
ership; that is, as he notes, the problem is solved in property rather than contract law. 
But it must be admitted that if an electronic seller takes all possible electronic steps to 
check that a prospective electronic purchaser is creditworthy, it has more equities in its 
favour than many of the sellers in the old case law, whose few checks on their buyers 
were really inadequate, even given the difficulties of a pre-computer age.
Doorstep selling
In 1985 the EC promulgated a Directive to protect consumers in respect of contracts 
negotiated away from business premises.219 This Directive was implemented by the Con-
sumer Protection (Cancellation of Contracts Concluded Away from Business Premises) 
Regulations 1987.220 The 1987 Regulations were repealed, to be replaced by The Cancel-
lation of Contracts Made Away from a Consumer’s Home or Place of Work etc. Regu-
lations 2008221 and further superseded (for contracts concluded on or after 13.6.2014) by 
the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regula-
tions 2013.222
The current Regulations apply not only to doorstep selling but to ‘off-premises’ 
contracts more broadly. An off-premises contract is any contract negotiated away from 
the seller’s premises immediately prior to conclusion, concluded either away from the 
seller’s premises, or where the consumer’s offer to enter into the contract was made off 
the seller’s premises.
Where the Regulations apply, they provide for a ‘cooling off’ period of fourteen days 
(extended from seven under the antecedent regimes) during which time the consumer 
may cancel the contract. The consumer must be given written notice of this right and 
how it may be exercised; failure to give this notice will render the contract unenforceable 
against the consumer.
The Regulations application is limited by Reg. 6, which provide that they are only 
applicable to sales of more than £42 and the right of cancellation is excluded in a range 
of circumstances set out in Reg. 28.
Upon cancellation, payments made for the relevant goods and services become repay-
able, and any goods received are returnable. Any credit transaction is also cancelled.
Formalities
Repeal of formal requirements
In 1954 the Law Reform (Enforcement of Contracts) Act repealed s. 4 of the 1893 Act, 
which had been law since the enactment of the Statute of Frauds 1677, with the result 
that nearly all contracts for the sale of goods can now be made by word of mouth, 
219	 85/577/EEC. See also Chapter 22 for an account of the raft of consumer protection legislation now in force.

irrespective of the value of the goods sold. In this way English law was brought into line 
with Scots law, which since the seventeenth century at latest has treated sale of goods 
as an entirely consensual contract, not requiring any writing or other formality to have 
validity.
Section 4 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 enacts:
(1)	 Subject to this and any other Act, a contract of sale may be made in writing (either with or 
without seal), or by word of mouth, or partly in writing and partly by word of mouth, or 
may be implied from the conduct of the parties.
(2)	 Nothing in this section affects the law relating to corporations.
Since the repeal of the old s. 4, the opening words of the above section have lost any 
real meaning as there are no other provisions in the Act relating to formalities. The 
only exceptions which need to be noted to the general effect of s. 4 are contracts of 
hire-purchase or credit-sale, which come within the provisions of the Consumer Credit 
Act 1974, ‘off premises’ contracts under Reg. 4 of Consumer Contracts (Information, 
Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013, and contracts for the purchase 
of a British ship or of a share therein, which come within s. 16 of and Sch. 1, para. 2 to 
the Merchant Shipping Act 1995.223
It is possible, in principle, that a contract for the sale of goods may sometimes also be 
a contract for the sale of an interest in land within s. 2 of the Law of Property (Miscella-
neous Provisions) Act 1989, or s. 1 of the Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995, 
and may therefore be void if it is not in writing.
This possibility arises from the fact that ‘goods’ as defined by s. 61 of the Sale of 
Goods Act includes ‘emblements, industrial growing crops, and things attached to or 
forming part of the land which are agreed to be severed before sale or under the contract 
of sale’. There can be little doubt that this definition embraces certain goods, fructus 
naturales (wildlife and naturally occurring and cultivated crops), which at common law 
were regarded as being an interest in land. The fact that since 1893 these are ‘goods’ 
within the meaning of the Sale of Goods Act does not rule out the possibility that they 
may at the same time be land within the meaning of the Law of Property (Miscellaneous 
Provisions) Act or of the Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act.224
Bills of sale
A further word needs to be said on bills of sale within the Bills of Sale Acts.225 Strictly 
speaking, these Acts do not require a contract of sale to which they apply to be in writ-
ing or in any particular form. There is nothing to prevent a person buying goods under 
an oral contract and allowing the seller of them to remain in possession of them, so 
far as the Bills of Sale Acts are concerned. But in practice a buyer who does not obtain 
223	 Section 16 and Sch. 1, para. 2 (1).
224	 See Hudson, ‘Goods or Land?’ (1982) 22 Conv 137. But the title of this article is somewhat misleading, 
because the question is not, ‘goods or land?’, but rather, ‘goods only, or goods and land?’ The replacement 
of the relevant 1925 Act provisions by the 1989 Act makes no difference to this question. In Scotland see Paul 
v Cuthbertson (1840) 2 D 1286, Morison v Lockhart 1912 SC 1017, and Munro v Liquidator of Balnagown 
Estates Co 1949 SC 49.
225	 Noted above, at pp. 16–18 when distinguishing from contracts of sale. Note the Bills of Sale Acts have never 
applied in Scotland.

	 50	 Nature and formation of the contract of sale
possession of the goods would almost invariably wish to have some written evidence of 
the sale and if the sale is in writing, or is evidenced in writing (even by a mere receipt), 
the Acts will apply.
Under the Act of 1878, a sale of goods which is evidenced in writing, and under which 
the seller remains in possession, is void against trustees in bankruptcy and persons seiz-
ing goods in judicial execution, unless the sale is made by a written instrument called a 
bill of sale and registered in accordance with the Act.226 No particular form is required 
for a bill of sale under the Act of 1878. But a breach of this Act does not affect the valid-
ity of a sale as between the immediate parties to it; the sale itself remains completely 
valid between the parties.
The above provisions only apply if the first transaction is a genuine sale. If it only 
takes the form of a sale but is intended to operate as a security, the Sale of Goods Act 
does not apply at all by reason of s. 62(4). Such a transaction is covered by s. 8 of the 
Bills of Sale Act 1882, which makes the transaction completely void, even as between the 
immediate parties, unless it is made by a registered bill of sale.227 Moreover, a bill of sale 
by way of security must be made in the form prescribed in the Schedule to the Act of 
1882 and failure to comply again renders the bill wholly void.
The two Acts were designed for quite different purposes. The 1878 Act was designed 
to protect third parties, while the second Act was an early sort of consumer protection 
measure intended to protect needy borrowers who gave charges over household posses-
sions and such like in the late Victorian period, often on terribly harsh terms. So the 
1882 Act was a major interference with freedom of contract, which forced lenders to use 
the statutory form of bill of sale and so prevented them from inserting into the contract 
their own contractual clauses.
The two purposes of the Acts – the protection of third parties, and consumer 
protection – were somewhat confused in these Acts by the fact that the first Act applied 
to outright sales, and the second to sales which were designed to be security for loans. 
In fact third parties require protection in both cases – indeed, more often in the second 
than in the first. An owner of goods who grants a charge or mortgage over them, while 
retaining possession, has been put in a position in which he can easily mislead third 
parties as to his assets, and if he becomes insolvent, it is often unfair that the third 
parties may receive nothing, while the chargee simply claims all the goods by virtue 
of some secret document. Because the Acts are so easily evaded, this part of the law 
remains a serious problem and requires reform, as we shall see later. Thus the 1878 Act 
really needs to be replaced by more up-to-date legislation.
The second main purpose of the Acts – consumer protection of small borrowers 
and credit users – was also largely a failure, and the Acts were superseded, first by the 
Moneylenders Acts, and now by the Consumer Credit Act 1974 (now itself partially 
superseded). So far as this purpose is concerned, therefore, the Acts could now safely be 
repealed.

The contract of sale	 51
Neither act worked well and both are largely obsolete in practice. The two Acts were 
found excessively technical in application, so that alternative legal methods were devised
of achieving the objects of the parties through transactions, which did not come within 
either of the Acts. In particular, the invention of the hire-purchase contract very soon 
rendered both Acts largely obsolete. In modern times, the Acts rarely apply except by 
accident, that is to say, parties rarely knowingly enter into a transaction intending it to 
be governed by the Acts, but technical infringements of the Acts remain a common legal 
problem.

Subject-matter of the contract
Meaning of ‘goods’
The term ‘goods’ is defined by s. 61 as including ‘all personal chattels other than things 
in action and money’, or, for Scots law, ‘all corporeal moveables except money’. The 
term includes ‘emblements, industrial growing crops, and things attached to or forming 
part of the land which are agreed to be severed before sale or under the contract of sale’.1
This definition is extensive – indeed, virtually all-embracing2 – but there are neverthe-
less some ‘things’ which do not, or may not, fall within this definition. First, the defini-
tion clearly excludes non-physical items, such as company shares, which are technically 
‘things in action’ or incorporeal moveables and so are excluded by the plain words of 
the definition. Similarly, items of ‘intellectual property’ such as copyrights, patents and 
trade marks are not ‘personal chattels’ or corporeal moveables and so fall outside the 
definition, although of course goods may exist which embody these intellectual property 
rights.3
An important, and still not yet wholly resolved matter, is whether computer soft-
ware and indeed ‘digital content’ of any kind,4 such as music, film and applications for 
smartphones and tablets, constitutes or should be regarded as akin to ‘goods’ within 
the meaning of the Act.5 Today, the problem has two facets, the first relates to the fact 
that software and digital content is now predominantly ‘supplied’ as a download. As 
merely a licensed artistic work, it has none of the characteristics of a chattel and a sale 
of it is categorically not within the scope of the Act, even though, as will be seen below, 
if the same content were acquired on physical media, this would be regarded as a sale 
of goods within the scope of the Act. This disparity leaves the buyer of digital content 
with potentially little protection beyond that afforded by the contract under which the 
	1	 Emblements were growing crops sown by a tenant for life which his personal representatives had the right to 
take. They were personal property. In Scotland see Boskabelle Ltd v Laird [2006] CSOH 173; 2006 SLT 1079.
	2	 The difficult question as to whether forms of energy such as gas and electricity are goods has not come 
before a court in the UK. In Singer Co, Link Simulation Systems Div v Baltimore Gas and Electricity 
Company 558 A 2d 419 it was held that electricity in an electricity company’s distribution system was not 
a ‘good’ within §2-105 of the Uniform Commercial Code (so that the company were not liable under the 
Sales Article for electrical failures), and this corresponds to similar decisions in other states. Given that the 
definition of ‘goods’ in the above section is if anything broader than that in the Sale of Goods Act, it could 
well be that a court in the UK would come to a similar conclusion. However, electricity is a ‘good’ for the 
purposes of product liability.
	3	 By contrast, for the purposes of the Law of Property Act 1925 ‘property’ is defined so as to include 
intellectual property – s. 205(1)(xx).
	4	 See Southwark London Borough Council v IBM UK Ltd [2011] EWHC 549 (TCC) in which Akenhead J expressed 
that all such content could be regarded as sufficiently similar in nature to be treated in a like manner.

Subject-matter of the contract	 53
content, or the license to it, is acquired. The rapid obsolescence of physical media has 
led to special provisions in respect of digital content being included in the Consumer 
Rights Act 2015.6 However, the position in respect of a non-consumer buyer of digital 
content remains unchanged and the disparity in protection, which is elaborated below, is 
of some concern.
The other, now largely historical, facet of the problem concerns software and other 
‘digital content’ supplied on some form of durable media, such as a floppy or compact 
disk or solid state drive. Software supplied in this way is usually a ‘composite’ of intel-
lectual property (the code that comprises software is protected as a literary work by 
the law of copyright)7 and the physical media or components on which the software 
was stored/supplied, which could be regarded as goods. The copyright in the software, 
which represented the majority of the value paid for the software by the buyer/licensee, 
was merely licensed by the developer to make working copies of the physical media and 
to load the software onto a computer, acts which otherwise would be infringements of 
copyright.8 The only sale therefore was of the physical media, which is usually of nomi-
nal value and arguably incidental to the contract for the software itself.
The question whether a sale of software sold on physical media was a sale of goods 
was answered both by the Outer House of the Court of Session and by the Court of 
Appeal, in decisions which are now of diminished importance in the light of technolog-
ical advancements but which remain good law and continue to not offer a wholly satis-
factory answer to the question of the status of digital content supplied in this way under 
the Act. In Beta Computers (Europe) Ltd v Adobe Systems (Europe) Ltd,9 the defender 
had ordered from the pursuer by telephone a standard computer package to upgrade 
its existing software. The software was delivered in a package which bore the words 
‘Opening the Informix S.I. software package indicates your acceptance of these terms 
and conditions’. These were the terms and conditions of Informix’s copyright licence, 
Informix being the proprietor of the software. The defender did not open the package 
but attempted to return it. The pursuer refused to accept its return, and sued for payment 
of the price. The pursuer argued that it had supplied exactly what was ordered, and that 
it was not concerned with the terms of the licence imposed by the authors of the soft-
ware. The defender argued that acceptance of the licence conditions was an implied con-
dition suspensive of its agreement with the pursuer. Lord Penrose held that the supply of 
proprietary software for a price was a single contract sui generis though it contained ele-
ments of contracts such as sales of goods and the grant of a licence. It was an essential 
feature of such a contract that the supplier undertook to make available to the purchaser 
both the medium on which the program was recorded and the right to access and use the 
software. There could be no consensus ad idem until the conditions of use stipulated by 
the copyright owner were produced and accepted by the parties, which could not occur 
	6	 This is considered in detail in Chapter 22.
	7	 The level of copyright protection afforded to computer software is governed by the Copyright (Computer 
Programs) Regulations 1992, SI 1992/3233, which implement the Software Directive 91/250, OJ 1991 
L122/42, 17/5/91, and, inter alia, make certain amendments to the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. 
The Directive has as its object the harmonisation of the level of protection afforded to software by the laws 
of the member states of the EU.

earlier than the tender of those conditions to the purchaser. Furthermore, whether the 
tender of software subject to conditions for use was regarded as a breach of a previously 
unconditional contract, or as being subject to a suspensive condition entitling the pur-
chasers to reject if the conditions for use were unacceptable, or as made when there was 
no concluded contract, the defender was entitled to reject.10
In St Albans City and District Council v International Computers Ltd,11 the facts of 
which are given later,12 both Scott Baker J at first instance and Sir Iain Glidewell in the 
Court of Appeal expressed the view that a computer disk is within the definition of 
‘goods’ contained in s. 61 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 and s. 18 of the Supply of 
Goods and Services Act 1982. A computer program, on the other hand, is not goods. 
However, when a defective program is encoded and supplied on a disk, the supplier of 
the disk will be in breach of the terms as to quality and fitness implied by s. 14 of the 
Sale of Goods Act or s. 9 of the Supply of Goods and Services Act. Accordingly, both 
judges were of the view that a supply of a disk carrying software is either a sale or a 
supply of goods. The two decisions are clearly at odds. Arguably, it is less important to 
worry about how digital content fits into existing legal categories, than what the respec-
tive liabilities of the creator of the content and any intermediary supplier or distributor 
ought to be.13 Once the latter is decided, other questions are relatively straightforward. 
We return to this below.14
In a crucial passage,15 Lord Penrose criticised both the views expressed by Christopher  
Reed,16 to the effect that where software is supplied on a physical medium it should be 
regarded as physical property like a book or a record, and the views expressed by Steyn J 
in Eurodynamics Systems plc v General Automation Ltd,17 that the transfer of software 
is a transfer of a product. Lord Penrose said:
This reasoning appears to me to be unattractive, at least in the context with which this case 
is concerned. It appears to emphasise the role of the physical medium, and to relate the 
transaction in the medium to sale or hire of goods. It would have the somewhat odd result that 
the dominant characteristic of the complex product, in terms of value or of the significant 
interests of parties, would be subordinated to the medium by which it was transmitted to the 
user in analysing the true nature and effect of the contract. If one obtained computer programs 
by telephone, they might be introduced into one’s own hardware and used as effectively as if 
the medium were a disk or CD or magnetic tape.
The basic argument that the rights of the parties should not depend upon the medium 
of supply must be right. But the point has to be made that there is the possibility that 
almost any original copyright work can, now, be delivered either on a physical medium 
or online. Does the fact that the contents of a book can be delivered online, or the image

13	 Even before the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982 the courts tended to treat contracts analogous to 
sales of goods in the same way as sales of goods so far as the implied warranties were concerned – see Young

of a painting, mean that sales of books and paintings must now be treated as sui generis 
and thus outwith the Sale of Goods Act? Surely not: it is a characteristic of many sup-
plies of information that they can either be carried out using goods media, or supplied 
directly online. But, in the case of books, we distinguish the liability of the author from 
that of the shop and publisher. If a book has missing pages, or falls to pieces just after it 
is bought, the shop is clearly liable under the Sale of Goods Act quality warranties, and 
so is the publisher who sold it to the shop. On the other hand, neither is likely to be held 
liable in respect of erroneous information in a reference book.18 This is a useful starting 
point in considering the liability of the various undertakings in the distribution chain for 
software. First of all, however, it may be useful to explore where the analogy between 
books and software breaks down.
Clearly, in one respect digital content is analogous to a book, and if it is physically 
defective, the seller should be liable in the same way as the seller of a physically defective 
book. But there is an important difference when we consider the contents. However defec-
tive the content of a book, it is unlikely to harm its physical environment.19 Software, 
on the other hand, may cause harm, and the probability of this occurring (although 
small) is not insignificant. Defective software containing, say, a virus can do considerable 
damage.20 It has been suggested that an analogy can be drawn between a reference work, 
such as a DIY manual, and software, since software is commonly described as a ‘set of 
instructions to a computer’.21 The analogy is false, however. A computer cannot ‘under-
stand’ in any epistemological sense: it is a machine, and simply follows instructions.22 
This would argue for a more ‘mechanical’ finding of liability in the case of defective 
software.
When software is sold over the counter in stores in the same way as books or music, 
for some sorts of defect the consumer would expect to have a remedy against the store. 
Equally, most stores would likely expect their liability to be the same in both cases. There 
are two broad types of defect where the consumer ought probably to have a remedy 
against the store. The first is where software contains a virus, malware or some other 
unwanted program (or can introduce one), or code likely to impede performance or 
cause damage to the user’s system. Here, the supplier should incur liability equivalent 
to that laid down in the quality warranties of the Sale of Goods Act. The second is 
when the content of the disk may simply be corrupt, just as a book with illegible print-
ing is considered defective. Defects in the way the program itself performs, however, are 
more analogous to defects in the contents of a book, and liability should, in principle, 
be similar.

	 56	 Nature and formation of the contract of sale
Liability for defective software should not, in principle, depend upon the carrier 
medium, but upon whether what is involved is mass-produced ‘off-the-shelf’ software, 
or customised software specially written for a client. It is helpful as a starting point to 
take an example. Suppose an accounting package for small businesses had a defect in its 
program which caused certain items to be under-recorded so that a false picture of the 
profitability of the business emerged over a period of time. Would the software house 
which wrote the program be liable? It might be. We might make it liable on one of two 
bases: negligence in writing the program; or, in the absence of negligence, loss spreading. 
If we adhere to the view that the software house is liable in negligence, we might want 
to make the seller (if any) who sold the software liable as a conduit for passing liability 
back up the line, and achieve this by saying there is a breach of the quality warranties of 
the Sale of Goods Act; but we must be clear that this is what we are doing, and that the 
store’s liability is no greater than the ultimate liability of the supplier. We are not doing 
it simply because, if the program was off-the-shelf software, we think off-the-shelf soft-
ware is goods. On the other hand, if we adopt a loss-spreading approach, we might 
make the store liable as the best loss spreader in the distribution chain, by making it 
liable under the Sale of Goods Act, but strictly speaking on this approach we might not 
want to make the software house liable at all, for the same sort of reasons that we do not 
make the author of a defective cookery book liable if a recipe is wrong.23 In the United 
States, where these issues have been discussed openly by the courts, there is authority for 
this approach.24 This approach to the problem of product liability is probably more open 
than any European court would be able to stomach. They are likely to opt either for a 
fudge, or for what essentially boils down to negligence liability, as a basis for awarding 
damages.
Having regard to the above, it is useful in this context to examine whether there are 
rational policy reasons for the liability imposed on suppliers of services such as the writ-
ing of customised software being less strict than the liability imposed on the supplier of 
mass-produced goods. It can be argued that there are. In the first place, the distinction 
can be justified in terms of a risk-spreading approach. Suppliers of expert services to 
individual customers in the nature of things do not have the high volumes necessary to 
spread the risk amongst a large number of customers, whereas producers of off-the-
shelf software are more likely to.25 Secondly, the customers usually deal directly with the 
providers of the services, and are therefore in a better position to prove negligence than 
is the consumer injured by a defective product.26 Thirdly, the provider of the services 
and the customer are in a position to bargain for the level of liability to be undertaken. 
If nothing is said, the supplier’s duty is only to exercise reasonable care and skill, but 
if a higher level of liability is accepted, as in Saphena Computing Ltd v Allied Collec-
tion Agencies Ltd,27 then so be it. Lastly, the provider of a service which is essentially a 
‘one-off’ is not in a position to test the software in the way in which the manufacturer of 
a mass-produced product is.

Subject-matter of the contract	 57
Conversely, the imposition of a ‘strict’ standard of liability on a supplier for the 
sort of defects in respect of which it was suggested above that a supplier of software 
ought to be liable in much the same way as a bookseller, would seem to be justified 
by precisely the considerations which apply in contracts for the sale of goods gener-
ally. Making the supplier liable is a convenient mechanism for passing liability back 
up the line to the person ultimately responsible for the defect, the manufacturer. But 
whether the manufacturer’s ultimate liability for defects is in fact different from neg-
ligence liability in the Learned Hand sense is questionable. In US v Carroll Towing 
Co,28 which we will return to later,29 Justice Learned Hand suggested that the duty 
of care in negligence is a function of three variables: (1) the probability of harm;  
(2) the gravity of the resulting injury; and (3) the burden of adequate precautions. 
If we build into (3) opportunity costs, we have a fairly good, workable formula for 
understanding the nature of so-called ‘strict’ product liability. Thus, software sold in  
2015 will have technical improvements not present in equivalent packages sold 
in 2000, yet the 2000 packages are not defective even though they might have had 
the 2000 features had the programmers worked at it longer and the software house 
delayed marketing for this purpose. Little software would appear on the market  
if this were not the case, and the opportunity costs of doing without admittedly less 
than perfect software would be great.
In other words, the key to the conundrum is not to get lost in questions as to whether 
or not software is goods, but to focus on who is being sued in respect of what sort of 
defect, and to be clear as to the basis on which liability is being imposed. The imposition 
of liability on the basis of loss spreading is different from the imposition of liability 
on the basis of negligence in the special sense in which it was used above. In Europe, 
generally, liability in this special sense (negligence) is arguably what is accepted under 
the Product Liability Directive,30 and, as suggested above, a shop’s liability for defects 
ought not in principle to be greater than that of the ultimate manufacturer.
The question as to the warranties to be implied in software supply contracts has 
been explored in a number of recent cases. In Watford Electronics Ltd v Sanderson,31 
Judge Thornton QC held that the Sale of Goods Act was not applicable, as the soft-
ware had not been sold, but merely licensed (as is usually the case). However, he held 
that quality warranties could be implied from two sources: there was a contract of 
bailment within s. 6(1) of the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982 because the 
definition of ‘software’ in the contract meant that goods were being supplied. Pos-
session, not ownership, of the software was being transferred subject to a use pay-
ment. This meant that the terms implied by the 1982 Act,32 which are identical to 
those in sales of goods, could be implied. Given that what was being acquired was 
not a medium, but the software itself, this argument is somewhat difficult to follow. 
However, he also held that similar terms to those implied by this Act, and the Sale of 
Goods Act, could be implied at common law. In the light of the views expressed in 
28	 159 F 2d 169 (1947).

Young & Marten Ltd v McManus Childs Ltd,33 this must be correct.34 This issue was 
not pursued further in the Court of Appeal.
The seller’s assertions about the performance of the software will often be crucial. 
These representations may themselves, of course, give rise to a claim for damages for 
material misrepresentation.35
Another modern area of doubt as to the scope of the definition of ‘goods’ has previ-
ously been noted.36 It is not wholly clear whether the term ‘goods’ would cover human 
blood for transfusion or other similar items not ordinarily thought to be the subject of 
commerce.
A further point which requires comment has previously been referred to briefly, but 
remains to be dealt with here. This point concerns the meaning of the latter part of 
the statutory definition. Since the products of the soil must always be sold with a view 
to their ultimate severance ‘under the contract of sale’, it appears that, whether or not 
they are also land within the meaning of s. 2 of the Law of Property (Miscellaneous 
Provisions) Act 1989 or s. 1 of the Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995, they 
are now always goods within the meaning of the Sale of Goods Act. It is, however, still 
necessary to distinguish the products of the soil or ‘things attached to or forming part 
of the land’ on the one hand, from the actual land itself, or interests therein, on the 
other. The sale of sand from a quarry, for example, is not a sale of things attached to 
or forming part of the land, but a sale of an interest in the land itself. Thus, in Morgan 
v Russell,37 it was held that the sale of cinders and slag, which were not in definite or 
detached heaps resting on the ground, was not a sale of goods but a sale of an interest in 
land and, therefore, the Sale of Goods Act did not apply. Similarly, in the Australian case 
of Mills v Stockman,38 a quantity of slate which had been quarried and then left on some 
land as waste material for many years was held to be part of the land, and not goods. 
The slate was ‘unwanted dross cast on one side with the intention that it should remain 
on the land indefinitely, and, by implication, that it should form part of the land’.39 In 
Scotland, a contract with the owner of ground under which the other party gains for a 
period a right to quarry in the ground and remove material found therein, such as rock 
or sand, is conventionally described as a ‘mineral lease’ of the ground rather than as a 
sale of the excavated materials.40 Although this usage has been criticised judicially as 
inapt because the tenant is not merely occupying or using the ground, but consuming or 
taking away part of it,41 it remains in use in practice.

Subject-matter of the contract	 59
Different types of goods
Section 5 of the Act is as follows:
(1)	 The goods which form the subject of a contract of sale may be either existing goods, 
owned or possessed by the seller, or goods to be manufactured or acquired by him after the 
making of the contract of sale, in this Act called ‘future goods’.
(2)	 There may be a contract for the sale of goods, the acquisition of which by the seller 
depends upon a contingency which may or may not happen.
(3)	 Where by a contract of sale the seller purports to effect a present sale of future goods, the 
contract operates as an agreement to sell the goods.
The subject-matter of the contract of sale may be either existing goods owned or pos-
sessed by the seller, or future goods, or (a possibility not mentioned by the Act) a spes, 
or chance.
Existing goods
Little need be said here except to point out that existing goods may be either specific 
or unascertained, and that important consequences follow from this distinction; for 
example, in relation to the application of s. 6 and in connection with the passing of the 
property. These will be discussed later.42
Future goods
Future goods include goods not yet in existence and goods in existence but not yet 
acquired by the seller. For those parts of the Act dealing with the passing of property, it is 
probably safe to say that future goods can never be specific goods within the meaning of 
the Act. There remains some doubt about a number of other sections, such as ss. 6 and 7, 
which apply to contracts for the sale of specific goods. In cases under s. 7 of the Act, 
future goods, if sufficiently identified, may be specific goods in the limited sense that 
their destruction may frustrate the contract. In Howell v Coupland,43 a sale of 200 tons 
of potatoes to be grown on a particular piece of land was held to be a sale of specific 
goods, despite the fact that they were not existing goods, for the purpose of the common 
law rules of frustration. Failure of the crop was thus held to avoid the contract. Since the 
Act was passed, it is largely immaterial whether this result is arrived at by application of 
s. 7 or not because the same result may be arrived at by holding the contract to be a sale 
within s. 5(2) dependent upon a contingency.44
The most important question in connection with future goods, the passing of the 
property, will be dealt with later.45

High Court held (before the enactment of the Sale of Goods Act in New South Wales) that a sale of 
‘about’ 4,000 sheep pastured on certain lands was a sale of specific goods although the sheep were not then 
individually identified.

	 60	 Nature and formation of the contract of sale
A spes
The sale of a spes – a chance – must be distinguished from the contingent sale of future 
goods, though the distinction is not so much as to the subject-matter of the contract 
but as to its construction. Thus, it is possible for a person to agree to buy future goods 
from a particular source and to take the chance (or, in language appropriate to the sale 
of goods, the risk) of the goods never coming into existence. For example, a person may 
agree to buy whatever crop is produced from a particular field at a fixed price. Such 
a transaction comes perilously close to a gamble but, as the seller stands to gain the 
same amount in any event, it appears that the sale cannot be a wager within s. 18 of the 
Gaming Act 1845 or be subject to the now abolished doctrine of sponsiones ludicrae in 
Scotland.46
A transaction such as that in Howell v Coupland is thus open to at least47 three possi-
ble constructions:
1	 It may be a contingent sale of goods within s. 5(2), in which case if the crop does not 
come into existence the contract will not become operative at all and neither party is 
bound.
2	 Alternatively, it may be an unconditional sale – that is, the seller may absolutely 
undertake to deliver the goods, so that in effect he warrants that there will be a crop, 
in which case, if there is no crop, he will be liable for non-delivery.
3	 Thirdly, it may be a sale of a mere chance – that is, the buyer may take the risk of the 
crop failing completely, in which case the price is still payable.
Despite the fact that s. 5, which expressly deals with the subject-matter of the contract, 
classifies the types of subject-matter as either existing or future goods, there is in fact a 
much more important classification which cuts right across this one. This is the distinc-
tion between specific and unascertained goods, which is of the greatest importance in 
connection with the passing of the property and risk in the contract of sale. Specific 
goods are goods ‘identified and agreed on at the time a contract of sale is made’;48 for 
example, this particular car or this particular load of wheat. Unascertained goods are 
not defined by the Act, but they seem to fall into three main categories:
1	 Goods to be manufactured or grown by the seller, which are necessarily future goods.
2	 Purely generic goods; for example, 1,000 tonnes of wheat, or the like, which must 
also be future goods, at least where the seller does not already own sufficient goods 
of the description in question which can be appropriated to the contract. Where the 
seller does own such a quantity of the goods, but the sale is not expressed to be of 
those particular goods but for goods of that generic kind, it is not easy to apply 
the ‘future goods/existing goods’ distinction. In one sense, the goods appear to fall 
within the definition of ‘existing goods’ in s. 5(1) but, on the other hand, until the 
goods are appropriated to the contract, the mere fact that the seller has sufficient

available – see H R & S Sainsbury v Street, above, discussed in more detail below, p. 82.

goods for that purpose seems irrelevant. In either event it seems that nothing turns 
on the distinction.
3	 An unidentified part of a specified whole; for example, 1,000 tonnes out of a particu-
lar load of 2,000 tonnes of wheat; these may be either future or existing goods within 
the meaning of s. 5.
It will be seen that the distinction between the third type of unascertained goods and 
specific goods is only a matter of degree, and in a particular case it may be slight indeed. 
Thus, if A agrees to sell to B 9,000 tonnes of the wheat on a certain ship which is carrying  
10,000 tonnes in all, this is a sale of unascertained goods because they are not identified, 
but it is obvious that such a transaction is more akin to a sale of specific goods than 
with a sale of purely generic goods. It is also true, although less obviously, that the dis-
tinction between the second and third kinds of unascertained goods is only a matter of 
degree. The more detailed is the description of the genus, the more it comes to resemble 
a sale from a specified bulk or stock. It will be seen later that the failure of the Act to 
draw these distinctions has led to unfortunate results. In particular, the classification of 
the third of the above three types as unascertained has led to difficulties in connection 
with the passing of property and risk,49 and also in connection with the doctrine of 
frustration.

The types of obligation created
Fundamental terms
At the time when the old Sale of Goods Act was passed, contractual obligations in Eng-
land and Wales1 were generally thought to fall into two principal classes, namely con-
ditions and warranties. In addition, there existed a body of equitable rules governing 
mere misrepresentations; that is, statements inducing a party to enter into a contract 
which were not subsequently incorporated into the contract itself. In the 1950s and 
1960s, it came to be suggested in a number of decisions that the distinction between a 
condition and a warranty was not exhaustive. This development took two forms. On 
the one hand, it came to be said that there were terms more important even than con-
ditions – fundamental terms. On the other hand, it also came to be said that there was 
a category of terms mid-way between the condition and the warranty – innominate, or 
intermediate terms. Innominate terms are considered further below;2 here we consider 
fundamental terms.
For most practical purposes, it mattered little whether a term was called a condition 
or a fundamental term. In either event, a breach of the term, however minor in itself, 
justified the innocent party in repudiating his own obligations under the contract, and 
treating it as discharged. But the doctrine of the fundamental term was devised princi-
pally to deal with the growing menace of the unfair and unreasonable exemption clause. 
It was held in a large number of decisions that an exemption clause, no matter how 
sweeping and no matter how broadly drafted its language, could not protect a guilty 
party from liability for breach of a fundamental term of the contract.
In 1967, the House of Lords cut down this doctrine in the Suisse Atlantique case.3 
It was held here that the doctrine of the fundamental term was nothing more than a 
rule of construction; an exemption clause was not to be assumed to be drafted so as to 
justify one party in breaking the fundamental terms of the contract. The rule of con-
struction was, no doubt, a strong one; that is, even though the words of an exemption 
clause might appear to be wide enough to cover the events which had occurred, the rule 
would normally be applied, and the words of the exemption clause interpreted so as to 
cover only less drastic breaches. Nevertheless, however strong the rule of construction, 
the logical result of refusing to recognise it as a rule of law was that, in the last resort, 
the parties must be free to make their own contract, however unfair or unpalatable the 
terms might be. So long only as it was absolutely clear that the words of the exemption

The types of obligation created	 63
clause were designed to cover the circumstances that had occurred, no matter how fun-
damental, the courts were obliged to apply the clause.
Some inroads were made on this doctrine by subsequent decisions, but it was clear 
that legislative intervention was called for. In due course this was forthcoming and, first, 
the Supply of Goods (Implied Terms) Act 1973 and, later, the Unfair Contract Terms 
Act 1977 and Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations4 have given the courts a 
substantial degree of control over unfair exemption clauses. The result of these develop-
ments is likely to be that the distinction between fundamental terms and conditions will 
cease to be of much significance. Clauses which are unreasonable can usually be struck 
down, and it will be less necessary for parties to try to persuade the courts to construe 
the exemption clause in a strict way so that it does not cover the breach of a fundamental 
term. However, it cannot be said that the distinction will never be of any importance. 
Given the way lawyers tend to argue cases, it is likely that (unless severely discouraged 
by the courts) they will still usually try to persuade a court that (1) a clause ought not 
to be construed to cover the breach of a fundamental term, and that (2) even if it does 
cover such a breach, it should be held to be unreasonable under the 1977 Act or unfair 
under the Regulations.5 Moreover, as noted above, a purchase of computer software or 
other digital product on durable media is both a sale of the disks etc. and a licence of 
the software. The Unfair Contract Terms Act does not apply to contracts so far as they 
relate to the creation or transfer of a right or interest, inter alia, in a copyright.6 Control 
of exemption clauses in such contracts, therefore, depends on common law. It can be 
argued, however, that this does not prevent the Act from applying to a licence which is 
simply a permission7 and does not create or transfer any interest.8
George Mitchell (Chesterhall) Ltd v Finney Lock Seeds Ltd9 was the first case to reach 
the House of Lords on the reasonableness requirement. In this case, plaintiff farmers 
ordered from the defendants, who were seed merchants, a quantity of ‘Finney’s Late 
Dutch Special Cabbage’ seeds but were unfortunately supplied instead with an inferior 
type of seed, which was, indeed, not a ‘Late’ seed at all, and proved unsuitable to the 
plaintiffs’ needs. A clause limiting the defendants’ liability was held unreasonable for 
reasons which are discussed later.10 But it was also argued that the clause should not be 
construed to apply to the breach which had occurred because the suppliers had delivered 
something quite different from what had been ordered. The House of Lords rejected 
this argument, but in terms suggesting that if indeed the goods supplied had been of a

	5	 It must be noted, however, that in Fastframe Ltd v Lohinski, 3 March 1993 (unreported – discussed by 
Adams (1994) 57 MLR 960), the Court of Appeal expressed strong disapproval of this approach. That case, 
however, involved the construction of a ‘no set-off’ clause, and, as noted below, the approach may retain 
some life where it is arguable that the wrong goods have been supplied.

totally different character (as where beans instead of peas are supplied) it would have 
been accepted.
It seems, then, that the concept of the fundamental term retains a small residuary  
significance.11 Where such a term is breached, a limitation clause will not be construed to  
cover the breach unless this is almost unavoidable. The strong rule of construction which 
also continues to apply to total exclusion clauses (as opposed to limitation clauses)12 
thus seems also to continue to apply to limitation clauses which seek to protect against 
breach of a fundamental term and not merely a breach of condition. This is somewhat 
unfortunate because it means that the courts will continue to have to draw fine and 
somewhat arbitrary distinctions between the ‘peas and beans’ type of case, on the one 
hand, and less drastic departures from the contract such as that between early and late 
cabbage seed, or good quality and cheap quality seed. Inevitably, this means that diffi-
culties will be encountered with other cases as, for example, where a person contracts 
to sell cabbage seed, but supplies beetroot or carrot seed.13 Moreover, these difficulties 
will be almost completely gratuitous, since drawing these distinctions will never dispose 
of the whole case; they will merely decide whether a rule of construction applies, and 
even if it does prima facie apply it may be displaced by other contrary indications, or the 
clause may be declared void under the 1977 Act.
There could be a second type of case in which it might be important to distinguish 
between a fundamental term and a condition. Where there is a complete non-performance 
of the contract, it could be argued that there could be no acceptance, and hence no 
loss of the right to reject goods. The decision of the Court of Appeal in Charterhouse 
Credit Co Ltd v Tolley,14 initially cast doubt on this, however. In this case, it was held 
that the hirer of a car under a hire-purchase agreement had affirmed the contract and 
accepted the goods, despite a fundamental breach by the owner in supplying a car with 
a defective rear axle. And it seems clear that the court contemplated the possibility of a 
buyer ‘accepting’ goods delivered by the seller even where there was a delivery of goods 
wholly different from those sold; for example, a horse instead of a tractor.
However, the decision in Charterhouse Credit v Tolly was overruled the House of 
Lords in Photo Production v Securicor15 and as a result, the proposition previously made 
may now be reasserted. As will be seen later,16 there are circumstances (though they will 
be rare) in which a buyer can be treated as having accepted goods even though he has no 
knowledge of defects in them, but it is arguable that in some of these cases a buyer would 
be held not to have accepted the goods if there has been a breach of a fundamental term, 
although a breach of condition would not help him. For example, suppose that A agrees 
to sell peas to B but sends him beans instead. If B, in ignorance of the substitution but 
11	 On the other hand, where beans are delivered instead of peas it could simply be said that the exemption 
clause is inoperative on the analogy of the Gibaud or ‘four corners’ rule – see Gibaud v Great Eastern 
Railway [1921] 2 KB 426.
12	 See below, p. 202.
13	 In the George Mitchell case counsel in the lower court conceded that the limitation clause would not apply 
in this event, but in the House of Lords the concession was withdrawn. The House did not, however, decide 
whether the concession was correctly withdrawn; nor was it made clear whether (and if so, why) the ‘peas 
and beans’ case differs from the ‘cabbage seed’ and ‘beetroot or carrot seed’ case.

having had an opportunity to examine the goods, resells and delivers the goods to C, it 
seems that B would not thereafter be precluded from rejecting the goods. In the Suisse 
Atlantique case, Lord Reid suggested that such a delivery could not properly be treated 
as a delivery under the original contract at all, but only as an offer to enter into a new 
contract.17 On the other hand, if A had merely been guilty of a breach of condition, 
B would, in such circumstances, have lost his right of rejection under the law prior to 
3 January 1995.18
Otherwise, the principal use of the expression ‘fundamental term’ is in written con-
tracts where draftsmen sometimes use it in preference to ‘condition’ in an attempt to 
make it clear that any breach of such a term will enable the innocent party to terminate.19
Conditions
The term condition is not defined by the Act, but s. 11(3) states that:
Whether a stipulation in a contract of sale is a condition, the breach of which may give rise  
to a right to treat the contract as repudiated, or a warranty, the breach of which may give  
rise to a claim for damages but not to a right to reject the goods and treat the contract as 
repudiated, depends in each case on the construction of the contract; and a stipulation may be 
a condition, though called a warranty in the contract.
This subsection therefore explains the term condition by reference to its legal effect, 
but it does not explain how a condition is to be distinguished from a warranty. It is 
enough here to say that in its usual meaning a condition is a term which, without being 
the fundamental obligation imposed by the contract, is still of such vital importance 
that it goes to the root of the transaction. The importance of a condition in contracts 
for the sale of goods is that its breach, if committed by the seller, may give the buyer the 
right to reject the goods completely and to decline to pay the price, or, if he has already 
paid it, to recover it.20
No doubt this is the usual meaning of the word ‘condition’. If the term is strictly a 
condition, this means that its full performance is a condition of the other party’s obli-
gations; his duties are conditional on the performance of conditions. For example, the 
seller’s statutory implied obligations as to the quality and fitness of the goods, and as to 
their compliance with their description, are all conditions under the Sale of Goods Act, 
both as originally enacted and in its amended form. That means that the duties must 
be strictly complied with by the seller and that any breach of these conditions, however 
trivial, prima facie justifies the buyer in refusing to accept the goods.21
Until 1962, the general opinion was that the distinction between conditions and war-
ranties was exhaustive (at any rate leaving aside fundamental terms which were not 
material to this question). Thus, it was assumed that all contractual terms had to fall 
17	 [1967] 1 AC at 404.

within one class or another and that this distinction could, in principle, be drawn at the 
time when the contract was made. Any term whose breach could possibly take a serious 
form naturally tended to be treated as a condition as a result of this approach. Since 
the distinction related to the terms of the contract and not to the consequences of the 
breach and, indeed, had to be applied in theory as at the date when the contract was 
made, there was a tendency for many terms to be treated as conditions even though, 
in the result, their breach only caused minor inconvenience or loss, or even none at all. 
Only where it could be said at the outset that no breach of a term could ever have really 
serious consequences was it possible to classify the term as a warranty.
The consequence of this was that in the law of sale of goods, the duties of the seller 
were traditionally treated very strictly. Any deviation from the terms implied by the Act 
(as mentioned above) justified the buyer in rejecting the goods. But it was also widely 
assumed by lawyers that there was nothing peculiar in the law of sale or even in the Sale 
of Goods Act with respect to these questions. It was generally thought that, for exam-
ple, the position was the same with respect to all the seller’s duties, whether they were 
implied conditions under the Act or express conditions laid down by the contract.
It will be seen that this approach tended to shut out from consideration as irrelevant the 
actual consequences of a breach of contract. Some breaches, of course, are serious enough 
on any view to justify the other party in repudiating the contract; but many breaches have 
relatively trivial consequences and some have no ill consequences at all. Generally speak-
ing, the law on this point as it was understood until 1962 paid little attention to the actual 
results of a breach of contract. This result possibly favoured the certainty which was – 
especially perhaps in the nineteenth century – regarded as a very important goal of the 
law. Particularly in commercial contracts, it was often necessary that a buyer should be in 
a position to make an instant decision as to whether he would accept goods (or shipping 
documents) delivered under a contract of sale. So long as he could reject the goods for any 
breach of contract (on the ground that it was a breach of condition), his position was rela-
tively simple. He did not have to ask himself how serious the breach was, an inquiry which 
obviously might cause serious difficulty where the future results of the breach remained 
still unknown. But, nevertheless, this whole approach paid a high price for the certainty 
that was thus purchased. For the result undoubtedly was to permit termination of a con-
tract for many breaches of no serious import at all. It began to seem increasingly unjust to 
lawyers that this should be permitted.
Innominate terms
Since the early 1960s, something of a legal revolution has been under way on this ques-
tion. The first case in the story was Hong Kong Fir Shipping Co Ltd v Kawasaki Kisen 
Kaisha,22 which was not a contract of sale of goods at all. The contract here involved a 
charterparty under which a ship was hired, or chartered, by the plaintiffs to the defend-
ants. Now it has long been the law that a charterparty imposes obligations on the own-
ers to take due diligence to provide a seaworthy ship. And it is clear enough that such 
a term may be broken in such serious respects that the charterer must be entitled to 
22	 [1962] 2 QB 26.

	
	 	
The types of obligation created	 67
repudiate the contract altogether. If a ship is supplied which is manifestly in no fit state 
to go to sea at all, and if it is clear that no prospect exists of repairing the ship suffi-
ciently to make her fit to sail, then it can hardly be doubted that the charterer must be 
entitled to repudiate the charterparty altogether. But seaworthiness is, on the authori-
ties, a comprehensive standard, and a ship may be unseaworthy in the legal sense as a 
result of some very trifling defect which can be easily remedied. In these circumstances, 
it was held by the Court of Appeal that the owners’ duties as to seaworthiness could not 
be classified at the outset as a condition or a warranty. The truth was that this was an 
‘innominate term’ whose consequences depended on the actual outcome of breach. The 
law has to have regard to the nature and gravity of the breach before it becomes possible 
to say whether the innocent party is entitled to repudiate a contract for breach of a term 
of this character.
Passing over The Mihalis Angelos,23 another important decision of the Court of 
Appeal, which has, however, now been superseded by House of Lords authority to be 
discussed below, the next case in this story is Cehave NV v Bremerhandelsgesellschaft,24 
which was a case of sale of goods. This contract was for the sale of citrus pulp pellets 
for use in animal foods, and it was a term of the contract that the goods should be 
shipped ‘in good condition’. It was also an implied condition under the Sale of Goods 
Act that the goods should be of merchantable quality. The goods were somewhat dam-
aged, though to a relatively minor degree, and in fact they were ultimately used for their 
intended purpose by the buyers. But the market had fallen at the time of delivery and the 
buyers contended that they were entitled to reject them for breach of the implied condi-
tion of merchantability25 and also for breach of the express condition that they should 
be in ‘good condition’. It was held that the Sale of Goods Act did not exhaustively divide 
all terms into conditions and warranties. Although s. 11 only talks of these two possibil-
ities, s. 62(2) preserves the effect of common law rules save insofar as they are inconsist-
ent with the Act. The court took the Hong Kong Fir case as correctly laying down the 
common law rules and as demonstrating the existence of the ‘innominate term’, breach 
of which may discharge the other party, but only if the nature and consequences are 
sufficiently serious to justify this result. The court went on to hold that such innominate 
terms can exist in contracts of sale of goods and that the express term that the goods had 
to be in good condition was a term of that character. However, the court also assumed 
that the terms under the Act, including the implied condition of merchantability, were 
(as they have always been thought to be) conditions in the strict sense, but in the result 
they held that this term was not broken. Although the actual decision in this case was 
undoubtedly fair, the reasoning leads to the very odd conclusion that an implied term of 
merchantability is an entirely different thing from an express term. If it is express, it may 
or may not be a condition in the strict sense, but if it is implied under the Act, then it 
must be (because the Act says it is) a condition – and it was assumed that this means 
a condition in the strict sense. In order to arrive at a reasonable result, the court had 
to conclude that the goods in this case were merchantable, but not ‘in good condition’,

	 68	 Nature and formation of the contract of sale
a somewhat contradictory holding.26 Of course, because of the modifications made to 
the right to reject by the 1994 Sale and Supply of Goods Act, which inserted a new s. 15A 
into the 1979 Act modifying the non-consumer buyer’s right to reject, if similar facts 
were to recur in the present day, a more satisfying outcome could be reached.27
The next stage in the history of this legal revolution is the decision of the House 
of Lords in Reardon Smith Lines Ltd v Hansen Tangen,28 though this again was not a 
contract of sale of goods. In this case, a ship which was to be constructed by the plain-
tiffs was chartered by them to the defendants for delivery when completed. As the ship 
did not exist at the time when the contract was made, it was described by reference to 
a specification which declared that it was to be built at Yard No. 354 at Osaka Zosen. 
In fact, it was built at another yard, owned by another shipbuilding company to whom 
the plaintiffs had subcontracted the work. Now (as will be seen later) in the law of sale 
of goods, there is an implied condition that the goods to be delivered must correspond 
with their description. This has always been treated as a strict condition, so that any 
deviation from the contractual description has been treated as a breach of condition 
justifying the buyer in rejecting the goods. These cases will be examined later.29 Here it is 
enough to say that the analogy of these cases was naturally much pressed on the House 
of Lords in the Reardon Smith Lines case. If the plaintiffs in this case had contracted to 
sell (rather than charter) the vessel in question, then there is no doubt that on the law 
as it then stood, the sellers would have been held guilty of a breach of the condition 
that the goods must comply with their description. But the argument was rejected by 
the House, and it is clear that some of the sale of goods cases did not find favour with 
their Lordships. Lord Wilberforce, who delivered the principal speech in this case, indi-
cated that some of the leading cases on the law of sale might need reconsideration in 
the future.30 In the meantime, he insisted that the general law of contract had developed 
along more rational lines than the strict law of sale of goods on the point. It is clear that 
he preferred to treat the results of a breach of contract as something to be settled after 
the breach occurred. Moreover, he approved of the decision in the Cehave case to treat 
express contractual conditions in a contract of sale of goods as subject to the general 
law of contract and not to the peculiar rules laid down by the Sale of Goods Act.
The developments described above have certainly not eliminated the legal type of term 
known as condition. Indeed, the terms as to quality and fitness implied under the Sale 
of Goods Act are all conditions, and many non-statutory terms are also conditions – 
for instance, stipulations as to time. However, as we will see, in the case of commercial 
contracts the consequences of a term being characterised as a ‘condition’ in the Sale of 
Goods Act etc. have been significantly modified.31
26	 But the case has been followed several times, most notably in The Aktion [1987] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 283 (express 
terms on sale of ship held innominate because too severe to hold that minor mechanical or body problems 
which could easily be rectified were conditions). See also The Puerto Buitrago [1976] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 250 and

Stipulations as to time
There is a strong tendency to treat stipulations as to the time when some part of a 
contract is to be performed as conditions, breach of which is thus a repudiation which 
can be instantly accepted, thereby terminating the contract while leaving open a claim 
for damages. This tendency is noticeable especially in commercial contracts where a 
contractual breach may create a situation in which the innocent party needs to know 
at once what his rights are; he may need to know immediately whether he is entitled 
to make alternative arrangements, rather than wait and see what are the consequences 
of the breach. In Bunge Corpn v Tradax,32 sellers sold goods for shipment from an 
American port in the Gulf of Mexico, and the buyers were required to name a vessel to 
carry the goods. Notice of the vessel’s name was to be given at latest by 13 June, but in 
fact the buyers failed to give the notice until 17 June by which time the sellers claimed 
that it was too late, and that the contract was terminated by the buyers’ breach. The sale 
in this case was one of a ‘string’, that is, one of a whole series of sales of the same goods; 
it is commonplace in certain areas of business, particularly the commodity trades, for 
this to happen, and strings may involve as many as 50 or more sales. In this event, the 
last buyer who actually intends to have the goods shipped (rather than reselling before 
shipment) must give the requisite notice, and each other person in the chain or string 
must pass the notice upwards, or ensure that it is sent direct to the first seller who is 
actually going to deliver the goods for shipment. It was held by the House of Lords 
that in cases of this nature, terms as to the time of performance of various contractual 
duties must be treated as conditions. It is essential that such notices be given on time, 
in order that they can be passed on, and so that the ultimate seller can himself comply 
with his own contractual duties as regards delivering the goods to the necessary port for 
shipment and so on.
In deciding that the term in question was a condition in this case the House of Lords 
stressed a number of points of relevance when it is unclear whether a contractual term 
is or is not a condition. First, it was said that a term as to time can only be broken 
in one way (namely by delayed performance) and that such terms differ therefore from 
other terms which can be broken in a variety of ways, some more and some less ­serious. 
­However, this is not entirely convincing because delays in performance can vary from 
the trivial and technical to the inordinate and substantial and, indeed, it is already 
established by other House of Lords decisions that a failure to perform a contractual 
duty on time does not always amount to a breach of condition. For example, in Bremer 
­Handelsgesellschaft v Vanden Avenne-Izegem33 sellers were freed from liability for 
non-delivery by a contractual clause concerning governmental prohibitions of export, 
but they were required to notify the buyers of any such prohibition ‘without delay’.  
It was held by the House of Lords that a failure to give the notice within such a time did 
not prevent the sellers relying on the clause in question.
Other points stressed by the House of Lords in Bunge Corpn v Tradax may be more 
critical. These include such questions as: does the performance by the innocent party of

33	 [1978] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 109. See also United Scientific Holdings v Burnley BC [1978] AC 904 as to the effect of

	 70	 Nature and formation of the contract of sale
his duties under the contract depend on receipt of notices in the required time? Is the contract 
likely to be one of a string so that many other commercial parties will be affected by delays? 
Would it be difficult to assess damages for breach if the term is not construed as a condition? 
Taking the decision as a whole, it seems reasonably clear that in ordinary commercial con-
tracts for the sale of goods, terms as to the time of shipment, delivery, payment and the like, 
as well as terms as to documents to be presented and other incidental matters to be performed 
by either party, will still usually fall to be treated as conditions, any breach of which will jus-
tify the other party in repudiating the whole contract. These duties have always been strictly 
treated as conditions in the past and it seems clear from Bunge Corpn v Tradax that more 
recent case law cannot be taken to throw any doubt on the continuation of this traditional 
position.34 However, ‘It remains true’, Lord Wilberforce insisted, ‘that the courts should not be 
too ready to interpret contractual clauses as conditions’.35
But these cautionary words do not appear to be having much effect so far as concern stip-
ulations as to time. In one subsequent case, for instance, it was held that evidence of a ‘more 
relaxed’ attitude to punctuality in the trade was not enough to displace the presumption that a 
clause requiring the buyer to nominate the port of shipment ‘at latest Monday 14 November’ 
was a condition.36 And in another case, it has been held that a long course of dealing between 
the parties in which goods were sold under terms requiring payment by a letter of credit did 
not affect the rule that the time for opening the credit is a condition, even though on many 
previous occasions one or other party had been late in opening the credit.37
There are, indeed, grounds for thinking that it is commercial lawyers, rather than 
commercial men themselves, who believe that certainty is so important in commercial 
transactions that these time stipulations should nearly always be treated as conditions. The 
truth is that reasonable commercial people rarely respond to a breach of a time stipula-
tion by immediately throwing up the whole contract and claiming damages. Usually some 
attempt is made at an accommodation; some inquiry is made to find out if the other party 
can still perform within a reasonable period. Moreover, the law itself recognises that this is 
reasonable behaviour, and indeed occasionally insists upon it, even where the term broken 
was a condition, by penalising a party who has failed to mitigate the damage.
Although prima facie the innocent party is entitled to treat a contract as terminated 
instantly on a breach of condition, the rules as to mitigation will in some, perhaps many, 
cases undercut the treatment of stipulations as to time as conditions. The mitigation 
rules require the innocent party to take reasonable steps to mitigate or minimise the 
damage or loss likely to flow from the other party’s breach. A contracting party who 
fails to perform in due time but tenders, or offers to perform, very shortly after will 
often be able to argue that this offer ought to be accepted as it is likely that the damage 
done by the delay will thereby be minimised.38 Of course, there may be answers to this: 
the innocent party may say that it is already too late; that, having cancelled the con-
tract as a result of the delay, steps have been taken to obtain (or dispose of) the goods

elsewhere, which are by this stage irrevocable; or he may say – with more or less plausi-
bility depending on the facts – that he was not confident enough that the guilty party, 
who had already breached once, would perform as he now promised to do.
But if the mitigation rules do not help the guilty party the present law is undoubtedly 
very severe in its consequences. Not only is the innocent party entitled to treat a breach 
of condition as the equivalent of a repudiation justifying him in instant termination of 
the contract, it is also immaterial why the innocent party wants to behave in this way. He 
is not required to act reasonably, or in good faith, in exercising his rights. Indeed, usually 
it seems that technical breaches of condition (such as very short delays) are only treated 
as grounds for termination where the innocent party is seeking a way out of the contract 
because market conditions have changed, or for some equally irrelevant reason. In practice, 
it is probably quite rare that technical breaches of condition are themselves the motive  
(as well as the legal justification) for a claim that the contract must be treated as terminated.
Sale and Supply of Goods Act 1994
As indicated earlier, the modern developments discussed above do not fit easily into 
the framework of the Sale of Goods Act itself. In particular, all the implied terms as to 
quality and fitness of the goods under the Act are conditions, and there is no room for 
treating any of these terms as innominate terms.39 It seems clear that, as the Law Com-
missions suggested if the Sale of Goods Act had not been drafted in this form, modern 
courts would not have arrived at this result.40
After a lengthy inquiry the Law Commissions published proposals for change in the 
law relating to conditions,41 and the government accepted these in principle. They are 
given effect to by the Sale and Supply of Goods Act 1994. This is dealt with in detail 
later.42 For present purposes it is sufficient to note that it does not affect the law appli-
cable where the buyer deals as consumer because the Law Commissions eventually con-
cluded (after much consultation and discussion) that consumers should continue to be 
allowed to reject goods for breach of any condition.43 In non-consumer sales, the law 
was amended for contracts entered into after 3 January 1995 so that the buyer no longer 
has the right to reject for any breach of the implied terms if the consequences and nature 
of the breach are so slight that rejection would be unreasonable.
Some regret may be expressed here that none of the changes so far effected will mean an 
end to the process of classifying terms. The 1994 Act does not reclassify the implied terms in 
the Act as innominate terms. The terms remain conditions, but in non-consumer sales the 
remedy for breach of condition is limited. Moreover, the changes do not affect any conditions 
39	 The new Act in its body uses the word ‘term’ instead of ‘condition’ but provides in Sch. 2 that in England 
and Wales and Northern Ireland the implied terms are conditions (save in the case of subss. (2), (4) and (5) 
of s. 12). In other words, no change of substance is made to the former provisions in this regard.
40	 Law Com. Working Paper No. 85, Sale and Supply of  Goods, para 2.30. The subsequent Final Report, 
Sale and Supply of Goods (Law Com. No. 160, Cm. 137, 1987), as to which see below, was markedly more 
conservative in tone than the Working Paper, and appeared to accept unreservedly the current structure of 
the law and the classification of contractual terms.

except those implied under ss. 13, 14 and 15 of the Act, and s. 30, as to delivery of the correct 
quantity, so that (for instance) breach of a condition as to time is not affected. This is a regret-
table result of the fact that the terms of reference of the Law Commissions’ inquiry were lim-
ited. A more rational change would surely have extended to all breaches of condition.
Warranties
The term warranty is defined by s. 61 as an:
. . . agreement with reference to goods which are the subject of a contract of sale, but collateral 
to the main purpose of such contract, the breach of which gives rise to a claim for damages but 
not to a right to reject the goods and treat the contract as repudiated.
This definition thus explains both the meaning and the legal effect of a warranty. The 
term ‘collateral’, though hallowed by usage, is not very happily chosen, for it may give 
the impression that a warranty is a term which is somehow outside the contract, whereas 
it is in fact a term of the contract.44 In practice, very few terms are ever classified as war-
ranties in this narrow technical sense. It is clearly rare that one can say, at the outset, that 
no breach of a term can ever have such serious consequences as would justify treating the 
whole contract as at an end; this is (as seen above) why the courts generally classify terms 
as conditions. It is even doubtful whether many pure warranties ever exist as a matter of 
strict law, and the Law Commissions at one time appeared inclined to suggest that the 
whole category of warranties should be abolished.45 But their final recommendations con-
tained no proposals to change the situation, and the terms in contracts of sale of goods are 
still divided at common law into conditions, innominate terms and warranties.
Representations
From terms of the contract, it is necessary to distinguish mere statements or representa-
tions, which are not part of the contract but may have serious consequences nonetheless. 
On the details of this topic, reference should be made to the standard works on the law 
of contract.46 It is, however, necessary to say a few words on the distinction between a 
term and a misrepresentation because (it will be suggested later) despite the use some-
times made by the courts of s. 13,47 the Act does in truth leave intact the age-old distinc-
tion between a contract term and a representation.
Whether a statement is or is not a part of the contract depends upon the intention of the 
parties, but this elusive concept is often of little help,48 especially since the courts have been 
44	 See Stoljar (1952) 15 MLR 425, 430–2.
45	 Law Com. Working Paper No. 85, para. 2.32. But there are statutory implied warranties in s. 12(2) of the Act. 
The older use of the word ‘warranty’ and ‘to warrant’ is also still often found, especially where the question 
is whether a statement is a contractual term or a representation. In this context the word simply means 
‘contractual term’. This usage is followed in this book because there is simply no alternative to the verb, ‘to 
warrant’.

prepared to hold that an oral statement may override the written terms of a contract. It is 
probably true to say that the courts are now much readier to interpret a statement as a term of 
the contract than they were in the late nineteenth and early ­twentieth centuries. This tendency 
may be illustrated by contrasting the decisions in Hopkins v Tanqueray49 and Couchman v 
Hill.50 In the former case, the defendant, who was offering his horse for sale by auction, gave 
an assurance to the plaintiff on the day before the sale that the horse was perfectly sound. 
It was held that this statement was a mere representation and not a term of the contract. In 
the second case, the defendant was offering his heifer for sale by auction. In reliance on an 
assurance given by the defendant and also by the auctioneer that the heifer was unserved, the 
plaintiff bid for and bought the animal. This statement was held to be a term of the contract. 
In a strictly technical sense there is no conflict between these cases because questions of inten-
tion must depend upon all the circumstances of the case, and superficial similarities may hide 
underlying differences.51 It would be more realistic, however, to admit to this general change of 
attitude on the part of the courts. It is in fact increasingly uncommon for a court to hold that 
a material statement made by one of the parties to a contract is only a misrepresentation.52 
This is particularly true of statements made by a seller in a contract for the sale of goods.
The tendency today often appears to be to hold a statement to be a term of the contract 
when it seems reasonable to impose liability in damages on the person who made it and vice 
versa. To attempt to decide whether a statement is a term of the contract or a mere rep-
resentation without reference to the result is, in many cases, to put the cart before the horse. 
On the one hand, a statement as to the quality or state of the goods by a seller will almost 
invariably be held to be a term of the contract if the seller is a dealer in the goods. So in Dick 
Bentley (Productions) Ltd v Harold Smith (Motors) Ltd,53 where a dealer, in selling a car, told 
the buyer that it had done only 20,000 miles, this was held by the Court of Appeal to be a 
term of the contract and not a mere representation. On the other hand, in Oscar Chess Ltd v 
Williams,54 where a person selling a second-hand car in part-exchange for another innocently 
misrepresented the age of the car (relying on the log book, which was in fact forged), the 
Court of Appeal held the statement to be a mere representation. It seems from these cases 
that, in the absence of a clear intention one way or the other, a statement is a term of the 
contract where the person making it had, or could reasonably have obtained, the information 
necessary to show whether the statement was true.
It is unnecessary here to make more than a brief reference to the possibility of a claim for neg-
ligent misrepresentation by a buyer, whether or not he is able to establish that the representation

suggested that the decision in the later case might otherwise have been different. But in Harling v Eddy [1951] 
2 KB 739 the CA held the two cases to be distinguishable, though on what grounds it is not wholly clear. 
The correct explanation of Hopkins v Tanqueray may well be that the auction was held at Tattersalls where, 
by custom (as everyone knew – though not the parties it would seem), all sales were without warranty –

in some circumstances even at common law,55 it will not often be possible for a buyer to bring 
such a claim in a case where the representation is not a term of the contract.56 But this is now 
of little importance for, under s. 2(1) of the Misrepresentation Act 1967, a contracting party 
is given a statutory claim for misrepresentation against the other contracting party. Since the 
onus is placed on the party making the representation to show that he had reasonable grounds 
to believe, and did believe up to the time the contract was made, that the facts represented were 
true, this approach, however, creates an incentive for claims based on misrepresentation to be 
joined with claims for damages for breach of condition or warranty.57 However, damages under 
the Misrepresentation Act may not be assessed in the same way as damages for breach of a 
term of the contract, so the distinction may still be important in some cases.58
Scots law
Much of what has been said in this chapter is, at best, interesting background information 
for the Scots lawyer. The distinction of contractual terms into conditions and warranties is 
unknown in Scots law, although its deployment to categorise the terms implied under the Sale 
of Goods Act did lead to some confusion until the passage of the Sale and Supply of Goods 
Act 1994. But as the implied terms are now defined in Scotland without use of the words 
‘condition’ or ‘warranty’,59 this difficulty has ceased to cause trouble. The Scottish approach 
to the customer’s right to terminate a contract for the supply of goods following breach of an 
implied term by the supplier is now the same as it would be for any other contract, namely, 
to ask whether the breach is sufficiently ‘material’ to justify the remedy.60 Scots lawyers do, 
however, refer to contractual terms as warranties, usually when the term is an undertaking as 
to a state of fact, such as the condition of goods; but it does not follow from this that the only 
remedy for breach is damages. Termination will be possible if the breach is material.
The distinction between a contract term and a representation is well established in Scots 
law, and the tests used in this regard in England are also applied in Scotland.61 Negligent and 
fraudulent misrepresentations are delicts, giving rise to claims for damages.62 There may be 
recovery for a pre-contractual negligent misrepresentation under s. 10 of the Law Reform 
(Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1985.63 A misrepresentation may ground an action 
for reduction of a contract on the basis of either fraud or error, as the case may be.64

Part II
The duties of the seller

The existence of the goods and the duty 
to pass a good title
No implied condition that the goods exist
It might have been thought that in a sale of specific goods there would be an implied 
condition on the part of the seller that the goods were in existence at the time when the 
contract was made. Since the seller warrants, as we shall see below, that he has a right to 
sell the goods, and since he is in many cases responsible for defects in the quality of the 
goods, it might seem that a fortiori he should be liable if he has sold non-existent goods. 
Nevertheless, this is not generally so, for s. 6 enacts that:
Where there is a contract for the sale of specific goods, and the goods without the knowledge of 
the seller have perished at the time when the contract is made, the contract is void.
This section has been commonly understood to confirm the decision of the House of 
Lords in Couturier v Hastie.1 The defendant in that case was a del credere agent who 
sold, on behalf of the plaintiffs, a cargo of corn shipped from Salonika. Before the date 
of the sale, the cargo had been lawfully sold by the master of the ship, so that there 
was no corn available for delivery to the buyer; instead, the sellers tendered the usual 
shipping documents. These documents included an insurance policy but since the goods 
had been lost before the buyer had any interest in them he would (presumably) have been 
unable to claim under the policy, even assuming it covered the loss. Possibly the buyer 
could, if he had been compelled to pay the price, have required the seller to claim under 
the policy and hand over the proceeds. But the buyer obviously wanted corn, not the 
proceeds of an insurance policy, and he refused to accept or pay for the documents. The 
sellers thereupon sued the agent, whose liability depended on whether the buyer would 
have been liable. It was held that the agent was not liable.
It was for many years thought that the case was decided in this way on the ground that 
the contract was void for mistake. It is, however, now widely accepted that the decision 
turned simply on the construction of the contract,2 or perhaps (though this is probably 
saying the same thing in a different way) that the decision does no more than illustrate 
the well-known principle that if the seller cannot deliver the goods the buyer is (anyhow 
prima facie) not bound to pay the price, a rule affirmed by s. 28 of the Act.3 If the buyer 
had brought an action for non-delivery, then the court would have had to decide a very

	 78	 The duties of the seller
different question. This might have been whether the contract was void for mistake, but 
a better approach would have been to regard it as a question of construction. In other 
words, the question to be decided would have been, did the defendant contract that the 
goods existed, or was there an implied condition that if there were no goods there would 
be no contract? This apparently was the view of Lord Atkin in Bell v Lever Bros Ltd,4 for 
in the course of his speech in that case he said:
This brings the discussion to the alternative mode of expressing the result of a mutual 
mistake . . . The proposition does not amount to more than this, that if the contract expressly 
or impliedly contains a term that a particular assumption is a condition of the contract, the 
contract is avoided if the assumption is not true.
Looking at the problem as one of interpretation, the facts of Couturier v Hastie were 
open to at least three possible constructions:
1	 there might have been an implied condition precedent (or, in Scotland, a resolutive 
condition) that the goods were in existence, in which case, if they were not, neither 
party would be bound; or,
2	 the seller might have contracted, or warranted, that the goods were in existence, in 
which case he would be liable for non-delivery, and the buyer would not be liable for 
non-acceptance; or,
3	 the buyer might have taken the risk of the goods having perished, in which case he 
would be liable for the price even in the absence of delivery, and the seller would not, 
of course, be liable for non-delivery.
In Couturier v Hastie,5 the House of Lords merely decided that the contract could not 
be construed in the third of the above three ways, but the House did not decide, as it was 
not called upon to decide, whether the proper interpretation was of the first or second 
types above. A decision between these two possibilities would only have been necessary 
if the buyer had sued for damages for non-delivery. Such a decision was necessary in 
McRae v Commonwealth Disposals Commission,6 where the defendants contracted 
to sell to the plaintiffs a shipwrecked tanker on a certain reef. After the plaintiffs had 
incurred considerable expenditure in preparing a salvage expedition, it was discovered 
that not only was there not and had never been any tanker but also that the reef was 
non-existent. The High Court of Australia approached the case on the basis that the 
defendants were liable for breach of contract unless they could establish that there was 
an implied condition precedent that the ship was in existence. Manifestly, on the facts of 
the case, no such condition could be implied. On the contrary, the court concluded that:
The only proper construction of the contract is that it included a promise by the Commission 
that there was a tanker in the position specified. The Commission contracted that there was a 
tanker there.7

they did not claim their loss of profits, but only their reliance expenses.

	
	 	
The existence of the goods and the duty to pass a good title	 79
In this connection, the earlier decision of the same court in Goldsborough, Mort & 
Co Ltd v Carter8 is also of some interest, although this case (like Couturier v Hastie) was 
decided at common law. In this case, the defendant agreed to sell ‘about’ 4,000 sheep pas-
tured on certain lands at a price per head. It was agreed to muster and count the sheep 
on a certain date and the contract also stated that, if it should be found that there were 
less than 4,000 sheep, the buyer would take and pay for the actual number delivered. In 
fact, there had been conditions of severe drought in the area and these were followed by 
cold winter rains, with the result that, on muster, only 890 acceptable sheep were found. 
The buyer claimed damages for the short delivery, but his claim was rejected. Griffith CJ 
treated the contract as one for the sale of specific goods, and said:
It is an implied condition of such a contract that at the time of making the contract or before the 
time of performance the chattels are or will be in existence (Couturier v Hastie), and, further, 
that they shall still be existing when the time comes for performance (Howell v Coupland).
But the majority of the court held that this principle was displaced in the particular 
circumstances of the case on the true construction of the contract. Since the seller did 
not know how many sheep there were and since the buyer was aware of the possibility 
of shortage and had agreed to take what number were delivered, it was held that the 
contract was only for the sale of such sheep as existed and could be delivered on muster.
A case resembling the McRae case in some respects is Associated Japanese Bank v 
Crédit du Nord SA9. Here, one JB entered into a sale and leaseback transaction with the 
plaintiffs, under which he sold four large machines to them for over one million pounds, 
and they leased the machines back to him. Such a sale and leaseback transaction is sim-
ply a way of raising money on the security of goods, and is not unusual in practice; but 
what was unusual about this case was that the machines did not exist at all, and the whole 
scheme was a fraud by JB. The validity of the contract between JB and the plaintiffs did not 
directly arise in the action because JB was of course not worth suing, and the action was 
actually brought to enforce a guarantee of the transaction given by the defendants. The 
action failed because Steyn J held that the guarantee contract was void either for mistake 
or for failure of an implied condition that the goods existed. But if the plaintiffs had sued 
JB on the contract itself it seems hardly credible that he could have defended the action 
by claiming that the contract was void because the goods did not exist – a conclusion not 
rendered more plausible merely because in any event JB could plainly have been sued for 
fraud. Obviously, the only possible construction of the sale and leaseback contract, like 
that in the McRae case, was that the seller was guaranteeing the existence of the goods.
So it seems clear that in appropriate circumstances a seller of non-existent goods may 
be held liable on the basis that he has impliedly or even expressly warranted that the 
goods do exist. The impact of s. 6 of the Act on the problem must next be considered. In 
terms, the section clearly contemplates a case where the goods have existed at one time, 
but have perished before the contract was made, so that the sales in the McRae case and 
the Associated Japanese Bank case would not come within it at all (in the latter case a 
fortiori because the seller knew the goods did not exist). Consequently, the common law

	 80	 The duties of the seller
position would remain and the result should be that already suggested – the seller should 
be liable for breach of contract, as indeed was held in the former case by the High Court 
of Australia. But this does not answer the question where the goods have in fact existed 
but have perished before the contract was made. In such a case, it appears at first sight 
that the contract must be held void under s. 6, but it is difficult to believe that this can be 
right. If a seller, in effect, contracts that the goods are in existence, is he entitled to avoid 
all liability on the ground that s. 6 applies and the contract is void? This extraordinary 
result can, it is submitted, best be avoided by giving a liberal interpretation to s. 55(1) of 
the Act which now runs:
Where any right, duty, or liability would arise under a contract of sale of goods by implication 
of law, it may (subject to the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977) be negatived or varied by express 
agreement or by the course of dealing between the parties, or by such usage as binds both 
parties to the contract.
Read literally, it might appear that this section would not prevent the operation 
of s. 6 in a case such as that being considered, for the whole effect of the section is to 
prevent any right, duty or liability arising; moreover, literally construed, s. 6 prevents 
any contract of sale of goods coming into existence to which s. 55(1) can apply at all. 
But in preventing the principal obligations from arising, s. 6 may give rise to other rights 
and duties; for example, as to the return of the price,10 and perhaps the reference to ‘a 
contract of sale of goods’ could generously be read as including a reference to a contract 
which is void under s. 6 (which does, after all, itself refer to ‘a contract for the sale of 
goods’). In any case, the clear object of the section does seem to be to enable the parties 
to vary, by agreement, all those provisions of the Act which do not affect third parties.
Of course, it is clear that anomalous results would follow if s. 6 were held to be a rule 
of law to be applied irrespective of the intention of the parties. Since the section is limited 
in various ways (e.g. in that it only applies to a sale of specific goods, and only applies 
also where the goods perish) closely parallel cases may fall just within or just outside the 
section. Those outside will be settled at common law according to the true construction 
of the contract. It would be unfortunate if those just on the other side of the line had to 
be determined by a rigid application of s. 6. It is submitted, therefore, that if, on the true 
construction of the contract, it appears that the seller is contracting that the goods do 
exist, s. 6 will not apply and the seller will be liable for non-delivery.11 If the seller has been 
negligent in not discovering that the goods have perished, it may be that the better solution 
would often be to hold that there is no such implied exclusion of s. 6, but that the seller 
should be held liable for misrepresentation. In that event the buyer could obtain damages 
for some of his actual (‘reliance’) losses, but not for his expectation losses.12
10	 Professor Atiyah noted in earlier editions that a learned reviewer first drew his attention to this argument 
(see (1959) 75 LQR 417), but he had come to feel that there were difficulties with it. Cf. Treitel, Law of 
Contract (12th edn, 2007, Sweet & Maxwell), §8-010.
11	 In Joseph Constantine SS Ltd v Imperial Smelting Corpn [1942] AC 154, 184–6, there are dicta by Lord 
Wright clearly showing that he at least thought that ss. 6 and 7 of the Act merely embody common law 
rules of construction. See also Christopher Hill Ltd v Ashington Piggeries [1972] AC 441, 501, where Lord 
Diplock says that the Act should not ‘be construed so narrowly as to force on parties to contracts for the sale 
of goods promises and consequences different from what they must reasonably have intended’.

Contract (6th edn, 2005, Clarendon), pp. 399–401.

	
	 	
The existence of the goods and the duty to pass a good title	 81
The only effect of s. 6 is thus to give rise to a presumption, in the cases to which it 
applies, that the seller is not contracting that the goods exist. In effect, the section gives 
rise to a rule of construction rather than a rigid rule of law. Where, on the other hand, 
as in McRae, the goods have never existed at all, s. 6 cannot apply, and the presumption 
may be that the seller is contracting that the goods exist.
Although this problem may appear to be of greater academic than practical impor-
tance, it is perhaps unfortunate that s. 6 was written into the Act at all in its present 
form. It should, of course, be remembered that Couturier v Hastie was decided before 
the invention of modern methods of communication and on the facts of that case, in the 
year 1856, it might well have been reasonable to hold that the seller was not contracting 
that the goods were in existence. If the identical facts were to recur today, however, it is 
in the highest degree improbable that the seller would not be aware of the sale of the 
cargo even before it occurred, and if he were not it would most probably be due to his 
own negligence. Such a possibility could today give rise to a claim for negligent misrep-
resentation at common law or under s. 2(1) of the Misrepresentation Act 1967 or under 
s. 10 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1985. No doubt in 
some circumstances this may seem a better solution than an action for breach of con-
tract, for example, if it seems unreasonable to award damages for loss of bargain against 
the seller.
The sort of facts to which s. 6 may be applied today may well differ considerably from 
the Couturier v Hastie situation. For example, in Barrow, Lane & Ballard Ltd v Phillip 
Phillips & Co Ltd13 the plaintiffs contracted to sell to the defendants 700 bags of nuts, 
which were believed to be lying in certain warehouses. In fact, 109 of the bags had disap-
peared, presumably by theft, at the time when the contract was made, and after 150 bags 
had been delivered about two months later, it was eventually discovered that no further 
bags remained. On the face of it, one would have thought this was a plain case. The 
sellers had sold a specific parcel of 700 bags of nuts when in fact there were only 591 to 
deliver. This would seem, therefore, to have been a simple case of breach of contract by 
the sellers. But that was not the result.
The actual claim in this case was on two bills of exchange which had been given in 
payment of the price of the whole of the 700 bags. In fact, the buyers obtained delivery 
of the 150 bags which were available when delivery was required, and they admitted their 
liability to pay for these bags, though, it seems, not under the contract itself. The buyers, 
however, refused to honour the bills of exchange, on the ground that the sellers were in 
breach of an implied term that the goods were in existence. This is hardly surprising 
because the buyers’ loss was probably not covered by their insurance, while it may well 
have been covered by the sellers’ insurance. Wright J appears to have preferred the view 
that the contract was void under s. 6, rather than that the sellers were in breach.14 But 
it is unsatisfactory to say that the whole contract here was void when the buyers in fact 
obtained delivery of 150 of the bags, and admitted their liability to pay for them. If the 
contract was indeed void, then some strange results would have ensued. First, the terms 
governing the delivery of the 150 bags would not have been the terms agreed upon by 
13	 [1929] 1 KB 574.

	 82	 The duties of the seller
the parties, and the buyers would only have been liable for a reasonable price in a res-
titutionary claim. This would also have ruled out any claim for breach of the statutory 
implied terms as to quality and fitness, which seems an extraordinary result. And thirdly, 
it would also have meant, presumably, that the sellers could have refused to deliver the 
150 bags if the facts had been discovered before delivery had been required. For reasons 
given below this also seems wrong.
Section 6 gives rise to three other difficulties which are considered in the next three 
sections.
Meaning of ‘specific goods’
‘Specific goods’ are defined by s. 62 as ‘goods identified and agreed upon at the time a 
contract of sale is made’. In most cases this is clear enough, and serves to distinguish 
such cases from contracts of sale of future or generic goods. Thus, if A contracts to 
deliver 1,000 tonnes of wheat to B, this is not a sale of specific goods and A’s obligations 
are unaffected by the fact that he had a particular 1,000 tonnes in mind which have, 
unknown to him, perished before the date of the contract. Some cases, however, are not 
so clear. What of a contract to sell 200 tonnes of potatoes to be grown on a particular 
piece of land? In Howell v Coupland15 (a case dealing with subsequent destruction, now 
covered by s. 7 of the Act)16 it was held that this was a sale of specific goods for the pur-
pose of the common law rules of frustration. However, the modern tendency appears to 
be to confine the meaning of ‘specific goods’ under the Act to cases of existing goods 
which have actually been identified or agreed upon. Thus in Re Wait,17 a case to be con-
sidered at length later,18 it was held that a sale of 5,000 tons out of a cargo of 10,000 
tons of wheat on a particular ship was not a sale of specific or ascertained goods within 
the meaning of s. 52 of which specific performance could be ordered. Similarly, in H R 
& S Sainsbury v Street,19 it was held that a sale of 275 tons of barley to be grown on a 
particular farm was not a sale of specific goods. The effect of the perishing of the goods 
in such circumstances must, therefore, be a matter for the common law rather than s. 6 
of the Act.
Effect of part of goods perishing
Where there is a sale of specific goods, part of which have perished before the date of the 
sale, the effect of s. 6 is now somewhat obscure. In Barrow, Lane & Ballard Ltd v Phillip 
Phillips & Co Ltd, the facts of which have been given above, Wright J, emphasising that 
he regarded the 700 bags of nuts as an indivisible parcel of goods, held that the contract 
was avoided by s. 6, even though only 109 bags had apparently disappeared by the time 
the contract was made. It has been pointed out above that this decision entails some 
strange results. Amongst others, it would mean that if the sellers had refused to deliver

The existence of the goods and the duty to pass a good title	 83
the 150 bags which were actually available when delivery was demanded, they would not 
have been liable to the buyers. That conclusion would seem particularly suspect in the 
light of H R & S Sainsbury v Street.20 In this case the defendant agreed to sell a crop of 
about 275 tons of barley to be grown by him on his farm. In fact, owing to general crop 
failure, only some 140 tons were produced, which the defendant sold and delivered to a 
third party at a substantially higher price. McKenna J held that, although the contract 
was frustrated as to that part of the crop which failed, this did not exonerate the defend-
ant from offering the crop actually produced to the plaintiffs. Somewhat puzzlingly, he 
did not seem to regard the plaintiffs as being obliged to take the 140 tons,21 which sug-
gests that the seller but not the buyer was bound by the contract in the events which 
actually occurred. What is at any rate clear is that, treating the problem purely as a com-
mon law question of construction, there are three additional possible constructions of 
the contract to be added to those dealing with total perishing of the goods.22 These are 
that if part of the goods perish:
4	 the seller may be obliged to deliver the balance and the buyer may be bound to take it; 
or
5	 the seller may be obliged to tender delivery of the balance to the buyer who is not 
bound to take it; or
6	 the seller is not bound to tender delivery to the buyer, but if he does so, the buyer is 
bound to take it.
Which of these is the correct construction of any particular contract must depend, as 
usual, on the terms of the contract and all the circumstances of the case.
Although H R & S Sainsbury v Street was decided at common law, it would seem very 
odd if, on parallel facts falling within s. 6, a different result had to be arrived at. It would 
seem, therefore, that the buyers in the Barrow Lane & Ballard case may have been enti-
tled to insist on delivery of the 150 bags of nuts remaining, notwithstanding s. 6, which 
is not easy to reconcile with the idea that the contract there was actually void. Whilst 
the approach in H R & S Sainsbury v Street would seem to be more in line with modern 
commercial expectations, it does run into difficulties because of the approach taken to 
s. 6 and its consequence that the entire contract is void. Perhaps the time has come to 
consider amending this section to ensure its application produces a result which is more 
acceptable from a commercial point of view.
Meaning of ‘perish’
Barrow, Lane & Ballard Ltd v Phillip Phillips & Co Ltd23 is also material on the next 
point, namely the meaning of the word ‘perished’. Read literally, this might be thought 
to cover only physical destruction, but in fact it is submitted that it should be construed 
20	 Ibid.
21	 Perhaps because of s. 30(1) – see below, p. 113 (which says that if the seller delivers less than he contracted to 
sell the buyer may reject the goods). This provision is now modified in the case of commercial buyers – see 
below p. 116 et seq.

	 84	 The duties of the seller
to cover also perishing in a commercial sense. Although this point was not argued in 
this case, the actual result supports this contention. There are no other English cases 
precisely in point under s. 6,24 but several cases on freight and insurance law deal with a 
very similar question; that is, whether there has been a total loss of goods. On this topic, 
one cannot do better than quote the pungent observations of Lord Esher MR in Asfar & 
Co Ltd v Blundell:25
The first point taken on behalf of the defendants, the under-writers, is that there has been no 
total loss of the dates . . . The ingenuity of the argument might commend itself to a body of 
chemists, but not to business men. We are dealing with dates as a subject matter of commerce; 
and it is contended that, although these dates were under water for two days, and when 
brought up were simply a mass of pulpy matter impregnated with sewage and in a state of 
fermentation, there had been no change in their nature, and they still were dates. There is a 
perfectly well known test which has for many years been applied to such cases as the present – 
that test is whether, as a matter of business, the nature of the thing has been altered.
Mutatis mutandis these remarks could apply equally to the meaning of the word 
‘perish’ in s. 6. The only case which is inconsistent with this view is Horn v Minister of 
Food,26 which was a case under s. 7 of the Act. Morris J here held that potatoes, which 
had so rotted as to be worthless, had not perished within the meaning of s. 7 because 
they were still potatoes, but in any event he held that the section did not apply because 
the risk in the goods had already passed to the buyer, and the section is excluded in such 
a case. His remarks on this point are therefore obiter and it is submitted that they cannot 
be supported.
If a wide meaning is given to the word ‘perish’ it becomes all the more important that 
s. 6 of the Act be treated only as a rule of construction. For (as will be seen later) a seller 
is usually under stringent obligations as to the quality and fitness of the goods to be 
supplied under the contract. So, for example, a seller who contracts to sell a specific load 
of potatoes will be liable for breach of his implied obligations if he delivers potatoes 
which are not of satisfactory quality, and it will be immaterial whether they were not of 
satisfactory quality before the contract was made. But if he can plead s. 6 of the Act he 
will escape all liability. Such a result was arrived at in the New Zealand case of Turnbull 
v Rendell27 where the seller agreed to sell 75 tons of ‘table potatoes’ from a specific crop, 
some of which were still undug. At the time of the contract, the potatoes were so badly 
affected with secondary growth that they no longer answered the description ‘table 
potatoes’. Prima facie one would have thought, therefore, that there was a breach of 
s. 13 of the Act (that the goods must answer their description)28 but, in fact, the buyer’s 
claim for damages was rejected. The court held that the potatoes had ‘perished’ within 
the meaning of s. 6 of the Act and the contract was therefore void. It may seem strange 
that the seller’s position is improved in such a case where the potatoes are so rotten as

to be no longer describable as ‘potatoes’ so that he can rely on s. 6 of the Act. But the 
result can be justified on the ground that in such a case the event which has occurred is 
so far outside the contemplation of the parties that it would be unfair to place the risk 
of its occurrence on either party alone. In effect, this is the justification for the doctrines 
of mistake and frustration, and of course s. 6 is a part of the former doctrine. Still, it 
is important that sufficient flexibility is retained in the operation of s. 6 so that it is not 
available as an excuse to a seller who ought plainly to be treated as warranting the qual-
ity of the goods.
At all events there seems no inclination to extend the meaning of ‘perish’ by analogy 
to cases where the seller is clearly responsible for the unavailability of the goods. Thus 
it has been held no defence for a seller who is sued for non-delivery to prove that, after 
agreeing to sell the goods to the plaintiff, he sold and delivered the goods to another 
buyer.29
Even granting that s. 6 covers perishing in a commercial sense, a difficulty still exists 
in the case of goods lost by theft. Suppose, for example, that A sells his car to B, which 
unknown to them both has just been stolen. It may be a long time before the police give 
up all hope of tracing the car, and until this happens the vehicle can hardly be said to 
have perished even in a commercial sense, but what is to happen in the meantime? The 
validity of the contract can hardly depend upon the activities of the police. The insur-
ance cases are not of much assistance here because a theft can clearly be a commercial 
loss and, of course, this is often the whole object of the insurance, while it is not so clear 
that a stolen car can be said to have perished even commercially. Barrow, Lane & Ballard 
Ltd v Phillip Phillips & Co Ltd30 is distinguishable from such a case because there the 
nuts had in all probability been dispersed by sale after the theft and, indeed, some or all 
of them might well have been consumed by the ultimate purchasers. Whether, and if so 
at what stage, a stolen article can be said to have perished, therefore, is a question which 
is still open and awaits solution by the courts. Perhaps the answer is to treat the question 
as one of fact and degree. If, as a practical matter, there is no realistic prospect of recov-
ering the goods, they should be treated as having perished within the meaning of s. 6.
The seller’s right to sell the goods
Among the most important terms implied by the Act in a contract of sale of goods are 
those relating to the seller’s duty to pass a good title to the goods. Section 12(1) of the 
1979 Act, incorporating amendments made by the Supply of Goods (Implied Terms) Act 
1973, is as follows:
In a contract of sale, other than one to which subsection (3) below applies, there is an implied 
condition on the part of the seller that in the case of a sale, he has a right to sell the goods, and 
in the case of an agreement to sell, he will have such a right at the time when the property is to 
pass.
It is clear that the main purpose and effect of the section is to require the seller to transfer 
the property or title to the goods to the buyer. Plainly, if the seller is himself the owner,

	 86	 The duties of the seller
and nobody else has any claims to the goods, the seller’s property in the goods will pass 
to the buyer under the contract and s. 12(1) will be satisfied. But the section does not 
require that the seller should himself be owner, or even that he should acquire a title to 
the goods before transferring them. ‘A contract of sale can perfectly well be performed 
by a seller who never has title at any time, by causing a third party to transfer it directly 
to the buyer.’31
Section 12(1) is not, however, drafted in terms of ‘property’ nor of ‘title’;32 what it 
requires is that the seller has, or should have, a ‘right to sell’, and this causes prob-
lems because of the inevitable ambiguity of the word ‘right’. The question whether 
the seller has a right to sell the goods cannot be answered until it is known precisely 
what it is which the seller must transfer to the buyer. The Act itself does not provide 
a very clear answer to this problem. All we have is the statement in s. 2(1) that ‘a 
contract for the sale of goods is a contract by which the seller transfers or agrees to 
transfer the property in goods to the buyer’, and the definition of the term ‘prop-
erty’ in s. 61 as ‘the general property in goods and not merely a special property’. In 
other words, unless the seller has a right to pass the general property to the buyer, 
he will be in breach of s. 12(1). But what is meant by a ‘right’ to sell the goods? The 
natural and primary meaning of the word ‘right’ in s. 12(1) seems to be ‘power’; in 
other words, the seller must have the power to vest the general property in the goods 
in the buyer.
In most cases, of course, the ‘power’ to confer a title and the ‘right’ to sell the 
goods will go together. But there are some exceptional cases in which they may be 
separated, and it may then be significant that the section is not drafted in terms of a 
‘power’. First, there are some rare cases in which a seller may have a ‘right’ to sell the 
goods, and yet may have no power to confer a good title on the buyer. For example, a 
debtor who sells goods which have already been seized (but not physically removed) 
by the sheriff under a writ of execution has a right to sell them (at least until they 
are sold by the sheriff) but he sells them subject to the sheriff’s rights.33 He is thus 
unable to confer a good title on the buyer free from the sheriff’s claims. No action 
lies under s. 12(1) in such a case, though (as noted later) there is a remedy under  
s. 12(2).
The second type of exceptional case concerns the reverse situation – that is, where the 
seller has the power to confer a good title on the buyer, but yet no ‘right to sell the goods’. 
It appears, for instance, from the decision in Niblett v Confectioners’ Materials Co34 
that the seller may in some circumstances be guilty of a breach of s. 12(1) although he 
had the power to transfer the property in the goods. The facts of this case were as fol-
lows: the defendants, an American company, sold 3,000 tins of preserved milk to the 
plaintiffs, but when the goods arrived in England they were detained by the customs 
authorities on the ground that their labels infringed the trademark of a well-known

English company. It was held that as this company could have obtained an injunction to 
restrain the sale of the goods, the sellers had no right to sell them.35
Although this was an unusual case, the recent decision in Azzurri Communications 
Limited v International Telecommunications Equipment Limited t/a SOS Communica-
tions36 is similar. Here, Azzuri had supplied a large number of telephone sets for use in 
call centres operated by the Automobile Association Ltd. These had been obtained from 
two separate suppliers, one of whom being SOS Communications. Numerous handsets 
developed faults, and it transpired that these were all from the batch supplied by SOS. 
The manufacturer of the handsets then discovered that the those supplied by SOS were 
‘grey market’ imports into the European Economic Area, that SOS was not an author-
ised wholesaler, and that there had been a trademark infringement, which amounted to a 
breach of both s.12(1) and 12(2).
These cases are on quite a specific issue, but there are many other cases, which will 
be fully examined later,37 in which a person who is not the owner of goods and who sells 
them without the owner’s authority is enabled by the Act (or by other statutes) to pass 
a good title to the buyer. In such cases, it seems that there is a breach of the condition 
implied by s. 12(1), but the buyer has in fact suffered no damage from the breach and 
cannot therefore maintain an action against the seller.38 It is true that in Niblett v Con-
fectioners’ Materials Co Ltd39 Atkin LJ thought that in such a case the condition would 
not be broken at all, but it is submitted that the solution given here is better because 
there may be circumstances in which the buyer may justifiably wish to reject the goods, 
even though he has acquired a good legal title. For example, it seems that the legal title 
which is obtained under Part III of the Hire-Purchase Act 1964, where a private pur-
chaser buys a motor vehicle which is the subject of a hire-purchase agreement, is not 
in practice always a very satisfactory one. The reason for this is that if the buyer later 
wishes to sell or trade in the vehicle to a motor dealer, the dealer will in all probability 
discover the outstanding hire-purchase agreement and may well refuse to buy it. It seems, 
therefore, that the buyer should be entitled to reject the goods in such a case.40 And such 
a result would be justifiable because even though in these cases the seller has the power 
to confer a title on the buyer, he does not have what the Act specifically requires him to 
have, namely a ‘right to sell the goods’.
The effect of a breach of s. 12(1)

are (a) repudiation of the contract, and/or (b) a claim for damages, while in Scotland he

may terminate the contract if the breach is material, and/or claim damages. In addition, 
there are in England and Wales common law remedies of a restitutionary character, such 
as the right to recover money paid when there is a total failure of consideration.41 Section 
54 preserves these common law rights by enacting that:
Nothing in this Act affects the right of the buyer . . . to recover money paid where the consider-
ation for the payment of it has failed.
In the usual case, the buyer will not stand to gain financially from choosing to repu-
diate the contract rather than sue for damages. The reason is that he cannot retain 
any benefit under the contract if he wishes to repudiate it, nor does the restitutionary 
remedy preserved by s. 54 usually help because ex hypothesi there must have been a total 
failure of consideration, and the buyer cannot therefore have obtained any benefit under 
the contract. A fair summary of the normal position, therefore, would be that the buyer 
cannot both have his cake and eat it.
In the case of a breach of the condition implied by s. 12(1), however, it appears that 
the buyer can do just this. The leading case is Rowland v Divall.42 The plaintiff bought 
a car from the defendant for £334 and resold it for £400 to a sub-buyer who used it for 
four months. He then discovered that the car had never belonged to the defendant, who 
had bought it in good faith from someone without title. The car having been claimed by 
the original owner, the plaintiff paid off the sub-buyer by refunding him the £400 and 
claimed to recover, in turn, the £334 which he had paid the defendant. It was held by the 
Court of Appeal that the buyer was entitled to recover the whole purchase price and that 
the seller was not entitled to set off anything for the four months’ use of the car which 
the sub-buyer had enjoyed.43 Atkin LJ observed:44
The buyer has not received any part of that which he contracted to receive – namely, the property 
and right to possession – and, that being so, there has been a total failure of consideration.45
The full implications of this decision are shown by two later cases. In Karflex Ltd v 
Poole46 the palintiffs were hire-purchase dealers who bought a car from one K and hired 
it to the defendant with the usual option to purchase on payment of all the instalments. 
The defendant paid the deposit and took possession of the car, but he defaulted on the

43	 It is not clear whether Scots law would reach the same result. In the only Scottish case on breach of s. 12(1) 
the buyer recovered the full price paid, but as damages rather than restitution (Spink & Co v McColl 1992 
SLT 471). Thus in principle recovery should be based upon what the buyer has lost through the breach, 
which, being normally the value of the goods at the date of eviction, may be more, less, or the same as the 
original price. However, the seller appears to have no claim against the buyer, since the latter’s enrichment 
through the use of the goods has been at the expense of the true owner, not of the seller.

view criticised by Ho (1997) 56 CLJ 571, at pp. 582 et seq. The merits of the case are somewhat complicated 
by the fact that, in the end, the buyer was able to get the car back on payment of £260. His claim for the full 
£334 which he paid thus seems to have been somewhat unfair, apart altogether from the fact that no account 
was taken of the use made of the car by the sub-buyer.

first instalment and the plaintiffs commenced proceedings against him. It then transpired 
that K had never been the owner of the car at all, but the plaintiffs paid off the true 
owner and proceeded with their action against the defendant. It was held by a Divisional 
Court that the action failed because the plaintiffs were in breach of an implied condition 
that they had a right to sell the goods, since at the date of the delivery of the car they 
had no such right. The defendant, therefore, who had defaulted in payment of the very 
first instalment was held entitled to repudiate the contract and, indeed, to recover his 
deposit despite the fact that he had not been evicted by the true owner, and that by the 
time the case came on for trial there was no possibility of eviction because the original 
owners had been paid off. This was not actually a case of sale but of hire-purchase, but 
the court regarded the principles applicable as the same. Since then, the implied condi-
tion as to title in s. 12(1) of the Sale of Goods Act has been extended, with only essential 
alterations in the wording, to hire-purchase contracts,47 so at least it seems clear that the 
same principle must apply in the two cases.48
The second case is Butterworth v Kingsway Motors Ltd,49 where A took delivery of a 
car under a contract of hire-purchase. Mistakenly thinking that she had a right to sell it 
subject to her continuing to pay the instalments, she purported to sell it to B. B sold it to 
C, who sold it to the defendant, and the defendant sold it to the plaintiff. After the plain-
tiff had had the use of the car for no less than 111/2 months, he received a notification 
from the original hire-purchase dealers, who were of course still the owners of the car, 
claiming the delivery up to them of the vehicle. Seeing the opportunities which presented 
themselves, the plaintiff lost no time in writing to the defendants, claiming the return 
of the entire purchase price which he had paid. Within one week of this, A paid off 
the balance of the hire-purchase price to the original owners. The defendant might have 
been forgiven for thinking that this payment removed all difficulties and closed the trans-
action because the payment vested the title to the car in A, and this title ‘went to feed’ 
the defective titles of the subsequent purchasers. It was held, however, that the plaintiff 
was entitled to recover the full purchase price of £1,275 as the defendant had been guilty 
of a breach of s. 12(1). As the market had dropped in the meantime, the car was worth 
only about £800 at the date when the plaintiff repudiated the contract. Consequently, 
the Act enabled him to make a handsome profit of £475, a fact which no doubt explains 
the learned judge’s view that ‘the plaintiff’s position was somewhat lacking in merits’.50
It is indeed possible to imagine circumstances, by no means unrealistic, which are far 
more extreme than those in the above cases. For example, suppose that A buys a crate 
of whisky from B. Suppose further that after consuming the whisky, A discovers that it

48	 As well as to an express term – see Barber v NSW Bank plc [1996] 1 All ER 906. The same implied condition 
now applies, mutatis mutandis, in other contracts for the transfer of goods by virtue of the Supply of Goods 
and Services Act 1982, ss. 2 and 7. The latter section applies to cases of hire where, however, it would seem 
even more troublesome to apply the decision in Rowland v Divall.
49	 [1954] 1 WLR 1286.
50	 At p. 1291. Pearson J here left open the question whether the plaintiff would have succeeded had he not 
claimed the return of his money before A paid off the owners. In New South Wales it has been held that if 
the seller obtains title (for example, by paying off the true owner) before the buyer seeks to repudiate the 
contract, it will then be too late for the buyer to recover his price: Patten v Thomas Motors Pty Ltd [1965] 
NSWR 1457.

	 90	 The duties of the seller
never belonged to B but that B had bought it in good faith from a thief. Is it to be said 
that A can recover the full purchase price on the ground that there has been a total fail-
ure of consideration? This suggestion is perhaps not quite so ridiculous as might appear 
at first sight because the consumption of the whisky lays the consumer open to an action 
of conversion by the true owner. There would be nothing absurd about a rule which 
enabled the buyer to recover the full price from the seller if he were compelled to pay the 
value of the goods to the true owner. But the difficulty about Rowland v Divall is that 
the right of the buyer to recover the full price is not made dependent on a claim by the 
real owner. It is quite possible, especially where stolen goods have changed hands several 
times, that the real owner may never be traced at all. Again, it is quite possible that the 
real owner may choose to sue the seller rather than the buyer for conversion. Indeed, he 
will probably sue the first solvent person in the chain because the damages will probably 
be higher. If such were to happen in the hypothetical case above, the remarkable result 
would seem to follow that B would have to pay the whole price back to A, on the one 
hand, and the whole value again to the true owner, while A, on the other hand, will have 
had a free crate of whisky.
One possible way of avoiding this result might be as follows. Normally, a party who 
claims to repudiate a contract must return any benefits received.51 In Rowland v Divall, 
it was pointed out that the defendant could not complain that the car had not been 
returned to him for it was his very breach of condition that made this impossible. In 
the hypothetical case above, however, it might be argued that the plaintiff’s inability to 
return the goods is due to the fact that he has consumed the whisky. This does not dis-
pose of all difficulty, however, for if the plaintiff is to be met by this argument the injus-
tice may well be on the other side. The true owner may yet turn up and choose to sue the 
buyer for conversion.52 In this case the buyer, having failed to recover his price from the 
seller, may then have to pay the value of the goods to the true owner. But the solution to 
this difficulty in England and Wales may be to recognise the buyer’s right to seek con-
tribution or indemnity from the seller under the Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978.
It may thus be possible to deal with the case discussed above so as to achieve sub-
stantial justice in the end. But this does not eliminate the serious injustice of such cases 
as Butterworth v Kingsway Motors Ltd. Nor does it dispose of the main objection to 
Rowland v Divall, which is that the decision rests basically on a fallacy. The object of 
a contract of sale is surely to transfer to the buyer the use and enjoyment of the goods 
free from any adverse third-party claims. If the buyer has such use and enjoyment and 
no third-party claim is made against him, it seems unrealistic to talk of a total failure of 
consideration.
These problems have been examined by law reform agencies over a period of sev-
eral years. In 1966, the Law Reform Committee recommended in their Twelfth Report53 
51	 That is why, in Azzurri Communications Limited v SOS Communications, the only claim was one for 
damages once Azzuri had agreed to return all the handsets infringing the manufacturer’s trademark back 
to the manufacturer (accepted by the judge as a commercially sensible decision) and was therefore unable to 
return them to SOS, the supplier.
52	 Again, a doctrine to which there is no equivalent in Scots law. It would appear, however, that the true owner 
might have an unjustified enrichment claim for recompense in these circumstances: see further Evans-Jones, 
Unjustified Enrichment vol 2 (2013, W Green & Son Ltd, Edinburgh), Chapter 4.
53	 Cmnd 2958, 1966, para. 36.

	
	 	
The existence of the goods and the duty to pass a good title	 91
that the buyer should not be allowed to recover the price in full in a Rowland v Divall 
situation with no allowance for the use he has had of the goods.54 Since then the Law 
Commission has re-examined the problem on several different occasions. At first the 
Law Commission, while agreeing in principle with this recommendation, pointed out 
a number of practical difficulties in the proposal.55 They concluded that no satisfactory 
amendment of s. 12 could be proposed until a study had been made of the rules relating 
to the law of restitution and the 1973 Supply of Goods (Implied Terms) Act did not, 
therefore, deal with this question. Since then two other Law Commission papers con-
tinued to take the view that the rule in Rowland v Divall ought to be abolished, and the 
buyer victim of a breach of s. 12(1) should only be entitled to damages rather than the 
return of his whole price.56
But in 1987, after still further consideration, the Law Commission finally abandoned 
all attempts to deal with Rowland v Divall.57 The reasons for this change of front appear 
to have been twofold. First, the Commission was not satisfied that justice requires that 
a buyer from a seller without title should have to pay him for the use he has had of the 
goods. Why, asked the Commission rhetorically, should the buyer have to pay the seller 
for the use of someone else’s goods? But the second reason appears the dominant one, 
and that is the sheer complexity of trying to work out a set of rules which copes ade-
quately with the intricate relationship between s. 12(1) of the Act and the law of conver-
sion. It is undoubtedly true that this interrelationship makes any detailed solution very 
hard, but the answer may well lie not in abandoning all attempt at reform, but rather in 
abandoning the attempt to reform the law by working out the detailed rules in advance. 
After all, this has never been the common law’s preferred methodology, and it would 
surely have been possible to give the court a little discretion to adjust the normal rules as 
to damages under s. 12(1). It does seem lamentable to tolerate the injustice which arose 
in Butterworth v Kingsway Motors Ltd (and this, surely, was gross injustice, despite the 
Law Commission’s rhetorical question) merely because the problem seems too complex 
to permit of a detailed legislative solution in terms of rules.
This particular problem does not seem to have arisen in other contexts. It is, how-
ever, possible that a similar situation could occur where goods are rejected for breach 
of one of the terms as to quality or fitness. In practice, this has not hitherto been a 
serious problem in such cases because the buyer is usually treated as having accepted 
the goods after a very short period of use.58 However, problems with title can occur 
after a considerable lapse of time. In the United States, the majority response to this 
problem seems to be to award the plaintiff the value of the goods at the time disposses-
sion occurred, plus any incidental damages that can be proved, on the principle that the

section.
58	 See below, p. 454.

	 92	 The duties of the seller
plaintiff should be compensated for what has been lost, and surely this is the value at the 
time of dispossession?59
The 1979 Act (following the 1973 amendments) has cleared up one other problem. 
The opening words of s. 12(1) of the 1893 Act60 originally contemplated the possibility 
of the parties contracting out of the implied conditions as to title. In exceptional cir-
cumstances, a person may agree to buy goods from a bona fide possessor expressly sub-
ject to all defects in title. Goods seized and sold under a distress warrant, for instance, 
are sold without any warranty of title.61 In such a case it is usual to sell merely the ‘title 
and interest’ of the debtor, whatever that may be. This means, for example, that the 
buyer takes the risk that the goods may not belong to the tenant, but may be held by him 
under a hire-purchase agreement. Under the new s. 12(3) and (4), the possibility of a sale 
of a limited interest is spelt out more clearly. The position now is that, where the parties 
intend only to transfer such title as the seller (or a third party) may have, there is an 
implied warranty that all charges or encumbrances known to the seller and not known 
to the buyer have been disclosed to the buyer before the contract is made. Moreover, 
under ss. 6(1) and 20 of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 the seller cannot contract 
out of this liability.62
In general, this simplifies and clarifies the law, though one slightly odd result of these 
provisions seems to be that the seller cannot now contract out of s. 12(1) even to the 
extent that this goes beyond the implication of title. In Niblett v Confectioners’ Mate-
rials Co,63 for example, (the facts of which have already been given), it appears to have 
been assumed by all the members of the court that the seller would not have been liable 
had there been a contrary intention which negatived the implication that the sale of the 
tins would not constitute an infringement of a trademark. This would seem no longer 
possible. Given the uncertain ambit of the rights conferred by many forms of intellectual 
property, especially patents, this seems unjustifiable. The only practical solution where 
the parties are prepared to deal on the basis that it is uncertain whether or not intellec-
tual property rights are infringed would appear to be insurance.
One final problem arising out of Rowland v Divall concerns the relationship between 
the condition implied by s. 12(1) and s. 11(4). This latter clause, which has enough dif-
ficulties of its own, will be fully discussed later,64 but something must be said about 
it here. This clause states that when the buyer has accepted the goods he is no longer 
entitled to reject them for breach of condition but is relegated to a claim for damages. 
In Rowland v Divall,65 it was contended that this clause precluded the buyer from recov-
ering his full price, and compelled him to sue for damages, but the court rejected this

The existence of the goods and the duty to pass a good title	 93
argument apparently on the ground that there can be no sale at all where the seller has 
no right to sell the goods. This involves saying that s. 11(4) has no application at all to 
breaches of s. 12(1) and Atkin LJ went to the length of saying precisely that. It is, how-
ever, difficult to find any warrant for this view in the Act itself.66
Warranty of freedom from encumbrances  
and of quiet possession
The new s. 12(2), which amalgamates, with amendments, the original s. 12(2) and (3), 
provides that (except where a limited interest is sold) there is an implied warranty that:
(a)	 the goods are free, and will remain free until the time when the property is to pass, from 
any charge or encumbrance not disclosed or known to the buyer before the contract is 
made, and
(b)	 the buyer will enjoy quiet possession of the goods except so far as it may be disturbed by the 
owner or other person entitled to the benefit of any charge or encumbrance so disclosed or 
known.
In Rubicon Computer Systems Ltd v United Paints Ltd,67 a dispute arose between the 
parties to a contract to install a computer system. The supplier, who had access to the 
system after installation, wrongfully attached a time-lock to it, which when activated 
denied the defendants access to their own system. It was held that the claimants were in 
breach of s. 12(2)(b). Other than in cases such as this, it is not easy to see what additional 
rights this confers on the buyer over and above those conferred by s. 12(1) (especially 
s. 12(2)(a)). At first sight it might appear that s. 12(1) was intended to give the buyer a 
right to recover no more than the price of the goods, whereas a breach of s. 12(2) might 
entitle the buyer to recover additional damages. But this explanation is untenable for, as 
Singleton LJ pointed out in Mason v Burningham:68
In any event if there was a breach of the implied condition the [claimant] was entitled to treat 
that as a breach of warranty.
In this case, the claimant recovered damages under the old s. 12(2) covering the cost of repairs 
done to a typewriter, in addition to the price, when it appeared that the seller was not the true 
owner.69 More recently, the combined breach of s.12(1) and s.12(2) in Azzurri Communica-
tions Limited v SOS Communications meant that Azzurri could recover not only the full cost 
of buying replacement handsets from an authorized wholesaler, but also additional expenses 
incurred in terms of staff time for removing and replacing the affected handsets.
66	 Moreover, it has been said that if the buyer is aware of the seller’s lack of title there can be an acceptance 
within s. 11(4) (formerly s. 11(1)(c)): see per Devlin J in Kwei Tek Chao v British Traders & Shippers Ltd 
[1954] 2 WLR 365, 372, where he also points out that the contract in Rowland v Divall was voidable and 
not void. These remarks are omitted from the report at [1954] 2 QB 459. As to this, see the note in (1955) 18 
MLR 496.

customs authorities was held entitled to recover what he had to pay to secure the release of the car, although 
this was more than the purchase price. Cf. Darbishire v Warran [1963] 1 WLR 1067, a case in tort.
69	 On such facts it would now be a serious question whether the cost of the repairs would be recoverable from 
the seller. Under s. 6 of the Torts (Interference with Goods) Act 1977, the plaintiff should be able to keep the 
typewriter, merely paying its unimproved value to the owner as damages.

	 94	 The duties of the seller
The scope of s. 12(2) is not entirely clear. A ‘charge or encumbrance’ presumably 
means a proprietary or possibly a possessory right, and does not extend to a mere con-
tractual right.70 It seems that s. 12(2) would protect the buyer against a wrongful dis-
turbance of his possession by the seller himself;71 in this situation the remedy under s. 
12(2) would overlap with a right of action in tort. Where the disturbance of the buyer’s 
possession is by a third party, the buyer may be entitled to treat this disturbance as the 
responsibility of the seller if, as a result of any acts or defaults of the seller, some third 
party with whom the seller is in contractual relations asserts an encumbrance or lien on 
the goods.72
But if the third party acts independently, the buyer can probably only rely on the sub-
section where the third party’s act was a lawful act.73 A seller can hardly be taken to war-
rant that no third party will ever tortiously interfere with the buyer’s possession in the 
future.74 The analogous covenant for quiet possession on a sale of land did not protect 
a buyer in England when he was evicted by title paramount (i.e. by a party with a title 
superior to the seller’s), but that was because of the peculiar rule that a vendor of land 
did not warrant that he had a good title.75 Accordingly, this qualification was thought 
not to apply to the old subs. (2)76 and this seems clearly to be confirmed by the present 
version of the implied warranty in s. 12(2).
Even where the third party’s act is a lawful one, it will not amount to a breach of 
s. 12(2) unless it is based on rights to the goods which subsisted at the time when they 
were sold to the buyer.77 In The Barenbels78 the sale of a ship was expressly guaranteed 
‘free from all encumbrances and maritime liens’, but this express term (which obviously 
closely resembles the implied term in s. 12(2)) was held not broken where the ship was 
seized by a foreign court as a way of compelling the seller to pay debts to a creditor pre-
viously incurred in connection with the ship. Although the debts themselves pre-existed 
the contract of sale here, the creditor’s actual rights in the ship itself only came from 
the foreign court order, and they did not pre-date the sale. So the creditor had no pro-
prietary or even possessory rights in the ship at the time of the contract of sale, and the 
creditor’s rights were therefore held not to be encumbrances within the express terms of 
the contract.79At first sight, it may seem difficult to distinguish this case from Rubicon 
Computer Systems Ltd v United Paints Ltd.80 The difference is that the supplier of the 
computer system was a party to the original contract, and was performing under it when

The existence of the goods and the duty to pass a good title	 95
it wrongfully attached the time lock. In The Barenbels what was involved was third-
party rights, and no third-party rights to the goods existed until the court orders were 
made, which was after the contract containing the above warranty was made.81 On the 
other hand, in Great Elephant Corporation v Trafigura Beheer B.V,82 a buyer success-
fully established that there was a breach of s. 12(2)(b) when a ship, having loaded a cargo 
of oil, was prevented from leaving the port.
There are two other possible distinctions between the effects of s. 12(1) and (2): first, 
time under the Limitation Act would run against the buyer from the moment of sale 
under subs. (1), while under subs. (2) it is now clear that there is a continuing warranty 
of quiet possession. Consequently, time will only run against the buyer under (2) from 
the time his possession is disturbed.83 Secondly, as we have already seen, there are some 
rare circumstances in which a person may have a ‘right to sell’ goods and yet may not be 
able to sell them free from some third party’s rights. In such a case, a buyer would have 
a remedy under s. 12(2) but not under s. 12(1). We have already noted the example of a 
debtor who sells goods which have already been ‘seized’ (but not physically removed) by 
the sheriff under a writ of execution. The debtor has a right to sell the goods (at least 
until they are sold by the sheriff) but he sells them subject to the sheriff’s rights. If, then, 
the buyer has to surrender the goods, he has an action for breach of s. 12(2).84
The practical operation of that part of s. 12(1)(b) dealing with freedom from encum-
brances is limited because the law does not generally recognise real encumbrances over 
chattels by a person not in possession, and even equity only does so subject to the rights 
of the bona fide purchaser without notice. If, therefore, the third party is not in pos-
session of the goods, he can rarely have an encumbrance which will be binding on the 
purchaser; on the other hand, if he is in possession the buyer has no need to rely on this 
subsection because the seller will simply be unable to make delivery. The buyer, there-
fore, will not be bound to pay the price or, if he has already paid it, will be entitled to 
recover it.85
But there are important exceptions to this general position. In particular, charges or 
encumbrances on ships (and aircraft) are common, and these may be valid and binding 
on a subsequent owner. So a buyer of a ship may be affected by such charges or encum-
brances previously created, and for this reason these are usually the subject of express 
terms in a contract for the sale of a ship. But even in the absence of an express term, 
s. 12(2) would protect a buyer. Another exceptional type of case where s. 12(2) may be 
useful would arise if, for example, a person pledged goods but obtained delivery from 
the pledgee for some limited purpose. An unauthorised sale by the pledgor would enable 
the buyer to invoke this part of s. 12(2) against him, although he could not allege a

breach of s. 12(1) because the seller had a right to sell the goods, though subject to the 
rights of the pledgee.86 Another, very exceptional, case is illustrated by the decision in 
Microbeads A G v Vinhurst Road Markings Ltd,87 where the Court of Appeal awarded 
damages to a buyer under the old s. 12(2). In this case, the buyer’s quiet possession had 
been disturbed by a patentee whose patent was only granted after the sale in question, 
so that there had been no breach of s. 12(1) at the time of the sale.88 This decision is dif-
ficult to reconcile with The Barenbels, dealt with above. The difference may be this. The 
causal events which led to the grant of the patent were in train at the time the contract 
was made, though until publication of the specification neither party could know this. 
By contrast, the seizure of the ship was one of a number of options no doubt open to 
the foreign court as a way of compelling the payment of the debts in question; there was 
nothing at the time the contract was made which inevitably led to the seizure of the ship. 
However, it should be noted that the decision in Microbeads has been criticised.89 How-
ever, more recently, in Azzurri Communications Limited v SOS Communications, the 
buyer’s quiet possession had been disturbed by identification of a trademark infringe-
ment by the manufacturer and subsequent proceedings, which were settled by deliver-
ing-up the affected handsets to the manufacturer.

The duty to deliver the goods
The duty to deliver
Under s. 27 of the Act:
It is the duty of the seller to deliver the goods, and of the buyer to accept and pay for them, in 
accordance with the terms of the contract of sale.
Aside from the fact that the seller it is not generally bound to ‘deliver’ the goods, in the 
sense of physically dispatching them to the buyer (although the buyer is bound to take 
them), the duty of the seller to deliver the goods is a somewhat ambiguous concept cov-
ering three different possibilities.
There may be a duty to deliver to the buyer goods in which the property has already 
passed. Here the duty is specific and, subject to the question of payment, it is a duty 
which will be breached should the seller fail to deliver those particular goods. If the 
property has already passed, there can be no question of the seller substituting some 
other goods without the consent of the buyer. He must deliver those particular goods 
and no others will do.
Alternatively, the seller’s duty to deliver may be a duty to procure and supply goods to 
the buyer in accordance with the contract, but without designating any particular goods  
that are to be delivered. Therefore, in a contract for the sale of purely generic  
goods the sellers is one sense bound to deliver ‘the goods’, but there is no duty to deliver 
any particular lot of those goods. Until such a duty arises, the seller is free to deliver 
any particular quantity of goods that meet the contract description. If the seller were 
to procure goods answering the contract description, intending to use those in perfor-
mance of the contract, but changes his mind and sells them to someone else, the buyer 
cannot complain that the seller has broken his duty to deliver.1 Nor can the buyer obtain 
a decree of specific performance in such a case.2
There is a third possibility mid-way between the first two. It may be that the seller 
is under a personal duty to deliver a particular lot of goods although the property has 
not yet passed to the buyer. This is always so in the case of an agreement to sell specific 
goods, and clearly the seller cannot resell those goods without being guilty of a breach 
of contract. Even in the sale of unascertained goods, it is possible for the seller’s duty 
to deliver to attach to a particular lot of goods before the property passes. This, for 
example, is the effect of a notice of appropriation in a c.i.f. contract which does not pass 
	1	 See Carlos Federspiel & Co SA v Charles Twigg & Co Ltd [1957] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 255–6, per Pearson J. The 
relevant passage is cited below, p. 264.
	2	 Because such a decree can only be granted where the goods are ‘specific or ascertained’ – see below, p. 465. 
Specific implement in Scotland may be different – see below, p. 465, n. 4.

	 98	 The duties of the seller
the property, but fixes the goods to be delivered. Similarly, in a f.o.b. contract where the 
seller ships goods but retains the bill of lading as security, the seller will come under an 
obligation to deliver to the buyer the actual goods shipped, though the property remains 
in the seller for the moment.3
These three possibilities are not mutually exclusive, but three stages in the perfor-
mance of the contract. The duty to deliver may start by being unattached to any particu-
lar goods, may then become attached and, finally, the property may pass. On the other 
hand, the three stages may be merged into one, as in a sale of specific goods, or two 
of them may be merged, where goods are appropriated to a contract fixing the duty to 
deliver and passing the property at the same time.
It should also be noted that the legal meaning of ‘delivery’ is very different from the 
popular meaning. In law, delivery means the ‘voluntary transfer of possession’, which 
is a different thing from the dispatch of the goods. There is, indeed, no general rule 
requiring the seller to dispatch the goods to the buyer, for under s. 29:
(1)	 Whether it is for the buyer to take possession of the goods or for the seller to send them to 
the buyer is a question depending in each case on the contract, express or implied, between 
the parties.
(2)	 Apart from any such contract, express or implied, the place of delivery is the seller’s place 
of business, if he has one, and if not, his residence; except that, if the contract is for the 
sale of specific goods, which to the knowledge of the parties when the contract is made are 
in some other place, then that place is the place of delivery.
This section, therefore, does two things. First, it creates a presumption that in a sale 
of specific goods the place of delivery is the place where the goods are known to be at 
the time of the contract. Secondly, it lays down that in all other cases, in the absence of 
any special agreement, the place of delivery is the seller’s place of business and, failing 
that, his residence. Therefore, in the absence of a contrary intention, it is the duty of 
the buyer to collect the goods and not of the seller to send them. However, a contrary 
intention will frequently and readily be inferred from the circumstances of the case; for 
example, where a buyer ordered certain goods from the seller in the form: ‘Please supply 
us with the following goods’, an Australian court held that it was the seller’s duty to 
send the goods to the buyer.4 As the court said:
Purchasers who intend to purchase goods from people whose business it is to sell them do not 
as a rule send in advance an order for these goods to be supplied, if their intention is to go to 
the shop or warehouse of the sellers and there purchase them.5
Despite the general rule laid down in s. 29 that it is not for the seller to send the goods 
to the buyer, it is his responsibility to see that the goods are in a ‘deliverable state’. Thus 
s. 29(6) enacts that:
Unless otherwise agreed, the expenses of and incidental to putting the goods into a deliverable 
state must be borne by the seller.

The duty to deliver the goods	 99
The meaning of this phrase is considered later.6
Where the seller is, properly speaking, under a duty to dispatch the goods to the buyer, 
then this duty is absolute in the absence of frustrating circumstances; that is to say, the 
seller cannot plead that he was unable to dispatch the goods through no fault of his own, 
or that he had taken all reasonable care in dispatching them. But a duty to deliver the 
goods at the buyer’s premises is discharged by delivery to a respectable-looking person 
at these premises even though it should prove that he was not authorised to take delivery 
on behalf of the buyer.7
Payment and delivery concurrent conditions
Under s. 28 of the Act:
Unless otherwise agreed, delivery of the goods and payment of the price are concurrent 
conditions, that is to say, the seller must be ready and willing to give possession of the goods to 
the buyer in exchange for the price, and the buyer must be ready and willing to pay the price in 
exchange for possession of the goods.
It is not necessary for the seller actually to tender delivery before being entitled to 
sue for the price or for damages if it is clear that the buyer would have refused to accept 
the goods, but it is enough that he (the seller) was ready and willing to do so.8 And, 
similarly, a buyer need not formally tender the price before becoming entitled to sue for 
non-delivery provided that he was ready and willing to do so.
But although the seller does not have to make a formal tender of delivery, he must 
have ‘not only the disposition but the capacity to perform the contract’.9 Moreover, a 
party is not precluded from relying upon one ground for repudiation merely because at 
the time he gave another and unjustifiable reason for repudiating. So if the buyer repu-
diates the contract in advance, and shows that he will not accept the goods if delivered 
or tendered, the mere fact that he gave an unjustified reason for this will not prevent him 
afterwards proving that the seller could not in fact have performed the contract. This 
rule, however, must be reconciled with another established proposition, namely that if 
the buyer wrongfully repudiates the contract, the seller can accept the buyer’s repudia-
tion and then maintain an action even though it is shown that he did not have the capac-
ity to perform the contract when the buyer repudiated it. If the buyer meets the seller’s 
claim for damages by pleading that, notwithstanding that he previously gave an unjus-
tified reason for repudiating, the seller was himself in breach in failing to deliver at the 
appointed time (or, in the case of a repudiation by the buyer before the time for delivery, 
that the seller would not have been able to deliver at the appointed time), these two prin-
ciples appear, at first sight, to conflict.

	100	 The duties of the seller
Fortunately, the difficulty in stating the law was cleared up by the House of Lords 
in Fercometal SARL v Mediterranean Shipping Co SA,10 although difficulties in the 
application of the law may continue. In the Fercometal case, charterers of a vessel were 
informed by the owners that the vessel would not arrive in time to load in accordance 
with the terms of the charterparty. The charterers then purported to cancel the charter, 
which they had no right to do, as there was at that time no right of cancellation under 
the charter. But the owners in any event refused to accept this repudiation and insisted 
that the vessel would, after all, be ready to load on time. These assurances were false, 
however, and the vessel never was ready to load on time. The charterers having persisted 
in their refusal to load, the owners eventually sued them for damages for breach of the 
charterparty, and the charterers responded by pleading that the owners were never in a 
position to perform the contract. This defence was upheld. The House of Lords insisted 
that an anticipatory repudiation must either be accepted or refused. If accepted, the con-
tract is then terminated, and the innocent party is freed from his duty of performance. 
But if the repudiation is rejected, the innocent party keeps the contract alive for all pur-
poses. His own duty to perform is kept alive, together with the duty of the guilty party. 
So he then must be able to perform the contract when performance is due. There is no 
third alternative, by which the innocent party can keep the contract alive, while himself 
being absolved from performance.
The first possibility – that the seller’s duty to deliver has been terminated by accept-
ance of the buyer’s repudiation – is illustrated by another decision of the House of 
Lords, namely Gill & Duffus SA v Berger & Co Inc.11 In this case, the sellers contracted 
to sell 500 tons of Argentina Bolita beans and undertook to provide a certificate of qual-
ity. The goods were delivered in two loads; the first of 445 tons was covered by a certif-
icate but the buyers wrongly rejected the certificate, and repudiated the contract. The 
sellers as a result failed to tender a certificate for the other 55 tons, and in the Court of 
Appeal it was held that this failure was fatal to the sellers’ claim. But the House of Lords 
reversed this decision, holding that the buyer’s repudiation had been accepted by the 
sellers before the certificate for the second load of goods was required to be presented, 
and that that duty accordingly never arose at all. (It does not seem to have been argued 
by the buyers that the failure to deliver the whole 500 tons in one load was itself a breach 
of contract by the sellers.)12
Although Fercometal was not a sale of goods case, it is clear that the principles dis-
cussed there are of general application. Indeed, one of the earlier cases, much discussed  
in the Fercometal case, was also a case of sale of goods. This was Braithwaite v  
Foreign Hardwood Co Ltd,13 where the plaintiff had agreed to sell to the defendant 100 
tons of Honduras rosewood, delivery in two instalments. The plaintiff shipped about 
63 tons, but the defendant then heard that the plaintiff had shipped 468 tons to another 
buyer, and he regarded this as a breach of a collateral oral contract. He therefore repu-
diated the contract, but the seller insisted that the goods were already at sea, and he 
was ready to deliver the bill of lading. The defendant refused to take it, and the seller

The duty to deliver the goods	 101
eventually resold elsewhere. The defendant later discovered that part of the timber any-
how did not conform to the contract, and, when sued for damages for non-acceptance, 
he pleaded that the sellers could not have performed for this reason. The buyer’s defence 
was rejected by the Court of Appeal, and for many years the basis of this decision was 
controverted; however, the House of Lords in the Fercometal case has now explained this 
decision as resting on the fact that although the seller first refused to accept the buyer’s 
repudiation, he did eventually accept it. That ultimate acceptance, therefore, terminated 
the contract, and with it the seller’s duty to deliver conforming goods. Hence the buyers 
were no longer entitled to raise this point.
The Fercometal case thus clarifies the law, but to some degree the clarification of the 
law itself was only achieved by leaving open for solution in particular cases certain diffi-
culties of application. Whenever a buyer wrongfully repudiates in advance and indicates 
that he will not take delivery and the seller at first refuses to accept this as terminating 
the contract, some uncertainty will remain as to the resultant outcome if the contract 
remains unperformed. When the seller eventually realises that the buyer remains obdu-
rate, clearly he is likely to take certain steps such as not appropriating goods to the con-
tract, or arranging for their delivery, or alternatively, disposing of the goods elsewhere. 
Unless he can show that he did ultimately accept the repudiation he may then have to 
face the accusation that he did not have the capacity to perform at the time when deliv-
ery was due. This result would often seem quite unreasonable, and the House of Lords 
in the Fercometal case approved an alternative route by which the seller may succeed in 
such a case.
This alternative route is to hold that the seller was freed from his duty to deliver, 
not by the termination of the contract (i.e. by the acceptance of the repudiation) but 
by an estoppel or waiver. So far as the former possibility is concerned, if the buyer has 
clearly represented to the seller that there is no point in his attempting to deliver the 
goods because, come what may, he will not take them, and if the seller acts upon that 
representation (for instance, by not arranging for delivery or by disposing of the goods 
elsewhere), then the buyer will be estopped from complaining that the seller has after 
all failed in his duty to deliver. Thus here (as in many other areas of contract law) a rep-
resentation, followed by action in reliance, is in effect treated as an alternative ground 
for achieving results normally achieved by offer and acceptance, or (as here) by repudia-
tion and acceptance.
All this is admirably clear in theory and legal principle. But it seems probable that it 
will in practice cause difficulties of application because it will often be difficult to say 
whether a repeated repudiation which is first rejected has ultimately been accepted, or 
whether it gives rise to an estoppel, or whether the seller’s duty to deliver remains alive. 
A further complicating factor, which did not arise in the Fercometal case, but which 
could often arise in contracts of sale, is that a resale of the goods by the seller, following 
a repudiation by the buyer, may rescind the contract under s. 48(3) or (4), whatever the 
general common law rules as to acceptance of a repudiation may be.14
Yet another complicating possibility is that the seller may occasionally be able to 
rely on the doctrine of waiver. Under this doctrine one party may waive performance 
14	 See below, p. 401.

	102	 The duties of the seller
of an act which would otherwise be a condition precedent to the performance of 
his own obligations. In this event, the other party is entitled to sue for breach of 
contract even though he could not have fulfilled his own contractual duties as a result 
of non-performance of that condition. Clearly the doctrines of waiver and estoppel 
largely overlap here, as they so often do, and it is not even certain that they are really 
distinct doctrines.15 In Peter Turnbull & Co Ltd v Mundas Trading Co (Australasia) 
Ltd,16 the defendants contracted to sell a quantity of oats to the plaintiffs f.o.b. 
Sydney, to be loaded on a ship nominated by the buyers in January or February 1951, 
the buyers to give 14 days’ notice of nomination. The plaintiffs informally told the 
defendants that they would want delivery about 14 February and intimated that they 
would nominate the Afric. The sellers later told the buyers that they could not deliver 
f.o.b. Sydney, but offered delivery f.o.b. Melbourne instead. Negotiations followed in 
which the buyers sought to persuade sub-buyers to accept delivery f.o.b. Melbourne, 
but without success. On 23 February, the buyers told the sellers that they would insist 
on delivery f.o.b. Sydney, the sellers stated flatly that they could not make such deliv-
ery and the buyers thereupon bought in the market at an increased price. The Afric 
did not in fact arrive in Sydney till March. In an action by the buyers for damages for 
non-delivery, the sellers pleaded that they were excused from non-delivery because the 
buyers had not made the required nomination and that owing to the late arrival of 
the Afric the buyers could not have taken delivery f.o.b. Sydney during the contract 
period. The Australian High Court held for the buyers because the sellers had ‘clearly 
intimated to the plaintiffs that it was useless to pursue the conditions of the contract 
applicable to shipment in Sydney and that the plaintiffs need not do so’.17 This was 
held to amount to a waiver of the buyer’s duty to take delivery in Sydney; but equally 
it seems the decision could have been based on estoppel, according to the requirements 
of that doctrine as laid down in the Fercometal case.
Although the seller must normally be ready and willing to deliver before he can claim 
that the buyer is in breach, it must be remembered that delivery has its usual legal mean-
ing of transfer of possession in law. The meaning of this will be examined shortly, but 
it must be noted that where goods are shipped, the shipping documents represent the 
goods, and so transfer of these transfers possession of the goods. It follows that when 
the seller is ready and willing to deliver the shipping documents, he is prima facie enti-
tled to demand payment of the price. A provision that payment shall only be due on 
delivery does not alter the position because delivery of the documents is equivalent to 
delivery of the goods. This was clearly laid down in the dissenting judgment of Kennedy 
15	 See, however, Adams (1972) 26 Conv (NS) 245 for an analysis of the possible conceptual bases of the 
common law doctrine of waiver. English authorities should be treated with caution in Scotland: see Armia

LJ in Biddell Bros Ltd v E Clemens Horst & Co Ltd,18 which was upheld in the House of 
Lords.19
It must also be borne in mind that if the goods have perished after the risk has passed 
to the buyer, then the seller’s right to receive payment ceases to depend upon his willing-
ness to deliver the goods.20 It is odd that s. 28 says nothing of this possibility.
One final point needs to be made about s. 28 which could otherwise be a source of 
confusion. The effect of the section is that, in the absence of a contrary agreement, the 
seller is entitled to demand payment when he is ready and willing to deliver. But it does 
not follow, if the buyer refuses to pay, and refuses to accept the proffered delivery, that 
the seller can sue for the price. To be entitled to demand payment of the price and to 
be entitled to sue for the price are two different things.21 If the buyer refuses to accept a 
good tender of delivery, the seller can, in general, sue for damages for non-acceptance 
only. His right to sue for the price normally arises only when the buyer actually accepts 
the delivery of the goods and the property passes to him. The point is discussed more 
fully at a later stage.22
The meaning of delivery
Section 61 defines delivery as a ‘voluntary transfer of possession’. It would be beyond 
the scope of this work to examine what exactly amounts to a voluntary transfer of pos-
session, suffice to say that for present purposes delivery may take one of the following 
forms.
There may be a physical transfer of the actual goods themselves. This is the most 
obvious case, and although difficult questions of law may arise in deciding whether the 
physical transfer is enough to transfer legal possession, we will not go into these here.
Secondly, the seller may transfer possession to the buyer by handing over to him the 
means of control over the goods; for example, the keys to the warehouse in which they 
are situated.23
Thirdly, s. 29(4) provides that:
Where the goods at the time of sale are in the possession of a third person, there is no delivery 
by seller to buyer unless and until the third person acknowledges to the buyer that he holds the 
goods on his behalf; but nothing in this section affects the operation of the issue or transfer of 
any document of title to goods.
This acknowledgment is called ‘attornment’ in English law and is of special impor-
tance where the goods are in the custody of warehousemen. Where the seller gives the 
buyer a delivery order or warrant for goods stored in a warehouse, this does not transfer

possession or property until the warehousekeeper attorns by accepting the order or war-
rant.24 Mere receipt of the delivery order without any comment does not, without more, 
amount to an attornment.25 In Scots law, s. 29(4) appears to narrow slightly the common 
law rule that where the thing to be transferred is in the hands of a third party, holding 
subject to the transferor’s instructions, delivery can be made and completed by the giv-
ing and acceptance of such instructions.26
Fourthly, the goods may be delivered by the delivery of documents of title thereto.  
A document of title is defined by s. 1(4) of the Factors Act 1889 (extended to Scotland by 
the Factors (Scotland) Act 1890) as:
Any bill of lading, dock warrant, warehousekeeper’s certificate, and warrant or order for the 
delivery of goods, and any other document used in the ordinary course of business as proof 
of the possession or control of goods, or authorising or purporting to authorise, either by 
endorsement or by delivery, the possessor of the documents to transfer or receive goods thereby 
represented.
This definition, which is rather vague, appears to cover any document showing that 
the holder is entitled to claim the property specified in it.27 The peculiar ­feature 
of documents of title is that the mere transfer or endorsement of the document,  
if accompanied by the necessary intention, suffices to transfer the possession and the 
property in the goods, even without attornment. By far the most important type of 
document of title is the bill of lading. When goods are shipped, the shipowner or his 
agent delivers to the shipper a bill of lading, and this document ‘in law and in fact 
represents the goods. Possession of the bill of lading places the goods at the disposal 
of the purchaser’.28 There seem to be few other kinds of documents of title in British 
commercial practice today, presumably because it is not customary for warehouse-
keepers’ receipts and similar documents to authorise or to purport to authorise the 
holder to claim the goods by mere endorsement or delivery of the receipt without 
attornment by the warehousekeeper.29 But it has been held that a delivery order may 
in certain circumstances be a document of title,30 as also may railway receipts if suit-
ably worded.31 Moreover, under some private Acts of Parliament, certain warehouse-
keepers’ delivery warrants are specially made documents of title and, indeed, in some 
cases they are fully negotiable instruments, so that an innocent transferee obtains a

good title despite the transferor’s lack of title.32 Bills of lading are not, of course, 
fully negotiable in this sense.
Fifthly, the parties may agree that the seller should hold the goods as the buyer’s agent 
or bailee. This suffices to transfer possession of the goods for present purposes; that is 
to say, in the absence of a contrary intention, it entitles the seller to demand payment of 
the price, although in other cases it is a question of the greatest difficulty whether or not 
the bailor with an immediate right to take the goods can be said to have legal possession 
of them.
Sixthly, delivery of the goods to the buyer’s agent transfers possession to the buyer 
himself. Moreover, delivery to a carrier is prima facie deemed to be delivery to the buyer. 
Section 32(1) of the Act says:
Where, in pursuance of a contract of sale, the seller is authorised or required to send the goods 
to the buyer, delivery of the goods to a carrier (whether named by the buyer or not) for the 
purpose of transmission to the buyer is prima facie deemed to be a delivery of the goods to the 
buyer.33
But where the carrier is an agent or servant of the seller himself, delivery to him cannot 
constitute delivery to the buyer, for it is merely a delivery to the seller’s alter ego.34
32	 For example, Port of London Act 1968, s. 146(4).
33	 This provision does not apply where the buyer deals as consumer, or in Scotland, where there is a consumer 
contract – s. 32(4) added by SI 2002/3045, reg. 4.

The duty to supply the goods  
at the right time
The time of delivery
Section 10, after laying down in subs. (1) that the time of payment is prima facie not of 
the essence, goes on to state in subs. (2) that:
Whether any other stipulation as to time is of the essence of the contract or not depends on the 
terms of the contract.
The Act therefore declines to lay down any general rules; however, the courts have 
done so, and it is well settled that ‘In ordinary commercial contracts for the sale of 
goods the rule clearly is that time is prima facie of the essence with respect to delivery.’1 
If the time for delivery is fixed by the contract, then failure to deliver at that time will 
be a breach of condition or a material breach, which justifies the buyer refusing to take 
the goods. This rule applies to the time of delivery in the strict legal sense. As a result, 
it operates not only when the seller is obliged to dispatch the goods to the buyer but 
also when the buyer is bound to collect the goods from the seller. As we have previously 
seen, the House of Lords has affirmed that this rule applies in most commercial con-
tracts, not merely with respect to the time of delivery but also with regard to the time for 
the performance of many other contractual obligations, such as the giving of notices.2 
It also applies to many duties of the buyer; especially where they are interwoven with 
the seller’s duties, such as often occurs in cases of international trade.3 And although, 
strictly speaking, this chapter is concerned with the duties of the seller, some cases relat-
ing to the duties of the buyer as to the time of delivery are also dealt with here.
Where goods are to be shipped by the seller before a fixed date or within a stipulated 
period, it is also well established that time is of the essence, so that any deviation from 
the stipulations of the contract justifies the other party in treating the whole contract 
as at an end.4 If, as is commonly the case in commercial contracts, the seller is allowed 
a period within which to deliver or ship (e.g. delivery ‘during March or ‘shipment  
January/February’), the seller has the whole period in which to deliver or ship, as the 
case may be.5 He is not in default until the period has expired.

The duty to supply the goods at the right time 	 107
Where the contract provides that the seller will use his best endeavours to deliver the 
goods by a certain date but, despite his best endeavours, he is unable to do so, he must 
still deliver the goods within a reasonable time after that date.6
Where no time has been fixed by the contract, it is provided by s. 29(3) that:
Where under the contract of sale the seller is bound to send the goods to the buyer, but no time 
for sending them is fixed, the seller is bound to send them within a reasonable time.7
What constitutes a reasonable time will depend on the circumstances prevailing at the 
time of delivery; for example, bad weather preventing a ship from docking or an aircraft 
from landing at the designated airport. The question is, taking into account the circum-
stances at the time, was delivery effected in a reasonable time?8
Reference should also be made here to s. 29(5) which states that:
Demand or tender of delivery may be treated as ineffectual unless made at a reasonable hour; 
and what is a reasonable hour is a question of fact.9
Presumably, as a result, the position is the same where the seller is not bound to send 
the goods but is only bound to have them ready for collection.
Failure to deliver within a reasonable time (like failure to deliver within a specified 
time) may amount to a breach of condition by the seller.10
A contract may stipulate that delivery will be ‘as required’. This means that the buyer 
must give notice of his requirements to the seller, and the seller must then presumably be 
allowed sufficient time to make delivery (though that time may be very short in appro-
priate circumstances). This also means that the buyer must require delivery within a rea-
sonable time – he cannot in effect abandon the contract, or spin things out indefinitely 
by not requiring delivery.11 But it is perhaps not entirely clear whether failure to require 
delivery within a reasonable time is by itself enough to justify the seller in treating the 
contract as repudiated, or whether he in turn must give some appropriate notice or 
warning to that effect to the buyer.12
It is important to note that as the failure of the seller to deliver on time is a breach 
of condition, the buyer may reject the goods although he has suffered no damage as 
a result of the breach. This is illustrated in the well-known case of Bowes v Shand.13 
Here the sellers agreed to ship a quantity of Madras rice during the months of March 
and/or April. In fact, the bulk of the rice was shipped at the end of February and only 
about one-eighth was shipped during March. It was held by the House of Lords that 
the buyers were entitled to reject the goods, although it was conceded that there was

no difference between the rice actually shipped and any rice which might have been 
shipped in March.
The buyer may reject in such cases not because he is aggrieved by the early (or even 
late) shipment but because the market has fallen, and he now wants to escape from a 
bad bargain. This will not, however, necessarily be the case where the buyer complains 
of the failure to give notices on time or other similar breaches. Opinions may differ as 
to the desirability of retaining these rules. On the one hand, it may be objected that they 
permit an innocent party to escape from a bad bargain as a result of a highly techni-
cal breach of contract; on the other hand, there are serious problems about allowing a 
party to litigation to raise issues about the motives which have led the other party to act 
in a certain way. Examination of such motives often leads to very serious and difficult 
factual disputes. There are no current proposals for amendment of the law on this ques-
tion. The Law Commissions’ Final Report, Sale and Supply of Goods, which proposed 
modification of the right to reject where it would be ‘unreasonable’, and the consequent 
amendments effected by the Sale and Supply of Goods Act 1994 (which is discussed fur-
ther later)14 do not affect breaches of stipulations as to the time of delivery or other 
aspects of performance. These changes only affect breaches of the implied conditions as 
to quality and fitness in ss. 13 to 15 of the Act, and breaches of the seller’s duties as to 
the quantity under s. 30.
Waiver of conditions as to delivery time15
Although time is therefore prima facie of the essence with respect to delivery, buyers do 
not usually refuse to accept delivery merely because it is late. Actual acceptance of a late 
delivery is clearly binding on the buyer, so also even an agreement to accept late delivery 
will normally be binding whether made with or without consideration. It seems immate-
rial whether such waiver or estoppel is regarded as binding at common law16 or by virtue 
of s. 11(2) of the Act which states:
Where a contract of sale is subject to any condition to be fulfilled by the seller, the buyer may 
waive the condition . . .
McCardie J in Hartley v Hymans17 rested his decision on s. 11(2), while Denning LJ in 
Charles Rickards Ltd v Oppenhaim18 preferred to base it on the doctrine of promissory 
estoppel. In modern decisions, no clear distinction appears to be drawn between waiver 
and estoppel in such cases,19 even though differences can be found between the concep-
tual bases of the two doctrines.20
In commercial transactions, some of the most difficult questions that commonly arise 
are those concerning pleas of waiver and estoppel. The difficulty often arises from the

The duty to supply the goods at the right time 	 109
fact that when a breach is committed or threatened (e.g. where the seller informs the 
buyer that he cannot ship or deliver in time) it is rare that the buyer instantly breaks 
off negotiations and treats the contract as repudiated.21 More commonly, messages pass 
between the parties as they negotiate to try to resolve their difficulties; sometimes, too, a 
buyer may contact his sub-buyers because his own attitude to delay may be governed by 
their attitude. During this time, the seller may still be doing his best to arrange delivery 
as soon as possible. If, finally, negotiations break down, or more extensive delays ensue, 
it may be very difficult to say whether the buyer has waived the delay or any part of it. 
Although issues of waiver and estoppel can arise with regard to other matters besides 
stipulations as to time, these are so commonly the source of such questions that they can 
most conveniently be dealt with here.
The principles to be applied in these cases can be summarised as follows. First, there 
must be a promise or a clear and unequivocal representation that the innocent party will 
not insist on strict performance of the original contract according to its terms. This does 
not mean that the promise or waiver needs to be expressly made. As Lord Salmon said 
in Bremer v Vanden Avenne-Izegem,22 a case concerned with a notice which the sellers 
were entitled to give extending the date for delivery, but which was given late, ‘To make 
an unequivocal representation or waiver, it is not necessary for the buyers to say – “We 
hereby waive it”. It is quite enough if they behave or write in such a way that reasonable 
sellers would be led to believe that the buyers were waiving any defect there might be in 
the notice and were accepting it as effectively extending the date for delivery.’
A difficult and controversial question concerns the possibility of a waiver or estoppel 
arising if the party against whom waiver or estoppel is pleaded did not know all the facts 
at the relevant time. Prima facie, it still seems to be the general opinion that a party can-
not be taken to have waived rights which he did not know he had because (for instance) 
he was ignorant of the breach of contract in question.23 And similarly, a person cannot 
be held to have represented that he will not enforce his rights unless he knew what rights 
he had. At the same time, it is clear that there can sometimes be waiver or estoppel (or 
some legal equivalent) even without full knowledge of all the facts. In particular, it seems 
from the Court of Appeal’s decision in Procter & Gamble Philippine Manufacturing 
Corpn v Peter Cremer GmbH & Co24 that a representation (express or implied from 
words or conduct) may form the basis of a promissory estoppel if the representation 
strongly implies that the representor did have full knowledge of the facts. Furthermore, 
in principle, there seems no reason to doubt that a party could make it clear by his words 
or conduct that he does not care what the relevant facts are, but is prepared to condone 
a breach if there has been one.
21	 All this applies also to breaches by the buyer, e.g., of an obligation to open a letter of credit for payment. 
Here, too, breach will often justify immediate repudiation in law, but the seller is more likely to respond by 
demanding to know why the letter of credit has not yet been opened, and perhaps to allow some extension 
of time.

	110	 The duties of the seller
As with the cases dealt with in the previous chapter (such as the Fercometal case25) 
there is often a conflict here between two sets of principles. On the one hand, the mere 
fact that the buyer does not immediately complain of late delivery does not necessarily 
prevent him raising this later. A party is entitled, when sued, to set up any justification 
for his previous conduct, even though he did not give that justification at the time. It has 
also been stressed that waiver of one contractual term does not necessarily preclude the  
innocent party insisting on other related terms. Thus, where a seller was bound to deliver 
goods shipped in June and give a notice of appropriation by 10 July, a waiver of the lat-
ter requirement was held not to involve a waiver of the former. It was still possible for 
the seller to find a June shipment to supply to the buyer, and the buyer had not waived 
his right to a June shipment.26
On the other hand, a buyer who does not complain of the relevant breach at the time 
it is committed, but who at that stage appears to be willing to continue with the con-
tract, may be held bound by waiver or estoppel so as to preclude his raising that breach 
at a later date. The question always is whether the buyer has led the seller to believe that 
he does not intend to complain about the breach. So a buyer who rejects shipping doc-
uments tendered to him on the ground that they do not include a certificate of quality, 
or who rejects the goods on grounds of quality, but makes no complaint of the time of 
delivery, may find that an eventual attempt to raise the issue of delay in delivery is too 
late: he may be told that he has, in effect, waived the late delivery.
Parties who are victims of breach of contract sometimes attempt to have things both 
ways by ‘reserving their rights’, while at the same time showing willingness to continue 
with the contract despite the breach. Use of this or a similar formula does not in law rule 
out the possibility of waiver or estoppel if the other conditions of these doctrines are 
satisfied.27 The victim of a breach of condition has alternative remedies: he can either 
treat the contract as terminated or affirm it, but he must choose between the two. He 
cannot, by claiming to ‘reserve his rights’, demand the right to affirm the contract while 
keeping in reserve the possibility of treating it as terminated. At the same time the inno-
cent party can, if he is well advised, achieve the same result by first terminating the con-
tract, making it quite clear that he does so before entering into new negotiations to try 
to sort out the consequences of that termination, which may lead to the conclusion of 
a fresh contract on more advantageous terms. Unfortunately, businesspeople often think 
they can proceed straight to this second stage, by ‘reserving their rights’, only to find 
that the courts hold this to be ineffective for the reasons already given.
A reservation of rights may, however, be of some legal effect up to a point. For 
instance, the buyer may make it clear by some such formula that he is reserving his right 
to seek damages, while not insisting on treating the breach as a breach of condition jus-
tifying him in terminating the contract. The case law does not throw any doubts on this 
possibility.
Another important question which is still not totally resolved is whether a waiver 
must be acted upon to the detriment or prejudice of the party in breach before he can

The duty to supply the goods at the right time 	 111
rely upon it. In general, it seems that this is necessary: a bare waiver or representation 
which is instantly retracted before it is acted upon is unlikely to be held to be bind-
ing.28 In Société Italo-Belge v Palm & Vegetable Oils,29 sellers were required to make a 
declaration of shipment as soon as possible after the vessel sailed, but the declaration 
was in fact made a month later. But the buyers did not protest when they received it; 
indeed, they asked the sellers to pass the shipping documents straight to the sub-buyers. 
However, the sub-buyers rejected them because of the delay, and the buyers thereupon 
also claimed the right to reject them. The sellers argued that there had been an implied 
waiver and that they had acted upon it by delivering the documents to the sub-buyers. 
It was held by Robert Goff J that, although these contentions were sound, it was not 
inequitable for the buyer to be able to retract the waiver. Although it may not be strictly 
necessary to show that the representee has acted on the representation or waiver to his 
detriment, it is necessary to show that he has acted on it so that it would be inequitable 
to allow the other party to insist on the contractual delivery date, and here such a short 
time had elapsed since the documents had been delivered to the sub-buyers (only two 
days, in fact) that there was nothing inequitable in permitting the buyers to reject the 
documents. Moreover, the buyers here had good reason for retracting their waiver.
Extension of time for delivery
The seller in a contract with a fixed delivery date sometimes indicates that he will not be 
able to deliver by that date, and asks for an extension of time. The buyer may respond in 
one of two ways (assuming he does not simply reject the request). He may either grant 
an extension, fixing a new delivery date, in which case the new date simply replaces the 
old one, and if time was of the essence (as it usually is) this means that the contract 
continues to operate, with the delivery time being of the essence, but with the new time 
simply replacing the old.30
Alternatively, the buyer may grant the seller an extension of time without actually fix-
ing a new date or time. If this were an alteration of the original contract, supported by 
new consideration, the result would presumably be a contract to deliver within a reason-
able time in accordance with s. 29(3). But where a delivery date is merely waived before 
the goods are delivered, the buyer is entitled to give the seller reasonable notice that he 
will not accept delivery after a certain date. In Charles Rickards Ltd v Oppenhaim,31 the 
plaintiffs agreed to supply a Rolls-Royce chassis for the defendant, to be ready at the lat-
est on 20 March 1948. It was not ready on this day, but the defendant continued to press 
for delivery, thereby impliedly waiving the condition as to the delivery date. By 29 June, 
the defendant had lost patience and wrote to the plaintiffs informing them that he would 
not accept delivery after 25 July. In fact, the chassis was not ready until 18 October, 
and the defendant refused to accept it.The Court of Appeal held that the defendant was 
entitled to reject the chassis as he had given the plaintiffs reasonable notice that delivery 
must be made by a certain date. If this kind of waiver is an illustration of the principle

of promissory estoppel, then Charles Rickards Ltd v Oppenhaim can be regarded as an 
illustration of the principles discussed by the House of Lords in Tool Metal Manufac-
turing Co Ltd v Tungsten Electric Co Ltd32 as to the termination of the binding effect of 
a promissory estoppel by reasonable notice.33
Where it is clear that the party that has been permitted to perform their duty at a 
later time, could not in any event have performed the contract within a reasonable time, 
notice may not be necessary, and a mere intimation that the contract is regarded as can-
celled may be sufficient.34
Although s. 11(2) only refers to a waiver of a condition by the buyer, it is clear that the 
principles of waiver and promissory estoppel are general principles of contract law, and 
apply equally to buyer and seller. So, for example, a seller who leads a buyer to suppose 
that a letter of credit required by the contract will not be insisted on is not thereafter 
entitled to plead the failure to open such a letter of credit as an answer to a claim for 
non-delivery.35

The duty to supply goods  
in the right quantity
Delivery of the right quantity
The seller must deliver the correct quantity of goods. In the first place, s. 30(1) states:
Where the seller delivers to the buyer a quantity of goods less than he contracted to sell, the 
buyer may reject them, but if the buyer accepts the goods so delivered he must pay for them at 
the contract rate.
Moreover, the seller cannot excuse a short delivery on the ground that he will deliver the 
remainder in due course because s. 31(1) states that:
Unless otherwise agreed, the buyer of goods is not bound to accept delivery thereof by 
instalments.
There are no doubt circumstances (e.g. where the goods are to be shipped) in which it 
can be inferred from the contract quantity and the time allowed for shipment that the 
sellers are entitled to ship in more than one load, and therefore entitled to deliver in  
separate loads.1 But the general rule is that the seller must deliver in one load.
The operation of these subsections is illustrated by Behrend & Co Ltd v Produce 
Brokers Co Ltd,2 where the sellers agreed to sell a quantity of cotton seed ex the Port 
Inglis in London. The ship discharged a small part of the cargo in London, and then 
left for Hull where she discharged other goods. Fourteen days later, she returned to 
London and discharged the remainder of the cotton seed which was the subject of the 
sale. It was held that the buyers were entitled to reject the later delivery while retaining 
the earlier one.
A similar case, but one with a surprising twist to its tail, is Gill & Duffus SA v Berger 
& Co Inc,3 where sellers who had agreed to sell 500 tons of beans delivered them in two 
loads or shipments, the first of 445 tons and the second of 55 tons. The buyers rejected 
both loads on the ground that they did not conform to the contract description. This 
ground was held to be good as regards the second load, but bad as regards the first. It 
might therefore seem that the buyers were only entitled to reject the second load, but 
the Court of Appeal held that in the light of s. 30 of the Act, they must be held entitled 
to reject both loads because ‘a right of rejection limited to 55 tons was not a possible

	114	 The duties of the seller
conclusion in law’.4 It seems that even if the buyers had waived any right to object to 
the fact of separate deliveries, their rejection of the first delivery, which was originally 
wrongful, was retrospectively validated by their rightful rejection of the second. Once 
the buyers had rejected the second delivery, it followed that the sellers were guilty of a 
breach of their duty to deliver 500 tons. On the facts that was not an unreasonable result, 
but the implication – that the buyers could have rejected the first load after rejection of 
the second, even if they had originally accepted the first load – does seem somewhat 
strange. This decision was reversed by the House of Lords5 on grounds not affecting this 
point, namely that in fact the buyers did not have the right to reject the second load at 
all because their wrongful rejection of the first load was a complete repudiation of the 
contract, which had been accepted by the sellers, so no duty of delivery arose at all as 
regards the second load.6
Where delivery in separate instalments is permissible under the contract, the ques-
tion whether a shortfall in the quantity required permits the buyer to treat the whole 
contract as discharged is dealt with by s. 31(2) of the Act, which is discussed in more 
detail later.7 Here it is enough to say that that subsection is not as strict in its require-
ments as s. 30(1), and that a shortfall in quantity in one instalment does not justify the 
buyer in treating the whole contract as discharged unless it is sufficiently serious to 
go to the root of the contract as a whole.8 The result may seem curious at first sight. 
Leaving aside the effect of s. 30(2A), suppose a seller contracts to sell and deliver 
62 suits to the buyer, but he only delivers 61. If the suits were to be delivered in one 
load, the buyer could reject the whole lot (unless the absence of one suit is merely 
de minimis, which it probably is not). But if the suits are to be delivered in separate 
instalments, the buyer’s rights are regulated by s. 31(2) and on these facts it has been 
held that the shortfall of one suit was not sufficiently serious to justify the buyer in 
treating the contract as completely discharged.9 But the result is not as odd as it seems. 
Where the parties do expressly contemplate instalment deliveries, serious problems 
would arise if a shortfall on one instalment gave a right to reject previous instalments 
already accepted. So it is natural that such a right should be severely limited, and each 
instalment treated as a separate delivery.10
The counterpart of the duty not to deliver too little is the duty not to deliver too 
much, although it is less obvious why this should be so objectionable. At first sight, there 
seems no obvious reason why the buyer should not be required to accept that part which

10	 But if each instalment is a separate delivery under s. 30(1) it might seem that the buyer should at least be able to 
reject the whole of an instalment if there is any shortfall in it. In the Francesco of Jermyn Street case Mustill J 
did not consider whether the buyer was not entitled to reject the whole of the consignment which contained the 
short delivery. This would then have raised the further problem that the application of s. 31(2) might have had 
to be considered on the supposition that the seller was in breach in respect of one whole consignment, and not 
just one suit. See also below, p. 437.

	
	 	
The duty to supply goods in the right quantity 	 115
should have been delivered, whether or not he accepts the rest. But this is not the law, for 
s. 30(2) lays down that:
Where the seller delivers to the buyer a quantity of goods larger than he contracted to sell, the 
buyer may accept the goods included in the contract and reject the rest, or he may reject the 
whole.
Subsection (3) then says that if the buyer accepts all the goods delivered he must pay 
for them at the contract rate. This subsection does not actually say when the buyer can 
and when he cannot accept any excess delivered by the seller. It merely says that if the 
buyer does accept any excess he must pay for it at the contract rate. It may well have 
been assumed that the buyer can always accept any excess, and it certainly seems that 
he should usually be able to accept whatever is delivered, whether too much or too little, 
because the delivery would usually be treated as a counter-offer, which the buyer accepts 
by accepting the goods themselves.11
In their Working Paper on Sale and Supply of Goods, the Law Commissions raised the 
question whether it is right to treat an excess delivery as always amounting to an offer to 
sell the surplus. While this appears reasonable in the case where the seller delivers 1,004 
tons of grain instead of 1,000, it is rather different where the buyer orders one article, 
perhaps of a special nature, and two are mistakenly delivered.12 The answer to this seems 
to be that the buyer obviously cannot accept the surplus when he knows the seller does 
not mean to make an offer to sell those goods. That is the effect of the common law rules 
as to mistake which are preserved by s. 62(2) of the Act, and s. 30(3) must be read sub-
ject to those common law rules. In their Final Report the Law Commissions ultimately 
decided to leave s. 30(3) unamended and unrepealed.13 They concluded that while there 
are theoretical difficulties in deciding when a buyer can accept an excess delivered by the 
seller, the difficulties do not appear to be of serious practical importance, and in any 
event the mere repeal of s. 30(3) would not resolve those problems.
The de minimis principle
Prior to the amendments made to the Act by the Sale of Goods (Amendment) Act 1994, 
the law was very strict in its insistence on the correct quantity. Any shortfall or any 
excess, no matter how small, was a breach of the section and justified rejection of all the 
goods. There was, and presumably still is, however, a principle of very limited applica-
tion, known by the Latin phrase de minimis non curat lex (the law pays no attention to 
trifles) which could occasionally be invoked to excuse what would otherwise have been a 
technical breach. To illustrate the application of this principle in the present context, two 
cases, one on either side of the line, may be contrasted. In Wilensko Slaski Towarzystwo 
Drewno v Fenwick & Co Ltd,14 the sellers sold timber of specified measurements to 
the buyers. There were certain permitted, but strictly defined, variations from these

suits, was de minimis.

	116	 The duties of the seller
specifications. Slightly under 1 per cent of the timber failed to comply with the contract 
requirements. The buyers were held entitled to reject the goods. On the other hand, in 
Shipton Anderson & Co Ltd v Weil Bros & Co Ltd,15 the sellers contracted to sell to the 
buyers 4,500 tons of wheat or 10 per cent more or less. The sellers delivered 4,950 tons 
(the agreed upper limit) and 55 lb, but they did not claim payment for the 55 lb. It was 
held that the buyers were not entitled to reject the goods. The excess over the stipulated 
amount being a little over 1 lb in 100 tons, the case clearly called for the application of 
the maxim de minimis. If it had not been applied in this case, the rule would have lost all 
commercial importance.16
The maxim de minimis non curat lex is a legal principle of general application, but its 
applicability to any particular case seems to be a question of fact which depends, inter 
alia, on how far precise accuracy can be obtained, or whether there are limits of accu-
racy which are commercially reasonable.17 Given how the 1994 provisions restricted the 
right of rejection in non-consumer sales discussed in the next paragraph, the principle 
ought seldom to be applied to cases falling under the present provisions, for the effect of 
applying it is that there is no breach of warranty at all.18
In their Final Report on these matters, the Law Commissions recommended that the 
non-consumer buyer should no longer be entitled to reject the whole of the goods deliv-
ered where the shortfall or excess is so slight that it would be unreasonable to reject the 
whole. The buyer would remain entitled always to reject any excess and the consumer 
buyer would be unaffected by these changes. The position in respect of consumers is 
now dealt with by s. 25 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015, so that that the provisions 
of the 1994 Act19 now solely address commercial buyers. The 1994 Act inserts s. 30(2A) 
(as amended) which provides as follows:
(2A)	 (a)   Where the seller delivers a quantity of goods less than he contracted to sell, reject the 
goods under subsection (1) above, or
(b)	 where the seller delivers a quantity of goods larger than he contracted to sell, reject 
the whole under subsection (2) above,
if the shortfall or, as the case may be, excess is so slight that it would be unreasonable for 
him to do so.
(2B)	 It is for the seller to show that a shortfall or excess fell within subsection (2A) above.
This amendment brings the right of rejection for breach of the quantity provisions of 
the Act into line with the new provisions regarding the right to reject for breach of the 
implied terms as to quality and fitness, and it is discussed further in the chapter on the 
buyer’s remedies.20

The duty to supply goods in the right quantity 	 117
A minor point of some doubt is whether the buyer can accept only a part of what is 
delivered and reject the rest, except in the one case specifically covered by s. 30(2); that 
is, where an excess is delivered and the buyer proposes simply to keep what should have 
been delivered. He obviously cannot do this if the delivery conforms to the contract in 
respect of quantity and quality. But if too much or too little is delivered, it seems that the 
buyer may accept a distinct part of the goods, rejecting the rest.21
A slightly different position was dealt with by s. 30(4) (which was repealed with effect 
from 3 January 1995) which dealt with the situation where the seller delivered to the 
buyer the goods he contracted to sell mixed with goods of a different description. It 
was not clear that s. 30(4) was really needed. The first two subsections of s. 30 deal with 
the cases where the seller delivers too little and where he delivers too much. Subsection  
(4) clearly overlapped largely with these two subsections.
In the event of a breach of s. 30 by the seller, the buyer is entitled to recover a propor-
tionate part of what he has paid as on a total failure of consideration, notwithstanding 
that he may have accepted and retained a part of the goods.22
Relationship between the seller’s duties as to quality  
and duties as to quantity
The fact that the buyer may be entitled to reject the whole of the goods delivered in 
the circumstances dealt with by s. 30 means that, in substance, the seller in such cases 
is treated under English law as though he commits a breach of condition by delivering 
the wrong quantity. In this respect, the duties of the seller are parallel to those laid 
down as regards sales by description. Indeed, the whole of s. 30 is merely an applica-
tion of the duty to deliver goods conforming to the description imposed by s. 13, and 
it is one of the peculiarities of the drafting of the Act that s. 13 is dealt with under the 
heading ‘Conditions and Warranties’, while s. 30 is dealt with under ‘Performance of 
the Contract’.
For a start, the buyer’s prima facie right of rejection means that he can always convert 
a breach of the rules as to quality into a breach of the rules as to quantity. If the seller 
contracts to deliver 100 tons of wheat of a certain quality and 10 tons are not of that 
quality so that the buyer rejects them, then the seller will only have effectively delivered 
90 tons (and the question will now be whether the shortfall is so slight that it would be 
unreasonable for the buyer to reject). More generally though, the rules as to quality and 
the rules as to quantity are very similar in their effect, even if different in form. In par-
ticular, the close resemblance between the duties created by ss. 13 and 30 is brought out 
all the more when they are examined in detail. In both cases, until the right of rejection 
was modified by the 1994 Act, the slightest deviation from the terms of the contract was 
(in effect) a breach of condition entitling the buyer to reject the goods. If the seller deliv-
ered goods which failed, by the slightest margin, to conform to the contract description, 
or if he delivered a fraction too much or too little, the buyer might reject the whole. The

	118	 The duties of the seller
only qualification on this was that if the deviations were ‘microscopic’,23 the seller might 
be able to plead de minimis. But this principle was, and presumably will continue to be, 
applied as rarely in cases of quality as in cases of quantity. In fact, as suggested above, 
given the new provisions restricting the right of rejection in non-consumer sales, it ought 
not to be, for the effect of applying it is that there is no breach of warranty at all.24 So 
too the former s. 30(4) interrelated with s. 14(2) and (3) because, as will be seen later, 
the statutory implied terms under those subsections extend to all goods delivered in pur-
ported pursuance of the contract.25
The same close relationship between the duty to deliver the right quantity and the 
duty to deliver the right quality will be observed when we consider instalment con-
tracts.26 Here too, the buyer’s right to reject is the same whether the breach consists in 
short delivery or delivery of the wrong quality.
For these reasons, it is undesirable for the law to distinguish between breaches of 
ss. 13–15 and breaches of s. 30, and in general the law does not do so. So it seems 
clearly right that the limitation on the right to reject in (what was then) non-consumer 
sales introduced by the 1994 Act should apply equally to breaches of the implied terms 
as to quality and to breaches of s. 30.27

now somewhat suspect. Cf. Tradax International SA v Goldschmidt SA [1977] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 604. See also

of Goods, para. 6.20 with Working Paper No. 85, Consultative Memorandum No. 58, paras 4.59 and 6.28. 
The Law Commissions still maintained that there was no general reason for treating breaches of duty relating 
to quality and quantity in the same way. But in view of the new provisions inserted by the 1994 Act, little will 
remain of the distinction between quality and quantity except the shape of the law and the effect of the Unfair 
Contract Terms Act – see text above.

The duty to supply goods  
of the right quality
From caveat emptor to caveat venditor
In England, the implied terms as to quality and fitness in ss. 13–15 of the 1893 Act 
represented an important step in the abandonment of the original common law rule of 
caveat emptor – ‘let the buyer’ beware. The common law had itself largely modified the 
rigours of this rule by 1893, but in several important respects the Act went further than 
the courts ever did before it was passed. On the other hand, in Scotland the rule until 
1856 was that a fair price demanded a fair article, and the seller was therefore bound 
to provide goods of reasonably good quality.1 The Mercantile Law Amendment (Scot-
land) Act 1856 introduced the doctrine of caveat emptor, before itself being replaced by 
the 1893 Act. But weaknesses in the drafting of the original sections gradually became 
apparent, and there was also growing concern at the freedom permitted to sellers to 
contract out of their liabilities. The Supply of Goods (Implied Terms) Act 1973 was 
designed to meet these objections. This Act, largely based on the Law Commissions’ 
recommendations,2 remodelled ss. 13–15 of the original Act and also contained major 
new provisions restricting the right of a seller to contract out of the implied terms 
through use of exclusion clauses. The control of exclusion clauses in contracts was later 
taken over by the broader provisions of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977, which is 
dealt with in Chapter 10. In the present chapter, the discussion will concentrate on the 
implied terms themselves.3
Many further developments followed. The first of these developments was the passing 
of the consolidated Sale of Goods Act 1979, which incorporated the amendments made by 
the 1973 Act into the rest of the Sale of Goods Act with some trivial verbal alterations, but 
no changes of substance. The second development was that the statutory implied terms as 
to quality and fitness were gradually extended to other contracts for the supply of goods as 
well as contracts of sale. The 1973 Act itself did this for contracts of hire-purchase while 
the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982 did it for other contracts for the supply of

goods.4 These contracts are not further dealt with here although future authorities on the 
interpretation of these terms will mostly be relevant across the whole field.
In 1979 – before the new Sale of Goods Act was passed – the Law Commissions were 
invited by the Lord Chancellor to consider a number of further questions relating to 
the implied terms in contracts of sale of goods, and to certain related matters such as 
the remedies available for breach of these terms. After issuing a Working Paper in 1983, 
which contained many provisional proposals or suggestions for reform,5 the Law Com-
missions published their Final Report, Sale and Supply of Goods, in 1987.6 This Report 
contained yet further proposals for change and as these were accepted in principle by 
the government, legislative implementation might have been expected. Although there 
was considerable pressure for this from consumer organisations, many commentators 
were unhappy with some aspects of the proposals.7 The Consumer Guarantees Bill 
1990 would have implemented the Law Commissions’ proposals with certain changes. 
This Bill failed to become law, but the DTI (now BIS) issued a Consultation Document,8 
which took the Law Commissions’ recommendations as a starting point, subject to certain 
amendments. Finally, in 1994 a Bill was introduced which has now passed into law as the 
Sale and Supply of Goods Act 1994. The principal changes effected by this Act are to mod-
ify the quality warranties, to amend the rules on acceptance and rejection, and to extend 
the supply of Goods and Services Act 1982 to Scotland (so far as it applies to goods). 
The changes which are relevant to the quality warranties dealt with in this chapter are 
to do with the former ‘merchantable quality’ warranty, and are dealt with below.9 The 
most recent changes to the implied terms came from the EU’s 1999 Directive on Certain 
Aspects of the Sale of Consumer Goods and Associated Guarantees10 given effect by the 
Sale and Supply of Goods to Consumers Regulations 2002.
The latter amendments and others, however, have now been swept away as a result 
of consequential amendments made by the Consumer Rights Act 2015. The net effect 
of these amendments is that the implied terms no longer apply to consumer sales. The 
terms are effectively pared back. Additions made as a result of the 1999 EU Directive are 
removed, and the implied terms now only address sales made by a commercial seller to 
a non-consumer buyer. The provisions of the Consumer Rights Act which now replace 
the implied terms in the case of consumer sales are considered in detail in Chapter 16. 
The close similarities are immediately apparent and it is conceivable that at least some of 
the case law discussed in this chapter will continue to assist the courts when seeking to 
determine what the words of the implied terms mean in the context of a particular dispute.
The three primary terms laid down in the Act appear in s. 13, s. 14(2) and s. 14(3), and 
their combined effect is to give buyers a substantial degree of protection against the risk 
	4	 In a county court case the question was raised as to whether a tour operator’s liability in respect of food 
supplied was strict (as it is under s. 4 of the 1982 Act) or to exercise reasonable care and skill (s. 13 of the 
1982 Act). It was held the latter, but this is almost certainly incorrect. Liability should be strict in respect of 
the supply of goods – Martin v Thomson Tour Operators Current Law, August 1999 – see p. 10, n. 9 above.

The duty to supply goods of the right quality 	 121
of the goods proving to have defects of quality or fitness for purpose. Indeed, it is now 
unrealistic, even in a contract between two commercial parties, to treat the basic princi-
ple of the law as caveat emptor rather than caveat venditor – ‘let the seller beware’.
In one sense the three main implied terms in s. 13, s. 14(2) and s. 14(3), taken in that 
order, lay down a series of graduated duties upon the seller. First place, there is the 
implied term that where goods are sold by description the goods must correspond with 
their description. This applies in far wider circumstances than those in which the two 
other terms apply but, on the other hand, it does not afford a great deal of protection to 
the buyer, especially where the description of the goods is not a detailed one. Obviously, 
for example, a car may be described as a car, potatoes as potatoes, a reaping machine as 
a reaping machine, but in all cases the goods may be seriously defective.
The next implied term is that the goods must be of satisfactory quality. This does not 
apply in all the circumstances in which the first term applies but, on the other hand, it 
affords the buyer a greater degree of protection, because goods that correspond with 
their description may not be of satisfactory quality. Even this, however, may not suffice 
to protect the buyer, since goods may correspond with their description and may be of 
satisfactory quality, and yet they may still be unsuitable for the buyer’s purpose. Hence, 
in still more limited circumstances, the buyer may be able to rely on the third implied 
term, namely that the goods must be fit for the purpose for which they were sold.
Although the law was simplified by legislative changes made between 1973 and 1994, 
there remains a substantial and complex body of law to consider. The difficulties of 
exposition of this part of the law have unfortunately not been greatly reduced by the leg-
islation of 1973–94, though there has been some gain in simplification. As will be seen, 
the sections frequently overlap in practice, and the same words appear several times in 
different places. The effect of the reform of the English privity doctrine by the Contracts 
(Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 must also be considered. It is, therefore, impossible 
to deal with this topic section by section, and it is proposed to deal with it under the 
following nine heads:
1	 Express terms;
2	 Implied terms that the goods must correspond with their description;
3	 Implied terms that the goods are of satisfactory quality;
4	 Implied terms that the goods are fit for a particular purpose;
5	 Implied terms in sales by sample;
6	 Implied terms annexed by trade usage;
7	 Other implied terms;
8	 Mistake as to quality;
9	 Reform of the English privity doctrine.
Time for compliance
The goods must be compliant at the time property in them passes to the buyer. There is, 
however, at the outset a problem. As we will see,11 risk generally passes with the prop-
erty in the goods, so that if goods deteriorate after the property has passed to the buyer, 
11	 See p. 279.

	122	 The duties of the seller
usually the buyer will have no remedy, and vice versa if the goods deteriorate before 
that time. However, it is generally said that it is the duty of the seller to deliver goods 
of the right quality, which may occur after the property in them has passed to the buyer. 
One way of resolving this apparent contradiction may be as follows. Delivery can be 
actual or constructive. When property passes to the buyer before actual delivery, there 
is a constructive delivery of the goods, and that is the point at which the conformity 
of the goods with the contract must be judged. Thereafter, the seller is a bailee of the 
buyer, and the latter must take the risk of deterioration, subject to the seller’s duties as 
bailee having been complied with.12 Although the Act defines ‘delivery’ as the ‘voluntary 
transfer of possession from one person to the other’,13 this term seems to have reference 
to Part III of the Act, ‘Performance of the Contract’, which is clearly dealing with actual 
delivery. Given the criticisms made elsewhere in this book of constructive doctrines an 
alternative way of reconciling the contradiction is possible. The buyer clearly has the 
right to inspect the goods, and to reject them if they are defective, and this right will be 
exercised when the buyer takes physical delivery of the goods. If at that time they are 
defective, the buyer will have the right to reject them.14 In most cases it will be difficult 
for the seller to show, as a matter of evidence, that, at the time the property passed, the 
goods were conforming – even if sellers did, as a matter of course, focus their minds on 
the time of passing of the property.15 In f.o.b. export sales there will usually be evidence 
of the state of the goods at the time the risk passed,16 and thereafter goods are at the 
buyer’s risk, and should be insured by him. But in other sales, there will usually be no 
evidence as to the state of the goods at the time the property passed.
1 Express terms
Express terms relating to the description, quality and fitness of goods sold are, of 
course, relatively common in commercial transactions. No doubt they are less common 
in sales of low value, high volume and relatively simple goods, and goods sold through 
advertisements placed in newspapers or other media. There is no doubt that, apart from 
the de minimis rule, it is still the law that any deviation from an express term, however 
trifling, is a breach of contract for which the buyer is entitled to some remedy.17 The 
modern cases which have inaugurated something of a legal revolution in England by 
recognition of the concept of an innominate term, neither condition nor warranty,18 have 
been concerned solely with the nature of the buyer’s remedy, and not with the question 
whether he has any remedy at all. As we have seen, the position at present is that, in the 
12	 As to the duty of a bailee, see Palmer on Bailments (2nd edn, 1991, Sweet & Maxwell). Presumably, the 
seller’s duties will be those of a gratuitous bailee – see op. cit. In Scots law, it is difficult to see how the seller 
in such circumstances can be treated as a depositary, but it is clear that the buyer does not have the risk of 
damage or deterioration of the goods attributable to the seller’s fault (Pommer v Mowat (1906) 14 SLT 373; 
Knight v Wilson 1949 SLT (Sh Ct) 26), nor does the buyer being owner of the goods preclude a right of 
rejection for defects (Kinnear v Brodie (1901) 3F 540).

The duty to supply goods of the right quality 	 123
absence of express provision as to the remedy for breach, an express term of the contract 
will often be treated as an innominate term, rather than a condition, unless the case is 
one where certainty is the paramount consideration. If it is an innominate term, breach 
of that term will not necessarily entitle the buyer to reject the goods and repudiate the 
contract. Where the nature and consequences of the breach are not of such gravity as 
to justify repudiation of the whole contract, he will be compelled to accept the goods. 
But there is no doubt of his right to damages.19 An interesting case where the court held 
that a stipulation of the contract was an absolute requirement is Hazlewood Grocery 
Ltd v Lion Foods Ltd.20 The claimant in that case, a foodstuffs manufacturer, purchased 
chili powder from the defendants. An express term of the contract required the powder 
to be free from ‘foreign and extraneous matter’, clearly an important matter in the cir-
cumstances. The powder supplied was contaminated with a small amount of industrial 
dye. The Food Standards Agency accordingly required foodstuffs manufactured using 
the powder to be recalled. The court held that the express term of the contract imposed 
an absolute obligation.21 It was also held that the chili was not of satisfactory quality as 
required by s. 14(2)22 or fit for its purpose as required by s. 14(3).23
On the other hand, the terms as to quality and fitness implied by the Act are all con-
ditions in English law,24 breach of which under the Act, until it was modified by the 1994 
Act, justified rejection of the goods, no matter how trifling. The 1994 Act has modified 
the right of rejection, but it does not eliminate the distinction between conditions and 
warranties and innominate terms, so it must be expected that there will continue to be 
occasional difficulties over the need to distinguish between express and implied terms. 
The legal rules applicable to the two classes of terms will remain different. Although the 
new restrictions on the buyer’s right to reject for slight defects will bring the statutory 
implied terms closer to innominate express terms, it will not equate the two types of 
term. In Scotland, however, where there is no distinction between conditions and war-
ranties, breach of the implied terms must be material before rejection is justified.
2 Implied terms that the goods must correspond  
with their description
Sections 13(1) and (2) are as follows:
(1)	 Where there is a contract for the sale of goods by description, there is an implied term that 
the goods correspond with the description.
(2)	 If the sale is by sample, as well as by description, it is not sufficient that the bulk of 
the goods corresponds with the sample if the goods do not also correspond with the 
description.
19	 In Scotland, see Webster & Co v Cramond Iron Co (1875) 2 R 752, at 754 per LP Inglis: ‘It is impossible to 
say that a contract can be broken even in respect of time without the party being entitled to damages.’ This 
is, however, subject to the important qualification that the buyer must have suffered loss: Wilkie v Brown

	124	 The duties of the seller
The relationship between s. 13 and the common law distinction 
between representations and contractual terms
The first question to be examined here is the effect of s. 13 on the traditional common 
law distinction between mere representations on the one hand and terms of the contract 
on the other hand.25 At first blush it might seem that s. 13 does away with this distinction 
in the case of a sale by description since the section states that ‘there is an implied term 
that the goods shall correspond with the description’. If the section applied only to those 
parts of the description which amounted to contractual terms in any event, it would 
seem to be performing the somewhat odd (and redundant) function of declaring that it is 
an implied term that the seller must comply with express terms of the contract.
However, despite this oddity, the section does not seem, in legal theory at all events, 
to obliterate the distinction between mere representations and contractual terms. For 
instance, in T & J Harrison v Knowles and Foster,26 the sellers sold two ships to the 
buyers, each of which had been stated in particulars supplied to the buyers to have a 
deadweight capacity of 460 tons, but no reference was made to this in the actual memo-
randum of sale. In fact, the capacity of each ship was only 360 tons. In one sense these 
ships had been sold by description and the description certainly referred to their capac-
ity. But the Court of Appeal held that the statements about the capacity were merely 
representations.27 So also in a very careful judgment in the New Zealand case of Taylor 
v Combined Buyers Ltd28 – which seems to be the only case in which this question has 
been explicitly and fully considered – Salmond J held that the section does not affect the 
traditional distinction between mere representations and terms of the contract. Simi-
larly, in the well-known case of Oscar Chess Ltd v Williams,29 where the seller sold a car 
which he described as a ‘1948 Morris’, contrary to the facts, it does not seem to have 
occurred to anybody that the statement could have been treated as part of the descrip-
tion of the car and an action brought under s. 13, unless the buyer could first establish 
that the statement was a term of the contract and not a mere representation. It could, 
no doubt, be argued that the sale in this case was not a sale by description but a sale of 
a specific chattel, but it would certainly be strange if this distinction were to lead to the 
same statement being held a representation in one case and a condition in another. In 
the case of Harlingdon & Leinster Enterprises Ltd v Christopher Hull Fine Art Ltd,30 
it was held that the sale of a painting as a ‘Gabriele Münter’ (a German expression-
ist painter) was not a sale by description. In this case, it was held that the fact that a 
description was applied to goods either in the negotiations leading up to a contract, or 
in the contract itself, did not necessarily make it a sale by description for the purposes 
of s. 13(1). For the sale to be by description, the description had to be influential in the 
sale so as to become an essential term or condition of the contract. It was possible for a 
description to become a term of the contract although it was not relied on, but the court

The duty to supply goods of the right quality 	 125
had to be able to impute to the parties a common intention that it should be a term of 
the contract before the sale could be said to be ‘by description’, and in determining what 
the intention of the parties was, the absence of reliance on the part of the buyer was a 
very relevant factor. The plaintiff dealers were specialists in German expressionist paint-
ings, and the defendant dealers were not, and the plaintiffs had inspected the painting. 
Nourse LJ observed:
For all practical purposes, I would say that there cannot be a contract for the sale of goods by 
description where it is not within the reasonable contemplation of the parties that the buyer is 
relying on the description.31
On the other hand, in Beale v Taylor,32 the Court of Appeal appears to have come 
very close to disregarding the distinction between representations and contractual terms 
by giving a wide application to s. 13 of the Act. In this case, the defendant advertised his 
car for sale as a ‘Herald, convertible, white, 1961’ and it was bought by the plaintiff after 
examination. In fact, the car was made of two parts which had been welded together, 
only one of which was from a 1961 model. Although the facts bore some resemblance 
to those in T & J Harrison v Knowles and Foster (which was not cited), the Court of 
Appeal here held that the words ‘1961 Herald’ were part of the contractual description. 
If this case illustrates the modern trend, it seems to suggest that, whatever the legal the-
ory of the matter may be, in practice s. 13 makes it easier for a buyer to argue that a 
descriptive statement by a seller is a contractual term and not a mere representation. 
The decision may well reflect a modern trend to hold that statements about the goods by 
sellers are to be treated as contractual terms rather than mere representations, particu-
larly where the buyer was reasonable in relying on the statement.33 After all, the seller in 
Beale v Taylor presumably obtained a price well above the fair value of the vehicle. In 
the Oscar Chess case, by way of contrast, the decisive fact may have been that the buyer, 
a car dealer, was not reasonable – or had no right – to rely on what the seller, a private 
person, had said.34
However, although this question remains tantalisingly undiscussed in the cases, it seems 
reasonably clear from some House of Lords decisions, and the case of Harlingdon & 
Leinster Enterprises Ltd v Christopher Hull Fine Art Ltd,35 that s. 13 of the Act does 
not automatically convert any or all descriptive words into conditions, or even terms. 
Some descriptive words may be inserted in the contract without having any legal force 
at all. For example, in the Reardon Smith Lines case36 where the shipbuilders contracted 
to build a vessel to a certain specification at Yard No. 354 at Osaka Zosen, and the ship 
was in fact built at another yard, it was held that these words had no legal significance at 
31	 At p. 574.

33	 See Fordy v Harwood, 30 March 1999 (unreported).
34	 In previous editions it was suggested that this was contrary to the orthodox view which holds that a statement 
is a contractual term if this is the intention of the parties, and that Australian cases seem to follow this 
orthodoxy more frequently than English ones – see, e.g., J J Savage & Sons v Blakeney (1970) 119 CLR 435. 
This may be true of Australian cases, but so far as the English courts are concerned, Oscar Chess seems to be in 
line with orthodox thinking – see Harlingdon & Leinster Enterprises Ltd v Christopher Hull Fine Art Ltd, n. 
30 above.

	126	 The duties of the seller
all. They were of no substantial importance to the parties, who were not concerned with 
where the ship was built (though it might of course have been different if that particular 
yard had a particular reputation among shipowners and shipbuilders); the important 
descriptive words were in the specification, and that specification had to be complied 
with. Since the words in this case described the yard where the ship was to be built and 
there was no suggestion that the shipbuilders had not intended to build the ship there, 
these words could not even have amounted to a misrepresentation. In other cases, how-
ever, descriptive words which fail to amount to an implied condition under s. 13 may 
simply be a misrepresentation, and may give the representee the usual remedies available 
for a misrepresentation.
In the Reardon Smith Lines case (which did not involve a contract of sale)37 and again 
in Ashington Piggeries v Christopher Hill Ltd (which did),38 the House of Lords dis-
cussed another question, closely related to the one above, namely whether compliance 
of the goods with all parts of a description is required by the implied term in s. 13, or 
whether parts of the description can be treated as giving rise to liability by way of a 
warranty or innominate term. In both cases, it seems to have been taken for granted that 
not all descriptive words automatically fall within s. 13; the discussion in the two cases 
centred round the proper test for determining which parts of the descriptive words fall 
within s. 13 and which do not. As regards any other words, it was stated explicitly (e.g. 
by Lord Diplock)39 that these might still give rise to a warranty (or, it can be added, an 
innominate or intermediate term). It thus seems established that s. 13 does not override 
the traditional distinctions which need to be drawn between (a) descriptive words which 
are words of contractual obligation and those which are mere representations, or even 
without any legal effect, and also between (b) descriptive words which are words giving 
rise to liability by way of condition, on the one hand, or by way of warranty or innomi-
nate or intermediate term, on the other.40
The next question concerns the test by which it can be decided what words of descrip-
tion do fall within s. 13 and thereby give rise to liability if the description is not complied 
with. In this connection, some of the case law has adopted a tendency to overlook the 
above distinctions and treat all descriptive words as though they must create liability 
under s. 13. For example, in Arcos Ltd v E A Ronaasen & Son,41 the buyers agreed to buy 
a quantity of staves which they required, as the sellers knew, for making cement barrels. 
The contract stated that the staves were to be half an inch thick. In fact, only about 
5 per cent conformed to this requirement, but a large proportion was over half an inch, 
but not more than 9/10 of an inch; some were larger than this but less than 5/8 inch and a 
very small proportion were larger than that. It was found as a fact that the goods ‘were 
commercially within and merchantable under the contract specification’, and also that

40	 It is surprising that in the Reardon Smith Lines case the leading speech of Lord Wilberforce makes 
no reference to the Ashington Piggeries case (which, indeed, seems not to have been cited, somewhat 
astonishingly) and his words are a trifle hesitant on this last point. But if his opinion is taken together with 
the speeches in the Ashington Piggeries case, it does seem clear that the proposition stated in the text has the 
support of the House of Lords.

The duty to supply goods of the right quality 	 127
they were reasonably fit for the purpose for which they were sold. Despite these findings, 
it was held by the House of Lords that the buyers were entitled to reject the goods for 
breach of s. 13.42 Lord Atkin said:43
It was contended that in all commercial contracts the question was whether there was a  
‘substantial’ compliance with the contract: there must always be some margin: and it is for the 
tribunal of fact to determine whether the margin is exceeded or not. I cannot agree. If the writ-
ten contract specifies conditions of weight, measurement and the like, those conditions must 
be complied with. A ton does not mean about a ton, or a yard about a yard. Still less when you 
descend to minute measurements does 1/2 inch mean about 1/2 inch. If the seller wants a margin 
he must and in my experience does stipulate for it . . .
No doubt there may be microscopic deviations which business men and therefore lawyers 
will ignore . . . But apart from this consideration the right view is that the conditions of the 
contract must be strictly performed. If a condition is not performed the buyer has a right to 
reject.44
Perhaps the most extreme case was Re Moore & Co Ltd and Landauer & Co Ltd45 
where buyers agreed to buy 3,000 tins of Australian canned fruit packed in cases of 30 tins. 
When the goods were delivered it was found that about half the cases contained only 24 
tins, although the correct total quantity was delivered altogether. The arbitrator found 
that there was no difference in value between tins packed 30 to a case and those packed 
24 to a case, but despite this finding it was held by the Court of Appeal that the buyers 
were entitled to reject the whole consignment on the ground that there had been a breach 
of s. 13.46 In the Reardon Smith Lines case, Lord Wilberforce (speaking for a majority 
of the House of Lords) expressed serious doubts as to the correctness of this decision, 
which he found ‘excessively technical’.47
In the Ashington Piggeries case, and again in the Reardon Smith Lines case, the House 
of Lords seems to have accepted that the only descriptive words which are to be treated 
as the subject of s. 13 are words which identify the subject-matter of the contract. For 
example, in the Ashington Piggeries case, Lord Diplock said:48
The ‘description’ by which unascertained goods are sold is, in my view, confined to those words 
in the contract which were intended by the parties to identify the kind of goods which were to 
be supplied. It is open to the parties to use a description as broad or as narrow as they choose. 
But ultimately the test is whether the buyer could fairly and reasonably refuse to accept the 
physical goods proffered to him on the ground that their failure to correspond with what was 
said about them makes them goods of a different kind from those he had agreed to buy. The key 
to s. 13 is identification.
The concept of words of identification is, however, more troublesome than seems to be 
implied. In the Reardon Smith Lines case, it was argued for the appellants that the words

in the contract requiring the ship to be built at the particular yard specified were words 
of identification because it was only with the aid of these words that it was possible to 
identify the vessel being built at a particular yard with the vessel contemplated under 
the contract. This argument was rejected by the House of Lords, and Lord Wilberforce 
pointed out that there are two different meanings to the idea of words of ‘identity’ or 
‘identification’. It is only words whose purpose is to state or identify an essential part 
of the description of the goods which are words of identity in this special sense, and 
so attract the implied condition in s. 13. Words which merely identify the goods in the 
sense of pointing out where they can be found are not words of identity in this spe-
cial sense. Lord Wilberforce also expressed dissatisfaction, as already noted, with the 
excessive technicality of some of the cases under s. 13 such as Re Moore and Co Ltd 
and Landauer,49 and indicated that it would be better if s. 13 were confined to descrip-
tive words which constitute a ‘substantial ingredient of the “identity” of the thing sold’, 
other words being left to give rise to liability for breach of warranty or of an intermedi-
ate or innominate term. He added, however, that a different view might still be taken of 
contracts for the sale of unascertained future goods (e.g. commodities – and he probably 
had Arcos v E A Ronaasen particularly in mind) where each detail of the description 
must be assumed to be vital.
These words of Lord Wilberforce concerning the concept of words of identifica-
tion are very important. Not only do they rule out the application of s. 13 to words 
which merely point out the goods being sold while not actually constituting a sub-
stantial ingredient of the goods, but they also help to explain why, even on a sale 
of specific goods, it is possible to hold that the sale is a sale by description and the 
descriptive words do fall within s. 13. As will be seen later, it is well established that 
prima facie the sale of manufactured goods should be treated as a sale by descrip-
tion if the goods are sold not as specific things, but as things answering a general 
description. For example, if a buyer purchases a consignment of pure cotton shirts 
from a seller, and the shirts are labelled ‘pure cotton’, it seems clear that this is a sale 
by description, and that the words on the label are part of the contractual descrip-
tion. If the shirts are not pure cotton, there will be a clear breach of s. 13 and the 
buyer will be entitled to reject the goods.50 Yet it will be seen that in such a case the 
words cannot be said to be words of identification in the sense that they are needed 
to point out which are the goods that are the subject-matter of the contract. In a sale 
of specific goods like this, there will be no need to identify the goods in that sense: 
the identity of the goods is clear. But the words on the label are still plainly enough 
words of identification in the other sense mentioned by Lord Wilberforce – they iden-
tify a substantial ingredient of the goods. They are, in short, words which identify, 
not which goods are being sold, but what the goods actually are (not just any suit – a 
wool suit). The actual decision in Beale v Taylor51 could also be supported in this 
manner, assuming that the words in that case were indeed contractual and not just 
representational. The words in the advertisement, ‘1961 Herald’, were not needed to

that the words could be held to be mere representations, and not terms at all.

identify which car was the subject of the sale, but they were identifying what the car 
was (a 1961 Herald, not just any Herald).
There are, however, a few cases, pre-dating the Ashington Piggeries case and the Rear-
don Smith Lines case, in which s. 13 has been applied to words which, even if they could 
be called words of description at all, do not appear to be words which identify a sub-
stantial (or indeed any) ingredient of the goods sold. For example, it has been held that 
words about the way in which the goods are packed, or even marked, may be words of 
description under s. 13 of the Act.52 So also, it has been held that words describing where 
the goods are situated (‘Afloat per SS Morton Bay, due London approximately June 8th’) 
are descriptive words within the protection of s. 13.53 Although this last case was cited 
without disapproval by Lord Guest in Ashington Piggeries, it is hard to reconcile it with 
Lord Wilberforce’s more subtle analysis of the concept of words of identification in 
Reardon Smith Lines. The authority of decisions of this character is today somewhat 
doubtful.
The upshot of all this is of some complexity. It seems that the position can be summa-
rised as follows:
1	 Descriptive words must first be analysed to see whether they are contractual, or 
merely amount to representations. If they are misrepresentations only, then the nor-
mal common law and equitable rules apply, as modified by the Misrepresentation Act 
1967 and the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1985, s. 10.
2	 If the words are held to be contractual, it must next be seen whether there is an express 
term requiring compliance with the words of description. In England and Wales, such 
a term may be a condition or a warranty, but is most likely to be an innominate term, 
as in the Cehave case. The buyer’s remedies for breach of such a term depend on the 
nature and consequences of the breach. In Scotland, likewise, it will be a question of 
the materiality of the breach.
3	 If there is nothing amounting to an express term, then the next stage is to see whether 
the description relates to unascertained future goods like commodities. In this event 
(as in the Arcos case), the term is a condition in English law, and strict compliance is 
required, though a buyer’s right to reject is now modified by s. 15A, inserted by the 
1994 Act. In Scots law, however, materiality of breach remains the touchstone.
4	 If the contract is of a different character, it must next be inquired whether any item 
in the description of the goods amounts to a ‘substantial ingredient’ in the identity of 
the thing sold. If it does, compliance with the item will again be a condition in Eng-
lish law, but a matter of the materiality of the breach in Scots law.
5	 In any other case, the requirement of compliance with descriptive words is not a con-
dition, but a bare warranty or (more probably) an intermediate or innominate term 
in English law; while Scots law will still operate on the basis of whether or not the 
breach is material.
English law as opposed to Scottish law may seem complicated, but both systems do at 
least avoid putting the court into a straitjacket. The courts will in effect be able to arrive

	130	 The duties of the seller
at whatever decision seems appropriate in the circumstances. It will be noticed that 
s. 13 itself seems to have been largely forgotten in this discussion. It is almost impossible 
to reconcile the law as stated by Lord Wilberforce in the Reardon Smith Lines case with 
the precise words of the Act. It appears thus that s. 13 needs revision, if not outright 
repeal. Indeed, it is not clear that s. 13 actually does anything at all, since all it seems to 
say, as now interpreted, is that where the seller uses words of description which would 
otherwise amount to a condition, then it is an implied condition that the goods should 
comply with that description. This hardly seems worth saying, although, of course, in a 
true codification propositions may be stated which are not designed in any sense to alter 
the law. It is perhaps unfortunate that s. 13 appears to have been outside the terms of 
reference of the Law Commissions’ inquiry which led to the 1994 Act.
Prior to the passing of the 1973 Act, it was important to consider the relation between 
s. 13 and the doctrine of the fundamental term or fundamental breach. This question 
is now of very little importance because the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 greatly 
restricts the power of a seller to contract out of his liability under s. 13 and the doc-
trine of the fundamental term and fundamental breach has essentially been killed off 
by Photo Production Ltd v Securicor Transport Ltd.54 Under ss. 6 and 20 of that Act, 
contracting out of s. 13 is only permissible to the extent that it is ‘fair and reasonable’. 
For example, the breach in Arcos Ltd v E A Ronaasen & Son55 would seem on the face of 
it to have been one of trivial significance, and if the contract in that case had contained 
an exemption clause, it would have been most unreasonable to hold the seller liable for 
the breaches which occurred. Rules of construction, formerly widely applied to limit the 
operation of exemption clauses, will now be of much less importance, though doubt-
less they may still be used.56 For instance, in Robert A Munro & Co Ltd v Meyer,57 the 
defendant agreed to buy goods ‘with all faults’, but it was nonetheless held by Wright J 
that this clause did not shut out the overriding requirement that the goods should answer 
to their description, but only served to protect the sellers from the obligation to supply 
merchantable goods.58 But insofar as the requirements of satisfactory (or formerly mer-
chantable59) quality overlap with those regarding the description of the goods, it seems 
that a clause which validly excludes the condition that goods be of satisfactory quality 
(merchantable) must also protect against non-conformity with description.60
Meaning of ‘sale by description’
The next question concerns the meaning of the phrase ‘sale by description’. It has been 
held that this phrase ‘must apply to all cases where the purchaser has not seen the goods

The duty to supply goods of the right quality 	 131
but is relying on the description alone’.61 So it follows that a sale must be by description 
if it is of future or unascertained goods.62 But, in addition, the term applies in many 
cases even where the buyer has seen the goods. Early doubts as to whether an ordinary 
sale in a shop could be a sale by description were soon set at rest.63 To quote from Lord 
Wright in Grant v Australian Knitting Mills Ltd:
It may also be pointed out that there is a sale by description even though the buyer is buying 
something displayed before him on the counter: a thing is sold by description, though it is 
specific, so long as it is sold not merely as the specific thing, but as a thing corresponding to a 
description, e.g. woollen undergarments, a hot-water bottle, a second-hand reaping machine, 
to select a few obvious illustrations.64
One could add to this list to items on a restaurant menu,65 though this is perhaps a less 
obvious illustration. Moreover, it has now been made clear by s. 13(3) that the term ‘sale 
by description’ is wide enough to cover a sale even where the goods have been exposed 
for sale and selected by the buyer, as in a supermarket or department store:
A sale of goods is not prevented from being a sale by description by reason only that, the goods 
being exposed for sale or hire, are selected by the buyer.
Even prior to the 1973 Act amendments it had been held that a sale could be by 
description though the buyer had examined the goods with care,66 or even where he 
had himself selected them from stock offered to him by the seller.67 But a sale is not by 
description where the buyer makes it clear that he is buying a particular thing because 
of its unique qualities, and that no other will do, or where there is absolutely no reliance 
by the buyer on the description.68 In fact, it is probably true to say that the only case of 
a sale not being by description occurs where the buyer makes it clear that he is buying a 
particular thing because of its unique qualities, and that no other will do.69
For this reason, the sale of a manufactured item will nearly always be a sale by descrip-
tion (except where it is second-hand) because articles made to an identical design are not 
generally bought as unique goods but as goods corresponding to that design. So it has 
even been held in Australia that the sale of an ordinary pair of ‘walking shoes’ was a sale 
by description, although the buyer had tried on and examined the shoes and might well 
have been thought to be buying the particular pair as specific goods.70 As we have seen, 
even the purchase of a used car which was fully examined by the buyer was held in Beale v  
Taylor71 to be a sale by description because the buyer had relied in part on a newspaper 
advertisement issued by the seller.

	132	 The duties of the seller
These cases suggest that the real question at issue in deciding whether the sale should 
be classified as a sale by description is whether, on the true construction of the contract, 
the buyer has agreed to buy a specific item exactly as it is to the exclusion of all liability 
on the part of the seller. For example, the buyer may examine a second-hand car and the 
seller may offer it for sale in terms which amount to saying: ‘There is the car; there is my 
offer; I guarantee nothing; take it or leave it.’ In this event it is thought the sale would be 
held to be a sale of a specific thing and not a sale by description.
One of the consequences of the 1893 Act was that if the sale was held to be a sale 
by description there would often be an implied condition under s. 14 that the goods 
were merchantable. This consequence of holding a sale to be by description was so 
important that it seems that the courts in practice tended to interpret s. 13 with half 
an eye to s. 14. In other words, if the court thought that on the true construction of the 
contract the seller should be held to warrant the merchantability of the goods, it would 
tend to hold the sale to be a sale by description, but after the 1973 Act the condition of 
merchantability was not limited to sales by description, and in previous editions it was 
suggested that this might possibly lead to a tendency to a narrower construction of s. 13 
in the future. Although the merchantable quality warranty has been replaced by the 1994 
Act, this observation still remains apposite in relation to the new section.
The application of s. 13
It is to be noted that s. 13 (unlike s. 14) applies even though the goods are not sold by a 
person who sells ‘in the course of a business’. Thus in Varley v Whipp,72 the defendant 
agreed to buy from the plaintiff a second-hand reaping machine, which was stated to 
have been new the previous year and hardly used at all. This was a gross misdescription, 
and the defendant declined to accept it or pay for it. The defendant could not rely on 
s. 14 (which imposes requirements as to quality and fitness for purpose) because the 
plaintiff was not a dealer in agricultural machinery, but as the goods did not correspond 
with the description it was held that there was a breach of s. 13. (Changes made by later 
legislation are immaterial to this point.)
The relationship between the description and the quality  
or fitness of the goods
As we shall see later, s. 14 deals with implied conditions as to the quality and fitness of 
the goods for a particular purpose. Section 13 does not on the face of it deal with quality 
or fitness for purpose. As we have seen from Arcos Ltd v E A Ronaasen & Son,73 it is 
quite possible for goods to be of satisfactory (formerly merchantable) quality and fit for 
their purpose and yet not correspond with their description.
Conversely, if the goods do correspond with their description the fact that they are 
unsatisfactory or not fit for the purpose for which they are sold will not enable the buyer 
to plead a breach of s. 13. In this event he will frequently be able to rely on s. 14(2) or (3),

The duty to supply goods of the right quality 	 133
but there are some circumstances in which a buyer may wish to use s. 13 rather than s. 14 
even though his complaint may in a broad sense be said to be one of quality. First, as 
seen above, s. 13 applies to a sale by a private seller while s. 14 only applies to a seller 
who sells in the course of a business. So a person who buys from a non-business seller 
can only complain about quality if he can bring his case under s. 13. This explains a 
case like Beale v Taylor74 where the buyer of the car obtained damages for breach of the 
condition implied by s. 13 – the car was wrongly described as a 1961 Herald. If the buyer 
had been buying from a business seller, he would probably have had a clear case for 
damages under s. 14 on the ground that the vehicle was not of merchantable quality (the 
relevant quality warranty at the time).
But secondly, the buyer may wish to rely on s. 13 because the goods are in fact of sat-
isfactory quality in a general sense, but still do not amount to the goods he thought he 
was buying. In the hypothetical example given earlier, a person who buys a suit described 
as ‘pure wool’ may very well want to return it if he discovers it is not pure wool, even 
though it may be perfectly satisfactory, and of good quality. But he can only do that 
under s. 13 because there would be no breach of s. 14 on these facts.
A third type of case in which a buyer might wish to rely upon s. 13, even though his 
complaint is in a broad sense about quality, occurs where the contract contains a clause 
excluding liability for matters of quality, but not for matters of description – something 
which could still happen despite the Unfair Contract Terms Act.
Particular problems often arise where goods are described in general terms, but are 
in some way adulterated or contaminated in a way that the goods themselves are not 
greatly changed but their utility is affected. The point is illustrated by the decision of the 
House of Lords in Ashington Piggeries Ltd v Christopher Hill Ltd75 where herring meal 
contaminated with a substance which made it unsuitable for feeding to mink was sold to 
the buyers for use as mink food. It was held that there was no breach of s. 13 because the 
goods were still properly described as ‘herring meal’,76 and it was pointed out that not 
every statement about the quality or fitness of the goods can be treated as a part of the 
‘description’.
On the other hand, in Pinnock Bros v Lewis and Peat Ltd77 the contract was for the 
sale of copra cake but the goods delivered were in fact a mixture of copra cake and cas-
tor beans; it was held that the goods did not correspond with their description. As Lord 
Wilberforce pointed out in Ashington Piggeries, the question of whether a substance 
which has added to it a contaminant or unwanted material, remains in substance what 
it always was, though with the addition or contamination, or whether it really becomes 
a different substance altogether, ‘may, if pressed to analysis, be a question of an Aristo-
telian character’. But he went on to say that the Sale of Goods Act was not intended to 
provoke metaphysical discussions as to the nature of what was delivered as compared 
with what was sold. The question of whether the goods correspond with their descrip-
tion is intended to be a broader more common sense, test of a mercantile character. The 
question of whether that is what the buyer bargained for has to be answered using the

	134	 The duties of the seller
tests buyers in the market would apply, leaving more delicate questions of condition, or 
quality, to be determined under other clauses of the contract or sections of the Act.78
So where there was a contract for the sale of 500 tons of Argentina Bolita beans but 
the goods delivered contained a small proportion of other beans, the court referred the 
case back to arbitrators to find whether the goods as a whole would still be called by 
businessmen in the trade ‘Argentina Bolita beans’.79
In some cases, the description may carry with it an implication of quality of a certain 
kind. For instance, in the New Zealand case of Cotter v Luckie80 the buyer bought a bull 
described as ‘a pure bred polled Angus bull’ from the seller. The bull had been wanted, as 
the seller knew, for breeding purposes, but it turned out to have a physical abnormality 
which prevented it from breeding. The court held that the sale was a sale by description 
and that the description implied that the bull was capable of breeding. The court said:
The question . . . for decision is whether this was or was not a sale by a description having the 
effect of describing the animal as a stud bull. Both parties are farmers. The respondent could 
have no use for the animal save for the purpose of serving his cows, and it is to be observed that 
it was sold not as a bull merely, but as a pure-bred polled Angus bull. The descriptive words 
appear to me to be meaningless unless intended to convey the impression that the animal might 
be used to get this class of stock.81
There is another type of case which may involve the relation between s. 13 and the 
quality or fitness of the goods. If the contract calls for goods of a certain quality, this 
quality may itself become part of the contract description, but it seems that statements 
as to quality will not usually be treated as part of the contract description.82 On the 
other hand, there are some cases in which quality and description significantly overlap. 
To take an example once given by Lord Denning, if the goods being sold are said to be 
‘new-laid eggs’ this goes both to quality and description.83 However, for most purposes 
such cases give rise to no special problems. Breach by the seller will normally involve 
liability under ss. 13 and 14, and the overlap is of no particular importance. It would 
only be of importance where the implied condition under s. 14 is not applicable for some 
reason (e.g. where the seller is not a dealer) and the buyer has to rely exclusively on  
s. 13. He may then wish to argue that the term ‘new-laid eggs’ implies not merely that 
the eggs are literally new-laid, but that they are of good quality because that is the nat-
ural implication of the term. Conversely, if the buyer cannot complain about the quality 
(e.g. because of a valid exclusion clause) he is not entitled to raise the same complaint 
under the guise of a failure to conform to description.84

The duty to supply goods of the right quality 	 135
Compliance with s. 13
Whether goods correspond with their description will normally be a simple question of 
fact, but it is to be stressed that the duty of the seller is very strict indeed. We have already 
referred to Arcos Ltd v E A Ronaasen & Son as an illustration of the extreme severity of 
the duties which the section can place on the seller. Although some of these older cases are 
(as we have seen) suspect insofar as they hold trivial breaches to be breaches of conditions, 
that does not affect their authority as to what is a breach. It is still quite clearly the law that 
any non-conformity with the contract description (so long as it is a part of the description 
which constitutes a term of the contract)85 is a breach of contract, subject only to the 
de minimis principle.
Reference has already been made to the fact that ‘microscopic’ deviations may be 
diregarded in relation to the quantity of goods delivered, in accordance with the maxim 
de minimis, and there seems no reason to doubt that the same is true of compliance 
with the contract description.86 However, in Moralice (London) Ltd v E D & F Man,87 
McNair J held that where the price is payable by means of a documentary credit against 
shipping documents, the maxim de minimis has no application as between the seller and 
the bank: the shipping documents must comply strictly with the requirements of the 
letter of credit.88 McNair J went on to suggest that in this situation it is probably a nec-
essary inference that the de minimis maxim is also excluded even in the contract of sale 
as between buyer and seller.
In a number of more recent cases, Arcos Ltd v E A Ronaasen & Son has been distin-
guished by the courts. Where goods have been sold in some such terms as ‘fair average 
quality’ or the like, it has been held that this phrase must be construed as businessmen 
would construe it and as referring only to such qualities as are normally observable by 
ordinary visual examination. Thus goods contaminated by some undetectable substance 
could still be of ‘fair average quality’. Similarly, in Steel & Busks Ltd v Bleecker Bik & 
Co Ltd89 it was held that goods accorded with their description – which was ‘quality as 
previously delivered’ – despite the presence of some new chemical, not present in the 
original deliveries, which rendered the goods unfit for the buyers’ purposes. Sellers J 
found that ‘by the standard applied and accepted in the trade they complied with the 
description and were of the quality called for by the contract, quality not being affected 
by the chemical’. This decision was approved by the House of Lords in the Ashington 
Piggeries90 case on the ground that statements of this kind are not intended to be treated 
as part of the contract description of the goods. They are intended to indicate the qual-
ity desired, but not to identify the goods which the contract calls for. But this does not

	136	 The duties of the seller
mean that the buyer is without remedy, for he may be able to claim damages under 
s. 14(2) or (3).
But if the statement is part of the contract description it must be strictly complied with, 
though it does not follow that a description must always be taken literally. If goods have 
acquired a trade description they may correspond to their description even if they are not 
what a literal reading of the trade description suggests they are. As Darling J said in Lemy v 
Watson,91 ‘If anybody ordered Bombay ducks and somebody supplied him with ducks 
from Bombay the contract to supply Bombay ducks would not be fulfilled.’92 Usually this 
approach would be adopted to protect a buyer but it may sometimes protect the seller. In 
Grenfell v E B Meyrowitz Ltd,93 the defendants were held not to be in breach of s. 13 when 
they supplied goggles of ‘safety-glass’ to the plaintiff, which subsequently splintered in an 
accident, as it was proved that ‘safety-glass’ had acquired a technical trade meaning and 
the goggles in fact conformed to the normal design.94 Similarly, in Peter Darlington Partners 
Ltd v Gosho Co Ltd,95 there was a contract for the sale of 50 tons of canary seed on a ‘pure 
basis’. It was shown that there was no such thing in the trade as 100 per cent pure seed, and 
that the highest standard of purity was 98 per cent, it was therefore held that the buyers 
were in breach in refusing to accept 98 per cent pure seed.
Knowledge by the buyer and contracting-out
It is, perhaps, slightly odd that s. 13 says nothing about the possibility that the buyer 
may examine the goods and come to realise that the description is not entirely accurate, 
or perhaps that he should have realised this. As we shall see later,96 there are now severe 
limits on the extent to which a seller can contract out of liability under s. 13, so this pos-
sibility cannot be dealt with by holding that the implied condition is excluded by a con-
trary intention where the buyer knows that the description is inaccurate. Nevertheless, it 
would be very odd to hold that the seller is liable for a breach of s. 13 in such a case, and 
it must be expected that the courts would strive to avoid such a result; for instance, by 
holding that the sale is not by description.97
3 Implied terms that the goods are of satisfactory quality
There are two distinct cases where the Act implies a term that the goods supplied are of 
satisfactory quality, namely s. 14(2) and s. 15(2). These are as follows:

[1959] 1 WLR 1184; R v Ford Motor Co [1974] 1 WLR 1220.
94	 But this decision seems out of tune with the modern trend towards consumer protection; although trade terms 
may be allowed a technical meaning between businessmen, it is not so clear today that a consumer would be 
held bound by such a meaning unless he knew of it. Under the Trade Descriptions Act 1968 it is an offence to 
apply a false or misleading trade description to goods, and there would clearly be a breach of the Act if the 
facts of this case occurred today.

The duty to supply goods of the right quality 	 137
14.	 (2)	
Where the seller sells goods in the course of a business, there is an implied term that 
the goods supplied under the contract are of satisfactory quality.
	
(2A)	 For the purposes of this Act, goods are of satisfactory quality if they meet the 
standard that a reasonable person would regard as satisfactory, taking account 
of any description of the goods, the price (if relevant) and all the other relevant 
circumstances.
	
(2B)	 For the purposes of this Act, the quality of goods includes their state and condition 
and the following (among other things) are in appropriate cases aspects of the 
quality of goods___
(a)	 fitness for all the purposes for which goods of the kind in question are com-
monly supplied,
(b)	 appearance and finish,
(c)	 freedom from minor defects,
(d)	 safety, and
(e)	 durability.
	
(2C)	 The term implied by subsection (2) does not extend to any matter making the 
quality of goods unsatisfactory___
(a)	 which is specifically drawn to the buyer’s attention before the contract is made,
(b)	 where the buyer examines the goods before the contract is made, which that 
examination ought to reveal, or
(c)	 in the case of a contract for sale by sample, which would have been apparent 
on a reasonable examination of the sample.
Section 14(6) provides that as regards England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the terms 
implied by subs. (2) (and subs. (3), the fitness for purpose warranty, which is dealt with 
below) are conditions, so that, subject to the changes noted later,98 the effect of breach 
of these terms is the same as under the previous law. In Scotland, the effect of the breach 
depends upon its materiality.
Section 15(2) provides:
In the case of a contract for sale by sample[99] there is an implied term:
(c)	 that the goods shall be free from any defect, making their quality unsatisfactory, which 
would not be apparent on reasonable examination of the sample.
Again, in England, Wales and Northern Ireland this implied term is a condition.100 In 
Scotland, the effect of breach again depends on its materiality.
The Sale and Supply of Goods Act 1994 substituted the requirement that goods must 
be of ‘merchantable quality’ with the requirement that they must be of ‘satisfactory 
quality’. This implied term is in many respects the most important part of the law of 
sale of goods. It is here that the seller’s obligations as to the quality of the goods sup-
plied must be found, and this is the very heart of the law of sale. So it is not surprising 
that there has been a great deal of case law on this subject, and that there have been sev-
eral attempts to reform the law, culminating in the 1994 Act.
Under the 1893 Act no attempt to define the concept of ‘merchantable quality’ was 
made, and the matter was left entirely to case law. The word ‘merchantable’ seemed suf-
ficiently precise and appropriate to most lawyers and judges of the time, especially when 
	 98	 See below.

100	 1994 Act, Sch. 2, para. 5(6)(b).

	138	 The duties of the seller
the cases coming to their attention were mostly commercial contracts between business-
men. However, it appeared less appropriate in modern times when applied to consumer 
sales. Despite this, the word did service for some 80 years without any statutory defi-
nition. A very large body of case law eventually developed, not merely in this country 
also in the many common law jurisdictions (including the USA),101 which modelled their 
sales law on the 1893 Act. Not surprisingly, no simple or single judicial definition ever 
emerged. The contract of sale of goods covers such an extraordinarily wide range of 
transactions that it seems impossible that a single standard of quality could be formu-
lated which is appropriate to all kinds of goods, extending from machinery and plant to 
agricultural produce, to foods and drinks, to live animals and fish, to commodities like 
coal or iron ore or oil sold as raw materials and to goods sold for resale as well as for use.
There were many and repeated demands for a simple statutory statement of the 
standard of quality required of the seller, though lawyers were divided in their response 
to these demands. Some appear to have thought that a simple definition or statement 
of the seller’s duties could be provided, which would be applicable over a wide range 
of cases, and would simplify the law and eliminate the need to consult a large body of 
cases. No simple statutory statement or definition of the seller’s duties as regards qual-
ity could possibly cope with the wide variety of problems which the case law has illus-
trated, and that any attempt to avoid reference to the old case law would only lead to the 
new statutory term becoming itself encrusted with interpretive case law.102 There is still 
plenty of scope for a judge to manoeuvre, so that the outcome of particular cases will 
no doubt continue to be influenced by the view the judge forms of the reasonableness 
of the claimant’s (claimant’s) behaviour.103 Moreover, it is surely inevitable that where 
the application of the new warranty to new fields, such as computer software, has to be 
considered, courts will look at the case law from other common law jurisdictions where 
the old merchantable quality warranty is still in force. It will not be so easy to apply that 
case law directly, however, because of the new wording.
The Supply of Goods (Implied Terms) Act 1973 first made some response to the 
demand for reform and simplification by providing a statutory definition of the term 
‘merchantable quality’, and this, together with some minor amendments made by the 
same Act, was eventually incorporated in the 1979 consolidation as s. 14(6), which was 
as follows:
Goods of any kind are of merchantable quality within the meaning of subsection (2) above if 
they are as fit for the purpose or purposes for which goods of that kind are commonly bought 
as it is reasonable to expect having regard to any description applied to them, the price (if 
relevant) and all the other relevant circumstances.
In addition, it is necessary to note that under s. 61 of the Act the word ‘quality’ was 
defined104 as including ‘the state or condition of the goods’.
101	 The Uniform Commercial Code, Art. 2-314(2) attempts to spell out the characteristics that goods must have 
to be ‘merchantable’, but this is not particularly helpful either.
102	 Rather than attempting a comprehensive definition, the Law Commissions might perhaps have been better 
advised to have provided non-exhaustive definitions and illustrative examples of when the warranty would 
(or would not) be broken.
103	 See, e.g., Millars of Falkirk Ltd v Turpie 1976 SLT (Notes) 66 discussed p. 155, n. 184 and p. 156 below.
104	 This definition is omitted in the new provisions, and is included in the new warranty – s. 14(2B).

	
	 	
The duty to supply goods of the right quality 	 139
But this definition, which was based on the recommendations of the Law Commis-
sions, was probably not intended to have any substantial effect on the law. The Law 
Commissions at that time appear to have accepted the impossibility of solving all the 
difficulties of application by the apparently simple process of definition.
For some years, the case law proceeded in the old way, despite the statutory definition. 
Former editions of this book continued to discuss the case law at some length, before 
even considering the statutory definition. Likewise, in Aswan Engineering Establishment 
Co v Lupdine Ltd,105 in 1987, the Court of Appeal analysed the cases at length before 
proceeding to the statutory definition, and clearly thought this was the appropriate pro-
cedure. In the same year a case concerning the merchantability of a car was brought 
before Rougier J who was told that the motor trade was concerned at the lack of any 
definition of the concept in its application to vehicles.106 Rougier J responded that it was 
doubtful if ‘any all-embracing definition of a car of merchantable quality could ever 
be made’,107 and he added that the statutory definition was probably deliberately left in 
the widest possible terms ‘in order to cater for the great variety of situations which may 
occur’.108 He went on to say:
Any attempt to forge some exhaustive, positive and specific definition of such a term, applicable 
in all cases, would soon be put to mockery by some new undreamt of set of circumstances.109
But in Rogers v Parish (Scarborough) Ltd,110 another panel of the Court of Appeal 
adopted a completely different approach to the question. The court here insisted that 
the then fairly recent definition in s. 14(6) was in simple language which could easily be 
applied to a variety of circumstances without difficulty. They deprecated the practice of 
looking at the old case law, and insisted that the new definition should be applied with-
out reference to the prior law.
At the same time as that the courts were disagreeing on their attitude to this ques-
tion, the Law Commissions were re-examining the whole issue. In their Working Paper 
issued in 1983, the Commissions still appeared to think, as their predecessors had done, 
that all attempts at simple definitions were doomed to failure.111 At the same time they 
thought that there would be advantages in jettisoning the term ‘merchantable’ and also 
in clarifying the law on a number of specific points which had previously given rise to 
doubts and difficulties. By the time of the 1987 Final Report, however, the Law Com-
missions appeared to have changed their stance.112 They now appeared to think that it 
was possible to lay down a simple standard of ‘acceptable’ quality, which, when fleshed 
out with some supplementary provisions, would be workable and meaningful. So the 
draft Sale and Supply of Goods Bill recommended by the Law Commissions contained 
a number of new subsections designed to replace the existing s. 14(2) and the definition

	140	 The duties of the seller
of merchantable quality in s. 14(6). The 1994 Act substantially adopts these recom-
mendations, but substitutes the words ‘satisfactory quality’ for the Law Commissions’ 
‘acceptable quality’. It is not altogether easy to understand the reason for this change, as 
the word ‘satisfactory’ is often associated with mediocrity.
As might have been predicted, the old case law has continued to be well used. The 
views equivalent to those expressed by the Court of Appeal in Rogers v Parish (Scarbor-
ough) Ltd do not seem to have not prevailed. The fundamental difficulty appears to be 
that the body of case law relative to the vast volume of sales contracts is actually quite 
small and as each case turns largely on its own facts, there is a pressing need to look at 
the old cases in order to determine the correct approach across as many broadly similar 
cases as possible. Moreover, the decision in Pepper (Inspector of Taxes) v Hart113 would 
allow a court to look at the Law Commissions’ Report which led to the enactment of the 
1994 Act, and the views expressed there on the old cases will have some relevance to the 
interpretation of the new provisions. Extensive treatment of the old cases may be justi-
fied, in the absence of a body of case law on the new provisions, as illustrating the wide 
variety of fact situations the courts may have to grapple with in applying them, and also 
because for some time yet cases coming before the courts will fall to be dealt with under 
the old provisions.114
But it is first necessary to start with an examination of the circumstances which give 
rise to the seller’s obligations under s. 14(2) – whatever those obligations may be.
In what circumstances does the condition apply?
Where the seller sells goods in the course of a business
The implied term of satisfactory quality in s. 14(2) only applies to goods sold by the 
seller in the course of a business,115 and in this respect no change is made from the for-
mer position. The 1973 Act and the present Act affirm the construction placed on the 
less clear words of the original s. 14(2) by the House of Lords in the Ashington Piggeries 
113	 [1993] 1 All ER 42. Compare Aswan Engineering Establishment Company v Lupdine [1987] 1 WLR 1 
where Lloyd LJ wished to look at the earlier reports dealing with the then present statutory definition of 
‘merchantable quality’ but both counsel objected. Pepper v Hart has been accepted in Scotland: Short’s Tr v 
Keeper of the Registers of Scotland 1994 SC 122, aff’d 1996 SC (HL) 14.
114	 The new provisions came into effect on 3 January 1995, and were not retrospective: the old law still applied 
to contracts made before that date – Sale and Supply of Goods Act 1994, s. 8(3).
115	 The original s. 14(2) required that the goods be bought by description from a seller who dealt in goods of that 
description. The reason for that is clear from the cases referred to by Judge Chalmers in his commentary on 
the section – Sale of Goods (2nd edn), p. 29 (in reality the first edition after the 1893 Act). All of those cases 
involved unexamined goods bought by description, which explained the proviso ‘provided that if the buyer 
has examined the goods, there shall be no implied condition as regards defects which such examination ought 
to have revealed’. In the case of specific goods, there would have been only two implied warranties – title 
and, if appropriate, fitness for purpose – and property would pass under s. 18, Rule 1 when the contract was 
made, so that the buyer could not reject (see original s. 11(1)(c)). In the case of unexamined goods, if the seller 
purported to appropriate non-conforming goods, no property could pass until the buyer accepted them, either 
by retaining them or by doing an act inconsistent with the seller’s ownership – s. 35 of the 1893 Act. On this 
interpretation, the provisions of the 1893 Act fitted together, and the passing of property and acceptance or 
rejection were linked. Problems arose when s. 14(2) was extended to other circumstances than its original 
sphere of application, especially in order to protect consumers. The result has been the need for ingenious 
reworking of the concept of ‘property’, as seen in Kwei Tek Chao v British Traders & Shippers Ltd – see 
p. 452. We are grateful to Professor Robert Bradgate for suggesting this line of research.

	
	 	
The duty to supply goods of the right quality 	 141
case.116 Goods sold privately by a seller, not selling in the course of business, are there-
fore not within the section, though, as seen above, they are within s. 13, which requires 
conformity with description. Thus, as previously seen, a person who sells a second-hand 
car privately as a ‘1961 Herald’ impliedly promises that it is a 1961 Herald though he 
does not otherwise impliedly promise that it is of any particular quality. In Stevenson 
and another v Rogers,117 it was held that having regard to the changes effected to s. 14(2) 
of the Sale of Goods Act 1893 by the Supply of Goods (Implied Terms) Act 1973, now 
to be found in s. 14(2) of the 1979 Act, habitual dealing in the type of goods sold is not 
required, a ‘one off’ sale in the course of a business sufficing. That case involved the sale 
of a fishing boat by a fisherman. The judge at first instance held that this was not a sale 
in the course of a business because it did not have any element of regularity. The Court 
of Appeal, however, decided that habitual dealing in the type of goods sold was not a 
requirement of the section; it sufficed that the sale was in the course of a business.118
Section 14(5), which was first enacted in the 1973 Act, deals with the problem of a 
private seller who sells through an agent. This provides as follows:
(5)	 The preceding provisions of this section apply to a sale by a person who in the course of a 
business is acting as agent for another as they apply to a sale by a principal in the course of 
a business, except where that other is not selling in the course of a business and either the 
buyer knows that fact or reasonable steps are taken to bring it to the notice of the buyer 
before the contract is made.
So the implied term under s. 14(2) applies if the agent is selling in the course of busi-
ness unless the principal is not acting in the course of business and the buyer is aware 
of this, or reasonable steps are taken to bring it to the buyer’s notice. So, for instance, 
an auctioneer acting for a private seller can exclude these sections by making it clear 
that the principal is a private seller. If he does not do so, the auctioneer will be liable 
under this section, and the owner will also be liable unless he can bring himself within 
the exception. In Boyter v Thomson,119 a principal, acting privately, sold a boat through 
an agent acting in the course of a business, but the buyer was unaware of the princi-
pal’s existence at the time of the sale. The House of Lords found the principal liable to 
the buyer for defects in the boat under s. 14(5) and the principles of the common law 
116	 [1972] AC 441.

118	 In R & B Custom Brokers Co Ltd v United Dominions Trust Ltd [1988] 1 All ER 847 – see p. 165 – it was 
held that a private company which bought a car for the personal and business use of its directors, as it had 
done two or three times previously, dealt as consumer. The Court of Appeal reached this decision, on the 
basis that the same test is applicable as in the case of the Trade Descriptions Act 1968, under which the 
court has to decide whether a false trade description has been applied ‘in the course of a business’. Under 
that case law, a transaction only incidental to a business activity, rather than integral to it, is not done ‘in the 
course of a business’: a degree of regularity must be established. This same approach might be applied in 
the present context. It is clear from Stevenson and another v Rogers that the ratio of this decision is limited 
to the application of s. 12 of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977. The requirement of regularity does not 
mean, however, that the very first sale made by a business, or indeed its very last sale, are beyond the scope 
of s. 14(2) – see Buchanan-Jardine v Hamilink 1983 SLT 149. Stevenson and another v Rogers and R & B 
Customs Brokers v United Dominions Trust were discussed by the Court of Appeal in Feldarol Foundry 
plc v Hermes Leasing (London) Ltd [2004] EWCA Civ 747. The court held it was bound by the decision in 
the latter case. The Inner House of the Court of Session, on the other hand, has preferred the approach in 
Stevenson in a sale of goods case: see MacDonald v Pollock [2012] CSIH 12, 2013 SC 22.

of agency, whereby an undisclosed principal may be sued on any contract made on his 
behalf. An argument that only the agent could be liable under s. 14(5) was rejected. No 
change in this subsection is made by the 1994 Act.
Section 15(2)(c), which deals with sales by sample, contains no words corresponding 
to those in s. 14(2) discussed above. This is presumably recognition of the fact that a per-
son who sells goods by sample is unlikely to be a private seller, but will almost invariably 
be selling in the course of business.
Second-hand goods
There was nothing in the former s. 14(2) which restricted its application to new goods, 
and the sale of second-hand vehicles has therefore been held to be within the subsec-
tion.120 Furthermore, the test of merchantability (as it then was) to be applied in the case 
of second-hand vehicles was held to be precisely the same statutory test as applied to 
new goods,121 though it did not follow that goods must be held to be merchantable when 
sold new just because they would be regarded as satisfying the statutory test if sold as 
second-hand.122 Also, the exceptions in the old paras (a) and (b) were much more likely 
to be relevant in second-hand sales.123 No change in respect of these points was made by 
the 1994 Act, or was contained in the Law Commissions’ recommendations.
No reliance on seller need be shown
In contrast to the implied condition as to fitness for purpose, which is contained 
in s. 14(3) (and which is dealt with later), the implied condition in s. 14(2) normally 
applied even though the buyer had in no way relied on the seller’s skill and judgment. 
The implied term was a guarantee of inherent quality, and did not depend on any show-
ing that the buyer had relied on the seller. This could lead to liability in extreme situa-
tions. For example, if a buyer ordered goods from the seller which were only made by 
one manufacturer so that the goods could only be obtained from that manufacturer or 
from someone who had bought from him, the seller would still be treated as warranting  
the merchantable quality of the goods.124 In such a case, it might seem that the seller had 
complied with his contract simply by supplying the buyer with precisely what he had 
asked for, but this did not exonerate the seller from liability. The reason for this rule, 
which might seem hard on the seller, was that in most circumstances the seller would 
himself be able to obtain an indemnity from the manufacturer on the ground that the 
contract between them also imported the implied term of merchantable quality.125 The 
rule applied, however, even though the seller could not in the particular circumstances

The duty to supply goods of the right quality 	 143
obtain such an indemnity; for example, because the manufacturer was insolvent or the 
time under the Limitation Act had run out.126 The 1994 Act did not alter this.
However, if the manufacturer was only willing to supply the goods subject to some 
limitation on his liability and the buyer knew this fact when he ordered the goods from 
the seller, it was held that this would normally negative the implied condition between 
buyer and seller.127 The 1994 Act did not affect this, but this would amount to an implied 
exclusion of s. 14(2) liability and must therefore satisfy the requirement of reasonable-
ness in the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977, but since this is an implied exclusionary 
term, which derives from the courts’ sense of its fairness and justice, it can hardly be 
suggested that it would be unreasonable. If in any particular circumstances the court felt 
that the seller should be liable despite these facts, it would presumably refuse to imply a 
term excluding the application of s. 14(2) and the application of the 1977 Act just would 
not arise.
A similar problem would arise if the buyer ordered goods made to his own specifi-
cation, and the specification was itself such that any goods made to that specification 
would be inherently defective or unsatisfactory. It could hardly be supposed that in such 
a case the buyer could sue under s. 14(2), though it is not easy to state the precise ground 
on which the seller could escape liability. The problem was discussed by the Court of 
Appeal in the Ashington Piggeries case128 where a number of possible reasons were given, 
some of which cannot survive the House of Lords appeal in that case.129 But one sugges-
tion which is not inconsistent with the decision of the House of Lords is that where the 
essence of the contract is the making or compounding of goods to someone else’s order 
or prescription, the seller’s duty may be limited to using all reasonable skill and care in 
selecting materials and making the goods. But this may be criticised because the seller’s 
duties are traditionally thought of as warranties involving strict liability, and it could 
hardly be supposed that the seller would be free from liability in such a case if, despite 
all care and skill, he delivered goods not precisely in accordance with the specifications. 
It is thought that the best reason for denying liability in the case of goods made to the 
buyer’s own specification would be that, in the circumstances given, the goods should 
not be treated as unsatisfactory. As we shall see later, merchantability was a somewhat 
flexible concept (despite the statutory definition introduced by the 1973 Act),130 and it 
seems to have been considered that the buyer was the best judge of what he wanted. If 
the buyer got exactly what he had ordered, it is very difficult to them claim that the goods 
were unmerchantable. It is reasonable to suppose that this would still be the same under 
the new provisions. Treating s. 14(2) as excluded by implication might be an alternative 
way of dealing with the hypothetical problem above. Although no reference was made 
to the approach suggested in Ashington Piggeries by the Court of Appeal in Lowe v 
W Machell Joinery131 which concerned the sale of goods where the buyers had a hand in

their design. Although admittedly, the argument would have achieved little for counsel, 
as a consumer sale, the implied exclusion of liability would have fallen foul of the prohi-
bition then in place in s. 6(2) of the UCTA.
Since the problems discussed in the last three paragraphs arose entirely as a matter 
of case law, and did not arise from the wording of the then existing Act, nor of the 
statutory definition of ‘merchantable quality’ in s. 14(6), it is not surprising that the 
new s. 14(2) is no clearer on these points than the former sections. There is absolutely 
nothing in the language of the new s. 14(2) which is directly relevant to these difficulties, 
so it was presumably not intended to have any effect on them. Yet it is just arguable that 
the change from the concept of ‘merchantable quality’ to that of ‘satisfactory quality’ 
may indirectly affect the result in these cases. It may, perhaps, be arguable that if the 
buyer gets precisely what he has ordered from the seller it would be very unreasonable of 
him to complain that the goods are not of ‘satisfactory quality’. This point is discussed 
further when we come to a more detailed examination of the concepts of ‘merchantable’ 
and ‘satisfactory’ quality, but it can be said here that the argument appears to be mis-
conceived. Probably, the amendments have no effect on the principles applicable to these 
questions.
Defects drawn to the buyer’s attention, and examination of the goods
The implied condition that the goods must be satisfactory is excluded in two cases (for-
merly covered by s. 14(2)(a) and (b) of the 1979 Act). These exclusions are now to be 
found in s. 14(2C)(a) and (b), but the new Act makes no substantive change in them. In 
addition, s. 14(2C)(c) provides that in a contract for sale by sample, the condition does 
not extend to any matter which would have been apparent on a reasonable examination 
of the sample. The first excluded case concerns defects specifically drawn to the buyer’s 
attention before the contract is made, or after the contract is made at the time the goods 
are delivered.132 No difficulty arises in this regard, except that the wording of the para-
graph probably does not help a seller who tries to draw the buyer’s attention to defects 
in the goods solely by printed wording in a written contract. It is hardly to be supposed 
that the court would regard this as sufficient to draw the buyer’s attention ‘specifically’ 
to any defects.
In addition to matters specifically drawn to the buyer’s attention by the seller, it is 
clear that a course of dealings between the parties might affect the extent of the seller’s 
duties, if the buyer became aware of defects in the goods but continued to order them. 
In such circumstances there must come a point where the buyer becomes unable to 
seize on the defects as a reason for rejecting the goods, or indeed for claiming dam-
ages in respect of them. An interesting illustration of this is the American case of Royal 
Business Machines v Lorraine Corporation.133 The buyers in that case were dealers in 
Royal’s photocopiers. One of the statements made by Royal about their machines was 
that service calls were needed only every 7,000–9,000 copies, a statement which if untrue 
would clearly have rendered the seller liable to the dealers at the outset. However, over an 
132	 See Clegg v Olle Andersson (T/A Nordic Marine) [2003] EWCA Civ 320.

18-month period, the dealers learned the truth about the performance of the machines, 
which was that they needed rather more frequent service calls. Since they had continued 
to purchase the machines, there must have been a point at which they had ceased to 
rely on the seller’s assertion about service calls. After that, they could scarcely complain 
about the seller’s breach of warranty.
The second exclusion, concerning examination of the goods, is now contained in para. 
(b) of s. 14(2C) and the third exclusion, in the case of a sale by sample, in s. 14(2C)(c), but 
the effect of these provisions is slightly different. It was clear that the old subs. (2)(b) 
only applied if the buyer had actually examined the goods, and the wording of s. 14(2) 
inserted by the 1973 Act134 did not alter the effect of the 1893 Act on this point. But the 
subsection probably did alter the law on another point. In Thornett & Fehr v Beers & 
Son,135 it was held that the proviso to the original s. 14(2) of the 1893 Act applied where 
the buyer, being pressed for time, examined some barrels of glue only from the outside, 
although the seller offered him every facility for a more complete examination. The orig-
inal section in the 1893 Act had itself modified the common law rule, which was that 
the implied condition was excluded by the mere opportunity for examination, even if 
in fact the opportunity was not taken. Thornett & Fehr v Beers & Son went some way 
to restore the common law position and was open to criticism on the wording of the 
original section. The proviso formerly said that ‘if the buyer has examined the goods, 
there shall be no implied condition as regards defects which such examination ought 
to have revealed’. The crucial words were ‘such examination’, that is, the examination 
actually made, not a hypothetical examination which might or ought to have been made. 
As there was no evidence to suggest that the defect should have been revealed by the 
examination actually made, the proviso should not have been relevant. This seems to 
have been the view taken in the Australian case of Frank v Grosvenor Motor Auctions 
Pty Ltd136 and the present wording deriving from the 1973 Act specifically refers to ‘that 
examination’, which seems to have put the point beyond doubt. No change is made on 
this point by the 1994 Act.137
A problem had arisen about s. 14(2)(b) – which could also have arisen with regard 
to para. (a) of the 1979 Act. (This is, perhaps, one more illustration of how new and 
unforeseen problems constantly arise out of the simplest statutory wording.) In R & B 
Customs Brokers Co Ltd v United Dominions Trust,138 a car was bought on conditional 
sale for the private use of a company director. The car was delivered a few days before 
the relevant documents were signed, and thus before the contract had legally been con-
cluded. Before this happened the plaintiffs’ director discovered that the roof was leak-
ing, though he naturally expected that the dealers would put this right, and in fact they 
undertook to do so some days later. However, despite numerous attempts, the leak was 
never satisfactorily repaired, and eventually the plaintiffs claimed to reject the car for 
breach of the implied conditions as to quality and fitness. But the defendants argued that 
as a result of the plaintiffs’ examination of the car before the contract was made, they

	146	 The duties of the seller
had knowledge of the defect in question so as to exclude liability under s. 14(2)(b). The 
Court of Appeal felt that if this was the result of the statutory wording, it would be a 
trap for any buyer who took delivery of the goods before making a concluded contract, 
but they expressed no final opinion on the question. The sellers were held liable under s. 
14(3) (the fitness for purpose warranty). The amendment effected by the 1994 Act pro-
vides that the buyer is not deemed to have accepted goods merely because he asks for or 
agrees to their repair,139 but otherwise does not address the above problem.
Of course, if, before the contract is made, the seller points out a defect to a buyer, 
or if the buyer discovers it for himself, and the seller undertakes to put it right, then it 
will be immaterial if the implied condition under s. 14(2A) is excluded as regards that 
defect because the seller would plainly be liable on a separate, collateral contract, or for  
breach of a simple express term of the contract. But in the R & B Customs Brokers case, 
the dealer’s undertaking to repair the leak was apparently made after the contract was 
concluded, and no separate collateral contract or warranty was pleaded on the basis of 
this undertaking.140
In the case of a sale by sample, the effect of s. 14(2C)(c)141 is to exclude the implied 
condition that the goods are satisfactory if the defect would have been apparent on a  
reasonable examination of the sample, whether or not it has in fact been examined. In a 
sale by sample, the seller is entitled to assume that the buyer will examine the sample, and  
the latter can hardly be heard to complain of defects which he could have discovered by 
the simple process of examining the sample.142 A fortiori this is the case where the buyer 
does in fact examine the sample and discovers the defect, but decides to take the goods 
all the same. ‘If there is a defect in the sample which renders the goods unmerchantable 
and the buyer, notwithstanding, and with knowledge of that defect in the sample, is con-
tent to take a delivery which corresponds with the sample and gets such a delivery, he has 
no ground of complaint.’143
It is not uncommon where the goods remain packaged in their original container and 
unopened throughout the transaction, for the buyer to have examined an identical item 
beforehand; for example, of a showroom or shop. If the defect is one which is pres-
ent and apparent in all models of the goods, the implied condition obviously could be 
excluded.144 Equally, many cases can be envisaged in which a court might be reluctant 
to reach this result. Either it could make the requirement that the defect be ‘apparent’ 
a stringent one or it could hold that such cases are not sales by sample at all, on the 
139	 Section 35(6).
140	 Nevertheless, it is arguable that the dealer could be liable on such an undertaking on the basis of Blackpool 
& Fylde Aero Club Ltd v Blackpool Borough Council [1990] 3 All ER 25. Alternatively, consideration might 
be found in the buyer not exercising the right of rejection.
141	 Section 15(2)(c) of the 1979 Act.
142	 It has, however, been argued in relation to the former provisions that, where the implied condition of 
merchantable quality was excluded under s. 15(2)(c) as regards defects which examination of the sample 
ought to have revealed, the buyer might still be able to sue under s. 14(2) in respect of a defect which 
the actual examination could not have revealed. See Murdoch (1981) 44 MLR 388. Only a very literalist 
interpretation of the Act could justify such an absurd conclusion, and the 1994 Act makes it clear in relation 
to s. 14(2) as well as s. 15 that, when a sample is provided, it is what a reasonable examination of the sample 
ought to have revealed, and not any actual examination.

144	 ‘Defect’ is perhaps the wrong word in this context. If the displayed goods lack a feature which would be 
present in more expensive goods, and this is obvious, the buyer could scarcely complain.

ground that they are not intended as such.145 They could be described as sales ‘by model’ 
perhaps.146
There are many illustrations in the reports in any event of defects which could not 
have been discovered by any reasonable examination, but two will suffice here. In Wren v 
Holt,147 the plaintiff recovered damages for breach of the condition of merchantability 
of beer which was contaminated by arsenic. The proviso was clearly inapplicable as the 
defect was not discoverable on reasonable examination. In Godley v Perry,148 a child’s 
catapult which broke in ordinary use was likewise held to be suffering from a defect not 
discoverable on reasonable examination.
What is the extent of the seller’s obligation?
Goods to which s. 14(2) extends
It is well established that under the old provisions as well as the current, that the sub-
section covers not only the goods actually bought by the buyer and passing to him, but 
packages or containers in which the goods are sold, even if these remain the property of 
the seller. In Geddling v Marsh149 (a case under the old s. 14(1), now s. 14(3)), it was held 
that the seller’s obligations covered not only goods which were the actual subject-matter 
of the sale, namely mineral waters, but also the bottles in which the waters were contained, 
even though these remained the property of the seller.150 Consequently, the plaintiff was 
able to recover damages for injuries received when a defective bottle burst.
A similar point arose in Wilson v Rickett Cockerell & Co Ltd,151 where the plaintiff 
ordered a consignment of Coalite (a brand of smokeless coal or ‘coke’) from the defend-
ants. Unknown to either party the Coalite contained an explosive substance which blew 
up in the plaintiff’s fireplace, causing considerable damage. Here the plaintiff succeeded 
under s. 14(2) on the grounds that the goods were not of merchantable quality. Referring 
to the words ‘goods supplied under a contract of sale’ (which have been replaced with-
out significant alteration in the present sections), Lord Denning observed:
In my opinion that means the goods delivered in purported pursuance of the contract. The 
section applies to all goods so delivered whether they conform to the contract or not: that is, 
in this case, to the whole consignment, including the offending piece, and not merely to the 
Coalite alone.152
Dealing with the defendants’ argument that there was nothing wrong with the Coalite 
as such and that it was only the presence of the piece of explosive that made the goods 
dangerous, Lord Denning went on:

	148	 The duties of the seller
Coal is not bought by the lump. It is bought by the sack or by the hundredweight or by the ton. 
The consignment is delivered as a whole and must be considered as a whole, not in bits. A sack 
of coal, which contains hidden in it a detonator, is not fit for burning and no sophistry should 
lead us to believe that it is fit.153
It might have been thought that the contrary was unarguable were it not for the deci-
sion of the Court of Session in Duke v Jackson154 where, on the same facts, the coal 
merchant was held not liable on the ground that there was nothing wrong with the coal 
itself. The Court of Appeal, in refusing to follow this case, pointed to Chapronière v 
Mason,155 where the defendant sold a bun containing a stone on which the plaintiff 
broke a tooth, and a verdict for the defendant was set aside by the Court of Appeal. 
These cases received implicit statutory confirmation in the provisions replacing them 
from 1973 onwards because they expressly extended the implied conditions in these sub-
sections to the ‘goods supplied under the contract’.156 The current iteration of s. 14(2) 
continues to use the same words.
The former statutory definition of merchantable quality,  
and its replacement by ‘satisfactory quality’
The extent of the seller’s duty depended largely upon the meaning to be attached to the 
term ‘merchantable quality’ and therefore after the 1973 Act on s. 14(6) which attempted 
a definition of that term. Section 14(6) was set out above.157
As we have previously noted, there were two approaches to the problems of decid-
ing what was the meaning of ‘merchantable quality’. On the one hand, there was the 
view that the statutory definition really had little substantive content. The basis for 
this view was that vague, general terms like ‘merchantable’ tend to be meaningless in  
practice – indeed, a substantial degree of flexibility is needed in applying such general 
terms because of the very varied transactions which come within the law of sale of 
goods. The same can be said of the term ‘satisfactory’. All vague statements or defi-
nitions of the standard of quality required by the law, it may be suggested, are some-
what vacuous in practice. They tend to be replaced with concepts of reasonableness 
which have substantial flexibility. Most such standards give little guidance as to what 
kind of defects or damage will render goods unsatisfactory (unmerchantable under 
the former provisions), and are unhelpful in the practical application of the law. All 
rely heavily upon the test of reasonableness: would a reasonable buyer, if he knew the 
­condition of the goods, accept them under the contract? Would a reasonable buyer 
expect goods of that condition to be delivered under that sort of contract? Tests which 
depend so ­heavily upon standards of reasonableness tend to be somewhat circular in 
practice. What is the buyer entitled to expect under the contract? Answer – goods of

156	 Presumably a buyer in a situation such as that in Wilson v Rickett, Cockerell & Co Ltd (though not in 
Chapronière v Mason) who discovered the foreign substance in the goods before damage was done would 
have been able to reject under s. 30(4) (now repealed), on the ground that the seller had ‘delivered the goods 
he contracted to sell mixed with goods of a different description’ – see p. 117 as to the former s. 30(4).
157	 See p. 138.

satisfactory/merchantable quality. What is satisfactory/merchantable quality? Answer – 
goods of that quality (roughly speaking) which it is reasonable to expect. What would 
the buyer reasonably expect? Answer – goods suitable for reasonable use. What is rea-
sonable use? Answer – the sort of use which a reasonable buyer would intend. And so on.
On the other hand, as we have also noted,158 there was a Court of Appeal decision, 
Rogers v Parish (Scarborough) Ltd,159 which suggested that the statutory definition of 
‘merchantable quality’ provided by the 1973 Act could in most cases be applied by a 
fact finder without any detailed analysis of old case law. It must be suggested that the 
reasoning in this case was incorrect. The court assumed here that the application of the 
statutory definition in the old s. 14(6) was a question of fact but the introduction of 
reasonableness into the definition meant that questions of evaluation were necessarily 
involved. It is not possible to invoke the ‘reasonable man’ and consider how he would 
behave as though that were a question of fact. How a reasonable man would behave in 
any given circumstances is not a fact, but an evaluation. Questions of reasonableness 
require the court to provide the answer from its sense of justice, but that means that 
detailed analysis and illustration must remain necessary unless every case is to be dis-
posed of by an appeal to the court’s idiosyncratic views on what justice demands. That 
would, surely, be quite unacceptable in such a large and important area of law as this. 
This same point can be made in relation to the new section, which provides that goods 
are satisfactory if they meet the standard that a reasonable person would regard as satis-
factory. In Bramhill v Edwards160 Auld LJ observed:
The reasonable person must be one who is in the position of the buyer, with his knowledge; 
for it would not be appropriate for the test to be that of a reasonable third party observer not 
acquainted with the background of the transaction.161
This is a question of law for the judge to decide, though in appropriate cases he or she 
can take account of expert testimony.162
The test of fitness for purpose
Section 14(6), which provided the statutory definition of merchantable quality, had as its 
main element the requirement that the goods should be reasonably fit for the purpose or 
purposes for which goods of that kind were commonly bought. The present provisions 
provide that the quality of goods includes their state and condition and that among 
other things which are aspects of the quality of goods is their fitness for all (emphasis 
supplied) the purposes for which goods of the kind in question are commonly supplied. 
Clearly, fitness for purpose was an important – indeed, an essential – element in the 
concept of merchantable quality, and remains important under the present provisions. In 
this connection it must be noted that s. 14(3) is also, and more especially, concerned with 
fitness for purpose, but that subsection is directed more to the case where the goods are

	150	 The duties of the seller
required for some particular purpose which has been made known to the seller. Section 
14(2), on the other hand, concerns fitness for ordinary purposes which do not have to be 
specially made known to the seller. (In fact, the distinction between the two subsections 
has been muddied because such a wide interpretation has been given to s. 14(3) that in 
practice it often covers ordinary purposes as well as special purposes, so the two subsec-
tions in practice overlap significantly.)
The question arises whether the new statutory definition clears up one major ambigu-
ity which had previously been explored in the cases. Many goods are used for a variety 
of purposes, and the goods supplied under the contract may be fit for some of these 
purposes while being unfit for others. If the buyer has not made known to the seller the 
particular purpose he wanted the goods for (in which case he could sue under s. 14(3)), 
are the goods to be treated as satisfactory/merchantable or not? In Aswan Engineering 
Establishment Co v Lupdine Ltd,163 the plaintiffs bought waterproofing compound in 
plastic pails for export to Kuwait from the defendants, L. L had bought the pails from 
the second defendants, B. When the pails were unloaded on the quayside at Kuwait, they 
were stacked (six pails high) in intense sun (reaching a temperature of 60 to 70 degrees 
Celsius) for some days. As a result, the pails collapsed under their own weight and the 
waterproofing compound was lost. The plaintiffs sued L and succeeded on grounds not 
stated in the reports. L then in turn claimed damages from B for breach of s. 14(2) and 
(3), as well as in tort. Only the former claim falls to be considered here. So far as liability 
under s. 14(2) was concerned, the problem obviously was that the pails were perfectly 
fit for most purposes for which such pails would be used; they were simply unfit to be 
stacked six high in such intense heat. The Court of Appeal held that the goods satis-
fied the requirement that they should be of merchantable quality. But it must be said 
that the court reached this conclusion by looking at the earlier case law first, and then 
concluded that the statutory definition was not intended to alter the law. Section 14(6) 
required goods to be ‘as fit for the purpose or purposes for which goods of that kind are 
commonly bought’ as it was reasonable to expect. The present provision requires ‘fitness 
for all the purposes for which goods of the kind in question are commonly supplied’, so 
that if the seller knows that goods are not fit for one of the purposes for which goods of 
the kind are commonly supplied, he must make this known to the buyer.164 It is unlikely, 
however, that if the facts of the Aswan case were to recur, and the case fell to be decided 
under the present provisions, the outcome would be any different.
It therefore seems impossible at this point to avoid looking at some of the earlier case 
law. The particular point under consideration here was exhaustively discussed by the 
House of Lords in Henry Kendall & Sons v William Lillico & Sons Ltd,165 in which the 
plaintiffs bought, for their pheasants, animal feedstuff containing Brazilian groundnut 
(peanut) extract. The groundnut extract had been contaminated. The ground nut extract 
had been bought by the sellers from G who had in turn bought it from K. The sellers paid 
damages to the plaintiffs, and claimed those damages in turn from G, who claimed from 
K. G and K were held not liable under s. 14(2) on the ground that the ground nut extract

165	 [1969] 2 AC 31.

	
	 	
The duty to supply goods of the right quality 	 151
was not of unmerchantable quality. The reason for this was that the extract was perfectly 
suitable to be used in making up animal feedstuffs for use for cattle and other animals; 
it was only unsatisfactory for use in making feedstuff for pheasant and partridge chicks. 
Apart from one further complication considered again later, this was therefore held not 
to make the goods of unmerchantable quality because in substance the goods were per-
fectly usable for one of the main purposes for which such goods were commonly bought. 
It was pointed out that commodities sold under a general description such as ‘Brazilian 
ground nut extraction’ may be bought by different buyers for a wide variety of uses. 
The House of Lords thought that it would be unreasonable to say that because the 
goods were unsuitable for only one of these possible uses the goods were to be treated 
as unmerchantable. A buyer whose complaint was that the goods were unsuitable just 
for the one use he had in mind must try to bring his case under s. 14(3) if he could do 
so (which would normally mean that he would have to show that he told the seller the 
particular purpose he had in mind), and could not expect to persuade the court that the 
goods were altogether unmerchantable. If the purposes for which the buyer requires 
the goods are not common ones, this will still be the case under the new provisions, 
but, as explained below, the actual outcome on the facts of this case might be different.
A similar case is the older decision in Sumner Permain & Co Ltd v Webb & Co Ltd.166 
The sellers sold Webb’s Indian Tonic to the buyers which they knew the buyers intended 
for resale in Argentina. The tonic contained a quantity of salicylic acid which, unknown 
to both parties, made its sale illegal in Argentina. When the tonic reached Argentina it 
was seized and condemned by the authorities as unfit for human consumption. It was 
held that there had been no breach of s. 14(2) as the goods could not be said to be unmer-
chantable by reason of the provisions of Argentinian law. There was nothing wrong with 
the quality of the goods, which could have been resold by the buyers anywhere except 
in Argentina. Goods were not unmerchantable merely because they were not fit for one 
particular purpose. The buyers’ complaint was really that the goods were not fit for the 
purpose for which they were sold, but they also failed under s. 14(3) because they had 
ordered them under their trade name. The case again illustrates the difference between 
s. 14(2) and (3).167 It is submitted that the outcome should still be the same under the 
new provisions. It is quite unreasonable to expect sellers to know the rules of law in 
operation in every country from which orders emanate, or into which a buyer wishes 
to export. These are matters within the knowledge of the buyer/exporter. It would be 
different if the seller had taken active steps to penetrate a target market so that the seller 
could be said to be exporting into that market.168
At this point, it is necessary to consider what effect on these decisions the enactment 
of the present provisions may have. It is clear from their Report that the Law Com-
missions intended to reverse the decision in the first of the above three cases.169 They 
took the view, though not without some doubt, that the goods should always be fit 
for all their common purposes, and that the buyer should only be compelled to fall 
back on s. 14(3) when his purpose is an uncommon one. Section 14(2B)(a) is designed to

169	 See Final Report, Sale and Supply of Goods, para 3.36.

	152	 The duties of the seller
achieve this result by requiring fitness ‘for all the purposes for which goods of the kind 
in question are commonly supplied’. On the other hand, it is clear that the judges in the 
above two cases thought this would be an unreasonable result, and, where judges find 
this result unreasonable, it may still be possible in some cases for them to hold the par-
ticular purpose in question to be an uncommon one, so as to exclude liability under the 
new provisions. It seems likely that the judges in the Aswan Engineering case would have 
held that the particular use to which the pails were there subjected was very uncommon.
The word ‘commonly’, which was found in s. 14(6) and is found in s. 14(2B)(a), is of 
course, a very difficult word to apply because all depends on the standards of compar-
ison. Some uses, which may appear very uncommon in certain contexts, are perfectly 
common in a different context. To take an extreme example, the sale of unroadworthy 
cars for use as a source of spare parts is no doubt a relatively uncommon use in rela-
tion to the number of cars which are sold for ordinary use. But the sale of such cars as 
a source of spare parts is quite common if some different standard of comparison is 
used. Indeed, a thriving industry exists in which traders buy up old cars for this purpose, 
and sell spares to buyers, especially where the cars are out-of-date models. It is even 
more common where vintage cars are concerned.170 But under the present law there is no 
doubt that a car which was only fit for use as a source of parts would not be regarded as 
of unsatisfactory quality if it was sold as such, either expressly or by implication. The 
main reason for this is that regard must be had to the price when considering the ques-
tion of unsatisfactory quality. We return to this question of the price below.
But although, then, fitness for purpose is a main element in the present definition of 
‘unsatisfactory quality’ the law does not require the goods to be immediately usable. 
Many goods are sold which are not intended to be fit for immediate use. If it is in the 
contemplation of the parties that something should be done to the goods before they are 
used, they will be satisfactory even if they may be, in some sense, defective on delivery, so 
long as they will be satisfactory when they have been dealt with as contemplated.171 The 
Law Commissions gave a number of examples,172 such as, for instance, furniture sold in 
kit form which has to be assembled by the buyer, (or less commonly these days) or food 
sold in such a condition that it needs to be cooked (or to ripen) before it is edible.
There appear to be only two authorities bearing directly on this question. In Heil v 
Hedges173 it was held that pork, which may be harmful if eaten when not properly cooked, 
is not unmerchantable if it would have been harmless when well-cooked.174 By contrast, in 
Grant v Australian Knitting Mills175 it was held that new underpants (which contained an

171	 In Underwood v Burgh Castle Brick and Cement Syndicate [1922] 1 KB 343 Rowlatt J observed that the mere 
fact that a chattel such as a sideboard needed to be dismantled before delivery did not prevent the passing 
of property. This implies that he thought such goods were in a deliverable state, and thus conformed to the 
contract. This dictum is of relevance in relation to the many items of household furniture which are sold in 
‘flat packs’ – see below. By contrast, in that case, it was held that a condensing engine, which required much 
work and expense on the part of the seller to make it ready for delivery, was not in a deliverable state – as to 
‘deliverable state’ see p. 250.

excess of harmful chemicals) had to be fit for immediate wear and it was no defence for the 
seller to show that they would have been harmless if washed before use. Clearly, the test 
to be applied is to ask whether it is in the reasonable contemplation of the parties that the 
goods will be treated in the suggested manner before they are used.176
Safety
There was nothing in the 1979 Act requiring goods to be safe in order that they should 
be held to be merchantable, but there were a number of cases, mostly dealing with motor 
vehicles, which made it clear that goods which could not be safely used were not mer-
chantable.177 Section 14(2B) specifically mentions safety in para. (d) as one of the factors 
to be taken into account in deciding whether goods meet the present standard of ‘satis-
factory quality’ under s. 14(2).
Hidden defects
There remains, however, a serious problem about hidden defects which are only dan-
gerous because they are hidden. One thing at any rate has never been in doubt. Even 
before the 1973 statutory definition it was never suggested that goods were merchantable 
merely because they looked all right and so were literally saleable in the market. In order 
to decide whether they were merchantable it had to be assumed that any hidden defects 
were fully known.178 The same must be the case under the present provisions.
In most cases this is straightforward enough, but in some cases it leads to a problem. It 
is quite common for goods to be sold which may be dangerous if the buyer does not have 
some specific piece of information about the goods but which are not at all dangerous if 
the facts are fully known. Many medicines and drugs, for instance, are perfectly safe if 
certain simple precautions are taken (such as taking them with water, or not combining 
them with alcohol, or not exceeding a stated dosage) but which would be potentially 
dangerous if these simple precautions were not observed. Such drugs and medicines 
therefore nearly always come with adequate information printed on the container, or on 
some attached leaflet. Many of them, too, are only available on prescription,179 so that 
the patient will get the necessary warnings from his doctor.180 Clearly, goods supplied 
176	 But it is perhaps doubtful whether Heil v Hedges would be followed today; it seems to go too far to treat 
the failure to cook pork thoroughly as such an unusual thing as to break the causal chain and relieve the 
seller of responsibility: it would depend upon the extent to which, as a matter of fact, the dangers of 
undercooked pork were commonly known. Where more exotic foodstuffs are concerned, the duty of the 
seller must surely be to warn of dangers? As to the duty to warn see p. 156 below.
177	 See, e.g., Unity Finance v Mitford (1965) 109 Sol Jo 70 (strictly a case of fundamental breach); Lee v York

178	 Grant v Australian Knitting Mills Ltd [1936] AC 85, 100 per Lord Wright. Analogously, where the market 
value of defective goods is in issue, it must be assumed that buyer and seller know of the defects. The fact 
that the defects are hidden, and that a buyer in the market may therefore pay more than the goods are 
actually worth, does not establish that this is the fair market value: Jackson v Chrysler Acceptances Ltd 
[1978] RTR 474, 481.
179	 As to whether goods supplied on prescription under the National Health Service are ‘sold’, see p. 20 above.
180	 The warnings are standardised within the pharmaceutical trade – see John Richardson Computers v 
Flanders and Chemtec [1994] FSR 144. Failure to give such a standard warning would certainly amount to 
negligence on the part of the pharmacist.

	154	 The duties of the seller
with the necessary information would not be unsatisfactory merely because without it 
they might be dangerous or unsafe. But equally clearly, it would seem extraordinary if 
such goods were not regarded as unsatisfactory if they were sold without the necessary 
information.181
The problem extends far beyond the particular case of medicines and drugs. All sorts 
of goods are sold which require something to be done to them to make them fit for 
safe use. For instance, some electrical products require to have a three-pin plug attached, 
which is properly wired. If the product was supplied without informing the buyer that 
this was the case, the goods might well have been held unmerchantable, and would now 
surely be held unsatisfactory – although possibly this sort of knowledge might now in 
particular cases be attributed to the public as a whole. Any product which is supplied in 
a container which states, for example, ‘Warning: this product is dangerous for use unless 
such and such precautions are taken’, would normally be regarded as satisfactory with 
the warning, but very likely as unsatisfactory without it. And so on.
All this seems a plain matter of common sense. But there is unfortunately a major 
decision in the way (at least of some) of these common-sense conclusions. In Kendall v 
Lillico,182 which has already been referred to several times, the majority of the House of 
Lords held that the groundnut extract involved in that case was merchantable because it 
was fit for its most common use, namely for making into animal feedstuffs. Any feed-
stuff containing the extraction was perfectly fit for use for feeding to cattle and other 
animals, but it was not suitable for feeding to pheasant and partridge chicks. Had the 
matter stopped there the case would not have involved the particular problem under dis-
cussion. But it transpired that the animal feedstuffs made with the ground nut extraction 
were not merely unsuitable for feeding to pheasant and partridge chicks – they were 
actually dangerous or poisonous to pheasant and partridge chicks. The buyers who 
bought the groundnut extraction for compounding into animal feedstuffs would not 
have been injured or damaged if they had known of this fact because they could simply 
have labelled the feedstuffs produced with the extraction, ‘Warning: Not Suitable for 
Poultry’,183 or something of that kind. But the buyers did not know of the toxic quality 
of the extraction, and so the feedstuffs made with it were sold for general animal use, 
with disastrous results. A bare majority of the House of Lords held that these facts did 
not render the groundnut extraction of unmerchantable quality.
The ground for this decision is not entirely clear, but it seems to have been based 
on the following reasoning. The House applied the ‘acceptability’ test to decide the 
question of merchantability. This involved, they held, asking whether a buyer with full 
knowledge of all the facts would have accepted the goods in discharge of the contract 
181	 This is expressly stated by Lord Pearce (though dissenting) in Kendall v Lillico [1969] 2 AC 31, 119. It is 
also supported by the decision in Vacwell Engineering Co Ltd v BDH Chemicals [1969] 3 All ER 1681. And 
see Willis v FMC Machinery & Chemicals Ltd (1976) 68 DLR (3rd) 127. See also, however, Lem v Barotto 
Sports Ltd (1976) 69 DLR (3rd) 276, 290. This problem could arise as a result of the activities of parallel 
importers of pharmaceuticals, for instances have been observed where drugs have been supplied to patients 
with the instructions only in a foreign language. Subject to the point made in n. 179 above as to whether 
goods supplied on prescription are ‘sold’ such goods would appear not to be of satisfactory quality 
(see p. 184 et seq.).

183	 In ordinary usage ‘poultry’ does not include game birds, but the implication of the sixth holding in the case 
is that such a warning ought to have sufficed.

	
	 	
The duty to supply goods of the right quality 	 155
without a substantial abatement of the price. The answer to that, they reasoned, was 
patently yes because if the buyer had had full knowledge of all the facts he would have 
known that the goods were toxic to pheasant and partridge chicks, and would still have 
bought them, but have labelled his products as suggested above. This reasoning appears 
over-logical. Where the very nature of the defect in question depends on the fact that it 
is hidden and unknown, it seems absurd (the word is surely not too strong) to test the 
question of merchantability by asking whether a buyer with full knowledge of the facts 
would have accepted them. The whole problem arose from the very fact that the buyer 
did not know, and had no reason to know, all the facts. In circumstances like these it is 
precisely the fact that the condition is hidden which constitutes the danger, and therefore 
the defect in the goods. If this were not held to render the goods of unmerchantable qual-
ity, it would seem to have followed that a person who bought a piece of machinery (say a 
car) which was in a very dangerous state, but which could be rendered perfectly satisfac-
tory merely by tightening up a nut, could not complain that the goods were unmerchant-
able.184 If this was the case there was clearly something too narrow about the concept of 
‘merchantability’ – for what renders such a car dangerous is precisely the fact that the 
buyer will have no reason to know or even suspect that the car is in a dangerous condi-
tion. Under the current provisions, in answering the question whether a reasonable per-
son would regard the goods as ‘unsatisfactory’, it might appear that a similar approach 
might be adopted to that adopted by the House of Lords in Kendall v Lillico, by positing 
a reasonable person with full knowledge of the facts. Moreover, the specific reference to 
‘safety’ does not assist in reaching a more sensible conclusion because, in a fact situation 
like Kendall v Lillico, a buyer with full knowledge of the facts would regard the goods as 
safe, and therefore satisfactory. It is not clear, however, that the approach adopted by the 
House of Lords would be entirely inappropriate in commercial commodity contracts – again 
we have the problem of trying to draft a simple statutory provision which will cover all 
eventualities. Perhaps the solution in future in the case of commodity contracts will be 
to focus on the restriction of the right of rejection contained in the new s. 15A rather 
than to hold that no breach of s. 14(2) has occurred.
It is to be hoped, however, that this approach will not in general be adopted, and 
it is certainly highly unlikely that it would be in the case of unsafe goods, otherwise 
the Law Commissions’ purpose in spelling out a requirement of safety would largely be 
defeated.185
It was arguable that the majority decision on this point in Kendall v Lillico had been 
impliedly overruled by the test of merchantability in s. 14(6). But in the Aswan Engi-
neering case186 in 1986 the Court of Appeal followed the majority on this point, without 
specific reference to s. 14(6). Although Lloyd LJ seems to have preferred the reason-
ing of the minority of the House of Lords in Kendall v Lillico, the court declined to 
hold that the manufacturers of the pails should have warned that the pails would not 
be fit for stacking six high in conditions of extreme heat, on pain of their being found

contained in the 1973 Act, later re-enacted in the 1979 Act.

unmerchantable. But since the pails were held, in the event, to be fit for most of their 
common uses, this discussion would seem to have been obiter.
A final distinction must also perhaps be drawn between cases of hidden danger and 
cases of potential danger and at what point a potentially dangerous item becomes one 
that is unsatisfactory. This difficulty is illustrated by the decisions in SW Tubes Ltd v 
Owen Stuart Ltd187 and Medivance Instruments Ltd v Gaslane Pipework Services Ltd.188 
In SW Tubes a used machine saw for cutting cardboard was sold to the claimant without 
hand guards. The rapidly moving saw blade was therefore entirely unguarded when in 
use. It was common ground that the machine had not caused injury to current or past 
users when used without guards. That did not, however, preclude the goods from being 
unsafe and therefore not of satisfactory quality, such was the potential to cause injury.
This decision can be compared with the decision in Medivance which concerned the 
sale of a gas fired space heater for a factory. The space heater had mechanism so that it 
would cut out should the fans which moved the air through the heater failed but did not 
have a device that prevented overheating (and a subsequent fire) should the heater be 
obstructed, as it was. The buyers argued, amongst other things, that as a result of the 
absence of this device, it was unsafe and therefore not of satisfactory quality; essentially, 
that it was potentially unsafe. The Court of Appeal found for the sellers, holding that 
while such a modification would have been desirable, ultimately the fire caused by the 
heater was caused by the carelessness of the buyer. The issues seem to be likelihood of 
harm and the likelihood of extent to which the buyer has brought that harm about. 
Where there is a very real danger that the seller can do little to obviate, the goods will 
not be satisfactory, whereas a potential danger which the sellers can easily mitigate will 
not render the good unsatisfactory.
Knowledge, warnings, instructions, etc.
The problem discussed in the last section extends beyond questions of safety and hidden 
defects. Many products require to be used in a particular manner, or under specified 
conditions, if they are to work effectively, or at all. Garden weed-killer, for instance, may 
have to be applied when the weather is not wet and garden fertiliser when it is.189 Prod-
ucts of this kind which are supplied without any or without adequate instructions may 
be held unsatisfactory, while if they are supplied with adequate instructions they will be 
perfectly satisfactory.190
A related problem concerns minor defects which are very easily rectifiable. Many 
goods, sometimes expensive and high quality goods, may be totally unusable because 
of some minor defect which can be easily corrected once the source of the trouble is 
known. A car sold, for instance, with a missing battery lead would simply be unusable, 
and in the Bernstein191 case Rougier J suggested that this would, strictly speaking, render

The duty to supply goods of the right quality 	 157
the car unmerchantable under the statutory definition in s. 14(6).192 Yet if the ‘accepta-
bility’ test relied on by the House of Lords in Kendall v Lillico were applied in the same 
way as was done in that case, the answer might well have been different. More generally, 
Rougier J insisted that even a very minor defect which could easily be discovered and put 
right would often render a new car unmerchantable. This holding appears inconsistent 
with the reasoning of the majority in Kendall v Lillico. The specific reference to ‘free-
dom from minor defects’ in s. 14(2B)(c) really only makes sense on the basis that the new 
Act is in accordance with the views of Rougier J and with the Law Commissions’ similar 
views.193 However, in Eagan v Motor Services (Bath) Ltd,194 where the complaint was that 
the rear wheel of the car sold to the complainant was set out of specification, Smith LJ 
observed:
[the claimant’s counsel] argued that a buyer should be entitled to reject the car because, under 
section 14(2B)(c), goods may be of unsatisfactory quality because of minor defects. That I 
accept is so, but the overall test of whether goods are of satisfactory quality is to be found 
in section 14(2A) . . . this is an objective test and is a matter of judgment for the judge on the 
individual facts of the case.195
This seems contrary to Rougier J’s view, and consistent with the point made above. 
Again, however, in the case of commodity contracts, it may be that the Kendall v Lillico 
view makes some sense,196 but in a case of this sort, where the goods have slight defects, 
the limitation on the right of rejection in the new s. 15A ought to render the issue of 
rejection for slight defects a point only of academic interest.
The standard of fitness for use
As we have seen, the law required that, in order to be merchantable, the goods had to 
be fit for their use (or one of their common uses), and the 1994 Act requires fitness for 
all the purposes for which goods of the kind in question are commonly supplied. But 
standards of fitness for use are variable. The law does not require the goods to be per-
fectly fit for use. They are to be as fit for use as ‘it is reasonable to expect’ having regard 
to the various factors enumerated in the statutory definition. This appears to mean that 
goods may be satisfactory even though they are in some sense defective. For example, a 
second-hand car may be satisfactory, so long as it is reasonably fit for use, even though 
it is by no means in perfect condition.197 But second-hand goods cause special difficulties 
in this connection, and they are better dealt with at a later point.
192	 See, however, Millars of Falkirk v Turpie 1976 SLT (Notes) 66.
193	 Final Report, para. 3.34. Moreover, all kinds of warning notices, labels, instructions, etc., which render 
goods perfectly safe and satisfactory would then, apparently, cease to be necessary. The leading case on 
warnings is Wormell v RHM Agriculture (East) Ltd [1987] 1 WLR 1091, which was a case under s. 14(3) 
and is therefore dealt with at p. 184 below.

Centre 1997 SLT (Sh Ct) 102.

	158	 The duties of the seller
So far as other goods are concerned, it must be admitted that it goes against the 
current trend of opinion to suggest that defective goods can be satisfactory (unmerchant-
able under the former provisions). Indeed, it never seems to have been doubted under the 
original Sale of Goods Act that actually defective goods were unmerchantable. In the 
case of manufactured goods, quite trivial defects were occasionally held to render goods 
unmerchantable.198 The reason for this very strict approach was quite simple. In the case 
of manufactured goods it was generally felt that the buyer was entitled to the goods in 
perfect condition. Any defect requiring any expenditure of money or time to put right 
naturally detracted from the buyer’s purchase; moreover, it must be remembered that 
this was not simply something which went to the right of rejection. The buyer’s remedy 
even in damages depended upon his right to goods of merchantable quality in many 
circumstances.
It seems clear that the Law Commissions intended to extend the responsibility of the 
seller with respect to these matters by the new test of ‘satisfactory quality’ in s. 14(2A) 
and (2B). In particular, s. 14(2B)(c) requires the goods to be free from minor defects, 
which at first sight seems to eliminate the possibility that the seller can supply goods 
which are ‘far from perfect’. Yet in practice this may not make much difference because 
(as we shall see more fully below) the overriding test under the new section is the require-
ment that goods are of ‘satisfactory quality’ in s. 14(2A). The specific matters listed in 
s. 14(2B) are merely declared to be ‘aspects of the quality of goods’ – they are not them-
selves absolute requirements. So far as fitness for purpose is concerned, therefore, it can-
not be said that even the new section will require the goods to be perfectly fit. Goods are 
of satisfactory quality if they meet the standard that a reasonable person would regard 
as satisfactory.
Under the old law, the court seems occasionally to have narrowed the scope of the 
merchantability warranty in order to prevent a buyer seizing on a minor defect as a pre-
text for avoiding what had turned out to be a bad bargain. In the Cehave case,199 the court  
was prepared to find the goods (citrus pulp pellets for animal feed) to be merchantable 
although part of the cargo had been damaged while at sea. Roskill LJ admitted that the 
goods were ‘far from perfect’, but nevertheless held that they were merchantable. How-
ever, it might be dangerous to read too much into this decision; the facts were very pecu-
liar, and the merits were all on the seller’s side. Moreover, a buyer had actually bought 
the goods (at a much reduced price) when they were publicly sold after the original buyer 
had rejected them, and passed them on to the original buyers who, in fact, used them 
without complaint for the purpose for which they were wanted, that is compounding 
into animal feeding stuff. In the circumstances it may well be that even though the goods 
were not in perfect condition, it was legitimate to find that a reasonable buyer, acting 
reasonably, could have accepted the goods as of merchantable quality. Moreover, there 
was an express term that the goods should be of ‘good quality’ and this term was held 
to have been broken. So perhaps the existence of this term justified the court in placing 
an unusual significance on the more normal meaning of merchantable quality. As noted

The duty to supply goods of the right quality 	 159
above, under the 1994 Act it would be possible for the court to attain the result it wanted 
in similar circumstances, that is to deny the buyer the right to reject under the new s. 
15A. Accordingly, if the same facts were to occur today, a court might find that s. 14(2) 
had been broken, but that the buyer was not entitled to reject.
Non-functional aspects of quality
As we have seen, the former law concentrated heavily on the fitness for purpose test 
in asking whether the goods were merchantable, and fitness for all purposes for which 
goods of the kind are commonly supplied is also an aspect of the quality of the goods 
which must be taken into account under the new provisions. But many goods, suffer 
from defects which do not necessarily affect their ordinary usability, or general fitness 
for purpose. For example, they may be delivered scratched, dented, discoloured or 
dirty; they may have minor parts missing; ancillary parts may not work well, or may 
not be fit for their purpose even though the goods as a whole may be reasonably fit for 
use and so on.
Before the 1973 statutory definition was enacted these sorts of defects were gen-
erally considered sufficient to render the goods unmerchantable because the test of 
merchantability applied at that time was, arguably, wider than the statutory test. In 
particular, the majority of the House of Lords in Kendall v Lillico200 appears to have 
settled for an ‘acceptability’ test which was not very different from that included in the 
Law Commissions’ original draft of s. 14(2A). This test stemmed from the definition 
of merchantable quality given by Farwell LJ in Bristol Tramways Co Ltd v Fiat Motors 
Ltd,201 as amplified by Dixon CJ in the Australian High Court in the case of Australian 
Knitting Mills Ltd v Grant.202 It was generally taken to mean that even non-functional 
defects could be held to render the goods unmerchantable, and there was at least one 
specific Court of Appeal authority to this effect, in which it had been held that dented 
and scratched goods were unmerchantable, although they could have been put right by 
polishing.203
After the 1973 definition was enacted, fears were expressed in some quarters that the 
old law had actually been weakened, and that a buyer could no longer complain that 
the goods were unmerchantable merely because they suffered from minor non-functional 
defects. The basis for these fears appears to have been that many complicated manu-
factured goods like cars must be expected to have minor teething problems and that 
defects of this kind did not render goods unmerchantable. If a car was broadly fit for its 
purpose, it was suggested, the fact that minor defects might exist did not, in the words 
of this definition, prevent the goods from being ‘as fit for the purpose or purposes for 
which goods of that kind are commonly bought as it is reasonable to expect’.204

	160	 The duties of the seller
These fears never seemed very realistic,205 and they were largely put to rest by the 
Court of Appeal decision in Rogers v Parish (Scarborough) Ltd.206 In this case, the buyer 
had bought a new Range Rover at a cost exceeding £16,000, but the vehicle had many 
minor defects such as deterioration of the oil seals and defects in the engine and gear 
box which made it excessively noisy and caused misfiring at all speeds. There were also 
many minor defects in the bodywork. Despite numerous attempts to repair it by the 
dealers, these defects remained after six months’ use. It was held that the vehicle was not 
merchantable. It was not enough, insisted the Court of Appeal, that the vehicle could 
still be driven on the road. Mustill LJ brought the non-functional aspects of what the 
buyer was entitled to expect within the statutory definition by reading it broadly:
Starting with the purpose for which ‘goods of that kind’ are commonly bought, one would 
include in respect of any passenger vehicle not merely the buyer’s purpose of driving the 
car from one place to another but of doing so with the appropriate degree of comfort, ease 
of handling and reliability and, one may add, of pride in the vehicle’s outward and interior 
appearance.207
After that, matters were taken a stage further by the Court of Appeal in Shine v  
General Guarantee Corpn Ltd208 where a car which had been submerged in water and 
had been an insurance ‘write-off’ was held not to be merchantable, despite the fact that 
no specific defect or unroadworthiness was alleged. Here the mere fact of the prior 
accident was enough to reduce the market value of the goods very significantly (as was 
proved), presumably because the market judges that such an accident may have an effect 
on the long-run reliability and wear of the vehicle concerned. So the mere fact of such an 
accident having happened could render a car unmerchantable, at any rate, unless the fact 
were disclosed sufficiently to bring into play s. 14(2)(a). What the court emphasised here 
were the buyer’s reasonable expectations as having a bearing on merchantability. The 
outcome would, no doubt, be the same under the present provisions.
Another case of the purchase of a new car in which detailed consideration was given 
to the requirements of the former law with regard to merchantability was Bernstein v 
Pamson Motors (Golders Green) Ltd.209 The plaintiff here bought a new car for just 
under £8,000, but the car broke down within three weeks, on a motorway, after doing 
only 140 miles. Investigation revealed that a very minor defect (the presence of a piece 
of sealant in the lubricating system) had caused the breakdown, but unfortunately this 
minor defect had caused extensive damage because it had completely blocked the oil 
supply, causing the camshaft to seize up. Three main factors appear to have weighed 
with Rougier J in holding that the car was unmerchantable. First, there was the nature 
and consequences of the defect. Here the defect was minor, but the consequences very 
serious – indeed they could have been even more serious had the plaintiff not stopped in 
time. Secondly, the main requirements of a merchantable car were that it should be capa-
ble of being driven, and that it should be safe (though he also regarded cosmetic factors

as relevant). This car was not safe.210 A third factor was how easy it was to remedy the 
defect once the trouble occurred. Here the repairs took several days and cost over £700 
although the makers claimed that the car was then as good as new again. Another factor 
which was regarded by the judge as less important was that the defect might have been 
easily discovered. Even missing battery leads, he suggested, would render a car unmer-
chantable until they were replaced.
The present s. 14(2), as we have suggested, confirms the result of these decisions, for 
it lists freedom from minor defects among the aspects of the quality of the goods which 
a court must consider in determining whether or not they are of satisfactory quality. It 
must be noted, however, that the present legislation appears largely to have been driven 
by concerns about mass-produced manufactured goods. In the case of natural products 
such as fruit and vegetables, freedom from minor defects may be impossible to achieve. 
It is in such cases that the qualifying words in s. 14(2B)(c) ‘in appropriate cases’ will be 
important.211 Moreover, this issue would be most likely to crop up in the commercial 
context, and the modification of the right of rejection in the new s. 15A would also be 
important.
The Sale and Supply of Goods Act 1994: ‘reasonably satisfactory’
The Law Commissions (which began their inquiry before the decisions concerning cars 
discussed above) were concerned that the 1973 statutory definition concentrated too 
much on fitness for purpose and failed to take account of some of the non-functional 
aspects of merchantability. Hence their Report proposed to replace the term ‘merchanta-
ble quality’ with ‘acceptable quality’, and in effect to adopt a test of ‘reasonable accepta-
bility’, which was rather similar to the test often widely used in the cases before 1973. 
In addition, the list of specific matters referred to in s. 14(2B) is intended to set at rest 
any lingering doubts about non-functional defects. Clearly, under this provision, minor 
dents, scratches and other non-functional imperfections may be sufficient to render the 
goods of unacceptable quality under the new statutory implied condition. As noted 
above, the government accepted the recommendations, subject to substituting a require-
ment that goods should be of ‘satisfactory quality’ for the recommended requirement 
that they be of ‘acceptable quality’, and the 1994 Act, which was the result of a private 
member’s Bill, adopts the government’s formulation.
Nevertheless, as already suggested, the overriding test will be that of satisfactory 
quality laid down in s. 14(2A), and the matters listed in (2B) will only be taken account 
of in applying that overriding requirement. So minor defects (para. (c)) or blemishes of 
appearance and finish (para. (b)) will only render the goods unsatisfactory if a reason-
able person would regard them as rendering them unsatisfactory, having regard to the 
210	 See also Lamarra v Capital Bank plc 2007 SC 95: top of range vehicle with several minor cosmetic defects 
and one other not minor (defective differential) held unsatisfactory although defects remediable under 
express warranty.
211	 ‘The following (among other things) are in appropriate cases aspects of the quality of goods— (c) freedom 
from minor defects . . .’ For another possible example (an individually produced item) see the Scottish 
sheriff court case of Bon Accord Granite Ltd v Buchan 2005 GWD 28-531 (Sheriff K. M. Stewart), holding a 
gravestone with streaks and uneven density of colour satisfactory since there were no other defects and the 
difficulties with the colouring were readily capable of rectification.

	162	 The duties of the seller
price and other circumstances. Manifestly, in some cases, such as on the purchase of a 
second-hand car of some age, such blemishes are almost certain to be present and no 
reasonable buyer would regard them as making the car unsatisfactory.212
In general it does not seem likely that the changes effected by the 1994 Act will make 
much difference to the law, except for a few points specifically mentioned in s. 14(2B), 
and dealt with separately in this section. The concept of ‘satisfactory quality’, it must 
be said, has even less genuine meaning than the concept of ‘merchantable quality’, and 
must be fleshed out by the case law in varying circumstances, and unfortunately, as pre-
viously suggested, the effect of the present provisions could be to sever this country from 
the useful lines of authority which have developed in other common law jurisdictions on 
the meaning of ‘merchantability’.213 Worse still, for many people the word ‘satisfactory’ 
implies a fairly mediocre standard, though it is clearly intended that many minor defects 
in goods, both under the present law and under the matters specifically listed in s. 14(2B), 
will still justify rejection, even though a reasonable buyer would often accept the goods 
and put up with the defects – perhaps claiming damages, and perhaps often not even 
doing that.214 Indeed, even the buyer in the particular case may accept the goods, and 
may be acting reasonably in doing so, but this only deprives him of his right to reject, 
not of his right to claim damages for breach of the implied term as to quality. This is 
why it was suggested earlier that the Act should not have any effect on the cases where it 
has been held that the seller is liable even though he has supplied exactly what the buyer 
ordered.215 We must now look at some specific aspects of the quality of the goods which 
may affect the application of the new provisions.
Durability
There was some controversy as to whether the seller’s duty to supply merchantable 
goods implied that the goods must continue to be satisfactory for any particular length 
of time. In Mash and Murrell v Joseph I Emmanuel,216 sellers in Cyprus sold potatoes 
c.&f. Liverpool. The potatoes, though sound when loaded, were rotten by the time the 
ship arrived, and it was held by Diplock J that the sellers were liable under s. 14(2) on the 
ground that in such a contract the goods must be loaded in ‘such a state that they could 
endure the normal journey and be in a merchantable condition on arrival’.217
On the face of it this seems a reasonable decision. Indeed, it seemed inherent in the 
concept of merchantability that the goods would remain in a satisfactory condition 
for a reasonable length of time according to the circumstances of the contract and the 
nature of the goods. For example, if in George Wills & Co Ltd v Davids Pty Ltd,218 
212	 See Thain v Anniesland Trade Centre 1997 SLT (Sh Ct) 102.
213	 Although, as noted above, the departure appears to be in name only, in Medivance Instruments Ltd v 
Gaslane Pipework Services Ltd [2002] EWCA Civ 500 the leading judge still refers to ‘merchantable quality’ 
when referring to the case at hand.

discussed below, the sellers had supplied beetroot canned in vinegar with a life of only 
a few weeks, while the normal life of beetroot canned in vinegar was 12 months, there 
seems no doubt that the goods would have been unmerchantable. Despite doubts cast 
on Diplock J’s decision in some cases,219 the House of Lords (in a speech delivered 
by Lord Diplock) has since unanimously affirmed that the implied condition under 
s. 14(3) of reasonable fitness for purpose is a warranty that the goods will continue 
to be fit for a reasonable time.220 At all events, the new provisions seem to put the 
matter beyond doubt, as ‘durability’ is specifically mentioned in s. 14(2B)(e) as one 
of the aspects of the quality of the goods to which regard is to be had. It must also 
be noted that cases such as Mash & Murrell involved f.o.b. and c.i.f. contracts where 
risk in general passes to the buyer on loading. If the bill of lading states that the goods 
were ‘shipped in apparent good order and condition’, the assumption will tend to be 
that the deterioration which occurred was due to the hazards of transit, the risks of 
which are the buyer’s. This indeed was what turned out to be the case in Mash & 
Murrell itself.221 In short, the buyer’s decision to accept or reject will, as a matter of 
practicality, often be determined by what is said in the bill of lading. In VAI Industries 
(UK) Ltd v Bostock & Bramley Org,222 where machinery was delivered f.o.b. with an 
express warranty, the majority of the Court of Appeal held that a breach of this war-
ranty occurred at the time of delivery, not at the time the breach was discovered.223
Of course, what is a reasonable time during which the goods must remain satisfactory 
will be a question of fact which will depend on the nature of the goods and the circum-
stances of the case, including, no doubt, the price paid. High-quality carpets sold at a price 
commensurate with their quality can be expected to last longer than cheaper carpeting 
sold at a low price. It must also be appreciated that the seller’s continuing obligation does 
not mean that the goods must remain of the same quality or in the same condition for any 
length of time, nor even that they must remain, strictly speaking, at the same standard 
of ‘satisfactory quality’ as they were at the time of delivery. Clearly, very few goods will 
remain in the same condition after delivery and especially after use, and many of them may 
rapidly cease to be of satisfactory quality in the relevant sense.224 Even brand new goods 
will, soon after delivery, be second-hand goods, and if delivered in that condition would 
hardly be regarded as satisfactory when a new price has been paid. But what is required is 
that the goods, when delivered, should have the capacity to remain reasonably fit for the 
purpose, and retain their non-functional attributes, for a reasonable time. It must also be 
borne in mind that the fact that goods break down within a short time of purchase may be 
evidence that they were defective at the time of the sale.225

	164	 The duties of the seller
Relevance of the price
The price at which goods are sold is often relevant in deciding what quality the buyer 
is entitled to expect. This was the case under the former provisions,226 and is the case 
under the 1994 Act, which again expressly mentions price.227 Clearly, goods which 
are commonly sold for a variety of purposes are also commonly sold at a variety of 
prices. And this is not just because market prices may vary, but because some uses may 
require goods of better quality, and goods fit for those purposes may therefore com-
mand a premium. The new provisions require fitness for all purposes for which goods 
of the kind in question are commonly sold. The words ‘kind in question’ are obviously 
crucial. So, in the example of the wrecked car sold as a source of spares, one would 
obviously expect the price to be very much lower than if the car was sold as a road-
worthy vehicle for ordinary road use. Hence if the price was a normal sort of price for 
a roadworthy vehicle of that type, the vehicle clearly would be unsatisfactory if it was 
not in fact roadworthy.228 So the price is an important indicator as to what the buyer 
could reasonably expect.
As the Sheriff Principal said in Thain v Anniesland Trade Centre,229 where a 
second-hand car with 80,000 miles in the odometer developed a fault in the gearbox 
after two weeks’ use:
People who buy second-hand cars get them at less than their original price in a large part 
because second-hand cars have attached to them an increased risk of expensive repairs. The 
price of the Renault, £2,995, was considered reasonable because there was the risk of expensive 
repairs attached to the Renault.
In several large cities there are now car warehouses selling off what is presumably ex-car-
hire company stock, which has reached its 10,000-mile or six-month ceiling (or what-
ever). These establishments offer the vehicles at significantly lower prices than the prices 
of equivalent vehicles sold by motor dealers. It would appear, however, that the car ware-
houses would be liable on the quality warranties in the same way as ordinary motor 
dealers, and that the price at which the goods are sold would not be a relevant considera-
tion. This situation is distinguishable from that in Thain v Anniesland Trade Centre230 in 
that the buyer’s expectations of a reasonably new, low mileage car would be significantly 
different from those of a high mileage vehicle sold at a low price. It seems that at least 
some of these establishments offer title and repair warranty insurance at extra cost. This 
is, in effect, equivalent to the extended warranty offered with some types of electrical 
goods.231 Although the availability of an extended warranty was considered relevant in 
Thain v Anniesland Trade Centre,232 the case is almost certainly wrong on this point.

The duty to supply goods of the right quality 	 165
If the transaction was characterised as being about the sale of a ‘collector’s car’, the 
fact that it was unroadworthy might not render it unsatisfactory.233 In short, in border-
line cases of this sort, the way in which the court characterises the deal will be crucial. To 
some extent, this may appear to violate the traditional English canon that the adequacy 
of consideration is irrelevant, but it was plain that this principle was virtually obsolete in 
cases concerning merchantable quality, and the same must apply in relation to the pres-
ent provisions. The implications of the present law are that a buyer is entitled to value 
for money,234 rather as in pre-1893 Scots law a fair price demanded a fair article.235 On 
the other hand, in Harlingdon & Leinster Ltd v Christopher Hull Fine Art Ltd, the facts 
of which were given above,236 it was held that the fact that a painting was not the work 
of the artist by whom it appeared to have been painted did not make it unmerchantable, 
even though its value as a forgery was much lower than as the genuine article. The find-
ing on the s. 13 issue was crucial to this determination. The Court of Appeal did not, 
however, endorse the judge’s observation that the words ‘merchantable quality’ related 
to anything beyond the physical qualities of the goods sold.
It is also clear from the earlier case law, which surely remains relevant for this pur-
pose, that a buyer cannot complain that the goods are unsatisfactory merely because 
he has paid slightly over the odds for them. Under the case law pre-dating the statutory 
definition in s. 14(6) introduced by the 1973 Act it was often said that ‘merchantable’ 
meant, in effect, ‘commercially saleable’ but of course goods may be commercially sale-
able though only at a discount off the contract price. In Australian Knitting Mills Ltd v 
Grant,237 Dixon CJ had adopted a slightly different test for deciding whether goods were 
merchantable. According to this test, the goods:
. . . should be in such a state that a buyer, fully acquainted with the facts . . . would buy them 
without abatement of the price obtainable for such goods if in reasonable sound order and 
condition and without special terms.
This seems to have been the first time that the price was explicitly considered as a rel-
evant factor in deciding on merchantability, and Dixon CJ’s opinion was later accepted, 
though with qualifications, by the House of Lords. In B S Brown & Son Ltd v Craiks 
Ltd238 buyers ordered a quantity of cloth from the seller manufacturers. The sellers of the 
cloth thought it was wanted for industrial purposes but the buyers wanted it for making 
dresses, for which it proved unsuitable. The buyers had not made known their purpose to 
the sellers and thus they failed in their claim under s. 14(1) (now s. 14(3)). The contract 
price was 36.25d. per yard, which was higher than would normally have been paid for 
industrial cloth but not substantially higher. In fact, the sellers resold some of the cloth 
at 30d. per yard. The buyers’ claim for damages on the ground that the cloth was unmer-
chantable was rejected by the House of Lords. The cloth was still commercially saleable 
for industrial purposes although at a slightly lower price. It was held that the reference to

price in the test of merchantability stated by Dixon CJ in Grant’s case239 was too rigidly 
put. Goods could not be said to be unmerchantable merely because they were not com-
mercially saleable at the contract price but only at a slightly lower price. They would not 
be unmerchantable unless they could only be resold at a substantially lower price. In this 
case the buyers had resold some of the cloth (after they had found that it was unsuitable) 
for 15d. per yard, but it was found that they had not obtained the best market price rea-
sonably obtainable in so doing. Some of the judges clearly thought that if this had been 
the real market value of the goods, then the difference in price would have been so great 
as to render them unmerchantable.
An Australian decision of 1921 illustrates a situation where the price difference 
was substantial enough to produce this result. In H Beecham & Co Pty Ltd v Francis 
­Howard & Co Pty Ltd,240 the defendants bought spruce timber for piano-making from 
the plaintiffs. The defendants themselves selected the timber from the plaintiffs’ stock 
but later much of it was found to be affected by dry rot, not observable on reasonable 
external examination. The sellers argued that the timber was merchantable because it 
was still saleable as timber for making boxes, which was in fact one of the uses to which 
spruce timber was commonly put. But the buyer paid 80 shillings per hundred feet of 
timber while spruce timber for box-making was only worth 30 shillings per hundred feet. 
It was held that the timber was not merchantable under the contract description because 
‘no businessman, having a contract to buy spruce timber whether for resale or for pur-
poses of manufacture would think for a moment of accepting this timber, its condition 
being known, without a very large reduction upon current market prices’.
In considering the decision in B S Brown v Craiks,241 a word of caution may be desir-
able. It seems probable that this decision was not intended to apply to goods which are 
actually defective. Before 1973, it never seems to have been doubted that even trifling 
defects rendered goods unmerchantable,242 although they may in fact still be commer-
cially saleable at a price not much lower than the contract price. It is not thought that the 
House of Lords intended to cast any doubt on this proposition, and this may explain why 
in this case Lord Reid suggested that ‘it is [not] possible to frame, except in the vaguest 
terms, a definition of merchantable quality which can apply to every kind of case’.243 As 
we have seen, despite some doubts, it seemed clear that the statutory definition in s. 14(6) 
did not affect the law on this point. Even relatively minor matters of appearance, finish 
and other non-functional attributes, could render goods unmerchantable, although obvi-
ously some of them might be so minor that they would not substantially affect the price 
even if known to the buyer at the time of purchase. The present provisions seem to put 
the matter beyond doubt, and should have the effect that in a case such as Millars of 
Falkirk v Turpie244 the goods would not be held to be of satisfactory quality.245

The duty to supply goods of the right quality 	 167
There are some kinds of goods in which the quality is almost infinitely variable, and 
in which it would seem that compliance with the requirements of merchantability, or the 
present requirement of satisfactory quality, may depend almost entirely on the price. For 
example, if a person buys minced beef and is supplied with minced beef with a 30 per 
cent fat content, proof that most minced beef has a lower fat content does not necessar-
ily mean that the goods are not of satisfactory quality. If the price is commensurate with 
the quality in fact supplied, the goods will be satisfactory.246 Indeed, there would have to 
be a substantial disparity between the price appropriate to the quality actually supplied 
and the price charged before it could be said that the goods were unsatisfactory.
It must be added that the present provisions may cause some problems in this connec-
tion, which do not appear to have been anticipated by the Law Commissions. So long as 
the goods only had to be suitable for some of the purposes for which such goods were 
commonly bought, it did not matter that such goods sold for other purposes would have 
cost much more. But now that the present Act requires the goods to be fit for all the pur-
poses for which such goods are commonly bought, the question of price will, presum-
ably, become even more critical. Suppose, to take a hypothetical example, based on the 
Australian Beecham case discussed above, that a seller sells spruce wood for box-making 
at a price appropriate to that use. It would obviously be absurd for the buyer to be 
allowed to contend that because spruce wood is also often sold for piano-making, there-
fore the wood he has bought is unmerchantable unless fit for that purpose also. Clearly, 
the court would have to interpret the present Act in such a way as to avoid this result, 
and this could perhaps be done by holding that in these circumstances spruce wood for 
box-making and spruce wood for piano-making are simply not goods of the same kind 
within the meaning of the new s. 14(2B)(a).
Second-hand goods
As we have already seen, there is nothing in the statutory provisions to exclude their 
application to second-hand goods, and they have often been applied to such goods, both 
before and after the 1973 legislation. Again, there is nothing in the present Act to alter 
this result.
But although second-hand goods have to be satisfactory, no less than new goods, it 
is clear that nobody can expect second-hand goods at a lower price to be as good as 
new goods at a higher price.247 Under the original law, and before the 1973 statutory 
definition was enacted, the question arose occasionally with motor vehicles, and there 
was a tendency then to hold that the requirement of merchantability, as it applied to 
second-hand vehicles, meant that the vehicle must at least be safe and roadworthy. But 
in Business Appliances Specialists Ltd v Nationwide Credit Corpn Ltd,248 the Court of 
Appeal rejected this approach. The requirement of merchantability extended to other 
246	 See Goldup v John Manson Ltd [1981] 3 All ER 257, a case under the Food and Drugs legislation (see now 
the Food Safety Act 1990).

12 NIJB 1 (second-hand car should be ‘reliable and capable of giving good service and fair performance’), 
but see observations at p. 164 above.

	168	 The duties of the seller
matters besides safety and roadworthiness. They stressed that the statutory definition 
of merchantability applied also to the case of second-hand goods. Indeed, the test to be 
applied was precisely the same as the test to be applied for new vehicles, as discussed in 
Rogers v Parish (Scarborough) Ltd.249 The question always was whether the goods were 
as fit for their purpose as it was reasonable to expect. But, of course, it was also abun-
dantly clear that what it was reasonable to expect would differ according to the price, 
and having regard to the fact that the goods were second-hand.
A few illustrations from the case law under the former provisions reveal some var-
iation of judicial attitudes.250 Crowther v Shannon Motor Co251 is, perhaps, the most 
favourable decision from the buyer’s point of view. In this case the buyer bought a 
second-hand Jaguar which had done over 82,000 miles for the (at that time) fairly mod-
est price of £390. The engine seized up after the buyer had done a further 2,000 miles 
in the space of three weeks; a reconditioned engine had to be fitted to the car. It was 
held that a breach of s. 14 had been committed because of evidence from the former 
owner (who had sold it to the defendants) that the engine was ‘clapped out’ when he 
sold them the car. An award of no less than £460 in damages was upheld. The plaintiff 
thus, in effect, obtained a Jaguar with a clapped-out engine for nothing and, in addition, 
received £70 towards the price of the new engine.
In Bartlett v Sydney Marcus Ltd,252 the plaintiff bought a second-hand car from the 
defendant dealers for £950. The dealers informed the plaintiff that the clutch was defec-
tive and they offered either to put it right and sell it at £975 or to leave the buyer to put it 
right and sell for £950. The buyer chose the latter alternative, but when he came to have 
the clutch repaired the defect was found to be more serious than expected and the repair 
cost him £84. The Court of Appeal held that the car was not unmerchantable merely 
because the defects proved more serious than expected. There were suggestions in this 
case that a car which would go, even though not perfectly, might still be merchantable, 
but it seems clear that these remarks must be confined to the case of second-hand cars. 
There can, it is thought, be no doubt that if a new car were sold with a defective clutch, 
the car would be properly said to be unsatisfactory (formerly, unmerchantable). But in 
this case the car was sold as second-hand with a defective clutch. Under that description, 
the car could not be said to be unmerchantable merely because the defect proved more 
serious than expected. Equally, under the present provisions, it could not be said to be 
unsatisfactory.
Two decisions of the Court of Appeal after the statutory definition of merchantabi-
lity was enacted by the 1973 Act continue to show some variation of judicial attitude. 
In Business Appliances Specialists Ltd v Nationwide Credit Corpn Ltd,253 the plaintiff 
bought a second-hand Mercedes, which had done some 37,000 miles, for £14,850. After 
a few months, and only 800 miles, serious wear in the valves, valve guides and oil seals 
appeared, and repairs were required costing £635. Expert evidence was produced to the 
249	 [1987] QB 933.
250	 Some of these illustrations are actually drawn from cases in which s. 14(3) was applied rather than s. 14(2) 
but, as already noted, there is often an overlap between these subsections, and the cases may be equally 
relevant to both subsections.

effect that such wear was very unusual on a Mercedes of that age and mileage. Never-
theless, it was held that there was no breach of the requirement of merchantability.254 
Second-hand cars, it was said, must be expected to have some defects, and some ordi-
nary wear and tear. It was a matter of degree whether the defects exceeded the expecta-
tions of the reasonable buyer. Yet this was clearly a very expensive car of extremely high 
quality. The case is perhaps borderline.
In Shine v General Guarantee Corpn Ltd,255 the car turned out to have been submerged  
in water for 24 hours, and had been an insurance company ‘write-off’. Although there 
were no specific defects alleged, and the car appeared to be generally usable, this was 
enough to persuade the Court of Appeal that the car was unmerchantable. Perhaps 
the decisive fact here was that a dealer gave evidence that, if the facts had been fully 
known, the car would have been worth £1,000 less than the price. So, clearly the buyer 
had hardly got ‘value for money’, and that was apparently enough to show a breach of 
the subsection.256
The present provisions shed no light on the rightness or wrongness of these decisions, 
and if the same fact situations were to fall to be decided under them, the outcomes would 
no doubt be the same. In Thain v Anniesland Trade Centre,257 decided after the 1994 
changes, the pursuer purchased for £2,995 a second-hand Renault 19, which was about 
five years old and had done about 80,000 miles. After two weeks’ use, the car developed a 
gearbox fault which could not be sorted economically, and the car was written off. It was 
held to be sufficient that the car was fit for initial use, Crowther being distinguished on 
the ground that the defect existed at the time of sale, and that the purchaser assumed the 
risk that a defect might emerge at any time, given the age and mileage of the car. Dura-
bility was not a quality reasonably to be expected of a second-hand car.
Satisfactory quality and differing grades of quality
It is perhaps surprising how little authority there appears to have been on the relation-
ship of the requirement of merchantability under the former provisions258 to the possi-
bility of different grades of quality. Obviously many goods are sold in different grades 
of quality, and no doubt the price is normally commensurate with the particular quality 
sold. And we have seen that the price may well be relevant in deciding whether the goods 
are of satisfactory quality in any given case. But the price is not everything, and it might 
seem that a requirement of ‘satisfactory quality’ would have some bearing on the par-
ticular grade of quality which the buyer is entitled to receive. For instance, under the 
American Uniform Commercial Code the requirement of merchantable quality means, 
in the case of fungible goods, that the buyer is entitled to receive goods at least of ‘fair 
average quality’ within the contract description.259 But it does not seem that the Sale of

	170	 The duties of the seller
Goods Act requires the goods to be of any particular grade of quality. The new provi-
sions do not appear to have any bearing on this problem at all.
The term ‘satisfactory’, like its predecessor ‘merchantable’, does not necessarily 
connote that the goods are of any specific grade or quality. As was said by Salmond J in 
the New Zealand case of Taylor v Combined Buyers Ltd:260
The term ‘merchantable’ does not mean of good, or fair, or average quality. Goods may be 
of inferior or even bad quality but yet fulfil the legal requirement of merchantable quality. 
For goods may be in the market in any grade, good, bad or indifferent, and yet all equally 
merchantable. On a sale of goods there is no implied condition that they are of any particular 
grade or standard. If the buyer wishes to guard himself in this respect he must expressly bargain 
for the particular grade or standard that he requires. If he does not do so, caveat emptor; and 
he must accept the goods, however inferior in quality, so long as they conform to the description 
under which they were sold and are of merchantable quality – the term ‘quality’ including state 
or condition.
Similarly, Lord Reid in Kendall v Lillico261 pointed out that where commodities are 
sold in the market under some general description, of which there may be several dif-
ferent qualities available, it is sufficient (indeed in that case it was not disputed) that 
the goods comply with the lowest quality under which goods of that description can 
commonly be sold. But again, it may be necessary to have regard to the price, for the 
price paid may show clearly that the buyer was entitled to something more than the low-
est quality available in the market.
Again, if the goods comply with the normal condition of goods of the quality and 
description under which they are sold they will not be unsatisfactory merely because 
they are inferior to other goods of a similar type. For instance, in the Australian case 
of George Wills & Co Ltd v Davids Pty Ltd,262 the defendants manufactured and sold 
canned beetroot. For some time it had been customary to can beetroots in brine, but 
the defendants then started to can them in vinegar. Such cans had a much shorter life – 
about 12 months – than beetroot canned in brine, or other canned foods, which keep for 
at least three years, but it was held by the Australian High Court that this did not render 
the goods unmerchantable. The court said:
. . . if the contract called for the supply of beetroot canned in vinegar, the parties were bound to 
deliver and accept goods of this description and, if the condition and quality of the goods were 
normal for goods of this description, the purchaser could have no complaint on the ground of 
their merchantability. It would be nothing to the point, on any such complaint, to show that 
beetroot canned in vinegar would not keep for as long a period as canned peas or canned beans 
or, indeed, beetroot canned in brine or for as long as other canned foodstuffs. Nor would it be 
material to show that a wholesaler, who had purchased such goods, might still have them in his 
store more than twelve months later. Indeed, evidence as to the keeping quality of the other 
goods and as to the practice in the wholesale grocery trade would not be admissible in such 
circumstances.263

The duty to supply goods of the right quality 	 171
As suggested above, it does not seem that the amendments in the present Act will have 
any effect on this question.
‘Quality includes state or condition’
‘Quality’ was stated by s. 61 of the 1979 Act to include ‘the state or condition’ of the 
goods and certain conclusions have been drawn from this definition. In Niblett v Con-
fectioners’ Materials Co Ltd,264 the facts of which have already been given, Bankes 
and Atkin LJJ were of the opinion that there had been a breach of s. 14(2) as well as 
of s. 12(1). Bankes LJ said:
Quality includes the state or condition of the goods. The state of this condensed milk was that 
it was packed in tins bearing labels. The labels were as much part of the state or condition of 
the goods as the tins were. The state of the packing affected the merchantable quality of the 
goods.265
As this case shows, the concept of ‘merchantable quality’ might extend beyond mat-
ters which would ordinarily be thought of as pertaining to quality. In some contexts, this 
could be relevant and important with regard to goods which are supplied without proper 
or adequate instructions. This might also be held to be a matter going to the ‘state or 
condition’ of the goods which could involve a breach of s. 14(2) even though the goods 
themselves might be perfectly satisfactory. But, as we have seen above, it was often pos-
sible to arrive at the conclusion that goods were unmerchantable without resorting to 
these words, if adequate warnings or instructions were not given with the goods.
In the 1994 Act, the words relating to the state or condition of the goods are trans-
ferred from s. 61 of the Act to s. 14(2B) itself. This does not appear to lead to any change 
in the effect of the words.
Part of goods unsatisfactory
The cases which have so far been considered were concerned with goods, all of which 
were unmerchantable/unsatisfactory. It may happen, however, that only part of the goods 
are unsatisfactory and that the rest may be satisfactory. In Jackson v Rotax Motor & 
Cycle Co Ltd,266 the plaintiff supplied motor horns to the defendant. One consignment 
was rejected by the defendant as unmerchantable on the ground that about half the 
goods were dented and scratched owing to bad packing. The Court of Appeal held that 
the buyer was entitled to reject the whole consignment, as it was not possible in the cir-
cumstances of the case to invoke the de minimis rule. The requirement of merchantabil-
ity obviously applied to all the goods, and if part of the goods were unmerchantable the 
buyer might reject the whole. No change on this point is made by the 1994 Act, though, 
as we will see, the right of rejection is modified in commercial contracts.267

	172	 The duties of the seller
Maintenance of spare parts and servicing facilities
In modern times an important aspect of complex manufactured goods is the commercial 
practice by which the manufacturer continues to manufacture spare parts for the goods, 
sometimes for many years after those goods have themselves been discontinued. Similarly, 
the manufacturer’s willingness to supply servicing facilities may, in certain cases, be a mat-
ter of some importance. But in the unreported Court of Appeal decision in L Gent & Sons v 
Eastman Machine Co Ltd,268 it was held that there was no legal duty on the manufac-
turer to observe these practices, and goods could not be held to be unmerchantable merely 
because these facilities were not, or were no longer, available.269 The matter was discussed 
briefly by the Law Commissions in their Final Report, and they concluded, inevitably it 
would seem, that it was too complex to be dealt with by legislation, and suggested instead 
that Codes of Practice should be settled under the auspices of the Office of Fair Trading.270 
The EU’s Green Paper did not propose legislation on this issue either.271
Commissioning goods
In the case of complex goods such as machinery and customised software,272 the seller may 
have a duty not merely to supply goods but also to commission them, ironing out in the 
process any ‘teething problems’. In such cases, the seller has a reasonable period in which 
to effect the commissioning before the buyer can reject for breach of either s. 14(2) or (3).273 
Presumably, where this is in the contemplation of the parties, the buyer cannot complain 
of losses consequential on the defects until after such a reasonable period has expired. If 
no time is specified, what amounts to a reasonable time will depend upon the facts of the 
particular case. In the Burnley Engineering Products case,274 a ‘high tech’ welding machine 
was delivered in August 1991 and rejected on 25 September 1992. It was held that if the 
defects had been remedied by that date, the buyer would not have been entitled to reject.
Non-conformity with legal standards
It is common that goods must not only be of satisfactory quality for the purposes 
of the Act but must also comply with other legal standards. The question is whether 
non-compliance with these legal standards would also render them unsatisfactory for 
268	 CA, 1985, cited by the Law Commissions, Final Report, Sale and Supply of Goods, para. 3.66.
269	 There is, of course, the possibility of other manufacturers stepping in and filling the gap by manufacturing 
compatible spare parts. If the original manufacturer seeks to use its intellectual property rights to prevent 
this, it might have been answered with the ‘non-derogation’ principle laid down in British Leyland Ltd v 
Armstrong Patents [1986] RPC 279, but this case was criticised by the Privy Council in Canon Kabushiki 
Kaisha v Green Cartridge Co (HK) [1997] AC 728 (replacement cartridges for printers) and in Mars UK 
v Teknowledge [2000] FSR 138 Jacob J refused to apply the doctrine even to repairs (its original field of 
application). An exercise of intellectual property rights is not, however, of itself, an abuse of a dominant 
position contrary to Article 82 (former 86 of the Treaty of Rome) – see Volvo v Veng (UK) Ltd (Case 238/87) 
[1989] 4 CMLR 122; see also the Opinion of the Advocate-General in Magill TV Guide/ITP, BBC and RTE

The duty to supply goods of the right quality 	 173
the purposes of s. 14(2)? It could be argued that in some circumstances; for example, 
where the goods are in all sense precisely those ordered by the buyer, free from physi-
cal defects, etc. the two are not linked, indeed this is basis of the dispute in Lowe v W 
Machell Joinery Ltd.275 In this case, the claimants had ordered a bespoke staircase at a 
cost of £16,000. After delivery of the staircase they sought to reject it before claiming 
the purchase price. The staircase was in all senses compliant with the buyers’ require-
ments and therefore ostensibly of satisfactory quality, however, it was later argued that 
had it been installed, in the claimant’s newly built home, it would not have complied 
with Building Regulations. The claimants argued that notwithstanding its conformity 
with their specification, it was nonetheless, as a result of this, not of satisfactory quality, 
thereby entitling them to reject it. The claim failed at first instance. The judge finding 
that because minor modifications would bring it within compliance with the Building 
Regulations, rejection was not justified.
The Court of Appeal did not find favour in this argument. Lloyd LJ stated the court’s 
view that ‘on the basis that the goods, supplied in exact conformity with the contract, 
could not lawfully be used for their intended purpose, known to the seller, it does not 
seem to me that they were reasonably fit for the purpose, nor that a reasonable buyer 
would find them satisfactory’.
The result of the decision is that compliance with over-arching legal standards, 
whether in relation to safety or otherwise will render goods unfit under s. 14(2), even 
where they are all in all other sense satisfactory.
It is also interesting to consider the status that soft standards would have in relation 
to s. 14(2). Soft standards are pervasive and are particularly important, for example, in 
relation to technology. Standards such as HDMI, USB, SD are just three of the hundreds 
of standards used to the transmission and storage of data; similar examples could be 
found in relation to most other types of goods. While a failure to comply with these 
standards may cause the goods not to function at all, in light of Lowe it seems possible 
that potentially a lack of compliance that has no impact on functionality may provide a 
basis for a buyer to reject goods.
4 Implied terms that the goods are fit for a particular purpose
Section 14(3), replacing the original s. 14(1) in the 1893 Act, lays down the following 
condition:
Where the seller sells goods in the course of a business and the buyer, expressly or by 
implication, makes known—
(a)	 to the seller, or
(b)	 where the purchase price or part of it is payable by instalments and the goods were previ-
ously sold by a credit-broker to the seller, to that credit-broker, any particular purpose for 
which the goods are being bought, there is an implied condition that the goods supplied 
under the contract are reasonably fit for that purpose, whether or not that is a purpose for 
which such goods are commonly supplied, except where the circumstances show that the 
275	 [2011] EWCA Civ 794

	174	 The duties of the seller
buyer does not rely, or that it is unreasonable for him to rely, on the skill or judgment of the 
seller or credit-broker.276
No change in this section is made by the 1994 Act.
In what circumstances is the condition implied?
Reliance on the seller’s skill or judgment
Under the original s. 14(1), the buyer had first to satisfy the court that he had expressly 
or by implication made known to the seller the particular purpose for which the goods 
were required so as to show that he relied on the seller’s skill or judgment. In consumer 
sales, the courts leaned heavily in favour of the buyer in this respect, the approach may 
in the future be different, but the courts have demonstrated a willingness to look at the 
facts holistically and pragmatically in non-consumer cases.277 For example, in Grant v 
Australian Knitting Mills Ltd,278 Lord Wright said:
The reliance will seldom be express: it will usually arise by implication from the circumstances; 
thus to take a case like that in question, of a purchase from a retailer the reliance will be in 
general inferred from the fact that a buyer goes to the shop in the confidence that the tradesman 
has selected his stock with skill and judgment.279
The trend of the cases was to hold that if the seller knew the purpose for which the 
buyer wanted the goods, the buyer would be taken to have relied on the seller’s skill 
or judgment.280 The present s. 14(3) largely confirms the old case law on this point, so 
that it is still relevant to refer to it. It is now clear that the onus on the buyer in the first 
instance is only to show that he has made known the purpose for which the goods are 
being bought. Reliance will then be presumed unless it is positively disproved, or unless 
the seller can show it to have been unreasonable.
276	 The references to credit-brokers relate to conditional sale agreements (like hire-purchase contracts), and are 
designed to cover the situation in which a person who acquires goods under a consumer credit contract does 
not deal directly with the finance company, with whom he actually contracts, but with an ordinary dealer. 
Such a dealer who introduces the buyer to a finance company (for instance, by getting him to fill in the 
appropriate forms) is called a credit-broker in the Consumer Credit Act 1974.

Kendall v Lillico [1969] 2 AC 31, 81 where Lord Reid said:
I do not think that [Manchester Liners v Rea – discussed below] is any authority for the view which has sometimes been 
expressed that if the seller knows the purpose for which the buyer wants the goods it will be presumed that the buyer 
relied on his skill and judgment.
	
Of this dictum Lord Guest observed:
I do not understand my noble and learned friend, Lord Reid, to be saying that the presumption can now be drawn from 
the mere fact that a particular purpose is made known to the seller. He emphasizes that the question is whether in the 
whole circumstances the reasonable inference can properly be drawn that a reasonable man in the shoes of the seller 
would realise that he was being relied on.
	
It is submitted that, despite the change of wording in the present s. 14(3) from that with which their 
Lordships were dealing, Lord Guest’s dictum is still apposite – few of the cases discussed in the text would 
have been decided differently under the present provisions.

	
	 	
The duty to supply goods of the right quality 	 175
Strictly speaking, of course, reliance is a question of fact, although whether reliance 
is unreasonable must involve an element of evaluation.281 But a number of illustrations 
from typical cases may nonetheless be useful. The fact that both buyers and sellers are 
members of the same commodity market does not of itself show that the buyer does 
not rely on the seller, though it no doubt tends against the inference of such reliance.282 
But where one merchant has brought the goods to the attention of another and has rec-
ommended them to him, such reliance may be found. When the seller is also the man-
ufacturer, the inference that the buyer has relied on him, at least in part, will rarely be 
rebutted.283 The fact that the buyer proposes to analyse or inspect or test the goods on 
delivery does not mean that he is not relying on the seller.284 Where the seller is selling for 
export from the United Kingdom to some country overseas, the mere fact that he knows 
that the buyer is buying for import into a foreign country does not show that the buyer 
relies on the seller’s skill or judgment with respect to the suitability of the goods for that 
particular country.285 In such a case it is the buyer who would normally be presumed to 
have the necessary knowledge of the conditions in the country of import and reliance 
may thus be disproved or, alternatively, may be held to be unreasonable.
The concept of ‘unreasonable’ reliance, introduced by s. 14(3), was not explicitly 
used before 1973, but it was in fact largely inherent in the old law. Prior to the 1973 
Act a court which found that the buyer had acted unreasonably in relying on the seller 
could always hold that the implied condition was excluded by a contrary intention. As 
a result of the Unfair Contract Terms Act, this is now no longer always possible, and it 
was therefore necessary to give power to the court to exclude liability where ‘unreason-
able reliance’ was shown. It will, of course, be for the courts to decide what amounts to 
‘unreasonable reliance’. But a good case can be made for treating reliance as unreason-
able where the seller in effect disclaims responsibility and merely proffers his advice for 
what it is worth.286
Where the buyer’s complaint is that the goods do not perform as well as had been 
hoped rather than that they are defective in any real sense, it may be relevant that 
the goods have been made to a new and experimental design. In Dixon Kerly Ltd v 
Robinson,287 the defendant agreed to buy a yacht in course of construction to an untried 
design of the plaintiffs. Although the plaintiffs knew that the defendant wanted the boat 
281	 See Jewson Ltd v Boyhan [2003] EWCA Civ 1030 and the more recent decisions of BSS Group Ltd v Makers

Act).

selected the goods from the maker’s catalogue. This seems unsound. Selection of goods from a catalogue is 
no evidence that the buyer does not rely on the manufacturer’s skill and judgment, any more than selection 
of the goods themselves.

for sea-cruising and cross-channel trips, it was held that the plaintiffs gave no warranty 
that the yacht would be suitable for this purpose.
It is sufficient if the buyer relies only partially on the skill or judgment of the seller. 
In Cammell Laird & Co Ltd v Manganese Bronze & Brass Co Ltd,288 the defendants 
agreed to construct two propellers for two ships for the plaintiffs. These were to be made 
according to certain specifications laid down by the plaintiffs, but certain matters, and 
in particular the thickness of the blades, were left to the defendants. One of the propellers 
proved useless owing to defects in matters not laid down in the specification. It was held 
by the House of Lords that the defendants were liable for breach of the condition implied 
by the old s. 14(1) as ‘there was a substantial area outside the specification which was not 
covered by its directions and was therefore necessarily left to the skill and judgment of the 
seller’.289 But where the buyer has only relied partially on the skill or judgment of the seller, 
‘the reliance in question must be such as to constitute a substantial and effective induce-
ment which leads the buyer to agree to purchase the commodity’.290 Moreover, it must be 
shown that the matters of which the buyer complains were matters in respect of which he 
relied on the seller.291
If, however, the buyer is well aware that the seller can only supply him with one par-
ticular brand of the goods in question, it can scarcely be said that the buyer relies on the 
seller’s skill or judgment. Thus in Wren v Holt,292 where the plaintiff bought beer in a 
public house which he knew to be tied, the Court of Appeal held that there was evidence 
on which the jury could find that the buyer had not relied on the seller’s skill or judg-
ment. Mere suspicion that only a certain type of goods can be supplied is not enough to 
exclude liability, however.
In Manchester Liners Ltd v Rea,293 the defendants supplied coal to the plaintiffs for 
their ship the Manchester Importer. The coal was unsuitable for this ship, and the sellers 
were held liable under the section although the buyers had good ground for suspecting 
that the seller might have difficulty in supplying the right type of coal owing to a railway 
strike.294
Where the buyer has invited a third party to inspect the goods on his behalf, and 
the third party has reported favourably to the buyer in reliance on the seller’s skill and 
judgment, it may be a nice question whether the buyer himself can be regarded as hav-
ing relied on the seller’s skill and judgment or whether he has merely relied on the third 
party’s report. If the third party is the buyer’s employee acting in the course of his 
duty,295 or perhaps if he actually passes on to the buyer what the seller has said, it seems

delivered was not fit for an ordinary Manchester steamer (a well-known class of vessel at the time) in the 
hands of average officers and crew – see Kendall v Lillico [1969] 2 AC 31, 81 per Lord Reid. Given that the

that the buyer can invoke the section. But as we have seen above, the fact that the buyer 
proposes to have the goods inspected or tested after delivery does not rebut the inference 
that he is relying on the seller’s skill or judgment.
Where sellers sold potatoes for export from Northern Ireland to Poland and it was 
shown that a clearance certificate was required from the Northern Ireland Ministry of 
Agriculture, it was held that the buyers relied on the certificate rather than on the sellers 
in respect of matters covered by the certificate.296 However, this may have been a spe-
cial case. In export sales it is common for buyers to demand certificates of quality from 
impartial third parties who are required to inspect the goods, or samples, prior to ship-
ment. Buyers clearly rely substantially on such certificates because they often have to pay 
for the goods before they receive them, but this does not deprive them of their normal 
remedies against the sellers under the contract of sale itself.
‘Particular purpose’
Although the old s. 14(1) referred to ‘the particular purpose for which the goods are 
required’ it was well settled that the word ‘particular’ was used in the sense of ‘specified’ 
rather than in contradistinction to ‘general’.297 The purpose may in fact be a very general 
purpose; for example, a car to drive on the road. In MacGill v Talbot,298 a classic car 
collector advised a commercial car dealer that he wished to buy a Rolls Royce that was 
reasonably fit for the purpose of economic restoration. The dealers provided a car which 
it was estimated would cost about £23,500 to restore; in fact it cost £85,000 to £100,000. 
It was held that the buyer had made known a particular purpose, in the light of previ-
ous dealings between the parties. Moreover, the word ‘particular’ did not exclude cases 
where the goods could only be used for one purpose. In Priest v Last,299 for example, 
the Court of Appeal held that a hot-water bottle was required for a particular purpose 
within the section although it had only one purpose in the ordinary way. To quote again 
from Lord Wright in Grant v Australian Knitting Mills Ltd:300
There is no need to specify in terms the particular purpose for which the buyer requires the 
goods, which is nonetheless the particular purpose within the meaning of the section, because 
it is the only purpose for which anyone would ordinarily want the goods.
These decisions appear to be largely confirmed by the present s. 14(3), which has sub-
stituted the words ‘any particular purpose’ for ‘the particular purpose’.
Some difficulty has arisen where the purpose for which the buyer wants the goods is 
made known to the seller but there is some peculiarity about the purpose of which the 
seller is unaware. In Griffiths v Peter Conway Ltd,301 the plaintiff contracted dermati-
tis from a Harris Tweed coat which she had bought from the defendants. It was found 
as a fact that the plaintiff had an unusually sensitive skin and that the coat would not 
have harmed a normal person. It was argued for the plaintiff that the case fell within

	178	 The duties of the seller
the precise words of the section as the coat was not fit for the purpose for which it was 
required, namely her personal use. This argument was rejected by the Court of Appeal302 
on the ground that the plaintiff’s sensitive skin rendered the required use so special that 
she had not made known to the sellers the purpose for which the coat was required in the 
relevant sense.303
In reaching this decision, the court was obliged to distinguish Manchester Liners v 
Rea,304 which has been referred to above, and in which it was held that coal supplied 
by sellers for a particular ship was required by the section to be suitable for that ship. 
Lord Greene pointed out that ships differed in their types and requirements and that 
coal merchants knew this well enough; hence, if a merchant undertook to supply coal 
for a particular ship, he was bound to supply coal suitable for that ship. There was no 
normal or standard type of ship from which the plainitff’s ship differed. But in Griffiths 
v Peter Conway Ltd,305 this was the position. A normal person would have been unaf-
fected by the coat. This does not mean that persons who are, in one sense, ‘abnormal’ 
are never protected by the subsection because there are clearly degrees of abnormality. 
For instance, a drug unfit for use by pregnant women would seem clearly to be unfit for 
its purpose if sold for use by a woman who is in fact pregnant.
In the Ashington Piggeries case,306 herring meal was sold for compounding into animal  
feeding stuffs, but the meal was contaminated with some toxic element. This rendered 
the meal mildly toxic to most animals though it was only seriously dangerous to mink. 
It was held that the case differed from Griffiths v Peter Conway Ltd, which was a ‘highly 
special case’ because, although mink were peculiarly susceptible to the toxic element, 
there was evidence that this element was also harmful to other animals. Moreover, it was 
held that the burden of proof was on the seller to establish that the toxic element was 
harmless to other animals. Thus, in the upshot, the herring meal was held to be unfit for 
the purpose for which it was sold (namely compounding into animal feeding-stuff) even 
though it could have been safely compounded into such feeding-stuff in small quanti-
ties so long as the resultant compound was sold as not fit for use by mink. But this was 
largely because the dangerous element in the meal was not known. If it had been known, 
and the buyers had bought it all the same, then it would clearly have been fit for the pur-
pose for which it was sold.
Resale may be a particular purpose within the meaning of the section where it is clear 
enough for what purposes the goods will ultimately be used. But where a buyer buys 
goods which have a wide variety of possible uses the responsibility placed on the seller

of Lords held that the suppliers not having been made aware of the abnormality were not in a position 
to exercise skill and judgment for the purpose of dealing with it. In Kelly v Andersons House Furnishers 
(Inverurie) Ltd 2012 GWD 20-422 (Aberdeen Sheriff Court), a buyer of a three-piece suite suffered from 
extreme sweat excretion which caused discolouration of the suite but, having not informed the seller of his 
condition, was unable to show breach of s. 14(3).

The duty to supply goods of the right quality 	 179
may be heavy indeed. In Kendall v Lillico,307 (which was much discussed in the section 
on satisfactory quality) Brazilian ground nut extraction was sold for the purpose of 
compounding it into feeding-stuff for cattle and poultry, and it was held that there was 
a breach of the section because the extraction proved fatal to pheasant and partridge 
chicks, though it was not dangerous to cattle. In the Ashington Piggeries case (referred 
to above), the original suppliers were merely selling herring meal for compounding into 
animal feeding-stuffs and this proved fatal to mink. Again the suppliers were held liable. 
It will be seen that in cases of this nature, the ‘particular purpose’ may be very wide 
indeed, and although the goods may be quite satisfactory for a wide range of uses, the 
seller will be liable if the goods are in fact unsuitable for any one of those uses to which 
the buyer puts the goods.308 The only qualification on this seems to be that it must be 
shown that the particular use to which the buyer put the goods was not unforeseeable or 
abnormal. It is unnecessary to show that this particular use was actually contemplated 
by the parties. Nor, under s. 14(3), is it necessary that the goods are commonly supplied 
for the purpose in question. Thus, in the Ashington Piggeries case it was enough to ren-
der the ultimate suppliers liable that herring meal was commonly used in feeding-stuffs 
for mink; it was not necessary to go further and show that this was the particular pur-
pose for which the feeding-stuff would be likely to be used.
Status of seller is irrelevant
Since the subsection formerly stated that the seller was liable ‘whether he [was] the man-
ufacturer or not’, it might have been thought that it only applied to manufactured goods, 
but it was well settled that it also applied to non-manufactured goods, such as food-
stuffs.309 The present s. 14(3) has dropped these words altogether.
‘Where the seller sells goods in the course of a business’
The original s. 14(1) applied only where the goods were of a description ‘which it is in 
the course of the seller’s business to supply’. The 1973 Act made it clear that so long as 
the seller was selling ‘in the course of a business’310 this requirement was satisfied. This 
provision is now reproduced in the 1979 Act.311
Whatever interpretation is given to these words, it is clear that they exclude from the 
operation of s. 14(3) all cases of private sales; for example, of second-hand goods, and 
that, in practice, only manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers and dealers will be caught 
by this implied condition. Since the implied condition that the goods are satisfactory is 
307	 [1969] 2 AC 31.
308	 But see below for the view of Nicholls LJ in the Aswan Engineering case [1987] 1 WLR 1, 27, which 
suggests that where the goods are sold for one broad purpose they will be reasonably fit for that purpose 
even though unfit for some unusual subdivisions within it.

	180	 The duties of the seller
limited in the same way, as has been seen, it follows that there is still fairly wide scope for 
the application of the maxim caveat emptor in private sales. Of course, actual reliance 
by a buyer in such a case may justify a finding that an express warranty was given, but 
there is no implied term under s. 14(2) or (3).
Onus of proof
It is for the claimant to prove, on the balance of probabilities, that the defendant’s prod-
uct was not fit for its purpose.312
The former proviso to s. 14(3)
Section 14(3) (which was formerly s. 14(1)) originally had a proviso which excluded lia-
bility where goods were sold under a ‘patent or other trade name’,313 but once again the 
courts leaned heavily in favour of the buyer in interpreting the words of the Act. There 
were two leading cases on the interpretation of the proviso: Bristol Tramway Co Ltd v 
Fiat Motors Ltd314 and Baldry v Marshall.315
The second case virtually interpreted the proviso out of existence, since it was plain 
that the only circumstances in which the proviso applied were those in which the buyer 
had not relied on the skill or judgment of the seller. The fact that goods were ordered 
under a patent or trade name was not enough to exclude the seller’s liability unless the 
circumstances showed that the buyer was not relying on the seller’s skill or judgment. 
Although normally a person who buys goods in a shop is relying impliedly on the seller’s 
skill and judgment, it is reasonably clear that where he orders the goods under a trade 
name he is relying on the reputation of the maker rather than on the shopkeeper. ‘If a 
person goes in[to a shop] and asks for a bottle of R White’s lemonade, or somebody’s 
particular brand of beer, he is not relying on the skill and judgment of the person who 
serves it to him.’316 The Law Commissions felt that the proviso had ceased to serve any 
purpose and it disappeared in the 1973 Act.
What is the extent of the seller’s obligation?
The second question which arises under this subsection is: what is the extent of the 
seller’s obligation? Several points arise here.
Goods to which s. 14(3) extends
A precisely comparable point arises under s. 14(2) and has already been dealt with 
above.317 Reference should be made to this discussion.

The duty to supply goods of the right quality 	 181
Triviality
As in the case of the requirement of satisfactory quality, it seems clear that the condition 
under s. 14(3) can be violated even though the unfitness is a trivial matter, and could  
easily have been rectified. In Parsons (Livestock) Ltd v Uttley, Ingham & Co,318 it does 
not seem to have been seriously disputed that the sellers were in breach of s. 14(3) when 
they supplied an animal-food hopper to the plaintiffs, but left sealed a ventilator (which 
could not be seen from the ground) with ultimately disastrous results. The only thing 
wrong with the hopper as supplied was that the ventilator was closed, a matter which 
could have been easily and instantly rectified if it had been discovered.
Strictness of seller’s liability
It is now beyond doubt that the defendant’s obligations can extend under s. 14(3) to 
latent defects not discoverable by any amount of diligence or care. In Frost v Aylesbury 
Dairy Co Ltd,319 the argument was pressed that the buyer ‘could not be said to rely on 
the skill or judgment of the sellers in a case in which no skill or judgment would enable 
them to find out the defect’ in the goods supplied. The goods in question were milk 
infected with typhoid against which it was not at the time practical to test. The sellers 
were held liable, though a reason for this appears to have been that they warranted the 
milk ‘free from germs and disease’. In a number of American cases, the ‘blood bank’ 
cases, patients were infected by diseases in blood given in transfusions. These were such 
that at the time it was not feasible to test for their presence. In some cases, the courts 
refused to hold that there had been a sale.320 In other cases, however, the courts held that 
a warranty was implied, and was breached.321
In Kendall v Lillico,322 Lord Reid said:
If the law were always logical one would suppose that a buyer who has obtained a right to 
rely on the seller’s skill and judgment, would only obtain thereby an assurance that proper 
skill and judgment had been exercised, and would only be entitled to a remedy if a defect 
in the goods was due to failure to exercise such skill and judgment. But the law has always 
gone further than that. By getting the seller to undertake to use his skill and judgment the 
buyer gets under s. 14(1) [now s. 14(3)] an assurance that the goods will be reasonably fit for 
his purpose and that covers not only defects which the seller ought to have detected but also 
defects which are latent in the sense that even the utmost skill and judgment on the part of the 
seller would not have detected them.
It should be noted, however, that this remark appears to address the question of the lia-
bility of a seller, rather than that of the manufacturer or ultimate supplier. As suggested 
below,323 the liability of the latter may be less than absolute. If we regard the holding of

	182	 The duties of the seller
the seller liable to be principally a device for passing back liability ‘up the line’, it can 
be argued that the seller’s liability should not be greater than that of the manufacturer 
or ultimate supplier, unless the seller has expressly or impliedly undertaken a greater 
liability. In any event, the seller’s duty is only to supply goods which are ‘reasonably’ fit, 
not which are absolutely fit. This is likely to be of special importance where the relevant 
‘particular purpose’ is very broadly stated. For if the goods are suitable for most subdivi-
sions within a broad ‘purpose’, the fact that they may not be reasonably fit for some rare 
and improbable subdivision will not necessarily involve a breach of s. 14(3).324 This point 
was discussed by Lord Pearce in Kendall v Lillico:325
I would expect a tribunal of fact to decide that a car sold in this country was reasonably fit 
for touring even though it was not well adapted for conditions in a heat-wave: but not, if it 
could not cope adequately with rain. If, however, it developed some lethal or dangerous trick 
in very hot weather I would expect it to be found unfit. In deciding the question of fact the 
rarity of the unsuitability would be weighed against the gravity of its consequences. Again, if 
food was merely unpalatable or useless on rare occasions, it might well be reasonably suitable 
for food. But I should certainly not expect it to be held reasonably suitable if even on very rare 
occasions it killed the consumer. The question for the tribunal of fact is simply ‘were these 
goods reasonably fit for the specified purpose?
In the Ashington Piggeries case,326 which has been referred to above, the sellers sold her-
ring meal to buyers which was suitable for inclusion in foodstuffs for most animals but 
was contaminated with some substance which rendered it poisonous to mink. The buyers 
used the meal in preparing foodstuffs which were sold to mink companies; the compa-
nies used the foodstuffs as mink food and suffered serious losses in consequence. They 
sued the buyers, who claimed in turn against the sellers. The buyers argued that the meal 
was required to be reasonably fit for inclusion in animal foodstuffs generally; the sellers 
argued that the meal was only required to be reasonably fit for inclusion in feeding-stuffs 
for pigs, poultry and cattle. It was held, in effect, that the meal was required to be fit for 
inclusion in feeding-stuffs for any animals to which the sellers ought to have contem-
plated that it might be fed, and that was sufficient to impose liability on the sellers on 
the facts.
A slightly less stringent test was favoured in the Aswan Engineering case,327 where pails 
bought by the plaintiffs for filling with waterproofing compound proved unfit for stack-
ing six high in the intense heat of a Kuwaiti dockside. The Court of Appeal rejected the 
buyers’ claim under s. 14(3) (as well as the claim under s. 14(2)). Lloyd LJ rejected the 
claim because he thought the plaintiffs had not relied on the sellers, but Nicholls LJ 
thought that such reliance had been proved on the facts. Nevertheless, he took the view 
that even if the particular purpose for which the goods had been required was simply 
‘for export’, this would not have been enough to fix liability on the sellers. Where the 
purpose is stated as broadly as this, it adds little to the requirements of merchantability

because it is enough to make the goods reasonably fit ‘for export’ that they are in fact fit 
for export to most parts of the world.
Fitness for purpose and unusual consequences
Where very unusual consequences follow from the use of the goods – sometimes causing 
unexpected accidental injury and damage and the like – it is sometimes argued that the 
goods were perfectly fit for all ordinary purposes, and that the unusual consequences in 
the particular case should not be laid at the seller’s door. In Vacwell Engineering Co Ltd 
v B D H Chemicals,328 the defendants sold glass ampoules containing a chemical known 
as boron tribromide to the buyers, who required it for use in certain manufacturing pro-
cesses. The chemical, in itself, was perfectly fit for the plaintiffs’ purposes but it was 
liable to react with great violence on contact with water, though this was unknown to 
the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs’ process required the labels to be washed off the ampoules 
and this was done with water. While this was being done one of them broke, causing a 
reaction which shattered all the others and as a result a very violent explosion occurred. 
It was held that the goods were not reasonably fit for the purpose for which they were 
sold and the defendants were liable because they ought to have foreseen the possibility of 
the chemical coming into contact with water, and they had not warned the buyers of this 
danger.329 Both in this case and in the Ashington Piggeries case, the issue under s. 14(3) 
was very similar to a general argument that the damage which occurred was too remote 
in accordance with the ordinary principles of contract law discussed by the House of 
Lords in the Heron II.330 In this type of situation it seems that the application of these 
principles is, in effect, identical with the question whether the goods are reasonably fit 
for their purpose under s. 14(3).
This appears to be borne out also by the decision of the House of Lords in Lambert v 
Lewis331 where manufacturers had made a defective towing coupling which was sold by 
retailers to a farmer. The farmer continued to use the coupling after it was apparent that 
it was in a dangerous or unfit state, and an accident resulted which led to the farmer hav-
ing to pay damages to the injured plaintiffs. The farmer sought to recover these damages 
in an action against the retailer for breach of s. 14(3) of the Act. There clearly was such 
a breach because the coupling was sold in a condition in which it was not reasonably fit 
for its purpose (or at least was not likely to remain so fit for a reasonable time), but the 
House of Lords nevertheless held that the farmer could not recover from the retailer the 
damages he had to pay the plaintiff. The reason for this was, in effect, that the damages 
were too remote. In accordance with ordinary principles of remoteness, the farmer’s own 
negligence in continuing to use the coupling in an obviously dangerous state was suffi-
cient to sever the causal chain and free the retailers from liability for the farmer’s own 
negligence.

	184	 The duties of the seller
Knowledge, warnings, instructions, etc.
Just as with the implied condition that goods are of satisfactory quality (merchanta-
ble quality under the former provisions), the seller may be liable because the goods are 
supplied with inadequate information, warnings or instructions. The Ashington Pigger-
ies case, referred to several times above, is one example of goods which were unfit for 
their purpose because they involved a toxic element unknown to the buyers. If the buyers 
(not being the ultimate users) had been warned about this element of toxicity, the goods 
would probably have been fit for their purpose. The Vacwell Engineering case, also men-
tioned above, is another case where the goods were probably unfit for their purpose only 
because the buyers had not been warned by the sellers that the chemical must on no 
account be allowed to come into contact with water.
More recently the Court of Appeal had to consider a case of alleged inadequate 
instructions for use in Wormell v R H M Agriculture (East) Ltd,332 where the plaintiff, 
a farmer, had bought a weed-killer from the defendant sellers for spraying his crops. 
Detailed instructions were on the canisters in which the weed-killer was supplied, say-
ing in large letters (among other things) that spraying was not recommended after a 
certain stage in the growth of the crops. But the plainitff thought this warning was 
designed to avoid the risk of damage to the crops, and he was willing to take the risk 
of damage. Accordingly, he used the spray even during the period not recommended, 
but it proved virtually worthless, and the plaintiff sued for the wasted price of the 
weed-killer. The trial judge found that the instructions were somewhat ambiguous and 
misleading, and the plaintiff had quite reasonably understood the warning to refer 
only to the risk of crop-damage. But the Court of Appeal reversed this decision. They 
insisted that there was nothing wrong with the weed-killer, which would have done 
its job if applied in the right conditions (and it was immaterial that those conditions 
had scarcely existed at all during the year in question because of the weather). The 
case was not, insisted the court, an action for negligence or misrepresentation. The 
question concerned the fitness of the goods themselves, and these were (said the court) 
quite fit for their use if used properly. The warning on the instructions should have 
been heeded. It was, however, not doubted that the instructions had to be taken into 
account in deciding whether the goods were fit for their purpose,333 so it seems that 
the court was (in effect) finding that the instructions were not misleading. It is, per-
haps, not clear if the court was rejecting the usual objective methods of interpreting 
contractual documents because there are indications in the judgment that the sellers 
would not have been liable if the weed-killer had been fit for use when used as intended 
by the sellers, even if the buyer reasonably misunderstood their intentions because of 
misleading instructions. If this is the implication of the decision it is out of line with 
the usual principles of interpretation, and there seems no reason why these princi-
ples should not apply to warnings and instructions as much as to all other contractual 
documents.

States – see Durham v CIBA-Geigy 315 NW 2d 696 (SD 1982) and citations therefor.

The duty to supply goods of the right quality 	 185
Durability
The next point concerns the length of time during which the goods must remain rea-
sonably fit for the purpose. Similar questions arise in dealing with the implied condition 
that the goods must be of satisfactory quality.334 The principle is the same here and there 
is no reason to duplicate the above discussion. Even though the new s. 14(2B)(e) specifi-
cally covers ‘durability’ in the requirement that goods should be of ‘satisfactory quality’, 
and this does not extend to the implied condition under s. 14(3), there is no reason to 
doubt that the case law mentioned above covers this point quite adequately.
Minor defects, non-functional defects, etc.
As we have seen, the authorities on the implied condition of merchantable quality inter-
preted that condition so as to cover non-functional defects, such as minor blemishes, 
cosmetic defects and so forth.335 They also interpreted that implied condition as extend-
ing to minor defects which were easily rectifiable, at any rate, where they were potentially 
dangerous, and perhaps even in other cases as when (for instance) the defects simply made 
the goods unusable, albeit only until the defect is put right.336 There seems no reason why 
this approach should not also apply to the implied condition under s. 14(3). Even after the 
statutory amendment to s. 14(2) made by the Sale and Supply of Goods Act 1994, it is diffi-
cult to think of circumstances where goods not of satisfactory quality would be held fit for 
their purpose, and breach of both warranties is commonly pleaded.337
So far as new vehicles are concerned, it is arguable that they must be free from all 
defects and even that accessories and components must all be in proper working order. It 
does not seem enough to say that the purpose for which a buyer wants a vehicle is simply 
the purpose of driving it on the road, and that, so long as it can do that, it must be rea-
sonably fit for its purpose.338 If that were the case, a buyer would not be able to complain 
under this section that (for instance) a car radio or cigarette lighter did not work. Yet 
a buyer is surely entitled to say that if he has bought a new car with a radio or lighter, 
he must have made it clear to the seller that one of the purposes for which he bought it 
(even if only a minor or subsidiary purpose) is to be able to listen to the radio while driv-
ing, and another to be able to light a cigarette while using the car.
In practice, few cases are brought which deal solely with such minor defects, doubtless 
for the good reason that buyers do not normally attempt to reject cars in such circum-
stances. But it may well be a serious question whether a buyer can reject, for a breach of 
this section, a car which suffers from a collection or series of very trivial defects. Gener-
ally, the courts have accepted the argument that a ‘congeries of defects’, each of which 
may be relatively minor in itself, may in total render a car unfit for its purpose.339

It is clear by now that the conditions implied by s. 13, s. 14(2), s. 14(3) and ss. 14(2C)(c) 
and 15(2)(c)340 (which apply to sales by sample – sales by sample are discussed later)341 
must frequently overlap in practice and, in fact, it has often happened that a claimant 
has succeeded under several of the corresponding sections of the original Act. It may 
therefore be useful to complete this examination of these implied conditions by compar-
ing and contrasting the provisions of the various subsections.
First, both s. 14(2) and (3) only apply where the goods are supplied by a seller who 
sells in the course of business,342 and it is clear that this qualification means the same in 
the two cases.343 In sales by sample, this restriction does not apply.344 Nor does it apply to 
the requirements of s. 13.345
Secondly, in all cases, the provisions apply to manufactured and non-manufactured 
goods alike.
Thirdly, s. 14(3) only applies where the buyer relies on the skill or judgment of the 
seller,346 whereas ss. 14(2) and 15(2)(c) apply even where this is not the case.347 This distinc-
tion may be more apparent than real because the most obvious way in which the buyer can 
show that he is not relying on the seller is to examine the goods himself and, if he does so, 
s. 14(2) excludes liability for defects which ought to have been revealed by that examina-
tion. Section 15(2)(c) also excludes liability for defects discoverable by reasonable exami-
nation of a sample whether it is in fact examined or not. In one respect, however, s. 14(3) is 
clearly wider than the other two subsections because a person may examine the goods and 
still rely partly on the seller’s skill or judgment. In another respect it is narrower than the 
other two because if an examination is taken to indicate a lack of reliance on the seller’s 
skill or judgment it will exclude s. 14(3) altogether, whereas it will only exclude liability 
under s. 14(2) in respect of defects which could have been discovered by the examination, 
and the same is true of s. 15(2)(c). There are also other situations in which it is plain that 
the buyer is not relying on the seller’s skill and judgment (as where he orders goods only 
obtainable from one source) and yet s. 14(2) applies. Examination appears at first sight 
to be irrelevant to s. 13, and there is no doubt that the condition in s. 13 can apply even 
though the buyer has examined the goods.348 But it is also clear that examination of the 
goods may be a relevant factor in deciding whether the sale is a sale by description or not. 
Moreover, it seems unlikely that a buyer could rely on non-conformity with description 
where he is aware of such non-conformity from his examination of the goods.
Fourthly, s. 14(3) is wider than the other subsections in that goods may be perfectly sat-
isfactory although not fit for the purpose for which they were bought. On the other hand, 
the wider liability only attaches if the purpose is expressly or impliedly made known to the

seller, while the condition as to satisfactory quality applies in any event. Section 13, as we 
have seen, deals with description and not quality or fitness, but in some circumstances the 
description includes matters of quality or fitness. Goods may comply with their descrip-
tion but be unsatisfactory or unfit for their purpose, but the converse is also true.
Fifthly, s. 14(2) and s. 14(3) apply to all sales whether by description or by sample, or 
in any other way, whereas s. 13 only applies to sales by description, and s. 15(2)(c) only 
to sales by sample.
5 Implied terms in sales by sample
The meaning of a sale by sample has been left for treatment here, where it can be most 
conveniently dealt with. Section 15(1) says somewhat unhelpfully:
A contract of sale is a contract for sale by sample where there is an express or implied term to 
that effect in the contract.
This subsection means that the mere fact that a sample is provided for the buyer’s 
inspection does not make the sale a sale by sample. It is only a sale by sample if there is 
evidence of an intention that it should be such. In this connection the parol evidence rule 
has given rise to some difficulty; it has been held in a number of cases349 that, if the con-
tract is reduced to writing, and the writing contains no reference to a sample, parol evi-
dence is not normally admissible to show that a sample was produced to the buyer and 
that the sale is a sale by sample. But where the description of the goods has no common 
or definite trade meaning, such evidence may be admissible to identify the description 
with a sample. So, for instance, where sellers sold ‘matchless No. 2475 39/40 white voile’ 
under a written contract, the Australian High Court held that it was open to the buyers 
to identify this product by reference to a sample, though no mention of the sample was 
contained in the contract.350 It has also been held in Australia that a parol collateral con-
tract may be proved under which the goods are warranted equal to sample, even where 
the contract is in writing and contains no reference to a sample.351
The classic exposition of the effect of a sale by sample is that of Lord Macnaghten in 
Drummond v Van Ingen:
The office of a sample is to present to the eye the real meaning and intention of the parties with 
regard to the subject matter of the contract which, owing to the imperfections of language, it 
may be difficult or impossible to express in words. The sample speaks for itself. But it cannot 
be treated as saying more than such a sample would tell a merchant of the class to which the 
buyer belongs, using due care and diligence, and appealing to it in the ordinary way and with 
the knowledge possessed by merchants of that class at the time. No doubt the sample might be 
made to say a great deal more. Pulled to pieces and examined by unusual tests which curiosity 
or suspicion might suggest, it would doubtless reveal every secret of its construction. But that is 
not the way in which business is done in this country.352

technological products it must sometimes happen that a sample is provided which is indeed expected to be 
subjected to very extensive scientific testing. In such a case, of course, this dictum would be inapplicable.

	188	 The duties of the seller
It follows from this, as was held by the House of Lords in this case and as s. 15(2)(c) 
of the Act lays down in requiring the goods to be free from any defect making their qual-
ity unsatisfactory,353 that the use of a sample does not protect the seller from liability in 
respect of defects not reasonably discoverable on examination of the sample, although 
the bulk may in fact correspond perfectly with it. This is clear from s. 14(2C)(c) added 
by the 1994 Act.
We have already dealt with the warranty of freedom from defects rendering the qual-
ity of the goods unsatisfactory in sales by sample.354 The other provisions of the 1979 
Act in respect of sales by sample were:
15.	 (2)	 In the case of a contract for sale by sample there is an implied condition that—
(a)	 the bulk will correspond with the sample in quality;
(b)	 the buyer will have a reasonable opportunity of comparing the bulk with the 
sample;
The 1994 Act repeals paragraph (b) and the equivalent provision is now to be found 
in s. 35(2)(b),355 and it substitutes the word ‘term’ for ‘condition’, but goes on to provide 
that in England, Wales and Northern Ireland the term implied by subsection (2) is a 
condition so that the effect is the same as previously.356 In Scotland, however, the test for 
rejection under s. 15 continues to be the materiality of the breach.
Section 15(2)(a) lays down the obvious requirement that the bulk must correspond 
with the sample. It has been held that ‘it is no compliance with a contractual obligation 
for an article to be delivered which is not in accordance with the sample but which can 
by some simple process, no matter how simple, be turned into an article which is in 
accordance with the sample’.357 But where, according to the normal usages of trade, the 
sample is intended merely for visual examination, the buyer cannot complain that the 
bulk does not correspond with it so long as, on a normal visual examination, it would 
appear to correspond, even though there are in fact differences, perhaps material differ-
ences. The point is that, if the sample is only intended for a simple visual examination, 
the buyer has in no way been misled by a sample being different from the bulk if the dif-
ference could only have been discovered by microscopic examination.358
It is, of course, perfectly possible for a seller to sell goods without guaranteeing that 
they comply with some sample provided to the buyer. The seller may require the buyer to 
make his own examination of the bulk, leaving it to him to decide how much of the bulk 
he will examine and how far he is prepared to take the risk of assuming that the rest of 
it corresponds with the sample. And in some cases (e.g. on a sale of agricultural produce 
yet to be grown), the parties must know that there may be variation in the quality of the 
crop from year to year, and the seller is unlikely to guarantee precise correspondence of

The duty to supply goods of the right quality 	 189
the bulk with a sample. But in such a case, the sale would not be a sale by sample within 
the meaning of the section.359
Section 35(2)(b) provides:
Where goods are delivered to the buyer, and he has not previously examined them, he is not 
deemed to have accepted them . . . until he has had a reasonable opportunity of examining 
them for the purpose— . . .
(b)	 in the case of a contract for sale by sample, of comparing the bulk with the sample.
This is, in effect, a special instance of the general right of examination conferred by  
s. 34.360 The former subsection was not very happily expressed because it was difficult to 
see how there could be a breach of the condition which it implied without a breach of 
the more fundamental duty of delivering the goods. What it really meant, and what s. 35 
now says, is that the buyer is not to be deemed to have accepted the goods until he has 
had an opportunity of examining them and comparing the bulk with the sample. The 
effect of the acceptance is that the buyer can no longer reject for breach of condition, 
but is relegated to his right to claim damages.361
It may finally be remarked here that in a sale by sample and by description, the com-
bined effect of ss. 13 and 15 is that the goods must correspond with the sample and with 
the description, and (if the seller is selling in the course of business) be satisfactory. But s. 
14(2)(c) still operates so as to exclude liability in respect of defects rendering goods unsat-
isfactory which should have been discovered on reasonable inspection of the sample.
The Act makes no provision for what might be called a ‘sale by model’. It is an 
everyday occurrence for a buyer to purchase some product in a shop after examining an 
identical product. But very often he is not actually supplied with the very goods which he 
has examined, but with another version, still packaged, but which is believed to be iden-
tical to the one examined. This is not exactly a sale by sample (there is no ‘bulk’), though 
it is clearly very close to a sale by sample. It seems that there should be an implied con-
dition that the actual goods supplied will be identical with the one examined (unless any 
differences are expressly mentioned or brought to the buyer’s attention), and no doubt 
such a condition can be implied as a matter of general contract law. The implied condi-
tions under s. 14(2) and (3) are, of course, unaffected by the particular nature of such a 
transaction.
Having regard to what was said above, it is difficult to see what these sale by sample 
provisions add to ss. 13 and 14.362
6 Implied terms annexed by trade usage
Section 14(4), replacing and slightly altering the original s. 14(3), lays down that:
An implied condition or warranty about quality or fitness for a particular purpose may be 
annexed to a contract of sale by usage.
359	 See the helpful article by Murdoch (1981) 44 MLR 388.
360	 See p. 448.
361	 See s. 11(4), below, p. 443. For possible differences between the right of examination under s. 15(2)(c) and s. 
34, see Murdoch, above, n. 360.
362	 Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code has no equivalent of these provisions.

	190	 The duties of the seller
This subsection merely illustrates the general rule applicable to all contracts that the 
intention of the parties must be ascertained in the light of all the surrounding circum-
stances. Where the transaction is connected with a particular trade, the custom and 
usage of that trade must be considered as a part of the background against which the 
parties contracted. In the words of Parke B in a leading case:
It has long been settled, that, in commercial transactions, extrinsic evidence of custom and 
usage is admissible to annex incidents to written contracts, in matters with respect to which 
they are silent.363
A simple modern illustration is provided by Peter Darlington Partners Ltd v Gosho Co 
Ltd,364 which has already been referred to.365 The case was concerned with a sale of 
canary seed and, according to the custom of the trade, the buyer was not entitled to 
reject the goods for impurities in the seed, but was entitled to a rebate on the price, pro-
portionate to the percentage of admixture in the seed. It was held that the contract was 
governed by this trade custom.
7 Other implied terms
Section 14(1) is as follows:
Except as provided by this section, and section 15 below and subject to any other enactment, 
there is no implied condition or warranty about the quality or fitness for any particular purpose 
of goods supplied under a contract of sale.
Given that the provisions of s. 14 have been overhauled by Acts starting from the Sale of 
Goods (Implied Terms) Act 1973, and culminating in the 1994 Sale and Supply of Goods 
Act, this residual exclusion of additional implied terms is unobjectionable and indeed 
inevitable. What is perhaps surprising is that the draftsman did not see fit to relegate this 
clause to the end of the section rather than leave it at the head.
8 Mistake as to quality
English law
It is traditional to treat the problem of mistake as to subject-matter in general, and mistake 
as to quality in particular, in isolation from the conditions implied by the Sale of Goods 
Act,366 but now that it is becoming increasingly accepted that a mistake of this kind is 
merely a relevant factor to be considered in the construction of the contract, this approach 
has become inappropriate. If the correct view of English law is that a mistake as to quality 
only renders a contract inoperative (or, as it is usually put, void), where this is the true con-
struction of the contract, it is plain that it is impossible to consider the question of mistake 
without first examining the implied terms as to quality laid down in the Act.

The duty to supply goods of the right quality 	 191
As it has been sought to show elsewhere,367 where there is a contract for the sale of 
goods which turns out to be defective, the courts are, in principle, faced with three possi-
ble solutions to the case. (1) It may be held that the responsibility is on the seller because 
of an express or implied term or misrepresentation. (2) It may be held that the buyer has 
taken the risk of the goods being defective; that is, that it is a case of caveat emptor. (3) 
It may be held that neither seller nor buyer has taken the risk or may reasonably be held 
to have taken the risk or responsibility of the goods being defective. Although lawyers 
frequently discuss cases of the third sort as being part of some ‘doctrine’ of mistake the 
courts have rarely adopted this approach.
Claim by buyer that contract void for mistake
In practice, a party who alleges that a contract of sale is ‘void’ owing to a mistake as to 
the quality of the goods does so for the very reason that the terms implied by the Sale of 
Goods Act do not protect him or, alternatively, because he wishes to reject the goods and 
he cannot do so for breach of condition owing to the strict limitations imposed on the 
right of rejection by the Act.368 For this reason it will be found that it is nearly always a 
buyer, rarely a seller, who claims a contract to be ‘void’ on such a ground. Confusion has 
also arisen from some cases, because in holding that a buyer is entitled to reject goods 
for breach of condition, the courts have sometimes used language which is capable of 
being interpreted to mean that the contract is itself void.
In practice, the courts have nearly always dealt with cases of this sort by asking: ‘Has 
the seller not delivered what he contracted to sell?’ (that is, ‘Has there been a breach of 
s. 13?’), and ‘Has there been any express or implied condition or warranty relating to the 
quality of the goods?’ (that is, ‘Has there been a breach of s. 14(2) or (3)?’). If the answer 
to either of these questions is ‘Yes’, the buyer has his remedy, whereas if the answer to 
both questions is in the negative, the buyer has no remedy: it is a case of caveat emptor. 
To argue that the contract is void for mistake in such circumstances is an attempt to 
add new terms to those implied by the Act, or to evade the restrictions on the right of 
rejection imposed by ss. 11 and 35. It has already been seen that s. 14(1) prevents the 
implication of terms, other than those there set out, which would impose additional 
responsibilities on the seller in respect of the quality or fitness of the goods.369
Nevertheless, it is possible that s. 14(1) would not prevent the implication, in suitable 
cases, of genuine conditions in the offer or acceptance, subject to which the buyer is 
prepared to contract. Such a condition would not impose a liability on the seller, but 
would, if unsatisfied, prevent a contract coming into existence, or from operating 
where it has already come into existence. Financings Ltd v Stimson370 could be regarded 
as an illustration of a contract ‘void by mistake’, but the courts simply do not adopt 
this analysis. In that case, where the goods, unknown to the parties, were damaged 
367	 See (1961) 24 MLR 421 (P. S. Atiyah with F. A. R. Bennion).
368	 See below, p. 443. Or again, a buyer may invoke mistake in order to evade the normal limitation period, 
though in this case he will have to rely on s. 32 of the Limitation Act 1980, rather than on an ordinary claim 
at common law, or in equity, because such claims are themselves subject to limitation periods. See Peco Arts 
Inc v Hazlitt Galleries [1983] 3 All ER 193.
369	 See above, p. 190 et seq.
370	 [1962] 1 WLR 1184.

	192	 The duties of the seller
between the offer and the acceptance, the court treated the question as one of construc-
tion of the offer.
While it is not possible in a book of this nature to examine in detail all the cases on this 
subject, it is necessary to glance at a few of them. For many years Smith v Hughes371 has 
been a leading, if puzzling, case on this point. In this famous case the defendant agreed to 
buy a specific quantity of oats from the seller after the seller had given the buyer a sample. 
The buyer declined to accept the goods on the ground that they were new oats and not, as he 
thought, old oats. In such circumstances the approach of the courts today would simply be 
to ask if the seller had contracted to deliver old oats or the specific parcel of oats sold, old or 
not. As the buyer had seen a sample of the oats, it is hard to see how the buyer could today 
get such a case on its feet unless he could show that the seller had described the oats as old. 
Any attempt to rely on mistake is simply to fudge the issue.
In Leaf v International Galleries,372 the plaintiff bought a painting from the defend-
ants which was believed by both parties to be, and was stated by the defendants to be, a 
Constable. Some years later the plaintiff discovered that the picture was a copy, and he 
brought an action claiming rescission of the contract. Now it is possible that the buyer 
could have obtained damages for breach of condition, but he did not want damages – 
he wanted to rescind the contract. Unfortunately for him his claim to reject the goods 
for breach of condition was plainly barred by the Act, and he accordingly attempted 
to argue that he could rescind for innocent misrepresentation instead. This claim was 
rejected by the court on the ground that he was too late. It will be seen that no sugges-
tion was made that the contract was void for mistake, but Denning LJ discussed the 
possibility in his judgment and rejected it because:
Such a mistake does not avoid the contract: there was no mistake at all about the subject matter 
of the sale. It was a specific picture ‘Salisbury Cathedral’. The parties were agreed in the same 
terms on the same subject matter, and that is sufficient to make a contract.373
Denning LJ might also have added that if the sellers had expressly stated that the picture was 
a Constable, the risk of its not being a Constable was plainly on them, and accordingly any 
construction of the contract which would have placed the risk on neither party was ruled 
out. There was thus no room for any holding that the contract was void for mistake.
Another case which seems to bear out this view is Harrison & Jones v Bunten & 
Lancaster,374 where the appellants (from arbitration) agreed to buy from the respondents 
a quantity of Calcutta Kapok ‘Sree’ brand. Both parties were under the impression that 
this was a brand of pure Kapok but, in fact, it contained a proportion of cotton, which 
rendered it unsuitable for the buyers’ purposes, and they claimed to reject it. Pilcher J 
held that the contract was not void for mistake. He said:375
When goods, whether specific or unascertained, are sold under a known trade description 
without misrepresentation, innocent or guilty, and without breach of warranty, the fact that 
both parties are unaware that goods of that known trade description lack any particular

The duty to supply goods of the right quality 	 193
quality is, in my view, completely irrelevant; the parties are bound by their contract, and there 
is no room for the doctrine that the contract can be treated as a nullity on the ground of mutual 
mistake, even though the mistake from the point of view of the purchaser may turn out to be of 
a fundamental character.
It is true that elsewhere in his judgment,376 Pilcher J said that ‘there are, no doubt, 
many cases in which proof of a mutual mistake[377] as to a quality of a fundamental 
character will serve to avoid a contract of sale’, but the fact remains that (except for the 
cases as to perished goods, dealt with in Chapter 5) there is scarcely a single modern 
case in our reports to illustrate such a rule with the dubious exception of Nicholson & 
Venn v Smith Marriott.378 In this case the plaintiffs bought a set of table linen described 
as Caroline, whereas it was in fact discovered to be Georgian. The plaintiffs sued for and 
obtained damages for breach of warranty, but the learned judge went on to say that in 
his opinion the contract was void for mistake. His remarks on this point were therefore 
obiter, and they were disapproved by Denning LJ in Solle v Butcher.379
It remains to consider whether the position in equity differs from the position at law. 
Before the decision in Solle v Butcher there was no ground for thinking that equity recog-
nised a wider doctrine of common mistake than law. The only difference was that equity 
treated contracts affected by common mistakes as voidable and not void. The reason for 
this was that most of these cases involved title to land and, in such cases, the parties went to 
the Chancery because they wished to have documents delivered up for cancellation. Once 
within the jurisdiction of equity, they had of course to accept such terms as the court wished 
to impose. Hence the impression arose that such contracts were not void but voidable.
Solle v Butcher is not a case of sale of goods, and whatever the ratio decidendi of the case 
it would appear that the profession has not yet been convinced that there is an independent 
doctrine of mistake in equity which entitles a court to set aside contracts owing to a mistake 
as to the subject-matter of the contract.380 Even if the views of Denning LJ are eventually 
accepted, it is unlikely that they will be applied to purely commercial contracts such as the 
sale of goods, and it would probably be unfortunate if this were ever done. The law appli-
cable to the sale of goods is on the whole both well-known and reasonably definite. It might 
create considerable uncertainty in business relations if a vague and discretionary doctrine 
of mistake in equity were to be applied to the sale of goods. An argument based on mistake 
in equity was also pressed in Harrison & Jones v Bunten & Lancaster, but Pilcher J said:381
In the facts of the case . . . neither party was at fault . . . I am well satisfied that it would not be 
right on the facts of this case to say that the contracts were voidable on equitable grounds, and 
I do not propose to say any more about that.

breach of warranty if, as he thought, the contract was void.
380	 However, it was followed in Grist v Bailey [1967] Ch 532, and again in Laurence v Lexcourt Holdings Ltd 
[1978] 2 All ER 810; it appears to have been accepted as good law in Associated Japanese Bank SA v Crédit 
du Nord SA [1988] 3 All ER 902; it was also in substance adopted by the Australian High Court in Taylor 
v Johnson (1983) 151 CLR 422. In Clarion Ltd and others v National Provident Institution [2000] 2 All ER 
265 (not a sale of goods case) it was held that it was ordinarily not part of equity’s function to allow a party 
to escape from a bad bargain.

	194	 The duties of the seller
It is submitted that this dictum is applicable to all cases of sale of goods if not, indeed, 
to all commercial transactions, and it is proposed to follow the learned judge’s example 
and not to ‘say any more about that’.382
Claim by seller that contract void for mistake
We have mentioned above that a claim that a contract is void for mistake is more usually 
made by the buyer and not by the seller. Buyers are now well protected by the law, at least 
in respect of mistakes as to the quality of the goods they buy, and for this reason, it has 
been suggested, there has been increasing reluctance to recognise additional buyer rights 
by holding a contract void for mistake at the suit of a buyer.383 The converse situation 
is somewhat different. There are no implied terms to protect the seller or to ensure that 
he receives fair value for his goods. Doubtless this difference has arisen for a variety of 
reasons, but the main one would seem to be that buyers are more likely to be private 
individuals than sellers. However, private individuals do sometimes sell goods to dealers; 
for example, second-hand cars, antiques or farm produce. In such situations, the law still 
offers no real protection to the individual seller against the danger of being over-reached. 
Of course, in extreme cases there may be the possibility of relying on fraud, misrep-
resentation or undue influence, but there are no implied terms to protect the seller.
It is in precisely this sort of case that courts may be found willing to protect a seller 
by invoking mistake doctrines. The most famous such case is undoubtedly the American 
decision in Sherwood v Walker,384 which concerned the sale of a cow, believed by both 
parties to be barren, for $80. In fact the cow was with calf and her true value was between 
$750 and $1,000. The majority of the court held the contract to be void for mistake on 
the ground that the parties were mistaken as to the substance of the thing sold. There is a 
sense in which the goods here were more than fit for the purpose for which they were sold; 
the court’s holding goes some way to saying that this excess fitness may be so gross that it 
would be unfair to hold the seller to the bargain. The protection thus accorded the seller 
still falls far short of that given to the buyer. He is entitled to complain of any deficiency 
in the fitness of the goods. By conventional modern English standards, Sherwood v Walker 
is probably wrong; certainly it is difficult to believe that the case would be followed if the 
contract were between two business parties. But the decision seems more acceptable if it is 
recognised as a consumer protection case; this would involve a recognition that an individ-
ual seller, selling to a buyer who buys in the course of business, requires greater protection 
than other sellers, just as the individual buyer buying from the seller who sells in the course 
of business has long been recognised to have greater rights than other buyers.
An alternative route by which an exception to the doctrine of caveat vendor, more 
acceptable to modern ideas than the doctrine of mistake, may be justified is as follows. In 
the more-or-less contemporaneous case of Wood v Boynton385 a girl sold a stone the size 
of a canary’s egg to a jeweller, who bought it in good faith professing himself unsure as to

what it was. He paid $1 for it. It turned out to be a diamond. The contract was held not to 
be void for mistake. One possible way of distinguishing Sherwood v Walker is that the par-
ties in Wood v Boynton were clearly contracting on the basis that the nature of the stone 
was uncertain. By contrast, in Sherwood v Walker the parties contracted on the basis that 
the cow was a cow for meat: the price might have been high or low for such goods, but that 
fundamental assumption set the limits of the risks exchanged by the parties. Accordingly, 
when matters proved to be otherwise, the seller might avoid the contract.386 This analysis, 
it will be realised, can also be applied to the doctrine of frustration: events beyond the 
control of the parties have affected the risk exchange intended by the parties.387
Scots law
The Scots law of error has been much controverted and relatively little of the case law has 
been concerned with the subject-matter of sales of goods or with their quality.388 The most 
recent analyses389 have deployed a distinction between error in transaction (one related to 
a provision in the contract) and error in motive (where there will be no relief unless the 
error was induced by the other party’s misrepresentation). Thus if A agrees to sell to B 
a painting declared in the contract to be a Picasso, and it is not, B could reduce the con-
tract for error or sue for breach; while if A had merely represented that the painting was 
by Picasso, B could only claim reduction (unless A’s misrepresentation was negligent or 
fraudulent, in which case B would have a delictual claim for damages). Either category of 
error will generally render the contract voidable. If an error of transaction is a unilateral 
error of expression – as where A, meaning to sell for £10,000, by a slip writes £1,000 – A 
may reduce the contract only if the other party knew or ought to have known of the error.
9 Reform of the English privity doctrine
Privity issues crop up in all kinds of transaction, not merely those involving the buyers 
of goods, and, for the reasons given below, it is considered appropriate to deal with this 
topic in this chapter. According to the privity doctrine in English law, where goods are 
sold by a manufacturer to a retailer, and then by the retailer to a customer, the customer

Stradivarius and Guarnarius turned out to be imitations. Zimbalist was a better fiddler than a judge of 
violins!
387	 Though from an economic point of view it has been argued that discharge should only be allowed where 
the promisee is the superior risk bearer. If the promisor is the superior risk bearer, non-performance should 
be treated as a breach of contract – see Posner and Rosenfield (1977) 6 Jo Leg Studies 83. On this analysis, 
cases such as Krell v Henry [1903] 2 KB 740 are doubtful. For an analysis of mistake in terms of efficiency 
of information gathering see Kronman (1978) 7 Jo Leg Studies 1.

	196	 The duties of the seller
cannot sue on the warranties implied in the contract between the manufacturer and the 
retailer because a person cannot enforce a term of a contract to which he is not a party.390 
In fact, this is only one type of privity question. Four basic privity questions can be 
identified. These are as follows:
1	 Can a person enforce a term of a contract to which he is not a party? (Questions of this 
sort can be labelled ‘P1’.)391
2	 Can a person set up a defence based on the terms of a contract to which he is not a 
party in order to answer a claim brought by a person who is a party to the relevant 
contract (‘P2’)?
3	 Can a contracting party set up a defence based on the terms of his own contract in order 
to answer a claim brought by a person who is not a party to the relevant contract (‘P3’)?
4	 Can a contracting party enforce the terms of his own contract against a person who is 
not a party to the relevant contract (‘P4’)?
According to the doctrine of privity, each of these questions must be answered in the 
negative.392 To answer P1 and P2 in the affirmative would be to allow a third party to take 
the benefit of a contract to which it was not a party; to answer P3 and P4 in the affirma-
tive would involve burdening a person under a contract to which it was not a party.
A modest reform of the privity doctrine has now been effected by the Contracts 
(Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 (which closely follows the draft appended to Law 
Com. No. 242). It modifies the rule in relation to P1 and P2 situations, but not in relation 
to P4 situations. Its application to P3 questions is not at all clear.393
However, since commercial contractors appear generally to be modifying their stand-
ard terms to ensure that the Act does not confer rights on a third party it is likely that in 
practice this will have a minimal application.
The key to the reform is the test of enforceability. By s. 1(1) of the 1999 Act, a third 
party is given the right to enforce a contract term if:
the contract expressly provides that he may; or
subject to s. 1(2) the term purports to confer a benefit on the third party.
According to s. 1(2), the second limb of the test (i.e. the test stated in s. 1(1)(b)) does 
not apply if on a proper construction of the contract it appears that the parties did not 
intend the contract to be enforceable by the third party. To take advantage of these provi-
sions, the third party (as s. 1(3) stipulates):
. . . must be expressly identified in the contract by name, as a member of a class or as answering 
a particular description but need not be in existence when the contract is entered into.394
390	 See Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co v Selfridge & Co Ltd [1915] AC 847. Scots common law has always 
recognised third party rights in contract. For its doctrine of jus quaesitum tertio, see Laws of Scotland: 
Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia (1996), vol. 15, paras 824–52.
391	 This is the problem addressed by the 1999 Act – see below. The following two privity questions are addressed 
by the Act only in relation to the relaxation of P1. The law is under review: see Scottish Law Commission 
Discussion Paper No 157 on Third Party Rights in Contract (2014).
392	 The courts have cited Dunlop v Selfridge as a reason for answering each of the privity questions in the 
negative, though the question involved in that case was a P1 question.

VIII of the Law Commission’s Report, Privity of Contract: Contracts for the Benefit of Third Parties (Law 
Com. No. 242, Cm. 3329, 1996).

	
	 	
The duty to supply goods of the right quality 	 197
Where the test of enforceability is satisfied, the third party has the rights of a con-
tracting party, but no greater rights.395
Lastly, s. 1(5) makes it clear that for the purpose of exercising his right, there shall 
be available to the third party any remedy that would have been available to him in an 
action for breach of contract if he had been a party to the contract, and also the benefit 
of any exclusion or limitation of liability.396 Section 2 contains somewhat complicated 
provisions intended to preserve a third party’s rights in certain circumstances if the con-
tracting parties seek to vary or rescind a contract.
The Law Commission says that the second limb of the test would not normally cut 
across chains of sales contracts to give a purchaser of goods from a retailer a right to 
enforce a manufacturer’s quality promises.397 On the other hand, the Law Commission 
implies that the position might be different where B purchases goods from retailer A, 
making it clear that the goods are being purchased as a gift for C (and with delivery to 
be direct to C).398 Here, the Law Commission suggests that C might have a contractual 
claim against A for breach of the quality undertakings (although it qualifies this by say-
ing that such a claim would be subject to rebuttal by A under the proviso).399 What is to 
be made of this?400 Nothing at all, is one possible view. What the Commission collec-
tively thinks, or what individual Commissioners might think, matters little once legisla-
tion is in force. From that point on, the courts (with or without assistance from Pepper v 
Hart)401 will gloss the statutory framework as they see fit. Another view is that, although 
the Act leaves the operation of s. 1(2) unclear, the Commission’s fall-back position is 
that the parties can always cover themselves by express provision (and, perhaps, should 
be encouraged to do so). Thus, if the contractors do not intend the third party to have 
the right to enforce, they can simply say so and the presumption will be rebutted. Alter-
natively, if the contractors do intend the third party to have the right to enforce, they 
can say so and thereby invoke the first limb of the test of enforceability. Neither of these 
views, however, will satisfy those who want to know where they stand at the time of the 
Act’s coming into force rather than after some later litigation – nor, of course, do they 
assuage the concern about the idea that parties are free to contract out of the reforms 
whenever it suits them.

Exclusion of seller’s liability
Exemption clauses
Many contracts, especially ‘standard-form contracts’, contain exemption clauses the 
purpose of which is to negative terms, such as those found in ss. 13, 14 and 15, normally 
implied in favour of a buyer. In terms of its legality, historically, this was posed no diffi-
culty because s. 55 of the Act (now s. 55(1))1 originally enabled the parties to negative or 
vary, by express agreement, any of the terms which were implied by the Act. Similarly, in 
hire-purchase agreements which did not fall within the ambit of the Hire-Purchase Acts, 
all implied conditions and warranties could be, and invariably were, excluded by the 
terms of the agreement. In cases governed by the Hire-Purchase Acts, however, the right 
to contract out of the implied terms was always severely restricted.
If a seller can freely exclude implied terms intended to improve the position of the 
buyer, that freedom is clearly open to abuse. Although the courts did what they could 
to control the more extreme forms of abuse of this power of contracting out, the posi-
tion became more and more unsatisfactory, as will be seen below.2 Eventually, it became 
clear that the courts could not effectively control unreasonable exemption clauses and 
the position was radically altered, first by the Supply of Goods (Implied Terms) Act 
1973, which greatly restricted the power of the seller to contract out of his liability for 
defective goods and also extended the restrictions formerly applicable to hire-purchase 
contracts. Then, secondly, in 1977 by the Unfair Contract Terms Act, which introduced 
more general controls on exclusion clauses and which replaced the relevant provisions 
of the 1973 Act. On 1 July 1995, the EC’s Directive on Unfair Terms in Consumer Con-
tracts,3 as implemented by the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations,4 came 
into force. These added further controls. However, because in some ways the implement-
ing Regulations did not follow the Directive, they were then replaced by Regulations 
which do so more exactly.5 In 2006, the Law Commissions put forward proposals on 
combining the provisions into a single set of rules,6 but implementation was delayed due 
to uncertainty as to when further European legislation might emerge and what form 
it would take. The legislation emerged in October 2011 in the form of the Consumer

Rights Directive.7 It is this Directive, in part, which prompted the need for, indeed argu-
ably made unavoidable, the wider reform of consumer sales law, in the form of the Con-
sumer Rights Act 2015, although the Directive itself ultimately left the earlier Unfair 
Terms Directive (93/13/EEC) unamended.
The Consumer Rights Act now incorporates a single set of rules controlling 
unfair terms, including exemption clauses, in consumer contracts. This aspect of the 
Act is considered fully in Chapter 22. The result is that the UCTA is now focused 
solely on commercial contracts of sale, and from it are lost the provisions which 
render attempts to exclude liability for the implied terms as to the quality and fitness 
of goods ineffective,8 although, as will be seen, these remain subject to the test of 
reasonableness.
Of course, the body of common law controls on exemption clauses remains intact 
and while in practice, the UCTA renders these rules of much less importance, in deter-
mining whether a term is incorporated into a contract and in cases where the UCTA 
does not apply, it remains applicable. Accordingly, a brief statement of the broadly sim-
ilar common law position in England and Wales and Scotland follows before UCTA is 
closely examined.
If a seller relies on an exemption clause, he will first have to show that the clause was 
incorporated into the contract; that is, that it was part of his offer which was accepted by 
the buyer. He can do this in one of two ways, namely by showing that the buyer has actu-
ally signed a contract incorporating the clause in question, or by showing that the clause 
was brought to the notice of the buyer.
In the first case, the fact that the buyer has not understood, or even read, the contract 
or the clause in question is immaterial.9 Even in this case, however, there are some 
circumstances in which the seller may not be entitled from relying on the exemption 
clause. For example, if the seller has misrepresented the effect of the clause whether 
fraudulently or innocently, he will not be able to rely on it,10 or, to take an example from 
the case law, if it is written on the reverse of the document in another language and the 
buyer’s attention is not drawn to it.11 So also, an express oral statement made by the 
seller may in some circumstances be treated as a term which overrides the terms of the 
written agreement.12 Finally, there are some rare circumstances in English law in which a 
party may plead that the contract was wholly void because the nature or effect or terms 
of the contract were radically different from what he had supposed.13 In the absence of 
fraud, this plea is unlikely to arise in practice in cases of sale of goods because it must

be rare indeed that a buyer (or seller) makes such a fundamental mistake as to justify 
holding the contract to be void.
Secondly, a party to a written contract can rely on an exemption clause, even where 
the other party has not signed it, if he has given reasonable notice of the existence of 
the clause before the contract is made, in such a way as to show that he intends it to be 
an integral part of the contract. This is a general principle of the law of contract which 
is not of such great importance in the law of sale of goods as it is in relation to certain 
other types of contract, and it would be outside the scope of this subject to discuss the 
cases in detail.14
A controversial type of exclusion of liability is the ‘shrink wrap’ licence commonly 
used in sales of computer software. As a condition for acquiring a copyright licence to 
enable the software to be loaded legally on to a computer, whether from some form of 
durable media such a disk or via download, the purchaser is required to agree to the 
terms set out on the packaging (which may be reinforced by assent being required by 
the software itself as it is loaded on to the computer). In Beta Computers (Europe) Ltd 
v Adobe Systems (Europe) Ltd, the facts of which were given previously,15 Lord Penrose 
accepted the efficacy of the shrink wrap licence, the unusual feature of the case being 
that it was in the interests of the acquirer of the software to argue for this, rather than 
the supplier. However, his view that no contract came into existence until acceptance 
of the licence terms is questionable. If he is right, there would seem to be no good rea-
son for confining this to supplies of software, so that in the case of any goods supplied 
with conditions attached no contract would come into existence until the terms were 
accepted. Yet companies which habitually order goods by telephone would be surprised 
to learn that they had no contractual right to them if conditions (of which they had no 
knowledge) happened to be furnished with the goods. In order to avoid the difficulty that 
no contract would exist until the terms of the licence were accepted or rejected, it would 
be better to characterise the contract as a sale on approval, permitting the acquirer to 
rescind the transaction if the conditions are unacceptable.16 It should not in principle 
affect this analysis whether the conditions which it is sought to impose are those of the 
supplier or of a third party.
Lord Penrose was also of the view that when the contract on the shrink wrap terms 
came into existence, it created a jus quaesitum tertio (third party right) in favour of the 
software proprietor. But why? A licence is simply a permission in favour of the user to do 
that which would otherwise be unlawful.17 The proprietor of the software did not need a 
jus quaesitum tertio under the licence since it had the copyright in the software.
It is also unfortunate that Lord Penrose did not address the question as to how his 
analysis that the licence terms constitute an offer which the defender could have accepted

or rejected was consistent with the Software Directive as implemented by the Copyright 
(Computer Software) Regulations,18 which amend the Copyright, Designs and Patents 
Act 1988. The Act gives the lawful user of a program the basic rights necessary to make 
use of the program.19 Since the acquirer already has those rights, why should he or she 
be supposed to surrender those rights in return for no doubt lesser rights conferred by 
the shrink wrap licence? There are, however, good commercial reasons for saying that 
shrink wrap licences ought to be enforceable.20 Perhaps the solution lies in technical 
means of protection. New software now often requires the user to register online.  
A condition of permitting this is that the user is required to accept the conditions 
imposed by the software house. Presumably, if the acquirer is not prepared to accept 
those conditions, he or she is entitled to reject the software. In this case, Lord Penrose’s 
analysis would be more apposite, though modified by the suggestion made above that 
the transaction is a sale on approval.	
Difficulties can arise with regard to contracts made by business parties who use stand-
ard order forms, acknowledgments or similar documents, where the parties attempt to 
incorporate by reference their own standard terms – which of course invariably con-
flict.21 This is the ‘battle of the forms’ situation, which is solved in accordance with gen-
eral contractual principles,22 though not always in a very satisfactory way. The difficulty 
with the usual legal solutions is that they seem to require the court to find either that 
there was no contract at all, or that there was a contract on one or other set of standard 
terms. Frequently, neither of these appears to be a fair or satisfactory result, and a better 
solution would be for the court to find a contract to exist (especially where performance 
has actually taken place), but not necessarily on either set of terms. However, this sub-
ject belongs to the general law of contract rather than to the law of sale, and it cannot 
be pursued here.23
An attempt to avoid the difficulties created by the ‘battle of the forms’ has been made 
following the adoption of the UN Convention on Contracts for International Sales of 
Goods by some 83 states,24 which contains provisions which would deal with some of 
the battle of the forms problems in international sales of goods. Another approach is 
to encourage traders to use identical standard terms of trading. To this end, a standard 
set of trade terms, ‘Intraterms’, has been drawn up.25 These are suitable for domestic 
non-consumer sales, as well as international sales. If widely adopted, they would obviate 
many of the difficulties mentioned in the previous paragraph.

Construction of exemption clauses
Where an exemption clause is incorporated into a contract, important and difficult 
questions of construction may arise.
The approach to such questions has varied over the years, but there is no doubt that 
for many years before the enactment of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977, the courts 
had tended to use strained methods of construction to avoid giving effect to what they 
regarded as unreasonably wide exemption clauses. The first case to reach the House of 
Lords after the passing of this Act, though it was in fact governed by the pre-Act law, 
was Photo Production Ltd v Securicor Transport Ltd.26 In this case, the House of Lords 
made it clear that they deprecated the use of such artificial methods of construction, 
now that legislative methods were available for the striking down of some unreasona-
ble exemption clauses,27 a development that freed the law of a great deal of artificial-
ity, eliminating the fiction of ‘interpreting’ clauses in ways which were almost certainly 
contrary to their true intent, and keeping separate the two distinct questions of, on the 
one hand, interpretation or construction, and, on the other hand, the striking down of 
unfair clauses, properly interpreted.
Unfortunately, after that decision the House of Lords appeared to endorse, in 
Ailsa Craig Fishing Co Ltd v Malvern Shipping Co Ltd,28 a distinction which could 
perpetuate these artificial modes of construction in certain cases. In the Ailsa Craig 
case, the House distinguished between a limitation clause, and a complete exemp-
tion or exclusion clause. A limitation clause is a clause which limits the liability 
of a contracting party (e.g. to damages not exceeding a specified figure) while an 
exclusion clause totally excludes any liability at all from arising. In the case of a 
limitation clause, it was stressed, the clause ought to be given its natural meaning 
without straining. No doubt clear words are still necessary to protect a contracting 
party from the normal results of a breach of contract, but ‘one must not strive to 
create ambiguities by strained construction . . . The relevant words must be given, if 
possible, their natural plain meaning’.29 On the other hand, ‘Clauses of limitation 
are not regarded by the courts with the same hostility as clauses of exclusion: this 
is because they must be related to other contractual terms, in particular to the risks 
to which the defending party may be exposed, the remuneration which he receives, 
and possibly also the opportunity of the other party to insure.’30 The implication 
then was that complete exclusion clauses might remain subject to stricter, and per-
haps still artificial, rules of construction. However, as noted above,31 at least so far 
as the present Court of Appeal is concerned, the move is perhaps away from such 
artificiality.

Exclusion of seller’s liability	 203
The distinction between a limitation clause and an exclusion clause is not very sat-
isfactory for several reasons. First, the distinction between a limitation clause and an 
exclusion clause is often just a matter of degree. If a clause limits a party’s liability to a 
trivial sum which bears no relationship at all to the amount of damage actually suffered, 
it is surely absurd to treat this as something wholly different from an exclusion clause. 
Secondly, exclusion clauses and limitation clauses are often entwined together, as indeed 
they were in both the Photo Production case and the Ailsa Craig case. In both cases, 
there were clauses which protected the defendants from all liability of a certain kind, and 
limited their liability for other kinds of loss or damage. This sort of mix is quite normal 
with certain kinds of exclusion/limitation clauses and once again it seems absurd to dis-
tinguish between the two effects. Thirdly, it must be said that if the distinction survives, 
it will simply complicate the law unnecessarily because counsel will be driven to argue, 
in many cases, first, whether the clause is of the one kind or the other, and secondly, that 
different rules of construction apply in the two cases. All this really seems quite unnec-
essary; all that is needed is that the courts should approach these questions of construc-
tion from the common-sense viewpoint that the more drastic the effects of the clause on 
the claimant’s normal rights, the clearer its words must be if it is to affect those rights. 
Furthermore, the Unfair Contract Terms Act can be resorted to where appropriate.
In George Mitchell (Chesterhall) Ltd v Finney Lock Seeds,32 which is discussed further 
below,33 Lord Denning, in the Court of Appeal, pointed out the unsatisfactory nature of the 
distinction between limitation and exclusion clauses, and suggested indeed that there was 
earlier authority rejecting such a distinction. In the House of Lords, Lord Denning’s judg-
ment was in general endorsed by the Law Lords who rejected the strained and artificial con-
struction placed on the clause in question by the majority of the Court of Appeal, but at the 
same time the House appears to have reaffirmed the importance of  the distinction between 
limitation and complete exclusion clauses, without reference to Lord Denning’s criticisms.34 
It seems certain that this distinction will return to haunt the Supreme Court, and it is very 
difficult to understand why the House of Lords allowed their own decision in the Photo 
­Production case to be glossed in this way; the natural implications of that decision are that 
all such artificial distinctions should be rejected, and contractual clauses construed naturally 
in accordance with their ordinary meaning.35
However, for the present, the distinction still exists. Perhaps it must be accepted that 
exclusion clauses are still to be construed more strictly against the party relying on them 
than limitation clauses. But the general principle that all such clauses which derogate 
from common law rights must be construed contra proferentem; that is, against the party 
relying on them, seems to apply to limitation clauses as well as exclusion clauses.36 In 
Stewart Gill v Horatio Myer,37 which involved a contract for the supply and installation

	204	 The duties of the seller
of a conveyor system, the Court of Appeal held that the effect of UCTA, s. 13 was to 
extend the effect of ss. 3 and 7 (these provisions are discussed below) to catch a ‘no set-
off’ clause. In this case, no argument seems to have been presented about the scope of 
the clause, but in Fastframe Ltd v Lohinski38 the argument that the clause in question 
was apt to exclude equitable, but not legal, set-off (or vice versa)39 was dismissed out of 
hand. In Stewart Gill, Lord Donaldson MR seems to have considered a ‘no set-off’ clause 
to be an exclusion clause because it excludes the right, or the remedy, or the procedural 
rules of set-off. It is submitted that the correct view is that such clauses are properly 
speaking exclusion clauses, as much as are ‘no rejection’ and ‘no refund’ clauses.
Beyond this, it is uncertain what remains of some of the older case law. At least three 
general propositions may be deduced from the great mass of authorities on the subject 
though it may well be that these will now only be applied to exclusion clauses and not to 
limitation clauses, and perhaps not very enthusiastically even then.
In the first place, the courts will interpret exemption clauses strictly, and in particular 
they will attribute precise legal meaning to technical terms. For example, in Wallis, Son & 
Wells v Pratt,40 the plaintiff bought from the defendant seeds described as ‘common English 
sainfoin’, which were, as it transpired, a different and inferior variety known as giant sainfoin. 
The contract contained a term excluding all warranties express or implied. The plaintiff had 
accepted the goods and was therefore precluded by the predecessor of s. 11(4) from rejecting 
them, and was compelled to treat the breach of condition as a breach of warranty. Despite 
this, it was held by the House of Lords that the exemption clause did not protect the sellers. 
The term in question was a condition and not a warranty, and its nature was not altered 
by the fact that the plaintiff was compelled to fall back on his remedy in damages. So also 
in Baldry v Marshall,41 the defendants’ obligation to deliver a car suited to the plaintiff’s 
requirements was held to be a condition and was therefore not excluded by a clause which 
referred only to guarantees and warranties.
One of the most striking of the older cases on the construction of exemption clauses 
is the decision of the House of Lords in Beck & Co Ltd v Szymanowski & Co Ltd,42 
where the defendants had sold to the plaintiffs 2,000 gross six-cord sewing cotton thread 
reels, the length on each reel stated to be 200 yards. The contract provided that: ‘The 
goods delivered shall be deemed to be in all respects in accordance with the contract, and 
the buyer shall be bound to accept and pay for the same accordingly, unless the sellers 
shall within fourteen days after the arrival of the goods at their destination receive from 
the buyers notice of any matter or thing by reason whereof they may allege that the 
goods are not in accordance with the contract.’ The reels had only 188 yards of cotton 
instead of 200 but this fact was not discovered by the buyers until 18 months later. The 
buyers claimed damages. It was held that the above clause provided no defence to the 
sellers, and the ingenious reason given by their lordships for their decision was well sum-
marised by Lord Shaw:43
38	 See n. 27.

to exclude only one unless it mentions both – see White v John Warrick & Co Ltd [1953] 2 All ER 1021.

Exclusion of seller’s liability	 205
The damages are claimed not in respect of the goods delivered but in respect of goods which 
were not delivered.
This seems to have been an example of just that kind of strained and artificial construc-
tion deprecated in recent cases. Today, such a clause would probably be held to be caught 
by ss. 3 and 6 of UCTA as extended by s. 13.44
The same might be said of Minister of Materials v Steel Bros & Co Ltd,45 where a 
contract for the sale of goods contained a term limiting the right to complain of defects 
of quality to a period of 60 days after the discharge of the goods at their destination. 
The goods were damaged as a result of defective packing. The Court of Appeal held 
that the ground of complaint was not the quality of the goods within the meaning of the 
exemption clause. Yet in the converse position it has been held that the ‘quality’ of the 
goods within the meaning of s. 14(2) includes the state of the packing, and that if this 
is unsatisfactory the goods are not of merchantable quality (now satisfactory quality).46 
The case also illustrates another problem arising from the limitation/exclusion distinc-
tion because a time-limit clause of this kind (very common in certain contracts) is nei-
ther a complete exclusion clause nor is it a limitation clause. In R W Green Ltd v Cade 
Bros Farm,47 the facts of which are given later,48 Griffiths J held that it would not be fair 
and reasonable to allow reliance on such a clause.49 It is highly unlikely, therefore, that at 
the present day the court would attempt to limit the effect of such a clause by an artifi-
cial construction of the sort given by the court in this case. It would, no doubt, give the 
clause its normal construction and then apply UCTA.
In the second place, it is a general principle of construction of exemption clauses 
that, where a party would, apart from the particular provisions of the contract in ques-
tion, be liable in the absence of negligence, an exemption clause in general terms does 
not protect him from liability for negligence.50 Negligence must be specifically covered 
by the clause, or at least it must be a necessary inference that it is so covered. Since a 
seller is liable on the implied terms under the Sale of Goods Act irrespective of negli-
gence, an exemption clause in general terms would not exclude the liability of the seller 
for negligence. Again, however, this principle is not of great importance in consumer 
sales since, in these days of manufactured pre-packaged products, the circumstances in 
which a retail seller will be guilty of negligence will be few, and the liability of manu-
facturers etc. will now generally be dealt with under the Consumer Protection Act 1987, 
the provisions of which cannot be excluded.51 But commercial sellers of goods which 
are potentially hazardous or dangerous may sometimes be liable both in negligence and 
44	 See Stewart Gill v Horatio Myer and Fastframe Ltd v Lohinski (above) – there would probably have been 
little room for argument on the case law on s. 13 as it had developed even before those cases: see Adams and 
Brownsword, ‘The Unfair Contract Terms Act: A Decade of Discretion’ (1988) 104 LQR 94.

	206	 The duties of the seller
under the Sale of Goods Act, and in such cases this principle of construction could be 
important.52 On the other hand, clear words must be applied even if the result is to pro-
tect a negligent seller from liability. If it is once found that the clause clearly limits the 
liability of the party in breach, there is no principle which can be applied to confine the 
clause to breaches occurring without negligence.53
Lastly, mention must be made of two particular provisions in the Act bearing on the 
general question of construction. First, reference should be made to s. 55(2), formerly 
(with verbal alterations only) s. 14(4), which says:
An express condition or warranty does not negative a condition or warranty implied by this 
Act unless inconsistent with it.54
Secondly, in addition to exclusion or variation of implied terms by express agreement, 
s. 55(1) says that ‘the course of dealing between the parties’ or ‘such usage as binds both 
parties to the contract’ may have the same effect. So far as usage is concerned, nothing 
need be added to the observations made above dealing with the implication of terms by 
usage,55 for they are equally applicable here. With regard to the expression ‘course of 
dealing between the parties’, this has been judicially explained to mean that previous 
dealings between the parties may raise an implication that certain terms are or are not 
to be included in the contract, if these have or have not been implied on previous occa-
sions.56 ‘If two parties have made a series of similar contracts each containing certain 
conditions, and then they make another without expressly referring to those conditions 
it may be that those conditions ought to be implied.’57 But in order to justify the implica-
tions of terms – and more particularly, it would seem, the implication of terms contrary 
to those normally implied – by reference to a course of dealing, it must be shown that 
in fact there has been a consistent course of dealing in which the same terms have been 
regularly if not invariably incorporated in the past.58 Thus, where over a period of years 
parties have regularly contracted on the basis of certain written terms for the supply of 
goods, the terms may be held to be incorporated in oral contracts for the supply of the 
same goods between the same parties.59 In general, it seems much easier to incorporate 
an exemption clause from a course of dealing in commercial than in consumer transac-
tions, especially in the case of the standard terms laid down by trade associations.60

exemption clause in this case).

Exclusion of seller’s liability	 207
Fundamental breach
In previous editions of this work, extensive treatment was given of this body of doc-
trine. For some 15 or 20 years in the 1950s and 1960s, the English courts attempted to 
achieve some measure of protection for consumers by dealing with harsh or oppressive 
exemption clauses. In retrospect, it is now easy to see this judicial activity as a response 
to a particular social situation. With the great post-war consumer boom well under way, 
with the huge increase in ownership of consumer durables and above all motor vehi-
cles, and with inflation rapidly making nonsense of the early Hire-Purchase Acts,61 the 
courts began to see a steady stream of really hard cases. Most of these cases involved 
contracts of hire-purchase for second-hand cars or other vehicles. Invariably, all liability 
for defects was excluded and frequently real hardship to the consumer was the probable 
result of strict adherence to the law. The courts’ answer to this was the invention of the 
doctrines of fundamental breach62 and fundamental terms.63 Those interested in pursu-
ing the rise and fall of this body of doctrine should consult the standard textbooks.64 
At least in the case of the doctrine of fundamental breach, one of its legacies was the 
original test of reasonableness inserted in s. 55 of the Sale of Goods Act by the Supply of 
Goods (Implied Terms) Act 1973. This provided that a term exempting from all or any 
of the provisions of ss. 13, 14 and 15 of the Act was not enforceable to the extent that 
it was shown that it would not be fair and reasonable to allow reliance on the term.65 
In the event, when these provisions came to be replaced by the Unfair Contract Terms 
Act 1977, it was the view of the Scottish Law Commission which prevailed,66 and the 
test is now that of the reasonableness of incorporating the term into the contract.67 The 
second, more enduring, legacy was the approach laid down by Denning LJ in Karsales v 
Wallis:68
The thing to do is to look at the contract apart from the exemption clause to see what are the 
terms, express or implied, which impose obligations on the party.
This approach is implicit in the drafting of the Unfair Contract Terms Act. It thereby 
rejected Professor Coote’s point that in strict logic an exception clause is simply one 
method of defining a positive obligation.69 Although logical, this argument paid no 
61	 The first Hire-Purchase Act of 1938 only applied where the total purchase price did not exceed £50, and this 
was only increased to £300 in 1951, where the figure remained until 1964.

though the term appeared in the judgment of Devlin J in Alexander v Railway Executive [1951] 2 KB 882. 
For the Scottish position, see n. 63 below.
63	 Insofar as this was an independent doctrine (which was not entirely clear), its origins for present purposes 
may be traced to the judgment of Devlin J in Smeaton Hanscomb v Sassoon & Getty [1953] 2 All ER 1471, 
1473. Note that neither doctrine took root in Scotland, however: see Alexander Stephen (Forth) Ltd v J J

attention to the history of the subject,70 and was rightly rejected.71 In fact, this aspect of 
the Unfair Contract Terms Act has not, in practice, caused difficulties.72
The Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977
The Act is divided into three Parts: the first applying to England and Wales, the second 
to Scotland, and the third to the United Kingdom. It is therefore necessary to have sepa-
rate treatments of the positions under English and Scots law, although the broad thrust 
of the provisions is very similar.
England and Wales
The first relevant provision applies to all contracts, not merely to contracts for the sale 
of goods. Section 3 states:
(1)	 This section applies as between contracting parties where one of them deals on the other’s 
written standard terms of business.
(2)	 As against that party, the other cannot by reference to any contract term—
(a)	 when himself in breach of contract, exclude or restrict any liability of his in respect of 
the breach; or
(b)	 claim to be entitled—
	(i)	 to render a contractual performance substantially different from that which was 
reasonably expected of him, or
	(ii)	 in respect of the whole or any part of his contractual obligation, to render no 
performance at all, except insofar as (in any of the cases mentioned in the above 
sub-section) the contract term satisfies the requirement of reasonableness.
The effects of this clause are extended by s. 13 discussed below.73 The reasonableness test 
for the purposes of s. 3 is that set out in s. 11(1):
. . . that the term shall have been a fair and reasonable one to be included having regard to the 
circumstances which were, or ought reasonably to have been, known to or in the contemplation 
of the parties when the contract was made.
This test is in theory different from that applied in relation specifically to the sale and 
supply of goods provisions discussed below.74
By s. 6(1) of this Act, it is provided that liability in respect of breach of s. 12 of the 
Sale of Goods Act cannot be excluded or restricted by any contract term. Section 12 
is, of course, the section containing the implied conditions as to title. Section 6(1) also 
applies to the corresponding implied condition in hire-purchase contracts in s. 8 of the 
Supply of Goods (Implied Terms) Act 1973. And s. 7 of the Unfair Contract Terms Act

Exclusion of seller’s liability	 209
1977, as subsequently amended, contains restrictions on contracting-out of the similar 
implied terms in all other contracts for the supply of goods, which are dealt with by the 
Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982.75
Section 1A is as follows:
Liability for breach of the obligations arising from—
(a)	 section 13, 14 or 15 of the 1979 Act (seller’s implied undertakings as to conformity 
of goods with description or sample, or as to their quality or fitness for a particular 
purpose);
(b)	 section 9, 10 or 11 of the 1973 Act (the corresponding things in relation to hire pur-
chase), cannot be excluded or restricted by reference to a contract term except in so far 
as the term satisfies the requirement of reasonableness.76
Although s. 6(1) provides that there can now be no contracting out of s. 12 at all, 
this is slightly misleading because s. 12 itself envisages a limited form of contracting-
out in that it recognises the possibility of a sale of a limited interest in goods. The Law 
Commission did not think that there was any reason why a seller should not make it 
plain that he is only selling such title as he may have or, where he acts only as agent, 
such title as some third party may have. But the Commission proposed that even in such 
a case, the seller should be held liable if there should turn out to be some charge or 
encumbrance on the goods known to the seller but not known to the buyer or disclosed 
by the seller. Thus, a seller who, for example, knows that the goods he sells are held 
under some hire-purchase agreement should not be allowed to conceal this fact and 
protect himself merely by purporting to sell only the hirer’s interest in the goods. Section 
6(1) of the 1977 Act gives effect to these recommendations.
The effect of s. 6(1A) on contracting-out of ss. 13–15 is, of course, much more dra-
matic and more radical. Under s. 6(1A)(a), exclusion of the seller’s duties under ss. 13–15 
is only permissible subject to a test of reasonableness. In evaluating the significance of 
these provisions, there are two important matters to be considered: first, the extent to 
which some limited forms of contracting-out may still be possible through the inherent 
operation of ss. 13–15 themselves; and, secondly, the requirement of reasonableness.
Limited contracting-out still possible
Despite the limitations on clauses excluding or limiting the seller’s liability under  
ss. 13–15 of the Act, the drafting of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 does not in 
fact prevent the intention of the parties from having some control over liability under 
these sections. For instance, although the seller cannot escape liability under the implied 
condition that the goods must correspond with their description under s. 13 if the sale is 
a sale by description, yet the question of whether the sale is indeed a sale by description 
is presumably still for the contract itself to determine. So, as we have seen,77 it is still 
open to the court to hold that a sale is a contract for the sale of a specific unique chattel, 
75	 Except that the conditions as to title are subject to the reasonableness test, rather than a prohibition on their 
exclusion or restriction. See below, p. 214 et seq., as to the reasonableness test.
76	 Section 7 also contains analogous provisions to s. 6(1A) with respect to other contracts for the transfer of 
the possession or ownership of goods – see p. 221, Danka Rentals Ltd v Xi Software (1998) 7 Tr LR 74.
77	 Above, p. 130.

	210	 The duties of the seller
and not a contract for sale by description. A seller may use descriptive words in selling 
specific goods, but if he makes it clear that it is for the buyer to examine the goods and 
satisfy himself of their proper description, he may escape liability on the ground that 
the sale is not by description at all. For instance, despite the decision in Beale v Taylor78 
about the ‘1961 Herald’, it seems that if a seller of a second-hand car uses descriptive 
words, but qualifies them by saying that he does not guarantee their correctness, and 
makes it otherwise clear that the buyer must examine the car himself and take it ‘as is’, 
then the seller may escape liability even under s. 13.
In a case such as this, a delicate line would, however, need to be trodden here to 
ensure that the courts do not seriously undermine the provisions of the Unfair Con-
tract Terms Act. The key here, and elsewhere, to problems of this kind may lie in the 
concept of reasonable reliance as was suggested when we discussed Harlingdon & 
Leinster Ltd v Christopher Hull Fine Art Ltd.79 If it is clear that the buyer has rea-
sonably relied upon the words of description used by the seller, it would seem that 
the court ought not to allow the seller to escape liability by claiming that the sale is 
not really a sale by description, but if, on the other hand, a reasonable buyer would 
not have attached any weight to the descriptive words but would have relied entirely 
on his own examination of the goods, the sale may be held not to be by description 
and the seller may be permitted to escape liability. A fortiori, if the buyer actually 
sees that the goods do not conform with the seller’s description it seems impossible 
that he could sue under s. 13. This still gives some weight to the Unfair Contract 
Terms Act; what it does, in effect, is to stress that the totality of the negotiations 
must be looked at, and that the seller cannot, just by procuring the buyer’s signature 
to a document (for instance), eliminate from the picture the fact that descriptive 
words have been used and have been relied upon.
Similar problems may arise in relation to other implied terms. For example, under 
s. 14(2) the seller can point out defects to the buyer and no implied condition that the 
goods should be of satisfactory quality will exist as to those defects,80 so also, if the 
buyer examines the goods, there is no implied condition that the goods should be of sat-
isfactory quality as regards defects which his examination should have revealed. These 
provisions enable the parties to limit the responsibility of the seller despite the Unfair 
Contract Terms Act, with regard to defects which the buyer knew, or clearly ought to 
have known of.
It is to be expected that some sellers may attempt to take advantage of these 
provisions by incorporating written clauses into their conditions of sale, declaring, 
for example, that ‘all defects have been drawn to the attention of the buyer and the 
buyer acknowledges this fact’ or that ‘the seller offers no opinion as to the suitability 
of the goods for any particular purpose and the buyer acknowledges that he does not 
rely on the seller’s skill or judgment’.81 Today, however, it is likely that such clauses

estoppel against the buyer.

	
	 	
Exclusion of seller’s liability	 211
would be regarded as attempts to exclude the liability of the seller by agreement 
under s. 6 of the 1977 Act. An attempt, which to be successful, would have to satisfy 
the ‘requirement of reasonableness. Under s. 14(2) and (3) of the Sale of Goods 
Act, it is the facts which matter and not the agreement.82 The questions under these 
sections will be: Were the defects in fact drawn to the buyer’s attention? Did the 
buyer in fact rely or reasonably rely on the seller’s skill or judgment? It should also 
be noted that where a person deals as consumer or (in Scotland) the contract of sale 
is a consumer contract,83 s. 35(3) provides that the buyer cannot lose his right to have 
a reasonable opportunity to examine the goods under s. 25(2) by agreement, waiver or 
otherwise.
Another way in which, despite the Unfair Contract Terms Act, the seller may be able 
to escape a prima facie liability under s. 14(2) arises from the fact that the concept of 
satisfactory quality is so flexible. Thus, a buyer may actually order goods from a seller 
which are, or would in other circumstances be, of unsatisfactory quality.84 If the seller 
supplies exactly what the buyer has ordered, the buyer may be unable to complain that 
the goods are of unsatisfactory quality. But once again, a delicate line needs to be trod-
den between two types of case: on the one hand, a buyer is clearly not to be deprived of 
his rights under s. 14(2) if, for example, he orders goods under their trade name, and the 
goods supplied, while complying with their trade name, happen to be defective speci-
mens. On the other hand, if the buyer actually provides a detailed specification to the 
seller and says, in effect, ‘Make me these goods to this specification’, and the goods are 
so made in all respects in accordance with the specification, it would be remarkable if 
the buyer could complain that the resulting goods were still not of satisfactory quality. 
Yet the only way to avoid this result, if in fact the goods have defects rendering them 
unfit for normal use, is to hold that the goods, in the particular circumstances of the 
case, are of satisfactory quality despite the defects. Again, the key may lie in the ques-
tion of reasonable reliance: if the buyer who orders goods to be made to a particular 
specification knows what he is doing, and relies entirely on his own ability to draw up 
the specification, the goods ought to be held to be satisfactory. If, however, it is clear that 
the buyer is still partially at least relying on the seller, it may be that the seller ought at 
least to advise the buyer that the goods may turn out to be of no use if made in accord-
ance with the buyer’s instructions.
Problems can also, as already noted, arise with respect to the implied conditions in 
a sale by sample. As we have observed, the two most important conditions in a sale by 
sample are the implied condition of satisfactory quality and the implied condition that 
the bulk corresponds to the sample. But this does not mean that even where prima facie 
the Unfair Contract Terms Act prohibits contracting-out, there is no way in which a 
seller can restrict his liability. Suppose, for instance, that a buyer orders a carpet after 
being shown a sample of carpeting, but he is clearly told by the sellers that they do not 
guarantee that the colours will be identical with those on the sample. If this is actually 
82	 See Lutton v Saville Tractors (Belfast) Ltd [1986] 12 NIJB 1, 19, where Carswell J in the High Court of 
Northern Ireland approved this passage, and held void a ‘declaration’ that the buyer did not rely on the seller 
as a ‘transparent attempt to escape the operation of s. 6(2)(a) of the 1977 Act’.
83	 As to the meaning of these terms, see pp. 208 and 223.
84	 See above, p. 142.

	212	 The duties of the seller
held to be a sale by sample, the sellers will be liable for the failure of the carpet to cor-
respond with the sample, despite the specific warning given to the buyer. However, in 
such circumstances, this may well be regarded as an unreasonable result,85 and it is open 
to the court to hold that the sale is not strictly speaking a sale by sample at all. In that 
event, although the carpet must still be of satisfactory quality under s. 14(2), the implied 
conditions applicable to a sale by sample will not attach.
Lastly, the implied condition in s. 14(3) about fitness for purpose raises similar issues. 
If the buyer does make known the purpose for which he wants the goods, and does rely 
(reasonably) on the seller’s skill or judgment, the seller cannot escape liability by use of 
an exclusion clause, but it is possible for the seller to show that he does not guarantee 
that the goods will be suitable for the buyer’s purposes. He may simply tell the buyer 
that he does not know if the goods will suit the buyer’s needs, or that the buyer must 
make up his own mind as to this. Once again, the key concept is reasonable reliance, and 
in this case the Act recognises this by actually introducing the concept in s. 14(3). If the 
seller can show that the buyer did not rely, or did not reasonably rely, upon his skill or 
judgment, then he is not liable at all, and the application of the Unfair Contract Terms 
Act does not arise. Clearly, it is once again the facts which matter. What the two Acts 
together rule out is the ‘small print’ exclusion clause, and it seems clear that it will not 
help the seller to replace a ‘small print’ exclusion clause by one declaring that the buyer 
has not relied on his skill or judgment, or that the seller gave no opinion on the suita-
bility of the goods for the buyer’s purposes.86 This kind of purely formal agreement will 
not defeat the buyer’s claims, but a real, and reasonable, agreement will show that the 
buyer has not relied upon the seller in such a way as to attract the implied condition in 
the first place.
Exemption clauses affected by the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977
The question as to what precisely is an exemption clause the use of which is regulated 
by the Unfair Contract Terms Act is also one of no small difficulty. As we have seen, the 
words of s. 6 of the Unfair Contract Terms Act say that the liability of a seller under  
ss. 13–15 ‘cannot be excluded or restricted by reference to a contract term except in so 
far as the term satisfies the requirement of reasonableness’. Then s. 13(1) of the same 
Act goes on to say that the Act also prevents:
(a)	 making the liability or its enforcement subject to restrictive or onerous conditions;
(b)	 excluding or restricting any right or remedy in respect of the liability, or subjecting a per-
son to any prejudice in consequence of his pursuing any such right or remedy;
(c)	 excluding or restricting rules of evidence or procedure.
Further, the section adds that it applies to ‘terms and notices’ which exclude or restrict 
liability. Section 13(2), however, makes it clear that this does not prevent the parties 
incorporating an arbitration clause in their contract.
85	 In practice slight differences of colour between the samples and the carpets supplied are very common and 
probably unavoidable.

Ltd, above, n. 82.

	
	 	
Exclusion of seller’s liability	 213
Some things are reasonably clear. An outright attempt to say that implied terms 
do not apply or are excluded, or that some express condition is given in lieu of all 
statutory conditions, must be held to be reasonable otherwise it is simply ineffective. 
Similarly, a clause which says that breach gives no right of rejection would be inef-
fective as excluding ‘a remedy in respect of the liability’ under s. 13(1)(b) above. So 
also a clause which entitles the buyer to have the goods replaced but not to recover 
payment of the price would be void for the same reason. So also would a clause lim-
iting the seller’s liability for damage to a specified figure, or excluding liability for 
consequential losses.
But other points raise much more difficulty. What of a clause attempting to 
exclude or limit the seller’s liability by claiming that a person acting on his behalf 
had no authority to say or do certain things? This question has arisen, and is more 
likely to arise, in connection with clauses attempting to limit or exclude liability 
for misrepresentation, which are not wholly void under s. 6 of the 1977 Act, but are 
subject to the test of reasonableness. But similar questions could arise under s. 6; for 
example, where the seller’s agent has offered an opinion as to the suitability for use 
of the goods being sold, and the seller later claims that the agent had no authority to 
give such an opinion. In the cases on misrepresentation, it has so far been held that 
clauses (or even notices) about the authority of an agent must be treated in accord-
ance with ordinary principles of contract law, and do not fall within the Act’s con-
trol of exclusion or limitation clauses.87 Their effect may be to limit the liability of 
the seller but their validity has not so far been tested by asking what their effect is, 
but by asking whether legitimate legal means have been used to achieve this effect.88 
On the other hand, a different result has been arrived at in a somewhat comparable 
situation, which is where a clause provides that one party is not to rely upon any rep-
resentations made by the other party but is to make his own inquiries.89 Here again, 
the issue arose in the context of a misrepresentation and an attempt to exclude lia-
bility for such a misrepresentation, but the issue is closely analogous to that which 
arises (for instance) under s. 14(3) of the Sale of Goods Act.90
Many other issues still lack authority. For instance, does s. 13(1)(a) of the 1977 Act 
prevent a seller from requiring a claim to be made against him within some specified 
period, or requiring notice of defects in the goods to be given within a certain time? If 
the time is so short that it is not practicable for the buyer to comply with it, then the 
restriction is within the Act, and will be void.91 If the period is not as short as that it 
might be held that this is permissible simply because this would not be a restrictive or 
onerous condition, or alternatively it might be held to be within the Act but valid as 
reasonable.

Bush [1989] 2 All ER 514 which suggests that the first of these conclusions may now be challengeable.

	214	 The duties of the seller
The requirement of reasonableness
With the exceptions noted above in relation to UCTA ss. 6(1) and 13(1), exclusion 
clauses are now subject to the requirement of reasonableness by s. 2 (which deals with 
the exclusion of negligence liability), and s. 3 set out above. As noted at the outset,92 the 
requirement of reasonableness is, at least theoretically, different for clauses relating to 
the implied terms in contracts for the sale or supply of goods, than it is for clauses relat-
ing to other contract terms.93 Moreover, this requirement will operate in a number of dif-
ferent circumstances, of which the most important for present purposes are as follows.94
1	 First, if the exclusion clause does not relate to the implied conditions under the Sale 
of Goods Act, but to some express term of the contract, as, for example, a require-
ment that goods be ‘shipped in good condition’.95 In this case, s. 3 provides that the 
requirement of reasonableness applies if the buyer is dealing on the other party’s 
‘written standard terms of business’.96 The same position holds if the exclusion clause 
relates to some other liability under the Sale of Goods Act; for instance, the quantity 
of the goods to be delivered.
2	 Secondly, if the exclusion clause relates to the implied conditions in ss. 13–15 of the 
Act, the reasonableness requirement97 will apply. It is immaterial whether the buyer is 
buying on the other’s written standard terms of business.
3	 Thirdly, the requirement of reasonableness98 applies to any contractual term exclud-
ing business liability for negligence99 (except for negligence leading to death or bodily 
injury, liability for which cannot be excluded at all).100 In this case, it is immaterial 
whether the buyer is dealing on written standard terms or not. These factors may be 
relevant in the application of the test, but here we are only concerned with the prelim-
inary question, whether it applies at all.
4	 Fourthly, the requirement of reasonableness101 applies to all cases where a clause 
relates to the effect of a misrepresentation, and, here again, it is immaterial whether 
the buyer is buying on written standard terms or not; indeed, the position is the same 
if the clause relates to the liability of the buyer rather than the seller.
In these four cases, therefore, the Unfair Contract Terms Act requires any exclusion 
clause to pass the appropriate test of reasonableness if it is to be upheld. However, it 
will be seen that a number of preliminary questions may be relevant before that test is

concentrates on essentials only. For details, reference to the Act itself is indispensable.

worded, Scottish provision, see the Scots decision, McCrone v Boots Farm Sales Ltd 1981 SC 68, where Lord 
Dunpark said that the term is wide enough ‘to include any contract, whether wholly written or partly oral, 
which includes a set of fixed terms or conditions which the proponer applies without material variation to 
contracts of the kind in question’. See further below.

Exclusion of seller’s liability	 215
applied to the exclusion clause. For instance, it may be necessary to decide whether the 
exclusion clause is incorporated into the contract and what its effect is as a matter of 
construction.102 Secondly, it may be necessary to decide whether the case does indeed fall 
within one of the above four classes of cases – something which may not be nearly so 
clear as may be thought from this summary of the Act. It would be beyond the scope of 
this book to examine these questions in any detail, but a number of critical points must 
be mentioned.
The first is that there may often be problems in deciding whether a clause is indeed an 
exclusion clause which is caught by the Act and so (in these four classes of cases) sub-
jected to the relevant requirement of reasonableness. The difficulty can be illustrated by 
considering the ordinary commercial sale where the contract allows the seller a margin 
of tolerance; for instance, as to the quality or quantity of the goods. If a seller contracts 
to deliver 5,000 tons of grain, but the contract proceeds to give the seller a tolerance by 
saying he may deliver ‘five per cent more or less’, is the seller’s right to deliver five per 
cent less than the contract quantity an exclusion clause, or merely a clause defining his 
obligation? In a simple case of this kind, where tolerances are common (and where exact 
compliance would anyhow not always be practicable) it is surely unthinkable that the 
court would hold the clause to be an exclusion clause at all.
Other cases may be much more problematic. As noted above, there is now author-
ity holding that a clause limiting the authority of an agent to bind his principal is not 
a clause excluding or limiting the liability of the principal within the meaning of the 
Act,103 while a clause simply declaring that one party ‘acknowledges’ that no representa-
tions have been made to him, or that he has not relied on the other party, is within the 
statutory controls.104 The leading authority on this question is now the decision of the 
House of Lords in Smith v Eric S Bush105 where a broad view was taken of the effect of 
the Act. Here it was held that a surveyor engaged by a mortgagee to value a house was 
liable for negligence even though the mortgagee had specifically declared that the valu-
ation was only obtained on the basis that the surveyor accepted no responsibility. The 
argument that this was not a disclaimer subject to the 1977 Act, but a denial of responsi-
bility which prevented a duty of care arising in the first place, was rejected by the House 
of Lords. So where there is or would prima facie be a legal liability, any clause denying 
that liability (no matter how phrased) would appear to be subject to the reasonableness 
requirements of the Act. But where there is not even a prima facie liability because the 
contract is one which does not in itself impose such a liability, this argument presumably 
fails, and the Act will not apply.
These problems are likely to be most important in relation to s. 3 of the 1977 Act set 
out above,106 which contains the general provision subjecting exclusion clauses to the 
reasonableness requirement, apart from clauses excluding the statutory implied terms 
under the Sale of Goods Act. It will be seen that two alternative cases are contemplated 
here. Under the first, a clause is caught by the section if it excludes or restricts a liability

	216	 The duties of the seller
in the ordinary way (s. 3(2)(a)). Under the second, even where this is not the case – that 
is, even where the clause does not appear to be an exclusion clause in the ordinary sense – 
the section will bite if the effect of a clause is to permit a performance substantially 
different from that which could reasonably be expected, or no performance at all (s. 3(2)
(b)). To some extent, this last provision may be said to be a statutory recreation of the 
old doctrine of fundamental breach, though its results are very different from those of 
that doctrine.
The next question which arises with cases falling into these four groups; that is, where 
the test of reasonableness is to be applied, is the ordinary question of construction. 
For whether the clause is held inapplicable to the circumstances which have occurred 
as a matter of construction or whether it is held ineffective under the statute, the result 
will be the same. But in the present group of cases, it is to be assumed that ordinary 
principles of construction will remain more important, for if the exclusion clause is 
found not to cover the events which have occurred, then there will be no need to apply 
the reasonableness test at all.
If, on the other hand, the construction question leads to the conclusion that the clause 
is intended to apply to the events which have occurred, the court must then go on to 
answer the reasonableness question. But it is unlikely that the old rules of construction 
will continue to be applied as though nothing has changed as a result of the 1977 Act. 
It is clearly misleading to suggest that the traditional rules of construction of exclusion 
clauses are ordinary rules of interpretation designed to ascertain the real intent of the 
parties. Frequently they were used to defeat the intent of the parties and instead, to give 
effect to the courts’ views as to what was fair and reasonable. There are distinct signs 
in the decisions of the House of Lords in the Securicor and Ailsa Craig cases,107 and 
also in the first House of Lords’ decision on the reasonableness condition,108 that things 
have moved in this direction.109 But some decisions suggest110 that a residue of the old 
law may remain.111 At present, the position appears to be that total exclusion clauses, 
and also cases of fundamental breach, may still be subject to somewhat strict rules of 
construction, while limitation clauses (at least if there is no fundamental breach) are 
to be construed in their ordinary, natural meaning. This distinction has been criticised 
above,112 and, as suggested,113 it would not be surprising if strict methods of construing 
all exclusion clauses were abandoned on the ground that the problem could be better 
coped with by use of the Unfair Contract Terms Act.114

of the oil for any particular purpose or otherwise which extend beyond the description of the oil set forth

Exclusion of seller’s liability	 217
The reasonableness test is itself set out in s. 11 of the 1977 Act, and as we have noted 
differs at least in theory according to whether the appropriate provision is s. 11(1) or  
s. 11(2). In relation to the latter provision, there are guidelines set out in Sch. 2.115
Section 11(1) was set out above.116 The first point to note about this section is that 
it requires that the term should have been fair and reasonable at the time when it was 
included in the contract. As noted above, this is somewhat different from the require-
ment of reasonableness which was originally contained in the Misrepresentation Act and 
in the Supply of Goods (Implied Terms) Act 1973, both of which were replaced by the 
new provisions.117 Under the earlier Acts what had to be shown was that reliance on the 
exclusion clause was fair or reasonable. The difference is quite significant because a very 
wide exclusion clause may easily be held to be unreasonable under the new Act, even 
though it would have been quite reasonable to have a narrower exclusion clause which 
would have actually covered what has in fact happened. Under the earlier Acts, reliance 
on the clause might well have been held fair and reasonable; under the new Act, it might 
be held unreasonable.118 One effect of the Act could have been to compel those respon-
sible for drafting standard conditions of contract to limit the width of exclusion clauses 
in the hope that narrower clauses were more likely to be upheld as reasonable. It is not 
permissible to maintain very broad unreasonable clauses and then claim that reliance on 
the clause in particular narrow circumstances is not unreasonable.
The next part of s. 11 which needs to be noted is s. 11(4), which states that where an 
exclusion clause seeks to restrict the liability of a party to ‘a specified sum of money’, 
regard is to be had in particular to:
(a)	 the resources which he could expect to be available to him for the purpose of meeting the 
liability should it arise; and
(b)	 how far it was open to him to cover himself by insurance.
Section 11(5) goes on to say that the onus is on the party who claims an exclusion 
clause is reasonable to satisfy the court that it was.
The guidelines in Sch. 2 are more or less the same as those which were originally 
contained in the Supply of Goods (Implied Terms) Act, and they do not, strictly speak-
ing, apply in all cases where the reasonableness test has to be applied but only to cases 
involving contracts for the sale (or supply) of goods.119 The court must have regard to the 
following, where relevant:
(a)	 the strength of the bargaining positions of the parties relative to each other, taking into 
account (among other things) alternative means by which the customer’s requirements 
could have been met;
115	 Though, as noted below, in applying the test of reasonableness under s. 11(1), courts tend to take into 
account the guidelines of Sch. 2.
116	 See pp. 208–209.
117	 The present provisions reflect the recommendations of the Scottish Law Commission.
118	 This emerges quite clearly from the judgment of Lord Denning in the Howard Marine case [1978] QB 
574 where he held (under the original Misrepresentation Act) that reliance on the exclusion clause was 
reasonable, even though the clause as a whole was possibly unreasonably wide. The majority of the court, 
however, held that even reliance on the clause was unreasonable (though they gave no reasons).
119	 But they have been taken into account – see Danka Rentals Ltd v Xi Software (1998) 7 Tr LR 74; and see 
Farrans Construction Ltd v Ready Mixed Concrete (Scotland) Ltd 2004 GWD 13-283 (Outer House, Court 
of Session).

	218	 The duties of the seller
(b)	 whether the customer received an inducement to agree to the term, or in accepting it had 
an opportunity of entering into a similar contract with other persons, but without having 
to accept a similar term;
(c)	 whether the customer knew or ought reasonably to have known of the existence and extent 
of the term (having regard, among other things, to any custom of the trade and any previ-
ous course of dealing between the parties);
(d)	 where the term excludes or restricts any relevant liability if some condition is not complied 
with, whether it was reasonable at the time of the contract to expect that compliance with 
that condition would be practicable;
(e)	 whether the goods were manufactured, processed or adapted to the special order of the 
customer.
Even now, only one sale of goods case120 on the modern statutory control of 
exception and limitation clauses121 reached the House of Lords, (none have come 
before the Supreme Court) and it is appropriate to begin with that case. It must be 
noted at the outset, however, that this case was governed by the provisions subse-
quently contained in the Sale of Goods Act 1979.122 The significance of this is dealt 
with below. The case was George Mitchell (Chesterhall) Ltd v Finney Lock Seeds 
Ltd123 where the plaintiffs were farmers who had ordered late cabbage seed from 
the defendants who were seed merchants. They were supplied with an inferior seed 
which was not indeed a late cabbage seed at all. The plaintiffs suffered considerable 
losses (over £60,000) which were not (it was stressed in the House of Lords) purely 
losses of profit; the losses included large sums of wasted expenditure in planting and 
later clearing the fields where there was a total crop failure. The contract contained 
a clause limiting the defendants’ liability to the cost of replacing or refunding the 
price of the seeds sold – a relatively trivial sum. It was held that, applying the ordi-
nary meaning of the words, the limitation clause did apply to the circumstances, but 
it was void under the Unfair Contract Terms Act as unreasonable.
In arriving at the second part of this decision, which is the material part for present 
purposes, the House of Lords balanced a number of considerations. In favour of the sell-
ers was the fact that the parties knew and understood the terms clearly enough, and also 
that the damages claimed were out of all proportion to the price. But, in favour of the 
buyers, it was pointed out that (1) all seeds were sold on these terms by seed merchants – 
buyers had no opportunity to pay more and obtain protection from such risks, (2) the 
sellers could insure against this kind of liability without a material increase in the price 
of seeds, (3) the sellers had been negligent in supplying the wrong kind of seed, and  
(4) most important of all, it was shown that seed merchants did often negotiate settle-
ments and offer some compensation where they were convinced that claims of this kind 
were genuine. This last factor was considered almost decisive by the House of Lords 
because it demonstrated that those in the trade did not themselves think it reasonable 
to rely on the limitation clauses in their full rigour. It suggested rather that the purpose 
of the clause was to enable the sellers to decide which claims to pay and which to reject,

credit case: Director General of Fair Trading v First National Bank plc [2002] 1 All ER 97 – see Chapter 22.

without control from the courts. In effect, the purpose of the clause thus seems to have 
been to enable the sellers to be judges in their own cause, rather than to exclude or limit 
their liability.
Two further points should be made about the George Mitchell case. The first is that, 
as noted above, because of the time when the facts arose, the case was governed by pro-
visions subsequently contained in the Sale of Goods Act 1979 and not by the Unfair 
Contract Terms Act. Although the present Act is almost identical with the 1979 Act on 
many points, there are a number of points of difference; for instance, the 1979 Act pro-
vided that exclusion clauses were void ‘to the extent that’ they did not comply with the 
requirement of reasonableness; the present Act declares that the implied conditions in 
ss. 13–15 can only be excluded by a term ‘insofar as the term satisfies the requirement 
of reasonableness’. In the George Mitchell case, it was thought by the House of Lords 
(though no definite opinion was expressed) that the former of these provisions did not 
authorise a court to sever the offending part of an exclusion clause and uphold the 
remainder. In Stewart Gill Ltd v Horatio Myer & Co Ltd,124 however, Lord Donaldson 
MR said that the issue is whether the term, the whole term, and nothing but the term, is 
a fair and reasonable one to have been included.
A second point of difference between the two Acts is that (as we have previously 
noted) in the 1979 Act the test of reasonableness was to be applied taking account of 
all the circumstances of the case. In George Mitchell, the House of Lords held that this 
meant that the reasonableness of a clause was to be judged having regard to the circum-
stances prevailing at the time of the breach rather than when the contract was made. In 
the 1977 Act, the requirement of reasonableness, as we have seen, is that a term shall 
have been a fair and reasonable one to be included having regard to the circumstances 
which were, or ought reasonably to have been, known to or in the contemplation of the 
parties when the contract was made. In the George Mitchell, case, therefore, the House 
of Lords took account of all the circumstances, including the fact that in the past the 
sellers had not relied on their limitation clause,125 that the supply of the defective seed 
was due to negligence, and that the sellers could have insured against the losses. The fact 
of the crop failure itself was clearly a material circumstance under the 1973 Act; would it 
be material under UCTA? It seems unlikely that the change made by the 1977 Act would 
affect this because the fact of crop failure is obviously readily foreseeable if the wrong, 
or inferior, seeds are supplied by a seed merchant, and if the reasonableness of the term 
limiting liability had been considered as at the time of the making of the contract, this 
foreseeable result would have been just as relevant as the actual result which had to be 
taken into account. But in other circumstances this change made by the 1977 Act may be 
more significant, as already indicated. For instance, a minor breach, with small losses, 
might have been held to make it permissible to rely on an exclusion clause under the 1979 
Act when it would no longer be held reasonable to have included the term in the contract 
within the 1977 Act. Even bearing in mind the differences between the two Acts with 
124	 [1992] 2 All ER 257, 261.
125	 Lord Bridge took it that this indicated that reliance on the clause would not be fair and reasonable. The 
clause in question was a standard in the seed trade, but on the sellers’ own evidence was rarely, if ever, 
invoked – see [1983] 1 All ER 108, 117 per Lord Denning MR. For a critique of Lord Bridge’s approach, see 
Adams and Brownsword (1988) 104 LQR 94.

	220	 The duties of the seller
which the respective courts were concerned, it must be admitted that George Mitchell 
seems to represent a more interventionist approach to commercial contracts than the 
House of Lords seemed to signal in Photo Production.126
By comparison with the George Mitchell case, a different result was reached in 
R W Green Ltd v Cade Bros Farm127 where the contract was for the sale of seed 
potatoes by potato merchants. Here, too, the contract excluded liability for conse-
quential damage and limited the responsibility of the sellers to returning the price. 
The potatoes proved to be infected with a virus which was not detectable in advance 
(by sellers or buyers) and the buyers suffered loss. Thus far, the facts were almost on 
all fours with those in George Mitchell, but one important difference was that the 
potatoes in question were uncertified, and hence somewhat cheaper. Certified pota-
toes were free from the virus infection. In the result, Griffiths J upheld the limitation 
clause as reasonable though he struck down as unreasonable a clause requiring the 
buyers to give notice of a claim within three days of delivery. This was impractical 
because the fault could not be discovered until the potatoes began to grow, so the 
clause was clearly unreasonable. This case was not mentioned in the speeches in the 
House of Lords in George Mitchell, so it is uncertain whether it survives that case, 
but it would seem clearly distinguishable, both on the ground that the buyer had the 
choice to buy certified potatoes, and also on the ground that there was no negligence 
on the part of the sellers.
Amongst other decisions on the reasonableness requirement, brief mention may be 
made of a few. In Stag Line Ltd v Tyne Repair Group Ltd (‘The Zinnia’),128 Staughton J 
suggested that the fact that terms are in very small print or difficult to understand, 
is an argument against their reasonableness.129 In Rasbora Ltd v JCL Marine,130 the 
subject-matter of the sale was a power boat sold for some £22,000. As a result of serious 
electrical faults, the boat caught fire and sank on its first outing. Lawson J held that 
in fact the sale was a consumer sale so that the exclusion clause was void insofar as it 
excluded the implied conditions under the Sale of Goods Act. But he went on to say that 
even if the sale had not been a consumer sale, he would have held the exclusion clause 
unreasonable inasmuch as it purported to exclude completely the implied condition 
of merchantability. In R & B Customs Brokers Co Ltd v United Dominions Trust,131 
where a car was bought by a company for the use of a director, on conditional sale terms 
excluding all liability on the part of the sellers (who were mere financiers), it was held 
that the sale was a consumer sale, which would now not therefore fall within the ambit 
of UCTA, but the court was inclined to think that if it had been a non-consumer sale 
the requirement of reasonableness would have been satisfied because the sellers were 
mere financiers who never saw the car, and the buyers were business parties not devoid 
of commercial experience. It is, however, somewhat strange to see it suggested that mere

Exclusion of seller’s liability	 221
financiers can reasonably exclude their liability in credit sales because for a very long 
time the hire-purchase legislation has imposed liability on financiers just as though they 
were sellers.132
In the Howard Marine case,133 which has been referred to previously and which 
involved the former s. 3 of the Misrepresentation Act, Lord Denning gave his reasons 
for regarding the exclusion clause as reasonable. The parties were of equal bargaining 
position, the representation was quite innocent and the plaintiffs (on the misrepresenta-
tion issue) could have discovered the truth themselves by further inquiry. The majority 
of the court held the exclusion to be unreasonable without giving any reasons for their 
decision, other than to say that the matter was one of discretion for the trial judge, who 
was entitled to find the clause unreasonable. This last point may prove to be of some 
importance because the House of Lords in the George Mitchell case has stressed that 
appeals on the question of reasonableness will broadly not be entertained. The decision 
on a reasonableness question is primarily for the trial judge and appeals will only be 
available where he has gone wrong in principle, or perhaps has failed to take account of 
the relevant considerations.134
Decisions on the application of the test of reasonableness have continued to be 
handed down relatively infrequently. A more recent illustration of the approach of the 
courts and an indication of their approach when the implied terms are excluded but 
replaced with an alternative regime for making good defects in quality is to be found in 
Air Transworld v Bombardier.
The next case to be mentioned concerned not a contract of sale but of hire. In Phillips 
Products v Hyland and Hamstead Plant Hire,135 the plaintiffs hired a crane and driver 
for a short period from the defendants. The driver, through negligence, caused damage 
to the plaintiffs’ own factory, but the conditions of hire excluded liability for the negli-
gence of the driver. The condition was held to be unreasonable on the ground that the 
hire period was short, and the plaintiffs had little time to arrange insurance, and were 
not regular hirers of such equipment.136 However, a great deal of mechanical plant is 
regularly hired under similar conditions to these, so further litigation on this question 
may be expected.137 Danka Rentals Ltd v Xi Software138 is a case from outside the field 
of mechanical plant hire. In this case, an exemption clause which purported to exclude

Discretion’ (1988) 104 LQR 94.
135	 (1985) 4 Tr LR 98.
136	 The standard form clause in question, clause 8 of the Model Conditions of the Construction Plant Hire 
Association, has since been reworded to include a duty on the part of the owner to provide a competent 
operator. It is believed that this change was made having regard to the words of Slade LJ [1987] 2 All ER 
620, 630. On these provisions generally, see Adams, Commercial Hiring and Leasing (1989, Butterworths), 
para. 6.103 et seq.
137	 Indeed, in two cases following soon after Phillips v Hyland – Paul v Ruddle Bros (26 April 1985, unreported) 
and Thompson v Lohan Plant Hire Ltd [1987] 2 All ER 631 – it was distinguished. In these latter cases, the 
relevant issues against which the reasonableness of the clause fell to be determined were between the owner 
and the hirer, rather than between either of them and the injured third party. In most such cases, the dispute 
is, in reality, between insurance companies.

	222	 The duties of the seller
all express and implied warranties in a lease of a photocopier, which turned out to be a 
‘complete disaster’, was held to be too wide and therefore unreasonable.139
Reference may be made again to the House of Lords’ decision in Smith v Eric S 
Bush140 although this was not a sale of goods case. In this case, it was held that it was 
not reasonable under the 1977 Act for surveyors who value houses on behalf of mortga-
gees to disclaim all liability for negligence towards the purchaser who in reality pays the 
surveyor’s fees, though through the mortgagee. This decision was based on the general 
view that purchasers (at any rate in ordinary house-purchase transactions) have little or 
no bargaining power on these matters, especially because the arrangements are made by 
the mortgagee, and that it is impractical and expensive for purchasers to protect them-
selves by commissioning a second survey on their own behalf. Much of this reasoning is 
directed to the peculiar nature of the average house-purchase transaction and is unlikely 
to be especially relevant to the law of sale of goods. But there is one point about the deci-
sion which may be of wider importance. It emerged during the case that some building 
societies actually gave the house purchaser an option between obtaining a survey with 
liability and obtaining a survey without liability, and it might have been thought that this 
at least would have been reasonable in terms of the 1977 Act. But it also emerged that 
the additional cost of the survey with liability was so great that few buyers took advan-
tage of it, and the judges were clearly doubtful whether the additional charge was truly 
justified. So it seems that, where options of this character are offered to a buyer, it may 
be necessary to show that the extra charge for the option which carries liability is itself 
a justifiable charge if the reasonableness requirement is to be satisfied. The availability 
of insurance cover is a relevant consideration in determining reasonableness,141 as the St 
Albans City and District Council case discussed in the next paragraph illustrates.
The case of St Albans City and District Council v International Computers 
Ltd142 involved a number of interesting questions. The defendants had installed a 
computerised database for the plaintiffs’ community charge register. An error in 
the software significantly overstated the population in the area, and as a result the 
plaintiffs lost £1,314,846.143 The contract contained a clause limiting the defendants’ 
139	 Since the contract was on the lessor’s standard terms the judge applied both ss. 3 and 7 to trigger the tests 
of reasonableness, and suggested that although the guidelines set out in Sch. 2 apply only in relation to the 
latter, it made little practical difference as there was nothing to prevent him from taking into consideration 
the guidelines in relation to s. 3.

(unreported), which also involved a computer software installation, and was made between two substantial 
concerns, but again the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 was applied. It was held that the onus was on the 
defendants, under s. 11(5), to show that the term was reasonable and the defendant had failed to discharge 
the burden. Compare SAM Business Systems Ltd v Hedley & Co (a firm) [2002] EWHC 2733 (TCC), where 
the software installation contract provided machinery whereby the purchaser could get its money back, 
and the exclusion of liability for breach and misrepresentation was upheld as reasonable. In Messer UK 
Ltd and anor v Britvic Soft Drinks Ltd and ors [2002] EWCA Civ 548 330–1 it was pointed out that the 
provision of software is an exercise notoriously liable to give rise to problems, and that an ordinary supply 
of manufactured goods, CO2 gas, is different. Accordingly, an exemption clause in such a supply contract 
was held to be unreasonable – see also Bacardi-Martini Beverages Ltd v Thomas Hardy Packaging Ltd 
[2002] EWCA Civ 549.
143	 This amount was reduced by the Court of Appeal for reasons not germane to the present discussion.

loss to £100,000. Scott Baker J held that this term was subject to s. 3 of UCTA and 
that in addition either s. 6 or s. 7 applied.144 Section 11(4) also applied because the 
defendants sought to restrict their liability to a specified sum. Under this latter 
provision, in considering the question of reasonableness, regard had to be paid 
to the defendants’ resources to meet potential liability and how far it was open to 
them to obtain insurance cover. He went on to hold that the following factors had 
to be taken into account: that the parties were of unequal bargaining power; that 
the defendants had not justified the figure of £100,000, which was small in relation 
to the potential risk and the actual loss; that the defendants held an aggregate of 
£50 million insurance cover worldwide; and the practical consequences. On the last 
point, he went on to ask which one of the two parties was the better loss bearer. 
The defendants were well able to insure, and had insured and no doubt passed 
the premium on to their customers. If the loss were placed on the plaintiffs, it 
would be borne by the local population in the form of increased taxes or reduced 
services. These factors outweighed the fact that bodies such as the plaintiffs and the 
defendants should be free to make their own bargains, that the plaintiffs contracted 
with their eyes open, and that these limitations were common in the computer 
industry, which was an area of developing technology (in fact only two or three 
companies offered competing software packages, and each used similar terms). The 
burden was on the defendants to show the clause was fair and reasonable, and they 
had not discharged the burden.
Scots law
Part II of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 provides the Scottish version of the con-
trols just described. While the broad thrust of this Part is very similar to that for Eng-
land and Wales, the language and structure are rather different. But in this section, there 
will be reference back as appropriate to the previous section, since English authorities 
on the Act can be, and indeed are, cited freely in Scotland despite the differences in the 
statutory wordings.
Exemption clauses in contracts generally, that is not just in contracts for the supply of 
goods, are controlled by s. 17, which corresponds to s. 3 of the English and Welsh Part of 
the Act.145 But this section now applies only to clauses in standard form contracts.
A standard form contract is not defined in the Act. However, the protections of  
s. 17(1) are for the benefit of the customer, who is defined as a party to a contract 
on the other party’s written standard terms of business.146 Thus, the contract must 
be in writing or refer to written standard terms.147 It has been held at first instance 
that the terms in question must be those of the supplier rather than ones in general 
144	 From which it appears he considered the contract in question to involve a sale or supply of goods – see 
p. 52 et seq. for a discussion as to whether a software contract involves a sale or supply of goods. On the 
approach taken by the judge the outcome would have been the same, however, even if no sale or supply of 
goods were involved – see ibid.

use in a particular industry or sector.148 The proponer of the standard terms must 
deal in the course of business. But unlike a consumer contract, the customer can 
also be dealing in the course of business, that is, a standard form contract can be 
between two businesses. In a standard form contract, the majority of the terms are 
prearranged and not subject to negotiation; that is, the terms offered are the same 
for all the party’s transactions. Where, for example, the price of goods or services 
is altered for particular transactions, the contract will still be on standard terms if 
none of the other terms is altered. A proof may be necessary to establish that the 
contract is a standard form one.149
Provided the contract is a standard form contract, any clause which enables a party:
(a)	 who is in breach of a contractual obligation to exclude or restrict any liability of his to the 
customer150 in respect of the breach; or
(b)	 in respect of a contractual obligation, to render no performance, or to render a perfor-
mance substantially different from that which the customer reasonably expected from the 
contract,
has no effect if it was not fair and reasonable to incorporate the term into the contract.151 
The onus rests on the party wishing to rely on the clause to establish that it was fair and 
reasonable to incorporate the clause.152
Further rules apply specifically to contracts of sale of goods and hire-purchase 
contracts under ss. 20 and 21 of the Act, which correspond to ss. 6 and 7 in the Eng-
lish Part.153 In all non-consumer sales – including sales between private parties – and 
hire-purchase agreements, an exemption clause excluding the implied obligation of 
the seller or hirer to pass good title is void.154 In consumer sales and hire-purchase, 
any clause excluding or restricting the implied obligation that the goods conform 
to description or sample, or to their reasonable quality or fitness for purpose, is 
unenforceable unless it is shown to have been fair and reasonable to incorporate the 
clause.155 There are similar controls in respect of the contract of barter, contracts for 
the supply of works and materials and contracts of hire which are non-consumer in 
nature.156
Section 16(1), which is the equivalent of s. 2 in the English Part of the Act, pro-
vides that where an exemption clause in a non-consumer contract or notice excludes

course of business.
156	 Section 21.

	
	 	
Exclusion of seller’s liability	 225
or restricts liability for breach of duty arising in the course of any business or from 
the occupation of business premises, the term or provision is void if it purports to 
exclude or restrict liability in respect of death or personal injury.157 Personal injury 
includes any disease and any impairment of a person’s physical or mental condi-
tion.158 When the clause excludes or restricts liability for breach of duty in respect 
of damage to property or economic loss, the clause has no effect unless the party 
relying on the clause can show it was fair and reasonable to incorporate the clause 
into the contract or non-contractual notice.159 Breach of duty is breach of a contrac-
tual obligation to take reasonable care or exercise reasonable skill in performance 
of the contract, breach of the common law delictual duty to take reasonable care or 
exercise reasonable skill and breach of the duty of reasonable care imposed by s. 2(1) 
of the Occupiers’ Liability (Scotland) Act 1960.160 It does not matter whether the 
breach occurs as a result of an intentional act or negligence, while liability can be 
direct or vicarious.161 Thus s. 16 provides an important control in respect of clauses 
exempting a business from delictual liability or liability for breach of contract which 
arises from a party’s negligence.
What kinds of clauses are caught by the Act?162 The sections quoted above often refer 
to the ‘exclusion or restriction’ of liability. The Act states that this includes:
(a)	 making the liability or its enforcement subject to any restrictive or onerous 
conditions;
(b)	 excluding or restricting any right or remedy (e.g., rejection or damages) in respect of 
liability, or subjecting a person to any prejudice in consequence of his pursuing any 
such right or remedy;
(c)	 excluding or restricting any rule of evidence or procedure;
but this does not include an agreement to submit any question to arbitration.163 
Section 17 also refers to clauses which allow a party to render no performance, 
or to render a performance substantially different from that which the customer 
reasonably expected from the contract. In Macrae & Dick v Phillip,164 the defender 
purchased a Rolls-Royce from the pursuers and then attempted to re-sell it in the face 
of a pre-emption clause in favour of the sellers contained in the original contract 
of sale. When the sellers sought to enforce this clause, the defender argued that it 
enabled the pursuers to render a performance substantially different from that which 
he had reasonably expected; namely a right to prevent him selling to whomsoever he 
wished. In the face of evidence that the defender had been well aware of the clause

	226	 The duties of the seller
at the time of contracting, his argument was unsuccessful, but the case illustrates 
the potential reach of s. 17 going well beyond the conventional exemption clause.165
The reasonableness test is set out in s. 24. The reasonableness and fairness of the 
incorporation of the exemption clause is determined by having regard to the circum-
stances which were, or ought reasonably to have been, known to or in the contempla-
tion of the parties at the time the contract was made.166 Where, however, the exemption 
clause is in a non-contractual notice, whether or not it is fair and reasonable to rely on 
the notice is determined in accordance with all the circumstances when liability arose.167 
When applying the test in the context of ss. 20 or 21, the court is expressly enjoined to 
consider ‘in particular’ the factors in Sch. 2 to the Act;168 however, there is nothing 
to prevent them also being taken into account in any case when the reasonableness test 
is applied or, in supply of goods cases, taking other factors into account. When a lim-
itation clause ‘purports to restrict liability to a specified sum of money’, the court has 
to have regard to (1) the resources of the party relying on the clause to meet the liability, 
and (2) how far it was open to that party to cover itself with insurance.169 Once again, 
it is submitted that these factors – in particular the availability of insurance – can, and 
indeed should, be considered in any application of the reasonableness test and are there-
fore not restricted to limitation clauses. A clause is fair and reasonable if it has been 
approved by a competent authority which is not a party to the contract.170
In Knight Machinery (Holdings) Ltd v Rennie,171 the court was called upon to adju-
dicate upon the fairness and reasonableness of a clause which provided that a buyer was 
deemed to have accepted defective goods unless he had given notice of the defect to the 
seller within seven days of receipt of the goods. Since teething problems were common 
with the machinery bought in this case an Extra Division of the Court of Session held 
that it was not reasonable at the time of the contract to expect that it would be practi-
cable for the buyer to give the requisite notice. The court rejected the seller’s contention 
that the clause only demanded that the buyer should inform the seller that he was having 
problems with the machine. Before it could pass the reasonableness test, the least that 
could be expected of a term conceived wholly in the interests of its proponer, at the 
expense of the other party’s rights, was that the term should be clear and unambiguous. 
On the other hand, in Denholm Fishselling Ltd v Anderson172 a clause in a standard form 
contract used by fishsellers, placing an onus upon buyers to satisfy themselves as to the 
165	 See also Elliot v Sunshine Coast International Ltd 1989 GWD 28-1252, in which a holiday company’s clause 
allowing it to alter the form of transport for customers without notice was found to allow it to render a 
performance substantially different from that which a customer reasonably expected as the result of oral 
discussions at the booking point, and that this was unreasonable.
166	 Section 24(1). Compare the English s. 11(1), and see discussion above, p. 214. In Farrans Construction Ltd 
v Ready Mixed Concrete (Scotland) Ltd 2004 GWD 13-283, it was held that while those guidelines do not 
apply expressly to cases under s. 17, they have in practice been taken into account in considering what is fair 
and reasonable under that section (citing Chitty on Contracts §14-082).

quality of fish bought in a busy fish-market, was held to be reasonable, the court taking 
into account both market conditions and the fact that the buyers had alternative sources 
of supply: ‘[T]he fact that one party tenders to the other a set of non-negotiable contrac-
tual terms is not in itself evidence of inequality of bargaining power or that the terms 
themselves are unfair and unreasonable.’173

Part III
The duties of the buyer

This page intentionally left blank

11	
The duty to pay the price
Payment of the price
It is the duty of the buyer to pay the price of the goods he has bought or agreed to buy, 
and, in the absence of a contrary agreement, he is not entitled to claim possession of the 
goods unless he is ready and willing to pay the price in accordance with the contract. 
Whether it is necessary that the buyer should actually have tendered the price before he 
can insist on delivery has been discussed earlier.1
If no time is fixed for payment, the price is due immediately on the conclusion of the 
contract, provided that the seller is ready and willing to deliver the goods. Unless oth-
erwise agreed, the seller is not bound to accept payment in anything but cash, and if he 
does accept payment by bill of exchange he is entitled (in the absence of agreement to 
the contrary) to retain the goods until the bill is met. But if the seller accepts payment 
by a bill not maturing immediately, he must be taken to have agreed to allow the buyer 
credit and cannot claim to retain the goods.
Where the seller accepts payment by cheque (to the extent that these continue to be 
used),2 bill of exchange or other negotiable instrument, this is normally treated as con-
ditional payment only3 and, if it is not honoured, the seller may sue either on the instru-
ment as a contract in itself (in which case he will benefit from procedural advantages)4 
or he may sue on the contract of sale for the price of the goods.5 It is theoretically pos-
sible for a cheque or other instrument to be accepted as absolute payment, so that the 
seller has no further claim if the instrument is not honoured, but an intention to accept 
in absolute payment must be strictly shown.6 Similarly, agreement to furnish a letter of 
credit in payment for goods sold would not normally be treated as depriving the seller of

	2	 In a retail setting, the use of cheques has largely stopped (in 2013 it only accounted for about 1% of all retail 
payments, but still totalling 425 million payments), and business use of cheques in 2013 was around one-
third of the volume a decade previously, totalling at 293 million (see Cheque & Credit Clearing Company, 
‘Key Facts and Figures’, available at http://www.chequeandcredit.co.uk/facts_and_figures/key_facts_and_
figures/ [accessed 22 July 2015].

	4	 In particular, the buyer cannot set up defences based on breaches of contract by the seller in respect of 
defects in the goods or the like; in an action on a cheque, or other bill of exchange, the buyer must first pay, 
and then counterclaim for damages – see, e.g., Jade International Steel Stahl und Eisen GmbH & Co KG v 
Robert Nicholas (Steels) Ltd [1978] QB 917.
	5	 By s. 38(1)(b) of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 the seller is deemed to be an ‘unpaid seller’ when a bill of 
exchange or other negotiable instrument has been received as a conditional payment, and the condition on 
which it was received has not been fulfilled by reason of the dishonour of the instrument, or otherwise.

	232	 The duties of the buyer
his right to sue for the price if, in exceptional circumstances, the goods are delivered to 
the buyer but payment is not made under the credit.7
However, it has been held by the Court of Appeal that there is no general rule that all 
forms of payment deriving from a third party must be treated as conditional payments 
only.8 Each method of payment must be considered in light of all the circumstances, and 
it was held in the same case that payment by credit card (issued by a third party)9 is in 
many circumstances an absolute payment, so that the failure of the credit card company 
to pay the retailer does not mean that the retailer has any residuary claim against the 
customer. Further, the situation is not altered merely because the customer has not yet 
paid the credit card company in respect of the transaction in question. The card holder’s 
liability is to pay the credit card company, and his liability is not affected by the relation-
ship between the credit card company and the retailer.
There are several reasons why this method of payment differs in its legal results from 
payment by cheque. First, in the case of cheques there is no contractual relation between 
the seller who accepts the cheque, and the bank on which the cheque is drawn, so if the 
cheque is not met the seller has no redress against the bank.10 In the case of a credit card 
transaction, however, there is a prior contract in existence between the seller and the 
credit card company under which the company accepts liability for relevant credit card 
transactions, subject, no doubt, to compliance with the specified conditions. Further-
more, it is the seller who chooses to do business with the credit card company,11 while it 
is the buyer who selects the bank with which he banks, and whose cheques he uses. Sec-
ondly, the ordinary credit card transaction leaves the seller with no record of the buyer’s 
address, so it is a reasonable implication that the seller does not expect under any cir-
cumstances to look to the buyer for the price.12 Thirdly, it is the clear understanding of 
all parties that the customer can never be expected to pay twice for such a transaction, 
so if he has paid the credit card company, nobody expects the customer to be liable to

	8	 Re Charge Card Services Ltd [1988] 3 All ER 702. The analysis in this case would also, it would seem, apply 
where payment is by Provident ‘cheque’ and the like. These are treated for VAT purposes as sales at the full 
value of the voucher, notwithstanding that they will be discounted by the finance house – see Kingfisher plc 
v Customs and Excise Commissioners, 7 December 1999 (unreported). Arguably, therefore, if the finance 
house became insolvent, the seller would have no claim against the buyer for the price.
	9	 Some retailers issue their own credit cards, which can only be used in their own stores. If the issuing 
company and the seller are legally the same company, the position is obviously different. Presumably, in the 
event of the seller’s insolvency, the credit terms contained in the credit card contract would control recovery 
of the purchase price from the buyer.
10	 There is an important distinction between the common law rules concerning cheques and that of many civil 
law systems where cheques can operate as assignments of a part of the drawer’s bank account so that the 
payee can acquire rights against the bank. In principle, there is a possibility that an equitable assignment 
might be found to accompany the delivery of a cheque if it could be established that that was the intention 
of the parties – see Farnsworth (1962) 36 Tulane LR 245. In Scotland, the presentment of a cheque for 
payment no longer operates as a completed assignation of any balance held by the bank to its customer’s 
credit (Bills of Exchange Act 1882 s.53(2) as amended by the Banking Act 2009 s.254(4)). For background 
see Cusine [1977] Juridical Review 98.
11	 This is the reason for the suggestion in n. 8 with regard to Provident cheques and the like.
12	 By contrast, when a cheque is taken which is not covered by a cheque guarantee card, the usual practice is to 
require the drawer buyer to write his or her address on the back of the cheque.

	
	 	
The duty to pay the price	 233
pay the seller merely because the credit card company fails to pay the seller. Indeed, in 
the case in question this point was conceded by counsel, who merely argued that if the 
buyer had not yet paid the credit card company the seller ought to be able to intercept 
the money, as it were, and obtain payment direct from the buyer. But the court found this 
an unacceptable implication.
Payment made by cheque backed by a bank guarantee card appears to be different 
from payment by credit card.13 It is true that here also the bank accepts a direct obliga-
tion to meet the payment, assuming it falls within the terms of the bank’s undertaking 
to honour such transactions,14 but this obligation is clearly by way of guarantee of the 
buyer’s obligation which remains primary.15 But the point is anyhow of very little practi-
cal importance because the buyer can be sued on the cheque itself even if he cannot for 
some reason be sued on the underlying transaction.
Where payment is made by cheque and the cheque is later met, the payment relates 
back to the time when it was handed over.16 Consequently, if the cheque reaches the 
seller on the date agreed, he cannot complain that there has been delay in payment, 
provided that it is met in due course. If the seller agrees that the price shall only be 
due on request, he is bound to afford a reasonable time to the buyer for payment after 
making his request,17 and if he writes to the buyer asking him for his cheque the mere 
posting may be a sufficient payment, even if the cheque is stolen en route and cashed 
by the thief.18
Section 10 of the Act says:
(1)	 Unless a different intention appears from the terms of the contract, stipulations as to time 
of payment are not of the essence of a contract of sale . . .
(3)	 In a contract of sale ‘month’ means prima facie calendar month.
It has been said that this section is ‘seriously at odds’ with ss. 27 and 2819 but it 
is submitted that this is not in fact the case. Although it is obviously the duty of the 
buyer to pay the price agreed at the appointed time, the effect of s. 10 is to create a 
presumption that this duty is not a condition. In other words, a buyer who fails to pay 
the price on the day fixed is guilty of a breach of contract for which the seller may be 
able to recover damages if he has in fact suffered any, but he is not entitled to treat the

contract as repudiated and resell the goods elsewhere.20 It is always open to the parties 
to stipulate in their contract that the time for payment has to be of the essence, or to 
provide expressly for circumstances when the seller may cancel the contract for failure 
to pay within a certain period, irrespective of whether this would amount to a repudi-
atory breach.21
Although this rule has been criticised on the ground that it extends compulsory 
credit to the buyer,22 the seller can of course decline to deliver the goods until the buyer 
pays, and there seems no reason why the seller should be entitled to repudiate the 
contract merely because the buyer is late in paying the price, perhaps by only a day or 
two. Indeed, even repeated failure by the buyer to pay on time (e.g. in an instalment 
contract) may not justify repudiation by the seller, at least where there is no serious 
fear that the buyer will not pay at all.23 It can make little difference to the seller in 
the usual way whether he is paid one day earlier or later, and if it does make a differ-
ence he should stipulate for a right of immediate termination, or of resale on default 
in payment by the buyer. Moreover, damages may be obtained for the late payment 
where additional costs have been imposed on the seller24 and, anyhow, interest may be 
awarded to the seller by a court where he has been kept out of his money.25
In any event, the compulsory credit which the seller has to extend to the buyer is 
severely limited, for s. 48(3) provides that:
Where the goods are of a perishable nature, or where the unpaid seller gives notice to the buyer 
of his intention to re-sell, and the buyer does not within a reasonable time pay or tender the 
price, the unpaid seller may re-sell the goods and recover from the original buyer damages for 
any loss occasioned by his breach of contract.
The indirect result of this subsection is to create an exception to s. 10(1) in the case of 
perishable goods, for in such a case the seller may resell the goods without notice to the 
buyer as soon as there is default in payment. As regards non-perishable goods, the period 
of compulsory credit can be brought to an end by the seller giving notice to the buyer of 
his intention to resell.
Although failure to pay the price at the appointed time is not per se a breach of 
condition or a material breach, it was at one time thought that if the delay was of 
inordinate length it might be possible to infer an intention to abandon the contract, 
20	 Payzu Ltd v Saunders [1919] 2 KB 581. An important exception to this is that where the price is to be paid 
by means of a letter of credit opened by the seller, the failure to open the credit on the due date justifies 
immediate repudiation – see Chapter 18. And see also, for a similar case, Warde (Michael I) v Feedex

so that the seller could thus be justified in reselling even without notice.26 But it now 
seems established that this is not a permissible result unless there is some ground on 
which the court can find that the buyer has repudiated the contract, and that the seller 
has accepted that repudiation.27
It is desirable to stress again a point that has also been made before, that the mere fact 
that the buyer is under an obligation to pay the price of the goods does not necessarily 
mean that he can be sued for the price if he fails to pay. The seller’s remedy against the 
buyer for non-payment of the price is often limited to an action for damages, as we shall 
see in Chapter 19.

The duty to take delivery
Under ss. 27 and 28 of the Act (which have been set out earlier),1 it is the duty of the 
buyer to accept and pay for the goods in exchange for the delivery of the goods by 
the seller. We have seen that the general rule is that it is for the buyer to take delivery 
of the goods from the seller’s place of business and not for the seller to send the goods 
to the buyer. We have also seen that the time of delivery of the goods by the seller, or 
the time at which he is to have the goods ready for collection, is prima facie of the 
essence, but that the time for payment is prima facie not of the essence. The question 
now has to be answered whether the buyer’s duty to take delivery at a particular time 
is of the essence.
The general rule seems to be that this is no more of the essence than the time of 
payment2 and, consequently, the buyer’s failure to take delivery of the goods at the time 
agreed does not by itself justify the seller in forthwith disposing of them to someone else. 
But, in accordance with ordinary principles of contract law, if the buyer accompanies his 
failure to take delivery with words or conduct which justify the seller in thinking that the 
buyer is repudiating the whole contract, the seller may accept the repudiation, and he is 
then free to resell the goods and to sue the buyer for damages for non-acceptance.
Moreover, if the contract is for the sale of goods of a perishable nature,3 the buyer’s 
duty to take delivery at the right time is of the essence, and default by the buyer justifies 
the seller in reselling immediately.4 In this respect, the position is also the same in regard 
to payment for, as we have seen, s. 48(3) enables the seller to resell perishable goods with-
out notice to the buyer if the price is not paid when due.
It also seems that in a ‘spot contract’, that is a contract for almost immediate delivery 
and payment, there will be a breach of condition if the buyer fails to take delivery at the 
time agreed.5 It may well be that in such a case there will be a contrary intention which 
makes the time of payment also of the essence.
It is important that the rules as to the times of payment and taking delivery should 
be the same because otherwise difficulties would arise if the seller refused to allow the 
buyer to take delivery on the ground of non-payment. If the seller could transform a 
breach of the term as to payment into a breach of condition as to taking delivery by the 
simple expedient of exercising his lien, this would in effect turn every agreement for time

The duty to take delivery	 237
of payment into a condition. If the time of payment is not of the essence, therefore, it 
would seem illogical (at any rate in ordinary circumstances) to hold that the time for 
taking delivery is of the essence. But there is nothing to prevent an express agreement 
that the time for taking delivery shall not be of the essence, but that the time for payment 
shall be.
It must be borne in mind that even where the time of delivery is not of the essence, 
s. 20 casts on the buyer, where there is delay in taking delivery, the risk of accidental 
destruction of, or damage to, the goods which might not have occurred but for the delay.
Where a contract provides for delivery ‘as required’, the buyer may be under a duty to 
give notice of his requirements to the seller as a preliminary to actually taking delivery.6 
Where a buyer contracts to take delivery of goods as speedily as possible although no 
time limit is actually imposed, he is under an obligation to remove the goods within a 
reasonable time.7 And in such circumstances the measure of damages for breach may, in 
an appropriate case, be the benefit to the buyer rather than the loss to the seller.8
If the contract provides for the delivery of the goods in instalments and the buyer 
wrongfully refuses to accept one or more of them, the question whether the seller may 
treat the whole contract as repudiated is dealt with by s. 31(2). As will be seen later,9 this 
merely provides that the answer to this question depends on the terms of the contract 
and all the circumstances of the case. In practice, the issue usually involves breach by 
the seller rather than the buyer, and it has been held that the question to be considered 
is the gravity of the breach in relation to the whole contract and the probability of its 
recurrence.10
Where the contract does not provide for delivery by instalments, there is nothing in 
the Act corresponding to s. 30(1) entitling the seller to repudiate the contract if the buyer 
refuses to accept some part of the goods only. Whether such refusal amounts to repudi-
ation, therefore, depends on general principles of contract law; that is, on whether the 
breach goes to the root of the contract. Where a buyer refused to take 728 sheep out of a 
total contract quantity of over 6,000, and he was entitled to refuse 448 sheep, it was held 
that the seller could not repudiate the whole contract.11
It should be noted that in some contracts, especially f.o.b. contracts, the buyer’s duty 
to take delivery often involves many incidental obligations; for example, the duty to 
nominate a ship for the transport of the goods, etc. Breach of these duties usually dis-
charges the seller as a necessary consequence.12

The transfer of property
The meaning of ‘property’
Part III of the Act is divided into two sections, headed ‘Transfer of Property as Between 
Seller and Buyer’ and ‘Transfer of Title’. It must be said that there is something rather 
curious about this terminology. The term ‘property’, defined by s. 61 as ‘the general 
property in goods’, is commonly used by lawyers to signify title or ownership, and in 
everyday usage this terminology is also applied to the sale of goods. Yet the Sale of 
Goods Act talks of a transfer of property as between seller and buyer, and contrasts this 
with the transfer of title.1 However, the distinguishing feature of property rights is that 
they bind not merely the immediate parties to the transaction, but also all third parties. 
How, then, can there only be a transfer of property as between seller and buyer?2 Either 
there is a mere transfer of rights and duties from seller to buyer, or there is a transfer of 
property which affects the whole world. Nor is it possible to adopt the solution of saying 
that ‘property’ is here used in its medieval sense of right to possession3 when at least it 
would make sense to talk of a transfer as between seller and buyer. The Act itself pre-
cludes the adoption of this view because it lays down the clear rule that the buyer’s right 
to possession depends either on payment of the price or on the granting of credit, not on 
the passing of the property. In other words, the mere fact that the property in the goods 
has passed to the buyer does not confer on him a title good against the whole world, nor 
does it confer on him the right to possession as against the seller.
This definition is also borrowed by s. 4(1) of the Consumer Rights Act 2015,4 although 
that Act adopts that as the definition of ‘ownership’, which is presumably intended to be 
synonymous with ‘property’ for the purposes of the Sale of Goods Act, as the Consumer 
Rights Act also invokes ss. 17–19 and 20A&B as its regime for the transfer of property 
in consumer sales.
What, then, is this unusual legal conception which the Act calls ‘the property in the 
goods’? The answer can only be given by considering what, precisely, are the conse-
quences which flow from the passing of property. What rights does the passing of the 
property give to the buyer?

in Ho, n. 1 above. For Scottish perspectives, see Smith, Property Problems in Sale (1978, Sweet & Maxwell, 
London); Reid, The Law of Property in Scotland (1996, Butterworths/Law Society of Scotland), paras 624  
et seq.
	3	 This is a loose translation of the complex medieval concept of ‘seisin’.
	4	 The Consumer Rights Act also invokes in their entirety, ss. 17–19, 20A and 20B with the result that 
discussion in this chapter of the passing of property remains equally applicable to consumer sales.

	242	 The effects of the contract
In the first place, what is the position of the buyer if he wishes to obtain possession 
from the seller? The answer, which has already been intimated, is that he can only do so 
if he pays the price or if the seller sees fit to grant him credit.5 Nor can the buyer avoid 
this consequence under English law by framing his action in tort and suing for conver-
sion, basing his claim on the fact that the goods are now his goods. The reason for this is 
that the action for conversion will only lie at the hands of someone with an immediate 
right to possession and this the buyer does not have until he tenders the price.6 Again, 
if the buyer resells the goods before obtaining possession, the sub-buyer can only obtain 
possession on the same terms as the original buyer, that is to say, by payment of the 
price, unless the original seller has assented to the second sale.7 The same applies if the 
buyer pledges the goods instead of selling them. In all these cases, the buyer’s property 
avails him nothing because the position would be precisely the same even if no property 
had passed.
The same is true if the buyer goes bankrupt before delivery of the goods and payment 
of the price. The seller cannot be compelled to deliver up the goods to the trustee in 
bankruptcy, and be relegated to his right to prove in the bankruptcy for the price, even 
though the property in the goods has passed to the buyer. Indeed, quite the contrary, the 
law goes out of its way to protect the seller from the bankruptcy of the buyer by confer-
ring on him the right of stoppage in transit should the buyer go bankrupt after the seller 
has dispatched the goods to him, but before the buyer has received them.8
Suppose, next, that the buyer has actually obtained the possession of the goods. Once 
again, the practical effect of the passing of the property is somewhat limited because 
s. 25(1) of the Act enables the buyer in possession to pass a good title to a third party, 
binding on the first seller, whether or not the property had already passed to the original 
buyer. Moreover, it is arguable that s. 25(1) has the strange result that the buyer, even if in 
possession, and even if he has the property, cannot pass a good title to a mala fide trans-
feree.9 However, it is true that if the goods are delivered to the buyer with a stipulation 
that the seller reserves title and property is only to pass on payment, the seller may be 
able to recover the goods in the event of the buyer’s bankruptcy.10 Moreover, ‘reservation 
of title clauses’ are widely used. This then is a case where the passing (or non-passing) 
of the property may have important practical effects, and indeed, many modern cases 
dealing with the passing of property hinge on these reservation of title clauses. But as 
we shall see later, these clauses have caused serious difficulties, some being void unless 
	5	 Section 28 makes delivery conditional on payment of the price – see p. 99. Indeed, a buyer who takes the 
goods without the consent of the seller, when he has no right to possession, may well be guilty of theft. See 
R v Boardman (1987) 9 Cr App R (S) 74, where the only question was as to the suitability of a compensation 
order.

The transfer of property	 243
registered under the Companies Act 2006, because they amount in substance to the grant 
by the buyer of a charge by way of security, falling under s. 859A(7) of that Act.11
What, then, is the position if the seller, being still in possession of the goods, resells 
them to a third party, whether rightfully or wrongfully? Again the answer is that the 
transfer of property has little effect, for s. 24 enables the seller who is in possession to 
pass a good title to a bona fide transferee, even though the transfer may be wrongful as 
against the first buyer. And since the Privy Council’s decision in Pacific Motor Auctions 
Pty Ltd v Motor Credits (Hire Finance) Ltd,12 it is immaterial in what capacity the seller 
retains possession. Of course, if the goods are actually delivered to the buyer and then 
returned to the seller to hold as bailee he will not be able to pass a good title to a third 
party, but once again the same result would follow if property passed on delivery instead 
of by mere agreement.
The next case to be considered is that in which goods are sold and the property passes 
to the buyer but, for some reason, the seller remains in possession. If the seller becomes 
insolvent, can the buyer claim the goods by virtue of his property? As against the seller 
himself, or a liquidator or receiver, the answer at common law and in Scots law is prima 
facie, yes, but in England sometimes the Bills of Sale Acts or the Companies Act oper-
ate to invalidate the sale or the buyer’s rights in these circumstances.13 So this is again a 
case where the passing of property may have important practical consequences. Here  
too, there are a number of modern cases demonstrating the important practical effects 
which attach to the passing of property in this situation, and the difficulties which arise 
when the property has not passed, or cannot pass because the goods remain in bulk, and 
no physical separation of the buyer’s goods from the remainder has yet been effected.14 
So also, the buyer’s chances of obtaining equitable or specific relief seem to be greater if 
property has passed to him, especially if the seller claims no proprietary or possessory 
rights of any kind over the goods. A buyer’s right to goods of which he is undisputed 
owner will be specifically enforced against a seller who proposes to convert them and 
pay damages in lieu.15
Next, reference must be made to three16 other important results, which generally fol-
low from the passing of property. The first of these is that the risk in the goods prima 
facie passes with the property. The second consequence is that generally speaking the 
seller is not entitled to sue for the price of the goods unless the property has passed. If 
the buyer repudiates the contract before this happens the seller’s remedy is prima facie 
an action for damages for non-acceptance. Yet even here, one cannot say that these con-
sequences follow naturally or logically from the passing of the property. Roman law had 
much the same rules as English law so far as risk is concerned, yet it refused to recognise

16	 Formerly, a fourth consequence was that when the property in specific goods had passed to the buyer, he could 
no longer reject them for breach of condition. The law on this point was altered by the Misrepresentation 
Act 1967, s. 4 – see below, p. 443.

	244	 The effects of the contract
that property passed merely by virtue of a contract of sale. Nor is there any necessary 
or logical connection between the right to sue for the price and the passing of property. 
Indeed, it will be suggested later17 that a number of unfortunate consequences follow 
from the present rules on this subject.
The next consequence is that the passing of property may in some circumstances 
determine who is the proper claimant to sue a third party who has damaged or destroyed 
the goods; for example, when they are en route to the buyer. But property alone will 
rarely be decisive. Usually, it is combined, either with a right to possession,18 or with a 
contractual right against the third party, such as a carrier. Prima facie, the person who 
is entitled to sue in respect of goods damaged at sea is usually the person who holds the 
bill of lading,19 and that person has a contractual right both against the shipowner and 
also the property. So it is rarely necessary to ask whether it is the one or the other which 
gives him the right to sue. But a contractual right without property will not usually ena-
ble the claimant to sue because he will not have suffered any damage.20 And it has been 
decided by the House of Lords that a right of property (or a possessory right) is neces-
sary to establish a cause of action in tort against someone who has been responsible for 
damaging or destroying goods.21 In particular, in circumstances where the buyer does 
not have the benefit of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992,22 where goods are lost 
or damaged while en route from a seller to a buyer, the buyer will now have no right to 
sue the carrier in tort unless the property had passed to him before the damage or loss 
occurred, or he has a possessory title to the goods.23 In most cases of carriage by sea this 
will not matter because the buyer will have contractual rights against the carrier, either 
because he made the contract of carriage (or it was made on his behalf),24 or because the 
Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992 applies. But there are some unusual circumstances 
in which these contractual rights are absent, and in that case it will now be a matter 
of considerable practical importance whether property has passed to the buyer, and, if  
so, when.25

Ltd [1991] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 146.

	
	 	
The transfer of property	 245
To sum up, it may be said that the most important practical consequences which flow 
from the mere passing of the property are as follows:26
1	 If the property in the goods has passed to the buyer he will generally have a good 
title to them if the seller becomes insolvent while the goods remain in the seller’s 
possession.
2	 If the goods are delivered subject to a reservation of title (or property) by the seller, 
the seller may27 have a good title to the goods should the buyer become insolvent.
3	 The right to sue a third party for damage to, or loss of, the goods may depend on who 
has the property.
4	 The risk passes prima facie when the property passes.
5	 Generally speaking, the seller can only sue for the price if the property has passed.
It will be observed that only the first three of these consequences affect third parties 
and that, although the passing of the property may have important results as between 
buyer and seller, its effect on third parties in ordinary circumstances is minimal.28 Still, 
a buyer or seller, relying on his property against an insolvent seller or buyer, may well 
have a title good against a liquidator or trustee in bankruptcy claiming through the seller 
or buyer. Of course, parties claiming through a contracting party are not treated by the 
law as third parties in this sense, although in another, more realistic, sense, trustees in 
bankruptcy and liquidators should perhaps be treated as third parties.29 Indeed, one of 
the chief problems of the existing law is that matters relating to the passing of property 
are treated as though they only concern the parties to the contract, and can be adjusted 
entirely according to the intention of the contracting parties. Yet, as we have now seen, 
by far the most important results of the passing of property relate to the rights of trus-
tees in bankruptcy and liquidators who in a realistic commercial sense represent third 
party creditors of buyer or seller. So it is a serious question whether contracting parties 
should be permitted to adjust the passing (or non-passing) of the property in a contract 
of sale to protect themselves against the risk of the other party’s insolvency, without any 
regard to the interests of third party creditors. At present, the rights of third parties are 
occasionally protected by the provisions of the Companies Act requiring the registration 
of charges, but the right to property under a contract of sale is not usually regarded by 
the law as a charge in the relevant sense.30
In earlier editions of this work, it was suggested that the Sale of Goods Act adopted 
the policy of allowing property to be transferred by contract alone, and then contained 
many elaborate provisions designed to reverse the practical effects of this policy. It was 
also suggested that the law would have been simpler if the Sale of Goods Act had adopted 
the rule of Roman (and Scots common) law that the property in the goods passes on and 
26	 Another result is that in time of war, the ownership of a cargo for prize purposes depends upon the property, 
but this is obviously of limited application.
27	 See text at n. 10.
28	 Lawson (1949) 65 LQR 352 at 359 went so far as to say: ‘If we look at the other effects [than passing of risk] 
of the transfer of property as between seller and buyer in the common law systems, we shall see that they are 
for the most part, if not entirely, illusory.’ As we have seen, this was an exaggeration, and anyhow there have 
been marked signs of an increase in the importance attached to the passing of property in recent years.

	246	 The effects of the contract
not before delivery. Had this been done, all the special rights of the unpaid seller might 
have been unnecessary, as also would ss. 24 and 25. But it is today perhaps less clear that 
this is so than it seemed at the time when this book was first written. The truth is that 
the problems concerned cannot be eliminated by changing the rules about the transfer 
of property. Questions will still arise (for instance) as to who is the proper claimant to 
sue a third person when goods are damaged en route; questions will still arise about risk, 
and the right to sue for the price. Above all, questions will still arise about the claims of 
a buyer against an insolvent seller (and those claiming through him) as well as about the 
claims of a seller against an insolvent buyer (and likewise those claiming through him). 
These claims must be disposed of by the law somehow. One way of doing it is the tradi-
tional common law way of trying to use a concept like ‘property’ to decide most of the 
problems, while recognising that many exceptions must be made. This has the disadvan-
tage, as indicated above, that the exceptions sometimes seem to eat up the rule.
Alternatively, the law might have abandoned the ‘conceptual’ approach altogether 
and adopted the ‘specific issue’ approach, that is, have dealt with each specific ques-
tion, such as the buyer’s ability to pass title to a third party, the passing of risk, liability 
for the price, etc., without reference to the passing of property. This is the approach of 
Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code, which is now in force throughout nearly 
all of the United States.31 But the alternative approach, while it has many attractions, 
fails to provide answers to new problems unforeseen by the law, or indeed to problems 
newly created by subsequent laws. For the ‘specific issue’ approach avoids general solu-
tions by use of organising concepts like property, and therefore may offer no solution 
at all (except perhaps by way of arguments by analogy) to new problems. Professor 
Atiyah thought that the traditional common law approach has at least the virtue that 
in principle there is always a way of meeting new problems, namely by looking to see 
who has the property in the goods at the relevant moment, and treating that person as 
owner, with consequences which are assumed to meet the new problems. A good illus-
tration of this ability of the traditional approach to meet new problems is to be found 
in some cases concerning conflicts over fuel oil on board chartered vessels. In The Span 
Terza,32 the House of Lords held that a dispute between a charterer and a mortgagee 
of the ship in question could be resolved by simply asking whether the fuel oil (which 
had been bought and paid for by the charterers) had been sold to the shipowners so 
that property had passed to them. It was held that it had not, so that the charterers still 
owned the oil and had a prior right to that of the mortgagees, who could only claim 
through the owners.
The previous editor of this work considered that in most cases the ‘specific issue’ 
approach leads to clearer answers. After all, under the Uniform Commercial Code the 
issue would probably have been resolved simply by asking if the mortgagee had a per-
fected security interest covering the fuel oil under Article 9. The need to resort to such 
devices as reservation of title clauses does not arise, for the same reason. It is the defi-
ciencies of our law of sale of goods that makes it useful to have a workhorse concept 
such as the ‘property in goods’.

The transfer of property	 247
The passing of property: I Specific goods
The exact moment at which the property passes depends upon whether the goods are 
specific or unascertained, and this cleavage is so fundamental that the subject will be 
dealt with under two separate headings.
Section 17 of the Act is as follows:
(1)	 Where there is a contract for the sale of specific or ascertained goods the property in 
them is transferred to the buyer at such time as the parties to the contract intend it to be 
transferred.
(2)	 For the purpose of ascertaining the intention of the parties regard shall be had to the 
terms of the contract, the conduct of the parties, and the circumstances of the case.
Although this section only applies to specific or ascertained goods, it is well settled that, 
as a matter of general contract law, the principle expressed in subsection (2) also holds 
true for unascertained goods.33
Section 18 (which applies to both specific and unascertained goods) goes on to state:
Unless a different intention appears, the following are rules for ascertaining the intention of the 
parties as to the time at which the property in the goods is to pass to the buyer.
And the section then sets out five Rules for ascertaining the intention of the parties.
In practice, these Rules are of the greatest importance for the parties often do not 
have any clear intention, still less express any, as to the passing of the property.34 More-
over, it appears that even if the parties do express such an intention it will have no effect 
if the property has already passed in accordance with the rules laid down in s. 18. In 
Dennant v Skinner and Collom,35 the plaintiff sold a car to X by auction. X, who was a 
swindler, gave a false name and address and asked to be allowed to take the car away in 
return for his cheque. The plaintiff allowed X to do this on obtaining his signature to a 
document which stated that the title to the vehicle would not pass until the cheque was 
met. X sold the car, which was ultimately resold to the defendant. Hallett J held that the 
intention of the parties as expressed in this document was too late to prevent the prop-
erty from passing since it had already done so on the fall of the hammer,36 in accordance 
with Rule 1 of s. 18.

down in s. 16 – see below, p. 259 and 266 et seq.

35	 [1948] 2 KB 164.
36	 It is odd that the defendant did not rely on s. 25(1), which would appear to have been decisive of this part of 
the case. It may be that this case turned on the fact that the sale was by auction. It might, however, have been 
argued on behalf of the seller that the intention of the transaction was that the seller released his lien on the 
vehicle in consideration of the revesting of property in him – see Hain SS Co Ltd v Tate & Lyle Ltd [1936] 
2 All ER 597 (as to the unpaid seller’s lien). In a sale in a shop it seems that no contract is made (and hence 
no property passes) until the mode of payment is agreed: see Ingram v Little [1961] 1 QB 31, 49; and in a 
supermarket, no property passes until the price is actually paid: Lacis v Cashmarts [1969] 2 QB 400, 407; 
Davies v Leighton [1978] Crim LR 575. These remarks may need qualification where the sellers advertise 
their willingness to accept payment by credit card as in Internet sales – see Re Charge Card Services Ltd 
[1988] 3 All ER 702 – but so far as risk of loss is concerned, the effect of the amendment of s. 32 is that in 
the case of consumer sales, risk of loss after goods are delivered to a carrier, is the seller’s – see p. 513.

	248	 The effects of the contract
Rule 1
This Rule is as follows:
Where there is an unconditional contract for the sale of specific goods, in a deliverable state, 
the property in the goods passes to the buyer when the contract is made, and it is immaterial 
whether the time of payment or the time of delivery, or both, be postponed.
This Rule gives rise to a number of difficult questions.
‘Unconditional contract’
In the first place, what is an unconditional contract within the meaning of this Rule? 
This may mean either (a) a contract not subject to a condition precedent or subsequent 
(Scoticé, suspensive or resolutive conditions); or (b) a contract not containing any condi-
tions in the sense of essential stipulations, the breach of which gives the buyer the right 
to treat the contract as repudiated. The former interpretation clearly cannot be correct. 
Throughout the Act, the term ‘conditional contract’ is used in this sense. Section 1(2) 
says: ‘A contract of sale may be absolute or conditional’, which clearly means subject to 
a condition precedent, for otherwise there would be no point in the contrast. Equally, 
Rules 2, 3 and 4 of s. 18 all deal with contracts subject to conditions precedent, so that 
the natural inference is that Rule 1, by contrast, deals with contracts not subject to such 
conditions. Furthermore, and this is surely conclusive, it is difficult to see how there 
can be any such thing as an unconditional contract if ‘condition’ here means ‘essential 
stipulation’. Every contract must contain at least some essential stipulations and most 
contracts contain a great many. In every contract of sale, there must be some fundamen-
tal conditions or obligations, namely that of the seller to deliver the goods to the buyer, 
and that of the buyer to accept the goods and pay the price. If the presence of these obli-
gations makes all contracts of sale conditional within Rule 1 it is deprived of all effect.
Yet despite these arguments the question has not been free from difficulty, though 
it is thought that these difficulties have now been set at rest in England at least. The 
trouble arose largely from s. 11(4) of the Act which, in its original form (then s. 11(1)(c) 
of the 1893 Act), deprived the buyer of the right to reject goods for breach of condition 
‘where the contract is for specific goods, the property in which has passed to the buyer’. 
If the term ‘unconditional contract’ in Rule 1 was given its natural meaning, the result 
appeared to be that in the vast majority of sales of specific goods there was no real 
right to reject for breach of condition at all. The property passed when the contract was 
made and at that very same time the right to reject was lost under s. 11(1)(c). This was 
such a startling result that the judges, consciously or unconsciously, strove to avoid it by 
giving a forced interpretation to the words ‘unconditional contract’ in Rule 1. Thus in 
Varley v Whipp,37 to which reference has already been made, it was held that the sale of 
a reaping machine was not an unconditional sale despite the fact that it was clearly not 
subject to any conditions precedent, but no reasons were given for this part of the deci-
sion. Similarly, in Ollett v Jordan,38 a case dealing with the meaning of ‘unconditionally

appropriated’ within Rule 5, it was held that the property in fish did not pass to the 
buyer owing to the fact that there was a breach of the implied condition that the fish was 
fit for human consumption, although there was no condition precedent. Finally, in Leaf v 
International Galleries,39 and again in Long v Lloyd,40 there were dicta which supported 
the conclusion reached in Varley v Whipp.41 Fortunately these difficulties now seem to 
be a matter of past history. The Misrepresentation Act 1967, s. 4 repealed the words 
formerly appearing in s. 11(1)(c), ‘where the contract is for specific goods the property 
in which has passed to the buyer’. As a result, there is now no need for judges to give an 
unnatural construction to the words ‘unconditional contract’ in s. 18, Rule 1 in order to 
avoid depriving a buyer of his right to reject goods.
The issue has not been discussed by the Scottish courts, but it has been suggested that 
(a) the contract need only be unconditional in the sense of having no conditions relevant 
to the passing of property rather than having no conditions at all and (b) the conditions 
in question must be suspensive (rendering the contract an agreement to sell) rather than 
resolutive; if they are the latter, the contract may nonetheless be regarded as ‘uncondi-
tional’ for the purposes of Rule 1.42
The most important kind of condition which may need to be satisfied before prop-
erty passes is a condition as to payment. Express terms may make the passing of prop-
erty conditional on payment even after delivery.43 Similarly, such a term may be readily 
implied in circumstances where payment is normally required before delivery; for exam-
ple, in a supermarket.44 Other types of conditional contract are dealt with later.45
Specific goods
The next question which arises under Rule 1 is as to the meaning of the term ‘specific 
goods’. It has already been observed that this term does not necessarily mean the same 
thing wherever it appears in the Act, despite the single definition by s. 61 of specific 
goods as goods ‘identified and agreed upon at the time a contract of sale is made’. At 
any rate, so far as the passing of property is concerned, it seems settled that future goods 
can never be specific, although they may possibly be sufficiently specific to come within 
the doctrine of frustration.
The meaning of ‘identified’ still remains to be examined. In most cases this gives rise to 
no difficulty – it is usually obvious enough when the goods are identified by the contract. 
But sometimes difficulty arises because general descriptive words are used, which are not 
entirely easy to apply. In Kursell v Timber Operators & Contractors Ltd,46 the plaintiff

p. 231), this will not usually prevent the property passing under Rule 1 – see Anderson v Havana Horse and 
others, 18 August 1999 (unreported).

sold to the defendants all the trees in a Latvian forest which conformed to certain meas-
urements on a particular date, the buyers to have 15 years in which to cut and remove the 
timber. Almost immediately afterwards the Latvian Assembly passed a law confiscating 
the forest. The Court of Appeal held that the property in the trees had not passed to the 
defendants as the goods were not sufficiently identified, since not all the trees were to pass, 
only those conforming to the stipulated measurements.47 An Australian decision provides 
an interesting contrast to this case. In Joseph Reid Pty Ltd v Schultz,48 a sale of all the 
millable or marketable hardwood timber on a certain site was held to be a sale of specific 
goods. In Commissioners of Customs & Excise v Everwine Ltd,49 as liquor was delivered to  
a bonded warehouse it was allocated a ‘rotation number’. The totality of alcohol held by 
the Everwine Ltd was sold by a series of contracts to a specific buyer. It was held that prop-
erty had passed applying Wait & James v Midland Bank Ltd.50 However, where release 
notes did not cover all of the claimant’s stock under the specified rotation numbers, the 
goods were unascertained and property could not pass.51
Deliverable state
The third question arising out of s. 18, Rule 1 is the meaning of the term, ‘deliverable 
state’. Under s. 61(5):
Goods are in a ‘deliverable state’ within the meaning of this Act when they are in such a state 
that the buyer would under the contract be bound to take delivery of them.
It is to be noted that s. 61(5) does not purport to give a comprehensive definition of 
‘deliverable state’. In particular, it does not say that if the buyer would not be bound 
to take delivery of the goods, then the goods are not in a deliverable state. The buyer is 
not bound to take delivery of defective goods, but it does not follow that all defective 
goods are not in a deliverable state within the meaning of this provision. If this were 
so, property would never pass in defective goods,52 but it seems to be generally accepted 
that defects do not prevent property passing.53 (If the buyer rejects the goods, property 
revests in the seller.) Section 61(5) was probably intended to cover the case where the 
goods could not be said to be in a deliverable state physically, yet the buyer had agreed 
to take delivery as they stood. This means that the words ‘deliverable state’ cannot be 
construed by reference to the definition of delivery in s. 61 as ‘a voluntary transfer of 
possession’. The possession of goods can probably always be transferred in law if the 
parties intend to transfer it, no matter what the physical condition of the goods may be. 
47	 Note that the Sale of Goods (Amendment) Act 1995 would not affect the situation in a case like this because 
even if the buyer had paid for a quantity of goods, it is questionable whether the bulk was sufficiently 
identified to constitute an identified bulk.

52	 In the first edition Professor Atiyah argued that this was indeed so. But this argument was largely a 
response to the difficulties created by s. 11 of the 1893 Act, which have now been removed by s. 4 of the 
Misrepresentation Act 1967. See below, p. 443.

The transfer of property	 251
If this was what ‘deliverable state’ meant, therefore, goods would probably always be in 
a deliverable state.
The authorities on this point are not of great assistance because there has been a 
tendency to interpret the words literally by reference to the physical moveability of the 
goods. In Underwood Ltd v Burgh Castle Brick & Cement Syndicate,54 the plaintiffs 
sold a condensing engine to the defendants f.o.b. The engine weighed over 30 tons and 
was cemented to the floor. The engine had to be dismantled after being detached from 
the floor, a task which of course fell on the sellers under the f.o.b. contract, and which 
was expected to take about two weeks and to cost about £100 (in 1922). It was held that 
the engine was not in a deliverable state and that the property had not passed when the 
contract was made.55 But the judges also thought that there was anyhow a sufficient con-
trary intention to be inferred from the fact that clearly some element of risk was involved 
in the work of dismantling the engine and dispatching it to the buyer, so it seemed that 
the property was not intended to pass on the sale.
Philip Head & Son Ltd v Showfronts Ltd56 was a case under s. 18, Rule 5(1) which 
also contains the phrase ‘in a deliverable state’. Here the plaintiffs sold carpeting to the 
defendants, which they were required to lay. The carpet was delivered to the defendants’ 
premises, but was stolen before it could be laid. It was held that the carpet was not in 
a deliverable state, apparently because it was a heavy bundle and difficult to move. But 
importance was attached to the fact that the carpet had to be laid by the sellers. This 
seems a better ground for holding that the property had not passed because the mere 
weight of the goods cannot mean they are not in a deliverable state – after all, goods of 
enormous weight are in fact commonly delivered under contracts of sale.
Perhaps a better illustration of what is meant by the term ‘deliverable state’ comes 
from the more recent decision in Kulkarni v Manor Credit (Davenham) Ltd.57 The issue 
in this case was whether a brand new car which has been registered and therefore had 
a registration mark assigned to it but which had not had number plates attached to it, 
could be regarded as being in a deliverable state. The Court of Appeal held that until the 
number plates were attached and it could be lawfully driven by buyer on a public road, it 
was not in a deliverable state. If nothing else, the decision here indicates that ‘deliverable 
state’ clearly extends beyond simply the movability of the goods.
Factors indicating a contrary intention
As we have seen, express agreement that property is not to pass, for instance, until pay-
ment, is effective in law. Although historically more common, such ‘conditional sale’

question were not fixed, but only needed to be disconnected into their constituent parts, held to be in a 
deliverable state and that property had passed on payment of the price. Similarly, Anderson v Havana Horse 
(UK) Ltd and others 31 July 1999 (unreported): Mercedes with crack in its windscreen and some scratches 
on its wheels (both of which were to be fixed before delivery to the buyer) in a deliverable state.

	252	 The effects of the contract
agreements have long been known. Where there is no express provision, it is a matter of 
inference whether the prima facie operation of Rule 1 is displaced.58
There is no doubt that the rule that property passes when the contract is made does 
not fit easily into the pattern of consumer sales.59 It is therefore not surprising to see the 
suggestion being made that in modern times very little is needed to rebut the inference 
that property passes on the making of the contract.60 It seems that in an ordinary sale in 
a shop, property does not pass at least until the parties have agreed on the mode of pay-
ment;61 and on a sale in a supermarket, property does not pass until the price is paid.62 
At a petrol station, property in the fuel passes when it is put into the vehicle’s petrol 
tank,63 but that is not a case of a sale of specific goods so much as of unascertained 
goods, so it is dealt with later.
Despite the fact that Rule 1 states that it is immaterial for purposes of passing of 
property whether the time of payment or the time of delivery, or both, be postponed, 
it is not possible to ignore such postponement completely. For if payment or delivery or 
both be postponed this may be some indication of a contrary intention which excludes 
the operation of Rule 1 altogether. In an Irish case,64 where the plaintiff had agreed to 
trade in his old car with the defendants in part-exchange for a new one, and was allowed 
to retain and use the old one pending delivery of the new one,65 it was held that property 
and risk had both passed to the defendants. The decision seems a curious one, and it is 
thought that on such facts a court would be fully justified in finding a contrary intention 
which would negative an intention to pass property before delivery.66 It certainly seems 
quite wrong that the risk should be held to be on the buyer while the seller still has the 
use of the car.
Another factor which may point to a contrary intention is any specific agreement on 
the transfer of risk. As will be seen, the risk in the goods prima facie passes with the 
property. If the risk has passed, therefore, this may be some indication that the property 
has also passed.67 Conversely, where the risk is still on the seller this may be evidence that

position is that the buyer must pay cash unless the seller agrees to accept some alternative.

66	 The decision seems to have been influenced by an admission by the defendants that they would have regarded 
it as a breach of contract had the plaintiff sold his car to a third party. This may well have been correct but it 
does not follow that property had passed. There are good policy reasons for holding that the ‘seller’ in such 
a case bears the risk because he should have the burden of looking after the goods, and is the more likely 
carrier of insurance cover – see Martin v Melland’s 283 NW 2d 76 (1979), a case on Art. 2 of the Uniform 
Commercial Code. Although the UCC is explicit on this policy consideration, the court in that case could 
within the terms of the Code have reached the same conclusion as the Irish court.

inference that the passing of risk (especially in shipped goods) means that property has also passed: Mitsui & 
Co Ltd v Flota Mercante Grancolombiana SA [1989] 1 All ER 951.

	
	 	
The transfer of property	 253
the property has not passed.68 But it is possible to draw precisely the opposite inference 
from the passing of risk. In Re Anchor Line Ltd,69 the Court of Appeal inferred that 
the property in goods had not passed because there was a specific clause in the contract 
placing the risk upon the buyer, and (the court reasoned) if the property had passed 
such a clause would not have been necessary. One can only say, therefore, that the proper 
inference to be drawn from an agreement placing the risk on the buyer must depend on 
all the circumstances of the case.70
An obligation to insure placed upon one party by the contract is also an indication 
that he bears the risk,71 and it has been said that this is an indication that he also has 
the property. But once again, the proper inference to be drawn must depend upon all the 
circumstances of the case, for it could well be that the intention is simply that one party 
insures the other’s risk.
In trying to determine what is the correct inference to draw from a contractual pro-
vision about the transfer of risk or an obligation to insure, the following appear to be 
relevant factors to bear in mind. First, it seems that where the seller advises the buyer 
to insure, this is some indication that risk and property have passed to the buyer.72 Such 
advice does not suggest that the seller retains any property in the goods, as might be 
argued if he actually stipulated for insurance. Secondly, there may be cases in which 
a seller may retain some interest in the goods even where the property has passed; for 
example, he may still have a lien or some sort of charge on the goods. In such circum-
stances, the seller may wish to require the buyer to insure the goods in order to protect 
his own interest, and this would be no indication that risk had not passed, although the 
property remained in the seller.73 Conversely, where the contract requires the buyer to 
insure the goods, but the seller would have, on the face of it, no interest in the goods if 
the property and risk had passed from him, the correct inference may well be that prop-
erty and risk have not passed.
Another kind of case in which the presumption contained in Rule 1 would normally 
be rebutted is a contract for the sale of goods and land together. For example, where a 
person contracts to sell a house together with some furnishings, the presumption that 
property passes on the making of the contract would be rebutted. The normal inference 
in such a case would be that the property is only to pass on conveyance.74 Indeed, where 
(contrary to the normal English practice) the vendor is not fully paid on conveyance 
and the price is to be paid by instalments, the property may not even pass on delivery of 
possession.75

	254	 The effects of the contract
Where goods are to be supplied and installed or fitted by the seller in a building or 
construction so that the goods will become fixtures in the technical sense, the property 
does not normally pass until the work of installation has been completed.76 But cases 
of this nature are more likely to involve unascertained goods, so this point is dealt with 
more fully later.77
Rules 2 and 3
In contrast to Rule 1, which deals with the unconditional sale of specific goods, Rules 2, 
3 and 4 deal with the conditional sale of specific goods. But unlike Rule 1, which deals 
with all unconditional contracts, Rules 2 to 4 deal only with certain types of conditional 
contract, so there is in fact no general or residuary rule dealing with conditional con-
tracts not falling within Rules 2, 3 or 4. (Section 19 also deals with certain conditional 
contracts, but as these mostly concern unascertained goods, this section is dealt with 
under the next heading.) So a conditional contract which does not fall within Rules 2, 
3 or 4 (or s. 19) must be dealt with under the very general terms of s. 17, which simply 
require the court to ascertain the presumed intention of the parties by taking account of 
all the circumstances of the case. Rules 2 and 3 are as follows:
Rule 2. Where there is a contract for the sale of specific goods and the seller is bound to do 
something to the goods, for the purpose of putting them into a deliverable state, the property 
does not pass until the thing is done, and the buyer has notice that it has been done.
Rule 3. Where there is a contract for the sale of specific goods in a deliverable state, but the 
seller is bound to weigh, measure, test, or do some other act or thing with reference to the 
goods for the purpose of ascertaining the price, the property does not pass until the act or 
thing is done, and the buyer has notice that it has been done.
It is not clear why Rule 2 is confined to cases where the seller is bound to do some-
thing to put the goods ‘into a deliverable state’. Therefore, it seems that the Rule would 
not apply where the seller has agreed to repair the goods; for example, to overhaul a 
second-hand car which the buyer has agreed to purchase ‘as is’. On the other hand, such 
a sale may still be a conditional sale, but one to which none of the Rules in s. 18 would 
apply. In such a case, the court may simply fall back on s. 17 and hold that property is 
not to pass until the repairs have been done as this is the presumed intention of the par-
ties.78 In a Scottish case about the sale of growing potatoes, the seller undertook to lift 
and put the goods in pits at maturity, and to cart them to the railway station. It was held 
that the goods were in a deliverable state when put into the pits, the obligation of carting 
relating only to actual delivery.79
Rule 3 requires little comment. It clearly deals with cases where the passing of the 
property is conditional upon the performance of some act with reference to the goods.

The transfer of property	 255
The presumption embodied in this rule is probably somewhat weaker than those in 
Rules 1 and 2 because it is easy to imagine circumstances in which the parties intend the 
property to pass at once, especially if the price has been paid. So, for instance, where a 
seller sold haystacks for delivery at the buyer’s convenience and the price was paid at 
once, though liable to adjustment when the hay was weighed on delivery, it was held that 
the property passed at once.80 Similarly, it is probable that the property would be held to 
have passed if the goods have been delivered, although the seller has still to do something 
to ascertain the price; for example, to look up the list price in a catalogue. If the seller 
is not bound to do some act to the goods to ascertain the price, Rule 3 is inapplicable.81
At all events, Rule 3 only applies to acts to be done by the seller. In Nanka Bruce v 
Commonwealth Trust Ltd,82 A sold cocoa to B at an agreed price per 60 lb, it being 
arranged that B would resell the goods and that the cocoa would then be weighed by the 
purchasers in order to ascertain the total amount due from B to A. It was held that the 
weighing did not make the contract conditional and that the property passed to B before 
the price was ascertained.
Rule 4
Rule 4 deals with two different types of transaction altogether, although they are very 
similar to a conditional sale and may become a sale in due course; they are:
When goods are delivered to the buyer on approval or on sale or return or other similar terms . . .
There is little authority on the meaning of the terms ‘sale on approval’ or ‘sale or 
return’, and it has been suggested that they are very different transactions in commercial 
function, and perhaps also in intent.83 One possible difference is that a sale on approval 
may legally amount to a contract of sale with a condition subsequent which permits the 
buyer to rescind the transaction if he finds the goods unsuitable,84 while a ‘sale or return’ 
transaction may not even be a contract of sale at all, but rather an offer to sell, accom-
panied by delivery, which must actually be accepted before it becomes a contract of sale 
(i.e. up to that point it is a mere bailment). The Act does not differentiate between them, 
however, and as the Rule also applies to transactions on ‘other similar terms’, it may 
be that no difference was intended. It has at least been held that there is no difference 
between a transaction where the goods are delivered to a prospective buyer who may 
keep or return the goods, on the one hand, and cases where the goods are delivered to a 
dealer who is expected either to resell or return the goods, on the other hand. Both these

common for export contracts for the sale of goods in bulk to provide for final adjustment of the price on 
weighing (or measuring) the goods on discharge from the vessel. It seems clear that this would not prevent 
property passing at the usual time, namely on transfer of the bill of lading – see below, p. 352. (These 
contracts would normally be for the sale of unascertained goods and so not within Rule 3, anyhow.)

84	 But cf. Cranston v Mallow 1912 SC 112, in which it was held that when a horse was sold under a warranty

was not unqualified but dependent on non-fulfilment of the warranty.

	256	 The effects of the contract
transactions fall within Rule 4.85 In Scotland, a sale or return has been taken to be a sale, 
albeit subject to a suspensive condition.86
Rule 4, having set out the transactions to which it applies, then goes on to say that in 
these transactions the property passes to the buyer:
(a)	 When he signifies his approval or acceptance to the seller or does any other act adopting 
the transaction.
It has been held that any action by the buyer inconsistent with his free power to return 
the goods is an act adopting the transaction within the meaning of the Rule. Thus, 
where a person obtains goods on sale or return or similar terms and then resells or 
pledges them, this is an act adopting the transaction, and the third party is therefore 
protected against the seller. Nor is it material that the first buyer is guilty of a criminal 
offence.87 An express stipulation that the property is not to pass until the goods are paid 
for is effective to protect the seller because this is evidence of a contrary intention which 
overrides Rule 4.88
Rule 4 tells us what acts of the buyer cause property to pass, but it does not indicate 
what he must do if he decides to return the goods. Under Rule 4(b), property passes if 
the buyer retains the goods beyond a certain time without giving ‘notice of rejection’. 
Clearly, this cannot be ‘notice of rejection’ in the same sense as this term is used in rela-
tion to defective goods, simply because in the case of sale or return contracts what suf-
fices for this purpose will be controlled by the terms of the original contract, which will 
frequently spell out what is to be done, whereas when goods are rejected as defective, the 
contract will rarely say what is to be done. In Atari Corporation v Electronics Boutique 
Stores,89 the Court of Appeal held that in the absence of a specific provision controlling 
the matter, in a sale or return contract any intimation to the ‘seller’ that the ‘buyer’ 
does not wish to exercise his option to purchase suffices. In modern commercial condi-
tions, where goods are bought centrally and distributed around a chain of retailers, it 
will often be impractical to return the goods at the time of the notice, or even to specify 
what goods are being returned. In Atari, the Court of Appeal recognised this commer-
cial reality. It is sufficient if after giving notice, the ‘buyer’ collects in the goods within 
a reasonable time so that the ‘seller’ can resume possession of them.90 This case also 
supports the view, set out above, that sale or return contracts are contracts of bailment 
up to the time property passes. This is a matter of some importance because if the pass-
ing of property and time of payment are separate, the goods will remain at the seller’s 
risk notwithstanding payment by the buyer. So if the ‘buyer’ must pay for the goods by 
30 November, but has until 31 January to reject them,91 the goods will remain at the 
‘seller’s’ risk until 31 January. Since these are, in reality, financing transactions, time of

The transfer of property	 257
payment merely indicates the point of time up to which the ‘seller’ is prepared to finance 
the ‘buyer’s’ inventory. It is submitted that Rule 4 still controls the passing of property,92 
and therefore risk, in the absence of contract provisions dealing with this.
Today, the extensive use of ‘reservation of title’ clauses (under which goods are deliv-
ered but the seller reserves title until he is paid)93 sometimes leads to a transaction which 
is rather similar to a sale on approval or a sale or return, although these are more likely 
to be transactions relating to unascertained goods to which, strictly, Rule 4 has no appli-
cation. Where goods are delivered to a buyer under a reservation of title clause, and he 
is authorised by the seller to use the goods even before payment, such use may – if it 
deprives the goods of their identity – amount to an act which necessarily transfers the 
property to the buyer, despite the terms of the reservation of title clause. So, for instance, 
resin delivered to a buyer who used it in a matter of days in the manufacture of chip-
board was held to have ceased to exist as a separate commodity, despite a reservation of 
title clause,94 and a similar result was reached when leather was sold which was intended 
to be used in the making of handbags.95 It was held that as soon as the buyer started 
to work the leather, the property passed to him, despite the reservation of title clause. 
These decisions can be explained by saying that the reservation of title clause must be 
read subject to the paramount intent of the parties that the buyer is to be entitled to use 
the goods in the process of his business, and that this intent is inconsistent with any 
real intention that property is to remain in the seller after the process has begun. None 
of these cases actually refers to s. 18, Rule 4, presumably because they related to unas-
certained goods. It was suggested in previous editions that the result in these cases is in 
line with Rule 4 in that they appear to be examples of acts ‘adopting the transaction’ 
under this Rule if the contracts are characterised as transactions ‘on sale or return or 
other similar terms’. This is true in a sense, but perhaps is slightly misleading because a 
fundamental difference between retention of title and sale or return transactions is that 
usually the buyer in the former type of transaction is committed to buy, whereas the 
whole point of the latter arrangement is that he is not. The legal basis of retention of 
title clauses under the Act is s. 19 (as already explained), and the rule expressed in s. 17 
that property passes when the parties intend it to.
A slightly different problem arises where the buyer under a sale or return transaction 
sells the goods to a third party despite a clause providing that property is not to pass until 
payment. Although such a clause overrides s. 18, Rule 4 because it shows a contrary inten-
tion as to the time when property is to pass, there are many other ways in which the third 
party buyer may be protected. For example, the seller may be caught by the doctrine of 
estoppel,96 or by the provisions of s. 2 of the Factors Act 1889.97 In Weiner v Harris,98 the 
plaintiff sent jewellery to F, a retailer, under a standing contract, whereby the property 
was to remain in the plainitff until the goods were sold or paid for. F pledged the jewels in 
question with the defendant. Cozens-Hardy MR posed the following question: ‘Was the

	258	 The effects of the contract
transaction the ordinary well-known transaction of goods taken on sale or return, or was 
it a transaction under which F was constituted agent for sale, with authority to sell, and 
bound to account to his principal for the proceeds of such sale?’ In the former case, s. 18, 
Rule 4 would be overridden by a contrary intention and the seller would be protected. In 
the latter case, F would be a mercantile agent enabled by s. 2 of the Factors Act to pass a 
good title to a buyer or pledgee. The Court of Appeal had no doubt that in this case F was 
a mercantile agent, and the defendants were protected.
It has been held that a person who has obtained goods on sale or return cannot pass 
a good title to a third party under s. 25(1) of the Act, if there is a contrary intention 
which excludes the operation of Rule 4.99 The reason for this is not very clear, but it 
seems to depend on the view that such a person is not, within the meaning of s. 25(1), a 
person who has ‘bought or agreed to buy goods’. He has an option to purchase, but that 
is all; until he exercises his option by accepting the goods or adopting the transaction, 
there is no sale. But there is one difficulty about this analysis, and that is that the buyer 
can ‘adopt’ the transaction without communicating his intention to the seller. If this 
were really a mere option, it would seem that the buyer would have to communicate his 
acceptance to the seller. It may be, therefore, that the right view is that there must actu-
ally be a contract of sale of goods and then an act adopting the transaction before the 
property passes.100 In Scotland, it has been held that goods on sale or return do not pass 
to the buyer’s trustee in sequestration.101
The second alternative given by Rule 4 is:
(b)	 If he does not signify his approval or acceptance to the seller but retains the goods without 
giving notice of rejection, then, if a time has been fixed for the return of the goods, on the expi-
ration of that time, and, if no time has been fixed, on the expiration of a reasonable time.
Thus if a time has been fixed for the return of the goods, the buyer is deemed to have 
exercised his option to buy them if he retains them after this time. Here again, there-
fore, the transaction may be completed without a communication of acceptance. It is 
clear that an unsolicited delivery of goods with an offer to sell them does not have this 
effect,102 and it is therefore arguable that delivery on sale or return must be more than a 
mere option or offer to sell. The buyer may, of course, waive the time limit and accept 
the goods at once by so informing the seller, or by doing some act which adopts the 
transaction.
If the goods are not returned within a reasonable time because of the defaults of 
employees of the buyer, the property will be held to have passed to him even though 
he may have given instructions for the return of the goods.103 But the sub-rule does not 
apply if the goods are detained by someone for whose acts the buyer is not responsible.

later they were seized by execution creditors of X, who retained them until after the

The passing of property: II Unascertained goods
The meaning of the term ‘unascertained goods’ has already been discussed and it has been 
seen to cover three possibilities: first, goods to be manufactured or grown by the seller; 
secondly, purely generic goods and thirdly, an unidentified portion of a specified bulk or 
whole.105 Although the Act does not distinguish between these three types of unascertained 
goods, the rules as to the passing of property and risk may well differ in the three cases. In 
particular, it will be seen that the passing of risk in an unidentified portion of a specified 
whole may sometimes take place at a different time from the usual. And, secondly, it will 
be seen that what amounts to an ‘unconditional appropriation’ – which is what is usually 
required to transfer the property – in one type of sale may not be so in another.
The fundamental rules are laid down by ss. 16 and 17. Section 16 provides that:
Subject to section 20A below, where there is a contract for the sale of unascertained goods no 
property in the goods is transferred to the buyer unless and until the goods are ascertained.
Then s. 17 (which has been set out above)106 provides that on a sale of specific or ascer-
tained goods, the property passes when the parties intend it to pass, and that intention 
is to be gathered from the terms of the contract, the conduct of the parties and the cir-
cumstances of the case. Section 18, Rule 5 then says that, subject to a contrary intention:
(1)	 Where there is a contract for the sale of unascertained or future goods by description, and 
goods of that description and in a deliverable state are unconditionally appropriated to the 
contract, either by the seller with the assent of the buyer, or by the buyer with the assent of 
the seller, the property in the goods thereupon passes to the buyer; and the assent may be 
express or implied, and may be given either before or after the appropriation is made.
Relationship of ss. 16, 17 and 18
It is clear that s. 16 must be the starting point in considering the passing of property in a 
sale of unascertained goods. The section lays down the fundamental rule that subject to 
s. 20A the property cannot pass until the goods are ascertained, and this appears to be a 
mandatory provision which takes precedence over the intention of the parties.107 Indeed, 
s. 17, which deals with the intention of the parties, only operates in a sale of ‘specific 
or ascertained goods’. There was thus no provision covering the passing of property in 
goods which are still unascertained for the good reason that the Act clearly did not con-
template this as a legal possibility at all. No matter what the parties may have intended 
property could not pass until the goods are ascertained.

	260	 The effects of the contract
Whatever the intentions of the parties, where there is a contract for the sale of unascertained 
goods, no property can pass until the goods are ascertained: see s. 16 of the Sale of Goods Act 
1893.[108] Once ascertainment has taken place, the passing of property depends on the intention 
of the parties and the circumstances of the case: see s. 17.109
This rule still applies to contracts made before 19 September 1995 when the Sale of 
Goods (Amendment) Act 1995 came into force. After that date the position is regulated by 
the new s. 18, Rule 5, s. (3) and (4), but it is submitted that the last sentence of this dictum 
is still relevant. We now turn to an examination of the wording of s. 18, Rule 5.
Deliverable state
The meaning of this term, which also appears in Rule 1, has already been discussed in 
connection with that Rule.
Unconditional appropriation
Under the terms of Rule 5, an ‘unconditional appropriation’ is the usual method by 
which the property will pass. Put very briefly, the requirement of unconditional appro-
priation means that some ascertained and identified goods must be irrevocably attached 
or earmarked for the particular contract in question.110 Subject to the question of assent, 
which is dealt with below, the property in the goods will then pass to the buyer. So the 
first and most vital question is how do unascertained goods become unconditionally 
appropriated to the contract? One of the commonest and simplest ways in which this 
happens is by delivery. If the seller actually delivers to the buyer goods answering the 
contract description, this is an appropriation, which, assuming it to be unconditional 
and subject to the question of assent, will thereupon pass the property to the buyer, at 
least if the goods are delivered to the correct destination.111
Rule 5(2) gives another illustration of an unconditional appropriation:
Where, in pursuance of the contract, the seller delivers the goods to the buyer or to a carrier 
or other bailee . . . (whether named by the buyer or not) for the purpose of transmission to 
the buyer, and does not reserve the right of disposal, he is to be taken to have unconditionally 
appropriated the goods to the contract.112
This sub-rule, like the whole of s. 18, had to be read subject to the unamended s. 16 
because it was clear that if the seller delivered the goods to a carrier still mixed with 
other goods, no property could pass, because the goods were still unascertained, despite 
what would otherwise amount to an unconditional appropriation. So, for instance, in 
108	 Now, of course, the 1979 Act: there is no change on this point.

Hayman & Son v McLintock 1907 SC 936.
110	 For example, in the case of bottled drinks sold on licensed premises, property in both the bottle and its 
contents passes when the bartender removes the cap and hands the bottle to the customer. Property in the 
bottle also passes where the contents are poured into a glass and the bottle disposed of by the bartender – R 
v Environment Agency, ex parte Valpak [2002] Env LR 36.
111	 If the goods are not delivered to the correct destination, they remain at the seller’s risk – see CTN Cash and 
Carry Ltd v Gallagher Ltd [1994] 4 All ER 714.
112	 See also s. 32(1), but note that this latter provision does not apply in the case of consumer sales – s. 32(4).

	
	 	
The transfer of property	 261
Healy v Howlett & Sons,113 the defendant ordered 20 boxes of mackerel from the plain-
tiff, a fish exporter carrying on business in Ireland. The plaintiff dispatched 190 boxes 
and instructed the railway officials to earmark 20 of the boxes for the defendant and the 
remaining boxes for two other consignees. The train was delayed before the defendant’s 
boxes were earmarked, and by the time this was done the fish had deteriorated. It was 
held that the property in the fish had not passed to the defendant before the boxes were 
earmarked and that they were, therefore, still at the seller’s risk when they deteriorated. 
Because it was not possible to say which of the boxes belonged to the buyer until the ear-
marking had been done, no identified or ascertained goods had yet been appropriated to 
the contracts of each individual buyer.114
Apart from the particular instance given in Rule 5(2), the meaning of the term ‘uncon-
ditional appropriation’ has been considered on many occasions by the courts. The pos-
sibility of the appropriation being conditional is discussed further below. Here we shall 
concentrate on the concept of appropriation itself. Despite the fact that the word ‘appro-
priated’ has been said to be ‘a term of legal art [which] has a certain definite meaning’,115 it 
is extremely difficult to define it with precision. One thing at least was clear, that where an 
unidentified part of a bulk was sold there could be no appropriation until there was a sev-
erance of the part sold from the rest and thus no passing of property. Healy v Howlett & 
Sons116 is one authority for this. Another is Laurie & Morewood v John Dudin & Son.117 
Here the defendants were warehousemen who were in possession of some maize belong-
ing to A. A sold part of it to B and B resold it to the plaintiffs, who obtained a delivery 
order and lodged it with the defendants. A, not having been paid by B, stopped delivery, 
and the plaintiffs then brought an action of detinue against the defendants. The Court 
of Appeal disposed of the case on the short ground that without severance no property 
could have passed to the plaintiffs because the goods were not identified. The outcome of 
similar cases occurring today will be unaffected by the 1995 Act.
The question of appropriation has arisen in a number of different situations. One 
common type of case concerns builders or contractors who leave a contract uncompleted 
(often because they have become insolvent) and disputes then arise as to the ownership 
of materials brought onto the site by the builder. Of course, if the site itself belongs to 
the builder and he has merely contracted to sell or convey the completed building, it is 
almost impossible that the property in such materials could pass to the client before the 
building is completed and the land conveyed to the buyer. But if the site is already owned 
by the client, or the builder is working on renovation or repairs to an existing building, 
the owner of the site may claim that the property in the materials has passed to him, 
113	 [1917] 1 KB 337. Conversely, if the seller delivers goods to the buyer with the intention that the goods will 
lose their identity by being mixed with other goods, it is almost impossible to hold that property has not 
passed: Borden (UK) Ltd v Scottish Timber Products Ltd [1981] Ch 25; South Australian Insurance Co v 
Randell (1869) LR 3 PC 101. But see below, p. 406, as to the Romalpa case.
114	 As to the passing of property in such fact situations under the Sale of Goods (Amendment) Act 1995, see 
p. 272. Of course, what ultimately was at issue in Healy v Howlett was the passing of risk, and, for the 
reasons explained above, the questions of the passing of risk and passing of property need to be considered 
separately. It is certainly possible that had the goods been specific in Healy v Howlett, they might have 
travelled at the seller’s risk even though property in them had passed to the buyer.

	262	 The effects of the contract
while the builder’s creditors may dispute this and claim that the property remains in the 
builder.
As we have already seen, where goods are to be supplied and installed or fixed by 
the seller in a building or construction, so that the goods will become fixtures in the 
technical sense becoming attached to the land or a building on the land, the general rule 
or presumption is that property does not pass until the work of installation has been 
completed, or, anyhow, until the materials are ‘affixed to or in a reasonable sense made 
part of the corpus’.118 This is often explained by saying that the contract is for work and 
materials in such a case, rather than a sale of goods. Hence, if the contract is clearly 
intended to be for the sale of goods to be afterwards installed,119 even by the seller, the 
Sale of Goods Act will apply, and property may pass on the making of the contract 
under Rule 1 if the goods are specific goods. It seems best, however, to explain these 
differences as resting on the intention of the parties and the nature of the transaction 
rather than on its technical classification. Whether it is a contract for the sale of goods 
or for work and materials is itself immaterial.120
So also, an ordinary supply of goods to a building site for ultimate incorporation in 
a building or construction will usually be a simple sale of goods, and property will nor-
mally pass on delivery, if not sooner, though subject to any express contractual condi-
tions, which are indeed quite normal in such cases. For instance, in Santer-Automation 
Ltd v H C Goodman (Mechanical Services) Ltd121 the plaintiffs were subcontractors who 
had brought materials onto a site for incorporation into a building being constructed by 
the defendants, the main contractors for the Property Services Agency, a public body. The 
main contractors became insolvent and the Agency determined the contract with them, 
and proposed to use the materials and equipment brought onto the site by the plaintiffs. 
The plaintiffs claimed that the property in these materials was still vested in them under 
their conditions of work, but it was held that these conditions had never been accepted, 
and that the Agency’s conditions governed because the claimants must have known of 
these conditions when they contracted with the main contractors. The Agency’s condi-
tions provided that the property in materials and equipment brought onto the site vested 
in them, so here the question of appropriation under Rule 5 simply did not arise.122 The 
passing of property was governed by express contractual provision, not by the Act.
Where a seller, who is not himself in any way involved in the construction works, 
delivers goods to a site in pursuance of a contract with a contractor, the passing of prop-
erty will depend on the contract between them. Prima facie the delivery would be an 
appropriation of the goods under Rule 5, but the position is today often complicated by 
reservation of title clauses which enable the seller to claim title until he is paid.123 Again, 
118	 Seath v Moore (1886) 1 App Cas 350, 381 per Lord Watson. Of course the installation may not involve a 
transfer of property at all, as where a tenant installs furniture and fittings which do not become fixtures, 
and so remain his property. See, e.g., Young v Dalgety PLC (1987) 281 EG 427.

The transfer of property	 263
therefore, the question of appropriation would not strictly arise; although it may well be 
that the courts would decline to uphold a reservation of title where the goods have actu-
ally been incorporated into the building works.124
The question of appropriation has also arisen in a number of shipbuilding cases. In 
such cases, as in the case of all goods to be manufactured by the seller, the general pre-
sumption is that no property is to pass until the article is completed.125 This is still the 
case even if the price is to be paid by instalments during the construction of the ship.126 
But it was said ‘there is no doubt that a contract might be so framed as to give the pur-
chaser power to claim the property in those parts which, when they are put together, 
make the complete ship’.127 And since then it has become customary for shipbuilding 
contracts to do something like this where the price is payable by instalments as the work 
proceeds. Thus in Re Blyth Shipbuilding Co,128 A agreed to build a ship for B, the price 
to be paid by instalments as the work proceeded. The contract provided that on the 
payment of the first instalment ‘the vessel and all materials and things appropriated for 
her should thenceforth . . . become and remain the absolute property of the purchaser’.129  
A went bankrupt before the ship was complete. A certain amount of worked and 
unworked material was lying about the yard at the relevant time, some of which had been 
fashioned and was ready to be incorporated into the ship. It was held by the Court of 
Appeal that the property in the incomplete ship had passed to the buyers, but the worked 
and unworked material gave rise to more difficulty. In the result, it was held that neither 
had been sufficiently appropriated to pass the property, mainly because they had not yet 
been fixed to the body of the ship. Although complete and final fixing to the body of the 
ship was perhaps not necessary, it was held that the goods must be substantially in posi-
tion so that to remove them would have involved undoing work already done.
Another kind of case arises where a seller manufactures goods for subsequent delivery 
to the buyer, and the goods are completed or virtually completed and ready for delivery, 
and the seller then becomes bankrupt or insolvent. If the buyer has paid the price, or 
part of the price in advance, he may wish to claim that the property in the goods has 
passed to him, while the seller’s creditors, or liquidator, may argue that the property was  
still in the seller. In Carlos Federspiel & Co SA v Charles Twigg & Co Ltd,130 sellers man-
ufactured bicycles to the buyers’ order. The bicycles were made and packed in containers 
with the buyers’ name and address on them, but before the goods could be shipped, the 
sellers became insolvent. It was held that the property had not passed to the buyers. 
After a comprehensive review of the authorities, old and new, Pearson J summed up 
124	 Possibly such incorporation might amount to a wrongful conversion on the part of the building owner, and, 
because this is not a contract of sale, he cannot rely on s. 24 of the Act. See the Dawber Williamson case, 
cited above, n. 122.

Rule 5, but since the contract itself used the same term, the decision would seem an authority on the 
application of Rule 5.
129	 A clause of this kind does not deprive the buyer of any right of rejection he may have when the vessel is 
completed: McDougall v Aeromarine of Emsworth Ltd [1958] 1 WLR 1126.

	264	 The effects of the contract
the law relating to appropriation in the following passage, the whole of which merits 
quotation:
First, Rule 5 of s. 18 of the Act is one of the Rules for ascertaining the intention of the par-
ties as to the time at which the property in the goods is to pass to the buyer unless a different 
intention appears. Therefore the element of common intention has always to be borne in mind. 
A mere setting apart or selection by the seller of the goods which he expects to use in perfor-
mance of the contract is not enough. If that is all, he can change his mind and use those goods 
in performance of some other contract and use some other goods in performance of this con-
tract. To constitute an appropriation of the goods to the contract the parties must have had, 
or be reasonably supposed to have had an intention to attach the contract irrevocably to those 
goods, so that those goods and no others are the subject of the sale and become the property 
of the buyer.
Secondly, it is by agreement of the parties that the appropriation, involving a change of 
owner-ship, is made, although in some cases the buyer’s assent to an appropriation is conferred 
in advance by the contract itself or otherwise.
Thirdly, an appropriation by the seller with the assent of the buyer may be said always to 
involve an actual or constructive delivery.[131] If the seller retains possession, he does so as bailee 
for the buyer. There is a passage in Chalmers’ Sale of Goods Act, 12th edn at p. 75 where it is 
said:
In the second place, if the decisions be carefully examined, it will be found that in every 
case where the property has been held to pass, there has been an actual or constructive 
delivery of the goods to the buyer.
I think that is right, subject only to this possible qualification, that there may be after such 
constructive delivery an actual delivery still to be made by the seller under the contract. Of 
course, that is quite possible, because delivery is the transfer of possession, whereas appropria-
tion transfers ownership. So there may be first an appropriation, constructive delivery, whereby 
the seller becomes bailee for the buyer, and then a subsequent actual delivery involving actual 
possession, and when I say that I have in mind in particular the cases cited, namely Aldridge v 
Johnson132 and Langton v Higgins.133
Fourthly, one has to remember s. 20 of the Sale of Goods Act, whereby the ownership and 
the risk are normally associated. Therefore, as it appears that there is reason for thinking, on 
the construction of the relevant documents, that the goods were, at all material times, still at the 
seller’s risk, that is prima facie an indication that the property had not passed to the buyer.
Fifthly, usually, but not necessarily, the appropriating act is the last act to be performed by 
the seller. For instance, if delivery is to be taken at the seller’s premises and the seller has appro-
priated the goods when he has made the goods ready and identified them and placed them in 
position to be taken by the buyer and has so informed the buyer, and if the buyer agrees to 
come and take them, that is the assent to the appropriation. But if there is a further act, an 
important and decisive act, to be done by the seller, then there is prima facie evidence that 
probably the property does not pass until the final act is done.
131	 The concept of a ‘constructive delivery’, though sometimes relied upon in older cases, involves use of a 
fiction and does not seem particularly helpful. But the concept may be important in some cases concerning 
the transfer of title by a non-owner – see below, p. 322 et seq., and in solving the apparent conflict between 
the Act’s risk provisions and the seller’s duty to deliver goods of the right quality, see pp. 121–122.

The transfer of property	 265
Probably, the decisive fact in this case was that the sellers were responsible for arrang-
ing shipment of the goods. By contrast, in Hendy Lennox Ltd v Grahame Puttick Ltd134 
the sellers assembled generators which had been ordered by buyers and it was held that 
the property in the generators passed when they were ready for delivery, and buyers 
received from the sellers the invoices together with delivery notes, containing the serial  
numbers of the generators sold. At this stage, the sellers had done everything they 
needed to do under the contract; the serial numbers enabled the particular generators 
sold to be identified, and nothing remained except for the buyers to pay the invoices and 
take delivery.
A New Zealand case has gone so far as to hold that where sellers made rope for the 
buyers’ order and stored it in a warehouse from which deliveries were made as requested, 
there was an unconditional appropriation.135 This case is also authority for saying that 
even if the goods are stored with other similar goods they are sufficiently earmarked if 
the sellers can identify the particular goods set aside for the buyers. It is immaterial that 
nobody else could tell which goods were meant for which buyer.136 However, it is doubt-
ful whether this would be an acceptable rule where the only ‘appropriation’ is in the 
seller’s mind, and there is no independent objective evidence of the ‘appropriation’; for 
example, in the seller’s books or records.
Where goods are in the possession of a third party, such as a warehousekeeper, and 
the third party sets the goods aside for delivery to the buyer, the goods are uncondition-
ally appropriated at the latest when a delivery order is accepted.137
It may well be that what is necessary to constitute an unconditional appropriation 
will vary according to the type of goods in question and the general circumstances 
of the case. In particular, where goods are being manufactured by the seller, the 
courts will not too readily infer that the materials have been appropriated since this 
might hamper the freedom of the seller to manufacture the goods as he thinks best. 
This consideration does not apply in the case of goods to be grown by the seller, and 
here it might well be held that the property in the goods, if sufficiently designated, 
passes as soon as they come into existence. So, also, where an unidentified part of a 
specified bulk is sold, the only thing necessary for appropriation is the separation of 
the part sold from the rest, with the assent of the parties.138 Thus in Aldridge v John-
son,139 the plaintiff agreed to buy 100 quarters of barley out of a particular parcel of 
200 quarters which he had inspected. It was held that as soon as the seller filled some 
sacks sent by the buyer with the barley, the property passed, even though the sacks 
were still in the seller’s possession.

	266	 The effects of the contract
Conditional appropriation
As to the qualification that the appropriation must be ‘unconditional’ if it is to pass the 
property, the general and most important rule is that the appropriation is not uncon-
ditional if the seller only means to let the buyer have the goods on payment.140 Prima 
facie any express or implied contractual stipulation141 showing that the seller intends to 
reserve some rights over the goods themselves (and not just contractual rights) until he 
has been fully paid makes the appropriation conditional, and prevents the property from 
passing until that happens.
Some important types of conditional contracts of sale are considered in s. 19, which 
actually applies to the sale of both specific and unascertained goods, but as, in practice, 
its application to unascertained goods is far more common it has been reserved for con-
sideration here. Section 19(1) is as follows:
Where there is a contract for the sale of specific goods or where goods are subsequently 
appropriated to the contract, the seller may, by the terms of the contract or appropriation, 
reserve the right of disposal of the goods until certain conditions are fulfilled; and in such a 
case, notwithstanding the delivery of the goods to the buyer, or to a carrier or other bailee . . . 
for the purpose of transmission to the buyer, the property in the goods does not pass to the 
buyer until the conditions imposed by the seller are fulfilled.
The courts have been very ready to find that the seller has reserved the right of disposal 
and that the buyer does not acquire property in the goods before actual delivery. In Re 
Shipton Anderson & Co Ltd and Harrison Bros & Co Ltd,142 the owner of a specific par-
cel of wheat in a warehouse sold it on the terms ‘payment cash within seven days against 
transfer order’. The goods were requisitioned by the government under emergency pow-
ers before delivery to the buyer. It was held by the Court of Appeal that the express 
term quoted above was in effect a right of disposal reserved by the seller, as he was not 
bound to hand over a delivery order until payment. Consequently, the property had not 
yet passed and the contract was frustrated by the seizure of the goods.
Section 19(1) is only a generalisation of the specific case dealt with by s. 19(2), which 
is concerned with goods sent by sea. Under this subsection, a shipper who receives from 
the carrier bills of lading whereby the goods are deliverable to him or to his order is taken 
to reserve the right of disposal because he can hold onto the bill of lading until he is paid 
or otherwise satisfied. Nobody can obtain the delivery of the goods without the bills of 
lading (at any rate without giving the shipping company an indemnity against the possi-
ble consequences), and the seller’s possession of these, where the goods are deliverable to 
him, therefore enables him to treat the goods as continued security for payment. As this 
is by far the most important illustration of the reservation of the right of disposal, more

ground. See too Mitsui & Co Ltd v Flota Mercante Grancolumbiana SA [1989] 1 All ER 951, discussed 
below, p. 346.

The transfer of property	 267
detailed consideration of this question will be postponed until Chapter 16, where export 
sales are dealt with.143
Yet another type of conditional contract is dealt with by s. 19(3):
Where the seller of goods draws on the buyer for the price, and transmits the bill of exchange 
and bill of lading to the buyer together to secure acceptance or payment of the bill of exchange, 
the buyer is bound to return the bill of lading if he does not honour the bill of exchange, and if 
he wrongfully retains the bill of lading the property in the goods does not pass to him.
In other words, the transfer of the property by the bill of lading in such a case is 
conditional upon the bill of exchange being honoured, and if, for example, the buyer 
should become bankrupt with the bill of lading still in his possession, and not having 
accepted the bill of exchange, the seller will be able to claim the goods. Similarly, if the 
buyer retains the bill of lading without paying for it, he is in breach of his duties to the 
seller; for example, if he takes delivery of the goods or sends the bill of lading on to a 
sub-buyer. In such circumstances, the buyer may be sued either for the tort of conversion 
or for the price of the goods, and his liability will be precisely the same in either case.144
It should be noted, however, that even if the property does not pass to the buyer 
because of the operation of this section, the seller is at risk in one important respect. 
Although he may be protected against the risk of the buyer becoming insolvent before he 
has paid for the goods, the seller is at risk that the buyer may resell the goods to a third 
party. As will be seen more fully in Chapter 23, the buyer may in this situation be able to 
pass a good title to a third party under various provisions of the Act, even though prop-
erty has not yet passed to him because the seller has reserved a right of disposal. If the 
buyer actually obtains the possession of the goods or of the bill of lading and transfers 
them to a sub-buyer who takes in good faith and for value, the sub-buyer gets a good title 
under s. 25(1), s. 47(2), and s. 10 of the Factors Act 1889.145
Reference was previously made to Rule 3 under which, in a sale of specific goods, the 
passing of the property is postponed if the seller is bound to weigh, measure, test or do 
some other act for the purpose of ascertaining the price. Although this Rule is confined 
to sales of specific goods, it seems that the position is the same in a sale of unascertained 
goods. In National Coal Board v Gamble,146 the appellants supplied coal as part of a bulk 
sale to a purchaser by loading it onto the buyer’s lorry at a colliery. The coal was loaded 
by means of a hopper and subsequently driven to a weighbridge, where the weight of the 
coal was ascertained and the statutory weight-ticket supplied. It was held that the prop-
erty did not pass until the coal had been weighed and the ticket given to and accepted 
by the buyer. The court had no doubt that if too much had been loaded onto the lorry 
the seller could have insisted on the excess being unloaded. It seems (although this was 
not stated in the judgments) that the correct analysis of the facts was that, although the 
coal was appropriated to the contract by being loaded onto the lorry, the appropriation 
was not unconditional until it was weighed and the weight-ticket accepted by the buyer.

	268	 The effects of the contract
On the other hand, in Edwards v Ddin147 (a prosecution under the Theft Act 1968) a dif-
ferent result was arrived at. Here it was said that when a person buys petrol at a filling 
station, the property passes as soon as it is put in the tank of the buyer’s vehicle. There is 
no reservation of rights by the seller, and the appropriation is unconditional. If the buyer 
does not pay, he may be guilty of an offence and can, of course, be sued for the price, 
but the property will have passed. It is perhaps unclear if the seller can detain the buyer’s 
vehicle or attempt to drain the petrol out of the tank in exercise of his lien. (For further 
discussion of the seller’s lien, see Chapter 18.)
Assent
The assent which Rule 5 requires for the appropriation may be express or implied. Where, 
therefore, the defendant sold some rice to the plaintiff from a specified parcel at a particu-
lar place, and sent the plaintiff a note of appropriation, his assent was implied from his 
failure to reply for a whole month.148 Consequently, although Rules 2 and 3 only require 
notice to be given to the buyer of the fulfilment of conditions in a sale of specific goods 
while Rule 5 requires the buyer’s assent, there may often be little difference in practice.
Rule 5(1) says that the assent may be given before or after the appropriation is made, 
and in some cases the assent may be inferred from the facts which take place when the 
contract is made, or when or before the appropriation takes place. So it has been held 
that the dispatch and receipt of invoices and delivery orders which clearly identified the 
goods being sold were enough to transfer property even though there was no further act 
or indication of assent to the appropriation by the buyer.149
As we have seen, Rule 5(2) states that where the goods are delivered to a carrier for 
shipment to the buyer the goods are taken to be unconditionally appropriated to the 
contract. Although this sub-rule does not actually say that the buyer’s assent must be 
taken to have been given in these circumstances, it is nevertheless clear that the custom-
ary course of business rests on the assumption that shipment is an unconditional appro-
priation with the assent of the buyer.150 The buyer’s assent is to be inferred from the 
nature of the transaction itself. It does not follow that property is always transferred on 
shipment; whether it is transferred then or later depends on the nature and terms of the 
contract. These questions are discussed in Chapter 24. Here it is merely desired to stress 
that the apparent absence of a prior assent to the appropriation does not prevent prop-
erty passing on shipment.
Unfortunately, this appears to be one of those areas in which a rule suitable for commer-
cial contracts is not necessarily suitable for consumer contracts. When a consumer orders 
goods by post, it is not necessarily appropriate for the law to treat the dispatch of the 
goods to him by the seller as passing the property because the result is that the goods will 
be at the buyer’s risk in the course of post. In Badische Anilin und Soda Fabrik v Basle

The transfer of property	 269
Chemical Works,151 the question was whether by posting the goods in Switzerland a Swiss 
seller had made, used, exercised or vended the invention within the ambit of a UK patent. 
The House of Lords held that it had not, the implication being that it was the buyer, who 
had ordered the goods, who was the infringer.152 Although it appears to have been held that 
the posting of ordered goods effected delivery to the buyer, and would thereby, presumably, 
have passed the property to him, this case is perhaps not decisive because this point was 
not disputed and the real issue in the case related to the patent law issues set out above. 
Moreover, there are other cases which suggest that the point may still be open in some con-
texts, although it cannot be said that any of them are directly in point.153
Transfer of property without unconditional appropriation
As we have seen under s. 18 Rule 5(1), the usual way in which property in unascertained 
goods is transferred to the buyer is by the goods becoming unconditionally appropri-
ated to the contract, but it is not the only possible way. In Karlshamns Oljefabriker v 
Eastport Navigation Corp,154 the plaintiffs bought 6,000 tons of copra c.i.f. Karlshamns. 
The sellers shipped 16,000 tons of copra on one ship, part of which was intended for 
the plaintiffs and part for other buyers. A small quantity, surplus to all the contractual 
requirements of the various buyers, was bought by F from the sellers and resold by them 
to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs thus obtained bills of lading first for the 6,000 tons, and 
second for the small extra quantity sold to F. But all the copra was shipped in undivided 
bulk, and it was held that no property could have passed on shipment, or on the transfer 
of the bills of lading. The ship called first at Rotterdam and then at Hamburg, discharg-
ing all the copra meant for other buyers, so that at this stage the only copra left was that 
destined for the plaintiffs. It was held by Mustill J that at this stage the property passed 
to the plaintiffs because the goods had become ascertained by a process of ‘exhaustion’. 
Mustill J went on to hold that it is not always necessary that the goods should be appro-
priated to the contract under Rule 5, although this is the commonest method by which 
the goods are ascertained. The essential requirements of the law, he held, are (1) that the 
goods should be, or have become, ascertained, and (2) that the parties should intend that 
the property be transferred. There is no independent third requirement that the goods 
should be unconditionally appropriated to the contract.155 Appropriation is only one 
way of ascertaining the goods. Mustill J also held that there was no reason why property 
should not pass even though it was not possible to say which part of the copra was to 
151	 [1898] AC 200; cf. The Albazero [1974] 2 All ER 906, 927 where Brandon J discusses this case. It was not 
discussed in the higher courts. The suggestion made in Badische that the Post Office is the buyer’s agent, 
which echoes views expressed in Household Fire Insurance v Grant (1879) 4 Ex D 216, cannot be sustained 
today – see Corbin on Contracts §78.
152	 This result seems consistent with the view that the seller is not in breach of the warranty of merchantable 
quality where an importer orders goods which cannot legally be sold in the importer’s territory (see Sumner 
Permain & Co v Webb [1922] 1 KB 551), and the related point on the fitness for purpose warranty which 
arose in Teheran Europe Co Ltd v S T Belton (Tractors) Ltd [1968] 2 QB 545 – see p. 193 above. It is also 
consistent with the rules which have developed in answering the question as to which party, the buyer or the 
seller, has the duty, in the absence of express agreement, to get an export licence – see p. 422 below.

be taken to be the 6,000 tons sold by the sellers direct, and which the extra quantity sold 
through F.156 The result of this case is confirmed by s. 1 of the Sale of Goods (Amend-
ment) Act 1995, discussed below, which adds s. (3) and (4) to s. 18, Rule 5.
Sale of unidentified part of an identified bulk
We have seen above that, no matter what the intention of the parties may be, the effect 
of s. 16 in its original form was that the property in goods could not pass until they had 
been ascertained, and we have also seen that this meant that where an unidentified and 
unascertained part of some bulk or whole was sold, then even though the bulk itself 
might be identified and ascertained, no property could pass until the part sold had been 
in some way physically severed or segregated from the remainder of the bulk, or at least 
earmarked so that the parts appropriated could readily be identified. The effect of s. 16 
in this respect caused some concern in certain contexts, and the Law Commissions pub-
lished a Report on the subject.157 It is now necessary to say something further by way of 
explanation of these concerns, and the reforms effected by the Sale of Goods (Amend-
ment) Act 1995 consequential on them.158
The legal problems which arise from the sale of an unidentified part of a definite bulk 
or whole involve two sets of relationships, although only one of them is of direct con-
cern to the subject-matter of this book. These two relationships are: first, that between 
seller and buyer and, secondly, that between the buyer and the carrier where the goods 
are in process of being transported (by sea or air, for instance) from seller to buyer. The 
relationship which concerns us is that of the seller and buyer.
It often happens that the transaction between seller and buyer is completed in all 
essentials, even to the extent of the buyer actually paying for the goods, while the goods 
are still in the possession of the seller himself, or of a carrier. If at that stage the goods 
were ascertained and identified, the property in them would pass to the buyer and two 
consequences would follow from this. First, the buyer would be protected from the risk 
of the seller’s insolvency because if the property has passed to the buyer he can sim-
ply lay claim to the goods themselves if the seller becomes bankrupt. And secondly, the 
goods would prima facie be at the buyer’s risk, so that any subsequent deterioration or 
damage to the goods would no longer be the responsibility of the seller. But where the 
goods were an unidentified part of a bulk so that property could not pass as a result of s. 
16 in its original form these consequences would not follow, and the results often seemed 
largely fortuitous. We have already seen one example of these fortuitous results, namely 
Healy v Howlett & Sons159 where the property in the fish being sold to the defendant 
would in the ordinary way have passed to him and with it the risk of delay and dete-
rioration, when the goods were dispatched to the buyer. But because in that particular 
case the goods were dispatched with similar goods to other buyers, and were not phys-
ically earmarked for the defendant himself, the property could not pass and neither did 
156	 In other words, the plaintiffs were entitled to the whole, albeit under separate contracts.

The transfer of property	 271
the risk. That result was somewhat unsatisfactory because the outcome depended on 
the happenstance of when the railway officials allocated the defendant his boxes. This 
particular problem is, however, unusual because in most cases of this nature (particu-
larly where the goods are dispatched by sea) there is no doubt that the risk will pass on 
shipment, even if the property does not or cannot pass, and there is, indeed, one leading 
authority which suggests that even in other circumstances the risk in an unidentified part 
of a specified bulk may pass before the property.160
A more disturbing consequence of s. 16 was that a buyer might find that although he 
thought he had obtained the property in the goods and had paid for them, he had no prop-
erty, and remained vulnerable to the risk of the seller’s insolvency because of the purely 
accidental or fortuitous fact that the goods were not ascertained. This problem was per-
haps most acute where part of a large cargo of goods was sold while they were at sea, as 
happened in the Karlshamns Oljefabriker case, which was discussed above. This is today 
a more frequent occurrence than it used to be because ships are larger, cargoes bigger, and 
buyers therefore are more often buying proportionately smaller quantities. Buyers often 
receive bills of lading from sellers (who have, of course, received the bills from the shipping 
company concerned) and bills of lading are universally regarded by commercial parties 
as firm documents of title. So buyers (and also banks) quite happily pay good money in 
exchange for bills of lading in the confident belief that the bills give an unqualified right to 
the possession of the goods, yet in these cases where the bills of lading only cover part of 
a bulk cargo it was clear that no unqualified title was passed because of s. 16 of the Act.
That these difficulties could also arise in other contexts is shown by the facts of In re 
London Wine Co (Shippers) Ltd,161 a case decided in 1975 though not fully reported 
until 1986. In this case a company sold wine to customers, while retaining possession 
of the wine. The customers paid for the wine, as well as for subsequent storage charges, 
and the seller gave the buyers ‘certificates of title’, but there was no actual earmarking 
or physical segregation of the wine sold to the different customers. The wine company 
became insolvent, and the receiver (representing mortgagees or chargees) claimed that 
all the wine still belonged to the company, a claim which was ultimately upheld by Oliver 
J in a lengthy and complex judgment.162
The situation was further complicated in this case because separate claims were made 
on behalf of several different groups of buyers. One group claimed that in some cases 
the buyer had bought the whole stock of a particular description of wine owned by the 
company, so that the property might have passed by ‘exhaustion’ as in the Karlshamns 
Oljefabriker case, discussed above. But this claim failed because the wine had not been 
sold as part of a particular consignment or bulk, but had merely been described as ‘lying 
in bond’. So although the sellers may genuinely have intended in their own minds to tie 
in the sales with a particular stock of wine of that description, they were under no legal 
obligation to do so. That particular stock of wine belonged to them, not the buyers; the 
160	 See p. 411.
161	 (1986) PCC 121.
162	 Oliver J’s judgment was approved by the Privy Council in Re Goldcorp Exchange Ltd [1994] 2 All ER 806, 
in which, however, the facts were not precisely the same – the case involved claims to unallocated stocks 
of bullion, and the PC was of the view that the parties could not have intended to create an interest in its 
general stock of bullion which would have inhibited the (now insolvent) bullion company’s dealings in it. 
See also Mac-Jordan Construction Ltd v Brookmount Erostin Ltd [1992] BCLC 350.

	272	 The effects of the contract
sellers could have disposed of it elsewhere and bought further stocks to satisfy the buyers 
without any breach of contract.
A second group of buyers who had together bought the whole stock of a particular 
description of wine argued that between them they could have been treated as co-buyers, 
so that property could have passed to them jointly. But this claim failed for the same 
reason as in the case of the first group of buyers. A third group of buyers had actu-
ally received acknowledgments (attornments) either from the company itself, or from 
independent warehousemen who held the stock, but their claims also failed because of 
the basic fact that no ascertainment had taken place under s. 16. However, it must be 
noted that in Re Stapylton Fletcher,163 in which cases of wine were separately stored for a 
group of customers, it was held that for the purposes of s. 16 property had passed to the 
customers, the customers taking as tenants in common.164 Judge Paul Baker QC, citing 
Staughton J’s review of the authorities in Indian Oil Corp Ltd v Greenstone Shipping 
Co SA (Panama),165 concluded that it was possible to use the tenancy in common as a 
tool for remedying unforeseen mixing, and that if the creation of a tenancy in common 
could be brought about by construction of law, it could equally be brought about by 
agreement express or to be inferred from the circumstances. He concluded that from the 
evidence it could readily be inferred that the parties intended the property in the goods 
to pass when they were set aside for storage. It was the separation of the goods from the 
company’s trading assets, whether done physically, or by giving instructions to a bonded 
warehouse keeper, which caused the goods to be ascertained for the purposes of s. 16.166
As a result of these difficulties (as well as difficulties arising from the relations 
between buyer and carrier, which are not strictly within the subject-matter of this book), 
the Law Commissions suggested that there should be a new rule on sale of goods out of 
a bulk which would enable property in an undivided share to pass before ascertainment 
of goods relating to specific sales contracts.167 We must now deal with this.
The Sale of Goods (Amendment) Act 1995168
This Act, which came into force on 19 September 1995 (but had no retrospective effect 
on any contract concluded before that date),169 implements the recommendations of the 
English and Scottish Law Commissions in the Report discussed above. The Act does two 
things: (1) it puts into statutory form the doctrine of ‘ascertainment by exhaustion’;170 
and (2) it enables property in an undivided share forming part of an identified bulk to 
pass before ascertainment of the goods relating to the specific sales contract or con-
tracts. We will deal with these in turn, but first we must consider what is meant by ‘bulk’ 
for these purposes.

The transfer of property	 273
The definition of ‘bulk’ for the purposes of these subsections
Section 2 of the 1995 Act provides that in s. 61(1) of the 1979 Act, after the definition of 
‘action’ there shall be inserted the following definition:
‘bulk’ means a mass of goods of the same kind which—
(a)	 is contained in a defined space or area; and
(b)	 is such that any goods in the bulk are interchangeable with any other goods therein of the 
same number or quantity; . . . 171
Ascertainment by exhaustion
As recommended by the Law Commissions, the effect of the doctrine of ascertainment 
by exhaustion172 is now confirmed by s. 1 of the Sale of Goods (Amendment) Act 1995. 
This inserts the following words:
(2)	 In section 18 of the 1979 Act, at the end of rule 5 there shall be added the following—
(3)	 Where there is a contract for the sale of a specified quantity of unascertained goods in 
a deliver-able state forming part of a bulk which is identified either in the contract or by 
subsequent agreement between the parties and the bulk is reduced to (or to less than) that 
quantity, then, if the buyer under that contract is the only buyer to whom goods are then 
due out of the bulk—
(a)	 the remaining goods shall be taken as appropriated to that contract at the time when the 
bulk is so reduced; and
(b)	 the property in those goods then passes to that buyer.
(4)	 Paragraph (3) above applies also (with the necessary modifications) where a bulk is 
reduced to (or less than) the aggregate of the quantities due to a single buyer under 
separate contracts relating to that bulk and he is the only buyer to whom goods are 
then due out of that bulk.
It should be noted that this section applies not only where there is only one contract 
with one buyer, but also where there is more than one contract with one buyer. It also 
applies where there is more than one buyer initially, but because of deliveries to the other 
buyers, there is left only one buyer entitled to the residue of the bulk.
The situation where there is more than one buyer entitled to the identified bulk is 
dealt with by the next subsection of s. 1 of the 1995 Act.
Undivided shares in goods forming part of a bulk
Section 16 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 is amended by insertion of the words ‘Subject 
to section 20A below . . .’. After s. 20 of the 1979 Act the following section is inserted:
20A 	(1)	 This section applies to a contract for the sale of a specified quantity of unascertained 
goods if the following conditions are met—
(a)	 the goods or some of them form part of a bulk which is identified either in the 
contract or by subsequent agreement between the parties; and
(b)	 the buyer has paid the price for some or all of the goods which are the subject of 
the contract and which form part of the bulk.
171	 For illustrations, see n. 176 below.
172	 See p. 269 above.

	274	 The effects of the contract
	
(2)	 Where this section applies then (unless the parties agree otherwise), as soon as the 
conditions specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (1) above are met or at 
such later time as the parties may agree—
(a)  property in an undivided share in the bulk is transferred to the buyer, and
(b)  the buyer becomes owner in common of the bulk.
	
(3)	 Subject to subsection (4) below, for the purposes of this section the undivided share 
of a buyer in a bulk at any time shall be such share as the quantity of goods paid for 
and due to the buyer out of the bulk bears to the quantity of goods in the bulk at that 
time.
	
(4)	 Where the aggregate of the undivided shares of buyers in a bulk determined under 
subsection (3) above would at any time exceed the whole of the bulk at that time, the 
undivided share in the bulk of each buyer shall be reduced proportionately so that 
the aggregate of the undivided shares is equal to the whole bulk.
	
(5)	 Where a buyer has paid the price for only some of the goods due to him out of a 
bulk, any delivery to the buyer out of the bulk shall, for the purposes of this section, 
be ascribed in the first place to the goods in respect of which payment has been made.
	
(6)	 For the purposes of this section payment of part of the price for any goods shall be 
treated as payment for a corresponding part of the goods.
Thus for the section to apply, three conditions must be satisfied: (1) there must be a 
sale of a specified quantity;173 (2) the bulk must be identified;174 (3) the buyer must have 
paid for some or all of the goods.175 The new section is not limited to goods in a deliv-
erable state.176 It is also concerned with quantity, not shares expressed as fractions or 
percentages. The effect of s. 20A(3) is that the buyer’s undivided share is such a share as 
the goods paid for and due to him bear to the quantity of goods in the bulk at that time. 
Where deliveries have been made to the buyer of some of the goods forming part of the 
bulk, and the buyer has paid for only some of the goods, the deliveries are to be ascribed 
in the first place to the goods paid for.177
Section 20A(1)(b), (3) and (5) make reference to the case where a buyer has paid for 
some only of the goods due from the bulk under the contract. Part-payments would not 
normally be treated as relating to any particular portion of the goods due under the 
contract, it was necessary therefore for s. 20A(6) to provide that part-payments are to be 
treated as payments for part.
173	 As opposed to a sale of a fraction such as a third of a bulk – see Law Com. No. 215, para. 6.3.
174	 1995 Act, s. 2(a) amending 1979 Act, s. 61(1), as indicated above. The Law Commissions give the following 
illustrations of an identified bulk: (a) a cargo of wheat in a named ship; (b) a mass of barley in an identified 
silo; (c) the oil in an identified storage tank; (d) cases of wine (all of the same kind) in an identified cellar; 
(e) ingots of gold (all of the same kind) in an identified vault; (f) bags of fertiliser (all of the same kind) in 
an identified storehouse; (g) a heap of coal in the open at an identified location. See, ibid., para. 4.3. Thus 
the seller’s general stock is not intended to be an identified bulk – ibid.
175	 Section 20A(1)(b), added by 1995 Act, s. 1(3) and ibid., para. 6.4. The reason for this exclusion is that the 
buyer who has not paid suffers no loss because payment and delivery are concurrent conditions – s. 28. 
Unfortunately, this appears to have the consequence that a seller’s liquidator can decide whether or not to 
deliver according to whether the market price of the goods is above or below the contract price.
176	 Ibid., para. 5.6 – goods forming part of an undivided share would never be in a deliverable state within the 
meaning of s. 61(5), 1979 Act.
177	 Section 20A(5), added by 1995 Act, s. 1(3). The definition of ‘delivery’ in s. 61(1) is amended by adding 
the words ‘except that in relation to sections 20A and 20B above it includes such appropriation of goods 
to the contract as results in property in the goods being transferred to the buyer’. As to ‘unconditional 
appropriation’, see p. 260.

	
	 	
The transfer of property	 275
The aggregate shares of two or more buyers can never exceed the whole of the bulk.178 
In such cases, the undivided share of each buyer is reduced proportionately so that the 
aggregate of the undivided shares is equal to the whole of the bulk.179
Unless otherwise agreed, property in an undivided share passes as soon as the buyer 
has paid for all, or some, of the contract goods, and the buyer thus becomes an owner in 
common of the bulk.180 This does not seem to answer the question about the allocation 
of risk between buyer and seller. Section 20B(3)(c) provides that nothing in the section 
shall affect the rights of any buyer under his contract, and the Report indicates that the 
co-ownership of the bulk is without prejudice to the buyers’ contractual rights.181 They 
are still entitled to goods which conform to the contract in quantity and quality. Presum-
ably, then, risk passes when property passes under s. 18, Rule 5, though delay on the part 
of the buyer in taking delivery could affect this.182
Deemed consent by co-owner to dealings in bulk goods
The effect of creating undivided shares in an identified bulk would be similar to the 
situation which existed in relation to undivided shares in land in England before 1926: it 
would require all the part-owners to be joined in order to transfer any part of the bulk, 
and in turn the tracing of title to each part share.183 Section 20B deals with this by deem-
ing consent by the other co-owners to a sale by one co-owner:
	
(1)	 A person who has become an owner in common of a bulk by virtue of section 20A 
above shall be deemed to have consented to—
(a)	 any delivery of goods out of the bulk to any other owner in common of the 
bulk, being goods which are due to him under his contract;
(b)	 any dealing with or removal, delivery or disposal of goods in the bulk by any 
other person who is an owner in common of the bulk in so far as the goods fall

	276	 The effects of the contract
The purpose of s. 20B(2) is to protect liquidators and other such persons who step 
into the buyer’s shoes on his or her insolvency.184 They are protected against any action 
by other co-owning buyers who may receive short delivery because the bulk is insuffi-
cient to meet all claims, as a result of any dealing with the goods of the sort specified in 
s. 20B(1)(a) or (b).
Section 20B(3) makes it clear that the rules do not: (a) impose any obligation on 
a buyer who takes delivery of goods out of a bulk to compensate others who receive 
short delivery as a result; (b) affect any contractual arrangements between the buy-
ers for adjustments between themselves; or (c) alter or diminish contractual rights of 
the buyer against the seller. If a seller, having sold 50 tonnes out of an identified bulk 
of 100 tonnes, were subsequently to sell 60 tonnes to a second buyer who bought in 
good faith without notice, the second buyer would acquire a good title by virtue of 
s. 24 of the Act,185 but the first buyer would still have a remedy against the seller for 
non-delivery of 10 tonnes. Similarly, any sub-buyer of the first buyer who had been 
sold 50 tonnes would have a remedy for the shortfall of 10 tonnes against the first 
buyer.
The effect of these provisions
Thus, if a buyer who has agreed to buy 50 tonnes out of a bulk of 100 tonnes has paid  
50 per cent of the price, and taken delivery of 10 tonnes, he would be taken to have paid 
for a further 15 tonnes. The buyer’s entitlement as a proportion will necessarily fluctuate 
as the size of the bulk fluctuates. If the bulk is reduced to such a point that it is the same 
or less than the buyer’s entitlement, the buyer will be entitled to the whole under s. 18, 
Rule 5(3), introduced by the 1995 Act, s. 1(2).
It was perfectly possible for two or more persons to own goods in common under 
suitably drafted contracts under the law as it was before the 1995 Act came into force 
(to own ‘undivided shares’ as the law puts it).186 Indeed, it has been held that if a seller 
appropriates goods to the contract, so that property passes to the buyer, and the seller 
thereafter wrongfully (even accidentally) mixes goods of his own with the goods sold 
(as where an oil cargo, for instance, is sold and then other oil is placed in the same 
tanks) the buyer and the seller would thereupon become co-owners of the resulting 
whole.187 And presumably it must be possible for one person to sell an undivided share 
in specific goods to another so that the buyer thereupon becomes a co-owner with the 
seller. It is, indeed, quite common for several persons to be co-owners of certain types of 
property; for example, racehorses, and there seems no reason why one owner cannot sell 
a share in a horse so that the buyer becomes a co-owner.188 Similarly, the parties could 
become co-owners where a buyer or buyers are sold a specified share in an identified

The transfer of property	 277
bulk expressed as a fraction of the whole,189 provided it was clear from the terms of the 
contract or the surrounding circumstances that was the intention of the parties. Any 
lingering doubts about these matters should be put to rest by the amendments to s. 61 
of the 1979 Act effected by the 1995 Act.190 ‘Goods’ now includes an undivided share in 
goods. ‘Specific goods’ includes an undivided share, specified as a fraction of the goods 
identified or agreed upon, so that the sale of a quarter share in a racehorse is a sale of 
specific goods. But such a transaction is quite different from a sale where the intention 
is that goods forming part of an unascertained bulk will ultimately be divided and part 
transferred to the buyer, while parts either remain with the seller or are to be transferred 
to a different buyer or buyers. This is the situation in which ss. 16 and 17 of the Act pre-
vented the property from passing and which is addressed by the provisions of the 1995 
Act discussed above.
The position in equity prior to the 1995 Act
While common law insisted on identification of the particular thing sold, English equity 
was apparently less stringent.191 In Tailby v Official Receiver,192 Lord Watson stated the 
single requirement of equity ‘which must be fulfilled in order to make the assignee’s 
right attach to a future chose in action, which is that on its coming into existence it shall 
answer the description in the assignment, or, in other words, that it shall be capable of 
being identified as the thing, or as one of the very things assigned’. It seems to have been 
thought that physical identification or ascertainment might not be required in equity 
so long as the thing sold belonged to an identified bulk or whole. If the contract was 
one which a court of equity would enforce by a decree of specific performance, it was 
thought that an equitable interest in the property might be held to pass as soon as the 
property came into existence and could be made identifiable, presumably by physical 
separation.
It was never entirely clear before the passing of the Sale of Goods Act whether (and, 
if so, to what extent) this equitable doctrine applied to an ordinary sale of unascer-
tained goods. It certainly applied to the assignment of a future chose in action and to a 
covenant to convey or mortgage real estate. In these cases, the equitable doctrine meant 
that once the property came into the hands of the seller, or the chose in action became 
currently due, the assignee or buyer was entitled to the property or chose in preference 
to judgment creditors or a trustee in bankruptcy of the seller or assignor. But an ordi-
nary contract of sale of goods has never been specifically enforceable in equity, though 
there are dicta in Holroyd v Marshall193 suggesting that a contract for the sale of specific 
goods or of an unspecified part of a specified bulk may be so enforceable.
For some years after the passing of the 1893 Act it was an open question whether this 
equitable rule was applicable to contracts of sale of goods, but the question seems to 
189	 Section 2(2) recognises a sale between one part owner and another, but there was nevertheless some doubt 
whether the sale of an undivided share was a sale of goods. The Law Commissions’ Report No. 215 
recommended that the point be clarified – para. 5.3.

	278	 The effects of the contract
have been settled. In Re Wait,194 Wait bought 1,000 tons of wheat which was expected 
to be loaded on a named vessel, the Challenger, on 20 November 1925. The following 
day he contracted to sell 500 tons of this to X. The wheat was shipped in one undivided 
load, and one bill of lading for the whole load was issued. X paid Wait on 5 February, 
and Wait went bankrupt on 24 February. The ship arrived on 28 February. Wait’s trustee 
claimed the whole 1,000 tons as assets in the bankruptcy, while X claimed either that he 
had an equitable assignment or charge on the 500 tons, or that he was entitled to specific 
performance of the contract under s. 52. A majority of the Court of Appeal decided 
against X on both grounds.195 There had clearly been insufficient appropriation at law to 
pass the property and Lord Hanworth MR was of the opinion that, even if the equitable 
doctrine of Tailby v Official Receiver survived the Sale of Goods Act, the goods were not 
sufficiently identified even in equity. But Atkin LJ went much further than Lord Han-
worth. He denied that equity would ever have applied its doctrines to an ordinary sale of 
future goods. He went on to say that even if equity would ever have applied its doctrine 
to such a case, it could not do so now having regard to the Sale of Goods Act. He said:196
The Code was passed at a time when the principles of equity and equitable remedies were 
recognized and given effect to in all our courts, and the particular equitable remedy of spe-
cific performance is specially referred to in s. 52. The total sum of legal relations (meaning by 
the word ‘legal’ existing in equity as well as in common law) arising out of the contract for  
the sale of goods may well be regarded as defined by the Code. It would have been futile in a 
Code intended for commercial men to have created an elaborate structure of rules dealing with 
rights at law, if at the same time it was intended to leave, subsisting with the legal rights equita-
ble rights inconsistent with, more extensive, and coming into existence earlier than the rights so 
carefully set out in the various sections of the Code.
The rules for transfer of property as between seller and buyer, performance of the contract, 
rights of the unpaid seller against the goods, unpaid seller’s lien, remedies of the seller, reme-
dies of the buyer, appear to be complete and exclusive statements of the legal relations both in 
law and equity.
These are powerful arguments and they have the support of subsequent authority.197 
Accordingly, the only issue in cases of this kind is whether or not the property in the 
goods has passed in accordance with the rules set out in s. 18 (as amended) and s. 20A 
inserted by the 1995 Act.198

Risk and frustration
Risk and frustration distinguished
When a person is bound to bear the accidental loss of, or damage to, goods, they are said 
to be at his risk. Sometimes, also, a contract for the sale of goods, like any other contract, 
may be totally frustrated by some extraordinary and (usually) unforeseeable event. Because 
frustration is sometimes also relevant where goods are destroyed or even severely damaged, 
the two sets of legal principles are interconnected in various ways. Indeed, the doctrine of 
frustration is sometimes said to be merely an aspect of the general rules as to risk, but this 
is not entirely accurate. If an executory contract is frustrated, neither party is under any 
liability to the other. On the other hand, if the goods are at the seller’s risk and they perish 
or deteriorate, although the buyer is not liable to the seller for the price, it by no means 
follows that the seller is not liable to the buyer for non-delivery if the buyer can prove that 
he has suffered loss therefrom. The rules as to risk have nothing to say in such a case, and 
if the seller is to be exempted from liability, it must be by the doctrine of frustration. Con-
versely, if the goods are at the buyer’s risk, he is clearly liable for the price even though the 
goods have perished or deteriorated. But it does not follow that he may not also be liable 
for damages for non-acceptance if the seller can prove that he has suffered any.1 Only frus-
tration can discharge the buyer from the liability for non-acceptance.
Nonetheless, the doctrines of risk and frustration are undoubtedly related, and it is 
convenient to consider them in the same chapter. The next three sections will therefore 
examine the transfer of risk, frustration and effects of frustration. As the following 
pages will demonstrate, the whole subject of risk and frustration is intertwined with 
the distinction between specific and unascertained goods, and by the failure of the Sale 
of Goods Act to draw any distinction between different types of unascertained goods. 
Indeed, it is difficult at times to avoid the conclusion that the draftsmen of both the Sale 
of Goods Act and the Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act 1943 forgot that there 
were sales of unascertained goods other than purely generic goods.
Transfer of risk
The general rule laid down by s. 20(1) is that prima facie the risk passes with the 
property:
Unless otherwise agreed, the goods remain at the seller’s risk until the property in them is 
transferred to the buyer, but when the property in them is transferred to the buyer, the goods 
are at the buyer’s risk whether delivery has been made or not.
	1	 For example, for storage charges: see the Sale of Goods Act, s. 37.

	280	 The effects of the contract
If there is an express agreement that one party is to bear the risk even though he has 
no property (as, e.g. there always is in contracts of sale subject to reservation of title 
clauses), effect must be given to the agreement. In the absence of such an express con-
tract, it has been said that ‘the rule res perit domino is generally an unbending rule of 
law arising from the very nature of property’.2 While this is no doubt largely true in a sit-
uation where property remains with one person throughout, it is not necessarily true of 
the situation where property is being transferred from one party to another. In this situ-
ation, there is nothing unusual about separating the transfer of risk from the transfer of 
property and this commonly happens where goods are shipped under a c.i.f. or an f.o.b. 
contract.3 Apart from these cases, two other exceptional cases seem to be established by 
the authorities, in one of which the risk passes before the property and, in the other, the 
risk passes after the property. The best example of the former exception is Sterns Ltd v 
Vickers Ltd.4 The defendants in this case sold to the plaintiffs 120,000 gallons of spirit, 
which was part of a total quantity of 200,000 gallons in a storage tank belonging to a 
third party. The plaintiffs obtained a delivery order which the third party accepted, but 
the plaintiffs decided to leave the spirit in the tank for the time being for their own con-
venience. The spirit deteriorated in quality between the time of sale and the time when 
the plaintiffs eventually took delivery of the 120,000 gallons. Despite the fact that the 
property clearly had not passed because the goods sold had not been ascertained in the 
technical sense, and therefore there had been no appropriation, the Court of Appeal held 
that the risk had passed to the buyers.
Although the decision in Sterns Ltd v Vickers Ltd appears to have been approved by 
the House of Lords5 and must therefore be accepted as correct on its particular facts, 
the case raises many problems which are closely related to the difficulties arising with 
regard to the passing of property. As we saw in the last chapter,6 a sale of an unidentified 
part of a bulk, as in this case, could not, before the changes effected by the Sale of 
Goods (Amendment) Act 1995,7 pass property in the goods because of s. 16. The 1995 
Act permits property in an undivided share to pass to the buyer, but otherwise, as we 
have seen, the passing of property, and therefore risk, seems still to be governed by s. 18, 
Rule 5. But although property in the goods could not, and still cannot, pass, the facts of 
Sterns Ltd v Vickers Ltd illustrate a situation where, for all practical purposes, the goods 
‘belong’ to the buyers and so it seems desirable that they should be treated as being at the 
buyers’ risk, as the court there held. But of course the problems which prevented the law 
from treating the property as passing can also affect the question of risk. Suppose, for 
example, that the spirit had been stored in two separate tanks each containing 100,000 
gallons and that the contents of one tank only had deteriorated, would the buyer have 
been compelled to take all the deteriorated spirit, or would he have been able to claim 
all the spirit from the other tank? Or should the good and bad spirit be divided between 
the parties in proportion to their respective interests? This latter solution appeared to be 
	2	 See the Scots case, Hansen v Craig & Rose (1895) 21 D 432, 438 per Lord President Inglis, cited by Lord 
Normand in Comptoir d’Achat et de Vente SA v Luis de Ridder Limitada (The Julia) [1949] AC 293, 319.

Risk and frustration	 281
the logical conclusion from Sterns Ltd v Vickers Ltd, since it gives effect to the holding 
that the risk is on the buyer and, at the same time, it offers a fair solution to the problem. 
The 1995 Act, for the reasons explained above, does not seem to add anything to this 
problem.8
The exceptional nature of this case was emphasised by the House of Lords in 
Comptoir d’Achat et de Vente SA v Luis de Ridder Limitada (The Julia),9 where Lord 
Porter said:
It is difficult to see how a parcel is at the buyer’s risk when he has neither property nor 
possession except in such cases as Inglis v Stock[10] and Sterns Ltd v Vickers Ltd[11] where the 
purchaser had an interest in an undivided part of a bulk parcel on board a ship, or elsewhere, 
obtained by attornment of the bailee to him.12
And Lord Normand observed:
In those cases in which it has been held that the risk without the property has passed to the 
buyer it has been because the buyer rather than the seller was seen to have an immediate and 
practical interest in the goods,13 as for instance when he has an immediate right under the 
storekeeper’s delivery warrant to the delivery of a portion of an undivided bulk in store, or an 
immediate right under several contracts with different persons to the whole of a bulk not yet 
appropriated to the several contracts.14
It can be seen, therefore, that the acceptance of the delivery warrant in Sterns Ltd v 
Vickers Ltd was regarded as the crucial factor in the case, since it was this which gave the 
buyer an immediate right to possession.15 This may serve to distinguish Healy v Howlett &  
Sons,16 which is otherwise very similar on its facts to Sterns Ltd v Vickers Ltd. Here,  
it will be recalled, it was held that the risk in 20 boxes of fish, which were dispatched to 
the buyer as part of a total of 190 boxes, none of which had been earmarked for him, 
was still on the seller. The court pointed out the difficulties which would have arisen 
if only some of the boxes had deteriorated or perished. As we have seen,17 the Law 
Commissions’ proposals on the sale of goods forming part of a bulk and the 1995 Act18 
did not deal with this problem directly. The Report indicated that the buyer should be 
entitled to delivery of goods which conform to the contract in quantity and quality, and 
that nothing in the new provisions should affect the buyer’s rights under the contract.19

13	 But this is not really so as regards c.i.f. contracts, for the seller retains the general property, and the buyer has

	282	 The effects of the contract
The Commissions are not intending to affect the result in situations similar to those in 
the cases discussed above in which it was held that the risk of loss or damage to goods 
forming part of a bulk could pass to a buyer prior to delivery.
It should, moreover, be remembered that it is only in the sale of an unidentified part 
of a specific whole that it can ever be held that the risk passes before the property in 
a sale of unascertained goods. It clearly cannot do so in the case of goods not owned 
or possessed by the seller, except in the sense that the buyer may conceivably have con-
tracted to pay the price whether or not the goods are delivered.
It is not easy to imagine circumstances in which the risk remains with the seller after 
the property has passed in the absence of express agreement to this effect, but if the 
decision in Head v Tattersall20 has survived the Act, it may provide an illustration of 
such a case. The plaintiff in this case bought a horse from the defendant, warranted 
to have been hunted with the Bicester hounds, and the plaintiff was given a week in 
which to return the horse if it did not answer the description. The horse was accidentally 
injured before the week was up, and the plaintiff claimed to return it, having discovered 
that it had not been hunted with the Bicester hounds. It was held that the plaintiff was 
entitled to return the horse and recover the price. The risk was thus held to be on the 
seller although the property had probably passed to the buyer, subject to the possibility 
of being divested.21 There is no reason to think that the case would not be decided in 
the same way today, but in most such cases, of course, the property does not pass until 
the expiry of the time fixed in accordance with s. 18, Rule 4(b). However, the decision 
may well illustrate a broader principle of some importance, namely that the risk always 
remains on the seller when the buyer has a right of rejection. Thus if the seller ships 
or delivers defective goods (or if there is a shortfall in quantity)22 so that the buyer is 
entitled to reject, it seems that the risk remains on the seller unless and until the buyer 
accepts the goods. Although this rule is not actually spelt out in the Act,23 it seems to 
follow from the rules as to acceptance.24 As will be seen later, there is nothing in these 
rules to prevent rejection merely because the goods have been accidentally lost or dam-
aged, and by exercising his right to reject the buyer can thus effectively throw the risk on 
the seller.
A fairly common instance of an express agreement, under which the property passes 
before the risk, occurs where the seller agrees to dispatch specific goods at his own risk 
to the buyer. In this event, the seller is only liable for deterioration or destruction not 
necessarily incident to the course of transit, for s. 33 provides:
Where the seller of goods agrees to deliver them at his own risk at a place other than that where 
they are when sold, the buyer must, nevertheless (unless otherwise agreed), take any risk of 
deterioration in the goods necessarily incident to the course of transit.
20	 (1870) LR 7 Ex 7.
21	 This, at least, appears to have been the view of Cleasby B. Neither Kelly CB nor Bramwell B expressed any 
view on the matter. Given that the underlying nature of the transaction in that case appears to have been a 
sale subject to a right of rescission, it is suggested that Cleasby B’s view was correct – see Adams, Essays for 
Clive Schmitthoff (1983, Professional Books), pp. 1, 3.

Risk and frustration	 283
It seems that the words ‘any risk . . . necessarily incident to the course of transit’ must 
be confined to risks which would have arisen with any goods answering the contract 
description.25 Thus, a risk of deterioration which is only incidental to the course of tran-
sit because of the defective condition of the goods at the commencement of the transit 
is not covered by this provision. Reference has already been made to Mash & Murrell v 
Joseph I Emmanuel Ltd,26 where it was held that the implied condition that the goods 
are of merchantable quality involves a continuing obligation as to the condition of the 
goods for a reasonable time after shipment in a c.i.f. contract, and to the apparent affir-
mation of this principle by the House of Lords.27
These cases prompt the question whether there is any need for a separate ‘doctrine’ of 
risk, at least so far as deterioration of the goods is concerned. It seems to accord more 
with the techniques of the English and Scottish law of sale to approach such questions 
by asking whether the seller has continuously warranted the condition of the goods. If 
so, then clearly the seller remains liable for the deterioration in their condition. If not, 
then indeed the risk is the buyer’s, but it is perhaps misleading to think of the risk of 
deterioration in almost tangible terms as something which ‘passes’ from seller to buyer. 
There is no distinction in principle between the risk of deterioration, which is treated 
by s. 20 as passing with the property, and the ordinary risk which every buyer takes in 
respect of matters not covered by conditions and warranties imposed on the seller.
It may, indeed, be that a similar analysis could be made of the risk of accidental 
destruction of the goods. The question which is most likely to arise in such circum-
stances is whether the buyer remains liable to pay the price or whether the seller’s 
inability to deliver the goods discharges the buyer. Prima facie, one would have 
thought that the latter should be the case because payment and delivery are, under 
s. 28 of the Act, concurrent conditions. But this is not the law because if the goods 
are accidentally destroyed after the property has passed, the presumption is that the 
risk has also passed, and the buyer must therefore pay the price even though the seller 
cannot deliver the goods. It is, however, far from obvious why the risk of accidental 
destruction should be on the buyer prior to delivery, except in the case of goods which 
are shipped for dispatch to the buyer, where special considerations arise. Indeed, in 
retail sales the technical legal position is so grotesque that it is difficult to believe that 
a seller would ever take advantage of it. If, for example, a person buys an article in a 
shop for later delivery and the shop is burned down with its stock overnight, the buyer 
would probably be astonished to learn that he might still be liable for the price.28 In 
fact, the goods would almost certainly be insured and, if the buyer were required to 
25	 See (1965) 28 MLR 180, 189 and [1962] J Bus L 352. As suggested above, it is arguable that the risk in non-
conforming goods always remains with the seller – see Head v Tattersall (1871) LR 7 Ex 7, p. 345 above. The 
proposition may gain support from Kinnear v Brodie (1901) 3 F 540; Gow, Mercantile Law (W. Green & 
Sons, Edinburgh), pp. 149, 184, 185. See also Scottish Law Commission Memorandum No. 25, ‘Corporeal

The question of who should bear the risk of accidental destruction, therefore, boils 
down in modern conditions to who should be required to insure them. It is surely very 
doubtful whether the present rule, which lays the obligation to insure (or, more strictly, 
the risk of not insuring) on the party who has the property, is in most circumstances the 
right solution. Certainly in retail sales and similar transactions, a powerful case could be 
made for saying that the most appropriate person to insure would nearly always be the 
party with physical possession, if only because in practice this is what would normally 
happen.30 To take a simple example, in a hire-purchase agreement the person who ought 
to insure the goods is clearly the person in possession and, of course, all hire-purchase 
agreements of vehicles impose an obligation to insure on the hirer.
Even in bulk sales, it seems doubtful whether the present rule is the most appropriate 
one. Here again it seems probable that the right person to insure normally is the person 
in physical possession, although it may be that special provision would be necessary in 
relation to insurance while the goods are in the hands of a carrier for transmission to the 
buyer. And it may well be that commercial practice would, in many other circumstances, 
rebut the prima facie presumption that the person in possession should insure.
At all events, the concept of ‘risk’ is concerned only with accidental destruction or 
deterioration and does not cover damage to the goods caused by the fault of either party. 
Section 20, therefore, has the following further provisions:
(2)	 But where delivery has been delayed through the fault of either buyer or seller the goods 
are at the risk of the party at fault as regards any loss which might not have occurred but 
for such fault.
(3)	 Nothing in this section affects the duties or liabilities of either seller or buyer as a bailee . . .  
of the goods of the other party.
Subsection (2) was applied in Demby Hamilton & Co Ltd v Barden.31 Here the 
seller contracted to sell 30 tons of apple juice to be delivered to the buyer in weekly 
loads. The seller crushed the apples and put the juice in casks pending delivery. The 
buyer was late in taking delivery and some of the juice went bad. Applying s. 20(2), the 
learned judge held that the buyer was liable. But it is important to note that the party 
in fault is not liable for all risks, but only for those which ‘might not have occurred but 
for such fault’.32
Subsection (3) means that the mere fact that one party is in fault does not discharge 
the other from his obligations to take due care as a bailee. In particular, the fact that 
the buyer is late in taking delivery does not mean that the seller is not still bound to take 
29	 See s. 47 of the Law of Property Act 1925, and Maurice v Goldsborough Mort & Co Ltd [1939] AC 452, and 
cases there cited.
30	 The Uniform Commercial Code adopts this approach fairly consistently – see generally Art. 2, Part 5, and 
especially Art. 2-509, Comment 3.
31	 [1949] 1 All ER 435. See also Pommer v Mowat (1906) 14 SLT 373.
32	 It is, however, to be noted that there appears to be no justification in terms of insurance for this rule. 
Generally, the party in possession of the goods will have them insured, and it makes no difference that the 
delivery to a particular buyer is delayed. It appears to be a weakness of the Uniform Commercial Code that, 
having adopted a general principle of placing the risk of loss on the party in possession, it then permits 
breach to affect the risk of loss – see Art. 2-510.

all reasonable care of the goods.33 If he also is in fault, questions might arise as to the 
possibility of apportioning the damage between the parties, either by the application 
of the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945,34 or possibly, in some cases, 
on the basis of causation at common law.35 In Knight v Wilson,36 the seller of a boat, 
the property and risk in which had passed to the buyer, negligently caused damage to it 
while sailing it without permission, and was held liable to the buyer under the custodi-
an’s duty of care.
Special provisions in relation to non-consumer sales
Prior to the passing of the Consumer Rights Act 2015 and as a result of the Sale and Sup-
ply of Goods to Consumer Regulations 2002, a consumer buyer could rely on s. 20(4), 
which modified the position in s. 20(1) so that risk passed only upon delivery to the 
buyer and not with property or at some other time by reference to a contractual term. 
The provision is now amended so that the passing of risk, like the passing of property in 
consumer sales, is dealt with by the Consumer Rights Act 2015.
Frustration
It has already been suggested that the doctrine of frustration covers a wider field than 
the rules as to risk. The drafting of s. 7 supports this view:
Where there is an agreement to sell specific goods, and subsequently the goods, without any 
fault on the part of the seller or buyer, perish before the risk passes to the buyer, the agreement 
is thereby avoided.
The doctrine of risk simply lays down that prima facie if the goods perish before 
the property passes, the seller must bear the loss and cannot claim the price. Were the 
doctrine of frustration merely an aspect of the rules as to risk, this section would be an 
absurdity for it would, in effect, be saying that where the risk is on the seller he must 
bear the risk of the goods perishing. But s. 7 does more than this, for it provides that in 
the circumstances there mentioned the contract is avoided. This means that both parties 
are discharged from their obligations; in other words, not only is the buyer not liable for 
the price, but the seller is not liable for non-delivery.
33	 In the Tasmanian case of Sharp v Batt (1930) 25 Tas LR 33, 56, it was said that the buyer remained liable in 
the absence of gross negligence by the seller, but today it is unlikely that a court would require the negligence 
to be gross. The distinction between negligence and gross negligence, though it finds support in some early 
nineteenth-century English cases, has in any event no currency in modern law.
34	 See Forsikringsaktieselskapet Vesta v Butcher [1988] 2 All ER 43, in which the Court of Appeal clarified the 
circumstances in which the 1945 Act may be applicable to an action in contract. (The decision was affirmed 
on a different point: [1989] 1 All ER 402.) The Act has no application where the defendant is in breach of 
a strict contractual duty as under the Sale of Goods Act 1979 – Barclays Bank v Fairclough Buildings Ltd 
[1988] 2 All ER 43 – see Law Commission Report No. 219 (1993).

	286	 The effects of the contract
Application of s. 7
The scope of s. 7 is comparatively narrow. It only applies to a contract for the sale of 
specific goods in which neither the property nor the risk37 has passed but, as we have 
seen, the general presumption is that a contract for the sale of specific goods passes both 
the property and the risk at once. Section 7 therefore only applies where s. 18, Rule 1 
does not apply for some reason, or where, if it does apply, s. 20 does not apply. Section 7  
will prima facie apply wherever there is a case of a conditional sale of specific goods 
under s. 18, Rules 2 and 3.
The meaning of the word ‘perish’ in s. 7 is presumably the same as in s. 6 and the dis-
cussion there may be referred to.38 Destruction of part only of specific goods also raises 
similar questions in the two sections. If a person agrees to sell specific goods, part only 
of which perish before the risk passes to the buyer, does s. 7 operate to frustrate the con-
tract and discharge the seller? Barrow Lane & Ballard Ltd v Phillip Phillips & Co Ltd39 
suggests that if the contract is unseverable, it is frustrated by the perishing of part of the 
goods, whereas if it is severable it is frustrated only as to the part which has perished. 
But this conclusion seems suspect in the light of H R & S Sainsbury v Street.40 This case, 
although not itself falling under s. 7, suggests that where part only of the goods perish, 
the seller may well be obliged to offer the remaining goods to the buyer. The buyer, how-
ever, may not be obliged to take them.
It is thought that the perishing of the goods cannot frustrate a contract otherwise 
than under s. 7. If the property and the risk have both passed, it surely cannot be said 
that the subsequent destruction of the goods can frustrate the contract. Frustration can-
not apply to a fully executed contract.41 Nor is it easy to see how the result can be dif-
ferent if the property has passed but the risk has not. If the property has passed, it can 
hardly be said that the object of the contract can be defeated by supervening events. 
There remains the possibility that the risk may have passed before the property, and the 
goods may have perished after the one and before the other. Here, again, it is submitted 
there cannot be frustration, for this would discharge the buyer’s obligation to pay the 
price, or enable him to recover it if already paid, and this would mean that the risk was 
on the seller and not the buyer.42
Whatever the true basis of the doctrine of frustration, it would appear that s. 7 is 
only a prima facie rule of construction and nothing more, so that it does not necessarily 
apply merely because the facts fall within its purview. Once again, there are at least 
three possible constructions similar to those which were discussed in connection with 
37	 Note that s. 7 only applies ‘where there is an agreement to sell specific goods’, not ‘where there is a sale’, etc., 
which shows that it has no application where property passes. See, e.g., Horn v Minister of Food [1948] 2 
All ER 1036.

42	 Horn v Minister of  Food, above, n. 37. Certainly, in c.i.f. contracts, where risk usually passes before 
property, the perishing of the goods after passing of risk does not frustrate the contract, even though there is 
then no property to pass.

	
	 	
Risk and frustration	 287
Couturier v Hastie43 and Howell v Coupland44 (and again, in commercial cases yet 
further constructions may be possible where part only of the goods perish):
1	 There may be an implied condition that if the goods perish the contract will be 
discharged and neither party will be liable, that is, the contract may be frustrated.
2	 The seller may contract that the goods will not perish, in which case the seller will not 
only have to bear the loss of the goods; that is, will be unable to claim the price, but 
he may also be liable for damages for non-delivery.
3	 The buyer may contract that he will take the consequences of the goods perishing, in 
which case he will have to pay the price whatever happens to the goods, and he may 
also be liable for damages.
Frustration of contract of sale at common law
Perishing of specific goods is the only instance of frustration provided for by the Act, 
but there is no doubt that at common law a contract for the sale of specific goods may 
be frustrated by any event which destroys the whole basis of the contract and radically 
alters the obligations of the parties, provided that the event occurs before the property 
and risk have passed to the buyer.45
The question remains whether a contract for the sale of unascertained goods can be 
frustrated by perishing of the goods or otherwise. The answer depends upon the type of 
unascertained goods in question. In the first place, it is probable that an agreement to 
sell purely generic goods cannot be frustrated by the destruction of the goods because a 
whole species of goods cannot perish – as the Latin maxim has it, genus numquam perit. 
A particular stock of the goods in question may perish, of course, but it is no concern of 
the buyer that the seller had a particular stock in mind which is accidentally destroyed 
after the making of the contract.
Suppose A has contracted to sell to B unascertained goods by description; for example, ‘a’ 
Bentley Mark VI (not ‘this’ Bentley Mark VI) and suppose, further, that the seller expects to 
acquire the goods from a particular source, which may, indeed, be the only source available, the 
bare fact, without more, that when the time for delivery comes, that source has dried up and 
that the seller cannot draw on it, does not absolve the seller. He is still, in the absence of some 
contractual term excusing him, liable for non-delivery.46
It does not follow from this that a contract for the sale of unascertained goods of the 
other two types discussed above47 cannot be frustrated by the perishing of the goods. 
For example, if a person agrees to sell a crop to be grown on a particular field, the con-
tract may be frustrated by the failure of the crop,48 or, if a person agrees to construct

	288	 The effects of the contract
machinery in a building owned by another, and the whole building with the machinery is 
accidentally destroyed before it is completed, the contract may be frustrated.49
There also seems to be no reason why, in an appropriate case, a contract for the sale 
of any type of unascertained goods may not be frustrated by some event other than the 
perishing of the goods. It may, of course, be more difficult to persuade the court that 
the event which has occurred has destroyed the basis of the contract where the goods are 
unascertained and, indeed, in Blackburn Bobbin Co Ltd v Allen & Son,50 McCardie J 
went so far as to say:
In the absence of any question as to trading with the enemy, and in the absence also of any 
administrative intervention by the British Government authorities, a bare and unqualified 
contract for the sale of unascertained goods will not (unless most special facts compel an 
opposite implication) be dissolved by the operation of [the doctrine of frustration].51
But although this case was affirmed in the Court of Appeal,52 none of the Lords ­Justices 
was as cautious as McCardie J. On the contrary, they all treated the case as though the  
doctrine of frustration might have applied, but that it did not do so because the alleged 
­frustrating event only affected the way in which the seller was going to ­perform the contract. 
Such being the case, as Pickford LJ observed:
Why should a purchaser of goods, not specific goods, be deemed to concern himself with the way 
in which the seller is going to fulfil his contract by providing the goods he has agreed to sell?53
A striking instance of the application (in effect) of this principle is to be found in the 
Suez Canal cases,54 where the House of Lords held that the closure of the canal did not 
frustrate c.i.f. contracts for the sale of Sudanese groundnuts to European buyers, despite 
the fact that the only alternative route was via the Cape of Good Hope, several thousand 
miles longer. The decisive point may have been that these were contracts for the sale of 
goods c.i.f. in which the buyers were only concerned with the shipment of the goods 
at the port of shipment, and their ultimate arrival at their destination. Precisely how 
the sellers got the goods to the buyers was their own business. Conversely, the unload-
ing of the goods from the vessel at the port of destination in a c.i.f. contract is prima 
facie the sole responsibility of the buyer. If the goods cannot be so unloaded because 
the buyer has not obtained any necessary import licence, he will bear the loss.55 The ina-
bility to unload the vessel is not a frustrating circumstance because the buyer could (for 
instance) have diverted the ship to take delivery elsewhere. This is, anyhow, no concern 
of the seller. Similarly, the contract is not frustrated merely because the buyer is unable 
to export the goods for resale as he had intended.56

Risk and frustration	 289
But in Re Badische Co Ltd,57 Russell J held that a contract to supply unascertained 
goods which both parties knew could only be obtained from Germany was frustrated by 
the outbreak of war. He said:58
Speaking for myself, I can see no reason why, given the necessary circumstances to exist, the 
doctrine should not apply equally to the case of unascertained goods. It is, of course, obvious 
from the nature of the contract that the necessary circumstances can only very rarely arise in 
the case of unascertained goods. That they may arise appears to me to be undoubted.
More recently it has been affirmed that there is no legal principle excluding the 
doctrine of frustration in the case of a c.i.f. contract, though also confirming that the 
doctrine would only apply rarely in practice.59 In this case, a seller carrying on business 
in Malta agreed to sell potatoes c.i.f. London, shipment between 14 and 24 April. In fact, 
only one vessel called at Malta during this period and the seller was unable to obtain 
space on it. It was held that the seller took the risk of being unable to get shipping space 
and was liable.
Force majeure clauses
Although it is thus difficult to invoke the doctrine of frustration when restrictions are 
imposed by governments on the export or import of goods sold under c.i.f. and similar 
contracts, business contracts often include force majeure clauses (as they are known) to 
protect the parties against liabilities arising from such governmental activity, or other 
similar events. These clauses are usually very strictly interpreted by the courts against 
those relying on them so that liability is often imposed on the ground that, despite 
embargoes, prohibitions and the like, the party relying on the clause might still have 
been able to perform; for example, by buying goods afloat, by shipping earlier (or later) 
or by making more strenuous efforts to obtain a licence. What is particularly striking 
about the legal approach to these problems is that the liability in question is nearly 
always a liability for pure expectation, or loss of bargain, damages. There is surely a case 
for a less strict form of liability, where the claimant claims damages of this nature, even 
apart altogether from the presence of force majeure clauses. To interpret such clauses 
very narrowly where these are the only damages claimed suggests that the courts are 
imposing their own view of commercial morality (or economics) in the teeth of commer-
cial expectations.
A whole series of cases, which came before the courts in the second half of the 1970s 
and early 1980s out of one major commercial embargo, illustrates very well the extreme 
stringency with which such clauses are usually interpreted. These cases arose out of a 
disastrous failure of the soya bean crop in the United States in 1973, which led to an 
embargo being placed on the export of soya beans for a short period late in 1973. Many 
contracts for the sale of this crop, to the value of millions of pounds, were affected, and 
sellers relied on force majeure clauses in the standard contract used in that trade.60 But

	290	 The effects of the contract
in a whole series of decisions the Court of Appeal, and in one or two cases the House 
of Lords, approached the clause so strictly that the result was almost always to render 
the seller liable, despite the force majeure clause. Sometimes, the courts held that the 
burden of proof was on the sellers to show that they could not have found adequate 
supplies already afloat; sometimes it was held that sellers had failed to give notice, as 
required by the clause, at the right time; sometimes it was held that the sellers could have 
shipped before the embargo was imposed, or after it was lifted. The story was reviewed 
by the Court of Appeal in André et Cie v Tradax61 in which the judges acknowledged 
that the courts had perhaps been too legalistic in their approach, or at least that they 
had tended to look at the problems from a strictly legal, rather than a more realistic 
commercial, viewpoint. In particular, the courts had sometimes failed to appreciate the 
aggregate effects of the embargo as a whole, looking too closely at individual contracts 
to see whether (for instance) a particular seller might in theory have been able to buy the 
soya beans for his contract without regard to the fact that hundreds of other sellers were 
all at the same time desperately looking for any soya beans available for export. It is still 
unclear whether this case foreshadowed a greater willingness on the part of the courts 
to allow force majeure clauses to be invoked.62 Of course, as a matter of strict law, all 
depends on the proper construction and application of each clause in its own context, 
and it is beyond the scope of this work to attempt to look at typical clauses.
Effects of frustration63
In English law, the consequences of frustration of a contract for the sale of goods depend 
upon whether the Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act 194364 applies or not.
Cases to which the Frustrated Contracts Act does not apply
Section 2(5)(c) of the Frustrated Contracts Act excludes from its operation:
Any contract to which section 7 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1979 . . . applies, or [to] any other 
contract for the sale, or for the sale and delivery, of specific goods, where the contract is 
frustrated by reason of the fact that the goods have perished.
With regard to contracts to which s. 7 of the Sale of Goods Act applies this is clear 
enough, but the interpretation of the second part of this clause is a matter of some dif-
ficulty. As we have seen, it is probable that no contract for the sale of specific goods is 
frustrated ‘by reason of the fact that the goods have perished’ otherwise than in accord-
ance with s. 7. Yet if this is so, there is no room at all for the application of the second 
half of s. 2(5)(c) of the Frustrated Contracts Act. Moreover, even if, contrary to the 
above contention, a contract may be frustrated in such circumstances, it is still not easy 
to understand the object of this clause. Three cases may be considered.

Risk and frustration	 291
First, where there is a contract for the sale of specific goods in which the property and 
the risk have both passed to the buyer. Even if such a contract could be frustrated by the 
perishing of the goods, which seems highly improbable, the Frustrated Contracts Act 
does not apply. It may be that this was intended to avoid any possible doubt that in such 
an event the buyer is still liable to pay the whole price and cannot ask the court for any 
relief under the Act of 1943.
Secondly, where there is a contract for the sale of specific goods in which the property 
has not yet passed, but in which the risk has passed to the buyer. Once again, it seems 
inconceivable that such a contract could be frustrated at all because this would render 
meaningless the statement that the risk is on the buyer, but if such a contract can be 
frustrated the Act does not apply. The intention here may have been to avoid all difficulty 
in c.i.f. contracts should the goods perish after the risk has passed but before the bill of 
lading is transferred. In this event, the buyer is still bound to pay the whole price and 
cannot invoke the Act of 1943.
Thirdly, where the property has passed but the goods are still at the seller’s risk. If 
such a contract is frustrated by the perishing of the goods, which again seems unlikely, 
the Frustrated Contracts Act does not apply. Presumably, this is to avoid any doubt that 
the seller must bear the whole loss and cannot transfer any of it to the buyer.
In considering the cases to which the Frustrated Contracts Act does not apply, there-
fore, it may be permissible to concentrate on cases under s. 7 of the Sale of Goods Act, 
that is to say, where there is a sale65 of specific goods in which neither property nor risk 
has passed to the buyer and the contract is frustrated by the perishing of the goods. To 
such a case, the ordinary common law rules of frustration apply. The most important of 
these are as follows.
In the first place, both parties are discharged from all obligations not yet accrued 
before the destruction of the goods. In other words, the seller is not liable for non- 
delivery of the goods and the buyer is not liable for non-payment of the price.
Secondly, if the price, or any part of it, has been paid, it can be recovered if there is 
a total failure of consideration. This was the law even before the decision in the Fibrosa 
case66 because the rule in Chandler v Webster,67 which was overruled in that case, was 
never applied to contracts for the sale of goods.68 In the Fibrosa case, buyers paid £1,000 
in advance for some machinery to be manufactured by the sellers. The contract was 
frustrated before the machinery was completed and before any part of it was delivered, 
although the sellers claimed that they had already incurred considerable expense in per-
formance of the contract. The buyers were held entitled to recover their prepayment as 
on a total failure of consideration, and the sellers were not allowed to set off any of their 
expenses against the prepayment.
Today the Fibrosa case would be subject to the operation of the 1943 Act, but 
comparable cases may still arise where the common law rules continue to operate, so that 
if there is a total failure of consideration and the buyer can recover the price, the seller is 
65	 It must also be remembered that s. 7 only applies to contracts of sale of goods, so it does not apply to any 
contract for services, or to a contract for the supply of goods which is not strictly a sale.

	292	 The effects of the contract
not entitled to set off anything for expenses which he may have incurred before the frus-
trating event. For example, suppose that A agrees to buy some goods from B and pays the 
price, or part of it, in advance, but B is to do something to the goods to put them into a 
deliverable state. Suppose, further, that the goods are accidentally destroyed after B has 
done some of the work. This is a case to which s. 18, Rule 2 applies and, therefore, prima 
facie the property and the risk do not pass until the work is completed and the buyer has 
notice thereof. The case, therefore, falls within the clear wording of s. 7 of the Sale of 
Goods Act, and the Frustrated Contracts Act does not apply. The common law rule there-
fore enables the buyer to recover the whole amount which he has paid in advance, and the 
seller is not entitled to retain any of it on account of the expenses incurred. It is difficult 
to see why this should be so, for as a matter of justice there seems no material distinction 
between such a case and the Fibrosa case69 to which the Frustrated Contracts Act clearly 
would apply. Moreover, the arbitrary results of s. 2(5)(c) of the Frustrated Contracts Act 
are all the more apparent when it is remembered that s. 7 of the Sale of Goods Act only 
deals with frustration through perishing of the goods. If the contract is frustrated by some 
other event; for example, the outbreak of war or the like, s. 7 has no application and the 
Frustrated Contracts Act can be invoked. It is submitted that this is quite unjustifiable, and 
it is hard to see why s. 2(5)(c) of the Act of 1943 was thought necessary at all, especially as 
the workings of the Act are left to the discretion of the court.
The fourth rule at common law is that payments made under a contract which is sub-
sequently frustrated cannot be recovered if there is only a partial failure of consideration. 
Suppose, for example, A agrees to buy a specific parcel of 100 tonnes of wheat now in a 
warehouse, the price to be paid in advance, but the goods to remain the property of the 
seller, B, until delivery, and delivery to be by instalments of 10 tonnes each. One instalment 
is delivered, and the rest of the wheat is then accidentally destroyed by fire. Prima facie the 
risk remains with the seller until the property has passed, so that this is a case within s. 7 
of the Sale of Goods Act. The question whether the goods have perished within the mean-
ing of that section probably depends upon the construction of the contract. Prima facie it 
would appear that the destruction of the undelivered part of the goods avoids the whole 
contract. To this case, the Frustrated Contracts Act does not apply and the position at 
common law remains. These common law rules, however, are by no means easy to apply to 
a case of this kind. At first sight, it might be thought that nothing can be recovered because 
there is only a partial failure of consideration, but in fact it is submitted that the buyer can 
recover the amount of the price which is to be attributed to the goods which have perished. 
The reason for this is that the risk in respect of those goods was on the seller when they 
perished. The same applies if the buyer has not paid the price in advance, so that the buyer 
should only be liable for a proportionate part of the price.
In these cases, therefore, the Frustrated Contracts Act is not needed and does not 
apply because the common law can achieve a satisfactory result through the rules as to 
risk. Yet, illogically, if the contract is frustrated by some event other than the perishing 
of the goods, the Frustrated Contracts Act does apply.
Finally, the usual common law rule, known as the ‘entire contracts rule’, is that if a 
contract is frustrated it is not possible to compel one party to pay for a benefit received 
69	 [1943] AC 32.

	
	 	
Risk and frustration	 293
where the contract was to perform one indivisible service, and nothing has been paid in 
advance. So if one party has partly (but not ‘substantially’)70 performed his contract and 
finds that he cannot complete it as a result of frustration, he is not entitled at common 
law to any part of the agreed price, even though some benefit has been received by the 
other party,71 and perhaps even if that benefit survives the frustrating event.
But although this is the general rule at common law, it can hardly be applied without 
qualification to contracts of sale of goods. Even if the party who has received the benefit 
before the frustrating event cannot be made to pay for that benefit under the contract, 
he may be liable in a restitutionary action, based upon his acceptance of the benefit 
and his refusal to disgorge it. So, for example, if part of the goods under a contract of 
sale have been delivered and then a frustrating event prevents the seller from delivering 
the remainder, the buyer may be liable in a restitutionary claim for the goods delivered, 
which is based at least in part on the benefit received, and his refusal to return the goods. 
Hitherto, it has been established law that this restitutionary claim is only available where 
a new promise is capable of being implied in fact.72 If, therefore, the buyer still has  
the goods in his possession when the contract is frustrated, no doubt such a new promise 
can be implied, but if he has already disposed of them it may be that he cannot be 
made liable to pay a proportionate part of the price for them.73 This seems a harsh and 
unreasonable result which is due to the fact that restitutionary remedies were originally 
based on the idea of an ‘implied’ contract or promise, and it is ripe for reconsideration in 
light of modern ideas about the basis of the law of restitution. Once again, the position 
is different under the Frustrated Contracts Act, though it is hard to see why sales of 
specific goods should be distinguished from sales of unascertained goods, or is it easy to 
see why the result should differ according to the nature of the frustrating event. Yet such 
is the effect of s. 2(5)(c) of the Frustrated Contracts Act 1943.
Cases to which the Frustrated Contracts Act does apply
The Frustrated Contracts Act applies inter alia to all contracts for the sale of unascer-
tained goods, and to contracts for the sale of specific goods which are frustrated by some 
event other than the perishing of the goods. The Act effects three main changes in the law.
First, it enables a person to recover any payments made under a contract which has 
since been frustrated even though there has only been a partial failure of consideration. 
This is the effect of s. 1(2) of the Frustrated Contracts Act:
All sums paid or payable to any party in pursuance of the contract before the time when the 
parties were so discharged . . . shall, in the case of sums so paid, be recoverable from him as 
money received by him for the use of the party by whom the sums were paid, and, in the case of 
sums so payable, cease to be so payable.
70	 As to substantial performance, see Adams and Brownsword (1990) 53 MLR 536 at 538.
71	 Cutter v Powell (1795) 6 TR 320; Appleby v Myers (1867) LR 2 CP 651.
72	 Sumpter v Hedges [1898] 1 QB 673.
73	 Section 30(1) (above, p. 135) probably has no application to such a case because it postulates circumstances 
in which the delivery of only part of the goods is a breach of contract, and in which the buyer may reject that 
part at once. The case put here is one in which the delivery of part of the goods is not a breach of contract, 
and the buyer cannot therefore reject them when delivered.

	294	 The effects of the contract
So, for example, if a person agrees to buy 1,000 tons of wheat, payment in advance 
and delivery by instalments and the contract is frustrated after only one instalment is 
delivered, this subsection applies. The seller is therefore bound to repay the price paid in 
advance even though there is no total failure of consideration.
The same result could be reached by applying s. 2(4) of the Act of 1943:
Where it appears to the court that a part of any contract to which this Act applies can properly 
be severed from the remainder of the contract, being a part wholly performed before the time 
of discharge, or so performed except for the payment in respect of that part of the contract 
of sums which are or can be ascertained under the contract, the court shall treat that part of 
the contract as if it were a separate contract and had not been frustrated and shall treat the 
foregoing section of this Act as only applicable to the remainder of that contract.
By severing the executed from the frustrated part of the contract, the court can in 
effect turn a partial failure of consideration in respect of the whole contract into a total 
failure of consideration in respect of the frustrated part, and in this way enable the payer 
to recover his payment.
The second main change made by the Act is to enable the seller to retain part or all of 
a sum which would otherwise be recoverable as on a total (or now, a partial) failure of 
consideration, if he has incurred expenses in or for the purpose of the performance of the 
contract. Thus s. 1(2) continues:
Provided that, if the party to whom the sums were so paid or payable incurred expenses before 
the time of discharge in, or for the purpose of, the performance of the contract, the court may, 
if it considers it just to do so having regard to all the circumstances of the case, allow him to 
retain or, as the case may be, recover the whole or any part of the sums so paid or payable, not 
being an amount in excess of the expenses so incurred.
Apart from imposing upper limits, the Act leaves the question of the amount of the set- 
off to the discretion of the court, and one possible consequence of this is that the seller 
will not be allowed to retain a sum equivalent to the whole of the expenses which he has 
incurred. The object of the Act was to avoid the injustices which followed at common 
law of throwing the whole loss on to one party or the other, and it is not likely that the 
Act merely contemplated shifting this loss from one party to the other. Probably, there-
fore, the court would, in a suitable case, divide the loss between the two parties and 
permit the seller to recover accordingly.
The third main change in the law effected by the Act is the creation of a special excep-
tion to the ‘entire contracts’ rule, commonly known as the rule in Cutter v Powell.74 This 
case laid down that, where there is a contract to perform a complete action and nothing 
is payable in advance, no part of the agreed amount can be recovered if the contract is 
not completely (or anyhow ‘substantially’) performed as a result of frustration or any 
other cause. The position is now regulated by s. 1(3) of the Frustrated Contracts Act:
Where any party to the contract has, by reason of anything done by any other party thereto in, 
or for the purpose of, the performance of the contract, obtained a valuable benefit (other than a 
payment of money to which the last foregoing subsection applies) before the time of discharge, 
74	 (1795) 6 TR 320 – but see n. 70 above as to the modification of the strict application of this rule in modern 
contexts.

	
	 	
Risk and frustration	 295
there shall be recoverable from him by the said other party such sum (if any), not exceeding the 
value of the said benefit to the party obtaining it, as the Court considers just, having regard to 
all the circumstances of the case . . .
Thus where only part of the goods has been delivered and the contract is then frustrated, 
we have seen that at common law the seller may be unable to recover anything if the circum-
stances are such that it is not possible to imply a new promise to pay. Where the Frustrated 
Contracts Act applies, however, s. 1(3) thus enables the court to compel the buyer to pay for 
the part which he has received, although it would not have been possible to imply the exist-
ence of a promise to pay at common law.
Many intricate questions, mostly turning on the application of s. 1(3) of the Act, 
were discussed by Robert Goff J (now Lord Goff) in BP Exploration Co (Libya) Ltd v 
Hunt.75 In his view, this subsection is properly to be regarded as the statutory creation of 
a restitutionary right for benefits rendered. In the application of s. 1(3), the learned judge 
held that the key question was the identification and measurement of the benefit rendered 
before the frustrating event. The value of the benefit is the upper limit of the amount which 
may be awarded but, subject to that, the amount to be awarded is that sum which the court 
finds to be just having regard to the circumstances mentioned in the Act. He also held that 
where goods are delivered and retained until the frustrating event, they must be valued for 
the purposes of the Act as at the date of the frustrating event. But if the goods have been 
disposed of by the defendant prior to the frustrating event, then they must be valued at the 
date of disposal and no allowance can be made for any benefits which the defendant may 
have had from the proceeds of sale; thus if many years elapse before the frustrating event, the 
defendant cannot be made to pay for the valuable benefits he may have received as a result of 
having in his hands the proceeds of sale during that time. Robert Goff J also expressed the 
view that no sum should be awarded for any benefit conferred if, as a result of the frustrating 
event, the benefit is in effect completely nullified. For example, if goods are delivered to a 
buyer which have some value, but a subsequent embargo is placed on all dealings with the 
goods (before the buyer has the chance to dispose of any of them) then, if this is indeed a 
frustrating event, the buyer will have been deprived by the frustration of the contract of the 
whole value of the goods. In this event, no compensation can be awarded to the seller under 
the Act. If this is right, the decision in Appleby v Myers76 would be no different under the 
Act, but the judge’s views on this were obiter and the point remains open.77
Despite the fact that the Frustrated Contracts Act was passed to mitigate the harsh-
ness of the common law rules, it still leaves a substantial area for their operation. The 
Act only alters the common law where something has been paid in advance or where one 
party has received a valuable benefit under the contract before the frustrating event (and, 
if Goff J is right, where that benefit survives the frustrating event). But in contracts for 
the sale of goods to be manufactured by the seller there is rarely any benefit obtained 
before the contract is fully executed, so the Frustrated Contracts Act does nothing unless 
there has been some prepayment. Suppose, for example, that A orders machinery from 
B, nothing to be paid until delivery. After B has incurred considerable expense in the 
75	 [1979] 1 WLR 783; affirmed briefly by the CA [1981] 1 WLR 236, and (on one point only) by the HL [1982]

	296	 The effects of the contract
construction of the machinery, the contract is frustrated by the outbreak of war or the 
like. Although this is not a case within s. 7 of the Sale of Goods Act and the Frustrated 
Contracts Act could apply, it provides no remedy to the seller. Yet surely his position 
is no less meritorious because he has not insisted on being paid in advance. The same 
result follows where there is a payment in advance, but the seller has incurred expense in 
excess of this amount.78 If, for example, in the Fibrosa case79 the sellers had spent well 
over £1,000 on the machinery before the frustrating event they would not, even under 
the Frustrated Contracts Act, have been able to recover anything from the buyers over 
and above the amount of the advance payment. Here again, therefore, the seller’s rights 
depend on the purely fortuitous question of how much has been paid in advance.80
It seems, therefore, that although the Frustrated Contracts Act is a useful measure 
of reform, it still leaves much to be desired. In particular, it is submitted that s. 2(5)(c) 
could safely be repealed, and provision should be made for the case where the seller has 
incurred expenditure before the frustrating event, but where nothing has been paid in 
advance, and where the buyer has had no valuable benefit.
It is, however, possible that the whole question is a somewhat academic one. The 
strangest aspect of the law relating to the Frustrated Contracts Act is that there is still 
only one reported case in which it has been applied. The reason for this is not entirely 
clear, but it is possible that businessmen are less attracted than lawyers by the justice of 
dividing a loss between the contracting parties.
Scots Law
In Scots law, the consequences of frustration fall to be dealt with under the common law 
of unjustified enrichment. In Cantiere San Rocco SA v Clyde Shipbuilding & Engineering 
Co,81 Austrian purchasers of marine engines to be supplied by a Scottish company had 
paid the first instalment of the price before the contract was frustrated when the out-
break of the First World War made the purchasers enemy aliens. No engines were ever 
delivered. After the conclusion of the war, the purchasers claimed restitution under the 
condictio causa data causa non secuta, and eventually succeeded in the House of Lords. 
The availability of enrichment remedies of this kind has so far provided a satisfactory 
solution to the problems of post-frustration adjustment, although whether it can deal 
well with all cases remains unclear.82 The Supreme Court has held that there is no com-
mon law doctrine of ‘equitable adjustment’ of contracts in Scotland.83
78	 Unless the seller has incurred expenses at least twice as great as the prepayment the problem may not arise 
because, as has been suggested, the court would probably divide the loss and not permit the seller to throw 
the whole of it onto the buyer.

Transfer of title by a non-owner
Nemo dat quod non habet1
The second half of Part III of the Act is entitled ‘Transfer of Title’ and deals with those 
cases in which a seller with no right to the goods may nonetheless pass a good title to 
a third party.2 In most of these cases, the question that arises is which of two innocent 
people is to suffer for the fraud of a third. A thief steals goods and sells them to someone 
who buys in good faith and for value; a person hands goods to an agent to obtain offers 
and the agent sells them without authority and disposes of the proceeds; a swindler buys 
goods, induces the seller to let him have them on credit and promptly resells or pledges 
them for whatever he can get; a person sells goods but retains possession of them and 
fraudulently resells them to a third party. In all these cases, the law has to choose between  
rigorously upholding the rights of the owner to his property, on the one hand, and pro-
tecting the interests of the purchaser who buys in good faith and for value on the other 
hand. As Lord Denning once put it:
In the development of our law, two principles have striven for mastery. The first is for the 
protection of property: no one can give a better title than he himself possesses. The second is 
for the protection of commercial transactions: the person who takes in good faith and for value 
without notice should get a better title. The first principle has held sway for a long time, but it 
has been modified by the common law itself and by statute so as to meet the needs of our times.3
The first of these principles is of course still the general rule, and is affirmed by the 
Act in s. 21(1):
Subject to this Act, where goods are sold by a person who is not their owner, and who does not 
sell them under the authority or with the consent of the owner, the buyer acquires no better 
title to the goods than the seller had, unless the owner of the goods is by his conduct precluded 
from denying the seller’s authority to sell.
This rule is frequently dignified by the use of Latin in the tag nemo dat quod non habet, 
or more shortly nemo dat. Some difficulty has arisen with the words ‘where goods are 
sold’ in this section, and it has been held that this does not encompass a mere agreement

commonest problems.

to sell.4 But this is a somewhat confusing decision: the first part of s. 21(1) – the negative 
part stating that a non-owner cannot pass title – is merely a re-enactment of the com-
mon law principle so it would seem that part of the subsection, or the common law in 
lieu, is applicable whether there is a sale or a mere agreement to sell. The second part 
of the subsection (beginning with the word ‘unless’) has the positive effect of enabling 
a non-owner to pass a good title, although this also appears to be merely a restatement 
of the common law doctrine of estoppel. The only substantive question, therefore, is 
whether a person who has merely agreed to buy the goods can rely upon the doctrine of 
estoppel. This point is discussed below.5
The consent of the owner
Where the goods are sold with the express authority of the owner, the ordinary rules of 
principal and agent apply and no special difficulty arises. But s. 21(1) also refers to the 
‘consent’ of the owner, and reference should also be made to s. 47(1):
Subject to this Act, the unpaid seller’s right of lien … or stoppage in transit is not affected by 
any sale, or other disposition of the goods which the buyer may have made, unless the seller has 
assented to it.
If, therefore, the buyer, not being in possession, resells the goods and the seller assents 
to such sale, the sub-buyer obtains a good title free from the first seller’s lien or right of 
stoppage in transit. The effect of such assent on the part of the seller is very similar to 
that of estoppel, but the difference seems to be that whereas estoppel can only operate 
if the assent is communicated to the sub-buyer, the seller may assent to the resale within 
the meaning of s. 47 even though he only communicates his assent to the buyer. But the 
mere fact that the seller has been informed of a resale and has not objected to it does not 
amount to an assent within s. 47.
In Mordaunt Bros v British Oil & Cake Mills Ltd,6 the defendants sold oil to X, who 
resold part of it to the plaintiffs and gave them delivery orders in respect of that part. The 
plaintiffs paid X for the oil and sent the delivery orders to the defendants, who accepted 
them without comment. The defendants delivered instalments of the oil direct to the plain-
tiffs as and when they were paid by X, but, on X’s falling into arrears with the payments, 
they refused to deliver any more. Pickford J held that the defendants had not assented 
to the resale within s. 47. ‘In my opinion’, he said,7 ‘the assent which affects the unpaid 
seller’s right of lien must be such an assent as in the circumstances shews that the seller 
intends to renounce his rights against the goods. It is not enough to shew that the fact of 
a sub-contract has been brought to his notice and that he has assented to it merely in the 
sense of acknowledging receipt of the information.’8

acceptance might have been an attornment which would have passed property, but no property can pass in 
unascertained goods. Cf. Laurie & Morewood v John Dudin & Sons [1926] 1 KB 223.

	
	 	
Transfer of title by a non-owner	 299
On the other hand, in D F Mount Ltd v Jay & Jay Co Ltd9 Salmon J came to a dif-
ferent conclusion on the following facts. The defendants were owners of 500 cartons of 
tinned peaches lying at the wharf of D. The defendants were approached by M at a time 
when the market was falling, and M told them that he had a customer for 250 cartons. 
He made it clear that he, M, would pay the defendants out of the price he obtained 
from the sub-purchaser. The defendants agreed to sell the cartons to M and gave him a 
delivery order. M sent the order to D, who received it without acknowledgment. Later M 
sold the cartons to the plaintiffs, who paid M. The defendants, never having received the 
price from M, subsequently claimed to be still entitled to the cartons. Salmon J held that 
the defendants had assented to the sale within the meaning of s. 47:
In the present case the defendants were anxious to get rid of the goods on a falling market. 
They knew that M could only pay for them out of the money he obtained from his customers, 
and that he could only obtain the money from his customers against delivery orders in favour 
of those customers. In my view the true inference is that the defendants assented to M reselling 
the goods, in the sense that they intended to renounce their rights against the goods and to take 
the risk of M’s honesty.10
The maxim nemo dat has a wider application than s. 21 of the Sale of Goods Act 
because the latter only applies to a sale of goods by a non-owner, while the maxim also 
covers those cases where an owner sells goods, but is unable to sell them free from some 
encumbrance or charge existing in favour of a third party. In fact, this is an unusual sit-
uation because the law generally sets its face against the recognition of encumbrances 
which run with chattels into the hands of third parties11 and, of course, equitable rights 
are always subject to those of a purchaser for value in good faith without notice.12 But 
there is one not uncommon situation where the law does recognise such encumbrances 
as binding on third parties. Where a person pledges goods, or the documents of title to 
goods, and subsequently the pledgee returns the goods or the documents to the pledgor 
for a limited purpose; for example, to obtain clearance of the goods from the ware-
houseman, any unauthorised disposition by the pledgor will not prejudice the rights 
of the pledgee.13 In other words, the seller, although owner of the goods, cannot sell 
them free from the pledgee’s right. It may be that, technically, this result depends upon 
the pledgee’s retention of possession, but since the courts are prepared to hold that the 
return of the custody of the goods or documents of title does not transfer possession 
back to the pledgor, this is not much consolation to the innocent third party. It might 
well be thought that the extension of the rule nemo dat to these cases is unjustifiable, for 
it seems extraordinary that an owner who is in actual possession of his goods with the

	300	 The effects of the contract
consent of the pledgee cannot transfer a good title free from the pledge to an innocent 
third party. The hardship on the third party who buys goods from the admitted owner in 
actual possession is so obvious as to need no stressing. At all events, there are two limita-
tions on the rule nemo dat in this connection.
In the first place, if the pledgee returns the goods to the pledgor with an unrestricted 
authority to sell them, an innocent buyer from the pledgor obtains a good title free from 
the pledge, even though the pledgor fraudulently absconds with the purchase money.14 
And in the second place, if the pledgor is a mercantile agent, the return of the goods to 
him by the pledgee will enable the third party to plead that the pledgor was in possession 
of them with the consent of the owner and consequently that he is protected by s. 2(1) of 
the Factors Act 1889.15
The exceptions to nemo dat
As the opening words of s. 21 indicate, there are a number of exceptions to the general 
rule nemo dat which are of considerable importance, though they do not, of course, 
abrogate the main rule itself, at any rate so far as the sale of goods is concerned. It is 
perhaps worth pointing out that the exceptions are all cumulative from the point of view 
of the party seeking protection against the original owner. He need only bring his case 
under one of the exceptions to obtain protection against the former owner. Failure to 
bring his case under this or that exception does not prevent him succeeding under a dif-
ferent exception. We proceed now to examine the exceptions.
Estoppel
The first exception is provided by the doctrine of estoppel, which is embodied, in this 
connection, in the concluding words of s. 21(1) itself, which may be repeated here:
… unless the owner of the goods is by his conduct precluded from denying the seller’s authority 
to sell.
This provision merely throws us back on the common law doctrine of estoppel, for it 
gives no indication when the owner is by his conduct precluded from denying the seller’s 
authority to sell.16 It seems that there are two distinct cases where the owner is so pre-
cluded. The first is where he has by his words or conduct represented to the buyer that

16	 There had been suggestions (to which Shaw v Commissioner of Met Police [1987] 1 WLR 1332 appeared to give 
some countenance) that s. 21 actually operates independently of the doctrine of estoppel, and so perhaps the 
‘duty’ requirement of common law estoppel does not then apply. But this idea was rejected by the New South 
Wales Court of Appeal in Thomas Australia Wholesale Vehicle Trading Co Pty Ltd v Marac Finance Australia 
Ltd [1985] 3 NSWR 452, and (at p. 470) McHugh JA specifically endorsed the sentence set out above in the text, 
then appearing in the 4th edn of this work at p. 180. Note further the Scots law comments in Reid, The Law 
of Property in Scotland (1996, Butterworth/Law Society of Scotland), para. 680, emphasising that the Scottish 
doctrine of personal bar is not precisely analogous to estoppel and that care is therefore needed in handling 
the English authorities on this topic. There are no Scottish cases in point, however. See further Carey Miller, 
Corporeal Moveables in Scots Law 2nd edn (2005, W Green & Son Ltd, Edinburgh) para 10.20; Reid and Blackie, 
Personal Bar (2006, W Green & Son Ltd, Edinburgh) chapter 11(II).

the seller is the true owner, or has the owner’s authority to sell, and the second is where 
the owner, by his negligent failure to act, allows the seller to appear as the owner or as 
having the owner’s authority to sell. These are generally called estoppel by representa-
tion and estoppel by negligence respectively. The terminology of the subject is, however, 
somewhat confusing. On the one hand, estoppel by representation is sometimes sub-
divided into estoppel by words and estoppel by conduct, while the wording of the Act 
suggests that estoppel by words is merely a species of estoppel by conduct. But there is 
also much controversy about the propriety of the term ‘estoppel by negligence’. Strictly 
speaking, it seems there is no such thing as estoppel by negligence.17 All these estoppels 
rest in the last resort on a representation of some kind.18
A person may make a representation by words or by conduct, but how does a person make 
a representation by negligence? The answer appears to be that this is really a representation 
through an omission.19 A person who negligently omits to inform another of certain facts 
may be said to be representing that the facts calling for report do not exist. Again, a person 
who omits to correct a misrepresentation made by a third party may in certain circumstances 
be treated as responsible for that representation. Thus if A stands by while B makes a rep-
resentation to C which A knows to be incorrect, and which he has a duty to correct, A may 
be said, loosely, to be guilty of misrepresentation by negligence. In truth, what has happened 
is that A, by his negligence, has allowed B to mislead C by a misrepresentation. Thus, the 
correct approach is that this kind of estoppel rests in every case on a representation. The rep-
resentation may be (1) by words, or (2) by conduct, or (3) by a negligent omission.
Although the point is not free from doubt, it seems that in the first two cases it is 
unnecessary to show fraud or an intent to deceive or negligence as a foundation for the 
estoppel.20 The only requirements are those common to all estoppels, namely that the 
representation must be one of fact, that it must be unambiguous and that it must be 
acted upon. But although neither fraud nor negligence needs to be shown the representa-
tion must at least be voluntary, as that term is used in the law. A person who is induced 
by violence or duress to sign a piece of paper containing a representation in circum-
stances where the violence or duress would justify a plea of non est factum if the doc-
ument was a contractual document cannot be held to have made a representation, even 
where some third party has relied upon it.21
In the third type of case referred to above, however, it seems that negligence, in the 
sense of a breach of a duty of care (or, of course, fraud) must be proved. So where a 
person is charged with having omitted to correct a misleading statement by a third party, 
and that is the basis of the alleged estoppel, it must be shown that the defendant had 
some duty to correct the misstatement.

	302	 The effects of the contract
Estoppel by words
A good example of estoppel by words is the decision of the Court of Appeal in ­Henderson 
& Co v Williams.22 In this case, G & Co were induced by the fraud of one F to sell 
them goods lying in certain warehouses of which the defendants were ­warehousemen.  
The circumstances were such that the contract between G & Co and F was void for 
­mistake. On the instructions of G & Co, the defendants transferred the goods in their 
books to the order of F. F sold the goods to the plaintiffs who, being suspicious of 
the bona fides of the seller, made inquiries of the defendants. The latter supplied the 
­plaintiffs with a written statement that they held the goods to the order of F, and, when 
this did not satisfy them, they endorsed it with a further statement that they now held 
the goods to the plaintiffs’ order. G & Co, not having been paid by F, instructed the 
defendants not to deliver the goods to the plaintiffs but to themselves, and they gave 
them an indemnity against so doing. It was held that both G & Co and the defendants 
were estopped from denying the plaintiffs’ right to the goods, the former because they 
had represented that F was the owner by ordering the defendants to transfer the goods 
into his name in their books, and the latter because they had attorned to the plaintiffs, 
that is represented to them, that they held the goods to their order.23
A more modern case of estoppel by words is Shaw v Commissioner of Metropolitan 
Police24 where the plaintiffs agreed to buy a car from one L who had obtained it from 
the true owner, together with a certificate signed by him saying that he had sold the 
car to L. In fact this was untrue, as the owner had not sold the car to L – he had merely 
authorised L to sell it on his behalf. L was a swindler who did not pay for the car, and 
when suspicions were aroused he disappeared, leaving the title to the car in doubt. The 
plaintiffs had the effrontery to claim that they had acquired title under s. 21 of the Act 
even though they had not paid the price to L or anyone else. The Court of Appeal denied 
the plaintiffs’ claim, though on the rather unsatisfactory ground (as noted above) that 
s. 21 did not apply where the buyer had merely agreed to buy the goods, but only where 
he had bought them. This is unconvincing, because if (as has been submitted) s. 21 is 
merely a statement of the common law principle of estoppel, it ought to protect anyone 
who has acted to his prejudice on the representation in question. It would therefore have 
been better to have held that the plaintiffs’ claim failed because they had not acted to 
their prejudice since they had not paid the price.25
22	 [1895] 1 QB 521.
23	 The position of the warehouseman in this sort of case is unenviable because if he had delivered the goods to 
the plaintiffs he would have been liable to G & Co for disobeying their instructions: Rogers v Lambert [1891] 
1 QB 318. His proper course is to take interpleader proceedings, under which he disclaims title himself, and 
leaves the court to sort out the claims of the other contending parties.
24	 [1987] 1 WLR 1332.
25	 A difficulty was caused by the fact that they had given a banker’s draft for the price, but this was never 
cashed, and the bank refunded the money, subject to an undertaking to indemnify them if the draft was later 
cashed in circumstances in which the bank was liable. It is probable that this was thought sufficient action 
in reliance to raise an estoppel, which may explain why the court was anxious to avoid placing its decision 
on estoppel. But the result could perhaps have been avoided by application of the principle in Société Italo-
Belge v Palm Oil & Vegetable Oils [1982] 1 All ER 19 (trifling acts of reliance do not justify estoppel when it 
would be inequitable).

	
	 	
Transfer of title by a non-owner	 303
Estoppel by conduct
An early leading case on estoppel by conduct is Farquharson Bros v King & Co Ltd.26 The 
plaintiffs here were timber merchants who owned timber housed with a dock company. 
The plaintiffs’ clerk had authority to send delivery orders to the dock company, and the 
latter were instructed to act on the clerk’s delivery orders, but the clerk had no authority 
to sell the timber himself. The clerk fraudulently transferred some of the timber to him-
self under an assumed name and gave the dock company instructions accordingly. He 
then sold the timber to the defendants under his assumed name and instructed the dock 
company to deliver the goods to their order. The plaintiffs, having discovered the clerk’s 
fraud, brought an action for conversion. The House of Lords held that the defence of 
estoppel failed because the defendants had not acted on any representation made by the 
plaintiffs concerning the authority of the clerk. Even the dock company would not have 
needed, or been able to plead, estoppel. As Lord Halsbury pointed out, they would not 
have been liable simply because they had done nothing more than obey their principal’s 
instructions. Despite the vigorous speeches of Lord Halsbury27 and Lord Macnaghten in 
this case, and the expressions of astonishment that the defence should ever have been set 
up, let alone accepted (as it was by the Court of Appeal), it is by no means easy to lay 
down what sort of conduct is sufficient to invoke the doctrine of estoppel.
One thing, at any rate, is clear, that merely allowing another person to have posses-
sion of goods which he does not own is not by itself enough to bring into operation 
the doctrine of estoppel. There are so many different circumstances in which an owner 
of goods may allow another to have possession of them that it cannot be claimed that 
such conduct amounts to an unambiguous representation that the party in possession is 
the owner or has the owner’s authority to sell. Although the Privy Council accepted a 
proposition of almost this width in Commonwealth Trust Ltd v Akotey,28 this case was 
virtually overruled by the Privy Council itself in Mercantile Bank of India Ltd v Central 
Bank of India Ltd.29 In this latter case, X pledged railway receipts, which in this case 
were documents of title,30 with the Central Bank in return for an advance. In accordance 
with the usual practice, the Bank then returned them to X to enable him to obtain clear-
ance of the goods, but X fraudulently pledged them with the Mercantile Bank in return 
for an advance from them. It was held that there was no estoppel because the possession 
of the railway receipts ‘no more conveyed a representation that the merchants (X) were 
entitled to dispose of the property than the actual possession of the goods themselves 
would have done’.31 If estoppel by conduct is to be invoked there must be some act which

	304	 The effects of the contract
positively misleads the third party beyond merely allowing a non-owner to have posses-
sion of the goods.32
In Central Newbury Car Auctions Ltd v Unity Finance Ltd,33 a swindler called on 
the plaintiffs and offered to buy a Morris car on hire-purchase terms, leaving with the 
plaintiffs in part-exchange a Hillman car which, as it transpired, was also let on hire-
purchase. The swindler signed hire-purchase forms whereby the Morris was to be sold to 
a finance company and then hired to him, and he was thereupon given the registration 
book and permitted to drive the Morris away. The finance company refused the hire-
purchase proposal and the car was later discovered in the possession of the defendants, 
who had bought it in good faith from an unknown person, who was presumed to be 
the swindler. The Court of Appeal (Denning LJ dissenting) held that there was no 
estoppel and that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover the car. The registration book 
(now, registration document) of a car is not a document of title,34 and in fact it contains 
a warning that the person in whose name the car is registered may or may not be the 
owner. Hence it was not possible to say that the plaintiffs had in any way represented the 
swindler to be the owner, or to have the owner’s authority to sell. The case for invoking 
estoppel was based entirely on the fact that the owner had entrusted possession of the 
goods to another party, and this (as we have seen) is normally insufficient to raise an 
estoppel. Nevertheless, the result in this kind of case is a serious anomaly, having regard 
to the fact that a private purchaser from a person in possession under a hire-purchase 
agreement is now protected by Part III of the Hire-Purchase Act 1964.35
On the other hand, in Eastern Distributors Ltd v Goldring36 where, in pursuance of a 
plan to deceive a finance company, one M signed and delivered forms to C which enabled 
C to represent that he had M’s authority to sell a car belonging to him, it was held by the 
Court of Appeal that M was estopped from setting up his title against the plaintiffs who 
had bought the car from C. It was also held that the estoppel in fact operated to pass a 
good title to the plaintiffs not only against M himself, but also against a buyer in good 
faith from M. It is, however, not entirely clear why the case was not disposed of on the 
simpler ground that C had M’s apparent authority to sell, although in fact he exceeded 
that authority.37
So also, if the owner of goods entrusts the possession of them to a dealer with author-
ity to sell, or to obtain offers or something of that kind, the owner would normally be 
estopped if the dealer sold without authority or in excess of his authority. But this form 
of estoppel is now of little practical importance because it has been largely overtaken 
by the statutory protection conferred on innocent purchasers by the Factors Act 1889.38
There is an important distinction between a representation (or conduct equivalent to 
a representation) that the seller has authority to sell the goods as agent, on the one hand, 
and a representation that the seller is himself the owner, on the other hand. Where the

Transfer of title by a non-owner	 305
true owner represents the seller to be the owner, or enables the seller to represent himself 
as owner, and knows that the seller will or may sell as an owner, it is immaterial that the 
seller sells outside the ordinary course of business unless this demonstrates lack of good 
faith on the buyer’s part. In Lloyds and Scottish Finance Ltd v Williamson,39 the plaintiff 
entrusted his car to a dealer and authorised him to sell at or above a certain price. The 
dealer sold the car above this price but the price was not paid in cash but set off against 
a debt owed by the dealer to a friend of the buyer. For this reason, the sale was outside 
the ordinary course of business but it was held that this was immaterial. Since the owner 
knew that the seller might very well sell as a principal and not as an agent and had 
authorised him to do so, it made no difference how he sold the goods.
But if the case is one of ostensible agency the position is different. For it is reason-
ably implicit that an agent is only authorised to sell in the ordinary course of business 
and if he does not do so there will be no estoppel. Ostensible agency may arise in one 
of two ways: it may arise where the owner authorises an agent to sell as agent only, or 
it may arise where the buyer knows that the agent is not himself the owner and acts on 
the assumption that he is an agent only. This latter possibility is illustrated by Motor 
Credits (Hire Finance) Ltd v Pacific Motor Auctions Pty Ltd.40 In this case M Ltd, who 
were dealers in vehicles, sold a number of vehicles to the plaintiffs under a ‘display 
agreement’ whereby M Ltd remained in possession of the cars for display in their show-
rooms. They were paid 90 per cent of the price and were authorised to sell the vehicles 
as agents for the plaintiffs. M Ltd got into financial difficulties and the plaintiffs revoked 
their authority to sell the vehicles, but M Ltd nevertheless sold a number of them to the 
defendants who were bona fide purchasers for value. The sale was outside the ordinary 
course of business, partly because it took place after business hours and partly because 
the defendants agreed to sell the cars back to M Ltd in certain events (in fact it is clear 
that the defendants really wanted the vehicles as security for pre-existing debts owed to 
them). The defendants knew all about the display plan agreement and could not there-
fore have supposed that M Ltd were owners, though they did suppose M Ltd to have 
authority to sell. On these facts, the Australian High Court held that the defendants were  
not protected; as this was a case of ostensible agency and not ostensible ownership the 
defendants would only have been protected if the sale had been in the ordinary course of 
business. This decision was reversed on appeal to the Privy Council,41 without consider-
ation of this point, on the ground that the defendants were protected by s. 24 of the Act. 
This aspect of the case is considered later.42
Estoppel by negligence
As we have already seen, estoppel by negligence may be established where the owner of 
goods has, by his negligence, allowed a third party to represent himself as owner or as 
having the owner’s authority to sell. But the application of the principle of estoppel by

42	 See below, p. 323.

	306	 The effects of the contract
negligence is severely restricted by the fact that, as in the law of tort, there can be no 
negligence unless there is a duty to take care. It is for this reason that:
If I lose a valuable dog and find it afterwards in the possession of a gentleman who bought it 
from somebody whom he believed to be the owner, it is no answer to me to say that he would 
never have been cheated into buying the dog if I had chained it up or put a collar on it, or kept 
it under proper control. If a person leaves a watch or a ring on a seat in the park or on a table 
at a cafe and it ultimately gets into the hands of a bona fide purchaser, it is no answer to the 
true owner to say that it was his carelessness and nothing else that enabled the finder to pass it 
off as his own.43
Since there is no duty of care on an owner of property to see that it does not get 
lost or stolen, it is comparatively rare to find a clear case of estoppel by negligence in 
this connection. The dictum of Ashurst J in Lickbarrow v Mason,44 which is frequently 
quoted in this connection by despairing counsel, that ‘wherever one of two innocent per-
sons must suffer by the acts of a third, he who has enabled such third person to occasion 
the loss must sustain it’, has been more qualified than any other case in the books and 
has been dissented from more often than it has been followed.45
The necessity for establishing a duty of care often precludes the operation of the 
doctrine of estoppel in those cases where an owner is induced to part with goods to a 
buyer under a contract void for ‘mistake’. In those cases, the owner can claim the goods 
even from a bona fide purchaser from the fraudulent buyer, and it is no defence to say 
that it was the owner’s negligence, however gross, which enabled the buyer to obtain 
the goods unless a duty to take care can be established.46 Similarly, just as entrusting 
goods to another has been held not to amount to a representation that he is the owner 
or has authority to sell, so also if that party represents himself to be the owner or to 
have authority to sell, the owner will not normally be defeated by the plea of estoppel 
by negligence. Once again, the reason given is that there is no duty of care on the owner 
of goods to protect the possible interests of third parties.47 On the other hand, estoppel 
by negligence was applied in Coventry Shepherd & Co v Great Eastern Rly Co,48 where 
the defendants negligently issued two delivery orders relating to the same load of goods. 
The person to whom they were issued was thereby able to represent to the plaintiffs (to 
whom he pledged the goods) that the goods were in fact available after they had already 
been disposed of.
A more modern case where a duty to take care was established, although on the facts 
it was held not to be broken, is Mercantile Credit Co Ltd v Hamblin49 in which the facts 
were these. The defendant wished to borrow some money on the security of her car. She

consulted a dealer who was apparently solvent and respectable and he gave her some 
hire-purchase forms to sign in blank. She signed the forms thinking they were some sort 
of mortgage transaction, but retained possession of her car throughout. The dealer told 
her that he would find out what sum he could arrange for her to raise and would let her 
know. He also gave her a blank cheque which she was to fill in for the agreed figure on 
the scheme being completed. In fact, the dealer completed the hire-purchase forms so 
as to constitute an offer by himself to sell the car to the plaintiffs, a finance company, 
and an offer by the defendant to take the car on hire-purchase terms from the plain-
tiffs. Without further reference to the defendant, he sent the forms to the plaintiffs who 
purported to accept both offers. The defendant repudiated the alleged agreement and 
it was held by the Court of Appeal that she was not bound by it because she had not in 
fact authorised the dealer to make any offer to the plaintiffs and was not estopped from 
denying that she had done so. Although the court held that the defendant did owe a duty 
of care sufficient to raise an estoppel, it was held that she had not in fact failed to take 
care. In the particular circumstances of the case, it was not unreasonable for her to have 
trusted the dealer.
The importance of the case lies in the fact that the court treated the existence and the 
nature of the duty to take care in such circumstances as the same as those which arise 
in the ordinary law of negligence. Thus, Pearson LJ found a ‘sufficient relationship or 
proximity’ between the defendant and the plaintiffs from the fact that the defendant 
intended that the documents which she signed should constitute an offer to contract 
subject to certain conditions being fulfilled, and that she had entrusted the documents 
to the dealer and was thereby arming him with ‘the means to make a contract ostensibly 
on her behalf’.50
On the other hand, a majority of the House of Lords arrived at a different conclusion 
in the important decision in Moorgate Mercantile Co Ltd v Twitchings.51 This case arose 
out of the activities of a body called HPI (Hire-Purchase Information).52 It was a private 
body which kept a register of vehicles which were the subject of hire-purchase agree-
ments, or which had been notified to have been stolen. Any finance company which let a 
vehicle on such an agreement could register the agreement with HPI, and any dealer who 
was offered a vehicle for purchase could easily find out from HPI whether the vehicle was 
registered with them. At the time when this case arose there was no express obligation 
on the plaintiff (the claimant) as a member of HPI to register agreements,53 although

51	 [1977] AC 890; followed in Cadogan Finance Ltd v Keith Lavery (1982) Com LR 248 (omission to notify 
registration authorities of finance interest in aircraft).
52	 In the early 1990s HPI was sold. It is now owned by Equifax, a credit referencing organisation. In 1997 
it was merged with the independent Mileage Verification Association and it provides information both to 
the motor industry and to consumers. Information about outstanding hire-purchase agreements is now 
provided by applying to Equifax or Experian credit reference agency. See p. 338.
53	 In the 7th and earlier editions of this book it was stated that HPI had altered its rules since the Moorgate 
Mercantile case so as to impose an obligation to register agreements on its members. This was an 
unfortunate error which was based on some remarks in the speeches in the House of Lords, where the judges 
were clearly labouring under the same mistake. What seems to have happened was that, at the time of the 
Moorgate Mercantile case, some members were under an obligation to register agreements, but not all, 
and in particular not the plainitiff in that case. Following the decision, the obligation to register was totally 
removed from the HPI rules so that members were no longer bound to register agreements. Professor Atiyah 
acknowledged in previous editions that he was obliged to HPI for correspondence on this subject.

	308	 The effects of the contract
in practice this was the whole purpose of membership, and the great majority did so. 
Dealers, in practice, relied on the information given by HPI as there was rarely any other 
means of discovering whether a vehicle was subject to a hire-purchase agreement. In the 
case in question, the plaintiffs had omitted to register a particular agreement and this 
was held to be careless on their part. The hirer under this agreement sold the vehicle to 
the defendants, who inquired from HPI if the agreement was registered and were told 
that it was not. The plaintiffs then sued the defendants for conversion and the defend-
ants argued that the plaintiffs were estopped from asserting their title.
The defendants’ plea was put in two alternative ways. First, they argued that there 
was estoppel by actual representation. This argument depended on the assumption that 
HPI gave the information as agents for the plaintiffs, but it failed in any event because 
the information which HPI gave the defendants was in fact (as the majority of the House 
of Lords held) true. HPI said the agreement was not registered; they did not say that 
there was no such agreement in existence.
The defendants’ second argument was more difficult. They argued that the plaintiffs 
were guilty of an omission (to register) and that this gave rise to an estoppel. It was 
accepted on all hands that the question to which this led was whether the plaintiffs were 
under a duty to the defendants to register the agreement, or, more strictly, a duty to take 
reasonable care to register. By a majority, it was held there was no such duty. Membership 
of HPI specifically did not impose a duty on the defendants to register agreements and 
the majority did not see where else such a duty could come from. In earlier editions of  
this book, it was suggested that the dissenting speeches of Lords Wilberforce and Salmon 
carried more conviction. As Lord Wilberforce pointed out, in practice everyone in the 
motor trade relied heavily on the registration of hire-purchase agreements with HPI, and 
it would not seem unreasonable to hold that a duty to register arose out of these facts. 
But today, it seems that the majority decision in a sense anticipated the current trend 
to restrict the growth of liability in negligence, and to reassert the view that tort duties 
are only to be imposed with great caution on parties who have expressly restricted their 
contractual obligations.54
Effect of estoppel
It should finally be added that if estoppel does operate it will do so whether the transac-
tion is a sale, pledge or other disposition, but that it will not bind anyone who does not 
claim under the person estopped. A person claiming under title paramount cannot be 
bound by an estoppel to which he was not privy.
It is not entirely clear whether the effect of estoppel is actually to pass a title good 
against the party estopped. On one view, estoppel is merely a rule of evidence which 
precludes a person from adducing certain evidence before a court – he is not permitted 
to deny statements which he has previously made where the doctrine operates. On this 
view, the ‘real’ legal position remains unaffected by estoppel. The former owner remains 
54	 So a fortiori it has been held there can be no duty on the part of a member of the public to warn the police 
that a car has been stolen (which information would also normally be passed on to and registered by HPI or 
now its successors – see p. 338): Debs v Sibec Developments Ltd [1990] RTR 91.

	
	 	
Transfer of title by a non-owner	 309
owner, but simply cannot claim the goods as against anyone entitled to the benefit of 
the estoppel.55 But in Eastern Distributors Ltd v Goldring,56 the Court of Appeal said 
that the effect of estoppel anyhow in some cases relating to the sale of goods is to pass 
a real title, and not merely a ‘metaphorical title by estoppel’, though precisely when this 
is the case remains obscure. Since then it has been asserted that estoppel anyhow cannot 
help transfer a title in cases where s. 16 prevents property passing because the goods are 
unascertained.57
Somewhat akin to the doctrine of estoppel in this connection are cases in which a per-
son who sells goods without title subsequently acquires the title; for example, by paying 
off the true owner. In such circumstances, it has been suggested58 that the seller’s sub-
sequent acquisition of title ‘goes to feed’ the defective title of the buyer and any person 
deriving title through the buyer. This concept has not, however, been fully worked out 
and may give rise to some interesting questions; for example, can a title be acquired and 
‘fed’ in goods which have already been consumed?59
Relationship between estoppel and other principles
It will be apparent that the doctrine of estoppel is closely connected with other legal 
principles. The ostensible authority of an agent to transfer the title of goods in excess of 
his actual authority is based on principles similar to, if not identical with, those in the 
doctrine of estoppel. It must be admitted that legal theory in these areas is in a state of 
some confusion and it is not always easy to understand the basis for a decision. Estop-
pel, in particular, sometimes appears to be invoked to justify decisions which can be 
explained more simply. For instance, in Snook v London West Riding Investments Ltd60 
the plaintiff was held estopped from denying the title of the defendant’s predecessors to 
a car, although he had intended to transfer the property to them.
The use of estoppel in such cases seems merely confusing. The whole purpose of the 
doctrine is to prevent the plaintiff from denying his real intentions when he has misled 
other parties as to those intentions. Where in fact his real intention was to transfer title it 
is surely unnecessary to invoke estoppel.
Sale by agent
This exception may be quickly disposed of.61 Section 21(1) says, inter alia, that if the 
goods are not sold with the authority or consent of the owner, the buyer acquires no 
title. But this section is subject to the provisions of the Act, and s. 62 preserves the rules 
55	 See, e.g., Simm v Anglo-American Telegraph Co (1879) 5 QBD 188, 206 per Brett LJ. The idea that estoppel 
is a mere rule of evidence is challenged in Atiyah, Essays on Contract (1986, OUP), pp. 306–12.

	310	 The effects of the contract
of common law regarding principal and agent. It follows that, according to the ordinary 
principles of common law, a sale within the usual or ‘ostensible’ authority of an agent, 
even though outside his actual authority, will bind the owner. It is not of course every 
agent who has a ‘usual’ authority. Unless the agent belongs to a certain class of agents 
who usually have a certain authority, it cannot be said that the agent has any ‘usual’ 
authority wider than his actual authority.62
It is not within the scope of this work to analyse in detail the circumstances in which 
an agent can pass a title to a third party where he acts beyond his actual authority. It 
seems, however, that in addition to cases in which the agent acts within his ‘usual’ or 
‘ostensible’ authority, there is an independent principle which, at least in some circum-
stances, enables an agent to pass a title beyond his actual authority. If, for example, an 
agent is authorised to sell at a certain price and sells below this price to a bona fide pur-
chaser, it seems that the purchaser gets a good title, irrespective of whether the agent has 
any usual or ostensible authority or, indeed, whether he is known to be an agent at all. 
In such circumstances, the courts draw a distinction not unlike that drawn in vicarious 
liability in the law of tort.63 If the agent has acted within the course of his employment 
as an agent, he binds the principal even though he exceeds his actual authority; if, on 
the other hand, he acts right outside the course of his employment, he does not bind 
his principal.64 Another view, however, is that this line of authorities is an anomaly and 
should not be extended.65 On this view, the third party will only be protected if the agent 
had apparent or usual authority beyond his actual authority. Of course, if the buyer is 
aware that the agent is exceeding his authority, no property will pass.66	
A person who is not the owner of goods but sells with the consent or authority of the 
owner may, of course, sell expressly as agent, in which case the only contract of sale is 
that created between the owner and the buyer; whether the agent is entitled to sue, or 
liable to be sued on such a contract depends on ordinary principles of agency. But it can 
also happen that the party actually arranging the sale sells as principal and not as agent, 
even though he is not the owner. For example, where goods are sold by S to B1 under a 
contract with a ‘retention of title clause’, which provides that property is to remain in  
S until payment in full, but permits B1 to resell the goods in the ordinary course of busi-
ness, then a resale by B1 to B2 may create a contract of sale between these two parties. 
B1 may thus be reselling with the consent of the owner S, but he sells as a principal, not 
as an agent. S will not be a party to the sale contract between B1 and B2.67

Transfer of title by a non-owner	 311
Section 2 of the Factors Act 1889
The next exception to the rule nemo dat is provided by s. 2 of the Factors Act 1889, 
which was extended to Scotland by the Factors (Scotland) Act 1890.68 Section 21(2) of 
the Sale of Goods Act runs:
Nothing in this Act affects—
(a)	 The provisions of the Factors Acts, or any enactment[69] enabling the apparent owner of 
goods to dispose of them as if he were their true owner.
At common law, the doctrine of estoppel (or usual or ostensible authority) would 
normally have protected a third party who bought goods from a dealer in the ordi-
nary course of business, where the goods had been entrusted to the dealer by the 
true owner.70 But the common law did not protect a person who lent money on the 
security of the goods, which is in legal terms a pledgee; the courts took the view 
that a ‘factor’ was acting outside the normal course of business if he pledged goods 
rather than resold them.71 This was a somewhat unreal approach when applied to 
the commercial agents of import merchants who regularly pledged imported goods 
(or documents of title) to banks or other financial institutions in order to provide 
finance pending the arrival and resale of the goods.72 Accordingly, Parliament took 
a hand and passed a series of Factors Acts, beginning in 1823 and culminating in 
the present Act of 1889. The Acts were partly declaratory of the common law and 
partly an extension of it,73 but the present Act specifically declares that it is not to be 
construed in derogation of the common law,74 and it now appears that there may be 
circumstances in which the common law is wider than the Act. Thus (as seen above), 
a sale by an agent outside the ordinary course of business is protected at common 
law if the true owner has authorised the agent to sell as an owner, and not merely as 
an agent.75
By a somewhat strange twist, the provisions of the Factors Act are now usually 
applied to situations quite different from those for which they were enacted. The typical 
Factors Act case envisaged by Parliament was that of the commercial agent who pledged 
or resold goods (or documents of title to goods) consigned by foreign merchants to Eng-
lish ports; the typical case to which the Act is applied today concerns a motor vehicle 
entrusted to a motor dealer for sale or to obtain offers.
68	 For analysis from a Scots law perspective, see Reid, The Law of Property in Scotland (1996, Butterworths/
Law Society of Scotland), para. 671.
69	 The words ‘any enactment’ were thought to refer to the reputed ownership clause of the Bankruptcy Act 
1914 (under which goods in the possession of a bankrupt in such circumstances that he was the reputed 
owner could pass to the trustee in bankruptcy); this clause disappeared with the Insolvency Act 1985.
70	 The leading case was Pickering v Busk (1812) 15 East 38, but there is no doubt that the principle itself was 
older than this.

	312	 The effects of the contract
Section 2(1) of the Factors Act is as follows:
Where a mercantile agent is, with the consent of the owner, in possession of goods or of the 
documents of title to goods, any sale, pledge, or other disposition of the goods, made by him 
when acting in the ordinary course of business of a mercantile agent, shall, subject to the 
provisions of this Act, be as valid as if he were expressly authorized by the owner of the goods 
to make the same; provided that the person taking under the disposition acts in good faith, and 
has not at the time of the disposition notice that the person making the disposition has not 
authority to make the same.
The meaning of this subsection requires the most careful consideration.
Mercantile agent
A mercantile agent is defined by the statutes as ‘a mercantile agent having in the cus-
tomary course of his business as such agent authority either to sell goods or to consign 
goods for the purpose of sale, or to buy goods, or to raise money on the security of 
goods’.76 Whether a person is a mercantile agent or has merely obtained goods on sale 
or return is sometimes a difficult question. In the ordinary way, it makes no difference to 
the result because a sale or other disposition by the party entrusted with the goods will 
be valid in either event. If the party entrusted with the goods is a mercantile agent, a sale 
by him will be validated by the Factors Act, while, if he is held to have the goods on sale 
or return, a sale by him will normally be treated, under s. 18, Rule 4, as an act ‘adopting 
the transaction’ which passes property to him and through him to the sub-buyer. But in 
some cases, it does make a difference whether the party with the goods is a mercantile 
agent or has the goods on sale or return, because it is possible to contract out of s. 18, 
Rule 4, while it is not possible to contract out of the provisions of s. 2 of the Factors Act 
1889.77
A person may be a mercantile agent although he is only acting for a single principal,78 
but he must be more than a mere servant or employee. A person who induces another to 
let him have goods on a representation that he knows a third party who will buy them is 
not, without more, a mercantile agent.79 But a person may be a mercantile agent without 
carrying on the business of being a mercantile agent.80 And as every business must have 
a beginning, a person may be held to be a mercantile agent in respect of the transaction 
in question even though he has never acted as one before.81 If the person who obtains 
the goods is not a mercantile agent at the time he obtains them, the fact that he becomes 
such later while the goods are still in his possession will not bring the case within the 
Factors Act82 unless, presumably, the owner later consents to his possession as mercantile 
agent. However, if the evidence shows that the alleged mercantile agent is buying and 
reselling goods rather than acting as an agent, then there is no mercantile agency.83

Transfer of title by a non-owner	 313
In possession of goods or of the documents of title to goods
The Act requires that the mercantile agent should be in possession of the goods or of 
the documents of title to the goods. It has been held that he must actually be in posses-
sion at the time of the sale, pledge or other disposition if the buyer is to be protected 
under the Factors Act. In Beverley Acceptances Ltd v Oakley,84 one O pledged two Rolls-
Royce cars to the defendant G for a large loan. The cars were parked in G’s locked com-
pound but O borrowed the keys of the compound telling G that it was a matter to do 
with insurance, but in reality to show the cars to the plaintiffs, who were contemplating 
advancing money on their security. The cars were duly returned to G. Some days later, 
the plaintiffs did advance money to G, and G executed a bill of sale in their favour which 
was duly registered. It was held that, even if G was to be taken to be the ‘owner’ of the 
cars85 and even if O was a mercantile agent, and even if O had been allowed temporary 
possession when he was lent the keys of the compound, still the buyer was not protected. 
The sale to the buyer had taken place at a time when any temporary possession obtained 
by O had long disappeared, and the section only applies where the mercantile agent ‘is in 
possession’, not where he once has been in possession.
The consent of the owner
The next requirement of the subsection is that the mercantile agent must be in posses-
sion of the goods with the consent of the owner. The meaning of these last words, which 
also appear in s. 25(1),86 gave rise at one time to considerable difficulty where a person 
was induced to part with goods as a result of fraud and, in particular, where he parted 
with the goods in circumstances amounting to larceny by a trick under the old law of 
theft. It was at one time thought that in such a case the goods could not be said to be 
in the possession of the agent with the consent of the owner,87 but it is probably safe to 
say that this view would not be accepted since the decision in Pearson v Rose & Young.88 
In this case, the plaintiff delivered his car to X, a mercantile agent, in order to obtain 
offers, but with no authority to sell it. The agent obtained possession of the registration 
book by a trick in such circumstances that the owner had clearly not consented to part-
ing with the possession of it, and then promptly sold the car, as he had intended to do 
from the first. The Court of Appeal held that the question whether the agent had com-
mitted larceny by a trick was quite immaterial and that in each case the only question 
was whether the goods were in his possession with the consent of the owner. In this case, 
the mercantile agent had possession of the car with the consent of the owner, but not 
of the registration book. The court further held that a sale without a registration book

	314	 The effects of the contract
would not have been a sale in the ordinary course of business and that the defendants 
were therefore not protected by the Factors Act.89
The dicta in Pearson v Rose & Young90 were applied by Sellers J in Du Jardin v Bead-
man,91 a case under s. 25(1) of the Sale of Goods Act, where the learned judge held that 
although the goods were obtained by larceny by a trick, they were nonetheless in the 
possession of the buyer with the consent of the seller. Since the coming into force of the 
Theft Act 1968, the offence of larceny by a trick has disappeared from English law, but 
there can be no doubt that these cases represent the modern law on the subject.
It has been suggested that a purchaser cannot rely on the owner’s consent to the mer-
cantile agent’s possession if that consent was given under an illegal contract.92 But this 
would produce the strange result that the owner of the goods could rely on his own ille-
gal agreement with the agent to defeat the claims of an innocent third party. Moreover, 
the suggestion bears some resemblance to cases prior to Pearson v Rose & Young which 
(as we saw above) gave an artificial meaning to the word ‘consent’ in s. 2 of the Factors 
Act. It is submitted that this suggestion is wrong.
Not only the requirement of consent, but also the word ‘owner’ has given rise to 
difficulty in this section. First, the ‘owner of the goods here referred to is the owner 
with whose consent the agent is in possession of them’.93 Clearly, the section does not 
adversely affect the title of any person except the person who has entrusted the goods 
or documents of title to the mercantile agent. It does not thus affect the title of a person 
whose goods have been stolen, and later come into the possession of a mercantile agent 
from the thief.
Another difficulty arose in Lloyds Bank v Bank of America,94 where the plaintiffs 
lent money to X, a mercantile agent, on the security of documents which were pledged 
with them. The documents were then returned to X under a ‘trust receipt’95 to enable 
him to sell the goods as trustee for the plaintiffs, but X fraudulently pledged them with 
the defendants for an advance. The defendants pleaded that they were protected by s. 2 
of the Factors Act 1889, but the plaintiffs argued that as X, the mercantile agent, was 
himself the owner of the goods, it could not be said that he was in possession with the 
consent of the owner within the meaning of the Act. The Court of Appeal rejected these 
arguments, however. In the words of Lord Greene MR:
Where the right of ownership has become divided among two or more persons in such a way 
that the acts which the section is contemplating could never be authorized save by both or all of 
them, these persons together constitute the owner.96

95	 A ‘trust receipt’ (now apparently usually called a ‘letter of trust’) is a document obtained by a bank or other

Transfer of title by a non-owner	 315
In this case, the plaintiffs were the legal pledgees and, in equity, beneficiaries of the 
proceeds of sale, while X was the legal and beneficial owner, subject to the prior claim 
of the plaintiffs. Consequently, these two persons together constituted the owner within 
the Act, and the goods were nonetheless in the possession of X with the consent of the 
owner, because he was himself one of those two persons.
Goods entrusted to the mercantile agent as such
The purchaser from the mercantile agent will not be protected if the goods were 
entrusted to him for some purpose quite unconnected with his business as a mercantile 
agent. As Lord Denning once said:
The owner must consent to the agent having them for a purpose which is in some way or other 
connected with his business as a mercantile agent. It may not actually be for sale. It may be 
for display, or to get offers, or merely to put in his showroom; but there must be a consent to 
something of that kind before the owner can be deprived of his goods.97
So if the owner does not even know that the bailee to whom he entrusts the goods carries 
on business as a mercantile agent, his consent to the bailee’s possession cannot suffice 
under the Act.98
Subsections (2), (3) and (4) of s. 2 of the Factors Act are also concerned with the 
meaning of the consent referred to in s. 2(1). Section 2(2) lays down that, if the agent 
obtains the goods with the consent of the owner, the subsequent withdrawal of the 
consent will not affect the rights of a purchaser who had no notice of the withdrawal. 
Section 2(3) provides that, if the agent is in possession of the goods with the consent of 
the owner and obtains possession of the documents of title by virtue of his possession 
of the goods, he shall be deemed to have such possession also with the consent of the 
owner. Finally s. 2(4) enacts that ‘For the purposes of this Act the consent of the owner 
shall be presumed in the absence of evidence to the contrary.’
Sale in ordinary course of business
The purchaser claiming the protection of s. 2 must next prove that the mercantile agent 
acted in the ordinary course of business. This cannot be read literally because, obviously, 
in one sense a sale without the authority of the owner can rarely, if ever, be in the ordi-
nary course of business, and it is only in this event that the Factors Act is needed at all. 
Consequently, this should probably be taken as meaning ‘appearing to act in the ordi-
nary course of business’.99 Alternatively, it may mean that the mercantile agent must act 
in the ordinary course of business except for the fact that he does not have the owner’s 
authority.
97	 Pearson v Rose & Young [1951] 1 KB 275, 288. There is a long line of authority supporting this viewpoint, 
dating back to Cole v North Western Bank (1875) LR 10 CP 354. It has also been held that the decision in 
the Pacific Motor Auctions case [1965] AC 867 (see p. 321) has not affected the law on this point: Astley 
Industrial Trust v Miller [1968] 2 All ER 36.

99	 See (1951) 67 LQR 6. Cf. Oppenheimer v Attenborough & Sons [1908] 1 KB 221.

	316	 The effects of the contract
It is immaterial that the third party dealt with the mercantile agent as a principal and 
did not know him to be an agent; and it is also immaterial that the agent entered into 
a transaction not normally sanctioned by the custom of the trade unless, perhaps, the 
custom is so notorious that the third party would normally be taken to have knowledge 
of it as, for example, if an auctioneer were to pledge goods entrusted to him for sale. In 
other words, the phrase ‘acting in the ordinary course of business of a mercantile agent’ 
means ‘acting in such a way as a mercantile agent in the ordinary course of business as 
a mercantile agent would act, that is to say, within business hours, at a proper place of 
business, and in other respects in the ordinary way in which a mercantile agent would 
act, so that there is nothing to lead the pledgee to suppose that anything is done wrong, 
or to give notice that the disposition is one which the mercantile agent had not authority 
for’.100 So also, if a mercantile agent sells goods on the terms that the price is not to be 
paid directly to him but to one of his creditors, this may well be outside the ordinary 
course of business.101 But a sale is not necessarily outside the ordinary course of business 
because the price is not paid in cash.102 Whether the mercantile agent has acted in the 
ordinary way in which a mercantile agent would act in any particular case is a question 
of fact.103
It seems that the requirement that the agent must act in the ordinary course of busi-
ness is distinct from the requirement that the buyer must take in good faith and with-
out notice.104 A buyer may be in good faith even though the sale is outside the ordinary 
course of business. To this extent the dictum above, from Buckley LJ’s judgment in 
Oppenheimer v Attenborough & Sons, must be modified. For if the agent is only held to 
act outside the ordinary course of business in circumstances in which the buyer would 
have notice of his lack of authority, it would seem that the buyer would necessarily fail 
on the second requirement in any event.105
These decisions give rise to the question whether the requirement that the agent must 
act in the ordinary course of business serves any useful purpose. It would seem that the 
owner is already adequately protected by the requirement that the buyer must act in 
good faith and without notice, and this additional requirement could well be dropped 
in any future reform of the law.106 Indeed, in Summers v Harvad,107 the Court of Appeal, 
presented with an appeal dealing with both requirements, only considered the good faith 
and notice requirement, which was sufficient to dispose of the appeal.

105	 In both the cases cited in the last note sales were made outside the ordinary course of business, but the

106	 The UCC retains the requirement that the sale must be in the ordinary course of business on the ground 
that purchasers (in the USA) were frequently held to be in good faith in cases where this result outraged 
common sense. See the Commentary to Art. 2-403(2). But this is of course the result of jury trial and is no 
longer relevant here where commercial cases are hardly ever tried by jury today.

Transfer of title by a non-owner	 317
Sale, pledge or other disposition
What sort of transaction amounts to a ‘disposition’ has been dealt with by the courts in 
relation to s. 24 of the Sale of Goods Act, so the point is discussed in connection with 
that section.108
Good faith and notice
The next requirement of s. 2 is that the buyer must prove that he took in good faith and 
without notice that the sale was made without the owner’s authority, and the burden of 
proof is apparently on him in this respect,109 although under s. 23 lack of good faith must 
be proved by the original owner.110 In Summers v Harvad,111 two used car dealers had 
supplied another dealer with cars for resale, with an agreement to share profits. That 
dealer was in financial difficulties, and Harvard removed all the cars which he thought 
were his and some others to his premises. Summers was asked to identify which of those 
cars were his, but Harvard then contended that these had been bought in good faith. 
However, the judge concluded that Harvard was not acting in good faith and had notice 
of the fact that some of the cars would belong to other suppliers, and therefore Summers 
was entitled to receive a sum constituting the value of the cars belonging to him.
Pledges
Although a pledge is included within the protection of this section, s. 4 of the same Act 
excludes a pledge made for an antecedent debt. Thus if a mercantile agent pledges goods 
in his possession with the consent of the owner, the pledgee will have to prove that the 
pledge was made in return for a loan given at the same time, and not before the pledge 
was made.
Special powers of sale
Section 21(2) says that:
Nothing in this Act affects—
(b)  the validity of any contract of sale under any special common law or statutory power of 
sale, or under the order of a court of competent jurisdiction.
This provision covers a large number of miscellaneous cases where a non-owner may 
pass a good title to goods, some of which are considered below.112

	318	 The effects of the contract
Common law powers
The most important of these is the power of sale of a pledgee, but if the pledge is made 
under a ‘regulated agreement’, that is, it is taken by a provider of credit from a con-
sumer, the power must be exercised under the Consumer Credit Act 1974 (see below).
Statutory powers
There are a large number of these. The most important include: the power of a law 
enforcement offices to sell goods seized under a writ of execution;113 the power of an 
innkeeper to sell goods upon which he has a lien under s. 1 of the Innkeepers Act 1878; 
the powers conferred by the Torts (Interference with Goods) Act 1977; and the powers 
relating to pawns under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Under s. 120 of this Act, a pawn 
for under £75 can be forfeited at the end of the redemption period, but a pawn for a sum 
exceeding £75 can only be realised in accordance with the procedures laid down in s. 
121.114
The only one of these provisions calling for any further comment is the Torts (Inter-
ference with Goods) Act 1977. Section 12 of the Act confers power on a bailee to sell 
goods after due notice given in various circumstances specified in the Act. If the bailee is 
unable to trace the bailor, he may still be able to sell the goods subject to the conditions 
laid down in the Act. A sale under this Act gives a good title to the purchaser as against 
the bailor, but not against the true owner if the bailor had no authority to bail them.
Sale by order of the court
The court has a wide jurisdiction under the Civil Procedure Rules 1998 to order the 
sale of goods which ‘for any just and sufficient reason it may be desirable to have sold 
at once’; for example, because they are of a perishable nature, or because the market is 
falling. The court has power to insist on a sale despite the objections of the owner, where 
such a course seems necessary or desirable.115
Sale in market overt
The fifth exception to the nemo dat rule in England and Wales was the case of a sale in 
market overt (another concept unknown in Scots law). Section 22 of the Act provided:
(1)	 Where goods are sold in market overt, according to the usage of the market, the buyer 
acquires a good title to the goods, provided he buys them in good faith and without notice 
of any defect or want of title on the part of the seller.
113	 Sec Atkins Court Forms 2nd ed Vol 19(1A) [176 et seq]. The buyer acquires a good title even if the goods 
did not belong to the person against whom execution issues, and even if he knew of the rights of the true 
owner: Curtis v Maloney [1951] 1 KB 736; Dyal Singh v Kenyan Insurance Ltd [1954] 1 All ER 847.
114	 The figure of £75 was substituted for £25 by the Consumer Credit (Further Increase in Monetary Limits) 
Order 1998.
115	 Larner v Fawcett [1950] 2 All ER 727.

	
	 	
Transfer of title by a non-owner	 319
This exception could be explained, but scarcely justified, on historical grounds only, and 
it may be regretted that it was included in the 1893 codification. Reform of the rule was 
proposed as long ago as 1966, but not acted upon.116
In January 1994, the government produced a Consultation Paper117 which recom-
mended the abolition of the rule, replacing it with a rule which would confer a good 
title on bona fide purchasers through retail outlets or auctions. The Sale of Goods 
(Amendment) Act 1994, however, abolished the rule with effect from 3 January 1995. 
Accordingly, a good faith purchaser will no longer get a good title even in the limited 
circumstances provided by the market overt rule.
Sale under a voidable title
Section 23 confirms the common law rule that a person cannot avoid a voidable contract 
to the prejudice of third-party rights acquired in good faith and for value:
When the seller of goods has a voidable title to them, but his title has not been avoided at the 
time of the sale, the buyer acquires a good title to the goods, provided he buys them in good 
faith and without notice of the seller’s defect of title.
The great practical importance of this rule is that, if a person buys goods by fraud118 
and disposes of them before the other party avoids the contract, a buyer in good faith119 
from the fraudulent party acquires a good title. Where, however, the fraud is such as to 
nullify the offer or acceptance (or where there is a fundamental mistake) so that no real 
contract comes into existence, the buyer acquires no title at all and cannot therefore pass 
anything on to the innocent third party.120 Consequently, this section does not protect 
such a buyer and unless he can invoke one of the other exceptions to the nemo dat rule, 
such as estoppel or s. 2 of the Factors Act 1889, he will have no defence to an action of 
conversion by the owner.
In general, the defrauded party can only rescind the contract by communicating with 
the other party to the contract and notifying him of the rescission. But in Car & Universal 
Finance Ltd v Caldwell,121 the Court of Appeal held that the seller can rescind the con-
tract by evincing an intention to do so and taking all steps open to him (such as informing 
the police) where he is unable to communicate with the fraudulent party, at least where 
this is because the fraudulent party is deliberately keeping out of the way. The court left 
open the question whether the law would be the same where the innocent party’s ina-
bility to communicate with the other is not due to the fact that the latter is deliberately 
keeping out of the way. At first it seemed that this decision had fundamentally affected

	320	 The effects of the contract
the protection afforded to the innocent third party by the Act because it had previously 
been assumed that a contract could not be rescinded without communication. Where the 
­contract is fraudulently induced, it was generally thought that in practice there was little 
that the innocent party could do to defeat a bona fide purchaser. This view of the law was,  
moreover, adopted in Scotland in MacLeod v Kerr,122 which was decided in the same year as 
Caldwell’s case. The facts in this case were substantially identical with those in Caldwell’s 
case and the Court of Session held that ‘by no stretch of imagination’ could the seller’s 
conduct amount to rescission of the contract. However, as will be seen later, it is now clear 
that the decision in Caldwell’s case will be of limited application in ­practice because in 
circumstances to which it applies the third party will often get a good title under s. 25(1) 
of the Act.123
Although s. 23 only refers to the possibility of a sale, the common law rule is the same 
and presumably still applies to pledges, so a person with a voidable title to goods who 
pledges them before the other party avoids the title can pass a good title to the pledgee.124 
But a trustee in bankruptcy takes no better title than the bankrupt had, and if the bank-
rupt had a voidable title the seller can still avoid that title and retake the goods even after 
they have vested in the trustee.125
Seller in possession
The last two exceptions to the nemo dat rule are contained in ss. 8 and 9 of the Factors 
Act 1889 (extended to Scotland by the Factors (Scotland) Act 1890),126 which are repro-
duced with the omission, in each case, of a few words in s. 24 and s. 25(1) of the Sale of 
Goods Act, though the sections of the earlier Act were not repealed. Because the sections 
of the Factors Act are wider than those of the Sale of Goods Act, the discussion here 
will be in terms of the former. Section 8 of the Factors Act is as follows:
Where a person, having sold goods, continues, or is, in possession of the goods or of the 
documents of title to the goods, the delivery or transfer by that person, or by a mercantile agent 
acting for him, of the goods or documents of title under any sale, pledge or other disposition 
thereof [or under any agreement for sale, pledge or other disposition thereof], to any person 
receiving the same in good faith and without notice of the previous sale, shall have the same 
effect as if the person making the delivery or transfer were expressly authorised by the owner of 
the goods to make the same.
The words placed in square brackets in the text are the words omitted in s. 24 of the Sale 
of Goods Act.127

127	 The omitted words in ss. 24 and 25 are one of the oddities of the Sale of Goods Act. If Parliament thought 
that ss. 8 and 9 of the Factors Act were too wide, why did it not repeal them; and if it did not think they 
were too wide, why did it leave out these words?

	
	 	
Transfer of title by a non-owner	 321
‘A person, having sold goods, continues, or is, in possession’
There was for some years a continuous stream of authority holding that it was not 
enough that the seller was simply in possession of the goods when he resold them, but 
that the third party claiming under this section must go further and show that the seller 
was in possession as seller, and not in some other capacity; for example, as bailee.128
However, the authority of these decisions was severely shaken by the decision of the 
Privy Council in Pacific Motor Auctions Pty Ltd v Motor Credits (Hire Finance) Ltd,129 
the facts of which have already been given.130 The Privy Council held that the defend-
ants obtained a good title under a section of the New South Wales Sale of Goods Act 
identical with s. 24 of the 1979 Act. In delivering the opinion of the Board, Lord Pearce 
rejected the earlier English decisions as wrongly decided. The Privy Council held that 
the words ‘continues … in possession’ in the section were intended to refer to the con-
tinuity of physical possession, regardless of any private transaction between the seller 
and the first buyer which might alter the legal title under which the possession was held. 
Accordingly, unless there is an actual transfer of physical possession, the seller is to be 
treated as continuing in possession and as able to pass a good title under the section.131 
The Privy Council approved the New Zealand case of Mitchell v Jones,132 where the 
seller sold and delivered a horse to the buyer, but later borrowed it back and wrongfully 
sold it again. In such a case the second buyer is not protected; the seller is ‘in possession’ 
in a literal sense, but the fact that he was a seller originally is no longer relevant. He is a 
bailee, not a seller.133
This decision was later followed by the Court of Appeal134 and was much to be wel-
comed. It rid the law of an unnecessary complication for it replaced the previous impre-
cise criteria for determining whether a seller was in possession ‘as seller’ by the simpler 
criterion of whether he remained in physical possession throughout. It is also thought 
that the result is more equitable than that reached in the earlier cases since, if a buyer 
chooses to leave the seller in possession, the risk of the seller proving dishonest should 
rest on him rather than on a bona fide purchaser.
In the application of this provision, it must be borne in mind that there is nothing in 
the section to alter the usual commercial meaning of the word possession. Consequently, 
it has been held that goods which were at the seller’s disposal though physically in the 
custody of warehousemen were in the possession of the seller within s. 8 of the Factors 
Act.135

130	 See above, p. 305.
131	 Prima facie a dealer in possession under such an agreement would be able to pass a title under s. 2 of the 
Factors Act. (See, e.g., the CA decision in St Margaret’s Trust Ltd v Castle, 28 July 1964 (1964) 10 CL 
§175a.) But the transaction in this case was not ‘in the ordinary course of business’ and the buyers were 
therefore compelled to rely on s. 24.

133	 The words ‘or is in possession’ give rise to some difficulty, but were explained as covering the case where the 
seller did not originally have possession of the goods but only acquired it later.

	322	 The effects of the contract
However, if the seller did not gain possession of the goods at the time of the second 
transaction, the exception cannot apply. In Tahir Fadallah v John Pollak,136 the seller 
first came into possession of the goods not in the capacity of a seller, but as bailee on 
behalf of the person who had already bought the goods from that seller. As Seymour J 
noted:
It cannot be said that the distinction between a case in which a seller has continued in possession 
of goods which he has sold a second time, and a case in which, not having had possession 
of the goods at the time of the first sale, the seller subsequently obtained possession before 
making the second sale, is particularly satisfactory . . . Whether the distinction is satisfactory or 
not, it does seem to be clearly established.137
The delivery or transfer … of the goods or documents of title
On the face of it, the section appears to require that the goods should be delivered (or 
anyhow transferred) to the second buyer if he is to obtain a title binding on the first 
buyer. So if the seller sells goods to B1, but retains possession of them, and then sells 
them again (whether rightfully or wrongfully is immaterial) to B2, but still retains pos-
session of them, it seems that B2 obtains no title under the section, and B1 has the better 
claim. In Nicholson v Harper,138 a merchant owned some wine stored with warehouse-
men, the defendants; he sold 250 dozen old port to the plaintiffs who left the wine in the 
possession of the defendants, and apparently gave them no notice of their purchase, nor 
obtained any delivery orders or other acknowledgment of their claim. Later, the original 
seller pledged all his wine to the warehousemen, and he subsequently became insolvent. 
North J held that the property in the wine had passed to the plaintiffs under the first 
sale, and that the warehousemen obtained no title under s. 25 (now s. 24) of the Sale of 
Goods Act. Although the merchant was a seller who had retained possession under that 
section, there had been no delivery or transfer of possession to the warehousemen after 
the sale.
However, Nicholson v Harper was rejected as bad law by the Australian High Court 
in Gamer’s Motor Centre (Newcastle) Pty Ltd v Natwest Wholesale Australia Pty Ltd,139 
a case concerning the parallel provisions of s. 9 of the Factors Act and s. 25(1) of the Sale 
of Goods Act. In this case, the defendants agreed to sell eight cars to car dealers under 
an agreement whereby the sellers retained title until payment. The cars were delivered to 
the dealers who immediately resold them under a financing plan to the plaintiffs, while 
retaining possession of them for stock display. It was held (by a bare majority of the 
High Court) that the plaintiffs obtained a title to the cars, good against the defendants, 
because they had bought the cars from a buyer who had obtained the possession of the 
goods with the consent of the seller. Like s. 8, s. 9 of the Factors Act appears only to pro-
tect a buyer when there has been a delivery or transfer of the goods to him, but the High

139	 (1987) 163 CLR 236. But Nicholson v Harper was followed in New Zealand: New Zealand Securities & 
Finance Ltd v Wright Cars Ltd [1976] 1 NZLR 77.

	
	 	
Transfer of title by a non-owner	 323
Court held that it was already well established at the time that the original Sale of Goods 
Act was passed that this did not necessarily require a physical transfer of possession. 
The law recognised the concept of a ‘constructive delivery’ where the physical possession 
remained unaltered, but the right to possession was transferred. So if S sells goods to B1, 
and retains possession of them, and then sells them again to B2, although he may still 
retain the physical possession of the goods unaltered, there may then be a constructive 
delivery to B2, at least if B2 has an immediate right to possession. The section would 
then be satisfied, and B2 would have a better claim than B1.140	
Constructive doctrines are today often regarded as fictions, somewhat out of fash-
ion,141 and the High Court’s decision in the Gamer case may appear, at first sight, incon-
sistent with the general approach of the Privy Council in the Pacific Motor Auctions 
case, where the continuity of physical possession was stressed as the basis of s. 8 of the 
Factors Act, and where the Privy Council reversed another decision of the High Court 
on these statutory provisions. But the two cases are not entirely comparable, if only 
because the Gamer decision protects the bona fide purchaser for value, while the High 
Court’s decision in the Pacific Motor Auctions case did not. Furthermore, the policy of 
the Act suggests that the Gamer decision is preferable to Nicholson v Harper because (in 
a s. 8 case) the second buyer who pays the price of the goods is acting in reliance on his 
belief that the original seller retains title, having regard to his continued possession of 
the goods.142 Moreover, the other exceptions to the nemo dat principle, such as estoppel, 
s. 23 of the Act and s. 2 of the Factors Act, all appear to operate to protect the buyer as 
from the moment of the sale to him, provided at least that he has paid the price, or acted 
to his prejudice so as to constitute himself a bona fide purchaser for value. None of these 
provisions appears to require an actual delivery to the person claiming to be protected.143 
What is more, the second buyer is protected although he has only agreed to buy the 
goods and the property has not yet passed to him,144 so it would seem strange to insist 
on an actual physical delivery to him. In Michael Gerson (Leasing) Ltd v Wilkinson,145 
counsel for the claimant accepted that delivery in s. 24 includes constructive delivery 
and that it is not confined to physical delivery. Clarke LJ accepted that both concessions 
were correctly made. They accorded with the decision of the High Court of Australia 
in Gamer’s Motor Centre (Newcastle) Proprietary Ltd v Natwest Wholesale Australia 
Proprietary Ltd146 which he had followed at first instance in Forsythe International (UK) 
Ltd v Silver Shipping Co Ltd.147
140	 See Forsythe International (UK) Ltd v Silver Shipping Co Ltd [1994] 1 WLR 1334.
141	 Though there is modern case law applying the concept of constructive delivery in a different context: Four 
Point Garage Ltd v Carter [1985] 3 All ER 12.
142	 In the NSW Court of Appeal, McHugh JA suggested that it was ‘curious that the legislature, having 
penalised the owner for allowing the buyer to have possession, intended the sub-buyer to obtain a good 
title even though he leaves the same goods in the possession of the same person’: Gamer’s Motor Centre 
(Newcastle) Pty Ltd v Natwest Wholesale Australia Pty Ltd [1985] 2 NSWLR 475, 490. But the answer to 
this is that the seller has induced the injurious reliance of the second buyer by allowing the first to have 
possession, while the second buyer has induced no reliance at all.
143	 But as to estoppel, see Shaw v Commissioner of Met Police [1987] 1 WLR 1332, above, p. 302.
144	 This is the effect of s. 8, differing in this respect from s. 24 of the 1979 Act.

	324	 The effects of the contract
Sale, pledge or other disposition
In most cases, the party claiming the protection of this section will rely on a sale or 
pledge, but the section also refers to other ‘disposition’. In Worcester Works Finance 
Ltd v Cooden Engineering Co Ltd,148 the Court of Appeal held that this was a very wide 
word, but that it did not cover a mere transfer of possession; there must be some transfer 
of an interest in the goods to constitute a disposition. In this case, one G bought a car 
from the defendants, paying the price with a cheque which was not met. He then sold 
the car to another finance company – the plaintiffs – but retained the possession of the 
car as he had induced the plaintiffs to accept a hire-purchase proposal for the benefit 
of an accomplice. Subsequently, the defendants, with the consent of G, retook the car 
from him. It was held that the defendants were protected as against the plaintiffs. So far 
as the plaintiffs were concerned, G was a seller who remained in possession. Moreover, 
the retaking of the car by the defendants was a ‘disposition’ by G to them inasmuch as 
it amounted to a rescission of the contract between them and therefore it revested the 
property in the defendants.
This case is also authority for the proposition that a party relying on s. 8 of the Fac-
tors Act need not prove that the seller remained in possession with the consent of the 
buyer. The difference in wording between ss. 2 and 8 in this respect clearly shows that s. 8 
was intended to apply even where the seller wrongfully retains possession after the sale.
Good faith and notice
The second buyer is only protected if he acts in good faith and without notice of the pre-
vious sale. Notice presumably has its usual commercial meaning here, so that it applies 
only to actual and not to constructive notice; ‘there is no general duty on a buyer of 
goods in an ordinary commercial transaction to make inquiries as to the right of the 
seller to dispose of the goods’.149 There is no independent requirement in this section 
that the transaction should be made ‘in the ordinary course of business’, though of 
course a transaction outside the ordinary course of business may sometimes be sufficient 
to put the buyer on inquiry.
Application of s. 8
As is to be expected, s. 8 only applies when the property in the goods has passed to the 
buyer under the contract of sale, because if the property has not so passed, obviously 
the seller sells by virtue of his property in the goods and no statutory exception to the 
nemo dat rule is needed. Hence, s. 8 only applies where the seller has ‘sold’ (not ‘agreed 
to sell’) the goods.

Transfer of title by a non-owner	 325
Buyer in possession
Section 9 of the Factors Act and s. 25(1) of the Sale of Goods Act contain provisions 
parallel to those of s. 8 and s. 24. Section 9 is as follows:
Where a person, having bought or agreed to buy goods, obtains with the consent of the seller 
possession of the goods or the documents of title to the goods, the delivery or transfer, by that 
person or by a mercantile agent acting for him, of the goods or the documents of title under 
any sale, pledge or other disposition thereof [or under any agreement for sale, pledge or other 
disposition thereof], to any person receiving the same in good faith and without notice of any 
lien or other right of the original seller in respect of the goods, shall have the same effect as if 
the person making the delivery or transfer were a mercantile agent in possession of the goods 
or documents of title with the consent of the owner.
The words placed in square brackets in the text are omitted in s. 25(1) of the Sale of 
Goods Act,150 so the ensuing discussion is in terms of s. 9 because it is the wider pro-
vision. Section 26 of the Sale of Goods Act defines the term ‘mercantile agent’, but the 
definition merely repeats that incorporated in s. 1(1) of the Factors Act 1889. This has 
already been discussed in connection with s. 2 of the Factors Act.151
A person ‘having bought or agreed to buy goods’
It has already been seen that s. 8 only applies where the property has passed to the first 
buyer before the second sale because otherwise the special provision is not necessary. 
But s. 9 applies where the first buyer has ‘bought or agreed to buy goods’, that is to say, 
it applies whether or not the property has passed to the first buyer. This is a strange 
provision for it is not easy to see why there should be any special enactment to protect a 
person who has bought goods from a buyer in possession when the property has already 
passed to this buyer. Prima facie the buyer can sell the goods in these circumstances and 
pass a good title by virtue of his own property. It is to be hoped that a court would dis-
miss as mere surplusage the words ‘bought or’ in s. 9 even though the section imposes 
certain restrictions on the buyer’s ability to pass a good title to a third party;152 in fact, 
(as appears below) it is not easy to envisage circumstances in which these restrictions 
would become applicable. But possibly they do not matter anyhow because it is arguable 
that a buyer can always pass property even at common law if it has already passed to 
him, and therefore s. 9 could be ignored in such a case.
Where a buyer has resold goods supplied under a reservation of title clause,153 a sub-
purchaser can acquire a good title under this provision (as well as s. 2(1) of the Factors 
Act). But if the goods are in turn supplied by the buyer to the sub-purchaser under the 
reservation of title clause, it would seem that the words in s. 9 which do not appear in 
s. 25 of the Sale of Goods Act (in square brackets where the section is set out above) do 
not serve to defeat the original seller’s retention of title clause. Unless and until the sub-
purchaser has paid for the goods, or satisfied such other conditions as may have been

	326	 The effects of the contract
stipulated by the buyer for the passing of property to the sub-purchaser, the original 
seller is entitled to repossess.154
The fact that s. 9 only applies where a person has bought or agreed to buy goods 
means that there must be a contract of sale within the meaning of the Act.155 If a sup-
plier contracts to sell goods to a building contractor who is engaged on building works 
and the goods are delivered direct to the building site, and the contractor subsequently 
becomes insolvent without having paid his supplier, title to the goods may be disputed 
between the original supplier and the owner of the site for whom the work is being done. 
If the goods have been delivered to the site under a contract of sale, title can pass under 
s. 9 of the Factors Act. The supplier is a seller, the contractor has undoubtedly bought 
or agreed to buy the goods, and delivery to the site is a delivery to the contractor who is 
thus in possession of the goods. So his contract with the building owner may be a sale or 
other disposition which transfers title. But if the first relevant contract is not a contract 
of sale but (for instance) a contract for services, s. 9 will not apply at all, and the original 
owner may be able to reclaim the goods. So where a contractor had agreed to do certain 
building works, and a subcontractor had agreed to supply and fix the roof slates, the 
delivery of the slates to the site by the subcontractor did not pass title to the building 
owner under s. 9.156 The first relevant contract here was that between the contractor and 
the subcontractor which was not a contract of sale at all, so s. 9 simply did not apply. In 
practice the position is today often complicated by special conditions of sale as well as 
special conditions in building contracts which may provide that the title to goods deliv-
ered to a site passes forthwith to the building owner.157
Other problems which arise from the need to show that there was a contract of sale 
in the strict sense, before s. 9 can apply, relate to hire-purchase and similar agreements. 
Because a contract of sale is defined by s. 2(1) of the Act as a contract under which the 
seller transfers or agrees to transfer the property in goods to the buyer in return for a 
money consideration, a mere option to purchase cannot be a contract of sale until the 
option is exercised. It is for this reason, as we have seen, that the ordinary hire-purchase 
agreement is drafted in the form of a bailment with an option to purchase. A person 
in possession of goods under such an agreement is not a person who has ‘bought or 
agreed to buy goods’ within the meaning of s. 9 of the Factors Act.158 On the other 
hand, ‘A contract of sale may be absolute or conditional’,159 and a person in possession 
of goods under a contract in which the transfer of the property is conditional, whether

Transfer of title by a non-owner	 327
on payment160 or on the occurrence of some other event,161 was until 1965 treated as a 
person who had agreed to buy goods within s. 9. Between 1889 and 1965, then, the law 
distinguished fundamentally between cases where a person obtained possession of goods 
under a hire-purchase agreement, to which s. 25(1) of the Sale of Goods Act and s. 9 of 
the Factors Act did not apply (Helby v Matthews)162 and cases where a person obtained 
possession under a conditional sale agreement, to which those sections did apply (Lee v 
Butler).163
However, the law on this point was profoundly modified by the Hire-Purchase Act 
1964. In accordance with the general assimilation of conditional sale agreements to 
hire-purchase agreements since that Act, it is now provided that, for the purposes of  
s. 9 of the Factors Act (and s. 25(1) of the Sale of Goods Act), ‘the buyer under a condi-
tional sale agreement is to be taken not to be a person who has bought or agreed to buy 
goods’.164 A conditional sale agreement for the purposes of this provision is an agree-
ment for the sale of goods which is a consumer credit agreement, and under which:
. . . the purchase price or part of it is payable by instalments, and the property in the goods is to 
remain in the seller (notwithstanding that the buyer is to be in possession of the goods) until 
such conditions as to the payment of the instalments or otherwise as may be specified in the 
agreement are fulfilled.165
An agreement in which the price is not payable by instalments is not, therefore, a 
conditional sale agreement for this purpose and remains within the protection of s. 9 of 
the Factors Act even though it is conditional upon some other event.166
It is important to observe that the provisions of the law relating to conditional sales 
mentioned above are confined to agreements which are consumer credit agreements 
within the protection of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. In other words, a buyer in pos-
session under a conditional sale agreement can still pass a good title under s. 9 of the 
Factors Act if the total credit provided exceeds £15,000 or if the buyer is a corporation.
It is apparent, then, that these Acts have to a large extent done away with the distinc-
tion between conditional sale agreements and hire-purchase agreements which formerly 
existed as a result of the celebrated cases of Lee v Butler167 and Helby v Matthews.168 
In view of the fact that the tendency over the last century has been to widen the cir-
cumstances in which a non-owner can transfer a good title, this particular move may 
seem a retrograde step. The justification for it appears to be that, in practice, conditional 
sale agreements of this kind have not been commonly used as a method of consumer 
finance, and that it was desirable to assimilate the law relating to conditional sale and 
hire-purchase, partly in order to prevent evasion of the Acts and partly in the interests 
of simplicity. Moreover, the practical effect of this statutory modification of Lee v Butler 
is much qualified by the special provisions relating to motor vehicles. As will be seen

	328	 The effects of the contract
later, Part III of the Hire-Purchase Act 1964 protects a bona fide private purchaser of a 
motor vehicle from a person in possession under a hire-purchase or a conditional sale 
agreement.169
A person who obtains goods on ‘sale or return’ has also been said to be outside the 
provisions of s. 9 because he also is not a person who has agreed to buy goods, although 
in a certain sense he has made a conditional contract of sale.170 We have already seen that 
in many cases it makes no difference whether a person who has taken goods on sale or 
return comes within s. 9 or not, because if he sells or pledges the goods he does an act 
adopting the transaction within s. 18, Rule 4(b) and the property passes to him, with the 
result that the sub-buyer or pledgee is protected. We have also seen that it is possible to 
contract out of s. 18,171 but it is not possible to contract out of s. 9 of the Factors Act, so 
that in this event it is of vital importance to decide whether the case comes within s. 9 
or not.
A person who is entrusted with goods as a mere agent to sell them is not within the 
section,172 for the obvious reason that he has not bought or agreed to buy them within 
the meaning of the section. But if he is a mercantile agent, as defined in the Factors Act, 
then he can pass a good title under s. 2 of that Act; and it may also be possible for a 
buyer from him to claim that he has acquired title at common law simply on the ground 
that the agent sold the goods within his actual, usual or ostensible authority.
The consent of the seller
The protection afforded to a third party by s. 9 is only available if the goods were in the 
possession of the buyer with the consent of the seller. This is similar to the requirement 
which appears in s. 2, and, mutatis mutandis, the law is the same. Consequently, it is not 
material that the buyer obtained the goods by a criminal offence, the only question being 
whether the seller in fact consented to the buyer having possession.173 Nor is it material 
that the seller has revoked his consent to the buyer having possession. As we have seen,  
s. 2(2) of the Factors Act specifically states that the subsequent withdrawal of his con-
sent by the seller does not prevent the operation of the Act. This means that the deci-
sion in Car & Universal Finance Co v Caldwell174 is of little practical importance. In 
that case, as we have seen, it was held that a contract of sale induced by fraud could be 
rescinded without communicating with the fraudulent party. But it is now clear that the 
only result of this is to force the third party to rely on s. 9 of the Factors Act instead of  
s. 23 of the Sale of Goods Act.175

175	 But there is one important respect in which s. 9 may be narrower than s. 23 – below, p. 334.

	
	 	
Transfer of title by a non-owner	 329
Possession of the goods
It is clear that the section only applies where the first buyer has actually obtained posses-
sion of the goods176 or documents of title to the goods, and it is not enough that he has 
merely bought or agreed to buy them. So long as the seller retains possession he cannot 
be affected by a resale by the first buyer unless he has assented to it in terms of s. 47(1) 
which we have already examined,177 or unless he is affected by an estoppel. On the other 
hand, if the seller, at the request of the first buyer, himself delivers the goods direct to a 
sub-buyer, this is enough to bring the second buyer within the protection of the section. 
There is a constructive delivery to the first buyer, and a constructive delivery by him to 
the second buyer, and that is sufficient for the section to operate.178
It is, however, uncertain if the section will apply whatever the nature of the buyer’s 
possession. For instance, would the section apply if a person agrees to sell a car, but 
insists on a cash price, and then allows the buyer to take the car to a garage for an emer-
gency repair?179 Despite some doubts expressed in Australia,180 it is thought that the 
section would apply. In Marten v Whale,181 it was applied even though the goods were 
temporarily loaned to the buyer, and the analogy of the Pacific Motor Auction182 case 
appears virtually conclusive.
It is also important that the buyer obtains possession of the goods after the contract 
of sale with the seller was concluded, so in Fadallah v Pollak,183 where the buyer was in 
possession of the goods as bailee before agreeing to buy them, it was held that s. 25 of 
the Sale of Goods Act could not apply.	
In Forsythe International (UK) v Silver Shipping Co and Petroglobe International 
(The Saetta),184 the plaintiff had supplied bunkers to the charterer of a vessel under a 
retention of title clause. The charterer did not pay for the bunkers. The owner subse-
quently withdrew the vessel from service for non-payment of hire, and used the bunkers. 
The plaintiff sued in conversion, and it was held that there would be conversion unless 
there was a delivery to the owner justified by s. 25(1) of the Sale of Goods Act. It was 
held that ‘possession’ had the same meaning in the Factors Act 1889 and in s. 25(1), and 
was not limited to physical possession. However, the owner succeeded because it was 
held that the transfer of the bunkers was not achieved by a voluntary act on the part of 
the charterer, but by termination by the owner.185
176	 Rutherford and Todd (1979) 38 CLJ 346 argue, on the basis of the legislative history of the Acts, that  
s. 25(1) and s. 9 of the Factors Act were not intended to apply to a buyer in possession of goods (as opposed 
to documents of title). But the argument is of historical interest only because the wording of the sections 
and the uniform current of case law extending for almost a century preclude this narrow interpretation 
today.

	330	 The effects of the contract
Documents of title
Where the buyer has obtained the documents of title to the goods with the consent of 
the seller, the position is a little more complicated as a result of the seller’s right of lien 
and of stoppage in transit, if he is still unpaid. Section 47 of the Sale of Goods Act 
reproduces in almost identical terms s. 10 of the Factors Act 1889, although the latter is 
not repealed. Section 47(2) is as follows:
Where a document of title to goods has been lawfully transferred to any person as buyer or 
owner of the goods, and that person transfers the document to a person who takes it in good 
faith and for valuable consideration, then—
(a)	 if the last-mentioned transfer was by way of sale the unpaid seller’s right of lien . . . or 
stoppage in transit is defeated, and
(b)	 if the last-mentioned transfer was made by way of pledge or other disposition for value, 
the unpaid seller’s right of lien . . . or stoppage in transit can only be exercised subject to 
the rights of the transferee.
It is sometimes suggested that this section is more favourable to the third party than s. 
9 of the Factors Act because it says nothing about the requirement that he must not have 
notice of the rights of the original seller, but it may be doubted whether this really adds 
anything to the requirement of good faith.
It must be added that s. 19(3) of the Sale of Goods Act is subject to these sections. In 
Cahn v Pockett’s Bristol Channel Steam Packet Co Ltd,186 the sellers shipped copper on 
the defendants’ ship and sent bills of lading, together with a draft, to the buyers. The 
buyers, being insolvent, did not accept the draft, but they transferred the bills of lading 
to the plaintiffs in pursuance of a contract previously made. The sellers, learning of 
the buyers’ bankruptcy, stopped the goods in transit. The Court of Appeal held that, 
although the buyers had acted wrongfully in transferring the bills of lading when they 
did not accept the draft, this breach of s. 19(3) did not deprive the plaintiffs of the 
protection afforded by s. 47 of the Sale of Goods Act.187
Although s. 47 only talks of a transfer of a document of title, it has been held that 
it applies also where the documents are issued by the seller to the buyer and transferred 
by the latter to a third party taking in good faith and for value.188 On the other hand, 
s. 47(2) apparently applies only where it is the same document which is transferred (or 
issued) to the buyer, and by the buyer to the third party.189 In contrast, s. 9 applies even 
where there are two separate documents.190

Transfer of title by a non-owner	 331
Delivery or transfer of the goods191
The first buyer, having acquired possession of the goods (or of the documents of title) must 
make a delivery or transfer of them (or of the documents) before the section can apply. In 
Forsythe International (UK) v Silver Shipping Co and Petrograde International (The Sae-
tta),192 it was held that ‘delivery or transfer’ required some voluntary act, though actual 
physical delivery was not required, so that where the owner of a vessel terminated for 
non-payment of hire, there was no ‘delivery or transfer’ within the meaning of s. 25(1) of the 
Sale of Goods Act. The same would equally apply in relation to s. 8 of the Factors Act 1889.
As we saw in considering the parallel provisions of s. 8 of the Factors Act, there is some 
uncertainty as to the possibility of recognising a ‘constructive delivery’ for the purposes of 
this section.193 It has at least been held that if the seller, at the request of the first buyer, deliv-
ers the goods direct to the second buyer, this is a sufficient constructive delivery to the first 
buyer and by him to the second buyer.194 But it is less clear whether, if the goods are delivered 
to and remain in the possession of the first buyer, a contract for the sale of the goods to the 
second buyer can itself be treated as enough to amount to a constructive delivery. The cases 
in this connection were discussed earlier, when considering s. 8.195
There are a number of cases in which it has been assumed, without argument, that 
a sub-buyer can obtain title under s. 9 even in part of an undivided bulk.196 But it has 
been pointed out that this may be inconsistent with s. 16 of the Act, which (as seen 
above)197 does not permit a transfer of property in an undivided bulk of goods except 
in the circumstances set out in s. 20A inserted by the 1995 Act.198 The argument rests on 
the assumption that a sub-buyer of an undivided part of a bulk cannot sue the seller in 
conversion because he has no property, and if he cannot sue in conversion, he cannot 
acquire a title under s. 9. No doubt there may be cases where difficulties arise, but so 
long as the dispute lies solely between a seller and a sub-buyer (which is the usual case 
dealt with by s. 9) there seems nothing in policy against (and everything in favour of) 
recognising a distinction between ‘property’ in the s. 16 sense, and a right of possession 
necessary to maintain an action of conversion. If the sub-buyer has an immediate right 
to possession in the sense that he may demand separation of his share of the goods from 
the remainder of the bulk, it would be pure pedantry to deny him the right to claim a 
title under s. 9, merely because as between himself and the intermediate seller there has 
not been a separation of the part sold from the rest sufficient to pass property. But it 
must be admitted that more difficulty may arise where insolvency is in issue, or where 
there is also a dispute between the sub-buyer and intermediate seller.

	332	 The effects of the contract
It is also important to note that delivery (whether actual or constructive) has to 
occur after the second contract has been concluded. In Fadallah v Pollak,199 the pur-
ported constructive delivery to the second buyer had occurred at least two weeks 
before the contract with that buyer had been concluded, and therefore s.25 of the Sale 
of Goods Act would not have applied (the court having already decided that it did not  
apply because the first buyer had already been in possession before agreeing to buy the 
goods).
Sale, pledge or other disposition
One difference between the wording of s. 9 and s. 25(1) of the Sale of Goods Act is the 
presence which we noted at the outset of the words ‘or under any agreement for sale, 
pledge or other disposition’ in s. 9. If the buyer were to sell the goods on under a reten-
tion of title clause,200 the sub-buyer could not acquire title under s. 25(1) until title had 
passed to him.201 But s. 9 of the Factors Act applies where the goods are obtained under 
any ‘agreement [emphasis supplied] for sale, pledge or other disposition’. It had been 
suggested that a sub-purchaser might be able to rely on this provision when in possession 
under a reservation of title clause.202 In Re Highway Foods International Ltd,203 it was 
held that in such a situation the original seller could claim title to the goods, however.204 
The effect of s. 9 is that in favour of a bona fide purchaser an agreement for sale has the 
same effect as if the person making the transfer were a mercantile agent in possession 
with the consent of the owner.205 But s. 2(1) of the Factors Act, which deals with the 
powers of a mercantile agent in possession, only provides that any sale etc. by a mercan-
tile agent in possession with the consent of the owner shall be as valid as if the mercan-
tile agent were authorised by the owner.
What amounts to a sale, pledge or other disposition has been considered in con-
nection with s. 24 of the Act.206 In the present context it may also be relevant to draw 
attention to some cases dealing with a delivery of goods by a seller to a building site, 
where the buyer, a contractor, has contracted to install or incorporate them into a build-
ing. The contract between the contractor and the building owner may in this situation 
not be a strict contract of sale because of the contractor’s obligations to install or affix 
the materials, but it seems that this is at least another ‘disposition’ within the meaning 
of the section.207 This situation must be distinguished from that in which the first con-
tract relied upon is not a sale of goods because in that case the section does not apply  
at all.208

Transfer of title by a non-owner	 333
Good faith and notice
The third party must take the goods ‘in good faith and without notice of any lien or 
other right of the original seller in respect of the goods’. Clearly, if the seller retains the 
property in the goods after delivery and the buyer has no right to dispose of the goods 
pending payment of the price or fulfilment of some other condition, any sub-buyer who 
takes the goods with notice of the circumstances will not be protected by the section. 
Notice, as usual in commercial law, means actual and not constructive notice.209
So far the effect of the section is clear enough. It is much less easy to understand the 
effect of the section with regard to two other questions, namely the effect of a sub-sale 
on the seller’s lien, and the possible application of the section where the property in  
the goods has passed to the buyer. Where the buyer is in possession of the goods with the 
consent of the seller, it is difficult to see how the seller can have any lien or other right in 
respect of the goods. Under s. 43(1), the unpaid seller loses his lien:
(b)	 when the buyer or his agent lawfully obtains possession of the goods.
If the buyer has obtained possession with the consent of the seller, it seems to fol-
low of necessity that he has lawfully obtained possession and it is submitted that this is 
still the case if the buyer has obtained possession by a criminal offence. This question 
was discussed in the New Zealand Court of Appeal in Jeffcott v Andrews Motors Ltd210 
where, however, the court bypassed the issue. It was there held unnecessary to decide 
whether the seller’s lien could survive where the buyer obtained possession of the goods 
by criminal fraud, on the ground that in any event the third party was protected by the 
terms of s. 9. If the lien survives in such circumstances the survival must be purely aca-
demic and, it seems, quite meaningless as it gives the seller no right to obtain the posses-
sion of the goods from the third party. It is therefore submitted that in whatever capacity 
the buyer obtains control of the goods, provided it is with the consent of the owner,  
s. 9 applies and the buyer can pass a good title to an innocent third party free from the 
seller’s claims.
However, if the buyer merely obtains possession of the documents of title to the goods 
and not of the goods themselves, it may be that in some circumstances the seller could 
still have a lien on the goods themselves, and effect could then be given to the section by 
holding that a purchaser with notice of the lien would take subject to the lien, whether 
or not the property had passed to the original buyer. This is an unlikely eventuality, how-
ever, for possession of the documents of title normally carries with it possession of the 
goods themselves – this is certainly the case with bills of lading – and it could only be in 
the most extraordinary circumstances that the seller could transfer the documents to the 
buyer while retaining a lien on the goods themselves.
Apart from the possibility of the seller retaining his lien, the section also requires 
that the third party should take without notice of any ‘other right of the original seller 
in respect of the goods’. But where the buyer has already bought the goods so that the 
property has passed to him, it is again not easy to see of what ‘other right of the original 
seller’ the third party can have notice. The mere fact that the price has not been paid to 
209	 See P4 Ltd v Unite Integrated Solutions plc [2006] BLR 150.
210	 [1960] NZLR 721.

	334	 The effects of the contract
the knowledge of the third party surely cannot bring this clause into operation because 
it is a common business occurrence for a seller to be paid for goods before he himself 
has paid for them, and knowledge of these circumstances can scarcely be held to put the 
buyers upon inquiry.211 In any event, this would not seem to be a right ‘in respect of the 
goods’ but a personal right in respect of the contract of sale. Moreover, if the property 
has passed to the buyer it is hard to see how there can be any question of bad faith on 
the part of the sub-buyer. Even if he is aware that the buyer has not paid the seller and 
cannot do so because he has become insolvent, it is clear that the original seller cannot 
impugn the sub-buyer’s title on the ground of bad faith; otherwise a person could never 
safely buy goods which he knew had not been paid for. It is, therefore, submitted that 
the requirement that the third party must receive the goods ‘in good faith and without 
notice of any lien or other right of the original seller in respect of the goods’ can gener-
ally only be applicable where the property has not passed to the buyer, and even then it is 
difficult to see how any question of lien can arise.212
Effect of s. 9
There is one curious but important difference in the wording of ss. 8 and 9. The former 
says that a sale by a seller in possession shall, subject to the conditions laid down, ‘have 
the same effect as if the person making the delivery or transfer were expressly author-
ised by the owner of the goods to make the same’. On the other hand, s. 9 says that a 
sale by a buyer in possession shall, subject to the conditions already discussed, have the 
same effect ‘as if the person making the delivery or transfer were a mercantile agent in 
possession of the goods or documents of title with the consent of the owner’. What 
exactly is the significance of these last words? If read literally they would appear to cre-
ate a serious difficulty because, it may be recalled, an unauthorised sale by a mercantile 
agent in possession of goods with the consent of the owner is only made effective to 
pass a title by s. 2(1) of the Factors Act 1889 if the mercantile agent is acting in the 
ordinary course of business. If a person is not a mercantile agent, how can he be said 
to act in the ordinary course of business of a mercantile agent? As Pearson LJ said in 
Newtons of Wembley Ltd v Williams,213 ‘It seems on the face of it to be an impossible 
position.’ Nevertheless, the Court of Appeal thought that the buyer must somehow be 
treated as a notional mercantile agent, and the court has to ask whether the sale would 
have been in the ordinary course of business had he been a mercantile agent. In this case,  
the court decided that the sale would have been in the ordinary course, so it may be that the  
court’s view on the main issue could be regarded as obiter. But this cannot be said of 
the earlier and unreported case of Lambert v G & C Finance Corporation Ltd.214 In this 
case, the plaintiff sold his car to X, who offered him a cheque for the price. The plaintiff 
reluctantly accepted the cheque but insisted on keeping the log book until the cheque

was met. In fact, the cheque was worthless and X sold the car to a dealer, who disposed 
of it to the defendants. The learned judge held that the retention of the log book showed 
an intention that the property was not to pass until the cheque was met and that the 
defendants did not obtain a title under s. 9 of the Factors Act. Since X had sold the car 
without the log book, the learned judge had no difficulty in holding that the sale was not 
in the ordinary course of business, or rather would not have been in the ordinary course 
of X’s business had he been a mercantile agent.215
In the Lambert and the Newtons of Wembley cases, it may well be that substantial 
justice was done. But if the dicta in the latter case are followed this may not always be 
possible. For example, a sale by a mercantile agent outside business premises would not 
generally be in the ordinary course of business.216 But if a private individual who is not 
a mercantile agent were, for example, to sell a second-hand car, the sale would almost 
certainly take place outside business premises, and a strict application of the Newtons 
of Wembley case would take the case outside s. 9. In the circumstances, it is unfortunate 
that the court was not referred to dicta in Australia217 and New Zealand,218 which take 
a contrary view. On this view, the effect of a sale by a buyer in possession is the same 
‘as if’ the buyer was a mercantile agent and the sale was in the ordinary course of his 
business. ‘The section operates to validate a sale as if the buyer in possession were a 
mercantile agent; it does not require that he should act as though he were a mercantile 
agent.’219 There is no doubt that this was thought to be the law in Lee v Butler220 and was 
assumed to be the law ever since that case until the Newtons of Wembley case. In 1966, 
the Law Reform Committee recommended that the law be amended to restore the posi-
tion to what it was formerly thought to be,221 but nothing has been done to implement 
this recommendation.
On the other hand, in a case in Northern Ireland222 the dicta in the Newtons of Wem-
bley case were followed by Lord Lowry CJ, who insisted that it would be absurd if a 
buyer from an ordinary seller was in a better position than a buyer from a mercantile 
agent because this would make s. 9 of the Factors Act a greater invasion of title than s. 2.
The key to the meaning of s. 9’s ‘shorthand’ [said Lord Lowry] must be that innocent 
purchasers can be protected not only (as they were originally meant to be) when dealing with 
mercantile agents acting in the ordinary course of a mercantile agent’s business, but also with 
ordinary persons acting in the way in which a mercantile agent would be expected to act in the 
ordinary course of business.223
Although Lord Lowry may be correct in suggesting that this was the original inten-
tion behind s. 9, the contrary view was acted on for so long (beginning, indeed, with Lee

v Butler in 1893) that it seems very late in the day to return now to that view. Moreover, 
as a matter of policy, one may disagree with his suggestion that it would be absurd to 
protect the bona fide purchaser where the intermediate buyer has not acted as though he 
were a mercantile agent. A seller who actually delivers the goods to a buyer before being 
paid chooses to trust to that buyer’s credit, and there seems every reason why he should 
take the risk if that buyer wrongfully resells the goods to an innocent purchaser in good 
faith.
Effect of s. 9 where seller is not the owner
One difficult point remains to be mentioned. What is the effect of s. 9 where the seller 
was not himself the owner of the goods and had no authority to sell from the owner? For 
instance, if a thief steals a car and sells it to a car dealer who resells it, does s. 9 apply to 
the resale? A literal reading of the section might suggest that it would protect the second 
buyer in this situation, on the ground that the first buyer is a person who has bought or 
agreed to buy the goods, and that the sale by him to the second buyer is then to have the 
same effect as if it had been made by a mercantile agent in possession of the goods with 
the consent of the owner. But this literal reading of the section was rejected by the House 
of Lords in National Employers Mutual General Insurance Association Ltd v Jones.224 
The words ‘with the consent of the owner’ at the end of the section were here interpreted 
to mean, ‘with the consent of the owner who has entrusted him with, or consented to 
his having the possession of, the goods or of the documents of title to the goods’.225 The 
whole point of these provisions is that they are designed to protect someone who buys 
from a person who has been entrusted with the goods or documents of title. No rational 
policy could defend protecting a second buyer after a theft, but not a first buyer.226
Part III of the Hire Purchase Act 1964
Part III of the Hire Purchase Act 1964 (as re-enacted by the Consumer Credit Act 1974) 
provides, in essence, that a bona fide private purchaser for value of a motor vehicle from 
a person in possession under a hire-purchase agreement or a conditional sale agree-
ment227 obtains a good title. The simplicity of result contrasts starkly with the complex-
ity of the statutory language, which occupies four full pages in the Queen’s printer’s 
copy of the Act. Section 27(1) and (2) of the 1964 Act228 are as follows:	
(1)	 This section applies where a motor vehicle has been bailed or (in Scotland) hired under a 
hire-purchase agreement, or has been agreed to be sold under a conditional sale agreement, 
224	 [1990] 1 AC 24, upholding the view contended for in earlier editions of this work. See the 7th edn, pp. 302–3 
for some Commonwealth cases no longer of importance in England.
225	 For a useful note on this case, see Battersby (1991) 54 MLR 752.
226	 If the views of Battersby and Preston (1972) 35 MLR 268 are correct, the effect of a theft is to create a 
second title within which the Factors Act would apply in the normal way to defeat the rights of the ‘owner’ 
under that title, but not of course the rights of the true owner.
227	 It must therefore be the debtor named in the agreement. So title could not be gained under s. 27 from a 
rogue masquerading as a real person who was named as the debtor in a hire-purchase agreement – Shogun 
Finance Ltd v Hudson [2003] UKHL 62.

and before the property in the vehicle has become vested in the debtor, he disposes of the 
vehicle to another person.
(2)	 Where the disposition referred to in subsection (1) is to a private purchaser, and he is a pur-
chaser of the motor vehicle in good faith without notice of the hire-purchase agreement or 
conditional sale agreement (the ‘relevant agreement’), that disposition shall have effect as 
if the creditor’s title to the vehicle had been vested in the debtor immediately before that 
disposition.
Thus, the power of a person in possession under a conditional sale agreement to pass 
a title which was taken away by the sections already discussed was, so far as concerns 
motor vehicles, in effect restored by this section. There is, however, one important limi-
tation on this power to pass title and that is that a ‘trade or finance purchaser’ is not pro-
tected. The ‘private purchaser’ referred to in s. 27(2) is any purchaser other than a trade 
or finance purchaser, and this term is defined by s. 29(2) to mean a person who carries on 
a business which consists wholly or partly:
(a)	 of purchasing motor vehicles for the purpose of offering or exposing them for sale, or
(b)	 of providing finance by purchasing motor vehicles for the purpose of bailing or (in  
Scotland) hiring them under hire-purchase agreements or agreeing to sell them under  
conditional sale agreements.
It will be seen that these provisions do not deprive all business concerns of protec-
tion under Part III. A large company which buys an expensive lorry may obtain title 
under Part III. It is only the car dealer229 and the finance company that are outside the 
protection of these sections. It has been held that what matters under these provisions is 
the status of the buyer and not the capacity in which he buys. Thus, a person who deals 
in motor vehicles is a trade purchaser and outside the protection of the sections, even 
though he buys a vehicle for his own private use.230 Similarly, a company offering loans to 
individuals with a bad credit history by using the individual’s car as security (assigned by 
means of a bill of sale) was not a private purchaser.231
If a trade or finance purchaser, having acquired a vehicle from a hirer in possession 
under a hire-purchase agreement, proceeds to dispose of it to a third party, the third 
party will be protected by s. 27(3). The section also deals with the possibility that a 
vehicle which has been disposed of by a hirer to a finance company is then re-let under  
a new hire-purchase agreement to a new hirer. In this event, the new agreement is itself a 
disposition by virtue of the definition in s. 29(1) and the new hirer is protected. Moreo-
ver, his protection is not displaced by the fact that, before he exercises his option to pur-
chase, the true facts may have come to light. Section 27(4) provides, in effect, that in such 
circumstances the time for determining whether the new hirer is in good faith or not is 
when he enters into the hire-purchase agreement and not when he exercises his option 
to purchase. It may be noted that the trade or finance purchaser will not itself be better 
off as a result of the subsequent disposition because it will remain liable in conversion 
to the original owner under s. 27(6). In Scotland, the trade or finance purchaser is liable 
229	 This does not require the purchaser to have formally set itself up as a car dealer at the relevant time.  
It suffices that vehicles are bought as a business venture with a view to selling them at a profit – GE Capital 
Bank Ltd v Rushton and Jenking [2005] EWCA Civ 1556.

	338	 The effects of the contract
to the deprived owner insofar as the former is enriched by the transaction. Arguments 
that he might also be liable under the doctrine of specificatio have been authoritatively 
rejected.232
A trade or finance purchaser, though unprotected by these sections,233 can apply to 
either Equifax or Experian for information. But, as we have seen,234 there was no redress 
where the owner of a vehicle let under a hire-purchase agreement had failed to notify the 
predecessor of the first of these bodies, Hire Purchase Information, of the agreement. 
The position would appear to be the same in relation to Equifax or Experian. Accord-
ingly, a purchaser will buy in good faith if he or she has been told there is no agreement 
registered with either of them.
The first requirement of these provisions, then, is that the vehicle must have been 
let under a hire-purchase agreement or been agreed to be sold under a conditional sale 
agreement. The Act does not, therefore, apply where the vehicle has been let under a 
simple hiring agreement. Nor does the Act have any bearing on the situation which arose 
in Central Newbury Car Auctions Ltd v Unity Finance Ltd,235 where a dealer allowed 
a swindler to have possession of a vehicle on his signing hire-purchase proposal forms 
which were later rejected by the finance company. It seems anomalous that the dealer is 
not at risk in this sort of case for he clearly takes a much greater chance than a dealer 
who actually enters into a hire-purchase agreement himself. If the finance company 
accepts the hirer’s proposals in this sort of case, then presumably his power to pass title 
becomes effective as from the moment when the contract is completed, that is, in most 
cases, when the acceptance is posted to him.
It is important to note that the Act does not require the hirer to be in possession 
under the hire-purchase agreement.236 It merely requires that the vehicle ‘has been bailed 
under a hire-purchase agreement’ and that the hirer should have disposed of it before 
the property has passed to him.237 And the definition of ‘debtor’ in s. 29(4) makes it 
clear that even if the agreement has already been determined, the former hirer is still the 
debtor for the purposes of s. 27. So also is a hirer who is in possession under a time order 
made under s. 130(4) of the Consumer Credit Act.238
The next requirement of these provisions is that there must have been a ‘disposition’ 
by the hirer or buyer. This is defined by s. 29(1), from which it appears that a disposi-
tion includes a sale, a contract of sale and a letting under a hire-purchase agreement. 
These provisions are narrower than those of the Factors Act and the Sale of Goods Act 
in that the definition of ‘disposition’ is exhaustive, whereas under the other Acts any 
disposition is protected. This is, however, largely an academic point for ordinary vehicles 
are unlikely to be pledged, and the only other type of disposition which is likely to be 
encountered, namely the creation of a lien, would almost inevitably be in favour of a

trade or finance purchaser who would not be protected anyhow.239 In Rohit Kulkarni v 
Manor Credit (Davenham) Ltd,240 the contract with the private individual which qual-
ified as a disposition for the purposes of s.27 had been entered into before the car in 
question was acquired by the seller, who took it under a hire-purchase agreement entered 
into fraudulently. As the car in question was unascertained under the contract with the 
private individual, the Court of Appeal held that property did not pass until either after 
the car had been put into a deliverable state (once the registration plate had been affixed) 
or, alternatively, on delivery of the car. Therefore the relevant disposition did not occur 
until property was intended to pass under the contract, which was after the trader had 
entered into the hire-purchase agreement.
Finally, the purchaser must buy in good faith and without notice of the hire-purchase 
or conditional sale agreement. For this purpose, it is immaterial that the buyer may 
know that the vehicle was the subject of a hire-purchase agreement if he believes that the 
finance company has been paid off.241
Section 28 of the 1964 Act contains a number of elaborate presumptions to meet 
the not uncommon situation where a person in possession of a vehicle which was once 
the subject of an unfulfilled hire-purchase agreement does not know precisely what has 
happened to the vehicle before he acquired it.242 The net effect of these presumptions 
appears to be as follows. The onus of proof that the defendant (or an earlier purchaser) 
was himself a purchaser in good faith and without notice lies on the defendant. But once 
this has been proved, there appear to be only two ways in which the finance company 
will be able to establish its title against the defendant. One will be to show that the first 
private purchaser to acquire the vehicle was not a purchaser in good faith. If this can be 
established, then no subsequent purchaser can acquire a title under s. 27 even if he is 
himself in good faith. Secondly, the finance company may be able to establish that the 
vehicle was not in fact disposed of by the hirer at all, but was, for example, stolen from 
him, or was disposed of by someone who had obtained temporary control of the car 
with the hirer’s consent.
Writs of execution
Section 26 of the 1893 Act dealt with writs of execution such as fieri facias. It was 
concerned with the ability of a debtor to pass title to goods after a writ of execution 
has been issued with respect to those goods. It was thus dealing with matters in some 
respects similar to those involved in the exceptions to the nemo dat maxim. But the sec-
tion was not included in the 1979 consolidated version of the Sale of Goods Act, and it 
was subsequently repealed and replaced by s. 138 of the Supreme Court Act 1981. This 
seems to mark the recognition that the section is more appropriately dealt with in works 
on the enforcement of judgments, and it will therefore no longer be dealt with here.
239	 Similarly, the unusual transaction held to be a disposition in Worcester Works Finance Ltd v Cooden 
Engineering Co Ltd [1972] 1 QB 210 is unlikely to occur except in favour of a trade or finance purchaser.

Proposals for reform
There can be no doubt after the above discussion that the law relating to the transfer of 
title to goods is in a complex and confused state. It has been complained that ‘statutory 
protection for the bona fide purchaser has developed in a piecemeal and haphazard fash-
ion, and some of the relevant provisions have been so drafted and interpreted as to make 
their application depend not on principles of equity or justice but on fine technicalities 
which have little rhyme and less reason’.243 In his judgment in Ingram v Little,244 Devlin 
LJ, as he then was, suggested that it might be possible to apportion the loss which occurs 
when an innocent owner and an equally innocent bona fide purchaser are left to dispute 
over the title to goods after some dishonest middle party has quit the scene. The result of 
this suggestion was that the whole topic was referred to the Law Reform Committee.245 
The Committee in fact rejected Lord Devlin’s suggestion as impractical, largely because 
of the complications which would ensue where the goods pass through several hands. 
For example, a thief steals a car belonging to O and sells it to A, who sells to B, who 
resells to C, and so on. In such circumstances, there would be great difficulty in any sys-
tem of law which allowed apportionment of the loss: should apportionment be only as 
between O and A? Or between all the parties? And how should the loss be apportioned?	
The Committee did, however, go on to make a number of other recommendations for 
reform of the law. They rejected the notion of fundamental alteration in the law such as 
would prima facie protect any bona fide purchaser for value, but went on to propose the 
following detailed changes:
1	 The Committee recommended246 the abolition of the distinction between contracts 
void for mistake and contracts voidable for fraud. Hence, in cases like Cundy v Lind-
say247 and Ingram v Little,248 it would become immaterial whether the contract is void 
or voidable. In either event, the third party should be protected.249
2	 The Committee recommended250 reversal of the decision in Caldwell’s251 case: rescis-
sion of a voidable contract should require communication.	
3	 The third recommendation252 is that the dicta in the Newtons of  Wembley253 case 
should be reversed and s. 9 of the Factors Act amended to make it clear that it enables 
the buyer in possession to pass a good title without requiring him to act as a mercan-
tile agent.
4	 The Committee rejected the suggestion that any bailee should be able to pass a good 
title.254

Transfer of title by a non-owner	 341
5	 The Committee strongly criticised the market overt rule as ‘capricious’, and recom-
mended that the rule should be replaced by a wider protective provision applicable 
to a sale at any retail premises. As we have seen, however, this is not the path which 
Parliament saw fit to follow, as the effect of the Sale of Goods (Amendment) Act 1994 
is that bona fide purchasers do not acquire a good title.
Within the context of the existing law, the first three of these recommendations 
appear to be sensible and would have been unlikely to rouse much opposition, although 
some scepticism may be felt about whether the first recommendation would actually 
have achieved very much in practice. The fourth recommendation was more controver-
sial, but the fifth appears to have been the real stumbling block to the implementation 
of the Report. This recommendation raised fears that it would facilitate the disposal of 
stolen goods by underworld channels. Generally, the Report was a disappointing docu-
ment largely because of its complete failure to search for any empirical evidence as to 
the way in which the law operated.255 The continuing lack of this evidence makes it very 
difficult to justify positive proposals for change of a fundamental character. The most 
important question to which insufficient attention has usually been paid is the likelihood 
of the original owner of lost or stolen goods being protected by insurance.256 Where this 
is the normal situation, there seems good reason for giving greater protection under the 
law to bona fide purchasers than is done at present. A less drastic approach would, as 
a minimum, amalgamate some of the existing statutory provisions by reducing them to 
a common principle. Thus ss. 2, 8 and 9 of the Factors Act could well be replaced by a 
principle (along the lines of Art. 2-403 of the UCC) enabling any dealer to pass a title to 
goods which have been entrusted to his possession.
In 1976, the Scottish Law Commission produced some tentative proposals for con-
sideration.257 It suggested that the law should provide protection for bona fide onerous 
acquirers of another’s property, provided that the acquirer had taken possession in good 
faith and provided that the goods were not infected by a real vice resulting from involun-
tary dispossession of the owner (e.g., theft). The purchaser should have the onus of prov-
ing his own good faith, or facts from which it could be inferred, while the owner should 
be obliged to prove real vice. The basic principle would be to protect the good faith 
purchaser where the owner’s voluntary parting with possession had facilitated wrongful 
disposal. But these proposals did not even reach the status of a Law Commission Report, 
and there has been no legislation in Scotland.
A different, and in some ways far more radical, approach was advocated by the 
Crowther Committee on Consumer Credit.258 This Committee proposed that legislation, 
along the lines of Art. 9 of the American UCC should be enacted to cover all situations 
in which a security interest is reserved over goods, as a form of mortgage or charge, 
irrespective of its legal nature. Thus this legislation would replace (inter alia) the Bills 
of Sale Act 1882, s. 25 of the Sale of Goods Act and s. 9 of the Factors Act, and would 
also cover the post-Crowther development of the Romalpa reservation of title clauses.

Goode (1984) 100 LQR 234.

	342	 The effects of the contract
The basic idea behind such legislation is that the law should not differentiate between 
different types of transaction which have the same fundamental commercial purpose, 
merely because a different legal form has been adopted. To a considerable extent, this 
policy has already been adopted in the Consumer Credit Act, which was the first prod-
uct of the Crowther Committee recommendations. But the second major legislative 
development envisaged by the Committee – a new Lending and Security Act – remains to 
be enacted, and there is little sign at present of any action being taken on the most recent 
proposals.259 The legislation which the Committee, and the later DTI Green Paper,260 
envisaged would cover all agreements by which one person attempts to obtain an interest 
over goods by way of security, irrespective of the form of the agreement. This would thus 
cover hire-purchase agreements, sales under which title is reserved by the seller as a secu-
rity, bills of sale (which are not designed as outright sales) and other arrangements of a 
similar character.	
Such a law would, to some degree, regulate the rights of borrower and lender inter se, 
by providing, for instance, when and how the security rights of the lender could be exer-
cised, and what kind of limits might be imposed on the freedom of the parties to make 
their own contract, but more importantly, it would regulate the rights of the holder of 
the security as against third parties, in particular as against creditors of the borrower. 
It would also provide for some kind of registration system for certain sorts of security. 
Legislation along these lines would not replace all the provisions of the Sale of Goods 
Act dealing with the transfer of title – for instance, s. 24 of the Act (sales by seller in 
possession) and s. 23 (sale under voidable title) would not necessarily be encompassed 
within such legislation, nor would s. 2 of the Factors Act. But many other provisions 
dealt with above would fall within the scope of such a new law. The recent huge growth 
of reservation of title clauses in commercial sales is rendering reform a matter of some 
urgency.261 Again, it is possible that further developments in this area will be initiated 
from Brussels.262

Export sales

Export sales
The sale of goods which are to be shipped to their destination gives rise to a host of 
difficult questions, adequate discussion of which would require a whole volume1 and 
is therefore beyond the scope of this work, but because the Sale of Goods Act contains 
provisions relevant to these transactions the main types of export contract, the problems 
raised by export and import licences, and payment by bankers’ commercial credits will 
be considered in this chapter. The main provisions of the UN Convention on Contracts 
for the International Sale of Goods (‘CISG’) will also be considered in the next chapter. 
First, four types of contract will be considered, the central two being contracts whose 
essential terms have become standardised by commercial practice, although there is 
considerable variation in their detail. These four are ex-works contracts, f.o.b. contracts, 
c.i.f. contracts and ex-ship contracts.2 Many export and import transactions are made 
subject to INCOTERMS.3 Where the parties have adopted these, the duties of the 
parties under a contract on these terms are clearly spelled out. The rules of the common 
law set out below apply in the absence of such specific agreement.
Care must be taken not to assume that a contract which is said to be an ex-works 
contract, or a c.i.f. or f.o.b. contract, necessarily carries all the incidents which may be 
associated with these contracts in the absence of a contrary intention. Terms of this kind 
are often used by businessmen in agreements which contain other terms inconsistent 
with any such possibility. As was said by Roskill LJ in The Albazero:4
It is a trite observation that what is sometimes called a true f.o.b. or a true c.i.f. contract is a 
comparative commercial rarity. Contracts vary infinitely according to the wishes of the parties 
to them. Though a contract may include the letters f.o.b. or c.i.f. amongst its terms, it may well 
be that other terms of the contract clearly show that the use of those letters is intended to do 
no more than show where the incidence of liability for freight or insurance will lie as between 
buyer and seller, but is not to denote the mode of performance of the seller’s obligations to the 
buyer or the buyer’s obligations to the seller. In other cases, though the letters c.i.f. are used, 
other terms of the contract may show that the property is intended to pass on shipment and 
not upon tender of and payment against the documents so tendered, or though the letters f.o.b. 
are used, other terms may show that the property was not intended to pass on shipment but 
upon tender and payment, the seller by the form in which he took the bill of lading intending to 
reserve his right of disposal until he was paid against the shipping documents.

It should be noted that in American practice, the term f.o.b. is used as a shipment 
and as a destination term.5 It is also used in relation to carriage by ‘vessel, car or other 
vehicle’.6
Ex-works or ex-store contracts
Ex-works or ex-store contracts present few difficulties in this connection. In fact, 
these can hardly be considered as export sales at all, since it is the buyer’s duty to 
take delivery at the works or store in question, and what he does with them after that 
is entirely his own affair. The property and risk will, in the absence of any contrary 
indication, pass when the goods are delivered in most contracts of this kind, since they 
are almost invariably sales of unascertained goods and it is unlikely that there will be 
any appropriation (except perhaps where provision is made for inspection at an early 
date) prior to delivery.
F.o.b. contracts
In an f.o.b. contract, the seller’s duty is to place the goods free on board a ship to be 
named by the buyer during the contractual shipment period. Prima facie at least it seems 
that ‘The expression f.o.b. determines how the goods shall be delivered, how much of 
the expense shall be borne by the sellers and when the risk of loss or damage shall pass 
to the buyers. It does not necessarily decide when the property is to pass.’7 The seller’s 
obligations extend to all charges incurred before shipment, including loading charges, 
but not freight or insurance.
In the absence of a contrary intention, the buyer has the right and the responsibility 
of selecting both the port and the date of, and generally making the arrangements for, 
the shipment of the goods.8 He must nominate a ship on which the goods may be loaded 
by the seller and give adequate notice to the seller of that nomination. The ship must 
be an ‘effective’ ship that is capable, both physically and otherwise, of receiving the 
cargo.9 If the buyer nominates a ship which cannot receive the cargo or which cannot 
load in time, he may, if he still has sufficient time, substitute another vessel in place of 
the one first nominated.10 Where the contract provides for a range of ports from which 
the goods are to be shipped, it is the buyer’s right and duty to select one out of the 
permitted number of ports and to give the seller sufficient notice of his selection.11 On 
receiving the necessary notices from the buyer, the seller must be ready to ship the goods

within a reasonable time (which must also be within the contractual time for shipment), 
but he does not necessarily have to have the goods available for immediate shipment.12 
Compliance with the obligation to ship at the port nominated is a condition of the 
contract.13 On the other hand, if the nomination is subject to acceptance by the terminal 
operator, the duty of the seller to obtain this acceptance is an innominate term,14 but 
failure to fulfil it timeously will be a ground for repudiation by the buyer.15
The type of transaction described above is sometimes known as the ‘classic’ f.o.b. 
contract.16 A second type of f.o.b. is a variant on this: the seller arranges for the ship 
to come on berth, but the legal incidents are the same. In these two types of f.o.b. 
transaction, the buyer is not a party to the contract of carriage. A third type is where 
the seller puts the goods on board, takes a mate’s receipt and gives this to the buyer or 
his agent who then takes a bill of lading. In this latter type, the buyer is a party to the 
contract of carriage ab initio.17 The significance of the buyer being, or not being, a party 
to the contract of carriage is explained below.18
The time of delivery in an f.o.b. contract binds the buyer as much as the seller. As 
was said by Donaldson J in Bunge & Co Ltd v Tradax England Ltd,19 ‘Under an f.o.b. 
contract, the obligation to deliver and the obligation to accept delivery are mutual and 
both are confined to the shipment period.’20 The ship nominated by the buyer must 
arrive in time to load the goods, having regard to holidays and normal working hours.
In the ‘classic’ f.o.b. contract, the contract for the carriage of the goods is made 
between the seller and the shipowners. In modern times, however, as noted above, 
there are variants. In particular, it is nowadays very common for the seller to be 
required to make some or all of the arrangements for shipping and insuring the 
goods, particularly where the seller is an exporter,21 or where small parcels rather 
than whole cargoes are being shipped.22 Where the seller is making the shipping 
arrangements he normally obtains a mate’s receipt, which he transmits to the buyer 
who exchanges this for the bill of lading. Hence, there may be no privity of contract 
between sellers and shipowners; this may cause difficulty where goods are damaged 
in the course of loading by the shipowners before property and risk have passed to 
the buyers.23

21	 An f.o.b. sale, though contemplating the export of the goods, is not necessarily an export contract itself, 
but may be made between parties carrying on business in the same country. For example, a company which 
has contracted to sell goods to a foreign buyer may itself buy goods in order to fulfil that contract, f.o.b. an 
English port. In that case the first sellers will not be exporters.

The Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 does not affect this situation because contracts for the 
carriage of goods by sea under a bill of lading etc. are excluded from the Act’s application – s. 6(5) and (6).

	348	 Export sales
Seller’s duties as to contract of carriage
Because it is the seller who makes the contract for the carriage of the goods with the 
shipowner in the ‘classic’ f.o.b. contract, he must comply with s. 32(2) of the Act. This 
provides:
Unless otherwise authorized by the buyer, the seller must make such contract with the carrier 
on behalf of the buyer as may be reasonable having regard to the nature of the goods and 
the other circumstances of the case and if the seller omits to do so, and the goods are lost or 
damaged in course of transit, the buyer may decline to treat the delivery to the carrier as a 
delivery to himself, or may hold the seller responsible in damages.
In other words, if this subsection applies the buyer can either reject the goods or 
accept them and claim damages. It may be observed that this differs from the provisions 
of s. 20(2), which are in certain respects parallel to this provision. Under the present 
subsection, it appears that the buyer’s remedies for the damage to or loss of the goods 
operate whether or not the loss or damage was the consequence of the seller’s failure to 
make a reasonable contract with the carrier, whereas under s. 20 if either party is at fault 
in taking delivery of the goods, the goods are at the risk of the party in fault, but only in 
respect of damage which might not have occurred but for such fault.
What is a ‘reasonable’ contract for the seller to make must be judged in the light of 
the circumstances existing when the contract of carriage is made and not at the date of 
the contract of sale.24 Thus, a contract to carry the goods by an unusual route may be 
reasonable if the more usual route is unavailable when the contract of carriage is made.25
A simple illustration of the workings of s. 32(2) is provided by Thomas Young & 
Sons Ltd v Hobson & Partners,26 where goods were damaged in transit owing to their 
being insecurely fixed. Had the sellers made a reasonable contract with the carriers, that 
is, had they sent the goods at the company’s risk as was the usual practice for goods of 
that kind instead of at the owner’s risk, the loss would not have occurred. The Court 
of Appeal held that the buyers were entitled to reject the goods. On the other hand, in 
a later decision (on a c.i.f. contract) it was held that the seller was under no obligation 
to make a contract for the carriage of oil of an unusual kind providing that the oil was 
to be heated en route; in fact such heating was not necessary for the kind and length of 
voyage contemplated, although in the event the oil suffered damage which would have 
been averted if it had been heated.27
Where the seller is responsible for shipping the goods, it may be an important question 
whether he does so on his own account as a principal or merely as agent of the buyer. In 
particular, if the seller ships as principal, the presumption against property passing on 
shipment is strong, whereas if he ships as agent, it is more likely that property will be 
held to pass on shipment.28 But apart from this crucial distinction, many other ancillary 
questions may turn on whether the seller acts as principal or agent in shipping the

goods. For example, if the seller is unable to secure shipping space despite all reasonable 
efforts, he would normally be liable for non-delivery if it was his duty as seller to arrange 
shipping,29 whereas he would not be so liable if he were required to arrange shipping as 
the buyer’s agent. And other issues may also turn on whether the seller ships as principal 
or as agent; for example, who is to bear any increase in shipping or insurance charges 
after the contract of sale is made, or whether the seller is entitled to charge commission 
on the contract of carriage.
Whether the seller acts as principal or agent in shipping the goods usually depends on 
whether the parties intend that the seller should retain the bill of lading as security for 
payment. If this is the intention of the parties, the presumption is that the seller is acting 
as principal. This in turn may be determined by the bill of lading itself. If it is made out 
in the seller’s name (i.e. if goods are deliverable to, or to the order of, the seller) then  
the seller is reserving a right of disposal which would suggest that he is acting as 
principal.
Of course, in the last resort everything depends on the terms of the particular contract 
and it must not be assumed that every f.o.b. contract is identical in the obligations 
imposed on the parties. It would, however, be very unusual for the property to pass 
before shipment in an f.o.b. contract,30 or for the risk not to pass on shipment.
Passing of risk and property
In this sort of f.o.b. contract, the almost universal rule is that risk passes on shipment – 
as soon as the goods are over the ship’s rail, and, if it should be material, the risk in 
each part of the cargo will pass as it crosses the ship’s rail.31 This is not because of any 
peculiarity of f.o.b. contracts but because in this type of contract the seller’s duty is to 
deliver the goods f.o.b. Once they are on board, the seller has delivered them to the buyer 
and it is natural that they should thereafter be at the buyer’s risk.32 However, so far as the 
exact point at which risk passes, two views are possible: one is that risk literally passes as 
the goods cross the ship’s rail, the other is that the risk passes when the goods are safely 
loaded on board the vessel.33
As regards the passing of property, the position is that prima facie property may 
also pass, like risk, on shipment. The loading of the goods may be an ‘unconditional 
appropriation’ which passes the property under s. 18, Rule 5. If the goods are loaded 
together with other goods of the same description so that an unconditional appropriation 
of the actual goods sold then takes place, but the goods subject to the contract are still 
unascertained, property cannot pass on shipment,34 but the risk will still do so.35

	350	 Export sales
In modern times, any general presumption that property passes with risk on shipment 
in an f.o.b. contract has probably largely disappeared. Although this may still sometimes 
be the case if the contract contains no contrary provision, the practice of treating the 
shipping documents as security for the payment of the price is now so well established 
in international sales that contractual terms requiring payment against (i.e. in exchange 
for) the shipping documents is probably the norm in f.o.b. contracts these days, just as 
much as in c.i.f. contracts where this practice may have first originated. Where payment 
is only to be made against documents, the seller will normally have himself named as the 
consignee in the bill of lading (i.e. the goods will be deliverable under the bill of lading 
to, or to the order of, the seller), so that s. 19(1) and (2) become relevant. Section 19(1) 
has already been set out above.36 Section 19(2) provides:
Where goods are shipped, and by the bill of lading the goods are deliverable to the order of the 
seller or his agent, the seller is prima facie to be taken to reserve the right of disposal.
This reservation of the right of disposal makes the appropriation conditional under  
s. 19(1) so that property does not pass until the condition is satisfied. It is clear that 
today there is nothing contrary to the nature of the f.o.b. contract in the seller doing this, 
and indeed, as already said, it is nowadays very common. The result is that the shipment 
is treated under s. 19 as only amounting to a conditional appropriation, the condition 
being that the seller must be paid before property passes.
But the terms of the bill of lading are only evidence of the intention of the parties. 
The fact that the bill of lading is taken in the seller’s name is not conclusive proof that 
the seller is shipping the goods as principal, or is reserving the right of disposal. There 
are cases where the seller does not want or need to keep the documents as security for 
the price, as where (for instance) seller and buyer are associated companies, or where the 
seller has agreed to grant the buyer credit. In such a case, the seller may in fact transfer 
the bill of lading to the buyer as soon as he receives it, which would probably indicate 
that he was acting as agent all along.37 And although the taking of the bill of lading 
in his own name by the seller prima facie indicates that the property does not pass on 
shipment, it does not follow that if the bill of lading is taken in the buyer’s name it must 
be held that the property does pass on shipment. The retention of the bill of lading by 
the seller may be inconsistent with an intention to pass the property until it is handed 
over.38
It must be stressed that even where property does not pass on shipment, the seller 
normally retains the property only as security for payment or, in modern times, as a 
means of obtaining bridging finance to cover the period of shipment.39 Hence, once the 
goods are shipped, the buyer has an interest in the goods so that the seller must transfer 
goods to the buyer from that shipment; if he transfers them to anyone else so that he 
cannot supply the buyer from that shipment, he breaks his contract with the buyer,

although today the seller will normally be able to pass a good title to the third party. But 
in the ordinary way, in the absence of privity of contract,40 the buyer cannot sue a third 
party (such as the carrier) in tort for damage to the goods where he had no property, or 
possessory interest, at the time the damage occurred.41 On the other hand, the seller may 
sue and recover damages for the full value of the loss to the amount permitted by the 
Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971,42 even though the seller himself had only a limited 
interest in the goods;43 any surplus will be held on trust for the buyer.44
The above analysis of the way the sections of the Sale of Goods Act fit in with modern 
commercial practice has been reaffirmed by the Court of Appeal, and applied even to 
a case in which the buyer had paid 80 per cent of the price by letter of credit before 
the goods were shipped.45 In such a case, although property does not pass under s. 19 
until the conditions imposed by the seller have been fulfilled, the buyer may nonetheless 
acquire an undivided share in the part of an identified bulk paid for under the Sale of 
Goods (Amendment) Act 1995.46
Seller’s duties as to insurance
It has already been seen that under s. 32(1), delivery to the carrier is prima facie deemed 
to be delivery to the buyer himself, but despite this it has been held that s. 32(3) applies 
to f.o.b. contracts. This subsection states that:
Unless otherwise agreed, where goods are sent by the seller to the buyer by a route involving sea 
transit, under circumstances in which it is usual to insure, the seller must give such notice to the 
buyer as may enable him to insure them during their sea transit, and if the seller fails to do so, 
the goods are at his risk during such sea transit.
The construction of this subsection was the subject of some widely differing views 
in the Court of Appeal in Wimble Sons & Co Ltd v Rosenberg & Sons,47 where the 
plaintiffs sold goods to the defendants f.o.b. Antwerp. The buyers sent instructions for 
shipping the goods, leaving it to the sellers to select the ship. The sellers shipped the 
goods, but did not insure and the cargo was lost at sea. Vaughan Williams and Buckley

42	 Giving effect to the Hague/Visby Rules. The Act applies to all shipments where the contract expressly, or by 
implication, provides for the issuance of a bill of lading or similar document of title. Its effect is to limit the 
carrier’s liability for loss or damage to a certain amount. Where there is no privity of contract, but the buyer 
is able to sue by virtue of ownership or a possessory title, it is believed that the limits would nevertheless 
apply under the rules developed in relation to the law of bailments – see Southcote’s Case (1601) 46 Co Rep 
86a; Gibbon v Payton (1769) 4 Burr 2298. The baroque complexity of this area of law is due to the over-

	352	 Export sales
LJJ agreed that s. 32(3) applied to f.o.b. contracts, differing from Hamilton LJ who 
thought it had no application at all to such contracts because the seller does not send 
the goods to the buyer but only puts them on the ship for dispatch to the buyer. The 
majority thought, however, that dispatch was something different from delivery and that 
the seller does dispatch or send the goods to the buyer although he only delivers them 
to the ship, and such delivery is deemed to be delivery to the buyer by s. 32(1). This was 
not the end of the disagreements because Buckley LJ thought that the sellers were not 
liable in this case since the buyers already had sufficient information to enable them to 
insure if they wished. They knew what the freight was, they knew the port of loading 
and they knew the port of discharge. The only information lacking was the name of the 
ship, which would not have prevented insurance. On the other hand, Vaughan Williams 
LJ thought that such a construction would destroy the efficacy of the section since it 
is always possible for the buyer to insure the goods by a general cover policy. However, 
Buckley LJ answered this fairly by pointing out that in this case the buyer had enough 
information to enable him to make a particular insurance, but he agreed that the mere 
fact that the buyer can take out a general cover policy would not prevent the operation 
of s. 32(3).
The net result of this case is that, though the subsection in theory applies to f.o.b. 
contracts, in practice it will rarely be of much importance because in most cases the 
buyer will already have enough information to insure the goods specifically.
Seller’s duties as to documents
Where a seller under an f.o.b. contract must tender documents, his duties are the same as 
a c.i.f. seller discussed in the following section. Thus, the tender must be made with all 
reasonable dispatch.48
C.i.f. contracts
The main features of a c.i.f. contract were summarised by Lord Wright in Smyth & Co 
Ltd v Bailey Son & Co Ltd:49
The contract in question here is of a type familiar in commerce, and is described as a c.i.f. 
contract. The initials indicate that the price is to include cost, insurance and freight. It is a type 
of contract which is more widely and more frequently in use than any other contract used for 
purposes of sea-borne commerce. An enormous number of transactions, in value amounting 
to untold sums, are carried out every year under c.i.f. contracts. The essential characteristics of 
this contract have often been described. The seller has to ship or acquire after that shipment the 
contract goods, as to which, if unascertained, he is generally required to give a notice of appro-
priation. On or after shipment, he has to obtain proper bills of lading and proper policies of 
insurance. He fulfils his contract by transferring the bills of lading and the policies to the buyer. 
As a general rule, he does so only against payment of the price, less the freight which the buyer 
has to pay. In the invoice which accompanies the tender of the documents on the ‘prompt’ –

that is, the date fixed for payment – the freight is deducted, for this reason. In this course of 
business, the general property remains in the seller until he transfers the bill of lading . . .
By mercantile law, the bills of lading are the symbols of the goods. The general property in 
the goods must be in the seller if he is to be able to pledge them. The whole system of com-mer-
cial credits depends upon the seller’s ability to give a charge on the goods and the policies of 
insurance.50
Seller’s duties in c.i.f. contract
The seller’s duties in a c.i.f. contract, as summarised in the above passage, relate to 
the following matters. First, he must ship the goods or buy goods already shipped. It 
would not be very common nowadays for a c.i.f. seller to buy goods afloat and in the 
great majority of cases the seller either already has the goods or himself buys them for 
shipment.51 Stipulations as to the time and place of shipment as specified in the contract 
must be strictly complied with and are almost always treated as conditions.52 Delay of 
even one day in shipping the goods will justify rejection by the buyer. Indeed, the buyer 
is equally justified in rejecting the goods if they are shipped too soon.53 The seller must 
also insure the goods at his own expense.
Secondly, the seller must make a contract for the carriage of the goods to, and for their 
delivery at, the c.i.f. destination. Thirdly, the seller must, with all reasonable dispatch,54 tender 
to the buyer proper shipping documents. These comprise (1) the seller’s invoice for the price, 
(2) the bill of lading and (3) an insurance policy covering the goods against marine risks. 
The most essential feature of the bill of lading is the requirement that it should evidence a 
contract for the carriage of the goods to the agreed port of discharge.55 The bill of lading and 
the insurance policy are, in a commercial sense, the buyer’s guarantee that he will receive the 
goods in due course or, if they are lost or damaged, that he will have recourse either against 
the shipowners or against the insurers. Recourse against the shipowners is now secured by 
the transfer to the buyer of the contract of carriage under the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 
1992.56 Generally, the buyer must pay the price in exchange for these shipping documents. But 
50	 In one respect Lord Wright’s speech differs from the judgment of Kennedy LJ in Biddell v E Clemens 
Horst [1911] 1 KB 934, 956 (the locus classicus) because Kennedy LJ thought that the property passed on 
shipment, conditionally or unconditionally, but according to the modern view, expressed by Lord Wright, 
property does not pass until the bill of lading is transferred.
51	 This has been recognised by decisions holding that a force majeure clause can often be invoked where actual 
shipment is prohibited, even though in theory the seller might still be able to buy goods afloat – see Tradax 
Export SA v André & Cie SA [1976] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 416, approved in Bremer v Vanden Avenne [1978] 2 
Lloyd’s Rep 109, 114 per Lord Wilberforce. But a seller may still be expected to buy afloat where he is 
a trader rather than a shipper, and the contemplation of the parties was that he would buy from other 
suppliers before or after shipment: Bunge SA v Deutsche Conti [1979] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 435; André et Cie v 
Tradax Export [1983] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 254.

54	 Where the contract requires the buyer to pay against documents within so many days of the bill of lading, 
the seller is under a correlative duty to deliver the shipping documents within this period: Toepfer v

56	 This Act implements the recommendations of the Law Commission No. 196. By s. 2 the rights of suit under 
the contract of carriage contained in or evidenced by the bill of lading are to be transferred to or vested in 
the lawful holder of a bill of lading, by virtue of his having become the lawful holder of the bill so that the 
holder can sue on the contract as if he had been a party to it. The Act repealed the Bills of Lading Act 1855. 

	354	 Export sales
in practice, as we shall see more fully in Chapter 24, payment will often be made through a 
bank by means of a letter of credit, and the documents are in this case sent to a bank and not 
to the buyer direct.
Non-conforming documents
The shipping documents are therefore very important commercial and legal documents, 
because buyers pay the price in exchange for the documents, long before they receive the 
goods. Similarly, where the price is payable by letter of credit, banks will pay in exchange 
for the documents, thereby treating the documents as security for the money they advance. 
It is thus of critical importance that the documents be accurate, and that they comply with 
the terms of the contract. In practice, documents very often do not so comply, and this is an 
extremely common source of commercial and legal difficulty. If buyers and banks always 
rejected non-complying documents, international trade would probably grind to a halt, but 
many of the instances of non-compliance are trivial or technical and do not lead to rejection. 
If at a later date the buyer decides that he wants to reject after all, there will often be 
arguments about waiver and estoppel, which we discussed earlier.57 Where it is banks who in 
the first instance discover discrepancies in the documents, they often inform their buyers and 
act on their instructions. Sometimes, where the discrepancies appear particularly doubtful 
or technical, the bank may accept the documents in return for an indemnity, that is, an 
undertaking to repay any moneys advanced and make good any loss if the buyer (or another 
bank on whose behalf the bank accepts the documents)58 should then reject the documents.
Dating of the bill of lading
A point of critical importance in commercial practice, and also in law, is that the bill of lading 
must be correctly dated. The date on the bill of lading recording when the goods have been 
shipped is the buyer’s guarantee that shipment has occurred during the contractual shipment 
period. It is a separate breach of contract for the seller to tender to the buyer incorrectly 
dated bills of lading, so that (in theory, and indeed for some purposes in practice also) the 
seller commits two breaches by shipping the goods late and then procuring misdated bills 
of lading. Regrettably, bills of lading are often misdated (with the connivance of shipping 
companies or shipping agents) in order to conceal the fact that the goods were shipped 
outside the contract period,59 and this practice often gives rise to legal difficulties, especially 
where the buyer does not discover the incorrect dating until much later.
That Act required property in the goods to pass ‘upon or by reason of . . . consignment or indorsement [of 
the goods or bill of lading]’. This gave rise to difficulty where the property passed either before or after these 
events – see, e.g., The Aliakmon [1986] AC 785, p. 332 et seq above. The 1992 Act also confers rights of suit 
to a person to whom goods are to be delivered under a sea waybill – such documents are not transferred and 
do not have to be presented in order to obtain delivery of the goods.

58	 See Chapter 16.
59	 See the judgment of Kerr LJ in Procter & Gamble Philippine Manufacturing Corp v Kurt A Becher GmbH 
[1988] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 21, where it is said that bills of lading dated on the last date of the month are often 
viewed with suspicion by lawyers because of the probability that they have been ante-dated so as to make it 
appear that goods have been shipped during a contractual shipping period.

	
	 	
Export sales	 355
The present law is very strict in its requirements about the date of shipment, and the 
dating of the bills of lading, and this sometimes seems to encourage an over-technical 
approach to commercial matters. Buyers are sometimes enabled by these rules to reject 
documents or goods on the grounds of late shipment by a bare day or two, even where 
no loss has been caused thereby, but (for instance) the market has fallen significantly 
since the contract was made. On the other hand, it is not always a mere technicality 
that the law gives the buyer the right to insist on correctly dated bills of lading. The 
value of bills of lading may well depend upon the date of shipment shown because, for 
example, this may indicate the probable date of arrival, and in a rapidly moving market 
this may be a matter of importance.60 Moreover, in the hands of an innocent third party, 
a backdated bill is valid and the bank must pay against its presentation on a confirmed 
documentary credit.61
Contract of carriage
Section 32(2), which has been set out above,62 also applies to c.i.f. contracts. This section 
requires the seller to make a ‘reasonable’ contract with the shipowner. It has already 
been seen that what is reasonable must be judged at the time the contract of carriage is 
made and not when the contract of sale is made.63 So far as c.i.f. contracts are concerned, 
one of the most important requirements of a ‘reasonable’ shipping contract is that it 
should give the buyer a right of action against the shipping company for loss or damage 
to the goods throughout the whole period of the voyage.64 This means that if the goods 
have to be transhipped, the first shipowner (who contracts with the seller and will be 
liable to the buyer when the documents are transferred to him) must accept liability for 
the defaults of subsequent shipowners who will not be in privity with the sellers nor, 
therefore, with the buyers. But this may no longer be true in practice because most bills 
of lading today exonerate the shipowner from liability after transhipment, and if these 
are the only available bills of lading the seller is entitled to ship on those terms.65
It follows from the nature of a c.i.f. contract that s. 32(3) does not apply because there 
is always an express agreement as to the insurance of the goods. This is still the case even 
if special circumstances occur as a result of which the ordinary insurance cover is not 
effective and it would be advisable to take out a special cover.66
Passing of property and risk
Although s. 32(1) states, as we have seen, that delivery to a carrier is prima facie deemed 
to be delivery to the buyer, this has no application to c.i.f. contracts in which delivery 
60	 The price may be calculated by reference to the bill of lading, and if the price falls between the date of the 
bill of lading and the true date of shipment, the buyer will pay more than he legally should – see Rudolph A

of the goods to the buyer occurs when, but not before, the documents are handed over. 
The peculiar feature of c.i.f. contracts has always been the importance attached to the 
shipping documents, delivery of which transfers the property in, and the possession of, 
the goods to the transferee. The seller’s duty to deliver the goods in these cases means 
only that he must deliver the documents, for even if the goods are lost at sea the seller 
can still insist on payment of the price in return for the documents.67 Indeed, the position 
is the same if the goods are damaged after loading and are discharged before the ship 
sails, and even before the bill of lading is issued.68 But ‘that does not mean that a c.i.f. 
contract is a sale of documents and not of goods. It contemplates the transfer of actual 
and conforming[69] goods in the normal course. If the goods are lost, the insurance 
policy and bill of lading contract – that is, the rights under them – are taken to be, in a 
business sense, the equivalent of the goods.’70 Moreover, a seller does not fulfil his duty 
by delivering a bill of lading which is regular on its face if, in fact, no goods have ever 
been shipped. Thus, where a seller in good faith bought goods afloat and was given a bill 
of lading, apparently in order, and proceeded to sell the goods c.i.f. to another buyer, he 
was held in breach of contract when it was discovered that there were no goods.71
Not only does a transfer of a bill of lading transfer the property and the possession 
in the goods, but a pledge of the documents also operates as a pledge of the goods 
although this is not generally true of documents of title. This transferability is of crucial 
importance both in law and in practice. Indeed, negotiability (in this sense) is of the 
very essence of a bill of lading. A non-negotiable document is not strictly speaking a bill 
of lading at all.72 But a bill of lading is not a negotiable instrument in the sense that a 
bill of exchange is, so a transferee of a bill of lading does not get a better title than the 
transferor.73
In c.i.f. contracts the risk once again passes on shipment, and if the goods are lost at 
sea the buyer is still bound to pay the price, although he will as a rule have the benefit 
of the insurance policy. The law is the same even if the seller knows that the goods have 
been lost when he tenders the shipping documents.74 So also, the inability of the buyer 
to have the goods discharged at the port of destination (because, for instance, he cannot 
obtain an import licence) is of no concern to the seller, and cannot be a frustrating 
event.75 The delivery of the goods on board the vessel, followed by the delivery of correct 
documents, is a complete performance by the seller of his duties under a c.i.f. contract; 
what happens after that is of no concern to him, subject to some special cases (for 
instance, where goods are shipped in an undivided bulk).76
At one time, c.i.f. contracts differed fundamentally from f.o.b. contracts with regard 
to the time at which property passes, although today the tendency may well be for f.o.b.

contracts to be treated in the same way as c.i.f. contracts.77 At any rate, in c.i.f. contracts, 
it is quite clear that the general rule, which is not easily displaced,78 is that the property 
only passes when the documents are transferred and paid for.79 Where the bill of lading is 
taken in the seller’s name, this accords with s. 18 and s. 19(1) and (2) which have already 
been discussed. Where, contrary to the usual practice, the bill is taken in the buyer’s 
name, the prima facie rule is that delivery to the carrier is deemed to be an unconditional 
appropriation,80 but this presumption is rebutted by the very nature of the c.i.f. contract. 
Under s. 19(3), which has been set out above,81 it is expressly provided that if the seller 
sends a bill of exchange to the buyer with the shipping documents, the property does 
not pass unless the buyer accepts the bill of exchange. Even if the seller draws a bill of 
exchange on the buyer and discounts it with a bank before it has been accepted by the 
buyer, the property will still not pass. Although the seller may obtain payment in this 
way, he remains under a secondary liability as drawer of the bill of exchange and so 
property remains in him as security for this contingency.82 Indeed, even when the seller 
has received the full price in advance there may be special circumstances which give 
him some interest in retaining the property and it may be held that the transfer of the 
documents remains necessary to pass property.83
There have been a few unusual cases in which property has been held to pass in a 
c.i.f. contract at some other time than the transfer of documents. For instance, where 
the relationship between the parties was such that the seller was not concerned over 
the immediate payment of the price, then the property was held to pass on shipment 
or at latest on transfer of the bill of lading, even though no price was then paid. In 
The Albazero,84 the sellers and buyers were both companies which were members 
of one corporate group, and the sale was not a genuine arm’s length transaction. It 
was held that property passed on the posting of the bill of lading. Conversely, where 
a seller sold goods ‘c.i.f.’ but it was intended that he should store the goods in his 
warehouse and make deliveries as required, payment being made only after the goods 
left the warehouse, it was held that property had not passed prior to delivery of bills 
of lading.85 This was plainly an unusual case in that the goods were imported by 
the seller but were not intended for immediate delivery, so it was hardly an ordinary 
c.i.f. contract.
Another case where property did not pass under a c.i.f. contract on transfer of the 
bill of lading is the case of the sale of an undivided share of goods carried in bulk. If 
a seller sold 5,000 tons of a cargo of wheat which totals 10,000 tons, the mere transfer

78	 See, e.g., Cheetham & Co Ltd v Thornham Spinning Co Ltd [1964] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 17 (property held to 
have been retained by sellers even after the goods had been deposited in the buyers’ warehouse, sellers not 
having been paid, and having retained bill of lading). A similar case is Ginzberg v Barrow Haematite Steel 
Co Ltd [1966] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 343; and so also in The Aliakmon [1986] AC 785, the variation of the original 
c.&f. contract led to the same result – the buyers took possession but only as agents of the sellers, pending 
payment.

of bills of lading for 5,000 tons could not pass the property because of s. 16 of the Sale 
of Goods Act which requires the goods to be ascertained before property can pass.86 
In such a case, however, the buyer can now acquire an individual share in the bulk,87 
and the property in the whole subject-matter of the contract will probably pass when 
the goods are discharged from the ship and appropriated to the particular contract in 
some way. Such a contract differs in various respects from an ordinary c.i.f. contract 
and indeed comes to resemble an ex-ship contract in that the seller must deliver the 
goods at the port of destination. If he procures the ship carrying the cargo to be 
directed elsewhere and the goods are unloaded there, he is therefore guilty of a breach 
of contract.88 In an ordinary c.i.f. contract, however, any action of the seller to divert 
the ship and cargo after the goods are loaded and the documents delivered would not 
be a breach of the contract of sale; it might possibly involve a breach of the contract 
of carriage by the carrier, and the seller could conceivably be liable in tort, but he 
would have performed the contract of sale and so could not be liable for breach of that 
contract.89
In modern times, a new problem has occasionally surfaced as a result of which 
property may pass at some other time than the transfer of the documents. This 
problem is that bills of lading are sometimes very late in being issued, and cargoes 
nowadays sometimes arrive before the bills of lading are ready for transfer to the 
buyer. When this happens, the seller may instruct the carrier to deliver the goods 
to the buyer without the production of bills of lading (agreeing to indemnify the 
carrier in case any holder of the bills of lading turns up with a right to demand the 
goods); of course, the terms on which the seller is willing to do this will depend on 
his arrangements with the buyer – he may agree to give the instructions to the carrier 
only in return for payment if the contract was originally for cash against documents. 
If the goods are delivered to the buyer in this way, property will then pass to him,90 
in the absence of some express stipulation by the seller whereby he retains property 
despite the delivery.
As we saw in the quotation from Lord Wright’s speech in Smyth & Co Ltd v Bailey 
Son & Co Ltd, in the sale of unascertained goods c.i.f. the seller is often under a duty 
to give notice of appropriation to the buyer, but this ‘is not intended to pass and does 
not pass the property’.91 The reason for this is that the notice is not an ‘unconditional’ 
appropriation within the meaning of s. 18, Rule 5. It is conditional on the buyer taking 
up the documents and paying for the goods. The effect of such a notice of appropriation 
may be to convert the sale into one for specific or ascertained goods, so that it would

this case was a c.i.f., but this is immaterial to the point about the passing of property, which was to occur 
on unloading. This had the effect that on unloading, the bills of lading ceased to be effective as transferable 
documents of title, and the sub-buyers, having no contract with the carriers, could not sue them for a 
shortfall in the quantity delivered.

thereafter be a breach of contract for the seller to deliver any other goods.92 Otherwise,  
if the goods still form part of a bulk, the effect is that it will commit the seller to 
delivering goods from that bulk.
Variants on c.i.f. contracts
One very common variant of the c.i.f. contract is the c.&f. contract, in which the buyer 
arranges his own insurance, but in other respects the shipping arrangements are made by 
the seller, and, once again, property usually passes when the documents are transferred 
in exchange for payment of the price. Another example is the c.i.p. (carriage insurance 
paid, or ‘free on motor’ contract under which the seller pays all costs until the goods are 
loaded onto the road transport vehicle after shipment is complete.92A
Buyer’s duties
The duties of the buyer under a c.i.f. contract are to accept the shipping documents 
when tendered and to pay the contract price in exchange for the documents. Frequently, 
the price is payable by means of a letter of credit, in which case the documents are sent 
to a bank in the first instance, and the bank then passes the documents to the buyer, 
in exchange for payment or for some other method of satisfaction. Sometimes several 
banks are involved, and the documents are transferred from one to another, ultimately 
ending up with the buyer.
Sometimes, the buyer is under a contractual duty to nominate a discharge port 
because the c.i.f. contract may not have originally specified a single port as the c.i.f. 
port, but may have envisaged a range of ports (e.g., any port in Italy), leaving the buyer 
to select the particular port at a later date. In this situation, the buyer must obviously 
make his nomination in sufficient time for the vessel to sail to the port specified without 
interruption or delay.93
Ex-ship contracts
In ex-ship contracts ‘the seller has to cause delivery to be made to the buyer from a ship 
which has arrived at the port of delivery and has reached a place therein, which is usual 
for the delivery of goods of the kind in question’.94 In other words, the seller really is 
under an obligation to deliver the goods to the buyer at the port of discharge in ex-ship 
contracts, and the buyer has no concern with the shipment itself. Section 32, therefore, 
has no application at all to this type of case. It also follows that if the seller fails to 
deliver the goods, the buyer is not liable for the price or, if he has paid it, he can recover 
it as on a total failure of consideration. Thus in Comptoir d’Achat et de Vente SA v Luis

the seller was paid).

de Ridder Limitada (The Julia),95 the plaintiffs bought a quantity of rye ‘c.i.f. Antwerp’, 
but the sellers retained the bill of lading and the insurance policy under the contract, 
and they also guaranteed the condition of the goods on arrival. It was held by the House 
of Lords that these terms were inconsistent with a true c.i.f. contract and that in fact the 
contract was for the sale and delivery of the goods ex-ship. Consequently, the seller’s 
failure to deliver the goods through the outbreak of war enabled the buyers to recover 
the price as on a total failure of consideration.
Generally speaking, in contracts of this kind the property and risk will only pass on 
delivery.
Export and import licences
Despite numerous treaties and trade agreements which seek to dismantle prohibitions 
some still remain and so the obtaining of an export or import licence, or both, is often a 
necessary prerequisite to the performance of a contract of sale. It is, therefore, a matter 
of considerable importance to decide which of the parties is to obtain the licence, and 
what happens if he fails to do so. As noted in the previous chapter, many export and 
import transactions are made subject to INCOTERMS. Where the parties have adopted 
these, the duties of the parties in this respect are clearly spelled out.96 These duties are 
not always in conformity with the rules of English law set out below, which apply in the 
absence of such specific agreement.
Whose duty?
The courts have refused to lay down any general principles on this question and have 
insisted that each case must be decided according to its own special circumstances.97 
Nevertheless, some indications may be gleaned from the cases to show the sort of 
considerations which the courts will treat as relevant. It goes without saying, of course, 
that if the parties have expressed a clear intention as to who is to apply for a licence or 
what is to happen if it is not obtained then the courts will give effect to that intention. 
The difficulties arise when the parties have not expressed any such clear intention.
In ex-works or ex-store contracts, it is hardly possible to doubt that in the absence of 
a contrary intention it is the buyer’s duty to obtain all necessary permits and licences. 
Indeed, one can go further and say that in such contracts the seller is not generally 
concerned with what the buyer does with the goods after he has taken delivery. Hence, 
in such cases the question of export and import licences will usually be irrelevant to the 
contract of sale.
At the other end of the scale, ex-ship contracts also do not give rise to much difficulty. 
In the absence of any contrary intention, it is plainly the seller’s duty to obtain any 
necessary export licence, but probably the buyer’s duty to obtain an import licence if 
required.

Export sales	 361
It is f.o.b. and c.i.f. contracts and their many variants which tend to give rise to the 
difficulties in this connection.98 So far as f.o.b. contracts are concerned, it was for long 
thought that, as a result of the decision of the Court of Appeal in H O Brandt & Co v  
H N Morris,99 the obligation to obtain an export licence was generally on the buyer.  
It is obvious that this would in many circumstances be a highly inconvenient conclusion. 
Fortunately, it appears from the decision of the House of Lords in A V Pound & Co 
Ltd v M W Hardy & Co Inc100 that Brandt’s case is not to be taken as laying down any 
general rule, and although the House refused to lay down any general rule itself, it is 
possible, without undue rashness, to say that prima facie in an f.o.b. contract the duty of 
obtaining the export licence is on the seller. A fortiori this is the case in a c.i.f. contract.
The points to which attention must be given in considering whether this is so in any 
particular case are, inter alia, the following. Is the seller exporting the goods from one 
country to the buyer in another, or are both parties carrying on business in the same 
country? The latter may, of course, be the position where the buyer is buying for export 
to a customer abroad, and hence himself buys the goods on f.o.b. or even c.i.f. terms. 
In this event, as in Brandt’s case, it is much easier to reach the conclusion that the duty 
to obtain an export licence is on the buyer because the seller is not himself selling the 
goods for export. It is the buyer who wants to export the goods and, naturally, therefore 
it is for him to obtain the licence. The case is quite different in the normal position 
where the seller is exporting the goods to the buyer, for if the buyer’s business is based 
in some country hundreds or thousands of miles away it would be unreasonable and 
impracticable to expect him to obtain the export licence.
Another point to consider is whether there are any particular circumstances rendering 
it easier for one party or the other to obtain the licence. If, for example, the buyer and 
seller are based in different countries, and only a member of a certain trade association 
may be granted an export licence,101 or if the licences are granted according to a quota 
system based on the seller’s previous shipments,102 it becomes virtually impossible to 
hold that the buyer must obtain the licence.
A third relevant factor is whether the need for a licence existed when the contract was 
made (and, if so, whether the parties knew about it) or whether the need for a licence 
was only imposed after the contract was made by new legislation or controls.
The duty of obtaining an import licence must plainly be on the importer, that is the 
buyer, in most circumstances, if only because the relevant statutory provisions will generally 
impose the duty on him, and, in the absence of a contrary intention, ‘the contract must 
be treated as made upon the assumption that the statutory law applicable . . . should be 
observed by the parties to the contract’.103 This is a fortiori the case in an f.o.b. sale for 
the seller may not even know the destination of the goods. Indeed, in many international 
contracts the ultimate destination of the goods is of no concern to the seller, who 
performs his contract by shipping the goods and delivering the requisite documents.

Thus, failure by the buyer to obtain any required import licences is solely a matter for 
the buyer, and it is probably even incorrect to regard the buyer as under a contractual 
duty to obtain such a licence.104
Whether duty absolute or to use best endeavours
When it has been decided whether the duty to obtain the necessary licence is on the 
buyer or the seller, the next question which may arise is whether the duty is absolute; 
that is, is the party in question to be taken to have warranted that he will obtain the 
licence, or only that he will use his best endeavours to do so? If the latter is the true 
position, a failure to obtain the licence despite such best endeavours will generally mean 
that the contract is frustrated. Alternatively, the party unable to obtain the licence may 
be excused by an express force majeure clause, in which case the contract simply fails, 
since the detailed provisions of a force majeure clause usually leave no room for the 
application of the common law.105
Where a licence is required throughout the period of shipment, the party whose duty 
it is to obtain the licence must not delay too long in making his application or he may be 
held to have failed to use due diligence to obtain one.106 On the other hand, the position 
is rather different where the need for a licence is only introduced during the shipment 
period. Here, the party who should obtain the licence cannot be blamed for not having 
acted before the requirement was introduced, and even though he might have shipped 
the goods then, he may still be excused by his later failure to obtain a licence.107
In Re Anglo-Russian Merchant Traders Ltd,108 the Court of Appeal held that generally 
speaking there is no absolute duty to obtain a licence, and that where a seller applies for 
and is refused an export licence, he is not generally liable in damages for non-delivery. 
In Peter Cassidy Seed Co Ltd v Osuustukkukauppa IL,109 Devlin J agreed with this as a 
general principle.
The person whose duty it is to apply for a licence may either warrant that he will get it, that is 
an absolute warranty, or he may warrant that he will use all due diligence in getting it. When 
nothing is said in the contract it is usually – probably almost invariably – the latter class of 
warranty which is implied, but each case must be decided according to its own circumstances, 
and the question of implication must be settled in the ordinary way in which implied terms are 
settled.110
But ultimately the learned judge held that in the particular circumstances of the case 
the sellers had warranted that they would obtain a licence. In this case, the contract 
stated: ‘Delivery: prompt as soon as export licence granted’ and the sellers had assured 
the buyers that this was a pure formality.

On the other hand, in Mitchell Cotts & Co (Middle East) Ltd v Hairco Ltd111 Scott 
LJ inclined to the view that the buyers’ duty to obtain a licence (in that case, an import 
licence) is generally absolute, and in Partabmull Rameshwar v K C Sethia Ltd112 the 
House of Lords held, on somewhat unusual facts, that the sellers had bound themselves 
to obtain an export licence.
Even an obligation by a party to use his best endeavours to obtain a licence is 
somewhat strictly applied by the courts. In Brauer & Co (Great Britain) Ltd v James 
Clark (Brush Materials) Ltd,113 for instance, sellers had agreed to sell goods for shipment 
f.o.b. a Brazilian port, ‘subject to any Brazilian export licence’. The sellers had applied 
for a licence, which was refused on the ground that the price was too low. On its 
appearing that the sellers might have obtained a licence if they had been prepared to 
pay the extra (some 20 per cent above the contract price) to their own suppliers, it was 
held that they had not used their best endeavours to obtain a licence. So too, a seller who 
contracts to ship from one of a number of ports is not excused if export from one only 
is prohibited, even though he may already have made all necessary arrangements to ship 
from that port.114 Where the seller is under a duty to apply for a licence, the buyer may 
nevertheless be bound to supply the seller with any information (e.g. as to the ultimate 
destination of the goods) which may be required by the licensing authority.115 Where a 
seller, who is under a duty to use his best endeavours, fails even to apply for a licence, 
he has the heavy burden of proving that any application was foredoomed to failure.116 
A party whose licence is revoked is in the same position as one whose application is 
refused.117
On the other hand, total suspension of a licensing system and the banning of all 
imports (or exports) is a different matter from the mere refusal of a licence, and even 
though a party may prima facie have warranted to obtain a licence, he may be more 
readily excused by a force majeure clause in this situation.118
There is, perhaps, something slightly misleading in talking of an implied warranty 
by a party to obtain, or to use his best endeavours to obtain, a licence. If there is no 
mention of the matter in the contract, then the true position is simply this. The seller 
is bound to deliver the goods to the buyer and the buyer is bound to take delivery from 
the seller. If either party will not or cannot perform his obligations he is prima facie in 
default, unless he can show that the contract has been frustrated. Often he can show 
that the contract has been frustrated by proving that a necessary licence has been 
refused despite his best endeavours to obtain one.119 But where the obligation to deliver

(or to take delivery) is construed as an absolute obligation, then the failure to obtain the 
licence does not excuse non-performance. Strictly speaking, therefore, it does not seem 
accurate to talk of a person warranting that ‘he will get a licence’ or that ‘he will use his 
best endeavours to get a licence’.
Bankers’ commercial credits
Payment of price by bankers’ commercial credit120
Where a person carrying on business in one country buys goods from a seller in 
another country, it is common practice for the price to be paid by means of a banker’s 
commercial credit. Such credits are also often referred to as documentary credits or 
letters of credit, but the terms are synonymous. The normal procedure is more or less as 
follows, although there may frequently be variations of detail.
The buyer instructs his own bank (the issuing bank) to open a credit in favour of 
the seller with a bank in the seller’s country (the ‘intermediary’ or ‘correspondent’ or 
‘confirming’ banker). Almost invariably, the buyer instructs the issuing bank that the 
seller is only to be allowed to draw on the credit on presentation to the paying bank of 
documents showing that the goods have been shipped and are on their way to the buyer. 
The shipping documents will comprise (at least) the seller’s invoice for the goods, the bill 
of lading and, frequently (always in c.i.f. contracts), an insurance policy or certificate. 
The intermediary banker will then notify the seller that instructions have been received 
to open a credit in his favour and will inform him of the precise terms on which he will 
be allowed to avail himself of the credit. As soon as the goods are shipped and the seller 
has received the necessary documents himself from the carriers or their agents and the 
insurers, he will present these documents together with his invoice to the intermediary 
banker. The bank will check the documents with the terms of the credit to ensure that 
the goods shipped are (so far as can be seen from the documents) the contract goods  
and that everything appears to be in order and, if satisfied that this is the case, will 
permit the seller to draw against the credit. This may be done by accepting a bill of 
exchange, or discounting a bill drawn on the buyer, or by making funds available in cash.
The intermediary bank will then transmit the documents to the issuing bank, which 
will likewise have to check the documents against the terms of the credit, and which 
will pay the intermediary bank if satisfied that all is in order. The issuing bank will 
then inform the buyer that the documents have been received, and will be transferred 
to him against payment. The buyer will also satisfy himself that the documents are in 
order and will, in due course, pay the issuing bank an amount corresponding to the price 
paid to the seller, together with the bank’s own charges. Of course the issuing bank may 
be providing credit to the buyer – that is a matter for the contract between them – in 
which case it will transmit the documents to him before receiving payment. Armed with 
the documents, the buyer will then be in a position to resell the goods and transfer the 
documents to a sub-buyer or, alternatively, to take delivery as soon as the goods arrive. 
120	 See generally Gutteridge and Megrah, The Law of Bankers’ Commercial Credits (ed. King, 8th edn, 2001, 
Taylor & Francis).

	
	 	
Export sales	 365
The holder of the documents is prima facie the person to whom the carrier will deliver 
the goods.
Virtually all bankers’ credits are today granted on the terms that they are to be 
governed by the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits, UCP, (and 
Supplement for Electronic Presentation) prepared by the International Chamber of 
Commerce.121 The banks of nearly all the countries in the world use this document 
(hereafter referred to as ‘the Uniform Customs’), which is, therefore, to all intents and 
purposes a part of the law of bankers’ commercial credits.122 But this document is not a 
statute, and should not be interpreted as such; for instance, reasonable implications can 
be read into the Uniform Customs.123
There are many variations in the forms of commercial credits, the principal distinctions 
being between revocable and irrevocable credits, and confirmed and unconfirmed credits. 
Under the Uniform Customs, an irrevocable credit constitutes a definite undertaking by the 
issuing bank that the credit will be made available if the seller complies with the stipulated 
conditions. A revocable credit does not constitute a definite undertaking by the issuing bank 
and may be cancelled or modified without notice until payment is made or documents 
accepted under the credit. The most recent iteration of the does not include revocable credits 
within its definition of a credit and given the marginal use of these in commerce (if they are 
used at all) they are now likely extinct in practice. The distinction between a confirmed and 
an unconfirmed credit turns upon whether or not the intermediary bank accepts a direct 
obligation to the seller to honour the credit. In the former event, the intermediary bank 
‘confirms’ the credit, that is undertakes (sometimes for an extra commission payable directly 
by the seller) to pay, whether or not it is put in funds by the issuing bank; in the latter event, 
the credit is unconfirmed, the intermediary bank merely informing the seller that the credit 
has been opened in his favour, and the seller will have no right of recourse against the bank in 
the event of its refusing to pay.
In the past, doubts have even existed as to whether the seller could sue the bank if it 
refused to honour a confirmed credit, anyhow prior to shipment, on the ground that there 
is no contract between seller and bank, owing to the absence of any consideration supplied 
by the seller. There is no difficulty when the goods have once been shipped because this is 
action by the seller in reliance on the bank’s undertaking, and that should suffice as a valid 
consideration by any modern test. But it is theoretically arguable that, if the bank repudiates 
the credit before shipment, the seller may be unable to enforce the letter of credit by direct 
action against the bank. In practice, banks never take this technical point and judicial 
pronouncements now seem to have put their liability beyond doubt.124
121	 The current version, UCP 600, formally commenced on 1 July 2007.
122	 Of course, there must be something to justify incorporation of the Uniform Customs in the contract, and 
this is usually done expressly, but a bare marginal note has been held sufficient to achieve this result: Forestal 
Mimosa Ltd v Oriental Credit Ltd [1986] 1 WLR 631.

Royal Bank of Canada [1983] 1 AC 168, 183 per Lord Diplock. Where applicable under choice of law rules 
(see p. 65 et seq.) the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 would also seem to give the seller a 
remedy. Where Scottish law is applicable, the seller will have a remedy under the jus quaesitum tertio.

	366	 Export sales
The vital element in this commercial machinery is that the seller must not be allowed to 
draw against the credit unless it is quite clear, so far as can be seen from an examination 
of the documents, that he has fulfilled his obligations under the contract. Hence, it is 
of the first importance that the buyer should inform the issuing bank precisely what 
documents are required.125 It is equally important that the documents presented by the 
seller to the intermediary bank should correspond exactly with the terms of the credit 
(which should, of course, represent the agreed terms of sale)126 for otherwise the bank 
will refuse payment, or if it pays, it does so at its peril because the buyer (or the issuing 
bank) may refuse to take up the documents.
In practice, minor discrepancies between the shipping documents and the letter of 
credit are a common problem. The bank to which the documents have been presented 
will often seek instructions from the buyer (or from an issuing bank) rather than 
immediately reject non-conforming documents, and very often the letter of credit will be 
amended, or the discrepancies will be waived. Although the bank is entitled thus to seek 
instructions it must act with reasonable dispatch, and must ultimately either accept or 
reject the documents.127
As we have seen, the main documents are the bill of lading, the invoice and any 
necessary insurance documents. The bill of lading must cover shipment from and 
to the agreed ports. It was for long a requirement that the bill of lading should 
be a ‘shipped’ bill of lading,128 that is, it had to acknowledge that the goods had 
actually been shipped and not merely received for shipment,129 but new types of 
commercial documentation (such as combined road and shipping documents) led 
to an abandonment of this requirement since Art. 27 of the 1994 version of the 
Uniform Customs (UCP500). But some letters of credit still require ‘shipped’ bills 
of lading.130
The invoice must describe the goods exactly as stated in the credit.131 It was formerly 
held that even the de minimis rule was excluded in this situation,132 but Art. 30 of the 
Uniform Customs permits a tolerance of 5 per cent more or less than the contract 
125	 See Arts 5, 14 and 22 of the Uniform Customs.
126	 But in practice it is not uncommon for additional contract terms to be spelled out in the letter of credit 
which were not in the original contract. The buyer who inserts such terms does so at his peril because 
the seller is under no duty to co-operate with him in filling in terms left uncertain in the original contract 
(Siporex Trade SA v Banque Indosuez [1986] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 146) and any new terms may lead to rejection 
of the letter of credit as inconsistent with the contract of sale. If the letter of credit is accepted, this may 
amount to a variation of the original sale contract (W J Alan & Co Ltd v El Nasr Export & Import Co 
[1972] 2 QB 189) or it may amount to a waiver or forbearance giving rise to an estoppel (Ficom SA v 
Sociedad Cadex [1980] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 118, 131).

131	 It was formerly held that even the bill of lading had to do this – see Rayner & Co Ltd v Hambro’s Bank 
Ltd [1943] KB 37. But under Art. 14(e) of the Uniform Customs, it is sufficient if the bill of lading describes 
the goods in general terms. The invoice is in effect a representation by the seller to the buyer of the very 
goods he has shipped, so it is natural that this is the document where the goods must be described in precise 
conformity with the contract.

quantity unless the credit stipulates to the contrary.133 In matters other than quantity 
the position still is that the de minimis rule does not apply.134 Generally, also, the 
credit requires ‘clean’ bills of lading, which means that the bill must ‘not contain any 
reservation as to the apparent good order or condition of the goods or the packing’.135
Where the documents are to include insurance policies, a certificate will not suffice 
unless, as is customary, the credit expressly says so. Additional documents are often 
required by the contract, such as certificates of quality, or the like, to be provided by 
independent third parties after inspection of the goods.
Provided that the documents presented by the seller are in order, he is entitled to avail 
himself of the credit notwithstanding that the buyer may have some complaint about 
the quality of the goods.136 The value of this method of payment would be considerably 
reduced if a claim by the buyer had the effect of preventing the seller from drawing on 
the credit. One of the principal purposes of a letter of credit is to assure the seller that 
he will be paid, leaving for later settlement and, if necessary, litigation any complaints 
by the buyer. A letter of credit thus throws the onus of litigation on to the buyer who 
must pay first and sue afterwards. As Lord Diplock put it in United City Merchants 
(Investments) Ltd v Royal Bank of Canada:
The whole commercial purpose for which the system of confirmed irrevocable documentary 
credits has been developed in international trade is to give the seller an assured right to be paid 
before he parts with control of the goods and that does not permit of any dispute with the 
buyer as to the performance of the contract of sale being used as a ground for non-payment or 
reduction or deferment of payment.137
This general policy gives rise to the fundamental principle expressed in Art. 4 of 
the Uniform Customs that banks ‘deal in documents and not in goods’. The bank 
is therefore expected to confine its attention to the documents and to examine them 
for regularity on their face. In the United City Merchants case (from which the above 
quotation comes), the shipping documents presented by the sellers misrepresented  
the date on which the goods had been shipped (though this was not in fact known to 
the sellers) and the bank became aware of this fact, but there was nothing on the face  
of the documents themselves to indicate that there was any irregularity. It was held that 
the bank must pay. The House of Lords, however, reserved the question whether the 
result would be the same if the documents were actually forged.
133	 This does not apply where the credit specifies quantity in terms of packing units or containers or individual 
items. Nor does it entitle the seller to draw more than the amount of the credit. It simply means that the 
bank will pay even if the seller ships up to 5 per cent more or less than the contract quantity. (The tolerance 
is extended to 10 per cent if the contract quantity is qualified by words such as ‘about’ or ‘circa’.) It remains 
the responsibility of the seller to draw the invoice for the correct amount shipped, of course.

136	 Hamzeh Malas & Sons v British Imex Industries Ltd [1958] 2 QB 127. In many cases the buyer will not even 
see the goods until the seller has obtained payment, so this question can hardly arise, but sometimes the 
buyer may have grounds for suspecting non-compliance even before he receives the goods, e.g., because of a 
previous shipment.

It is also well established that if the seller is guilty of actual fraud – if he knowingly 
presents documents which are false in some material respect, for instance – the bank is 
entitled to, indeed is under a duty to, refuse payment, even if the fraud is not apparent 
from the documents themselves: this also was accepted as settled law in the United City 
Merchants case. But the fraud must be clearly proved and a bank which has actually 
paid under the letter of credit against conforming documents cannot be refused 
reimbursement unless it is also shown that the bank had clear knowledge of the fraud.138
Where fraud can be established, the buyer may be able to obtain an injunction to 
restrain his own bank from paying under the letter of credit, or to restrain the seller 
from drawing under it.139 Courts are, however, very reluctant to grant injunctions – 
even interim injunctions – to restrain banks from honouring their letters of credit, and 
a strong case must be made for an injunction against the bank itself. There are also 
difficulties in getting an injunction against a bank with which the buyer has no direct 
dealings, even though the documents, and the duty to make payment, will eventually 
be passed down the line to him.140 Moreover, an injunction is unlikely to be granted to 
restrain an issuing bank from paying a confirming bank, where the confirming bank 
has already paid the seller in good faith and looks to the issuing bank for an indemnity 
under the issuing bank’s own obligations, unless it is apparent that the confirming bank 
has paid on non-conforming documents, or that it had clear knowledge of fraud by the 
seller.
From the legal point of view, a commercial credit as described above involves a pledge 
of the documents by the seller to the paying bank which is, in due course, transferred 
to the issuing bank. In the normal course of events, the pledge is discharged when the 
buyer takes up the documents and pays off the bank. If, however, something should go 
wrong in the performance of the contract; for example, if the buyer should become 
insolvent, the bank is in a position to enforce and realise its security, if necessary through 
its possession of the documents. One result of this commercial machinery has been to 
reduce the importance of the seller’s right of stoppage in transit because if the buyer 
becomes insolvent there is no fear that he will obtain the goods since he has not got the 
necessary documents, and will not be able to get them except on paying the bank.
Although, in an ordinary contract of sale of goods, delivery and payment are 
concurrent conditions, in contracts in which the price is to be paid by means of a 
commercial credit ‘the seller is entitled, before he ships the goods, to be assured that, 
on shipment, he will get paid’.141 So where the contract specifies the time during which 
the letter of credit must be opened, there is a strong presumption that that time limit is

a condition, and failure to comply justifies immediate repudiation by the seller.142 Where 
no time is specified in the contract the credit must (in the absence of some contrary 
indication143) be opened by the buyer a reasonable time before the beginning of the 
shipment period,144 even if the seller has some weeks or even months in which to ship, 
and does not in fact ship until the end of the period. This is still the case, even where the 
contract is on f.o.b. terms in which the buyer is entitled to fix the date of shipment.145 
The seller cannot, of course, draw against the credit until the goods are shipped because  
the presentation of the shipping documents is a condition precedent to his right to use the 
credit, so that there is no violation of the rule that payment and delivery are concurrent 
conditions, at any rate if delivery is taken to encompass delivery of the documents. The 
point is that payment by means of a banker’s credit is intended to operate, and does 
operate, not merely as a method of payment, but as a means of guaranteeing payment. 
Hence the seller is entitled to know before he ships the goods that the credit has been 
opened and that, as soon as he presents the documents, he will be paid.
It will be seen that payment of the price by banker’s credit is very favourable to the 
seller in at least three respects. First, once the credit is issued, he is reasonably assured 
of payment, and almost certainly if the credit is irrevocable (which, under the 1994 
Revision, all credits are, unless stated to be revocable);146 secondly, the buyer cannot 
delay payment by disputing the goods’ conformity to the contract; and thirdly, the cost 
of financing the shipment period falls on the buyer. The result is that payment by this 
method becomes less common in a buyer’s market.
Where the contract provides for payment by means of a banker’s credit and for 
payment against delivery of documents to a bank, the buyer fulfils his obligations by 
providing the credit on the agreed terms. If the seller delivers non-conforming documents 
to the bank, the bank and the buyer are fully entitled to reject the documents, and the 
contract will then be at an end, subject to the buyer’s claim for damages. There is no 
remaining obligation on the buyer to accept the goods when they arrive, even if they 
conform to the contract.147 So, also, the seller is not entitled to disregard the credit and 
send the documents direct to the buyer and claim payment from him.148 Accordingly, the 
buyer may reject documents tendered directly to him instead of to the bank. But this 
does not mean that the seller can never sue the buyer for the price even if the price was 
agreed to be payable by banker’s credit. For example, if, by some commercial mishap, 
the goods are actually delivered to and accepted by the buyer without payment by 
the bank, the seller retains his ordinary right to sue for the price,149 unless perhaps in

exceptional circumstances it may be held that he had accepted the letter of credit as 
absolute payment.150 So, also, if the goods are sold f.o.b. and the seller does not reserve 
the right of disposal, property may pass (as we have seen) on shipment. Therefore, if the 
bank wrongfully refuses payment in such a case, the seller may still sue the buyer for the 
price.151 The same is true if the bank fails to pay because of insolvency.152
A contractual term requiring a letter of credit is, of course, no protection to the seller 
unless it is in fact issued, and though the seller can refrain from shipping the goods if the 
letter is not duly issued, his guarantee of assured payment will simply fail without the 
letter of credit. To protect the seller against the risk that the letter of credit may not be 
issued, the contract may require the buyer to provide a performance bond as soon as it is 
agreed. Such a bond is itself very like a letter of credit; it is an undertaking, usually given 
by a bank or other unimpeachable guarantor, to pay a specified sum to the addressee 
on various terms.153 Sometimes, the terms are (in effect) simply that the recipient of the 
letter writes to the bank asserting that there has been default by the other party and 
demanding payment under the bond. The bank must then pay, even though there was 
no default.154 As with a letter of credit, any argument about whether the amount of the 
bond was payable is deferred until after the bond has been paid. Performance bonds 
are more often encountered in building and engineering contracts, but they may also 
be demanded in an ordinary export sale to cover the period before a letter of credit is 
issued.155

International Convention  
on Sales of Goods (‘CISG’)
Introduction
For many decades, there had been efforts to agree on a treaty to provide a set of legal rules for 
international sales. An initial attempt was the Convention relating to a Uniform Law on the 
International Sale of Goods 1964, known as the Hague ULIS, but this failed to gain the sup-
port of a significant number of states (although the UK did ratify this convention). After sev-
eral years of further effort, a diplomatic conference of 62 states approved the United Nation 
Convention on the International Sale of Goods (CISG) in 1980. The Convention came into 
force on 1 January 1988 following ratification by 11 states. These states included the USA. 
At the time of writing, it is force in 83 countries.1 The major trading nations which have not 
ratified the Convention are India and the United Kingdom. The reason the United Kingdom 
has not ratified appears to be opposition from a number of influential organisations, lack of 
public service resources and fear that London would lose its edge in international arbitration 
and litigation.2 Nevertheless, in view of the increasing importance of the Convention it has 
been thought appropriate to include information about it in this work.
International Convention
The CISG is an international Treaty, which has the force of law in those countries which have 
ratified or acceded to it. The provisions of the CISG only apply to those contracts which fall 
within its scope, so it is important to examine the field of application of the Convention first. 
Moreover, as with any international Convention, there are special rules of interpretation 
which national courts dealing with a case involving the CISG need to follow.
Field of application of CISG
Article 1 provides:
(1)	 the Convention applies to contracts of sale of goods between parties whose places of busi-
ness are in different States:
(a)	 when the States are Contracting States; or
	1	 See list at: http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/sale_goods/1980CISG_status.html.
	2	 See Moss (2005) 1 Journal of  Law and Commerce 483. There may be different views in Scotland: see 
Report on Formation of Contract: Scottish Law and the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the 
International Sale of Goods (Scot Law Com No 144, 1993).

	372	 Export sales
(b)	 when the rules of private international law lead to the application of the law of a 
Contracting State.
Accordingly, the trigger for the application of the Convention is international diversity 
of places of business of buyers and sellers. Place of incorporation is thus irrelevant for 
the purposes of the Convention. In the case of multinational enterprises with more than 
one place of business, or parties which do not have a place of business, Article 10, CISG 
provides:
(a)	 if a party has more than one place of business, the place of business is that which has 
the closest relationship to the contract and its performance, having regard to the circum-
stances known to or contemplated by the parties at any time before or at the conclusion of 
the contract;
(b)	 if a party does not have a place of business, reference is to be made to his habitual 
residence.
Although by the terms of Article 1 (above), the Convention applies to international 
sales of goods, the Convention contains no definition of ‘goods’. Instead, Article 2 
excludes certain types of goods from its scope.
[Sales:]
(a)	 of goods bought for personal, family or household use, unless the seller, at any time before 
or at the conclusion of the contract, neither knew nor ought to have known that the goods 
were bought for any such use;
(b)	 by auction;
(c)	 on execution or otherwise by authority of law;
(d)	 of stocks, shares, investment securities, negotiable instruments or money;
(e)	 of ships, vessels, hovercraft or aircraft;
(f)	 of electricity.
Nor does the Convention contain a definition of ‘buyer’ or of ‘seller’. Contracts for 
mixed goods and services can fall within the Convention. As in the UK and the majority 
of jurisdictions in the USA, the Convention has a version of the ‘predominant purpose’ 
test.3 Article 3 provides:
(1)	 Contracts for the supply of goods to be manufactured or produced are to be considered 
sales unless the party who orders the goods undertakes to supply a substantial part of the 
materials necessary for such manufacture or production.
(2)	 This Convention does not apply to contracts in which the predominant part of the obli-
gations of the party who furnishes the goods consists in the supply of labour or other 
services.
Although the Convention has no express provision dealing with sales of software, the 
Landgericht München has held that an international sale of a computer program can be 
subject to CISG.4 This would accord with the general view of mass-produced standard 
software, but software specifically written for a client is surely a contract for the supply 
of services and outwith the Convention?5

International Convention on Sales of Goods (‘CISG’) 	 373
As noted above, the Convention contains no definition of ‘goods’. There is no 
equivalent to the definition contained in s. 61 of the Sale of Goods Act but presumably 
the things included in that definition, that is, emblements,6 industrial growing crops, and 
things attached to or forming part of the land which are agreed to be severed before sale 
or under the contract of sale, would also ‘goods’ within the Convention. Contracts for 
mining and other extraction, on the other hand, seem to be outwith the Convention. 
This seems to be confirmed indirectly by various articles of the Convention.7
Formalities
Article 11 provides that a contract need not be concluded or evidenced by a writing 
and is not subject to any other requirement as to form. However, this provision was 
not acceptable to a number of states involved in the negotiation of the Convention. 
Accordingly, Article 12 was added allowing nations to obviate Article 11 by so declaring 
at the time of ratification.8
Battle of the forms
This refers to the situation where the pro forma used by the offeree in purporting to 
accept an offer, differs from the pro forma used by the offeror in making the offer. Under 
the notorious doctrine in Hyde v Wrench,9 the ‘acceptance’ amounts to a rejection of the 
offer, and a counter-offer from the offeree. CISG modifies this doctrine only in a minor 
way. Article 19 provides as follows:
(1)	 A reply to an offer which purports to be an acceptance but contains additions, limitations 
or other modifications is a rejection of the offer and constitutes a counteroffer.
(2)	 However, a reply to an offer which purports to be an acceptance but contains additional 
or different terms which do not materially alter the terms of the offer constitutes an 
acceptance, unless the offeror, without undue delay, objects orally to the discrepancy or 
dispatches a notice to that effect. If he does not so object, the terms of the contract are the 
terms of the offer with the modifications contained in the acceptance.
(3)	 Additional or different terms relating, among other things, to the price, payment, quality 
and quantity of the goods, place and time of delivery, extent of one party’s liability to the 
other or the settlement of disputes are considered to alter the terms of the offer materially.
Parol evidence rule
When the terms of a contract have been embodied in a writing to which both parties have 
assented as the definite and complete statement thereof, parol evidence of antecedent 
agreements, negotiations, and understandings is not admissible for the purpose of 
varying or contradicting the contract so embodied.10 In spite of its name, this is in fact a 
rule of law, not evidence.11
	6	 That is, annual growing crops.
	7	 See Art. 35 (conformity of goods); Arts 31–33 (delivery and shipment), Arts 66–70 (risk of loss).

10	 Corbin on Contracts (1960, West), §§573–96.
11	 Ibid.

	374	 Export sales
Because Article 8(3) requires that ‘due consideration is to be given to all relevant 
circumstances of the case’, it would seem that CISG overrides any domestic rule of law 
that would bar a tribunal from considering parol evidence.12 Nevertheless, it has been 
argued that the rule could be an appropriate way to discern what consideration is due 
under Article 8(3) to evidence of a parol nature.13
Interpretation
As noted earlier, the CISG is an international Treaty and as such, there are special rules of 
interpretation to follow. This has been recognised expressly in Article 7, which provides:
(1)	 In the interpretation of this Convention, regard is to be had to its international character 
and to the need to promote uniformity in its application and the observance of good faith 
in international trade.
(2)	 Questions concerning matters governed by this Convention which are not settled in it 
are to be settled in conformity with the general principles on which it is based or, in the 
absence of such principles, in conformity with the law applicable by virtue of the rules of 
private international law.
As one well-known commentator has written:
To read the words of the Convention with regard for their ‘international character’ requires 
that they be projected against an international background. With time, a body of international 
experience will develop through international case law and scholarly writing.14
In essence, a court needs to ensure that the interpretation of the CISG’s terminology is 
not influenced by how similar (or potentially even identical) terms have been interpreted 
in a domestic setting. This is known as the principle of ‘autonomous interpretation’. 
Courts are reminded to bear in mind the CISG’s international character and also the 
intention to pursue uniformity in its application, which implies a strong encouragement 
for courts in one jurisdiction to take note of rulings on similar issues by courts in other 
jurisdictions. This is facilitated by the provision of the CLOUT database, and the UN’s 
Digest on the Convention.15
A somewhat controversial aspect of Article 7(1) is the reference to ‘good faith’, which 
reflects the difficult compromises that need to be made when negotiating an international 
convention. There was disagreement as to whether to impose a positive duty to act in good 
faith on the parties to an international sales contract or whether to refrain from including 
any reference to good faith (reflecting a long-running tension between some common law 
jurisdictions and the civil law jurisdictions), which eventually resulted in the compromise 
solution to make ‘good faith’ a relevant factor in the interpretation of the CISG.

Article 7(2) deals with circumstances where an issue before a court does not fall clearly 
within the provisions of the CISG. This is often referred to as a ‘gap’. Some gaps are 
‘internal’, that is, the issue is one not directly addressed in the CISG but it falls within 
the areas covered by it (e.g., the remedies of a buyer). Here, courts are required to adopt 
an interpretation which reflects the principles on which the CISG is based (although 
these are not espoused clearly anywhere) first, and only have recourse to the applicable 
domestic law as a matter of final resort. Where the gap is ‘external’, it relates to an issue 
not covered in the CISG at all (e.g., validity, or passing of property), and such a matter 
needs to be resolved on the basis of the provisions of the domestic law applicable to the 
contract, established by applying the private international law rules of the forum.
In addition to the specific rules in Article 7 CISG, the Vienna Convention on the Law 
of Treaties, which entered into force in 1980, is also relevant in this regard. The most 
relevant provisions of this Treaty are the following:
Article 31 General rule of interpretation
1.	 A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be 
given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.
2.	 The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to 
the text, including its preamble and annexes:
(a)	 any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connex-
ion with the conclusion of the treaty;
(b)	 any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connexion with the conclusion 
of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.
3.	 There shall be taken into account, together with the context:
(a)	 any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the 
treaty or the application of its provisions;
(b)	 any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agree-
ment of the parties regarding its interpretation;
(c)	 any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.
4.	 A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended.
Article 32 Supplementary means of interpretation
Recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of 
the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from 
the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning according to article 31:
(a)	 leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or
(b)	 leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.16
Comparing the CISG with the Sale of Goods Act 1979
As the focus of this book is primarily on the English and Scottish law of sale, this chapter 
will highlight aspects of the CISG and contrast them with corresponding provisions in 
the Sale of Goods Act.
16	 A useful compilation of the travaux préparatoires for CISG can be found in J. Honnold, Documentary 
History of the Uniform Law for International Sales (1989, Kluwer).

	376	 Export sales
Freedom from Third Party claims
Article 41 provides that: ‘The seller must deliver goods which are free from any right or 
claim of a third party.’ The absence of the word ‘title’ from this provision makes it fairly 
clear that it includes claims by third parties based on intellectual property rights.17 What 
is not clear is whether it extends to ‘clouds on the title’ which, whilst theoretically not 
inhibiting dealings in the goods, nevertheless can seriously diminish their commercial 
value on the market.18
Express warranties
Article 35 provides:
(1)	 The seller must deliver goods which are of the quantity, quality and description required by 
the contract and which are contained or packaged in the manner required by the contract.
Conformity with the Contract: Quality and Fitness for Purpose
Article 35 goes on to provide:
(2)	 Except where the parties have agreed otherwise, the goods do not conform with the con-
tract unless they:
(a)	 are fit for the purposes for which goods of the same description would ordinarily be 
used;
(b)	 are fit for any particular purpose expressly or impliedly made known to the seller at 
the time of the conclusion of the contract, except where the circumstances show that 
the buyer did not rely, or that it was unreasonable for him to rely, on the seller’s skill 
and judgment;
(c)	 possess the qualities of goods which the seller has held out to the buyer as a sample or 
model;
(d)	 are contained or packaged in the manner usual for such goods or, where there is no 
such manner, in a manner adequate to preserve and protect the goods.
Buyer’s and seller’s remedies
The same provisions, Articles 74–76 apply to buyer’s and seller’s remedies. For 
convenience of exposition, however, we deal with buyer’s and seller’s remedies separately.
Buyer’s remedies
These are listed in Article 45(1). This cross-refers to the rights set out in Articles 46–52, 
and the claims for damages set out in Articles 74–77. Article 49(1)(a) provides that the 
buyer may declare the contract avoided if the failure by the seller to perform any of his 
obligations under the contract or this Convention amounts to a ‘fundamental breach’ of 
17	 See Microbeads v Vinhurst Road Markings Ltd [1975] 1 All ER 529, discussed at p. 96.

International Convention on Sales of Goods (‘CISG’) 	 377
contract. This would include breach of the quality provisions of Article 35 set out above. 
‘Fundamental breach’ is defined in Article 25:
A breach of contract committed by one of the parties is fundamental if it results in such 
detriment to the other party as substantially to deprive him of what he is entitled to expect 
under the contract, unless the party in breach did not foresee and a reasonable person of the 
same kind in the same circumstances would not have foreseen such result.
Article 49 provides:
(1)	 The buyer may declare the contract avoided:
(a)	 if the failure by the seller to perform any of his obligations under the contract or this 
Convention amounts to a fundamental breach of contract; or
(b)	 in case of non-delivery, if the seller does not deliver the goods within the additional 
period of time fixed by the buyer in accordance with paragraph (1) of article 47 or 
declares that he will not deliver within the period so fixed.
In a decision of the Bundesgerichtshof involving a sale of cobalt from a Dutch seller to 
a German buyer, where the contract required the goods to be of British origin, the buyer 
purported to declare the contract avoided on the ground that the certificates of origin 
were wrong and that the goods were of South African origin and of inferior quality. 
The court held that, since the seller had effected delivery, the buyer could not declare 
the contract avoided under Article 49(1)(b), and that there was no fundamental breach 
within Article 49(1)(a) since the buyer had failed to show that the cobalt was unsaleable 
in Germany or elsewhere and that it had failed to show that it was substantially deprived 
of what it was entitled to expect as required by Article 25 (above). Nor was the delivery 
of the wrong certificates a fundamental breach since the buyer could obtain correct 
certificates. Accordingly, the buyer was obliged to pay pursuant to Article 58.
As noted above, the damages provisions (which cover buyer’s and seller’s damages) 
are contained in Articles 75 and 76. These provide as follows:
Article 75
If the contract is avoided and if, in a reasonable manner and within a reasonable time after 
avoidance, the buyer has bought goods in replacement or the seller has resold the goods, the 
party claiming damages may recover the difference between the contract price and the price in 
the substitute transaction as well as any further damages recoverable under article 74.
Article 76
(1)	 If the contract is avoided and there is a current price for the goods, the party claiming 
damages may, if he has not made a purchase or resale under article 75, recover the differ-
ence between the price fixed by the contract and the current price at the time of avoidance 
as well as any further damages recoverable under article 74. If, however, the party claiming 
damages has avoided the contract after taking over the goods, the current price at the time 
of such taking over shall be applied instead of the current price at the time of avoidance.
(2)	 For the purposes of the preceding paragraph, the current price is the price prevailing at the 
place where delivery of the goods should have been made or, if there is no current price at 
that place, the price at such other place as serves as a reasonable substitute, making due 
allowance for differences in the cost of transporting the goods.

	378	 Export sales
If the buyer ‘covers’ by buying on the market, the buyer’s basic damages are measured 
by the difference between the price of the substitute goods and the contract price, plus 
any further damages as provided by Article 74 as follows:
Damages for breach of contract by one party consist of a sum equal to the loss, including loss 
of profit, suffered by the other party as a consequence of the breach. Such damages may not 
exceed the loss which the party in breach foresaw or ought to have foreseen at the time of the 
conclusion of the contract, in the light of the facts and matters of which he then knew or ought 
to have known, as a possible consequence of the breach of contract.
When a contract is not avoided, the basic formula for the measurement of damages is 
that set out in Article 74. Does this embody the ‘benefit of the bargain’ principle which 
under the Sale of Goods Act is the difference between the value of the goods delivered, 
and the value they would have had if they had conformed to the contract?19 Article 76 
makes it clear with certain modifications that it does. If the buyer has not covered, 
damages are measured by the current price for the goods that is the price prevailing for 
the goods at the place where delivery of the goods should have been made (Article 76(1)) 
or, absent such price, at another place that is a reasonable substitute (Article 76(2)). 
‘Loss’ is broad enough to cover consequential damages but such further damages then 
are subject to the foreseeability test set out in the second sentence of Article 74.20
As we have seen, CISG does not apply where goods are bought for personal, family or 
household use,21 nor does it apply to the liability of the seller for death or personal injury 
caused by the goods to any person.22 Professor Honnold has explained the reason for this as 
follows:
In UNCITRAL attention was drawn to the development of national legislation and case law 
designed to protect consumers; it was agreed that the Convention should not supersede these 
rules. Consideration was given to a provision that the Convention would not override any 
domestic rule that was ‘mandatory’ or that implemented ‘public policy’ (ordre public) but it 
was found that these concepts carried different meanings in various legal systems; the clearest 
and safest solution was specifically to exclude consumer purchases from the Convention . . .23
Seller’s remedies
These arise when buyers wrongfully declare the contract avoided or, without making a 
declaration, refuse to accept and pay for the goods.24 As noted above, the same Articles 
govern the seller’s recovery of damages as govern those of the buyer (set out above).
Article 62 provides for the seller’s recovery of the price. It provides:
The seller may require the buyer to pay the price, take delivery or perform his other obligations, 
unless the seller has resorted to a remedy which is inconsistent with this requirement.

International Convention on Sales of Goods (‘CISG’) 	 379
The recovery of the price is not therefore conditioned on the property having passed 
to the buyer as it is under s. 49 of the Sale of Goods Act, nor is it conditioned on the 
seller making a reasonable effort to resell the goods as it is under Article 2-709(1) of the 
Uniform Commercial Code.
If sellers have possession and control of the goods and elect not to seek the price, they 
may claim damages as provided by Articles 74–77.25 (These provisions are set out above.) 
Under Article 74, an aggrieved seller is entitled to a sum equal to the loss, including 
loss of profit, suffered as a consequence of the breach, but this again is subject to the 
foreseeability test set out in the second sentence. Moreover, under Article 77 the seller 
must take such measures as are reasonable in the circumstances to mitigate the loss, 
including loss of profit, resulting from the breach. This means that aggrieved sellers in 
possession of the goods must make reasonable efforts to resell the goods.26 If the seller 
has resold the goods, it may recover the difference between the contract price and the 
(lower) resale price.27 If the seller has not resold the goods, it may recover the difference 
between the price fixed by the contract and the current price at the time of avoidance.28 
‘Current price’ means primarily the prevailing price at the place where delivery of the 
goods should have been made.29
The problem of the ‘lost volume seller’ could in principle arise in international sales 
subject to the Convention, as it does in domestic sales.30 The Convention has no specific 
provision dealing with it. However, Article 74 is sufficiently widely drafted to cover this, 
and one learned commentator takes the view that lost volume sellers may have a remedy 
under the Convention.31
Notice of breach
The Sale of Goods Act has no specific provision on notice requirements, but CISG does. 
Article 39 provides:
(1)	 The buyer loses the right to rely on a lack of conformity of the goods if he does not give 
notice to the seller specifying the nature of the lack of conformity within a reasonable time 
after he has discovered it or ought to have discovered it.
In UNCITRAL CLOUT Abstract 285,32 it was held that giving notice three weeks after 
delivery of obviously non-conforming goods was too late. However, failure to give 
sufficient notice does not result in the buyer being ‘barred from any remedy’.33 Article

Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of article 39 and paragraph (1) of article 43, 
the buyer may reduce the price in accordance with article 50 or claim damages, except for loss 
of profit, if he has a reasonable excuse for his failure to give the required notice.
This provision is not limited to circumstances in which the price has not been paid. 
Under Article 50 the buyer may reduce the price ‘whether or not the price has already 
been paid’.
The time limit for the buyer to serve notice as required by the above provisions is in 
any event two years from the date on which the goods were ‘actually handed over’,34 
whether or not the buyer discovered, or ought to have discovered, the non-conformities.35 
This time bar is absolute, and overrides the offset provision of Article 44.
Execution of sales contracts
The Convention sets out the general obligations of the seller and the buyer. Article 30 
provides:
The seller must deliver the goods, hand over any documents relating to them and transfer the 
property in the goods, as required by the contract and this Convention.
The reciprocal provision governing the buyer’s duties is Article 53:
The buyer must pay the price for the goods and take delivery of them as required by the contract 
and this Convention.
The seller’s obligation to deliver, as under domestic law, is satisfied by putting the 
goods at the buyer’s disposal at the place where the seller has its place of business at the 
time of the conclusion of the contract,36 unless the parties knew from the circumstances; 
for example, that the goods were to be manufactured or produced at a particular place, 
that the goods would be placed at the buyer’s disposal at another location.37 If the 
contract involves the carriage of goods, the seller’s obligation to deliver is complied with 
by handing over the goods to the first carrier for transmission to the buyer.38 In such cases, 
absent express agreement, the seller must make such contracts as are necessary for the 
carriage to the place fixed [by the agreement] by means of transportation appropriate in 
the circumstances and in accordance to the usual terms for such transportation.39 If the 
goods are not clearly identified to the contract by markings on the goods, by shipping 
documents or otherwise, the seller must give the buyer notice of the consignment 
specifying the goods.40
As to the time of delivery, the Convention looks in the first place to the terms of the 
contract.41 If a period is fixed or determinable from the contract, the seller can choose to 
perform at any time within that period unless circumstances indicate that the buyer is to

choose a date.42 If the contract is silent as to the time of delivery, the seller must deliver 
within a reasonable time after the conclusion of the contract.43
In international sales transactions involving carriage of goods by sea, it is often 
required that the buyer provides that vessel onto which the seller loads in the specified 
port. In this case, the buyer must give the seller notice specified in the contract, or 
within a reasonable time, to enable the seller to load. There is no specific Article of the 
Convention dealing with this, but under domestic law, if due notice is given, the seller 
must have the goods ready to be loaded at the time specified.44
The Convention has no provisions dealing with the performance of contracts for the 
sale of goods in the hands of a warehouseman or similar.
Unless otherwise agreed, the buyer must pay when the seller places either the goods, 
or the documents controlling their disposition, at the buyer’s disposal in accordance with 
the contract and the Convention.45 If the payment is to be made against the handing over 
of the goods or documents, payment must be made where the handing over takes place.46 
Otherwise payment must be made at the seller’s place of business.47 The Convention 
does not deal with the manner of the buyer’s payment other than providing that the 
buyer’s obligations include taking such steps and complying with such formalities as 
may be required under the contract or any laws and regulations to enable payment to be 
made.48 This latter could include opening a banker’s documentary credit in accordance 
with the requirements of the contract.49
Right of inspection
As under the Sale of Goods Act, s. 34, the buyer has a right to examine the goods, and 
the buyer is not bound to pay the price until it has had an opportunity to examine 
the goods,50 unless the procedures for delivery or payment agreed by the parties are 
inconsistent with the buyer having such an opportunity.51
Risk of loss
The principles governing risk of loss are set out in Chapter IV of the Convention. Article 66 
provides:
Loss of or damage to the goods after the risk has passed to the buyer does not discharge him 
from his obligation to pay the price, unless the loss or damage is due to an act or omission of 
the seller.

Article 67 deals with contracts involving the carriage of goods. It provides:
(1)	 If the contract of sale involves carriage of the goods and the seller is not bound to hand 
them over at a particular place, the risk passes to the buyer when the goods are handed 
over to the first carrier for transmission to the buyer in accordance with the contract of 
sale. If the seller is bound to hand the goods over to a carrier at a particular place, the risk 
does not pass to the buyer until the goods are handed over to the carrier at that place. The 
fact that the seller is authorized to retain documents controlling the disposition of the 
goods does not affect the passage of the risk.
(2)	 Nevertheless, the risk does not pass to the buyer until the goods are clearly identified to the 
contract, whether by markings on the goods, by shipping documents, by notice given to 
the buyer or otherwise.
Article 68 deals with goods sold in transit:
The risk in respect of goods sold in transit passes to the buyer from the time of the conclusion 
of the contract. However, if the circumstances so indicate, the risk is assumed by the buyer 
from the time the goods were handed over to the carrier who issued the documents embodying 
the contract of carriage. Nevertheless, if at the time of the conclusion of the contract of sale 
the seller knew or ought to have known that the goods had been lost or damaged and did not 
disclose this to the buyer, the loss or damage is at the risk of the seller.
Article 69 deals with cases not within the above provisions. It provides:
(1)	 In cases not within articles 67 and 68, the risk passes to the buyer when he takes over the 
goods or, if he does not do so in due time, from the time when the goods are placed at his 
disposal and he commits a breach of contract by failing to take delivery.
(2)	 However, if the buyer is bound to take over the goods at a place other than a place of busi-
ness of the seller, the risk passes when delivery is due and the buyer is aware of the fact that 
the goods are placed at his disposal at that place.
(3)	 If the contract relates to goods not then identified, the goods are considered not to be 
placed at the disposal of the buyer until they are clearly identified to the contract.
Article 70 provides that if the seller has committed a fundamental breach52 of contract, 
Articles 67, 68 and 69 do not impair the remedies available to the buyer on account of 
the breach.

Part VI
The remedies of the seller

Real remedies
Seller’s rights and powers against the goods
Where the buyer defaults in his principal obligation, that is, in payment of the price, 
the seller has, of course, his personal action on the contract itself, but if the seller were 
always compelled to fall back on this remedy, his position would be in many respects 
unsatisfactory. The law has, therefore, developed certain ‘real’ rights or remedies whereby 
the seller can still look to the goods as a kind of security for payment of the price. In 
considering these real remedies, four different fact situations must be distinguished.
First, there may be a sale of specific goods in which the property has passed to the 
buyer and the goods have been delivered to him. Here, the seller has relinquished all 
right to look to the goods for his price and he is relegated to his personal right of action 
against the buyer. If the seller attempts to enforce his right to the price by seizing the 
goods from the buyer’s possession, the seller’s conduct will be a breach of s. 12 of the 
Act1 and will doubtless constitute the tort of conversion2 in English law as well. It is 
possible for the parties to provide by express agreement that the property in the goods 
is to remain in the seller even after they have been delivered, in which case the seller may 
have the right to seize or reclaim the goods in certain events – for instance, if the buyer 
becomes insolvent before the price is paid. But such a right to reclaim the goods after 
delivery cannot be implied since it would be very rare for the property to be retained by 
the seller after delivery unless there is an express provision to this effect. But the use of 
such express provisions – reservation of title clauses – is widespread and giving rise to 
difficult questions. It will therefore be necessary to consider their effect,3 even though 
they cannot arise by implication of law in the same way that the other real rights arise.
Secondly, there may be a sale of specific goods in which the property has passed to 
the buyer, but the goods have not yet been delivered. In this case, whether the goods 
are still in the possession of the seller or have been dispatched to the buyer (but not yet 
reached him), the law confers on the seller, subject to certain conditions, (a) the power to 
resell the goods and pass a good title to a third party as well as some incidental powers, 
and (b) the right to do so vis-à-vis the first buyer. It must be emphasised that these are 
two very different things because the seller often has the power to pass a good title to a 
bona fide transferee without having the right to do so; in other words, the resale may 
constitute a breach of contract as against the first buyer although it validly transfers 
the property. Indeed, as we have already seen, a seller always has the power to transfer a

	2	 On which, see S.Green and J.Randall, The Tort of Conversion (Oxford: Hart, 2009)
	3	 See below, p. 406.

	386	 The remedies of the seller
good title to an innocent third party so long as he is in possession of the goods because 
of s. 24 of the Sale of Goods Act and s. 8 of the Factors Act 1889, but the right to do so 
is more severely restricted, as will become apparent in due course.
Thirdly, there may be an agreement to sell specific or unascertained goods in which 
no property has yet passed, but in which the seller is under a personal obligation to 
deliver certain particular goods and no others. This is always the case where there is an 
agreement to sell specific goods, and it may also occur in a sale of unascertained goods 
when there has been sufficient appropriation to place the seller under an obligation to 
deliver those particular goods, although there has not been sufficient appropriation to 
pass the property. This may happen, for example, in a c.i.f. contract when the seller 
gives notice of appropriation, or in a contract for the manufacture of an article where 
the personal obligation to deliver the goods may come into being before the property 
passes.4 In these cases, the law does not need to confer a power of resale on the seller 
because he still has the property in the goods and can, simply by virtue of this property, 
transfer a good title to another buyer. But it does not follow that the seller does not need 
statutory protection from the consequences of exercising this power. For example, if the 
buyer defaults in payment of the price on the date agreed, the seller, being still the owner 
of the goods, has power to resell them (and the incidental powers of retaining them, or 
recovering them from a carrier), but the exercise of these powers might be a breach of 
contract. The law, therefore, protects the seller from the consequences of availing himself 
of these powers, subject to certain conditions.
Fourthly, there may be an agreement to sell unascertained goods in which no property 
has yet passed and in which there is no obligation to deliver any particular goods. Here no 
special provisions are needed at all, because the seller clearly has full power to exercise any 
control over the goods, and such exercise cannot be a breach of contract. For example, if 
a seller agrees to sell 1,000 tonnes of a certain type of wheat and procures wheat of that 
description intending to deliver it in performance of the contract, no property passes before 
appropriation, nor is the seller bound to deliver that particular 1,000 tonnes. If, therefore, the 
seller resells this 1,000 tonnes to a third party, he can pass a good title to this party, and his 
action will not be a breach of contract with the first buyer.
It must be said that the Act fails to draw clearly all the above distinctions, with the 
natural consequence that confusion results. One does not have to agree with all the 
conclusions of Hohfeld5 to acknowledge that there is a world of difference between a 
power and a right of resale, yet even this clear distinction is obscured by the ambiguity 
of such phrases as ‘the seller has the right to do such and such’, or ‘the seller may do such 
and such’.6 An examination of s. 39, which confers the three real rights of the unpaid 
seller, illustrates some of these problems:
(1)	 Subject to this and any other Act, notwithstanding that the property in the goods may have 
passed to the buyer, the unpaid seller of goods, as such, has by implication of law—
(a)	 a lien on the goods or right to retain them for the price while he is in possession of 
them;

Press), Ch. 1.
	6	 Cf. ss. 39, 41 and 48.

	
	 	
Real remedies	 387
(b)	 in case of the insolvency of the buyer, a right of stopping the goods in transit after he 
has parted with the possession of them;
(c)	 a right of resale as limited by this Act.
(2)	 Where the property in goods has not passed to the buyer, the unpaid seller has (in addition 
to his other remedies) a right of withholding delivery similar to and co-extensive with his 
rights of lien and stoppage in transit where the property has passed to the buyer.
The first subsection is not likely to give much difficulty, although it is not so clearly 
drafted as it might have been. It is clear that its object is to confer on the seller not 
merely the power to deal with the goods, but also the right so to do as against the buyer. 
This section is for the benefit of the seller and not of the third party, so that a power 
without a corresponding right would have been useless in this respect. But the second 
subsection is not so innocuous and could give rise to trouble. The draftsman seems to 
have thought it necessary to put in the right of withholding delivery, but not the power 
of resale, because the seller who is still owner does not need a power of resale. But this 
appears to be a confusion of the right and the power. If s. 39(2) only means to lay down 
certain powers, then it is totally unnecessary because the owner of the goods has the 
power of withholding delivery no less than the power of passing a good title to a third 
person. On the other hand, if s. 39(2) is meant to confer a right to exercise the power, 
as one would have thought, it follows that the right to resell the goods should have been 
included as well. The omission of this right might have the remarkable result that an 
unpaid seller could, as against the buyer, resell the goods in accordance with the Act 
where the property had passed to the buyer, but could not do so where the property had 
not passed. But whatever the literal construction of these provisions may be, the courts 
have shown no inclination to be too literal-minded. On the contrary, it has been affirmed 
that the seller’s rights of resale cannot be greater where the property has passed to the 
buyer than where it has not.7
The second apparent flaw in s. 39(2) is that it states that the owner-seller’s right of 
withholding delivery is similar to and coextensive with the rights of lien and stoppage 
in transit where the property has passed. This fails to differentiate those cases where the 
seller is under a personal duty to deliver a particular lot of goods and those cases where 
there is no such duty. In the latter event, the seller’s right of withholding delivery is by no 
means coextensive with his right of lien. It is a far wider right because it arises without 
default on the part of the buyer. Obviously, where the seller’s duty has not yet become 
attached to any particular goods, there can be no question of a breach of contract by him 
simply because he chooses to withhold delivery of some goods which he had intended to 
use in performance of the contract. It is inconceivable that this section should, by a side 
wind as it were, alter these fundamentals in the law of sale. In proceeding to examine 
the three real rights of the unpaid seller, then, it must be borne in mind that we are only 
concerned with the second and third fact situations put above. In other words, we are 
concerned with those cases where, but for these special rights, the seller would have a 
power but no right to deal with the goods by withholding delivery or reselling, and those 
cases where the seller would have neither the power nor the right to do so.

	388	 The remedies of the seller
Who is an unpaid seller?
These three real rights may only be exercised by an unpaid seller, and the first question is, 
who exactly is an unpaid seller within the meaning of the Act? The meaning of ‘unpaid’ 
is explained by s. 38(1) as follows:
(1)	 The seller of goods is an unpaid seller within the meaning of this Act—
(a)	 when the whole of the price has not been paid or tendered;
(b)	 when a bill of exchange or other negotiable instrument has been received as condi-
tional payment, and the condition on which it was received has not been fulfilled by 
reason of the dishonour of the instrument or otherwise.
The seller is therefore ‘unpaid’ within the meaning of the Act even though he has sold on 
credit, and he remains unpaid until the whole price has been paid or tendered.8
The meaning of a ‘seller’, for present purposes, is explained by s. 38(2) as follows:
In this Part of this Act ‘seller’ includes any person who is in the position of a seller, as, for 
instance, an agent of the seller to whom the bill of lading has been indorsed, or a consignor or 
agent who has himself paid (or is directly responsible for) the price.
If, for example, the seller sells the goods through an agent and the agent has himself 
paid the price to the seller, or made himself liable to pay it, then the agent is entitled to 
exercise any of the rights of the unpaid seller.9 A buyer who has rejected goods is not, 
however, in the position of a seller within the meaning of this section and cannot claim 
any of the unpaid seller’s rights in order to secure repayment of the price.10 It follows 
that a buyer who is minded to reject goods on the ground that they do not conform to 
the contract should, if he has paid the price, be careful to do so only if he is satisfied of 
the solvency of the seller. The rejection of the goods revests the property in the seller, so 
if he should prove insolvent the buyer will have worsened his position by the rejection.
We can now pass to examine in detail the three real rights conferred by the Act on the 
unpaid seller.
Unpaid seller’s lien
The seller’s lien in ordinary contracts of sale of goods now depends entirely on the Sale 
of Goods Act, which is quite inconsistent with any suggestion that there may be any 
equitable lien differing from that provided for in the Act.11
The seller’s lien is a right to retain the goods until the whole of the price has been paid 
or tendered. It does not ‘strictly speaking give to the seller any property in the goods 
subject to it’.12 At common law, a lien does not confer a power of sale, but the unpaid

Real remedies	 389
seller has a statutory power and right of sale subject to certain conditions which will be 
examined in due course. In practice, the lien is often exercised merely as a preliminary to 
a resale of the goods. The seller’s right of lien is a qualification upon the duty to deliver 
the goods laid down by s. 27 and it only arises if three conditions are satisfied.
In the first place, the seller must be an unpaid seller as defined by s. 38. This section 
has already been set out and it is only necessary to emphasise here that the whole of the 
price must be paid or tendered before the buyer can claim to have discharged the lien. 
This raises important questions in connection with instalment contracts and it has been 
held that, generally speaking, the seller is entitled to exercise his lien over any part of 
the goods if any part of the price is outstanding. In other words, he is not confined to 
claiming a lien over those goods to which the unpaid part of the price may be attributed.13 
Reference should also be made here to s. 42, which is as follows:
Where an unpaid seller has made part delivery of the goods he may exercise his lien . . . on the 
remainder, unless such part delivery has been made under such circumstances as to show an 
agreement to waive the lien . . .
Where, however, there is not one contract, but a number of separate contracts for 
goods to be separately paid for and delivered, it naturally follows that the seller cannot 
claim a lien over any part of the goods which have been paid for, merely because some 
others have not been paid for.14 This would be a general lien, which may be conferred 
by express contractual terms, but the lien which the Act confers is only a special or 
particular lien. It does not follow, of course, from the mere fact that the goods are to 
be delivered and paid for in instalments that there is not still one contract only. On the 
contrary, the general rule is that a contract for the sale of goods by instalments is still 
one contract, and the lien may therefore be exercised over any part of the goods.15
In the second place, the seller is not entitled to a lien if the goods have been sold on 
credit. If a seller agrees to allow the buyer credit, this does not necessarily mean that 
he is prepared to deliver the goods before the price has been paid. It may only mean 
that the seller is not insisting on immediate payment to which he is prima facie entitled 
if he is ready and willing to deliver. Oddly enough, the Act appears to assume that an 
agreement as to credit necessarily means an agreement that the buyer shall be entitled to 
the goods before payment because s. 41(1)(a) says:
(1)	 Subject to this Act, the unpaid seller of goods who is in possession of them is entitled 
to retain possession of them until payment or tender of the price in the following cases, 
namely—
(a)	 where the goods have been sold without any stipulation as to credit . . . 
Read literally, this would mean that if a person buys goods and asks the seller for time 
to pay, which the seller grants, the buyer is forthwith, without more, entitled to demand 
delivery. Yet in granting credit, the seller may have meant no more than that he would 
not insist on immediate payment and, in this event, the court would no doubt give effect 
to the intention.

15	 Ex parte Chalmers (1873) 8 Ch App 289.

	390	 The remedies of the seller
Although the seller, therefore, has generally no right of lien if he sells the goods on 
credit, there are two exceptions to this rule, for s. 41(1) proceeds to add two further cases 
where the lien may be claimed:
(b)	 where the goods have been sold on credit, but the term of credit has expired;
(c)	 where the buyer becomes insolvent.
The first of these exceptions clearly enables the seller to claim a lien on the goods 
where the buyer has not taken advantage of the sale on credit to take possession of the 
goods. But it also seems to confer a right of lien even where the seller acts wrongfully in 
refusing to allow the buyer delivery despite the agreement as to credit, although it may 
be that the buyer could recover damages for non-delivery in this event.
The second exception requires rather closer examination. This clause enables the 
seller to refuse delivery even where he has agreed to sell the goods on credit (and a 
fortiori, if he has not) if the buyer becomes insolvent. On the meaning of insolvency, 
reference should be made to s. 61(4):
A person is deemed to be insolvent within the meaning of this Act if he has either ceased to 
pay his debts in the ordinary course of business, or he cannot pay his debts as they become due, 
whether he has committed an act of bankruptcy16 or not . . .
It is important to note that the mere fact that the buyer has become insolvent, or 
even that he has announced his insolvency, does not necessarily amount to a repudiation 
of the contract.17 It is, therefore, open to the trustee in bankruptcy or to a sub-buyer 
to tender the amount due to the seller and claim delivery of the goods. But although 
the mere fact of insolvency is not therefore a repudiation of the contract, any clear 
indication by the buyer that he will not proceed with the contract may amount to a 
repudiation. ‘If a person who has entered into a contract of this kind gives to the vendor 
before he has parted with the goods that which amounts in effect to this notice, “I have 
parted with all my property, and am unable to pay the price agreed upon”, it is equivalent 
to a repudiation of the contract.’18 This may be too rigidly stated. In modern cases, the 
question whether a party is to be treated as having repudiated the contract has been said 
to depend upon whether the guilty party has made it quite plain that he will not19 or 
cannot20 perform his obligations.21 In such a case, the seller can treat the contract as at 
an end and do as he pleases with the goods and, if he resells at a loss, he can claim in the 
bankruptcy for the remainder. For present purposes, the important point is that, even if 
the seller has sold the goods on credit, he can refuse to deliver them if the buyer becomes 
insolvent, except on payment of the whole price. He cannot be compelled to deliver up 
the goods and be relegated to his right to claim in the bankruptcy for the price.
16	Acts of bankruptcy were abolished by the Insolvency Act 1985, and there is now only one ground for 
making a bankruptcy order.

Real remedies	 391
The third essential requirement of the unpaid seller’s right to a lien is that the seller 
must be in possession of the goods. The lien is the right of an ‘unpaid seller of goods who 
is in possession of them . . . to retain possession of them’. It is not a right which enables 
the seller to regain a possession which has been given up.22 Possession is always a difficult 
subject, perhaps largely because it has not always been appreciated that possession 
means different things in different branches of the law.23 Indeed, it does not always seem 
to have the same meaning in the same branch of the law. In Great Eastern Rly v Lord’s 
Trustee,24 Lord Macnaghten expressly recognised that the seller’s lien differs from other 
liens in certain respects. It seems highly probable, for example, that the degree of control 
necessary to retain a seller’s lien differs from that necessary to retain an innkeeper’s 
or repairer’s lien. An innkeeper does not lose his lien although he permits the owner 
the most complete control over the goods, provided only that they are not taken out of 
the inn. A repairer may even retain his lien although he permits the owner to take the 
goods away for a limited purpose every day, provided they are returned at night.25 It was, 
indeed, formerly thought that a seller likewise did not lose his lien if he merely delivered 
the goods to the buyer as his agent or bailee, but this is probably not so today, even if it 
ever was.26 There is, however, no reason to doubt that some element of control over the 
goods by the buyer is not inconsistent with the seller’s retention of his lien.
At common law, a seller was only entitled to his lien if he was still in possession in his 
capacity as seller, and he lost his right of lien if he only retained possession as agent or bailee 
of the buyer. But the law was altered by the 1893 Act; s. 41(2) of the present Act enacts that:
The seller may exercise his lien . . . notwithstanding that he is in possession of the goods as 
agent, or bailee . . . for the buyer.
But if the seller agrees to hold the goods as agent or bailee, it may be held that he has 
waived his lien, the possibility of which is not excluded by this subsection.27
The seller’s lien is twice said by the Act to be a lien for the price,28 so presumably the seller 
is not entitled as seller to claim a lien for storage charges or the like. The decision of the 
House of Lords in Somes v British Empire Shipping Co29 is usually cited as laying down that 
the seller has no lien for storage charges in any circumstances, but in fact the case only decided 
that the seller cannot claim a lien in respect of storage charges which arise as a result of the 
seller’s exercise of his lien for the price. Indeed, the case also decides that the seller is not 
entitled to recover from the buyer the cost or expenses incurred by the seller in maintaining 
his possession for his sole benefit. But the case is not to be taken to decide that such costs 
22	 Scottish courts have held that where the seller retakes possession from the buyer, the former does not 
necessarily also regain the right of lien: London Scottish Transport v Tyres (Scotland) Ltd 1957 SLT (Sh Ct) 
48; Hostess Mobile Catering v Archibald Scott Ltd 1981 SC 185. But a lien is not extinguished if the holder 
is induced to give up possession by improper means: Goudie v Mulholland 2000 SC 61. See further Steven, 
Pledge and Lien (2008, Avizandum Edinburgh), paras 13.28, 13.34.

	392	 The remedies of the seller
or expenses can never be recovered from the buyer where he does derive some benefit from 
them, and, in particular, where they are incurred before the buyer demands possession, 
and therefore before the seller is strictly exercising his lien.30 However, it is not wholly clear 
whether the seller has any lien on the goods for such additional costs or expenses. If the 
goods are actually improved, or at least if they are saved from damage by the expenditure 
incurred, it seems that in principle a lien could arise for these expenses even though the lien 
conferred by the Act is confined to a lien for the price. But the general principle is that a 
bailee cannot claim a lien (except by express contract) unless he has in some way improved 
the goods, so that mere storage charges would not, in any event, give rise to a lien.31
Loss of lien
The seller loses his lien in one of four ways. First, if the price is paid or tendered, the 
seller ceases to be an unpaid seller and therefore loses his lien. But (apart from any 
question of waiver to be considered shortly) he is entitled to retain possession until 
payment or tender. If this is so, it might seem that payment or tender is, strictly speaking, 
a condition precedent to the buyer’s right to claim delivery, but as we have seen s. 28 
expressly says that payment and delivery are concurrent conditions. It is usually inferred 
from this that actual tender of the price is not necessary provided the buyer is ready and 
willing to pay the price and there is judicial authority to the effect that this at any rate 
is the limit of the seller’s duty to deliver.32 But if the buyer sues for non-delivery without 
making tender it would usually be arguable that the seller has waived the need for such 
a tender by making it quite plain that he is not going to deliver the goods in any event.33
The remaining three ways in which the seller loses his lien are set out in s. 43 which runs:
(1)	 The unpaid seller of goods loses his lien . . . in respect of them—
(a)	 when he delivers the goods to a carrier or other bailee . . . for the purpose of  
transmission to the buyer without reserving the right of disposal of the goods;
(b)	 when the buyer or his agent lawfully obtains possession of the goods;
(c)	 by waiver of the lien . . .
We have already seen that for some purposes delivery to a carrier is deemed to be 
delivery to the buyer,34 but this section clearly differentiates between these two different 
possibilities and, as will be seen shortly, the seller’s right of stoppage in transit depends 
on this very distinction. Although the seller loses his lien on delivery to the carrier, he 
may still have the right of stoppage in transit, but it is all the same important to decide 
when the goods pass into the possession of the carrier, because the extent of the right 
of lien differs from that of stoppage in transit. In particular, the seller can only stop the 
goods if the buyer is insolvent, whereas his right of lien only depends on the absence 
of a stipulation as to credit. It follows that the seller may well have a right of lien in 
circumstances in which he will have no right of stoppage once the goods have been 
delivered to the carrier.

Real remedies	 393
The meaning of a right of disposal has already been discussed in considering s. 1935and, if 
it means the same thing here as it does in that section, it follows that a seller who takes a bill of 
lading in his own name will have a right of lien until he transfers the bill. It has, however, been 
argued that right of disposal means something different here, namely a right of disposal of the 
possession.36 The point is a difficult one. On the one hand, it would be strange to find a different 
meaning attributed to the same phrase in a similar context in two parts of the same Act. On 
the other hand, by s. 39(1)(a) the seller only has a lien while he is in possession of the goods 
and delivery to a carrier normally means that the seller no longer has possession. Moreover, 
by s. 39(2) the seller’s right to a lien is the same whether or not property has passed, but if the 
seller is held to ‘reserve the right of disposal’ within the meaning of s. 43 by taking a bill of 
lading in his own name, he will not lose his lien on shipment, but only when property passes. 
The answer to these difficulties probably lies in the principle that possession of a bill of lading  
(at least where it is in the name of the party in possession) confers possession of the goods. 
As a practical matter, it seems clear that shipping the goods will not normally deprive the 
seller of his lien if the goods are deliverable to him (or his order) under the bill of lading. In 
the absence of any contrary agreement, the seller may decline to transfer the bill of lading 
except against payment of the price.37 This difficult point of interpretation has arisen largely 
because, since the Act of 1893 was passed, the practice of treating the shipping documents 
as conferring possession and property has become so much more widespread that it now 
seems inconsistent with commercial practice to treat shipment of the goods as a delivery to 
the buyer.
Since possession is essential to the maintenance of a lien, it naturally follows that 
when the buyer or his agent lawfully obtains possession of the goods the lien is lost. It is 
submitted that ‘lawfully’ here means ‘with the consent of the seller’, so that even if the 
goods are obtained in circumstances amounting to a criminal offence, provided that it 
is with the consent of the seller, the lien will be lost. It is only by such an interpretation 
that the section can be brought into harmony with s. 25(1) of the Sale of Goods Act 
and s. 9 of the Factors Act which, as we have seen, enable a buyer in possession with 
the consent of the seller to pass a good title to a third party. Although it may be a little 
odd to say that a possession obtained in circumstances amounting to an offence may 
be ‘lawfully’ obtained, this interpretation seems more consonant with the rest of the 
Act and would probably be adopted.38 But if the buyer obtains possession of the goods 
35	 See above, pp. 266–8.
36	 Schmitthoff, The Sale of Goods (2nd edn, 1952, Sweet & Maxwell), pp. 158–9.
37	 If, by the bill of lading, the goods are deliverable to the buyer or his order, it would doubtless be more 
difficult for the seller to contend that he retained possession sufficient to maintain a lien, but the practice of 
demanding payment in exchange for the documents in international sales is so well established that, in the 
absence of a clear contrary intention, it would probably still be held that the seller could do this.
38	 See, e.g., Du Jardin v Beadman [1952] 2 QB 712 (above, p. 314), which is inconsistent with any suggestion 
that the lien would bind a bona fide purchaser to whom the buyer disposes of the goods after having obtained 
possession by a criminal trick or fraud. This is also confirmed by the New Zealand decision in Jeffcott v 
Andrews Motors Ltd [1960] NZLR 721, holding that the bona fide purchaser is protected without deciding 
whether the lien survives or not. Although it may be argued that this does not preclude the possibility of 
the lien surviving as between seller and buyer in such circumstances, it is difficult to see how the seller could 
enforce the lien or what significance the survival of the lien could have. But it is, perhaps, arguable that if the 
lien does survive, a disposition by the buyer to a third party who takes with notice of the circumstances will 
not override the seller’s lien.

	394	 The remedies of the seller
without the consent of the seller, the lien is not lost and, even if the property has passed 
to the buyer, it appears that he cannot pass a good title free from the lien to a third party.
It has already been suggested that the seller’s lien cannot avail him as against third 
parties taking in good faith even if he delivers the goods to the buyer merely as his agent 
or bailee.39 But it may be that in such a case, the seller will retain his lien as against the 
buyer, a point which is only likely to assume practical importance in somewhat unusual 
circumstances.40
The fourth way in which the seller may lose his lien is by waiver. In a certain sense, 
delivery of the goods to the buyer on credit is but an instance of waiver of the lien, but 
the seller may waive his lien without giving up possession at all. If, for example, the seller 
should ask the buyer’s permission to retain possession by way of temporary loan, he may 
be held to have waived his lien. Although s. 41(2) says that the seller may exercise his lien 
notwithstanding that he is in possession as the buyer’s bailee or agent, the subsection 
does not say that the seller may exercise his lien notwithstanding that he has impliedly 
waived his lien. And, if the seller, having originally refused to sell on credit, were later 
to agree to the buyer taking possession before payment, this would presumably amount 
to a waiver of the lien and the seller would not be able to change his mind again and 
insist on the lien after all.41 Moreover, if the seller wrongly deals with the goods in a 
manner inconsistent with the buyer’s rights, he is held to have waived his lien and cannot 
therefore plead lack of payment or tender if sued by the buyer in conversion.42
Section 43(1)(c), dealing with waiver, is probably to be read subject to s. 41(1)(b) and 
(c), which confer a lien where the goods are sold on credit but the term of credit has 
expired, or where the buyer has become insolvent, since both these clauses contemplate 
a situation in which there is a waiver followed by later events causing the lien to revive. 
If, therefore, the seller originally refuses credit but later waives his lien, it is probable that 
the subsequent insolvency of the buyer will cause the lien to revive if the seller is still in 
possession of the goods. This, at any rate, was the position at common law.43
The seller’s right of lien is not affected by any sub-sale or other disposition of the 
goods by the buyer unless he has assented thereto. The meaning of this has already 
been considered.44 It must also be remembered that if the seller allows the buyer to have 
possession of the documents of title or of the goods themselves, a transfer of these to an 
innocent third party will defeat the right of lien.
A seller who has once lost his lien does not regain it merely because he obtains 
possession of the goods once more.45 But a seller who exercises his right of stoppage in 
transit is in effect restored to his former position and regains his lien.
The exercise of the seller’s right of lien does not of itself rescind the contract of 
sale. This naturally follows from the fact that failure by the buyer to pay the price at

the agreed time is not a breach of condition which justifies the seller in repudiating the 
contract. This question will be more fully examined later.46
Unpaid seller’s right of stoppage in transit
The seller’s right of stoppage in transit is set out in s. 44:
Subject to this Act, when the buyer of goods becomes insolvent, the unpaid seller who has 
parted with the possession of the goods has the right of stopping them in transit, that is to say, 
he may resume possession of the goods as long as they are in course of transit, and may retain 
them until payment or tender of the price.
It makes no difference whether or not the property has passed to the buyer.47 Where the 
property has not passed the seller has, in virtue of his ownership, the power to stop the 
goods, and the Act makes the exercise of this power rightful as against the buyer; where 
the property has passed, the Act confers both the power and the right to stop.
The House of Lords introduced the doctrine of stoppage in transit into Scots common 
law in 1790, displacing previous doctrine in a case where a buyer who took delivery of 
goods within three days of stopping payment was presumed to have taken fraudulently, 
so that the seller could recover them against the buyer’s trustee in sequestration.48
It has been said that ‘the courts look with great favour on the right of stoppage in 
transit on account of its intrinsic justice’,49 and this is certainly borne out by judicial 
pronouncements.50 It seems to accord with commercial morality that the seller should be 
treated as, in a sense, a secured creditor, looking to the goods as his security, until they 
have finally passed into the possession of the buyer. In modern times, the development 
of the system of payment against documents and, in particular, of payment by bankers’ 
commercial credits has greatly reduced the importance of the right of stoppage.51 Where 
the price is to be paid in this way, the seller has little to fear from the threat of the buyer’s 
insolvency because the seller will retain the control of the goods through the documents 
of title until he is paid. The law relating to stoppage in transit is therefore only important 
where the sale is on credit and there are virtually no modern cases on the subject, though 
the possibility of the right being needed must sometimes arise in the case of sales to 
buyers in other European Union countries, where sales on open account are quite usual.
When right of stoppage arises
Before the seller can exercise his right of stoppage in transit, three conditions must 
be satisfied: first, the seller must be an unpaid seller within the meaning of the Act; 
secondly, the buyer must be insolvent and thirdly, the goods must be in course of transit. 
The first two of these have already been considered and it remains now to examine the

	396	 The remedies of the seller
meaning of the expression ‘course of transit’. The decisions at common law on this 
subject were very numerous and in 1877 Jessel MR said: ‘As to several of them there is 
great difficulty in reconciling them with principle; as to others, there is great difficulty 
in reconciling them with one another; and as to the whole, the law on this subject is in a 
very unsatisfactory state.’52 Section 45 of the Act makes a determined and, on the whole, 
successful attempt to reduce this chaos to a number of definite rules.
The goods are in transit when they have passed out of the possession of the seller into 
the possession of a carrier,53 but have not yet reached the possession of the buyer. Little 
difficulty is generally encountered with the question, ‘When does the transit commence?’, 
but one ambiguity must be cleared up. If the carrier is the seller’s own agent no question 
of the right of stoppage arises at all, for the goods, while in the possession of such agent, 
are still sufficiently in the possession of the seller to enable him to exercise his lien and 
he need not invoke the less extensive right of stoppage. The right of stoppage only arises 
when the carrier is an independent contractor who holds possession of the goods on his 
own behalf, as carrier.54
It is now necessary to examine the question, ‘When does the transit end?’ In the first 
place, it must be clearly understood that, although s. 32(1) says that delivery to a carrier 
is prima facie deemed to be delivery to the buyer, this is only a constructive and not an 
actual delivery, and it is only an actual delivery which ends the right of stoppage.55 If 
this were not so, of course, s. 32(1) would be inconsistent with the whole concept of 
stoppage in transit because this right postulates delivery to a carrier, but not delivery to 
the buyer. This much is clear from s. 45(1):
Goods are deemed to be in course of transit from the time when they are delivered to a carrier, 
or other bailee . . . for the purpose of transmission to the buyer, until the buyer, or his agent in 
that behalf, takes delivery of them from the carrier or other bailee . . .
Although, therefore, delivery to a carrier is not in itself delivery to the buyer for 
this purpose, there is no reason why the buyer should not be able to show that, in the 
particular circumstances of the case, the carrier was his agent and that, therefore, the 
transit was at an end, just as the seller can show that the carrier was his agent and that 
the transit had never started. This possibility is expressly recognised by s. 45(1), which 
refers to the buyer or ‘his agent’, and by s. 45(5) which says:
When goods are delivered to a ship chartered by the buyer it is a question depending on the 
circumstances of the particular case, whether they are in the possession of the master as a 
carrier, or as agent to the buyer.
52	 Merchant Banking Co Ltd v Phoenix Bessemer Steel Co Ltd (1877) 5 Ch D 205, 220.
53	 It has been held in New Zealand that the Post Office is not a carrier for this purpose and there is no right of 
stoppage over goods consigned by post: Postmaster-General v W H Jones & Co (London) Ltd [1957] NZLR 
829. The effect of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, s. 1(1) is that an attempt by the seller to 
intercept the goods once they have come into the hands of the Post Office would be a criminal offence.
54	 In Badische Anilin und Soda Fabrik v Basle Chemical Works Bindschender [1898] AC 200, it was held that 
the Post Office was the buyer’s agent, but, having regard to the rule stated in the previous footnote, even 
if this view were correct, it is in the present context of academic interest only. The rule for private postal 
carriers is presumably the same as that for other carriers, namely that the right of stoppage will only be 
needed when the carrier is the buyer’s agent.

Real remedies	 397
If the ship is owned by the buyer, clearly delivery of the goods to the master is a 
delivery to the buyer’s agent which terminates the transit. Likewise, if the ship is demised 
to the buyer so as to vest complete control over the vessel in the buyer, the master is 
treated as being employed by the buyer and then delivery to the ship is delivery to the 
buyer. But if the ship is merely chartered for a voyage or a fixed period, as is the usual 
case, the master remains the employee of the shipowner and does not become the agent 
of the buyer, so that delivery to the ship does not end the right of stoppage. If the seller 
is owner of the ship no question of the right of stoppage arises at all, of course, because 
the goods are still in the possession of the seller while on the ship.
The mere fact that the contract is for the sale of goods f.o.b. does not exclude the 
right of stoppage. Although the seller’s duty in a contract f.o.b. may be complete when 
he has placed the goods on board, this does not mean that he is not still interested in 
them and that he cannot subsequently stop them if the buyer becomes insolvent.56
Similarly, the transit is not at an end merely because it is the buyer who gives the 
instructions for the dispatch of the goods for part or all of the voyage. ‘Wherever it is 
part of the bargain between the vendor and the vendee that the transit shall last up to a 
certain time, the transit continues until that time has arrived.’57 But if the buyer requests 
delivery to a certain place or person, the transit does not continue merely because the 
buyer intends ultimately to give, but does in fact give, fresh directions for the dispatch of 
the goods elsewhere. The law on this point was summed up by Brett LJ (as he then was) 
in Bethell & Co Ltd v Clark & Co Ltd:58
Where the transit is a transit which has been caused either by the terms of the contract or by 
the directions of the purchaser to the vendor, the right of stoppage in transitu exists. But, if the 
goods are not in the hands of the carrier by reason either of the terms of the contract or of the 
directions of the purchaser to the vendor, but are in transitu afterwards in consequence of fresh 
directions given by the purchaser for a new transit, then such transit is no part of the original 
transit and the right to stop is gone. So also, if the purchaser gives orders that the goods shall 
be sent to a particular place, there to be kept till he gives fresh orders as to their destination to a 
new carrier, the original transit is at an end when they have reached that place.
It follows that, in the ordinary way, if the goods pass through successive stages of 
transit from one carrier to another in pursuance of the contract or of later directions 
given by the buyer to the seller, the transit continues and the seller retains his right to 
stop the goods until they reach their ultimate destination.59 But if the buyer intercepts 
the goods at some stage in the course of the transit the right to stop is lost. Thus, s. 45(2) 
says:
If the buyer or his agent in that behalf obtains delivery of the goods before their arrival at the 
appointed destination, the transit is at an end.

	398	 The remedies of the seller
Where, therefore, the seller of goods contracted to deliver them free of charge at the 
buyer’s premises in London, but the carriers delivered the goods at dock warehouses in 
accordance with instructions from the buyer, it was held that there was no right to stop.60
The transit is normally brought to an end by actual delivery of the goods to the 
buyer, but the transit is also determined if the carrier in effect attorns to the buyer, or 
acknowledges to him on arrival at the destination that it holds the goods for the buyer, 
or if it wrongfully refuses to deliver to the buyer. Thus, s. 45(3) and (6) say:
(3)	 If, after the arrival of the goods at the appointed destination, the carrier or other bailee . . . 
acknowledges to the buyer, or his agent, that he holds the goods on his behalf and contin-
ues in possession of them as bailee . . . for the buyer, or his agent, the transit is at an end, 
and it is immaterial that a further destination for the goods may have been indicated by the 
buyer.
(6)	 Where the carrier or other bailee . . . wrongfully refuses to deliver the goods to the buyer, or 
his agent in that behalf, the transit is deemed to be at an end.
Thus, where goods were sent by rail to a particular station, where the consignee 
signed a receipt but did not take away the goods, the transit was held to have ended, 
making a subsequent stop notice too late.61 If, however, the buyer rejects the goods the 
transit is not at an end, for s. 45(4) says:
(4)	 If the goods are rejected by the buyer, and the carrier or other bailee . . . continues in pos-
session of them, the transit is not deemed to be at an end, even if the seller has refused to 
receive them back.
It is not clear on the face of the Act whether subs. (4) is to be read subject to subs. 
(3) or vice versa. If the carrier informs the buyer that the goods have arrived and that it 
holds them on the buyer’s behalf and, subsequently, the buyer inspects the goods and 
rejects them, does the transit continue or not? As the Act is doubtful, resort may be had 
to the decisions at common law, and these seem to show that in such a case the transit 
is not ended because the carrier’s attornment (or acknowledgment) to the buyer only 
transfers the possession to the buyer on the assumption that the buyer assents thereto. 
Where he rejects the goods, the attornment62 (or acknowledgment) has no effect and the 
right to stop continues.
As with the seller’s lien, the right of stoppage may generally be exercised over part 
only of the goods where some other part has been delivered. Under s. 45(7):
Where part delivery of the goods has been made to the buyer, or his agent in that behalf, the 
remainder of the goods may be stopped in transit, unless such part delivery has been made 
under such circumstances as to show an agreement to give up possession of the whole of the 
goods.63

Real remedies	 399
It has been held in a Scots case that if the carrier ignores the stop notice and delivers 
to the buyer, the stoppage is defeated and the buyer’s trustee in sequestration can claim 
the goods; however, the carrier is liable in damages to the seller.64
Transfer of the bill of lading
Somewhat surprisingly, the Act does not make it clear whether the transfer of the bill of 
lading to the buyer is by itself sufficient to terminate the seller’s right of stoppage. The 
UCC (Art. 2-705(2)(d)) expressly provides that negotiation of any negotiable document 
of title to the buyer (which of course covers transfer of a bill of lading) terminates the 
right of stoppage. But it seems implicit in the Sale of Goods Act that mere transfer of the 
bill of lading to the buyer does not prevent the seller from stopping the goods in transit. 
Both s. 39(1) (which says that the seller’s real rights exist even though property may have 
passed) and s. 47(2) (which postulates a transfer of the bill of lading to the buyer and 
further dealings with the bill by the buyer) seem to assume that the right may continue 
even after the bill is transferred to the buyer. Yet it is surprising that there are no modern 
cases on the subject, and it may be that in practice, businessmen simply do not believe 
that they have the right to reclaim the goods from the carrier once they have transferred 
the bill of lading to a buyer even though he has bought on credit, and becomes insolvent 
before paying the price. Despite modern commercial practice, it must still sometimes 
happen that buyers buy on credit but become insolvent while the goods are at sea, and in 
this situation the right to stop could still be of practical importance.
But although the mere transfer of the bill of lading to the buyer may not defeat 
the right to stop the goods, the right may be lost by sub-dealings with the goods  
(or documents) by the buyer. Considerable difficulties have arisen here and it is essential 
to keep two points clearly distinct. The first question which arises is whether the sub-
buyer or pledgee is entitled to possession of the goods free from the seller’s right of 
stoppage, and the second question is whether, assuming the sub-buyer or pledgee to be 
so entitled, the seller can exercise his right of stoppage over the money paid by the sub-
buyer in the event of a sale, or over the goods subject to the pledgee’s rights in the event 
of a pledge. To take the latter possibility first, there can be no doubt that the seller can 
still exercise his right of stoppage, notwithstanding that the goods have been pledged, 
but, of course, he can only do so subject to the rights of the pledgee. In other words, 
the seller can claim the return of the goods from the carrier if he is prepared to pay off 
the pledgee. What is more, even if the pledgee obtains the goods in virtue of his pledge 
and sells them, the seller is entitled to claim that the balance of the price shall be paid 
directly to him and not to the insolvent buyer. This was decided by the House of Lords 
in Kemp v Falk65 and the decision has been incorporated in s. 47(2)(b) of the Act, which 
says that, where the documents of title to goods which the seller would otherwise be 
entitled to stop have been pledged, ‘the unpaid seller’s right of lien or stoppage in transit 
can only be exercised subject to the rights of the transferee’. It is true that this section 
is mainly concerned to give priority to the rights of the pledgee over those of the seller

	400	 The remedies of the seller
(hence the word ‘only’) but it seems necessarily to recognise that the right of stoppage 
may be exercised in these circumstances.
The problem is more difficult in the case of a sub-sale by the buyer. In Ex parte Golding 
Davies & Co Ltd,66 A sold goods to B and B resold them to C before they were dispatched 
by A. The bill of lading was taken in C’s name, but before it was transferred to C, B became 
insolvent. C not yet having paid the price, A claimed that he was entitled to intercept the 
money before it reached B; that is, in effect, A claimed the right of stoppage over the money. 
It was held by the Court of Appeal that A was entitled to do this.
In Kemp v Falk,67 Lord Selborne clearly thought that Ex parte Golding Davies & Co 
Ltd68 was wrongly decided, but the other members of the House in that case expressed 
no opinion on the point. Ex parte Golding Davies & Co Ltd is also not easy to reconcile 
with Berndtson v Strang.69 In this case, the Chancery Court of Appeal held that where 
goods are damaged in transit, the unpaid seller has no right to the proceeds of an 
insurance policy covering the goods. His right of stoppage ‘is a right to stop the goods in 
whatever state they are. If they arrive injured and damaged in bulk or quality the right to 
stop in transitu is so far impaired.’70 Presumably, it follows that if the goods are entirely 
lost in transit the right to stop is similarly lost, yet there seems no difference in principle 
between such a case and a resale of the goods.71 But even if Ex parte Golding Davies & 
Co Ltd72 was rightly decided at common law, the question must still be answered whether 
it survives the Sale of Goods Act, and the answer to this, it is conceived, must be ‘no’. 
Section 47(2)(a) says quite clearly that if the bill of lading is transferred by way of resale 
to a third party taking in good faith and for value, the unpaid seller’s right of stoppage 
‘is defeated’. No mention is made of the possibility of transferring the right from the 
goods to the money. It should also be borne in mind that even if the above submissions 
are wrong, and Ex parte Golding Davies & Co Ltd does represent the modern law, yet 
there can be no shadow of a claim of stoppage when the purchase price from the sub-
purchaser has actually been paid over to the insolvent buyer. This would be a blatant 
attempt to obtain full payment of a debt from an insolvent debtor and could not be 
permitted.
Position as between vendor and carrier
If a carrier, to whom a notice of stoppage has been sent, wrongly delivers the goods to 
the buyer, he is liable for conversion to the vendor, so it is of the utmost importance that 
the relationship between the carrier and the seller should be clearly defined. But the Act 
does no more than lay down the methods which the seller may adopt of exercising his 
right of stoppage, and imposes the burden of redelivery on the seller. Section 46 says:

70	 Per Lord Cairns at p. 591. But in most c.i.f. and many f.o.b. contracts, the policy would be taken out by the 
seller and he would therefore be able to claim the proceeds himself.
71	 Presumably the result would be different if the damage or loss occurred after the seller had given notice of 
exercise of the right of stoppage.

Real remedies	 401
(1)	 The unpaid seller may exercise his right of stoppage in transit either by taking actual  
possession of the goods, or by giving notice of his claim to the carrier or other bailee . . . in 
whose possession the goods are.
(2)	 The notice may be given either to the person in actual possession of the goods or to his 
principal.
(3)	 If given to the principal, the notice is ineffective unless given at such time and under such 
circumstances that the principal, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, may communi-
cate it to his servant or agent in time to prevent a delivery to the buyer.
(4)	 When notice of stoppage in transit is given by the seller to the carrier, or other bailee . . . in 
possession of the goods, he must redeliver the goods to, or according to the directions of, 
the seller; and the expenses of such redelivery must be borne by the seller.
The carrier has a lien on the goods for the freight due, and this takes priority over the 
seller’s right of stoppage. Hence, the carrier can refuse to redeliver the goods to the seller 
unless the latter is first prepared to discharge the amount of the freight. But any general 
lien which the carrier may have by contract is postponed to the seller’s right of stoppage 
unless the seller was a party to the contract which conferred this general lien.73 A general 
lien, that is, a right to retain the goods for other freights due upon other transactions, 
can only arise by express contract or from general usage, and such a lien, apart from 
contract, cannot affect the rights of the consignor.74
In some respects, the carrier’s lien as against the unpaid seller is of a peculiar nature, 
as it confers on him the positive right of action to recover the amount of the freight. 
Moreover, an unpaid seller who stops the goods in transit is under a duty to give the 
carrier instructions as to the disposal or return of the goods and, if he fails to do so, the 
carrier is not responsible for the consequences.75
As is the case with the seller’s lien, the exercise of the right of stoppage in transit 
does not of itself rescind the contract of sale. The exercise of the right to stop enables 
the seller to resume possession of the goods and to retain them until payment or tender 
of the price.76 It follows that if the buyer’s trustee in bankruptcy chooses to tender the 
whole price, the seller is bound to accept it and redispatch the goods to him, unless 
indeed there are grounds for inferring a repudiation of the contract by the buyer.
Unpaid seller’s right of resale
It has already been pointed out that the seller’s power of resale must be carefully 
distinguished from his right of resale. The seller has the power to resell the goods (a) if 
he still has the property in the goods, or (b) if, even though the property has passed, he 
is in possession of the goods within s. 24 of the Sale of Goods Act or s. 8 of the Factors 
Act, or (c) if, even though the property has passed, the seller has exercised his right of 
lien or stoppage in transit. The first case does not call for comment, and the second has 
already been fully discussed, but the third needs to be briefly considered. Section 48(2) 
says:
73	 See US Steel Products Co Ltd v Great Western Rly [1916] 1 AC 189.
74	 Ibid.
75	 Booth SS Co Ltd v Cargo Fleet Iron Co Ltd [1916] 2 KB 570.
76	 Section 44.

	402	 The remedies of the seller
Where an unpaid seller who has exercised his right of lien . . . or stoppage in transit re-sells the 
goods, the buyer acquires a good title to them as against the original buyer.
This presumably means that, even though the property has passed to the first buyer, 
if the seller exercises his right of lien or stoppage, he has the power to resell the goods 
passing a good title to a third party although he could not have done so under s. 24 
of the Sale of Goods Act and s. 8 of the Factors Act. In other words, this subsection 
envisages the possibility of a resale by a seller not in possession of the goods, and is to 
that extent wider than these two sections.
It is now necessary to examine the seller’s right of resale. The seller is entitled as 
against the buyer to resell the goods in any of the following circumstances:
1	 If the seller’s obligation to deliver has not yet crystallised into an obligation to deliver 
any specific goods. Here it is clear that the seller incurs no liability if he resells the 
goods for the simple reason that it cannot be said which are ‘the goods’ which he must 
deliver.
2	 If the buyer repudiates the contract, it is again clear on principle that the seller can 
accept the repudiation and may resell the goods if he chooses.77 It is, of course, imma-
terial whether or not the property has passed to the first buyer. Refusal to accept 
the goods by the buyer is prima facie a repudiation of the contract, and if the seller 
accepts that repudiation, the contract is thereby rescinded, any title which has passed 
to the buyer will revest in the seller, and the seller may resell the goods and sue for 
damages for non-acceptance. If, however, the seller refuses to accept the repudiation, 
then prima facie he is not entitled to resell the goods. This is because either the prop-
erty will have passed to the buyer or the seller will still be bound to transfer it to the 
buyer. In this situation, the seller can only resell if authorised to do so by s. 48(3) or 
(4), which are discussed below.78 As we have seen, the mere fact that the buyer is late in 
paying the price is not necessarily a repudiation of the contract, but may only amount 
to a breach of warranty for which the seller may recover damages, so late payment of 
itself does not justify a resale by the seller unless s. 48(3) or (4) is satisfied, except in 
cases where time of payment is of the essence.
3	 In the third place, the seller has a right of resale if he has expressly reserved this right 
in the original contract, on default by the buyer. In this event, s. 48(4) comes into play:
Where the seller expressly reserves the right of re-sale in case the buyer should make default, 
and on the buyer making default re-sells the goods, the original contract of sale is rescinded, 
but without prejudice to any claim the seller may have for damages.
As we have seen, s. 48(1) states that:
Subject to this section, a contract of sale is not rescinded by the mere exercise by an unpaid 
seller of his right of lien . . . or stoppage in transit.
4	 Lastly, the unpaid seller is given a right of resale if the buyer fails to pay the price, 
and the goods are perishable or, in other cases, if he gives notice to the buyer that he

intends to resell, and the buyer still does not pay the price due. Section 48(3) states 
that:
Where the goods are of a perishable nature, or where the unpaid seller gives notice to the buyer 
of his intention to re-sell, and the buyer does not within a reasonable time pay or tender the 
price, the unpaid seller may re-sell the goods and recover from the original buyer damages for 
any loss occasioned by his breach of contract.
The first of these four possibilities has already been discussed and the second does 
not need enlarging upon here. The question what exactly amounts to a repudiation of 
the contract is never an easy one, but it is a question which belongs more properly to the 
general law of contract. It is enough here to say that the party claiming that the contract 
has been repudiated must show that the other party has made it quite plain that he will 
not79 or cannot80 perform his obligations. The third and fourth cases, however, require 
further consideration.
Resale under s. 48(3) or (4)
It will be noted that s. 48(4) explicitly provides that, where the seller resells in the 
exercise of an express power of resale in the contract, then ‘the original contract of sale 
is rescinded’. Section 48(3) contains no such provision to cover the case where the goods 
are perishable or where the seller resells after notice. In Gallagher v Shilcock,81 it was 
held by Finnemore J that this meant that a sale under s. 48(3) did not rescind the original 
contract of sale. Accordingly, if the property in the goods had already passed to the 
buyer, then the seller was reselling the buyer’s goods and was acting as a quasi-pledgee 
rather than as an owner. Hence, the buyer remained liable for the price (subject to credit 
for the resale price) and would indeed have been entitled to claim any profit made if the 
resale were at a higher price.
This decision was unsatisfactory in many ways and it was overruled by the Court 
of Appeal in R V Ward Ltd v Bignall.82 In this case, the plaintiffs sold two used cars to 
the defendant, who almost at once repudiated the purchase and refused to pay or take 
delivery of the goods. The sellers at first wrote to the buyer insisting that the property 
in both cars had passed to him and that he was therefore liable for the price. But the 
sellers also gave notice that if the buyer did not pay the price within five days they would 
resell the cars. The buyer did not pay and the sellers only succeeded in reselling one car. 
They therefore sued for the price of the other plus their loss on the resale of the first car. 
The court held that the sellers were not entitled to the price of the remaining car as the 
resale of the first had rescinded the original contract. Hence, the buyer was only liable 
for damages for non-acceptance, assessed in the usual way as the difference between the 
contract price and the market price of the remaining car.
The court explained away the difference in the wording of s. 48(3) and (4) on somewhat 
ingenious grounds. Failure by the buyer to pay the price is not per se a breach which

82	 [1967] 1 QB 534.

	404	 The remedies of the seller
justifies repudiation, but once the seller has given notice to the buyer to pay, time is made 
of the essence of the contract. Hence, failure to pay now amounts to repudiation and the 
seller accepts this by reselling the goods. The resale therefore necessarily amounts to a 
rescission of the contract, property revests in the seller and the buyer is no longer liable 
for the price. If, however, the contract contains an express provision for resale, then such 
a resale (apart from s. 48(4)) would not necessarily amount to rescission. For in this 
event, the resale would be an exercise of a contractual right and not an acceptance of 
repudiation by the buyer. Therefore, s. 48(4) expressly provides that resale is a rescission 
of the contract. Thus, the reason for the contrast is not that s. 48(3) is intended to have a 
different result – in both cases the resale rescinds the original contract – but the express 
provision to this effect is not necessary in s. 48(3), while it was thought necessary in  
s. 48(4).
In order to avoid confusion, it must now be pointed out that the statutory use of the 
term ‘rescission’ in s. 48 is out of line with the modern usage adopted by the House 
of Lords in Johnson v Agnew.83 In this case, a sharp line was drawn for English law 
between rescission of a contract ab initio on grounds of contractual invalidity such as 
fraud or duress, and termination of the contract for breach. Only the former is strictly 
‘rescission’ which has retrospective effect.84 Termination for breach is not retrospective 
in operation, and leaves standing, not only claims for damages for the breach itself but 
also claims which have already accrued due at the time the contract is terminated. Now, 
clearly, a failure to pay the price, and a subsequent resale of the goods by the seller under 
s. 48(3) or (4), involve termination and not rescission in this terminology. The seller still 
has a claim for damages for breach of contract, and accrued claims may survive the 
termination. At the same time, it must be pointed out that even termination must have 
some retrospective effects in a contract of sale of goods, a point which the House of 
Lords appear to have overlooked in Johnson v Agnew, and perhaps even more seriously 
in Hyundai Heavy Industries Co Ltd v Papadopoulos.85 The termination of a contract 
of sale of goods almost always involves the restoration of the property in the goods from 
the buyer to the seller if the property has already passed, and to that extent a termination 
is just as retrospective as a rescission; similarly, if the property has not yet passed when 
the contract is terminated, the seller’s duty to pass the property disappears, even though 
the duty existed before the contract was terminated.86
Who is entitled to profit on resale?
The decision in R V Ward Ltd v Bignall87 means that when the unpaid seller resells the 
goods, either under s. 48(3) or (4), he sells on his own account, and not in the sort of 
quasi-pledgee capacity envisaged by Finnemore J in Gallagher v Shilcock.88 This means 
that if the seller actually succeeds in reselling the goods at a higher price he will retain

any profit thereby made. In the ordinary case, that seems a perfectly sensible result; 
indeed, the contrary result suggested in Gallagher v Shilcock is absurd. It would be 
outrageous if a buyer who has defaulted in his obligations was entitled to collect from 
the seller the additional profit earned by the seller’s efforts in reselling the goods.
However, this result may be less absurd and outrageous in one particular type of case. 
Where the seller sells and delivers goods to the buyer under a ‘reservation of title’ clause, 
giving the buyer the right to deal with the goods in the ordinary course of business, 
but reserving the right to reclaim the goods if the buyer fails to pay or to meet other 
conditions, the contract clearly envisages the possibility that the seller may sometimes 
reclaim and then resell the goods. Even in this situation, if the seller first terminates the 
contract before reclaiming and reselling the goods, it seems clear that the buyer cannot 
claim any surplus profit made on the resale.89
But in Clough Mill Ltd v Martin,90 the Court of Appeal assumed that such a resale 
of the goods could take place without a rescission (or termination) of the contract, and 
that the seller would then have to account to the buyer for any surplus made by him on 
the resale. Unfortunately, no reference was made in this case to s. 48(4) of the Act, which 
prima facie at any rate suggests that this is incorrect because the subsection appears 
to insist that in this situation the contract is rescinded. Possibly, the analysis in Clough 
Mill Ltd v Martin could be supported by arguing that there is in this case an implied 
term which negatives s. 48(4) and enables the resale to take place without rescission of 
the original contract. Moreover, there might be good sense in this in the case where the 
seller reclaims and resells under a reservation of title clause, as the right of the seller to 
reclaim and resell the goods is very much in the nature of a mortgage or charge. So it is 
not unreasonable in this case that the first buyer should be entitled to claim the profit 
on the resale. It is no different, in substance, from the position which arises where the 
buyer of a house defaults, and the house is sold by the mortgagee: here also the buyer 
is entitled to any surplus gain made on the resale, even though he may have defaulted 
in payment of the very first instalment on the mortgage. Paradoxically, though, Clough 
Mill Ltd v Martin is the leading authority for saying that a reservation of title clause 
does not operate like a mortgage or charge but is to be treated as a straightforward sale 
on special terms. There seems, in truth, to be an irreconcilable conflict at the root of this 
case, which is discussed further under the next heading.
Claim by seller in respect of payments due before rescission
Recently, another difficult problem has also surfaced in connection with the effects of 
a resale. If the seller resells the goods can he still sue the buyer for any part of the price 
which was payable before the contract of sale was rescinded? If the seller resells at a loss, 
this question is not of great importance because the seller is entitled to damages for the 
buyer’s breach, and the damages should fully compensate him for his loss anyhow. But 
if the seller resells at a profit, or if he resells at a loss which is less than the sum which 
should have been paid by the buyer before rescission, the question does assume practical 
89	 See Clough Mill Ltd v Martin [1984] 3 All ER 982.
90	 See n. 89.

	406	 The remedies of the seller
importance. Indeed, the question recently arose in a difficult case91 which requires 
further consideration, but is more conveniently dealt with at a later point.92
Reservation of title clauses
Reservation of title clauses and real remedies
A common feature of modern commercial contracts of sale is ‘reservation of title’ 
clauses (sometimes called Romalpa clauses, after the first case upholding their utility).93 
Some of these clauses are of considerable complexity, and there are many different 
versions in use, but the essence of a reservation of title clause is to reserve the property 
in the goods to the seller until the price is paid in full, notwithstanding that the goods 
are delivered to the buyer. The purpose of such a clause is, of course, to confer upon the 
seller some degree of security against the insolvency of the buyer. Prima facie at least, 
if the buyer becomes insolvent before the price is fully paid, the seller will be able to 
reclaim possession of the goods. From a functional or commercial viewpoint, therefore, 
reservation of title clauses operate like a more extended version of the real rights of 
lien and stoppage in transit. The lien operates while the seller is still in possession, the 
right of stoppage after he has dispatched the goods but before they have arrived, and a 
reservation of title clause operates after the goods have actually been delivered to the 
buyer. But a reservation of title clause must be expressly imposed;94 there is no implied 
real right to reclaim goods from the buyer once they have been delivered merely because 
the price has not been paid. In theory, such a right might exist even without express 
reservation if there are any grounds for arguing in some particular case that property 
has not passed on or before delivery, but it would be rare indeed that property does not 
pass at the latest on delivery, in the absence of some express provision to this effect. So 
it can be assumed for all practical purposes that a reservation of title clause must be 
expressly imposed if the seller is to retain any title after delivery.95
Resale of goods by buyer
In principle, there is nothing new about the possibility of the seller trying to reserve title 
after delivery, by way of security. Indeed, the hire-purchase contract is a familiar device 
to achieve the same effect, though the use of such contracts has largely been confined 
to consumer transactions. But modern reservation of title clauses are being widely used 
in commercial sales rather than consumer sales;96 they also differ from hire-purchase 
91	 Damon Cia Naviera v Hapag-Lloyd [1985] 1 All ER 475.
92	 See below, p. 554.
93	 See Aluminium Industrie v Romalpa Aluminium Ltd [1976] 1 WLR 676. The power to reserve title derives 
from ss. 17 and 19 of the Sale of Goods Act – Ch. 13.
94	 In contracts for the sale of specific goods the reservation of title clause generally must be contained in 
the contract of sale; otherwise property in the goods will usually pass as provided by s. 18, Rule 1. In the 
case of unascertained goods, however, s. 19(1) gives the power to impose a reservation in the terms of the 
appropriation of the goods to the contract – see Bradgate [1988] JBL 477.
95	 For a succinct overview of the Scottish authorities, see Reid, The Law of  Property in Scotland (1996, 
Butterworths/Law Society of Scotland), para. 638.
	 96	 But they are also found in some consumer contracts: e.g., sales of domestic fuel oil.

	
	 	
Real remedies	 407
contracts in that they usually relate to goods not designed for consumer use, and therefore 
not suitable for contracts of hire. For example, cases have involved aluminium foil sold 
to be manufactured into other goods, resin sold for the manufacture of chipboards, 
leather sold to be made into handbags and so on. Furthermore, these modern clauses 
often permit or authorise the buyer to use the goods in the process of manufacture, and 
also to resell the goods in the course of business. Such clauses therefore differ from hire-
purchase contracts under which the hirer is not entitled to resell the goods, and, if he 
does, cannot pass a title to them, except in the case of motor vehicles to which Part III of 
the Hire-Purchase Act 1964 applies.97
A reservation of title clause will not usually restrict the buyer’s right to resell the 
goods in the course of his business because that is not the purpose behind the clause.98 
So such clauses quite often expressly authorise the buyer to resell, though there may 
be restrictions on his right to resell on credit. And even in the absence of an express 
authority to resell, such an authority will often be readily implied from the very nature 
of the transaction as a whole.99 In Four Point Garage Ltd v Carter,100 the sellers were 
motor dealers who supplied cars to a company under a reservation of title clause. This 
company was believed by the suppliers to be in the business of letting cars on hire, rather 
than reselling them, but it was nonetheless held that between two commercial concerns 
like this, a power of resale would readily be implied, and therefore a buyer in good faith 
from the company obtained a good title binding on the suppliers even though they had 
never been paid for the vehicle in question.
Even where the reservation of title clause does impose restrictions on the resale of 
the goods, they will not be of any avail against a purchaser without notice. As we have 
already seen, a buyer in possession of the goods has the power to pass a good title to a 
purchaser for value without notice under s. 25 of the Sale of Goods Act and s. 9 of the 
Factors Act,101 and it has been stressed that a sub-buyer is not to be treated as having 
notice of restrictions on the power of sale contained in a Romalpa clause merely because 
he failed to make inquiry about the buyer’s right to resell.102 In commercial contexts, a 
buyer is not generally under any duty to inquire into the seller’s right to sell the goods. 
Doubtless there may occasionally be special circumstances putting the buyer on inquiry, 
or he may have actual notice of a Romalpa type clause restricting the seller’s power of 
resale, but in that event the buyer has only himself to blame if he buys without ensuring 
that the seller complies with the requirements of the Romalpa clause.
The situation where the buyer resells is covered by s. 25(1) of the Sale of Goods Act, 
and s. 2(1) of the Factors Act. But what is the situation where the buyer merely agrees 
to resell? This would be the situation where the buyer sold on to a sub-buyer who took 
possession under a reservation of title clause. Section 25(1) does not cover that situation, 
but s. 9 of the Factors Act applies, as we have seen,103 where the goods are obtained

under any ‘agreement [emphasis supplied] for sale, pledge or other disposition’. But the 
effect of that provision is that the delivery or transfer in favour of a bona fide purchaser 
has the same effect as if the person making the delivery or transfer were a mercantile 
agent in possession with the consent of the owner,104 and s. 2(1) of the Factors Act, 
which deals with the powers of a mercantile agent in possession, only provides that any 
sale etc. by a mercantile agent in possession with the consent of the owner shall be as 
valid as if the mercantile agent were authorised by the owner. In Re Highway Foods 
International Ltd,105 it was held that in such a situation the original seller could claim  
title to the goods.106 The sub-buyer would only acquire title on payment of the price to 
the buyer.
Claims to the goods themselves
In the most straightforward case, the reservation of title clause applies to specific goods 
which remain identifiable as the goods sold after they have been delivered to the buyer. 
This sort of clause is effective to reserve title to the seller under ss. 17(1) and 19(1) of the 
Act. The passing of property in the goods is conditional on the payment of the price, 
and there is nothing contrary to the law in the parties making a contract to that effect. 
Nor, as we shall see more fully below, does this case raise any problems as to the need for 
registration of the clause as a mortgage or charge (though this in reality is what is being 
created).107 In law, the clause is not regarded as a mortgage or charge which might require 
registration, but simply as an ordinary contractual provision deferring the passing of 
the property until certain conditions have been complied with. The seller is doing no 
more than ss. 17(1) and 19(1) permit. A company can create a charge only on its own 
property, and if it never acquires property in the goods the subject of an agreement for 
sale, it cannot charge them. In short, the courts have chosen to look at form rather than 
substance.108 Usually, these conditions are that the price must have been fully paid, but it 
is now common to enlarge the conditions by requiring that all outstanding indebtedness 
of the buyer to the seller should be discharged before the property can pass – 
the so-called ‘all moneys’ clause. Thus – assuming always that the goods sold retain their 
identity and are still in the possession of the buyer – the seller is able to reserve title in 
all the goods sold by him to the buyer until all the prices due are fully paid. So where a 
seller makes regular deliveries to the buyer under contracts containing such a clause, the 
property in the very first delivery may be retained long after the buyer has paid the full 
price of that delivery, so long only as some part of the price of subsequent deliveries 
is not yet paid.109 In Armour v Thyssen Edelstahlwerke,110 the House of Lords, whilst

upholding an ‘all moneys’ clause, did not answer as the facts of the case did not give rise 
to the problem, what the situation would have been if the seller had used the clause as 
a basis for repossessing paid-for goods, as well as unpaid-for goods.111 Arguably, in this 
situation the seller would be required to refund the price of the paid-for goods, on the 
ground of a total failure of consideration, so that the clause would be self-defeating. On 
the other hand, if the clause operated as a charge the seller would in principle be able 
to satisfy its debt without an obligation to refund the price of the paid-for goods.112 In 
short, this would suggest that such clauses should be treated as charges.
Claims to the proceeds of resale
Thus far, matters are reasonably simple. Complications start when a seller attempts to 
draft the relevant clause so as to give him some security even after the goods have been 
resold. As already mentioned, reservation of title clauses are not designed to prevent the 
buyer reselling the goods in the ordinary course of his business: to do that would freeze 
the buyer’s business and frustrate the whole point of buying the goods. But a reservation 
of title clause may attempt to transfer the seller’s preferential rights from the goods 
themselves to the proceeds of sale received by the buyer. For example, the clause may 
provide that all moneys received by the buyer through disposal of the goods in question 
are to belong in equity to the seller and to be paid into a separate bank account which 
is to be held on trust for the seller.113 In the Romalpa case itself, the plaintiffs had sold 
large quantities of aluminium foil to the defendants on the terms that property was to 
remain in the plaintiffs until full payment was made. The defendants got into financial 
difficulties and a receiver was appointed. He found some £50,000 worth of foil still in 
the possession of the defendants, and he received from sub-buyers a further £35,000 
odd, representing the price of goods made out of the foil and sold to sub-buyers. There 
was no problem as to the £50,000. This represented the foil which still belonged to the 
plaintiffs, and it could not be disputed that it was their foil. But even the £35,000 was 
held to be claimable by the plaintiffs on the ground that the defendants had been mere 
bailees of the foil, which they had sold with the implied authority of the owners,114 and 
for which they had therefore to account in equity. At first instance, Mocatta J held that 
no registrable charge arose and this question was not further discussed on appeal.
The result was in many respects extremely artificial. The decision of the Court of 
Appeal involved the conclusion that all the money received by the defendants from 
resale of the goods had to be held on trust for the plaintiffs, including even the profit 
made by the defendants from making and reselling these goods. Had the plaintiffs 
strictly enforced their right to have this money paid into a separate bank account, 
therefore, none of it would have been available for use by the defendants (except to pay 
the plaintiffs). It is very unlikely that the parties actually contemplated that the money

114	 See above, p. 407.

	410	 The remedies of the seller
would be used in this way: clearly the plaintiffs did not want to interfere with the daily 
business activities of the defendants, they merely wanted to be able to step in when 
the defendants’ financial position became precarious and then seize hold of whatever 
could be found. Furthermore, the equitable ownership of the proceeds of sale which the 
plaintiffs claimed and which the Court of Appeal upheld was also artificial. Obviously, 
if these proceeds had actually exceeded the sums due to the plaintiffs, nobody intended 
that the plaintiffs could keep the excess. This fact alone demonstrates that what was 
really involved here was a mortgage or charge, since the plaintiffs were only entitled to 
the proceeds of sale insofar as they were necessary to pay off what was due to them. But 
that conclusion would have involved recognition that the arrangement was registrable 
as the grant of a mortgage or charge under the Companies Act,115 the requirements of 
which are further discussed below, and yet this was not the outcome of the case, partly 
because the question was not even argued in the Court of Appeal.
The Romalpa case itself is therefore a somewhat unsatisfactory authority, and it is not 
surprising that some subsequent cases should have restricted the authority of that case.116 
These restrictions have so far taken two forms. First, it has been stressed that in the Romalpa 
case it was conceded that the defendants were bailees of the aluminium foil, so that there was 
some justification for the argument that the resale of the goods by the buyer involved a sale 
of the plaintiff’s goods, and could therefore give rise to a duty to account for the price, the 
proceeds belonging in equity to the sellers.117 But the usual relationship created by a contract 
of sale, even subject to a reservation of title clause, does not involve a bailment. The mere 
fact that the seller may in some circumstances be entitled to reclaim the goods does not make 
the transaction a bailment. The relationship between the parties is simply that of buyer and 
seller, and if the buyer is authorised to resell the goods, the normal implication is that he has 
no duty to account for the proceeds or to treat them in any particular way.118
Even if the relationship between the parties can be said to be, or to involve, a 
bailment, it does not follow that there is a fiduciary duty on the buyer which gives the 
seller the right to claim the proceeds of sale in equity. Not all bailees have such fiduciary 
obligations; whether such an obligation is to be imposed depends upon the implications 
to be made in the contract,119 but prima facie at least, it seems that there will be no 
duty to account for the proceeds unless the contract imposes some obligations on the 
buyer to deal with them in a particular way,120 or expressly confers equitable rights to the 
proceeds of sale on the original seller, as in the Romalpa case itself.
In this connection, a claim by the seller runs into certain practical difficulties of 
proof, unless there are express clauses covering the proceeds of resale. If the seller argues

that the buyer was under some implied duty to account for the proceeds in a particular 
way, he will be faced with the difficulty that it is unlikely that the parties intended the 
whole of the proceeds of sale to be dealt with in this way. Probably, the parties expected 
the buyer to keep for himself the difference between the sale and the resale prices. But if 
the seller concedes that the buyer only had to account for a part of the proceeds of the 
resale, this militates against any suggestion of a fiduciary relationship in the first place. 
It more clearly points to a simple debtor–creditor relationship.
Another restriction on the effect of the Romalpa case has also become apparent 
where claims are made against the proceeds of sale. A bailment involves that there may 
be some circumstances in which the bailee is obliged to redeliver the very same goods 
to the bailor. So if it appears from the nature of the goods that there will never be any 
such redelivery, the transaction simply cannot be a bailment (no matter what the parties 
may have called it); it must be a sale, and any attempt by the seller to claim title over 
the proceeds of resale – even if otherwise valid between the parties – will be a charge or 
mortgage requiring registration. This point is dealt with again later.
Transferred claims to other goods
Reservation of title clauses frequently give the seller not only the right to treat the 
very goods sold as still belonging to him but also the right to claim any other goods 
as his property, where those other goods have been made with the goods sold.121 The 
question of whether goods which have been used in some manufacturing process still 
exist in the goods produced by that process is one of fact and degree not susceptible of 
much exposition.122 Where yarn was sold to buyers for the purposes of being made into 
material, the sellers’ conditions of contract reserved the title in the yarn until the sellers 
were paid, but also declared that any material made out of the yarn should belong to the 
sellers until they were paid.123 The problem here is that the seller will obtain the benefit 
of the value the buyer has added to the goods. In consequence, such a clause is arguably 
a charge registrable under the Companies Act (as to which see below). Difficulties can 
also arise where (as can easily happen) two or more sellers sell materials under similar 
(or perhaps different) reservation of title clauses, and the goods of all these sellers are 
ultimately incorporated in some new goods made by the buyers.124 So far, this particular 
121	 It would seem that in the absence of clear provision, retention of title clauses will be construed narrowly. 
So where live animals were supplied to an abattoir, the terms ‘livestock’ and ‘goods’ applied only to the 
live animals, not to their carcasses – Chaigley Farms Ltd v Crawford Kaye & Grayshire Ltd (t/a Leylands)

Ct NSW) per Sheller, Beazley and Stein JJA.
123	 See Clough Mill Ltd v Martin [1984] 3 All ER 982.
124	 The situation may be different where goods of two or more sellers are only co-mingled, and the co-mingled 
goods form a separate and identifiable bulk. In Indian Oil Corp Ltd v Greenstone Shipping [1988] QB 345 it 
was held that where oil was mixed with a quantity belonging to another party already in a ship’s hold, the 
resulting mixture was held in common, and the innocent party was entitled to receive out the same quantity 
of goods which went in. In Re Stapylton Fletcher [1994] 1 WLR 1181 it was held that property in a number 
of cases of wine, separately stored for a group of customers, had passed as the goods were ascertained for 
the purposes of s.16, the customers owning as tenants in common. It would appear to follow from this that 
each seller of goods under a reservation of title clause would, in a similar situation, have an undivided share 
in the whole of the resulting product.

	412	 The remedies of the seller
sort of problem has not come before the courts, but several other difficulties have come 
to light from these extended reservation of title clauses.
In Borden (UK) Ltd v Scottish Timber Products Ltd,125 plaintiffs sold resin to the 
defendants which the defendants (as the plaintiffs knew) used in the manufacture of 
chipboard. A simple reservation of title clause provided that the property in the resin was 
to remain in the sellers until they were fully paid. It was held by the Court of Appeal that 
the sellers could have no claims to the chipboard in which the resin was incorporated. 
The resin itself had ceased to exist as an independent commodity. Consequently, there 
was no property of the sellers which they could claim; no question arose of a charge 
under the Companies Act. The plaintiffs’ claim failed at an earlier point, since there was 
no property on which they could even claim a charge.
The reservation of title clause in this case did not contain an extended provision 
declaring that any goods made with, or incorporating, the resin were also to be the 
property of the sellers, even in equity. It seems, however, that even such a clause is unlikely 
to save the seller where a significant change in the identity of the goods is contemplated 
by the parties. In Re Peachdart Ltd,126 sellers sold leather to a company who used it 
for the manufacture of handbags. The contract contained a reservation of title clause 
providing that (a) all unworked leather remained the property of the sellers until full 
payment, (b) the ownership of goods made out of the leather was to vest in the sellers, 
and (c) the sellers were to have the right to trace the proceeds of sale of the handbags. It 
was held that, despite the language of the parties, the intention must have been that the 
sellers should lose their exclusive ownership in each piece of the leather as soon as work 
on it was commenced by the buyers. The sellers’ rights would therefore become, at that 
point, rights in the nature of a mortgage or charge, and this was therefore registrable, 
and, being unregistered, it was void.
It follows from the above that use of a reservation of title clause in a repair contract, 
which purports to give the repairer ownership of the article into which any parts he 
has supplied have been incorporated, is unlikely to achieve its object. In Specialist Plant 
Services Ltd v Braithwaite Ltd,127 it was held that a clause of this sort created a charge, 
which was void for non-registration. Where the goods become fixtures on installation, 
the seller’s title is destroyed, because the principle quicquid plantatur solo, solo cedit 
applies.128

Charges registrable under the Companies Act
The prime purpose of a reservation of title clause, as we have now seen, is to protect 
the seller against the insolvency of the buyer. For practical or commercial purposes, it is 
equivalent to a mortgage or charge upon the goods. However, there are policy arguments 
against permitting a seller to have the benefit of such a mortgage or charge because 
its main effect is simply to give the seller priority over other creditors of the buyer in 
the event of the buyer’s insolvency, and the law does not generally permit one creditor 
to obtain preferential treatment in this way unless the prior charge or mortgage is 
publicised by some form of registration.
In order to prevent a creditor from obtaining priority in this way, therefore, there 
are a number of statutory provisions requiring the registration of transactions under 
which a person grants a mortgage or charge over property while retaining the possession 
of that property. Under the Bills of Sale Act a person who sells goods and remains in  
possession, or grants a mortgage or charge over goods by way of security, may have to 
register the bill of sale under which the transaction is effected or evidenced. In practice, 
these provisions are today important because they are applied to companies by s. 859A 
of the Companies Act 2006,129 which requires particulars of a charge to be delivered to 
the Registrar of Companies.130 This includes charges over goods.131 So a frequent problem 
arising from Romalpa clauses is to know whether they should have been registered under 
these provisions. If particulars of a charge have not been delivered to Companies House 
within 21 days of their creation, it is void as against creditors or the liquidator of the 
company.132 So even though the reservation of title clause may be effective as between 
the seller and the buyer, the clause will fail in its main purpose – that is to protect the 
seller against the risk of the buyer’s insolvency – where it should have been registered 
but was not. Particulars of few of these clauses are actually likely to have been sent to 
Companies House, so once it is held that the seller’s rights are registrable, the result is 
usually that the seller will fail to get the priority that he seeks as against a liquidator or 
other creditors of the buyers.
A reservation of title clause is clearly an attempt to evade the registration requirements 
of the Companies Act because its commercial purpose is to grant the seller preferential 
treatment in the insolvency of the buyer. And any rational system of registration of 
charges clearly ought to cover reservation of title clauses, as is done, for instance, by 
Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, but so far this result has not been achieved 
here. The courts have themselves deprecated any suggestion that these clauses should 
be narrowly construed or be treated with reserve because they escape the registration 
requirements.133 It has so far been insisted that the parties are entirely free to make 
whatever contracts they wish on whatever terms they choose and that there is nothing 
129	 Companies Act 2006, s. 859A, which is the first section in a new Chapter A1 inserted into Part 25 of the 
Companies Act by the Companies Act (Amendment of Part 25) Regulations 2013 (SI 2013/600). These 
new provisions replace the previous Chapters 1 and 2, which applied to England and Wales, and Scotland, 
respectively.

illegitimate about the result if they succeed in evading the requirements of registration. 
Indeed, under the Directive on late payments in commercial transactions134 between 
enterprises in the private sector, and between such enterprises and the public sector, 
member states are required to take appropriate steps to ensure that national legislation 
contains provisions according to which the seller can retain title to the goods sold until 
the buyer has made payment and be able to recover them until payment is made.135
But all this seems most unsatisfactory. Total freedom of contract is inappropriate 
where the whole purpose of the contract is to affect the rights of third parties who have 
no say in the contract.136
However, for the present, the law does not generally require reservation of title clauses 
to be registered. The technical reason given for this, as we have seen, is that the effect of 
such a clause is simply to prevent the property from passing to the buyer in the first place. 
He is not in the position of a person who is owner of the goods, and thereafter grants a 
mortgage or charge over them.137 The analysis of the situation made by the courts is thus 
highly formal – the terms of the contract are given full effect, whatever their underlying 
purpose may be. In this respect, the decisions on these clauses are precisely in line 
with the law relating to hire-purchase contracts. There also the underlying commercial 
purpose of the transaction is ignored, and effect is given to the legal form in which the 
transaction has been cast.
But there are limits to this general approach. In Re Bond Worth,138 sellers sold synthetic 
fibre to buyers who (as the sellers knew) bought it to spin into yarn together with other 
fibres, and make carpeting out of the resultant yarn. A retention of title clause provided 
that the sellers were to retain ‘equitable and beneficial ownership’ of the yarn, and in the 
proceeds of sale of goods made with the yarn. Slade J held that this was in substance 
an outright sale with a mortgage or charge back by the buyer.139 This ‘equitable and 
beneficial ownership’ was plainly not intended to be full ownership, but only a security 
right because the plain intention of the parties was that (a) the buyers could pay off the 
sellers at any time the balance of the price due, and thereupon the charge would come to 
an end, and (b) if the proceeds of resale exceeded the sums due to the sellers they would 
not have been entitled to the excess. As a result, the transaction was registrable under the 
Companies Act, and, in default of registration, it was void against the liquidator of the 
buyers.
There seem to be strong grounds for thinking that any reservation of title clause 
which gives rights over the proceeds of a sale or sales by the buyer must be vulnerable to 
134	 Directive 2011/7/EU, OJ 2011 L48/1.

139	 In reaching this conclusion, Slade J distinguished the Court of Appeal decision in Re Connolly Bros (No. 2) 
[1912] 2 Ch 25. That case, however, was followed by the House of Lords in Abbey National Building Society 
v Cann [1990] 1 All ER 1085, which overruled the competing line of authority including Church of England 
BS v Piskor [1954] 1 Ch 553. It has been argued that the effect of this is to overturn the ‘sale with a mortgage 
back or charge’ analysis – Hicks [1992] JBL 398; Gregory (1990) 106 LQR 550. On this argument, the buyer 
would merely acquire an equity of redemption, which would not be registrable under Companies Act 2006, 
s. 859A. However, as Hicks admits, the courts appear to have a policy of striking down clauses which claim 
rights to new products, or the proceeds of sale.

	
	 	
Real remedies	 415
this sort of reasoning.140 Almost always, it would seem, such a clause must carry the two 
implications (a) and (b) regarded as critical by Slade J.
So also in Clough Mill Ltd v Martin,141 there was a reservation of title clause which 
covered the yarn sold to the buyers, and also any goods into which the yarn was 
incorporated. When the buyers went into receivership, the receiver argued that the goods 
incorporating the yarn sold under the clause were subject to a charge which was void for 
non-registration under the Companies Act. The Court of Appeal upheld this argument. 
There was no reason, they held, why the property in these new goods should not be 
transferred to the sellers if their contract was intended to achieve this result, and the bare 
fact that the goods had not existed before did not by itself show that this was a transfer 
by way of charge. But the court went on to say that if these goods were seized and resold 
by the sellers under the clause it could not have been the intention of the parties that the 
sellers would be entitled to retain the whole proceeds of sale. Because these goods had 
never been the sellers’ property, and because there might even be additional plaintiffs 
to the goods under other reservation of title clauses, it must be assumed that the sellers 
could only keep the sums due to themselves under their own sales, and would have to 
refund any surplus to the buyers. This meant that the transfer of property in these goods 
to the sellers must have been intended to operate by way of charge, and not absolutely.
In practice, however, it might have been thought that it would almost always be the 
case that the parties intend any surplus from the resale of the seized goods over and 
above the price still due to the seller to belong to the buyer. But while the Court of Appeal 
in the Clough Mill case agreed that this was so with regard to the goods made out of or 
incorporating the goods sold, they insisted that it was not the case with regard to these 
goods themselves. They held that a seizure and resale of the actual goods sold might give 
the buyer the right to claim the surplus proceeds without this showing that the goods 
were charged. If the seizure and resale of the goods were made under the terms of the 
contract, it was suggested, the contract could still subsist, and so the resale would be 
subject to the buyer’s rights. However, as we saw earlier,142 this discussion was conducted 
without reference to s. 48 of the Act and the decision in R V Ward Ltd v Bignall.143 which 
appear to be inconsistent with this analysis. That section makes it clear that if the seller 
resells the goods, whether under the contract or not, the resale effects a rescission of 
the original contract. Hence – as decided in R V Ward Ltd v Bignall – the buyer cannot 
claim any surplus on the resale. The only way to avoid this conclusion appears to be to 
hold that s. 48 of the Act is in such cases excluded by a contrary intention, but the only 
ground for arguing that there is a contrary intention appears to be that the transaction is 
really not intended to be an outright sale but is intended to operate by way of mortgage 
or charge. Consequently, if the court in Clough Mill Ltd was correct in thinking that 
the buyer might under the contract in that case be entitled to reclaim the surplus on any 
resale of the goods by the seller, it would seem they must have been wrong to hold that 
the actual goods sold were not the subject of a charge.

	416	 The remedies of the seller
Many of these more recent decisions represent some move away from the ill-
considered Romalpa case, though Armour v Thyssen appears to reaffirm the central 
point of the Romalpa case on the effectiveness of a simple retention of title clause in 
relation to the goods supplied.144 To summarise: a reservation of title clause is effective so 
far as the original goods are concerned so long as they retain their identity and remain in 
the possession of the buyer. Moreover, attempts to extend the seller’s preferential rights 
(a) to other goods made with or incorporating the goods sold, or (b) to the proceeds 
of sale of the goods by the buyer, are at present highly vulnerable to attack in England 
as unregistered charges. But (on the present authorities) it appears to be possible to 
avoid the requirement of registration by a carefully worded clause which stresses that 
the ‘buyer’ is not really a buyer but a bailee, which insists that the bailee is only entitled 
to use the goods to manufacture other goods as a trustee, and on behalf of the seller, 
and which provides that the proceeds of sale of such goods (or the original goods) are 
to be held on trust in a separate bank account. Furthermore, it must be made clear that  
the intention of the parties is that the buyer is not to have any residuary right (in the 
nature of an equity of redemption) to the balance of the proceeds of sale after payment 
of the price of the goods (and other goods, supplied by the seller, if the clause so 
provides). So if the seller reclaims and resells the goods it must be made clear that there 
will be no liability to account to the buyer for any surplus over and above the price of 
the goods sold to the buyer under the contract. It is unlikely that many buyers would 
willingly agree to such a draconian clause if they fully understood its implications; and 
a clause drafted in this form must raise major doubts as to whether the parties seriously 
intend it to operate according to its terms, or whether it is in truth a complete sham.

Personal remedies
Action for the price
In addition to the real rights, the seller has, of course, his personal action upon the sale 
for breach of contract by the buyer. This action may take one of two forms. It may be 
an action for the price of the goods sold or it may be an action for damages for non-
acceptance. The distinction between an action for the price and an action for damages is 
of considerable importance. In purely monetary terms, there will usually be a substantial 
difference between the price of the goods and damages for non-acceptance. Moreover, 
if the property has passed to the buyer and the seller is entitled to sue for the price, 
he is under no obligation to mitigate his damage1 by attempting to resell the goods or 
otherwise.2 The goods now belong to the buyer and not the seller, and it is the buyer’s 
responsibility to take delivery of the goods or otherwise dispose of them.
The general rule laid down in s. 49(1) and s. 50(1) is that an action for damages is 
the appropriate remedy where the property has not passed and an action for the price 
is available when the property has passed. This simple principle is unfortunately 
complicated by the fact that the property in the goods may pass to the buyer before they 
have been delivered to and accepted by him. Section 49(1) says:
Where, under a contract of sale, the property in the goods has passed to the buyer, and the 
buyer wrongfully neglects or refuses to pay for the goods according to the terms of the contract, 
the seller may maintain an action against him for the price of the goods.
Section 50(1) says:
Where the buyer wrongfully neglects or refuses to accept and pay for the goods, the seller may 
maintain an action against him for damages for non-acceptance.
It is, of course, obvious that the property in the goods may have passed to the buyer, 
and he may have neglected or refused to accept and pay for them because, as we have 
seen, property in the goods often passes before delivery. In such an event, it seems to 
follow that the seller has the option of suing for the price under s. 49(1) or for damages 
under s. 50(1). In other words, the seller has:
1	 an action for the price where the property has passed and the buyer has accepted the 
goods;
	1	 As to the normal duty to mitigate, see below, p. 423.
	2	 In this sense an action for the price of goods in which property has passed is an illustration of the principle 
laid down by the HL in White & Carter (Councils) Ltd v McGregor [1962] AC 413, 1962 SC (HL) 1 – see per 
Lord Keith at pp. 437 and 19–20 respectively.

	418	 The remedies of the seller
2	 an action for damages where the property has not passed and the buyer refuses to 
accept the goods;
3	 an action for the price or for damages where the property has passed and the buyer 
refuses to accept the goods.
It is a pre-condition for the seller’s right to bring an action for the price under s. 49 
that property must have passed, but where the contract – particularly a contract where 
goods are delivery in instalments – includes a retention of title clause which has the effect 
that property cannot pass until full payment, the seller cannot rely on s. 49 to bring an 
action for the price as the conditions in that section are of a ‘mandatory’ character.3 The 
fact that the property has not passed, owing to some wrongful act of the defendant, 
does not enable the seller to claim the price, unless the buyer is estopped by his conduct 
from disputing the fact that the property has passed. So, for instance, if the buyer fails 
to name an effective ship in a sale f.o.b., the seller’s remedy is an action for damages, 
not for the price.4 And if the buyer in a c.i.f. contract refuses to take up the shipping 
documents when tendered, the seller’s remedy is once again an action for damages, not 
for the price.5
Price payable on a ‘day certain’
There is one exceptional case in which the seller may sue for the price although the 
property has not passed, for under s. 49(2):
Where, under a contract of sale, the price is payable on a day certain irrespective of delivery, 
and the buyer wrongfully neglects or refuses to pay such price, the seller may maintain an 
action for the price, although the property in the goods has not passed, and the goods have not 
been appropriated to the contract.
The important point to note about this subsection is that it concerns a case where the 
price is payable irrespective of delivery. If the price is due on some specified date after 
delivery, no great difficulty arises. Clearly, the seller can sue for the price as soon as the 
date arrives. But s. 49(2) also applies to cases where the price is due before delivery, and 
one can see why this is necessary. If the price is payable before delivery, and the buyer 
fails to pay, the seller cannot sue for damages for non-acceptance because the date for 
acceptance has not yet arrived. Indeed, the buyer may very well intend to accept the 
goods: but he has in the meantime defaulted in his obligation to pay. So the seller clearly 
needs to be able to sue for the price (or an instalment) due on some date before delivery.
The main difficulty in interpreting the subsection is the meaning of ‘a day certain’. 
Does it mean a named, fixed date, or is it possible to invoke the maxim certum est quod 
certum reddi potest, so that the section could be applied to a contract which contains 
machinery for ascertaining the date when the price is to be paid without actually fixing 
any date? In Workman Clark & Co Ltd v Lloyd Brazileno,6 it was held that the seller,

who was constructing a ship for the buyer, was entitled to sue for the instalments as they 
became due, although the date on which they became due was ascertained by reference 
to the stage which had been reached in the construction of the vessel. The Court of 
Appeal decided both that s. 49(2) applies to instalments payable on a day certain, and 
that these instalments were payable on a day certain.7 It does not follow that the price 
can be sued for whenever the date for payment can be ascertained because in many cases 
an action for damages would be the more appropriate remedy. But in this case, there 
would have been no ground for an action for damages and the seller would have been left 
without any remedy if he could not sue for the price.
But although a seller may need to be able to sue for the price before delivery if the 
contract provides for advance payment, this is liable to leave open one serious problem: 
what happens if the goods are never delivered at all? Of course, if this is due to breach 
by the seller, the buyer will have his own remedy. But suppose the goods are not delivered 
because the seller treats the non-payment as a sufficient repudiation to justify him 
in terminating the whole contract, either as a matter of common law or under some 
specific clause in the contract?
In Hyundai Heavy Industries Co Ltd v Papadopoulos,8 which was also a shipbuilding 
case in which the price was payable by instalments, it was held by the House of Lords 
that the buyer could be sued for an instalment which fell due on 15 July despite the fact 
that the seller exercised a contractual right of cancellation on 6 September, with the 
result that the buyer would have had9 to pay the instalment even though he would not 
have received the goods. This holding has somewhat alarming implications which do not 
appear to have been wholly thought through by the House of Lords; for it would seem 
to follow from the decision that even if the entire price had been payable in advance, the 
seller could have both exercised his right of cancellation, so sparing him the necessity of 
delivering the ship at all, and still have sued for the price. The House seems to have been 
led to its decision by its desire to stick to the newly established distinction between a 
rescission of a contract ab initio, and a mere termination as a result of breach.
This distinction, which originated with the House’s own decision in Johnson v 
Agnew,10 was a great simplification of the law, but the decision concerned land law, and 
the relationship of a right to specific performance and a claim for damages for breach 
of a contract to sell land. In transferring this decision to the law of sale of goods, the 
House seems to have overlooked the fact that there are special features to a contract 
of sale of goods, which mean (for instance) that even a termination of such a contract 
has retrospective effect in certain respects.11 They appear also to have overlooked the

	420	 The remedies of the seller
categorical pronouncement by Lord Wilberforce in Johnson v Agnew (with whom all the 
other Law Lords concurred) that:
If the vendor treats the purchaser as having repudiated the contract and accepts the repudiation, 
he cannot thereafter seek specific performance. This follows from the fact that, the purchaser 
having repudiated the contract, and his repudiation having been accepted, both parties are 
discharged from further performance.12
Equally, it would seem to follow that the vendor cannot both claim to recover the 
entire purchase price, and at the same time insist that the whole contract is terminated 
because of the purchaser’s breach. The problem is that the House seems to have been 
too formalistic in treating the various steps in a distinct chronological order in Hyundai: 
they seem to have thought that if the price (or instalment) is due before the contract 
is terminated, the obligation to pay the price or instalment cannot be affected by the 
subsequent termination of the contract. What this overlooks is the simple possibility 
that the duty to pay may be (and normally is) conditional on subsequent performance by 
the other party.13
There is little doubt that the Hyundai decision will return to haunt the courts because 
the potential injustice to which it may give rise is so gross, but for the present it is enough 
to note that the speeches in Hyundai contemplate that the decision may not apply to a 
pure contract of sale, as opposed to a contract for sale and manufacture. The reason 
for this distinction has been touched upon earlier: in a pure contract of sale, delivery 
of the goods is the whole consideration for the price, so it may well be inconsistent 
for the seller to claim the price and also the right to cancel or terminate. If the goods 
are never delivered in such a case there is a total failure of consideration, so the buyer 
cannot (it seems) be made to pay the price, or, if he has paid it, must be entitled to 
recover it.14 But where the contract involves manufacture as well as sale, the manufacture  
(and preliminary expenses of manufacture) may be part of the consideration, so the 
seller may not be acting inconsistently in first suing for instalments, and later cancelling 
the whole contract. Nevertheless, even this explanation is hardly satisfying given that 
it would extend to a situation in which substantially the entire price is payable in 
advance, and yet the seller may have incurred only minimal advance expenditure prior 
to cancellation.
Critique of present law
Obviously, an action for the price is more favourable to the seller than a mere action 
for damages for non-acceptance. But where the goods have not been delivered, the law 
may, in practice, place the seller in a somewhat difficult situation. He may choose to 
take his stand on the argument that the property has passed to the buyer, disclaim all 
responsibility for the goods and sue for the price. But if he takes this course he runs the 
risk that the court may eventually decide that property had not passed to the buyer and

Personal remedies	 421
that the seller’s only remedy is for damages for non-acceptance. If the court takes this 
view, it follows that the seller will have been responsible for mitigating the damage by, 
for example, attempting to resell the goods. His failure to do so may then reduce the 
damages to which he would have been entitled. On the other hand, if the seller attempts 
to mitigate the loss by reselling the goods, or part of them, or by dealing with them in 
some way, a court may treat this as evidence of an acceptance by the seller of repudiation 
of the contract by the buyer. The result of this will be that even if the property had 
originally passed to the buyer it will now revest in the seller and an action for the price 
will no longer lie. If, therefore, the seller’s efforts to resell the goods have failed, he will 
have made his own position worse by attempting to dispose of them.15 And if his efforts 
to resell succeed, he may make his position worse in another respect. For by reselling 
these goods he may have lost an alternative sale and (at least in the case of second-hand 
goods) this will not be a recoverable item of damages.16
These difficulties largely stem from the fact that the seller is entitled to sue for the 
price of the goods where the property has passed but the buyer has refused to take 
delivery. It is doubtful whether in modern times this is the most sensible approach to 
the issues which arise.17 The most important practical problem in this situation is this: 
whose responsibility is it to resell or otherwise dispose of the goods and to hold them 
pending resale? If this responsibility should be the buyer’s, then an action for the price is 
appropriate, but if it should rest on the seller, an action for damages for non-acceptance 
would be more appropriate. Which of the parties should bear this responsibility cannot, 
it is suggested, be answered simply by asking if the property has passed but should 
depend on a balance of convenience. For instance, if the seller is a dealer and the buyer 
is a private consumer (as has happened in several cases concerning the sale of motor 
vehicles) it seems more sensible that the seller should have the responsibility of reselling 
the goods, and should be confined to an action for damages. Conversely, there are 
situations – especially in export sales – where the responsibility for taking possession of 
the goods and trying to resell them should be on the buyer despite the fact that property 
has not passed. For instance, if the buyer refuses to accept shipping documents properly 
tendered in an f.o.b. or c.i.f. sale, it would be extremely inconvenient for the seller to 
make arrangements to land, store and dispose of the goods at the place of destination. 
In this case, it would seem more reasonable if the seller could sue for the price and leave 
the buyer with the responsibility of dealing with the goods. In practice, if the price 
is payable by a banker’s credit, the seller will probably be able to sue the bank if the 
documents are wrongly rejected, but there are some situations in which the seller should 
also have an action against the buyer for the price.
In this connection, it is interesting to note the provisions of Article 2-709 of the 
Uniform Commercial Code, which seem a considerable improvement on those of the 
Sale of Goods Act. Under Article 2-709(1), the seller can sue for the price if the buyer  
has accepted the goods, or if the goods have been identified to the contract and ‘the seller 
is unable after reasonable effort to resell them at a reasonable price, or the circumstances 
15	 See, e.g., R V Ward Ltd v Bignall [1967] 1 QB 534.
16	 See Lazenby Garages Ltd v Wright [1976] 1 WLR 459, below, p. 431.
17	 Compare Uniform Commercial Code Art. 2-709 (see below).

	422	 The remedies of the seller
reasonably indicate that such effort will be unavailing’. Thus, if the buyer refuses to take 
delivery of the goods, the seller is in the first instance obliged to try to resell the goods 
unless it is clear that this will be unavailing. The mere fact that property has passed, 
therefore, does not entitle the seller to sue for the price. Conversely, once the seller has 
made reasonable efforts to resell and these have proved unavailing he may sue for the 
price even though property has not passed. Moreover, once the seller is entitled to sue 
for the price under Article 2-709(1), Article 2-709(2) enables the seller to resell at any 
time prior to judgment if such resale becomes possible, without thereby forfeiting his 
right to sue for the price. He must, of course, give credit for the proceeds of the resale, 
but his claim will then be for the contract price less the resale price and does not become 
converted into an action for damages as it does under English law.
Claims for special damage
In addition to the seller’s right to sue for the price, or for damages for non-acceptance, 
he may also have the right to claim special damages under s. 54 and the right to claim 
for any loss occasioned by the buyer’s neglect to take delivery. In both cases, it seems 
immaterial whether or not the property has passed. A claim by a seller for special 
damages is likely to arise but rarely in practice,18 and the principles governing such a 
claim may be more suitably dealt with when we come to examine the remedies of the 
buyer. A word needs to be said, however, on the possibility of a claim for loss occasioned 
by the buyer’s failure to take delivery. Section 37 lays down:
(1)	 When the seller is ready and willing to deliver the goods, and requests the buyer to take 
delivery, and the buyer does not within a reasonable time after such request take delivery of 
the goods, he is liable to the seller for any loss occasioned by his neglect or refusal to take 
delivery, and also for a reasonable charge for the care and custody of the goods.
(2)	 Nothing in this section affects the rights of the seller when the neglect or refusal of the 
buyer to take delivery amounts to a repudiation of the contract.
Where, therefore, the property in the goods has passed to the buyer and he neglects to 
take delivery, the seller may either sue for damages or for the price and, in the latter case, 
he can add a claim under s. 37 for damages to cover the cost of care and custody, and any 
further loss he may have suffered; for example, if the goods have gone bad and tainted 
other goods not sold to the buyer. If he sues for damages only, his claim will cover these 
items as a matter of course.
Price payable in foreign currency
Where the price is due in a foreign currency, but the action is brought in England 
and Wales, judgment can now be given in the foreign currency itself.19 This is also the 
Scottish position.20 There is, therefore, no need to convert the amount due into sterling, 
unless and until it becomes necessary to seek leave to enforce the judgment, when the

conversion will be made at the rate of exchange prevailing at that date.21 It is not yet clear 
whether the buyer can take advantage of these new rules, and demand that judgment be 
given in a foreign currency where that currency has depreciated against sterling.
Action for damages22
We have already seen that the seller’s only remedy where the property has not passed 
is an action for damages for non-acceptance, and that such an action is an alternative 
remedy where the property has passed but the buyer neglects to take delivery. It now 
becomes necessary to examine the principles on which these damages are calculable, 
leaving aside for the moment the question of special damages.
It may be convenient, first of all, to recall the general principle of contract law that 
the innocent party is bound to take reasonable steps to mitigate the damage. This 
principle applies to contracts of sale of goods as it applies to other contracts, and it 
applies equally whether the innocent party is buyer or seller. There is no need in a book 
of this nature to examine this principle at length, but it is mentioned here because the 
idea behind it underlies many of the detailed rules relating to damages in the law of sale 
of goods.
Moreover, in practice, breach of contract usually leads to some attempt at 
negotiating a settlement or finding some alternative way of performing the contract. 
Thus, a seller who cannot supply the goods contracted for may offer alternatives, or 
may offer late delivery.23 A seller who has broken an agreement to supply on credit may 
offer instead to sell for cash.24 Generally speaking, at least in commercial contracts, 
reasonable offers of this kind should be accepted by the innocent party or he may be 
penalised in damages.
A second general principle of contract law is also worth noting at this point. 
In general, where a party has contracted for possible alternative performances, 
his liability is only to be assessed according to the least onerous or costly of those 
performances. For instance, in a contract for the sale of 5,000 tonnes, 5 per cent more 
or less at seller’s option, the seller can only be liable for failing to deliver 4,750 tonnes; 
conversely, if the buyer has the option of choosing whether to take a larger or smaller 
quantity, he can only be liable for failing to take the minimum which he is obliged to 
take.25 It has, however, been held that this principle only relates to the valuation of 
the defendant’s promise; when the question is, ‘What promises is he bound by?’, it 
may well be that some term can be implied that the promise should be performed in 
a reasonable, not a minimal, way. So in Paula Lee Ltd v Robert Zehil Ltd,26 where the 
buyer had agreed to buy at least 16,000 of the seller’s dresses, it was held that it was an 
21	 Miliangos v George Frank (Textiles) Ltd, above, n. 19. See Civil Procedure Rules Part 40, Practice Direction

	424	 The remedies of the seller
implied term that the buyer would take a reasonable selection of the dresses, and not 
16,000 of the identical cheapest dress.
The general rule for the assessment of damages for the buyer’s breach of contract is 
laid down by s. 50(2):
The measure of damages is the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting, in the ordinary 
course of events, from the buyer’s breach of contract.
And the general method of computing the loss directly and naturally arising from the 
buyer’s breach is laid down by s. 50(3):
Where there is an available market for the goods in question the measure of damages is prima 
facie to be ascertained by the difference between the contract price and the market or current 
price at the time or times when the goods ought to have been accepted or (if no time was fixed 
for acceptance) at the time of the refusal to accept.27
The High Court in Glencore v Cirrus28 recently explained that s. 50(3) is not concerned 
with a loss of profits which the seller might have anticipated, but rather for the loss of 
the bargain with the buyer. Glencore had agreed to sell 630,000 barrels of blended crude 
oil to Cirrus, which Cirrus intended to resell, but the sub-buyer did not want blended 
oil. Cirrus therefore refused to proceed with the sale. Glencore managed to terminate 
the supply contract with its supplier without any liability, but brought an action for 
damages under s. 50. Cirrus argued that there was no claim because s. 50 was essentially 
concerned with lost profits assuming that transactions had proceeded (there was a clause 
excluding liability for lost profits in the contract). This was rejected by Cooke J, who 
held that the purpose of s. 50 was to compensate the seller for the loss of his bargain 
with the buyer, which is done by working out how much worse off the seller would have 
been if, at the time of the breach, he sold the goods to a substitute buyer. Glencore’s 
claim for damages ($2.5 million) therefore succeeded.
Meaning of ‘available market’29
The first question to which this subsection gives rise is what is meant by ‘an available 
market’? It is surprising how scanty is the authority on this point. In Dunkirk Colliery Co 
Ltd v Lever,30 there is a dictum by James LJ which suggests that a market necessarily signifies 
some place where the goods can be sold. In Marshall v Nicoll,31 an appeal to the House of 
Lords from Scotland, it was held, in a somewhat confusing and inconclusive discussion, that 
there might be a market within the meaning of s. 51(3) – the corresponding section dealing 
with non-delivery – although the goods were being specially made to order and the market 
for such goods was extremely limited. Next, in W L Thompson Ltd v Robinson (Gunmakers) 
27	 This is not, as some suppose, a rule derived from the Hadley v Baxendale rule, the first limb of which 
appears in s. 50(2). It is an older rule – see Dunlop v Higgins (1848) 1 HLC 381, (1848) 6 Bell’s App 195. It 
is regrettable, for the reasons which appear below, that Judge Chalmers chose to codify this rather than the 
Hadley v Baxendale principle.

Ltd,32 the question was fully argued before Upjohn J who thought himself bound to follow 
the dictum of James LJ in Dunkirk Colliery Co Ltd v Lever,33 although that case was decided 
before the Sale of Goods Act, and although the dictum was manifestly obiter and was not 
expressly concurred in by the other members of the court.34 But the learned judge gave his 
own opinion on the matter:35
Had the matter been res integra I think that I should have found that an ‘available market’ 
merely means that the situation in the particular trade in the particular area was such that the 
particular goods could freely be sold, and that there was a demand sufficient to absorb readily 
all the goods that were thrust on it so that if a purchaser defaulted the goods in question could 
readily be disposed of.36
This opinion seems preferable to that of James LJ as becomes clear when the facts of W 
L Thompson Ltd v Robinson (Gunmakers) Ltd37 are examined. In this case, the buyer 
contracted to buy a car from the plaintiffs, but failed to take delivery when the car was 
available. The sellers returned the car to the makers and claimed from the buyer damages 
for their loss of profit on the sale. It was found as a fact that the supply of cars exceeded the 
demand in that area when the contract was made. At that time, resale price maintenance 
was still rigidly enforced in relation to cars and other consumer goods and, consequently, 
there was rarely any difference between the contract price and the market price in the sense 
of the fixed retail price.38 The buyer contended that there was a market and that there being 
no difference between the market price and the contract price, the sellers were only entitled 
to nominal damages. Had this contention succeeded, the plaintiffs would have been deprived 
of damages to which they were clearly entitled in the present state of the law.39 For even if the 
sellers had not returned the car to the makers, but resold it to another buyer, they would still 
have lost one sale. For, with an excess of supply over demand, the sellers would still have been 
able to supply the second buyer with a car even had there been no breach, and thereby earned 
profit on both sales.40 In the event, Upjohn J avoided this result by holding that, even if there 
were a market, yet s. 50(3) only laid down a prima facie rule and that this rule could not be 
applied in this particular case.
This conclusion received the approval of the Court of Appeal in Charter v Sullivan.41

‘Market means buyers and sellers’; and in Heskell v Continental Express Ltd [1950] 1 All ER 1033, 1050, 
Devlin J said: ‘A market for this purpose means more than a particular place. It means also a particular level 
of trade.’

expectations. For some doubts on this, see Atiyah, Introduction to the Law of Contract (6th edn, 2005,

that, on otherwise identical facts, the claimant was able to dispose of all the cars he 
could obtain, and he was accordingly held entitled only to nominal damages. The Court 
of Appeal agreed with Upjohn J that on such facts it was immaterial whether there was 
an available market or not, but Jenkins LJ disagreed (obiter) as to the meaning of the 
term ‘available market’. He did not, however, offer his own definition, but rested content 
with saying that a market presupposes that prices are fixed by reference to supply and 
demand, and the goods are not sold at a fixed retail price.
As resale price maintenance is no longer permitted in the UK/EU, this particular point 
has ceased to be of much importance. Both in retail and in commercial sales the ‘market 
price’ is now likely to be the average or mid-point of a number of different prices 
prevailing in the market in question.
It is clear that the onus is on the seller to prove that sales have been lost, and, as one 
commentator has noted, ‘under the economic law of diminishing returns or increasing 
marginal costs . . . as a seller’s volume increases, then a point will inevitably be reached 
where the cost of selling each additional item diminishes the incremental return to the 
seller and eventually makes it entirely unprofitable to conclude the next sale’.42
If the meaning of the term ‘available market’ remains without firm judicial definition, the 
question whether there is an available market in any particular case seems now to be treated 
by the courts as a question of fact and, in some cases, even as a question of degree. There 
may, for instance, be evidence that sales occasionally take place of the commodity in question, 
but only rarely, or in small quantities.43 Or there may be evidence that similar though not 
identical goods are readily available or disposable.44 Or again, there may be evidence that it is 
possible to buy or sell the goods at a different place or in smaller quantities. In all these cases, 
the courts take a fairly broad and common-sense view of the question. The question which 
is usually treated as decisive is whether or not it would be reasonable for the seller to dispose 
of the goods through such market as is in fact available. It has, in fact, been suggested that 
the market price rule is best seen as an illustration of the rule that the innocent party must 
mitigate his loss; accordingly, attempts to define ‘market’ in any narrow or technical sense are 
to be deplored. The important question is whether the seller can reasonably find a substitute 
purchaser, and not where or how this substitute sale is to be made.45
If something needs to be done to the goods to make them saleable on the market, and 
it would be uneconomic for the seller to carry out such work, it would appear that the 
contract/market measure would not be the appropriate measure.46
Effect of resale by seller on ‘available market’
The market price rule is, in principle, based on the loss which the claimant (seller) would 
have suffered if, on non-acceptance by the buyer, the claimant had sold the goods in the

market. It is thus concerned with a notional or hypothetical sale which might reasonably 
have been made by the seller. The rule then gives rise to problems where the seller actually 
has gone into the market and resold the goods. If this resale is actually at the market price 
there will, of course, be no difficulty, but if the resale is made at less than the market 
price, the seller may wish to claim as damages the difference between the original contract  
price and the resale price, rather than the market price. Equally, if the resale takes place at 
a price higher than the market price, the buyer may claim that the damages should only 
represent the difference between the contract and the resale price. The question then arises 
whether the actual resale price should be taken into account, or whether the damages must 
still be calculated by reference to the market price.
In attempting to answer these questions, it is necessary to distinguish between the 
case where the seller finds a substitute buyer immediately on non-acceptance by the 
buyer, and the case where the seller chooses to retain the goods for some period before 
reselling them.47 If he resells more or less forthwith on non-acceptance by the buyer at 
less than the market price, the seller will clearly have difficulty in claiming damages 
based on this resale price. For the obvious question will be why the seller should have 
resold at less than the market price. Prima facie, the requirement that he should mitigate 
his loss would have required him to sell at not less than the market price and, unless the 
seller can find some very convincing reason for what he has done, it is difficult to see 
why he should recover more than the difference between the contract and the market 
price. If, on the other hand, the seller succeeds in convincing the court that in the 
particular circumstances, it was reasonable of him (despite the mitigation principle) to 
resell at the price which he in fact obtained, it seems improbable that the court would 
find that the resale price actually was lower than the market price. Such findings would 
be contradictory, in the ordinary way, and a decision that the actual resale price was 
reasonable would normally connote a finding that there was no available market at 
which the seller could have disposed of the goods at a higher price.
If the seller resells promptly on breach by the buyer at more than the market price, it 
is not wholly clear whether the buyer can take advantage of this to reduce the damages 
he would otherwise have to pay. The seller will, of course, face the same evidentiary 
problem as in the converse situation discussed in the last paragraph. That is to say, the 
seller may have difficulty in convincing the court that there was an available market in 
which prices were lower than the price actually obtained, for this implies that the second 
buyer made a bad bargain. And although parties do, of course, make bad bargains from 
time to time, the situation envisaged here is one in which the seller has unexpectedly 
had the goods left on his hands by non-acceptance by the buyer and in which, therefore, 
one would have expected the seller to be in a poor bargaining situation. However, let it 
be assumed that the seller is able to establish that he has resold at more than the market 
price. As the seller cannot claim for the loss if he sells below the market price, it may 
seem only fair that he should be able to retain any profit he makes by selling at above 
the market price.48 But there does seem to be a modern trend to deny recovery for a ‘loss’ 
47	 A third possibility is that the seller delays in reselling in the market because he is still trying to persuade the 
buyer to take the goods.
48	 Under the Uniform Commercial Code §2-706(1) (damages on resale) and §2-708(1) (damages for non-
acceptance) are completely alternative remedies, and it appears that the seller can opt for the higher measure.

	428	 The remedies of the seller
which is in fact counterbalanced by a profit, and it seems probable that a court would 
today hold that the seller is only entitled to the difference between contract and resale 
price, as this is the true measure of his loss. There seems no clear authority on this point, 
but the present submission appears to be the correct inference from the decision of the 
Court of Appeal in Campbell Mostyn (Provisions) Ltd v Barnett Trading Co49 where 
the seller retained the goods after the breach and subsequently resold them for more 
than the market price prevailing at the date of breach. It was held in these circumstances 
that the seller was entitled to recover the difference between contract and market price 
and did not have to account for the greater price at which he had in fact sold the goods. 
Somervell LJ quoted with approval the following passage from Lord Wrenbury’s speech 
in AKAS Jamal v Moolla Dawood,50 a Privy Council case dealing with shares:
If the seller retains the shares after the breach the speculation as to the way the market will 
subsequently go is the speculation of the seller, not of the buyer; the seller cannot recover from 
the buyer the loss below the market price at the date of the breach if the market falls, nor is he 
liable to the purchaser for the profit if the market rises.
It seems a reasonable inference that the position is different where the seller resells 
immediately upon breach. This conclusion may also be supported by the decision of the 
Court of Appeal in R Pagnan & Fratelli v Corbisa Industrial Agropacuaria Limitada,51 
although here the circumstances were rather unusual. This case concerned a breach 
of contract by the seller rather than the buyer, but in general the same principles are 
applicable. In this case, the buyers rightly rejected the goods delivered but then, as part 
of a settlement of the dispute, agreed to buy the same goods at a substantially lower 
price. This price was lower even than the market price and the buyers consequently 
made a handsome overall profit which exceeded their loss on the original sale. It was 
held that the second contract was part of a continuous course of dealing between the 
parties and not a wholly new and independent event. Consequently, the profit made 
by the buyers on the second sale had to be set off against their loss on the first, and 
they were only entitled to nominal damages. While it is not wholly clear whether the 
result would have been the same if the second purchase had not been from the sellers, 
the case does illustrate a modern reluctance to award damages for a ‘loss’ which in one 
sense is purely notional.
In some cases, the court will lack evidence that the market price on the date when the 
goods should have been accepted was other than the price at which the seller eventually 
sold. In such a case, it will necessarily have to be assumed that the relevant price for the 
purposes of s. 50(3) is the price at which the seller sold the goods.
Which market?
Where there is an available market in more than one place, the relevant place is prima facie 
the place at which the goods were to be delivered under the contract. So in Hasell v Bagot,

Shakes & Lewis Ltd,52 where Japanese superphosphate was sold for delivery at Adelaide, it 
was held by the Australian High Court that the question was whether there was a market 
at Adelaide and not in Japan. Had there been a market in both places, the market price at 
Adelaide would have been the relevant price. However, where goods are sold f.o.b. or c.i.f. for 
shipment to a particular market, then the relevant market would prima facie be that at the 
place of destination.53 The point to remember in all cases is that if the buyer refuses to accept 
the goods the seller will ordinarily have to find a substitute purchaser, and the question is 
where should the seller reasonably be expected to look for such a purchaser? Where the 
seller’s business is limited to a particular local area, the availability of a market in that area 
and the market price in that area are the only relevant considerations.54 In other cases, the 
seller may reasonably be expected to look far afield for a substitute purchaser, where the 
seller is engaged in international trade, for example.
Market price at what date?
The provisions of the Act dealing with the date at which the damages should be assessed 
by reference to the market price have given rise to a good deal of trouble, largely because 
the modern rules as to repudiation and mitigation were not settled when the 1893 Act was 
drafted. Some points are clear enough. Where the buyer’s refusal to take the goods occurs at 
the time when they should have been accepted, the provisions of s. 50(3) are exactly in point, 
and the seller recovers the difference between the contract price and the market price at that 
time. This rule, however, should not be too rigidly applied. It often happens that a breach 
by the buyer is not followed by the immediate resale of the goods in the market. Indeed, in 
practice the seller is much more likely to try to negotiate some alternative arrangement with 
the buyer, or to try to persuade him to take the goods after all. This is reasonable commercial 
behaviour which ought to be encouraged by the courts, and, if as a result the goods are only 
resold after some delay, it now seems clear that the seller may be entitled to obtain damages 
based on the market price at this later date.55 However, it has been recently stressed (in a 
case dealing with the sale of land) that the general rule remains that the damages ought to 
be assessed as at the date of breach, and that a seller cannot as a matter of course obtain 
damages based on the market price at the date when the contract is finally abandoned.56
Where no time for the delivery of the goods has been fixed by the contract, the tendency 
is for the courts to look to the market price at the time when the goods should have been 
accepted, and to ignore the last words of the section which state that the relevant time is the 
time when the buyer refuses to accept the goods.57 In Millett v Van Heeck,58 the Court of 
Appeal decided that the market price at the date at which the buyer refuses to take delivery is 
quite irrelevant where his refusal takes the form of an anticipatory breach. In such a case, the

	430	 The remedies of the seller
seller has the choice of accepting the repudiation,59 or of continuing to treat the contract as 
binding, but in either event the damages are prima facie assessable by reference to the market 
price at the date when delivery ought to have been accepted. So, for example, where the 
buyers failed to give 15 days’ notice of readiness to load a vessel as required by the contract, 
the sellers were entitled to leave the contract open until the last date of the shipment period, 
and claim damages based on the market price as at that date.60
If the action comes on for trial before the date when the buyer was bound to accept the 
goods, the court must make the best estimate it can of the probable market price at this date. 
In either event, if the market rises between the date of repudiation and the date when delivery 
should have been accepted, the relevant market price appears to be that prevailing at the 
latter date. In other words, the seller is not entitled to receive a higher measure of damages 
merely because the buyer repudiates the contract at a time when the market is lower than 
it is on the delivery date.61 Otherwise, he would receive more as a result of the breach than 
he would have received if the contract had been performed. This result can be justified by 
suggesting that where the buyer repudiates before the date for delivery, it must be presumed 
that the seller will not be able to resell in the market before that date. Even if he accepts the 
repudiation he is entitled to wait until the contractual delivery date.
On the other hand, where the market falls between the date of repudiation and the 
date when the goods ought to have been accepted, the result may be different. Here, 
it has been held that if the seller does accept the repudiation, his duty to mitigate the 
damage means that he should resell at once in a falling market, and that if he fails to 
do this he cannot hold the buyer liable for a greater amount than the difference between 
the contract price and the market price at the date of the repudiation.62 However, some 
justifiable scepticism has been expressed as to the idea that the innocent seller should 
be able to identify a ‘falling market’ before it has fallen,63 and it must be said that it is 
difficult to justify an assessment of damages at the date of termination on this ground. 
Of course, it could be argued that once the seller accepts the buyer’s repudiation, the 
contract is at an end, and the damages should be assessed as at the date when the seller 
should reasonably have resold the goods in the market. But that argument is equally 
applicable whether the market rises or falls after the termination of the contract, yet, as 
we have seen, where the market rises it is established that the damages must be assessed 
as at the contract delivery date and not when the contract is terminated.
Should the seller decline to accept the repudiation, however, as he is perfectly entitled 
to do,64 he is under no obligation to mitigate his damage by reselling at once. He can 
stand by the contract and wait until the delivery date before reselling and, in this case, he

is entitled to receive damages assessed in the normal way by reference to the market price 
at the date when the goods ought to have been accepted.65
The Court of Appeal’s decision in Millett v Van Heeck was approved by the Privy Council 
in a case dealing with s. 51(3), the corresponding subsection concerning non-delivery.66 In 
this case, the Privy Council accepted that the second limb of the subsection (that damages 
are to be assessed at the time of refusal to accept where no time is fixed for acceptance) may 
in fact have no application at all. First, they accepted the decision in Millett v Van Heeck 
that the subsection has no application to anticipatory breach, it being the clear assumption 
of the subsection that the breach has occurred after the date for delivery has passed. But it 
is also difficult to see how the subsection can apply even if the breach is not anticipatory. If 
no time for acceptance is fixed by the contract, it must nevertheless be the case that delivery 
must be made either in a reasonable time or on demand. But if delivery is to be made in a 
reasonable time, and at the expiry of such a period the buyer refuses to accept the goods, 
then the first limb of s. 50(3) would apply anyhow. In other words, in this situation, both 
limbs of the subsection give the same result. The relevant date for assessing the damages is 
the date when the goods ought to have been accepted, which in this case is also the date when 
the buyer has refused to accept them. If, on the other hand, the contract provides for delivery 
on demand, then, as soon as demand is made, a time for the delivery of the goods has been 
fixed, so once again the subsection would seem to point to the date when the goods should 
have been accepted as the relevant date, and once again the date of refusal to accept would 
be irrelevant.
Cases where market price rule inapplicable
The rule laid down by s. 50(3) is only a prima facie method of calculating the damages, 
and if it would lead to an obviously incorrect assessment of the loss directly and 
naturally resulting from the breach, it must be discarded and some other method of 
assessment, based, for example, on the profit lost or expenses incurred (such as sums 
paid on the cancellation of a charterparty),67 must be used. We have already seen that 
problems sometimes arise where specific goods are resold after the buyer has refused to 
accept them, and the question has arisen whether the seller has, in the result, suffered 
any loss at all.68 In the case of new manufactured goods, the answer depends on whether 
the market situation is such that the seller has lost a sale. But this is not the rule with 
respect to unique goods. If the buyer refuses to accept goods in this category and the 
seller resells at (or at more than) the first contract price, he suffers no loss at all, for he 
could not have made more than one profit from a unique chattel. It has been held by the 
Court of Appeal that a second-hand car is a unique chattel for this purpose.69
Naturally, if there is no market at all the subsection is of no assistance. In these cases, 
the amount recoverable must depend upon whether the seller has already procured or

	432	 The remedies of the seller
manufactured the goods for delivery or not. If he has done so, the prima facie measure of 
damages is the difference between the contract price and the value of the goods at the date of 
breach.70 Since there is, on this supposition, no market, there will often be practical problems 
in assessing the value of the goods at the time of breach, but the court must do the best it 
can on the material available to it, for example, the fact that the seller has managed to re-sell 
the goods.71 Where the goods have been manufactured to some special order, it may even be 
that they have no value at all and the seller will then be able to sue for the full price. But his 
right to the whole of these damages will, of course, depend upon proof that the goods are 
useless and unsaleable, not only in their existing form, but even after reasonable alterations. 
For the seller must always mitigate his damage and, if he can make the goods saleable by 
small alterations, he should do so.72 If, on the other hand, the seller has not yet procured or 
manufactured the goods, he will prima facie be entitled to recover the difference between the 
contract price and the cost to himself of so procuring or manufacturing the goods, that is to 
say, his profit.
The mere fact that the non-performance of the contract which has been broken has 
enabled the seller to make profits on other contracts does not of itself entitle the defaulting 
buyer to claim that the profits so made should be set off against those which have been lost 
as a result of his breach, as the seller might have been able to earn both lots of profit.73 But 
in Hill & Sons v Edwin Showell & Sons,74 the House of Lords held that a buyer is entitled 
to give evidence to show that in fact the seller would not have been able to earn both lots of 
profit; for example, if his factory has been working to capacity the whole time. Although the 
burden of proof on the buyer in this respect is a heavy one, if he can succeed in establishing 
the point the seller will only be entitled to recover the difference between the profit he should 
have made and the profit he actually made.
Damages for non-acceptance can now be awarded in a foreign currency where 
appropriate.75 For example, where overseas sellers sell goods to English buyers and the buyers 
wrongfully refuse to accept the goods, it will often be appropriate to award damages in the 
currency of the seller’s business. The appropriate currency may be expressly or impliedly 
fixed by the contract (e.g. it will often be the currency of the contract itself) or it may be fixed 
by the court as the currency which best expresses the loss. The rule, it has been said, must be 
sensibly and flexibly applied so as to produce a just and appropriate result. In some cases, the 
immediate loss will indicate the appropriate currency; in others, there may be further factors 
indicating a different currency.

Part VII
The remedies of the buyer

Rejection of the goods, rescission 
and specific performance
Buyer’s right to reject the goods
The buyer’s first and primary remedy for a breach of contract by the seller is to reject 
the goods, and, if appropriate, to repudiate the contract. As we have seen, the remedy 
of repudiation is available to the buyer only when the seller’s breach of contract goes 
to the root of the agreement, either because it is a breach of condition or because of 
the nature and consequences of a breach of an innominate term.1 The right to reject is 
separate from the right to repudiate the contract, and circumstances giving rise to a right 
of rejection do not, even if the right is exercised, necessarily put an end to the contract.2 
The seller can usually, until the time of performance has expired, therefore, tender a 
conforming delivery.3
The Sale and Supply of Goods Act 1994 made significant changes to this area.4 The 
former provisions apply to contracts made before the commencement date of that Act.5
As a result, in non-consumer sales, the buyer no longer has the right to reject for 
breach of the statutory requirements as to quality and quantity where the breach is so 
slight that it would be unreasonable to reject the goods. This change is implemented by 
s. 15A to the Act limiting the right to reject for a breach of ss. 13 to 15, and s. 30(2A)–
(2E)(ss. 30(2A) and (2B) do not apply to Scotland, and s. 30(2D) applies to Scotland 
only), and where ‘the breach is so slight that it would be unreasonable for [the buyer] to 
reject [the goods]’. In the case of a breach of s. 30, s. 30(2A) likewise limits the buyer’s 
right to reject for a shortfall, or his right to reject all the goods for an excess, if the 
shortfall or the excess ‘is so slight that it would be unreasonable for him to do so’. 
The right to reject an excess itself is unaffected by these proposals, and remains an

[1966] CLJ 192, 194 Lord Devlin pointed out that what creates the breach is failure to tender conforming 
goods within the contract time – see below, n. 33. Furthermore, where rejection of the goods for breach of 
condition is a termination of the contract, it is not a rescission ab initio. Hence there is no inconsistency in 
rejecting some of the goods while keeping the rest – see p. 520 below.

of goods.6
The Scottish approach is similar, but easier to state. The buyer may reject only if the 
breach, whether of an express or an implied term of the contract, is material. If the contract 
of sale is a consumer contract, breach by the seller of any term (express or implied) as to 
the quality or fitness for purpose of the goods, or correspondence with description, or with 
sample in quality, is deemed to be material, meaning that the consumer buyer is always 
entitled to reject for breach.7 The right to reject for excess or shortfall of supply is likewise 
dependent upon the materiality of the excess or shortfall, as the case may be.8 Again, there 
are equivalent provisions for other contracts relating to the supply of goods.9
As we have previously noted, a regrettable feature of the English provisions is that 
they only apply to breaches of the seller’s statutory duties.10 They therefore have no 
application to a breach of a stipulation as to time, or any other express term of the 
contract which is classifiable as a condition. Presentation of shipping documents one 
day too late, failure by the buyer to open a letter of credit by the stipulated date and 
similar breaches of contract will, therefore, continue to be governed by the existing law 
which permits rejection by the buyer (or repudiation by the seller) however reasonable 
or unreasonable it may be. Still less, of course, will these proposals have any effect on 
the general law of contract, as opposed to the law of sale of goods. It could well be 
desirable for the Law Commission to consider enlarging these recommendations to the 
general law of contract in England, as the unqualified right of repudiation which the 
law presently confers for a breach of condition is just as obnoxious in other kinds of 
contracts as it is in the law of sale.
Sections 13–15, including the added provisions, being subject to s. 55(1) of the 1979 
Act,11 are excludable by a contrary intention. It might be argued, however, that any 
contract term purporting to exclude the restrictions on the buyer’s right to reject the 
goods would be subject to a test of reasonableness by virtue of the Unfair Contract 
Terms Act 1977. However, the application of ss. 3 and 17 is problematic, and the 
argument could only apply where the contract is made on the buyer’s written standard 
terms, when it would have to be argued under s. 3(2)(b) or s. 17(1)(b) that the effect of 
the term is to allow the buyer to render a contractual performance substantially different 
from that which was expected of him, or no performance at all. Where the buyer deals as 
a consumer the restrictions on the right of rejection do not, of course, apply. Moreover, 
s. 6 of the Act, as we have seen, prevents the exclusion of ss. 13–15 and any attempt by 
the seller to exclude the buyer’s right of rejection would be ineffective by virtue of s. 6 
read together with s. 13 or by s. 20 read together with s. 25(3).

Rejection of the goods, rescission and specific performance	 437
These changes are generally to be welcomed because there is no doubt that the former 
law permitted rejection on capricious and technical grounds. In particular, rejection was 
often justified on the ground of a technical breach of the statutory implied terms, even 
though the buyer’s real motive in rejecting the goods was that market prices had fallen 
since the contract was made. Of course, as the Law Commissions recognised, these 
changes in the law would introduce some element of uncertainty where previously the 
right of rejection was unqualified, but this may well be an acceptable price to pay for 
penalising totally unreasonable commercial behaviour.
It is perhaps not entirely clear how far the personal position of the buyer will be 
relevant in examining the question of reasonableness in this context. Presumably, if 
the buyer has his own good reasons for needing goods which are in precise conformity 
with the contract (even if this was not known to the seller) it will not be unreasonable 
of him to reject them for any slight nonconformity. On the other hand, whether or 
not the right of rejection arises at all will depend upon there being found a breach 
of one of the quality warranties,12 and in order to sue for breach of the fitness for 
purpose warranty the Act requires the buyer to have made known to the seller the 
particular purpose for which the goods are required. In consequence, whether or not 
this situation arises will almost certainly depend upon whether there is found to be a 
breach of the other quality warranties, and in particular the warranty that the goods 
are of satisfactory quality. It is also unclear whether other personal circumstances 
of the buyer (his market position, for instance) will be relevant in deciding whether 
rejection is reasonable.
Two further questions relating to the buyer’s right of rejection remain to be discussed 
here.
Instalment sales
It is first necessary to consider the position which arises in a contract for the sale of 
goods by instalments, where the seller is guilty of a breach as to one or more instalments. 
Is the buyer entitled in such circumstances to reject the whole of the contract goods or 
is he entitled only to reject that part in respect of which there is a breach of contract, or 
again is he relegated to a claim for damages? The question is posed rather than answered 
by s. 31(2) as follows:
Where there is a contract for the sale of goods to be delivered by stated instalments, which 
are to be separately paid for, and the seller makes defective deliveries in respect of one or 
more instalments, or the buyer neglects or refuses to take delivery of or pay for one or more 
instalments, it is a question in each case depending on the terms of the contract and the 
circumstances of the case, whether the breach of contract is a repudiation of the whole contract 
or whether it is a sever-able breach giving rise to a claim for compensation but not to a right to 
treat the whole contract as repudiated.
12	 See, e.g., Harbo Farm Sales Ltd v Elliot 2008 GWD 19-327 (Sheriff D. J. Cusine).

	438	 The remedies of the buyer
Non-severable contracts
Section 31(2), by its express terms, only applies where the goods are to be delivered by 
instalments and the instalments are to be separately paid for. But this is not an exhaustive 
statement of the circumstances in which a contract may be severable.13 As will be seen 
later,14 there are cases in which a contract is severable in law even though the goods are 
not to be delivered by separate instalments or the instalments are not to be separately 
paid for. But if the contract is not severable, then it is to be treated as an entire contract. 
Hence, in these cases a partial breach is to be treated in the same way as a total breach 
and the buyer is prima facie entitled to reject all the goods. In this situation, the fact that 
the goods are delivered in instalments is immaterial once it is found that this does not 
make the contract severable.15 The position under the former law was exactly the same 
as if the whole consignment were delivered at once and part of the goods were defective. 
In such a case, it was well established that the buyer could reject the whole.16 In the case 
of contracts made after 2 January 1995, the provisions set out above will apply in such a 
situation.
Severable contracts
Where the contract is severable because the goods are to be delivered in instalments and 
are to be separately paid for, the right of the buyer to reject the whole contract quantity 
depends, as stated by s. 31(2), on the terms of the contract and the circumstances of the 
case. If the contract is severable although the goods are not to be delivered in instalments 
or the instalments are not to be separately paid for, the same rules probably apply as a 
matter of common law. If the contract is silent as to the events which have occurred:
The main tests to be considered in applying the sub-section … are, first, the ratio quantitatively 
which the breach bears to the contract as a whole and secondly, the degree of probability or 
improbability that such a breach will be repeated.17
Two cases may be contrasted. In Maple Flock Co Ltd v Universal Furniture Products 
(Wembley) Ltd,18 the plaintiffs contracted to sell 100 tons of rag flock to the defendants, 
delivery to be at the rate of three weekly instalments of one and a half tons each, as 
required, and the flock to conform to government standards. The first 15 loads were 
satisfactory, but a sample from the sixteenth load showed that it did not conform to 
government standards. In the meantime, the defendants had taken delivery of four 
more loads, all of which were satisfactory. Applying the above test, the Court of Appeal 
13	 This is expressly stated by Atkin LJ in Longbottom & Co Ltd v Bass Walker & Co Ltd [1922] WN 245, but 
it is also implicit in many other cases.

Rejection of the goods, rescission and specific performance	 439
held that the defendants were not entitled to repudiate the contract, as the breach only 
affected one and a half tons out of the flock already delivered and it was most improbable 
that it would recur. On the other hand, in R A Munro & Co Ltd v Meyer,19 A agreed to 
buy 1,500 tons of meat and bone meal, delivery at the rate of 125 tons a month, from 
B. After more than half of the total quantity had been delivered and discovered to be 
seriously defective, the buyer claimed to repudiate the contract. Wright J held that he 
was entitled to do so. ‘Where the breach is substantial and so serious as the breach in this 
case and has continued so persistently, the buyer is entitled to say that he has the right to 
treat the whole contract as repudiated.’20
Another example which concerned an alleged repudiation by the buyers rather than 
sellers illustrates the delicate position in which commercial parties may find themselves 
when they claim that a breach in respect of one instalment amounts to a repudiation of 
the whole contract. In Warinco A G v Samor SPA,21 the contract was for the sale of crude 
rape seed oil in several instalments. The buyers rejected the first instalment, claiming 
that it was not of the colour required by the contract. The sellers disputed this and, in 
subsequent proceedings, they were held to be in the right on this point. But the sellers 
also told the buyers that the next instalment would be identical with the one which the 
buyers had rejected. The buyers replied, insisting that the instalment must conform 
to the contract, and the sellers eventually declined to deliver any further instalments, 
arguing that the buyer’s action amounted to a repudiation. Evidently, the sellers feared 
that, as the second instalment was going to be identical with the first and as the buyers 
had rejected that one, they would reject the second one as well. Donaldson J held that 
the sellers had acted wrongly in refusing to tender the second instalment but his decision 
was reversed on appeal. However, the disagreement related only to the application of 
the law, and no doubt was cast on Donaldson J’s statement of the relevant principles as 
follows:22
If a buyer under a contract calling for delivery by instalments commits a breach of that contract 
before all the deliveries have been made and that breach is so serious as to go to the root of the 
contract – in other words, to destroy the basis of the contract – common sense suggests that the 
seller should not be expected to go to the trouble and expense of tendering later instalments if 
he does not want to. The law so provides.
Again, if it becomes clear that the buyer will be unable to accept or to pay for later instal-
ments, common sense suggests that the seller should, if he wishes, be discharged from any 
obligation further to perform his part of the contract. The law so provides.
Finally, if a buyer acts or speaks in a manner which declares in clear terms that he will not 
perform his part of the contract, the seller should, in common sense and fairness, have the 
option of being discharged from further obligation under the contract. And the law so pro-
vides. But common sense also suggests that there can be borderline cases in which it is not 
quite so clear what should happen. The law is at a disadvantage here in that it must draw a 
line. The line which it draws is indicated by the question: “Has the buyer evinced an intention 
to abandon or refuse to perform the contract?” In answering this question, the law has regard 
to such factors as the degree to which the delivery of one instalment is linked with another, the

	440	 The remedies of the buyer
proportion of the contract which has been affected by the allegedly repudiatory breach and the 
probability that the breach will be repeated. However, these are merely part of the raw material 
for answering the question. They cannot be conclusive in themselves.
A single contract, though severable, is not the same thing as a number of distinct 
and separate contracts. If parties enter into distinct contracts, breach of one would very 
rarely justify repudiation of the others. But a provision in a contract that each instalment 
or each delivery is to be treated as a separate contract does not mean that there are 
distinct contracts; it merely indicates that the contract is severable. Hence, such a clause 
does not deprive a buyer of a right to throw up the whole contract if he would otherwise 
have such a right.23
It will be noticed that s. 31(2) appears to assume that the buyer has one of two 
possible remedies: repudiation of the whole contract or merely a claim for damages. 
The subsection does not appear to contemplate the third possibility of allowing the 
buyer to reject the defective instalments while retaining the rest of the goods. But there 
is no reason to suppose that the buyer cannot do this, subject to the somewhat complex 
rules governing the question of partial acceptance.24 However, this possibility seems to 
have been overlooked in Regent OHG Aisenstadt v Francesco of Jermyn Street,25 a case 
which nicely illustrates the importance of the distinction between a severable and a non-
severable contract. In this case, the contract was for the sale of 62 high-quality men’s 
suits, to be delivered in instalments. The sellers delivered the suits in five instalments, the 
fourth of which was one suit short. If this had been a non-severable contract, under the 
law then applicable, the buyer would have been entitled to reject the whole lot because 
a shortage of one suit was conceded not to be de minimis (it exceeded a one per cent 
shortage). But Mustill J held that the contract was severable and, applying s. 31(2), held 
that the breach, being unlikely to be repeated and affecting only one instalment, did not 
give the buyer the right to repudiate the whole contract. He did not, however, consider 
whether the buyer had the right to reject the whole of the fourth instalment, which it 
would seem he ought to have had. If the goods had been defective in quality (rather than 
one suit short), it would seem clear that the buyer would have been able to reject the 
whole of that instalment. The question would then have arisen whether, in applying s. 
31(2), the short delivery ought to have been regarded as a shortage of one suit only or of 
the whole of the fourth instalment. If the latter had been the correct approach, the result 
of the case would have been different.
There was one further puzzle about the right of rejection in instalment contracts which 
affected both severable and non-severable contracts, and which did not seem to have 
been expressly solved by the courts. The problem was this: if instalments were delivered 
and accepted – or anyhow not rejected – and a subsequent instalment was then delivered 
which was defective so that the buyer became entitled to repudiate the whole contract 
(either because it was non-severable, or because the breach was so serious that s. 31(2) 
justified the buyer in taking this step), what was to happen to the instalments already 
delivered and accepted, or not rejected? If the contract was genuinely non-severable, it

Rejection of the goods, rescission and specific performance	 441
was clear that the buyer could not accept part and reject part of the goods (see s. 11(4))26 
so his rejection of later instalments must have carried with it the right (and indeed the 
obligation) to reject the prior instalments as well; and this was presumably still the case 
even though he might already have accepted the prior instalments. His acceptance would 
have to be treated as conditional on the later instalments being satisfactory. Section 35A, 
inserted by the 1994 Act, confers a right of partial rejection, and s. 11(4) is expressly 
made subject to the new provision, so that problem should no longer arise. This 
provision is discussed below.27
If, on the other hand, the contract is severable, but the defective instalment is 
sufficiently bad to justify the buyer in throwing up the whole contract under s. 31(2), the 
buyer does not have to reject the prior instalments, but is he entitled to do so? Section 
31(2) does not necessarily exclude the possibility that the buyer may have this right, but, 
by its terms, it deals with the future, so that the buyer can refuse to perform outstanding 
obligations, but usually his (severable) obligations to accept previous conforming 
instalments have already been fulfilled and cannot be undone.
It is somewhat surprising that these problems seem never to have been discussed in 
the cases,28 though there is a hint of them in Gill & Duffus SA v Berger & Co Inc.29 
It seems to have been assumed by the Court of Appeal here that rejection of a second 
instalment retrospectively validated a wrongful original rejection of a prior instalment; 
the authority of this case is weakened by the fact that the House of Lords held that the 
second rejection was wrongful, so that the point did not arise.
Consequences of rejection
Where the buyer repudiates the contract, having the right to do so, he can of course 
decline to pay the price or, if he has paid it, he can recover it. In addition, he may 
maintain an action for damages, for if the buyer acts within his rights in rejecting the 
goods tendered, he can normally hold the seller liable for non-delivery.30 There may be 
some circumstances in which, after rejection by the buyer, the seller can tender delivery 
of a new lot of goods if he still has time to do this within the period allowed by the 
contract,31 but in general it seems that the buyer is entitled to treat a wrongful delivery as 
itself a breach of contract which justifies repudiation by him.32
The assumption of the present law is that the right of rejection must be exercised in 
a fairly short period, so that, in practice, no question arises as to any use that the buyer

32	 Although on one reading, s. 11(3) and (4) may be taken to lay down that rejection of the goods involves 
repudiation of the contract (or, more accurately, an acceptance of the seller’s repudiation), the point made 
at the outset, that rejection and repudiation are separable, must be borne in mind – see above.

	442	 The remedies of the buyer
may have had from the goods.33 The buyer’s right to recover the full price after rejecting 
the goods is based on the supposition that he has received no consideration at all when 
he rejects; in one sense this may not be completely accurate where the buyer may have 
used the goods before rejecting them. But as a matter of law, it is probably generally 
correct to treat the rejection as demonstrating a total failure of consideration so that 
the seller is not entitled to any credit for any use that the buyer may have had from the 
goods.34 However, the case may be different if the buyer claims damages in addition to 
seeking the recovery of his price. It would seem remarkable if the buyer did not have 
to set off the value of any use he may have had from the goods against a claim for 
damages.
Where the goods are so rejected, it is not the responsibility of the buyer to return the 
goods to the seller, for s. 36 states:
Unless otherwise agreed, where goods are delivered to the buyer, and he refuses to accept them 
having the right to do so, he is not bound to return them to the seller, but it is sufficient if he 
intimates to the seller that he refuses to accept them.35
As will be seen below,36 this rule presents some problems where the buyer has redelivered 
the goods to a sub-buyer before they are discovered to be defective. In this situation, the 
normal solution is simply to deny the buyer’s right to reject altogether.
The acceptance by the seller of the buyer’s rejection revests the property in the former 
if it has passed to the buyer, and also restores to him the immediate right to possession. 
Consequently, as we have seen, the buyer has no lien on the goods for the repayment of 
the purchase price.37 The seller, upon receipt of notice of rejection, is entitled to have the 
goods placed at his disposal so as to allow of his resuming possession forthwith.38
As we have already seen, it is not wholly clear whether the risk is to be treated as 
revesting in the seller on rejection, but the practical position seems to be that the risk 
does not pass at all where defective goods are delivered and then rejected by the buyer,39 
or even where a short quantity is delivered and the goods are rejected.40
33	 Note, however, the Scottish case of Lamarra v Capital Bank plc 2007 SC 95, where the purchaser’s rejection 
of a car in March 2001 was upheld, although he continued to use the vehicle until the following June; and 
the sheriff court case of Fiat Auto Financial Services v Connelly 2007 SLT (Sh Ct) 111 (rejection allowed 
10 months after sale: see further below, n. 48). This is in conformity with decisions under the Uniform 
Commercial Code – see McCullough v Bill Swad Chrysler-Plymouth 449 NE 2d 1289 (SC Ohio 1983)  
(a revocation of acceptance case (§2-608) but same issue.

amounted to rejection even though the buyer subsequently raised an action for damages only. Where, 
however, the buyer does return the faulty goods to the seller, that is likely to be taken as effective rejection: 
see Durkin v DSG Retail Ltd 2008 GWD 14-254 (Sheriff J. K. Tierney). The latter case was ultimately taken

Rejection of the goods, rescission and specific performance	 443
Loss of the right to reject
Even though the seller may be guilty of a breach of condition and the buyer may prima 
facie be entitled to repudiate the contract and reject the goods, he may in certain 
circumstances lose this right, and have to accept the goods and be content with a claim 
for damages. It is now necessary to examine the circumstances in which this may occur 
and, first of all, s. 11(4) must be set out in full (although it is to be noted that it does not 
apply in Scotland). In its present form this reads as follows:
Subject to section 35A below, where a contract of sale is not severable, and the buyer has 
accepted the goods, or part of them, the breach of a condition to be fulfilled by the seller can 
only be treated as a breach of warranty, and not as a ground for rejecting the goods and treating 
the contract as repudiated, unless there is an express or implied term of the contract to that 
effect.
Loss of right to reject through passing of property
In its original form (as s. 11(1)(c) of the 1893 Act, which also had no application in 
Scotland)41 this provision had a much wider effect. According to the original words 
of s. 11(1)(c), if the contract was for the sale of specific goods the buyer lost his right 
of rejection when the property passed to him.42 Many writers had pointed out the 
difficulties which arose from this paragraph when read in conjunction with s. 18, Rule 1. 
This Rule is generally taken to mean that, in the absence of a contrary intention, in a 
sale of specific goods the property passes as soon as the contract is made, with the result 
that the right of rejection arose and was lost at the very same minute.
This was such an obviously unsatisfactory conclusion that methods of escape were 
sought. First, in a number of cases the courts attempted to avoid the whole difficulty by 
holding that in most (if not all) sales of specific goods the sale was not unconditional 
within the meaning of s. 18, Rule 1. In the second place, buyers sometimes rested their 
case on allegations of mistake and of innocent misrepresentation. Neither of these 
methods of evasion of s. 11(1)(c) proved very successful, although the possibilities of 
the latter remained, to some extent, unsettled. It was plain, however, that no satisfactory 
solution existed to these difficulties except the repeal of the words ‘or where the 
contract is for specific goods the property in which has passed to the buyer’ and this was 
eventually effected by s. 4(1) of the Misrepresentation Act 1967. Since then, the right to 
reject the goods has, in all cases of sales of specific and unascertained goods alike, been 
lost by acceptance and acceptance alone.
41	 See, for the effect, Nelson v Chalmers 1913 SC 441.
42	 Historically, the implied terms were conditions only in the case of unascertained goods: in the case of 
specific goods, they were mere warranties giving rise to an action for damages only, not a right of rejection. 
Having regard to this, the rule codified, that the right to reject was lost when the contract was made in the 
case of specific goods, is comprehensible. At all events, the passing of property had no effect on the right of 
rejection in sales of unascertained goods following the 1893 Act: McDougall v Aeromarine of Emsworth 
Ltd [1958] 1 WLR 1126. In Perkins v Bell [1893] 1 QB 193, buyers of unascertained goods lost their right of 
rejection on the passing of property, but it could equally have been said that they had accepted the goods.

	444	 The remedies of the buyer
Loss of right to reject through acceptance
A few preliminary comments on the concept of acceptance and its relationship to other 
legal doctrines are necessary. First, the provisions of the Act concerning acceptance must 
be read against the general common law doctrines of affirmation, waiver and estoppel 
(Scoticé, homologation, waiver, personal bar). The concept of affirmation is in some 
respects a general common law principle parallel to the concept of acceptance, but 
there are important differences between them. In particular, it is generally held that an 
innocent party who wishes to terminate a contract because of a breach of condition (or a 
repudiatory breach) by the other party cannot be treated as having affirmed the contract 
unless he knew of the breach, and of his right to terminate.43 On the other hand, a buyer 
can be held to have accepted the goods, and so lost his right of rejection under the Sale 
of Goods Act, even where he did not know of the seller’s breach or of his rights. This 
means that termination for breach is, in principle, often possible long after the breach 
occurs as the facts may only then come to light, but acceptance is usually something 
which happens very shortly after delivery in a contract of sale. It is not usually possible 
to reject goods long after delivery because some latent or hidden defect comes to light 
months or years after the goods are delivered.44
The Law Commissions discussed this question in their Report of 1987,45 but 
recommended against any change in the law which would confer a long-term right of 
rejection on the buyer, where (for instance) serious defects come to light in the goods long 
after they are delivered. The chief reason for rejecting such a change seems to have been 
that it would introduce new complications regarding the use and benefit which the buyer 
may have had from the goods. At present, as rejection must take place within a relatively 
short period, it is possible for the law to insist that rejection of the goods produces a 
total failure of consideration, so that the buyer is entitled to the full repayment of his 
price. But if the law recognised a long-term right of rejection, it would hardly be possible 
to maintain this position, and the seller might well expect some credit for the use the 
buyer has had from the goods, even where the buyer does not seek damages. This would 
weaken the buyer’s bargaining position where he rejects (or wants to reject) the goods, 
and introduce complications which the law currently avoids. Of course, nothing said 
here detracts from the possibility of the buyer being able to pursue a claim for damages 
where hidden defects come to light long after delivery.46
In addition to the common law concept of affirmation, which is largely replaced 
for contracts of sale by the concept of acceptance, there are also other common law 
doctrines – such as waiver and estoppel (personal bar) – which are still frequently applied 
to contracts of sale, especially in commercial situations. Thus, a buyer who makes clear 
and unequivocal representations (whether by express words, or by implication from 
43	 See Peyman v Lanjani [1985] Ch 457. But, as also held in this case, the innocent party may lose his right to 
terminate even if he does not know the facts or his rights, if he represents (by words or conduct) that he is 
affirming the contract, and the other relies to his prejudice on that implied representation.

conduct) that he will accept the goods, or that he will not reject them on the ground of 
late delivery or some other ground of that kind, may lose his right to reject them under 
these common law doctrines.47 So also a person cannot reject the goods if at the same 
time he acts in a way which is inconsistent with rejection,48 whether this amounts to an 
acceptance or not.
A second preliminary comment is that there can be no acceptance of goods which the 
seller had no right to sell and, in such a case, the mere fact that the buyer has retained and 
used the goods does not prevent his rejecting them and recovering the full price as on a 
total failure of consideration.49 It has been said, however, that ‘Clearly the answer would 
not have been the same if the buyer, with knowledge of the true facts, had continued to 
use the [goods] for another twelve months or so, and had then found that the market had 
fallen and that he would like to hand [them] back again.’50
Thirdly, a buyer who is entitled to reject goods for breach must, of course, mitigate his 
damage according to the ordinary rule. However, he cannot, it would seem, be required 
by this principle to accept goods when he wants to reject them (at all events when the 
goods are defective in quality),51 nor to reject them when he wants to accept them.52
Fourthly, it should be observed that the buyer’s right to reject defective goods may be, 
and very often is, qualified by express contractual provisions.53 In some cases, restrictions 
on the right to reject may be imposed by making the right conditional on, for example, 
testing or sampling the goods. In others, there may be stringent time limits within which 
notice of rejection may be given, and so forth. In all such cases, the provisions of the 
contract prevail, though subject, where appropriate, to the reasonableness requirements 
of the Unfair Contract Terms Act.
The meaning of ‘acceptance’ depends on the construction of ss. 34 to 35A(1), which 
are now as follows:
34  Unless otherwise agreed, when the seller tenders delivery of goods to the buyer, he is bound 
on request to afford the buyer a reasonable opportunity of examining the goods for the 
purpose of ascertaining whether they are in conformity with the contract, and in the case 
of a contract for sale by sample, of comparing the bulk with the sample.[54]
35  (1)  The buyer is deemed to have accepted the goods subject to subsection (2) below—
(a)	 when he intimates to the seller that he has accepted them, or
(b)	 when the goods have been delivered to him and he does any act in relation to them 
which is inconsistent with the ownership of the seller.

a reasonable opportunity of examining them for the purpose –

(b)	 in the case of a contract for sale by sample, of comparing the bulk with the

(3)	 Where the buyer deals as consumer … the buyer cannot lose his right to rely on sub-
section (2) above by agreement, waiver or otherwise.
(4)	 The buyer is also deemed to have accepted the goods when after the lapse of a rea-
sonable time he retains the goods without intimating to the seller that he has rejected 
them.
(5)	 The questions that are material in determining for the purposes of subsection (4) 
above whether a reasonable time has elapsed include whether the buyer has had a 
reasonable opportunity of examining the goods for the purposes mentioned in sub-
section (2) above.
(6)	 The buyer is not by virtue of this section deemed to have accepted the goods merely 
because –
(a)	 he asks for, or agrees to, their repair by or under arrangements with the seller, 
or
(b)	 the goods are delivered to another under a sub-sale or other disposition.
(7)	 Where the contract is for the sale of goods making one or more commercial units, 
a buyer accepting any goods included in a unit is deemed to have accepted all the 
goods making the unit; and in this subsection, ‘commercial unit’ means a unit divi-
sion of which would materially impair the value of the goods or the character of the 
unit.
[Subsection (8) which applies to contracts made before 22 April 196755 is omitted. The text 
of the new s. 35A which follows subsection (8) is set out at pp. 457 where it is dealt with.]
It will be seen that under these sections there are, in principle, three ways in which the 
seller can accept the goods and so lose his right to reject them. First, he can expressly 
intimate that he accepts the goods; secondly, he can perform an act ‘inconsistent with 
the ownership of the seller’; and, thirdly, he may simply retain the goods for a reasonable 
time, without rejecting them. It should be noted that, even if the right to reject is lost 
under s. 35, the seller’s failure to remedy the relevant defects may constitute a repudiation 
of the contract by the seller which the buyer can accept and in addition seek damages for 
the losses incurred.56
We will now examine these three ways in which the seller can lose the right to reject 
in turn.
Acceptance by express intimation
The first way in which the buyer can accept the goods appears simple enough, but 
the question was discussed by the Law Commissions57 whether a signed ‘acceptance 
note’ which a buyer simply signs without reading when the goods are delivered to him 
55	This applies the provisions to be found in Sch. 1, para. 10 to such contracts.

Rejection of the goods, rescission and specific performance	 447
or her58 and before the buyer has examined them, or had an opportunity to examine 
them, can be treated as a true acceptance within the meaning of the sections. It must 
be appreciated that an express intimation of acceptance for the purposes of s. 35 has 
a rather special significance and must be interpreted accordingly. Such an acceptance 
amounts in substance and effect to a waiver of the right to reject the goods; it thus falls 
mid-way between a mere receipt or acknowledgment of delivery, on the one hand, and 
a complete waiver of all claims arising out of the sale, on the other hand. A person who 
simply signs a delivery note when goods are delivered in pursuance of a contract of sale 
plainly intends to do no more than to acknowledge receipt of the goods; it would be 
absurd to attribute to the buyer the intention to waive the right to reject. The problem, 
of course, is that if the buyer signs a printed form placed in front of him or her without 
reading it, and the form declares that the buyer accepts the goods within the meaning of 
s. 35 of the Act, there may be a tendency to treat this as binding on the buyer.59 It seems 
unlikely that this in fact would have been held to be the case,60 but the Law Commissions 
recommended that the law should anyhow be amended by making it clear that an 
intimation of acceptance is not in fact a binding acceptance if it occurs before the buyer 
has had a chance to examine the goods. This is the purpose of subsections (2) and (3) of 
the new provisions. It is also intended that a non-consumer buyer should not be deemed 
to have accepted the goods until it has had a reasonable opportunity of examining them, 
but in this case it will be possible (subject to the Unfair Contract Terms Act) for the 
parties to agree otherwise.61
It is also possible that a buyer accepts the goods in such a manner as to waive, not 
merely the right to reject, but also any claim for damages which he or she may have. A 
buyer who actually examines some specific item and finds it defective in some minor 
respects, but accepts it without demur, may thus find that he or she has lost both the 
right to reject and the right to claim damages. This latter right, however, being more 
fundamental, is less easily lost. A real waiver or circumstances giving rise to a promissory 
estoppel may be necessary to deprive the buyer of the right to claim damages where 
defective goods are ‘accepted’ by him.62
Acceptance by an act inconsistent with the ownership of the seller
Much the most difficult questions concerning acceptance involve the second method 
mentioned in s. 35, and the difficulty was originally compounded because the 1893 Act 
did not expressly state whether s. 34 or s. 35 was the governing section. It therefore left 
open the position where the buyer had not had a reasonable opportunity of examining 
58	 Where the buyer deals as consumer the buyer cannot lose his or her right of rejection in this way – see  
s. 35(3) dealt with below.

60	 Given the wide interpretation placed on s. 13 of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 by the Court of Appeal 
in cases such as Stewart Gill v Horatio Myer & Co Ltd [1992] 2 All ER 257 and Fastframe Ltd v Lohinski 3 
March 1993 (unreported) it might be that such acceptance notes would be held to be subject to that Act. See 
p. 203.

	448	 The remedies of the buyer
the goods within s. 34, but did something which brought him within s. 35. It is quite 
possible for the buyer to do some act inconsistent with the ownership of the seller before 
he has had a reasonable opportunity for examining the goods and, in this event there 
was formerly a serious conflict between s. 34 and s. 35. The former said that in such 
circumstances the buyer was not deemed to have accepted the goods, and s. 35 said that 
in these circumstances the buyer was deemed to have accepted the goods.63
In Hardy & Co Ltd v Hillerns & Fowler,64 the Court of Appeal held that s. 35 was 
the governing section. The facts of the case illustrate the hardship to the buyer which 
resulted from this interpretation of the Act. A contracted to sell to B wheat to be shipped 
from South America. The ship carrying the wheat arrived at Hull on 18 March. On 21 
March, B resold a part of the cargo and dispatched it to the sub-buyers. On 23 March, 
B had his first opportunity to examine the goods and, on doing so, found them not to 
conform to the contract. It was held that by reselling the goods the buyers had done an 
act inconsistent with the ownership of the sellers within s. 35 and that they had therefore 
accepted the goods and lost their right of rejection.65
This decision was distinguished by a New Zealand court in Hammer & Barrow v 
Coca-Cola,66 although the facts of the cases were very similar. In this case, the plaintiffs 
contracted to sell some goods to the defendants, it being a term of the contract that the 
goods would be delivered to the premises of a third party to whom the defendant had 
previously contracted to supply the same goods. Richmond J emphasised that under s. 
35 two requirements must be satisfied before a buyer can be deemed to have accepted 
the goods in the second of the three ways mentioned in that section. First, the goods 
must have been delivered to him and, secondly, he must have done some act inconsistent 
with the seller’s ownership. The learned judge held that, in dispatching the goods to 
the third party, the seller was acting as a seller delivering the goods to the buyer in 
accordance with the contract of sale. Nothing had been done thereafter which could be 
treated as inconsistent with the seller’s ownership. In E & S Ruben Ltd v Faire Bros & 
Co Ltd,67 on the other hand, Hilbery J held that, in delivering the goods to the carrier 
for transmission to the third party, the sellers were acting as agents for the buyer and 
that the goods must be treated as notionally delivered to the buyers before they were 
delivered to the carriers. The delivery to the carriers was, therefore, evidence of an act 
subsequent to delivery to the buyer which could be treated as inconsistent with the 
seller’s ownership.
These cases left the law in an unsatisfactory state. It is common practice for goods 
to be bought and resold without examination until they are delivered to the sub-buyer.  
In these circumstances, the sub-buyer retained the right to reject the goods while the

Rejection of the goods, rescission and specific performance	 449
middle buyer was deemed to have ‘accepted’ them and so was deprived of his right to 
reject. The law was accordingly altered by s. 4(2) of the Misrepresentation Act 1967, 
which inserted in s. 35 of the Sale of Goods Act the words ‘(except where section 34 
of the Act otherwise provides)’, thereby making it clear that s. 34 was the governing 
section.68 The position, therefore, was that the buyer was deemed to have accepted the 
goods: (a) when he intimated to the seller that he had accepted them, or (b) (except 
where section 34 of the Act otherwise provided) when the goods had been delivered to 
him, and (i) he did any act which is inconsistent with the ownership of the seller, or (ii) 
when, after lapse of a reasonable time, he retained the goods without intimating to the 
seller that he had rejected them.69
There is no doubt that this was a considerable improvement in the law, but it became 
reasonably evident that it did not go far enough. Since the buyer cannot reject, in any 
event, unless he is in a position to restore the goods to the seller,70 why should he lose 
the right to reject merely because he has done an act inconsistent with the ownership 
of the seller and has had an opportunity to examine the goods? Suppose the buyer 
failed to take the opportunity, or failed to discover the defect in question, and then 
resold and delivered to a sub-buyer. If the sub-buyer immediately discovered the defect 
and returned the goods to the buyer, the buyer would still be unable to reject the goods 
notwithstanding the new s. 35. Yet the fact that the buyer had done an act which might 
affect his ability to restore the goods to the seller was surely no reason for depriving 
him of his right to reject when in fact it did not affect his ability so to restore the 
goods.
The Law Commissions largely agreed with these criticisms of the law,71 and the 
present s. 35(6)(b) provides that the buyer is not deemed to have accepted goods merely 
because the goods are delivered to another under a sub-sale or other disposition.
Unfortunately, the present provision leaves a consequential point somewhat unclear. 
This problem is that it will now be uncertain what is to happen where the sub-buyer 
rejects the goods without returning them to the buyer. Is the buyer then also to be 
entitled to reject the goods while they remain physically situated at the premises of the 
sub-buyer? It will be remembered that under s. 36 of the Act, the buyer is not bound 
to return the goods to the seller when he rejects them; it is sufficient that he intimates 
to the seller that the goods are at his disposal. Similarly, if the buyer arranges for the 
retransport of the goods from the sub-buyer, can he charge the seller with the cost of 
this in addition to rejecting the goods? Prior to the passing of the Misrepresentation 
Act, the position on this point was somewhat obscure.72 But since that Act, the position

69	 This sub-division into paragraphs was not in the 1979 Act itself, and it was not entirely clear whether the 
words in brackets, which were first inserted by the 1967 Act, did control the third limb of the section, as they 
clearly would if the Act were set out as it is in the text. It is also to be noted that the words in brackets clearly 
did not control the first limb of the section (express intimation of acceptance), so, as mentioned above,  
p. 446, such intimation would be effective even if the buyer had not had a chance to examine the goods. But 
the new provisions alter the law on this point – see above, p. 447 et seq.

Fowler – see above – but became good law again following the 1967 amendments to the Sale of Goods Act.

	450	 The remedies of the buyer
seemed to depend on whether the buyer had had a reasonable opportunity to examine 
the goods and so lost his right to reject.
Under the law prior to 3 January 1995, the buyer still lost his right of rejection if he 
had had a reasonable opportunity to examine the goods and had resold and delivered 
the goods to a sub-buyer. In Perkins v Bell,73 it was held that prima facie the place of 
delivery to the buyer was the place where he ought to examine the goods, and if he chose 
to redispatch the goods to the sub-buyer without examining them he would (it seemed) 
lose his right to reject. In this case, the seller sold barley to the defendant for delivery at 
T railway station. The defendant could have examined the barley there but he sent it on 
to sub-buyers, who later rejected it. The buyer was held to have lost his right to reject 
and the principal reason for this seems to have been the court’s view that it would be 
unjust to compel the seller to collect the barley from the sub-buyer’s premises. What the 
court did not consider was whether this injustice could not be avoided by a less drastic 
step than depriving the buyer of his right to reject. Justice would have been done and 
the seller’s interest secured if the court had held that the buyer could reject, provided 
that he put the goods at the seller’s disposal at the place where they were delivered to 
him. Unfortunately, the effect of s. 34 and s. 35 as they were in the 1979 Act was still to 
deprive the buyer of the right to reject in this situation.74
What is more, the effect of the amended provisions on this point is obscure. Section 
35(6)(b) makes it clear that the mere fact of delivery under a subcontract will not now be 
treated as an act inconsistent with the ownership of the seller; but will the buyer’s refusal 
to recollect the goods from the sub-buyer make any difference? Given s. 36 of the Act, 
it seems that the answer will probably be ‘no’, but the results may be somewhat drastic 
if the goods have (for instance) been shipped to a sub-buyer overseas, who ultimately 
rejects them on arrival, so that the buyer in turn then rejects them too. Presumably, in 
this situation it will be the seller’s responsibility to arrange for the handling of the goods 
at their overseas destination, even though the seller is a purely domestic producer who 
did not sell for export himself, and had no reason to know that the goods were going to 
be exported. Under the 1979 Act that result would be avoided because the delivery under 
the sub-sale would be an act inconsistent with the ownership of the seller, so the buyer 
would not have the right at all to reject in this situation.75
There are some cases in which the courts are prepared to hold that the place of delivery 
to the buyer is not a reasonable place to examine the goods,76 and, in this situation, the 
buyer does not lose his right to reject when the goods have been resold and delivered, 
even under the 1979 Act. Moreover, in this case the responsibility for retransporting the 
goods to the original place of delivery will be the seller’s. For instance, in Molling & 
Co v Dean & Son,77 the plaintiffs made 40,000 books to the defendants’ order, knowing 
that they were intended for shipment and resale to an American sub-buyer. Indeed, the 
plaintiffs printed the books with the sub-buyer’s imprint and packed them for shipment

to him. They were delivered to the defendants, who consigned them to the sub-buyers 
without examination. The sub-buyers rejected and the defendants brought the goods 
back to England at their own cost. It was held that they were entitled to reject the 
goods and also to recover the cost of transport on the ground that the proper place for 
inspection was on delivery to the sub-buyers. Hence, the buyers had not had a reasonable 
opportunity to examine the goods. Consequently, under the 1979 Act this decision is 
now clearly good law: the buyer would be deemed not to have accepted the goods under 
s. 34 because he had not had a reasonable opportunity to examine them under s. 35. The 
new provisions do not affect this sort of case, and the result anyhow seems perfectly 
reasonable.
‘Act inconsistent with the ownership of the seller’
An unhappy feature still retained following the 1994 Act’s amendments is the reference 
in s. 35 to an act ‘inconsistent with the ownership of the seller’. This suggests that the 
ownership of the goods cannot pass until the buyer has accepted them, but of course this 
is not so. Furthermore, if the property has already passed to the buyer, how can he be 
said to do an act inconsistent with ‘the ownership of the seller’? One possible answer is 
to be found in the judgment of Devlin J in Kwei Tek Chao v British Traders & Shippers 
Ltd.78 If the property has passed in circumstances in which the buyer retains the right to 
reject, the passing is merely conditional:
He [the buyer] gets only conditional property in the goods, the condition being a condition 
subsequent. All his dealings with the documents[79] are dealings only with that conditional 
property in the goods. It follows, therefore, that there can be no dealing which is inconsistent 
with the seller’s ownership unless he deals with something more than the conditional property. 
If the property passes altogether, not being subject to any condition, there is no ownership left 
in the seller with which any inconsistent act under s. 35 could be committed. If the property 
passes conditionally the only ownership left in the seller is the reversionary interest in the 
property in the event of the condition subsequent operating to restore it to him. It is that 
reversionary interest with which the buyer must not, save with the penalty of accepting the 
goods, commit an inconsistent act.80
What this comes to can perhaps be put more simply. Although the property in the goods 
may have passed to the buyer, if he is still entitled to reject them and does reject them, 
the property will revest in the seller, and he will then become owner of the goods again.
But Devlin J’s way of putting the law does not help to decide whether any other sort 
of act should be held inconsistent with the ownership of the seller. For example, if goods 
are bought for use or consumption, what kind of use would be inconsistent with the 
seller’s ownership? If the seller’s reversionary right is only to receive the goods in the 
state in which they are when the buyer rejects them, this formula simply gives no answer 
to the question, what sort of use by the buyer will prevent rejection? The truth is that 
the phrase ‘an act inconsistent with the ownership of the seller’ is one with no fixed 
78	 [1954] 2 QB 459.
79	The case was concerned with a sale on c.i.f. terms, but the reasoning on this part of the case applies to all 
sales of goods.

	452	 The remedies of the buyer
meaning. The court is, in effect, empowered to decide whether it thinks that the buyer 
ought to be entitled to reject the goods according to the circumstances of the case. In 
order to ascertain what meaning the phrase has, therefore, it is necessary to examine 
the case law to see what acts the courts have in fact held to be inconsistent with the 
ownership of the seller.
It will be apparent from the above discussion that much the most common type 
of act ‘inconsistent with the ownership of the seller’ was a resale and delivery of the 
goods.81 The authorities did not go much beyond this. At all events, even under the 
former provisions, there seems to have been no case in which the mere fact of a sub-
sale, without more, and in particular without delivery, was held to deprive the buyer 
of his right to reject.82 It may well be that following the decision in Kwei Tek Chao v 
British Traders & Shippers Ltd,83 the courts would have held that nothing short of actual 
delivery would have this effect. Certainly, it was said that a buyer was not deemed to have 
accepted the goods merely because he has made inquiries with a view to their resale, 
even after discovering them to be defective.84 In Australia, it was also held that a claim 
by the buyer against the insurer in respect of damage to the goods was not inconsistent 
with the seller’s ownership.85 The effect of the new provisions is that the former of these 
decisions is confirmed by implication; if resale and delivery to a sub-buyer is not by 
itself to be treated as an act inconsistent with the ownership of the seller, obviously 
preliminary steps on the way to this result cannot have this effect either.
Documentary sales
In the British Traders & Shippers case, Devlin J, after giving his explanation of the 
phrase ‘an act inconsistent with the ownership of the seller’, went on to hold that in 
documentary sales the buyer is not deprived of his right to reject merely by dealing with 
the documents:
So long as he [the buyer] is merely dealing with the documents he is not purporting to do 
anything more than pledge the conditional property which he has. Similarly, if he sells the 
documents of title he sells the conditional property. But if, as was done in Hardy & Co v 
Hillerns & Fowler,[86] when the goods have been landed, he physically deals with the goods 
and delivers them to his sub-buyer, he is doing an act which is inconsistent with the seller’s 
reversionary interest.87
The result of this case appeared to be that in a documentary sale the buyer had two 
distinct rights of rejection: a right to reject documents not conforming to the contract, 
and a right to reject the goods themselves if they failed to conform to the contract. A 
dealing with the documents might deprive the buyer of his right to reject the documents, 
but could not deprive him of his right to reject the goods. However, it now seems that

Rejection of the goods, rescission and specific performance	 453
this is not really a very satisfactory statement of the law. At least three qualifications 
need to be made to Devlin J’s exposition. The first is that if (as sometimes happens) 
the goods arrive before the shipping documents, and the buyer physically takes delivery 
or otherwise deals in the goods, he will be held to have accepted them.88 There will be 
no separate right of rejection of the documents when they arrive unless perhaps these 
disclose additional breaches of contract not previously known to the buyer.
The second qualification that needs to be made to Devlin J’s statement of the law is 
that the buyer’s acceptance of the documents may very well deprive him of his right to 
reject the goods where the breach of contract relating to the documents and the breach 
relating to the goods are in effect one breach only, and not two distinct breaches. Thus, 
if the goods are shipped late and this fact appears from the documents, the seller is, in 
principle, in breach of his obligations both as regards the documents and as regards 
the goods. Nevertheless, it is unreal to treat this as involving two separate breaches, 
and if the buyer accepts the documents he may well be treated as having waived the 
seller’s breach and thus be bound to accept the goods.89 Thus, even though acceptance of  
(or dealing with) the documents may not strictly amount to an act inconsistent with the 
seller’s ownership, the buyer may be unable to reject the goods on other grounds in such 
circumstances, such as waiver or estoppel.
The third qualification that needs to be made to Devlin J’s statement of the law in 
the British Traders & Shippers case is that whatever the law may say about dealing with 
the documents not amounting to a dealing with the goods, in practice such a dealing 
may affect the buyer’s power to reject the goods. If he has resold the documents, for 
instance, he will hardly be able to reject the goods unless the sub-buyer himself rejects – 
but equally he is unlikely to want to reject except in this case. In the case of a pledge, 
however, the position may be more difficult because the buyer may be unable to reject 
the goods without the consent of the pledgee, who may insist on being paid off first. 
Certainly this appears to be the effect of the Uniform Customs.90 Therefore, where the 
price has been paid to the seller by a banker’s credit against documents, the buyer will 
in practice have to pay off the bank to obtain a release of the documents before he can 
return them to the seller and so reject the goods.
Goods bought for use
Where goods are bought for use, a somewhat different approach may be necessary in 
defining the meaning of an ‘act inconsistent with the ownership of the seller’, though 
there is little authority directly in point.91 Probably any substantial or repeated or

Izegen [1978] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 109; Bremer v C Mackprang [1979] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 220. It is controversial whether 
this is strictly a matter of waiver, or estoppel, or solely the effect of s. 35, but these differences of concept 
seem largely immaterial except for one point: under s. 35 absence of knowledge of the breach does not 
preclude a finding of ‘acceptance’, but it does seem to preclude a finding of waiver. As to estoppel, see above,

	454	 The remedies of the buyer
prolonged use would be held inconsistent with the seller’s ownership if it prevented the 
buyer returning the goods in substantially the same condition as when purchased. In 
effect, this ground of the loss of the right of rejection merges (especially in consumer 
sales) into the next ground, namely that the buyer has allowed a reasonable time to elapse 
before rejecting the goods. It is therefore dealt with further under that heading, below.
Acceptance through lapse of reasonable time
The third way in which the buyer can accept the goods within the meaning of s. 35 
is to retain them for more than a reasonable time before he informs the seller that he 
wants to reject them.92 Section 35(5) now provides that the questions that are material 
in determining for the purposes of subsection (4) above whether a reasonable time has 
elapsed include whether the buyer has had a reasonable opportunity of examining the 
goods for the purpose mentioned in subsection (2), that is, of ascertaining whether they 
are in conformity with the contract, and, in the case of a contract for sale by sample, of 
comparing the bulk with the sample.
The question of what is a reasonable time in the case of goods bought for resale 
was examined by Judge Jack QC in Truk (UK) Ltd v Tokmakidis GmbH93 in which 
a vehicle chassis with a body specially fitted by the claimant was delivered on 14 June 
1996. In December 1996, the defendant was informed by the sub-buyer that the body 
did not correspond to the chassis maker’s guidelines. The judge found that the vehicle 
had been rejected in March 1997. He laid down a number of propositions as to what 
is a reasonable time to reject the goods: (1) it was necessary to look at the question 
by balancing the opposing interests of the buyer and the seller; (2) the reasonable time 
to exercise the right to reject could not be less than the time for the buyer to have a 
reasonable opportunity to examine the goods; (3) the reasonable time to exercise a right 
to reject might well be longer than is required to examine the goods; (4) the time could 
be extended by dealings between the buyer and the seller, in particular as regards the 
repair of the goods (as had been the situation in the present case);94 and (5) there was 
only one reasonable time and not different times for different defects. What mattered in 
the present case was that the goods were to be resold. This consideration coupled with 
s. 35(6)(b) led to the conclusion that the reasonable time for rejection would normally be 
the time taken to resell the goods, together with an additional period in which they could 
be tested by the sub-buyer.
In the case of goods bought for use, this ground for treating the buyer as having 
accepted the goods tends to merge, as noted above, with the doctrine of the act 
‘inconsistent with the ownership of the seller’, as, clearly, the longer the buyer retains

Rejection of the goods, rescission and specific performance	 455
and continues to use the goods, the more difficult it will be for him to claim that his 
conduct is not inconsistent with the seller’s reversionary rights – circular though that 
argument tends to be. In these cases, the question will nearly always be one of fact: what 
is a reasonable time?
Bernstein v Pamson Motors (Golders Green) Ltd95 was something of a test case on this 
question in relation to the rejection of motor vehicles. Here, the buyer sought to reject 
a new car for serious defects causing a major breakdown on a motorway after he had 
had the car for three weeks but only done some 140 miles. While holding that the buyer 
was undoubtedly entitled to damages, Rougier J held that he had lost the right to reject 
as a reasonable time for rejection had elapsed. In Clegg v Olle Andersson,96 the Court 
of Appeal held that Bernstein v Pamson Motors no longer represented the law since the 
Sale and Supply of Goods Act 1994. Moreover, in Rogers v Parish (Scarborough) Ltd,97 
the vehicle had travelled over 5,500 miles when the plaintiffs rejected it after the lapse of 
a period of six months. Nevertheless, it seems not to have occurred to the defendants 
to argue that the right to reject had been lost.98 While in several Scottish cases, the 
sellers’ arguments that the buyers’ right to reject had been lost through lapse of time 
were likewise unsuccessful,99 in a more fully reasoned recent decision it was held that  
the buyer’s use of a car for over a year before serious defects appeared and subsequent 
failure to intimate rejection after the seller’s failed attempt at repair meant that a 
reasonable time had passed, making it not possible for the buyer to reject.100
One or two earlier cases also indicate a slightly more favourable attitude to the 
buyer. In Porter v General Guarantee Corpn,101 the plaintiff acquired a car at the end 
of January and by 4 March his solicitors were claiming the right to reject the vehicle; 
further attempts to put right the defects ensued, but on 20 March the plaintiff finally 
claimed the right to reject, and this was held not too late. This was, however, a hire-
purchase rather than a sale, and there are certain distinctions in the legal position: first, 
hire-purchase legislation contains nothing equivalent to s. 35 of the Sale of Goods Act, 
so that the loss of the right to reject is a common law matter and secondly, the supplier 
in a hire-purchase contract remains owner and hence continues to have an interest in 
the condition of the goods after delivery. This means that it may be more reasonable 
to allow a longer time for rejection in a hire-purchase contract than in a sale. The same 
comments must apply to another hire-purchase case of a Daimler in which rejection 
seems to have been permitted several months after the car was first supplied.102 Indeed, it

	 98	 Presumably, having regard to the circumstances of the case, the defendants’ legal advisers took the view that 
such an argument was not worth running. It was only on appeal that they attempted to argue this point, 
and the Court of Appeal declined to deal with it because it had been put forward only at the appeal, having 
neither been pleaded nor argued at first instance.

	456	 The remedies of the buyer
could, in theory, be argued that since hire-purchase is a contract of hire (plus an option 
to buy) the supplier should supply goods which would remain fit to be used throughout 
the period of hire – assuming, of course, that the hirer used them properly. However, the 
implied terms contained in the Supply of Goods (Implied Terms) Act 1973 (or strictly 
speaking the Consumer Credit Act 1974) are identical to those contained in the Sale 
of Goods Act and appear to require the goods to be of the required quality only at the 
time of supply. The same applies to the warranties implied in pure hire contracts by 
the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982. In UCB Leasing v Holtom,103 the Court of 
Appeal held that in the case of a finance lease the issue is the fitness of the goods at the 
time of their delivery. But a finance lease and hire-purchase transactions are functional 
equivalents of sales of goods, and there may be an argument that, in hiring proper, the 
situation may be different.104
It used not to be clear what effect attempts to remedy defects might have on the 
buyer’s right to reject in these consumer cases. It is, of course, the normal response of 
the parties where defective consumer goods are sold for the buyer to demand that they 
should be repaired. And in the case of vehicles, there is often a long history of such 
attempts before the buyer finally tries to reject. In one hire-purchase case, the court 
seems to have treated the extra time taken up by such repeated attempts at repair as not 
counting against the buyer in deciding whether a reasonable time had elapsed since the 
sale,105 but it is again unclear for the reasons given above whether this kind of reasoning 
would have been applicable in a contract of sale to which the former s. 35 applied. The 
present provisions, at all events, dispose of this point because they contain s. 35(6)(a), 
which provides that the buyer is not deemed to have accepted the goods merely because 
he asks the seller for the goods to be repaired. In the commercial case of J & H Ritchie 
Ltd v Lloyd Ltd,106 however, a purchaser of defective agricultural machinery who had 
accepted the seller’s offer of repair was held at first instance unable later to reject the 
tender of repaired goods that on the evidence were conforming to the contract. The 
purchaser’s difficulty was its inability to obtain from the seller explanations as to what 
the original problem with the goods had been. For the majority of the court, so long 
as the contract remained unterminated, the seller had a continuing opportunity to 
supply conforming goods, and once it had done so, any rejection would be too late. 
The House of Lords held that the pursuer had not lost the right to reject by allowing 
the seller the opportunity to repair. This left the question as to whether the pursuer 
still had the right to reject even after the harrow had been repaired because the seller 
had failed to explain what the fault had been. The House of Lords held that there was 
a separate contract to repair the harrow, an implied term of which was that the seller 
would explain to the pursuer what the defect had been. By failing to do so, the seller 
had committed a repudiatory breach, which returned the parties to the position before

the contract to repair had been made, which meant that the pursuer still had the right 
to reject.107
Where goods are not bought for use but for resale – as in the typical commercial 
contract – the question of the reasonableness of the time for rejection rarely arises; in 
practice, either the goods are passed on to sub-buyers who reject forthwith, or they are 
accepted by the sub-buyers so that the buyers themselves have no need to worry about 
rejection. But cases can occasionally arise (for instance, where some time elapses before 
the sub-buyers reject and return the goods to the buyer) in which the reasonableness of 
the time for rejection can be in issue. In one case108 it was held that, where the sellers 
were threatening the buyers that any rejection would be treated as a breach of contract, 
the buyers were entitled to take particular care to examine the goods, and consult with 
sub-buyers, before committing themselves to rejection. A seller who insists all along 
that the goods are in accordance with the contract cannot complain if the buyer takes 
some extra time to satisfy himself beyond question that the goods are defective before he 
rejects them.
Acceptance of part of the goods
The question whether the buyer is entitled to accept part and reject part of the goods 
delivered is one of some difficulty. The opening words of s. 11(4), it will be recalled,109 
are now as follows:
Subject to section 35A below, where a contract of sale is not severable, and the buyer has 
accepted the goods or part of them, etc.
35A.  (1)  If the buyer –
(a)	 has the right to reject the goods by reason of a breach on the part of the seller 
that affects some or all of them, but
(b)	 accepts some of the goods, including, where there are any goods unaffected by 
the breach, all such goods 
he does not by accepting them lose his right to reject the rest.
	
   (2)  In the case of a buyer having the right to reject an instalment of goods, subsection 
(1) above applies as if references to the goods were references to the goods com-
prised in the instalment.
 (3)  For the purposes of subsection (1) above, goods are affected by a breach if by reason 
of the breach they are not in conformity with the contract.
 (4)  This section applies unless a contrary intention appears in, or is to be implied from, 
the contract.
Read literally, s. 11(4) only applies to a contract of sale which is not severable; but 
severability is only relevant where the buyer purports to accept part of the goods, so the 
paragraph should probably be read as meaning:
Where the buyer has accepted the goods, or where the contract of sale is not severable and the 
buyer has accepted part of the goods, [etc.]

(1968) – replacement of transmission of automobile with one of unknown provenance.

109	 See p. 443. Section 11(4) does not apply in Scotland, but s. 35A does.

	458	 The remedies of the buyer
Assuming that this is the correct construction, it seems clear that if the contract is 
severable the buyer is entitled to reject goods not conforming to the contract and to accept 
the balance of the goods if he chooses to do so. (He may also be entitled to throw up the 
entire contract in the circumstances referred to in s. 31(2), as previously discussed.)110 
Even this proposition may seem open to theoretical objections if the right to reject the 
goods is merely a species of the right to rescind,111 and it would seem inconsistent for the 
buyer to rescind the contract while retaining part of the goods. However, this objection 
is purely academic; as a matter of practical convenience, it is plainly right that the buyer 
should be entitled to accept part and reject part of the goods in the case of severable 
contracts. (The position under the new provisions in the case of severable contracts is 
dealt with below.)
A further question arises in relation to the above discussion: what contracts are 
severable?
What contracts are severable?
This is not a question which has been the subject of much judicial discussion. It will 
be recalled that, under s. 31(2), a contract is severable if the goods are to be delivered 
in instalments and the instalments are to be separately paid for. But it is clear that a 
contract may be severable in many other situations also. For instance, a contract for the 
sale of a quantity of cloth was held to be severable where the cloth was to be delivered in 
instalments although the price was to be paid by monthly account and not separately for 
each instalment.112 And a contract for the sale of some motor accessories was held to be 
severable purely on the ground that the contract specified ‘deliveries as required’.113 This 
was interpreted to mean that the goods would necessarily be delivered in instalments 
and it was assumed that this was enough to render the contract severable. In other cases, 
a buyer has been held entitled to accept part and reject part of the goods, though it has 
not always been clear whether this was on the ground that the contract was severable.114
Export contracts often provide that the seller is entitled to ship the goods in separate 
loads and that in this event each shipment is to be considered a distinct contract. Such 
a clause gives the seller the option to treat the contract as an entire contract by shipping 
the goods in one load, or to treat it as severable and ship different loads.115 If he ships the 
goods in different lots it may be important for the buyer’s right to reject that the contract 
be treated as severable because different loads involve different shipping documents; 
hence one load may be resold to X, who may reject the goods, and another load to Y, 
who does not reject. In this situation, the middle buyer will wish to have the right to 
reject part and accept part of the total quantity sold to him.

Rejection of the goods, rescission and specific performance	 459
Buyer’s right to accept part and reject part of goods  
in non-severable contracts
Prima facie the former s. 11(4) would seem to have prevented a buyer from accepting part 
and rejecting part of the goods if the contract was not severable. But the position was 
much complicated by s. 30(4) of the Act (now repealed), which was set out above116 and 
which provided that if the seller delivered ‘the goods he contracted to sell mixed with 
goods of a different description’ the buyer might accept the conforming goods and reject 
the rest. Section 11(4) was treated by the courts as subject to this provision117 so that, 
even if the contract was non-severable, the buyer might, in the circumstances specified in 
s. 30(4), accept part and reject part of the goods. For example, in Ebrahim Dawood Ltd v  
Heath Ltd,118 sellers contracted to sell 50 tons of steel sheet in varying lengths. In fact, 
they delivered the whole quantity in six-foot lengths. This was plainly a non-severable 
contract, yet the buyer was held entitled, under s. 30(4), to accept part of the goods and 
reject the rest.
But the buyer could only do this where the case fell within the precise wording of  
s. 30(4) (now repealed); therefore the buyer had to show that the seller had delivered ‘the 
goods that he contracted to sell mixed with goods of a different description’. We have 
already seen that119 the courts construed the words ‘the goods he contracted to sell’ as 
including the case where the seller did not deliver the correct total quantity of contract 
goods. Thus, if the seller contracted to sell 100 tons of wheat and he delivered 50 tons of 
wheat and 50 tons of barley, he had delivered ‘the goods he contracted to sell mixed with 
goods of a different description’.
However, s. 30(4) did not apply where the goods delivered by the seller were all of the 
contract description but some part of them were of unmerchantable quality.120 In this 
situation, the buyer could not reject part and accept part of the goods under s. 30(4) and 
would therefore only be able to do this under s. 11(4) if the contract was severable. Nor 
did s. 30(4) apply where all the goods were unmerchantable or failed to conform to the 
contract. Such a case also had to be governed solely by s. 11(4).
Some hypothetical examples may make the point clearer. Suppose, for example, that 
a person bought 700 bags of nuts from a seller. Prima facie that was (and still is) a non-
severable contract, that is, it is a contract for the sale of a quantity of nuts, the fact that 
they were in 700 bags being immaterial. If the seller delivered 700 bags and 600 were 
satisfactory, but the remaining 100 bags contained nuts which were unmerchantable, the 
buyer could not accept the 600 and reject the remainder, since ‘the contract of sale was 
not severable and the buyer has accepted the goods or part of them’. On the other hand, 
if the remaining 100 bags contained nuts of a different description, the buyer could reject 
those bags while retaining the other 600 under s. 30(4).
If the contract was a severable contract (e.g. because the nuts were to be delivered 
in instalments which were to be separately paid for) the position would be different.

	460	 The remedies of the buyer
For instance, if the 700 bags were delivered in seven instalments of 100 bags and the 
first six instalments appeared satisfactory and were accepted, but the seventh contained 
nuts which were unmerchantable or were of a different description, then the buyer could 
reject the last bags, while retaining the other 600.
But if all the bags contained unmerchantable nuts or those of a different description, 
the buyer could not accept part and reject part of the bags unless the contract was 
severable. The somewhat illogical result was that, where the contract was not severable, 
if the seller was in partial breach in delivering goods, some of which were non-contract, 
the buyer was better off than if the seller delivered goods all of which were non-contract. 
In the former case, acceptance of the part did not preclude rejection of the non-
conforming remainder, while in the latter case it did. This strange result seemed to stem 
from the fact that if all the goods were non-contract goods it was not possible to rely on 
s. 30(4), which was more favourable to the buyer than s. 11.121
The explanation for this somewhat paradoxical state of the law may well be that 
suggested by Salter J in W Barker & Co Ltd v E T Agius;122 namely, that s. 30(4) was 
never intended to apply to such a case, but was only intended to apply where the seller 
delivered not only the whole of the contract goods but also other goods of the same or 
a different description. If this construction were put on s. 30(4) it would follow that a 
buyer could never accept part and reject part of the goods covered by the contract except 
in the case implicitly covered by s. 11(4), namely where the contract was severable. But 
as a matter of policy it would have been a retrograde step to move in that direction. The 
truth was that the concept of ‘severability’ was far too narrow in this context. There 
seemed to be no sound reason of commercial policy for refusing to allow the buyer to 
accept part and reject part of the goods delivered, whether or not the contract is severable 
in the technical sense, provided only that the goods constituted different ‘commercial 
units’.123 In the hypothetical examples discussed above, for instance, it was absurd that 
a buyer of 700 bags of nuts could not accept 600 bags and reject the remainder merely 
because they were all of the same description if they were in fact unmerchantable. It was 
perhaps possible that the meaning to be attached to the word ‘severable’ in s. 11(4) of 
the Act was not so conclusively determined as to be beyond the reach of the House of 
Lords. If the word could be given a very wide meaning so as to bring it into line with the 
approach of the UCC, it would have been unnecessary to rely on the haphazard use of  
s. 30(4) to mitigate the results of applying s. 11(4).
The Law Commissions largely adopted the above proposal.124 The 1994 Act, as we 
have seen, provides that the buyer should always be entitled to reject part of the goods, 
even though he has accepted part, so long only as the goods constitute ‘different 
commercial units’.125 This made it possible to repeal s. 30(4), which seemed to have no 
other utility except that, as we have seen, it dealt with the case where the correct contract 
quantity (and quality) was delivered but was mixed with other goods.126 This possibility 
121	 This was accepted as settled law by Roskill J in Esmail v J Rosenthal & Sons Ltd [1964] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 447 at

Rejection of the goods, rescission and specific performance	 461
is now to be left to be dealt with by the courts as a matter of common law, since it 
might be excessively rigid to allow the buyer to reject in all such cases. The provisions of  
s. 11(4) remain, though these are now declared to be subject to the new right of partial 
rejection conferred by the new s. 35A. This means that in severable contracts the law 
remains unaltered, but the new right of partial rejection will in practice probably tend to 
supersede the provisions about severable contracts.
This new remedy is grafted onto the existing structure of the Act, so that it does not 
prejudge the question whether the buyer has a right of rejection at all. That question 
must still, subject to the changes made to s. 14, be answered as under the previous law. 
But if there is such a right of rejection, then, under the 1994 Act, the buyer will only lose 
it by accepting all the goods, or by accepting goods included in the same ‘commercial 
unit’, or (in the case of severable contracts), as at present, by accepting the non-
conforming goods which he could otherwise have rejected.
All this will simplify the law in a number of respects. In general, it means that the 
question of acceptance will only arise with respect to the very goods accepted, other 
goods under the same contract not being affected – except in the one, rather obvious, 
case where the goods are all part of one commercial unit. Obviously, if a buyer buys one 
commercial unit, he cannot accept part and reject part.
Relationship with rescission of the contract  
for an actionable misrepresentation127
It is an astonishing fact that the relationship in English law128 between the right to 
reject goods for breach of condition and the right to rescind for misrepresentation has 
not yet been fully explored by the courts.129 It was at one time thought that ‘a right to 
reject is merely a particular form of the right to rescind’130 but it is clear since Johnson v 
Agnew131 that this is no longer correct. Rescission of the contract ab initio differs from 
mere termination of the contract, as the former is in principle retrospective, while the 
latter is not. Termination is the appropriate remedy where one of the parties is guilty 
of a breach of contract. The circumstances in which a rejection of defective goods can 
amount to termination were discussed above. Nevertheless, the practical distinction 
127	 This book does not deal with the principles surrounding misrepresentation as such. Readers are referred to 
general books on the law of contract for a fuller treatment of this topic.
128	 In Scots law, strictly speaking, rescission is the remedy by which a contract is terminated for breach, while 
reduction is the remedy with which a contract may be invalidated on the grounds of error, fraud and others. 
Again, strictly speaking, Scots law does not treat misrepresentation as such as a ground for the invalidation 
of a contract. If a misrepresentation is intentional then a resultant contract may be struck down on the 
ground of fraud; a non-intentional misrepresentation will go to support a plea of error, typically in motive 
(see Chapter 13, above). There seems to be no doubt that a contract of sale of goods can be reduced on 
the grounds of fraud or error induced by a misrepresentation but for which the misrepresentee would 
have declined to contract. The misrepresentee may homologate the contract rather than reduce it, but it is 
unclear how this relates to the doctrine of acceptance barring rejection. On the other issues raised in this 
section, Scots law is best regarded as undeveloped.
129	 This problem arises in relation to Art. 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code because Art. 1-103 preserves 
the principles of common law and equity. However, there are cases where the effect of a unilateral mistake 
arising out of an innocent misrepresentation has been discussed – see, e.g., Harney-Morgan Chevrolet Olds 
Co v Rabin 37 UCC Rep Serv 50 (1983).

	462	 The remedies of the buyer
between rescission and a termination arising from the rejection of defective goods (or 
faulty documents) is not nearly so great as the conceptual divide between rescission and 
termination may suggest. In particular, where the buyer rejects the goods or documents, 
having the right to do so, the effect is very much the same as where the contract is 
rescinded. The termination of the contract does here have some retrospective results – 
for instance, if the property has passed to the buyer, it revests in the seller, and if the 
buyer has paid the price he is entitled to recover it. So the relationship between the right 
to rescind and the right to reject is very close.
The first question which must be answered is whether the remedy of rescission of 
a contract of sale of goods for misrepresentation has survived the Sale of Goods Act. 
The point seems never to have been argued in England and the answer depends upon 
whether the rules of common law saved by s. 62 include the rules of equity. In Riddiford v  
Warren,132 the New Zealand Court of Appeal held, on the construction of an identical 
statute, that they did not and that the right to rescind for innocent misrepresentation 
could no longer be applied to contracts for the sale of goods. The judgment of Atkin LJ 
in Re Wait,133 an extract from which is quoted above, is also very much in point. Atkin 
LJ there pointed out that a code which only set out the common law rules, and left 
equitable rights inconsistent with them, would have been futile.
On the other hand, it never seems to have been doubted that the Act leaves the general 
law relating to fraud unaffected, and the rules concerning fraud include the right to 
rescind for fraudulent misrepresentation. Then there are a number of cases in which 
it has been assumed that a contract of sale of goods may be rescinded for innocent 
misrepresentation in an appropriate case. In Abram Steamship Co Ltd v Westville 
Shipping Co Ltd134 the House of Lords, in a Scots appeal, upheld the rescission of a 
contract for the assignment of the benefit of a shipbuilding contract. The contract 
rescinded in this case was treated as a mere assignment of the shipbuilding contract, 
but since the ship was already under construction it seems that it also involved the sale 
of the ship itself. More recently, the Court of Appeal has several times assumed that 
rescission is available for contracts of sale of goods. In particular, in Leaf v International 
Galleries,135 the Court of Appeal clearly thought that the remedy was available in a 
suitable case, although they denied it there because of unreasonable delay. And again, 
in Long v Lloyd,136 the Court of Appeal seems to have had no doubt that the remedy 
was available. Finally, in Goldsmith v Rodger,137 the Court of Appeal actually rescinded 
a contract of sale of goods. In this case the misrepresentor was the buyer, but the court 
held that the remedy of rescission is equally open to either party.
It seems certain, therefore, that an English court would not now follow the  
New Zealand Court of Appeal.
Assuming, then, that this remedy is still available, it becomes a matter of some import-
ance to decide when exactly it can be invoked, what is the relationship between the right

Rejection of the goods, rescission and specific performance	 463
of rejection and the right of rescission, and what is the effect of the Misrepresentation 
Act 1967. The first two of these problems were considered at some length in Leaf v 
International Galleries138 and Long v Lloyd,139 although neither case can be regarded as 
wholly satisfactory owing to the many difficult points which were glossed over. But as a 
result of the provisions of the Misrepresentation Act, these cases can now be dealt with 
quite shortly.
In Leaf v International Galleries, the plaintiff bought a picture from the defendants, 
which was stated by them to be a Constable. Some five years later, the plaintiff sought 
rescission of the contract on the ground that this was an innocent misrepresentation 
(fraud was not alleged) for which the normal equitable remedy should be available. The 
Court of Appeal decided that, assuming the plaintiff to have this right, he was in any 
case too late to rescind since five years was far more than a reasonable time. Similarly, in 
Long v Lloyd, the plaintiff bought a second-hand lorry from the defendant on the faith 
of certain statements made by the latter as to its condition. Despite repeated complaints 
by the plaintiff to the defendant – which the defendant made some attempt to meet –  
the plaintiff continued to use the lorry until it broke down more or less completely, 
though only a few days after he had bought it. Again the plaintiff claimed rescission for 
misrepresentation, and again the court decided that he was too late, apparently on the 
ground that the buyer had accepted the lorry.
Two questions which gave rise to difficulties in these cases have been set at rest by 
the Misrepresentation Act. First, it is not now material to inquire whether a statement 
in this kind of case becomes incorporated into the contract as a contractual term. For 
by s. 1(a) of the Misrepresentation Act, the fact that a pre-contractual representation 
has become a term of the contract does not in itself deprive the innocent party of the 
right to rescind. Secondly, the rule in Seddon v North East Salt Co140 (sometimes also 
called the rule in Angel v Jay)141 barring rescission of an executed contract for innocent 
misrepresentation was abolished by s. 1(b) of the Act. Therefore, the vexed question 
whether this rule applied to contracts of sale of goods cannot now arise, at least in 
England.142 This means that rescission of such a contract will only be barred on one of 
the other grounds on which rescission may be barred, that is by affirmation, lapse of 
time, inability to make restitutio in integrum, or the acquisition of rights by an innocent 
third party. It seems probable that, so far as concerns the right of a buyer to rescind, 
the effect of the Act will be to put rejection for breach of condition and rescission for 
innocent misrepresentation largely on the same footing. An act which constitutes an 
acceptance within the meaning of s. 35 will presumably amount to an affirmation of the 
contract within normal equitable principles.
But there appear to be at least two situations in which the rules governing acceptance 
in s. 35 differ from the equitable principles governing rescission for misrepresentation. 
First, we have seen that, under s. 35, if the goods are delivered to the buyer and he does

139	 [1958] 1 WLR 753. See further on this case a note by Grunfeld (1958) 21 MLR 550 and another by Professor

142	 With the exception of the modifications to s. 35 effected by s. 4(2), the Misrepresentation Act 1967 does not 
extend to Scotland.

	464	 The remedies of the buyer
not within a reasonable time intimate that he rejects the goods, he is deemed to have 
accepted them.143 But in equity it seems that lapse of time by itself does not prevent 
rescission: it will only do so if it is evidence of affirmation or if the representor is thereby 
prejudiced.144 Since it is possible that a reasonable time for rejection may elapse without 
the seller being prejudiced by the delay, it seems that equity might allow rescission in a 
case where rejection would be barred under s. 35.
Another possible divergence concerns the buyer who has had a reasonable opportunity 
to examine the goods and has resold and delivered them to a sub-buyer. As we have 
seen,145 under the 1979 Act, and subject to the amendments made by the present s. 35(6) 
inserted by the 1994 Act, this remains a case in which the buyer loses his right of rejection 
under ss. 34 and 35 of the Act, even though the buyer is willing and able to place the 
goods at the seller’s disposal at the original place of delivery. It seems that a right to 
rescind for misrepresentation would not be lost in this situation. The buyer would (it 
seems) only lose his right to rescind if he could not make restitutio in integrum. For 
example, if he cannot get the goods back from the sub-buyer, he plainly cannot rescind 
his own purchase of the goods. But where he is in fact in a position to restore the goods 
to the seller, it does not seem that previous dealings by the buyer will deprive him of the 
right to rescind.146
The further question which now arises is the effect of this divergence between the 
statutory and the equitable principles. In Leaf v International Galleries,147 Denning LJ 
expressed the view that a right to rescind for misrepresentation cannot survive beyond the 
point when a right to reject for breach of condition is lost because a misrepresentation 
is ‘much less potent’ than a breach of condition. But it seems that this reasoning cannot 
survive s. 1(a) of the Misrepresentation Act, which clearly permits rescission for a 
misrepresentation even where the misrepresentation has become a term of the contract. 
This being so, it would be very anomalous if the right to rescind is lost at an earlier date 
when the misrepresentation does not become a term of the contract.
The conclusion is that, whenever a buyer wishes to reject goods and the seller may 
wish to contend that the buyer has lost the right to reject, the buyer will be well advised 
to seek, in the alternative, rescission for misrepresentation. This will not, of course, be 
possible where the breach complained of was non-performance of a promise and not a 
misstatement of fact; nor will it always be advantageous to the buyer, particularly as the 
court may in its discretion refuse rescission under s. 2(2) of the Misrepresentation Act 
and award damages in lieu. The court has no discretion to deprive a buyer of the right 
to reject under the Sale of Goods Act and it is unlikely that the Misrepresentation Act 
affects the position in this respect.
It is unfortunate that the Law Commissions’ 1987 report, Sale and Supply of Goods, 
on remedies for breach of contracts of sale, and in particular on the buyer’s right of 
rejection, made no reference to the parallel problems of rescission for misrepresentation.

Rejection of the goods, rescission and specific performance	 465
It seems absurd that where a false representation of fact is made by a seller, the question 
whether the buyer can reject the goods or rescind the contract will continue to depend 
on two completely different sets of legal principles, even though they are designed to 
serve the identical purpose.
Specific performance or implement
The buyer, but not the seller,148 may invoke the discretion of the court and ask for a 
decree that the contract be specifically performed. This is regulated by s. 52 which says:
(1)	 In any action for breach of contract to deliver specific or ascertained goods the court may, 
if it thinks fit, on the plaintiff’s application, by its judgment or decree direct that the con-
tract shall be performed specifically, without giving the defendant the option of retaining 
the goods on payment of damages.
(2)	 The plaintiff’s application may be made at any time before judgment or decree.
(3)	 The judgment or decree may be unconditional, or on such terms and conditions as to  
damages, payment of the price, and otherwise, as seems just to the court.
Section 52(4) goes on to say that these provisions are to be deemed supplementary to, 
and not in derogation of, the right of specific implement in Scotland. The significance of 
this is that, as a number of cases have affirmed recently, the basis of specific implement 
is distinct from that of specific performance. In Scotland, implement is a right and, 
although this is subject to the equitable control of the court, the exercise of that control 
is coloured by the different starting point. Thus, the Scottish courts have specifically 
enforced ‘keep open’ clauses in leases149 and have not followed the judgment of the 
House of Lords in Co-operative Insurance Society Ltd v Argyll Stores (Holdings) Ltd.150 
In theory, therefore, there might be enforcement of a contract for unascertained goods, 
although the courts have generally held against this on the basis that the buyer cannot 
show any reason for preferring to obtain his goods by this route (pretium affectionis) 
rather than buying replacements on the market at the seller’s expense.151
Specific goods, as we have seen, are defined by s. 61 as being goods ‘identified and 
agreed upon at the time the contract is made’, and it has been said that ‘ascertained 
goods’ in this context probably means goods ‘identified in accordance with the 
agreement after the time a contract of sale is made’.152
Section 52 applies whether or not the property has passed to the buyer,153 although 
if the property has passed the buyer has the option of claiming in the alternative a 
decree of specific restitution in an action of conversion. But even here he cannot ask 
148	 Although the seller has not in name a right to a decree of specific performance, he does of course sometimes 
have a right to sue for the price, which is much the same thing. If the seller sues for, and obtains payment of, 
the price, the title to the goods and the right to possession will vest in the buyer by satisfaction, if they have 
not yet vested in him already.

	466	 The remedies of the buyer
for such a decree as of right. This was formerly so as a matter of common law154 and is 
now expressly provided for in s. 3 of the Torts (Interference with Goods) Act 1977. In 
other words, the remedy rests entirely within the discretion of the court and will not 
be granted in respect of chattels of no special importance, where damages would be an 
adequate remedy. But where a chattel is of peculiar importance and of practically unique 
value to the claimant, the court will grant the necessary decree.155
The English courts still seem most unwilling to use this jurisdiction, still less to 
extend it.156 In one case,157 for example, the Court of Appeal refused to order specific 
delivery of a machine manufactured by the defendants, although it was over 220 tons 
in weight, cost some £270,000 and could only be bought in the market with a 9–12 
months’ delivery date. It was formerly thought that a contract for the sale of a ship 
would be specifically enforceable almost as a matter of course, as a ship is a pretty 
unique chattel, but even this proposition was rejected in CN Marine Inc v Stena Line.158 
According to Parker J in this case, a buyer of a ship is not even prima facie entitled 
to a decree of specific performance, nor does mere inconvenience to the buyer or the 
possibility of remote loss justify such a decree. It must be shown that the ship was of 
peculiar importance to the plaintiff, in that the design was especially suited to his needs, 
or something of that kind.
Although the statutory provisions referred to above seem to make it immaterial 
whether the property has passed to the buyer or not, it seems that the courts are still more 
inclined to protect a property owner than someone with a bare contractual right. So 
where goods were sold and property had clearly passed, but the sellers – though claiming 
no contractual or proprietary rights over the goods – wanted to use them to satisfy other 
clients and pay damages to the buyer, the court granted an interim injunction to restrain 
the sellers from delivering the goods to the other clients.159 In this case, it was held that 
it was no defence for the sellers to show that damages would be an adequate remedy, an 
approach which seems very different from that adopted where the buyer actually seeks a 
decree of specific performance. Yet the result of this case must surely have been that the 
sellers actually delivered the goods to the buyer.
Where the property has not passed to the buyer, there can be no question of conversion 
and the only claim which can be made is on the contract. Until recently, it was generally 
thought that the court had no power to grant specific performance of a contract for the 
sale of goods as yet unidentified, and that a contract for the sale of an unidentified part 
of a specific whole was not a contract for the sale of specific or ascertained goods, of 
which specific performance could be ordered under s. 52.160

Rejection of the goods, rescission and specific performance	 467
But some doubt is thrown on these traditional ideas by Sky Petroleum Ltd v VIP 
Petroleum Ltd,161 where the plaintiffs obtained an interlocutory injunction to restrain 
the defendants from breaking a contract to supply the plaintiffs with all their petroleum 
requirements for ten years. Goulding J treated the injunction as in effect a decree of 
specific performance, but went on to hold that the general rule was inapplicable where 
damages would clearly not be an adequate remedy. In the case before him there was a real 
danger that the plaintiffs would be forced out of business if the defendants broke their 
contract in the very peculiar circumstances then holding. This decision may suggest that 
a buyer can sometimes obtain a decree of specific performance outside the circumstances 
contemplated by s. 52, by invoking the residuary equity jurisdiction of the court, but the 
point remains unsettled.162
A buyer who gives the seller reason to believe that he will only claim damages and not 
specific performance may be estopped from changing his mind if the seller has changed 
his position by acting to his detriment in reliance on this belief.163

162	 In In Re London Wine (Shippers) Co Ltd, above, n. 164, Oliver J was inclined to think that the contract in 
the Sky Petroleum case was not strictly a contract of sale of goods, but ‘a long-term supply contract under 
which successive sales would arise if orders were placed and accepted’ (see PCC 121, 149), but he went on 
to hold that even if Sky Petroleum was evidence of a jurisdiction to grant specific performance outside s. 
52, it was still not possible to grant a decree where the goods were not ascertained, and the buyer had no 
proprietary interest in the goods.

Action for damages
Damages for non-delivery1
The buyer’s action for damages for breach of contract may take one of two forms. It may 
be an action for damages for non-delivery2 or it may be an action for damages for breach 
of a term in respect of goods which have been delivered.3 A borderline case is where 
part of the goods which are part of a global whole has not been delivered. In Sealace 
Shipping Co Ltd v Oceanvoice,4 it was held that the appropriate measure in such a case 
was damages for non-delivery. First, we shall deal with damages for non-delivery.
Unlike the seller’s remedy, the nature of which depends upon whether the property 
has passed or not, the buyer’s action for damages for non-delivery is the same and the 
damages are assessed in the same way, whether or not the property has passed. In both 
cases, his essential complaint is the same, namely that the seller has failed to deliver 
goods which he ought to have delivered, and the buyer claims damages accordingly. 
The only difference is that where the property has passed the buyer may have a claim 
in conversion as well as, or as an alternative to, his action for damages for non-delivery, 
but, as will be seen, in practice the result is the same in either case.
The main rules for the assessment of damages are laid down by s. 51:
(1)	 Where the seller wrongfully neglects or refuses to deliver the goods to the buyer, the buyer 
may maintain an action against the seller for damages for non-delivery.
(2)	 The measure of damages is the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting, in the 
­ordinary course of events, from the seller’s breach of contract.
(3)	 Where there is an available market for the goods in question the measure of damages is 
prima facie to be ascertained by the difference between the contract price and the market 
or current price of the goods at the time or times when they ought to have been delivered 
or (if no time was fixed) then at the time of the refusal to deliver.
The market price rule
If, then, there is a market the prima facie rule is the same as in an action by the seller, that 
is to say, the damages are to be assessed by reference to the market price of the goods at 
the time when they ought to have been delivered, and by giving the buyer the difference 
between the market price and the contract price the court puts him in the position he

Action for damages	 469
would have been in had the goods been delivered.5 If the market price is lower than the 
contract price it follows, of course, that the buyer is only entitled to nominal damages 
because he can go into the market and buy replacement goods without extra cost.
The general rule is not displaced merely because the buyer has already contracted to 
resell the goods to a third party at a price higher or lower than the market price at the 
date when delivery should be made. This principle was laid down by the Court of Appeal 
in Rodocanachi v Milburn6 and was affirmed by the House of Lords in Williams v  
Agius.7 The resale price is treated as irrelevant because the buyer must, in order to fulfil 
his sub-sales, buy in the market if the seller fails to deliver. Damages for the non-delivery 
are intended to compensate for the additional cost of buying in the market.
In option contracts, it would appear that the appropriate measure is a sum which 
will compensate the buyer for the loss of the opportunity to buy, and in assessing this 
account must be taken of the fact that the buyer might not have exercised the option.8
Market price at what date
We have already seen in dealing with the action for non-acceptance that the concluding 
words of s. 51(3) have no relevance where there is an anticipatory breach of contract.9 
Should the seller repudiate the contract before the date for delivery arrives,10 the market 
price to be taken in the assessment of the damages is not that prevailing at the date 
of the repudiation but that at the time when delivery might have been expected to be 
made.11 In Tai Hing Cotton Mill Ltd v Kamsing Knitting Factory,12 the sellers failed to 
deliver 424 bales of yarn to buyers under a contract without a fixed delivery date. On  
31 July 1973, the sellers wrote repudiating the contract. The buyers did not accept this 
and continued to press for delivery, as they were entitled to do. But eventually they 
recognised that the sellers would not deliver, and on 28 November 1973, the buyers 
issued a writ claiming damages. It was held by the Privy Council that right up to that 
date the buyers could have demanded delivery on reasonable notice. They went on to 
hold that one month would have been sufficient notice, and accordingly, they could have 
demanded delivery up to 28 December, one month after they issued their writ. That, 
then, was the date when the goods ought to have been delivered within the meaning of 
the section and the date by reference to which the damages were to be assessed.
It will be observed that the buyer is not bound to accept the seller’s repudiation 
when it is first made. In accordance with the general principles of the law of contract,

	470	 tHE remedies of the buyer
as affirmed by the House of Lords in White & Carter (Councils) Ltd v McGregor,13 
the buyer can keep the seller’s obligations alive by refusing to accept the repudiation. 
However, if this principle is combined with that laid down by the Privy Council in the 
Tai Hing Cotton Mill case, it would seem that the buyer could prolong the seller’s duty 
to deliver more or less indefinitely in a contract without a fixed delivery date. If he 
simply tells the seller that he does not accept the repudiation and then waits five years 
before issuing his writ, are the damages to be assessed by reference to the market price at 
that date? This result presumably could be avoided by holding that the intention of the 
parties was that the goods would be delivered within a reasonable time after the contract 
was made, and then finding an appropriate date for that purpose.
Of course, the whole situation is changed if the buyer accepts the seller’s repudiation,14 
for he must then mitigate his damage, as a reasonable man.15 And if the market is rising, 
it seems that the buyer must then buy in the market without delay, although we have also 
seen that some scepticism has been expressed about the possibility of identifying rising 
and falling markets in advance.16 But in any event, according to the White & Carter 
case, the buyer is under no obligation to accept a wrongful repudiation, and the duty 
to mitigate does not arise until and unless he does so accept it, and brings the primary 
contractual duties of the seller to an end.
Where a contract expressly provides for a period of time during which delivery is 
to be made – as is very common in commercial sales – the seller is not in breach until  
the end of the last day of the permitted period. That is the time when the goods ought to  
have been delivered within the meaning of the subsection, and it is by reference to the  
market price at that time that the damages must be assessed.17 In a c.i.f. contract,  
the time when the goods ought to have been delivered within s. 51(3) is the time when the 
documents ought to have been delivered18 and, therefore, if a period of time is allowed, 
as is usual, it is the last day of the period which fixes the day by reference to which the 
damages must be assessed.
Although the market price rule is now firmly established in English and Scots law, it 
may be observed that there are cases in which it would lead to injustice if the rule were 
rigidly applied (e.g. by over-compensating the buyer19). In particular, it is unrealistic to

facie rule, and – as with clause 20 – the compensatory principle would be the overriding concern. Post-
breach events known at the time of arbitration or court hearing could therefore be taken into account, 
especially where these indicate that the buyer’s losses are lower.

suppose that a buyer will, in practice, be able to buy goods in the market on the very day 
on which the seller fails to deliver. The buyer will often wish to consider his position, or 
to negotiate with the seller on breach and some delay before he buys substitute goods 
is likely to be the rule rather than the exception. In this situation, although it has been 
stressed that assessment of damages as at the date of breach remains the prima facie 
rule,20 there are some circumstances in which the relevant market price will be that 
prevailing on the date when the buyer finally accepts (or perhaps ought reasonably to 
accept) that the seller is not going to deliver, so that the buyer will have to go into the 
market and buy substitute goods.21 Indeed, once this is established as the right approach 
there seems no real reason why the courts should not adopt the rule of the Uniform 
Commercial Code22 – at least as prima facie evidence of the buyer’s loss – that the price 
of the substitute goods should be taken as the basis for the assessment of the damages. 
Of course, care must be taken not to permit the buyer to prejudice the seller’s position 
by delaying for too long his decision to buy in the market, though there is once again 
some difficulty in reconciling this with the White & Carter decision which seems to 
rule out any duty to mitigate unless and until the repudiation is accepted. Certainly, the 
buyer will have difficulty in making out a case for higher damages where he has, after 
the seller’s failure to deliver, bought in the market at higher than market prices. There 
is, perhaps, more likelihood that the damages will be reduced if the buyer has bought at 
lower than market prices.23
Market price at what place
The relevant market for the purposes of the rule is generally that at the place of delivery 
because that will usually be the market on which the buyer will buy. Any principle 
requiring the buyer to go into another available market in order to mitigate his loss is 
of limited applicability because it is the value of the goods at the port of destination for 
which the buyer is being compensated.24
Cases where the market price rule is inapplicable
It is now necessary to examine those cases in which the damages are assessed by some 
other yardstick than that of market price. In the first place, even where there is a market 
for the goods in question25 the buyer may in some exceptional cases be able to claim 
damages representing the loss he has suffered on sub-sales which he has been unable to 
fulfil. For example, a buyer may contract to buy goods at £10 per tonne and may contract 
to resell the same goods at £12 per tonne. If the market price at the date of non-delivery 
to the first buyer is £11 per tonne, the question is whether the first buyer should recover

as damages £1 per tonne (the difference between market price and contract price) or 
£2 per tonne (the difference between market price and resale price). As we have seen, 
the normal rule is that sub-sales must be ignored in assessing the damages, but this rule 
only applies to damages arising directly and naturally from the breach under s. 51. The 
buyer may, in addition, be able to claim special damages, the right to which is reserved 
by s. 54, and which are based on loss not directly or naturally following from the breach, 
but on loss arising from special circumstances of which the parties were aware. These 
two different types of damages correspond to the first and second rules in Hadley v 
Baxendale,26 which were authoritatively restated by the House of Lords in Koufos v 
Czarnikow Ltd (The Heron II).27 According to this decision, the question in every case 
is whether on the information available to him at the time the contract was made, the 
seller should, or a reasonable man in his position would, have realised that such loss was 
sufficiently likely to result from the breach of contract to make it proper to hold that the 
loss flowed naturally from the breach, or that loss of that kind should have been within 
his contemplation.28
A simple example of special damage which may be alleged by the buyer is for freight 
which he has had to pay despite non-delivery of the goods,29 or sums paid for the 
cancellation of a charterparty.30
But it is one thing to recognise in principle that damages may be given in respect of 
a resale price. It is another thing to define the precise circumstances in which a buyer 
is entitled to claim damages in respect of sub-sales. The leading case is the decision of 
the House of Lords in Re R & H Hall Ltd and W H Pim (Junior) & Co’s Arbitration,31 
which ‘astonished the Temple and surprised St Mary Axe’.32 In this case, the sellers sold 
a specific cargo of corn in a specific ship to the buyers at fifty-one shillings and ninepence 
per quarter. The buyers resold at fifty-six shillings and ninepence per quarter, but when 
the vessel arrived the market price had fallen to fifty-three shillings and ninepence 
per quarter. The sellers failed to deliver and the question was whether the measure of 
damages was the difference between the contract price and the resale price, on the one 
hand, or the contract price and the market price, at the date when the goods should have 
been delivered, on the other. It was held that the former was the appropriate measure 
of damages but the precise ratio decidendi is not easy to state. It seems that there were 
two critical factors in the case which displaced the general principle: first, the sale was 
for a specific cargo on a specific ship, and it was this same specific cargo which had been 
resold and secondly, the contract of sale by its terms actually provided for resale by the 
buyer in the sense that various provisions of the contract dealt with this eventuality.
It has been suggested that the reason why the buyer can claim a higher measure of 
damages where these two conditions are satisfied is that the buyer cannot fulfil his

sub-sales by buying in the market. If the buyer has contracted to resell the specific goods 
which he has agreed to buy under the first contract, he will necessarily be unable to 
fulfil the second contract if the goods are not delivered. Substituted goods bought in the 
market will not do, and accordingly the market price is irrelevant.33 The only alternative 
is to assess the damages by reference to the resale price provided (and this is the second 
requirement) that it was known or foreseen that the goods were to be resold. It was 
suggested in the eighth and earlier editions that the difficulty with this solution was 
that, although the buyer would not be able to fulfil his sub-sales by buying in the market 
where he had contracted to resell the specific goods bought, the damages payable to his 
sub-buyer would be nil if equally good substitutes were in fact available in the market 
at equal prices. This of course is the case, but nevertheless the buyer’s expectation loss 
is surely the difference between the contract price and the resale price. The right of 
the buyer to recover the higher measure of damages on a sub-sale is surely simply an 
application of the second limb in Hadley v Baxendale, and it is clear that the seller must 
have been aware, or ought to have been aware, of the buyer’s intention to resell.34
It seems clear that both requirements must be satisfied because the mere fact that 
sub-sales may be contemplated as a reasonable probability is not enough to displace the 
general principle. For as Maugham LJ said in The Arpad:35
I suppose most vendors of goods and most carriers might be taken to know that if the purchaser 
or consignee is a trader the goods will probably be sold, or be bought for sub-sale; but the 
authorities seem to show conclusively that something more than that is necessary to enable the 
damages to be assessed by reference to a contract of sub-sale entered into before the date of 
delivery.36
But it has been said that the position may differ where ‘the seller knows that the buyer 
is buying the goods in order to fulfil an already existing special contract, and knows 
that if he fails to deliver the goods the buyer will come under a specific liability to his 
sub-buyer’.37
Where the two conditions are satisfied but the buyer has contracted to resell the goods 
at less than the market price the question arises whether the seller is to be given the benefit 
of this. All the cases which have arisen so far in which sub-sales have been taken into 
account have been cases in which the buyer increased his damages by proving that this 
loss was more than the difference between the contract and the market price. A possible 
reason for this is apparent from the facts of Williams v Agius. In that case, Agius sold a  
quantity of goods to Williams at sixteen shillings and threepence per unit. Williams sold 
to a third party X at nineteen shillings. X sold to Agius at twenty shillings. Agius failed 
to deliver to Williams, no doubt because the market price had now risen to twenty-three 
shillings and sixpence. The question to be decided by the court was whether Williams 
should recover the contract/market difference at the time of non-delivery (seven shillings 
and threepence), or be limited by the amount of the sub-sale to X to two shillings and

ninepence. It was held that Williams should recover the full contract/market difference. 
After all, in order to fulfil his contract with X, he would have had to pay twenty-three 
and sixpence on the market. If he did not fulfil his contract with X, or was unable to 
because this was a specific cargo on a specific vessel as in Hall & Pim’s Arbitration, he 
would have had to pay X the difference between X’s contract price of nineteen shillings 
and the market price, that is, four shillings and sixpence, to which there would have to be 
added his own gain of two shillings and ninepence. Either way the damages suffered by 
Williams work out at seven shillings and threepence.
If the buyer can bring himself within the principle of Hall & Pim’s Arbitration, he 
may be entitled to recover not only his loss of profit on sub-sales (for that is what it 
comes to) but also any damages which he may have had to pay his sub-buyer in respect 
of his loss of profit and, indeed, that of other sub-buyers in the string. Moreover, if the 
buyer has been sued by his sub-buyer and has had to pay damages and costs, he is entitled 
to claim from the seller the total sum he has had to pay as well as a sum in respect of 
his own costs.38 The only qualification on this rule is that the buyer must have acted 
reasonably in defending the action. In string contracts, it may well be easier for the buyer 
to claim loss of profit than in other sales because, in such a case, if the seller knows that 
the buyer ‘is not buying merely for resale generally but upon a string contract where he 
will resell those specific goods and where he can only honour his contract by delivering 
those goods and no others, the measure of profit on resale is the right measure’.39
Where there is no market for the goods in question, the buyer’s damages clearly 
cannot be assessed in the usual way in terms of the market price. In such a case, the 
method to be adopted for assessing the damages depends partly on whether the buyer is 
a trader buying for resale or whether he is buying for use, and partly on what measures 
the buyer actually adopts to meet the seller’s failure to deliver. Where he is a trader, the 
buyer is entitled to recover the difference between the value of the goods at the time 
they should have been delivered and the contract price. The value of the goods is prima 
facie to be assessed at the price at which the buyer may have contracted to resell them. 
Putting it briefly, the buyer is able to recover his loss of profit.40 And, again, if the buyer 
can prove special knowledge on the part of the seller, he may also be able to recover in 
respect of damages which he has to pay to his sub-buyer.41 Alternatively, the buyer may 
choose to buy substitutes with which to fulfil his contracts, and, should these cost more 
than the contract goods, he can prima facie recover this excess cost and is not bound 
to account for the better quality of the goods so bought.42 In the case of goods bought 
for use, the buyer may be able to recover damages to meet the additional cost of buying 
reasonable alternative goods or of adapting or modifying alternative goods for his

purposes. So in Air Studios (Lyndhurst) Ltd (t/a Air Entertainment Group) v Lombard 
North Central Plc,43 involving second-hand equipment used in television and radio post-
production, the Court concluded that there was no available market for second-hand 
goods because although comparable second-hand goods were available, it would have 
taken around three months to source those. Consequently, the basic rule in s. 51(2) was 
applied instead, and the yardstick for the quantum of damages would be the cost of 
procuring equivalent second-hand equipment.
It should be observed that a sub-sale price cannot be taken as conclusive evidence of 
the value of the goods. In particular, where it is proved that the contract of sub-sale was 
entered into long before the date at which delivery should have been made and that the 
price of similar goods has fallen heavily in the meantime, some other mode of assessing 
the value of the goods must be chosen.44 So also, where the sub-sale was made on very 
unusual terms, the buyer cannot claim loss of profit based on the sub-sale price, though 
it may be possible to adjust the price notionally by eliminating the unusual features, and 
asking what the sub-sale price would then have been.45
Another situation where the market price rule may be inapplicable arises where, even 
if the seller had delivered the goods, the buyer would not in fact have been able to dispose 
of the goods in the market. So where goods were sold c.i.f. Beirut, and the sellers failed 
to deliver, it was held that the damages must be assessed by reference to the value of the 
goods in the vessel, and not the landed value because the port was closed and the buyer 
would not have been able to land the goods even if they had been delivered.46 A similar 
situation might occur where a buyer orders goods for resale in a particular market 
into which they cannot be imported due to the existence of a third party’s intellectual 
property rights. Assuming that the seller did not warrant the saleability of the goods in 
the particular market,47 it would appear that the value of the goods would have to be 
assessed by some other criteria such as the price at which the buyer could have disposed 
of the goods in another market (assuming the buyer used reasonable endeavours to get 
the best price possible).
Damages for breach of condition or warranty
In English law, the seller may deliver the goods to the buyer, but may still be guilty of a 
breach of a contractual term entitling the buyer to damages, that is to say, a breach of

46	 R Pagnan & Filli v Lorico (1981) Com LR 152. But there are puzzling features to this decision. Usually the 
market price is taken as the yardstick because if the seller fails to deliver, the buyer will have to buy in the 
market in lieu. Here it seems to have been assumed that the reason why the market price is the yardstick is 
because, on delivery, the buyer can resell in the market. Perhaps this case would have been better decided on 
the ground that in a c.i.f. contract the seller fulfils his duty by delivering documents; inability to unload is 
the buyer’s problem, not the seller’s – so long at least as the seller has made a proper contract of carriage 
and supplied proper documents. See also Sealace Shipping Co Ltd v Oceanvoice [1991] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 120 
referred to in n. 4 above. In that case the seller failed to deliver a spare propeller with a vessel. There was 
no available market in spare propellers, and accordingly the measure of damages fell to be assessed under s. 
51(2). In the event, the arbitrator held that the damages suffered by the buyer assessed under that subsection 
were to be fixed by reference to the scrap value of the spare propeller.

warranty, or a breach of condition or of an innominate term which the buyer chooses, or 
is compelled, to treat as a breach of warranty. In this event, s. 53 applies:48
(1)	 Where there is a breach of warranty by the seller, or where the buyer elects (or is compelled) 
to treat any breach of a condition on the part of the seller as a breach of warranty, the 
buyer is not by reason only of such breach of warranty entitled to reject the goods; but he 
may—
(a)	 set up against the seller the breach of warranty in diminution or extinction of the 
price; or
(b)	 maintain an action against the seller for damages for the breach of warranty.
(2)	 The measure of damages for breach of warranty is the estimated loss directly and natu-
rally resulting, in the ordinary course of events, from the breach of warranty.
Since Scots law does not know the technical distinctions between conditions, warranties 
and innominate terms, it has its own provision on damages, s. 53A(1):
The measure of damages for the seller’s breach of contract is the estimated loss directly and 
naturally resulting, in the ordinary course of events, from the breach.
Late delivery
Late delivery may, of course, justify the buyer in refusing to take the goods at all. 
Whether it has this effect depends upon whether time is of the essence so that late 
delivery is treated as a breach of condition; in cases where time is not of the essence,  
late delivery may still be so inordinate that eventually the buyer is justified in refusing to take  
delivery, though he may sometimes have to give notice before he does so.49 If the buyer 
does refuse to take the goods, his claim for damages will be a claim for non-delivery 
rather than, strictly, a claim for late delivery, and the applicable rules will be those 
relating to non-delivery, considered above. The only additional point to note here is that 
the mitigation rule may operate in a somewhat strange way in the case of late delivery, 
in effect undercutting the buyer’s claim for non-delivery altogether. In The Solholt,50 for 
instance, sellers had contracted to sell a ship for $5m, delivery not later than 31 August; 
in fact, they only tendered the ship on 3 September and the buyers refused to accept it, 
as they were entitled to do. The market price had actually risen by this time to $5.5m so 
that prima facie it would seem the buyers might have expected to recover half a million 
dollars in damages. In fact, they recovered nothing because their refusal to accept the 
ship amounted to a termination of the original contract, as a result of which their duty 
to mitigate came into operation. Reasonable mitigation demanded that they should have 
sought some arrangement after the breach, it being found as a fact that they could have 
negotiated a settlement with the sellers after the breach under which the ship would 
still have been delivered, albeit a few days late. This was, of course, a case dealing with 
a rather special type of goods – a ship; in other cases, late delivery will usually result 
48	 The section does not mention innominate terms, which were, of course, not invented when the Act was first 
passed. But it can be assumed that the measure of damages for breach of such a term is exactly the same as 
the measure of damages for breach of warranty.

in the buyer going into the market to buy replacements, and once this has been done it 
will obviously be too late for the seller to tender delivery and claim that the buyer can 
best mitigate the damage by taking the goods late. But the case does suggest that a late 
delivery is worth tendering because if the buyer has not yet made other arrangements his 
failure to accept even a late delivery may well cut his damages significantly, even perhaps 
to nil.
If, however, the goods are delivered late and are accepted, the method of assessing 
the damages may depend on whether the buyer is a trader buying for resale or whether 
he is buying for use. If he is buying for use, the appropriate damages may be calculated 
by considering how much it would have cost the buyer to hire substitute goods during 
the delay, or what additional costs may have been incurred by the buyer as a result of 
having to make do without the goods during the delay. Much will depend here on what 
the buyer has actually done to mitigate his loss arising out of the delay and whether his 
conduct has been reasonable.
Where, on the other hand, the buyer is a trader buying for resale, it seems that the 
normal rule is that the buyer is entitled to recover as damages the difference between  
the market price at the time the goods should have been delivered and the market price at 
the time they were in fact delivered. Oddly enough, there appears to be no clear authority 
to this effect in the law of sale, but this was the measure of damages awarded by the 
House of Lords for delayed delivery in a contract of carriage in Koufos v Czarnikow,51 
and it seems to be generally accepted that the same measure applies in a sale.52
Under this measure of damages, it will be observed that the contract price is irrelevant. 
The rule is based on the assumption that the buyer resells the goods as soon as they are 
delivered to him; on this assumption, the loss to the buyer which is caused by the delay 
is the fall in the market between the contract delivery date and the actual delivery date.
A difficult and controversial case is Wertheim v Chicoutimi Pulp Co Ltd,53 where A 
contracted to sell goods to B at twenty-five shillings a ton. With the costs and expenses 
of transport, the total cost to the buyer was thirty-eight shillings a ton. A was late in 
delivering the goods. The market price at the date when the goods ought to have been 
delivered was seventy shillings a ton, but the market price at the date when the goods were 
in fact delivered was forty-two shillings and sixpence a ton. The buyer, however, resold 
the goods at sixty-five shillings a ton. It was held by the Privy Council that the buyer was 
only entitled to the difference between seventy shillings and sixty-five shillings a ton, 
that is, five shillings, not the difference between seventy shillings and forty-two shillings 
and sixpence, that is, twenty-seven shillings and sixpence a ton. Although this case was 
accepted as good law in Williams v Agius54 by Lord Dunedin and by Lord Atkinson,55 
it has given rise to a certain amount of criticism56 on the ground that it conflicts with 
the general principle that subcontracts are to be ignored unless they were especially

contemplated. What seems to have weighed with the Privy Council was that, had the 
goods been delivered as promised, the plaintiff would have made a gain of thirty-two 
shillings had he resold at seventy shillings. He had in fact resold at sixty-five shillings, 
and so got back twenty-seven shillings of the potential gain of thirty-two shillings. Thus, 
giving him five shillings gives him his expectation of gain. If he were allowed to recover 
twenty-seven shillings and sixpence a ton he would have gained fifty-nine shillings and 
sixpence (twenty-seven shillings and sixpence plus thirty-two shillings), which is more 
than he would have got had the goods been delivered timeously, and would be contrary 
to the principle that damages should be compensatory only. The Privy Council had 
evidence to support the above analysis, but in many cases the court will not have any 
such evidence. Thus, in other cases the fact that the buyer did not suffer the full loss 
which might have resulted from the seller’s breach would, in a sense, be due to his own 
business success in selling goods for sixty-five shillings a ton when the market price was 
only forty-two shillings and sixpence. The buyer might, if the goods had been delivered 
on time, have resold those goods at their market price of seventy shillings per ton and 
bought other goods to fulfil his contract. In this way, he would have made a large profit 
of which he would have been deprived by the breach of contract.
A number of difficult cases have raised questions as to the buyer’s damages where 
shipping documents have been antedated to conceal a late shipment, and market prices 
have fallen by the time the goods are delivered. In this situation, the buyer can still find 
himself compelled to accept the goods before he is fully aware of the breach which has 
occurred. As we have already seen, this remains possible even though it is now less likely 
to occur since the amendment of ss. 34 and 35 of the Sale of Goods Act.57 In this event, 
the buyer may feel that it is unreasonable to confine him to the measure of damages 
prescribed by s. 53(3) because he will have lost the opportunity of rejecting the goods 
and buying replacements in the market at the now lower market price. He may therefore 
claim damages based on the fall in the market price of the goods; that is, he may claim 
damages representing the difference between the contract price and the market price 
of the goods at the date when they were delivered. This is different from the normal 
measure of damages for late delivery because that measure would only give the buyer 
the difference between the market price at the date when the goods should have been 
delivered, and the market price at the date when they were delivered.
Although it is by no means obvious why any sympathy should be shown to a buyer 
who has thus lost the opportunity for escaping from a bad bargain, the courts have in 
fact come to the assistance of the buyer in two cases of this nature. Both cases concerned 
late shipment under c.i.f. contracts in which the bills of lading were wrongly antedated 
to make it appear that the goods had been shipped during the contract period. In the 
first case,58 it was held that the buyers, who had lost their right to reject before being 
aware of the late shipment, could recover damages representing the difference between 
the contract and the market price at the date of delivery. This decision was, it seems, 
partly based on the argument that the buyers were claiming damages, not merely for 
the late shipment of the goods, but for the separate breach involved in tendering false

bills of lading. It was because of this falsity that the buyers did not discover until too 
late that the goods had been shipped late and, in a sense, it was therefore true to say 
that it was the falsity of the bills of lading which caused the buyers’ loss; had the bills 
of lading been accurate, the buyers would probably have rejected the documents (owing 
to the fall in the market price) on the ground of late shipment and thus escaped their 
bad bargain.
In the second case,59 the buyers were again deceived by false bills of lading, but in this 
case they knew of the late shipment by the time the goods themselves arrived. Although 
it was too late for them to reject the documents they could (it was held) have still rejected 
the goods when they arrived, and the case had to be decided on the supposition that they 
had accepted the goods with knowledge of facts from which the right to reject arose. 
Even in this situation, it was held by Devlin J that the buyers could recover the difference 
between the contract price and the market price at the date of delivery and thus throw 
onto the sellers the loss caused by the drop in the market. This case seems to push this 
principle as far as it can be taken, and it was based on Devlin J’s view that a buyer 
who has accepted documents under a c.i.f. contract may have practical difficulties about 
rejecting the goods, and that his choice to accept them is therefore not a wholly free and 
unconstrained one. Subsequently, some doubts were expressed in the Court of Appeal 
about the validity of the argument that there are two rights of rejection, one for the 
documents and one for the goods, in a c.i.f. contract.60 Certainly, it would seem wrong 
to allow a buyer quite freely and voluntarily to accept goods which he is entitled to reject 
and then try to place himself in the same financial position that he would have been in if 
he had rejected. A buyer who wants to do this should reject the goods first and then try 
to negotiate a new price with the seller based on the fall in the market. However, the two 
decisions referred to above may be justified because of the seriousness of the practice of 
antedating bills of lading to conceal a late shipment and the desirability of ensuring that 
the seller should not be able to retain any advantage as a result.
The above cases were distinguished by the Court of Appeal in Procter & Gamble 
Philippine Manufacturing Corp v Kurt A Becher GmbH61 where the sellers tendered 
bills of lading falsely dated 31 January, though the goods were shipped in February, 
which was in fact still during the contractual shipment period. The buyers accepted the 
documents, not then being aware of the false date, and they also accepted the goods 
when they arrived, by which time the market price had fallen. They then tried to recover 
damages in respect of this fall in the market for breach of the contractual duty to tender 
correctly dated documents, but their claim was rejected. Although the buyers could have 
rejected the documents if they had known that they were falsely dated (and then they 
could of course have renegotiated the price to take account of the fall in the market), 
their acceptance of the goods was not the result of the mis-dating of the documents. 
If the documents had been correctly dated, the buyers could not have rejected either 
the documents or the goods, so that the mis-dating of the bill of lading caused the 
buyers no loss. The earlier cases were different because in both of them the mis-dating

of the documents was the cause of the buyers accepting the goods and thus losing their 
opportunity to reject them and take advantage of the fall in the market. In the result, 
therefore, the mis-dating of the documents here caused the buyers no loss.
Breach of warranty of quality
Different considerations arise again where goods defective in quality are delivered.  
To such a case, s. 53(3) applies in English law:
In the case of breach of warranty[62] of quality such loss is prima facie the difference between 
the value of the goods at the time of delivery to the buyer and the value they would have had if 
they had fulfilled the warranty.
In Scots law, s. 53A(2) applies:
Where the seller’s breach consists of the delivery of goods which are not of the quality required 
by the contract and the buyer retains the goods, such loss as aforesaid [under s. 53A(1) – see p. 539 
above] is prima facie the difference between the value of the goods at the time of delivery to the 
buyer and the value they would have had if they had fulfilled the contract.63
The prima facie rule is thus that the buyer is entitled to the difference between the value 
of the goods actually delivered and the value which the goods would have had if they 
had conformed to the contract.64 Of course, this means that if the goods are so seriously 
defective as to have no value at all, the buyer is entitled to recover the full value which the 
goods should have had.65 The market price of the goods is, in principle, irrelevant to an 
action for damages of this kind, although in some cases (especially in consumer sales) 
the market price of the goods as warranted may be some evidence of the value of the 
goods as warranted. So in a simple consumer sale where, say, a defective car is delivered, 
the buyer is prima facie entitled as damages to the difference between the value which 
the car ought to have had – which is likely to be taken to be (at any rate if the car is new) 
the contract price – and the value which the car in fact had. To assess this latter value, 
it must be asked what would the market value of the defective car have been if buyers 
and sellers had known of the defects.66 In fact, claims by consumers in cases of this kind 
62	 It is curious that this section refers to a breach of warranty of quality, when all the terms as to quality implied 
by ss. 13–15 are conditions. This suggests that the draftsman may have thought that a condition becomes a 
warranty if the buyer claims damages in respect of it, but it has been held that this is not so: Wallis Son &  
Wells v Pratt & Haynes [1911] AC 394. Presumably, as already suggested, breach of an innominate term 
would be treated in the same way as a breach of warranty for this purpose.
63	 Note that this provides in effect for an actio quanti minoris, rejected at Scots common law before 1893 
(McCormick v Rittmeyer (1869) 7 M 854), but now allowed generally in contract law by virtue of the

the market value of the car was the same as the contract price merely because the defects were latent, and 
most buyers would have been willing to pay the contract price which this buyer paid. In this context, the 
market value means the value assuming the market knows of the defects.

are often complicated by additional claims for consequential losses, which are readily 
allowable.67
The normal rule here, as elsewhere, is that sub-sales by the buyer are irrelevant to the 
buyer’s claim for damages. In Slater v Hoyle & Smith,68 the buyers contracted for the 
purchase of 3,000 pieces of unbleached cloth of specified quality. Some 1,625 pieces of 
lower quality than specified were delivered, but the buyer delivered 691 of them under 
a subcontract he had made for the higher grade material, and obtained payment from 
his sub-buyer at the full rate. The Court of Appeal held that these facts must be ignored 
in assessing the damages, and that the buyer was entitled to the difference between the 
value of the contract goods and the value of the goods actually delivered. A different 
decision was reached in Bence Graphics International Ltd v Fasson UK Ltd.69 The seller 
had supplied the buyer with vinyl film which were then made into decals for containers. 
These should have lasted for at least five years, but the film supplied was substandard 
and lasted only for a considerably shorter period. The buyer brought an action against 
the seller for breach of warranty and claimed the difference in value. The Court of 
Appeal considered whether damages should be based on the difference in value between 
defective and non-defective vinyl, or measured by reference to the buyer’s liability to the 
sub-buyers of the decals. The Court of Appeal decided on the latter, as there had only 
been one complaint about the defective quality, and applied s. 53(2) instead. It has been 
observed that Slater v Hoyle & Smith and Bence Graphics v Fasson are ‘not easy to 
reconcile’.70
A slightly different approach was taken in Saipol SA v Inerco Trade SA,71 involving 
a contract of sale for 3,000 mt of Ukrainian Sunflower Oil. The seller had a total cargo 
of 16,000 mt on-board a ship co-mingled with oil belonging to others. The cargo 
was discharged at Dunkirk and the buyer delivered the oil to sub-buyers, but they 
subsequently complained that the sunflower oil had been contaminated with mineral 
oil (a widespread problem which triggered an EU-wide recall and import ban). The 
buyer brought an arbitration claim to recover the difference in value, for its liability 
to sub-purchasers, and the expenses incurred in disposing of contaminated product. 
The arbitration panel awarded only the difference in value on the basis of s. 53(3). But 
the High Court allowed the buyer’s appeal because the arbitration panel had applied  
s. 53(3) rather than to start with s. 53(2). On the facts, a claim for consequential losses 
was permissible and should have been considered by the panel.72

72	 In Dreyfus Trading v Reliance Trading [2004] 2 Lloyd’s Rep. 243, where a damages claim for breach of the 
implied warranty under s. 12(2) was dealt with by reference to s. 53, the High Court held that the prima 
facie measure of damages was the difference in value but that presumption could be rebutted in favour 
of applying the general measure under s. 53(2) and a sub-sale taken into account where this was in the 
reasonable contemplation of the parties – the goods had been bought for the specific purpose of reselling to 
a specific sub-buyer.

	482	 tHE remedies of the buyer
Although it is stated that the relevant date for valuing the goods actually delivered is 
the time of delivery to the buyer, this does not always work well in practice. It may, for 
instance, be some time after delivery that the breach of warranty is first discovered. Or 
the goods may be consigned and delivered to sub-buyers before the defect is discovered. 
In this last situation, the courts have held that the goods should be valued at the time and 
place of delivery to the sub-buyer provided that the seller knew or could have foreseen 
that the goods might be redelivered without examination.73
It will be seen that the prima facie rule laid down by the two sections treats the market 
price as irrelevant except insofar as the market price may be taken to be the value which 
the goods should have had. It is the defects in the goods for which the buyer is to be 
compensated, and the damages are thus based on the deficiency in their value arising 
from the defects. If, however, the market price of the goods has fallen significantly since 
the contract was made, the buyer is likely to reject defective goods, as he is often entitled 
to do. In this event, the buyer is able to take advantage of the seller’s breach to throw 
onto him the loss flowing from the fall in the market; there is in law no general principle 
of good faith which prevents the buyer from rejecting for any reason he chooses, so 
long only as there is a right to reject.74 Likewise, in Scots law the only control is the 
requirement that the breach be material. But where the buyer, with full knowledge of the  
defective nature of the goods, chooses to keep them and merely to claim damages for 
the breach, the normal rule must be applied and the buyer will be able to recover only 
the difference between the value of the goods and their value as warranted.75 The buyer 
cannot accept the goods with full knowledge of the seller’s breach, and then claim the 
damages for the loss he might have avoided by rejecting the goods.76 But by analogy with 
the cases discussed above concerning wrongly dated shipping documents, it may be that 
the buyer would be permitted to obtain damages covering the fall in the market price  
of the goods if he does not know of the defects when he accepts the goods, particularly 
if he has in some way been deceived by misrepresentations by the seller, or by the 
concealment of defects in the goods. This may happen, for instance, where a clean bill of 
lading is wrongly issued for goods whose apparent condition is manifestly unsatisfactory.
Goods bought for use
Sections 53(3) and 53A do not differentiate between goods bought for use and goods 
bought for resale, and the same measure of damages is thus prima facie applicable in 
the two cases. The buyer can thus recover the difference between the actual value of the 
goods and their value as warranted, even where he buys for use. In practice, however, the 
damages in this case are likely to take a different form, or at least to be calculated in a 
different manner. One possibility is that the buyer will simply have the goods modified 
or repaired so as to bring them up to the requisite standard. Clearly, in this event the cost

of such work is likely to be treated as equal to the difference in value between the goods 
delivered and their value as warranted.77 But what happens if there is no difference in 
value, but a considerable one in having the goods modified or repaired? 78 In the case of 
Ruxley Electronics and Construction Co v Forsyth,79 the plaintiffs had built a swimming 
pool in the defendant’s garden which was shallower than the depth specified. The trial 
judge found that the shortfall had not decreased the value of the pool and awarded 
£2,500 general damages for loss of amenity.80 The Court of Appeal pointed out that 
there were two methods of assessing the buyer’s loss, namely to assess the difference 
in value, or, alternatively, to assess the costs of modification or repair. The difference 
in value method was appropriate when the chattel which was damaged81 or was not up 
to specification was of a kind commonly available. But this method was inadequate 
where the buyer’s chattel had some unique quality and could not be replaced. Although 
it would be unreasonable for a buyer to claim an expensive remedy when a cheaper one 
would make good his loss, on the facts, it was not unreasonable to award as damages 
the costs of replacing the swimming pool. The House of Lords, however, unanimously 
restored the trial judge’s decision.82 The House of Lords took the view that to award the 
cost of reinstatement was wholly unreasonable.
Peculiarly difficult problems attend the calculation of damages for breach of warranty 
of quality in respect of profit-earning chattels. This is partly because of the need to avoid 
duplicating the damages by including the same item as a capital loss and an income 
loss, and partly because there is a large number of ways in which loss of profits may be 
calculated. Difficulties of this nature led to a divided Court of Appeal in Cullinane v 
British ‘Rema’ Manufacturing Co Ltd,83 but it is doubtful if any general principle can be 
extracted from this troublesome case.84 The case was considered in A C Daniels & Co 
Ltd v Jungwoo Logic,85 which involved a contract for the supply of injection moulding 
machinery for making plastic bins. It was held that since the buyer had properly rejected 
the goods, the claim was one for non-delivery under s. 51, and the buyer was entitled to 
damages which would place it as far as possible in the position it would have been in 
had the contract been performed. Cullinane, properly understood, was not authority 
for the proposition that damages for breach of contract could be recovered on the basis 
of restoration of the claimant to the position it would have been in if there had been

no contract. The claimant was allowed the return of the price paid to the seller, plus 
the claimant’s wasted expenditure. The court did not allow an alternative claim of loss 
of profit because, on the evidence, it could not quantify this in a satisfactory way. In 
Beoco Ltd v Alfa Laval,86 a heat exchanger supplied by the first defendant was found to 
be cracked. It was negligently repaired by the second defendant, as a result of which an 
explosion occurred causing damage to equipment and loss of production. The plaintiffs 
were found to be negligent in failing to check the repair before switching the machine 
back on. It was held, applying the same principles as in tort, that the plaintiffs’ damages 
should be limited to the repair costs and losses incurred due to loss of production on the 
day the repair was effected.
Where the damage caused by the breach requires the buyer to replace plant or 
machinery, he will not necessarily be compelled to give credit for the fact that he is 
replacing worn or partly used plant or machinery with new plant or machinery. But he 
probably would if the old plant or machinery were so worn that it had little life and 
would have had to be replaced soon anyhow.87
Where the buyer buys goods for the use of members of his family, it seems that he can 
recover damages in respect of (at least some of) their losses, as well as his own.88 But it 
does not seem likely that the buyer could recover in respect of personal injuries suffered 
by members of his family through defective goods bought by him.
Consequential loss
Claims for damages for consequential loss are more commonly associated with breaches 
of warranty of quality and the like than with claims for non-delivery. Obviously, the main 
reason for this is that defective goods can cause damage or injury in use, and this type 
of claim for consequential loss is therefore more frequently made when the goods have 
been bought for use. Where personal injury or physical damage to property is caused 
by defective goods in this way, the damages are assessed in much the same way as in the 
tort/delict of negligence. In such circumstances, the damages may run into thousands of 
pounds, although the inherent value of the goods may be only a few shillings, as where a 
child was blinded by use of a defective catapult,89 or where a man contracted dermatitis 
from wearing underpants containing an excess of harmful chemicals.90
The general principle remains, of course, that the loss must have been in the 
contemplation of the parties at the time the contract was made, in accordance with 
the decision in Hadley v Baxendale.91 In recent times, claims for consequential losses 
in contracts of sale of goods have multiplied, both in commercial and consumer sales. 
Generally speaking, the courts appear to treat such claims very favourably from the 
buyer’s point of view, but it is clear from Transfield Shipping Inc v Mercator Shipping

for which compensation is sought is of a ‘kind’ or ‘type’ for which the contract-breaker 
ought fairly to be taken to have accepted responsibility.
In Parsons (Livestock) Ltd v Uttley, Ingham & Co Ltd,93 the defendants sold a large 
feeding hopper to the plaintiffs, who were pig farmers. In installing the hopper, the 
defendants failed to open a ventilator at the top (which was not visible from the ground) 
with somewhat disastrous consequences. The nuts stored in the hopper became mouldy 
and some of the pigs became ill; later, this triggered off an attack of a much more 
serious pig disease and many of the pigs died. The value of these pigs amounted to some 
£10,000, and, in addition, the plaintiffs claimed for substantial losses of profits. It was 
held that the former losses were recoverable, but not the latter. Although the gravity of the 
consequences could not have been foreseen in this case, it was held that the parties could 
reasonably have contemplated that some of the contents of the hopper would become 
mouldy from the ventilator being closed and that this might have caused some illness 
of the pigs. In effect, the court here applied the tort/delict decision in Hughes v Lord 
Advocate94 that the general kind of damage must be foreseeable, but it is not necessary 
to show that the precise extent could have been foreseen. On the facts, the decision is 
somewhat remarkable and must stand as a warning against taking the foreseeability test 
too seriously. It seems absurd to suppose that any person would have foreseen anything 
remotely resembling what happened here as a result of leaving the ventilator closed. The 
House of Lords passed up an opportunity to consider Parsons in the Scottish case of 
Balfour Beatty v Scottish Power plc.95 Balfour Beatty were building an aqueduct, using 
a ‘continuous pour’ of concrete for the purpose. A power failure constituting breach of 
contract by Scottish Power interrupted the pour and led ultimately to the demolition 
of the work done and its later reconstruction at considerable expense. The Court of 
Session held the loss recoverable, on the basis that it was of a foreseeable kind, even if 
the amount was greater than might have been foreseen. The House of Lords held that the 
loss was too remote under the first leg of Hadley, saying that while business people were 
to be taken as having knowledge of the ordinary course of each other’s business, that 
did not extend to specialist technical aspects such as concrete pours. On the other hand, 
the test is sometimes used to limit recovery of losses which an ordinary person might 
think are foreseeable, such as losses consequent on a damaged reputation. In Amstrad 
plc v Seagate Technology Inc,96 the defendants supplied defective hard disk drives for the 
plaintiff’s new range of computers. It was held that the plaintiff was entitled to damages 
for lost and delayed sales and costs under s. 53(2), but not for lost sales on the plaintiff’s 
successor range as this was not within the contemplation of the parties at the time of the 
contract.

were awarded for loss of profits on repeated orders. The crucial difference is probably that in that case the 
supplier knew that the goods were for resale to third parties, whereas the launch of a new product range, 
although within the buyer’s contemplation, is unlikely to be within the seller’s.

	486	 tHE remedies of the buyer
On the other hand, in a later case (which was not a sale of goods case) where the 
plaintiff claimed damages falling within the second limb in Hadley v Baxendale, the 
Court of Appeal took a markedly more realistic, if less sympathetic stance.97 Here, 
the plaintiff had booked a holiday through the defendants, and it had been mentioned 
that he needed medical insurance because he was liable to attacks of asthma.  
A breach of contract by the defendants triggered off a serious attack of asthma but the 
defendants were held not liable for the additional consequences of this, on the ground 
that the information about the plaintiff’s medical condition had been volunteered 
conversationally, and was not part of the contractual terms. So far as contracts of sale of 
goods are concerned, damages under the second limb of Hadley v Baxendale are usually 
regarded simply as ‘special damages’ which are recognised by s. 54, though that section 
merely preserves the common law rule.
A failure by the buyer himself to take normal or reasonable precautions may be a 
novus actus interveniens which prevents the seller being responsible for the ultimate 
consequences of his breach. For instance, in Lambert v Lewis98 a farmer bought a towing 
coupling from a retail seller. The coupling was defective so that the seller was guilty of 
a breach of the implied terms under the Sale of Goods Act. But the farmer continued 
to use the coupling even though he was or should have been aware that it was defective. 
When the coupling gave way, causing an accident in which the plaintiff was injured, it 
was held that the farmer could not claim an indemnity from the seller in respect of his 
own liability to the plaintiff. If, however, the seller warrants the quality or fitness of the 
goods in such terms as to indicate that there is no need for the buyer to examine or check 
upon the continued safety of the goods, and the buyer is (despite this warranty) held 
liable to a third party for injury caused by the goods so warranted, then the buyer could 
expect to recover a complete indemnity from the seller.99
Again, where a seller delivered some yarn to the buyer at the docks in damaged 
cartons, it was held that the seller was not responsible for the very much greater damage 
done to the goods as a result of being shipped in the damaged cartons.100 The buyer’s 
agents had handled the goods and should have appreciated that the cartons were not fit 
for shipment. Thus, the buyer’s damages were limited to the difference between the value 
of the damaged cartons and the value of undamaged cartons. He was unable to recover 
for the damage done to the goods while at sea as a result of being shipped in those 
cartons. But again, if the seller had warranted the cartons in such terms as to lead the 
buyer to suppose that there was no need for him to have the cartons further examined 
or inspected, it would seem clear that the seller would have been responsible for all the 
ultimate damage.
In consumer cases, where goods are bought for use, there is now no difficulty 
in obtaining damages for inconvenience and even disappointment and distress in 
appropriate cases. In Jackson v Chrysler Acceptances Ltd,101 the plaintiff bought a new 
car from the defendants, informing them that he specifically wanted to take it abroad for

his holiday. Owing to repeated breakdowns as a result of defects in the car, the plaintiff’s 
holiday was ruined. It was held that he was entitled to damages for this, in addition 
to normal damages for the defects in the car. In Bernstein v Pamson Motors (Golders 
Green) Ltd,102 where a new car broke down on a motorway, and the plaintiff and his wife 
had to summon emergency assistance, he recovered as damages: (1) the cost of wasted 
petrol; (2) the cost of the palintiff and his wife getting home by alternative transport; 
(3) damages for vexation and distress for the ruined day’s outing and (4) loss of the 
use of the car while it was being repaired. He would also have been entitled to the cost 
of the repairs and the emergency services, if these had not already been borne by the 
defendants.103
Although the Court of Appeal denied that damages for breach of contract can ever 
include an item for ‘mental distress’,104 damages for vexation and disappointment and 
distress continued to be regularly awarded in minor consumer cases, often in the County 
Courts, or before County Court District Judges sitting as arbitrators. (Many such 
cases are reported every year in Current Law.) Moreover, in Farley v Skinner,105 where 
a surveyor was specifically asked to advise whether a holiday property the claimant was 
proposing to buy could be affected by aircraft noise, the House of Lords held that the 
claimant was entitled to non-pecuniary damages when it turned out after the claimant 
had bought the property that it was indeed affected by aircraft noise.106
A different type of consequential loss is encountered where the goods are bought for 
resale, and that is where the buyer has resold and delivered the goods to a sub-buyer 
who later has claimed damages against him for the defects in the goods. We have already 
seen that, in the usual course of events, sub-sales are ignored in claims under ss. 53(3) 
and 53A and claims of this kind therefore are normally treated as claims for ‘special 
damages’ under the second limb of Hadley v Baxendale, which requires proof of special 
knowledge of the probability of resale. But the buyer’s burden of proof here is lighter 
than where he claims similar damages in an action for non-delivery because he need only 
show that sub-sales were contemplated as a reasonable probability and need not go on to 
show (as it seems he must in the non-delivery cases) that he had contracted to resell the 
specific goods to sub-buyers. Once it is shown that the seller should have contemplated 
that the goods were bought for resale, any damages and costs paid to the sub-buyer as a 
result of defects of quality can be properly regarded as special damage recoverable under 
the second limb of Hadley v Baxendale.107 But it has been stressed that in order that the 
buyer should be able to claim such damages and costs it is an overriding requirement 
that the subcontracts should have been made on the same terms and conditions as the 
first contract. For, clearly, if the buyer chooses to resell the goods on more onerous terms

	488	 tHE remedies of the buyer
or with more extensive warranties, he cannot fix liability on his seller for damages he has 
had to pay in respect of these more onerous terms or more extensive warranties. The law 
on this topic was well summed up by Branson J in Kasler & Cohen v Slavouski:108
If a man has sold goods to another in such circumstances as to fix him with special knowledge 
of the purpose for which those goods are being bought, and that other sells them on the same 
terms and conditions and then is subjected to an action because the goods do not come up to 
the contract quality, or for any other reason entitling him to claim damages upon such contract, 
the first purchaser is entitled, if he has acted reasonably in defending the action and has yet 
been cast in damages and costs, to claim from his seller not only the damages but also the costs 
he has had to pay.109
And if the buyer reasonably settles a claim made against him by the sub-buyer, the 
amount paid under such a settlement is prima facie the measure of damages recoverable 
from the seller, and is in any event the upper limit. But it is open to the seller to contest 
the amount and to show that the sum paid was excessive, for he is of course not bound 
by the settlement to which he was not party.110 Moreover, the buyer still has to show that 
there was a breach of contract by the seller; the settlement is only admissible to show the 
prima facie level of damages once liability is proved or established.111
Another type of case in which sub-sales may be taken into account, at least indirectly, 
is illustrated by GKN Centrax Gears Ltd v Matbro Ltd.112 Here, it was held that the 
buyers could recover damages in respect of the loss of repeat orders from customers to 
whom they had resold defective goods supplied by the sellers. So long as such losses are 
within the contemplation of the parties, no question of principle is raised by a claim of 
this nature.
Damages in tort
In English law, where the property and the immediate right to possession have passed 
to the buyer he may have, in addition to his remedies in contract, an action in tort for 
conversion. As between the parties to the contract, the action in tort has no advantages 
and is rarely used. The buyer cannot get higher damages by suing in tort than in contract, 
even where the measure of damages in the former case would normally be the higher,113 
or can he obtain a decree of specific restitution except in cases where he could obtain a

buyer can claim damages paid to the sub-buyer in respect of defects for which the seller would have been 
liable. According to Devlin J in Biggin & Co v Permanite Ltd [1951] 1 KB 422 the answer is ‘Yes’, but with 
qualifications.

it is doubtful if such damages could be awarded in England under Rookes v Barnard [1964] AC 1129. And 
note that (in a different context) the Court of Appeal has indicated that the amount of damages recoverable 
does not depend on whether the claimant’s (pursuer’s) course of action is in contract or tort – see Parsons 
Ltd v Uttley Ingham, p. 485.

decree of specific performance.114 The only advantage to the buyer of the action in tort 
is that it avails against third parties who have meddled with, or caused damage to, the 
goods at a time when the buyer had the property in the goods.
A buyer of goods which are imported from overseas is usually entitled to sue the 
carrier for damage done to the goods at sea, subject to the restrictions on liability 
contained in the Hague-Visby Rules as laid down in the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 
1971. Even in these cases, however, the buyer will rarely need to rely on his property in 
the goods as a basis for his claim. The reason for this is that by virtue of the Carriage of 
Goods by Sea Act 1992, the contract of carriage is actually transferred to the buyer when 
the bills of lading are transferred to him. This gives the buyer in most cases a right to sue 
for damage done from the time of the original shipment of the goods, since they would 
have been covered by the contract of carriage from that time. The buyer will, of course, 
have his recovery limited to the amount permitted under the Hague-Visby Rules.115 It has 
been held by the House of Lords that the buyer cannot sue the carrier in tort in respect 
of damage done at a time before he became owner of the goods.116 Nor, presumably, can 
he avoid the limitations of liability imposed by the Hague-Visby Rules by suing in tort 
after he becomes owner.117
It remains unsettled whether a buyer who does have the property at the relevant time, 
and sues the carrier for damages in tort, will always find his tort action subject to the 
limitations on contractual liability imposed by the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971. 
No doubt, where the contract of carriage is transferred to the buyer – as it usually is – 
the tort action will become subject to the terms of the contract, including the statutory 
regime in the 1971 Act. But if there should be some rare case in which the contract of 
carriage is not transferred although the buyer has acquired the property, it may be that 
the 1971 Act will not restrict the buyer’s action in tort. In this event, there would be very 
clear advantages in suing in tort, but it is certain that a sequence of successful actions of 
that nature would rapidly lead to legislative amendment of the 1971 Act.
Damages for misrepresentation
In a work of this nature it is unnecessary to make more than a brief reference to the 
possibility of an action for damages for misrepresentation. In English law, such an action 
lay at common law for fraud, but under s. 2(1) of the Misrepresentation Act, damages 
may be obtained also for a misrepresentation unless the representor proves he had 
reasonable grounds to believe, and did believe up to the time the contract was made, that 
the acts represented were true. Moreover, under s. 2(2) of the Act, the court may award 
damages even for innocent misrepresentation, in lieu of rescinding the contract. There 
are advantages in making a claim for damages for misrepresentation in the alternative to 
a claim for breach of express warranty. The remedy created by the Act is tortious, and the

damages are to be calculated according to the rules for tort.118 The claimant can recover 
the loss (including consequential loss) he incurred by entering the contract.119 He cannot 
recover loss of profits, but he can recover the difference between the purchase price and 
the value the goods should have had if the representation had been true,120 and he can 
recover profits which would have been made had the misrepresentation not been made, 
and the claimant entered into an alternative contract.121 Moreover, the remoteness rules 
applicable are those of the tort of deceit, and are thus not limited by foreseeability.122
In Scots law, delictual damages may be recovered for fraud and negligent misrepre-
sentation, including pre-contractual negligent misrepresentation, under s. 10 of the Law 
Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1985.
Remedies available to a buyer in breach
English law
Obviously a buyer who is himself in breach of contract has no right to sue for damages, 
but buyers sometimes pay, or agree to pay, part or all of the price of the goods in advance; 
and important and difficult questions may arise with regard to such advance payments if 
the buyer subsequently fails to fulfil his contract and the seller accepts this as a discharge 
of the whole contract.
If the price, or part of it, has actually been paid in advance and the contract is then 
abandoned because of the buyer’s breach the seller may, of course, claim damages for 
non-acceptance from the buyer. But the amount paid by the buyer may greatly exceed 
any damages recoverable by the seller. In Dies v British International Mining etc Corp,123 
the buyers contracted to buy goods to a total value of £270,000 and paid £100,000 before 
the agreed delivery date. The buyers then failed to take the goods or pay the balance 
of the price, and the sellers treated this as discharging the whole contract. The buyers 
sued to recover their advance payments, and this claim was upheld by Stable J, though 
the buyers did not dispute that the sellers were entitled to damages which were set off 
against the £100,000.
On the other hand, it has always been held that payments by way of earnest only; 
that is, by way of forfeitable deposit, are not recoverable by the party in breach. The 
distinction between a part-payment which is thus recoverable by the buyer, and a deposit 
which is not, is said to depend on the intention of the parties. Was it the intention that 
the amount paid in advance should be forfeited if the buyer refused or failed to complete  
the purchase? In practice, contracts often fail to indicate whether such advance payments are  
forfeitable or not, so the question has to be answered by looking to the customs of the trade,  
and also to the amount of the part-payment. Forfeitable deposits of up to 10 per cent

of the price are not uncommon (indeed, almost invariable in the case of contracts for 
the sale of land and houses); and it is well established that prima facie deposits of 
this amount are not recoverable by the buyer if he is in breach, even if the seller resells 
without loss after the buyer’s breach.124 The law relating to penalties, it has been insisted, 
has no application to this situation.125
But in the Dies case, the amount was not only very large in itself but also about 37 per 
cent of the total price. It seems, therefore, that such very large part-payments will not be 
regarded as forfeitable deposits, but will prima facie be recoverable according to the true 
construction of the contract, if the buyer fails to complete.
Unfortunately, the position as set out above is greatly complicated by three further 
problems which often cause great difficulty. The first of these difficulties concerns the 
question whether the above rules also apply where the sum payable in advance is not 
in fact paid. If the buyer was required by the contract to pay a deposit which would 
have been forfeited on breach, but he failed to pay it, can the seller sue for the deposit, 
irrespective of the amount of damage which he has suffered? Although the point is 
by no means free from doubt, the general view seems to be that nothing turns on the 
accidental fact of the time of the actual payment: if the money should have been paid 
before breach, it can be sued for after breach.126 The result gives cause for unease since 
an action to recover more than the claimant has lost through the breach of contract 
must inevitably look penal. The present rules are usually justified by saying that the 
buyer should not be advantaged by the fact that he has broken his contract and failed 
to pay the deposit when he should have paid it, but this often happens when the buyer 
fails to pay the price, because prima facie the seller’s remedy is only an action for non-
delivery, and not for the price itself. It must also be remembered that a contract of sale 
of goods is different from other contracts in that rejection of the goods does to some 
degree work a retrospective rescission of the contract – the goods revest in the seller, and 
his duty to deliver conforming goods can no longer be enforced by the buyer. It is also 
disturbing that the seller is able to recover damages for a totally non-existent ‘loss’ in this 
situation, without any regard to the law relating to penalties. Since there is no real loss, 
the damages must inevitably be penal – the purpose of the action is to punish the buyer 
for his breach in not paying the deposit, and the denial of the relevance of the rules as to 
penalties rests simply on reiteration rather than on any rational justification.
The current rules were pressed even further in Damon Cia Naviera v Hapag-Lloyd 
(The Blankenstein).127 In this case, the buyers had agreed to sign a contract for the 
purchase of three ships for $2.36m. The written contract, if signed, would have required 
the buyers to pay a deposit of 10 per cent of the price ($236,000), which was expressly 
stated to be forfeitable in the event of non-completion by the buyers. The buyers failed 
to sign the written contract, or to pay the deposit, and the sellers sued for damages. The 
sellers had resold the ships for $2.295m, and thus suffered a loss on resale of $65,000, 
which was plainly recoverable once it had been decided that the buyers were guilty of a 
breach of contract. But the sellers argued that they were entitled to much more than this;

	492	 tHE remedies of the buyer
they sought damages representing the amount of the unpaid deposit, on the ground that 
if the buyers had signed the written contract they would have had to pay the deposit, 
which would have been irrecoverable. Because the written contract here had never been 
signed, the sellers did not sue for the deposit itself; their claim was for damages for non-
payment of the deposit. A majority of the Court of Appeal upheld this claim on the 
ground that the sellers were entitled to be put in the position they would have been in 
if the contract had been performed, but Goff LJ dissented on the ground that if the 
whole contract had been performed the sellers would not have obtained more than the 
total purchase price. Effectively, the sellers were claiming not to be put in the position 
they would have been in if the whole contract had been performed, but in the position 
they would have been in if the buyers had first signed the written contract, and then 
defaulted. Whatever the merits of these somewhat refined arguments, the net result 
seems indefensible. The sellers were, in effect, awarded damages far above their loss.
The converse case concerning this point raises no problem. If the amount in question 
is a genuine part-payment rather than a forfeitable deposit – so that if, as in Dies, the 
money had actually been paid in advance, it would have been recoverable by the buyer – 
then it must follow a fortiori that if the buyer has failed to pay it, the seller cannot sue 
for it.
The second major difficulty concerning the above rules arises from the possibility of 
equitable relief. Where a seller sues to recover an agreed penalty payable for breach by 
the buyer, the buyer may try to set up by way of defence the standard equitable doctrines 
restricting the enforcement of penalty clauses. Under these rules, which apply, of course, 
irrespective of the parties’ actual intention, and therefore override the freedom of 
contract of the parties, a clause designed to operate in terrorem, rather than to provide 
for a genuine pre-estimate of the damages, is a penalty clause rather than a liquidated 
damages clause,128 and penalty clauses are unenforceable. But as we have already seen, it 
has several times been insisted that the doctrine of penalties has no application to these 
clauses for the forfeiture of deposits.129 Moreover, the House of Lords has shown a strong 
disinclination to extend the principles of equitable relief to forfeitures in commercial 
contracts.130 But there have been suggestions that a different form of equitable relief 
may be available – that is, relief to enable the buyer to complete the contract late, if he 
is able to pay in full all the sums due plus any costs incurred by the seller.131 It is also 
well established that a forfeiture of a property right is challengeable under the penalty 
rules,132 and it seems the barest technicality to insist that a deposit is a contractual right 
and not a property right.
A third problem arising from the rules about deposits and part payments has been 
touched on earlier,133 and it stems from the decision of the House of Lords in Johnson v 
128	 The leading case is Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v New Garage & Motor Co Ltd [1915] AC 79.

Agnew,134 which for the first time laid down a much more clear and precise demarcation 
line between termination of a contract for breach and rescission ab initio for fraud or 
other invalidating cause. A termination does not operate retrospectively in the same way 
that rescission ab initio does. So it may seem that if the buyer pays part of the price in 
advance, or is bound to do so and fails, his obligation to do this remains binding on him, 
despite the subsequent termination of the contract. But if that were the law, then the 
decision in Dies would be wrong, and a buyer who paid part of the price in advance – no 
matter how large a part, or indeed, even if he paid the whole price in advance – would 
be unable to recover it if he were subsequently guilty of non-acceptance of the goods.135
This, indeed, seems to have been the conclusion which the House of Lords were 
inclining towards in Hyundai Heavy Industries Co Ltd v Papadopoulos,136 which has 
been discussed earlier. It was here held that instalments payable by the buyer of a ship 
while the ship was under construction remained payable, despite the seller’s subsequent 
decision to treat the non-payment as a repudiation and to terminate the whole contract.137 
Doubt was cast on the decision in Dies though in the end it was distinguished rather 
than overruled. It was said that if Dies was correct, it only applied to a pure contract of 
sale and not to a contract to manufacture and sell goods on grounds which have been 
given earlier.138 Since then, the Court of Appeal has suggested that the difference between 
Hyundai and Dies lies in the fact that there was a total failure of consideration in the 
second case but not in the first.139 On this view, a prepayment (not being a forfeitable 
deposit) will be recoverable by the buyer – or not payable – where there is a total failure 
of consideration, and in an ordinary contract of sale there will be such a total failure of 
consideration whenever the goods are not delivered or accepted, from whatever cause, 
even if the seller is also the manufacturer.140
Scots law
In Scots law, the principle of mutuality of contract will disable a party in breach from 
claiming performance of the contract from the other party.141 But the contract-breaker 
may have other remedies in respect of part-performance under the contract.142 Whether

135	 If the whole price is paid in advance, it may be arguable that a non-acceptance by the buyer could never be

that such a result could never be justified.
136	 [1980] 1 WLR 1129. But another difficulty which did not actually arise in the Hyundai case is that the mere 
fact that the obligation to pay the price is binding on the buyer does not mean he can be sued for the price.

held that the condictio causa data causa non secuta could not be invoked by a contract-

was forfeited as a result of the breach, making the enrichment question irrelevant.

illustrative of the absence in Scots law of any control over forfeiture clauses, although the 
Scottish Law Commission has proposed reform in this area.144 Finally, in Lloyds Bank v  
Bamberger,145 the Second Division rejected the extreme interpretation of the Hyundai 
case to the effect that rights arising before termination of a contract are unaffected 
because termination is only prospective in its effects. The Division preferred the view of 
Lord Fraser in Hyundai, that the payments in that case were not truly advances but were 
rather to maintain cash flow against work being done, and also affirmed that genuine 
advances fell to be returned after termination.

Consumer sales contracts
From the Sale of Goods Act to the Consumer Rights Act
Since the last edition of this work was published, there have been major developments 
in the field of consumer law, one outcome of which is the enactment of the Consumer 
Rights Act 2015.1 This marked the culmination of intense reform activity both within 
the UK and by the EU. The effect of these changes is that many of the provisions in the 
Sale of Goods Act which previously applied to both consumer and commercial contracts 
of sale (or specifically to consumer sales) are now limited to non-consumer contracts, 
particularly with regard to the obligations of a seller, or ‘trader’ in the language of the 
Consumer Rights Act (CRA), and the remedies of the consumer. The Consumer Rights 
Act does more than merely hive-off the regulation of consumer contracts – whilst some 
provisions previously found in the Sale of Goods Act were re-enacted in substantively 
unamended form (save for some adjustments to language), there are also some important 
developments, including a better integration of the existing right to reject goods and 
terminate a contract for breach of condition with the specific remedies for consumer 
contracts introduced into the Sale of Goods Act in order to implement the Consumer 
Sales Directive (99/44/EC). In addition, the Consumer Rights Act seeks to overcome, 
insofar as possible, the often artificial distinction between different forms of supply 
transactions. A further significant novelty is the introduction of specific rules on ‘digital 
content’, which to a large extent renders obsolete the academic discussion about whether 
software/digital content ought to be treated as ‘goods’ for the purposes of the Sale of 
Goods Act. The parts of the Act dealt with in this chapter generally extend to England  
and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and are mostly drafted in jurisdiction-neutral 
language.
The reform process started in 2004 when the UK government first considered 
modernising consumer law.2 This needs to be seen in the context of developments at the 
EU level at that time – the Directive on Unfair Commercial Practices (2005/29/EU) was 
about to be adopted. Its implementation into domestic law in the Consumer Protection 
from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (CPUTR)3 was used as a way of simplifying aspects 
of UK consumer law, resulting in the replacement of over 30 existing pieces of legislation 
(including much of the Trade Descriptions Act 1968). This opportunity for simplification 
of the consumer law landscape prompted the government to consider whether it would

equally be possible to simplify and/or consolidate areas of consumer law not covered 
by the CPUTR.4 A subsequent White Paper5 set out concrete plans, notably plans for 
a Consumer Rights Bill to implement a further EU directive then on the horizon, the 
Consumer Rights Directive, and to modernise and simplify UK Consumer Law.6 At the 
request of the government, two academic reports were produced which provided detailed 
options for consolidation and simplification7 and the possible regulation of digital 
content.8 In addition, the Law Commissions published two key reports on consumer 
law reform, one dealing with consumer remedies for faulty goods9 and a second on 
introducing a private right of redress in respect of some unfair commercial practices 
caught by the CPUTR.10 There was further consultation on the general approach11 and 
on specific proposals in 2012.12 As the Consumer Rights Directive (2011/83/EU) had 
by then been adopted and had to be implemented by 13 December 2013 (provisions 
to be in force by 13 June 2014), it was decided to deal with the implementation of the 
Consumer Rights Directive separately. The Consumer Rights Bill would deal with the 
sale and supply of goods, services and digital content, unfair contract terms, damages 
for breach of competition law rules, and improved enforcement measures. A draft Bill 
was published in June 2013, and the Bill introduced into Parliament on 23 January 2014. 
It received Royal Assent at the end of March 2015. The Act does not consolidate all 
areas of consumer law, and for the time being the Consumer Contracts (Information, 
Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013 (‘CCR’)13 which implement 
the Consumer Rights Directive,14 the CPUTR (now amended)15 and the provisions from  
the Consumer Protection Act 198716 remain separate.17 It also needs to be noted that the 
Consumer Rights Act does not contain any provisions on the transfer of property or on

Consumer sales contracts	 499
the nemo dat rule and its exceptions,18 so the Sale of Goods Act provision continue to 
apply.19
This chapter provides an overview of the new law, particularly as it applies to 
contracts for the sale and supply of goods.
Key definitions and scope
For this book, the most relevant part of the Consumer Rights Act is Part 1, dealing with 
consumer contracts for goods, digital content and services.20 The part is then divided 
into separate chapters, dealing with contracts between a trader and a consumer to 
supply goods, digital content or services respectively. A consumer is ‘an individual acting 
for purposes that are wholly or mainly outside that individual’s trade, business, craft 
or profession’,21 and a trader is ‘a person acting for purposes relating to that person’s 
trade, business, craft or profession, whether acting personally or through another person 
acting in the trader’s name or on the trader’s behalf’.22
One of the objectives of the CRA is to ensure that the rules and remedies in respect of 
all three are as similar as possible (although with regard to services, the CRA continues 
to apply the requirement that the service must be performed with reasonable care and 
skill only).23 More significantly, the CRA overcomes the need to classify transactions to 
identify which Act applies: so whenever a contract between a trader and a consumer 
involves the supply of goods, chapter 2 of Part 1 applies; when it involves the supply 
of digital content, chapter 3 applies, and in respect of services, chapter 4 applies.24 If 
the contract involves a combination (‘mixed contract’), then all relevant chapters apply.25 
As a result, whenever a contract between a consumer and a trader involves the supply 
of goods (whether that is a sale, hire-purchase or hire) the same provisions will apply, 
although there are minor modifications for certain contracts. This has to be seen as a 
welcome development in the law, although it heightens the need to consider a similar 
reform in respect of commercial contracts, where the old distinction between different 
18	 See Chapter 15.
19	 At the time of preparing this edition, the Law Commission was consulting on Consumer Prepayments on 
Retailer Insolvency (London, TSO, 2015). As part of this project, it is considering amendments to the rules 
on the passing of property. It is not known if specific proposals will emerge and if the current government 
will take these forward (the project was referred by the coalition government before the 2015 general 
election).
20	 Section 1(1) CRA. Part 2 of the CRA contains rules on unfair terms in consumer contracts which consolidate 
the provisions previously found in the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 and the Unfair Terms in Consumer 
Contracts Regulations 1999. Part 3 contains a range of provisions dealing with enforcement, private actions 
in respect of competition law infringements, letting agents and, secondary-ticketing markets.
21	 S.2(3) CRA, mirroring the definition used in EU Directives and removing the possibility under the previous 
law that in certain circumstances a company or a partnership could be a ‘consumer’ – see the 12th edition of 
this work at p.229. The definition is modified in respect of most provisions in Chapter 2 on goods to exclude 
sales contracts for second-hand goods sold at a public auction which individuals have the opportunity 
of attending in person (s.2(5)/(6) CRA). This reflects the restriction in Article1(3) of the Consumer Sales 
Directive (99/44/EC) for which ch.2 is now the implementing measure, although in the Directive that 
restriction applies to the definition of ‘goods’ rather than ‘consumer’.

types of supply transactions and consequently, the application of different Acts of 
Parliament continues to be an unnecessarily confusing feature of the law.
Contracts for the supply of goods
Chapter 2 deals with contracts for the supply of goods. In the CRA, goods are defined 
as ‘any tangible moveable items, but that includes water, gas and electricity if and only if 
they are put up for supply in a limited volume or set quantity’.26 There are four types of 
contract included in the umbrella definition of ‘contract to supply goods’27
	
(a)	 a sales contract;
	
(b)	 a contract for the hire of goods;
	
(c)	 a hire-purchase agreement;
	
(d)	 a contract for transfer of goods.
This definition of a contract to supply goods is exhaustive section 3(2) CRA opens 
with the words ‘it applies only if’ the contract is one of the four listed above. This might 
leave some supply transactions outside the scope of this chapter, and so the definitions 
of these contracts in ss. 5–8 CRA are important. Of particular note is the definition of 
‘sales contract’ in s. 5, which states that
A contract is a sales contract if under it—
(a)	 the trader transfers or agrees to transfer ownership of goods to the consumer, and
(b)	 the consumer pays or agrees to pay the price.
(2)	 A contract is a sales contract (whether or not it would be one under subsection (1)) if 
under the contract—
(a)	 goods are to be manufactured or produced and the trader agrees to supply them to the 
consumer,
(b)	 on being supplied, the goods will be owned by the consumer, and
(c)	 the consumer pays or agrees to pay the price.
(3)	 A sales contract may be conditional (see section 3(5)), but in this Part “conditional sales 
contract” means a sales contract under which—
(a)	 the price for the goods or part of it is payable by instalments, and
(b)	 the trader retains ownership of the goods until the conditions specified in the contract 
(for the payment of instalments or otherwise) are met; and it makes no difference 
whether or not the consumer possesses the goods.
This definition appears clearer than that in s. 2(1) of the Sale of Goods Act 1979, 
and it contains the clarification that it also covers goods to be manufactured or 
produced (reflecting Article 2(4) of the Consumer Sales Directive). It is certainly 
helpful to have this additional clarification in the definition, as there might otherwise 
have been a loophole in respect of these contracts: although the CRA would apply 
to mixed contracts involving a service and the supply of goods, a contract to 
manufacture goods to order would possibly not qualify as one of the four types of 
supply contracts. However, it seems that the definition of ‘contract for transfer of 
26	 S. 2(8) CRA, reflecting the definition of goods in Article1(2)(b)
27	 S. 3(2) CRA. Note that in Scotland gratuitous contracts to supply goods are excluded: s. 3(3)(e) CRA. On 
gratuitousness see Eassie and MacQueen, Gloag & Henderson The Law of Scotland (12th edn, W Green & 
Son Ltd, 2012), paras 5.01-5.03.

	
	 	
Consumer sales contracts	 501
goods’ in s. 8, which relates to other contracts involving the transfer of ownership in 
goods, would ensure that the CRA applies: s. 8(a) of that definition essentially covers 
contracts of barter or exchange (‘consideration otherwise than paying a price’), but  
s. 8(b) effectively operates as a safety net by including a contract which ‘for any other 
reason, [is] not a sales contract or a hire-purchase agreement’.
Requirements in respect of goods
Sections 9 (satisfactory quality), 10 (fit for particular purpose) and 11 (description) then 
essentially re-enact the substance of the provisions previously contained in ss. 13–14 
of the Sale of Goods Act (in their most recent form). There have been some changes 
to the layout and wording from the corresponding provisions in the Sale of Goods 
Act to provide greater clarity, and also to broaden the requirements in some respects. 
Moreover, there has been a shift in the terminology – the CRA states that under these 
sections, a ‘contract is to be treated as including a term’, rather than the ‘implied 
terms’ language used in the Sale of Goods Act, and the term is no longer classed as a 
condition. Apart from making the text jurisdiction-neutral, the thinking behind this is 
that the CRA contains a detailed set of remedies available if there is a breach of any 
of these terms, which, as will be seen below, include the right to reject the goods and 
terminate the contract. This is one step towards recognising that in a consumer contract, 
the implied terms had become de facto statutory rules, and the general common law 
remedies for breach of contract had already been significantly modified by the notion of 
‘acceptance’.28 However, it is somewhat unfortunate that the Consumer Rights Act stops 
short of making the requirements of quality and fitness fully statutory and continues to 
adhere to the idea that these are terms of the contract. The only benefit that this might 
bring is the ability of a consumer to claim damages for any consequential losses (or, 
indeed, as an alternative to the statutory remedies) on the basis of the general common 
law rules (see below). One wonders whether it would not have made more sense to use 
the Consumer Rights Act to provide a complete set of remedies, including rules on 
available damages, but, as has already been noted, the Act does not quite constitute a 
full consolidation of the main rules of consumer law.
Satisfactory quality
Section 9(1) specifies that ‘every contract to supply goods is to be treated as including a term 
that the quality of the goods is satisfactory’. S. 9(2)–(4) repeat the familiar test for establishing 
whether goods are of satisfactory quality (cf. ss. 14(2A)–(2C) of the Sale of Goods Act):29
(2)	 The quality of goods is satisfactory if they meet the standard that a reasonable person 
would consider satisfactory, taking account of—
(a)	 any description of the goods,
(b)	 the price or other consideration for the goods (if relevant), and
(c)	 all the other relevant circumstances (see subsection (5)).
28	 S. 35 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979.
29	 See the discussion in Chapter 9, above.

	502	 Consumer sales
(3)	 The quality of goods includes their state and condition; and the following aspects (among 
others) are in appropriate cases aspects of the quality of goods—
(a)	 fitness for all the purposes for which goods of that kind are usually supplied;
(b)	 appearance and finish;
(c)	 freedom from minor defects;
(d)	 safety;
(e)	 durability.
(4)	 The term mentioned in subsection (1) does not cover anything which makes the quality of 
the goods unsatisfactory—
(a)	 which is specifically drawn to the consumer’s attention before the contract is made,
(b)	 where the consumer examines the goods before the contract is made, which that 
examination ought to reveal, or
(c)	 in the case of a contract to supply goods by sample, which would have been apparent 
on a reasonable examination of the sample.
There is no substantive difference from the provisions in the Sale of Goods Act. One 
interesting question is the extent to which case law under s. 14 of the Sale of Goods Act will be 
taken into account when interpreting s. 9 CRA. The near-identical wording will undoubtedly 
tempt a court to refer to such earlier case law, but if this is done, a court should be mindful 
of the following: first, a case which was decided after 1995 (when the satisfactory quality 
test was first introduced) involving a consumer contract will be a strong authority on the 
application of the satisfactory test in s. 9 CRA, but any case between two commercial parties 
should be treated with caution and not followed without due consideration of whether this 
would be appropriate in a consumer case. Secondly, a court also needs to remember that this 
section is one of the provisions implementing Article 2(2) of the Consumer Sales Directive, 
and so any interpretation needs to take full account of any relevant rulings by the Court of 
Justice of the European Union. Over time, it is plausible that distinct case law under s. 9 
CRA will emerge – and should the Sale of Goods Act itself be revised to assess its suitability 
for commercial contracts, an altogether different test might emerge.30
Section 9(5)-(7) then include the provisions previously contained in ss. 14(2D)–(2F)  
dealing with the inclusion of public statements within the notion of ‘relevant 
circumstances’ based on Articles 2(2)(d) and 2(4) of the Consumer Sales Directive:
(5)	 The relevant circumstances mentioned in subsection (2)(c) include any public statement 
about the specific characteristics of the goods made by the trader, the producer or any 
representative of the trader or the producer.
(6)	 That includes, in particular, any public statement made in advertising or labelling.
(7)	 But a public statement is not a relevant circumstance for the purposes of subsection (2)(c) 
if the trader shows that—
(a)	 when the contract was made, the trader was not, and could not reasonably have been, 
aware of the statement,
(b)	 before the contract was made, the statement had been publicly withdrawn or, to the 
extent that it contained anything which was incorrect or misleading, it had been pub-
licly corrected, or
(c)	 the consumer’s decision to contract for the goods could not have been influenced by 
the statement.
30	 This could, perhaps, be modelled on Article35 of the UN Convention on the International Sale of Goods 
1980 – see Chapter 17, above.

	
	 	
Consumer sales contracts	 503
Fitness for particular purpose
Section 10 CRA is based on s. 14(3) of the Sale of Goods Act, but what is one sub-section 
in that Act is now a separate section with several sub-sections. There is no difference in 
the substantive effect of s. 10 CRA as compared to s. 14(3) of the Sale of Goods Act, but 
the new provision is more intelligible. It provides that
(1)	 Subsection (3) applies to a contract to supply goods if before the contract is made the con-
sumer makes known to the trader (expressly or by implication) any particular purpose for 
which the consumer is contracting for the goods.
(2)	 Subsection (3) also applies to a contract to supply goods if—
(a)	 the goods were previously sold by a credit-broker to the trader,
(b)	 in the case of a sales contract or contract for transfer of goods, the consideration or 
part of it is a sum payable by instalments, and
(c)	 before the contract is made, the consumer makes known to the credit-broker (expressly 
or by implication) any particular purpose for which the consumer is contracting for 
the goods.
(3)	 The contract is to be treated as including a term that the goods are reasonably fit for 
that purpose, whether or not that is a purpose for which goods of that kind are usually 
supplied.
(4)	 Subsection (3) does not apply if the circumstances show that the consumer does not rely, 
or it is unreasonable for the consumer to rely, on the skill or judgment of the trader or 
credit-broker.
The requirements are familiar: a particular purpose has to be made known, and then 
the goods have to be reasonably fit for that purpose. It will be interesting to see if case 
law will develop a separate approach to the trader’s defence in sub-section 4 that the 
consumer did not rely on the trader’s skill or judgment, or that it was unreasonable 
for him to do so. Article 2(2)(b) of the Consumer Sales Directive (99/44/EC) adopts a 
different approach to this issue. It includes within the presumption of ‘conformity’ that 
the goods
… are fit for any particular purpose for which the consumer requires them and which he  
made known to the seller at the time of conclusion of the contract and which the seller has 
accepted.
This provision seems to put the matter more succinctly still, although there are 
differences. First, it seems that Article 2(2)(b) might require absolute fitness, rather 
than reasonable fitness (although there might be good grounds for having a higher 
standard in a consumer context) and secondly, the burden of proving that the seller has 
accepted that purpose is probably with the consumer, unlike the proviso in what is now 
s. 10(4) CRA, which puts the onus of showing a lack of reliance on the trader. Perhaps 
some more thought could have been given to how a statutory provision on fitness for 
a particular purpose should be worded in an Act dealing exclusively with consumer 
contracts.
Terms included as a matter of custom
Section 9(8) and s. 10(5) provide that a term about the quality of goods or fitness for a 
particular purpose might be treated as included in the contract as a matter of custom.

	504	 Consumer sales
Goods to match description
Section 11 CRA deals with the requirement that goods have to be as described. Other 
than a slight change of wording (‘match’ rather than ‘correspond’), the substance of  
s. 13 of the Sale of Goods Act is retained:
(1)	 Every contract to supply goods by description is to be treated as including a term that the 
goods will match the description.
(2)	 If the supply is by sample as well as by description, it is not sufficient that the bulk of the 
goods matches the sample if the goods do not also match the description.
(3)	 A supply of goods is not prevented from being a supply by description just because—
(a)	 the goods are exposed for supply, and
(b)	 they are selected by the consumer.
Thus far, this is familiar material. However, the section then goes on to provide that
(4)	 Any information that is provided by the trader about the goods and is information men-
tioned in paragraph (a) of Schedule 1 or 2 to the Consumer Contracts (Information, Can-
cellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013 (SI 2013/3134) (main characteristics of 
goods) is to be treated as included as a term of the contract.
(5)	 A change to any of that information, made before entering into the contract or later, is not 
effective unless expressly agreed between the consumer and the trader.
As will be seen below, the Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013, which implement the 
Consumer Rights Directive (2011/83/EU), impose a range of pre-contractual information 
requirements. The Directive requires that this information is an ‘integral part’ of the contract 
(Article 6(5)), and so this provision ensures that this is done with regard to information 
about the main characteristics of the goods. As there would appear to be a significant 
overlap between the terms treated as included by s. 11(4) CRA and s. 11(1) CRA, this is not 
a particularly clear way of dealing with this matter. It underlines the point made earlier that 
the lack of proper consolidation of the legislation affecting consumer contracts is regrettable 
and likely to cause some confusion in the future.
This is somewhat exacerbated by s. 12 CRA, which deals with to all the other 
information requirements under the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation 
and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013.
Goods to match sample or model
Section 13 CRA is based on s. 15 of the Sale of Goods Act and deals with goods supplied 
by reference to a sample. It provides that
(1)	 This section applies to a contract to supply goods by reference to a sample of the goods 
that is seen or examined by the consumer before the contract is made.
(2)	 Every contract to which this section applies is to be treated as including a term that—
(a)	 the goods will match the sample except to the extent that any differences between the  
sample and the goods are brought to the consumer’s attention before the contract is 
made, and
(b)	 the goods will be free from any defect that makes their quality unsatisfactory and that 
would not be apparent on a reasonable examination of the sample.

	
	 	
Consumer sales contracts	 505
There is then a new provision in s. 14 CRA which deals with goods supplied by reference 
to a model. Presumably, this new provision reflects the requirements of Article 2(2)(a) 
of the Consumer Sales Directive (99/44/EC), which includes in the presumption of 
conformity that goods ‘possess the qualities of the goods which the seller has held out to 
the consumer as a sample or model’. However, rather than covering both in one section, 
the new s. 14 provides
(1)	 This section applies to a contract to supply goods by reference to a model of the goods 
that is seen or examined by the consumer before entering into the contract.
(2)	 Every contract to which this section applies is to be treated as including a term that the goods 
will match the model except to the extent that any differences between the model and the goods 
are brought to the consumer’s attention before the consumer enters into the contract.
The main difference between s. 13 and s. 14 is that there is no corresponding provision to 
s. 13(2)(b) in s. 14, which seems appropriate as a sample is a part of the actual goods to be 
supplied (e.g. a fabric swatch), whereas a model is a scale representation of a finished item.
Installation of goods
The Consumer Sales Directive (99/44/EC) introduced a requirement dealing with the 
installation of goods. Article 2(5) deals with two circumstances: (1) where installation 
is part of the contract and the seller has installed the goods (or they were installed 
under his responsibility), then incorrect installation of the goods is treated as a lack of 
conformity; and (2) if the consumer installs the item and incorrect installation is the 
result of a shortcoming in the installation instructions. Section 15 CRA deals with the 
first of these two instances:
Goods do not conform to a contract to supply goods if—
(a)	 installation of the goods forms part of the contract,
(b)	 the goods are installed by the trader or under the trader’s responsibility, and
(c)	 the goods are installed incorrectly.
However, there is no reference to shortcomings in installation instructions where 
goods are installed by the consumer, despite the very clear provision in Article 2(5) 
of the Consumer Sales Directive. This omission is potentially problematic because 
it might leave the UK open to a complaint by the European Commission about incomplete 
transposition, although it is very likely that a court faced with a complaint based 
on inadequate installation instructions would find in the consumer’s favour on the basis 
of the satisfactory quality test in s. 9 as a ‘relevant circumstance’. Nevertheless, it seems 
odd that no steps were taken to include this expressly in the Consumer Rights Act.
Digital content and goods
Section 16 is a provision to address a problem increasingly common with goods which 
often include digital content (usually operating software) to function. There may be 
instances when goods fail to work satisfactorily, not because of a mechanical problem 
but because an issue with the software digital content included with the goods. If that 

	506	 Consumer sales
digital content does not conform to the contract of supply (see below), then by virtue of 
s. 16(1), the goods themselves are deemed not be in conformity.
Right to supply goods, freedom from encumbrances  
and right to quiet possession
It was seen in ch. 5 above that s.12 of the Sale of Goods Act includes a term about the 
seller’s right to sell the goods, that goods must be free from any undisclosed charges or 
encumbrances, and that the buyer has the right to enjoy quiet possession of the goods. 
Similarly, s. 7 of the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982 includes related provisions in 
respect of contracts of hire. Section 17 CRA is a substantively corresponding provision 
which deals with both contracts involving the transfer of ownership in goods (ss. (1)–(2)), 
hire (ss. (3)), and contracts for the transfer of a limited title (ss. (4)–(7)).
Remedies (consumer’s rights to enforce terms about goods)
The remedies (referred to as ‘rights’ in the CRA) available for a breach of the terms 
discussed above are set out in s. 19 CRA. For this purpose, s. 19(1) defines the shorthand 
phrase ‘goods conforming to a contract’ as compliance with ss. 9–11 and 13–16, as 
well as any additional requirements expressly stated in the contract. However, there 
is a limitation in s. 19(2) which excludes any failure to conform if this has its origins 
in materials supplied by the consumer (reflecting the final part of Article 2(3) of the 
Consumer Sales Directive).
The remedies available to a consumer depend on the type of breach complained of. 
The following table summarises the position:
Non-conformity due to breach of:
Rights (remedies):
satisfactory quality (s.9)

Consumer sales contracts	 507
Section 19(7) makes these remedies subject to the provisions dealing with the delivery 
of the wrong quantity,31 and the availability of the short-term right of rejection or the 
right to reject for breach of the term under s. 17(1) is subject to the rules on instalment 
deliveries.32
In respect of all the requirements regarding the goods (ss. 9–17 and express terms 
in the contract), a consumer can seek remedies not provided for in the Act, either in 
addition to one of the Act’s remedies (provided that this would not mean that the 
consumer recovers twice for the same loss) or instead of, and in respect of, breaches for 
which the Act itself does not provide any remedies. As s. 19(11) states:
Those other remedies include any of the following that is open to the consumer in the 
circumstances—
(a)	 claiming damages;
(b)	 seeking specific performance;
(c)	 seeking an order for specific implement;
(d)	 relying on the breach against a claim by the trader for the price;
(e)	 for breach of an express term, exercising a right to treat the contract as at an end.
However, the right to terminate the contract (‘to treat the contract as at an end’) is not 
available for any breaches of the terms included in the contract under the Act except as 
indicated in the table above.
The availability of repair or replacement, price reduction and the final right to reject 
(all of which are derived from Article 3 of the Consumer Sales Directive (99/44/EC)) 
benefit from the provisions in ss. 19(14) and (15), which creates a presumption that if 
goods do not conform to the contract at any time during the six-month period from the 
date of delivery, they did not conform at the time of delivery. However, a trader can rebut 
this presumption by showing that the goods did in fact conform to the contract when 
delivered, or the presumption is incompatible with the nature of the goods,33 or the type 
of non-conformity complained of.34
The various remedies will be examined in turn below but before doing so, a further 
observation is appropriate. One of the objectives of the Consumer Rights Act was to 
integrate the remedies introduced by the Consumer Rights Directive (99/44/EC) with 
the existing right to reject the goods. When the Directive was first implemented in 2002 
through the insertion of Part 5A into the Sale of Goods Act (now repealed), the link 
between old and new remedies was so confusing that this had been highlighted as a very 
poor example of implementing EU legislation into UK law,35 and the Law Commissions 
were asked to propose appropriate reforms.36 Although the gist of the Law Commissions’ 
proposals has found their way into the Act, there is one important recommendation 
which was not followed. To integrate old and new remedies, the Commissions correctly 
noted that the right to reject the goods and the right to terminate the contract, whilst

often exercised together, are two separate stages. Moreover, when a consumer requests 
repair or replacement he is also, in fact, rejecting the goods, although not terminating 
the contract. So the Law Commissions recommended that the primary remedy would 
be rejecting the goods, with a choice of three follow-on remedies: repair, replacement 
or termination of the contract. It is regrettable that this particular recommendation was 
not followed by the government, as doing so would have further simplified the law and 
ensured a proper integration of all the remedies.
Right to reject
In the Consumer Rights Act, there are three variants of the right to reject:37 the ‘short-
term’ right to reject, the ‘final’ right to reject, and right to reject for breach of the term 
included in the contract by s. 17(1).38 A consumer can reject the goods and treat the 
contract as at an end by indicating so to the trader.39 This can be done by words or 
action, as long as it is sufficiently clear to the trader that the consumer is rejecting the 
goods.40
Following rejection, the trader is under a duty to give the consumer a refund,41 which 
normally means that the consumer is entitled to receive back the same amount of money 
that he paid.42 If the consumer transferred something else, the consumer is entitled to 
receive back what was transferred, either the same amount of what was transferred43 or, 
in case it is not substitutable, whatever was transferred in its original state.44 However, 
in the latter case, there is no right to a refund if it is not possible to return what was 
transferred in its original state.45 A consumer is able to claim damages in that situation 
instead.46
A refund has to be given ‘without undue delay’, and within 14 days from when the 
trader agrees that the consumer is entitled to a refund47 (rather than from the date when 
the consumer has rejected the goods). Unless the consumer agrees otherwise, a refund 
has to be made using the same payment method as the one used by the consumer, and 
the trader is precluded from charging any fees for the payment method used.48
In contracts of hire, the refund covers only the hire charges for the period of hire 
not used following termination of the contract.49 If the consumer transferred something 
else for the duration of the hire, then the consumer is entitled to receive back whatever 
reflects the unused period of hire unless it is not possible to return only a part of that.50

Consumer sales contracts	 509
Conversely, in respect of a hire-purchase or conditional sale contract, any instalments 
already paid are refunded only.51 This reflects the different objectives of these supply 
contracts: a hire contract is a fixed-term agreement for the duration of which the 
consumer is entitled to use the goods, and up to the point when the contract is 
terminated, the consumer will have had use of the goods and is therefore required to pay 
charges accordingly. A hire-purchase or conditional sale agreement ultimately have the 
objective of transferring ownership, but following termination this will not happen and, 
consequently, the consumer is entitled to receive back everything he paid.
As far as the consumer is concerned, after rejecting the goods, he has to make the 
goods available for collection by the trader, or, if it is agreed that the consumer will 
return them to the trader, to return them as agreed.52 Irrespective of how the goods are 
returned, the trader has to bear any reasonable costs of returning the goods; however, 
this does not extend to the cost for the consumer of returning the goods to the place 
where the consumer took physical possession of the goods.53 Thus, if the consumer 
bought goods in a shop and took them home, the consumer has to pay for the bus fare, 
or car parking charges etc., associated with returning to that shop.
Section 21 provides for the partial rejection of goods where the contract covers more 
than one item. This is familiar from s. 35A of the Sale of Goods Act. The consumer 
can elect which of the non-conforming goods to reject (although he has to keep those 
goods which do conform) – whether delivered all at once or in instalments, but if the 
goods form a commercial unit54 then all of the goods in that unit have to be rejected  
(or none). Section 21 then repeats the provisions on exercising the right to reject, 
providing a refund to the consumer, and making the goods available to the trader already 
discussed.
In a departure from the vagueness associated with the question of how long the 
reasonable period of time lasts before a buyer is deemed to have accepted the goods 
under s. 35 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979, s. 22 of the Consumer Rights Act introduces a 
clear time limit, although consumer and trader can agree on a longer time period. But if 
nothing is agreed the time limit starts to run once ownership in the goods has transferred 
to the consumer (or, in the case of hire, hire-purchase or conditional sale, possession), 
the goods have been delivered, and in the case of contracts requiring the trader to install 
the goods or take some other action before the consumer can use them, the trader has 
notified that the necessary action has been taken55 (although the consumer can exercise 
his right to reject before all of these things have occurred).56 The time limit ends after  
30 days. If goods are reasonably expected to have a shorter life expectancy, then the 
shorter period applies.
The section then goes on to deal with the impact on the time limit in circumstances 
where the consumer opts for repair or replacement rather than immediate rejection. If 
the consumer does so within the 30-day period, time stops on the day the consumer has

	510	 Consumer sales
requested or agreed to repair or replacement and a ‘waiting period’ starts.57 The waiting 
period ends on the day the consumer receives back the repaired goods or a replacement.58 
If the goods still do not conform to the contract, the time limit for exercising the right 
to reject will be either seven days after the end of the waiting period, or if the unexpired 
portion of the original time limit is longer, then it is the remaining portion of the time 
limit (but time only starts to run again after the waiting period has finished).
For example, A has bought a new microwave oven on 1 July. On 15 July, it stopped 
working (which means it was not of satisfactory quality at the time of delivery). The 
consumer asked the retailer to replace the oven, and the replacement was received on 
20 July. On 3 August, the replacement oven stops. More than 30 days have passed since 
delivery, but asking for a replacement started the waiting period. At that time, there were 
still 16 days of the time limit left. The time limit re-started when the replacement was 
delivered to the consumer, and there were still two days left to run when the replacement 
oven failed. The consumer can therefore still exercise the short-term right of rejection.
Another example is as follows. A has bought a new microwave oven on 1 July. On 29 
July, it stopped working (which means it was not of satisfactory quality at the time of 
delivery). The consumer asked the retailer to replace the oven, and the replacement was 
received on 1 August. On 6 August, the replacement oven stops working. More than 30 
days have passed since delivery, but asking for a replacement started the waiting period. 
At that time, there were only 2 days of the time limit left. The time limit re-started when 
the replacement was delivered to the consumer. As there were only 2 days remaining, the 
time limit is extended to 7 days. The consumer can therefore still exercise the short-term 
right of rejection.
In a third example, A bought a new microwave oven on 1 July. On 29 July, it stopped 
working (which means it was not of satisfactory quality at the time of delivery). The 
consumer asked the retailer to replace the oven, and the replacement was received on 
1 August. On 14 August, the replacement oven stops working. More than 30 days have 
passed since delivery, but asking for a replacement started the waiting period. At that 
time, there were only 2 days of the time limit left. The time limit re-started when the 
replacement was delivered to the consumer. As there were only 2 days remaining, the 
time limit is extended to 7 days, but this meant that the time limit expired on 8 August. 
The consumer can therefore no longer exercise the short-term right of rejection.
Repair and replacement
Instead of rejecting the goods and treating the contract as at an end, a consumer can, in 
the circumstances set out above, request a repair or replacement. Repair means bringing 
goods which do not conform to the contract into conformity.59 Generally speaking, the 
consumer has the right to choose either repair or replacement, but that choice may 
not always be available. S. 23 (3) states that the trader cannot be required to repair or 
replace an item if that is impossible, or if the remedy the consumer has requested is 
57	 S. 22(8)(a).
58	 S. 22(8)(b).
59	 S. 23(8) CRA.

	
	 	
Consumer sales contracts	 511
disproportionate to the other of those remedies.60 So if one remedy is impossible, 
then the consumer can only request the other, and if both remedies are impossible, 
the consumer can either rely on the short-term right of rejection (if still available), or 
alternatively request a reduction of the price or the final right of rejection (see below).
In order to establish whether a remedy is disproportionate compared to the other, it is 
necessary to consider whether it would impose unreasonable costs on the trader, taking 
into account
(a)	 the value which the goods would have if they conformed to the contract,
(b)	 the significance of the lack of conformity, and
(c)	 whether the other remedy could be effected without significant inconvenience to the 
consumer.
Assuming the chosen remedy (repair or replacement) is available then the trader is 
required to provide this within a reasonable time and without significant inconvenience 
to the consumer.61 This is to be determined by considering the nature of the goods and 
the purpose for which the goods were acquired.62 The trader is also required to cover the 
relevant costs of providing the chosen remedy, including postage, materials and labour.63
Price reduction and the final right to reject
There are three circumstances when a consumer is entitled to request a price reduction, 
or exercise the final right to reject (although not both):64
(1)	 The goods do not conform to the contract after one repair or replacement. This requires 
that the consumer has requested or agreed to repair or replacement, and the trader has 
delivered or made available goods to the consumer in response.65
(2)	 The consumer is neither entitled to repair nor replacement (as per s. 23(3))
(3)	 The trader is in breach of the requirement to provide the repair or replacement requested 
within a reasonable time and without significant inconvenience to the consumer.
‘Price reduction’ means that the price payable is reduced by an ‘appropriate amount’ 
(or anything else the consumer is required to transfer under the contract),66 and if the 
consumer has already paid more than the reduced amount, that the excess is refunded.67 
It is possible that the price may be reduced to zero.68
60	 This is a change to the wording adopted in s. 48B(3)(c) of the Sale of Goods Act, which permitted 
a comparison also with price reduction and rescission (as the final right of reject was known as there). 
This did not seem to be permitted by the Directive and was therefore an incorrect implementation, a point 
confirmed indirectly by the CJEU in C-65/09 Weber v Wittmer and C-87/09 Putz v Medianess Electronics, 
para. [68].

finished (s. 24(6)(b)).

to allow the trader to receive only the reduced amount, then the right to price reduction is not available.

	512	 Consumer sales
If the consumer exercises the final right to reject, the trader has to provide a full 
refund. However, after more than six months from delivery (including installation), it 
is permissible for a deduction from that refund to be made to reflect the period of time 
since delivery during which the consumer was able to use the goods, except where the 
reason this time exceeds six months is because the trader failed to collect the goods at 
the agreed time.69 However, where the goods consist of a motor vehicle (or goods defined 
by order made by the Secretary of State), a deduction for use may be made at any point 
in time, including during the six months from delivery.
Delivery of Goods
The Consumer Rights Act contains a number of rules on the delivery of goods. Some 
of these are based on existing provisions in the Sale of Goods Act 1979, others are new.
Two familiar provisions are found in s. 25 and s. 26 CRA. Section 25 deals with 
circumstances where the trader has delivered the wrong quantity of goods.70 The 
consumer has the choice whether to accept a short delivery or reject this, but if he 
accepts, the goods delivered must be paid for at the contract rate.71 If there is an excess 
delivery, the consumer can accept the whole delivery, or the contract quantity (and reject 
the excess), or reject the whole delivery, but goods accepted must be paid for at the 
contract rate.72 If the consumer rejects the whole delivery and accepts none of the goods, 
then it will depend on the contract whether the consumer is entitled to treat the contract 
as at an end,73 so deciding to reject a delivery of goods of incorrect quantity does not 
automatically entitle the consumer to treat the contract as at an end.
Section 26 deals with instalment deliveries.74 There is a presumption against the 
consumer being required to accept delivery by instalments, unless trade and consumer 
have agreed to this.75 The section then lays down a number of rules where there is an 
agreement to deliver goods by instalments, each of which is to be paid for separately. 
Thus if the trader makes one or several defective deliveries, then a consumer may either 
be entitled to reject the instalment, or, in some circumstances, exercise the right to 
reject under s. 19(6) CRA in respect of the whole contract.76 Conversely, if the consumer 
neglects or refuses to accept a delivery or to pay for an instalment, the trader may in 
some instances be entitled to terminate the whole contract, but if the breach by the 
consumer is a severable breach the trader will only be entitled to damages.77
Section 28 then introduces new rules on delivery specifically with regard to sales 
contracts (but not all contracts involving the supply of goods). This provision reflects 
Article 18 of the Consumer Rights Directive (2011/83/EU). It contains a number of 
presumptions. First, each sales contract is treated as including a term that the trader

has to deliver the goods to the consumer (subject to agreement to the contrary).78 Also, 
if there is no agreement as to the time or period by which the trader has to deliver the 
goods, the contract is treated as including a term that delivery must occur without 
undue delay and no more than 30 days after the date of concluding the contract.79 If the 
consumer is to take immediate delivery of the goods, then the agreed time will be the 
time the contract is concluded.80
If the trader fails to deliver on time the consumer may, in some circumstances, treat 
the contract as at an end. This is the case when
(1)	 The trader has refused to deliver the goods.
(2)	 It is essential that the goods are delivered at the agreed time or within the agreed period, 
taking into account all the relevant circumstances of when the contract was entered into.
(3)	 The consumer told the trader that delivery by an agreed date, or within the standard  
30 day period, was essential before the contract was concluded.
In all other circumstances, the consumer has to set a period ‘appropriate in the 
circumstances’ and require the trader to deliver by the end of that period, and if the 
trader still fails to deliver by then, the consumer may treat the contract as at an end.81 
Once a contract is treated by the consumer as at an end, the trader is obliged to reimburse 
all payments made by the consumer within undue delay.82
A consumer who has ordered a number of goods may wish to keep some but cancel 
the order in respect of other goods, or reject goods already delivered – but not treat the 
whole contract as at an end. Section 28(10) CRA permits a consumer to do so, subject 
to the requirement that a consumer cannot reject only some goods forming part of a 
commercial unit.83
Passing of risk
Although the Sale of Goods Act already contained a special provision on the passing 
of risk in consumer contracts,84 a new provision was adopted in the Consumer Rights 
Act to reflect Article 20 of the Consumer Rights Directive (2011/83/EU); this also only 
applies to sales contracts. In essence, goods remain at the trader’s risk until they come 
into the physical possession of the consumer, or a person nominated by the consumer to 
take possession of the goods.85 Somewhat strangely, this is also done by treating a sales 
contract as including a term to that effect, rather than simply having this as a statutory 
rule, as was the case under s. 20(4) of the Sale of Goods Act. This seems to unnecessarily 
complicate matters.
Also, this rule does not apply where the consumer has commissioned a carrier to 
deliver the goods and that carrier is not among the options given to the consumer. In that

case, delivery of the goods to the carrier will mean that risk passes to the consumer at 
that point.86 It is important to stress that this will only be the case where the consumer 
decides to make delivery arrangements which differ from the various options a trader 
might offer. Many websites offer a range of delivery options, and these might be 
provided by different carriers. If a consumer selects a particular method from those 
offered by the trader, then the main rule that risk will not pass until the goods come into 
the consumer’s physical possession will apply.
Digital content
A major novelty in the Consumer Rights Act is the introduction of dedicated rules 
dealing with the supply of digital content. This is noteworthy for several reasons: 
first, it removes the need to develop complicated arguments about whether software/
digital content should be treated as ‘goods’, and if so, in what circumstances. That 
debate was really mainly concerned with ensuring that a buyer of unsatisfactory digital 
content would have some recourse, but the Consumer Rights Act now contains specific 
provisions dealing with quality and fitness of digital content, as well as appropriate 
remedies. Secondly, the Act is one of the first dedicated measure in the EU that seeks 
to deal specifically with the regulation of digital content, and so it might establish a 
template for future regulation at the European level – which is likely to emerge soon as 
the EU develops its Digital Agenda programme.87
‘Digital content’ is defined in general terms as ‘data which are produced and supplied 
in digital form’.88 Chapter 3 of Part 1 of the Consumer Rights Act only applies to certain 
types of contracts for the supply of digital content, which are:
(1)	 Contracts for the supply of digital content where the consumer pays a price.
(2)	 Digital content supplied free with goods or services, or other digital content for which the 
consumer pays a price.
(3)	 Digital content not generally available to a consumer unless they have paid a price for it or 
for goods or services or other digital content.89
In essence, therefore, the chapter on digital content does not apply to free digital 
content,90 such as the many applications (‘apps’) which are available free of charge, 
although the immediate challenge here is the question of whether the CRA will apply 
to apps which can be downloaded free of charge but for which a consumer can purchase 
additional features, or make so-called ‘in-app’ purchases. One would certainly expect 
that any paid-for features are subject to the rules of the Act, and if the effect of accessing 
paid-for elements is that the digital content as a whole fails to meet the statutory

of the chapter to other contracts for the supply of digital content. However, there is a threshold test that 
it must be ‘appropriate to do so because of significant detriment caused to consumers’ under the relevant 
contracts.

requirements, then the consumer’s rights under the Act should extend to the content 
that was previously free.
Requirements in respect of digital content
The provisions on digital content follow the provisions on the supply of goods as closely 
as possible, and variations only exist insofar as these are necessary because of the 
inherent differences between a supply of goods and a supply of digital content. Section 34 
stipulates that digital content must be of satisfactory quality, and s. 34 largely mirrors 
s. 9, although the list of indicative factors in s. 34(3) does not include ‘appearance 
and finish’. S. 35 deals with the requirement that goods have to be fit for a particular 
purpose and this follows the corresponding provision for goods (s. 10). The same is true 
of the requirement that digital content has to match its description in s. 36, although 
s. 36(2) refers to the consumer examining a ‘trial version’ of the digital content, rather 
than a sample. Section 37 then ensures that relevant information provided under the 
Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 
becomes a term of the contract, in the same vein as s. 12. An important provision is 
found in s. 40, which deals with digital content supplied ‘subject to the right of the 
trader or a third party to modify the digital content’. In other words, this deals with 
the frequent situation where updates are provided for digital content. Whenever digital 
content is modified, the modified version of the content must also comply with the 
various requirements of quality, fitness for purpose and description. Additional features 
may be added, but the digital content must still match its description, as well as any pre-
contractual information (unless any change to that information has been agreed with 
the consumer).
There are then a number of provisions specific to digital content. Thus, s. 39 deals 
with the supply of digital content where the consumer’s access to the content on a device 
(such as a smartphone) requires that the digital content is transmitted to that device and 
that this is arranged by the trader. Section 39(2) states that the time of supply is either 
when the content reaches the device, or, if earlier, if the content reaches another trader 
who has a contract with the consumer to supply a service by which the digital content 
reaches the device.
Sections 39(3)-(7) then deal with the situation where there is a contract to supply 
digital content, and the contract provides that once the trader has supplied that 
content, the consumer is to have access to a processing facility (arranged by the 
trader). A ‘processing facility’ is defined in s. 39(4) as ‘a facility by which [the trader] 
or another trader will receive digital content from the consumer and transmit digital 
content to the consumer (whether or not other features are to be included under the 
contract)’. Under s. 39(5), the contract is treated as including a term that this facility 
must be available to the consumer for a reasonable time or for the time specified in the 
contract.
Under s. 41, a contract is treated as including a term that the trader will have the 
right to supply the digital content at the time of supply (which adapts s.17(1), although 
note that there are no provisions in respect of digital content dealing with freedom from 
encumbrances etc.).

	516	 Consumer sales
Remedies in respect of digital content
Where digital content does not conform to the contract (which, in this context, means the 
requirements of ss. 34–36 CRA), the available rights are a right to repair or replacement, 
or the right to price reduction.91 For a breach of s. 37 (pre-contractual information), the 
remedy is to recover from the trader any costs incurred by the consumer as a result of  
the breach, up to the amount of the price paid.92 And if the trader is in breach of s. 41, 
the consumer has the right to a refund.93 As is the case in respect of contracts for the 
supply of goods, a consumer can also seek remedies provided at common law, whether 
instead of or in addition to remedies sought under the Act (subject to the proviso that 
double recovery is not allowed).94 However, in respect of a breach of the terms in s. 34-37 
and 41, there is no right for the consumer to treat the contract as at an end,95 which 
also means that there is no right of rejection of digital content. Also, the six-month 
presumption already seen in the context of the remedies for contracts to supply goods 
similarly applies if the consumer is seeking repair, replacement or price reduction. The 
detailed criteria for repair and replacement,96 price reduction,97 and refund98 mirror those 
already discussed in the context of contracts for the supply of goods.
Damage to device or other digital content
One further novelty is s. 46, which deals with the situation where the trader supplies 
digital content to the consumer under a contract and that digital content causes 
damage to a device or other digital content belonging to the consumer. If the damage is 
of a kind that would not have occurred if the trader had exercised reasonable care and 
skill, then the consumer can require the trader to provide a remedy either by repairing 
the damage, or to compensate the consumer for the damage with an appropriate 
payment. The conditions for repair are essentially the same as previously discussed. 
Section 46 also confirms that a consumer can bring an action to enforce rights under 
this section, and that the limitation period is the same as for an action based on a 
breach of contract.99
Exclusion of liability
Controls over specific terms seeking to exclude/limit liability
The adoption of the Consumer Rights Act will mean that the provisions in the Unfair 
Contract Terms Act 1977, which previously dealt with the exclusion of the implied 
terms and the associated remedies in consumer cases, will cease to have effect. For 
contracts involving the supply of goods, the relevant provision is now found in s. 31 
91	 S. 42(2) CRA.

of the Consumer Rights Act (rather than in Part 2 of the Act, which deals with unfair 
terms generally). According to s. 31(1), a contract term which would exclude or restrict 
the trader’s liability arising under ss. 9–17 and ss. 28–29 is not binding on a consumer. 
By virtue of s. 31(2), any term of a contract which would exclude or restrict a right or 
remedy in respect of liability under those sections, or make it more difficult to enforce 
such a right, will also not be binding on a consumer. The same applies in respect of a 
term which would allow a trader to put a person at a disadvantage for pursuing such a 
right or remedy, as well as a term excluding or restricting rules of evidence. The upshot 
is that the rights of a consumer under the Consumer Rights Act are mandatory and 
therefore non-excludable, and that any attempt to do so will be ineffective. In essence, 
this means that – as was already the case under UCTA – any exclusion or limitation 
clause in respect of the supply of goods is blacklisted by the Consumer Rights Act.
With regard to digital content, the same approach is taken for the trader’s liability 
arising under sections 34-37 and 41, which is non-excludable in the circumstances set out 
above.100
In contracts for the supply of goods, limitation or exclusion of liability under any 
other contract term is subject the provisions of Part II of the Consumer Rights Act 2015. 
This is also the case for any exclusion or limitation of the trader’s liability for damage 
caused by digital content to the consumer’s device or other digital content under s. 46.101
General control over contract terms
All terms in a contract between a trader and a consumer are subject to the unfair terms 
control in Part 2 of the Consumer Rights Act. This part is an amalgam (and re-working) of 
the provisions on consumer contracts previously found in the Unfair Terms in Consumer 
Contracts Regulations 1999 and the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977, and reflects proposals 
made in two Law Commission reports.102 One significant aspect of this consolidation is 
that the controls over unfair terms in the Consumer Rights Act now extend to all contract 
terms – the 1999 Regulations followed the Directive on which they are based (93/13/EEC) 
and applied only to terms which had not been individually negotiated.
There are some limitations to this though. Most significantly, s. 64(1) provides that:
A term of a consumer contract may not be assessed for fairness under section 62 to the extent 
that—
(a)	 it specifies the main subject matter of the contract, or
(b)	 the assessment is of the appropriateness of the price payable under the contract by 
comparison with the goods, digital content or services supplied under it.103
The unfairness test is based on the Directive. Section 62(4) states that a

103	 This is subject to the requirement that such a term is transparent (expressed in plain and intelligible 
language and legible (if in writing)) and prominent (brought to the consumer’s attention in such a way 
that the average consumer would be aware of the term: see s. 64(2)-(5) CRA. This might mean a different 
outcome now in a case like Office of Fair Trading v Abbey National plc [2009] UKSC 6, [2010] 1 AC 696.

	518	 Consumer sales
A term is unfair if, contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance 
in the parties’ rights and obligations under the contract to the detriment of the consumer.
In applying this test, the nature of the subject-matter of the contract needs to be taken 
into account, and reference is to be had to all the circumstances existing when the term 
was agreed and to all the other terms of the contract (or any other contract on which it 
depends).104 A term found to be unfair under this test is not binding on the consumer,105 
although the consumer can chose to rely on the term even though it is unfair.106
The application of the fairness test has given rise to case law both before the domestic 
courts and the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). A detailed discussion of 
this case law is not needed for present purposes, but a few observations are appropriate. 
In the important decision in Director-General of Fair Trading v First National Bank,107 
the House of Lords had to consider whether a term in a standard-form consumer credit 
agreement, requiring the borrower to pay interest after judgment at the contract rate, 
was fair under the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1994 (the first 
implementation of the Directive). It concluded that it was. Lord Bingham observed:
A term falling within the scope of the regulations is unfair if it causes a significant imbalance 
in the parties’ rights and obligations under the contract to the detriment of the consumer in a 
manner or to an extent which is contrary to the requirement of good faith. The requirement 
of significant imbalance is met if a term is so weighted in favour of the supplier as to tilt the 
parties’ rights and obligations under the contract significantly in his favour.108
He considered that substantive unfairness was complemented by the requirement of good 
faith, which was evidenced by fair and open dealing. Openness required that the terms should 
be expressed fully, clearly and legibly, containing no pitfalls or traps, with prominence being 
given to terms which might operate disadvantageously to the consumer. Fair dealing required 
that the supplier should not, whether deliberately or unconsciously, take advantage of the 
consumer’s necessity, indigence, lack of experience, unfamiliarity with the subject-matter of 
the contract, weak bargaining position, or any other factor listed in, or analogous to, those 
listed in Sch. 3 to the then Regulations. Although the First National case did not concern 
a sale of goods transaction and it concerned the predecessor of what is now Part 2 of the 
Consumer Rights Act, it provides useful guidance as to the way in which the application of 
fairness test is to be approached.
Further guidance may be derived from a number of rulings by the CJEU. An early ruling 
was Freiburger Kommunalbauten,109 where the CJEU made it clear that applying the 
fairness test requires that it is necessary to consider the consequences of the term under 
challenge within the context of the applicable national law, that is, how does the term 
alter the consumer’s legal rights that would otherwise be applicable? This was further 
emphasised in Banco Espanol SA v Maria Teodolinda Rivas Quichimbo,110 where it was

held that determining whether a term causes a significant imbalance to the consumer’s 
detriment necessitates that a court considers the rules of national law that would apply in 
the absence of that term and how the term alters this. It would be contrary to good faith 
if a trader, dealing fairly and equitably with a consumer, could not reasonably assume 
that the consumer would have agreed to term had it been individually negotiated.111 
Finally, in Constructora Principado SA v José Ignacio Menéndez Álvarez,112 the CJEU 
held that the ‘significant imbalance’ element did not mean that there would have to be 
a significant economic impact compared to the value of the transaction; rather, it was 
enough that there consumer’s position under national law was impaired to a sufficiently 
serious degree. This would be the case if the trader’s contract terms restricted the rights, 
or constrained their exercise, or imposed additional obligations on the consumer not 
ordinarily to be expected, or generally imposed on the trader, by national law.
In many cases, the term under challenge will be similar to a term included in the 
indicative list of unfair terms found in Schedule 2 of the Consumer Rights Act. This 
is a ‘grey list’ of unfair terms, which means that a term which corresponds with one 
of the terms in the Schedule may be regarded to be unfair, which effectively creates 
a presumption of unfairness. However, it will depend on the circumstances of the 
particular contract as to whether the term is actually unfair – it is possible that a term in 
the indicative list may nevertheless pass assessment under s. 62(4).
In addition to the fairness test, written terms of a consumer contract must be 
transparent, which means that it must be plain and intelligible, and legible.113 According 
to the CJEU, this requirement has to be understood in a broad sense and is not limited 
to considering whether a term is ‘formally and grammatically intelligible’;114 rather, a 
consumer must be able to evaluate, on the basis of clear intelligible criteria, the economic 
consequences resulting from the term.115 Moreover, if a term is ambiguous, the meaning 
which is most favourable to the consumer prevails.116
Other rules applicable to consumer sales contracts
Thus far, this chapter has focused on the provisions in the Consumer Rights Act 2015 as 
they pertain to contracts for the sale and supply of goods. It is necessary to mention a 
number of other measures of consumer law which are of some relevance to consumer sales 
contracts, although these provisions are of wider application. Of particular relevance 
here are the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) 
Regulations 2013,117 which, together with the Consumer Rights (Payment Surcharges) 
Regulations 2012118 give effect to the requirements of the Consumer Rights Directive 
(2011/83/EU), a measure already mentioned several times above. The Consumer Rights 
Directive was the end product of a lengthy and initially much more ambitious reform 
111	 The Directive does not apply to individually negotiated terms, unlike Part 2 of the Consumer Rights Act.

process at the European level, which at one point would also have resulted in significant 
reforms to the Consumer Sales Directive. The overarching objective of this process was 
to replace the so-called minimum harmonisation approach (under which directives are 
used to establish a regulatory floor below which EU Member States must not drop, but 
which they may exceed by maintaining higher levels of consumer protection) with a full, 
or maximum, harmonisation approach, which would have left very little freedom to 
individual EU Member States to deviate from the EU standard. This met considerable 
political resistance and so the Consumer Rights Directive primarily focuses on the full 
harmonisation of pre-contractual information duties and the right of withdrawal in off-
premises and distance sales.
Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional 
Charges) Regulations 2013
As noted, the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) 
Regulations 2013 (‘CCR’) primarily deal with pre-contractual information duties and 
the right of cancellation in off-premises and distance contracts. An off-premise contract 
is defined as
a contract between a trader and a consumer which is any of these—
(a)	 a contract concluded in the simultaneous physical presence of the trader and the 
consumer, in a place which is not the business premises of the trader;
(b)	 a contract for which an offer was made by the consumer in the simultaneous phys-
ical presence of the trader and the consumer, in a place which is not the business 
premises of the trader;
(c)	 a contract concluded on the business premises of the trader or through any means of 
distance communication immediately after the consumer was personally and indi-
vidually addressed in a place which is not the business premises of the trader in the 
simultaneous physical presence of the trader and the consumer;
(d)	 a contract concluded during an excursion organised by the trader with the aim or 
effect of promoting and selling goods or services to the consumer.119
And a distance contract is
a contract concluded between a trader and a consumer under an organised distance sales or 
service-provision scheme without the simultaneous physical presence of the trader and the 
consumer, with the exclusive use of one or more means of distance communication up to and 
including the time at which the contract is concluded120
Most of the CCR deal with rules on either off-premises or distance contracts, although 
there are a few provisions on on-premises contracts (i.e. contracts which are neither off-
premises or distance contracts). There are various types of contract which are excluded 
from the scope of the CCR,121 but as the present focus is on contracts for the sale and 
supply of goods only (rather than a full account of the CCR), it is not necessary to 
consider these exclusions here.

Pre-contractual information in on-premises contracts
Although much of the CCR are concerned with off-premises and distance contracts, 
there is a limited requirement to provide information before an on-premises contract is 
concluded. This obligation does not arise in respect of day-to-day transactions which 
are performed immediately at the time the contract is entered into.122 Reg. 9(1) requires 
that prior to the conclusion of an on-premises contract the trader must give or make 
available to the consumer a number of items of information insofar as this information 
is not already apparent from the context. Any information thus given is treated as a term 
of the contract,123 and any change of that information is not effective unless expressly 
agreed between consumer and trader. The information to be given is:
(a)	 the main characteristics of the goods or services, to the extent appropriate to the medium 
of communication and to the goods or services;
(b)	 the identity of the trader (such as the trader’s trading name), the geographical address at 
which the trader is established and the trader’s telephone number;
(c)	 the total price of the goods or services inclusive of taxes, or where the nature of the goods 
or services is such that the price cannot reasonably be calculated in advance, the manner in 
which the price is to be calculated;
(d)	 where applicable, all additional delivery charges or, where those charges cannot reasonably 
be calculated in advance, the fact that such additional charges may be payable;
(e)	 where applicable, the arrangements for payment, delivery, performance, and the time by 
which the trader undertakes to deliver the goods or to perform the service;
(f)	 where applicable, the trader’s complaint handling policy;
(g)	 in the case of a sales contract, a reminder that the trader is under a legal duty to supply 
goods that are in conformity with the contract;
(h)	 where applicable, the existence and the conditions of after-sales services and commercial 
guarantees;
(i)	 the duration of the contract, where applicable, or, if the contract is of indeterminate dura-
tion or is to be extended automatically, the conditions for terminating the contract;
(j)	 where applicable, the functionality, including applicable technical protection measures, of 
digital content;
(k)	 where applicable, any relevant compatibility of digital content with hardware and soft-
ware that the trader is aware of or can reasonably be expected to have been aware of.
As can be seen, some of this information is particularly relevant to sales contracts  
((a)-(e), and (g)-(h)), or contracts for the supply of digital content ((j)-(k)).
Pre-contractual information for distance/off-premises contracts
A similar approach to the provision of pre-contractual information is taken in respect of 
off-premises124 and distance125 contracts, although here the list of items of information a 
trader might have to supply is considerably longer. Again, this information is treated as 
included as terms of the contract. The items of information are:

(a)	 the main characteristics of the goods or services, to the extent appropriate to the medium 
of communication and to the goods or services;
(b)	 the identity of the trader (such as the trader’s trading name);
(c)	 the geographical address at which the trader is established and, where available, the trader’s 
telephone number, fax number and e-mail address, to enable the consumer to contact the 
trader quickly and communicate efficiently;
(d)	 where the trader is acting on behalf of another trader, the geographical address and iden-
tity of that other trader;
(e)	 if different from the address provided in accordance with paragraph (c), the geograph-
ical address of the place of business of the trader, and, where the trader acts on behalf 
of another trader, the geographical address of the place of business of that other trader, 
where the consumer can address any complaints;
(f)	 the total price of the goods or services inclusive of taxes, or where the nature of the goods 
or services is such that the price cannot reasonably be calculated in advance, the manner in 
which the price is to be calculated,
(g)	 where applicable, all additional delivery charges and any other costs or, where those 
charges cannot reasonably be calculated in advance, the fact that such additional charges 
may be payable;
(h)	 in the case of a contract of indeterminate duration or a contract containing a subscription, 
the total costs per billing period or (where such contracts are charged at a fixed rate) the 
total monthly costs;
(i)	 the cost of using the means of distance communication for the conclusion of the contract 
where that cost is calculated other than at the basic rate;
(j)	 the arrangements for payment, delivery, performance, and the time by which the trader 
undertakes to deliver the goods or to perform the services;
(k)	 where applicable, the trader’s complaint handling policy;
(l)	 where a right to cancel exists, the conditions, time limit and procedures for exercising that 
right in accordance with regulations 27 to 38;
(m)	 where applicable, that the consumer will have to bear the cost of returning the goods in 
case of cancellation and, for distance contracts, if the goods, by their nature, cannot nor-
mally be returned by post, the cost of returning the goods;
(n)	 that, if the consumer exercises the right to cancel after having made a request in accord-
ance with regulation 36(1), the consumer is to be liable to pay the trader reasonable costs 
in accordance with regulation 36(4);
(o)	 where under regulation 28, 36 or 37 there is no right to cancel or the right to cancel may 
be lost, the information that the consumer will not benefit from a right to cancel, or the 
circumstances under which the consumer loses the right to cancel;
(p)	 in the case of a sales contract, a reminder that the trader is under a legal duty to supply 
goods that are in conformity with the contract;
(q)	 where applicable, the existence and the conditions of after-sale customer assistance, after-
sales services and commercial guarantees;
(r)	 the existence of relevant codes of conduct, as defined in regulation 5(3)(b) of the Con-
sumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008, and how copies of them can be 
obtained, where applicable;
(s)	 the duration of the contract, where applicable, or, if the contract is of indeterminate dura-
tion or is to be extended automatically, the conditions for terminating the contract;
(t)	 where applicable, the minimum duration of the consumer’s obligations under the contract;
(u)	 where applicable, the existence and the conditions of deposits or other financial guaran-
tees to be paid or provided by the consumer at the request of the trader;
(v)	 where applicable, the functionality, including applicable technical protection measures, of 
digital content;

	
	 	
Consumer sales contracts	 523
(w)	 where applicable, any relevant compatibility of digital content with hardware and software 
that the trader is aware of or can reasonably be expected to have been aware of;
(x)	 where applicable, the possibility of having recourse to an out-of-court complaint and 
redress mechanism, to which the trader is subject, and the methods for having access to it.
Note: In the case of a public auction, the information listed in paragraphs (b) to (e) may be 
replaced with the equivalent details for the auctioneer.
For off-premises contracts, this information must be given on paper or another durable 
medium (if the consumer agrees), and it must be legible.126 A trader who fails to give the 
information required by (g), (h) or (m) above cannot impose those costs or charges on the 
consumer.127 Also, for paragraphs (l), (m) and (n), a template is provided in Schedule 3 to 
the CCR. In addition, Reg. 12 CCR requires that the trader gives the consumer either a 
copy of the signed contract, or a confirmation of the contract, which has to include all 
the relevant information (if not already provided on a durable medium before conclusion 
of the contract), and must either be on paper or on another durable medium.128
In a distance contract, this information has to be given in way appropriate to the 
medium of distance communication used. If such a means of communications only 
allows limited space or time to display the information then as a minimum, items (a), 
(b), (f), (g), (h), (l) and (s) have to be given, with the remainder provided in another 
appropriate way. The same rules in respect of charges and costs, and information about 
cancellation rights mentioned above, also apply to distance contracts.129 Moreover, the 
trader must provide the consumer with a confirmation of the contract, which includes 
all the required information on a durable medium no later than the time of delivery of 
the goods.130
There are special requirements for distance contracts concluded by electronic means 
(e.g. on-line via a website), if the contract places the consumer under an obligation to 
pay (which would seem to be the case with most consumer contracts). Immediately 
before placing an order, the consumer has to be made aware of items (a), (f), (g), (h), (s) 
and (t) in a clear and prominent manner.
When placing the order, the consumer must explicitly acknowledge that this implies 
an obligation to pay, and where placing the order involves clicking on an online button, 
this has to be labelled such as to make it clear that the consumer will be under an 
obligation to pay. If the trader does not comply with this the consumer is not bound by 
the contract.131
Even from this brief overview, it can be seen clearly that the requirement for a trader 
to provide information to a consumer before a contract is concluded has become a very 
detailed and technical (some might say overly technical) process. Whether this really 
benefits consumers continues to be a matter of some controversy.

Right of cancellation in off-premises and distance contracts
A second major feature of the CCR is the provision of a right of cancellation in respect 
of distance and off-premises contracts. However, this right is not available in respect of all 
contracts. Among the contracts for which this right is not available are contracts for:132 
• the supply of goods for which the price is dependent on fluctuations in the financial mar-
ket which cannot be controlled by the trader and which may occur within the cancellation 
period; 
• the supply of goods that are made to the consumer’s specifications or are clearly 
personalised;
• the supply of goods which are liable to deteriorate or expire rapidly;
• the supply of alcoholic beverages, where—
	(i)	 their price has been agreed at the time of the conclusion of the sales contract,
	(ii)	 delivery of them can only take place after 30 days, and
	(iii)	 their value is dependent on fluctuations in the market which cannot be controlled by the 
trader;
• concluded at a public auction.
In addition, even where a right to cancel is available, this is lost where,
(a)	 in the case of a contract for the supply of sealed goods which are not suitable for return 
due to health protection or hygiene reasons, if they become unsealed after delivery;
(b)	 in the case of a contract for the supply of sealed audio or sealed video recordings or sealed 
computer software, if the goods become unsealed after delivery;
(c)	 in the case of any sales contract, if the goods become mixed inseparably (according to 
their nature) with other items after delivery.133
The general right to cancel a distance or off-premises contracts is provided in Reg. 29(1) 
CCR. The consumer can exercise this right at any time during the cancellation period 
and does not have to give any reason. The right to cancel a contract therefore does not 
depend on there being a fault with the goods acquired – the consumer is free simply to

The cancellation period lasts for 14 days,135 but it is calculated differently depending 
on the type of contract. Thus, for a contract for the supply of digital content, the period 
ends 14 days after the day on which the contract was entered into.136 For a contract for 
the sale of goods it will be 14 days after the day on which the goods were delivered,137 
with special provision for goods comprising multiple orders (14 days from the date on 
which the last item was delivered),138 orders consisting of multiple lots or pieces delivered 
on different days (also 14 days from the date on which the last item was delivered),139 and

134	 It is important to appreciate that this right only exists for off-premises and distance contracts, but not for 
on-premises contracts (contrary to what some consumers think to be the case). Often, stores will operate a 
voluntary no-quibble returns policy, but these are not a legal requirement.

orders where goods are delivered regularly on a recurring basis (14 days from the date on 
which the first item was delivered).140
In order to exercise the right to cancel, the consumer must notify the trader,141 which 
can be done by completing a model cancellation form or any other clear statement to 
the same effect. The trader may also make available an online cancellation form on the 
trader’s website, which the consumer can use, but is not required to use.142
Following cancellation the obligations of the parties to perform the contract is 
brought to an end.143 The trader is required to reimburse all payments made by the 
consumer,144 and has to do so within 14 days.145 However, with regard to delivery charges, 
the trader only has to reimburse the equivalent of the least expensive method offered by 
the trader,146 so if the consumer chooses a more expensive method (e.g. next-day courier 
delivery), the consumer cannot recover the additional cost of this delivery service. 
Also, if the consumer has handled the goods ‘beyond what is necessary to establish the 
nature, characteristics and functioning of the goods’,147 which has resulted in the value 
of the goods diminishing, then the trader is entitled to make a deduction from the sums 
he would otherwise be required to refund. So if a consumer has bought clothing and 
instead of just trying it on at home to see if it fits, wears it on a night out during which it 
is stained by food, the consumer will not be entitled to a full refund.
As far as returning the goods is concerned, Regulation 35 contains a number of rules. 
It is the trader’s responsibility to collect them where he has offered to do so, or where, 
under an off-premises contract, goods were delivered to the consumer’s home but they 
cannot be returned by post due to the nature of the goods (e.g., bulky or heavy items). 
Otherwise, the consumer may be required to send back the goods to the trader, or hand 
them over to the trader (or a person authorised by the trader). The consumer is required 
to bear the costs associated with returning the goods, unless the trader has agreed to do 
so, or the trader has failed to inform the consumer that the consumer has to bear those 
costs (cf. item (m), above).
In the case of digital content, the general position under Reg. 37 CCR is that the trader 
should not supply digital content until the end of the cancellation period. However, if the 
consumer expressly consents to supply before then and acknowledges that this will mean the 
right of cancellation is lost, then the trader can supply the digital content sooner.
Other rights
Although the CCR primarily deal with pre-contractual information and the right of 
cancellation, the Consumer Rights Directive (2011/83/EU) also introduced several other 
rights relevant to consumer sales contracts. Thus, it is made clear that any additional

payments which may be payable in addition to the price for the main obligation need 
to be expressly consented to by the consumer, and the use of pre-selected options  
(e.g. ‘pre-ticked boxes’ on a website) is no longer permitted.148 So, for example, it would 
no longer be permitted to pre-select an extended warranty for goods purchased on-line 
and to require the consumer to deselect that option. Any additional charges to which the 
consumer has not expressly consented but which have been paid must be refunded.149 
Somewhat strangely, this is done by treating the contract as including a term to that 
effect, with the consequence that not refunding such charges would be a breach of that 
term. This might impose the onus on the consumer to act swiftly so as to avoid the risk 
of having waived the right to receive a refund by delaying steps to enforce that term.
A further provision deals with ‘helpline charges’, and requires a trader to charge no 
more than the basic call rate for telephone calls to contact the trader.150
Finally, the Consumer Rights Directive (2011/83/EU) also provides that a consumer 
who uses a certain payment type, such as a credit card or debit card, cannot be charged 
a fee for using this payment method which exceeds the cost to the trader of the 
consumer choosing to use a particular payment method.151 In the UK, the particular 
context where this issue was of concern were certain low-cost airlines, who used high 
‘administration fees’ whenever a consumer opted to pay by card, and so this particular 
provision was given effect to in UK law ahead of the rest of the Consumer Rights 
Directive.152
Consumer protection from unfair trading
Prior to the changes which resulted in the Consumer Rights Act 2015 and the Consumer 
Contracts Regulations 2013, consumer law had already been significantly overhauled 
by the introduction of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 
(‘CPUTR’).153 These regulations implement the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive 
(2005/29/EU; ‘UCPD’) and establish a broad framework within which to control the 
manner in which traders deal with consumers both before a contract is made as well 
as during its performance and beyond. The CPUTR are not limited to consumer sales 
contracts, but deal with most transactions consumers might enter into. Until 2014, 
the CPUTR were only enforced by public bodies (both local Weights and Measures 
Authorities (often known as Trading Standards Departments) and the Office of Fair 
Trading (as was – now the Competition and Markets Authority), and the enforcement 
tools ranged from undertakings, to injunctions to prohibit specific violations of the 
CPUTR, to enforcement by means of criminal penalties. A detailed discussion of all 
this is beyond the scope of this book. However, in 2014 the CPUTR were amended to 
provide consumers with a private right of redress in respect of certain infringements of 
the regulations, so a brief explanation of this development is appropriate here.

Consumer sales contracts	 527
Regulating commercial practices
The CPUTR deal with ‘commercial practices’, which are defined as ‘any act, omission, 
course of conduct, representation or commercial communication (including advertising 
and marketing) by a trader, which is directly connected with the promotion, sale or 
supply of a product to or from consumers, whether occurring before, during or after a 
commercial transaction (if any) in relation to a product’.154 It is clear from this definition 
that it is a very wide-ranging concept, and effectively almost anything a trader does vis-
à-vis a consumer is caught by this definition. In many cases, the focus will be on how 
goods or services (‘products’) are marketed to consumers, and it is not necessary that a 
consumer enters into a contract for the regulations to apply.
Regulation 3(1) states in clear terms that ‘unfair commercial practices are prohibited’, 
and the remainder of Reg. 3 goes on to set out the general test for establishing whether 
a commercial practice is unfair. However, that test itself is not going to be deployed too 
frequently, as in addition to this general prohibition there are more detailed prohibitions 
of misleading actions, misleading omissions, and aggressive commercial practices.155 
A particular commercial practice can thus be assessed for its fairness both under these 
specific provisions and the general test, although in most cases the unfairness will be 
the result of a consumer either being misled or having been subject to pressure selling 
(aggressive commercial practice). However, it is also recognised that some types of 
behaviour should be prohibited outright, and so Schedule 1 to the CPUTR contains 
a list of commercial practices which are always regarded as unfair (thereby creating  
de facto prohibitions).
Private Redress
As noted, the CPUTR did not grant individual consumers new rights when they were 
first enacted, not least because this was not required by the UCPD. However, the Law 
Commissions were asked to consider whether it would be appropriate to give individual 
consumers a private right of redress,156 and its recommendations were enacted through 
the Consumer Protection (Amendment) Regulations 2014.157 The effect of these changes 
is to make available a private right of redress in a narrow range of circumstances, and 
the following three conditions must be met:158
(1)	 It applies to three situations: (i) a contract with a trader for the sale or supply to the consumer 
of a product, (ii) a contract with a trader under which the consumer sells goods to the trader; 
or (iii) where the consumer makes a payment to a trader for the supply of a product.
(2)	 The trader engages in a misleading action (under Regulation 5) or an aggressive practice 
(under Regulation 7).
(3)	 The misleading action or aggressive practice must have been a significant factor in the 
consumer’s decision to enter into the contract.

158	 See new Reg. 27A CPUTR.

	528	 Consumer sales
So, importantly, the misleading action or aggressive commercial practice must cause the 
consumer to enter into a contract – it would not seem to apply where such matters occur 
during the performance of the contract, or when trying to terminate it.
A consumer will have ‘right to unwind’ the contract (which right lasts for 90 days if 
the contract falls within situation (i),159 and without restriction in situation (ii)),160 which 
means that the contract is brought to an end. A consumer who has made a payment 
(situation (iii)) which the consumer was not required to make (in part or full) then the 
consumer is entitled to receive a refund of that payment.161
A consumer who does not exercise the right to unwind can instead claim the right to a 
discount162 on any sums paid (or which are payable). The discount is measured based on 
the seriousness of the prohibited practice as follows:163
(a)	 if the prohibited practice is more than minor, it is 25%,
(b)	 if the prohibited practice is significant, it is 50%,
(c)	 if the prohibited practice is serious, it is 75%, and
(d)	 if the prohibited practice is very serious, it is 100%.
In order to establish this seriousness, it is necessary to consider the behaviour of the 
person engaging in the practice, its impact on the consumer and how much time has 
passed since it took place (although note the derogation in Reg. 27I(6)/(7)).
Finally, a consumer has a right to claim damages under Reg. 27J if the consumer:
(a)	 has incurred financial loss which the consumer would not have incurred if the prohibited 
practice in question had not taken place, or
(b)	 has suffered alarm, distress or physical inconvenience or discomfort which the consumer 
would not have suffered if the prohibited practice in question had not taken place.
Damages are to cover that loss or the alarm, distress or physical inconvenience or 
discomfort in question.
Whether these rights will be exercised in practice remains to be seen – the scheme in 
these new provisions seems rather complicated, and will almost certainly require the 
assistance of a court to apply sensibly (particularly with regard to the right to claim a 
discount and any damages claims). It must also be noted that following these changes, 
a consumer will no longer have the right to claim damages for misrepresentation under  
s. 2 of the Misrepresentation Act 1967 (in England & Wales)164 or s. 10 of the Law 
Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1985 (in Scotland).
Additional protection under s. 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974
For many consumer sales contracts, a credit card is the main method of payment 
(whether over the internet or instore). For UK buyers this leads to a useful source of

Consumer sales contracts	 529
redress against the credit card company where the goods supplied are defective. The key 
provision is s. 75(1). This provides:
If the debtor under a debtor-creditor-supplier agreement falling within section 12(b) or (c) has, 
in relation to a transaction financed by the agreement, any claim against the supplier in respect 
of a misrepresentation or breach of contract, he shall have a like claim against the creditor, 
who, with the supplier, shall accordingly be jointly and severally liable to the debtor.
Section 75(3) provides:
Subsection (1) above does not apply to a claim –
(a)	 under a non-commercial agreement, or
(b)	 so far as the claim relates to any single item to which the supplier has attached a 
cash price not exceeding [£100] or more than [£30,000].
The upper limit was included because it was felt that purchasers of goods as costly as 
this did not need the protection of this section. The reason for inserting the lower of 
these limits was to exclude common cases where the card is simply used as a substitute 
for cash. Unfortunately, the effect of this is to exclude from s. 75 transactions for goods 
costing less than £100.
Sections 12(b) and (c) respectively define ‘debtor-creditor-supplier agreements’ which 
are ‘restricted’ and ‘unrestricted-use’ credit agreements. The exact details of these 
definitions do not concern us here. The key to them is the definition of ‘consumer credit 
agreement’. Under s. 8(2) this is:
… a personal credit agreement by which the creditor provides the debtor with credit not 
exceeding [£25,000].165
Since almost all transactions involving consumers will fall within the upper financial 
limit, provided the lower financial limit is exceeded, most potentially fall within s. 75(1). 
Where the seller is within the UK or outside the UK but within another member state 
of the EEA, the consumer will have the remedies against the seller set out above and in 
other sections of this book cross-referred to, and, in consequence, will potentially have 
a remedy against the credit card company under s. 75(1).166 However, two restrictions on 
this need to be noted. First of all, some cards which in popular parlance are referred to as 
credit cards are not credit cards for the purposes of the Act. Whilst Visa and MasterCard 
offer the option of paying off the monthly debt in full, or partially, and are therefore true 
credit cards, American Express and Diners Club do not offer this option and require 
the monthly debt to be paid off in full. Therefore, they are not credit cards within  
the meaning of the Act, and are not, therefore, subject to s. 75. On the other hand, the 
credit limits imposed by both Visa and MasterCard on individual cardholders mean that 
almost all agreements with these companies will be ‘personal credit agreements’ within 
the meaning of the Act.
165	 As amended by SI 1998/996. As noted above, s. 75(3)(a) further limits its application by requiring the value 
of the goods to exceed £100 and not to exceed £30,000.

Moreover, debit cards are also not covered by the s. 75 scheme. However, in the 
internal arrangements between card issuers (banks) and debit card scheme operators, 
there is a facility known as ‘charge-back’, which effectively allows the issuer of a debit 
card who has refunded a consumer in circumstances similar to s. 75 to reclaim this 
through the contractual arrangements within the debit-card system. In many cases, this 
will provide consumers with protection comparable to that offered by s. 75, although 
this system is not a legal requirement and so this protection is not on particularly solid 
foundations.167

Insolvency, Consultation Paper 221 (2015), ch.5.

Product liability
The previous chapter considered the extensive changes made to the consumer law landscape 
since the 12th edition of this book was published. This chapter concentrates on an aspect of 
consumer protection which was in place before the recent reforms, and considers primarily 
the legal obligations a manufacturer of goods may have towards consumers.
Product liability at common law
In a claim by a buyer based on breach of the statutory requirements regarding quality and 
fitness of goods, it is unnecessary, as a rule, to distinguish between a claim for damages 
arising from defects in the goods themselves, and a claim for damages for damage caused 
by the goods; for example, personal injury caused by a dangerous electrical product or a 
defective car. In this chapter, however, we are concerned with possible complaints in respect 
of defective goods, arising outside the contract, which may be made against third parties (e.g. 
manufacturers) or which may be brought by third parties (e.g. non-buyer users of the goods). 
In dealing with claims of this nature, it is necessary to distinguish between claims in respect 
of damage caused by the goods, and claims in respect of defects in the goods themselves.  
In this and the next sections we are concerned with claims in respect of damage caused by 
the goods.
We have seen that, in general, a seller who is sued under s. 14(2) or (3) of the Sale of Goods 
Act or s. 9 or s. 10 of the Consumer Rights Act is liable irrespective of all due care and skill on 
the part of the seller, and we have also referred to many cases which illustrate that the seller’s 
strict liability extends to consequential loss caused by the defective goods and is not limited 
to losses arising under the contract itself. Thus, if the buyer suffers personal injury through 
use of defective goods, he can claim damages from the seller under statutory provisions, 
despite the fact that the seller has not been guilty of any negligence. In this respect, the buyer 
is in a privileged position compared to most persons who suffer personal injury. Normally, 
claims for damages for personal injury must be made in tort or delict and, generally speaking 
of course, such claims require proof of negligence on the part of the defendant.
Privity of contract: liability confined to the seller
But it will also be seen that the doctrine of privity of contract imposes serious limitations 
on this form of liability1 – now generally called ‘product liability’.2 The buyer’s remedy is 
	1	 As to the effect of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 on this doctrine, see p. 213 et seq.
	2	 This book follows the Consumer Protection Act 1987 in referring to ‘product liability’ in preference to 
‘products liability’, the term usually used in America, and, until now, also here.

	532	 Consumer sales
only available against the actual seller. If the buyer wishes to sue the manufacturer he cannot 
prima facie invoke the strict liability involved in a breach of condition or warranty,3 unless 
the manufacturer is also the immediate seller of the goods to the consumer. At common law, 
his principal possible sources of remedies against a manufacturer lay in negligence, showing 
breach of a collateral contract, or through third party proceedings.4 However, alongside the 
common law position, Part I of the Consumer Protection Act 1987 deals with the liability 
of a producer for defective products resulting in injury or damage. Because the 1987 Act 
provides remedies in addition to, rather than in substitution of, those previously available, it 
is still appropriate to consider the position at common law.
Negligence or delict
In the famous case of Donoghue v Stevenson,5 it was held that the pursuer, who had 
consumed part of the contents of a bottle of ginger beer which allegedly contained the 
remains of a decomposing snail, and who as a result suffered physical illness, might sue 
the manufacturer of the ginger beer, notwithstanding that the bottle had been bought 
for her at a café by a friend. It is beyond the scope of a work of this nature to deal in 
detail with the complexities of the tort or delict of negligence; however, its principal 
problems from the claimant’s point of view must be noted.
In the first place, the claimant must establish negligence on the part of the 
manufacturer. The fact that it can be shown that a defect in the product was the cause of 
the injury will suffice to throw the onus onto the manufacturer to show that he exercised 
proper care, but he may be able to discharge that onus. In Daniels v R W White & Sons 
and Tabard,6 the plaintiff’s husband bought a bottle of lemonade manufactured by the 
first defendant from the second defendant’s shop. The lemonade contained carbolic 
acid, and both were injured when they consumed some of it. The husband was able to 
recover against the shopkeeper for breach of the old merchantable quality warranty, but 
the wife’s remedy depended on proof of negligence on the part of the manufacturer, and 
it was held that the manufacturer had exercised reasonable care and accordingly was not 
liable in negligence.
The second limitation of the tort of negligence or delict is that in general it permits 
recovery only in respect of physical damage, not economic loss. The buyer of goods may 
have a claim in tort or delict for economic loss against the manufacturer for the defects 
in the goods themselves where there is some real proximity between the buyer and the 
manufacturer, but, for the reasons explained below, even this is now doubtful. If the 
manufacturer, for instance, gives advice or information to the owner, it is possible that  
the owner may be able to establish liability under the Hedley Byrne7 principle. And this 
also explains why, even on the restrictive view of the law adopted by the Canadian Supreme 
	3	 It would appear that the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 is not intended to alter this.
	4	 And this was generally so even in a system which, like Scots law, recognises the enforceability of benefits 
arising under contracts for third parties (jus quaesitum tertio) if the contracting parties so intended.

contract between others) rather than negligence in delict, see McBryde, 2012 SLT (News) 45.

Product liability	 533
Court, and approved by the House of Lords in D & F Estates v Church Commissioners,8 
the plaintiffs succeeded in part in Rivtow Marine v Washington Iron Works.9 If it is once 
held that a manufacturer of a product owes a duty to warn owners of any design defects 
that come to his attention after it has been put into circulation, it may be possible to claim 
damages on the basis, as in the latter case, that the warning was unreasonably delayed and 
thereby increased the damage. In the unreported case of Walton v British Leyland,10 the rear 
wheel of a car manufactured by the defendants came off whilst the car was being driven, 
causing injury to the plaintiff. The cause of the accident was faulty design. The defendants 
had become aware of the problem because numerous incidents had been reported. They had 
failed, however, to mount a major recall campaign in case it damaged their sales. It was held 
that the defendants were liable in negligence for selling cars with a design fault, but it was 
also said obiter that the failure to recall itself amounted to negligence. A failure to warn can 
also itself amount to negligence.11
One case where a sufficient degree of proximity was established was The Diamentis 
Pateras,12 where the defendants were manufacturers of ships’ furnaces which were installed 
in the plaintiffs’ ship. Defects in the furnaces led to their cracking and replacement at 
high cost, and Lawrence J would have been prepared to hold that the defendants owed 
a duty of care in these circumstances, but negligence was not established. It is, however, 
not clear whether the duty arose out of the advice given by the defendants or perhaps out 
of the need to replace the boilers to avoid danger.
Beyond this point, it is not possible to go very far. For some years, it seemed that the 
decision of the House of Lords in Junior Books Ltd v Veitchi Co Ltd,13 which followed Anns  
v Merton London Borough Council,14 might have heralded a willingness to see a great 
expansion in the law on this point. In that case, the House upheld a claim for damages by 
the owner of a building against a subcontractor who had laid a floor so negligently that 
the work had to be redone. The owner had no direct contractual relationship with the 
subcontractor so the action had to be an action in delict (tort); furthermore, there was 
no suggestion that it was necessary to relay the floor in order to avoid danger to persons 
using the building. The claim thus seems to have been a claim to pure economic loss, and 
yet it was allowed, Lord Brandon dissenting. But there is little point in discussing the case 
at any length because it has, in effect, been repudiated by the House of Lords in the D & 
F Estates case, and in Murphy v Brentwood Council,15 where Lord Brandon’s speech was 
largely endorsed. The case must now be interpreted as a case, on its own facts, where 
a high degree of proximity existed between the parties so as to justify the imposition 
of a duty of care. The owners, or their architects, had nominated the subcontractors, 
and thus the relationship between the parties, as the majority held, fell just short of a

13	 [1983] 1 AC 520, 1982 SC (HL) 244. It is not clear from the Report why the pursuer chose to sue the 
subcontractor rather than the main contractor, but it appears that the reason for this course was that, before 
the defects in the floor became apparent, the owner had settled a large number of other claims against the 
main contractor in such terms as precluded all further action against him.

contractual relationship. It can be argued, therefore, that the case is really an application 
of the proximity principle established in Hedley Byrne & Co v Heller & Partners 
Ltd.16 It is clear that a similar result will not be reached in future on such facts unless 
the relationship between the client and the subcontractor differs substantially from the 
ordinary commercial relationship between such parties.
Certainly, there is now fairly general agreement that the mere fact that a manufacturer 
has made a defective product which may cause economic loss to a buyer does not, by 
itself, render the manufacturer liable unless there is a close degree of proximity between 
the parties. Even in Junior Books this does not seem to have been seriously doubted. But 
precisely what will be needed to establish the requisite degree of ‘proximity’ remains in 
some doubt. If contract and tort/delict liability are getting closer in this area, as seems to 
be the case, it may well be, indeed, that proximity will only be found when the facts are 
sufficient to establish a collateral contract, or at least come very close to doing so. At the 
very least, it seems certain that some direct contact between the buyer (or his agent) and 
the manufacturer will be necessary, and mere reliance on the manufacturer’s reputation, 
or perhaps even on his promotional literature, will probably not by itself suffice.17
The reason for this refusal of the courts to impose direct manufacturer liability for 
defective products is that, as was suggested by Lord Fraser in the Junior Books case, 
there appears to be no way of judging what is the appropriate standard to which the 
goods have to be made except by invoking a contract. Goods may be of high quality or 
of low quality, but a manufacturer can hardly be guilty of negligence just because he 
makes low-quality goods. Thus, Lord Fraser said:18
A manufacturer’s duty to take care not to make a product that is dangerous sets a standard 
which is, in principle, easy to ascertain. The duty is owed to all who are his ‘neighbours’. It is 
imposed on him by the general law and is in addition to his contractual duties to other parties 
to the contract. But a duty not to produce a defective article sets a standard which is less easily 
ascertained, because it has to be judged largely by reference to the contract.
This is no doubt a good reason for not placing liability on a manufacturer for making a 
product to a low-quality standard which is intended to be sold as such. But it is far from 
clear why this is an adequate reason for not imposing liability on a manufacturer for 
making a product which is not of satisfactory quality when the product was originally 
sold as being of satisfactory quality.19 But, once again, the search for reasoned argument 
in this difficult area of the law does not seem to have been carried very far. Perhaps 
the best reason which can be suggested for the present law is that, leaving aside the 
possibility of a producer’s liability on a consumer guarantee,20 it is simply easier and 
less costly if buyers look to their sellers for redress for defective goods. If purchase and 
sale contracts in the marketplace are entered into with the appropriate degree of care

19	 In the USA, starting with Greenman v Yuba Power Products Inc 377 P 2d 897 (Cal 1962), a doctrine of 
strict liability in tort applies where a person has been injured by a defective product. This line of cases is 
summarised in 402A Restatement 2d. In most jurisdictions this liability does not extend to economic losses, 
including damage to the product itself.

and foresight by all parties, there should be less need for buyers to look to third parties 
for redress. This is doubtless a reasonable argument when commercial contracts are in 
question;21 it is perhaps less convincing when consumers are under consideration. At all 
events, in many cases the Consumer Protection Act 1987 will provide consumers with a 
remedy against, inter alia, a manufacturer. This is dealt with below.
Collateral contracts
One common law expedient whereby a buyer may be able to hold a manufacturer strictly 
liable despite the apparent absence of privity is the collateral contract. For instance, 
in Wells v Buckland Sand22 the plaintiff bought sand for growing chrysanthemums 
in reliance on an express assurance that the sand was suitable for this purpose. This 
assurance was not given by the seller but by the manufacturer. It was held that there 
was a collateral contract, and the buyer was entitled to damages when the sand proved 
unsuitable and the buyer suffered loss. This was a case in which a specific and personal 
assurance was given to the buyer by the manufacturer. What is not clear is whether such a 
claim could be based on statements made in a manufacturer’s advertisement. Apart from 
the famous case of Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co,23 there are hardly any illustrations 
of this possibility in English law. But in America, it has been held that a person who buys 
a car in reliance on an advertisement that it has ‘shatterproof’ windscreens can sue the 
manufacturers for breach of warranty if the windscreen is not in fact shatterproof.24
But in one English case on this subject, the Court of Appeal declined to hold that 
statements made by a manufacturer in his brochures could be construed as collateral 
warranties, on the ground that they were not ‘intended’ to create contractual liability.25 
This is open to criticism because manufacturers issue their promotional literature plainly 
intending to influence buyers, and it would seem perfectly reasonable to hold that simple 
statements of fact relied upon by buyers should be held to create collateral contracts. Of 
course, in the case of consumer sales public statements about the specific characteristics 
of the goods can give rise to liability under the Consumer Rights Act 2015, s. 9. ‘Puffs’ 
and other vague advertising language are a different matter, but simple statements of fact 
ought to be held to create collateral contracts, when calculated to be relied on and in fact 
relied upon.26
This possible liability is wider in scope than the statutory liability under the 
Consumer Protection Act because (as we shall see later) that Act only applies to defective 
goods – though the meaning of that expression causes problems. But the common law 
liability arising under a collateral contract can extend to cases where the goods are in 
no real sense defective, but are merely unsuitable for the buyer’s purposes, or fail to live 
up to some claim made by the manufacturer. But even so, the collateral contract has 
serious limitations as a device for holding a manufacturer strictly liable. In particular,

it only helps a buyer where he can find some express statement or assurance that can be 
construed as a warranty,27 or a public statement on the specific characteristics of goods, 
within the meaning of the Consumer Rights Act 2015, s. 9, in the case of consumer sales.
There is, as yet, no authority which goes so far as to hold that a manufacturer could be 
liable for breach of implied warranties on the basis of a collateral contract. The step from 
express to implied warranties would be a momentous one in practice, but in legal theory 
it seems a small extension.28 A manufacturer markets his products through retailers; 
he advertises directly to the public, inviting them to buy his products. It does not seem 
unreasonable to hold that he is impliedly offering a warranty of reasonable fitness for 
ordinary use to a member of the public who buys the product. However, in view of the 
Consumer Protection Act 1987, which is largely based on this theory, it is perhaps unlikely 
that the courts will feel the need to develop the common law further in this area.29
Part 20 (formerly third-party) proceedings
The second common law expedient by which strict liability may be effectively imposed 
on the manufacturer is through third- and (if necessary) fourth-party proceedings. In 
the interests of making the law more ‘user-friendly’, under the Civil Procedure Rules 
1998 these are now referred to as ‘Part 20’ proceedings in England and Wales. If the 
buyer sues the seller for breach of warranty, the seller may claim an indemnity from 
his own supplier, and that supplier (if not himself the manufacturer) may in turn claim 
an indemnity from the manufacturer. As between each pair of parties, the relationship 
will be contractual and liability for breach of warranty can be established. For instance, 
in Dodd v Wilson,30 the plaintiff farmer employed a veterinary surgeon to inoculate 
his cattle with some serum; it proved to be defective and many of the cattle died or 
became diseased. The plaintiff recovered damages from the surgeon as on an implied 
warranty; the surgeon brought in his suppliers as third parties and the suppliers brought 
in the manufacturers as fourth parties. The surgeon obtained an indemnity from the 
third parties and they, in turn, obtained an indemnity from the fourth parties. In this 
way, liability was imposed on the manufacturer for breach of implied warranty from the 
manufacturer through the intermediaries. Furthermore, the House of Lords has given 
the existence of such rights of indemnity as itself a good ground for imposing strict 
liability on a supplier in contracts for work and materials.31 This is, however, a somewhat 
clumsy and costly expedient. Why should not the claimant have a direct remedy against 
the manufacturer for breach of warranty? Moreover, the expedient may not always work; 
for example, if one of the intermediaries is insolvent, cannot be found, only carries on 
business overseas or has gone out of business.
In Lambert v Lewis,32 retailers bought a defective coupling through a wholesaler whom 
they were subsequently unable to identify. In the Court of Appeal, where the retailers were

Product liability	 537
held liable to pay damages to the ultimate buyer of the coupling, they were refused an 
indemnity from the manufacturers on the ground that, in the absence of a direct contract 
between the retailers and the manufacturer, any such claim would have to be made in tort, 
and tort law did not recognise such a claim as it was a claim for pure economic loss.33 In the 
House of Lords, the decision was reversed on a different ground,34 but the House left open 
the possibility that such a claim for economic loss might be recognised by the law, where 
the economic loss consisted of a liability to pay damages in respect of some personal injury 
(or, presumably, property damage). However, such a development looks improbable in the 
foreseeable future in the light of Murphy v Brentwood District Council.35
Privity of contract: remedy confined to the buyer
The doctrine of privity of contract is also very material in the law of product liability in 
another major respect. Not only does the doctrine normally restrict liability to the seller; 
it also normally confines the remedy to the buyer. A sub-buyer, a donee, a member of the 
buyer’s family, an employee of the buyer, a mere bystander – none of these can sue the 
seller (nor, a fortiori, the manufacturer) for breach of condition or warranty, but only for 
negligence.36 Thus, if any of these persons should be injured through the use of a defective 
product they can only sue the retailer or manufacturer if they can establish liability under the 
Consumer Protection Act 1987 or through negligence. Even in Scots law, which allows third 
parties to acquire rights under contracts to which they are not privy, by means of its doctrine 
of jus quaesitum tertio, it is rare for a contract of sale to show the necessary irrevocable 
intention of the parties to confer such an enforceable benefit.37 Given the limitations of the 
1987 Act, and the difficulty of establishing negligence on the part of the manufacturer,38 such 
third parties are in a significantly worse situation than buyers and it seems unlikely that the 
Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 will do much to ameliorate this situation. In 
their Report,39 the Law Commission contrasted two cases:40
1	 On Mr and Mrs C’s marriage, their wealthy relative B buys an expensive three-piece-
suite as a wedding gift from A Ltd, a well-known department store. She makes it clear 
at the time of purchase that it is a gift for friends, and that it is to be delivered to  
Mr and Mrs C’s house and left with the housekeeper there as a gift. After two weeks 
serious faults in the suite become apparent. According to the Law Commission,  
Mr and Mrs C can sue A Ltd because A Ltd have promised to confer a benefit (a suite 
of satisfactory quality) on Mr and Mrs C who have been expressly identified by name.
33	 This outcome would be unaffected by the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.

case of D & F Estates v Church Commissioners [1988] 2 All ER 992 which signalled a stop to the expansion 
of liability for economic loss in that Junior Books v Veitchi Ltd [1983] 1 AC 20, 1982 SC (HL) 244 was not 
followed.

157 on Third Party Rights in Contract (2014).

2	 The previous example, but A Ltd are unaware that the suite is a gift for anyone, and 
it is delivered to B’s house. Mr and Mrs C cannot sue A Ltd because the contract 
between B and A Ltd does not purport to confer a benefit on Mr and Mrs C, who 
have not been expressly identified.41
Of course, there may be cases on the border between these two examples, and it remains 
to be seen whether the courts will give the Act a broad or a narrow interpretation in such 
cases.42
In some situations, the courts have struggled against the apparent logic of the doctrine 
of privity. For instance, in Lockett v A & M Charles Ltd,43 a husband and wife went into 
a hotel for a meal and the wife was made ill by being served infected food. Negligence on 
the part of the hotel was not made out so the claim had to be made in contract as on a 
breach of warranty. The hotel argued that the only contract was with the husband as it was a 
reasonable presumption that he would pay the bill.44 This argument was rejected by Tucker J 
who held that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, both husband and wife were in a 
contractual relationship with the hotel. He held that the normal inference where a person 
orders food in a hotel or restaurant is that he makes himself liable to pay for it, whatever the 
position may be as between the person ordering the food and his companions. But it would 
be difficult to apply this reasoning (say) where a person ordered a meal for a child.45 Similarly, 
if somebody books a private room at a hotel to entertain a large party, it would be clear that 
only he was in a contractual relationship with the hotel.46 Or again, where it is plain from the 
circumstances that the meal is to be paid for by a man and that a lady companion is only his 
guest, the lady will have no claim for breach of warranty.47
There is no doubt that the doctrine of privity can lead to some apparently anomalous 
results in these cases. A man buys a bottle of perfume (say) and gives it to his wife as 
a present. If the bottle explodes and injures her, she cannot sue the seller for breach 
of warranty (though she might have a remedy under the Consumer Protection Act or 
possibly in negligence). If, however, he has bought the bottle at his wife’s request, and 
therefore as her agent, the position is different. One possible way of escaping these 
results has been opened up, though it is not yet possible to say how far it may be taken. 
In Jackson v Horizon Holidays Ltd,48 the Court of Appeal awarded damages for the 
41	The Act, which follows the Law Commission’s draft, provides as follows:
	
1.  (1)  Subject to the provisions of this Act, a person who is not a party to a contract (a ‘third party’) may in his own right 
enforce a term of a contract if—

particular description but need not be in existence when the contract is entered into.

inconvenience and disappointment of a ruined holiday, not merely for the inconvenience 
and disappointment of the plaintiff himself but also for that of his family. Whether this 
would extend to personal injury cases is still uncertain, but it seems unlikely.49
Despite various signs of tentative movement in some directions, then, the broad position 
remained, until the coming into force of Part I of the Consumer Protection Act 1987,50 that, 
unless the plaintiff could sue on a contract, he had to prove negligence to found his cause 
of action. But, at least in the case of personal injury and death, if such negligence can be 
proved, there can be no exclusion of business liability by contract or notice.51
In the United States, both by virtue of §402A Restatement 2d, and the various versions 
of Article 2-318 of the Uniform Commercial Code (which extend the benefit of the 
quality warranties to third parties) third parties physically injured by defective products 
generally have a remedy against the producer. Set against this, the Contracts (Rights of 
Third Parties) Act 1999 is a very modest measure.
Assignment and novation
Where goods are sold by the original purchaser to a third party, normally the sale will be 
treated as a sub-sale, and the third party will have no remedy against the original seller. It 
would appear, however, that the rights that the original purchaser had against the seller 
can pass to the third party by assignment, at least where such a sub-sale is contemplated 
by the original parties.52 Any burden under the original contract, such as transferring to 
the purchaser the liability to pay service charges to the original seller, could only pass by 
novation or, in Scots law, delegation. It would appear that such assignments and novations 
are not uncommon when complex pieces of commercial equipment are sold. In English law, 
if no formal assignment has taken place complying with s. 136 of the Law of Property Act 
1925, the assignment might nevertheless be effective in equity, but the assignee would have to 
sue in the name of the original purchaser. In Scots law, neither the agreement to assign nor 
the assignation itself need to be in writing, although a simple style of written assignation is 
available under the Transmission of Moveable Property (Scotland) Act 1862. Intimation of 
the assignation to the debtor in the obligation assigned is, however, necessary to complete the 
transfer, although again this need not be in writing.53
Product liability under the Consumer Protection Act 1987
In 1985, the EU (then the EEC) promulgated a Directive on liability for defective 
products.54 This introduced a regime of so-called ‘strict’ product liability. Part I of 
the Consumer Protection Act 1987 was passed to give effect to this Directive, and it 
applies equally in Scots law as in English law. So far as the background to this Act is

concerned, it will be enough to mention four points. First, one of the main sources of 
initiative behind the Directive was undoubtedly the view that the previous law created 
unacceptable anomalies in the way it distinguished between the remedies of a buyer 
and a non-buyer, the latter generally requiring proof of negligence. Secondly, another 
major concern was the view that it was anomalous that it was generally much easier to 
establish liability against a retailer than against the manufacturer, who was often the 
party primarily responsible for defective goods. Thirdly, American law was thought 
to have demonstrated that it was possible to impose strict product liability in tort on 
manufacturers without undue strain.55 And fourthly, the European involvement arose 
because it was thought desirable that all manufacturers in member states should face 
similar legal liabilities so as to avoid distortions of competition which might arise if 
manufacturers had to bear different liabilities, according to varying laws in the member 
states.56 Various countries had proposed reforms, but governments were hesitant to 
act, largely out of fear of imposing costs on their industries which industries in other 
member states did not have to incur.57
The form of legal liability created by Part I of the Consumer Protection Act raises 
a very large number of difficult and intricate questions, but has not generated the 
huge volume of litigation anticipated in earlier editions of this book.58 Here, it will be 
necessary to offer a summary view of some of the essentials. The basic principle of the 
statutory product liability is that (1) any person who suffers damage, which is (2) caused 
by a defective product, is entitled to sue (3) the producer (and various other possible 
parties) without being required to prove fault.
Claimant or pursuer must show ‘damage’
The first requirement to the application of the Act is that the claimant or pursuer must 
show that he has suffered ‘damage’. By s. 5(1) ‘damage’ means ‘death or personal injury or 
any loss of, or damage to any property (including land)’. There is no particular difficulty 
here with regard to personal injury. It is defined by s. 45(1) so as to include ‘any disease 
and any other impairment of a person’s physical or mental condition’. Presumably, this 
is wide enough to cover the cases dealt with at common law under the term ‘nervous 
shock’. So far as death is concerned, the new Act is tied in with the existing tort statutes 
relating to death, so that liability will only arise on behalf of financial dependants under 
the Fatal Accidents Act 1976, or, in the case of non-dependants, in the very limited 
cases (and to the very limited extent) provided for by the Law Reform (Miscellaneous 
55	 See in particular s. 402A of the Restatement of Torts, 2d (1965). An enormous body of case law has grown 
up in America since then, but there is no evidence that this body of experience was seriously studied by the 
EC bureaucracy or anybody else responsible for the Directive.
56	 Yet there is no uniform product liability law in the United States, where this is a matter left to the law of 
each individual state; and there are indeed many variations – the Uniform Commercial Code Art. 2-318 has 
three alternatives, any of which may be chosen by a particular jurisdiction, and some states have introduced 
their own variations. It seems amazing that if the United States has been able to manage with such widely 
different laws of product liability it should be considered essential that EU nations, with their much more 
varied traditions, need a uniform law.
57	 Germany had, however, introduced legislation dealing with pharmaceutical products.

Provisions) Act 1934, as amended. In Scotland, the tie-in is with the Damages (Scotland) 
Act 2011 abd Part II of the Administration of Justice Act 1982.
So far as property damage is concerned, there are more complications. First, the 
Act excludes claims for £275 or less.59 Secondly, no claims for pure economic loss can 
be entertained under the Act. It is unclear to what extent consequential economic 
loss claims can be attached to claims for material loss or damage to property. If the 
consequential loss does not derive from the value of the damaged goods themselves, 
or is not parasitic on that damage,60 it would seem not to be claimable under the Act. 
If the claim can be said to concern the quantification of the value of the physical 
damage itself, the consequential loss might be claimable, but that will not generally 
be the case with goods intended for private use as opposed to business use, and (as 
we shall see) there are severe limits on the extent of liability for goods intended for 
business use. It would appear that ‘property’ for these purposes includes intellectual 
property; consequently, if, for example, a virus in a computer program61 were to 
damage other software belonging to the claimant or pursuer presumably he could sue 
under the Act.62 In the case of software which is merely licensed (the usual situation), 
strictly speaking, the licensee has no property in the software. It is to be hoped that 
a court would construe ‘property’ non-technically to avoid this anomaly. Any data 
damaged, of which the claimant was author, would be his property (copyright) in  
any event.
Next, it is made clear by s. 5(2) that damage to the defective product itself is not 
covered by the statutory liability. Nor does the statutory liability cover damage to a 
product ‘which has been supplied with the product in question comprised in it’. So, 
arguably, if a defective tyre, which has been supplied with a car, bursts causing damage 
(a) to the tyre itself, and (b) to the car, then neither the damage to the tyre nor the car 
is covered, assuming that the tyre can be said to be ‘comprised in’ the car. If the tyre 
is comprised in the car, would the statutory liability extend to an accessory, such as 
an expensive stereo?63 If the tyre is bought separately from the car, then the damage 
to the car will be covered. As we shall see later, it is not clear whether the Act differs 
from the common law on these intricate questions.64 This result is illogical. In order 
to reach a more rational solution, a distinction might be drawn between those aspects 
of a product having no reality as articles of commerce apart from forming part of the 
59	 Section 5(4). If the claimant is awarded £250 damages, nothing will be recovered. But if he or she is awarded 
£280, the whole sum, including the first £275, is recoverable. The exclusion applies to the amount to be 
awarded; so if the claimant/pursuer claims £500, but half is deducted for contributory negligence, nothing 
will be awarded under the Act. Section 5(4) is a correct implementation of the English language text of 
the Directive, but in the French and German texts it is an excess, and this is the way in which it has been 
implemented in most member states including, significantly, the Republic of Ireland (Liability for Defective 
Products Act 1991, s. 3(1)). The effect in other member states is that if the claimant/pursuer recovers more 
than the excess, the excess will be deducted from the global damages recovered. If he recovers less, he gets 
nothing.

complete unit such as a motor vehicle, and parts such as in the case of motor vehicle 
tyres, batteries, lamps, steering wheels, etc., which are customarily dealt with as 
accessories.65 In practice, such items may be specified by the customer when the car is 
bought from the dealer, and it seems absurd that the result might be different where on 
the one hand the customer has requested the item to be fitted when the car is supplied, 
and on the other if he goes back a week later and purchases the item which causes the 
damage to the car. In other words, it is not stretching things too far to argue that such 
accessories or ‘add-ons’ are not really ‘comprised in’ the item supplied, but are bought 
along with it.
Section 5(3) largely confines the liability for property damage to property which is 
intended for private use, occupation or consumption. The section disallows an action for 
damage to property if the property is not:
(a)	 of a description of property ordinarily intended for private use, occupation or consump-
tion; and
(b)	 intended by the person suffering the loss or damage mainly for his own use, occupation or 
consumption.
So the claimant or pursuer must show both that the property is ordinarily intended 
for private use, occupation or consumption, and that he did so intend it. The first 
requirement is similar to that contained in the Federal Warranties Act,66 that the product 
concerned be a ‘consumer product’ which is defined as tangible personal property 
‘normally used for personal, family or household purposes’, and presumably the cases on 
the interpretation of that provision might provide some guidance on the interpretation 
of s. 5(3)(a) and (b). The second requirement rules out the property of public authorities 
and business corporations,67 and also, presumably, claims by professional firms who 
could hardly say that their property is intended for ‘private’ use, etc., even if it is property 
ordinarily used for private purposes. But the position may be different with a single self-
employed professional, such as an author, who could reasonably claim that even goods 
used for the purposes of his profession (especially if these are kept in his home) are 
intended for ‘private use’.
It must also be remembered that under s. 5(1) ‘property’ includes land and therefore 
a house, so damage to a house caused by a defective product will be recoverable under 
the Act if the house is occupied by the owner (presumably it is intended ‘mainly’ for 
his private occupation even if he has a wife and 10 children). On the other hand, if the 
house is merely rented, the damage will not be recoverable unless the tenant is legally 
answerable for it under the lease, in which case he will still be the person ‘suffering the 
loss or damage’. Otherwise the landlord will be the person suffering the loss or damage, 
and he will not be able to recover it under the Act.
65	 This suggestion is based on the analogy of registered designs law – see Ford Motor Company’s Design

the defective product itself’, which begs the question as to what the product itself is.

Product liability	 543
Damage must have been caused by a defective product
The next requirement is that the claimant or pursuer must show that his loss or damage 
was caused by a defective product. The term ‘product’ is defined by s. 1(2) of the Act68 as 
‘any goods or electricity’;69 the definition also includes any product which is comprised 
in another product; for example, as a raw material or as a component part.70 Next, the 
word ‘goods’ is defined by s. 45(1) so as to include:
. . . substances, growing crops and things comprised in land by virtue of being attached to it and 
any ship, aircraft or vehicle.
This is a little wider than the definition of ‘goods’ in the Sale of Goods Act in that it 
includes things attached to land, but probably not actual buildings71 – though damage to 
buildings is covered. Presumably, this means that there could be liability under the Act 
for damage done by defective parts of a new building, as if window glass or roof tiles 
fall off and injure a passer-by.
A number of questions which arise in the law of sale, and which have previously been 
considered, may also arise in the present context. For instance, there is the question 
whether human blood (or plasma) supplied for transfusion is a ‘product’, which in 
turn must depend on whether it is ‘goods’ within the meaning of the Act.72 Perhaps 
the inclusion of the word ‘substances’ in the statutory definition makes it more likely 
that blood and similar products would fall within the 1987 Act.73 On the other hand, it 
may well be that the Act does not affect the general tendency to hold that professional 
liability is a matter of fault only, and should not be converted into strict liability merely 
because some product is incidentally supplied.74 In America it has, for instance, been 
held that a supplier of contact lenses is strictly liable for injury caused by them if the 
lenses were defective, but not if the cause of the injury was improper fitting.75
The question has even been raised whether authors and publishers may be liable in 
respect of ‘defective books’, where the defects likewise lie in the intellectual content 
68	 Following the original wording of Art. 2. This Article is deleted by Directive 1999/34/EC and a new definition 
substituted:
	
Article 2
	
For the purposes of this Directive, ‘product’ means all movables even if incorporated into another movable product or 
into an immovable. ‘Product’ includes electricity.
69	 For an American example of liability for electricity, see Ransome v Wisconsin Electric Power Co 275 NW 2d 
641 (1979). For this and many other references and thoughts, Professor Atiyah acknowledged his debt to Dr 
Simon Whittaker’s article (1989) 105 LQR 125. But cf. Singer Company, Link Simulation Systems Division v 
Baltimore Gas and Electricity Company 558 A 2d 419 (1988).
70	 Recent editions of this work considered whether software is covered by the definition of ‘goods’, but 
following the adoption of the Consumer Rights Act 2015, this matter is now regulated there on the basis of 
the contract between the supplier of digital content and the consumer, in particular s. 46.
71	 As Whittaker points out (above, n. 69), the Directive only applies to movables, and s. 1(1) of the Act makes 
it clear that the Directive must be taken into account in the construction of the Act. But ‘product’ includes 
movables incorporated into an immovable. This was so under the original definition of ‘product’ in Art. 2.
72	 See A v National Blood Authority [2001] 3 All ER 289. This point, however, was passed over no doubt as a 
result of the defendant’s concession in relation to Article 6 of the Directive.
73	 The Directive simply states that ‘product’ means all movables – Art. 2 as amended by Directive 1999/34/EC, 
for the position under the Sale of Goods Act.

of the work rather than in its physical make-up.76 This somewhat alarming possibility 
would add new terrors to authorship, though it would of course only matter anyhow 
where personal injury or property damage is caused by the misinformation.77
Although the definition of ‘goods’ includes growing crops, and also, no doubt, food-
stuffs and so on, by s. 2(4) as originally drafted there was no liability under the Act 
for agricultural produce78 and game, unless it had undergone ‘an industrial process’. 
However, as a result of Directive 1999/34/EC, the exception regarding ‘primary 
agricultural products and game’ has been deleted.79
The next, and vital, requirement is that the claimant or pursuer must be able to 
show that the product was ‘defective’. The meaning of a ‘defect’ is closely defined in  
s. 3 of the Act, though subject to an important defence in s. 4, which is considered later. 
Broadly, s. 3(1) says that a product is defective if ‘the safety of the product is not such 
as persons generally are entitled to expect’.80 Section 3(2) then goes on to say that all the 
circumstances must be taken into account in deciding what persons generally are entitled 
to expect,81 including the way the goods are marketed, their get-up, and any warnings 
and instructions. In addition, it is necessary to take account of what ‘might reasonably 
be expected to be done with or in relation to the product’. Further, it is provided that 
the time of supply must be taken into account and that it is impermissible to infer that 
a product was defective merely because later versions of the product are safer (a rather 
important qualification).82 However, later versions may provide valuable evidence as to 
what might have been achieved at the time.
Plainly, the need to show that the product was defective is the heart of this statutory 
liability. Equally plainly, it raises similar questions in some respects to some of the 
requirements of s. 14(2) and (3) of the Sale of Goods Act or ss. 9 and 10 of the Consumer 
Rights Act 2015, and (it may be suggested) the statutory definition of a defective product 
is about as helpful and vacuous as the former statutory definition of merchantable 
quality, as well, perhaps, as the new statutory definition of ‘satisfactory quality’. No 
doubt there will be many obvious cases where the Act will be easily applied, as a product 
will be obviously ‘defective’ in some very simple way. But (to judge from American 
experience) there will be very many borderline cases where the statutory definition will 
not provide any easy solutions. To suggest that products should be as safe ‘as persons 
generally are entitled to expect’ does not help a great deal when the question at issue 
is: precisely what are persons generally entitled to expect? Nor does it help a great

somewhat restrictive, e.g., as to dairy farming. Are chickens and eggs the products of ‘stockfarming’?

of contraception was 100 per cent effective. Fractures happened by chance. There was no evidence of a 
weakness in the system of testing used, and the condoms were manufactured to the standard required.

deal when the alleged defect is of an esoteric or complex nature as to which ‘persons 
generally’ probably have no expectations at all. Do ‘persons generally’ expect blood for 
transfusion (for instance) to be free from unknown and undiscoverable viruses as was 
the case at first with HIV? (Perhaps they now expect it to be free from HIV, but that is 
because that issue received a great deal of publicity.) Again, when the person injured was 
not the buyer of the product, but (say) some innocent bystander, it is not clear why it 
should be relevant to ask what persons generally are entitled to expect of the goods in 
question. So far, the case law on this has been somewhat ‘black letter’ and unreflective, 
and, whilst this may accord with continental notions of strict liability, it seems to pay 
scant regard to economic theory, and it has potentially harmful consequences in that 
many pharmaceutical products have to be launched with known serious side effects; for 
example, chemotherapy for terminal cancer patients. Are the manufacturers to be held 
liable for those known but unavoidable side effects?
In A v National Blood Authority,83 the claimants had been infected with hepatitis C 
through contaminated blood transfusions, or blood products, administered in the course 
of surgery. At the time, the risk of infection was known to the medical profession, but it 
was impossible to detect with the screening tests then available. Burton J held that the 
avoidability of the harmful characteristic was not a relevant circumstance to take into 
account in determining whether a product was defective, but that persons generally were 
entitled to expect that the blood would be free from what was in effect an unavoidable 
risk.84 In Abouzaid v Mothercare (UK) Ltd,85 where a 12-year-old boy, helping his mother  
attach a product to a pushchair, was injured in the eye when one of the product’s 
elasticated straps snapped back, the defendants were held liable though the danger had 
not previously been contemplated.
The American experience suggests that defects can generally be classified into three 
groups. There are, first, manufacturing defects; second, design defects and third, defects 
due to inadequate warnings or instructions.86 The first are the easiest to deal with 
because manufacturing defects generally mean that the product does not comply with 
the manufacturer’s own specifications and design. It is difficult for a manufacturer to 
claim that the goods are not defective when they fail to comply with its own designs 
and specifications. (But it must be remembered, the Act only deals with ‘safety’, so 
defects of a purely cosmetic nature would presumably not be ‘defects’ within the Act.) In 
this respect, there is unlikely to be much difficulty about the definition of ‘defect’. The 
court will be performing an exercise which does not greatly differ from what it already 
does under s. 14(2) of the Sale of Goods Act/s. 9 of the Consumer Rights Act, or even 
from what it does in an ordinary action for negligence. No court is likely to have much 
difficulty in concluding that the presence of a snail in an opaque bottle of ginger beer 
renders the drink ‘defective’. Although the liability under the 1987 Act is strict, and 
83	 [2001] 3 All ER 289.
84	 It should be noted that the defendants accepted that a producer’s liability under Art. 6 of the Directive was 
irrespective of fault. Accordingly, there was no real discussion in the case of the sort that has taken place in 
many US decisions of the meaning of ‘strict liability’.

	546	 Consumer sales
liability in negligence is of course fault based, such manifestly faulty goods can usually 
be taken to be proof of negligence anyhow.
The second type of relevant defect is a design defect, where a product emerges from 
the supplier exactly as it is intended to be, but it nevertheless possesses unsafe attributes, 
claims may be made that it was defective because of those attributes. It is here that the 
statutory definition appears so inadequate, as, again, though there may sometimes be 
gross design defects so glaring and simple to remedy that no court would have difficulty 
with them, there are bound to be many borderline situations where it is very difficult to 
say what ‘persons generally are entitled to expect’.
Although it is not possible in this book to discuss the matter in any detail, it must be 
said that most modern American case law has abandoned, or anyhow supplemented, 
the ‘reasonable public expectations’ test. It is now widely held in America87 that design 
defects must be tested by a multi-factorial test not essentially dissimilar to that involved 
in the law of negligence.88 It is necessary to ask how difficult or expensive it would have 
been to eliminate the defect, and what benefits would have been lost if that had been 
done. A simple example is provided by the release of new medicines and drugs. It is now 
well known that many drugs may have side effects which cannot always be detected in 
advance, simply because some of these effects may only become apparent when the drug 
has been taken by a very large number of people (because the side effect only affects one 
person in 100,000, for instance), or when it has been taken continuously for many years. 
If new drugs were held up until all such risks had been eliminated many people would 
be deprived of the benefit of the drugs (perhaps life-saving drugs) while this was being 
done (marketing approval takes some years to obtain, as it is). So it seems clear that 
some balance must be struck between avoiding unnecessary risks, and an over-cautious 
policy which only eliminates risk at huge cost. Before a product can be labelled defective 
in design, therefore, some sort of balance must be made, some attempt at a kind of 
cost-benefit analysis of the risks versus the gains. In some respects, this raises similar 
questions to the law of negligence and so it may appear that the new strict liability is 
not in practice likely to prove very different from negligence liability, save – and this is 
important – that the burden of proof is in effect reversed.89
It must also be remembered that many goods are inherently unsafe, in that their use 
always involves some element of risk. A sharp kitchen knife can cut fingers as well as 
meat; a ladder is something that people fall off, despite all precautions. The mere fact 
that such goods are inherently risky does not make them defective under the new Act, 
any more than their production would be negligent at common law.
One point is, however, made reasonably explicit by s. 3(2)(b), which has already been 
referred to. Manufacturers must expect that goods will sometimes be misused, or that 
they will be involved in accidents. So, for instance, goods may be defective if they would 
be dangerous even if not used strictly as they should have been. A car (it has often been 
held in America) may be defective in design if it does not stand a crash as well as it 
87	 See, e.g., Barker v Lull Engineering Co 573 P 2d 443 (1978), which is one of the leading cases on this point. 
See also Richardson v LRC Products, n. 81 above.

should have done because, for instance, the petrol tank is so situated that it is liable to 
explode in a rear-end collision. It is no defence for the manufacturer to claim that a car is 
designed to be driven and not to be crashed.
The ‘state of the art’ or ‘development risks’ defence
A special defence (popularly known as ‘the state of the art’ defence or sometimes the 
‘development risks’ defence) is incorporated in s. 4(1)(e) which says that there is no 
liability if the defendant can show:
that the state of scientific and technical knowledge at the relevant time was not such that a 
producer of products of the same description as the product in question might be expected to 
have discovered the defect if it had existed in his products while they were under his control . . . 
This very controversial defence was included in the Directive at the insistence of the  
U K government, but its effects are almost as controversial as its political genesis. Indeed, 
there was considerable doubt whether the statutory defence correctly gave effect to the 
Directive because the wording of the two differs somewhat.90 If this were the case, the 
United Kingdom would be in breach of its obligations under the EU Treaty, and, of 
course, in cases of conflict with the provisions of domestic law it is the Directive, as 
interpreted by the Court of Justice, which at the end of the day must govern.91 However, 
the Court of Justice ruled that the Commission had failed to establish that Article 7(e) 
had been incorrectly transposed.92 The Directive says that the defence arises if ‘the state 
of scientific and technical knowledge … was not such as to allow the existence of the 
defect to be discovered’. This appears to mean that liability exists if somewhere there is 
scientific or technical knowledge which could have led to the discovery of the defect, even 
though it was not reasonably discoverable by the defendant.93 But the UK legal advisers 
apparently took the view that ‘scientific and technical knowledge’ cannot be said to exist 
merely because somewhere in the world some obscure research worker has the relevant 
knowledge in his mind, or perhaps even has published it in some equally obscure journal. 
90	 The wording of Art. 7(e) of the Directive is as follows:
… that the state of scientific and technical knowledge at the time when he put the product into circulation was not such as 
to enable the existence [emphasis supplied] of the defect to be discovered.
 
91	 National courts are required to interpret national law in the light of the wording and purpose of Directives – 
see Marleasing SA v La Comercial Internacional de Alimentación SA, Case C-106/89 [1990] ECR I-4135. 
Failure to implement a Directive can give rise to liability on the part of the member state to a person 
suffering damage thereby – Francovich v Italy, C-6 and C-9/90 [1991] ECR I-5357. Directives are binding 
only on the member states to which they are addressed. Consequently, they cannot be invoked in disputes 
between private individuals – see, e.g., Paolo Faccini Dori v Recreb Srl (Case C-91/92) [1995] All ER (EC) 1.
92	 Case C-300/95 EC Commission v United Kingdom [1997] 3 CMLR 923.
93	 Though any disclosure (or at least any enabling disclosure) would be sufficient to bar patentability or to 
invalidate a patent in European Patent Convention countries. Although the issues involved in patent law and 
product liability are different on this point, given the close practical link between research and development 
and patenting, it might not be unreasonable to give the Directive its wider meaning. There are, after all, in 
existence today very efficient databases which enable the ‘state of the art’ to be established fairly rapidly, and 
which are utilised by those involved in R&D projects.

	548	 Consumer sales
In other words, scientific and technical knowledge only exists in the relevant sense if it is 
reasonably discoverable knowledge.94
The effect of the defence, as interpreted in the Act, is plainly to reincorporate 
something very like a no-negligence defence into the statutory cause of action; and it is 
for this reason that the Act has been seen to be a somewhat illusory piece of reform which 
largely takes away with one hand what it has given with the other. Clearly, there will be 
many cases in which the statutory defence under this section will enable the defendant 
to escape liability by proving, in substance, that he was not negligent. However, this 
does not mean that the new statutory cause of action is in all respects identical to the 
law of negligence. First, the onus of proof of this defence is on the defendant, and this 
may be a very important point in respect of many types of allegedly defective products. 
Secondly, the defendant may be liable, even though he has not been negligent because 
the defect in question may anyhow not have arisen from a lack of scientific and technical 
knowledge, but from the failure to put together obvious facts to appreciate and eliminate 
(or reduce) a risk. For instance, child-proof medicine bottles are hardly an invention 
based on ‘scientific and technical knowledge’, so conceivably (if the statute had been in 
force before their widespread use) a defendant supplying an ordinary medicine bottle 
might have been held strictly liable on the ground that the bottle was defective.95
A third possible difference, depending on the meaning attributed to ‘scientific and 
technical knowledge’, arises from the practical impossibilities of perfect quality control 
at places of production. Suppose one heart pacemaker in a thousand fails to work 
properly, and this failure rate cannot be reduced, not because of a lack of scientific and 
technical knowledge in the ordinary sense, but because it is impractical (or far too costly) 
to raise the level of factory quality control to such a point as to eliminate the risk.96 The 
actual product which fails is clearly defective under the Act, but could the defendant 
escape liability under ‘the state of the art’ defence? The answer is far from clear, though 
Richardson v LRC Products suggests that the defendant might escape liability on this 
ground.97 Whether a product is defective in this sense under s. 3(1) might depend upon 
the existence of warnings or general knowledge of these things. If there were no evidence 
on these matters, a defence on the basis of s. 4(1)(e) would still seem to be available. 
Whether it would be available on the wording of Article 6.1 of the Directive is less clear.98
However, as observed above, the courts have approached the matter in a somewhat 
unreflective manner. In A v National Blood Authority,99 it was held that the defence in 
Article 4.7(e) of the Directive did not apply where the existence of the generic defect 
was known or should have been known in the context of accessible information. Once 
the existence of the defect was known, there was the risk of that defect materialising 
94	 In the above case the court used the word ‘accessible’, which seems an appropriate criterion bearing in mind 
the comment made in the previous footnote. See Vacwell Engineering Co Ltd v BDH Chemicals Ltd [1971] 1 
QB 111 where the relevant information was available in books in the defendant’s own library.
	 95	 But if it is not ‘scientific and technical knowledge’ the defendant may be able to argue with more plausibility 
that persons generally would not have expected their medicine bottles to be safer than they had normally 
been in the past. (Or are persons generally ‘entitled to expect’ more than they do expect?)

Product liability	 549
in any particular product, and it was immaterial that the known risk was unavoidable 
in the particular product. It would be inconsistent with the purpose of the Directive if 
a producer, in the case of a known risk, continued to supply products simply because, 
and despite the fact that, he was unable to identify in which of his products that defect 
would occur or recur, or, more relevantly, in a case where the producer was obliged to 
supply, he continued to supply without accepting the responsibility for any injuries 
resulting, by insurance or otherwise. The defence also failed in Abouzaid v Mothercare 
(UK) Ltd.100 If these cases were expressly based on risk spreading theory101 they would be 
understandable, but they seem to be based rather on a somewhat ‘black letter’ approach 
to a Directive.102
Producers and other parties liable
The third essential question under the Act is: who is liable? The answer broadly is that 
under s. 2 three parties are, in principle, made liable for damage done by a defective 
product: (1) the ‘producer’ of the product, (2) anyone who has ‘held himself out to be 
the producer of the product’; for instance, by putting his trade mark on the product,103 
and (3) anyone who has imported the product into a member state from a place outside 
the member states. In addition, any supplier of the goods can also be liable if he fails, on 
request, to identify to the claimant one of the parties in the first three groups.
On the other hand, any party (including the producer) can escape liability if he 
can show that he did not supply the goods in the course of business or with a view to 
profit. ‘Supply’ is defined in an elaborate s. 46: it includes, in particular, selling, hiring 
or lending, furnishing by way of hire-purchase, supplying the goods under a contract 
for work and materials, or giving the goods away as a prize or gift. The coverage is fairly 
wide, but it is not exhaustive. Even a producer of a defective product would not be liable 
if he did not supply the product at all, but (say) the product was stolen from his factory, 
and ultimately sold to the claimant (or anyone else). It also means that a party who 
causes injury while using the goods will not be liable for product defects under the Act 
because he does not supply the goods to anyone. And this is true even if the user is also 
the producer – so if (say) the maker of forklift trucks uses them in its own factory, and a 
defect causes injury to a workman, there will be no statutory liability.
There may be more than one ‘producer’ of a defective product within the Act. Because 
of the definition of ‘product’, the term covers the finished product as well as component 
parts and raw materials. So if a product is defective because of a defective component, 
the producers of both the finished product and the component will be liable, assuming 
100	 [2000] EWCA Civ 348 – see p. 545 above.
101	 See Goldberg v Kollsman Instruments Co 191 NE 2d 81 (1963), p. 550 below.
102	 In the sense that although the Directive is interpreted in accordance with its purposes these are determined 
entirely within the legislation.
103	 Section 2(1)(b). Where a mark is applied by a licensee, it would appear, therefore, that it is the licensor who 
is liable under this provision because by licensing the application of his mark he has ‘held himself out to be 
the producer of the product’. The licensee will be liable as ‘the producer’ if such he is. But if he is buying 
in goods and applying the mark, he presumably will not be liable as producer. In such a case the original 
producer is liable, together with the trade mark licensor.

	550	 Consumer sales
each has ‘supplied’ the relevant product, as will usually be the case.104 The liability of the 
producer of the finished product in this particular respect may well be genuinely strict, 
and may easily extend beyond common law liability for negligence.
Relation of the statutory liability to other forms of liability
The cause of action under the 1987 Act is in addition to, and does not in any way 
supersede, any other cause of action.105 Further, the Act prohibits any party from 
contracting-out of (or limiting) his liability under the Act.106 It is therefore possible, 
in theory, for a person who acquires goods from a producer of those goods to have a 
statutory cause of action under the Act which overlaps with his contractual causes of 
action under the Sale of Goods Act or the Consumer Rights Act, or otherwise. And 
occasionally, this may help a buyer because (for instance) the definition of a defective 
product is wider than the quality requirements under the Sale of Goods Act/Consumer 
Rights Act, or because the prohibition on limiting or excluding liability is wider than 
that imposed under the Unfair Contract Terms Act/Consumer Rights Act. But this will 
not often be a matter of much practical importance, as consumers rarely buy goods 
direct from the manufacturers,107 and businesses which do so will find that there is 
virtually no liability for business damage under the Act.
So the main practical importance of the Act will lie in the fact that a buyer will 
sometimes be enabled to sue parties other than the seller without having to prove fault, 
and that a non-buyer will likewise be enabled to sue the producer (though not a mere 
seller) without proving fault.
It still remains to be seen how far this legislation will prove to have been worthwhile. 
Although many European lawyers have been for some years casting envious eyes at 
American developments, it is far from clear that they have really achieved a great deal 
to benefit consumers. The truth is that, in the great majority of cases, the Act will 
produce the same outcome as the law of negligence.108 Defects in products are usually 
the result of negligence.109 Only in special and unusual circumstances is it likely that a 
manufacturer would be held strictly liable where he has not been negligent, though it 
may be that the reversal of the burden of proof under the ‘state of the art defence’ may 
have some practical importance.
A good illustration of the difference between ‘strict’ liability and negligence is 
provided by the American case of Goldberg v Kollsman Instruments110 in which 
passengers were killed when an airliner crashed because of a defective altimeter. The 
104	 Though there may be good economic grounds for not holding a component manufacturer liable – see 
Goldberg v Kollsman Instruments 191 NE 2d 81 (1963) below.
105	 Section 2(6).
106	 Section 7.
107	 An exception would be goods that are commonly built to order, such as bicycles.
108	 As in the case of negligence, the claimant must prove that the defect was the cause of the damage, and, in 
cases of physical injury whose effects only become apparent after a considerable lapse of time, that may be 
a considerable problem. Even where the product can be established as the cause of the damage, there ought 
to be a defence if it can be established that it is a natural side effect of the product, as in the case of a drug: 
the ‘Learned Hand’ test suggested in the text gives an explanation as to why it is not negligent to supply 
cancer chemotherapy with serious side effects, but it would be to market a cure for a minor ailment with 
similar side effects.

manufacturer of the aircraft had not been negligent but was held liable, whereas the 
manufacturer of the altimeter was held not liable. The reason for this seems to have been 
that the aircraft manufacturer was felt to be the better loss distributor: a sensible result 
which, for the reasons given above, could not be reached under the 1987 Act.
It must be said that the move to strict product liability against manufacturers in 
America has led to a huge amount of litigation as it has been necessary to work out what 
is meant by a ‘defective product’; the original view that this would be a much simpler 
matter than deciding issues of negligence has been completely falsified by events. It has 
also been necessary to reconsider many doctrines of tort and delict law (for instance, 
the application of the rules of contributory negligence and remoteness of damage) to 
see if they need adaptation to a strict liability regime as opposed to a negligence liability 
regime.111 It seems hardly going too far to say that the American experience suggests that 
the main beneficiaries of these changes are lawyers and insurers.
Non-contractual claims in respect of defects in the goods
A person who buys goods which prove defective may wish to claim damages in respect of 
the defects themselves because, for instance, the goods may have to be repaired, or because 
they are simply worth less than the buyer had expected, or because they are less efficient in 
use. Such cases are outside the Consumer Protection Act, which excludes liability for loss 
or damage to the product itself, or any part of any product which has been supplied with 
the product in question comprised in it.112 If the buyer sues the seller, such a claim raises no 
particular problem and is governed by the same principles as apply to actions for damages in 
respect of defective goods.113 But if the buyer wishes to sue the manufacturer or anyone else 
responsible for the state of the goods, then apart from the possibility of recovering through 
the device of the collateral contract, or through intermediate suppliers,114 the action must be 
brought in tort. And a tort action of this nature is still the subject of very considerable legal 
difficulty because it appears to be (at least in many cases) a claim for pure economic loss. 
Moreover, case-law suggests that this form of liability will rarely be available in tort or delict 
to supplement contractual liability.115
Since the case of Murphy v Brentwood, which was mentioned above, overruled Anns v 
Merton London Borough Council, the possibility of suing in negligence for economic 
losses has virtually ceased to exist.116 It will be best to consider the interplay of the 
various areas of law having a bearing on this issue through a series of examples arising 
from the following hypothetical situation. Suppose A buys a second-hand car from B, the 
car having originally been made by C, and suppose also that B had fitted a new tyre117 
made by T which was dangerous because of some negligence in manufacture on the part 
of T. While A is using the car, the tyre bursts.
111	 Though liability under the 1987 Act does specifically attract the operation of the Law Reform (Contributory 
Negligence) Act 1945, some case law may well be needed before the application of that Act is sorted out in 
its relation to s. 3(2)(b) of the 1987 Act, dealing with misuse, etc.

117	 If the tyre was bought with the car there will be no recovery for damage to the car – see Case 5 below.

	552	 Consumer sales
Case 1
If no injury or damage is caused by the tyre burst, except to the tyre itself, A cannot sue 
T in respect of the damaged tyre under the Consumer Protection Act because s. 5(2) 
excludes damage to the product itself.118 Since Murphy v Brentwood it is likely that, as 
damage to the product itself, this will be treated as pure economic loss, which is not 
generally recoverable in tort. And even though the original defect in the tyre may have 
caused the burst, which may itself be a much more serious piece of damage than the 
original defect (so the tyre indeed becomes worthless) this does not alter the situation.
Case 2
If the result of the tyre burst is that A is injured, or that any property belonging to A (other 
than the tyre itself) is damaged, then A still cannot recover for the damage caused to the tyre 
itself by its bursting,119 but he can recover damages for that other injury or damage from T 
in an ordinary action in tort under the principle of Donoghue v Stevenson.120 This possibility 
extends also to a claim for damage to the car itself, as this is A’s property and was not itself 
made by T and was bought separately. It appears to be immaterial in this case how closely 
connected the two chattels are, even where they are plainly sold as one item, so long only 
as the two items were made by separate manufacturers. So a buyer of plastic pails who fills 
them with waterproofing compound for resale can sue the maker of the pails if they were so 
negligently made that they leak, causing the compound to be lost, and a buyer of a bottle of 
wine can sue the maker of the cork (assuming he is a different party from the winemaker) if 
it is so defective that it causes the wine to go bad.121
The effect of the Consumer Protection Act in these cases appears somewhat erratic, 
as s. 5(2) of that Act only denies liability for damage to the defective product itself, or to 
‘any product which has been supplied with the product in question comprised in it’. An 
amelioration of the apparent anomaly that the results are different if the tyre is bought 
separately than if it is bought with the car was suggested above.122 The problem caused 
by the words ‘with the product in question comprised in it’ could not in any case apply 
to the examples of the defective pails and wine corks. In neither case would the defective 
product be ‘comprised’ in the damaged goods.123 So there could occasionally be liability 
under the Act, in which case, of course, it would be necessary to show that the product 
in question was defective, rather than that there had been negligence at common law.

119	 See D & F Estates v Church Commissioners [1988] 2 All ER 992, at 1012 per Lord Oliver, where he accepts 
that there may be liability in such a case where buildings are concerned, but rejects the idea of liability in 
the case of chattels. Lord Bridge appears to draw no distinction between buildings and chattels (see p. 1006 
at letter j) but it seems that he also would reject liability for the tyre damage on these facts.

123	 This assumes, however, that normal literal English methods of statutory interpretation are applied to  
s. 5(2), an assumption which may be incorrect. See Whittaker, above, n. 69, where it is suggested that because 
the Directive must be taken into account in the construction of the Act, and because the European Court 
will be the ultimate authority on the construction of the Directive, it may be necessary to use different 
methods of interpretation. If so, the precise wording of s. 5(2) may eventually turn out not to be of so much 
importance as the general purport.

	
	 	
Product liability	 553
Case 3
If the defect in the tyre does not cause it to burst, but (say) to deflate suddenly, without other 
damage to the tyre itself, and if this deflation should itself cause an accident in which some 
injury or other damage occurs, then it seems that any additional damage to the tyre caused 
by the accident, and not by the original deflation, may be recoverable in tort. The reason for 
this is that the additional damage to the tyre here is parasitic on the other injury or damage, 
and it still seems to be a recognised principle that such parasitic damage will be recoverable in 
tort, even if it is economic loss alone.124 The only rational justification for this appears to be 
that where actionable damage has already occurred, it will not open the door to a multitude 
of additional possible claimants to allow the victim of economic loss to latch on his claim for 
economic loss to his other claims for injury or damage.
Again, it seems that the result under the Consumer Protection Act could be different 
because of s. 5(2) as it is the product itself that is damaged, so the claim could only be 
brought at common law if negligence can be proved.
Case 4
If A discovers that the tyre is defective and dangerous before any accident occurs and 
replaces the tyre, it now seems that there can be no claim against T for the cost of the 
tyre. Murphy v Brentwood District Council,125 suggests that whilst the manufacturer 
of, for example, a central heating boiler may be liable for damage to property caused 
by it, that liability would not extend to the repair costs of the chattel itself, since this 
would, in effect, introduce product liability and transmissible warranties of quality into 
the law of tort by judicial legislation. The result under the Consumer Protection Act is  
the same.
Case 5
Suppose now that the defective tyre was originally made and fitted by the manufacturer of 
the car, and the defect in the tyre causes a burst which leads to an accident in which the 
car is damaged. The problem here is whether the car and tyre should be considered as one 
item, so as to fall within the principle in Case 1, that a defect in some good which causes 
damage to itself is not recoverable, or whether it falls within the principle in Case 2, that the 
damage to the car should be considered independently, so that that would be recoverable as 
ordinary physical damage under the rule in Donoghue v Stevenson. In Murphy v Brentwood 
District Council, it was observed that it was unrealistic to regard a chattel which had been 
manufactured by the same person as a complex structure. In consequence, this suggests that 
the House of Lords would view the situation as falling within Case 1. In the case of complex 
structures the result might be different. In the D & F Estates case, Lord Bridge reserved his 
opinion on the question whether, in the case of complex structures and chattels made up 
of distinct parts, physical damage done by one part to another could qualify as ordinary 
physical damage under the rule in Donoghue v Stevenson. Lord Oliver, while agreeing that

125	 [1991] AC 398, [1990] 2 All ER 908.

	554	 Consumer sales
this might be possible in the case of buildings, appeared more firm against accepting this in 
the case of complex chattels. It is difficult to offer comment or prediction in this area of the 
law, where everything now seems dictated by pragmatic considerations, and arbitrary lines 
abound in preference to reasoned arguments. But it really would seem an outrage to common 
sense if an ordinary consumer whose negligently-made car battery causes a fire destroying his 
car along with the battery cannot sue the manufacturers of the battery just because they also 
happen to be the manufacturers of the car.126 But this means, of course, that some principle 
will be needed to identify a ‘complex’ chattel. The law is perhaps still some way from sorting 
this problem out. The Consumer Protection Act would possibly provide a remedy in this 
situation if the ‘separate market’ argument set out above is accepted.127
Case 6
If the defect in the tyre is not one which renders it dangerous, but (say) simply unlikely 
to wear as well as such a tyre ought to, then the buyer’s prospects of succeeding against 
the manufacturer are now slim indeed. Even here the law does, in principle, recognise 
some situations in which recovery is possible, but the circumstances would have to be very 
exceptional.
There is no liability under the Consumer Protection Act in this case.
Case 7
If the tyre had been damaged in an accident (or otherwise – for instance, by negligent 
fitting) caused by the negligence of a third party before A bought the car it seems that  
A will have no cause of action in tort against the third party,128 and it makes no difference 
that the damage was not manifest at the time of the purchase. Only a person who has a 
proprietary or possessory interest in goods at the time they are damaged can sue a third 
party in tort for causing that damage.129 This rule has arisen in commercial situations 
where it does not usually cause a great deal of trouble because the buyer of goods liable to 
have suffered damage (i.e. principally goods being transported by land or sea) normally 
receives a transfer of the contract of carriage,130 which enables him to sue for the damage 
in contract. In other contexts, the present rule may be less justifiable, but it does not 
appear in fact to cause much practical difficulty. Once again, the principal justification 
for it appears to be the view that the buyer of the goods should look to his contract 
to protect him against defects and damage done before he acquires the goods, though 
hard cases are conceivable in which a court might try to distinguish the Aliakmon, for 
example, on the basis that the claimant was a consumer. The situation would also be 
different where personal injury was caused: here the claimant could recover on usual 
Donoghue v Stevenson principles.

dealt in separately.

Manufacturers’ guarantees
Introduction: a word about the word ‘guarantee’
The word ‘guarantee’ is used in law in four very different senses:
1	 It is the promise to answer for the debt or default of another. Under the Statute 
of Frauds,1 such contracts must be evidenced in writing, signed by the party to be 
charged. Guarantees in this sense are commonly met with in consumer credit trans-
actions; for example, where a parent might be required to guarantee his or her child’s 
hire-purchase debt to a finance company. We are not concerned with guarantees in 
this sense in this chapter.
2	 Product guarantees, of which the most common is the manufacturer’s product guar-
antee, commonly found printed as a standard form purporting to take effect as a con-
tract between the buyer of the goods in question and the manufacturer. These are 
dealt with in the following section.
3	 ‘Extended warranties’ or ‘guarantees’ routinely offered with more expensive con-
sumer electrical goods and the like. In return for a lump sum2 or regular payments to 
a company which may be (but is not necessarily) independent of either the retailer or 
the manufacturer,3 the costs of repair should the goods break down will be covered. 
These are dealt with in the section following ‘manufacturers’ guarantees’.
4	 ‘Satisfaction guarantees’: these are typically in a form such as: ‘Money back in  
30 days if not completely satisfied.’
Manufacturers’ guarantees
A useful working definition of the manufacturer’s guarantee is as follows:
. . . a voluntary undertaking given by a manufacturer[4] (the ‘guarantor’) without charge to 
provide a remedy, should the product covered by the guarantee become defective as a result 
of poor workmanship or the use of faulty materials in the manufacturing process during a 
specified period of time after purchase.5

	2	 Which may be covered by the moneys lent under the credit agreement covering the price of the goods.
	3	 Which may be an insurance company – from the consumer’s point of view, as explained below, there are 
certain advantages in it being an insurance company.
	4	 Which term includes producers.
	5	 This definition is taken from Twigg-Flesner, Consumer Product Guarantees (2003, Ashgate), p. 1.

	556	 Consumer sales
Similar guarantees are offered by some retailers, and these too are within the scope 
of this chapter, though, to avoid complicating matters, we will, in general, be focusing 
on manufacturers’ guarantees. Since there will be a contractual nexus between the buyer 
and the retailer, retailers’ guarantees will operate either as part of the sales transaction, 
or as collateral contracts, the consideration for which in English law can be found in the 
buyer entering into the sales contract.6 The contractual aspect of manufacturers’ guaran-
tees in English law was more problematic.
As was pointed out in previous editions of this work, there is scarcely any English or 
Scottish authority on the effect of manufacturers’ guarantees. Were the buyer of goods 
aware of the guarantee, then it would be possible to analyse it as a collateral contract, the 
consideration for which was the purchase of the goods from the dealer.7 It would, however, be 
difficult to apply this analysis where the buyer only became aware of the guarantee when he or 
she got home and opened the box. In fact, this will commonly be the case, as most consumer 
(and many non-consumer) goods are delivered from the retailer’s stockroom in sealed boxes,  
after the buyer has selected a model from the samples on display. Thus, the first time that 
the consumer will see the guarantee is when he or she opens the box at home. Formerly, 
it was possible to argue that by completing and posting the guarantee, which invariably 
excluded common law rights, the consideration was the surrender of these rights in return 
for the manufacturer’s undertakings given under the guarantee. This line of argument might 
still have some validity in non-consumer cases, but because (as we have seen) the consumer 
buyer is no longer able to surrender his or her common law rights,8 this analysis is no longer 
useful in consumer cases. Another possibility is that the English courts may now be prepared 
to hold such guarantees binding as unilateral contracts.9 This would certainly provide a 
sensible solution in non-consumer cases, where otherwise the absence of consideration 
would mean that the buyer has no legal rights under the guarantee. This problem does not 
arise under Scots law, as it has no consideration requirement;10 manufacturers’ guarantees are 
characteristically seen as unilateral promises rather than contracts.
A further problem with manufacturers’ guarantees is whether or not they are limited 
to the original buyer, or whether they run to persons who subsequently become owners 
of the goods within the period of the guarantee. The current situation is that manufac-
turers can limit the guarantee to the first buyer, although it is possible that such a restric-
tion might, in some instances, constitute an unfair term within the meaning of Part II of 
the Consumer Rights Act 2015.
A related question is who should be liable to the consumer under the guarantee. Clearly, 
the manufacturer giving the guarantee is liable on it, subject to the legal questions discussed 
above in relation to non-consumer sales. It has been suggested, however, that the retailer 
	6	 On the analogy of the series of hire-purchase cases starting with Webster v Higgins [1948] 2 All ER 127, 
where dealers said, ‘If you buy the [car] we will guarantee that it is in good condition.’ In reliance on this 
statement, the defendant entered into a hire-purchase transaction with a third party. The car turned out to 
be in poor condition, and the dealers were held liable on their ‘guarantee’. See also VAI Industries (UK) Ltd

Manufacturers’ guarantees	 557
should additionally be liable, since the manufacturer’s guarantee is often specifically men-
tioned by the retailer as a selling point for the goods in question. However, nothing has been 
done about this, though, as noted above, many reputable retailers do offer their own guar-
antees, which may extend for a longer time than the manufacturer’s. Obviously, there is a 
cost in this, and probably the answer is best left to consumer choice. If goods are bought at 
a low price from the warehouse type establishments sometimes referred to as ‘box shifters’, 
no doubt the price will be lower than from a reputable department store, but by buying from 
the latter type of establishment, the consumer does often acquire additional security in the 
form of the store’s guarantee. This is particularly useful where, as is often the case, it is more 
convenient to return defective goods to the store than to the manufacturer.
The situation under manufacturers’ guarantees so far as the consumer buyer is con-
cerned changed after the Sale of Consumer Goods and Associated Guarantees Direc-
tive.11 Initially implemented through the Sale and Supply of Goods to Consumers 
Regulations,12 the relevant provision now is s. 30 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015.
The Consumer Rights Act 2015 and Guarantees
The Directive did not make it obligatory that a manufacturer’s guarantee be given, but, 
if it is, the provisions implementing Art.6 of the Directive are applicable. The definition 
of ‘guarantee’ is as follows:
. . . an undertaking to the consumer given without extra charge by a person acting in the course 
of the person’s business (the “guarantor”) that, if the goods do not meet the specifications set 
out in the guarantee statement or in any associated advertising—
(a)	 the consumer will be reimbursed for the price paid for the goods, or
(b)	 the goods will be repaired, replaced or handled in any way.13
Section 30 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015 contains the relevant provisions on guar-
antees. Section 30(3) lays to rest the doubts (mentioned above) that existed at common 
law about the effectiveness of manufacturers’ guarantees as legal documents.14 Guar-
antees now take effect at the time the goods are delivered as a contractual obligation 
owed by the guarantor under the conditions set out in the guarantee statement and the 
associated advertising. Because a guarantee is treated as a unilateral promise, rather 
than as a contract, in Scots law,15 s. 30(3) does not state that the guarantee forms a con-
tract between the manufacturer and the buyer. Perhaps so far as the law in England 
and Wales is concerned, the use of the term ‘contractual obligation’ is also intended to 
signal that these documents are unilateral contracts, a possibility suggested above for 
analysing guarantees in non-consumer cases.16 As was pointed out above, manufactur-
ers are under no legal obligation to provide guarantees, but, if they do, they are legally 
binding and must comply with the terms of s. 30. In particular, the guarantee must set

out in plain and intelligible language the contents of the guarantee and the essential 
particulars necessary for making claims under the guarantee; notably the duration and 
territorial scope of the guarantee as well as the name and address of the guarantor.17 
If the consumer requests, the guarantee must be made available in writing or other dura-
ble medium available and accessible to him within a reasonable time.18 Enforcement is by 
injunction, or in Scotland specific implement, applied for by an enforcement authority19
Extended warranties or guarantees20
As noted above, these are usually offered with more expensive types of domestic electrical 
appliance such as fridges, washing machines and dishwashers. These are known in the trade 
as ‘white goods’. Such warranties or guarantees are also offered with a range of ‘brown 
goods’ such as television sets and television recorders.21 These contracts cover three types 
of risk: (1) the risk of product breakdown;22 (2) the financial risk if an expensive part needs 
replacing and (3) the risk that a suitable repairer may be difficult to find (the warrantor 
should offer a network of repairers who can carry out the repair quickly and efficiently). 
These contracts add to the remedies provided to the consumer under the Consumer Rights 
Act 2015, but how much they add is problematic because obviously at the outset the reliability 
of goods is unknowable, and many manufacturers’ guarantees will cover most breakdowns 
that are likely to occur, and the retailers are liable for defects existing at the time of sale under 
the Consumer Rights Act. As noted previously, reputable retailers often themselves offer 
guarantees equivalent to manufacturers’ warranties for a period that may even be longer than 
the manufacturer’s guarantee. Where goods are heavily used by different persons, as will be 
the case with goods present in furnished lettings, they may well prove to need more repair 
and maintenance than those in homes under single-family occupation. In this case, these 
extended warranty contracts can offer a good way of making outgoings predictable, which 
will usually be what the owners in such cases want. It may also be that those on a tight budget 
will find that the predictability that these contracts offer is of value. In practice, however, it 
would appear that these contracts are offered by retailers whose margins on their sale can be 
very high, as a way of inflating their profits.23 In fact, the claims made seem to be lower than 
for insurance generally.24 In short, for most consumers they offer poor value.

21	 Leaving aside the situation under extended warranties, an important practical difference between the two 
categories of goods is that in the case of white goods, the manufacturer will usually have its own repair 
network, and the consumer will deal with that directly. In the case of brown goods, traditionally the dealer 
maintained its own repair facilities. Today, not all retailers maintain these facilities, and, where they do not, 
the manufacturer will provide a list of approved repairers.

Manufacturers’ guarantees	 559
A further cause of concern is that whereas the real nature of these contracts is that 
of insurance, many are not made with insurance companies. Where, as has happened, 
the warranty providers become insolvent and unable to provide the contracted services, 
the consumer has been left without recourse, and the premiums paid are unrecoverable. 
By contrast, if an insurance company were involved and became insolvent, the Finan-
cial Services Compensation Scheme would cover the case.25 In consequence of these con-
cerns, in July 2002, the Competition Commission was asked to investigate and report 
on the existence or possible existence of a monopoly situation in relation to the supply 
of extended warranties for domestic electrical goods in the UK. Its report appeared in 
2003.26 Four overlapping characteristics of market behaviour suggested that, given the 
point of sale advantage that the offer of such contracts possesses, practices that might 
otherwise be unexceptionable could act to restrict or distort competition:
(a)	 Almost all extended warranties are purchased at point of sale; few consumers seek 
information on extended warranties prior to their purchase;27 and consumers have little 
opportunity to consider alternatives to the extended warranty on offer at point of sale.
(b)	 Extended warranties on offer at point of sale are nearly always all from one provider, 
usually the retailer (or a third party which is the sole supplier to the retailer).
(c)	 There is generally no information available at point of sale on prices, or terms and 
conditions, of extended warranties available from alternative providers (such as manu-
facturers, insurers, credit card companies or others).
(d)	 There is generally no information available on domestic electrical goods’ reliability, likely 
repair costs, or the probability of theft or accidental damage.
Based on their consultation on remedies and further consideration, the Competition 
Commission developed two packages of possible remedies. In the event, it is the first of 
these packages which is given effect to by the Supply of Extended Warranties on Domes-
tic Electrical Goods Order,28 which came into force on 6 April 2005. Retailers now have 
to do the following:
• show the price of the extended warranty alongside electrical goods, in store and in 
their printed advertising material;
• provide consumers with information about their statutory rights, cancellation rights 
and details of the warranty, including whether or not the warranty provides financial 
protection in the event of insolvency and terminates if a claim is made;
• give the consumer 45 days to cancel the extended warranty, including giving the 
consumer a written reminder of this right and the right to cancel at any time and 
receive a refund;
• offer any consumers, who do not wish to purchase a warranty immediately, quotations 
stating that the extended warranty remains available on the same terms for 30 days if 
the consumer chooses not to buy it at that time. Any discounts tied to the purchase of 
the extended warranty should also be available for 30 days.

element of surprise that tends to reinforce the retailer’s point of sale advantage.
