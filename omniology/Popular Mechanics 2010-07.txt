read the Ô¨Üory. Imagine my

Orbiting Space Planes
I greatly enjoyed your Ô¨Üory on 
the X-37B space plane but muÔ¨Ü 
point out that, in November 
1988, the unmanned Soviet 
Buran orbited and executed an 
automated landing, making it 
(not the X-37B) the Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü 
unmanned space plane to 
complete an orbital mission.
MIKE JENNE
TRUSSVILLE, AL
EDITOR‚ÄôS NOTE: e reader is 
corre‚Äîthe Buran orbited 
Earth twice during its only 
Ô¨Çight and landed using 
autopilot. e cra was 
designed to carry people, but 
the Soviets didn‚Äôt inÔ¨Üall a life- 
support syÔ¨Üem for the Ô¨Çight.
Acceleration Frustration
I read your Car Clinic, ‚ÄúToyota‚Äôs 
Woes,‚Äù on sudden unintended 
acceleration [SUA] with great 
intereÔ¨Ü. I am an ASE CertiÔ¨Åed 
MaÔ¨Üer Technician and have 
served as an expert witness for 
a number of acceleration 
cases. Not once, in any of the 
cases I‚Äôve been involved with, 
have I found that the engine-
management control unit 
could have caused a case of 
SUA. It is moÔ¨Ü oen driver 
error or a mechanical issue 
(lack of maintenance, Ô¨Çoor 
mats, etc.). I do not know who 
Toyota made angry, but the 
company has been tried and 
convied out of ignorance and 
malice. e ‚ÄúghoÔ¨Ü in the 
machine‚Äù does not exiÔ¨Ü.
ANGELO D. ROBERSON
REMLAP, AL
While I appreciated the 
technical discussion of engine 
management syÔ¨Üems in your 
recent Ô¨Üory on Toyota, the 
Ô¨Üatement about ‚Äúthe ghoÔ¨Ü in 
the machine‚Äù is too simpliÔ¨Üic  
and ignores the fa that bugs 
can exiÔ¨Ü in embedded 
soware (Ô¨Årmware) in all 
syÔ¨Üems ‚Äîno matter how 
completely the quality control 
has been executed. 
During more than 25 years 
of developing Ô¨Årmware, I‚Äôve 
learned that there is [always] 
one laÔ¨Ü bug Ô¨Üill waiting to be 
discovered. Redundant voltage 
paths don‚Äôt mean much if they 
are sensed and aed upon by 
the same Ô¨Årmware module. 
SyÔ¨Üems need independent, 
redundant soware modules 
developed by independent 
teams. en redundancy may 
aually mean something.

Treehouse Connection
I‚Äôm currently serving in Iraq

picked up a copy of your 
magazine. As I leafed through 
it, a piure of a cardboard tree-
house (‚ÄúFamily Tree,‚Äù April ‚Äô10) 
caught my attention. In 2003, I 
built a treehouse for my nieces

e talk of the commercial aviation world has been dominated for 
years by the sales conÔ¨Çi between Boeing‚Äôs 787 Dreamliner and 
Airbus‚Äôs A380. Now both planes are Ô¨Ånally airborne‚Äîthe A380 Ô¨Çying for 
airlines, the 787 in teÔ¨Ü Ô¨Çights. Here‚Äôs how the airplanes match up in the 
global marketplace.  ‚Äî DAVIN COBURN
e world‚Äôs 
largeÔ¨Ü passenger 
plane has proven 
to be the moÔ¨Ü 
expensive civilian 
airplane ever 
developed. Airbus 
claims its fuel 
eÔ¨Éciency, control 
syÔ¨Üem and 
sound-reduion 
technology also 
make it the moÔ¨Ü 
advanced airliner 
ever built. e 
Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü-class seion 
sets Ô¨Üandards in 
luxury, but the 
A380 began 
service during a 
global recession. 
‚Äúey‚Äôre going to 
see years of 
losses before that 
[luxury] market 
fully materializes,‚Äù 
says inveÔ¨Üment 
consultant Paul 
Nisbet, president 
of JSA Research. 
Some carriers 
deferred airplane 
deliveries, while 
Qantas ripped out 
its Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü-class 
A380 cabins for 
ones with  
cheaper seats.
e Dreamliner 
travels the same 
diÔ¨Üance as the 
A380 at the same 
speed but carries 
half the passen-
gers. e airliner‚Äôs 
$10 billion 
development 
suÔ¨Äered from 
more than two 
years of delays, 
coÔ¨Üing the 
company orders 
and credibility. 
Regardless, the 
versatility of 
Boeing‚Äôs airplane 
has intereÔ¨Üed a 
Ô¨Üeady Ô¨Üream of 
buyers. e 
Dreamliner‚Äôs 
small size, quick 
Ô¨Çight-turnaround 
times and fuel 
economy account 
for its sales 
advantage over  
the A380. With 
a maiden Ô¨Çight 
under its belt in 
December 2009 
and a crucial wing 
teÔ¨Ü passed in 
March, Boeing 
could deliver its 
Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü 787 by the 
end of this year.

ScientiÔ¨Üs long believed that places without 
oxygen could not permanently hoÔ¨Ü life more 
complicated than viruses or baeria. But a team 
of European researchers taking core samples from 
the 11,000-foot-deep L‚ÄôAtalante basin in the

When English physiciÔ¨Ü  
William Crookes Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü discov-
ered plasma in 1879, he did not 
propose any use for the Ô¨ÜuÔ¨Ä. 
Crookes found that he could make 
gas behave diÔ¨Äerently than other 
forms of matter by Ô¨Üripping 
elerons from it with elerodes. 
What we now call plasma is used in 
arc-welding torches, neon signs and 
high-end television screens. 
ScientiÔ¨Üs are Ô¨Üill Ô¨Ånding novel ways 
to manipulate plasma. For example, 
Jamey Jacob, an aerospace 
engineer from Oklahoma State 
University, has replaced mechanical 
parts on the wings of aircra with 
arrays of tiny auators. e 
auators form  jets of plasma (right) 
that can speed up airÔ¨Çow across the 
surface to increase li or, if the 
plumes are pointed into the airÔ¨Çow, 
increase drag. Jacob is teÔ¨Üing  
the syÔ¨Üem on small unmanned 
aerial vehicles.

A worldwide spate of earthquakes this year demonÔ¨Ürated that preparedness 
makes the diÔ¨Äerence between a disaÔ¨Üer and a cataÔ¨Ürophe. So how would U.S. 
buildings fare in the next big quake? e answer begins with the U.S. Geological Survey‚Äôs 
hazard maps, which gauge the probability and intensity of future earthquakes. StatiÔ¨Üi-
cians combine global seismic readings of faults with hiÔ¨Üoric records and soil conditions, 
then plot the data to a probability curve. ‚Äúis allows them to forecaÔ¨Ü future ground 
motions,‚Äù USGS seismic hazard mapping chief Mark Petersen says. To meet the 
International Building Code, a Ô¨Üruure muÔ¨Ü be able to withÔ¨Üand two-thirds of the force 
of an earthquake with a 2 percent chance of occurring in 50 years (see map, below). It‚Äôs 
up to local oÔ¨Écials to adopt these provisions and ensure that builders follow them.

It‚Äôs called a heavy drop: e 
military parachutes heavy 
equipment out of an airplane and into a 
war zone. For the Ô¨Ålmmakers behind 
e A-Team, released June 11, it was 
the perfe way to end the prison break 
of four ex‚ÄìSpecial Forces operatives 
wrongly accused of a crime. e 
complicated sequence called for a 
C-130J military transport aircra 
holding a tank-like Armored Gun 
SyÔ¨Üem (AGS) to explode, ejeing the 
machine at an altitude of 20,000 feet. 
e AGS then deploys three para-
chutes, but two are shredded by bullet 
Ô¨Åre from MQ-9 Reaper UAVs, leaving 
the vehicle in near free-fall. 
e art department began by pulling 
together the visual elements for its AGS, 
the never-deployed M8. ‚ÄúDireor Joe 
Carnahan chose it because it was 
designed to be an air-droppable vehicle,‚Äù 
visual-eÔ¨Äes supervisor James Price 
says. Next, designers built a full-scale 
exterior replica‚Äîcomplete with working 
machine gun‚Äîthat aor Bradley 
Cooper could a againÔ¨Ü on-set. 
Animators at Los Angeles‚Äìbased VFX 
house Rhythm & Hues built the digital 
M8 using the art department‚Äôs 
reference and photos of the replica. e 
digital vehicle had multiple moving 
parts, including a rotating turret and a 
hatch that opened and closed. In some 
cases, Ô¨Ålmmakers le the on-set replica 
in the shots, but usually they replaced it 
with the computer model.  ‚ÄúAll that‚Äôs 
real in moÔ¨Ü shots is Bradley and the 
gun he‚Äôs Ô¨Åring,‚Äù  Price says. Animators 
also watched a video of dragÔ¨Üers to 
determine how the parachutes would 
behave under extreme forces. 
ough visual-eÔ¨Äes artiÔ¨Üs Ô¨Üudied 
footage of aual drops, this isn‚Äôt an 
authentic scenario. ‚ÄúWhen the military 
does a real drop, they don‚Äôt do it from a 
high altitude,‚Äù Price says. ‚ÄúAnd they have 
an extraion chute that inÔ¨Çates and 
pulls the obje out of the plane. at 
wasn‚Äôt appropriate for us because our 
plane was blowing up, so we took some 
liberties to tell our Ô¨Üory.‚Äù Animators 
even altered the altitude and velocity at 
which the M8 fell from shot to shot. ‚ÄúIf it 
looked good falling at terminal velocity, 
we did that,‚Äù Price says. ‚ÄúBut if it looked 
better falling at 200 mph, then we did 
that too. As long as the audience 
believes it‚Äôs all one thing, we can cheat a 
lot to make it more dramatic.‚Äù

 When it came out four 
years ago, the Nintendo 
Wii‚Äôs motion-sensing 
controller seemed 
revolutionary. Today, it  
juÔ¨Ü seems dated. e  
 Sony PlayStation Move  
 Controller (price not  
 set) , which arrives this 
fall, picks up where the  
Wii le oÔ¨Ä. Like the Wii,  
the PS3-speciÔ¨Åc controller 
detes movement and 
relative position. Where it 
trumps the older tech:  
It can also pinpoint the  
precise location of the 
controller in relation to  
the TV. e secret is a 
TV-mounted camera that 
tracks a glowing orb 
jutting from the tip of  
the controller. In teÔ¨Üs, 
onscreen motion mimicry 
was inÔ¨Üant and accurate. 
And while there will surely 
be plenty of Move-speciÔ¨Åc 
games, the key to the 
controller catching on 
could be Sony‚Äôs willingness 
to integrate optional  
Move compatibility with 
big-budget blockbuÔ¨Üers. 
While the controller will 
have the ability to enhance 
these games, owning it  
will not be a prerequisite 
for playing them.

Honda CR-Z
Not Quite a CRX
e model name of the 2011 Honda 
CR-Z could double as a psychological 
diagnosis. Is it a sport coupe? Is it a fuel-
eÔ¨Écient hybrid? Americans will Ô¨Ånd out 
Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ühand when the car goes on sale in 
the U.S. late this summer. Aer our Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü 
drive, we can say for sure that while the 
two-passenger CR-Z looks like a 
reincarnated CRX coupe, it doesn‚Äôt 
quite match that car‚Äôs frisky behavior.  
Residing between the 1.5-liter gas 
engine and the six-speed manual or CVT, 
an eleric motor seamlessly assiÔ¨Üs 
acceleration, regenerates power while 
braking and smoothly reÔ¨Üarts the 
engine at traÔ¨Éc lights. Altogether, the 
powertrain delivers 122 hp and 128 
lb- of torque (123 lb- with the 
optional CVT) to the front wheels, 
moving the 2700-pound car to 60 mph 
in under 10 seconds and to a top speed 
of 124 mph. at‚Äôs not exaly sporty. 
Even more disappointing is that it‚Äôs not 
especially fuel-frugal either. Honda 
eÔ¨Üimates mpg in the mid-30s, which is 
less than the far more praical Civic 
hybrid. Plus, it‚Äôll coÔ¨Ü slightly more than 
the $20,510 Insight. Honda‚Äôs done a 
terriÔ¨Åc job integrating the hybrid 
syÔ¨Üem‚Äîthe brakes lack the typical 
hybrid‚Äôs numbness‚Äîbut aer our quick 
spin we were le wondering if Honda‚Äôs 
as confused about this car‚Äôs mission as 
we are.  ‚Äî ANDREW ENGLISH
CRUZING ALONG
e Cruze is proof 
that Chevy has Ô¨Ånally 
gotten serious about 
small cars. On a 
recent drive at GM‚Äôs 
Milford Proving 
Ground, the Cruze‚Äôs 
overall reÔ¨Ånement 
was simply aÔ¨Üonish-
ing, beÔ¨Üing its main 
competitors, the 
Honda Civic and 
Toyota Corolla. e 
Cruze is built on GM‚Äôs 
new Delta architec-
ture, which also 
underpins the 
upcoming Volt. It 
boaÔ¨Üs generous 
interior dimensions, 
10 Ô¨Üandard airbags,  
and available goodies 
such as a navigation 
syÔ¨Üem and heated 
seats. Underhood, 
there are two 
available engines,  
a base 138-hp 
1.8-liter and a turbo 
1.4-liter with the 
same power but more 
torque. Auto and 
manual transmissions 
sport six ratios. A fuel-
economy special‚Äî
dubbed Eco‚Äîuses 
lightweight Volt 
hardware, shutters 
that block the grille 
and decrease drag, 
and a gearbox with 
tall ratios to achieve 
40 mpg. All models 
feel solid, and the 
turbo motor oÔ¨Äers 
satisfyingly prompt 
throttle response.  
It should Ô¨Üart at  
around 15 grand.

Teutonic Titan
When it arrives in showrooms later this year, 
buyers in the luxury SUV market will Ô¨Ånd the 
2011 BMW X5 worth more than a passing 
glance, and not juÔ¨Ü because of its reÔ¨Üyled front 
fascia. Visual cues are subtle, but prospeive 
cuÔ¨Üomers who teÔ¨Ü-drive the new X5 will easily 
diÔ¨Äerentiate it from the 2010 model. Aive 
Ô¨Üeering and damping syÔ¨Üems Ô¨Üill impart 
Ô¨Üability and surprising agility to this big Bimmer. 
But the news is that the base X5 xDrive35i 
($46,675) now uses a 3.0-liter inline Six with a 
quick-spooling single turbocharger to deliver 300 
hp and 300 lb- of torque to all four wheels. 
Upgrade to the X5 xDrive50i ($59,275) and a 
twin-turbo, 4.4-liter dire-inje V8 adds 100 hp 
and 150 lb- of torque. e excellent 3.0-liter 
twin-turbo diesel with 425 lb- of torque remains 
an option. anks in large part to a more elaÔ¨Üic 
eight-speed automatic transmission, BMW claims 
the 2011 X5 gets 10 percent better fuel 
economy than laÔ¨Ü year‚Äôs model. e result is a 
faÔ¨Ü, conÔ¨Ådence-inspiring SUV that goes easier on 
the gas yet retains driving dynamics that belie its 
seven-seat praicality.  ‚Äî JAMES TATE

THE LIGHTEST LAMBO 
As Lamborghini‚Äôs lateÔ¨Ü 
track-oriented 
trash-talker, the Gallardo 
LP 570-4 Superleggera 
says a mouthful. Aside 
from extraing 10 extra 
hp over the base LP 
560-4‚Äîthe V10 now 
makes 562 ponies‚Äîthe 
weight-loss regimen 
includes carbon-Ô¨Åber 
replacement parts, a 
lightened interior, 
polycarbonate windows 
and forged-aluminum 
wheels attached with 
titanium bolts. Carbon- 
ceramic brakes are 
optional. All told, the 
Superleggera weighs 
3241 pounds, 154 less 
than the base car.
And does it ever move. 
StiÔ¨Äer shocks, Ô¨Üouter 
antiroll bars and  
90 percent harder 
bushings make the 
Superleggera corner like 
a slot car. It‚Äôll hit 62 mph 
in 3.4 seconds, with a 
deeply satisfying wailing 
engine note. Lambor-
ghini‚Äôs e-gear auto mated 
gearbox is Ô¨Üandard,  
but a gated six-speed 
manual can be 
subÔ¨Üituted for free. We 
doubt, however, that

exotic will fully 
appreciate a no-coÔ¨Ü

Scheduled for produion in 
Chicago in late 2011, the Ford 
Police Interceptor is based on 
the new Ford Taurus and will be 
available with front- or all-wheel 
drive. No longer available with a 
V8, it will inÔ¨Üead use Ford‚Äôs 
twin-turbocharged EcoBooÔ¨Ü 
V6, which delivers 365 hp and 
350 lb- while achieving a 
respeable 25 mpg on the 
highway (a 3.5-liter 263-hp V6 
will also be available for meter 
maids). e shortcomings are 
literally that: e 112.9-inch 
wheelbase is shorter than 
competitors‚Äô, which translates 
to relatively tight quarters 
inside. For extra utility, however, 
Ford will introduce a police-
ready SUV later this year.  
e front-wheel-drive Impala 
will soon be phased out of 
police Ô¨Çeets to make way for a 
new rear-wheel-drive Chevrolet 
Caprice, a model that once Ô¨Ålled 
police Ô¨Çeets. Built on GM‚Äôs Zeta 
sedan platform by AuÔ¨Üralian 
subsidiary Holden, the Caprice 
will initially feature a 355-hp 
6.0-liter V8 with 384 lb- of 
torque. It should catapult the 
car to 60 mph in less than 6 
seconds. A less brawny 256-hp 
3.6-liter V6‚Äîfrom the Cadillac 
CTS‚Äîwill become available in 
2012. Chevy plans to oÔ¨Äer an 
undressed undercover version, 
but since the Caprice will not be 
available to the general public, it 
will only be incognito to non‚Äì 
car aÔ¨Åcionados. 
Already available, the 
rear-wheel-drive Dodge Charger 
is currently the Crown Vic‚Äôs 
main competitor.  Equipped 
much like an R/T consumer 
version, a police Charger comes 
with either a 3.5-liter 250-hp V6 
or a 5.7-liter Hemi V8 that 
develops 368 hp and gives the 
Charger nameplate a certain 
truth in advertising. With the 
Hemi, it‚Äôll scoot to 60 mph in 
about 6 seconds and hang with 
perps all the way to 149 mph.  
Black wheels wrapped with 
wide, meaty tires and Ô¨Üandard 
Ô¨Üability control mean the 
Dodge can also hang in the 
curves. anks to cylinder 
deaivation, the Hemi Charger 
returns 16/25 mpg.
e E7 cop car from newcomer 
Carbon Motors features 
rear-hinged doors that make it 
easy to get uncooperative 
passengers in and out. 
Scheduled for assembly in 
2012 in Connersville, Ind., the 
E7‚Äôs aluminum frame is draped 
with composite panels to 
minimize weight. is 
purpose-built patroller uses an 
eÔ¨Écient 3.0-liter inline 
six-cylinder BMW diesel engine 
to generate over 400 lb- of 
torque and maximize mileage 
(eÔ¨Üimated at 30 mpg highway). 
e company believes it can 
dramatically decrease fuel bills, 
a goal it muÔ¨Ü achieve‚Äîcarbon-
Ô¨Åber bodies and aluminum 
frames don‚Äôt come cheap.

Mazda Diesel
At the New York Auto Show, Mazda announced 
that it will sell a new diesel engine in the U.S. in 
two years. While we wait, we took a spin in a 
CX-7 diesel that‚Äôs already available in Europe. 
e current 2.2-liter turbodiesel is diÔ¨Äerent from 
the upcoming version, but we Ô¨Üill learned a few 
things. For one, torque is your friend. With 295 
lb- available at juÔ¨Ü 2000 rpm, the CX-7 diesel 
pulls eÔ¨Äortlessly in any gear. As with other 
modern diesels, there‚Äôs no exhauÔ¨Ü smoke or 
smell, and the grumbling engine note is hardly 
intrusive. e U.S. version should only improve 
these traits and will not require a urea-injeion 
syÔ¨Üem to reduce oxides of nitrogen, thanks to a 
new catalyÔ¨Ü. Mazda has only hinted that the 
U.S. diesel will be a midsize car‚Äîprobably the

tests that showed the average car in 
the 1930s was 30 percent more aero-
dynamic going backward. 
Besides its streamlined shape, the 
new AirÔ¨Çow tried to sell safety, but auto 
safety just didn‚Äôt sell cars back then. 
Most auto ads in that era were not 
instructional. They were poetic, like 
the 1923 ad for the Jordan Playboy 
that appeared in e Saturday Evening 
Post. The illustrated ad, titled ‚ÄúSome-
where WeÔ¨Ü of Laramie,‚Äù mentions little 
about the Jordan‚Äôs mechanical attri-
butes, but describes how a Ô¨Üylish cow-
girl‚Äîwho‚Äôs taming a bucking horse‚Äî
would Ô¨Ånd kinship with the Playboy. Or 
the famous ‚ÄúHe Drives a Duesenberg‚Äù 
ad, where they never even showed the 
car and instead featured an obviously 
wealthy man seated in a private library. 
ack in its day, my 1934 Chrysler Imperial CX 
AirÔ¨Çow was considered unattraive, which was a 
painful surprise to the Chrysler engineers and 
designers. This styling and engineering master-
piece represented Chrysler‚Äôs moonshot at great-
ness. The company broke from that era‚Äôs tradi-
tional design‚Äîflat-front radiators, big fenders, 
separated headlights and imposing, squared-off 
bodies‚Äîin favor of a more rounded shape com-
bined with several engineering innovations. 
Yet it was a sales disaÔ¨Üer. 
It‚Äôs hard to sell something before its time, and 
car buyers simply weren‚Äôt ready for the AirÔ¨Çow‚Äôs 
slick shape. 
The Airflow owes its existence to Carl Breer, 
one of Chrysler‚Äôs moÔ¨Ü celebrated engineers (the 
others were Fred Zeder and Owen Skelton). Breer 
spent six years researching and developing the 
revolutionary car. In consultation with aviation 
pioneer Orville Wright, he condued wind-tunnel

and Ô¨Üep on the clutch, and fourth gear 
automatically engages. Like the 
Duesenberg, it‚Äôs one of the few cars 
from the ‚Äò30s that you can drive 70 
mph on the freeway and not feel 
rushed or pushed. And you know it‚Äôs 
aerodynamic, because there‚Äôs virtually 
no wind noise. 
For years, nobody wanted AirÔ¨Çows. 
Prices were quite reasonable, and Ô¨Üill 
are to this day. ere‚Äôs an AirÔ¨Çow club 
that‚Äôs very active. But not many cars 
survive. Chrysler sold only 11,292 Air-
flows in 1934, and just 67 were CX 
CuÔ¨Üom Imperial eight-passenger limos 
like mine. They designed a new hood 
and a conventional grille for the 1935 
models to make them look more like 
the other cars on the road, but it was 
all for naught, and produion ended in 
1937 aer only four years. 
Which just goes to show that it‚Äôs 
hard to sell something before its time. 
The Airflow was a complete change 
from its predecessor, and the styling 
was so extreme that people were really 
shocked. To them this round thing 
looked like something from another 
planet. It still does. The 1933 Chrysler 
Imperial resembled a Duesenberg or a 
Packard. In 1934, the new Airflow 
looked like a giant jellybean.
And that‚Äôs why I like it.
FC
It was all about lifeÔ¨Üyle. 
In contrast, Chrysler produced a 
widely viewed promotional film that 
showed an AirÔ¨Çow being pushed over 
the side of a cliff. When it landed, the 
reinforced roof hadn‚Äôt collapsed, all  
the doors still opened, and a guy got 
in it and drove it away. It had survived 
a crash that would probably have 
demolished other cars of the era, 
which still used wood in their bodies. 
e AirÔ¨Çow had many other safety fea-
tures. Its Ô¨Üeering col-
umn goes right into 
the dashboard‚Äînot 
between the clutch 
and brake pedals‚Äî
so the shaft doesn‚Äôt 
interfere with the 
driver‚Äôs feet. e body 
had 40 times the 
rigidity of previous 
Chryslers; a strong 
tubular frame meant 
you were essentially 
driving in a Ô¨Üeel cage. 
Other innovations 
included wraparound windshields on 
the top-line CWs, but they were hard to 
inÔ¨Üall and many broke on the assembly 
line. Before air conditioning, carmakers 
tried to get lots of air circulating 
through the cabin. The vent and side 
windows open, and at the flip of a 
switch the entire frame goes down. 
Even the windshield cranks open. You 
can get a lot of air Ô¨Çowing through this 
car and Ô¨Üay quite cool. 
e passenger compartment has so 
many art deco touches, it looks like 
you‚Äôre sitting in the Chrysler Building in 
New York. It had such wide, upright 
seats that Chrysler had to produce 
them on a special assembly line. The 
front-engine layout locates all occu-
pants optimally between the front and 
rear axles. The chassis was designed 
with long, so leaf springs that provide 
an incredibly comfortable ride. Chrysler, 
which did anything it could to get pro-
speive buyers to go for a convincing 
teÔ¨Ü drive, called it the Floating Ride. 
My Imperial AirÔ¨Çow is wonderful to 
drive‚Äîmore like a car from the 1940s 
or early 1950s than the ‚Äô30s, due to its 
smooth ride. It came with a 323.5-cid, 
130-bhp Ô¨Üraight Eight and automatic 
overdrive. You li oÔ¨Ä the gas at 38 mph

loating through the air 200 feet above the 
ground, I glide past a cluster of buildings, a 
stand of trees, the shoreline of a shimmering 
bay. A golf driving range drifts into view. Four 
men stop swinging their clubs and stare up, 
open-mouthed. In an age that‚Äôs jaded by wall-to-
wall entertainment, they‚Äôre experiencing an all-
too-rare sensation: pure awe. A giant oval shadow 
moves over them, and I‚Äôm gone.
If the guys at the golf club think a low pass by 
a 246-foot airship is impressive, they should 
check out the view from the pilot‚Äôs seat. That‚Äôs 
where I am, getting Ô¨Çight training in a zeppelin. 
It‚Äôs an incredibly rare privilege. There are fewer 
licensed zeppelin pilots in the United States 
than there are Supreme Court justices. And there 
is only one zeppelin airship in the country.
For most people, the word zeppelin evokes 
one indelible image: the Hindenburg‚Äôs Ô¨Çaming 
crash in 1937. That catastrophe struck the death 
knell for commercial airship travel, but the 
Luftschiffbau Zeppelin company, which owned 
the doomed airship, hung in there. Out of the 
wreckage of postwar Germany, it prospered in a 
variety of ventures, among them selling and ser-
vicing Cater pillar construction equipment. Then 
it got back in the airship business, 
launching a helium-filled model 
called the Zeppelin NT (for ‚Äúnew tech-
nology‚Äù) in 1997. Since then, the com-
pany has built three more airships, 
now Ô¨Çying in Japan and Europe.
To see the American zeppelin up 
close, I travel to San Francisco, where 
a company called Airship Ventures 
operates the Zeppelin NT Eureka. 
Mostly, Eureka earns its keep by carry-
ing passengers on short sightseeing 
jaunts. A year ago, however, the com-
pany also began offering zeppelin-
piloting classes. Customers who have 
a private pilot‚Äôs license can spend two 
days learning about the zeppelin, 
including 3 hours riding as a passen-
ger and a half-hour as the pilot.
At noon on a sunny Monday, I arrive 
at the front gate of Moffett Field, a 
 former Navy base. I go to a classroom

with Ô¨Åve other students and chief pilot 
Fritz G√ºnther, a severe-looking former 
Ô¨Çight instructor in the East German air 
force who introduces us to Eureka‚Äôs 
basic principles. He explains that a 
Zeppelin NT is designed to fly a bit 
heavier than air, which makes it easier 
to handle on the ground (airships of 
the Hindenburg era required hundreds 
of men to hold them down). To get off 
the ground, the zeppelin is equipped 
with propellers that can swivel up and 
down to provide vertical thrust. Then, 
when the ship is in the air and moving 
at speed, it shifts into ‚ÄúÔ¨Çight conÔ¨Ågu-
ration,‚Äù in which the engines swivel to 
horizontal. In effect, the highly maneu-
verable Zeppelin NT is a cross between 
a dirigible and a tilt-rotor aircraft like 
the V-22 Osprey.
The next morning we Ô¨Ånally get to 
climb aboard. Inside, the gondola is 
spacious, more like the interior of a 
yacht than an aircraft. It feels like a 
yacht too‚Äîeven on the ground, the 
gondola‚Äôs slow rolling motion reminds 
me of an ocean swell. The Ô¨Årst student 
straps into the pilot‚Äôs seat, with 
G√ºnther in the co-pilot‚Äôs chair to his 
right. The engines increase in pitch. 
Smoothly, we begin to rise vertically 
into the air. We start to move forward 
as well, as though ascending a giant 
escalator. The expanse of the airÔ¨Åeld 
falls away, and soon we are coasting 
along at 1000 feet over Silicon Valley.
Those of us who aren‚Äôt at the con-
trols roam around the gondola, admir-
ing the view. The windows slope 
outward, so we can look straight down 
and watch the scenery scroll beneath 
our feet. I open a window and stick my 
head out into the 40-mph slipstream 
like a dog on a road trip. Mountains lie 
to the west, the bay to the east, all of it 
soft and gauzy in the morning‚Äôs linger-
ing haze. As an Airship Ventures staffer 
hands out snacks and drinks, I feel like 
I‚Äôm at a party that happens to be dan-
gling a quarter-mile up.
Eureka returns to the airÔ¨Åeld and 
touches down; now it‚Äôs my turn. I strap 
in and put on a headset. Almost imme-
diately I‚Äôm struggling to keep up as 
G√ºnther talks me through the con-
trols. There are so many of them. One 
lever controls the angle of the two for-
ward propellers; a nearby pair changes 
their thrust. A joystick on my left-hand 
side commands the rear propellers to 
pitch the nose up and down or to yaw 
side-to-side. On top of that, there are 
numerous switches and levers and 
toggles to control the pressure of the 
helium and the distribution of ballast. 
Helpfully, G√ºnther tells me what to 
do; if I‚Äôm too slow, he reaches over and 
moves the control himself.
Up we go, climbing and gaining for-
ward speed. I focus on the stick as I try 
to keep the enormous lumbering craft 
under control. With three engines, 
four propellers and a bag of helium gas 
whose buoyancy constantly changes 
depending on the temperature and 
pressure, piloting the zeppelin is like 
Ô¨Çying an airplane and making a scuba 
dive at the same time. As I try to Ô¨Ågure 
it all out, Eureka bucks and weaves 
through the California sky like a spas-
tic humpback whale.
As we reach 25 mph, G√ºnther 
switches the ship to Ô¨Çight conÔ¨Ågura-
tion. Now we‚Äôre using the Ô¨Åns, not the 
engines, to control the ship‚Äôs motion. 
I‚Äôm starting to get the hang of it.  
Part of the trick is to Ô¨Çy the zeppelin 
like you‚Äôd steer a sailboat, anticipat-
ing corrections by a few seconds. But  
I still can‚Äôt seem to stop the ship  
from unexpectedly rearing up or shift-
ing to one side. ‚ÄúRemember, it‚Äôs not 
just you moving the ship,‚Äù G√ºnther 
says. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got air currents and lift 
from thermals.‚Äù
I keep trying. Precision Ô¨Çying, this 
is not. But I‚Äôve reached my moment of 
Zen: No matter how badly I fly this 
thing, it‚Äôs still going to keep bobbing 
along. You can‚Äôt Ô¨Çip a zeppelin upside 
down; you can‚Äôt dive-bomb it into the 
earth. The ship is inherently stable. 
That‚Äôs comforting to know. And the 
golfers below certainly seem more 
than impressed.
My time is almost up. I head back 
toward the airÔ¨Åeld and start coaxing 
Eureka down, angling the thrusters 
forward and back, toggling the throt-
tle, easing us slowly toward the tarmac 
and the waiting ground crew. A few 
yards off the ground, the ship hangs, 
hesitant, then a nudge of thrust brings 
the front wheel down. The crew grabs 
a line hanging from the nose, and 
we‚Äôre back on the ground. I unstrap 
and climb out of the pilot‚Äôs seat, still 
feeling lighter than air.

 Evolution of an 
 Invention: the 
 Leatherman 
e now-iconic 
multifunion tool 
Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü found 
physical form as  
a series of 
cardboard cutouts  
(A) that inventor 
Tim Leatherman 
fashioned in the 
mid-1970s. He 
then migrated to 
wood carvings 
with integrated 
metal parts. 
Leatherman 
began to reÔ¨Åne his 
idea with a metal 
milling machine. 
He experimented 
with several 
versions of 
dual-funion plier 
jaws (B). ‚ÄúI was 
trying to make 
needle jaws pivot 
out of regular 
pliers,‚Äù he says. 
‚ÄúIt was painÔ¨Üak-
ing, because I 
have to make 
things to Ô¨Ågure 
out how they 
should work.‚Äù 
e prototype 
that Leatherman 
patented (C) 
combined his dual-
aion pliers with 
an integrated 
locking-clamp 
feature. Every 
knife- and 
tool maker he 
approached 
rejeed it.
He continued to 
add to the design, 
working in 
scissors and 
reÔ¨Åning the jaw 
mechanism (D). 
But it was 
feedback from a 
mail-order catalog 
company that 
convinced him to 
Ô¨Üreamline the 
tool‚Äîsimplifying 
the pliers and 
ditching the 
scissors and 
clamp to  
reduce coÔ¨Ü. 


SPIRIT OF INVENTION: 
A CULTURE OF CREATIVITY 
HAS INSPIRED 220 YEARS OF 
PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERING 
AND BASEMENT TINKERING.
MakerBot Industries sells small 
computer-controlled desktop fabs for the 
masses. The CupCake CNC kit costs only 
$750 and can print small 3D objects.
simply see life‚Äôs many obstacles dif-
ferently than the average person, 
according to medical-devices inven-
tor Robert Fischell. ‚ÄúThe key to 
inventing is the awareness that a 
problem is the trigger from which an 
invention can be created,‚Äù says Fisch-
ell, who holds more than 200 patents 
for innovations such as an implant-
able cardiac defibrillator and 
improved stents. ‚ÄúWhen I‚Äôm in the 
operating room and a surgeon throws 
a tool against the wall in frustration, I 
say, ‚ÄòGreat, here‚Äôs an opportunity.‚Äô‚Äù 
Fischell, who at the height of his 
career Ô¨Åled a new patent application 
every six weeks, wastes no time in 
determining whether his latest idea 
meets the patent test of being new, 
useful and nonobvious. He goes right 
to the U.S. Patent and Trademark 
Office‚Äôs database of issued patents 
(patft.uspto.gov) and performs a 
search. ‚ÄúIf you read a patent and 
above Tim Leatherman‚Äôs head 
clicked on while he was touring 
Eastern Europe on the cheap in 1975. Desperate for a way to turn a stripped radi-
ator handle in his freezing hotel room, the 27-year-old, unemployed, newly mar-
ried mechanical engineer looked long and hard at the overmatched Boy Scout‚Äì
issue knife in his hand. 
‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt it be something if I could add a pair of pliers to a pocketknife?‚Äù he 
asked himself. Fast-forward 35 years and 40 million multitools sold, and today 
Tim Leatherman embodies the dream of Ô¨Ånancial and creative freedom that 
motivates independent inventors everywhere. The Portland, Ore.‚Äìbased com-
pany bearing Leatherman‚Äôs name employs 500 people and dominates a $200 
million worldwide market for pocket tools that he pioneered. 
The tool was hardly an overnight sensation. Years of experimentation, false 
starts, dead ends, rejection and frustration marked Leatherman‚Äôs course. Look-
ing back, he claims he wasn‚Äôt even an especially visionary inventor and, at the 
outset, knew ‚Äúnothing about business, sales or Ô¨Ånance.‚Äù Not that it stopped him. 
Passionate, persistent inventors like Leatherman, set on seeing their creations 
take wing, have been a driving force in the American economy since our nation‚Äôs 
founding. Our country‚Äôs penchant for innovation is partly the result of U.S. patent 
law, which was designed to encourage and protect inventors. But it also reÔ¨Çects a 
national character inclined toward problem-solving and risk-taking. 
For much of the 220 years since George Washington signed off on the Ô¨Årst 
patent, individual inventors, not to be confused with their corporate and institu-
tional brethren, have been the engine of American industry‚Äîmavericks like 
Edison, Bell and Carrier. Their breakthroughs banished darkness, projected 
human voices across hundreds of miles and cooled the sizzling Sun Belt. Trace 
back the roots of many blue-chip companies, and you are sure to Ô¨Ånd a solitary 
inventor who once had a transformative idea. 
The drive to invent is more powerful than ever, but the road isn‚Äôt always easy 
for independent inventors. Out of the 77,501 U.S. utility patents granted in 2008, 
just 6 percent went to individuals. Only a third of applications at the U.S. Patent 
and Trademark OfÔ¨Åce (USPTO) even earn a patent, and among patents granted, 
the number that become commercially viable ranges from an estimated 5 per-
cent to as low as 0.2 percent. That‚Äôs a lot of wreckage left by the side of the road.     
Who wins and who loses at the high-stakes game of invention can seem arbi-
trary. And yet our economy is studded with examples of innovators who, like 
Leatherman, have launched one successful product after another into an unfor-
giving marketplace. We consulted with a number of professional inventors to 
distill the secrets of the craft. Some have made careers out of invention, others 
have founded industries. Their consensus: No shortcut exists to success, and 
nothing substitutes for grit and determination. So, if you‚Äôre sitting on an idea 
that might be the next great American invention, here‚Äôs your playbook. 
The annals of invention are studded with one-hit wonders, inventors whose 
single blockbuster idea made them a fortune. But the most proliÔ¨Åc inventors 
can‚Äôt turn off the idea machine. They are too restless and creative. Inventors 

Sometimes a happy accident, not necessity, is the mother of 
invention. Lonnie Johnson, creator of the Super Soaker (he‚Äôs 
holding one of his prototypes above), came up with his invention 
while he was working on a heat pump that used water instead of 
Freon. ‚ÄúIt shot a stream of water across the bathroom where I 
was doing the experiment,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI thought to myself, ‚ÄòThis 
would make a great water gun.‚Äô‚Äù
someone has already solved the problem, then you‚Äôre still an inventor. You just 
got there late,‚Äù he says. 
If, after a preliminary search, your idea proves novel, then continue develop-
ing it. But be realistic about what you‚Äôre getting into. ‚ÄúThe time you devote will 
be double what you think it will be, and the dollar amounts you commit will be 
four times what you thought,‚Äù Leatherman says.
Make rough sketches, perform tests, Ô¨Çesh out concepts and keep detailed 
notes. Patent attorneys advise their clients to maintain a log in a permanently 
bound notebook that gets stamped by a notary public on a frequent basis. A log-
book becomes important in cases before the U.S. Patent and Trademark OfÔ¨Åce 
involving identical innovations, as the burden of proof falls to patent applicants 
to demonstrate that they were the Ô¨Årst to conceive of an invention. 
At this early stage in the game, your investment of personal time and money 
will have been slight compared with what is around the bend. Before proceed-
ing, you‚Äôll have to ask some hard questions about both your idea and yourself: Is 
my idea signiÔ¨Åcantly different than any that precede it? Is there a sizable market 
for the product? Can it be developed and manufactured at reasonable cost? Who 
is the customer, and why should they buy my product and not a competitor‚Äôs? 
 
SOLO FLIGHTS OF FANCY
‚ÄúBe alone‚Äîthat is the secret of 
invention: Be alone, that is when ideas 
are born.‚Äù  ‚Äî Nikola Tesla, who invented 
the alternating-current motor
Inventors have 
traditionally 
turned their ideas 
into prototypes 
with plenty of 
sketches and 
endless iterations 
in wood, clay or 
metal. But the 
digital age has 
introduced a 
totally new 
toolkit. 
Computer-aided 
design (CAD) 
soware allows 
rapid and highly 
precise blueprint-
ing, computed 
numerical control 
(CNC) milling and 
routing equipment 
transfers that 
precision to the 
physical world, 
and 3D printers 
can create fully 
formed objes on 
demand. 
Plus, the coÔ¨Ü of 
both hardware 
and soware has 
fallen dramati-
cally. Free 
programs, such as 
BRL-CAD (which 
was developed by 
the military for 
weapons design) 
and Blender, can 
create 3D objes 
onscreen. 
Open-source 
invention 
organizations, 
such as NextFab 
Store and 
MakerBot, sell 3D 
desktop printers 
and kits through 
their websites, 
ranging from $750 
to $4175. 
Alternately, you 
can download 
plans from Fab@
Home for free and 
source the parts 
yourself.
But if you don‚Äôt 
want to own your 
own machine, look 
up local invention 
facilities such as 
TechShop, in 
Portland, Ore., and 
San Francisco; or 
NextFab Studio in 
Philadelphia. 
ese high-tech 
shops operate like 
neighborhood 
boxing gyms,

Gaining a patent 
requires money,

at the concept 
Ô¨Üage.
is is the biggeÔ¨Ü 
miÔ¨Üake I see. 
Inventors Ô¨Åle 
before they‚Äôve 
made their 
invention. I always 
ask them, have  
you tried it out? 
Have you made  
a prototype, 
preferably in 
secret? e

have to be pretty, 
but if you haven‚Äôt 
made one, you‚Äôre 
not ready.
 Filing a patent 
yourself.
New inventors 
lack objeivity 
and experience 
with the process. 
ey either make 
the claims too 
broad or too 
speciÔ¨Åc. A well- 
drawn claim is an 
abÔ¨Üraion that 
captures the 
essence of an 
invention to 
diÔ¨Üinguish it over 
prior art. You really 
need a patent 
attorney for that. 
 Failing to put 
enough detail in 
the patent.
e truth is, the 
more detail you 
put in, the broader 
the Ô¨Ånal patent 
will be. We 
front-load the 
process by writing 
And Ô¨Ånally, am I willing to commit myself fully to making this idea succeed?
Inventors who have been through the process caution not to underestimate 
the emotional and psychological fortitude required. ‚ÄúCan the invention fail and 
not the person?‚Äù asks Dean Kamen, inventor of numerous medical devices, the 
Segway and the iBOT all-terrain wheelchair. ‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt afford emotionally and 
intellectually to fail, if your ego would be wiped out, then don‚Äôt do it.‚Äù
With the availability of powerful computing 
and computer-assisted design software like 
Autodesk Inventor and SolidWorks 3D CAD, 
inventors today live in what Kamen refers to as 
‚Äúthe ultimate candy store.‚Äù The earliest versions 
of Kamen‚Äôs Ô¨Årst invention, a wearable infusion 
pump that delivers precise doses of medications 
such as insulin, sprang to life not on a computer 
screen but in a workshop set up in the basement 
of his parents‚Äô home on Long Island, N.Y. Kamen 
was a teenager at the time.
Even when designed in a highly precise digital 
CAD environment, a product eventually has to 
make the leap to the real world in the form of a 
prototype. For a sizable fee, specialty prototype 
Ô¨Årms translate drawings into molded plastic or 
steel. Or you might try your luck with a local 
machine shop. Depending on the materials 
involved and the complexity of an invention, the 
cost of making a quality prototype can empty a 
bank account and force an inventor to seek fund-
ing at a very early stage. 
Tim Leatherman advocates taking a DIY 
approach. During a trial-and-error phase lasting 
three years, he built prototypes of his ground-
breaking multitool from cardboard, wood and 
metal until he settled on an advanced 
design. ‚ÄúBy working with my hands,‚Äù 
he says, ‚ÄúI learned about obstacles to 
functionality and manufacturability.‚Äù
Once you have your prototype, it‚Äôs 
time to troubleshoot your invention. 
Dan Brown has more than 30 U.S. utility 
patents. One of them is for his Bionic Wrench (a 
sketch for the patent on his tool is seen here). 
The one-size-Ô¨Åts-all tool has six adjustable jaws 
that can grip on any hex nut as well as screws, 
nails, bolts and other stubborn fasteners. 

PATENTS ARE A VIRTUE

U.S. patent in 1790 for his improved 
method of making potash, George 
Washington himself presided.

 Assuming that 
a cheaper, easier, 
provisional 
patent will do.
Some inventors 
think that because 
a provisional 
patent doesn‚Äôt 
require the same 
technical detail  
as a formal 
application, they 
can write down a 
few words, add  
a sketch or two 
and their idea is 
proteed. A 
provisional 
application  
is garbage in, 
garbage out. In a

and try to make

 Getting 
discouraged by 
patent rejeion. 
I‚Äôd say 90 percent 
of the Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü Patent 
OÔ¨Éce aions are 
rejeions. We 
interpret that as 
the examiner 
saying, ‚ÄúYou 
haven‚Äôt convinced 
me yet. Explain 
again why your 
claimed invention 
is diÔ¨Äerent from 
prior art.‚Äù Your 
patent attorney 
will then 
negotiate with the 
examiner. MoÔ¨Ü of 
the time the 
second Patent 
OÔ¨Éce aion is an 
allowance.
Get outside your own head and go to 
experts in the Ô¨Åeld, Fischell recom-
mends. ‚ÄúAsk them, ‚ÄòDo you think my 
idea has commercial merit? Would 
you use it?‚Äô But make them sign a 
conÔ¨Ådentiality agreement,‚Äù he says. 
For inventors, the prospect of intel-
lectual property theft is very real, but 
too much caution can become immo-
bilizing. A conÔ¨Ådentiality, or nondis-
closure, agreement allows you to 
Ô¨Åeld-test in conÔ¨Ådence. 
Feedback from Mario Salazar‚Äôs 
target audience‚Äîcarpenters‚Äîcom-
pelled the Colorado Springs inventor 
to Ô¨Åne-tune his digital miter gauge. 
The mechanical prototype he built 
in the basement with a soldering 
iron, an oscilloscope and a milling 
machine picked up on eBay worked smoothly and felt right to Salazar, but the 
tradesmen wanted it bigger and more affordable. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt fall in love with 
your invention,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúGet feedback and make alterations accordingly.‚Äù
 
In the rough-and-tumble business world, a patent protects the inventor by 
granting the exclusive right to exclude others from making, using or selling his 
invention for a 20-year period. That‚Äôs the theory. In practice, a patent gives the 
inventor a head start against the wolf pack. ‚ÄúWhen other people see you making 
money, your patent will be the only means you have for maintaining control of 
the market,‚Äù says Lonnie Johnson, founder of Johnson ElectroMechanical Sys-
tems and inventor of the Super Soaker water gun. 
Patent law is complicated stuff, so get an experienced patent attorney to write 
and Ô¨Åle your patent application. Expect to pay between $3000 and $10,000. ‚ÄúHire 
a patent attorney who also has a degree in the Ô¨Åeld you‚Äôre applying for a patent 
in and who knows your market,‚Äù Salazar advises. 
A skilled lawyer can draft a broad patent that protects an invention against 
infringement from any angle. In the case of Richard Phillips, owner of Interna-
tional Survival, his well-crafted patent application made it impossible for any-
one to copy the thin, shock-absorbing material he developed for his protective 
paintball vest. ‚ÄúMy lawyer spread the patent out so far above and below my  
laminated foam material‚Äôs properties that a competitor‚Äôs vest would have to  
be so heavy the wearer couldn‚Äôt walk or so light that the vest falls apart when 
hit,‚Äù Phillips says. 
On average, patent approval takes three years and may require going back 
and forth several times with patent examiners. From the moment a patent appli-
cation arrives at the USPTO until it is either issued or abandoned, an invention 
is covered by patent-pending status. In the case of John Marsden, who invented 
Pour ‚ÄôN Store, a bartending system of plastic bottles and pour spouts for drink 
mixers, a pending patent amounted to a suit of paper armor. ‚ÄúOne company 
said, ‚ÄòIf you don‚Äôt sell us the patent we‚Äôre going to compete with you.‚Äô I didn‚Äôt 
have enough money to Ô¨Åght them in court. We eventually made a deal, and they 
paid me royalties for years.‚Äù
According to Salazar, any inventor has to be ready to do battle. Having a 
good lawyer in your corner is a must. ‚ÄúIf your idea‚Äôs good, then someone is 
going to steal it. If no one‚Äôs trying to steal it, then the idea‚Äôs probably no good,‚Äù 
he says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll have my lawyer send a cease-and-desist letter if someone infringes 
on my patent. If it continues, I give them the diplomatic option to buy a license 
from me. If diplomacy doesn‚Äôt work, then that‚Äôs when the money goes out  
the door in legal fees. And in the end, a patent is only as good as the thickness 
of your wallet.‚Äù 
Once the patent application is complete, the inventor must switch from 
building an idea to building a business. Rare is the creative genius behind an 
invention who also has the business chops‚Äîor the interest‚Äîto oversee the 
manufacture, marketing and selling of his creation. So even the brightest cre-
ative minds can fall victim to the numerous scams and questionable invention-
promotion Ô¨Årms whose ads litter the Internet. Most professional inventors urge 
caution with any outÔ¨Åt that asks for money up front to shop your ideas around.  
A safer route when you‚Äôre in the thickets is to Ô¨Ånd a partner whose skill set 
complements yours. Mario Salazar, a born salesman, teamed with Jay Burgan, 

APPLIED ORIGINALITY

It‚Äôs also 
important to 
focus on whom 
you‚Äôre trying to 
reach at the 
show. Bernardo

Ô¨Üring trimmer,

whenever you 
meet with 
somebody, 
you‚Äôve got to 
learn something. 
LiÔ¨Üen to their 
objeions.‚Äù

the show itself.

Leatherman accrued crucial know-how in business and 
manufacturing by joining with Steve Berliner. It didn‚Äôt hurt 
that Berliner‚Äôs dad owned a metalworking business. John 
Marsden, the Pour ‚ÄôN Store developer, partnered early on 
with business school graduate Ed Harrigan. ‚ÄúIf I hadn‚Äôt 
had Ed, I probably wouldn‚Äôt have made it,‚Äù he says.
With a solid business team set up, the next step is mar-
ket research and test marketing. Marketing studies‚Äîper-
form your own or commission a market research Ô¨Årm‚Äî
will give you data about market trends and customer 
demographics. There is no substitute, however, for putting 
your invention in front of potential customers as well as 
manufacturers, suppliers and distributors to get a sense of 
its market value. For the inventor, this is an anxious time. 
As Robert Fischell learned, thick skin helps. ‚ÄúFor many of 
the inventions I‚Äôve done, somebody always said, ‚ÄòIt‚Äôll never 
work.‚Äô I went to a famous doctor at a major medical center 
with one of my early stent designs. He told me there‚Äôs no future in stents. Well, 
that‚Äôs a $6 billion market now.‚Äù
Salazar is a big believer in showing your wares at trade shows. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll Ô¨Ånd out 
who is doing what, whether you‚Äôll be able to compete and if someone is willing 
to buy what you have,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre also dropping your drawers and every-
one will see what you‚Äôve got. Your product had better be 95 percent complete. Be 
ready to answer questions: How big is the market? Who‚Äôs going to buy it?‚Äù
 
Inventors make money in two ways: collecting royalties by licensing the right 
to manufacture their invention or manufacturing, distributing and marketing 
the invention themselves. Sooner or later, all successful inventors reach this 
fork in the road and must decide for themselves which route to pursue. Louis J. 
Foreman, founder and chief executive of Enventys, a product design and engi-
neering Ô¨Årm in Charlotte, N.C., and author of The Independent Inventor‚Äôs Hand-
book, has personally faced that dilemma multiple times as the holder of 10 pat-
ents and has advised numerous inventors as lead judge on the PBS program 
Everyday Edisons. ‚ÄúThe Ô¨Årst thing to do is build a pro forma income statement. 
Figure out what kind of revenue you could generate versus the overhead and 
expenses selling that product,‚Äù Foreman says. 
Then it‚Äôs time to ask yourself another round of questions: First, is there enough 
upside potential to merit the risk of bringing the product to market yourself? 
‚ÄúFactor in opportunity costs too,‚Äù Foreman says. ‚ÄúIf you have to give up a job that 
pays $100,000, can you make enough to offset that?‚Äù Second, do you have the 
Ô¨Ånancial resources to pull it off? If you don‚Äôt, then where is the money going to 
come from? And Ô¨Ånally, do you have the competence to run a business? ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one 
thing to come up with an amazing product, but are you comfortable selling it, can 
you distribute it, replenish it and fulÔ¨Åll orders if Walmart gives you a 5-million-
piece purchase order?‚Äù Foreman says.
There is no doubt that licensing is the easier route to getting an invention to 
market. It requires less devotion of time and up-front capital and frees inventors 
to do what they do best: invent. But expedience comes at a cost. Royalty rates on 
patents‚Äîformulated on list price, production run and other factors‚Äîaverage 
less than 2 to 7 percent of retail sales. Still, for a Ô¨Årst-time inventor short on 
A trade show can 
give a view of the 
competition and 
access to 
potential clients, 
but for an 
inexperienced 
inventor, it can be 
an obje lesson 
in chaos and 
expense. 
Aer attending 
a trade show 
with premature 
technology, 
Mario Salazar, 
inventor of the 
 ProMiter-100 
digital miter 
gauge, realized 
he couldn‚Äôt rush 
success. ‚ÄúYou 
know you‚Äôre not 
ready when you 
have to do some 
smoke and 
mirrors to get 
through the 
presentation,‚Äù 
Salazar says. So 
he Ô¨Åne-tuned  
the design, 
improving his 
gauge‚Äôs accuracy. 
At the next 
show, he sold  
the license. ‚ÄúIt 
was a much  
more Ô¨Ånished 
produ,‚Äù he 
 

Mario Salazar, who created his ProMiter-100 digital 
miter gauge when he couldn‚Äôt Ô¨Ånd a tool that could 
quickly make precisely angled cuts, has some words of 
caution for would-be inventors. ‚ÄúIf you think you‚Äôre 
the only one coming up with this idea, you‚Äôre wrong,‚Äù 
he says. ‚ÄúIf a big company comes up with the same 
idea, you‚Äôre gonna get left in the dust.‚Äù
funds and know-how, a licensing 
agreement can be the pot of gold at 
the end of the rainbow. 
Lonnie Johnson, who fashioned 
his Super Soaker prototypes using a 
Unimat hobby lathe and milling 
machine while moonlighting from 
his job at NASA‚Äôs Jet Propulsion Labo-
ratory, intended to manufacture his 
invention. Bids he received from 
injection molding companies quickly 
killed that idea. ‚ÄúWhen I learned it 
would cost $200,000 to make 1000 
guns, I decided to license,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI 
didn‚Äôt have that kind of money.‚Äù 
Today he does. Retail sales of the 
Super Soaker have exceeded $1 bil-
lion, and royalties have made John-
son a wealthy man. 
Manufacturing a product, on the 
other hand, is a leap into the 
unknown. To get started, you need to 
find investors for financing, then 
build relationships with potential 
manufacturers and distributors. 
Then there‚Äôs marketing, sales and 
management. It can be as much if not 
more work than you put into the 
development of the invention itself.  
But the potential proÔ¨Åts are far  higher 
than any license. 
Tim Leatherman was an acciden-
tal industrialist. His Ô¨Årst inclination 
after perfecting a functional proto-
type of his multitool was to shop it 
among knife companies with a licens-
ing arrangement in mind. ‚ÄúWhen 
knife companies took a look at the 
prototype, they said, ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs not a knife. That‚Äôs a tool.‚Äô So then I went to tool 
companies, and they said, ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs not a tool. That‚Äôs a gadget.‚Äô‚Äù
Leatherman began to get discouraged, and took a job as an outside salesman 
for a welding products company. He worked there for four years before Berliner, 
a friend from college, stepped in and said, ‚ÄúWe need to start our own company.‚Äù
Rejections continued to pile up.  They started shopping the invention around 
to mail-order catalogs, but got no yeses. Finally, they took it to a mail-order com-
pany out of Seattle. ‚ÄúAnd instead of just kicking us out the door,‚Äù says Leather-
man, ‚Äúthey sat us down and said: ‚ÄòHow can we make this less expensive?‚Äô‚Äù He 
and Berliner went back to the drawing board, simplifying the prototype in  
an effort to lower the manufacturing cost from $40 per unit to $24. Then they 
resolicited the catalog companies with their pared-down tool. 
‚ÄúLater we got a letter from Cabela‚Äôs,‚Äù Leatherman says. ‚ÄúInside was a pur-
chase order for $12,000 for 500 tools. You can‚Äôt believe how happy I was.‚Äù

HARLEY-DAVIDSON  
 Softail Rocker C
If anyone but the most well-versed motorcycle enthusiast 
caught an eyeful of the Harley Rocker from the rear, they‚Äôd swear 
it was a one-off custom chopper. From the little bullet taillights 
to that fender stretched tightly across the fat rear tire, this bike 
looks like it must have been welded together by a guy slathered 
in tattoos. That makes sense considering that more choppers 
over the past 65 years have been based on Harleys than on any 
other bike. So the boys in Milwaukee should know how it‚Äôs 
done; yet the Harley was the quirkiest of the four bikes here. 
Jesse James and Orange County Choppers who craft gorgeous, 
meticulously detailed rides‚Äîfor six-Ô¨Ågure price tags. Thanks 
to the tube, the popularity of this genre has skyrocketed, so 
naturally the mainstream manufacturers have jumped in. 
Nowadays, playing Hells Angel can be as easy as walking into a 
dealership. And trust us, this is a good thing. A radically cool, 
old-school custom chopper is typically terrible to ride. The 
raked-out forks make the bike tough to maneuver at low 
speeds and cranky on curvy roads. The steamroller-wide rear 
tire snugs tight to the seat with little or no suspension move-
ment. And the stretched handlebar position quickly tires 
shoulders. As in the world of high fashion, comfort and func-
tionality take a back seat to style. 
Thanks to solid engineering, combined with an eye for 
design, a factory-made custom dramatically reduces those 
annoy ances. Nor do these bikes empty wallets like a night in 
Vegas. None of the ones we tested‚Äîthe Victory Vegas Jackpot, 
the Harley-Davidson Softail Rocker C, the Yamaha Raider S and 
the Honda Fury‚Äîcosts more than 21 grand. 
We spent a week covering over 450 miles around Southern 
California on highways and back roads. In addition to our 
usual PM test crew, professional rider Danny Coe ran each 
bike through instrumented tests at Auto Club Speedway in 
Fontana, Calif. Instead of ranking the bikes in a finishing 
order, we rated the machines based on six categories  
that are listed in the speci fication boxes. One observation 
became abundantly clear: It‚Äôs never been so painless to cruise 
in high style. 
YAMAHA
 Raider S
The Yamaha Raider really straddles two genres‚Äîthe power 
cruiser and the custom chopper. Between the frame rails sits 
a massive and incredibly potent V-twin that Yamaha bor-
rowed from the Roadliner and the Stratoliner. With 106 lb-ft 
of peak torque, it‚Äôs phenomenally easy to reel in just about 
any car or bike on the road with a casual Ô¨Çick of the wrist.  
This thing is brutally quick and blasted through the quarter-
mile in only 12.34 seconds. Only the Victory was quicker‚Äîyet 
it costs over $5000 more. Despite the price difference, most 
thought the Yamaha‚Äôs engine was far more polished and 
sophisticated. The Raider doesn‚Äôt compromise function for 
Ô¨Çash. Indeed, this was the only bike here with twin front-disc 
brakes. The rear passenger pillion was the largest and most 
comfortable seat of this group. And the Yamaha was the only 
bike with a real fuel gauge. The Raider is a big and hefty 
bike‚Äî719 pounds‚Äîthat feels overweight only when you lift  
it off the side stand. With a low seat height and modestly  
sized tires, it‚Äôs surprisingly maneuverable at low speeds. In 
the canyons, the Raider is comfortable pushing speeds higher 
than most bikes in the test could achieve and was quite happy 
in the curves. Overall, it‚Äôs a well-rounded motorcycle. Tester 
Mike Allen said, ‚ÄúIf I had to pick one bike to ride across coun-
try, I‚Äôd pick the Yamaha.‚Äù Downsides? The Raider looks far 
too tame. Type ‚Äúcruiser motorcycle‚Äù into Google and the 
generic image would probably look a lot like the Raider. 
There‚Äôs just not enough uniqueness to this design. It‚Äôs a ter-
riÔ¨Åc bike to ride, but it lacks enough visual character and 
slightly misses the point of these bikes.

Unlike with the others, it feels as though you‚Äôre sitting on top of 
this bike, not nestled down deep behind that V-twin. Indeed, 
the Rocker tied for the tallest seat height of the group. And that 
Ô¨Årm seat was not the most comfortable for longer hauls. But 
once our testers got used to this riding position, the Harley was 
an easy bike to fall for. Despite its long wheelbase, it felt nimble 
around town and quick and eager on long, sweeping curves. 
The six-speed transmission shifts with a slickness and ease 
that bettered every bike here. And riders really appreciated the 
tall sixth gear for relaxed highway cruising as well as the lighted 
transmission gear display. Twist the right grip and run through 
a few gears, and Harley‚Äôs big 96-cubic-inch twin exhales with a 
deep, satisfying growl. But the Rocker‚Äôs bark was more aggres-
sive than its bite. It was about a second behind the Victory and 
the Yamaha on the dragstrip‚Äôs quarter-mile. On the open road, 
that performance gap felt much less signiÔ¨Åcant. Credit the 
Harley‚Äôs generous torque. The Harley looks the most like a true 
custom, but it‚Äôs also priced like one. At nearly $20,000, this is 
not an inexpensive machine. Still, if you yearn for that authen-
tic Harley-Davidson chopper experience in a reliable factory 
package, there‚Äôs only one choice.
VICTORY 
 Vegas Jackpot
The 2003 Vegas was arguably the Ô¨Årst factory-made custom, and 
it arrived with instant street cred because Victory enlisted 
motorcycle legends Arlen and Cory Ness to help design it, a rela-
tionship that continues today. The company offers what could 
be the most complete line of custom-inspired bikes of any man-
ufacturer; one that now tops out with the Vegas Jackpot. Our test 
bike was dipped in a crowd-gathering coat of Tequila Gold with 
tribal graphics, and nearly every square inch of metal is chrome-
plated. Subtle? Yeah, right. If the paint doesn‚Äôt grab your atten-
tion, perhaps the extreme tires will. Up front is a spindly little 
90/90R21 tire. Out back, the Jackpot has a monstrous 250/40R18 
slab of rubber that‚Äôs just about wide enough to be Ô¨Åtted to the 
rear axle of a muscle car. It certainly looks menacing. 
At the dragstrip, our tester found that the rear tire was oh so 
effective at putting power to pavement. The Jackpot rocketed 
down the track, passing 60 mph in a scant 3.74 seconds and 
smoking the quarter-mile in only 12.19 seconds. It was the 
quickest bike in the group. The Victory‚Äôs 1731-cc V-twin belts out 
a steady wave of turbodiesel-like torque. Trouble is, this power-
train has all the refinement of an 18-wheeler. Transmission 
shifts are clunky, with neutral particularly difÔ¨Åcult to Ô¨Ånd, which 
is frustrating in stop-and-go trafÔ¨Åc. The engine sounds a bit less 
sophisticated than the others here too. In slow-go city riding, the 
Jackpot‚Äôs wide rear tire and skinny front require an experienced 
hand. The width of that tire wants to push the bike over and turn 
more sharply than one might want. The rider does get used to it, 
and once clear of the city limits, the Jackpot really begins to 
shine. The Victory provides easy-chair comfort on the open road 
and surprisingly competent handling on twisty roads, thanks to 
the relatively short wheelbase. But, of course, like all these 
machines, the handling limits are determined by the foot pegs. 
So plan on scraping them often if you ride this bike hard. Even in 
this grouping of bravado bikes, the expensive $20,249 Victory is 
the extrovert. It‚Äôs Ô¨Çashy, slightly crude and incredibly powerful. 
For some riders, that‚Äôs the perfect formula.

HONDA 
 Fury
Since debuting last year, the Honda Fury has provided a string 
of surprises. Yes, it‚Äôs still shocking that conservative Honda 
decided to build a radical factory chopper. What‚Äôs cooler is that 
it has created a wild, stretched-out chopper proÔ¨Åle on a bike 
that‚Äôs just as docile, good-natured and pleasant to ride as any 
Honda cruiser. The Fury is perfect for a novice or moderately 
experienced rider who wants something unique. Climb aboard 
the Honda and you‚Äôll settle into a very comfy riding position. 
Your body tucks in nicely behind the beautifully tapered fuel 
tank and provides a windbreak so effective it‚Äôs as if Honda test-
ed the Fury‚Äôs aero signature in a wind tunnel. At city speeds, the 
Honda feels exceptionally light, easy to thread through trafÔ¨Åc 
and smooth-riding over moderately sized bumps. However, on 
the tight sweeping canyon roads, the Honda‚Äôs low cornering 
clearance and long wheelbase meant it wasn‚Äôt as sporty as the 
other three. But hey, it‚Äôs a chopper, not a sportbike. And it‚Äôs cer-
tainly fun to look down and see the liquid-cooled V-twin exposed 
by the svelte fuel tank. The 1312-cc motor feels plenty power-
ful‚Äîuntil you ride the other bikes. When it comes to thrust, the 
Honda was not so furious. Yet the Honda‚Äôs excellent throttle 
response made it feel quicker than its numbers suggest. The 
Fury‚Äôs smaller motor also delivered the best fuel economy (48.8 
mpg). Our test bike looked sinister and tough Ô¨Ånished in Ô¨Çat 
gray paint with black wheels. The hand of a minimalist designer 
must have penned the Fury, because there‚Äôs no extra Ô¨Çash or 
Ô¨Çuff. We dig it. Okay, we‚Äôve got one beef with the Fury‚Äôs body-
work: Almost all of it is plastic. Call us old-fashioned, but we 
want metal fenders. That said, perhaps that particular material 
choice helps keep costs in the basement, because, at $12,999, 
the Honda was the least expensive in our test‚Äîand one of the 
best values in the motorcycle world.

In a recent national poll, 72 percent 
of respondents expressed concern 
about potential accidents at nuclear 
power plants. Some opinion-makers 
have encouraged this trepidation: Ste-
ven Cohen, executive director of Colum-
bia University‚Äôs Earth Institute, has 
called nuclear power ‚Äúdangerous, com-
plicated and politically controversial.‚Äù 
During the first six decades of the 
nuclear age, however, fewer than 100 
people have died as a result of nuclear 
power plant accidents. And comparing 
modern nuclear plants to Chernobyl‚Äî
the Ukrainian reactor that directly caused 56 deaths after a 
1986 meltdown‚Äîis like comparing World War I Ô¨Åghter planes 
to the F/A-18. Newer nuclear plants, including the fast reactor 
now being developed at Idaho National Laboratory (INL), con-
tain multiple auto-shutoff mechanisms that reduce the odds of 
a meltdown exponentially‚Äîeven in a worst-case scenario, like 
an industrial accident or a terrorist attack. And some also have 
the ability to burn spent fuel rods, a convenient way to reuse 
nuclear waste instead of burying it for thousands of years.
Power sources such as coal and petroleum might seem safer 
than nuclear, but statistically they‚Äôre a lot deadlier. Coal min-
e renewable 
energy 
movement‚Äôs darling 
for years, 
corn-based ethanol 
has fallen out of 
favor for not 
making good on its 
promises of 
eÔ¨Éciency. Cellulosic 
ethanol‚Äîmade 
from plant parts 
containing 
cellulose, such as 
grass and wood 
chips‚Äîseems 
poised to be the 
ing kills several hundred people annu-
ally‚Äîmainly from heart damage and 
black lung disease, but also through 
devastating accidents like the April 
mine explosion in West Virginia. The 
sublethal effects of coal-power genera-
tion are also greater. ‚ÄúThe amount of radiation put out by a coal 
plant far exceeds that of a nuclear power plant, even if you use 
scrubbers,‚Äù says Gerald E. Marsh, a retired nuclear physicist 
who worked at Argonne National Laboratory. Particulate pollu-
tion from coal plants causes nearly 24,000 people a year to die 
next Ô¨Üar of the 
biofuel circuit. Its 
fuel crops require 
less fertilizer and 
use water more 
eÔ¨Éciently than 
corn. Plus, it can be 
created from waÔ¨Üe 
produs like lawn 
clippings and tree 
branches. 
But the upÔ¨Üart 
fuel will have to 
surmount sizable 
environmental and 
Ô¨Ånancial challeng-
es. For one, it takes 
a tremendous 
amount of cellulose 
to produce ethanol 
in induÔ¨Ürial 
quantities, which 
means a lot of land 
would Ô¨Üill have to 
be devoted to fuel 
produion. ‚Äúe 
requires heavy-duty 
enzymatic 
decomposition 
processes to 
convert the plant 
matter into simple 
sugars that can be 
fermented into 
ethanol. ese 
processes consume 
large amounts of 
energy and are so 
pricey that a Ô¨Üudy 
in Bioresource 
Technology laÔ¨Ü 
year concluded that 
cellulosic ethanol 
low density of the 
supply is a 
problem,‚Äù says Tad 
Patzek, a chemical 
engineer at the 
University of Texas 
at AuÔ¨Üin. ‚ÄúTo 
supply fuel to, say, 
the Bay Area, you 
would need an area 
of switchgrass that 
is larger than all the 
agricultural land in 
California.‚Äù 
And since 
cellulose is tough 
and Ô¨Åbrous, it

First things Ô¨Årst: Wind power is intermittent; it‚Äôs just the nature of, well, nature. Due largely to the unpre-
dictability of weather, turbines typically generate only about one-Ô¨Åfth of the energy they‚Äôd make if they actu-
ally ran 24/7. That said, energy planners have devised tactics to make wind power reliable.  
One of the best ways to balance wind‚Äôs now-it‚Äôs-here-now-it‚Äôs-not quality is to construct grid connections 
between different regions of the U.S. ‚ÄúWe have monitoring systems that show us the winds as they proceed through 
different regions,‚Äù says George Van Hoesen, a managing partner at Global Green Building, an environmental con-
sulting Ô¨Årm in Missouri. ‚ÄúWe understand the currents and the Ô¨Çows.‚Äù Armed with this data and computer models, 
utilities can plan to shunt surplus power generated in one part of the country to areas that need it. 
Science supports that strategy. A recent Stanford University study found that when many wind farms are inter-
connected through the grid, about one-third of the electricity they generate can be counted on as a reliable 
source of around-the-clock power. (Less reliable wind energy sources can still be put to proÔ¨Åtable use‚Äîto charge 
batteries for electric vehicles or produce hydrogen transportation fuel, for example.) And a University of Dela-
ware study published this spring concluded that an offshore grid, connecting wind generators along the East 
Coast, could provide relatively stable output. Over a simulated 
Ô¨Åve-year period, power never petered out entirely. 
‚ÄúIn the eastern United States, storms typically move along the 
coast,‚Äù says Willett Kempton, a lead author. ‚ÄúThus, if offshore 
wind farms are connected by a transmission line, the power from 
the whole set is more consistent.‚Äù
 Still, even the savviest grid connections have limits. The most 
optimistic projections calculate that wind can supply about 30 
percent of the planet‚Äôs electricity by 2030, so power sources like 
nuclear, hydropower and solar will be needed as supplements. It 
might not be a great idea to place all bets on wind, but with the 
latest turbines able to generate pollution-free electricity at less 
than 5 cents per kilowatt-hour, it wouldn‚Äôt be smart to let wind go 
by the wayside while we invest in less sustainable fuels, either. 
prematurely from diseases such as lung cancer. Petroleum pro-
duction also has safety and environmental risks, as demon-
strated by the recent oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
INL nuclear lab‚Äôs deputy associate director, Kathryn 
Mc Carthy, thinks the industry can overcome its stigma. ‚ÄúIt's 
been a long time since Chernobyl and Three Mile Island,‚Äù 
Mc Carthy says, ‚Äúand people are willing to reconsider the beneÔ¨Åts 
of nuclear energy.‚Äù Nuclear plants emit only a tiny fraction of the 
carbon dioxide that coal plants do, and a few hundred  nuclear 
facilities could potentially supply nearly all the energy the 
 United States needs, reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. 
won‚Äôt be competi-
tive with gasoline 
unless oil prices 
remain above $90 
a barrel. 
When that day 
comes, cellulosic 
could play a modeÔ¨Ü 
role in booÔ¨Üing 
supplies. And that‚Äôs 
worth more 
research today. But 
hopes that grass  
clippings will end 
our oil habit are 
overblown.

According to a USDA 
life-cycle analysis, corn-
based ethanol results 
in only a 20 percent 
reduction in greenhouse 
gases relative to gaso-
line. Cellulosic ethanol, 
in contrast, can achieve 
an 86 percent reduc-
tion. It also requires 
only a quarter of the 
irrigation and fertiliza-
tion of row crops. 
In order to Ô¨Üudy the reliability of a wind-
powered grid, researchers used Ô¨Åve years 
of wind data from 11 monitoring Ô¨Üations 
along the EaÔ¨Ü CoaÔ¨Ü. ey found that a 
high- or low-pressure syÔ¨Üem is likely to 
generate energy somewhere at any given 
time, smoothing out power Ô¨Çuuations.

As the sea level rises and falls, tides roll in 
and out twice a day, unfailingly. It‚Äôs hard to 
imagine a more predictable source of power. 
Yet tidal power‚Äôs showcase project in the 
United States, an array of underwater turbines 
anchored in the East River in New York City, 
hasn‚Äôt exactly been an overnight success. Two 
initial turbine designs Ô¨Çopped over the course 
of several years; blades and hubs snapped off 
because they weren‚Äôt strong enough to with-
stand the near-constant force of the water. 
Still, it‚Äôs too soon to give up on tidal power. 
The Rance tidal power plant in France has an 
installed capacity of 240 megawatts and has been in continuous 
operation for more than 40 years. Its axial-Ô¨Çow turbines are 
capable of operating as the water Ô¨Çows in both directions. And 
after several false starts, Verdant Power‚Äôs array operated for 
more than 9000 hours in a 2008 trial, delivering 70 megawatt-
hours of energy to two end-users. This summer, the startup 
Natural Currents Energy Services plans to install proprietary 
turbines in two projects that will power marinas in New Jersey. 
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre talking about the entire ocean moving 
in one direction or another,‚Äù says Global Green 
Building‚Äôs Van Hoesen. ‚ÄúThe sheer volume of 
energy makes it very attractive.‚Äù 
It grows in 
ponds. It 
grows in Ô¨Üream-
beds. It even grows 
in your sink if you 
forget to scrub it. 
Algae is so 
omnipresent that 
Ô¨Üartups like Solix 
and Aurora Biofuels 
make it easy to 
envision the 
microscopic green 
organisms meeting 
all the transporta-
tion needs of the 
planet at pennies a 
gallon for eternity.
But in-depth 
experimentation 
suggeÔ¨Üs that 
algae-fuel 
supremacy isn‚Äôt 
going to come 
easy. e Ô¨Ürains of 
algae that work 
beÔ¨Ü for biodiesel

pete lipid-rich

engineer John

algae-fuel proje. 
Plus, as bioreac-
tors scale up,

surface-area-to-

make it diÔ¨Écult for 
all the algae to get 
the solar energy 
they need, making 
them subpar for

The phrase ‚Äúclean coal‚Äù has recently 
entered the argot of energy planners 
and political candidates, implying that 
coal‚Äîin addition to supplying cheap, reli-
able base-load power‚Äîcan be an environ-
mentally friendly energy source. Energy 
Secretary Steven Chu endorsed this view-
point, announcing that the Department 
of Energy would spend more than $3 bil-
lion to fund facilities that capture carbon 
dioxide from coal and stash it under-
ground, reducing air pollution. 
Unfortunately, clean, cheap coal is still 
a pipe dream. According to the National 
Energy Technology Laboratory, the cost of 
capturing carbon dioxide from coal plants 
and storing it in underground locations will increase the price of 
electricity from 30 to 100 percent, depending on the method 
used. In addition, coal-Ô¨Åred power plants that perform sequestra-
tion burn one-quarter more coal than their unimproved counter-
parts to produce the same amount of electricity. That means more 
destructive mining operations, more CO2 emissions from trans-
portation and more coal ash, the toxic byproduct of all coal- 
burning. ‚ÄúWe have implemented some technologies that are 
cleaning the air,‚Äù says Mary Fox, an environmental scientist at 
Johns Hopkins University, ‚Äúbut that has led to a displacement of 
some of those waste products into solid waste.‚Äù 
Horror Ô¨Üories 
about deep 
geothermal drilling 
began circulating 
aer a series of 
earthquakes shook 
the city of Basel, 
Switzerland, in 
2006. And, in fa, 
a scientiÔ¨Åc analysis 
concluded that a 
geothermal syÔ¨Üem 
likely set oÔ¨Ä the 
quakes, causing a 
similar proje in 
California to be 
scuttled.
But deep 
geothermal, also 
called enhanced 
geothermal, has 
diÔ¨Üin advantages 
too. Because it 
taps into the hot, 
dry bedrock miles 
below the surface, 
drilling could be 
widespread. A 
recent Ô¨Üudy led by 
MIT identiÔ¨Åed 
200,000 exajoules 
of extraable deep 
geothermal energy, 
which could supply 
more than 2000 
times the nation‚Äôs 
annual energy use.
Odds are very 
low that enhanced 
geothermal power 
would ever cause a 
quake on the scale 
of, say, the recent 
shake-up in Chile, 
says Colin Williams, 
a geophysiciÔ¨Ü on 
the U.S. Geological 
Survey earthquake 
hazards team. Even 
the largeÔ¨Ü quake in 
Basel, a 3.4 on the 
Richter scale, 
caused only 
minimal damage. 
And experts say 
that if enhanced 
geothermal plants

health consequences, as in the case of the 
coal-ash slurry that broke through a dike 
in Tennessee, sullying water supplies with 
mercury, lead and arsenic. Disposing of 
toxic ash responsibly could cost in excess of $5 billion annually, 
so efforts to pass more stringent federal controls on solid waste 
have stalled. For better or worse, coal produces roughly half of the 
nation‚Äôs electricity, so technology for next-gen facilities is worth 
developing. But no breakthrough will cause the nearly 500 plants 
already operating in the U.S. to magically clean up their act.

Shale oil hasn‚Äôt gotten too much 
attention since the oil crisis of the 
1970s. But today, proponents are once 
again pointing out that there are more 
than a trillion barrels of oil locked in 
the shale deposits of Colorado, Utah 
and Wyoming, more than all the  proven 
crude-oil reserves on the planet. That 
would be enough to meet current U.S. 
oil demand for an entire century.
The problem, then and now, lies in 
the financial and ecological costs of 
extracting the oil. Shale oil naturally 
occurs in the form of kerogens, solid, 
waxy substances with a texture similar 
to that of ChapStick. Once the kerogens are heated to over 
500 F, they exude hydrocarbons, which must be treated with 
hydrogen in order to be processed into usable fuel‚Äîa highly 
energy-intensive process that releases large amounts of CO2. 
And just to get at these kerogens, energy companies would 
have to mine and process millions of tons of shale from the 
earth‚Äîleaving behind toxic heavy metals and sulfates that 
could seep into groundwater. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a water contamination 
issue,‚Äù says Olayinka Ogunsola, an engineer at the Depart-
ment of Energy. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs also a land reclamation issue‚Äî
[mining] would create a lot of distur-
bance in the area.‚Äù Mining and 
processing shale also require vast 
amounts of water‚Äîproducing 2.5 mil-
lion barrels of shale oil per day would require 105 million to 
315 million gallons of water daily. That might be the biggest 
deal breaker of all for parched western states. 
 So while extracting the oil from U.S. shale may be techni-
cally possible, the scale of such an enterprise, as measured in 
acres and natural resources, may never make it worthwhile.

Discussions of America‚Äôs energy future tend to focus on increasing produc-
tion. There‚Äôs no question that more mining and drilling can modestly increase 
overall supply‚Äîbut, as recent accidents have shown, at a steep human and environ-
mental cost. Renewable sources show promise but will take time and money to 
implement. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a big advocate of renewables, but I‚Äôm also an advocate of common 
sense,‚Äù says David Hughes, a fellow at the Post Carbon Institute. ‚ÄúRadical conserva-
tion has to be number one.‚Äù 
The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects that, under existing poli-
cies, total energy consumption will grow by 14 percent by 2035. That doesn‚Äôt have to 
be the case. A report published last year by McKinsey & Company calculates that 
widespread deployment of energy-efÔ¨Åciency measures can decrease consumption 
by 23 percent of projected demand by 2020. What‚Äôs more, such measures would 
result in $1.2 trillion in savings, far more than the $520 billion investment required 
to implement them. The corresponding reduction of greenhouse gas emissions 
would be like taking an entire U.S. Ô¨Çeet of passenger vehicles off the road.
 Personal actions certainly help: A 2008 trial by Baltimore Gas and Electric showed 
that customers who had smart meters reduced their energy use by up to 37 percent 
during peak periods. And semiconductor-powered light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have 
the potential to reduce lighting-related energy consumption to one-sixth of its  
current level. The DOE estimates we could be well on our way to that goal by 2025, 
cutting lighting energy use by 29 percent‚Äîand collectively saving $125 billion. 
There‚Äôs also ample room for industry to streamline its energy consumption. If 
plants like oil reÔ¨Åneries and steel mills convert exhaust heat into electricity via cogen-
eration, they could reap an extra 100 gigawatts, reducing CO2 emissions by about 400 
million metric tons. Energy saved, it turns out, is the cheapest new source.

Wood Ô¨Üoves are dirty

Old wood Ô¨Üoves spewed 20

While cleaner than two-Ô¨Üroke 
gas engines, cordless mowers 
rely on carbon-intensive 
elericity. Propane-burning 
lawnmowers emit up to 70 
percent fewer hydrocarbons 
than small gasoline engines. 
Driving with the a/c oÔ¨Ä and

It takes 2 to 8 hp to run the

rooper Stephen Bunker died
flying a mission that never 
should have happened, looking 
for a hole in the clouds that 
never appeared. Shortly after 11 pm on 
Sept. 27, 2008, Bunker‚Äôs phone rang 
inside the Maryland State Police aircraft 
hangar at Andrews Air Force Base. Two 
young women were injured in a car 
crash in Waldorf, Md. They needed 
transport to Prince George‚Äôs Hospital 
Center. Would Bunker accept the Ô¨Çight?
It was a warm and soupy autumn 
night. Weather reports showed thick 
clouds descending to 800 feet, the mini-
mum for night Ô¨Çights in state police heli-
copters. The area 1 mile north of Prince 
George‚Äôs Hospital was completely fogged 
in. Bunker hesitated.
‚ÄúWell, maybe they‚Äôll change their 
minds,‚Äù he told George Noyes, the state 
police Ô¨Çight dispatcher.
Noyes had a hunch that wouldn‚Äôt 
happen. The call came from Charles 
County, where a 17-year-old EMT on the 
scene requested helicopter service. 
‚ÄúWhen I heard it was Charles County, I 
knew it was gonna be Waldorf,‚Äù Noyes 
says, ‚Äúbecause those guys never want to 

drive to the hospital.‚Äù 
In Maryland, emergency medical ser-
vice (EMS) guidelines specify that police 
helicopters rescue patients from acci-
dent scenes, while private air ambulance 
companies handle runs between hospi-
tals and back up police. Over the radio 
Bunker heard that MedSTAR Transport, 
a private company, had just completed a 
job nearby. 
‚ÄúIf they can do it, we can do it,‚Äù Bun-
ker said.  
He lifted off from Andrews at 11:10 
pm. Thirty-four minutes later, with 
both patients and two paramedics 
onboard, he radioed air trafÔ¨Åc control 
at Ronald Reagan Washington National 
Airport. ‚ÄúUh, yes, sir, we just ran into 
some heavy stuff,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt 
think we‚Äôre going to be able to make it 
all the way to the hospital.‚Äù
Blinded by fog, Bunker diverted to 
Andrews. Three-and-a-half miles short of 
the runway, Ô¨Çying at 1900 feet, he sent 
Trooper 2 into a dive. The helicopter was 
not equipped with Ô¨Çight recorders, so it‚Äôs 
unknown why he descended. But investi-
gators believe that because he was famil-
iar with the surrounding area, and 
because the sky immediately over 
Andrews was clear when he took off, Bun-
ker probably thought he could duck 
under the clouds and land by sight.
There was nowhere to duck. Travel-
ing at 106 mph, Bunker slammed into a 
tree in Walker Mill Regional Park. One 
patient, Jordan Wells, fell free of the air-
craft and survived. Bunker and three 
others died. 
edical helicopters 
accept the most dan-
gerous missions in 
commercial aviation. 
They fly unplanned 
routes a few hundred feet above the 
ground, often below radar. They land on 
highways, mountains and farms, miles 
from the nearest airport weather station. 
Yet Trooper 2 was typical: Most med-
ical helicopters lack basic safety equip-
ment mandatory on other commercial 
aircraft. The majority have no autopilot 
system or co-pilot to assist the pilot in 
emergencies. Medical helicopters are 
not required to have terrain awareness 
and warning systems (TAWS), night-
vision goggles, flight data recorders, 
detailed weather reporting or ground 
personnel in charge of Ô¨Çight dispatch 
and in-Ô¨Çight tracking. 
As a result of Ô¨Çying ill-equipped into 
risky conditions, medical helicopters 
crash at twice the rate of other air taxis 
and are exponentially more dangerous 
than commercial airliners, according to 
a 2009 study by Ira Blumen, medical and 
program director of the University of 
Chicago Aeromedical Network. Air 
ambulances have crashed 264 times 
between 1972 and 2008, killing 264 peo-
ple. The Ô¨Årst three months of this year 
kicked off with two more fatal crashes, 
leaving six dead (half of whom died dur-
ing a military EMS simulation).
In fact, working onboard a medical 
helicopter is the most dangerous profes-
sion in America, Blumen found, with a 
higher fatality rate than that of fisher-
men, loggers or steelworkers.
‚ÄúMost people think medical helicop-
ters are like airliners, that they all meet 
the same standards,‚Äù says Thomas 
Judge, executive director of LifeFlight of 
Maine. ‚ÄúYet here we take injured pas-
sengers, with no choice of carrier, and 
subject them to this huge variation of 
standards that airline passengers would 
not accept.‚Äù
Often, helicopter evacuations are not 
even needed to save a life. ‚ÄúMedics call 

The reality is that Trooper 2 did not 
have to crash. Since 1988, the National 
Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has 
known that most fatal medical helicopter 
accidents occur when pilots unexpect-
edly encounter poor visibility or bad 
weather and become disoriented. Since

Wanted‚Äù list detailing critical changes 
needed to make the nation‚Äôs waterways, 
railroads, highways and airways safer. 
Since 2008, mandating Ô¨Çight dispatch 
and tracking systems for medical heli-
copters has been on that list.
Although the FAA doesn‚Äôt require 
medical helicopter companies to install 
advanced safety technology or hire 
trained dispatchers, some operators 
choose to do it anyway. Voters in Maine 
have agreed to spend $4 million since 
2003 to install remote weather stations 
and GPS-based instrument approaches, 
improving safety for the state‚Äôs LifeFlight 
system. It has never had a serious crash.
Air Methods, the nation‚Äôs largest 
safe landings. But the system 
wasn‚Äôt built to track small 
weather events at low altitudes 
and in remote locations, 
where medical helicopters 
sometimes Ô¨Çy, says John Allen, 
director of the FAA‚Äôs Flight 
Standards Service. Air ambu-
lances may land in canyons 50 
miles from the nearest airport weather 
station, where intense storms have 
room to hide and air trafÔ¨Åc controllers 
are powerless to help. 
A 2006 NTSB report analyzing all air-
ambulance crashes between January 
2002 and January 2005 (air ambulances 
include small Ô¨Åxed-wing planes) found 
that improved flight risk assessment 
and dispatch and tracking systems 
could have prevented nearly half. 
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs universal agreement that we 
built a really safe Ô¨Çight system that goes 
airport to airport and Ô¨Çies high in the 
sky,‚Äù Judge says. ‚ÄúIn the air medical 
world, we don‚Äôt have that.‚Äù 
Every year the NTSB releases a ‚ÄúMost 
preÔ¨Çight weather check ‚Äúinadequate.‚Äù
In other crashes, pilots saw nothing 
but clear skies before takeoff, only to 
encounter storms midÔ¨Çight. Suddenly, 
they had to climb to a safe altitude, hunt 
for a map or consult GPS, radio for help, 
plan an escape from the cloud and look 
out the window for obstacles or a cloud 
break, all while watching the instru-
ments to maintain steady Ô¨Çight.  
Bunker‚Äôs accident happened near 
Washington, D.C., some of the world‚Äôs 
most highly monitored airspace. He 
depended on air trafÔ¨Åc control to assist 
him in a dangerous situation. But when 
Bunker called Andrews and asked for 
turn-by-turn directions after becoming 
disoriented in fog, the controller told 
him she wasn‚Äôt trained for that. Fifty sec-
onds later he dropped from the radar. 
The nation‚Äôs aviation system was 
designed for high-altitude Ô¨Çights along 
planned routes. TrafÔ¨Åc controllers help 
decide when it‚Äôs safe to Ô¨Çy. They use GPS 
and radar to warn pilots about bad 
weather ahead and can guide planes to

Some also capture

Should you turn down a rescue Ô¨Çight? 
Probably not. In a crisis, queÔ¨Üioning

But you can take Ô¨Üeps to prote yourself 
now, before disaÔ¨Üer Ô¨Ürikes.
 
Find out who provides helicopter emergency 
medical services (HEMS) in your community. 
Call the providers to ask if they use night-
vision goggles, terrain awareness and warning 
syÔ¨Üems and other safety gear recommended 
by the NTSB and if they‚Äôre accredited by the 
Commission on Accreditation of Medical 
Transport Services. If not, it may be wise to 
go by ground ambulance if you have a choice.
Check your insurance plan to make sure it 
covers ambulance and helicopter services. 
Also check the limits on coverage. If you 
decide to buy a special plan to cover air 
medical evacuation, Ô¨Ånd the company with 
the beÔ¨Ü safety record and equipment.
Before going on vacation, make sure your 
insurance covers emergency care where you 
will be traveling. Vet the HEMS provider at 
your deÔ¨Üination with the queÔ¨Üions above.

In Arizona, 43 percent of patients 
transported by helicopter to hospital ERs 
were discharged within 24 hours, suggest-
ing most didn‚Äôt need a helicopter at all. In 
Maryland, the 24-hour discharge rate for 
patients transported by state police heli-
copters was 41 percent prior to 2008.
After Trooper 2 crashed, Maryland 
barred all but seriously injured patients 
from state helicopters, which it pre-
dicted would reduce the number of 
Ô¨Çights by 67.2 percent without affecting 
patient mortality. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre getting close 
to a 50 percent discharge rate within 24 
hours, I think that‚Äôs too high,‚Äù says Dan 
Hankins, an emergency-medicine physi-
cian at the Mayo Clinic and president of 
the Association of Air Medical Services. 
Academic studies disagree on 
whether medical helicopters improve 
EMS response times and patient survival 
rates. Besides severity of injury, the key 
factor may be Ô¨Çight time. Helicopters are 
signiÔ¨Åcantly faster than ground ambu-
lances when retrieving patients more 
than 45 miles away from a hospital, 
according to a study published in the 
Journal of Trauma in 2005. But closer 
than 45 miles, ground vehicles are just as 
fast‚Äîor faster‚Äîthan helicopters, 
because helicopter crews need more time 
to start engines and secure equipment. 
Efforts are under way to improve 
training for paramedics on whether or 
not to request helicopter transports, 
Bledsoe says. Meanwhile, industry insid-
ers say that medical helicopters are over-
used because, in too many cases, money 
trumps medicine. There were 330 medi-
cal helicopters in the United States in 
1997 when Congress mandated new 
Medicare reimbursement rates for air 
ambulances. Since then, the number of 
helicopters has nearly tripled, to 850. The 
industry‚Äôs explosive growth is a direct 
result of Medicare‚Äôs pay raise, says Debo-
rah Hersman, chairman of the NTSB.
Missouri has 5.9 million people and 33 
medical helicopters. Canada has 33.4 mil-
lion people and 20 medical helicopters. 
‚ÄúIn many places, the [motivation] isn‚Äôt 
medical necessity,‚Äù LifeFlight of Maine‚Äôs 
Judge says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs to Ô¨Ånd ways to put more 
people in helicopters, because otherwise 
we‚Äôre not going to make enough money to 
stay in business.‚Äù
n Jan. 10, 2005, Jonathan 
Godfrey was on duty as a 
Ô¨Çight nurse when his Euro-
copter EC-135 medical heli-
copter, flying low and fast 
over Washington, D.C., entered a dark 
area south of the Woodrow Wilson Bridge 
that pilots referred to as the ‚Äúblack void.‚Äù 
Twenty seconds later, he woke up on the 
bottom of the Potomac River, still 
strapped to his seat. After groping for the 
belt, Godfrey popped to the surface, and 
an hour later Trooper 2‚Äîthe same heli-
copter that would crash near Andrews in 
2008‚Äîpicked him up, a broken bone 
poking through the arm of his Ô¨Çightsuit. 
Two others, the pilot and a Ô¨Çight para-
medic, died.
Night-vision goggles, scheduled for 
installation on Godfrey‚Äôs helicopter, 
hadn‚Äôt yet been delivered. Pilots agree 
that goggles make a difference. In a 2008 
survey by the National EMS Pilots Associ-
ation, 88 percent of 382 pilots said using 
night-vision goggles ‚Äúprovides a signiÔ¨Å-
cant safety advantage.‚Äù But 40 percent 
said their companies didn‚Äôt supply them. 
In the survey‚Äôs comment section, one 
pilot says of the years he spent Ô¨Çying at 
night over the mountains of Kentucky, 
‚ÄúWe must have been out of our minds.‚Äù
Of the 55 crashes reviewed in the 2006 
medical helicopter 
company, tracks all 
313 to 330 of its air-
craft from an opera-
tions control center in 
Englewood, 
Colo. 
Operational control specialists watch 
Ô¨Çights using weather reports overlaid on 
digital topographical maps. If pilots 
experience weather or other problems, 
the staff can zoom in for a 360-degree 
look, patch themselves into pilots‚Äô head-
sets and discuss alternative routes. 
‚ÄúOnce pilots get into a Ô¨Çight, there‚Äôs 
really no way for them to get ongoing 
updated info,‚Äù says Dennis McCall, avia-
tion compliance manager of Air Meth-
ods. ‚ÄúWe want to look over their shoul-
ders and help them make decisions.‚Äù
hen the helicopter 
landed in his yard, 
Larry Strittmatter 
didn‚Äôt think about the 
cost. His wife Dana 
had accidentally burned her leg with boil-
ing water. Instead of driving her to one of 
six hospitals within 15 miles of their 
house near Fort Worth, Texas, paramed-
ics called a helicopter to Ô¨Çy Dana to the 
Parkland Hospital Burn Center in Dallas.
Shortly after Larry arrived, the doctors 
gave his wife a bandage, a prescription 
for Tylenol with codeine and a swift 
escort to the lobby. The hospital refused 
to admit her for such minor injuries, 
leaving the Strittmatters with a $17,000 
Ô¨Çight bill. ‚ÄúThe doctors said they were 
shocked and dismayed when they saw a 
helicopter landing,‚Äù Strittmatter says. 
They had been in touch with EMTs at the 
scene, and after hearing Dana‚Äôs injuries 
described had advised that she should be 
transported by ground ambulance.

You‚Äôve perfeed your grilling 
technique. You‚Äôve maÔ¨Üered the mari-
nade. Now take your outdoor culinary 
skills to the next level by building our 
red cedar cookout cart. It‚Äôs the perfe 
mobile Ô¨Üaging area for Ô¨Üoring and 
preparing food. Chop vegetables or 
slice meat on its li-oÔ¨Ä polyethylene 
cutting board, then dump scraps 
through its hole and into a sliding 
stainless-steel pan below. Another 
larger pan on the le slides out to give 
you access to Ô¨Üored meat, Ô¨Åsh, vege-
tables or ice. Lean cookbooks againÔ¨Ü 
the backsplash and keep condiments 
in the li-out tray on the le. 
Aer the feaÔ¨Ü, the slide-out pans, 
the cutting board and the condiment 
tray come inside for cleaning while the 
cart Ô¨Üays outside with your grill. 
What You‚Äôll Need
Our cart is built of vertical-grain red 
cedar, a rot-resiÔ¨Üant wood that‚Äôs easy 
to work with. To build exaly what 
we‚Äôve got here, you will need a table 
saw and, ideally, a portable planer. 
ose attraive red cedar slats that 
form the shelves Ô¨Üart out as ¬Ω-inch-
thick pieces ripped from a cedar 2 x 4 
using a table saw. They are then 
planed or sanded. You‚Äôll also need a 
biscuit joiner to bind the top pieces 
and a router to put a gentle curve on 
each slat edge and around the hole in 
the cutting board.
at‚Äôs a lot of equipment to build a 
little cart. Suppose you don‚Äôt own 
those tools‚Äîsimplify. Use a circular 
saw and edge guide and substitute 
dowels or pocket screws for biscuits. 
To avoid planing, make the slats from 
1 x 2 cedar or have an old-fashioned 
lumberyard plane the material for you.

CONSTRUCTION NOTES 
1. Clamp, then screw
Crosscut the parts for the 
three frames. Clamp the 
parts together and bore 
countersunk pilot holes. 
Apply waterproof glue to the 
joint to add a little Ô¨Ürength 
and to seal the end grain. 
Next, drive 1¬º-inch 
galvanized or Ô¨Üainless-Ô¨Üeel 
screws into each joint.
2. Install the legs
Crosscut the two rear legs, 
apply waterproof glue to the 
joint and faÔ¨Üen the legs 
using 1¬º-inch screws driven 
into pilot holes.
3. Add safety
Make a knife shield from two 
pieces of acrylic plaÔ¨Üic cut 
to shape with a jigsaw. Drill 
and countersink three screw 
holes into each piece. en 
screw one to the outer 
surface of the upper frame. 
Attach the other to the inner 
surface of the wood handle.
4. Hide the screws
FaÔ¨Üen the cart‚Äôs wood 
handle to the upper frame 
with glue and deck screws. 
Drive the screws from the 
back so they‚Äôll be hidden. 
Make sure that the square 
end of each handle is Ô¨Çush 
with the rear legs.
5. Dowels make knife slots
To create Ô¨Åve partitions to 
hang knives, Ô¨Üart by drilling 
six holes through the upper 
frame and both acrylic 
panels, and into (but not 
through) the wood handle. 
Insert a dowel into each hole, 
then trim it Ô¨Çush.
6. Rip the slats
Rip the slats from a cedar  
2 x 4 and sand or plane them 
smooth. Shape their top 
edges with a router and a 
rounding-over bit. Using a 
pneumatic Ô¨Ånish nailer, 
faÔ¨Üen the slats to the frame, 
spaced 5/8 inch apart.
7. Build the top
Rip and crosscut the top 
parts and teÔ¨Ü Ô¨Åt the cutting 
board in it. Next, use glue 
and biscuits to assemble the 
top and clamp the assembly. 
Screw the cleats to the 
bottom of the assembly.
8. Add runners
With the cart upside down, 
screw on the runners, which 
will support the two 
Ô¨Üainless-Ô¨Üeel pans. 
9. Fasten the backsplash
Rip and crosscut the back- 
splash from a cedar 1 x 8, 
then cut the gentle top curve 
using a jigsaw. Finally, faÔ¨Üen 
it by driving deck screws 
through pilot holes into the 
back of the top assembly.

Front-Door Upgrade
Q 
I have a metal front door and I‚Äôm wondering about how to 
clean or paint it. Is it easier to do this work with the door on 
its hinges, or should I take it oÔ¨Ä? Also, the kickplate is tarnished. 
Can I replace that? I don‚Äôt see any screws holding it in place.
A 
Yes, take the door off its hinges. 
Lay it on some sawhorses with 
old towels or pieces of carpet on them 
to protect the inside face of the door. 
If the door is weather-beaten, clean-
ing won‚Äôt be enough to restore its luster. 
 
  Brush 
‚Üí Use a siding 
brush. Its long, 
so briÔ¨Üles do a 
good job of 
scrubbing oÔ¨Ä dirt, 
and they‚Äôre 
Ô¨Çexible enough to 
follow contours.
 
  Wash 
‚Üí e cleaning 
solution will slop 
over onto the 
lawn, so I use a 
biodegradable 
produ like 
Simple Green 
All-Purpose 
Cleaner. Wipe the 
back of the door to 
remove drip marks.
 
  Hinge 
‚Üì Take out the 
hinge pins with a 
dri punch. Do the 
center hinge laÔ¨Ü.

You‚Äôll have to paint it. First, remove the 
kickplate. There are three ways these 
plates are held: with a magnetic strip, 
with screws or with a peel-and-stick 
backing. e last is the most diÔ¨Écult to 
remove. Some of these plates are very 
strongly bonded. Test one corner. If you 
can‚Äôt take up the plate with a putty knife, 
you‚Äôre probably better oÔ¨Ä just screwing 
the new plate on top of the old. Which-
ever type of kickplate you choose, wait 
until you‚Äôre done painting the door to 
install it. For the ultimate in weather

  Tankless water heater 
advocates are quick to 
criticize the cylindrical 
tenants of American 
basements. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a soup can 
on a candle,‚Äù tankless 
manufaurer Takagi‚Äôs Eric 
MuÔ¨Ä says. It‚Äôs true that 
tankless heaters‚Äô endless 
hot water and incendiary 
Btu ratings are impressive. 
EÔ¨Écient new condensing 
models recycle heat that 
would be waÔ¨Üed as 
exhauÔ¨Ü. Some machines‚Äô 
settings can even be 
altered via remote control.  
But tankless tech isn‚Äôt for 
everybody. Hard water 
tends to jam the machinery, 
and urban layouts can make 
the necessary venting 
impossible. So it‚Äôs no 
surprise that contraors 
typically inÔ¨Üall tried-and-
true tank-Ô¨Üyle heaters. But 
a little learnin‚Äô can Ô¨Åx that. 
Here‚Äôs how to know if 
tankless works for you.

resistance, choose a kickplate with a 
PVD (physical vapor deposition) coating.
Next, clean the door with a soft-
bristle siding brush and a gentle house-
hold cleaner dissolved in warm water. 
Rinse the door and let it dry. Use 
masking tape to protect door hard-
ware or remove the hardware before 
applying primer.
If the door‚Äôs paint is severely faded 
and it has developed a dusty film, 
known as chalk, use an alkyd primer 
applied with a 2¬Ω-inch trim brush and 
a small velour paint roller. If the door is 
only moderately weathered, use an 
acrylic primer. Whichever primer you 
choose, use an exterior-grade one. If 
the door is dented, use an exterior-
grade metal filler such as Bondo or a 
multisurface material such as DAP
CrackShot Spackling Paste. Sand the 
filler smooth and prime the filled sur-
face with an acrylic primer.
Topcoat the door with two coats of 
acrylic gloss or semigloss trim enamel. 
For the ultimate in a smooth finish, 
lightly wet-sand the first coat with 
waterproof sandpaper (800- to 1100- 
grit), wipe the door clean, and, when 
it‚Äôs dry, apply the second coat.
Finally, if the door has a worn inter-
nal weatherstrip, remove and replace it.
Popping Bricks
e faces pop oÔ¨Ä the bricks on my 
house‚Äôs chimney. What causes that, 
and what can I do to Ô¨Üop it?
e condition is called spalling, and it‚Äôs 
the result of trapped moiÔ¨Üure. ere are 
two causes. One is that the chimney‚Äôs 
masonry cap is cracked and admitting 
moisture, which leaks down into the 
chimney wall. The brick and mortar 
absorb the moiÔ¨Üure; when it freezes, the 
expansion cleaves the face oÔ¨Ä the brick.
e other source of the problem is 
common on very old chimneys on which 
an inappropriate portland cement 
mortar was used for repair work. Old 
mortars (pre-1870) are much soer than 
the modern equivalent because they are 
made with a large proportion of lime, not 
portland cement. Repairing the chimney 
with a harder portland cement mortar 
P M  D I Y  H O M E  /// H O M E O W N E R S  C L I N I C  Q + A

Continued on page 96
will trap moiÔ¨Üure, resulting in the condi-
tion described above. It can also create 
a bond that is much harder than the 
brick itself. When the brick expands 
because of temperature and moiÔ¨Üure, it 
can crack as it gets squeezed between 
the rock-hard mortar joints.
Begin the repair process with a thor-
ough inspection of the chimney. A
cracked cap will be obvious, as will 
repaired mortar joints, which are a diÔ¨Äer-
ent color and texture than surrounding 
mortar. You‚Äôll need to replace damaged 
bricks by cutting them out and inÔ¨Üalling 
new ones, along with the appropriate 
mortar. It‚Äôs a tremendous amount of 
work, but the alternative is to allow the 
chimney to continue to crumble.
Edge Banding 
I know this is a simple queÔ¨Üion,  
but what is the beÔ¨Ü way to  
attach solid-wood edge banding  
to a shelf made of ¬æ-inch maple-
veneer plywood?
‚Äúe faÔ¨ÜeÔ¨Ü and moÔ¨Ü accurate way to 
do this is not to measure,‚Äù PM contrib-
uting editor Joe Truini says. ‚ÄúMark the 
edge band direly from the shelf, and 
transfer the measurement from the 
back of the piece to its front using a 
combination square. en cut on the 
mark, front to back. If any splintering 
occurs, it will be on the back.‚Äù And Joe 
should know. As a former Ô¨Ånish carpen-
ter and cabinetmaker, he‚Äôs installed 
miles of edge banding in his career.
Next, to attach the edge banding, 
Joe Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü wipes a thin layer of carpen-
ter‚Äôs wood glue on the edge of the 
plywood, then uses a pneumatic Ô¨Ånish 
nailer and 18-gauge nails that are 1¬Ω 
to 2 inches long. ‚ÄúKeep the nails at leaÔ¨Ü 
1¬Ω inches from the ends of the piece to 
avoid splitting,‚Äù Joe advises.
If you hand-nail the edge band to the 
plywood, predrill the nail holes, apply 
carpenter‚Äôs glue and use 4d Ô¨Ånish nails 
to attach the pieces. Carefully set the 
nailheads, overÔ¨Åll the cavity slightly, and 
sand the filler smooth with 120-grit 
sandpaper. Select the filler‚Äôs color,

  A tankless water heater requires a fresh-air intake to 
feed the Ô¨Çame and an exhauÔ¨Ü line to expel combuÔ¨Üion 
gases. e lines vent through an exterior wall or roof either 
as separate intake and exhauÔ¨Ü pipes, or as a concentric 
vent in which both pipes share a single conduit (see the Rinnai vent at 
le). Venting requirements determine where (or if) a 
unit can be installed. Inconveniently located gas 
supply lines can force vent pipes to make too long a 
run, inhibiting airÔ¨Çow. Codes can require a minimum 
diÔ¨Üance from the vent openings to a home‚Äôs win-
dows, eliminating an otherwise ideal location.

light you need, I found that the refer-
ences I keep here in the oÔ¨Éce weren‚Äôt 
much help. When my search for a dire 
answer ground to a halt, I called Dave 
Canio, a salesman at Enterprise Lighting 
Sales in New York City. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt guess,‚Äù he 
said. ‚ÄúUse a lighting calculator to Ô¨Ånd out 
what your reader really needs.‚Äù
With that tip, I went looking for light-
ing calculators on the Web. e moÔ¨Ü 
helpful and speciÔ¨Åc one I found was at 
Cooper Lighting; it allows you to enter 
the dimensions of the space and adjuÔ¨Ü 
all the variables in it, such as reÔ¨Çeivity.
Looking under the induÔ¨Ürial version 
of the company‚Äôs Metalux brand, I 
entered the dimensions of your garage. 
It showed that your setup of four two-
bulb Ô¨Åxtures, right up the center of the 
garage, would provide 42 foot-candles 
of lighting. at‚Äôs acceptable, but not 
great; 50 foot-candles would be better.
e calculator also showed that the 
illumination depended on having the ceil-
ing reÔ¨Çe 80 percent of the light and 
the walls reÔ¨Çe 50 percent. at‚Äôs an 
unrealiÔ¨Üically high amount of reÔ¨Çeivity 
 keeping in mind that it will darken 
slightly aer the Ô¨Ånish is applied.
It‚Äôs also worth noting that the joint 
between the shelf and the edge band 
has to be perfe. ere are many ways 
to ensure that both the shelf edge and 
the edge band are Ô¨Üraight, square and 
smooth. One of the easieÔ¨Ü is to rip the 
plywood and edge banding to rough 
size with a combination blade, then 
clean up the edge on the table saw 
using a glue-line ripping blade. This 
should produce perfe mating surfaces. 
Still, whatever method you use, first 
make some teÔ¨Ü pieces. You want to 
work out any problems before commit-
ting the proje to glue and nails. 
Lighten Up 
a Dark Garage 
e lights in my garage don‚Äôt do the 
job. It‚Äôs a 14 x 30‚Äìfoot building with 
four two-bulb Ô¨Çuorescent Ô¨Åxtures, 
each 4 feet long, running lengthwise 
down the center of the 7-foot-high 
ceiling. e walls and the ceiling are 
bare wood framing. How many 
Ô¨Åxtures should I add? Will it help if I 
paint the wood white?
Adding more light is easier than painting 
bare wood framing or covering the ceil-
ing with drywall. InveÔ¨Üigating how much

for wood framing. When I cut the ceiling 
reÔ¨Çeivity to 20 percent, it called for 
adding a Ô¨Åh Ô¨Åxture. When I also cut the 
walls to 20 percent, the calculator 
showed that six Ô¨Åxtures are needed‚Äî
three evenly spaced lights in two rows 
running down the length of the garage. 
Sure, adding Ô¨Åxtures is adding coÔ¨Ü, 
but the good news is that this design 
provides 49 foot-candles of illumination, 
a better level of light for a work space.
Check the Oil
e owner‚Äôs manual for my traor 
isn‚Äôt clear about whether I need to 
screw the dipÔ¨Üick all the way down  
to check the oil. Do I?
Many manufaurers, such as Troy-Bilt, 
for example, recommend that you 
remove the dipstick, wipe it clean, 
screw it all the way down and then 
unscrew it to check the oil level. 
Still, the lack of clarity in owner‚Äôs 
manuals is annoying, and it isn‚Äôt con-
Ô¨Åned to small-engine equipment. When I 
asked PM senior auto editor Mike Allen 
about it, he said that ambiguity in oil-
How to Save Your Home From a WildÔ¨Åre
As wildÔ¨Åre season looms 
in California, homeowners 
can take solace knowing that 
the last decade‚Äôs devastat-
ing blazes have led to the 
adoption of strict, statisti-
cally eÔ¨Äective house- and 
life-saving building codes. Per 
these code changes, which 
appeared in 2008 for wildÔ¨Åre-
prone regions statewide, a 
marketplace has developed 
for blaze-beating construc-
tion materials. ‚ÄúSome of the 
products are new, and others, 
such as clay rooÔ¨Ång tiles, have 
been modiÔ¨Åed through the addition of Ô¨Åre retardants,‚Äù says Steve Quarles, a University 
of California cooperative extension advisor. Combined with vegetation management to 
reduce Ô¨Çammable material near the home, these items can make a real diÔ¨Äerence in the 
Golden State and elsewhere in helping homes survive a wildÔ¨Åre.  ‚Äî ADAM HADHAZY

Killer Trees
I have about 5 acres of woods, and, 
thanks to wood-eating inses, I don‚Äôt 
have to cut up any Ô¨Üanding trees for 
Ô¨Årewood. Trouble is, not all the trees 
make it to the ground. Some get hung 
up and lean at a 45- to 60-degree 
angle. How can I take these down?
ere‚Äôs virtually no safe way for an ama-
teur to take down such a tree. It‚Äôs not 
that we‚Äôve suddenly become risk-averse 
at PM. Many of our readers own and use 
Ô¨Årearms, fell trees, drive faÔ¨Ü cars and Ô¨Çy 
planes that they‚Äôve built. But some jobs 
are so inherently dangerous that they 
are best handled by professionals in 
almoÔ¨Ü all situations. at‚Äôs what you‚Äôve 
got here, unfortunately. Trees that get 
hung up as the result of a wind Ô¨Üorm, 
inse damage, Ô¨Åre or ice are among the 
moÔ¨Ü diÔ¨Écult to deal with, and the for-
eÔ¨Üry induÔ¨Üry spends a lot of its time 
teaching professionals how to remove 
them. ForeÔ¨Üers call them widowmakers, 
killer trees, hazard trees and a few 
names we can‚Äôt print here. 
So what should you do? Well, pros 
sometimes make a wedge-shaped cut in 
the trunk that gets the tree to fold in on 
itself. at can cause the tree to fall free 
of the hang-up. It‚Äôs among the moÔ¨Ü dan-
gerous cuts a logger can make. Other 
times they use a log skidder, a winch, a 
tractor or an earthmover to drag the 
tree so that it falls free of obÔ¨Üruions.
Having a forester do this will be 
more expensive than the value of the 
wood. But it will create a safer woodlot, 
one you can enjoy, not avoid.

 REACTIVE ATTIC VENTS  ‚Üí Studies of homes destroyed by Ô¨Åres have shown that the 
biggest chink in a home‚Äôs armor is oen the air vents from an attic that let in burn-
ing embers. Vulcan Vent, made by Gunter Manufacturing, keeps the embers out by 
using a special coating that swells a vent‚Äôs air-admitting cells shut when exposed to 
heat. Vulcan Vent‚Äôs coated, self-closing, ¬º-inch-honeycomb aluminum is also avail-
able by the sheet, so homeowners can custom-cut retroÔ¨Åts for their existing vents.
 DECKING ON DEFENSE  ‚Üí For Californian homes built aer 2008 and those undergo-
ing major deck renovation projects in some jurisdictions, codes now require decking 
materials to pass Ô¨Çame-spreading and ‚Äúunder-Ô¨Çame‚Äù tests. Trex, a company based 
in Winchester, Va., now makes a line of wood‚Äìplastic deck boards called Accents: 
Fire Defense, which exceed these tough Ô¨Åre regulations. An eco-friendly, proprietary 
additive in the product allows the deck boards to withstand Ô¨Çames and causes 
them to self-extinguish in high heat. 
 COVERS FOR GUTTERS  ‚Üí Another vulnerable spot for wildÔ¨Åre- threatened homes is 
debris-strewn roof gutters. Code mandates that gutters be free of Ô¨Çammable tree 
litter. Building oÔ¨Écials in the Ô¨Åeld have interpreted this to mean that gutters must 
be covered, Quarles says. One option is the Gutterguard, a hardened, anodized 
aluminum frame that completely caps a gutter. Its stainless-steel Ô¨Åltering mesh 
excludes pine needles and leaves, easing cleaning and allowing rainwater to drain. 
 FLAME-BLOCKING GELS  ‚Üí Before a wildÔ¨Åre forces evacuation, homeowners can 
spray down their homes with products such as Barricade‚Äôs Fire Blocking Gel. is 
absorbent polymer, sprayed from a jug attached to a garden hose, traps water 
molecules in a bubble-like suspension that shuts out Ô¨Çames and heat. e protec-
tion lasts up to 36 hours on treated walls, windows and roofs, then washes oÔ¨Ä 
with water. To eÔ¨Äectively use these gels as part of a Ô¨ÅreprooÔ¨Ång plan, combine with 
Ô¨Åre-retardant rooÔ¨Ång, siding, doors and windows‚Äîplus vegetation management. 
‚Äúese things can work,‚Äù Quarles says. ‚Äúey can certainly help.‚Äù

REPLACING A STARTER MOTOR IS USUALLY A STRAIGHTFORWARD 
BUT INCONVENIENT JOB. BY MIKE ALLEN
is gear-reduion Ô¨Üarter (top) is a 
lightweight drop-in replacement for the 
older Ô¨Üarter that failed. By spinning the 
armature faÔ¨Üer and reducing its output 
speed with a planetary gearbox, it‚Äôs  
possible to get the same Ô¨Üarter power  
in a smaller, lighter package.

Nope‚Äîthe screeching has become the 
only symptom you can elicit. at ban-
shee wail is the teeth on the starter 
motor‚Äôs bendix gear clashing against 
the ring-gear teeth because it‚Äôs not 
completely engaged. 
e solenoid, or on some Ô¨Üarters, 
juÔ¨Ü a threaded part of the armature, 
pushes the bendix gear forward an inch 
or so until it meshes with the ring gear, 
allowing the Ô¨Üarter motor to spin the 
engine over until it starts. When the 
engine rpm exceeds the cranking speed, 
the bendix automatically retras, pre-
venting the engine from spinning the 
Ô¨Üarter too faÔ¨Ü.
At leaÔ¨Ü that‚Äôs how it works in theory. 
Starter motor failure is rarely caused  
by a blown or shorted motor itself‚Äî
usually it‚Äôs a problem with the bendix 
ticking, you resort to that old Ô¨Üandby: a 
jump-Ô¨Üart. A few more screeches grat-
ing enough to make you cringe, and the 
engine Ô¨Ånally spins merrily.
After work, it‚Äôs the same story: 
Clunking and clicking, a few bars of the 
‚ÄúBallad of the Tortured Ring Gear,‚Äù and 
you get to drive home inÔ¨Üead of ride in 
the cab of the tow truck. 
You‚Äôve got a bad Ô¨Üarter motor. Time 
to Ô¨Åx it before you‚Äôre on the bus.
e Way It Works 
 Saturday morning you give your 
battery and charging syÔ¨Üem a full inves-
tigation. Even swapping in the new bat-
tery from your other car doesn‚Äôt help. 
3. If you have ramps, 
they should provide 
enough clearance. If 
you need to jack up 
the car, use 
jackÔ¨Üands and 
chock the wheels. 
Stuck oÔ¨Ä-road? Dig 
a trench under the 
vehicle to crawl into, 
which is aually not 
horrible if it‚Äôs dry.

1. Yes, there‚Äôs a 
Ô¨Üarter motor hiding 
up there. On moÔ¨Ü 
front-engined 
vehicles like this 
Suburban, it‚Äôs well 
and truly buried 
under and behind 
the engine and next 
to the transmission. 
2. Prepare to get 
dirty and uncomfort-
able getting it out. 
Front-wheel-drive 
cars with sideways-
mounted engines 
may have the motor 
mounted above the 
trans, where you can 
reach it from above.

1. If you twist the key and the dash 
lights come on dimly, the solenoid 
buzzes or clicks, or nothing at all hap-
pens, it may well be the battery or the 
cables, not the Ô¨Üarter motor. Charge 
the battery. Your voltmeter should read 
at least 12.6 volts with no electrical 
drain on the battery and the charger 
disconneed for an hour. 
2. Check the battery capacity. I use a 
resiÔ¨Üance-type battery load teÔ¨Üer. A 
good, charged-up battery should deliver 
150 amps for 15 seconds without drop-
ping below 10.5 volts, and should 
recover nearly to the aforementioned 
12.6 volts within a minute.
3. If the battery checks out okay, look for 
poor electrical connections to the 
Ô¨Üarter or solenoid, as well as the bat-
tery and chassis conneions. Accept no 
more than a 0.5-volt voltage drop 
between the battery post and the 
Ô¨Üarter hot poÔ¨Ü. Ditto between the bat-
tery negative poÔ¨Ü and the engine block.
4. Bottom line, there should be 9 to 10 
volts at the Ô¨Üarter motor hot poÔ¨Ü when 
cranking. Don‚Äôt forget to put the car in 
neutral or park and block the wheels so 
you don‚Äôt run yourself over.
5. Battery cables okay? Try jumping‚Äî
with jumper cables‚Äîdirely from the 
battery positive terminal to the Ô¨Üarter 
motor‚Äôs solenoid poÔ¨Ü. If the solenoid 
pulls in and the Ô¨Üarter turns over the 
engine, you‚Äôve got a wiring problem. 
6. If the solenoid doesn‚Äôt pull in and 
energize the armature, try jumping 
direly to the motor‚Äôs armature poÔ¨Ü, 
bypassing the solenoid. If the armature 
spins, the problem is in the solenoid or 
its wiring.
7. Don‚Äôt forget that some antithe sys-
tems will Ô¨Üill disable the Ô¨Üarter even if 
the crooks hot-wire the ignition key. And 
when something goes wrong with that 
alarm, you‚Äôre Ô¨Üranded. It gets worse‚Äî
it‚Äôs usually diÔ¨Écult or impossible to dis-
conne the alarm, in order to keep the 
car thieves from doing so. Be prepared 
for serious reading of the faory shop 
manual or, if your alarm is aermarket, a 
return to the alarm inÔ¨Üaller. 
No More Excuses
 Regardless, you‚Äôve determined 
that the Ô¨Üarter is fried. Time to get to 
it. You might get lucky, especially if you 
have an FWD vehicle, and be able to 
 mechanism or the solenoid. And frankly, 
moÔ¨Ü people will never need to replace 
a Ô¨Üarter motor for the life of their vehi-
cle. Intrepid but underfunded Saturday 
Mechanics might actually dismantle  
a malfunioning Ô¨Üarter and repair it 
themselves. You can Ô¨Üill Ô¨Ånd auto parts 
Ô¨Üores that can get you new bearings, 
brushes and bendix assemblies. Gener-
ally, I juÔ¨Ü exchange the old Ô¨Üarter for a 
new or remanufaured one, because 
Some older GM cars may 
drop a couple of shims in 
your face when you 
remove the Ô¨Üarter. While 
moÔ¨Ü Ô¨Üarter motor 
replacements can simply 
be bolted on right out of 
the box, GM engine blocks 
and Ô¨Üarters are dimen-
sionally inconsiÔ¨Üent 
enough to require 
shimming for proper tooth 
engagement. Improper 
tooth engagement leads 
to a myriad of maladies: 
e clearance will be too 
tight or the teeth may not 
engage fully, giving you 
gnashing teeth inÔ¨Üead of 
the hummingbird whir of a 
cranking engine. e beÔ¨Ü 
place to Ô¨Üart is to replace 
the shim or shims that 
came out with the old 
Ô¨Üarter. Don‚Äôt even bother 
to hook up the wiring yet. 
Remove the sheet-metal 
cover over the bell 
housing so you can 
visualize the Ô¨Üarter‚Äôs 
teeth and the ring gear on 
the Ô¨Çywheel or Ô¨Çex plate. 
With a screwdriver, pry 
the bendix gear forward 
to engage it with the ring 
gear. While keeping the 
gears meshed, measure 
the gap between the 
closeÔ¨Ü to the center of 
the engine, but remove 
the other one. e inner 
bolt will hold the motor 
up. Now you can slide the 
new shim in (or the old 
one out). ReinÔ¨Üall the 
outer bolt, tighten the 
inner bolt, and you can 
recheck the gear 
engagement.
Occasionally, a Ô¨Üarter 
motor will have proper 
radial clearance but Ô¨Üill 
exhibit incorre engage-
ment. It also may be 
necessary to shim the 
bendix gear to get full 
engagement. I‚Äôll refer you 
to the shop manual.
repairing one doesn‚Äôt save much money. 
On the other hand, if you have a rare or 
hard-to-Ô¨Ånd Ô¨Üarter it might be neces-
sary to Ô¨Åx what you have. Usually, auto 
eleric shops can rebuild or repair a 
Ô¨Üarter with a bad armature, shorted 
Ô¨Åeld windings, bad brushes, a bad com-
mutator, or even a bad solenoid if there 
is no alternative. Be prepared to wait a 
few days or more.
Is Your Starter Motor 
Really Bad?
 Before you get all greasy under 
the car, here are some tips for diagnos-
ing a bad Ô¨Üarter:

 


teeth with a 0.032-inch 
wire gauge. Surprise‚Äî
there might have been 
such a gauge included in 
the new Ô¨Üarter‚Äôs box. If 
not, a paper clip is pretty 
close. If the gap is less 
than 0.032 inch, add a 
shim. If it‚Äôs more, remove 
one. You don‚Äôt need to 
remove the Ô¨Üarter motor 
to do this‚Äîthat‚Äôs why the 
shims have a slotted end. 
Loosen the Ô¨Üarter bolt





damages the teeth. Labor to remove 
the transmission and replace the Ô¨Çex 
plate or Ô¨Çywheel will be 6 to 8 hours, 
more if you have four-wheel drive. Add 
in the cost of parts and a ring gear 
replacement could easily reach a thou-
sand dollars or more.
Take your old Ô¨Üarter motor to the 
auto parts Ô¨Üore and exchange it. Don‚Äôt 
be surprised if the new Ô¨Üarter bears only 
a faint resemblance to the older one. e 
industry has been transitioning to 
smaller, lighter gear-reduion Ô¨Üarters 
that use a higher-speed motor coupled 
to a planetary gearset to spin your 
engine faÔ¨Üer while using less current. 
e new Ô¨Üarter will have grease already 
in places where it‚Äôs needed, so no further 
lubrication is necessary or desirable.
Replacement of the new Ô¨Üarter is 
Ô¨Üraightforward, at leaÔ¨Ü if your vehicle 
doesn‚Äôt require shimming the new 
starter (see page 104). Snug up the 
mounting bolts, reinÔ¨Üall any braces, cov-
ers or heat shields, and hook up the wir-
ing. All you need to do now is reconne 
the battery ground, take the vehicle oÔ¨Ä 
the Ô¨Üands and Ô¨Üart ‚Äôer up. 
FC
swap Ô¨Üarters from above the car. If not, 
the starter usually lives in a really 
remote location well underneath the 
car, somewhere near the side of the 
transmission. Don‚Äôt try to do this on a 
hot car‚Äîwhich might seem to be super-
fluous advice if you can‚Äôt even get it 
Ô¨Üarted‚Äîbut invariably the exhauÔ¨Ü sys-
tem is nearby, and burns hurt. Also, pro-
teive eyewear is de rigueur, because 
you‚Äôll be dropping flakes of rust and 
underhood dirt from direly above your 
head into your baby blues. While you‚Äôre 
waiting for the car to cool oÔ¨Ä, chock the 
wheels and jack it up a foot or so. 
Ramps will work, but I prefer a pair of 
Ô¨Üurdy jackÔ¨Üands. On the other hand, 
I‚Äôve also been forced to do this in the 
middle of a muddy Ô¨Åeld by scooping out 
a trench to lie in.
Remove the battery ground. Now 
you can go below and remove the wires 
to the Ô¨Üarter. ere will be a fat wire 
from the battery or, if your car uses 
one, an external solenoid. There will 
also be one smaller wire, either a ring 
lug on a Ô¨Üud or a spade lug, from the 
ignition key. Older vehicles with points-
and-distributor ignition may have a 
third wire to the coil, bypassing the bal-
laÔ¨Ü resiÔ¨Üor. Don‚Äôt get them confused.
Now get a socket and ratchet and 
probably an extension, and remove the 
bolts holding the Ô¨Üarter to the block. 
You may also need to remove a heat 
shield, brace or sheet-metal cover to get 
everything loose. Don‚Äôt drop the Ô¨Üarter 
onto your head as the laÔ¨Ü bolt comes 
out; it‚Äôs as heavy as a bowling ball.
Don‚Äôt get out from under the car 
juÔ¨Ü yet. Mark one tooth on the ring gear 
with some spray paint or even chalk, 
and inspe every single one of the 140 
to 160 teeth by turning the engine over 
with a big screwdriver for one full revo-
lution. Seriously damaged teeth will 
require replacement of the Ô¨Çex plate or 
flywheel, which commences with 
removing the transmission from the 
vehicle. Fear of the necessity of this 
should motivate you to Ô¨Åx a balky-but-
still-barely-working starter before it

All Wound Up
A 
ere are two ways that window-
winder handles are customarily 
attached to their axles. If there is a 
removable plastic trim piece in the cen-
ter of the handle, pry it up. Then you 
can unscrew the Phillips-head bolt and 
take the handle with you to your local 
parts counter. Many older cars use a 
diÔ¨Äerent syÔ¨Üem, with a large-diameter 
wire clip that slips over the end of the 
axle and drops into a slot. It won‚Äôt be 
immediately obvious how to remove it. 
There‚Äôs usually very little clearance 
between the winder and the door panel, 
so it‚Äôs impossible to see what‚Äôs going 
on. I‚Äôve used a small screwdriver, a bent 
coat hanger, a rag and even a big Ô¨Åsh-
hook (don‚Äôt ask) to remove these dia-
bolical devices. The simplest way is 
with, of course, a special tool, which 
you can pick up for cheap at the auto 
parts Ô¨Üore.
And yes, it‚Äôs a good idea to use the 
tool to remove the winder even if all you 
really need to do is get it out of the way 
to service something inside the door. 
Guess what? ey also make other spe-
cial tools to remove the clips that hold 
the door panel to the door. 
Q 
I broke the window-
 winder handle oÔ¨Ä the 
driver‚Äôs door on my van. I‚Äôd like 
to buy a new handle, but I 
can‚Äôt Ô¨Ågure out how to get the 
old handle oÔ¨Ä to match it up.

If you‚Äôre not fussy about matching 
the original, you can Ô¨Ånd a serviceable 
replacement at the auto parts Ô¨Üore or 
even in the auto department at many 
mass merchandisers without having to 
pay the dealer‚Äôs outrageous prices.
Water Crisis
I purchased a 2006 Nissan PathÔ¨Ånder 
SE with an automatic transmission in 
November 2009. I noticed a slight 
vibration coming from the rear that I 
thought was probably caused by a tire 
imbalance. A month ago, on a long trip, 
I noticed that the transmission was 
vibrating and dragging down the speed 
whenever I let up on the gas pedal.  
A quick Internet search revealed case 
aer case of the same vibrating 
problem from other PathÔ¨Ånder 
owners. It was determined that water 
from the radiator was somehow

ratchet in the glovebox.
More paranoid readers may wish to 
replace the radiator pre-emptively or to 
disconne the original trans cooler and 
hook up a bypass cooler in front of the 
radiator. I would recommend against 
the bypass cooler, at leaÔ¨Ü in the winter, 
as the transmission cooler in the radia-
tor will warm the transmission up prop-
erly when it‚Äôs cold out. It‚Äôs juÔ¨Ü as impor-
tant that the trans temperature is warm 
enough for proper operations as it is to 
keep it from overheating.
Hot Time in the 
Old Town Tonight
I‚Äôve read a lot about eleric and 
hybrid cars, but one queÔ¨Üion I haven‚Äôt 
heard answered is how they supply 
heat or cooling to the passengers. 
Using the batteries to operate an 
eleric heater or air conditioner 
would drain them and shorten the 
already limited running time.
Exaly. Running the heater, heater fan 
and defroÔ¨Üer (which includes the a/c 
compressor to dehumidify the air pass-
ing through the heater core and blowing 
onto the windshield), the wipers and 
headlights will subÔ¨Üantially reduce the 
range of eleric vehicles driven in win-
ter climates. Ditto for EVs used in 
places like Vegas, Phoenix or HouÔ¨Üon 
due to the increased a/c load. Some 
PHEVs (including, supposedly, the Volt 
and Prius PHEVs) let you precondition 
the cabin while they‚Äôre Ô¨Üill on their char-
ger in the morning, but Ô¨Üill.
Correion Faor
When the auto manufaurers design 
cars, they design them with a 
certain-size wheel. However, dealers 
nowadays order them with larger-
diameter wheels. What eÔ¨Äe (plus or 
minus) does this have on the speed-
ometer? I had a VW Beetle once, and 
put on larger tires‚Äîthe speedometer 
reading was oÔ¨Ä by 10 miles an hour, 
enough to get me a ticket. 
Larger-diameter tires travel farther over 
the road for a single revolution of the 
wheel, so the speedo will read slower 
than the aual road speed. How far oÔ¨Ä 
is direly proportional to the diÔ¨Äerence 
in circumference of the tire. Generally, 
the optional tire sizes available on a 
new car are lower in proÔ¨Åle as well as 
seeping into the transmission, ruining 
it and, worse, voiding the drivetrain 
warranty as a result. I have three 
queÔ¨Üions: One, how would water from 
the radiator enter the transmission? 
Two, is there any way to corre this 
problem before it ruins the transmis-
sion and radiator, requiring expensive 
repairs and/or replacement? And 
three, why hasn‚Äôt there been a recall 
for this problem by Nissan? 
Virtually all automatic transmissions are 
cooled by a loop of tubing routed through 
one of the radiator end tanks. A failure in 
this cooling tubing will allow coolant (not 
water) to be forced into the transmission 
Ô¨Çuid. is mixture of ethylene glycol and 
water emulsiÔ¨Åed in the mineral-based 
transmission Ô¨Çuid will rapidly damage 
moÔ¨Ü everything inside the trans, from 
the organic friion material in the clutch 
packs to the rubber O-rings and seals to 
the Ô¨Üeel gears and bearings. 
Nissan had issues with a number of 
radiators supplied to them and may or 
may not cover the radiator and trans-
mission repairs under warranty. Recalls 
are generally for safety-related prob-
lems, not durability. In this case, there 
should be at leaÔ¨Ü a service bulletin, but 
there isn‚Äôt. Nissan has replaced some 
radiators and repaired some of these 
transmissions for free, but many own-
ers have been forced to pay part or all of 
the coÔ¨Ü. MoÔ¨Ü of the aÔ¨Äeed vehicles 
seem to be 2005 and 2006 PathÔ¨Ånd-
ers. EÔ¨Üimates to rebuild the transmis-
sion run somewhere between $2200 
and $5000. Ouch.
Those readers with potentially 
aÔ¨Äeed vehicles should regularly check 
the coolant and transmission Ô¨Çuid for 
signs of cross-contamination. (Aually, 
everyone should.) is will be tough to 
do for the transmission, as the dipÔ¨Üick 
is held down with a 10-mm nut, preclud-
ing checking the Ô¨Çuid while refueling 
unless you carry a 10-mm socket and

Simple Spark TeÔ¨Üer
Your (insert internal-

start. You‚Äôve worn down 
the battery, pulled the 
Ô¨Üarter rope, hand-propped 
or jumped on the kick-Ô¨Üart 
until you‚Äôre blue in the face. 
Sure, you‚Äôve got sophiÔ¨Üi-

for diagnosing virtually 
anything wrong with 
your new OBD-
equipped auto-

do you plug that 
$400 scan tool into 
the dirt bike or 
snowmobile? e 
Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü thing to check 
for is spark. e time- 
honored way is to pull a 
plug wire and use a spark 
teÔ¨Üer or the spark plug 
itself to visualize a tiny 
0.022-inch spark jumping 
a plug gap. Getting this 
wrong can make the  
spark jump to your arm, 
which, I assure you, really 
freakin‚Äô hurts.
ere‚Äôs a middle ground. 
Our pals at Graham Tool

this simple-to-use $15 
inline spark teÔ¨Üer. JuÔ¨Ü 
pull the high-voltage wire 
from the spark plug and 
put the teÔ¨Üer in series 
with the plug and coil using 
the short high-voltage 
jumper cord. Crank the

the teÔ¨Üer will Ô¨Çash. It 
works even on diÔ¨Üributor-

It‚Äôs not necessary to put an automatic 
trans in neutral while sitting at a traÔ¨Éc 
light, and I‚Äôd prefer you leave it in drive 
while approaching the light as well. It‚Äôll 
use less fuel and leave you with the abil-
ity to rapidly move out of the way of 
trouble if needed. Less fuel? Yup, the 
injeors are shut down completely 
when coaÔ¨Üing in gear, while idling in 
neutral Ô¨Üill consumes fuel.
On the other hand, I‚Äôd be happier if 
you used neutral or drive while rolling 
downhill, even if you‚Äôre on a slope that‚Äôs 
Ô¨Üeep enough to force the vehicle ahead 
while it‚Äôs Ô¨Üill in reverse gear. e trans-
mission computer may get a triÔ¨Çe con-
fused if the vehicle speed sensor tells it 
it‚Äôs going forward while it‚Äôs in reverse 
gear, turning on the Check Engine light 
and setting a trouble code.
And in spite of the recommendations 
of the car companies that transmission 
Ô¨Çuid is Ô¨Åll-for-life, I recommend changing 
the ATF regularly‚Äîevery 30 K miles, 
unless your car uses $12-a-quart syn-
thetic ATF, in which case I‚Äôd double that.
ey Call Me the Wanderer
I have a 2008 Volvo C30 T5 with 
20,000 miles and recently heard what 
sounded like a thumping tire. All four 
tires have a slight cupping on the 
inside tread. ese tires have been 
rotated every 6000 miles. Toe-in and 
camber were slightly oÔ¨Ä on the front, 
but the rear was in spec. My mechanic 
said the only way to eliminate this 
cupping problem is to rotate the tires 
every oil change (3000 miles). is 
sounds a bit much. Can you shed 
some light on this? Even the tire 
manufaurer recommends around 
6500 to 7000 miles for rotation.
A small amount of toe-in is normal, to 
compensate for the slight alignment 
changes that occur as the suspension 
wears and slightly sags. Typically, sus-
pension wear makes the tires toe out, 
which will cause a wandering feeling 
and, you guessed it, cupping on the inner 
edges. I doubt that your suspension is 
worn out aer only 20,000 miles. I‚Äôll 
assume your alignment technician 
checked the integrity of the tie-rod ends, 
control-arm bushings and ball joints, 
front and rear.
Some tires, mounted on some vehi-
cles, are more prone to cupping. I‚Äôd 
wider, with a rolling radius that‚Äôs very 
close. For inÔ¨Üance, a typical 205/60-16 
tire is very close in overall circumference 
to a 225/50-17. The 16-inch tire is 
rated at 815 revolutions per mile while 
the 17-inch is rated at 801 rpm. at‚Äôs 
only a 1.7 percent change, smaller than 
the error caused by the reduction in 
diameter as the tires wear. 
If you muÔ¨Ü swap for a size that isn‚Äôt 
equivalent, mechanically driven  speedos 
can have a gear swapped out in the 
transmission to account for signiÔ¨Åcantly 
different sizes. Electronically driven 
speedos can sometimes be repro-
grammed by the dealership to the same 
end. Check the shop manual for the 
exa procedure.
Old Habits Die Hard
Finally, at age 60, I bought my Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü 
vehicle with an automatic transmis-
sion (2008 F-150, no manual oÔ¨Äered), 
and I‚Äôd like your wisdom on the care 
and feeding of modern automatics. In 
a manual, I always ease it out of gear 
as I come to a Ô¨Üop without using the 
clutch, and I never sit at a light with 
the clutch depressed. Should I put the 
automatic in neutral when waiting at 
a light and then shi into drive when 
the light changes? I also use hills and 
gravity to turn around and pull into 
parking spaces: With a manual, I back 
uphill into a space and then put in the 
clutch to dri forward with the 
transmission in reverse and then back 
up into the space to Ô¨Üraighten out. I 
do this in my new truck too, but I 
wonder if I‚Äôm doing any damage as I 
dri forward (downhill about 30 feet) 
with the transmission in reverse. 
Should I always have the transmission 
in the gear direion I‚Äôm aually 
moving in? Finally, what do you 
recommend for periodic TLC so the 
transmission will laÔ¨Ü the 200,000 
miles I expe from this truck?

His Cup Runneth Over
LaÔ¨Ü spring my 2008 Buick met with  
a snow bank due to icy roads. Upon 
return from the shop for some 
collision repairs on the complete 
front-bumper assembly, I noticed that 
the lower air dam was missing. e 
collision shop manager told me that 
the new replacement bumpers have 
no provisions for attaching the air 
dam so he leaves them oÔ¨Ä. I‚Äôm 
assuming these have a purpose, as 
they are on a new vehicle and if it 
wasn‚Äôt required GM would not put 
them on. Will this aÔ¨Äe anything? 
Of course it will, or, as you say, GM 
wouldn‚Äôt have put it there. at lower air 
dam keeps air from getting under the 
car, and its absence will, at leaÔ¨Ü slightly, 
increase drag and fuel consumption. 
More importantly, it may reduce the 
amount of air Ô¨Çowing through the radia-
tor and make your car run hotter. e 
shop should have drilled the appropriate 
holes for the corre faÔ¨Üeners and rein-
Ô¨Üalled the air dam for a proper repair.
Runnin‚Äô Hot
I have a 1963 Corvair with a 1965 
engine. I am having trouble with it 
vapor-locking when running at slow 
speeds, or sitting in a parade route. 
What do you suggeÔ¨Ü to Ô¨Üop this?
e simple answer would be to recom-
mend some 1965 gasoline, but I doubt 
you can Ô¨Ånd any. Here‚Äôs the problem: e 
vapor pressure of gasoline is much 
higher today than it was when your car 
was manufaured. We‚Äôre using more of 
the barrel of crude oil than ever, and 
some of those hydrocarbons are more 
volatile and boil at lower temperatures. 
Fuel-injeed cars aren‚Äôt as sensitive to 
this, because the fuel is pressurized to  
30 to 60 psi in the fuel rail, not at atmos-
pheric pressure in the carburetor‚Äôs Ô¨Çoat 
bowl. At low speeds or in parades, the 
engine compartment temperatures are 
higheÔ¨Ü, and the fuel literally boils in the 
fuel lines, fuel pump or Ô¨Çoat bowl. Some 
‚Äô70s vintage cars used a bypass line that 
returned fuel to the tank to keep fuel 
temps down, but you‚Äôd need to add 
another Ô¨Åtting to the tank for the return 
line to achieve this. 
Changing from the mechanical 
engine-mounted fuel pump to a remote 
elerical one might help. So might insu-
lating the fuel lines and Ô¨Çoat bowl with 
some aluminum-faced insulation. I know 
a fellow who rigged up a windshield-
washer pump to a cooler full of ice and 
water in the cab of his motorhome. 
When his engine Ô¨Üarted to Ô¨Üutter as it 
went up a hill, he‚Äôd squirt some ice water 
on the Ô¨Çoat bowl. It gave him a place to 
keep some cold drinks on ice, too.

other major 3D processes currently 
employed by Hollywood and the elec-
tronics induÔ¨Üry. MoÔ¨Ü 3D movies in the 
theater use a specialized screen and 
polarized glasses to deliver 3D projec-
tion, while the new 3D home theater 
gear generally relies upon shutter 
glasses that are synchronized to a TV 
that runs at a high frame rate.
True, the anaglyph editing process 
can tint the color of your video, but it 
works with equipment you probably 
already own‚Äîrequiring no major inveÔ¨Ü-
ment to play back the video. Perhaps 
that is why it is often employed by 
movie Ô¨Üudios for their own home video 
releases. Recent Blu-ray movies such as 
Coraline and My Bloody Valentine used 
the red-and-blue-Ô¨Åltered glasses. 
Stereoscopic Optics
Aually making the 3D rig is the 
easy part. As Ron Proor describes it: 
‚ÄúYou can juÔ¨Ü drill some holes in a bit of 
scrap metal and bolt your cameras on.‚Äù 
A ¬º-20 bolt will thread into the tapped 
tripod mounting hole in moÔ¨Ü cameras. 
If you‚Äôre mounting to a metal bar or 
plate, we‚Äôd suggest cutting slots to 
allow for Ô¨Åne adjuÔ¨Üment of the diÔ¨Üance 
between the video cameras. Ideally, the 
distance between the two camera 
cheapeÔ¨Ü 3D camcorder on the market 
right now is Panasonic‚Äôs $21,000 AG-
3DA1, and even that requires a conÔ¨Üel-
lation of specialized equipment and 
soware to deliver usable 3D footage. 
What‚Äôs more, the gear that eleron-
ics manufaurers are juÔ¨Ü now intro-
ducing to the market to edit and play 
3D content requires an almost total 
replacement of your exiÔ¨Üing computer 
and AV equipment. I don‚Äôt really want to 
buy a new graphics card, computer 
screen, HDTV (which I juÔ¨Ü got, thank 
you very much), home theater receiver 
and Blu-ray player, but I do kind of like 
the idea of making a cheap and easy 3D 
aion Ô¨Çick Ô¨Üarring my cat. 
Fortunately for me, a hobbyiÔ¨Ü sub-
culture has sprung up to address the 
unmet need for low-produion-value 
at-home 3D moviemaking‚Äîa move-
ment dedicated to the art of building 
stereoscopic camera rigs using two 
off-the-shelf inexpensive camcorders 
mounted on a rail. It started when 
husband-and-wife team Ron and 
AmyJo Proctor, both students at 
Weber State University, poÔ¨Üed inÔ¨Üruc-
tions for bolting together two Kodak 
Zx1 camcorders. ‚ÄúWe kind of built it on 
a lark,‚Äù says Ron. ‚ÄúWe wanted a Flip-
style video camera for chasing our 
2-year-old. ey were so aÔ¨Äordable that 
we decided to buy a pair. Once we had 
those, the jump to 3D was natural.‚Äù e 
Proors used a 157-year-old process 
that is known as anaglyph 3D, which 
uses the same iconic red-and-blue 
glasses that turned 1950s comics into 
virtual pop-up books. 
e anaglyph process works by Ô¨Ål-
tering the vision of a viewer‚Äôs le eye 
through a red Ô¨Ålter and the right eye 
through a cyan (blue) Ô¨Ålter. Each frame 
of video is produced with two super-
imposed images that have been Ô¨Üereo-
scopically separated, then subjeed to 
color subtraion in a computer image-
editing program. When viewing these 
superimposed images through anaglyph 
3D glasses, the brain interprets and 
combines the complementary colors, 
creating the illusion of depth.

plicated than it aually is in praice. It 
is certainly far simpler than the two

syÔ¨Üem is the easy 
part. JuÔ¨Ü cut a 
channel in either 
metal or wood, 
then mount two 
inexpensive video 
cameras using two 
Ô¨Üandard ¬º-20 
bolts, washers and 
some wingnuts. 
Try to match the 
diÔ¨Üance between 
human eyes‚Äî 
2.48 inches. 
qv7 My 
Steadicam rig 
featured a 
makeshi gimbal 
formed from a 
skateboard 
bearing and a 
modiÔ¨Åed RC car‚Äôs 
U-joint. I inÔ¨Üalled 
the bearing inside 
a piece of PVC 
tubing, then ran a 
5/16  bolt through 
the length of the 
tube, threading it 
into the plaÔ¨Üic 
U-joint. To cover 
the PVC pipe, I 
used a rubber 
bicycle handle grip.
qt7is 
part was tricky. I 
built a counter-
balance from 
punched Ô¨Üeel Ô¨Çat 
Ô¨Üock trimmed and 
hand-bent into a 
crescent, then 
carefully weighted 
it with various- 
size magnets.


Transforming video 
of my cat into an 
anaglyph 3D movie 
was surprisingly 
simple. I converted 
the le video clip 
to red (by 
subtraing blue 
and green) and the 
right clip to blue 
(by subtraing 
red). To make the 
Ô¨Ånished frame, I 
overlaid le and 
right into a single 
composite image, 
tweaking the 
position slightly to 
get better 
Ô¨Üereoscopic 
separation. Now, 
seen through 3D 
glasses, my cat 
leaps oÔ¨Ä  
the screen.
Adding Dimension
e Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü Ô¨Üep is to load both clips 
into your video-editing soware. Next 
you want to trim the video so that both 
clips start on the same frame. Then 
search for the menu option that lets 
you adjuÔ¨Ü color controls (your soware 
might call this levels or channels). You‚Äôll 
know you‚Äôre in the right menu when 
you see sliders for the colors red, green 
and blue. 
Anaglyph video editing is essentially 
an exercise in color subtraion. For the 
le-eye footage, dial down or turn oÔ¨Ä 
the blue and green channels. For the 
right eye, subtra the red channel.
Once that‚Äôs complete, you need to 
create a composite of the two clips. 
(Again, the language diÔ¨Äers with the 
soware: Some call the process over-
lay or blending.) That should merge 
the left-eye and right-eye tracks 
together into one. You‚Äôre probably 
going to want to throw on some 
anaglyph 3D glasses to make sure 
you‚Äôve done it right. 
Which brings up the queÔ¨Üion: Can 
you do it wrong? And the answer is, sort 
of. You may Ô¨Ånd that, aer all of your 
work, the 3D isn‚Äôt that apparent in your 
clip. MoÔ¨Ü video-editing programs allow 
you to artiÔ¨Åcially separate the le- and 
right-eye channels a bit by cropping the 
images slightly, then redoing the com-
posite. By skewing the stereoscopic 
separation, you can add depth to the 
resulting video without reshooting.
(Aer this lengthy explanation, it‚Äôs 
worth noting that this fall, a Roxio-
branded 3D soware suite from Sonic 
Solutions will completely automate the 
3D editing process.)
In the end, my 2-minute feline Ô¨Çick 
isn‚Äôt going to break any box-office 
records, but the 3D eÔ¨Äe worked. And I 
can easily share my anaglyph 3D clips 
by poÔ¨Üing to YouTube, so that anyone 
with a pair of red-and-blue 3D glasses 
can enjoy them.
And by the way, those glasses are 
ridiculously cheap and easy to acquire. 
On Amazon.com, 50-packs of paper 
and cellophane glasses can be had for 
$30. Or, if you think that 3D video pro-
duion may become a lifeÔ¨Üyle for you,  
opt for the fancier, hard plaÔ¨Üic kind for 
around $6 each‚Äîthey‚Äôre more durable, 
and about as fashionable as red-and-
blue-tinted eyewear can be.
FC
lenses should match the Ô¨Üereoscopic 
separation of human eyes, which is typi-
cally 2.48 inches. AdjuÔ¨Üments to this 
separation allow for a variable depth of 
Ô¨Åeld, but too much separation will result 
in an unresolvable image. 
Once you‚Äôve created a mounting 
bracket (it doesn‚Äôt need to be metal; 
you can also use wood or plaÔ¨Üic), it can 
be aÔ¨Éxed to almoÔ¨Ü anything‚Äîtripod, 
bicycle, car hood, helmet‚Äîwith what-
ever hardware or adhesive you prefer. I 
wanted maximum mobility and mini-
mum camera shake, so I decided to 
complicate the project for myself by 
designing and building a homemade 
Steadicam.
The company that makes Steadi-
cams, TiÔ¨Äen, sells the Merlin, a very nice 
camcorder-friendly version of its profes-
sional camera Ô¨Üabilizer, for $850 (the 
company also has in the works a Steadi-
cam for iPhones that should coÔ¨Ü less 
than $200). But I was looking for a solu-
tion that was more in the $30 price 
range. I attached the camera bracket to 
a makeshift gimbal I constructed by 
combining a plaÔ¨Üic U-joint from an RC 
car with a ball bearing mounted in a 
¬Ω-inch PVC handle. To keep the camera 
level, I bent a 36-inch-long piece of Ô¨Üeel 
Ô¨Çat Ô¨Üock into an arc to a as a counter-
weight, then I made Ô¨Åne adjuÔ¨Üments by 
attaching various weight magnets to 
the bar. Because of the ball bearing, the 
entire apparatus was able to rotate 
freely relative to the handle, while the 
U-joint allows the cameras to maintain 
position horizontally. 
To be honeÔ¨Ü, it takes quite a bit of 
tinkering to get this thing perfely level, 
and then keeping it level is another skill 
set entirely. Even with a professional 
Steadicam, you need to keep your arms 
held close to your body and walk 
smoothly to get the beÔ¨Ü eÔ¨Äes.
In-Depth Editing
When you are done recording, 
you should have two separate video 
clips that need to be uploaded (make 
sure to save one as ‚Äúle‚Äù and the other 
as ‚Äúright‚Äù to keep yourself organized). 
To edit the footage, I used Sony Vegas 
Pro 9 ($600), but many less expensive 
video-editing packages can do the job.

What You Need 
to Know About  
Windows Phone 7
A New Type of Mobile Interface
A  
I‚Äôm kind of excited too, but before 
we get carried away, let‚Äôs pause 
for some background. 
When it comes to discussing Win-
dows Mobile (a name Microsoft has  
ditched for the seemingly more market-
able ‚ÄúWindows Phone‚Äù), let‚Äôs juÔ¨Ü say 
that it‚Äôs always been pretty diÔ¨Écult for 
me to hold my tongue. While other 
mobile operating systems such as 
Google‚Äôs Android, Apple‚Äôs iPhone OS 
and Palm‚Äôs webOS brought intuitive 
and user-friendly interfaces to smart-
phones, Microsoft‚Äôs mobile platform 
seemed Ô¨Üuck in the technological dark 
ages‚Äîcumbersome, unintuitive and 
apparently designed to fruÔ¨Ürate.
This frustration was compounded 
by the fa that Microso was clearly 
Q 
I‚Äôm excited about the upcoming 
Windows Phone 7 cellphones. 
What‚Äôs new about the operating system?  
Can older Windows Mobile phones be 
upgraded to run it? 
capable of producing a fantaÔ¨Üic mobile 
user interface. Aer all, this was the 
company behind last year‚Äôs brilliant 
Zune HD portable media player, which 
had a UI that was both easy on the eyes 
and simple to navigate‚Äîa fa that had 
critics (myself included) wondering why 
Microso didn‚Äôt juÔ¨Ü Ô¨Üick a phone in 
the darn thing.
Well, with the new Windows Phone 7 
line of cellphones, which is coming out 
late this year, the company has basically 
done juÔ¨Ü that. e new phone platform 
is a complete reboot‚Äîit bears little 
resemblance to previous versions of 
Windows Mobile and cribs the beÔ¨Ü ele-
ments of the Zune HD‚Äôs interface. 
e new OS looks promising for two 
key reasons. FirÔ¨Ü, it attempts to bridge 
together various features from across 
the massive Microsoft ecosystem‚Äî
Windows Phone borrows the Zune 
HD‚Äôs music- and movie-playing abilities 
and even integrates Xbox Live, allowing 
the user to access his gaming achieve-
ments and friends liÔ¨Ü and do a little bit 
of multiplayer gaming direly on the 
handset.
e other cause for excitement: the 
platform‚Äôs interface. MoÔ¨Ü touchscreen 
smartphones are navigated by Ô¨Çipping 
through distinct screens. With Win-
dows Phone 7, the phone screen feels 
like a window looking onto a single, 
large panel. As you swipe the screen, 
that window moves Ô¨Çuidly over this vir-
tual space. The result is a welcome 
departure from interfaces that seem 
In Windows Phone 7, the phone screen feels like a window looking onto a single, large 
panel. As you swipe the screen, that window moves Ô¨Çuidly over this virtual space.


buttons they can be peppered with‚Äî
are an attempt to create consiÔ¨Üency 
and make sure all Windows Phone 7 
devices are able to run all of the plat-
form‚Äôs programs without a hitch.
Of course, it‚Äôs still a couple of 
months before the Windows Phone 7 
handsets aually come out, and a lot of 
questions remain until then‚Äîwe still 
don‚Äôt know how good third-party apps 
will be, how long the phones‚Äô batteries 
will laÔ¨Ü or whether there will be any 
unforeseen bugs. But, at leaÔ¨Ü on paper, 
Windows Phone 7 seems like it could 
deÔ¨Ånitely be a winner. 
Picking Power Cords 
My phone can charge through either  
a USB conneion or an AC adapter. 
Will using one or the other cause my 
phone to charge faÔ¨Üer? 
Not all conneions are created equal. 
Take the ubiquitous USB cord: It typically 
draws a charge from a computer at a 
maximum current of 500 milliamps‚Äî
significantly less than the 750 mA 
allowed by a lot of phone AC plugs. So 
yes, charging with an AC adapter will 
oen get the job done quicker than using 
a computer-plugged USB cord.            FC
more concerned with mimicking the 
iPhone experience than creating some-
thing new.
So can older Windows Mobile 
phones be upgraded to run the new 
OS? No. In fa, Microso has issued 
Ô¨Üri guidelines by which all Windows 
Phone 7 devices will have to abide. 
ese rules‚Äîwhich govern everything 
from what kind of touchscreen these 
phones can have, to how many physical

NTSB report, night-vision goggles may 
have prevented 13. TAWS might have pre-
vented another 17: In the 7 seconds 
before Bunker‚Äôs helicopter hit trees, such 
a system would have detected that he was 
Ô¨Çying too low and given him three loud 
warnings to pull up. A September 2009 
NTSB report recommended every medi-
cal helicopter also be equipped with a 
Ô¨Çight data recorder, plus either autopi-
lot or two pilots. 
After his injuries healed, Godfrey 
climbed into a helicopter and returned 
to work. He was on duty the night Trooper 
2 went down nearly four years later. He 
heard air trafÔ¨Åc controllers calling Bun-
ker by radio, heard the empty static of  
no reply. He even drove to Walker Mill 
Regional Park to try to assist at the scene. 
Watching his friends die in machines 
that are supposed to save lives‚Äîtwice‚Äî
galvanized him. ‚ÄúThat was a turning 
point for me,‚Äù Godfrey says. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt 
going to shut up.‚Äù 
He began talking with the media 
about the industry‚Äôs shoddy safety prac-
tices. He became the chairman of Vision 
Zero, reviving a dormant effort by the 
Association of Air Medical Services to 
raise the safety awareness of Ô¨Çight crews. 
Godfrey still pulls on a flightsuit three 
nights a week and tries to save another 
life, but he refuses to Ô¨Çy in any helicopter 
without Ô¨Çight dispatch, in-Ô¨Çight tracking, 
a terrain awareness and warning system 
and night-vision goggles. ‚ÄúIf this industry 
is unsafe,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúno one beneÔ¨Åts.‚Äù 
Since 2005, the FAA has issued guide-
lines encouraging medical helicopter 
companies to install safety technology 
voluntarily. In 2006, the safety board 
again urged the FAA to tighten regula-
tions, and the administration refused. 
Eight fatal crashes killed 29 people in 
2008, the deadliest year yet. In April 2009, 
Allen announced the agency would write 
ofÔ¨Åcial safety rules. Since then, as this arti-
cle went to press, eight more medical heli-
copters had crashed, leaving 12 dead. 
‚ÄúThe problem is that in 2006 we heard 
that most of these things were going to 
be done voluntarily, and four years later 
we‚Äôre still seeing the FAA talking about 
starting the rule-making process,‚Äù Hers-
man says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just too slow.‚Äù                     FC

Chance Mikkelson learned his trade the old-
fashioned way. ‚ÄúI built my Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü engine‚Äîa Chevy 
V8‚Äîwith my dad when I was 14,‚Äù he says. In 2007, 
Mikkelson opened his own shop, Dexter Manufauring, 
and works on engines of all vintages and size. ‚ÄúOne day I‚Äôm 
assembling the heads of a Maserati V8, and the next I‚Äôm 
resleeving a lawnmower cylinder.‚Äù  During oÔ¨Ä-hours, he 
might be fabricating a fuel-injeion syÔ¨Üem for a Ford 
Model A. Oen, he completes projes for fruÔ¨Ürated DIYers. 
‚ÄúWhen guys buy a bunch of go-faÔ¨Ü parts,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúthe 
engine rarely runs right. You have to Ô¨Ågure out which parts 
work beÔ¨Ü together. at‚Äôs the fun part.‚Äù  ‚Äî LARRY WEBSTER
 ‚ÄúTHE KEY TO BUILDING  
A RELIABLE ENGINE IS 
PATIENCE. THE DETAILS 
MATTER AND EVERYTHING

ESPECIALLY TO PRODUCE 
A LOT OF HORSEPOWER.‚Äù
ENGINE REBUILDING 
IN FIVE STEPS
1. !
During disassembly, 
Mikkelson relies on hand 
tools so he can feel a 
Ô¨Üripped thread or loose 
bolt. ‚ÄúA lot of times an 
engine blows a head gas-
ket because a head bolt 
was loose,‚Äù he says. A 
careful teardown reveals 
the engine‚Äôs failure mode 
and wear charaeriÔ¨Üics. 
He sorts parts according 
to their position on the 
block. Another tip: ‚ÄúStart 
from the top.‚Äù
2. 

q
Elbow grease and an 
automated Ô¨Üeam 
cleaner remove built-up 
crud. To reveal tiny 
cracks in a part,  
Mikkelson magnetizes 
it, applies a magnetic 
Ô¨Çuorescent powder to its 
surface and illuminates 
it with a black light. e 
powder colles inside 
cracks that are invisible 
to the naked eye. 
3. 
 
Aer carefully measuring 
every part, Mikkelson  
works pieces that are 
out of spec or worn 
with grooves‚Äîlike a 
scored cranksha‚Äîback 
to proper dimensions. 
Warped heads like the 
one piured are ground 
back to Ô¨Çatness. Mik-
kelson oen Ô¨Ånishes 
surfaces by hand.

Aer machining, 
Mikkelson again pulls out 
micrometers, a Ô¨Üraight-
edge and bore and feeler 
gauges to inspe and 
measure every part. 
‚ÄúSeventy-Ô¨Åve percent 
of my time is spent 
measuring,‚Äù he says.
5. ! 
As with disassembly, 
Mikkelson uses only hand 
tools to reassemble the 
engine. He vacuum teÔ¨Üs 
the heads to check the 
valves and uses assem-
bly dressing so parts are 
lubed at Ô¨Üartup. en he 
Ô¨Åres every engine on an 
engine Ô¨Üand. ‚ÄúHearing 
an engine Ô¨Åre for the Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü 
time never gets old.‚Äù
