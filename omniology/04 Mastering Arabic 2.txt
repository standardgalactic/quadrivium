Introduction 
Mastering Arabic 2 is an intermediate course designed to work for a wide 
range of learners, including those studying for general interest or those 
following examination courses. 
Mastering Arabic 2 follows on from Mastering Arabic 1 and its companion 
books Mastering Arabic Grammar and Mastering Arabic Script (published in 
the US as Easy Arabic Grammar and Easy Arabic Script). However, it is also 
suitable for anyone with some prior knowledge of Arabic. 
The course presents Modern Standard Arabic in an accessible and 
engaging way. A topic-based approach ensures that you will be given the 
opportunity to develop your skills and language within the framework of 
up-to-date themes relevant to the modern Arab world. 
As in the first level course, when we present dialogues or situations in 
Mastering Arabic 2 where the colloquial language would naturally be used, 
we have tried to use vocabulary, structures and pronunciation that are as 
close to the spoken form as possible. 
In addition, we have included end-of-unit regional features that 
include samples of regional dialects. The purpose of including these is as 
much to emphasise the similarities between the different types of Arabic 
as it is to show their differences. An understanding of a particular dialect 
is often a case of accustoming your ear to pronunciation and some 
vocabulary variations. The dialects all have their positions within the 
spectrum of the Arabic language and we hope the samples will 
encourage you to view them this way. 
How to use Mastering Arabic 2 
This course has over two hours of accompanying audio and access to 
these recordings is essential, unless you are studying in a group where 
the tutor has the audio. Those parts of the book which are on the 
recording are marked with this symbol: ® 
We are assuming when you start this book that you have a basic 
knowledge of the Arabic language and script, but that you may be working 
by yourself. Mastering Arabic 2 is suitable for classroom or home use.

Talking about yourself 2:,.c 3I 
Listen to these simple expressions you can use to talk about yourself: 
(ana ismT) .. . ʟʠ wi 
My name is ... 
'
.
 
t 
(uqTm fT/askun fT*) ...  ʡI /  ʤI

My address is . . . 
(ana) ... wi 
I am ... + nationality/job 
(ana (a-lan) min) ... ().4 (ʪI) wi 
I am (originally) from ... 
*Tip: ̪i (askun) is usually used in a more specific sense. 
̩i (uqim) can be used more generally. 
Remember that there is no equivalent of the English words 'am', 'is' or 
'are' in this kind of simple, non-verbal sentence, nor are there separate 
words for 'a' or 'an' (indefinite articles). In addition, if you are female you 
need to add the feminine ending b (ta' marbota) to most adjectives and 
nouns such as nationalities, jobs, etc., when you are talking about yourself .

Greetings ÕÖI 
. ;' ul yo 
.4Jl.b.:!!  ɏ t 
Arabic greetings are many and varied and could fill up an entire book in 
their own right. 
There are universal greetings such as ɉi (ahlan), hello; Ó,)-" 
(maryaban), welcome; Ô  j.l.J1 (as-salamu ta1aykum), peace be on 
you; and ɇI .. L" .. <IcÙ (zaba{/masa' al-khayr), good 
morning/evening. The universal greetings also have a large number of 
regional alternatives. 
In addition, there are more elaborate greetings used in formal 
situations, such as at the beginning of news broadcasts. For example 
Ⱦ Ï ×Ø .JJI Ɋj (ast ad allah |aba}akum bi-kulli khayr), which 
literally means 'May God make your morning happy with every goodness'. 
Special occasions often have their own greetings. For example, on 
someone's birthday or for the New 
Year you might say ȿ u.:,i,J  lL Ʉ 
(kull t am w-anta/anti bi-khayr), 'every 
year and you are well'; on a religious 
feast day, ..:.1,,)4-0 ɀ (tTd mubarak), 
'blessed Eid'; or at a wedding, ..:.1,J."H-O 
(mabrOk), congratulations. 
Other events are also worthy of 
their own greetings. For example you 
can send someone off on a journey 
with bǨ u",,,) (riyla satTda), 
'happy journey', and greet them on 
arrival with Ƀj.l.J1 Ɇ .uJ ɂI 
(al-}amdu lillah tala s-salama) 'thank 
God for the safe [arrival]'.

Conversation 
You're going to meet someone for the first time and talk about 
yourself. Prepare what you might say, using the information in the 
form above and thinking about the corresponding questions. Note 
that you will also need the phrases w':;":; (tasharrafna), 'pleased to 
meet you', and 'Í(ta?Tm), 'great!'. 
Then take part in the conversation on the recording, following our 
prompts. You can try this several times until you feel confident. 
Tip: In some phrases an active participle (fatil) can be used instead of a 
verb, although this is generally less formal: 
Active participle 
(ana sakin) L.. l.1 
(ana kharij) (.)l:.. l.i 
Verb 
(askun) ɂi 
(akhruj) (Ê1 
Meaning 
I am living/! live 
I am going out 
Active participles behave like adjectives and you need to add the usual 
feminine and plural endings: 
.:U.:. Ç UL.. l.1 (ana sakina ff shaqqa) I (fern.) live in an apartment. 
.ɂ.)l:.. Ƚ (hum kharijOn) They are going out. 

Myself and others 
My family ʐʑ 
Arabic is very precise in how it expresses family relationships. A vague 
concept such as 'my cousin' is replaced by an exact relationship, for 
example 'daughter of my paternal aunt' (i.e. my father's sister's 
daughter) or 'son of my maternal uncle', and so on; 'my brother-in-law' 
is replaced by 'husband of my sister' or 'brother of my wife'. 
Listen first to the core vocabulary for family members: 
.JIJ / ʗI (ab/walid) father 
.J1J/ʘ1 (umm/walida) mother 
[I (akh) brother 
ʃi (ukht) sister 
LHI (ibn) son 
ʂI (ibna) daughter 
ʎ (jadd) grandfather 
ʛ (jadda) grandmother 
Other family relations 
H (GafTd) grandson 
H (!afTda) granddaughter 
JG (khal) maternal uncle 
.uG (khala) maternal aunt 
u (tamm) paternal uncle 
̥ (tamma) paternal aunt 
ʏ (bam) father-in-law 
ʙ (ʁama) mother-in-law 
9 
To create family relationships outside the core terms, you need to use a n  
"#! i(;Wa construction to combine two or more nouns. Remember: 
• Words in an i9afa are put directly together. 
• b (ta' marbOta) needs to be pronounced when followed by another 
noun in an i9afa or by a possessive ending such as ':? (-T, my). 
• Only the final word in an i9afa can have JI (al-, the) or a possessive ending. 
ʔi ʚJj 
(zawj ukhtT) 
vwI 
(ibnat tammT) 
(.)'o'ʕʖ1 ʄi LHI 
(ibn ukht al-mudarris) 
the husband of my sister 
(my brother-in-law) 
the daughter of my paternal 
uncle (my cousin) 
the son of the sister of the 
teacher (the teacher's nephew) 
Tip: '" (-0) is added to..,.i (ab), father, ti (akh), brother and ̦ \Gam), 
father-in-law when they are the first nouns in an i9afa : .JF yl Khalid's 
father, ʅ..lL:.,y..i Nadia's brother, JF.J-"-"'- my uncle's father-in-law.

REVIEW: Pronouns 
7 7 
Pronouns011 
You have met the two types of Arabic pronoun: subject pronouns 
(equivalent of 'I', 'he', 'we', etc.) and attached pronouns (equivalent of 
'my/me', 'his/him', 'our/us', etc.). The attached pronouns are joined to 
the end of the word - as their name suggests. With one small exception 
for 'my' and 'me', the same attached pronoun is used for both possession 
and the object of a verb. 
Subject pronoun 
you (m.) 
you (f.) 
he/it (m.) 
she/it (f.) 
we

Improving your written Arabic 
Now you have mastered the basics of Arabic, you can find ways to improve 
your style. One of the most important ways of achieving this improvement is 
through the use of 'connectors' such as ɀ (fa-, and so) and ɮ (thumma, 
then). Short, unconnected sentences are not considered good style in written 
Arabic. Mastering Arabic 2 will introduce you to a variety of connectors and 
stylistiC devices you con use to improve understanding and written style. 
inna/wa-Iakinna ɳ.J / ::,! 
The Arabic particle ɴ! does not have any specific meaning, although 
historically it has been translated as 'verily'. It is used to introduce a 
sentence and is usually followed by a noun or an attached pronoun. 
Starting a written sentence with -JA or ::.:.1 can be considered ungainly in 
Arabic, whereas ɵ! (innahu) or d.! (innaka) are more graceful. ɱ,J 
(wa-Iakinna) works in a similar way, carrying the meaning of 'but' . 
. ɲ 4..lSJJ F 'lɴ 0! 
My grandfather is wise 
(inna jaddT bakTm wa-Iakinnahu t anTd) 
but he's stubborn . 
. .tJɳ ɯJ 492.\) s 0! 
My cat is graceful but 
(inna qiġĢatT rashTqa wa-Iakinnaha kasOla) 
she's lazy. 
Tip: ,)5J,J / J! (innT/wa-lakinnT) and ɲ,J /ɺ! (innanT/wa-lakinnanT) are 
alternatives when joining the attached pronoun for 'I'.

Talking about childhood A!¥WI ɫ ɫI

'''r'LL ̝WI ɰ! u,.1i:U!

Notice that in Arabic you add ɨ ('in') in front of the dote but, not the year. 
In Arabic the years are expressed as whole numbers using ...ill (alf), a 
thousand, or ɰi (alfayn), two thousand. This is in contrast to English 
where years are generally expressed as pairs of numbers ('nineteen eighty­
five', 'twenty twelve', etc.).

Arabic in Egypt ̐  ɘəI 
g 
'Egyptian' dialect usually refers to the spoken language of Cairo and 
g 
the north of Egypt. Dialects in other regions will vary more or less. 
ii!1 
Egypt has traditionally exported films, popular television programmes 
@J 
and songs to the rest of the Arab world. The advent of pan-Arab satellite 
ii!1 
channels has exposed people to a greater variety of accents, but the 
@J 
Egyptian dialect can still claim to be the most widely understood. 
ii!1 
Egyptian dialect shares some features with other dialects, e.g.: 
@J 
• replacement of J with a glottal stop ('), e.g. u.9.J (time) as wa't 
g 
• pronunciation of -:. as 't', e.g. ˝ (many/a lot) as kitTr 
ii!1 
Features particular to Egyptian dialect include: 
@J 
• pronunciation of C as a hard 'g', e.g. ɖI (Friday) as ig-gumt.a 
g 
• use of specifically Egyptian expressions, e.g. ɗ..,J..l dilwa'tT (now), 
 
',?..,.i 'awl (a lot, literally 'strong'), ɕy. t. arabTyya (car) 
@J 
• extensive use of foreign loan words, e.g . J.:!ɜ-JA mobayil (mobile)

(adapted from www.shorouk.com) 
In 1988, at the age of 76, the Egyptian 
writer Naguib Mahfouz won the Nobel 
prize for literature. He was the first 
Arab author to win this prestigious 
award. 
His most famous work is the 'Cairo 
Trilogy', following the story of a family 
in Egypt from World War I to the 1950s. 
As well as writing extensive short 
stories, novels and film scripts, Naguib 
Mahfouz worked in a variety of 
government positions, retiring from 
the Ministry of Culture in 1972. 
Naguib Mahfouz died in 2006 at the 
age of 94.

Additional note: Vocabulary 
Vocabulary lists appear at the end of each unit, and there is also an 
English-Arabic glossary at the end of the book on page 28l. 
English eqUivalents are given according to usage in this course. 
Other meanings may also be possible for individual words. 
As a general rule only vocabulary new to Mastering Arabic 2 will 
be listed. Refer to Mastering Arabic 7 for vocabulary already covered 
in the first level. The main exception will be if a word is part of a 
wider vocabulary set, where there may be some repetition for the 
sake of completeness. 
Nouns are listed with their (most common) plurals in brackets 
and verbs are shown in both the past and present tenses. 
You should make learning vocabulary part of your routine. You can 
just try to learn from a list but consider also these different ideas: 
• Write out new vocabulary on bi-lingual cards and use the cards 
to test yourself (see Mastering Arabic 7). 
• Make yourself a presentation o n  your computer (see Mastering 
Arabic 7 for tips on keying Arabic). You can illustrate the words 
with clipart to help you remember them . 
• Use one of the language learning sites on the internet that 
enable you to key in your own words to create virtual 
flashcards and vocabulary learning activities. 
• Challenge yourself to make sentences using as many new 
words as possible from a list.

House and home 
23 
Tip: There are many different words to describe dwellings in Arabic. 
Common words for 'house' or 'home' are Ȳ (bayt), and )J (dar) ­
familiar through place names such as Darussalaam (f"UI )J 'house of 
peace') and, less obviously, Bethlehem (Ȯ ȱ 'house of meat') .  
Casablanca i s  a Spanish translation of the Arabic name ǋ ǌ I  ) ..J I  
(ad-dar al-bay<;Ja'), 'the white house' - not to b e  confused with the US 
presidential building which is translated as ̂ ɉI ĥI (al-bayt al-abya<;J). 
Other terms for dwellings include JǍ (manzil, 'place of staying') and 
,j5....o (maskan, 'place of residing'). fu (shaqqa, pI. shuqaq) refers to an 
apartment or flat, and b.!Ħ (timara, pI. -at) to an apartment building. 
Listen to Sherif describing where he lives.

REVIEW: The plural 
j The plural lI 
<: 
There are three different methods of making words plural in Arabic and 
1"'1 
:E 
these methods in turn have variations. This summary will help you to 
consolidate your knowledge of how Arabic plurals are made. 
You need to try and remember a word together with its plural. 
Gradually you will find that you get a more instinctive grasp of the 
patterns and are able to 'feel' which plural might be right for a 
particular word. 
Sound (external) 
1 Sound masculine plural (SMP) o/ U.J- (-On/-Tn) 
• Used al most exclusively with words referring to groups of people of 
whom at least one is male. 
• Commonly used for nationalities, j obs, attributes derived from forms of 
the verb (beginning with -.:. m u -) . 
• U.}- (-On) is the 'default' ending in Standard Arabic. lr!:- (-Tn) is used in 
particular structures - see additional note on page 5 5 .  
(murasiIOn/-Tn) cr./ uJlwlj4 
.... correspondent (murasil) mIn 
(muslimOn/-Tn) cr./ us 
-c:- Muslim (muslim)  
(lubnanTyOn/-Tn) cr./ upq 
.... Lebanese (lubna nTy)  
2 Sound feminine plural (SFP) ul (-at) 
• Probably the most common Arabic plural. 
• Used for words referring to groups of people all of whom are female. 
(m umarric;Jat) uL.,.:,z -c:- nurse (fern.) (mumarric;Ja) Wk 
(muNrTyyat) u4Ĺ 
-c:- Egyptian (fern.) (muĬrTyya) i 
• Used for some other masculine and feminine non-human words, 
especially longer words derived from forms of the verb and imported 
words of foreign origin. 
(ĭamma mat) u14 
-c:- bathroom (Įam mam)  
(ijtimatat) uu.{1 .... meeting (ijtimat) t·1 
(tiITfizyOnat) uU .... television (titTfizyOn) u 
Broken (internal) 
• Plural made by identifying the root of a word and changing internal 
vowel sounds (similar to English 'goose/geese' or 'mouse/mice'). 
• About twelve common different patterns, plus a few other less common. 
• Patterns defined using root letters J.U (e.g .  µ¶i 'pens' = Jwi pattern). 

REVIEW: The plural 
o Broken plural is used with many words referring to non-humans : 
(pattern = Jwi) (afran) uti ..- cooker (furn) u) 
, 
(pattern = JU) (ghuraf) ..9..;L ..- room (ghurfa) J.i..;L 
, 
(pattern = J,.,...a) (buyot) uȲ ..- house (bayt) U-:!-! 
(pattern = JU) (kutub) y:iS ..- book (kitab) ",:,US 
(pattern = J) (diyar) J4..1 ..- house/home (dar) }..! 
, 
(pattern = Jd .. a",) (makatib) ȴȵ ..- office/desk (maktab) ȯ 
" 
. 
2 7  
o Broken plural can also be used with words referring to groups o f  males (in 
preference to the SMP): 
(pattern = J) (rijal) J4-ȶ ..- man (rajul) ȷJ 
, 
(pattern = .. ȳ) (wuzara') ȸt.;jJ 
..- minister (wazTr) ȹ..jJ 
(pattern = Jwi) (afad) ..Ilbi ..- grandchild (afTd) ȳ 
Collective 
o Collective nouns are masculine singular but have a plural meaning. 
o Add (; to make a feminine singular noun referring to one of the group. 
o Natural features that come in groups (plants, animals, etc.) are often 
collective nouns. 
g cow (baqara) .; ȴ ..- cows (baqar) ȵ 
Q tree (shajara) '; ..- trees (shajar)  
o Other items that come in groups can be collective (e.g. carpets): 
9 carpet (sajjada) ';..Iº 
- carpets (sajjad) ..I¹

Plurals are shown after the singular in the most popular English-Arabie 
dictionary (A Dictionary of Modern Arabic, Hans Wehr). Note that the 
entry above for  (clean) has alternative plurals. A few words 
have these alternatives; the most common is used in Mastering Arabic.

Tip: In some spoken dialects you may only hear the U:- (-Tn) ending for 
groups of people , even when the group consists entirely of females. 
So U=J- -:.41 1 (al-banat mashgOITn) could be used to mean 'the girls

Unit 2 
Adjectives and plurals F1J I 
There i s  not really a grammatical difference between nouns and 
adj ectives in Arabic. Adj ectives such as active ( nashTt) or 
popular/loved ( maObOb) can also be used to mean 'an active 
person' or 'a popular/loved one' . 
Adj ectives need to be made plural when referring to groups of people. 
Some adjectives use a sound plural, others use a broken plural. The plural 
of an adjective may follow a different plural pattern from the word it is 
describing. 
(awlad Piwal) JIJlo J«Ji 
tall boys 
(a l-kurama') p14'p1 
the generous (ones) 
(an-nas al-mashghOIOn) 0J-lq1 (.)'01 WI 
the busy people 
 
(innahum nashTtOn jiddan) .I.lo?- 0r ªt They are very active. 
For a n  all-female group, the adjective can be made plural by using the 
Sound Feminine Plural. 
(al-banat at-tawl1at) .:"n.,wl .:,oI 
the tall girls 
, 
(mumarri<;lat mashghOlat) .:" '1 m .:"LA j4 
busy nurses 
Plurals of non-human objects and ideas are grammatically a single female! 

House and home 
Non-human plurals 
Remember that plurals not referring to people are treated as feminine 
singular in Arabic. So an adj ective describing a group of objects, such as 
'chairs' or 'pictures' needs .;, as for a single feminine obj ect. 
(al-karaST al-ȲadTtha) ȭȮ1 ȯI,foJi 
the modern chairs 
(aN-Nuwar jamna) .Ȩ ȩI 
The pictures are 
beautiful.

Arabic in Saudi Arabia â..l!1 "j ȗj-1-l1 .u.ul 
The Arabian peninsula, which now forms part of modern Saudi 
Arabia, was where the Arabic language originated and where the 
prophet Mohammed was born in the 7th century AD . Arabic spread 
with the rapid Islamic conquests, but the spoken language of the 
Arabian peninsula can still claim to be closer to the Classical than 
that of other more distant regions that were open to diverse 
linguistic influences. 
Features of Saudi Arabic include: 
• pronunciation of J as a hard 'g', e . g .  Ȥȥ (coffee) as gahwa 
• pronunciation of ..!l as 'ch', e.g. Ǟ (fish) as simich 
• use of feminine plural in spoken language 
• less use of imported foreign words

Better known these days for its 
ultra-modern skyscrapers, Saudi 
Arabia also retains some fine 
examples of traditional 
buildings, particularly in the 
older towns such as Jeddah and 
Mecca. These tall town houses 
generally look inwards to a 
central courtyard and can 
consist of several floors.

Additional note: Case endings 
You will probably be aware that formal standard Arabic includes case 
endings added to nouns and adjectives. You may hear these endings 
in scripted news bulletins, formal speeches and similar situations. 
As a general rule, the case endings do not affect the spelling and 
you need only recognise them when you see or hear them. The most 
common exception to this is the additional alif known as alit tanwTn 
which is added to the indefinite accusative: 
nominative 
accusative 
genitive 
indefinite ('a boy') 
.. 
..JJ waladun

..JJ waladin 
• 
definite ('the boy') 
, 
..J&I al-walady 
..J'I al-waladg 
..J'I al-waladl 
Note that alif tanwTn is not added to a word ending with til 
.

Mastering Arabic 7 Structure Note sections give more details about 
how the individual cases are formed and when they are used.

Tip: There are a few Arabic words that end with -in, written with two 
kasras: ˵ (mughanin, singer), tр (mu amin, lawyer). When these 
words are made definite or have alif tanwTn added, the ending becomes T, 
written with ya': ľI (al-mughannT), ˶C (muʿamTyan). The ya' also 
appears in the feminine: Ǽ (mughannTya, female singer); but not in 
the masculine plural: UJ-.oC (mu amOn, lawyers).

talk about occupations:

He's a representative 
in a large company. 
They are guards at the 
embassy. 
You could also use the verb Ç (yat. mal), meaning 'to work', followed 
directly by the job. As a verb is used, the job needs the (accusative) 
tanwTn, or the sound plural -Tn ending (see pages 37 and 55):

what time you usually get up and go to sleep 
what you usually do after breakfast ().hi)!1 ɵ) 
2-3 things you usually or sometimes do in the day (at work, college, etc.) 
a household task you always do/you never or rarely do 
Note that it is common in spoken Arabic to express times by using the 
regular (cardinal) numbers: as-sat. a sitta ('the hour six'), rather than 
the more formal as-sat.a as-sadisa ('the sixth hour').

REVIEW: Present verbs 
̔ Present verbs t,JWalI 
<: 
Arabic verbs can generally be classified into 'basic' and 'derived' .  Basic 
verbs are those that carry the root meaning and have a stem using the 
three root letters vowelled only with short vowels. 
Derived forms have different, but predictable, patterns with long 
vowels, non-root consonants or doubled root letters interposed between 
the basic root. A detailed summary of the derived forms is in Units 4 and 6. 
Here is a table showing all the parts of the present verb, using the 
basic verb c:̦̓.! yafta (open) . The present stem is ̍ fta and the 
prefixes and endings are arranged around this stem. The less commonly 
used feminine plurals and duals are in lig hter type.

* The full pronunciation includes a final u, but this is not normally heard 
except in formal contexts. 
Notice that the prefix for 'you' verbs is ta- and the prefix for 'he' and 
'they' is ya-. The additional endings show the gender and number: 
-una for masculine plural, -na for feminine plural and -an for dual . 

REVIEW: Present verbs

Th e  prefix for some o f  the derived forms o f  the verb i s  vowelled with a 
damma rather than a fatha (e.g. 1!rsil, I send, Y1!rsil, he sends, etc. ), but 
otherwise the prefixes and endings are standard for Q.l.l. verbs.

You can make a present verb negative by putting ':I in front .

(la yatbukh ibnT abadan) 
("doesn't cook ever" ) 
Irregular verbs: general notes 
Some verbs behave somewhat differently due to features of the root. 
H ere is a reminder of the three ways in which a root can be irregular: 
l one of the root letters is a hamza ( ,,) 
2 the root is "doubled" , i . e .  the second and third root letters are the same 
3 one of the root letters is "weak" , i.e. J or '? 
The main consideration with hamzated verbs is how to write the hamza 
(':'1 ts Ij Iii i). Other than this, they mainly behave as regular verbs . 
. ȢliJl ̆t.....J1 0'L..iaJ1 J,S;l.:a We eat dinner at 
(na'kul al-tasha' as-sata ath-thamina) eight o'clock . 
. JLi.b̂ 4A ';̅I olA ØJi This woman writes books 
(tu'allif hadhihi s-sayyida kutuban lil-atfal) for children. 
Doubled verbs generally follow a simple rule: if the stem is followed 
directly by a consonant (non-vowel), the second and third root letters are 
written and pronounced separately. If not, they become a doubled letter 
written together with a shadda. Looking at the table opposite, you can 
see that the only ending in the present tense beginning with a consonant 
is -na, associated with the two relatively uncommon feminine plurals. 
Excluding these, present tense doubled verbs in most forms are 
characterised by a doubled letter written together with a shadda.

REVIEW: Present verbs 
That leaves the third, and trickiest, category: weak verbs. The 'weak' 
letters J or r.s can appear as any of the three roots and are very fickle in 
how they behave. Depending on the pattern and the position of the weak 
root, the J or r.s can be pronounced 'w' or 'y' ,  become a long or short 
vowel, or disappear altogether ! Gradually you will become more familiar 
with the various possibilities. For the moment we can generalise that weak 
"assimilated" verbs (with the weak letter, almost always J' as the first root) 
lose the J altogether in the present tense. 'Hollow verbs (with J or r.s as 
the middle root) and weak 'defective' verbs (with J or r.s as the finai root) 
are characterised by a long vowel in the middle or at the end respectively .

Syria forms part of the 'Levant', an area to the East of the 
Mediterranean that today also includes Lebanon, Jordan and 
Palestine. The dialects of the Levant share characteristics and are 
mutually comprehensible, although there are local differences. 
Features of Levantine Arabic include: 
• softer, non -gutteral sounds and lyrical intonation 
• p ronunCiation of b as 'eh' or 'ee', e.g. ň..l..:> (town) as medineh/-ee 
• pronunciation of j as

Additional note: Sound Masculine Plural (SMP) 
Unlike the most common case endings, those for the Sound 
Masculine Plural behave in a way that affects the spelling and basic 
pronounciation of the word: 
• The nominative case ending w (-On) changes to 0:! (-In) in the 
accusative and genitive cases: 
·uР r--' 
They are designers.

REVIEW: verbal nouns and participles 
::tl Verbal nouns & participles ͷ JͺtJ ͻl.4ttJ Jͼt 
I'TI 
-< 
The key to progressing in Arabic is a knowledge of how to use different 
I'TI 
root patterns to form related words and recognise unfamiliar vocabulary. 
Б 
You can think of every verb as a door to a complete set of inter-related 
words. With the exception of the verbal nouns for basic verbs, most of 
these patterns are entirely predictable. For example, if you know the 
word for teacher is U"ʝ..Lo (mudarris), you will be able to predict with 
confidence that the verb 'to teach' would be U"ʜ..I.;! (yudarris) and that the 
noun meaning 'teaching' would be (J"-'...) ..G (tadrTs). 
Probably the three most useful patterns are the verbal noun (known in 
Arabic as .J̾I al-maˏdar), the active participle (Jd.iJ 1 al-fatil), and the 
passive participle ("-! ͹I al-maftOI bihi). 
verbal noun = a ction ca rried out by verb, e.g. 
ʙ (Iatib) playing 
W@ (mulakama) boxing 
ГJ.u (tadrTb) training 
active participle = (the one) carrying out the action, e.g. 
В '1 (Iatib) player 
ʛ@ (mulakim) boxer 
'-:IJ.l.4 (mudarrib) trainer; coach 
passive participle = (the one that is) the object of the action, e.g. 
J͸ (mashghul) (the one) occupied, busy 
ʚ (mufa<;l<;lal) (the one) preferred, favourite 
'-:IJ.l.4 (mudarrab) (the one) trained, coached 
Nouns and participles from basic verbs 
Verbal nouns from basic (form I) verbs cannot be predicted, although 
there are common patterns. You will need to check in a dictionary for the 
pattern associated with a particular verb . H owever, the participles are 
predictable: the active is formed by putting the root into the pattern jLu 
(fatil) and the passive by putting the root into the pattern Jͽ (maftOI). 
Nouns and participles from derived forms 
Nouns and participles formed from derived verbs are almost completely 
predictable. The main exception is the form III verbal noun which has 
alternative patterns (see table on page 63). 

REVIEW: verbal nouns and participles 
The active and passive participles are simple to form from derived 
forms: take the present verb of the derived from and replace the prefix 
with ':'" (mu-). For the active participle, make the final vowel kasra (i); 
and for the passive change this final vowel to fata (a). 
Here is a summary of the patterns for forms I-IV. The other derived 
forms will be covered in later units.

When you've completed the table, check your answers and then say them 
out loud so that you begin to hear the patterns. 
Tip: Not every verb will have an active and passive participle in common 
use, although it is theoretically possible to form both. For example, the 
form IV verb ʤ (yuslim, to submit [to God] ) gives us the verbal noun 
i"Ȑl (islam, submission) and the active paTticiple ʧ (muslim, one who 
submits) . However, the passive participle ʦ muslam, theoretically 
meaning 'submitted', is not commonly used.

You can follow a verb such as  (yuibb, like) or  (yufaQQiI, prefer) 
with either a verbal noun or ʞith wi (an, 'that') plus another verb. 
Arabic makes extensive use of verbal nouns where in English we might 
use on infinitive ('to go', 'to play', etc.). Verbal nouns are considered 
good style and are often used in preference to a second verb. 
Notice that if the first verb is followed by a second verb, then the 
second verb must also match the subject: 
.;;;IȤI Ȉi I like reading.

Arabic in Morocco '-;I£I ,.; ǫǬI 
Morocco lies at the western extreme of the Arabic-speaking world. 
It is from here that the Muslim 'Moors' crossed the Mediterranean 
and occupied southern Spain for most of the Middle Ages. The spoken 
language has been greatly influenced by the local Berber language, 
Andalusian dialect and European languages, especially French which 
is a second language for almost the entire population. Moroccan 
Arabic can be difficult to understand, even for other native Arabic 
speakers. Features of Moroccan Arabic include: 
• disappearance of short vowels resulting in many consonants 
pronounced together (also a feature of Berber) 
• 'k' sound in front of some present verbs (k-yikOn = is) 
• extensive use of Berber, French and Spanish vocabulary (listen for 
the French word 'te' (tea) in the extract)

A modified version of the present tense, known as the subjunctive, is 
used after wi (an, 'that') and other similar particles. The most 
significant modification is that the final nOn disappears from the 
feminine 'you', the masculine plural and the dual:

Tip: Many spoken Arabic dialects use this modified subjunctive form 
of the present tense in all contexts, for example ͜y:.J tashrabTna 
(you fern. drink) becoming tashrabT, and UY.͝ yashrabOna (they 
drink) becoming yashrabO. 
Another feature of some dialects is that the masculine plural 
verb is employed for all plural or dual subjects regardless of gender. 
This means that the feminine plural and dual verbs are a consistent 
feature only of Standard Arabic.

Travel in the Arab World üýI þWI ÿĀI 
There are many reasons to travel to the Middle East. With the Red Sea, the 
Meditteranean, and the Gulf all on offer, beach resorts have sprung up in 
the region at a phonomenal rate in the past few decades. In addition, the 
Middle East has a huge wealth of sites of historical interest, from the 
ancient Egyptian monuments, to the Islamic sites and Crusader castles. 
The Hajj 2t 
The most significant journey in terms 
of sheer numbers of people is the 
annual pilgrimage (ǻI al- ajj) to 
"Revered Mecca" (̽JS-.J I  Ϻ makka 
al-mukarrama) in Saudi Arabia. 
One of the five pillars of Islam is the 
duty of every Muslim who is able to 
"perform the obligation of the Hajj" 
(ɡI ̷̸ (S̻̼ yu'addr farT<;lat al-Yajj) 
at least once In his or her lifetime. 
Millions of pilgrims converge on 
Mecca for a few days where they perform 
a series of rituals. These include circling seven times the ancient black 
stone known as the Ka'ba (ϽI ai-kat ba) inside the al-Haram Mosque 
(`Iy:J1 ;I al-masjid al-Yaram), running between two hills, drinking the 
waters of the Zarnzam well (`j.o.j Ϳ bi'r zamzam), visiting Mount Arafat 
(ẁ́ ͂ jabal t arafat), and throwing stones at a symbolic devil.

REVIEW: past verbs 
ɓ Past verbs ɗU, J.U.J' 
<: 
Arabic has only two basic tenses: the present (or imperfect) and the past, 
ù 
although there are variations on and combinations of these tenses. 
The past tense is used for completed events. Endings are added to a 
past stem to show the subj ect. There are no prefixes as there are for the 
present tense . Here is a table showing all the parts of the past verb. The 
less commonly used feminine plurals and duals are in lighter type. 
example

Most basic verbs have past stems vowelled with two fat as (e:i" fataʶ, 
opened; .;.s katab, wrote), but a few are vowelled fatYa/kasra (̲):. 
sharib, drank), or less commonly fatõal9amma c;.;. kabur, to be big). 
Derived verbs have their own distinctive past stems but, as for the 
present tense, the subject endings are standard for all verbs:

REVIEW: past verbs 
83 
Irregular verbs: general notes 
Each type of irregular verb will be looked at in more detail in later units, 
but here are some general gUidelines on what to look out for. 
Hamzated verbs 
As with the present, the main consideration in the past tense is how to write 
the hamza. Other than this, hamzated verbs behave mainly regularly. 
Doubled verbs 
Doubled verbs in the past follow the same general rule as present verbs 
(see page 48). Subject endings starting with a consonant (non-vowel) 
result in the second and third root letters being written and pronounced 
separately. Subject endings beginning with a vowel generally result in 
the doubled letter being written together with a shadda: 
(atdadtu qaqa'ibT) .ʒl..i=a. u.lǻi 
I prepared my bags. 
(raIlO al-mashakil) .JSw..J1 I..,.h. 
They solved the problems. 
Weak verbs 
Assimilated verbs (weak letter as first root) are almost entirely regular in 
the past . Defective verbs (wea k letter as last root) are generally 
characterised by a long a, ay, 0 or aw replacing the final root letter. 
(ishtarayna at-tadhakir) .sI.:u.J1 l.:i.:!t1 
We bought the tickets. 
(masha bi-surta) . .u.ʏ ʐ 
He walked quickly. 
Hollow verbs have two stems - one 'open' stem with a long a in the middle 
for subject endings starting with a vowel; and one 'closed' stem with a 
short vowel for subject endings starting with a consonant. 
Negative 
(zurna al-qalta) 
. .LUi.J1 wJ,j 
We visited the fort. 
(zarO I-matuaf) .ɋI Ij)j 
They visited the museum. 
The most common way of making a past verb negative in Standard 
Arabic is using ʎ (lam) + present verb: 
(lam yat mal al-furn) .0v1 T ʍ 
The cooker didn't work. 
(lam najid thaljan) .ʑ ʌ ʋ 
We didn't find ice. 
The present verb used after lam is a modified form known as the juss;ve 
(see Additional Note page 91).

Unit 5 
Describing the past ɈUI ʘJ 
Simple descriptions in the present do not need an equivalent of the verb 
'am', 'are' or 'is' in Arabic. However, in the past you do need to use uLS: 
(kan) in the appropriate form to mean 'was' or 'were'. u LS:  (kan) is a 
hollow verb with the stem changing to ...:.5: (kun) when you add an ending 
beginning with a consonant, e.g. a (kuntu, I was) - see page 83 . 
An adjective following uː (kan) will have the accusative ending -an . In 
most cases this is written on alif tanwin ( r ) if the adjective doesn't end with 
ta' marbOˑa. Compare these descriptions in the present and in the past: 
(in the past) ɉWI Ɋ 
.iɏ ɐl ul,.S; 
The fil m  was exciting . 
. WG. YI,.S; 
She was afraid. 
.I̧ ̨ 
I was happy.

The forts were wonderful.

, 
II( 
.̬ tWt 
The forts are wonderful. 
Tip: In Modern Standard Arabic the usual word order is verb + subject + 
rest of sentence (i̦ ɇt u ̼  The film was e;<citing). However, in less 
formal contexts you may see the subject first (t̥ ul.5; ɍI), reflecting 
the usual order in spoken dialects. Remember: the verb will be singular if 
it comes before a plural subj ect: LIX ̪ J4-.)1 but LIX J4-.)1 ,',l.5; 
(The men were generous) .

You stayed last month in the same hotel with your family (in room 512 
on the fifth floor). You were also unhappy because: 
• the room was cold and overlooked the bus station 
• the weather was cold and the heater (;;\,j.l.o m idfa'a) never worked 
• the coffee in the cafeteria was cold and the pizza was small 
• you didn't find any soap in the bathroom 
Write a letter of complaint to the hotel manager, using Sohair's letter as

Mediterranean Sea 
Tunisia is the smallest of the North African countries, lying between 
Algeria and Libya. As in its two neighbours to the west, Morocco and 
Algeria, in Tunisia there is a very strong French influence on both 
the culture and the language. As well as using French and Italian 
words such as 'piscine' (swimming pool) and 'cucina' (kitchen) 
within spoken Tunisian Arabic, Tunisians might also switch entirely 
between speaking French and Arabic, sometimes in mid-sentence. 
Some of the features of Tunisian dialect are: 
• Use of the verb tν ('to serve') with the meaning of 'to work' 
• Use verbal prefix"':' n- to refer to 'I': tξ nikhdim (J work) 
• Use of specifically Tunisian expressions such as ʵ..>-! barsha and 
and j"'· yaaser, both meaning 'very' or 'a lot' 
• Dropping the 'd' sound in ʳ, e.g. tanina ('we have') 
Listen to Abdelhaq talking about himself in his Tunisian 
dialect. You will find a transcript and translation in the key.

Additional note: Jussive with the past negative 
A modified version of the present tense, known as the jussive, is used 
for the past negative after ॕ (lam). The jussive is very similar to the 
subjunctive in that the final nOn disappears from the feminine 
'you', the masculine plural and the dual (see page 73). For regular 
verbs, this is the only significant difference. 
However, if fully pronounced the other parts of the jussive end 
with a sukOn: ଚ (yaktub) rather than ଛ (yaktubu). This has 
the effect of shortening the long vowels in weak verbs. For example, 
..)Jঁ (yazOr, he visits) becomes..)॓ (yazur) in the jussivej ଝi 
(amshT, I walk) becomes J..oi (amshi). 
Look at these examples of negative sentences in the past: 
(lam yadh-habO) .IJo+Aढ़ फ़ 
They didn't go. 
ତy:aLbJI I./ॖ di 
Didn't you (f.) prepare 
(a-lam tutiddT al-«aqa'ib)

(lam nazur tunis) .ଡ,,:a ଢ d

Unit 6 
You say tamatim, I say tamata 
There are some variations in the vocabulary English-speakers use for 
everyday items such as foods. For example, the vegetable the British call 
'aubergine' the Americans call 'eggplant'; 'chips' to the British means hot 
potato fries, but to the Americans it means salted potato crisps in a 
packet. These types of regional variations also exist in a more pronounced 
way in the Arabic-speaking world since the number of countries and 
influences involved are greater. Some vocabulary sets are more affected 
than others. Food and clothes are two topics that show sig nificant 
regional differences. 
The variations can be small:r-bë (ķamatim, tomatoes) can also be 
lbë (ĸamata); Ĺĺ (batatis, potatoes) can be lbĻ (baļata), which 
in turn can sometimes be used to refer to sweet potatoes. 
However, alternatives do not always sound similar: a third word for 
'tomatoes' is bJ.Jڴ (banadura); yoghurt can be (5..14':' (zabadi) or Ľ 
(laban), the latter also sometimes used to refer to milk. 
[n addition, the same word can have different meanings in different 
places: ľĿ (karafs) can refer to celery in one area or parsley in another; 
t৑ (khawkh) can be peaches in some places or plums in others. 
In general, the various nationalities of the Arab world will use the 
term most fa miliar to those they are addressing. Some foreign words 
adopted into Arabic don't have a 'standard' version and you may find 
variations even in more formal contexts such as newspaper articles. You 
should be aware that alternatives are possible and try to familiarise 
yourself with the most common.

<: 
We have seen how Arabic verbs have varied 'forms' which carry related 
M 
meanings. We have also looked in detail at verbal nouns and participles 
:E 
for forms II, III and IV (see pages 62-3). The other five significant derived 
forms fall into two groups that share characteristics: forms V and VI; and 
forms VII, VIII and X (form IX being very rare). 
Forms V and VI are characterised by being vowelled entirely with fatha 
in both present and past tenses:

Ramadan. Muslimsyerform the fast (ٟ٠I aÜ-Ýawm) from the da.wn call 
to prayer (p...QJ1 ul.:d adhan al-fajr) until the sunset call (,-:",ҞI ul.jl adhan 
al-maghrib). At sunset, the main 'breakfast' meal () . .w! if tar) is served.

Arabic in Lebanon uّ .j ْ.jLl1 
Lebanon, part of the Levantine "fertile cresent", lies along the shores 
of the Eastern Mediterranean. Its position and varied history have left 
Lebanon with multiple religious and cultural communities. For much 
of its recent history it has been under the influence of France, and 
French is still the strongest outside influence on the local dialect. As in 
parts of North Africa, many Lebanese are equally comfortable 
speaking French or Arabic. 
Lebanese Arabic dialect is part of the Levant group and shares 
many features with Syrian Arabic (see page 52), but with a greater 
French influence.

Lebanese food is famous 
throughout the Middle East and 
beyond. Lebanese cooking has 
influenced the rest of the 
Mediterranean, and in turn has 
absorbed features from other 
countries such as Turkey and 
Greece. Minced meat is a key 
ingredient, as are cracked wheat 
(burghul), mint and parsley. Above 
is a recipe for the classic grilled 
'Kofta' kebabs with yoghurt salad.

Traditional and Western clothing 
The terms used for items of clothing show significant regional variations 
even within 'Standard' Arabic. Roughly speaking, there are three 
categories of words: 
• words such as ς qamTσ (shirt) or r-'.? ͊izam (belt) that can be used to 
describe both traditional and Western items of clothing; 

7 20 
• words used for traditional 
Arabic items of clothing, such 
as ,-:-,y thawb, ^ŀ tabaya 
and ॽॾ jaliabTyya (all 
meaning either robe or cloak); 
Łł kOfTya and t l..,.;. 
shimagh (different kinds of 
men's headscarf). Exact use of 
these words will vary from 
region to region; 
• words adopted from European 
Unit 8 
languages and used to 
Traditional clothing for sale in Tunisia 
describe Western items of 
clothing, such as uŃ bantalOn (western-style trousers) and ń 
jTba (skirt) from the French pantalon and jupe, or wڗ-ڕ tT-shTrt 
(T-shirt) and w,,)y:.. shOrt (shorts) from the English. The terms used vary 
across the Arab world depending on the history of a particular region. 
Exercise 2 
y ǰ( 
Here are some more familiar words for clothing. Can you work them out? 
Describing the outfit ߰jlt ߱J 
The most common way of describing what someone is wearing is to use 
the verb Ņ ,ņ (Iabisa, yalbas) - from the same root as (..)"-!ږ 
(malabis). Ģ ,ॼ is used with the meaning of to wear or to put on . 
. ߮߯ ॿঀ oi,rJt ġ 
(talbas al-mar'a jallabTyya taqtrdTyya) 
ּ o}li ॸ JA 
(hal yalbas naŇňara) 
, 
, 
.ࣤJ 14ࣥI ࣦ 
(labistu I-bijama wa-nimtu) 
The woman is wearing a 
traditional galabeyya. 
Is he wearing glasses?/ 
Does he wear glasses? 
I put on [the] pyjamas 
and went to sleep.

In Modern Standard Arabic, you should add alif tanwTn ( I  -an) to the 
object of the verb (in this case the item of clothing) if it is indefinite (i.e. 
the meaning is 'a/an' or 'some'). The main exceptions are if the object 
word ends in ta' marbOta (;;) or if it is a foreign loan word that sounds 
awkward with the alif tanwTn ending. Spoken dialects don't generally use 
the alif tanwTn in this way but you should try to include it when you are 
writing, or speaking in a more formal context. 
.0࣯j L.....lj ࣭ ાi I'm wearing a loose shirt 
(albas qamThan waSitan wa-su9ayrTyya) and a waistcoat. 
.࣮.jb Lઽ ઺ ઻ She's wearing a long

Unit 8 
Describing colour wSI ..4-J 
There are six basic colours that are made by putting the root letters into 
the pattern aftal. These six colours are amongst a handful of Arabic 
adjectives that cannot be made feminine by adding ta' marbOta. They 
have a special feminine form using the pattern fat1a': 
colour

Other colours are often made by forming nisba adjectives from natural 
items, in the same way as happens with nationalities (see page 5): 
CJ14.) (ramadTy) light grey ('ashen') 
-0(- J14,) (ramad) ashes 
CJ..>J (wardTy) pink ('rosey') 
ֺ J.)j (ward) roses

Identifying (relative pronouns) 
English words such as 'who', 'which' or 'that' are used to identify people and 
things: 'the woman who is wearing the shawl', 'the red hats that are on the 
shelf', etc. These words are called relative pronouns. 
Here are the most important Arabic relative pronouns: 
'1य़1 (alladhT) masc. sing. 
ƚI (aliatT) 
fem. sing. (+ non­
human plural) 
0-:!.:J1 (alladhTna) masc. plural 
(people) 
ߕߖI (aliatT) fem. plural (people) 
Arabic relative pronouns change according to the gender and number of 
the person(s) or thing(s) being identified: 
.ߗi ĝ Jt...i:J1 ड़ ߒI ;;iॠ1 
The woman who is 
(al-mar'a aliatT talbas ash-shaal hiya 
wearing the shawl is my 
ukhtT) 
sister. 
ग़ ;; ߓI ,,} 0-:!,j,J1 iY"WI 
The people who are in the

If the person or thing being identified is not the subject of the rest of the 
sentence, as in 'the man whom we sow' ('we' is the subject, not the 
man), or 'the shirts that I bought' ('I' is the subject), then Arabic will 
phrase this as 'the man who we sow him', or 'the shirts that I bought 
them', using on attached pronoun: 
j)ذiJ ,?,ъI J.?,.,.JI 
the man whom we sow 
(ar-rajul alladhl ra'aynahu)

'some shirts', etc.):

REVIEW: Doubled verbs 
7 2 9  
Doubled verbs ॗL.:ail J.a.4!1 
Doubled verbs have the same consonant as the second and third root. 
Generally, doubled verbs follow the rule that the second and third 
root letters are written separately if the word pattern dictates that: 
• the third root letter is followed directly by a consonant, or 
• the second root letter is doubled, or 
• the second root is followed by a long vowel.

.,tॖ1 
Doubled verbs behave entirely regularly in Forms II and V, with the 
second and third roots written separately. For other verbal forms, whether 
or not the second and third roots are written together depends on the 
particular pattern and any ending added. For example, 'he liked' is ॔t 
a%abba but 'I liked' is ॕi a&babtu - the two roots separating as thॐy are 
directly followed by the ending ::" -tu which starts with a consonant . You 
can see that the patterns for the verbal nouns from the derived forms 
largely dictate that the doubled root letters are written separately. 
Other word patterns follow the same principles. For example, the 
passive participle from Ř yasudd is ..l.J .1=4 masdod (blocked), with a 
long vowel between the second and third roots. However, the active 
participle has a short vowel in this position and so the doubled root is 
written together "J L.. sadd (blocking).

REVIEW: Weak verbs 
:::tl 
Weak verbs ࢢI J.a.4t1 
rrI 
<: 
Assimilated verbs 
ő 
Assimilated verbs have one of the weak letters waw or ya' as the first root 
consonant. In practice this is almost always waw. Assimilated verbs 
generally behave as regular verbs, the main exceptions being: 
• the initial waw drops out in basic present verbs in almost all cases: 
ࢤ/ࢥj (waرala, yaìiI) to arrive 
ࢦ/ ࢧj (wadata, ya<;Jac) to put 
• the waw changes to a double ta' in Form VI l I :  
࢜ / ଵI (ittaìala, yataĬĬil) to contact 
ࢨ/ ࢩI (itta<;Jata, yatta<;J ic) to humble oneself 
Hollow verbs 
Hollow verbs have a weak letter as the second root consonant and fall 
into two main categories depending on whether the middle root is waw 
or ya'. The rules for how hollow verbs behave are somewhat complicated 
and you will need to consult a grammar reference for the details. 
However, here are some gUidelines. 
In the present tense, hollow verbs with middle root waw are generally 
characterised by a long u in place of the second root letter and those 
with middle root ya' by a long T. There are a few hollow verbs that are 
characterised by a long a in the present tense, for example yanam (sleep): 
- " . .  t_"·ौ11

My father says that 
I'm weak in English. 
Do they sell books

My cat sleeps all

In the past tense, hollow verbs display a long a when the suffix starts 
with a vowel, but a short u or i when the suffix starts with a consonant: 
.࢟ ࢠ ࢞ Œ! œi u.J1.j

We sold the house 
but they sold the land. 

REVIEW: Weak verbs 
1 4 3  
Defective verbs 
Defective verbs have either waw or ya' as the final root letter. As with 
hollow verbs, the rules associated with defective verbs are somewhat 
complicated but some general characteristics can be identified. 
In the present tense, the final waw or ya' is replaced by 0, i or a, and in 
the post tense by a or iya. However, when suffixes are added the sound 
can change to aw, ay or I, or drop out altogether.

Defective verbs are irregular in all the forms. Hollow verbs are irregular 
only in forms IV, VII, VlII and X. The irregularities follow a similar 
pattern to the basic verb form, with the weak root letter changing to a 
long or short vowel depending on the pattern associated with the 
particular form. Whether the weak root is waw or ya', the irregular 
derived patterns will be the some.

Weak verbs in the jussive 
In the short jussive form of the verb (see page 91), those ports of the 
present tense that do not have a suffix (ending) are written with sukon. 
I n  hollow and defective verbs this sukon shortens the long vowel:

Note that Form IV verbs start their imperative with a- rather than u- or i-: 
Present 
Imperative 
, 
Ħ.,:; (tursil) you send !Ħ) (arsil) send! 
The verb that is fed into the top of the chart on page 145 should be the 
short (jussive) form of the verb - the same form that is used for a past 
negative after ࢎ lam (see page 91 ). For regular verbs this distinction is 
not significant, but for hollow and defective verbs, the long vowel of the 
present tense may become short in the jussive, and so also be short in the 
imperative. Look at how these common verbs are made into instructions: 
Present 
Imperative (m/f/pl) 
, 
J੻ (taqul) you say/tell !1.jJii / ĥ.i / Ji (qul/qulT/qulu) say/tell! 
,.r"':; (tarmT) you throw !ħ¥JĨ/ ࢏Jħ/ r-JĨ (irmi/irmT/irmu) throw! 
੪ (tujTb) you answer !Iੰi / ੭i / ੮i (ajib/ajTbT/ajTbu) answer! 
Making a negative instruction 
Negative instructions are made by using ';/ la plus the (jussive) present 
verb - this time including the prefix .:; ta/tu: 
(Ia taktubT ismik) !cl4.w1 ࢍ 'i 
Don't write (f) your name !

Arabic in Algeria "':'1j.?J1 . ऻ़I 
Algeria was the last of the North African countries to gain 
independence in 1960. The fierce struggle was made more 
complicated by the fact that Algeria was considered a 'departement' 
(an integral part of France) rather than a colony. 
French has left its mark in the spoken dialect of Algeria, in a 
similar way to the other francophone North African countries. 
The Berber language is also an influence. 
Some features of Algerian dialect are: 
• use of verbal prefix ֱ n - to refer to 'I' : ٶ n%ibb (J like) 
• specifically Algerian expressions such as ְ ba !e" (but) and 
ʃ L:.. ऺ t alakha_r (because) 
• extensive use of French vocabulary (listen for the French words 
'Aotit' (August) and ' famille' (family) in the extract)

'Berber' is a term used by outsiders 
from the Romans to the Arabs. 
The Berbers themselves prefer the 
indigenous word t-'-.Jloi amazTgh 
(Tamazight) to describe their 
ethnicity. The Tamazight language 
is still widely spoken and in some 
places is part of the curriculum. 
The article above concerns its 
introduction into Algerian schools.

REVIEW: Formal Arabic 
1 5 9 
REVIEW: Formal Arabic ݡ1 
It is common to think of Arabic as having a clear division between the 
formal Modern Sta ndard Arabic (MSA) of the press and official 
communication and the informal colloquial dialects of everyday speech. 
In reality this is over-simplistic. The distinction has always been blurred 
and is becoming more so in the age of instant information and live 
broadcasting . 
There are broadcast programmes both in colloquial (films and soap 
operas) and MSA (news and current affairs) . Standard Arabic itself works 
on several different levels. At the top end is the 'high ' Arabic used in 
formal scripted speeches and by scholars and media professionals. In the 
middle is a version used for educated live debate and spontaneous 
discussion. Finally at the lower level there is a utilitarian version - often a 
mixture of MSA and colloquial - used by many Arabic-speakers for pan­
Arab communication. Within one programme - a live debate and listener 
phone-in, for example - it is possible to hear all these different levels from 
the various participants. 
Mastering Arabic concentrates on teaching the less formal version of 
Standard Arabic, the 'middle way', si nce you are unlikely to need to 
produce 'high' Arabic unless you are planning a career as a news 
announcer or an academic scholar! However, it is important to be able to 
listen to and understand the more formal version. 
Although there are some phrases restricted mainly to formal MSA, 
understanding 'high' Arabic is largely a question of recog nising familiar 
vocabulary with fully pronounced endings. These endings represent: 
1. Grammatical cases on nouns and adjectives 
Most words take the case endings shown below. (More details of how the 
cases are formed and used are in the Structure Note sections of Mastering 
Arabic 1 .) 
indefinite 
definite 
ň 
, 
nominative 
..JJ waladun 
..JYI al-walady 
accusative 
I..JJ waladan 
..JęI al-waladf! 
genitive 
;JJ waladln 
..JęI al-waladl 
(Tip: If the case ending is added to a word ending with ta ' marbOta the 
final t is pronounced: madrasail.Q, al-madrastu, etc . )  
2 .  Final vowels on present tense verbs 
Present verbs with no suffix end with r;iamma (-u) when fully pronounced: 
࠳ (yashrab1!, he drinks) . This becomes fatda (-a) in the subjunctive 
ढण (yashrabe and sukOn in the jussive तथ (yashrab). 
See pages 73 and 91 for more details of the subj unctive and jussive.

Arabic on the Worldwide Web ИWI 4S:I/jltt ׵ ЙКt 
Like many other languages, Arabic has had to adapt quickly to the 
terminology of the computer and internet age. Words have been adopted 
from English, for example the 
words w.:...;u! (Internet), 
.;׺ (computer) and 
J=׻! (email) have come 
straight into Arabic. Some of 
the loan words used have 
pure Arabic equivalents, for 
example 'computer' is also 
,-:-,,,..b. uasOb from the root 
v/s/b (to calculate). The 
more extreme Anglicisms 
might not be acceptable in 
a more formal context, for 
example Lr.!Е) Coniine') 
or J״ ('keyboard'). 
Existing Arabic words 
are being applied to new 
concepts. For example, 
ЖЗ..w mudawanna, traditionally used to refer to a diary or journal, is 
now also used to mean 'blog'; (S..G.:..o mu ntadan (assembly room) to mean 
'forum'; ؁I.;.sl ifti ra<;fy (imaginary) to mean 'virtual'; and wU:; 
tafat ulTy (reactive) to mean 'interactive'. In addition, new Arabic words 
are being coined on the hoof to suit the circumstances - for example 
x maklama ('place of talking') for 'chatroom'. 
Comparing media ׼׽"t ׾׿.J ؀..Jw 
To compare the different news media, we first need to review the two 
ways of making adjectives comparative in Arabic. 
aft al pattern 
For short, basic adjectives the root letters can be put into the aft al 
pattern to produce a comparative: 
, 
Ji.S1 (a kthar) more ´ ׶ (kathTr) many 
׸j (ayghar) smaller 
Û z ({aghTr) small 
׹I (ash-har) more famous ´ ׷ (shahTr) famous 
Doubled roots are written together in the comparative pattern, and 
adjectives with a final weak root are written with alif maq|Ora: 

News and media 
J 
, 
лI (akhaff) lighter -+- ׬ (khafff) light (weight) 
(j'Jii (aqwa) stronger -+- 'lJi (qawT) strong 
ׯI (aײla) sweeter --0(- װ (׳ilw) sweet 
1 63 
akthar + noun 
For longer adjectives, in particular those derived from forms of the verb, 
the comparative is formed by using akthar (more). In these comparative 
constructions, the adjective needs to be transformed into a noun. 
;}ױl JiSi (akthar itharatan) --0(- ׭ (muthTr) exciting 
more exciting 
׮\.i:j JiSr (akthar tafatulan) -+- ·\.i:j (tafatutTy) interactive 
more interactive 
The structure in Arabic is 'more as to excitement', 'more as to 
interactivity'. The 'as to' is reflected in the accusative ending -an, carried 
by alif tanwin if the noun does not end in ta marbO}a.

Arabic in the Gulf and Yemen ਧlj ࠯1 .} ਥਦ1 
The Gulf states cover a wide geographical area and varying cultures 
and ethnicities. The dialects of Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman and 
the seven countries of the United Arab Emirates are reasonably close 
to Saudi Arabic. Collectively they are o ften termed 'Gulf' Arabic. 
Yemeni Arabic has developed more independently and has 
several distinct dialects, some retaining features often found only in 
Standard Arabic, for example the classical pronunciation of J and 
the use of vocabulary such as u ';1 ai-an (now) and ..>:!-'-"-:! /.)L. sar/yasTr 
(to g o). In the southern town of Taiz, even the final vowel of the past 
tense ਤy:,., sharibty (I drank), ख nimty (I slept), etc. is retained -
somethi ng that has died out in virtually every other dialect.

The Gulf is home to many of the

Smaller states such as the UAE and 
Qatar are keen to provide backing 
for this kind of broadcasting as such 
ventures can enhance their profile, 
influence and image in the region 
and beyond. The article above

REVIEW: The future

REVIEW: The future 
There is no separate future tense in Arabic. Verbs can be given a future 
meaning by putting -"'" sa- or -.j,J-W sawfa in front of the present tense . 
. ৆I J..!.i ি 
We will arrive before 
(sa -naTil qabla Q-Ruhr) noon. 
-

(sa-takOn darajat al-ēarara munkhafiQa 
be low at night.

.' ুL.. .:\.h..,rI1 ূ ࣼj'-'J The journey will take 
(sawfa tastaghriq ar-riĔla Sat atayn faqa() 
two hours only. 
Negative 
You can make a future negative by putting uJ Ian in front of a present 
verb. Lan is emphatically negative, and carries the implication of 
'definitely not' or 'not ever'. The verb following Ian is the subjunctive 
(see page 73), and so any final nOn will disappear: 
.̽I ,.j ীwi u-J I won't sleep in the 
(Ian anam fTl-khayma) tent. 
ŕ̾I ߎl..:i u-Ji Won't you (fem.) eat 
(a-Ian ta'klT as-samak) the fish? 
.ৈ৉I ,.j .;:.Q", GJ IJJ.?-:! u-J They won't find a room 
(Ian yajidO lana ghurfa fTl-funduq)

5 The journey will take six hours. 
2 It will be rainy on Saturday.

You con talk about future possibilities using Ij! idha or ui in, both 
meaning 'if' Cui being a little more formal). Notice that the first verb is in 
the past tense - literally 'if we went . . .', 'if you drove' - although the 
meaning is 'if we go . . .', 'if you drive . . . '. It is usual to introduce the second 
half of the sentence using ؋ fa- ('then' or 'so'):

Talking about processes uldIe-J1 ě ĸI 
Sometimes a process is more important than who or what carries out 
that process. In this case, we often use a passive verb. Examples of the 
passive in English would be 'the juice is extracted', 'the machines are 
operated by solar energy' (rather than the active 'we extract the juice', 
'solar energy operates the machines'). 
In Arabic the passive is made by changing the vowelling of a verb. In 
the present tense, the first vowel is changed to a c;iamma and the final 
vowel to fatha. This is true for all forms of the verb. Basic verbs in the 
present tense only have c;iamma/fatĕa in the passive; derived verbs retain 
any additional vowelling in the middle: 
߀ (yanqui) transports 
 ޿ (y!J.nqil.l) is transported 
(߃ (yastakhrij) extracts 
-> (߇(y!J.stakhrilj) is extracted 
޽ (yutabbi') packages Ŵ ޹ (Y!J.t,abbQ') is packaged 
The final fatĖa vowel of the passive turns any long vowel in present 
tense hollow and defective verbs into a long a: 
޻ (yabTU sells 
 
t ޺ (y!J.bUU is sold 
j:!߂ (yudTr) operates 
 )߁ (y!J.dࣶr) is operated 
޸ (yuc;iTf) adds 
Ǯ ..j߆ (y!J.c;iUf) is added 
Assimilated verbs drop the first root letter waw in the active present, 
but the waw reappears as a long 0 in the passive: 
޼ (yajid) finds Ŵ ߄; (yD.jild) is found 
޾ (yac;iau puts 
 ߅; (YD.c;iilU is put

Conversation 
Imagine you work for the Drinks of the Future Company and you are the 
tour guide talking about the factory and the processes. 
• review the guided tour on page 1 78 .  Replay the audio, pausing and 
repeating each step out loud; 
• try to memorise as much of the Arabic as you can. 
Now deliver the tour speech yourself. You can use the pictures on 
page 1 78 as prompts, but try not to look at the Arabic. 
Keep repeating this until you are fluent. Memorising and delivering a 
speech will help with your vocabulary and oral confidence. 
There's no additional recording for this conversation, but you can 
replay the tour guide on page 1 78 to check your version.

Talking about processes in the past 
The principle of changing the vowelling of a verb to create the present 
passive extends to the past passive. As for the present, the first vowel in the 
past passive is a c;iamma, but the final vowel in the past passive is kasra. You 
may also see an additional c;iamma as the middle vowel in derived forms: 
Jt. (naqa/a) tra nsported - Ji (nllqlla) was transported 
ޮ.J (wajada) found I ޱ޲ (wlljlda) was found 
Cfo..! (istakhraja) extracted ¾ cĠ/ (ustukhrija) was extracted 
The final kasra vowel of the past passive creates a long 1 in the derived 
forms of hollow verbs. However, the past passive of basic hollow verbs 
has no initial c;iamma, leaving only the long I: 
, 
, 
j.li (adara) operated ¾ স..li (lldIra) was operated 
Exercise 10 
, .  i;.JĶ 
Convert these past verbs into the passive, as in the example. 
1 ޭ (Ûanata) manfactured  
2 ޳޴! (istakhdama) used/employed-ą 
3 Jl.j (qala) said I

Arabic in Libya 4-+tJ ] <4-!rJ1 
ii!1 
Many empires, including the Greeks, the Romans and the Ottoman 
 
Turks, have left their mark on Libya. More recently in the first half of 
	 
the twentieth century it was an Italian colony, gaining full 
	 
independence in 1949. Italian still influences the spoken dialect of 
 
Libya, as does the indigenous Tamazight (Berber) language. 
Some features of Libyan dialect are: 
 
• use of verbal prefix "":' n- to refer to 'I', e.g. ऋ nÞibb (I like), in 
ii!1 
common with many other North African dialects 
݄ 
• use of Turkish and Italian loan words, the latter particularly for 
	 
machinery and technical voca bulary 
	 
.
'
 Listen to Abdul Rahim talking about himself in his Libyan dialect. 
	 
You will find a transcript and translation in the Answers section . 
ű 
(Notice how Abdul Rahim uses ݢ ßabtan, literally meaning 
ii!1 
'of course' or 'naturally', as a general filler word.)

Try to give them as much advice as possible using the language that you 
know. There's no single correct answer, but you'll find some suggestions in 
the answer section. 
Tip: In colloquial Arabic, the construction 'min al-. . .  an' is often reduced to 
just the key word. So min al-Iazim an would become simply lazim; min ac;l­
c;larOri an would become c;larO rT: lazim takul al-khuc;lrawat (you must eat 
vegetables); c;larOrT aktub eemayl (I need to write an email) .

Arabic in Sudan ul Jy..J I  גדI 
.,.,-JI "';>ll 4S.I..I1 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 
K e n y a  
'Sudanese' Arabic usually refers to the spoken language of 
Khartoum and the north of Sudan. In addition to Arabic, there are 
over a hundred indigenous languages, three of the most widely 
spoken being Nubian in the north and Dinka and Nuer in the south. 
Features of Sudanese Arabic include: 
• pronunciation of J as a hard 'g', e.g. uAJ (time) as wagt 
• use of b- in front of present verbs describing habitual actions, in 
common with many other dialects, e.g. ϿЀ baØibb (I like) 
• use of specifically Sudanese expressions, e.g. Ф Ùassat (now) 
and ? I  al-Iayla with the meaning of 'today'.

A large proportion of the population of Jordan were originally from 
Palestine and the two dialects are very similar. They also share many 
features with Syrian colloquial (see page 52), particularly the softer 
lilt and the pronunciation of ė as 'eh' or 'ee'. 
Listen to Youssef talking about himself in his Palestinian dialect. 
, ' You will find a transcript and translation in the Answers section. 

She had reached her seventy-
fifth year ... and if she were asked 
about the meaning of this word, 
"the homeland", then the matter 
would have confused her ... 
Is it the house? The washing tub 
and the pestle for 'kibba' 
[minced meat 1 which she 
inherited from her mother? .. 
Or is it the call of the milkmaid 
in the morning ... Or the chesty 
cough of the husband, and the 
wedding nights of her children, 
who departed this threshold for 
the marital home one after the 
other, leaving her by herself? 
Palestine has produced some of the most powerful poets and 
storytellers of the 20th and 21st centuries - the poets Mahmoud 
Darwish (1941 -2008, see page 1 77) and Samih al-Qasim (1939-) 
and the writer Emile Habibi (1922-1996) to name but three. Poetry 
readings can still attract mass audiences and there is a strong Arabic 
tradition of storytelling. Not surprisingly, exile, loss and confused 
identity are common themes in Palestinian literature. 
The above extract is taken from 
a short story by Emile Habibi, 
t.J4J..u., ΍Iy' "The Mandelbaum Gate" 
(a checkpoint between the Israeli and the 
lordanian sectors of Jerusalem until 1967). 
In this passage, the author is exploring 
the experiences and memories of an old 
Palestinian woman and her attitude to 
the 'homeland' (uJoyl al-waŵan). 
Emile Habibi (1922- 1996), writer and 
politician, lived all his life in Haifa.

Hello. My name is Fouad Haddad and I live in Beirut, the district of 
Achrafieh. I am originally from Khencharah Metn, a village in the 
mountains, lOOOm above sea level. My accent is the accent of Beirut 
residents who originally came from remote areas. 
I am married and have two boys, one 16 years old and the other 12. 
Khalil the eldest likes music and plays the piano and 5amir the younger 
one likes sports and plays football and basketball. 
I graduated from the American University of Beirut and I am working as 
a programmer for a computer company. The company sends me to work 
on projects all over the Arab world, especially the Gulf. In my spare time, 
and especially during the weekend, I take the family - in winter -
to ski in the mountains. During summer we like to go to the beach and 
swim in the sea.
